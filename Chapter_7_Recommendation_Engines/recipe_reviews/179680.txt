I made this cake for Thanksgiving last year and everyone requested it again this year.  I made 5 cakes for Thanksgiving this year!!!  My only suggestions would be to double up on the ingredients when making cake to make a pretty fuller cake, I mix isn't enough. When you double up it comes out sooo much prettier! I also added vanilla to it. But aside from that the cake is perfect as is, try it! You will impress everyone, I promise!

YUM!! Using just once cake mix, the rounds weren't big enough to cut in half, so I just made it a two layer cake, and put more of the filling on top, and then drizzled the caramel syrup all over it. My hubby couldn't get enough of it, even though it's not part of his Weight Watcher's plan! I also made my own pumpkin pie spice, just used cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I screwed this recipe up in several places and it still turned out great!  I ended up making the yellow cake mix according to the directions (high altitude) on the box and added an entire can of pumpkin to the batter.  I baked it in a bundt pan, and it came out perfect.  I made the frosting without the pumpkin since I had accidentally used it all in the cake mix - still tasted great.  I only made two layers of frosting - one in the middle and one on the top.  I poured carmel sauce over the frosting and then topped with chopped pecans.  It looked and tasted fabulous!  My guests were even taking pictures of it!

I made this recipe for a girls night dinner and it was a HIT!  It's very impressing since it's 4 layers and looks fancy- but it's very easy and supper yummy!  If you like pumpkin- you MUST try!  Next time I think i'll leave the pumpkin out of the filling so the cream cheese flavor is stronger.

I made this cake for the fire fighters at my brother's station.  There was not ONE crumb left they loved it so much.  All of them said the best part was the frosting.  This was a very easy cake to make and I will be making it again tomorrow for Thanksgiving.  I did not change anything in the recipe.  The only thing I might do different tomorrow is chop up the pecans and sprinkle them on each layer of frosting.  The caramel wasn't needed either...it was sweet enough but fun to use for presentation.

I did not have any pumpkin spice so in place of the 1 tsp pumpkin spice for the cake part of the recipe, I used 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg, 1/8 tsp ground cloves, and 1/4 tsp ginger. The cake turned out delicious! However, one of my two cakes stuck very badly to the pan and could not be salvaged. But I was more careful removing the other one and went ahead and made it by itself (so I had only a 2 layer cake instead of 4) and it actually turned out to be a better size for the occasion anyway. Instead of the cream cheese filling I made a pumpkin spice filling using 1 pkg pumpkin spice instant pudding, 1 cup milk, and 1 1/2 cups whipped cream. It was fabulous!

I wish I could rate this a 10, this was seriously one of the most amazing cakes I've ever had. My favorite cake otherwise is Carrot, and the texture and taste of the whip cream frosting reminded me of it. It was way good! I only changed one thing, I used 1/3 cup of apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil. (If I recall)....I love adding a lot of apple sauce to my cakes, it always makes it so good.The apple sauce just makes it so much than when using oil. I used Hershey's caramel and drizzled it not only over the top but added more to my own slice. After letting it soak over night in the cake, it had the most richest sweetest taste, it was really to die for. Wouldn't change anything else, it was wonderful!

Loved this cake.  Doubled the recipe as suggested by some, way to much cake.  Will only use one cake next time.  Everyone loved this!  A definite keeper.

AMAZING!!  This was a hit at Christmas. I made this cake because I love everything made with pumpkin except pumpkin pie (it's a texture thing.) This cake is wonderful and not "icky" sweet or heavy.  I made the recipe exactly as written and don't think I'll change a thing the next time as it was just perfect.   I learned a great trick for slicing the layers in half that works much better than using a serrated knife:  I use a piece of dental floss and pull it gently through the cake.  It cuts it perfectly and you don't risk getting the angle wrong on the knife and ending up with misshapen wedges.  If it seems a bit difficult to start the floss through the outside of the cake, just start a small slit with a knife and then finish up with the floss -- perfectly sliced layers!

My hubbies all time fav!! I'm an accomplished baker and I made this on a whim!! He had no idea it was only semi- homemade, I kinda don't want to tell him how easy it was to make! Put flour on my face and whined about how much trouble I went to! Hope my secret is safe!! JK!! Definetly a keeper!! Added vanilla to filling mix (3/4) tsp. Much better..recipe is fine the way it is, just take care slicing cakes in half!! Take your time and use a serrated knife! No trouble at all!!

I have been making this cake for the past three years around the holidays and it is ALWAYS a huge hit. Some things that I changed...  -I buy an extra can of pumpkin and add a little more to the batter (about 1/4 cup extra) -Instead of adding milk to the batter, I use pumpkin spice coffee creamer. -vanilla -butter instead of oil -a little extra pumpkin spice  For the filling...  -I use 1 1/4 packages of cream cheese -1 1/2 cup powdered sugar -a little extra spice -I add 1/3 stick butter -tsp vanilla  When I layer the cake, I drizzle caramel on each layer.  The original recipe is of course terrific but I really like to tweak things here and there. I think it really does make a difference. :)

Go to Kraft.com and watch the video on how to make this cake.  It is so easy and absolutely wonderful.  I made mine a 3 layer cake instead of 4.  I iced the top and sprinkled with pecans and then drizzeled the caramel.  Oh my gosh...so good.  Easy and beautiful.

I loved this!! The only thing I did differently was cubed the cooked cake and layered it in a pretty dish. I'm terrible at getting the layers right & to stay in place-so it just made my job easier!

This cake was delicious!!! I doubled the frosting recipe good thing I did, It seemed like otherwise it was not enough for all the layers, I had enough to frost the top layer as well, then did the carmel and pecans on top. Everyone loved it!!!

This was a very moist cake!  I really like pumpkin, so I thought it was good, but I would probably decrease the pumpkin added to the cream cheese mixture!  I did double the recipe like suggested by others and it just made too much!!

this cake is terrific and very easy to make, it makes a wonderful presentation also.  I brought it to a carry-in for thanksgiving and then had to send everyone the recipe.  It was voted the best dessert at the party!  Looks impressive, tastes great.

Made this for Thanksgiving, something different from the usual pumkpin pie and everyone loved it.  My mother-in-law didn't even offer it up to anyone as they left, I think she's keeping it all to herself!

I'm sure this review won't be terribly useful, but it might make someone laugh. This cake turned out to be my first official cooking disaster. My cat got up on the stove and turned the dial to 500F while it was baking. I finally smelled it burning and probably just in time to prevent a fire! The cake was ruined, but I had already made the frosting in the background and it was delicious, so I used it on some store-bought pound cake. I will try this again soon as the batter smelled fantastic & it was easy!

Excellent cake even though I really don't like using Cool Whip.  Next time I will try it with sweetened whipped cream instead.  Mine didn't look so great without the sides frosted, so I used more Cool Whip to frost the top and sides.  It looked beautiful before and after cutting, in addition to the great taste!

Super Yummy! I have made this cake several times. I always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe, plus it is so easy to make! My only change is to add more pumpkin pie spice, as I like a little more spice. If you take a thin slice off  the top of one of the cakes with a bread knife ( to create a flat surface) it makes it easier to stack. Overall, a great cake.

I have made this cake every year since Kraft first published it.  I can't even eat it anymore but I still make it because I know how delicious it is and how everyone raves over it.  The trick to cutting 4 layers from 2 standard cake rounds is using thread and pulling it thru the layers gently but firmly.  Cuts perfect layers every time.   Also, using Spice cake mix instead of yellow a big plus!

This was the first layer cake I've ever made, and it turned out great! We didn't have any pumpkin pie spice, but used a mixture of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves instead. At my sister's recommendation, I also made an extra half recipe of the filling so I could lay it on a little thicker. I even forgot to add any pumpkin to the filling but it still tasted great! (In fact my sister thinks it tasted better that way!) We also think it could be great using other kinds of cake mixes too to change the flavors.

Truly a treat! I wanted to mix things up a little and get away from the usual pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving. The Cool Whip in the filling makes a world of difference. The filling looks so rich, but tastes as light as a cloud! The family requested I make this one again :)

My cousin made this for Thanksgiving a couple years back, I've made it every year since and then some!  I sometimes add nuts and caramel between each layer to add more crunch.  I also use the frosting alone as a pie filler in a graham cracker crust topped with caramel and pecans.  Very, Very good cake and pie!

I added an extra step. I frosted cake with whip cream. I wanted it to be for a birthday cake for my coffee gang. It was gone by the end of the party. The guys all begged for a 2nd piece. I used home made caramel sauce as I find it simple to make a small amount as needed.

A friend of mine brought this to me for my birthday!   I had to have the recipe because it was SO good... glad I found it on here!  It is just amazing to say the least.  Not to mention it has to be fairly easy since my friend is not a fan of baking but she made this flawlessly!  YUM!

Wonderful and tasty. Very moist. I accidentally added more pie spice, but still turned out great. It had great pumpkin flavor and was a nice alternative to pumpkin pie (which I am not a big fan of because of the texture). I will definitely be making this again. I've already had a request for it to be made for Christmas.

I would chill the frosting a bit before adding it in between the layers. The weight of the cake smashed it down a little because the icing is fluffy before it's refridgerated. Very good!!

This cake was RICH.  Yummy, but SWEET.  The cake itself is delicious and the frosting too, but in the future I would halve the frosting.  Also, I'd recommend having an alternate dessert for those who are not pumpkin fans.  The flavor isn't really pumpkin-y but enough to discourage a number.

I made this luscious cake twice already this year and it is fabulous!  I followed the reciped as written and my family and guests loved it.  I only used one cake mix, as others doubled, and one cake mix is definately enough. I also followed tips and used dental floss to slice through my layers. I started the cut with a knife and then ran dental floss through the entire cake.

I love it!! I only had pumpkin pie in a can and I just drained it to get most of the liquid out.  I didn't use cool whip, I used the powder whipped topping.  I love the taste of pumpkin so I also used lots of pumpkin spice. . . .don't be shy with it! It smelled GREAT and tasted even better!  I can't wait to make it again! I didn't top it with anything. I'll be honest it wasn't the prettiest cake, but with its taste, it didn't matter!

I made two 6" cakes and 4 cupcakes with this recipe. I filled the layers with the provided recipe and frosted it with cream cheese frosting. 

After cutting the layers to make them even, I had the tops of the cakes left over. To use them I cut them into small pieces and baked them again until they got dried out and crumbly. I put them in a small blender to make them crumbs. Once the cake was frosted I used the crumbs to coat the side of the cake as decoration. I had some whole walnuts as well and put those around the top edges as decoration. I wish I could upload a picture because it tured out really nice.

With the cupcakes I had I filled them with the cream cheese/pumpkin filling, then piped cream cheese frosting on top and added a walnut.

Made this cake a day ahead for a baby shower last October and everyone raved about it.  It went before the other cakes and everyone thought I made it from scratch instead of starting with a cake mix (that will be our secret lol).  It looks so elegant when done and it was so delicious and moist.  I'm making it again for Thanksgiving.

We loved it.  I wasn't paying attention and used the whole can of pumpkin for the cake.  It was wonderful.  everyone agreed we should always use the full can.  I had another can on hand and used 2/3C of the pumpkin in the filling.  It was good the first day, but we all liked it better the second day.

I made this back in 2004 when I found it in  a magazine.  I have made it a few times for Thanksgiving and it always turns our well.  It is a simple cake to put together and looks pretty much like the main photo every time. I would suggest though (as this recipe is 9 years old) that you check the size of your cake mix.  Most boxes are now downsized.  What once was a little over 18 ounces is now down to 15 ounces.  This may throw off the recipe balance when combined with the other ingredients. You need approximately 1/3 - 1/2 cup of additional cake mix to make up the the missing 3 ounces.  You can buy a second box and freeze leftovers for another time should you make cake, using a mix, often.

This is a delicious and easy cake.  I've made it several times and it always gets compliments.  People even ask me to make 'that pumpkin cake.'  Messed up on the recipe once trying to make it from memory and added the entire can of pumpkin, it was still good and was like eating pumpkin pie in cake form.  Yummy!

Perfect cake.  I was nervous about slicing the cakes in half, but it was the perfect consistency for it.  So much easier to make then it looks!  Great flavor, without being too rich or sweet.  Everyone loved it!  I will be using this recipe a lot during the holiday season!!

Very nice! The only change I made was to toss the pecans in a bit of the caramel sauce after toasting them and put them back into the oven for a few minutes to make a sort of no-effort candy coating for them. Also had the bonus of making the pecans sticky enough that they would stay wherever I placed them on top of the cake.
That said, it dries out rather quickly, so probably best if you have enough people to finish it the night you make it.

This is delicious!  I made it for a friend's birthday and I"m making another one for my borther in law's birthday today.  My husband demanded I Nix the chocolate cake I had planned and make this one again.  I did double the recipe and I'm glad I did because the bottom of one the cakes stuck.  Make sure to grease AND flour your pans.

Made this for a small family dinner and it was amazing....My daughter who loves pumpkin pie said she actually loved this more.  She took a slice to a teacher who ended up not liking pumpkin pie and said she never knew she liked pumpkin until she ate this cake.  This will be made again, question is how long can we wait to have it again.  Taste even better the next day and the frosting holds up great.

This was delicious...I really enjoyed the pumpkin flavor in the frosting. I usually make a cream cheese frosting to go on top of my pumpkin cake, but my family enjoyed this frosting more. Thanks.

It was AMAZING, even though I goofed and added the entire can of pumpkin to the cake.  No pumpkin in the icing and it was still very good.  It needed a few more minutes of cooking time, but I will be making it again.  Very quick, very easy, Amazingly tasty!

I MADE THIS AMAZING CAKE FOR A FAMILY COOKOUT THIS PAST WEEKEND AND WHAT A HIT IT WAS. I WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH A DESERT AND WHEN I TOOK IT OUTSIDE TO SHARE IT WAS GONE WITHIN MINUTES. THE ONLY THING I FORGOT WAS TO ADD THE LAST BIT OF PUMPKIN TO THE ICING BUT IT WAS SOOOO GOOD. THIS IS A REAL KEEPER AND A WONDERFUL DESERT FOR THE HOLIDAYS

Ive made this at least 5 times over the last couple months for festive gatherings. It looks great as a cake but it is much less messy as cupcakes and the portions are smaller so more people can have some. The cupcakes still look pretty cute. Use a piping bag with out the piping tip to make the icing look neater sprinkle pecans and drizzle a little caramel on top. If you still want a layered effect cut the ccakes in half but not the paper and fill the centre with the icing too. Super cute and super yummy

to cut fat and cals use light cream cheese and cool whip still taste great.

Awesome! I doubled the cake batter, because other reviews said the cakes were too thin to slice. I didn't really have to, though. When the cakes came out of the oven, I thought they'd be ok to slice. Regardless, this was the hit of (Canadian) Thanksgiving! I also iced the top of the cake, and then placed pecans on the outside edge of the cake. Beautiful presentation and relatively easy to make.

With Thanksgiving less than 2 weeks away, I decided to test this recipe out before making it for my guests. I followed the recipe to the "T" and it came out absolutely delicious. The caramel sauce I used (Hershey brand) was a little thin - so next time I'll be using a higher quality caramel sauce or making my own. Also, I'll probably add extra pecans to each layer of the cake, as everyone in my family loves them.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed.....I was expecting it to have the flavor of a Pumpkin Roll type dessert.....my mistake. To me, the flavors were a bit bland, the cream cheese frosting was good and lite in texture, but I think I'd like it better with standard cream cheese frosting mixed with a little Pumpkin Pie Mix....no cool whip. It was easy to make and my guests all said they liked it, but I feel like  they were being gracious. It was very pretty.....and when I brought it out..everyone ooooohhh'd and aaaawwww'd, but I don't think I serve it again without modifications.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it. I followed the original recipe on the kraft website. The only difference is a 15oz. can of pumpkin and 8oz. tub of cool whip (I ended up using about 2 cups of cool whip)

The cake was ok... it needed more of a pumpkin flavor.  The filling also needed something as well.  They were not terrible, but I have had better.

I made this twice and LOVED it the second time!!! Here's what I did to make it a 5-star cake:  add one heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and one heaping teaspoon of nutmeg and regular teaspoon of sugar..... all instead of pumpkin pie spice, which I think taste terrible (ginger and cloves have no business in any pumpkin dessert). Also, I added the same measurements of spices in the frosting (minus the sugar) and it also helped make this a 5-star cake!! A huge hit at Thanksgiving dinner... not a piece left. Oh, I drizzled the caramel sauce (yum) but omitted the nuts as many do no like them on cakes.

I made this cake as a double recipe because I read that the layers came out really thin... other than tasting the crumbs and filling I haven't actually eaten it yet... but I'm very excited!

Baked in 4 - 8" rounds... Used 1.5 of the recipe (3 rounds) to make a large formal three layer for Thanksgiving... made a small 2-layer from the 4th round for home.

Drizzled  the caramel on top... then made a ring of candied pecans on top to allow the caramel to slightly pool for extra decadence.

This is a great recipe - easy to make, beautiful presentation and it was a big hit at my office.  I followed directions exactly and it turned our perfectly.  The next time I might divide the filling into fourths and use some on the top before drizzling on the carmel and nuts.  The carmel seeps into the cake which s fine if it's all consumed immediately!

This is a light and melt in your mouth dessert!  The ONLY thing I so a little different, is to divide the frosting in fourths and frost the top too.  Have made this twice for two different groups and all loved it!

This is a beautiful cake that's easy to make and delicious.  The only change I made was to melt about 10-15 Kraft Caramels in a double boiler with 2 tablespoons of half and half then add the ice cream caramel sauce to it. Let it cool slightly and thicken if needed before drizzling over the top and down the sides of the cake. I used an icing bag with a decorative tip to pipe the filling in between the layers and I think that helped the filling to be distributed more evenly - and it looked pretty too!
Next time I make it I will double the nuts and caramel sauce and drizzle a little caramel and nuts in between the other layers to add a little more flavor punch to the whole cake since the cake and filling flavor is pretty mild.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was devoured!  Beautiful, and yet so easy to make.  I accidentally burnt the pecans for the topping so I replaced them with chopped hazelnuts.  That was only change I made.  Will definitely make again.

I made this as a sugar free version and it was a hit at my party last night. I used Sugar Free yellow cake mix and sugar free cool whip! I did have to add some Splenda though to the icing cause it wasn't sweet enough. I also only did two layers and it was fine.

Absolutely incredible!  Made this for a get together with some neighbors and everyone swooned over it!  Two weeks later, and I'm making another one so we can have it for Thanksgiving dinner.  So wonderfully delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly.

Nothing but good reviews.  I'm not much of a pumpkin fan myself, but my Sister has an October birthday so I made this a few years back for our family gathering and she has now requested it for the last 2 years.  The creamy pumkin filling in between layers is what makes this cake luscious IMHO....  Very fun and easy to make.  And I love pleasing the masses!!  :)
