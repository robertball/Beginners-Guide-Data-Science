i didn't have mace on hand so i went out and bought it.  on the back of the container it had a "flavorful tip" saying that 1/4 tsp ground mace = 1 tsp ground nutmeg.  i had nutmeg at home and wouldn't have spent $4.50 on mace that i probably won't use again. oh well, now i know for next time.  hope this helps somebody.  happy cooking!

I saw this recipe featured on St. Patty's Day and saved it. I just now made it and am sorry that I didn't make it earlier. I used kale instead of broccoli only because I had kale in the fridge and also wanted the dish to turn out greener in color. Yum! The flavors of the leeks, potatoes and kale together along with the little bit of ground mace was delicious. Just be careful on how much mace you put into this dish because it can overwhelm the other flavors. The recipe says a pinch and it means a pinch. I always tend to go heavier on herbs and spices, but not on mace because it's strong. The overall appearance is exactly as photographed and is a crowd pleaser. I really enjoyed Colcannon.

This is one of my all-time favorite comfort foods.  The only addition I have made is to use half and half instead of milk for added richness.
This is wonderful with Roast chicken and I have done it for 200 guests at a fundraiser paired with roast pork loin.

I prefer to shred and saute the cabbage.  I use green onions instead of leeks.  We often have this for St Patrick's Day.  For New Year's day we have this with ham steaks as ham and cabbage are supposed to be good luck. pats

Terrific stuff.  Prefer to steam  potatoes instead of boiling.  Just eyeballed ingredients but probably used only 1/4 cup butter.  Garnished with a bit of crumbled bacon and fresh chives.  Next time I'll be sure to remove the rib parts of the cabbage and chop more finely.  Definitely use the leeks!

I agree with PATS1942 in that I saute the cabbage in butter, but I also saute the leeks, too.  You can never have too much butter in potatoes, as far as I'm concerned.  My family loves colcannon.  I serve it with stew over it.  The stew always has Guinness stout in it, too!

Yum! I made this for a potluck dinner party at my boss's house. It was a huge success. I used Yukon gold potatoes, which I cut in chunks, boiled and then cooled and peeled. The skins came right off with my fingers - much easier than peeling the raw potato. I think Yukons are best for mashed potatoes - not too waxy and not too dry. 

I sliced the cabbage and leeks into roughly 1/2 by 1 inch pieces, separating the layers as I put them in a dutch oven.  Some people suggested sauteing the cabbage and leeks in butter, but I think that would have made the dish to greasy.  Instead, I cooked the cabbage and the leeks together with enough Half & Half to cover over very, very low heat, so it wouldn't scorch and ruin the whole thing. This probably took an hour, stirring about every 10 min. I set the timer on the stove, and it just about coordinates with the frequency of commercials on TV! When they were tender, I poured off the H&H to use later and thoroughly drained the cabbage and leeks in a colander. Then I rough mashed everything together with a hand masher, adding the leftover H&H as needed. In this dish, I like the potatoes to be a little chunky, so they stand up to the cabbage and leeks.

As the finishing touch, I sprang for Irish butter (Kerrygold)- much creamier and authentic. I made this the night before and then warmed it up for a couple of hours and served from my crock pot. 

Finally, I am going to blend the left overs with some of the left over H&H to make a potato soup!

I had this for the first time in Dublin 12/07 and it was so good there I had to find a recipe to make it here.  I changed/added a few things.I used  1/2 pound of kale, 1 cup of buttermilk and fresh garlic.  Saute the kale,leeks,and garlic in the butter (add about a teaspoon or so of olive oil so butter doesn't burn)until soft and add to potatoes.  I added the buttermilk right to the potato mixture.  It was so good...
thank you for the recipe it was great!!!

I loved the "clean" taste of this chowder with no meat base.  I did make a few changes because it was almost too thick to eat as directed by the original recipe.  I used 1.5 cups Half and Half, and 1 cup milk to soften the leeks, then add to the base; and I added 2 tsp salt, a few grinds of pepper, and a lot (1/4 tsp?) of freshly ground nutmeg.  Also I hand-chopped everything rather than use a processor or blender so that the vegetable pieces would be big enough to add tactile interest and a variety of colors. Incidentally, after the cabbage was cooked it was a breeze to chop!  All together the dish took about 40 minutes to prepare, and serves 6 - 8.  It was wonderful immediately, but fantastic the next day!

Excellent Irish dish.  I left out the butter & milk, and instead boiled everything in the same vegetable broth.  I then added a whole head of roasted garlic for extra flavor.  Will definitely make again.

I love colcannon, so when I received leeks and cabbage in my CSA box I thought I'd give it a try. I thought this recipe needed a little something to get my husband to eat it, so I also added cooked bacon.  I substituted mace with nutmeg.  It tasted great and I froze it in two portions for a freezer-meal side.  Reheated great in the oven.

I was a bit scared of this, because although I had heard it was great and was very curious, it just seemed odd.  Slimey cabbage mucking up mashed potatoes?    However, I had nothing to fear, it was delicious.  I used red cabbage as I had it on hand, and wow!  The colors were crazy the night I made it, leftover seemed to intensify! (I'll try and post a photo.)  Anyway, it's a flexible recipe, and I'm sure I'll be using it again and again.

Great basic recipe--a hit with the Celtic Society I belong to... I prefer more potatoes as other reviewers mentioned. I use 1 cup sour cream instead of milk and add 1 t. of garlic powder. Sometimes I soften the cabbage in bacon grease and add crumbled bacon. It lends itself well to playing with the ingredients a bit.

This is literally a magical recipe!!! Truly heaven!!! I know the mix of ingredients sound different but believe me, it is out of this world to be certain!!!  I have friends who tell me they dream about eating this dish at night and crave it all the time.  Its so unusual, so versatile, so satisfying!!  I served Irish Stout beef stew with this but you could serve roast chicken, pork tenderloin, I've even served chili with this!!!  The possibilities are endless and oh so delicious so definitely give this one a try, and be sure to keep a few copies handy if you serve it to friends bc they ARE going to beg you for the recipe!!!

I didn't expect to like it and only made it because I got a head of cabbage and some leeks in my CSA box. I thought since I was making "Sheperd's Pie" I'd made it with colcannon instead of just mashed potatoes. I chopped the cabbage and steamed it with salt, boiled the potatoes with salt then drained each and mixed them together while the leeks were simmering. I used a little more than a cup of milk because the leeks needed it to cover them. I then mixed it all together and kept it warm in the oven while I made the "cream corn like no other' recipe from here for the middle layer. Then I layered it all and even my picky son ate it w/o protest! Will definitely make again and invite some Emerald Isle friends over in March for a Sheperd's Pie with colcannon.

Delicious recipe, even my six year old ate a big bowl. I veganized this recipe for myself. I boiled the cabbage and potatoes in broth and and then used plain soy milk for the leeks. I mixed in some margarine (earth balance) with the potatoes before I added the rest of the ingredients. Don't forget the mace. When I initially tasted it after adding the veggies I thought it needed something and was considering adding garlic, when I realized I'd forgotten the mace. I put a pinch in and was surprised to find  it was perfect after that. Somehow it adds just the right edge to the dish. I mixed in some butter when I gave it my kids and  it went over very well. The next morning I mixed in some eggs and fried it up for my husband and he said it was yummy, so this is a pretty versatile dish. I think I'm going to try using Kale next time and see how that it is. All in all a great recipe for St. Paddy's day!

I stumbled upon this recipe by accident and was shocked cause this has been a family recipe that's been passed down through generations, had no idea anyone else did it!  Love this!  If you don't like cabbage, don't worry... nobody in my family does but me, and people go back for three and four servings of this.

Because of dairy allergies I substitute chicken broth for the milk and butter. Still just as good. I usually leave out the leeks too.

Delightfully simple and tasty -- I used kale instead of cabbage for more flavor. Took this to a work luncheon for St. Patrick's Day and it was a hit! I'll definitely be making it again with extra kale.

This recipe is really flexible about ingredients, and when I whipped mine up in the food processor, it was a perfect velvety fluff. Divine! Still, this is not meant to be a main dish, and I could see a fantastic mushroom gravy to spruce it up.

Delicious combination. I made a couple of changes- used 1/2 cup of light sour cream instead of butter, and skipped the mace. However, I boiled the potatoes in the water that my corned beef was in, so they were flavored with all of those spices. The leeks REALLY made the flavor here.

I am so in love with this dish! I prepare these for St. Patty's Day every year.  I do not boil my cabbage!! I chop bacon and fry it crispy then saute the chopped/shredded cabbage in the grease, with s&p till golden brown. I add the bacon to my colcannon... OH MY! Sometimes I put my finished product under a broiler to let the tops of the potatoes get toasty. Then I made a well in the center of each persons serving and filled it with a spoonful of melted herb butter.

Very tasty, but use less milk than the recipe calls for.  I also added garlic and sauteed the leeks and cabbage rather than boiling.  I think this would be delicious with a little bacon, but I made this for a work potluck and wanted to be considerate of vegetarians.  Next time, I'll try it with kale for more color and character than the cabbage.  For those who are wondering, mace is the outer coating of nutmeg, which is why they have similar flavors (mace is the flavoring in doughnuts).    This is a very nice alternative to regular mashed potatoes!

I like colcannon, and I liked this recipe, though I by far prefer the batch I made with kale - both visually, texture-wise, and taste-wise.  A touch of garlic and a parsley garnish seemed a nice touch for me.

Edit: I interpreted "Blend in kale..." as "Stir in kale".  It looks more attractive and has more texture if you do it this way.

Loved this!  I had never even heard of Colcannon before and was just randomly searching AR for some cabbage recipes.  I just eyeballed the amount of potatoes and cabbage, and think I need more cabbage next time.  Following a few others' suggestions, I did add approximately 1 teas. garlic powder (will use fresh, roasted garlic next time) and was generous with the salt and pepper.  I didn't have enough milk on hand but had some sour cream leftover, so I did 1/2 c milk and 1/2 sour cream (I've always loved sour cream on baked potatoes).  Worked just fine and gave it a nice richness! Definitely making this again soon - Thanks for opening my eyes, Marc!

Excellent recipe.  I added a bit more of the leeks and cooked the cabbage much longer, but it was deliciousl. A wonderful alternative for potatoes.

This was a really nice dish -- creamy and delicious. It was nice to make this with corned beef and carrots... I could make this separately and still have room for the meat in crock pot! Even the picky eaters liked it.

I used the leeks, about four golden potatoes (which is maybe more than a pound) and substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for the milk. This recipe was PERFECT! My family absolutely loved it and I will definitely make it again. We do have a few leftovers from St. Patrick's Day but I'm going to use them to make a kind of boxty. Yum! Great recipe!!

My hubby loved this, me -- not so much.  Two leeks were too much; the amount of milk to cover them was enormous and if I'd put all that in the potatoes they would have been soupy.  I only put in a small part and they were still wayyyyy too runny for me.  I did like the cabbage and leek combo, but I ended up adding some sour cream and garlic powder to help the flavor.  I may tweak this recipe a little and try it again.

Oh my!  Made this for a large easter party and everyone raved about it.  A little time consuming but more then well worth it!  My tip:  season the water the well that you boil your leeks and potatoes.  Enjoy!

I'm not sure how to rate this recipe since I had never heard of it and don't know how it should taste.  It was a hit and non-cabbage fans said that the cabbage did not overwhelm.  I can't say that I had a "green fluff" as described.  Maybe my cabbage was not shredded enough.  I also thought it seemed a little runny but I am comparing it to mashed potatoes and don't really know what the consistency should be.  Either way, I would make it again for an Irish meal.

I've never had Colcannon before so I have no idea what this was supposed to taste like. Also, I think I used too much milk. I cut up 2 leeks, and simmered them in the milk but I didn't add the entirety of the leeks to the mashed potatoes b/c I think it would have been overwhelming. The milk had plenty of leek flavor to it. I will definitely try Colcannon again (to eat, not make), but it was a bit too much work for mashed potatoes that tasted kinda 'meh'

This was alright.  I would have actually given it three stars except it was my error that took it down a notch.  I found it to be a little too liquidy for my tastes but that will be easily fixed on the next round by not adding all of the milk or addining more potatoes.  The flavor was fine but even better the second day.

Beautiful color. I think I will try more potatoes & fewer leeks next round. The only flavor that was coming through was onion. I dumped in sour cream afterwards to smoothe out the taste.

Came out a little wetter than I liked.  I'll use half a cup of milk to cook the leeks (or onions) next time, and add more milk only if the mixture needs it.

With all of the milk, this would be an excellent base for a cassarole with sausages on top.

Though I'm not sure what this should have tasted like, I liked what I ended up with.  I doubled the potatoes, cut the butter in half, didn't use any of the milk the leeks were boiled in and pureed the cooked cabbage in my food processor to make a thicker mashed potato-like dish.  My picky hubby kept coming into the kitchen to see my "3-pot potatoes", worrying that it was green and wondering what the leeks were.  But, to my suprize and his, he liked them too!  I think a little garlic would have made them even better and may add some when I do this for real (this was a trial run) for a St. Patty's day potluck later this month.  Thanks for the recipe!

My hubby loved the cabbage/bacon mixture so much, he was disappointed I added it to the potatoes! I had to put the pan in the oven to stop him from eating the mix before I could get the stuff to the table! Seeing the beautiful Irish butter melting in the middle made me forget my diet completely!

Love this stuff!  I make it every St. P Day and my husband wishes I would make it more often.  The first time I used green onions instead of leeks; the second time following the recipe.  We preferred the green onions for more flavor.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day dinner.  My husband wasn't so sure about this and after he tasted it, he said it was a "keeper".  
The only chnage I made was I sauteed the sliced cabbage and some of the leeks in bacon grease for flavor.  I also used my hand held blender to blend the leeks and milk together.  
I will definitely be making this again SOON!.

I used about 2.5 lbs potatoes and only 1 leek which was more than enough. I also added 4 or 5 strips of crisply fried and crumbled bacon.  Served with corned beef for St. Patty's day.  Thanks

This was a great recipe--the leeks taste great in it! I didn't use all of the green parts of the leeks because I was making this late at night for a potluck the next day and I didn't want to wait for the thick parts of the leeks to soften enough to be edible. I just added some extra cabbage instead and it was delicious! I'd recommend using big cracked pepper to season this.

Added this dish to my St. Patrick's Day dinner.  Loved by family and guests.  As suggested by someone else, I fried cabbage in bacon grease and garnished with bacon bits.  Also boiled potatoes and Leeks in milk.  Gave a much richer flavor.  Will make again.

I'm not sure if leeks are a different size in Ireland, but I picked two of the smallest they had at our grocery store and there was still about twice as much as should ever be in the recipe. Unless the Irish have a much stronger desire to taste onion than we do. Anyhow, aside from the almost overwhelmingly strong onion flavor from the leeks, it was quite tasty. We added some bacon and cheddar, of which I think the bacon really made it taste a lot better. And of course, cheese is always great.

Loved this. Made just as is. Served with black eyed peas for New Year's and Irish soda bread.  We loved the addition of the leeks. This was the first time my Irish hubby has had the dish and he's hooked!

Pleasantly surprised by this tasty recipe!  Never had Colcannon before so didn't know what to expect.  Super-easy to make and even my tobasco-loving / cabbage-hating husband liked it!  I used nutmeg, as others did, because I did not have mace.  I used 1/2 tsp and tasted perfect.  Also used green onions (about 4) as I couldn't find leeks, and was fine.  The butter really makes it in my opinion, so load it on!  Surprisingly filling.  Went excellent with thick homemade wheat bread & made a meal.

I only used 1 leek, and it took over 4 cups of milk to cover it to simmer.  I don't know if my leek was huge compared to the ones the recipe author used, but it was the same size as all the other ones in the grocery store. So, I had to waste a lot of milk by simmmering the leek in a ton of milk and then draining it off so the the end product wasn't a milk soup. Also, I think the recipe needs more than just a pinch of mace.

I make this a lot. I omit the mace, and purée the leeks with the milk. Lately I've been using half the amount of butter called for -- once I even forgot to put it in altogether, and it was still good.

This was very good. Had just returned from the hospital, was feeling tired so I used only things I had on hand. To make it easy I actually used instant mashed potatoes and a bag of shredded cabbage that I cooked until soft. Sauted some green onions in butter and mixed all together. Surprisingly delicious and fast.

Delish!  I used Yukon Golds so my potatoes weren't as fluffy but I loved the texture and the taste.  Was going to use onion so I didn't have to go out and buy leeks, but boy am I glad I made the extra effort, very tasty!

I had never made colcannon before.  It's delicious.  I did take some liberties with this recipe because my computer died before I could print out the recipe, so I was relying on my memory and tried to incorporate some of the suggestions previous reviewers made.  I sauteed the cabbage in about 2 Tbsp. butter with two slices of country bacon.  I added a heavy pinch of salt to the leek and milk mixture.  I pureed everything together quickly at the end in a food processor (be careful not to over mix, because this will make it a pasty consistency).  I only added about 1/4 cup of butter at the end, as well as salt to taste.  I also took the two slices of country bacon that I used to flavor the cabbage, cut them into a small dice and crisped them up in a frying pan and sprinkled them on top.  The flavors were deep, rich, sweet and salty.  It was wonderful.

Very very good.  I learned a lot about leeks today. Number one is to wash well-easier to chop first, then rinse the grit away. Some people won't go into the green at all, other use it all; others halfway, and still talked to another who uses it all but the top quarter of the leaves. I used halfway up the green only bc it seemed like a TON of leeks vs. cabbage/potato ratio, but after sauteeing the cabbage and leeks they reduced down quite a bit and the whole dish turned out wonderful.

I made this for our St.Patricks day dinner.
My son, who hates cabbage, loved this dish.
I really thought the flavors blended so well together.
I have been interested in trying something using Leeks. I was very pleased!

So, we didn't use real potatoes because I had some poor planning. We used potato pearls. Still, it wasn't bad. WE liked it quite a bit actually. I would add more cabbage and leeks next time because I didn't put in quite as much as the recipe called for. It was a hit for St. Patty's Day and we had fun with it.

This was surprisingly good.  I was a little nervous about putting cabage and potatoes together, but it works.  I simmered the cabbage  and leeks in milk and then put the milk and cabbbage in the blender and pureed it.  Then I added it to the mashed potatoes and it turned out as a green fluff.  I let everyone add the butter, salt and peper to taste.  I actually added salt to this for my portion, which almost never happens, and it really improved the taste.  My two-year-old liked her "green potatoes" and even her vegie-hating father ate seconds and said he could eat it atleast once a year. ;)

This is a good Irish recipe for any time of year, but goes over especially well in the winter.  It is hearty and filling with lots of fiber, too.  People that won't eat cabbage but will eat potatoes may even like this!

This was an easy recipe and it came out great.  I did make a couple changes tho - used      1/2 sweet onion which I softened in boiling water instead of the leeks and I didn't have mace so I used nutmeg.  It was a hit.

I made this recipe as is, and my family all agree that this is probably the best potato recipe I’ve ever tried.

I saw this recipe featured on St. Patty's Day and saved it. I had planned to make it with Corned Beef Brisket as a side, but didn't get around to making this until later. I substituted nutmeg for the mace since I didn't want to drive to the market. I loved the taste of the dish but seemed a little unfinished/unmelded. So, I took the leftovers, put them in a baking dish, mixed in a 1/2 c. heavy cream, additional nutmeg and baked it off in the oven at 300 for 45 minutes. Oh! Over the top goodness. Yum! The flavors of the leeks, potatoes and cabbage together along with the little bit of ground nutmeg was delicious, perfect comfort food. I will make this again and experiment with kale or sub in Napa cabbage. I really enjoyed Colcannon.

This recipe was VERY bland on it's own. Also, the proportions of milk are wrong. I used 1 c as directed in the recipe and my dish was almost soup. I have to added some cooked oatmeal to firm it up some. Also, I REALLY had to doctor it up to make it good. I added a pouch of white gravy mix, lots of nutmeg (in place of mace), and Bragg's Liquid Aminos (which is a flavoring for many things). It tasted decent after doctoring it up but it was a bit unsightly as a mashed mess. It wasn't worth the large number of dishes it required to prepare it.

Wonderful!  My family and I enjoyed it.  I followed others' advice to saute the cabbage and the leeks--and I cooked the potatoes in the microwave--all still turned out well.

Tried this recipe tonight and it was lovely. Never been able to get the family to eat more than a mouthful of savoy cabbage before but this time it all got eaten! I didn't add all the milk into the mashed potatoes only as much as was needed. Really enjoyed it and will use it again. Thanks for sharing it :)

I didn't add all the leeks or milk because it seemed too much.  Even with the milk I did add, it made the potatoes a little mushy.  But was better after the first day.  It was good, but I am not sure it was worth all that extra time "jazzing" up mashed potatoes!  Oh, and cook leeks first, then cook the potatoes & cabbage at the same time.

This dish is delicious.  I used leftover mashed potatoes so it cut down the preparation time.  I simply heated the mashed potatoes in the skillet and then added the cabbage.  There was no need for additional cream or milk.  We had it with pork chops.  I highly recommend this.

Like a number of other reviewers, I sauteed the cabbage and leeks in butter instead of boiling and simmering respectively.  Not only did the kids clean their plates, they asked for seconds. Thanks for the recipe!!!

good way to hide veggies in your mashed potatoes i guess... but otherwise tastes like mashed potatoes with a lot more work.
i didn't hvae leeks so used three big green onions.  sauteed in butter and garlic before mixing in.  used salad savoy because that's what i had.  nice color and will eat, but... not sure what this adds?

This was very good.  We increased the portions and did about 2 lbs. cabbage to 5lbs. potatoes.  Blended them until smooth & creamy, & topped them with crumbled bacon bits.  I'm not a huge cabbage fan, but this was a great way to have it.  Served it with cherry smoked bangers (Bratwursts), shepherd's pie, and corned beef.  It fills you up fast!!

I just finished cooking this and the taste is fine but it is quite runny. I went with the exact messurements and weight but it seems to be too much milk. Next time I'll add 1-2 more potatoes or less milk. Other then that it very tasty.

I loved this! I didn't follow the measurements exactly, I just simmered some cabbage and leeks in milk and seasonings and then later when I made the mashed potatoes I took the greens out of the fridge and mixed them in. So good! A huge hit! :)

This was my first time trying colcannon so I have nothing to compare it to, but I thought it was really good. I was concerned that the milk didn't cover the leeks at all, but once they started to cook down it was definately enough.  The cabbage took a lot longer to cook than I thought so next time I would start that earlier.  It was just as good reheated the next day in the microwave too.

I really liked this.  I love having the substance of mashed potatoes w/ the health of the greens.  Obvious, not a health food but feels a little better than a big pile of potatoes and butter!

Just okay. Like others I substituted nutmeg for mace but I didn't care for the flavor. Next time I'll either buy some mace or just skip over that ingredient.

As suggested by others, I used Nutmeg instead of the mace and Kale instead of cabbage.  Trust me.... the end result was exactly as I remember my now departed grandmother's colcannon.  Our relatives from Mitchelstown,County Cork, Ireland would be proud of such a faithful rendition of an Irish classic.

Delicious...I looked at several recipes and decided this looked best for what I had on hand.  I had less potatoes than called for and also added a bit of nutmeg but boy was this great!  I also didn't have the onion so used some chopped green onion toward the end of the cooking.  My first time to try colcannon...and...definitely going to be making this again.  Thank you for a keeper!

I do not like cabbage so I was thrilled to find this recipe - I loved it! It's a nice way to sneak in some extra veggies.  De-lish!

Just finished making and eating this.  And let me say, this stuff tastes WAY better than I thought it would!  Even my picky, cornbread raised, hot sauce lovin' husband liked it... and he DEFINITELY doesn't like this kind of stuff.  The only things I did different was saute the leeks in some of the butter first, cut the butter down by half, and used nutmeg instead of mace like another reviewer suggested (couldn't find mace anywhere).  Usually the recipes on this site are a hit or miss with me, and this colcannon is most certainly a HIT.  Love it! Can't wait to make it again!

Served this for St.Patty;s day and what a hit it was!! I used onions because I had no leeks. I also added 1 bunch of kale. I cooked the kale seperately,chopped it up and stirred it in last,I do not know if it would have tinted the dish green and I liked the look of it being white with green spottes. I also used a whole head of cabbage. This was awesome

Outstanding!  I was a bit skeptical, as I am a mashed potato "purist" - it was awesome:  Kids loved it, husband loved it, and I will definately make it again, even though it required multiple pans.  I will just negotiate that someone else has to wash the dishes!  LOVED THIS!

I've never had Colcannon before, but I must say that this turned out pretty awesome! Followed another reviewer's suggestion and used nutmeg instead of mace. Also, I sautéed green onion (in place of leek) in butter before adding the milk. I let it simmer for a few minutes, so that the onion was slightly crunchy when everything was mixed together. Yummy!

I made this for my St. Patick's Day party. I doubled the recipe. When I added the 2 cups of milk (doubled from the 1 cup suggested for the normal recipe), my spuds were floating in a soup. I ended up tripling the suggested amount of potatoes to dilute out the milk. The recipe should be changed to account for this.

This was an ok recipe.  It was pretty bland though.  I added some sour cream to supplement the flavor.  It was really good with the corned beef roast.

Recipes was easy and delicious!  I sauted my cabbage and leeks in a little olive oil while the potatoes boiled.  Added all ingredients when I mashed with milk and butter.  Enjoyed this, something different.  Like the leeks in this, didn't overpower the potatoes and cabbage.

Delicious! I didn't measure, I just eye-balled stuff.  I used 5 red potatoes, unpeeled and cut up into small chunks, 1 leek, and about 2/3 of a head of cabbage, chopped. I boiled the potatoes, and sauteed the cabbage with some olive oil and some water until it was soft.  I mixed the drained potatoes and the leeks, and roughly mashed them together with a potato masher, leaving some chunks of potato before I added the cabbage.  I only added about 3 T. of butter, and plenty of salt and pepper.  I forgot the mace, but it was still great. I'll add it next time I make this recipe, as I will definitely have it again. I served it with roasted chicken on a cold, rainy day and it was perfect comfort food.

Chopped the cabbage and leeks and boiled together.  Boiled potatoes, drained and mashed with the milk and butter in the same pan.  Used a few shakes of nutmeg instead of mace and plenty of pepper. Drained the cabbage and leeks and added to the potatoes with more butter.  Everyone liked these and will make it again.  Will be a good recipe to have to try with kale too.

Well, I thought it was just a little bland, even after I added some garlic powder to it. I did like the mace though. I have never used it in my cooking before, so, it was good experimentation. I think this recipe could be good...I just need to tweek it a bit to suit our tastes better. It's a good starting point! Thanks!

traditional colcannon uses kale rather than cabbage...try substituting and you'll be pleasantly suprised on how much better the dish will taste.

This recipe was a bit of a mess to make but tasted good. It is not a very pretty dish for presentation, but then again it is supposed to represent traditional country food-filling and nutritious. Will stick to your ribs!

Okay, so I changed this recipe quite a bit... but oh my GOSH was it good! I didn't have mace or leeks... and wasn't about to run to the store. So I used potatoes, sauerkraut (1 can), green onions (1 bunch, chopped), butter (3/4 cup) and cream (about 3/4 cup). (I never use cream, but I had it from something else, and didn't want it to go bad...) I made this for a combination St. Patrick's Day/Birthday dinner for my mother, with BBQ pork ribs and corn casserole. It was absolutely fabulous, definitely 5 stars! I love the extra flavor that the sauerkraut provided, my whole family loved it too - even my 19 month old!

Very good!  I added a few chunks of cream cheese for extra creaminess, but would have used sour cream if it had been on hand.  Yum yum.

I cut the recipe in half but didn't calculate my measurements correctly so my potatoes were not fluffy (I added too much milk).  I was apprehensive as the milk curdled when I cooked the leeks... I am not sure if this was supposed to happen...  Regardless, this dish was delicious!

I love cabbage and potatoes, so I love making a big deal out of this for any reason, even St. Paddy’s Day!  I start by cooking bacon, when that is almost done, I toss in cut up beef smokies and add my cut cabbage chunks.  Then mix with lumpy mashed potatoes on the plate.  So good!!  Love this!!!

If I ever make this again, I would add chopped garlic and onion. Without it, it was kind of bland.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I had three leeks instead of two. By coincidence I had Irish butter in the fridge, which added extra richness. I always wanted to try this dish and finally made it today. So delectable! I thought it would be heavy and strongly flavored, but the three veggies blended into a delicate purée. Neither my vegetable-shy husband nor I stopped at one helping. I served it with chicken sausage and corn on the cob. Very satisfying.

My husband and I loved Colcannon.  We made it together, he did the potatoes and I did the cabbage and onions.  It was a perfect St. Paddy's day dish.  Will definitely use it again, not only on St Paddy's day.

My dinner guests for St. Patrick's Day were two lovely old ladies and a younger man. Everyone had seconds of the colcannon. I cooked the cabbage and leaks in butter and heavy cream.  I'm going to make this every year and start a tradition.

I love Colcannon and it's one of my favorite comfort foods. This was my first recipe for it many years ago. The only things I do differently (and to each their own)-I steam the cabbage vs. boiling it  and use green onions instead of leeks. Heavy cream in lieu of the milk tends to make it fluffier and give a richer flavor. I agree with others that there's never too much butter for potatoes!  Thank you for the recipe!

I cut the leeks down to 1 as it seemed like way too much, glad I did. I did use the other ingredients as stated, but when I got to the end it was pretty thin so I ended up adding close to another pound of potatoes and it definitely improved it for my taste. I also did boil the cabbage a bit til it was soft then sauteed it in butter.

I will definitely will be making these again!! So delicious, warm or cold!

Everyone loved it from the ages of 14 to 70.  I doubled the recipe, since I was feeding 9 people and wanted leftovers.  Wonderful and delicious side dish.  Yummmm.

Don't change a thing in the recipe, serve with "Braised Corned Beef Brisket" (also on Allrecipes) and you will sit down to one of the best meals you've ever had.

Always wanted to try this, and this is a simple, great recipe.  I used a can of Carnation milk, and a teaspoon of nutmeg instead of the mace.  Great side dish with little ham.  Husband loves it.  Will make again.

I make something very similar that I used to eat when I stayed with Irish grandparents, who were on a limited budget. Boil cabbage and potatoes (separately) Mash potatoes on plate and add some cabbage.  Cut all up together add butter, salt and pepper and vinegar to taste. So good, cheap and easy.

I stumbled onto Colcannon because I had leftover leeks, cabbage and kale from a soup I made, and needed something to do with them.  I can't believe just how unbelievably good this was, even though I had very high hopes.  I don't usually cook with butter, so maybe it was the 1/2 cup that did it :)   I also used fresh ground nutmeg rather than mace. 

I sauteed half cabbage (2 cups) and half kale (2 cups) in the butter, and simmered the leeks (2 med. was about 4 cups of leeks chopped) in the milk.  AMAZING!!!!!  I'm pretty sure I used more than 1 lb. of potatoes though, and I'm so glad I did.  I will be sorry when the last of it is gone!  The tastiest "comfort" food in the world, and (other than the butter) very nutritious!

I was looking for a different way to serve potatoes with my St. Patty's day corned beef dinner and selected this recipe.  The primary change that I made was to saute the chopped cabbage and leeks  in some butter before adding it to the mashed potatoes.  I boiled some Yukon gold organic potatoes then mashed them with some butter and whole milk, then seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.  The addition of the leeks and cabbage to the dish made for a perfect pairing with the rest of the corned beef dinner.   I used the leftovers to make corned beef hash pancakes by combining some of the left over corned beef, the colcannon and green onion and sauteed the cakes in some coconut oil.  I served them topped with a poached egg for a delicious and hardy breakfast!

So good! Easy to make, definite comfort food. I did as a couple other readers did and sauteed the cabbage, leeks, and added kale as well for extra color. Will definitely make this again. Thanks :)

Excellent. First time making or eating this dish. I chose to roast the cabbage as one would brussels sprouts, for the flavor. Sauté would work well also. Will make again.

Really good.  I followed other's suggestions and sautéed the cabbage and onions in butter.  Actually, I crisped up some bacon, added butter and then added the cabbage and onions, then the garlic.  The potatoes were excellent!!

I tried this, but as a last-minute addition to a meal, and had to make several modifications. I had no cabbage, but used Brussels Sprouts; I also ran out of milk, so the leeks were simply boiled in water. Still came out very tasty - I plan on trying this more in keeping with the recipe to compare!

Wow - mashed potatoes times 10. I took some of the reviewers' suggestions and fried up my cabbage in bacon grease, and then added the crumbled bacon in at the end. This was SO good.

Unique and delicious. However, it did not turn any shade of green. I sautéed the cabbage and some onion adding kale at the end for more color.

I made this exactly as described, with a touch more potatoes, and it is delicious!  Looking forward to sharing with friends tonight. I processed the leeks/milk and cabbage, so we have what looks like green mashed potatoes but tastes so much better. Great recipe! Thanks!

Made it for St. Pat's day for something different than the traditional boiled potatoes and cabbage. Really tasty. I forgot to add the mace/nutmeg. Have to remember that next time. Maybe use a little less of the leeks. My teenaged son gave it a thumbs up. Will definitely make again.

I tried this yummy recipe yesterday. I used my leftover cabbage and potatoes from Sunday's corned beef meal. It was an excellent side to have with the last bit of leftover corned beef. To avoid a trip to the store, I used a small onion in place of the leeks. I will definitely try it with the leeks at some point. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have to admit that I didn't follow the recipe exactly (didn't bother much with the right quantities as usual).  I wanted something more Irish than regular mashed potatoes to go with the Irish Stout Stew that I made for St. Patty's Day.  This is quite possibly the most delicious version of mashed potatoes that I have ever had.  YUM!!

Outstanding recipe. I added a half cup of Irish cheese and holy cow! This is currently being served at St. Patrick's Day dinner tonight. Thanks for a great recipe.

Love this recipe!  I never would have thought of putting these ingredients together, but it is now my favorite! My kids don't "Love" it, but they tolerate it.

I am Irish by marriage and I made this for my husband instead of plain boiled potatoes and cabbage to go with our corned beef.  In a word, AWESOME!!  I too sauteed my veggies and steamed my potatoes and everyone in the family loved it.  This may not end up being just at St. Patrick's day special in our house.

This did not inspire.  It was bland and I kept wishing I was just eating mashed potatoes instead.

My husband and I both love this dish.  I even impressed my Irish mother-in-law when I made it for dinner at her house one evening.

This was a big hit at our dinner table. When my 3 and 2 year old boys were asking for seconds and thirds I knew we had a winner. Deffinately a keeper.

This is a good recipe.  I sauted the cabbage and leeks in the butter, then mashed the potatoes with the milk.  I thought it was bland, then again I think all Irish food is bland.  My wife loved it thou, so I guess it's a keeper.

Made it as a side for St. Patrick's Day dinner. The potatoes, cabbage and leeks blended together wonderfully. An easy and very forgiving recipe. Will definitley make again!
