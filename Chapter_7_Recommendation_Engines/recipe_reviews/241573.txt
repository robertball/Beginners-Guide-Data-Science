I made these today for a BBQ & they were devoured.  I added a few drops of liquid smoke which really added a depth of flavor.  I will definitely make these again.

Theses were great. I doubled the recipe and added a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar.

These were devoured so quickly I wish I had made more! I had some really good quality smoked paprika and it was wonderful in these eggs! My nephew and my son-in-law both agreed these were way better than regular deviled eggs. A new favorite at our house!

I added a dash of vinegar but other than this addition I followed the recipe.  Everyone enjoyed them and I am glad that I had made extras.  They all went too fast,

Good but next time I'll try adding a little vinegar to make them a bit tangier.  Round 2: better but too salty. Cut down on the salt and keep the vinegar for round 3.
