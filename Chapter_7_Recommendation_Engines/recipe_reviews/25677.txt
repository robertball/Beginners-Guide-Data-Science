This was amazing... I doubled the recipe and placed in the crock pot instead of cooking it on the stove.. I cooked it on high for 4 hours... frying the kielbasa first. *** I made this the 2nd time, this time using low sodium broth, and low fat kielbasa... I also added sliced carrots and cubed turnips. It turned out perfect!

This recipe as it is written is very good, very easy and very quick!  I love the salty and sweet combination!  I do not think that the added salt is necessary, as kielbasa, beef broth and butter all contain salt.

I have made this recipe and variations of it several times.  To make it a bit more healthful, I now omit the butter and simply saute the kielbasa with the onion and then drain off the excess fat.  I also omit the salt and the sour cream.  It is just as yummy and I do not feel guilty eating it!

To tonight's variation I added about 2 c. more cabbage, 1 c. frozen corn, 1 1/2 c. frozen cooked great northern beans (I buy dry beans, then cook and freeze them for later use), 2 medium potatoes, cubed.  The beans and potatoes cook down enough to thicken the broth a bit.  I served it with homemade garlic toast.  DElicious!

I made the garlic toast using leftover crusty bread slices which I buttered with a mixture of 4 T. softened butter mixed with 2 large cloves of garlic, minced.  Placed them on a baking sheet under the broiler at high temp for about 2-3 minutes.  Keep your eye on them or you'll have garlic toast flambe!

I tried this recipe and it turned out really good. It was quick, but I made it my crockpot and let it cook for about 6 hours. Next time I may add potatoes to give it added flavor.

Very good but I think next time I'll use a can of tomato sauce and a can of diced or crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato soup.

We're not big cabbage eaters but when I bought a giant bag of cole slaw from Costco, I needed to use it up! My husband requests this and my picky 13 year old likes it too! Us girls like it with sour cream, my husband without. I use turkey sausage just to cut the fat content. Great for chilly fall weather!

I've got several variations of this recipe, and they are all GREAT! They are so quick and easy to prepare, cheap, nutritious, and you can add whever veggies you have on hand (I usually add a small diced potato and sometimes sliced zucchini). This stew works well with kielbasa, brats or Italian sausage. I use canned tomato sauce instead of tomato soup as I find the soup too sweet. I also add a little garlic powder. This recipe is SO versatile! Thanks, Jo!

I like lots of sausage chunks so I used 2 lbs, don't care for beef broth so I substituted chicken and I threw in some cajun spice seasoning.  Yummy!  Hubby ate it all up and I had nothing left for lunch the next day *sigh*.

My family loved this recipe.  I sauteed the kielbasa in olive oil, instead of butter.  Also added a can of Great Northern Beans (undrained) and a handful of fresh spinach leaves.  My husband said this was a "keeper."

This soup turns out rather salty.  I would either omit the salt or not put in the beef broth.  Other than that, it was delicious.

YUM! I absolutely LOVE this recipe. So simple, and low in calories, (and cheap by the way) yet very hearty and flavorful. I typically use turkey kielbasa and light sour cream to make it a little healthier, you would never know the difference! I also add a couple of cloves of garlic (BIG garlic lover here) and several small red potatoes. Give it a try on a cold night and serve with rolls to sop up every last drop! Thanks so much for the recipe, I'll be making this for years to come!

This stew was incredible. I doubled the recipe and added extra kielbasa. I used 1.5 pounds mild kielbasa cut into 1 inch pieces and 1 pound spicy kielbasa removed from the casing. I sauteed the kielbasa in olive oil and butter. Rather than using 2 cans of tomato soup, I substituted a can for tomato sauce. I also added a can of Italian style tomatoes.  I added two red potatoes, skinned and cubed as well as 4 chopped carrots. I did not add the salt the recipe called for. In addition to the ground black pepper, I added ground cumin and ground cayenne red pepper to taste. The stew reduced quite a bit and the sour cream was a nice touch. The only change I will make next time is to add some corn as I'm not sure it can get much better!

This recipe is solid as is, not knock your socks off delicious but good enough to keep in your soup recipe folder. I did not try with sour cream; just had it plain.

I tried this recipe and adjusted three things:  I used a bag of coleslaw blend cabbage, used Turkey Kielbasa and added 6 chopped red skin potatoes.  Let me tell you-----BIG HIT!  It is very easy to remember the ingredients due to very few ingredients but this is a definate do over and make again....PS - Left overs are even better, the second and third day.  Im jumping for joy on this one

This is absolutely fantastic! Not everyone likes boiled cabbage but if you like it with corned beef- try this you wont be disappointed! Try adding half kielbasa and half hot links- didn't even add sour cream and the cabbage kept it pretty mellow(I do like things on the spicy side though) Try this, it's great, I will definitely make again and again! :)

I have never given a 1 star review, but this was horrific. Neither my husband nor myself could eat more than a bite. I have never made a soup with so much cooked cabbage, although I typically like cabbage in moderation. But this was just disgusting. The flavor was strangely sweet, and the texture like mush. I will never make anything even remotely resembling this again. AVOID unless you absolutely love masses of cooked cabbage.

I love this recipe!  I found it when my husband and I were doing low carb AND I had been given a bunch of cabbage from a friend.  I'm not a big fan of cabbage, but this recipe makes it delicious.  We used spicy Italian turkey sausage, great alternative to keilbasa.  And we didn't use the sour cream because we didn't have any.  I don't think it took away from the recipe at all without it.  The cabbage reminds me of noodles, so I was in love.  Interesting flavor at first, but it grew on us so quickly and it's now a family favorite.  And, it's super easy!  Thank you!

Excellent dish! I used light butter and fat free sour cream to reduce calories. Used a bag of cole slaw mix in lieu of cabbage only. Also added leftover brown rice. Highly recommend.

This is absolutely ridiculous. Everything cooked down into this silky delicious soup with great flavor. The dollop of sour cream is a nice touch too. Will certainly make this again.

I made a few alterations to the recipe. First, I added tomato paste to the mixture (the tomato soup seemed rather bland by itself, the paste made it more hearty), also I added diced carrots to the stew. (Most Polish dishes have carrots - I was surprised this recipe did not call for them.) Finally, the recipe made no mention of any side-dish, I chose to pair this stew with another traditional Polish staple - mashed potatoes. I skipped the sour cream this time around - but will give it a try next time. Overall, this dish was quite simple to make - certainly got rave reviews from my husband. I will make this stew again.

Forgive me for giving a review on an altered recipe, but I thought I had tomato soup when I started preparing this recipe.  When I found that I did not have the tomatoe soup, I substituted a can of diced tomatoes, a TBS of Heinz 57, and three cloves of home-roasted garlic.  The Stew was great!  I still want to try it with the canned tomatoe soup.  I originally picked this recipe because my husband is currently on stage I of the Atkins diet.  Although, he normally does not like cabbage, unless it is on a reuben, he thought this was really good!  It is also good as left-overs!  I really enjoyed this as well. The kielbasa adds a unique flavor without adding too much fat!  Although, I have to admit, adding the sour cream really improves the already good flavor.  Try it! You'll like it.  Note: adding the diced tomatoes in place of the canned soup, did increase the fiber content.
I agree, with several reviewers that this is more of a soup than a stew as far as texture goes.

I love this recipe but due to high blood pressure I'm always looking for ways to lower the sodium. So I make this almost as listed except I use low sodium kielbasa, low sodium beef broth, 2 large cans of diced tomatoes, and the only seasoning I add is cajun seasoning for flavor. I also add garlic. I omit the water and use enough of the broth to go to the top of the crockpot. I always use 2 links of the sausage and to make it easier I use a bag of Cole slaw mix that includes carrots.

Considering the ingredients, I had my doubts about this recipe. My doubts were demolished and so was this stoup! It smelled amazing!
I read just about every review on this recipe and considering my tastes and all, I changed just a little to try and healthy it up a little more.... by that I mean... I didn't use butter, the kielbasa is greasy enough in my opinion. I used reduced-sodium broth and didn't add any salt. Instead of just cabbage.... I used an entire bag of tricolor coleslaw mix because it needed to be used desperately or I would have had to throw it out. So using that it added carrots and purple cabbage to the mix... YUM!
Some reviewers said they liked it better without the sour cream... so I served it as an option, a dollop or not, it was their choice. I preferred it with and so did everyone in my family but one.
I would totally make this again. Not only was it scrumptious, it was pretty budget friendly and not to mention... speedy/minimal prep!

Very good recipe overall. I added a can of diced tomatoes and a tsp. of Franks hot sauce for some extra spice. I also topped it off with a little extra sour cream and some fresh chives. Family loved it.

Excellent, my husband especially loved this. The only change I made was to use tomato sauce & and can of dice tomatoes in place of the tomato soup (didn't have any and my husband loves diced tomatoes in stew). And I added minced garlic :)

Fantastic, even my picky eaters loved it.  I added 1 diced sweet potatoe, 1 diced Idaho potatoe and 1 can white beans.

I used a whole cabbage (little over medium), smoked turkey sausage, omitted the sour cream (I didn't have any), added a few shakes of Worcestire, and I used green, red, and yellow bell pepper.  It was absolutely delish!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe, sal!

Awesome recipe!! My husband and I absolutely loved it. I changed this recipe around a bit to use some extra veggies and I did not have green peppers. I also used tomato souce instead of tomato soup with some veggie stock. I also used some octoberfest sausage and some extra roast beef instead of the kielbasa. It still turned out awesome. I had let the soup sit for a couple of hours before we ate it for supper to let the flavours blend.

Well Jo, after only one single bite of this stew, hubby declared this a ten star recipe! He LOVED it and so did the kids! I used only broth and no water, tomato sauce in lieu of the soup and added leftover potatoes, which I cubed and a package of spinach. Drew bought two kielbasa links from our local German butcher and this was the perfect way to incorporate the sausage into a really good meal. Thank you so very much!!!!

This was pretty good. I put it in a crockpot.I didn't have tomato soup on hand so I did as some other reviewers did and used diced tomatoes. I also added a beef boullin cube for a little extra flavor.

This was easy and delicious - except I would call it a soup rather than stew. Following other reviewers suggestions I only used one cup of water and it still was very thin - had to use a spoon to eat it. I did use the tomato soup and some said they believed that it made it a bit sweet.  I agree - I added some hot sauce to counteract that.  I would make this a day in advance because like most stews it only gets better. Thanks submitter.

When it comes to cooking, I'm usually limited to the microwave. I did not have the confidence to change this recipe so I followed it exactly. It was amazing. Really easy and really great tasting. This was a great first step in learning to cook and I'm extremely grateful. This recipe is what got me to make an account on this app just so I can talk about how amazing this tastes. Thank you!

Just made this and it is very very good!  I tweaked it just a bit , used tomato sauce instead of soup,  chicken broth was all I had,  a lil  thyme and a bay leaf, cumin and cayenne pepper, extra broth no water,  and a handful of celery that needed to get used, skipped the sour cream and it was still excellent!!! the house smells amazing and  I bowled some up to take a pic and taste test, SMH I ate it all before I took the pic!!  Lol so I just took a pic of the pot!!  ENJOY

This is one of my families favorite recipes. I always have to make a double batch along with a big pot of mashed potatoes so they can sop up the juice. The only thing I changed was adding a slurry of corn starch to thicken the broth prior to adding the sour cream. So simple and easy.

Very tasty!  Made a few changes based on what I had on hand and still turned out great.   I used kale instead of cabbage, red bell pepper instead of green, and red onion- made it very colorful.  Also at the end I added two cans of cannellini beans.

I customized this with V8 in place of tomato soup and added a can of diced fire grilled tomatoes and green chilis. This is an amazing stew! I don't like to eat left-overs, but had to eat this everyday until it was gone and was craving more. I WILL make it again!!

This was, for me, a basic stone soup recipe.  I had to add so many other things (beans, carrots, tomatoes, tomato paste, hot sauce, thyme, garlic) to give it flavor and turn it into a wonderful flavorful stew.

This was very tasty, however I admit to altering it just a little. I didn't want the sweetness of tomato soup so I used a can of fire roasted chopped tomatoes. I did not add any additional salt and this was plenty salty, definitely use low sodium broth. Also I added a little garlic powder and instead of plain sour cream I used jalapeno sour cream. YUM!

Well, I had high hopes- I thought this dish was fine, but my husband thought it was too salty (I even cut down salt a bit) and way to acidic, even with the sour cream.  The reason it got three stars and not one is because I thought it was decent.

Used Pablano pepper instead of Green. Used the tomatoe sauce rather than soup. used smoked sausage and would have rather had something a bit more spicy. Added turnips and carrots to round out the flavor. This recipe is an excellent pallet to draw on.

I'm going to give this recipe 5 stars for giving me the idea to create my own version of Kielbasa Stew, because you can substitute whatever you prefer, I made these changes to suit our taste, I first sautéed the cabbage in butter, extra virgin olive oil and caraway seeds, I used a large can of diced tomatoes for the liquid, I omitted the onions and added some garlic, then I added spices to our taste, if you make sure all your product have no sugar in them your recipe will be acceptable for a high protein diet.  I kept the green peppers in, and the sour cream was a very nice touch.

This recipe is awesome!!!!!  Even my kids (ages 5 and 3) loved it, cabbage and all.  Since my husband likes stews with tomato chunks, I also added a can of stewed tomatoes to the recipe.  The sour cream adds just the right finishing touch (I added about 1/2 cup, though).

This is Yummy!  I ended up with 5 quarts by adding about 2 cups of chunky potato cubes.  Low boil for about 2.5 hours to cook the potatoes; add a little more water.  Corn bread muffins added a nice touch.  Perfect for Fall and Winter!

This was very easy / tasty / filling!  I used a mix of tomato soup and canned tomatoes with garlic and beef broth (rather than adding any water).  I also added sautéed mushrooms as a garnish, which added nicely to the flavor.  Served it with crusty bread and over mashed potatoes, both of which worked well with the stew.

Loved this!!  I did add extra Kielbasa (total 2 lbs), substituted baby carrots for the green pepper and omitted the sour cream; just a matter of personal preference.

Really good!  I didn't have a green pepper, so I used celery.  I would give it five starts, but I didn't care for the sour cream at the end. Next time I'll leave it out.

This is a great winter meal.  I did not use butter to sauté the sausage, onions and bell pepper, as the sausage had plenty of drippings.  My can of tomato soup was the family size one, which worked fine.  Did not have a can of broth so used 1 1/2 cups of water with a bouillon cube as sub.  Added 2 cans of drained ranch style beans.  Cooked in slow oven till ready to cook cornbread to go along with it, and removed from oven to simmer when adding the shredded cabbage.   Did not add salt but did put pepper when sautéing the sausage.   Yummy, really hit the spot.  Thanks for sharing

Excellent! Made modifications to suit our tastes but, all in all, a wonderful Midwestern winter fare.  Agree that sodium level is high & the addition of potatoes assists with that.  Also love colors, so carrots were a plus in addition to the Northern beans and home canned tomatoes.  Thank you for a great way to use up the extra cabbage from a Cabbage Roll marathon! (We make freezer meals & end up with surplus).

This was a good recipe.  I substituted turkey kielbasa for the pork.  I ate the whole pot over a couple of days and took it to work.  It goes great with a Jiffy cornbread muffin.  I think I will leave out the salt next time.  Generally, it was a solid, quick filling meal.

I was really surprised by how much I liked this recipe. Like others, I omitted the salt, added 1/4-1/2 tsp garlic powder and I used Amy's Cream of Tomato Soup. Very yummy and the cabbage wasn't weird at all. Definitely a keeper since it is delicious and super easy.

I double the sausage. Used tomato sauce instead if the tomato soup, it was all I had on hand. Turned out great! Tasted better the next day after the flavones meld.

Followed as closely to the letter as my pantry allowed, but I had to use beef base and water.  Reading the reviews, I think more would be better--more veggies, that is.  Although it is supposed to be a stew, I am going to chop the sausage smaller next time.  I also think ham base could be fun.

This was great!  The only changes I made were to keep the cabbage in small chunks and add cubed potatoes to make it a complete meal.  I always use low salt broth when cooking so I can control the added salt.

This was a spur of the moment dish for me to make last night. I had a huge bag of coleslaw the husband bought at the wholesale store I needed to use up. I had pretty much everything to make this in stock except the beef broth, so used my homemade chicken broth. I simmered the kielbasa with the onions and drained off the fat, there was quite a bit of it. I also liked the idea of adding in celery and diced canned tomatoes as other reviews suggested, and so glad I did since they perked the flavor up. I wanted some pasta in mine and towards the last ten minutes of simmering I threw in a cup of elbow noodles. We are not really big fans of cooked cabbage, but we all really liked this. Just topped with a dollop of sour cream and green onions for the husband and son, but I ate mine without the sour cream. I'll make this again, but will add in a bit more spices than just salt and pepper, certainly some garlic.

Geat recipe!  I was surprised that my kids liked it so much since it has cabbage but they loved it!  I used a crock pot; browned the kielbasa first and threw everything else in to cook for 6 hrs on low.  Based upon other recommendations, I added 3 chopped potatoes and 1 large chopped tomato.  Very delicious.  Next time, I will double the recipe and freeze the extra.

At first I thought I'd double the amount of kielbasa (since our family loves our meats), but after putting in the water, tomato soup, and broth - I realized why the recipe only called for 1lb of it. So I decided to double the recipe - leave out the salt (since the sausage and broth already had so much of it) - added 5 medium sized russet potatoes - added about a tablespoon of cumin - and a dash of louisiana hot sauce... and as an end result, Absolutely Delicious!!!
Can't wait to have more for dinner tomorrow ^_^ !!!

I never made stew like this before. Always the beef, chili type. But wow, I loved it so much that I had more helpings then had it for breakfast and lunch the next day. They tasted even more flavorful the next day. I must make it again.

Simple to prep, delicious and nutritious.  I used Jennie-O turkey kielbasa, low-sodium canned soups, and served over pierogies.  Plenty of leftovers for lunches.   Will definitely make again.

This was good but not remarkable. I omitted the tomato soup and used canned tomatoes instead. I also added some soup base instead of salt for extra richness.

Needed a recipe to use up leftover sausage and cabbage from a cookout.  This more than fit the bill.  Even better as leftovers the next day.

This soup would be fabulous, just as written, but I changed it up a little to make it healthier.  I used a little olive oil to saute my veggies, then added turkey kielbasa.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Very very good!

The flavor was a bit off...Im not really sure what it was..maybe the tomato soup?? I really liked the way the cabbage turned out but something was wrong with the sauce. I'll try this again but use the suggested tomato sauce instead of the soup.

Very good, loved the sweet tomato taste. I browned the kielbasa first, then threw everything in the crockpot. I added potatoes and a can of fire roasted tomatoes too (makes everything taste better!) Omitted the salt from reviews and let my family add salt as they pleased to their own bowl. Needs a couple more cups of cabbage, I didn't know I would like cabbage so much but this dish made me want more and more cabbage so 3 cups didn't last as long as the rest of the stew. I used some other seasonings too, just whatever feels right. I didn't stir the sour cream in, just put garnished bowls with it. Or shredded cheese. Serve with garlic bread!! Yummy!

This is very good, healthy and versatile.  I omitted the salt and used lowfat ingredients where possible.  Added 1 can drained northern beans and one can drained whole grean beans. Served it with hot dinner rolls to sop up the flavorful broth...yum!

I love this stew!  It is so delicious.  I forgot to add the sour cream...bummer!  I only made this because I had all the stuff.  I was thinking that I would be the only one who would eat it but my kids actually really loved it.  A big surprise but a nice one!

Very good recipe.  All the picky eaters in my house liked it.  I used a banana pepper instead of a green pepper, just because I like them better.  I also added oregano and a bay leaf.  I couldn't imagine what the sour cream would do for this soup, but it was really good.  Will definitely make it again, probably with tomato sauce instead of the soup.

Things I changed:  I used tomato sauce instead of soup, low sodium chicken broth instead of beef, did not add any extra salt, used turkey kielbasa.  I also added in a can of corn and a can great northern beans (I don't know how much substance the soup would have had without them, but they were great in it!)  I also doubled it to freeze half after I made it the first time!  It is my new favorite soup!

This was ok. I expected it to be much better. Very salty, and I omitted the added salt. Canned diced tomatoes would be a good addition.

I love this soup and I make it often. I use low-fat sausage to cut the fat and I can't taste a difference. It's fantastic served with a spoonful of low-fat sour cream on top.

I was hesitant about trying this recipe because I didn't think my kids would go for it, but since we had two big heads from a pick-your-own farm that I didn't want to see go to waste, I went for it - and was very pleasantly surprised. Unlike some others, I did go ahead and use the tomato soup, but no recipe gets left untouched ... I did add some diced potatoes (we also have a lot of THOSE from the pick-your-own farm) and added some more broth to compensate for added veggie volume. Mu husband absolutely raved, kids didn't rave but didn't complain. And boy - is it filling!

Honestly, this was waaaaay better than I thought it would be.  I didn't make any modifications and didn't have any leftovers.  I do like the suggestion of adding the beans, so I think I'll try  that next time.  Great recipe!

A big hit!  Even with my non-cabbage fans.  I basically made the recipe exactly as is but subbed turkey kielbasa and chicken broth for the red meat, used (Trader Joe's) roasted red pepper and tomato soup and forgot all about the sour cream (which would probably have only made it better)!  A great recipe that is healthy, simple and yummy!

Hubby and I did not care for this recipe at all. I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because I used turkey kielbasa and left out the sour cream.  Maybe the recipe without my changes is better, but I won't bother trying it again to find out.

Great dish!  Instead of tomato soup, I used a small can of tomato paste, and added some more broth.  I also threw in some potatoes, green beans, and pearl onions.

I browned the turkey kielbasa in beef broth with onions. Added red and green pepper, mushrooms, can of diced tomatoes, and a bag of coleslaw. I also added garlic, red pepper and a dash of hot sauce. Turned out great, my boyfriend LOVED it!

This has so much potential as a very healthy recipe.  I followed suggestions and added frozen corn, navy beans, 2 potatoes, and extra cabbage.  I also added canned tomatoes instead of using tomato soup and omitted salt.  The acidity of the tomatoes and the sausage make salt omission possible.  I prefer this without sour cream (doesn't really add anything extra to the dish).

This recipe was fantastic. I did modify  (recipes are only guidepost) I didn't add bell pepper or salt and I did add garlic and chipotle pepper powder (anyone who lilkes spicy foods should get that. It's a smooth, spicy addition to anything. I had some doubts going into it, but yum,yum! Five stars all the way.

This was really good.  Instead of adding water I added a bottle of beer to the soup.  It kicked the soup up a bit.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yum!  I bought smoked turkey kielbasa sausage and made beef broth from cubes (cheaper).  This was really, really tasty and filling.  I was afraid it would be too liquidy but it reduced very nicely during the 45 minute simmering time.  Pretty easy and straightforward to make.

I thoroughly enjoyed this hearty take on a traditional cabbage stew! The green peppers, onions, and kielbasa were great. The stew reduced well and the broth with tomato and sour cream was yummy! I can't wait to make this recipe again. My husband loved it.

Ok, one of my peeves with this website is that people review things and make so many changes that the origional recipe is lost...even so. I thought this sounded really good, but my son doesnt eat tomatoes, so I used a can of fat free cream of celery soup instead. Also didnt have beef broth so used a can of low sodium french onion soup, fat free sour cream and left out the green peppers due to personal preference. My 5yr old loved it! He even asked for extra broth! Yeah!

I had some leftover kielbasa left from a BBQ and looked for a recipe to use it up.  This was great!  I would definitely make it again.

Good recipe, but the simmer time was far too long, so only 3 stars. The flavour is good, but the overcooked veggies are disappointing. Simmer for 20 minutes, not 45. I added a clove of minced garlic, a large thinly sliced carrot, 1/2 tsp paprika (a blend of smoked & regular), at least an extra cup of water and a shake of cayenne pepper flakes. I used 1/3 lb Italian style vegetarian sausage, which is plenty. I love real kielbasa, but my daughter is vegetarian; you’d be surprised how good the veggie sausages are.

My wife made this and I loved it.  She made a few changes though.  She always boils her kielbasa first to get the fat out and then fries it before using it in a recipe.  It makes it so much better.  She also added a large can of diced tomatoes and reduced the water.  She added a tablespoon of Better than Bouillon beef mixture.  She chopped her cabbage instead of   shredding it and omitted the salt.  And because it was a bit thin, she thickened it just slightly with cornstarch at the end.  But it was delicious!  This recipe is a keeper now.

This is a very tasty stew, the only reason I gave 4 stars is because there were no leftovers. Next time I'm going to double or even triple the ingredients.

A perfect recipe to make your own! We added 1 1/2 cups of spinach and kale, 10 oz of great northern beans , and enough broth to keep the ratio. 5 out of 5 people said it was beyond delicious! Even added a fried egg with a top of sour cream and salsa the following morning! Would rate 10 stars if I could!

Delicious and comfoorting on a wet chilly weeknight. I used chicken bone broth instead of water, and added 1 chopped potato and a can of mild green chilies instead of green pepper because that is what I had on hand.I added some smoked chili salt,and garlic powder,and didn't use tomato soup,( hate canned soup!)I replaced it with a can of chopped tomatoes with basil,oregano. This soup is so versatile you could use any type of sausage ,or vegetables and it would still come out tasting delicious! We loved it!

Made it and loved it! I made it spicier by adding a can of green chili. 1/4 teaspoon of tumeric and Chinese 5 spice was added. I took it to a Church function in a slow cooker. Someone asked for the recipe and I referred them to allrecipes.

This was delicious; I did make a substitution, using a 8 oz can of tomato sauce since I don’t have tomato soup, and added chunks of carrot, about 1/4 of each a green and red bell pepper and a shot of worchestershire sauce.   Served it with garlic bread.   I would definitely make it again!

So good, very easy to put together. My cabbage was not mushy at all even after heating up left overs.  I swapped a can of diced tomatoes with Chile peppers for the tomato soup as a personal preference because i don't care for tomato soup.  I also used half regular kielbasa and half hot kielbasa.  There were so many fillers that i added an extra 2 cups of beef broth and it did not deter from its deliciousness, and it was still chock full of goodies and rendered a lot of quantity. Loved it. Thank you for the great recipe

I was nervous about making this thinking I wouldn’t like it, but I’m glad I did give it a try. This was so delicious and even better the next day. I followed the directions except used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato soup and added 4 cloves of crushed garlic. My husband doesn’t like sour cream and he loved it. I put extra sour cream in mine. I served his over white jasmine rice. Oh I also added 2 tbs. of cornflour to thicken it up a little. This will definitely be made again!

I cut the kielbasa pieces into bite size wedges, omitted the green pepper, and top with non fat yogurt in the bowl. Also omitted the salt. One of our favorite winter comfort foods.

My husband said this is waaay good and I should make it again! It did taste very good. I was too lazy to shred cabbage so I used a can of Glory seasoned cabbage. The only thing I might do differently next time would be to sauté the onions with the butter and kielbasa. I also might swap the sour cream for half and half, just because the sour cream kind of broke up and didn’t look smooth in the broth.

Made this receipe exactly as printed with only one minor change.  After browning kielbasa I drained the fat that was in the pan. Excellent receipe with great flavor. Looking forward to making it again on a cold winter night.

This was SO good! I was amazed, because at first I thought it smelled funny. I did replace the water with a bottle of beer, which I used to deglaze the pan before adding the tomato soup and low sodium broth. I have added this to my list of favorite recipes and will make it again and again.

Very good, makes a lot and lasts for days! I didn't use soup but a can of diced tomatoes with seasonings, no water but extra broth  cause we wanted it "soupy" and added chopped carrots and navy beans. Also didn't have the bell pepper which would've made it even better I'm sure. Oh I didn't add salt either and it definitely didn't need it.

I used turkey sausage and omitted the butter. Used 2  packages of 13 oz of the sausage so it was meatier. I added some basil and a few other spices. We loved it. My husband added Tabasco to his. It was very good for few calories! Major win.

This has become a family favorite! The only thing I change is that I usually add some cajun spice.  My daughter asks for this often. Easy to make, and even better the next day. We put it over mashed potatoes sometimes for a hardier meal. Love it!

Delish!!  Used fire roasted tomatoes instead of tomato soup as that is what I had on hand.  It was a big winner with the family.  I have been making this soup for a while and it is hearty, and comforting!

Followed the recipe but used 2 low sodium beef broth, condensed tomato soup, and regular kielbasa. We added garbanzo beans, left over chicken and potatoes. My husband and I both love it. It is filling but not heavy.

This was a simple and delicious dinner. My children even ate their entire bowl of the soup. There was plenty of flavor. The only thing I did different was I forgot to add the sour cream at the end. Maybe I'll remember to add it the next time I make this, or maybe not. Because it was delicious regardless!

This was just great! I used a bag of shredded Cole slaw cabbage, omitted the water, used two cans of beef broth instead. I also omitted the salt and increased the pepper to 1tsp, and instead of the tomato soup I used a can of diced tomatoes with juice. This is a wonderful recipe to adjust as desired. Thanks so much!

Me, and three other family members adore this stew, while three of of us refuse to eat it. I have made a version of this several times now, but always using tomato sauce in place of the tomato soup, and four of us love having it, especially on cold days. I like to hold back the green pepper some (by 20 minutes or so) so it does not get so soggy. Anyway, thank you for sharing this recipe!

Update: I typically double or triple it, holding the green pepper back to the last 15 minutes or so if it cooking. This time, I cut the kielbasa into bite sized chunks instead of rounds, at the request of my husband. 

I didn’t have 42 oz of beef broth, but added beef powder to 10oz of water to add to my broth, and sprinkled a bit more of that powder into the soup with the salt and pepper, whisking it in, since so much water goes into it. I always use tomato sauce in place of the tomato soup, too. 

I fully realize I change it now, but I always refer to this recipe when measuring all the ingredients in it still. My family keeps asking me to make it with crusty bread on the side. Very satisfying meal!

Awesome flavors!  I doubled the recipe, using a carton of beef broth, a bag of coleslaw mix, and a large can of tomato sauce. I also cut the kielbasa into smaller pieces, and added more sour cream (personal taste).  We will definitely be having this again.

Awesome quick recipe! Even the kids loved it! I did make a few adjustments... I added one smoked beef sausage as well because I knew just the kielbasa wouldn't fill my tribe up. I also added garlic. I forgot to buy a green pepper so I substituted with fresh spinach & it turned out great! I will definitely make again!

My favorite addition....Mini cheese and potato pierogies!!!  I added them in at the last 5 minutes.  It added just the right starchiness and bulk to this stew.

I didn't add the extra salt, per other reviewers.  Instead of cabbage, I used shredded brussel sprouts.  I could have easily doubled those to 6 cups, as they cooked down tremendously.   I used a yellow bell pepper...because that is what I had in the fridge.  It actually blended well and didn't overpower, which I think  green bell peppers tend to do sometimes.

I don't like cabbage, but I enjoyed this stew!  We added extra beef broth and kielbasa as well as corn, potatoes, and carrots. Four hours in the crock pot on high was perfect (after cooking the kielbasa). Thanks for a great recipe!

I had to use 2 beef bouillon cubes with 2 cups water for the broth and turkey kielbasa since that is all I had.  Also used a can of tomato sauce in place of the soup, again, all I had.  Per other reviews, I added a can of diced tomatoes (drained), can of kidney beans (rinsed and drained), 2 peeled and diced potatoes, diced carrots and sliced zucchini.  I added the zucchini and beans the last 35 minutes of cooking.  Cooked the first 40 minutes uncovered, then covered for another hour or so.  This was so easy and quick.  Everyone liked it- even hubs who is not a soup fan- he had seconds!!

I was looking for recipes that used cabbage (always have some left after making cabbage rolls) and thought this looked good. I only made a couple minor changes. I read a few reviews where people said it was too salty, so I used only 1/2 tsp of sea salt, not 1-1/2 tsp. Only other I thing i did different was instead of cooking it in a stock pot, I cooked it in a slow cooker for 5 hours on low. Other than using less salt, I thought it was a great recipe and it tasted great.  Definitely adding it into my recipe book.

Really easy to make, and it's delicious! My husband usually has something to say about any dish I prepare, even if he likes it - "this would taste really good if you added 'blank' to it." But with this stew, he just said he really likes it!

10-11-15 ~ Made this up for our lunches this week and to freeze some for my in-laws and kids.   I didn't have tomato soup, but I did have canned tomatoes with jalapeños.  So, one batch I made was spicy and we loved it.  The second batch I made without the jalapeños, and it too was very good.  I would make this one again.

I've made this numerous times. this recipe is very easy, and you can substitute a lot of it. I didn't even use cabbage one time I made it and just put other veggies in it and it came out great. As long as you stick with the tomato soup/ or sauce, broth, protein sausage, and your favorite vegetables you are golden.

I've made this several times. I often double it, and when  I do I substitute a can of small-diced tomatoes (roasted garlic and black pepper flavour) for one of the cans of soup, to freshen it up. I also sautee all the veggies together before I start adding liquids, for added flavour, and finish extra black pepper.

DELICIOUS! BUT.. DO NOT ADD SALT! I also used smoked sausage.  I browned the onions and then added the sausage and let them brown before adding the other ingredients. I sliced the sausage into smaller pieces also..maybe 1/2 inch. Did I mention...DON'T ADD SALT!  wait til it is all done and then taste it at least!  I also cut a couple peeled potatoes into it.

I didn't have any cabbage, sour cream, fresh garlic or onion, but used a bag of frozen veggies that had broccoli, yellow squash, green beans, carrots, onions and red peppers. Cream cheese and minced garlic as a substitutes, other than that followed the recipe exactly, came out beyond delicious! Simple, quick and soooo good! Will definitely make again, next time more of all the ingredients because it went so quickly!

I just made this this afternoon. It was rainy and I wanted something warm. It was awesome!! Everyone loved it. Super easy. The only change I made was to substitute the tomato soup (I think it tends to make recipes bland) for cans of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes. Will for sure make it again.

This was absolutely scrumptious!  I added chopped zucchini as well to the mix to up the veggie content.

Would highly recommend!

Made it exactly as the recipe called and it was great! My family loved it. I will omit the sour cream next time though because my husband tasted the broth prior to including it and liked it better that way. Served it with toasted and buttered baguette slices for dipping in the broth. This is a keeper in my house!

Made this for dinner tonight.  I did not brown the sausage in butter, because so much fat/grease comes out of the sausage anyway.  Once the sausage was browned, I drained off most of the fat.  Then I added the onion and browned that a little.  Continued with the recipe, excluding the salt.  Good thing!  We try to do lower sodium, and it would have been way too salty if I had added it.  I did use the lower sodium tomato soup and beef broth.  

My husband isn't fond of cabbage, but enjoyed this and got seconds.  I thought it was good.  Not a favorite, but it'll be nice to have from time to time.  My daughter didn't like this.  She said the flavor was good, but couldn't get past the texture of the cabbage.  But she's picky that way.

Delicious and hearty, easy to tweak (not that it needs much) to your liking. I used tomato paste and stewed tomatoes instead of the soup  also added a little chili flake for a little kick. My wife, kids and their friends devoured the whole pot.

WOW!  Definitely a keeper!!  Pretty much followed recipe...with a few slight changes.  I doubled it.  Sautéed 1 1/2 white onions and sausage in butter first, ADDED 2 CHOPPED POTATOES.  Used 15 oz. bagged chopped cabbage (angel hair cole slaw).  Used about 5-6 cups of water and 3 tsp beef boullion.  ADDED CARROTS.  Used only 1/2 tsp salt.  I forgot the sour cream, but will try it with the leftovers.  Made enough for our family of 4, plus leftovers, and some to freeze!  Thinking I will add corn next time.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I followed the recipe as written. Only short cut I took was using a bag of coleslaw rather than chopping the cabbage myself. The family voted this a keeper and we'll be making it again.

I'm trying to cut out carbs and processed foods, and eating the same thing over and over was getting boring.  I thought this recipe would mix it up.  I made it essentially as written, but added diced carrots.  I cut the kielbasa thin and browned it, then sautéed the vegetables.  I put that and the remaining ingredients in the crock pot.  I used a bag of cole slaw mix instead of plain cabbage, and I also added a couple of fresh diced tomatoes and a small can (4 oz) of tomato sauce.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours.  When I tried it the first night, it was a 4 star recipe.  When I had the leftovers for lunch for the next few days, it was a 5 star.  Just gets better.  I know it is a strange recipe, but I promise, it's absolutely delicious.  The broth is amazing.  But don't skip the sour cream--that gives it that extra creaminess.  Delicious!

This is one of my favorite recipes! I did change it a little though. I omitted the bell pepper and added colored potatoes instead. The purple ones look stunning in it! I also throw in minced garlic with the kielbasa when I brown it. My favorite cheat for this recipe though is to use a bag of coleslaw mix instead of taking time cutting the cabbage up.

The ingredients here put me in mind of a gumbo type dish, I used this recipe as a starting point and went crazy!!  Kielbasa, diced chicken, no cabbage, family does not like it. Loved the tomato soup, but my family loves our dishes sweet. SMALL amount of Cajun seasoning, Radiatore pasta and shrimp added at the end. AWESOME!! Will add some potato flakes next time to thicken it up a fuzz.  The sour cream really does enhance it. Had with crusty French bread. Feeds my 3 teenage boys well. A new family favorite!!

This was easy and delicious!
I browned the onions and peppers with the sausage and then put everything in the crockpot on high.  I used julienned coleslaw mix for the cabbage, adding an extra 1/2 cup.  This not only saved time but produced a nice, almost noodle-like texture.  Since my beef broth was not low-sodium, I omitted the additional salt called for in the recipe.  When my husband got home about two hours later, he had some, and he reported to me when I returned home that this recipe was a keeper!  I'll definitely make it again.

We LOVE this recipe!!  Nobody in my family likes tomatoe soup so we used crushed tomatoes instead of soup. Like others suggested, I added potatoes, celery and carrots.  Based on other reviews - I didn't use any additional salt. Since I have to work all day and wanted this to be ready when I got home - I threw all the ingredients in a crock-pot and let it cook on low for 8 hours.  FAB-U-LOUS!!!

Loved it... so many possibilities with this recipe.  I did not add salt or water.  I did add 5-6 carrots, diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning, 2 tsp dry red pepper, a sprinkle of cayenne pepper & garlic powder. Hubby gave it 2 thumbs up as well!!

This was fabulous!  Made the first batch exactly as written and loved it. The second batch I doubled - the only change was (based on other reviews), was that I added tomato sauce and diced tomatoes. It is now one of our favorite soups!  Served with crusty baguette for dipping. I really can't express how well these flavors blend together sand compliment each other.

This is one of our favorites!  It's perfect to make after work when your short on time.  I spice it up a little bit but even prepared as written it's a great meal!

Absolutely delicious! This recipe was quick and easy. The only change I made was adding some bouillon base to the water before adding it to the stew. I served this over homemade dumpling. Perfect meal for a cold night!

I add a few things to a doubled recipe!  It was delicious!  1 cup prepared brown rice, 2 cans     cannellini beans and chili powder to taste.

Thanks, this was so easy to make.  I used already cooked turkey sausage.  I used whole milk instead of sour cream and left the cabbage out.

Pretty good.  Made in the crockpot, 8 hours on low. Added potatoes and carrots, also substituted a can of diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce for the tomato soup. Could have added more veggies; I diced up the kielbasa and it seemed like there was a lot of meat in there. The sour cream was a nice touch.

SO easy and delicious. Made just a few changes though. Substituted coleslaw mix for cabbage, used homemade tomato juice, browned turkey kielbasa in olive oil instead of butter AND added garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and cumin. Will make again!

I thought this was pretty good.  Used smoked authentic Kielbasa from a polish deli and a bag of coleslaw mix instead of shredding my own cabbage.  The family thought it was okay but didn't want to eat the leftovers.

This recipe was fantastic! The only tweaks I made were to use reduced sodium beef broth (which made the recipe as salty as it needed to be without adding more) and added some spices to the mix (cayenne pepper, a little chili powder, garlic, and smoked paprika) and it came out great! Also, I'm not sure about everyone else, but the recipe was done in almost half the time suggested on a low-medium heat setting. Anywho, I just finished my second serving, with a hunk of crusty bread to soak up the leftover deliciousness at the bottom of the bowl :)

We truly enjoyed this.  Added the extra sour cream as suggested. This is also another one of those dishes that is better after a day of aging. My first thought was that I would serve this to anybody, it's that good.  I probably used 1 1/2 lbs or more of kielbasa.  It was a good, coursely ground variety.  Not the commercial stuff that looks like a big hot dog.  It makes a big difference.

delicious meal.  I didn't use the tomato soup but a jar of home canned stewed tomatoes.  My husband really enjoyed this too.  I will be making this again and again this winter.

Very Yummy!  I left out the sour cream because I didn't have any.  It would be a nice addition though.  I had a can of beef gravy on hand, so I used that instead of the beef broth.  I also used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato soup.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was a great stew!  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added potatoes to make it a little more hearty.  Also chopped up some celery for a little crunch.  I did substitute turkey kielbasa for the beef and you couldn't even tell! The whole family loved it!

Loved this recipe.  I took other readers advise and did not add salt. I also used low sodium beef broth and added a dash of cayenne pepper. We did not add the sour cream and it was still wonderful!

Very tastey recipe. Left out the salt. We figured the sausage and broth would be enough salt content, and it surely was. Next time I am going to add a little heat to it. cant wait.

This was great. I substituted tomato paste and a can of diced tomatoes for the tomato soup. I also added a little more cabbage ( it was a package of pre-shredded cabbage for coleslaw). I added a smidge more water to compensate for the extra cabbage, and threw in a package of dry onion mushroom soup mix for fun. I thickened the stew with some wondra flour/water before adding the sour cream, and served it over instant mashed potatoes. Very comforting! I will definately make this again.

This was amazing!  My husband and mother lived it!  I did add potato's like others recommended and I added some red pepper flakes and Cajun Seasoning.  Next time I think some carrot's would also make for a great flavor.  For sure a keeper in my recipe box!

This was simply delicious!!  I did follow recommendations from others and I used canned diced tomatoes instead of the soup and I added potatoes.  I have also added leftover corned beef in addition to the sausage, yum! Truly an easy and wonderful dinner...serve with warm bread and butter, mmmm!!

This was phenomenal!  We have been on a low-carb diet for a few weeks and have just about grown feathers and fins from all of the chicken and fish.  This was an exceptional change of pace.  I took suggestions from a couple of others and used a small can of tomato sauce and a can of diced stewed tomatoes in lieu of tomato soup.  We love cabbage so I didn't measure, just used 1/2 of a large head.  Used olive oil instead of butter and sauteed onions, a clove of minced garlic, and bell pepper in with the sausage, then added the liquid ingredients and the cabbage.  My honey told me that I could definitely make this again!  Woo-hoo!!

This is a 4. Missing the stupendousness of a "5", but still really good. I used my homemade vegetable broth instead of canned beef broth, and tomato sauce instead of canned tomatoes, then reduced salt in half after reading reviews. I allowed guest to salt themselves after serving; I highly recommend this. Also, I did add the sour cream. It's great with it. It had a richer flavor when room temp, and the kielbasa in the sauce is some of the best kielbasas I've ever had. It is a great homestyle dish. Not something you'd serve to company, but great to curl around the TV with.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using and adding more turkey kielbasa.  My whole picky family enjoyed this one.  I will be using it again and again.

Very good. Only thing I didn't like was the change I had made:  I added potatoe but wouldn't do again, as the texture of the potatoe changes to mushy, once the stew has been frozen then thawed out.

Not too bad, but not what I expected.  The flavor was good, but I like thickened stews and this definitely is more toward the soup category rather than a stew.  Also, next time I would  serve the sour cream on the side.  I forgot to tempter the sour cream, so it curdled.

Very, Very Yummy!!  We all loved it - including my kids who are 4 and 2 1/2!!  I added potatoes and a some more kielbasa just because my sons love it.  Instead of water I just used extra beef broth.  Did everything else as listed!! Great and will be using again!!

This was delicious and simple to make. I was worried that it needed some pasta or rice or something, but it turned out great without it. The only changes I made were to use turkey smoked sausage and I cut it up into slices about 1/4" thick.  I didn't add much salt, maybe 1/4 tsp.  I will definitely make this again and may try the crockpot.

I just made this stew... and it's definitely a family favorite in the making. Following other's suggestions, i droppped the salt and used low sodium broth. I did end up adding a little salt later, about a 1/4 tsp. I also added a can of diced tomatoes i had kicking around, and we used Red instead of Green Peppers.   Delicious!!

This was so good and easy to make. I added cubed potatoes and omitted the sour cream. I also used low sodium broth and light kielbasa. I put it in the crock pot for 4hrs on high. Turned out great.

Tastes great. Nicely complex - salty and sweet and smoky.  I made the recipe as indicated, except that I stirred in 1/4 tsp ground dried sage and simmered another 5 min. Next time, I will use only 1 tsp salt, instead of the one and a half specified by the recipe. This recipe lends itself to lots of modifications.  I might add some sliced carrots next time, or maybe a bay leaf. But it is still a super recipe just the way that it appears here.

We loved this. I make this basic stew without the bouillion and tomato usually, but tried it just like the recipe calls for except I omitted the added salt. It was great and we'll definitely have it again!

This was very good, and my family enjoyed this. I did not brown the Kielbasa in butter (didnt feel the need for the grease), I also did not add the 1 1/2c of water, this was way soupy enough with the 2 c. of beef stock that I used. I also subbed red pepper for the green, added baby carrots and thin sliced potatoes for a complete meal. This was very tasty and hearty. A nice warm you up meal. Will make again!

Smelled like my great-grandma's stuffed cabbages. I love that cabbage/kielbasa smell. I used tomato sauce, and added a can of white beans and one diced potato. Hubby asked that next time, I up the cabbage, more potato and lots of carrot. I will make this a lot.

Delicious!  My non soup loving hubby even gobbled it up.  I did not realize until I was making it that I had purchased broccoli slaw mix instead of cabbage slaw.  I used it anyway and it was awesome!  I also used (as suggested) sauce instead of soup.  I used a gourmet brand that had sausage crumbles in it.  I also added a splash of pepper sauce.  I will absolutely make this again!!!

This is a great way to use up leftover cabbage.  I added carrots and potatoes as recommended by other reviews.  It was very tasty and quite filling.  I forgot to put the sour cream in and it was still great!  Next time I think I'll use turkey kielbasa to make it a little healthier.

What a fantastic stew!  When I suggested we have a stew of some sort tonight, my husband said he thought we were avoiding red meat.  I told him I would try to find something healthier and this hit the spot! We used Healthy Ones kielbasa, added carrots, potatoes, and garlic, and used a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste instead of the soup.  Definitely a keeper!  Thank you very much for this recipe.

oh my god, so good.  And so easy to make!

I went ahead and used tomato sauce instead of the soup and added some red potatoes and crushed red pepper.  I also used beef stock instead of broth (not sure if that made a difference, but I had it on hand)

It tasted delicious...and then I realized I forgot to add the sour cream.  When I did, it was even better!  The flavor..MMM.

This was good and easy. I might add potatoes and/or carrots next time like others suggested. And it is more soupy than stewy, but that didn't take away from the taste. I did add hot sauce because I like it more spicy than sweet. Thanks!!

The broth is great, but the keilbasa is too rich and overpowering, to be the main ingredient.

Very tasty. Added a few diced potatoes for additional substance. I made day in advance. Stews such as this always seem better the next day. JDG

Used turkey kielbasa and light sour cream and kept all the other ingredients as written.  My family really enjoyed.  Served with a warm roasted garlic bread to soak up the sauce.  Will definately make again.  Thanks Jo

This was so easy to make and it tastes great.  Very good on a cold afternoon.  I also would not add salt as it was salty enough to start. I will definitely make this again.

VERY GOOD and easy to make.  The only thing I would change is the amount of salt.  I don't think any salt needed to be added, other than that it was delicious!!

Yum!!! I really wasn't sure how this was going to turn out, but it was AWESOME! Okay, so it's a little much for my 3 year old, but my husband and I devour it each time I make it (and I've made it several times now). We are onion lovers so I always add twice the amount a recipe calls for, but other then that, I didn't change anything! Thanks Jo!

Very good!  It was more watery (waterier?) than I expected it to be - maybe I'd cut down the water to a cup next time? - but still, the flavor was delicious.  I cooked it in the crockpot for 6 hours on low, I substituted red pepper and green onion and fat-free everything, but it was still tasty!

This was wonderful!  We thoroughly enjoyed all the flavors.  Will definitely want to make this one again.  The only thing I did different was to cut way down on the salt as we don't like a lot.  Excellent!
