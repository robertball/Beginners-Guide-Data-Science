Nobody loves BLTs more than me, so I thought this sounded like a great idea. But, it needs a good sauce to make it five stars. Otherwise, it's kind of bland. I made three sticks by skewering a third of a slice of bacon per toothpick, microwaved them a minute, then add the bread, tomato and lettuce wedge. Worked like a charm, but it is awkward to eat as an hors d'oeuvres and would have tasted better with some mayo or other special sauce. Still four stars for the idea!

Yes, these little sandwiches definately need mayo or dressing of some kind on them to "tasty" them up...OR...simply make regular-sized BLTs on rye using mayo/dressing, stick toothpicks every inch or so, and then cut them into smaller pieces. Good idea for canapes/hors d'oeuvres, however.
