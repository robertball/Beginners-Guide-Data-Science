Super easy, I skipped the water chestnuts.  One note, don't add the sauce mixture if the pan is still on high/medium heat.  Yummy!

I'm not really a water chestnut fan, so I left that part out, but other then that, this was pretty good. I used dark soy sauce, some minced garlic, and a little grated orange rind. Very flavourful :)

to make this taste more authentic (tasted like it was missing something) I added some ginger, garlic, ground chili paste and little black pepper.  came out much better when these were added - with these additions I would definitely make it again.

Very quick and really easy. Simple flavors of the orange and broccoli are good together.

I didn't use the water chestnuts as I was making just a single serving, but I think that would make it a better presentation and more of a dish for guests.  Because many of the reviewers said the sauce became too thick when added to the skillet, I used the same amount of orange juice called for but only half the cornstarch.  Some brown sugar for a bit of sweetness would be good to mellow the sharpness of the orange.  My rating would actually be 3.5 for this.

Not a bad recipe, but it really did need to be seasoned not to mention more soy sauce. Would I make this again? Probably not, but it was worth at least trying, giving the ease of prep.

Loved it made it with sesame tilapia. I steamed the broccoli first then followed the recipe. We loved it.

This was okay, but I didn't find it that flavorful. Perhaps with added garlic, ginger, and more soy sauce. It is a very nice color.

This wasn't the tastiest, that's for sure.  I was surprised..especially with the sesame oil and worcestshire sauce.  It was lacking something..not quite sure what though.  Maybe it will be better tomorrow?

This was an easy and very tasty side dish. The only thing I did differently was to zest and  sqeeze two oranges for juice. Even my picky 3 year old loved it and my 5 year old (who normally will not eat broccoli) loved it.

Fantastic!  I was looking for a new stir fry sauce and found this recipe.  I added udon noodles and tofu, and skipped the water chestnuts.  At first I thought the sauce wouldn't have enough flavor but (since the noodles and tofu are so mildly flavored) it worked out perfectly well!

I liked this a lot.  Didn't have water chestnuts so I just left them out but left everything else the same.  I think this sauce would be good as an orange chicken sauce, actually.  Bf wasn't as impressed, but he's picky about fruit flavored foods that aren't dessert.  thanks for the recipe!

Quick and easy recipe, but my family didn't take to it.  The orange flavor is a bit strong.  I used this on a stir fry with broccoli, carrots, and zucchini.

I really didn't like this dish.  Three minutes was not enough time to sufficiently cook the broccoli and once I added the orange sauce it immediately turned to orange glue.  I had to add more water - probably a cup and a half in the end - while continuing to cook the broccoli.  In the end the dish had very little flavor - couldn't taste the soy or the orange flavor.  Will definitely not make again.

The OJ overwhelmed the rest of the flavors. It's pretty easy and I think it's worth trying again with maybe 1/4 cup orange juice. Like many others, I skipped the water chestnut.

Easy, light and flavorful describes this recipes. I needed a quick sauce for my stir fry so I tried this and really liked it. My stir fry consisted of chicken, broccoli, chestnuts, carrots, peppers  and rice. I used an orange/pineapple blend juice and added a couple extra drops of soy sauce. The flavor isn't bold, but definitely a keeper for me.

I used fresh tangerine juice and added a spoonful of oyster sauce to boost flavor.  Simple and good, but lacking something to make it really special.

This was good, but either the broccoli should be doubled or the sauce cut down.

Thanks for sharing this great recipe! :) Sounds tasty. Will try it for sure, but with fresh orange juice. I'd prefer to stir fry the broccoli first for about 1-2 minutes as it is needs more cooking time, then add the other veg. Baby corn would be great in place of water chestnuts :)

The orange flavor was too strong for my tastes.  Not a very subtle dish, but it's better when served over rice.
