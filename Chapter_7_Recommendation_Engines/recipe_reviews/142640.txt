This is such a cute, yummy, kid-friendly recipe! Here are some things I did to make a super cute and easy watermelon: I used the largest of my Wonderlier Tupperware bowl set lined with plastic wrap and lined the inside with one pint of lime sherbet. I put about 1 1/2 cups of softened vanilla ice cream inside of the lime sherbet to make the watermelon more realistic. It started to get very soft, so I hardened it up in the freezer for about 10 minutes. When I pulled it back out, I could easily smooth the rind layer. I filled it up with the softened raspberry sherbet/chocolate chip mixture with only a tiny bit left over. Then I put the lid onto the Tupperware bowl and froze it overnight. It worked really well, and everyone loved it! The watermelon really looked realistic, and it tasted really yummy. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Clever idea, but the sherbet melts so quickly that it becomes soupy before it can be served. The editor's tip about putting a warm towel on the bowl to help remove the sherbet only hastens the melting. Perhaps lining the bowl with plastic wrap would be a better idea. I would also suggest serving on chilled plates.

I did think ahead to line the bowl w/plastic so had no trouble getting it out of the bowl. Sherbet does melt quickly so you have to work fast to make this work. Mine was a little souply but after going back int he freezer it was fine. Kids loved it.

I made this recipe because my mom made for me as a kid and I wanted to share it with my children. I did a few things differently. I covered a small/medium bowl with a plastic bag. I rubbed dark green food coloring on the inside of the bowl. Then I spread a layer of lime sherbet in the bowl, froze, spread a layer of lemon sorbet, froze, softened strawberry sorbet, added the mini chips, filled the center of the bowl with the sorbet chip mixture, returned to the freezer until completely firm. Then I removed it from the bowl by slipping the bag off the bowl and lifting the "watermelon" out of the bowl. It brought back sweet memories and created some new ones.

A very refreshing summer treat. The most important part of this recipe is making sure you line your bowl with plastic wrap before putting the sherbert in the bowl. Use sherbert that is soft, but not soupy. Work fast and if the sherbert gets too soft, put it in the freezer for 15 minutes before trying to re-shape the lime "rind" with a spoon.

Using a little green food coloring in the lime sherbet makes it very authentic.  A think layer of white ice cream between the lime and the raspberry is even more authentic.  So refreshing.
