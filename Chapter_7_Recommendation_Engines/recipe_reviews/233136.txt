I used shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheeses instead of American.  Good for teens!  Hearty, quick, and easy.

This turned out great! Exactly what I was looking for on this Saturday night with no supper plans. I used fresh onion,and my cheese was not fat free, but followed to a tee otherwise.  Had a sweeter taste than goulash I've made before with tomato sauce/juice. Thanks for a great new recipe!

This turned out great. Both my husband & I loved it. I tweaked it a little bit: left out the corn & the cheese & added just a little Worcester sauce & a little melted butter! Tasted great!!

Have made this recipe twice....first as is and then with personal adjustments...as all cooks do! It was great as is with no complaints here! Personal adjustments? Only one cup of macaroni, 3 cloves of fresh garlic minced, substituted one can of tomato soup for diced tomatoes with Italian herbs & spices, one chopped onion fresh, lots of fav spices as desired, 3/4 shredded cheddar IN casserole....then another 3/4 of cheddar on top. Pretty hard to stop eating ....

I took some suggestions from other reviewers and added a little Worcestershire sauce, about 1/2 an onion and subbed a can of tomato sauce for the soup and cheddar cheese for American because that's what I had on hand. It was easy and my entire family was happy with it! This one is definitely a keeper!  Thank you for sharing it!

This recipe went over pretty well. I used frozen corn instead of canned corn. My son was disappointed when I told him we were having ghoulash (which he loves) but then there were no tomatoes. I'd say maybe a little less corn and maybe add a can of diced tomatoes but otherwise it was a good recipe.

This was a super great dish! I didn't put any corn in though and used tomato sauce instead of soup. I added a lot of spices like chili powder and cumin to make it even better!

What a delicious little hot dish!! My family loved it!! My husband and son being from Minnesota are kind of  connoisseurs .  I added a bit more spices to it just to suit their taste but i used the same spices as the recipe called for. Definitely a winner!

It isn't half bad, nice for a quick dinner. I left out the corn for picky eaters and added pepper. It was better than I expected it to be.

You know, I loved this. Sure, we all add different spices or cheese, whatever, but the base recipe is exactly what I was looking for when I searched for Italian Goulash. Thanks, Kristi!

My family loved it! 6 year old asked me to pack it for her lunch tomorrow. Husband had seconds. 3 year old refused to try it. Oh well.
I left out the corn, added a little worcestersire, and used shredded cheddar. Yummy comfort food. Will definately make again.

This was excellent. Only thing I changed was I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup and added more garlic (which I do for almost every recipe). When reheating the next day I added a can of tomato soup.

This is ghoulish the way I remember it growing up. I went 4 not 5 stars because I'm going to tweek it a little bit next time I have it. Going to up the Italian seasoning and go one can tomato soup and one can tomato paste. Also I found the recommended amount of pasta to be way way to much! Next time I'll only cook one cup of uncooked pasta.

I used tomato paste instead of soup because that's what I had. I also threw in two tablespoons of grey poupon because I love mustard:). Otherwise the same. My 6-year old liked it. Oh, I did use two different cheeses for adults and kids. Next time, I might skip the corn and serve it with a veggie instead.

Gave it ONLY two stars because it was filling! Followed the recipe as direct but had no flavor. Doesn’t have any taste at all. Go figure, I would have noted that others that rated this would have tasted the difference. I don’t have a cold so my taste buds haven’t been impaled on anything, but it is truly tasteless. Cheese didn’t do anything either.

This is a good basic ground beef and macaroni casserole that can be adapted to your individual tastes.  I followed the main steps, but did make changes.  I added some chopped peppers when browning the beef, substituted a can of diced tomatoes for one of the cans of soup, and added some oregano along with the Italian seasoning.  I wanted to prepare it ahead of time, so put it in a casserole dish, topped with grated cheddar and reheated in a 350 degree oven for about 40 minutes (it had been refrigerated).  I think you could saute other vegetables of your choice to incorporate more veggies into your meal!  The recipe was a great starting point to go from!

I followed the recipe, except I used 1/2 shredder cheddar and 1/2 mozzarella. Very good. And easy!

I did not have high expectations since this is essentially homemade hamburger helper...LOL. It was ok but I'm not sure I'll make it again.  I made it exactly as listed.  The American cheese was a little weird. I'd probably add shredded cheddar instead.

Super yummy dinner! Added onions and medium cheddar cheese graded. Onions made it better for sure. Easy too

Try this with ground turkey and fresh diced onion. Also used a combo of 1 can tomato soup  and a little bit of crushed tomatoes. Stirred in the macaroni while al dente and used grated Parmesan. Used garlic salt and celery. Was very tasty.

Very good! Almost like a healthy version of hamburger helper! I ended up using a small onion instead of the dried onion, and 3 cloves of garlic. I substituted about 1/2 cup pasta sauce for the 2nd can of tomato soup. My 2 year old gobbled it up!

Used only 1 can tomato soup, and a whole chopped onion (cooked with the beef). Really was good. Grated cheese on top instead of slices. My husband loved it - great as leftovers too.

I used shredded cheese to be more healthy. I used 1/2 cup chopped onion but wouldn't drain corn because it needed more liquid. I used one can tomato sauce in place of one tomato soup, but would try the soup next time. It was very good and had plenty of leftovers.
