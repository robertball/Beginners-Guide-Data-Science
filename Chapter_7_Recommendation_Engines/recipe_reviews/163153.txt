I made this tonight.  I think it would be a great hot weather meal.  My only issue was that there was not enough sauce to cook the asparagus and for the noodles.  I think next time I would partially cook the asparagus and then add.  I ended up adding about a 1/4 C of butter for the sauce.  It also needed a bit of salt and pepper, but the recipe stated to taste.  I would do this again, but with some slight modifications.  Actually I make a similar one that is from Barefoot Contessa and I think I wilol add the asparagus to that.  Thanks for sharing.

This was the recipe I was looking for!  It was very tasty!  

I read the comments & think I have found ways to solve the problems addressed in them. Because of the mention of the excess liquid,  I had a jar of Penzy's powdered lemon zest that I used in lieu of the juice.  I bet fresh would be even better. I added 1/4 cup of a can of petite diced tomatoes & to counterbalance the acid, I put in 1 pinch (literally) of white sugar. It did not give any sweetness, just balanced the acid content. To also help with the liquid issue, I cooked the pasta (I used spaghetti) 2 minutes short  of done, and then tossed it into the pan of sauce & cooked it for the remaining 2 minutes there. 

Thanks for the great recipe!

I added a can of diced tomatoes, partially drained, sliced mushrooms and a red bell pepper cut in 1 inch pieces matching the asparagus.  This is a definite repeater in our house.

This was super easy and super awesome!  I was actually in the grocery store today looking in the freezer section at the Bertolli Shrimp Asparagus & Shrimp Penne skillet meal for 2.  I thought it looked easy enough to make and it would be cheaper to make myself.  I found this recipe & it totally fit the bill :)  The only change I made was adding a can of undrained garlic, basil & oregano diced tomatoes (as I had read that some reviewers thought the sauce was a little thin).  This is a definite keeper!

My children were baffled at first that I would even dare give them something with a wine sauce, but even my picky eater likes this one.

Incredibly easy and super-tasty! I added mushrooms with te asparagus and another dash of red pepper flakes at the very end before serving, which kicked it up a notch. Served with a nice green side salad, and it was perfect!

This was wonderful.  I used some of the sauce to flavor a side salad.  With some garlic toast, you could sop that right up!!!

The wine and lemon juice made the very thin 'sauce' too acidic for us (If I made this again I wouldn't include the lemon juice).  We added sauteed mushrooms.

I just did not care for this at all.  The sauce was bland & slightly watery (even after I let it simmer for longer than the recipe called for & also added a tad of cornstarch).  If you are looking for something light, this might work but it was just so so in my opinion.

Great recipe!  I did changed a few thing based on what I was looking for and what I had on hand.  I added 1 habenaro pepper to the onions and garlic.  I added one can of dice tomatoes.  I did not have any cheese.  I was really good.  Very VERY spicy but I love habenaro -- it is the hot that keeps on giving.  With the tomatoes and no cheese the sauce is a bit thin.  Probably would make sure I had the cheese next time or put some cream in to thicken a little.  On the other hand the way it was turned out very light.

Great Recipe!  I do agree that the sauce is a little dry, so I add some of the pasta water which helps add volume and thickness due to the starch in the water. Instead of parmesan I added feta cheese.  The dish was delish!

This is delicious. I did not have asparagus on hand.  I used the small frozen okra and it was yummy and my husband loved it.  On a later date, I tried it with asparagus, but my husband preferred the okra...all cooked the same but I watched to make sure the okra was cooking well before moving on in the recipe.

Very flavorful and delicious! Good contrast between the hot pepper and lemon flavors. Based on previous reviews, I added more wine to the sauce mixture to make more.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to add more asparagus --- the asparagus I used was very small and, since we love it,there was not enough of it!

This was a big hit with my husband who said it looked and tasted like a dish served at a nice restaurant..can't ask for more than that! As suggested by another reviewer, I added chopped red pepper, sliced mushrooms and can of partially drained diced tomatoes. Made it that much better and looked beautiful. Parmesan cheese on top and a glass of wine...wonderful!

Very good recipe although it didn't make enough sauce.  I ended up adding another half cup of wine and about 3 more Tbs of butter.

Loved this! My husband can't eat shrimp, so I just left that out, though I think I'll use chicken next time. Both our boys (2&5) loved it! We will definately be having this again!

This was absolutely delicious! I added some scallops to mine to give it more of a seafood flair, and it worked very well! My fiance loved it, and it had just enough spice in it for both of us. Excellent recipe that will be used in my house over and over again!

This is a fabulous recipe with lots of options for personal taste!  I would add some more vegetables, including increasing amount of asparagus, maybe some red bell peppers and/or some diced tomatoes.  The flavor profile on this is fabulous and very adaptable to suit your personal taste.

This was all right.  It didn't turn out horribly, but it also wasn't something I was really excited about.  I did find that adding tomatoes and mushrooms made it much more interesting, and when I did that, I had no problem with there being enough sauce (on the contrary, there was quite a bit).

I make this all the time and it is a family favorite.  I always double the recipe, and add sundried tomatoes for flavor and beautiful color.
Two tips - cook the shrimp BEFORE adding the asparagus to keep it crisp and bright green, and also add one ladle-full of the starchy pasta water when the shrimp and asparagus are simmering towards the end of the pasta cook time.  It adds more to the "sauce" and fills out the dish.

I added some  fresh fried mushrooms, and later added a diced fresh tomato. This is my 4th review after 100’s of tries. This is worthy of special company. I did reserve a half cup of pasta water to boil the asparagus. But truly, this is among the 5 best recipes on this site. Enjoy!

Made this for my family today (w/o the red pepper flakes, and I maybe added a bit more butter) - everyone loved it! And I have some picky eaters in this nine person crowd. My well traveled brother-in-law said it tasted like Tuscany!! And it was so easy to make! Joined just so I could save this recipe:)

I love this recipe and have made it a few times now. I added some cherry tomatoes halved and used a little more cheese and it's very pretty!

Oh my! This was fantastic! The only changes I made was: 1 cup of white wine, 2 tablespoons butter and added mushrooms. I'm glad I doubled the wine and butter. It made just the right amount of sauce. I had to use rigatoni pasta as I had no penne. This was so good! We will be making this again. Thank you!

This was a hit. I followed the recipe pretty much as written, but added a small zuchinni that had seen better days. It was a sweltering day here, so this was a good choice for Saturday night supper. In my house, there is never too much sauce!

This is now one of my favorite recipes!  I've made it twice and my husband loves it, as do I.  I do tend to add a little more wine, other than that, no changes.  One of the keys is not to overcook the shrimp, and as I used large shrimp, it was perfect!

This was good the first time I had made it as instructed.  Then I changed it just a little this time by adding a can of diced tomatoes.  In my opinion, this made it much better.  Plus, Hubby usually likes a tomato sauce on his pasta.  So, this can of diced tomatoes saved the day with him.  It was so light and lovely.  I plan to make it this way again in the future.  I served this with garlic bread and a spinach salad made with craisins, blue cheese and homemade cider vinaigrette.  Nice dinner

This was a great recipe. I added a little extra white wine, olive oil and butter to make sure there was enough sauce.  I also added in about a cup and a half of cooked diced chicken.  My whole family loved it.  Even my 6 and 10 year old!

Good recipe.  I made it with chicken breast.  I cut the chicken into cubes and sauteed it with salt and pepper.  when it was done, I took it out of the pan and set it aside.  Then proceeded with the recipe as written.  I added the chicken and juices back in when the it says to add shrimp.  turned out great.

Made this last night and it was AMAZING! I'm not a big onion person so I left those out and in their place I chopped up some Prosciutto to cook with the garlic and oil, then followed all of the other steps. This is going to be a new family favorite!

My husband and I loved this meal. The only two things I would change: I will make more pasta than the one cup it calls for, but we eat a lot of food; if you're making this for guests I would cut the red pepper flakes in half simply because there are a lot of people who cannot handle anything hot. I'm typically one of those people but this one was just fine for me.
In short, more pasta, fewer red pepper flakes, and we loved it so I will most certainly be making this again.

I omitted the shrimp for the kids but was still delicious!!! May omit the red pepper flakes next time because the kids thought it was a little spicy.  Did add extra bread crumbs and Parmesan.

Delicious! The changes we made were that we marinated the shrimp in Allegro Hot and Spicy Marinade, then grilled the shrimp.  We added 1 can of Hunts diced tomatoes with Basil, Garlic and Oregano.  Instead of the penne, we used Organic Black Bean Spaghetti noodles which have 25G of protein and only 5 grams of carbs and taste wonderful!  I never use the whole grain pastas because I think they taste terrible. 
This was one of my all time favorite pasta dishes and will certainly eat this again and again!

OMG !! I made this recipe and I doubled it. So instead of one cup of pasta, I made two etc. But at the very end I added one container of cooking with philly savory garlic to this dish to give it a nice creamy saucy rue to it.  It is Red Lobster worthy. It's for sure a keeper. !!!  Awww SO SO GOOD.

Tried this tonight.  Have lots of wonderful recipes from this site, but this is the first review.  This was great!  Followed all the ingredients exactly but adjusted the amounts to our tastes.  Added to my recipe box, it is a keeper!
