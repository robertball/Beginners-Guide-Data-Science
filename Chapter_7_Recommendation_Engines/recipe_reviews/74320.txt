A total success, and prepared in the nick of time! So simple and yet even my husband who hates veggies raved on and on, and ate every bit too. I actually snapped the tops off a broccoli bunch for this. I put it uncovered in the microwave with a little water on the bottom for 3 mins. I also added garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the butter. It was tender and just right, very fresh tasting!

Substituted broccoli - but will try the broccoline since I have a recipe now.

Used the Lemon-Pepper/Dill version and it was really tasty. AND - it was quick and easy!
