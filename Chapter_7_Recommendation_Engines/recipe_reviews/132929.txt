I'm doing the slower-cooker version of this recipe, which means I used more chicken, cut it into bite size pieces, sauteed in frying pan and then moved to crock pot.  Assembled the rest of the recipe and simply poured it on top (added garlic, chopped red pepper, and used lemon instead of lime juice).  The house smells like heaven and the chicken tastes amazing!  I'll serve over Trader Joe's vegetable rice.  So good!!!

Oh my goodness, thank you SO MUCH Shannon for sharing this wonderfully fragrant and tasty dish! I did not alter any of the ingredients, and it was absolutely delicious as is. It is definitely definitely mild on the "heat" aspect, but adding cayenne or red pepper flakes could easily fix that. I only made two alterations when it came to preparing this recipe: I marinated it for six hours, and I did not grill the skewers. I poured the chicken bites and all the marinated into a large glass dish, covered it with tinfoil, and baked it at 325 degrees for about an hour. The result was incredibly tender and juicy. An absolutely delicious and easy to make dish!!

My dear sweet Shannon; we all loved this dish of yours! Rainy, chilly and foggy today, so I just skewered the chix and put them in the oven with the marinade. I used lite coconut milk, made thin spaghetti, added shredded cooked carrots, raw green onion, some of the wonderful dipping sauce, put it all onto a pretty plate and topped it with the skewers. A bit of red pepper flakes gave the sauce just a tad of heat. Excellent and thank you hon!!

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  I developed a peanut allergy as an adult, but grew up with peanut butter as my favorite food.  I finally found an almond butter that tastes exactly like peanut butter, and couldn't wait to use in this recipe.  It was unbelieveable!  I could make this recipe once or twice a week and never tire of it.  I served this over brown rice.  Amazing.

Beats Emeril's recipe!  I love this peanut sauce.  Today I didn't have the time to marinate the chicken - just did a quick soy sauce and garlic soak before stir frying it.  But the sauce is the real star here anyway.  It's a perfect blend of flavors.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and added some ginger and chili sauce - simply delicious!  Since I only cook for 2, there's plenty of sauce left over which I'll probably toss with angle hair pasta tomorrow night.  Thanks for sharing this winner - it's my new favorite Thai Peanut Sauce recipe!

I was wondering why I didn't already have curry powder in my spice rack when I decided to make this recipe, then I realized...I don't like curry!  That being said, I didn't mind it in the marinade, but I tasted the sauce as it was cooking and realized it was not going to do it for me, so I added 1 1/2 tsp chile sauce, a dash of red pepper flakes and about a teaspoon of minced ginger.   Finished it off with lime and it was excellent!  Next time I will omit the curry powder from the sauce, but still use it in the marinade just to give it a hint of curry flavor.  Still, I think it was an excellent recipe.

Fantastic I did add some red pepper to the peanut sauce and some ginger to the marinade.  I used the indoor grill, I do think they lost something in appearance but the taste was superb.

The marinade and chicken part was delicious and resulted in a very moist and tender chicken. I will definiitely use that again. But... My family did not like the peanut sauce at all. It just tasted like peanut butter flavored coconut milk... not at all like satay's that we have enjoyed a lot. After tweaking the dipping sauce (a lot),with more soy, cayenne, heavy cream, ginger, black pepper, garlic and I can't remember what else, I loved it. I served over Jasmine rice and a stir fry of snow peas, red onion, yellow squash, brocolli, and mushrooms. Even though we didn't like the peanut sauce as written, I feel we found a recipe *treasure* because it was so easy and delicious. I will make over and over again with our changes.

Super easy and super yummy.  Try basting the skewered chicken with some of the peanut sauce while it is grilling and serve the remainder of the sauce at tableside.

Loved by all! So easy without a bunch of crazy ingredients I didn't have. Everything in this recipe I keep around so it was great!

This did taste like an authentic satay and was so flavorful. I didn't change anything. I did marinate the meat overnight. 

The peanut sauce was great. It was not runny at all and it had a good nutty flavor. Most Thai places don't give you a thicker peanut sauce- it's supposed to be a medium consistency.

The whole dish was delish! I served it with Thai Cucumber Salad and Lime Cilantro Jasmine Rice.

Excellent and easy dish with a beautiful fragrance that fills up the kitchen. 

Thanks for sharing- definitely a keeper!

I would give this 10 stars if I could. I have made this many times now and it's the only recipe I use for peanut sauce. There's not a better sauce out there than this one. I have marinated it overnight, and also made it the same day, and it has a much better flavor leaving it overnight. I cook the chicken on a stovetop grill pan on low so they cook thoroughly without browning too much, then turn up the heat towards the end to get a caramelized finished product. These are perfect!!!

As an Indonesian, I grew up with chicken satay vendors around the neighbourhood. 
Honestly, this recipe is a bit too complicated from what I'm used to. However, I do understand that most of the ingredients used in my people's traditional recipe might not be available in your country. Great recipe though.

The peanut sauce is the star of this recipe. Really, really good. I loved what the curry added to the flavor. The marinade imparts a subtle savoriness to the chicken, and in no way competes with the bold flavor of the sauce. My only complaint with this recipe is the amount of marinade it makes. My chicken was really drowning in it, and I dislike waste, so I would cut it in half next time. I also had easily half the recipe of sauce leftover as well, but I froze the remainder for next time, which will make putting together this recipe even easier.

Tremendously tasty and savory chicken, and the peanut butter sauce....divine!  I used the leftover sauce (it makes a lot) and mixed it in with pasta, chicken, scallions, cucumber and cilantro.  This dish is amazing and is definitely going in my 5 star recipe book.

This is award winnning!!!  I made these along with some flank steak skewers in a teriyaki marinade but these went faster than the beef. The peanut sauce is addicting!  Served with Asian Chicken Salad from this site and chow mein. Don't forget to soak your wooden skewers in water before using to avoid burning on the grill.

This recipe was perfect! Added lemongrass seasoning from Penzy spices to the marinade and it added a lot of flavor. I have had many satay recipes and this is the best, well done!

I was expecting the chicken to come out rubbery because I haven't mastered the art of my Foreman grill, however, it was so moist and delicious.
That said. 
The peanut sauce made way too much sauce and it was like peanut butter soup, even after adding recommended changes. 
But the chicken alone was delicious. Definitely on the we're having that again list.

Yummy! Both my hubs and I enjoy eating Thai food, so it was no surprise that we liked this - A LOT! I'm SO happy I can add Shannon's recipe to my "keeper" file. :) Not only was this super easy to prepare, it delivered big on flavor! I pretty much followed Shannon's directions to the letter except for a couple of very minor changes. Instead of marinating my chicken for only 2 hours, I marinated it for nearly 6. I also subbed chicken tenders for breasts (I found it much easier than cutting into strips). My final change was brushing each kabob with a bit of peanut sauce before taking them off the (indoor) grill. My only criticism is that I had WAAAY too much sauce for 3/4 lb. meat. I could have easily halved it and STILL ended up with far too much. NOTE: The peanut sauce is blah on its own, but PHENOMENOL when drizzled over each kabob. Served with jasmine rice and naan, this was a GREAT meal. Thanks for sharing, Shannon! :-)

Fantastic flavor. I use 1/2 the amount of peanut butter- the full amount is too sweet and too much peanut for me. I also add ginger and garlic chili paste to the sauce. It tastes as authentic as a dish from a southeast Asian restaurant....

I made this for a large party of 30 people (60 skewers) and everyone raved about the recipe- it was the hit of the party, even more so than the filet tenderloin we served! Per the other reviews (and my personal taste), I modified this recipe slightly. I added the following to both the marinade and to the satay sauce: I used "Lite" coconut milk, red curry paste instead of the curry powder (find in the ethnic foods / Asian section of most large grocery stores), fresh ginger and lemongrass paste (find both in a refrigerated squeeze tube in the produce section of most large grocery stores), cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes, Lawry's seasoning salt(I use this to bring out flavor in everything I cook) and fresh ground pepper. I also added a little white sugar to sweeten the satay sauce a bit, as well as some cornstarch to thicken slightly and to give the sauce a 'glossy' look. 

I made vegetable skewers to serve alongside the chicken with a simple balsamic vinegarette marinade (just bottled salad dressing). Overall, with the flavor-enhancing additions, this is a definite keeper! So many people asked for the recipe, I have to send out an email to the guests of the party! This works great for a crowd, as you can easily adjust the serving sizes online. We will keep this recipe on rotation at our house!

My kids loved this - and they're hard to please! The only thing I would change is to put a little less curry powder and a little more peanut butter in the sauce next time. Served with rice noodles, blanched  snow pea pods, shaved carrot, cucumber strips, diced scallion, cilantro, and a dressing made with soy sauce, rice vinegar, and brown sugar - people combined the elements to their taste.

This was very good! I used 'lite' coconut milk, which I didnt know existed until I went shopping, and it was very tasty. The sauce is easy to make and yummy. Even better the next day. A keeper!

I went to Mumbia on a business trip this past year and had the hotel's Chicken Satay with peanut sauce...I ordered it about 4 times because I was totally taken with it.  Lately I've been trying to find an easy recipe online that would come close to duplicating this and I found this one.  I've tried it once, grilled the chicken skewers onto foil with hickory chips smoking on the side.  It turned out awesome.  I let it drown with the peanut sauce in foil for about 5-8 minutes before eating...ate the whole thing.  In the future I think I will cut out about 1/3 of the brown sugar and use natural peanut butter in the sauce, ended up being a little bit more sugar then I remember.  Anyway, all said still a very good recipe to grow on.  Thanks Shannon!

The sauce has a great taste but def needs some heat. I added red pepper flakes and next time will add even more. I also added chopped cilantro to the marinade and it was delish.

This was very good! I cut the chicken into chunks (skewers+3yr old=scary) added some veggies (stir fry) and pasta. Drizzled some of the "Warm Peanut Sauce" from the site on top. Everyone loved it!

I never had chicken satay before so I had no opinion before making this.  I am not a fan of chicken breast but this is a wonderful way to cook it.  Everything was perfect except there is enough dipping sauce for five pounds of chicken.  Saw where someone was freezing it so I will also.  A new taste and recipe which everyone loved.

I had some leftover Indian spiced baked chicken breasts that I wanted to use up. I was looking for an Indian sauce recipe that I could simmer them in - and preferably one made with coconut milk. When I saw this recipe made with all ingredients that I like, and it's great reviews, I knew I had what I was looking for. Since I already had cooked and seasoned chicken, I only made the sauce portion of this. After tasting it, I knew I wanted a little heat to balance out the sweetness so I added a 1/4 tsp of cayenne. That was just the right amount for me. Once the sauce was thickened, I cut up my cooked chicken and simmered it in the sauce until heated through. I served it over some leftover rice. Creamy and delicious. I will be trying this again.

3/4 lb was barely enough chicken for me and my husband. Have put into the regular rotation! made in frying pan. Chicken wasn't dry, sauce was good on rice w/pineapple. (I made rice with some of the coconut milk + pineapple juice from the can) I also recommend using "rooster sauce" ;) spicy!

I actually altered the marinade. I left out the garlic. I also used tilapia, a white fish. The sauce I kept intact. It was a good start, but not quite strong enough for my tastes. I would add a little more spice and some raw peanuts. they make a good crunch. Otherwise, a good peanut sauce recipe

This was incredible, the BBQ failed, but my convection oven did it justice.  Marinated overnight, and served to 15, then again the leftovers after church today for 20+ - made enough for 30 originally.  Travels easily.  WOW the Satay sauce was so good, people were consuming it as a soup.  THIS WAS FANTASTIC and so easy!  Loved it!

Fabulous. I didn't have curry powder so used curry paste. I cut it back to 1/2 for the sauce so the kids could eat it. About 1/3 would be just right for them (3 and 5 yr old).

This was so good!  What a great change of pace!  I wish it had a little more kick since it is sweet from the coconut.... a little kick would complete the taste!  Yummy!  We ended up having to broil it since our grill went out on us... but the chicken was SO tender and good!

So delicious.  The marinade kept the chicken nice and moist.  This is the best satay recipe I have tried, and I have tried many.  (Most have nice peanut sauces but the marinades are weak.)  I added some crushed red pepper to the sauce.  Awesome.

Fantastic! A few shortcuts are available that don't compromise the flavor. Quick version: Sautee the chicken in the marinade until well cooked then dump the ingredients for the sauce in with the chicken and marinade and cook another 5 minutes. Serve the chicken and sauce on plates of raw lettuce and cucumbers topped with rice.

So good! I ran out of time for grilling as kabobs - I'm sure that's outstanding and can't wait to try it - so I baked covered at 350* for about an hour. I would suggest taking the cover off at some point; we ended up warming leftovers on the stove and pouring the dipping sauce over the chicken. Super tender and great flavor! Very filling when served with rice!

This got rave reviews!!  I didn't eat it as I am vegetarian but I made it as a special treat for my non-veggie husband and family.  It was inhaled!  I was complimented especially on the sauce.  I did add some chili flakes to that and some ginger to the marinade.  Cooked them on the indoor grill with good results but I know they would be even better on the BBQ.  Will definitely make again, everyone seemed to love them!  Thanks!!

This was just ok...despite the number of ingredients in the sauce, it just didn't have a lot of taste...was sort of one note and even additional lime juice didn't cut the richness of the peanut butter. My daughter much preferred a different satay recipe that we tried last week, so we'll stick with that.

I used the crock pot recipe suggested by Clearview and it worked great. The chicken wasn't too soft and the sauce was good. I've had a lot of peanut themed chicken dishes at Indian recipes and this is getting there. I've tried lots at home, all the others were barely edible. This is the best at home recipe and considering it's also easy I'm going to give it 5 stars. I did add cayenne and in the future would add more. Don't omit the lemon juice, you won't taste it and you need something to cut the peanut butter flavor.

This was just OK.  The peanut sauce lacked something, maybe some ginger, and it was way too sweet.  Won't be making again.

This chicken is OMG good!!!  I used light coconut milk to cut the calories.  I can only imagine how wonderful it would have been with regular!  Other than that I made it exactly as written.  I thought the peanut sauce was only ok but my husband thought it was wonderful.  Next time I will experiment with the marinade recipe to make a dipping sauce from that and servce both.  I served this with white rice cooked in fat free chicken broth and cucumber salad dressed lightly with equal parts rice wine vinegar and sugar and just a pinch of dried basil (b/c I didn't have fresh.  So so so good.  I made 2 lbs of chicken and I think there was enough marinade for at least 4 lbs.  I cut the peanut sauce in half and there was still too much for us.  Next time I'll make 1/4 recipe or less.   I can't wait to make this again!

This was so yummy! I only had time to let the chicken marinate for a half hour, and I forgot to add the soy sauce and lemon/lime juice; and it still tasted awesome! :D

I'm not sure why I tried this recipe.   I don't like peanut sauce, and my husband doesn't like curry or coconut milk.  But we all loved this.  I reduced the curry to 1 tsp in the peanut sauce, afraid that my husband wouldn't like it if he could taste the curry.  It grilled perfectly, and the sauce was sweet and terrific.  We will definitely have this again.

OMG- delicious and easy! We will be making again! Because a can of coconut milk is more than 1 1/2 cups, I used the rest of the can in the sauce, and didn't have skewers, so I used a grill pan to cook the chicken.  waste not want not! I could see adding a touch of heat, red peppers perhaps, but it's very flavorful as is.  We   ate it over jasmine rice with chopped salad. Thanks Shannon!

No leftovers...I did add minced ginger to the marinade and cayenne pepper to the sauce.  This was amazing with coconut rice and grilled veggies.  Next time I will double the recipe!

this was REALLY tasty and very easy to prepare. I added more red curry powder to the sauce because of we like it a bit more spice.

I can't rate this recipe highly enough! It was flavorful, easy, and delicious. I only marinated the chicken for an hour and it was still moist and tasty. Also, I added some red chili flakes to make it a bit spicier, and added some cornstarch to the dipping sauce to make it thicker and easier to dip.

Ooohh...I liked this. :) We aren't very familiar with Thai food but always looking for something new to us. My whole family enjoyed this. I couldn't really get my head around the peanut butter sauce, but oh yeah....Super tasty. The only thing I did differently was broiled the chicken. (I didn't realize we were out of charcoal) I made this with Emeril's Vegetable Curry and Basmati Rice, and it was a great sweet & spicy combination. There was a lot of sauce leftover though, so I froze it. We'll see how it tastes later, but next time I will probably make a half recipe of the sauce instead. Thank you for this recipe! Loved it! :)

This was very good. We added a tsp of red crushed chilli flakes to make it have a little bit for kick. It could also use a tad less curry for our tastes in the sauce. But over all, a great meal! I served the sauce and chicken over glassy bean noodles.

This sauce was a hit, and really simple to make. Using the George Forman Grill wasn't the best, since I just have a small one and the marinade starts to burn on it, but that's my own issue. It was also a lot more sauce than we needed...but that's fine with us.

Okay, normally I usually follow recipes exactly the way they are suggested... But I read this and was like, this would make an amazing curry dish. 

I followed it exactly the same ingredients, but turned it into a curry dish, instead of skewers. I sautéed the chicken with some onions and veggies, then let it simmer in the sauce. 

I thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch. And added a dash of red pepper. But I tasted it before the red pepper (suggested by other reviewers) and it was still pretty good. 

But my God, this sauce was legit divine. I'm not sure if its because I have been super hungry or because I'm pregnant... But this was amazing. I just finished eating it and was like, must write review! Now! 

My 4 year old doesn't eat anything that has flavor. But she ate this like it was candy.

Delicious!! I doubled the recipe and threw everything in a crockpot. I didn't have coconut milk so I used half almond milk, quarter milk, quarter sour cream. Served with rice. Amazing meal! We will definitely make it again! Next time. I'll probably halve the sauce ingredients since I didn't need quite that much.

I made this in the slow cooker. It took 7 minutes to prepare and our family loved it, including my one-year old son. I put all the ingredients in together, put in frozen chicken breasts and set the timer for 5 hours, then kept it on warm for another hour.

This dish was super easy to make and delicious! The only recommendation I would have is to make the peanut sauce when you are grilling the chicken. The mistake I made was making the sauce right after popping the chicken in the refrigerator for marinade and leaving the sauce made for two hours.

I had previously made some Satay chicken based on a pre-packaged mix that was given to me, but when I went to buy another mix at the store, I was horrified at the list of ingredients (sugar, peanuts, with the only exotic spice being lemongrass). This recipe appealed to me because of its lack of exotic ingredients: I don't typically stock fish paste, lemongrass, etc. 

I followed the ingredient list pretty closely, although I never measure quantities and just estimated. I did use my whole 3-lb. bag of chicken tenders. That suited the sauce exactly, as other reviewers have mentioned that the recipe makes too much sauce. Also, I avoid sugar as much as possible, so I used honey instead (maybe a few tablespoons?), and added a pinch of chili pepper. We had plenty for our whole family (two adults, four smallish kids) with leftovers.

We don't grill, so I baked the chicken (not even cut up) in a glass pan in the oven at 400 for an hour or so. I hate waste, so I just dumped the marinade in the pan with the chicken, mixed up the sauce, and poured that over the chicken. The sauce was bubbling when I took it out, and we served it over rice noodles. Delicious, and so simple to make! I'm adding this one to my recipe box.

Great Recipe....highly recommend marinating overnight or as long as possible. I went 8hr and the chicken was very tender and flavorful. The sauce is excellent. Nice easy and tasty dish.

Not a lot of depth of flavor but good. Definitely add ginger. Use half as much brown sugar as called for in the dipping sauce (this is a bit too sweet for peanut sauce).

Was a hit with my family. I didn't marinate the chicken, not enough time tonight. But it was still good. The peanut sauce could make a cardboard box taste good.

My 14 yr old said, "This is REALLY good! Restaurant quality!" I agree. So tasty! The only change I made was adding some cilantro at the end.

We've made this dish at least a half-dozen times now and it's just delicious every time! The only thing I do differently is add garlic and ginger to the sauce. This is a perfect summer recipe! Thank you so much!

I didn't make this chicken satay, but I did make the warm peanut sauce. It's really yummy, it does make a lot, so you could cut it in half. Our asian neighbors asked me how I made it because they loved it so much.

Fantastic!  This was a huge hit!  Since I wasn't able to grill the skewers I baked them at 350 for about 50 minutes (40 covered + 10-15 uncovered).  After marinading overnight, I put the chicken on pre-soaked skewers and baked in the marinade.  The chicken was so tender and moist it practically fell off the skewers and the presentation was terrific.  Served with the Asian coconut rice found on this site.  Will definitely add to my hosting rotation!

This recipe was super-easy to make. The chicken was succulent and delicious, and the sauce was just incredible. I served as lettuce wraps with fresh romaine and extra sauce on the side for dipping. I even used crunchy peanut butter (all we had). I asked my husband for suggestions for next time, his response: "Make more." My 4-year-old loved these, as well!

not sure if I did something wrong.  Marinated for 2.5 hours, But this was so bland.  The marinade smelled great but didn't taste like the chicken had been cooked in anything and the dipping sauce was terrible.  I threw it out and my husband eats pretty much anything.

I had really high hopes for this based on other reviews but this turned out just ok for us.  The chicken was kind of bland and the peanut sauce was average.  Will not make again.  The peanut sauce from one of the Thai salads on this site is so much better.

This was a great dish!  The flavor was delicious - just enough flavor by itself but great with the peanut sauce, too.  Loved how easy it was to make such delicious peanut sauce-- I added the juice of 2.5 limes to the sauce.

However, I feel like the serving size is off - I used 1.5 lbs of chicken (3 chicken breasts) and it served 3 people with only a tad bit of chicken left over.  (I made 1.5x the recipe for the marinade for the 1.5lbs of chicken.)  I served the chicken with about 3/4-1 cup of the Asian Coconut Rice posted by SILVREZS.  

The recipe for the peanut dipping sauce made PLENTY and there is no need to double - after 3 of us had eaten I had about 2 cups of the sauce left.  I plan to use it for dressing for a thai salad along with some cilantro-lime dressing.

Great if you love mild! If you like spicy, add 1/2 (or more, depending on how spicy you want it) teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the sauce and the marinade. Otherwise DONT TOUCH THE RECIPE!

Excellent! We had a friend over and I made this for dinner. It's incredibly easy to make and tastes just like the satay at the expensive Asian restaurant my husband and I like to visit in Cleveland! This is the only recipe for satay I will ever use! I served it with rice and broccoli.

I also basted the chicken in the sauce as it was cooking because there was so much sauce made.  Will need to find a use for the rest of it before it goes off.

Was really tasty! Everyone loved it. I added ginger to the marinade and a dash of red cayenne pepper. To the sauce some red pepper flakes. Next time I think I'll reduce the brown sugar a little bit. It was a little too sweet for me. But my hubby and daughter didn't complain.

Excellent the way it is!  Just like a restaurant dinner!  I added ginger to the marinade and grilled 3 pounds of chicken. Still enough marinade no need to double the recipe.  Served with jasmine rice and sauteed onion,red pepper and zucchini.

Very, very tasty.......but not particularly "easy".  My Oriental grocery has Thai canned curry paste in red, green and yellow.  Pick your heat intensity!
I had only eaten some skewers of this meat one time before but these rivaled those.  Served this with Chinese-style Broccoli Salad from this site, Thai cucumber salad (here as well) and steamed Jasmine rice.  Altogether a very nice meal but time consuming.

Very good.  I used 1.5lb of chicken thighs and there was enough marinade without increasing the ingredients.  I used natural peanut butter so I had to add extra salt and sugar to make up for it.  I bbq'd the thighs without skewers then poured the sauce over and garnished with fresh cilantro, definitely add the cilantro.  Tastes and looks great.

This was really delicious. I made it into a chicken and rice sort of curry instead of using skewers (didn't have them) and the peanut sauce was excellent. I remember reading somewhere that you can't make good peanut sauce with peanut butter... well, I disagree because this one tasted really good! Thanks! :D

I made this pretty much as written and we and our guests loved it. I have leftovers and I think I will have no problem getting folks to eat that up as well. The peanut sauce was way yummy.

I added some diced spanish chili. I also forgot to add soy and lime, we just loved this! I remembered half way through and added some but we didn't think it was any better with the soy.

This was Fantastic! I had to cook in a pinch so I wasn't able to marinate the chicken for the whole 2 hours. I only did it for a half hour and it came out perfect! Thank you for a wonderful dish!  :0)

My family enjoyed this very much which does not happen often. I did not put the chicken on skewers, I marinated the chicken and put it in the oven in the marinade as other reviewers did. I also added broccoli and shredded carrot and served with whole grain rice. Thanks for the recipe I will be using this again!

Why, why, why, did I wait so long to make this recipe. This wonderful meal was sitting in my recipe box for ages.  So glad I finally used it. I also just baked these tid bits in the oven. (it was a rainy day) and added garlic because we LOVE garlic, other than that I made as exactly written, turned out DELISH.

I don't think I've ever had Thai food and wanted to try this out to pair it with the coconut rice.  I loved this!  Even the dip was good and not overly sweet.  Husband (non-adventure eater) did not like it.

This recipe is fantastic! Very easy to prepare, perfect chicken, and great dipping sauce.  We had a huge BBQ on Fathers Day. I made burgers, dogs, and this chicken (one of my favorite dishes when we eat Thai). I did NOT tell my MIL that there was curry in the dish (she claims even the slightest hint will make her vomit), and she devoured at least 5 skewers on her own, hehe!  Also, my BIL thought the dipping sauce was salad dressing, he said it was fantastic on the salad :P

Very good flavor. I made this for a party so I cut up the chicken into little pieces and made mini skewers. That was time consuming but the presentation was cool. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that I ended up with way too much sauce for the amound of chicken I had to put it on. Seemed like a waste.

This was very good.  But I think it could have been better.  It didn't wind up thick enough, so I added more peanut butter... which worked out well b/c it wasn't peanut butter-y enough for me initially.  Next time, I'll cut back on the chicken stock for sure.  I also may add some scallions.  I think that would be a nice touch.  And red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper at the end to give it a little punch.  I don't even like spicy foods, but this could have used just a bit of a kick.  But it was easy enough and tasty.  I'd give it another try for sure.  Everyone else seemed to like it as well.

Love this recipe. I never do the chicken on the skewers, just let it marinate a bit, then cook it together with the sauce.

This was really good.  I must have used too much chicken stock in the peanut sauce because it came out a bit runny but it was still really good.  Even my little guys liked it, which is saying a lot.

Delicious! I made this exactly as stated and the entire family LOVED it. Next time I will cut the dipping sauce recipe in half OR double the chicken & marinade part, because they didn't even out (way too much sauce). Other than that, GREAT recipe. I made Jasmine rice to go with this, by the way. Yum.

Pretty good--the chicken was great with rice, but the sauce has too much peanut butter taste--more peanut butter sauce than peanut sauce if that makes sense. Overall, it was tasty and very easy to make. Be sure to oil the skewers so the chicken doesn't stick. I think kids would like the sauce as is.

This is delicious! My 3 yr old daughter is extremely picky; this is a great, easy recipe to make at home that she eats, which is hard to find! We left out curry powder just because we didn't have any, but still delicious. Awesome recipe- try it!

This recipe is great!..  My first attempt I didn't soak my skewers and they burnt up on the BBQ... I've since then used metal ones.  Sometimes I'll make this under the broiler.  This is my youngest sons favorite meal!   The sauce is delicious over streamed rice too!

Fantastic recipe! the chicken was very tender, and the flavor of the sauce was peanutty and good! I had to eliminate the garlic (food allergies of my guests), and it still turned out delicious! The recipe made enough marinade to cover double the chicken, and plenty of left over peanut sauce. My family loved it! Thank you!

This recipe was delicious -  even better than our local Thai restaurant! I broiled the chicken skewers instead of grilling, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It was a hit with the whole family. I will definitely make this one again and again.

The recipe seemed to be for much more chicken than listed.  The sauce was too liquidy (I did make a mistake, but I don't think it would have been much different without the slight mistake). I ended up buying dipping sauce instead.  The chicken flavor itself was pretty unimpressive.   Not a recipe I will save or share

The chicken didn't have much flavor, even after marinading for 5 hours. Perhaps I should have left it longer. The peanut sauce was really good, but it was thin and made much more than we needed. I added some extra peanut butter to thicken it up and let it simmer a bit longer than the recipe said.

Definitely will make it again!  Marinated it for about three hours and  the chicken was so tender.  My wife, a trained chef, said it is one that will have to go on my (limited) repertoire.

WOW!!! This dish was a hit with my family. First, we lived in LA for a long time and Thai was our favorite delivery food and chicken satay was always on the list. We now live in a very small town on the southern coast of Oregon and there is no Thai within many many miles. 
I tried this dish, hoping and praying it would satisfy our craving and it did! Flavors so similar to our favorite restaurant in LA.
Instead of skewering the meat, I pounded the chicken flat and fried them like little chicken steaks, served over pineapple rice with the peanut sauce drizzled over  the top- superb!
The peanut sauce is so good that once I tasted it during the cooking process, I immediately doubled the recipe. I knew my family would go crazy for it, and they did. Seconds were had and we still have leftovers.

This was fantastic!  The sauce did it for me; the only change i made was using a bit more peanut butter.  It made way more sauce than i thought it would - enough for the chicken and as a rice topper and then some. So good...

Made this with light coconut milk instead of full fat. The only other thing I did differently was to pound the chicken flat to 1/4" after cutting 1" strips. Left it in the marinade for 18 hours. Came out amazing. Great recipe. 
Peanut sauce makes way too much.  Double the chicken recipe or half the sauce for better proportions.

We made this recipe a few times on the grill and it's always been delicious!

Just recently, we ended up stir frying the chicken, since on our last grocery delivery, we were given diced chicken instead of chicken breasts.   After marinating the chicken for a few hours, we stir fried it in olive oil on medium-high heat  for about 6 minutes, then simmered on low for 2 more minutes and it was delicious even though it didn't have the grilled flavor.

I doubled the recipe for both the satay sticks and the peanut sauce.   We have enough peanut sauce for another double batch or more.    I left the marinade on the chicken for about 18 hours.  I followed the recipe exactly.   They were delicious.   My son suggested the peanut sauce could use a little heat, spice.  I think I will add a teaspoon of red curry paste when I warm it up.  I will definitely make this again.   Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was as easy, as the title suggests, and tasty. My 2 and 4 year old even mixed together the ingredients for the peanut sauce while I skewered the chicken.

Everyone at our church group loved it. Sauce was gritty because I made it the day before. But it was delicious!! It was snowing so we couldn’t grill it, but it cooked well on a grill pan.

My family said this is the best meal I ever made! I wanted to follow the recipe as close as possible, and made exceptions only based on need, such as substituting coconut milk for low-fat milk plus coconut oil.  baked at 325 for 1 hour instead of grilling and basted with peanut sauce in last 20 min of cooking. Served with brown basmati rice and julienned carrots and finished with sesame seeds. Thank you!

Great recipe!  It tasted just like a restaurant with only a little tweeking.  I sauteed fresh ginger, garlic, and oil with the curry powder before adding the rest of the ingredients to the sauce.  At the end I added a dash of sriracha.   Heaven!  Thanks for the recipe!

4 stars because I made a few changes, but  this is lovely. I use 1.25 to 1.5 lb of boneless thighs with the same amount of marinade and sauce. I also doubled the garlic and increased the curry seasoning by 1/3 in both the marinade and the sauce. Finally, I use a 1/2 & 1/2 blend of coconut sugar and Sola sweetener to cut some of the carbs. (I cook for a type 2 diabetic and every carbohydrate counts!) With all that said, this is good when cooked under the broiler or even in a sauté pan, but better on the charcoal grill. Terrific pairing: coconut-lime rice from elsewhere on this site.

I am well versed in a number of cuisines, but Thai is not one of them. Therefore I followed recipe as directed (I would normally adjust it according to my taste). This was “meh” at best in my opinion. However, I was able to salvage this by adding a jar of green curry sauce from Trader Joe’s and some peanut butter. Then served it on a bed of coconut + cilantro rice. I took this to a Family Olympics party as we’d been assigned to represent Thailand. Everyone there enjoyed it greatly so not all was lost. But I will not make again. I will enjoy my local Thai restaurant when my cravings hit.

I used the recipe for the chicken marinade and then used  a locally made Indonesian peanut satay sauce for dipping.  The marinade is awesome. The chicken was very tender.  Will make it again for sure!

Omigosh, sooo good! Subbed in molasses and chunky peanut butter for brown sugar and creamy pub in the brown sauce, because that's what was in the house. Reduced the sauce a little longer, to make a thicker sauce. Used thighs instead of breasts, because we like dark meat, and marinated two days in the fridge. Broiled instead of outdoor grill, because of rain. I bet it would've been even better on the grill.  We used liberal amounts of sauce and still had about a cup or so left. I'm saving it to use as dipping sauce with veggies, or to dress up veggie soup. So good I could eat just the sauce, with a spoon!

Loved the marinade flavor! I only half used this recipe and pan cooked the chk with the marinade and used it as a "sauce" over rice.  Would totally do this again.

Very tender, flavorful chicken. I think next time, I'd add more heat or even a bit of fresh lime juice to the marinade. But everyone really enjoyed this dish.

This is such a great recipe! I didn't follow it to a tee. I ended up doing a crock pot version of this with split chicken breasts I got on sale. What an amazing dish! I made the peanut sauce separately as directed. I put the shredded chicken over riced cauliflower and added a drizzle of the peanut sauce. Tastes just like the original recipe, just cooked differently. Great job and thank you for posting this!

Wow what a great recipe! I marinated overnight and I drenched my rice with the left over peanut sauce. I think next time I will follow other reviewers and baste chicken with peanut sauce while grilling. Definitely a remake.

I followed the recipe exactly.   Very easy to make and good and flavorful.   My sides were plain, white rice with fresh green onions sprinkled on top and sliced cucumber with a little seasoned rice vinegar & sesame seed oil.   We did not have any leftovers... always a good sign!

Opted to pan fry the strips of chicken breast in a little butter rather than grill.   Other than changing the recipe for 3 people, followed the recipe.  Totally enjoyed it!

I made the recipe exactly as stated.  For me, I had way more peanut sauce than needed for the chicken.  My peanut sauce was too sweet -- maybe the peanut butter I used was too sweet (could be my fault).

My sister is the one who first made this for me and we loved it. We even had to start marinating a second batch when we realized we had eaten almost all of it! We compliment it with basmati rice and broccoli florets with a little leftover lemon squeezed on top. We also add a little sriracha to the sauce for an extra kick. Oh, and we always double the recipe!

Chicken was fine and all ate, but my picky eaters did not like the sauce so if I make it again I'll find a different kind of  sauce.

So great this is one my all time new favorite recipes! Luckily for the sauce I did half the amount of curry powder the recipe called for because even that was slightly too much for my weak palate. But all in all this is a wonderful dish!

I've made these at least 10 times and great every time! I cut down a lot on the broth to give a thicker sauce. I use chunky peanutbutter - just because.

Pretty much made half volume as per recipe, 
only difference was, the peanut butter I wanted to use up already had added sugar (which is why i wanted to cook with it :)) so I left the sugar in the sauce  out.
ended up marinating for 24 hours.
really nice and easy, will be keeping this one
thank you

Halved the amount of curry in the marinade and omitted the curry altogether in the dipping sauce.  The coconut milk and the hint of curry gave the chicken an exotic, savory flavor when marinaded over night and browned beautifully on the grill. Dipping sauce without the curry was okay... Will look for another recipe for the dipping sauce.

Served with Vietnamese spring rolls for lunch on a warm, sunny day. Perfect combo.

Very good peanut sauce. I just cut the chicken breast in half and grilled it up after marinating for two hours. The marinade was okay after two hours but it tasted like it would be better if the chicken marinade for several hours longer. This is definitely on the regular dinner list due to ease and tastiness.

My family thought this was delicious! I made a box of pad thai along with it, and some carrots. Yum. There was way more peanut sauce than we needed, though, so I will make half or even less when I make it again. I used 2 lbs. of chicken and there was plenty of marinade to cover it all. Will make again soon!

We loved this recipe.  It was easy to make, and delicious.  Since we like things a little spicy, I followed other reviewers suggestions, and added a little cayenne and red pepper flakes to the sauce, as well as some freshly grated ginger-root.  Served it over brown rice.  I'll definitely be making this again, with the same modifications.

This was very good!  I added chopped cilantro to the marinade.  I also topped the satay skewers and sauce with chopped cilantro and peanuts.

Changes: used skinless, boneless chicken thigh instead of chicken breast. Added equal amounts of red pepper powder to marinade and peanut sauce. Marinaded chicken for 6 hours--cooked chicken and marinade together in a pan instead of grilling. I added the cooked down marinade to the coconut milk, peanut butter, sugar, and spice mixture--omitting the stock and soy sauce. Served with stir fry onions, peppers, and broccoli and zucchini noodles. This dish was amazing.

Yes, this recipe was fairly easy, but more importantly, it was delicious!  I also really appreciated the fact that the recipe makes a GENEROUS amount of the peanut sauce which is my favorite part of the recipe. I could eat that stuff with a spoon! I served it with Jasmine Rice and steamed green beans.

I don't eat Asian food very often, so I've never had foods other people eat often at restaurants. I found this recipe and wanted to try it. I put the chicken in the marinade yesterday, but because of circumstances, wasn't able to fix it until today. So it was in the marinade over 24 hours. And because it was raining, I cooked it on my cast iron grill pan on the stove top. Oh. My. Goodness. Best, most flavorful chicken ever! I will marinate my chicken like this again, even if I don't make the sauce to go with it. But the sauce is wonderful! It started out in a bowl for me to dip the chicken in, but I eventually just poured it over the chicken and rice on my plate. Absolutely delicious!

Really yummy, even better with a bit of red curry paste mixed in (1-2 tsp). I didn't grill my chicken with skewers, I kept the ingredients the same (plus red curry paste) and made like a stir fry and had it with rice and veges. So good!

Yum! This was SO good. I will definitely be making this again! The chicken tasted great, even without the sauce, but the sauce is amazing. The only thing I added was some red pepper flakes to the sauce to give it a little heat, but the flavor was wonderful. Thank you so much for this great recipe!

We made this exactly as written and it was tender and delicious. The peanut sauce is mild and so compelling. Our family of 5 have decided this should go into the normal dinner rotation even in winter.

We really enjoyed this recipe as did our friends.  I doubled everything to serve 6 people.  I just want to make sure people know that doubling the sauce is not necessary unless you are planning to drink it! I suppose if this is going to be your dinner and you want to sauce rice or noodles you may need 1 and 1/2 times the recipe, but I definitely could have done with just one sauce recipe.

Really, really good.  Don't forget to enjoy chicken on it's own, and double the recipe to have some delicious peanut sauce for the fridge!  I added some powdered ginger, some cayenne pepper and a bit more lime juice to the sauce to spice it up a bit.

Love this recipe!  It was delicious and my family loved it.  I think I would cut the sauce in half.  Too much for us.

Yummy!  I admit that I didn't make the peanut sauce because I had some store bought sauce from Trader Joe's, but the chicken was delicious!  I broiled mine.  Next time, I'll make the peanut sauce also.  I'm sure it would've been better than the store bought stuff.  This one is a keeper, for sure!

This is super simple and truly tasty. We've also made chicken sandwiches using boneless skinless chicken thighs, marinating the meat in the peanut sauce as well as the original marinade that the recipe calls for.

It is delicious!

Made this for dinner today. Delish!  I used light coconut milk, and upscaled the marinade quantities so that I'd use the whole can of coconut milk for this meal. I sautéed the chicken in the marinade. And served it 'rice bowl' style over a bed of spinach with some quinoa. The spinach wilts under the hot food. The flavor wasn't quite strong enough to compete with the spinach--maybe I'd use baby spinach next time. But I wouldn't down-star a recipe for changes I made that weren't positive. Maybe the flavor would be stronger if I'd used full-fat coconut milk. But the sauce is perfect for dipping--which is what it's written for. Oh yeah, I reduced the amount of stock I put in the sauce, since light coconut milk is thinner. I highly recommend this recipe!

This is by far the best satay chicken I have ever made. I have made many variations of a peanut sauce, but they were never up to par with any of the restaurants I have been to. This sauce was a huge hit. I was told that we will definitely be having this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was seriously maybe the best thing i have ever eaten.  The kids loved it too. I grilled it w a non-stick griddle on the stove top. Served over basmati rice. I'll never eat out again.

This was a huge hit at New Years but when I doubled the recipe, it made an enormous amount of peanut sauce when you're using it as an appetizer.  I froze the extra sauce in muffin tins to store in a Ziploc so hopefully it will thaw nicely.

I made this when I had no plans for dinner and not much on hand. I did have some light coconut milk left that I needed to use up and that is how I found this recipe.  This was easy to make and very yummy.  Best of all, my picky twins actually liked this!!  Honestly, I have never had them willingly eat so much chicken before that was not in the shape of a nugget!  The marinated chicken had the perfect amount of flavor, not overwhelming but definitely there. The kids did not eat the sauce, but my husband and I enjoyed it. I served this with a side of steamed broccoli and it was perfect.  Thank you for this lovely recipe :)

Good recipe, easy to adjust to your liking. Adding crushed red pepper flakes is essential in my opinion. It needs a little spice to taste authentic. Add sugar slowly to sauce, may be too sweet. Yes, that much curry powder is necessary to get through the taste of the peanut butter.

Oh my goodness! This was so good.

HOWEVER, I always keep coconut milk in the pantry, and while cruising through this recipe, could not find any. I noticed earlier, though, that a different recipe had used sweetened condensed milk. I was VERY dubious, but I subbed the SCM for the coconut milk (using 1/3 can for the marinade and 2/3 can for the sauce). Then I omitted the brown sugar. IT WAS SO AWESOME!

For spice, yeah, I would add some red pepper, and ginger would always be welcome. Also, I used 1 teaspoon salt in the sauce. And I might try the coconut milk some time, because it would be less carbs and just different, but it would be hard to leave my "mistake" behind.

Great tasting results; easy to follow recipe, even for someone as inept as I am in the kitchen. There was a lot of information in the reviews and I too added 1 tablespoon of "Hot Chili sauce" to the peanut sauce. I served it over brown rice; yum! a keeper recipe.

Easy and good.  Doubled the amount of chicken for 16 skewers (2-3 per person).  Single amount of marinade and there was PLENTY of the single-batch of sauce for even half-again as much chicken.  Light meal.  Serve with coconut rice.

Made this last night and didn't alter a thing except I forgot to put the lime juice and soy sauce in the dipping sauce but it still came out so good!  And I only had nutty peanut butter so I used that and put it through a strainer once it was cooked.

The chicken was nice and moist.  I used a plastic Ziploc to marinade.  After threading on the skewers, I put them on the George Foreman Grill.  So I didn't need to soak the skewers since I wasn't using a bbq grill.  I on

My family enjoyed this as a Christmas night meal.  I am so happy to have another chicken recipe that works for us.  Thanks!!

I wonder if I could make this up ahead of time (marinade and chunks of chicken together), then store uncooked in the freezer? Ever try that?  I have a busy semester coming up, so while on xmas break I need to make up a bunch of freezer meals.

This was absolutely easy & delicious! So easy that my 8 year old daughter made the satay sauce (with my supervision). We don't like curry, so we left it out. I also didn't have brown sugar, so I used regular. We had this as an entree served with cous cous & sauteed veggies-hubby, daughter & I loved it-will make this again & again!

Makes WAY too much sauce... but it was yummy over rice. I added a squeeze of siracha sauce to add some spice.

So delicious! Served it over a bed of Mediterranean couscous (Near East brand) and skipped the peanut butter sauce in favor of sabra brand hummus. Served with a side of salad. Chicken was tender and juicy and so flavorful! Epic meal!

We made this for a going away party for our exchange student who was from Thailand. She wanted her friends to have something to eat that was from Thailand.  The exchange student said typically satay it was spicy in Thailand.  However it seems most things are, this recipie suited American tastes better for that reason.  Otherwise she thought the satay tasted authentic!  The best part was that the ingredients were all common and easy to find.  While looking at different satay recipes to find one for the party, I noticed many had ingredients that would have to be purchased at an Asian market, which around these parts is not easily accessible....at least a 45 min drive to get to one.  

I did not use skewers, I just cut the chicken into strips....and cooked on the grill.  I didn't want the kids at the party to take an entire skewer and then not care for the dish.  I also marinated at least 12 hours maybe longer.

And now for my word of advice....please spare yourselves and cut the sause in half!  It makes a ton of sause!  I followed the recipie x4 for the chicken portion and x3 for the sauce, and we still had way too much sause.

I added a couple splashes of fish sauce to the marinade. I was unsure about the curry powder, but it really made it taste authentic and delicious.  Served with dipping sauce and sliced cucumber. Yum! Thank you for sharing!

The marinate is great but the peanut sauce seemed to be missing something... It is still tasty but lacks complexity, perhaps...

My husband & I loved this recipe! We were cooking a late dinner so our chicken only marinated for 30 minutes. It still came out tender and flavorful. (I'm sure it would have been even more delicious after the full 2 hours.) The peanut sauce was phenomenal as written! I prepared per the recipe then tweaked it to my own taste preference afterward by increasing the soy sauce to a full tablespoonful. I cooked 1 1/2 pounds of chicken and it all disappeared. After the chicken was gone I snacked on carrots dipped in leftover peanut sauce. (I plan on using the remaining sauce on pasta and some stir-fried veggies.)

This was really delicious! I also modified it into a "slow cooker version". After marinating 2 pounds of cubed chicken breast as directed, I grilled it for 4 minutes on each side, then added to the peanut sauce which I had already started in the slow cooker. After 4 hours on low it was perfect. The only other "tweak" was that I added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes,1 tsp of granulated garlic, a red bell pepper that I cut into thin strips and 3 carrots also cut into "matchstick" thin strips. I served it with rice noodles which complimented the dish perfectly. So good & much easier to have everything done ahead of time. Thank You!

For a non-marinated version, I seered the chicken on both sides using sesame oil, then added the sauce ingredients in the same pan to finish cooking over a low simmer. This mimics a marinade, and uncovered allows the sauce to thicken.

Side notes for taste: I accidentally left out the soy sauce & lime, I'll try it next time but it still came out amazing. Also, use half the peanut butter if you don't like your's too 'peanut-y' . Great recipe

Wow!  This peanut sauce is outrageous!  It was thick and creamy (we reduced the amount of chicken stock to 1/2 a cup- we like a thicker sauce).  We served it with Alton Brown's Baked Brown Rice.  Fantastic!  The entire family loved it (husband- who doesn't like curry, and two 3-year olds that are very finicky).   My son, asked for a spoon to drink the sauce!  Thank you Shannon for sharing an easy and delicious recipe.

Amazing recipe. I used to live in Holland and it really reminded me of the Indonesian chicken satay I used to eat there all the time!
I just added some cayenne pepper to the sauce for extra heat, and marinaded the chicken for 24 hours. It was super tender and bursting with flavor!
Definitely a keeper!
Thanks for sharing.

SO delicious!! I was very happy with how easy and flavorful the peanut sauce was without being too sweet. I only marinated the chicken for an hour because I'm impatient, and also didn't have a grill so I cooked it in a fry pan but the marinade cooked onto the chicken and gave it a delicious "off the grill" crisp to it while still being really juicy. We also squeezed lime onto the chicken while it was cooking, but we're big lime fans. Next time I make this I will add some Sriracha into the peanut sauce as it could have had more of a kick, and also will add some extra soy sauce and maybe a little bit less brown sugar than the recipe calls for. Also probably more lime. Thanks so much for sharing-- a new favorite!

I actually only made the sauce because I had some leftover coconut chicken. The sauce was really good. I added a little bit more peanut butter and a pinch of cayenne pepper and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes just to give a little heat. I had a lot of leftover, but I think it would be good just as a dipping sauce, something to replace the usual bbq sauce or honey mustard. Definitely will make again and recomend it.

This was great.  Tried it tonight using light coconut milk  I cut the chicken breast in one inch pieces the short way, next time I will change that to the long way.  The marinade made the chicken taste yummy without the peanut sauce.  Of course then the peanut sauce made it even better.  I did add some red pepper flakes which was good.  I will definitely increase the amount of chicken to 2 lbs.  as there was so much sauce and my guys would have liked more chicken.  Will definitely make this again.

This has quickly become a staple of mine.  It is great for single guys like me.  I make the peanut sauce and freeze half-cup portions.  Make the marinade the night before, toss in whatever type of chicken I have (usually bone-in, skin-on thighs), and grill when I get home.  Serve with Asian Coconut Rice (recipe on this site) and steamed broccoli, top with thawed reheated peanut sauce, and I've got dinner.  One warning, read the instructions for the sauce carefully.  I accidentally simmered it with the lime juice and soy sauce once and it came out very bitter.

Oh my, this is good!  I followed the recipe exactly using lite coconut milk and reduced fat chunky peanut butter.  I found the sauce to be a bit thin for my preferences and ended up thickening it up with cornstarch.  Thanks for sharing, I'll be making this again!

I thought this was delicious! I admit, I tinkered a bit - some ginger, more heat (chili sauce) and a lot less lime juice, plus I added more curry (used powder, Thai yellow curry paste, and a Patak's mild curry paste) but it was so good!

This was absolutley delicious. My husband asked me twice if I had saved it in my recipe box! I added half as much peanut butter and tripled the curry in both the marinade and the sauce (we love curry flavor). I can't wait to make it again!

I didn't grill my chicken bits, but I threw all of the marinade into a sauce pan and cooked it over medium high heat until it was cooked through.  I left it in the marinade and then just served it over calrose rice with the sauce on top.  I liked it the way it was, but my husband thought that grilling it would be a better idea next time.  The sauce was 100% amazing!

This recipe was very good.  The first time I made this I didn't marinate the chicken long enough.  But the 2nd time I did, it made all the difference!  Must serve with the peanut sauce!  SOooooo good!

Yum! I was hesitant at first because I thought it would be bland, but it was actually really tasty! I loved the peanut butter sauce; it was very close to a Thai restaurant's satay dipping sauce. My fiance even ate it and he hates peanut butter!

We really loved this!  used chicken cutlets instead of cutting up chicken and using skewers. Also have an indoor range top grill pan so didn't have to go out into the cold to grill. Served with basmati rice & it's great!

Super yum! I'm a vegetarian, however my husband isn't. So I subbed half the chicken for drained tofu. Will make this again, and use the peanut sauce in with other recipes.

This is great and easy to make.  We marinate the meat the night before.  We make this at least once a month.

This recipe rocks!  I made this for my husband and I and we both fell in love all over again!  We grilled the chicken on the grill on kabob sticks and I used the same marinade recipe for the yellow squash I made.  There was plenty of peanut sauce left over that the next day, I chopped green peppers and onions, sauteed chicken in half of the sauce and then threw in the veggies and some ginger and simmered for 10 minutes.  Topped it over rice.  Another fantastic dinner!

This one wasn't for us. The peanut sauce just tasted like overly sweet peanut butter, and there was a ton of it.  I won't be attempting it again.

WOW!!! This was yummy! Me and my husband LOVE Thai food, but it's usually kind of pricey to go out and eat. My husband loved this! I did change some things though...I baked it in the marinade and also, to be healthier, I used lite coconut milk, and in the peanut sauce 3/4 c coc. milk, 1/2 c chicken stock, 1/4 tbs PB, 2 Tbs of b. sugar and added red pepper flakes. Definitely recommend you ADD RED PEPPER FLAKES AND GINGER to the dish...even if you don't like spicy (I don't) to give it kick. Forgot to add some ginger for more spice this time, but plan to next time...trust me, there WILL be a next time! Oh yes, if the sauce gets to thick on the burner just add water to loosen.

It was tasty, but there was way too much sauce and I felt the chicken was a bit dry.  Will try it again, in case the chicken itself was the problem.

YUM! I used my own peanut sauce recipe so I can only rate the marinade - but it was great and very easy.  Broke down two whole chickens (way cheaper than buying just boneless breasts) and it happily fed my lot who absolutely devoured them.  The coconut flavour was just right, not overpowering as it can sometimes be. Making it again tonight to eat up the last bits of chicken!

This was very good!  I was trying to take the healthy approach so I used lite coconut milk and then I baked the chicken with the marinade at 350 for about 45 minutes.  I drained the juices and marinade 3 times.  Then I added the chicken to the sauce on the stovetop.  I served this over a bed of lettuce with diced green onions and tomatoes.  This was really good!  The peanut sauce and chicken were perfect on top of the salad but next time I might try with rice!

This peanut sauce was delicious! I made extra and saved it. A few days later I sauteed some tofu in oil green onions. Then I added this sauce and tossed some sesame seeds and coconut on top. It was fantastic!

Excellent recipe! I had been looking for something similar to my husbands favorite dish at our favorite Thai restaurant, and I've definitely found it. Three things I did differently...Only one Tbsp lemon juice (I have really strong Italian lemon juice) A full Tbsp of the soy sauce, and a minor amount of red pepper flakes. My husband thanks you!!!!

Really good!  I thought the curry was a bit much... so to cover that up I added more coconut and peanut butter. I would just add less curry next time. I also thought the peanut butter overpowered the coconut just a little so I added coconut extract as well. I sauteed chicken tenderloin in soy sauce until golden brown and then threw in a small amount of satay sauce in the pan to toss over the chicken and cooked for a minute longer. I then used the rest as a dipping sauce. Very easy and good!

I DOUBLED THE CURRY AND GARLIC IN THE MARINATE AND ADDED 1/8 TSP RED PEPPER. FOR THE PEANUT DIP I ADDED 1/4 TSP RED PEPPER. IF YOU TOOK THE CHICKEN OUT OF THE MARINATE AND ROLLED IT IN SWEETENED COCONUT AND BAKED, IT WOULD BE KILLER. CYNTHIA

This recipe is very tasty. If you save the dipping sauce and store it in your fridge I would recommend to thin it with some chicken stock, otherwise it is too thick and it turns lumpy. I am a texture person and it wasn't pretty the next day!

This is the best recipe ever!!!  In a small effort to save my waist line, I used light coconut milk and less sugar in the sauce.  I also added some red pepper flakes to the peanut sauce for a little something something.  My boyfriend said "But I don't normally like peanut sauce but this is so good."

I only had the chicken in the marinade for about half hour and had cook it in the broiler (MN winter), and it came out very soft and tender and flavorful. 4-5 min on each side. I used a different peanut sauce that I had on hand, so can't comment on that. I served it with Basmati rice and garlic naan from Trader Joes. Good meal.

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  I don't know what it was, maybe all the curry that overpowered everything but it just wasn't appealing.  I served to guests and none of us liked it.  Luckily I had made a back up of another kind of chicken skewers so we didn't fill up on bread and sides for lunch.

Great Recipe!  I did double the marinade and chicken since this recipe makes so much peanut sauce.  I used about 24 chicken tenders and 12 skewers...came out just about right.  Otherwise, you can freeze the excess sauce.  Everyone loved it...even my little boy who hasn't been interested in eating chicken for a long time!  A family favorite now.

Pretty good, could use a little extra heat, maybe i'll add red pepper flakes next time. also makes a lot of sauce, may cut the sauce mixture in half next time. kids liked it without the extra peanut sauce, just the chicken marinaded and grilled. overall good

This was GREAT! My husband and 6 of my 7 kids loved it. My 7th is only a baby, so he didn't have any. I did add a little red pepper to the sauce to give it a little heat, but other than that, I didn't alter it. Thanks for the great recipe!

We liked this a lot.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if we could.  We did not think it was as peanut buttery as others thought.  There was definitely a PB taste, however, the curry was also strong too.  For those that like things hotter, some crushed red pepper would be a great addition.  Oh, and I didn't grill the meat due to the weather.  I just put it in a pan with a little olive oil and whatever marinade that didn't strain off.  It didn't brown (due to the liquid) but it was great.  We'll make this again but with some tweaking.  Maybe some ginger and/or sesame oil?

This recipe was very quick and easy.  I used it for a holiday party I had and it was great because I marinated the chicken until just before everyone arrived and then put it on the grill so it was nice and hot.  The sauce was good but found out later that asian sesame salad dressing works just as well in a pinch.  This is a wonderful and tasty appetizer.

This recipe was fantastic. The sauce was very thick like peanut butter, but I loved it that way. I did not alter this recipe when making it.

We thought these were excellent.  The flavor was great.  I also think that certain members on AR need to quit hen pecking at other peoples recipes.  We also love your BBQ Brisket.  Yummy.  Keep your recipes coming.  We love them.

The dipping sauce is like dipping chicken in straight peanut butter.  But the chicken is so good. I paired with peanut noodles

my husband and i love asian/thai food an we loved this recipe!  i marinated the chicken overnight which made the meat very tender.  the sauce was also very good, but we still like the hot peanut sauce from this site better.  don't get me wrong...this sauce is also very good.

I really liked this.  It was easy and delicious.  Perfect for us.  The only downside was my husband didn't like the curry but no big deal it still tastes GREAT!  I served it with the Thai Confetti Salad and some Thai sticky rice. It was a hit with everybody, including some neighbors.

This recipe is excellent.  Not only does it have a very authentic flavor, but it is amazingly easy to make!  I marinated it for about 3-4 hrs in the fridge.  Everyone loved it, even my picky toddler and preschooler and my DH and I felt that the peanut sauce was really good.  I think the key to this recipe is the use of coconut milk.  I tried another recipe w/o coconut milk and it was too salty and tasted mostly like soy sauce and was missing something... the coconut milk!  This will definitely be going into my recipe box!

This is a great recipe and the sauce was excellent. I did however end up adding things to the marinade after finding the recipe for chicken satay on this site. It included soy sauce and peanut butter in the marinade. All I know is that the combination of ingredients was great! The chicken was very juicy,tender, and there was tons of flavor. My husband says this one stays too!

I loved this!  I cut up the chicken pieces into chunks after grilling and served it as an appetizer.  I also divided the sauce into two bowls and added some crushed red pepper to one for a spicy sauce.  I forgot to add the lime and soy sauce at the end because it tasted great without it.
