I've been using this recipe for years and it's still one of our favorites.  The only thing we do differently is cook the chicken in the italian dressing at a low heat (275 degrees) for 2 or 3 hours or until the chicken browns.  It comes out tender and delicious and we use the left over cooked dressing to "dip" the chicken, our seven year old granddaughter's favorite thing to do!

This is the easiest and most delicious chicken recipe!!! I make it for my roommates at least once a week, it is one of their favorites!!  Before marinating the chicken I make sure to poke holes in it with a fork to let the marinate soak in, as another reviewer suggested.  I use a zesty Italian dressing and usually throw it together before leaving for work, 9 hours later it has a great flavor and makes a quick meal.  To give it an extra kick, before cooking I usually take a few pieces and dip each side in a bowl of parmasean cheese.  I'm not a fan of the extra cheesy taste but everyone else loves it that way!!  Cook this with the Oven Roasted Potatoes recipe from this site and you have an easy and delicious meal that people will love!!

I've made this oodles of times and it's a basic no fail recipe. I do as someone else recommended and pierce the chicken with a fork. I use a 2 1/2 lb. bag of boneless skinless chicken breasts and use enough Kraft Fat Free Caesar Italian to marinate. As someone recommended mushrooms I gave it a try tonight and they were scrumptious! I halved or quartered the big mushrooms and marinated them overnight with the chicken. I cook it in a foil lined 13x9 pan that's also covered with foil for 30 minutes at 375 degrees, remove foil and bake another 10-15 minutes. Since the color is so pale I sometimes sprinkle with paprika. The leftovers are great for all sorts of things like in salads and wraps etc.

I have never made italian chicken like this before. I always bake my chicken while it is still in the marinade, it makes it MUCH more juicy and flavorful..and I usually spoon some of the marinade over the chicken when I serve it. The family loves it that way. Baking it without the marinade made it very dry. You should definitely bake it with the marinade!!!

This is such an easy and flavorful main course.  I dredged the chicken in bread crumbs after removing it from the marinade and then baked it.  It turned out great.

It doesn't get much easier than this.  I cut the recipe in half and used Kraft light italian dressing. I pounded the chicken down thin and added a couple tablespoons of olive oil, some rosemary, italian seasoning and minced garlic.  I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate all day.  I did mine on the grill and it was great. The leftovers are perfect over mixed greens.

I first poked holes in the chicken on both sides with a fork to let the dressing really seep in and marinated it for about 6 hours. It is a quick and easy recipe that never fails!

This is a very good recipe.  I only made it for two but I did it a little diffrent.  I did marinade for 2hrs and I also baked the marinade with the chicken and I added a little bit of minced garlic.  I poked holes with a fork on both sides of the chicken.  It came out very juicy and also had sauce left over to put on chicken.

I used a 3-lb. bag of chicken tenderloins, and marinated in 16 oz. Kraft Zesty Italian dressing overnight with 3 medium potatoes, cubed.  Poured it into two casserole dishes, with marinade, and cooked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then removed dishes, stirred around chicken and potatoes, and sprinkled one dish with parmesan before returning to oven for 30 minutes more.  Turned out great.  The parmesan added a lot.  Next time I'll add mushrooms, too.

This was really REALLY bland and dry. I was only cooking for two people so I more than halved the chicken but still used over half the bottle of dressing, and it was still dry. Strange how its rating is so high.

This was pretty good and easy too! I marinated my chicken breast in italian dressing and basil and oregano vinegar overnight. I seasoned the chicken w/ salt, pepper and italian seasoning and  browned the chicken in olive oil on both sides. Then I baked the chicken in the marinade on 350 for 40 minutes. It was so juicy and tender! OH and don't forget to poke holes in the chicken as well.

I have been making chicken this way for more than 30 yrs, our favorite dressing to use is Good Seasons Italian dressing.  Try cooking the chicken on the grill after marinating, to die for!!

I do this all the time. It's a great way to change things up. I switch between italian seasonings and italian dressing with chicken. I'm a beginner cook so recipes like this are perfect for me. :)

I have been doing this for years, I've even gone as far as cutting up a ton of different kinds of veggies (potatoes carrots and onions are always a huge hit) and tossing it all in the oven and making one huge one dish meal. I've also always used FF italian dressing or made my own out of the packets that you can buy.

This is a favorite of mine. I put it on a baking sheet surrounded and sometimes covered with onions, peppers, carrots, mushrooms, squash-what I have available. I use the sauce in the pan too. I use small chunks of potato, sprayed with Pam and sprinkled with spices. Bake at 400 for 30-40 minutes. Whole meal in a pan.

I marinate my chicken and fish in Italian Dressing all the time. I am giving four stars because it does need additional seasoning ie: garlic salt, pepper or Grill Mates Roasted Garlic and Herb.

This recipe gave me the basics when I wanted to know how to cook chicken I'd marinated in a store-bought jerk marinade. Most of the marinated chicken recipes I found involved grilling, so this one helped me as far as figuring out the time needed to cook the chicken, something I'm kind of hopeless with. I did turn the temp up to 375°F instead, since my chicken breasts were superthick, and an hour was the perfect amount of time.

Delicious! I did read some of the other reviews and I made two additions to the recipe. I added a little bit of garlic and pepper and marinated it for about 6 hours. I also poked some holes with a fork so the juice could get absorbed better. Was the perfect amount of time. It wasn't too strong and wasn't too weak of flavor. I also cooked it in the juices and flipped halfway through.

This was an easy recipe that yielded a delicious meal.  For something so easy, it tasted like something that took much longer to prepare.

As many other reviewers have done, I also made some changes to the original recipe.  Instead of regular house italian dressing, I use Kraft Tuscan Italian dressing, which gives it a more rich flavor.  I also cut each chicken breast in half, and only cook it for 45 minutes instead of an hour.  If you want to give it a little something extra, after marinating coat each piece in parmesan cheese.

I also recommend drizzling the chicken with a little extra dressing after taking it out of the oven.

This is a great easy meal for the mom on the go with picky eaters!! I poked several holes in the chicken before marinating the chicken over night. I also baked the chicken in the dressing (I used Kraft Zesty Italian dressing) for about an hour. Thank you for posting this recipe, this will be made again and agin in our house!!

I'm not use why others measure and mess around with spices and oils and herbs or whatever when this recipe is just as good - or better- and takes 2 minutes to assemble!   I've been doing this for several years and it can't be beat IMHO!

I made recipe "as is", served with rotelle with spaghetti sauce.  The chicken was DRY.  I marinaded for 8 hours.  Wish I would have added the mushrooms as previous reviewers suggested, but this cooking time is way too long.

I couldn't find Italian salad dressing anywhere so I used Garlic and Herb dressing and threw in oodles of mushrooms. The chicken was delicious - and so easy, and the garlic mushrooms were the best I've ever tasted!

Try adding a tablespoon of olive oil, coat the chicken in an italian seasoning or chicken and herb seasoning and cook with house italian dressing.

Great recipe!  I first made the mistake, though, of using a not so zesty italian dressing (Paul Newman's Italian)  and the chicken was kind of bland.  The next time I made it, I used Wishbone Robusto Italian Dressing that made a world of difference!!!  I also dredged in italian-style bread crumbs. OMG!!!! Scrumptious!

Try adding honey to the Italian.  It takes the edge off and gives it a little sweeter taste.

Excellent recipe, especially for beginner cooks!  Tip: check your chicken at 45 minutes. The recipe suggests an hour but if your chicken breasts aren't huge, an hour is too long and your chicken will be flavorful but dry as dust. For the most part, 45-50 minutes will get 'er done.

I've done chicken like this I think since I was a kid. What I like to do is pound the chicke a little bit marinate in the dressing about a day or two, grill the chicken, top it with a slice of cheese, two slices of bacon and lettuce and tomato and put it on a toased kaiser roll. So good.

Personally, I don't care for the flavor of Italian dressing. I'm the type of person that typically only uses ranch. Because of that, I would've rated it a 4. But for someone who likes the taste of Italian dressing, this would be a great recipe. It was super easy. Great recipe, just not for my tastes.

The key to this recipe is to use an Italian dressing you really like.  Sometimes after marinating we lightly top each piece with seasoned Panko crumbs with a pit of grated Italian cheese before baking.  Using fatfree or reduced fat dressing makes this a healthy meal and does not impact taste.  Also works well if you slice the chicken before marinating and then pan cook with fresh veggies for a wonderful topping to pasta.  So much you can do with this recipe - let your imagination guide you and of course set your cooking time based on your own oven/stovetop and size of chicken.

I did almost the same as this recipe, only I did BBQ sauce and Zesty Italian. I did it for about an Hour, also. They turned out a little dry, but because of the sauces we just dipped the pieces in as we ate it, out of the pan! lol All in all, I give it an A+.

Last minute I made this and it turned out well. Changes - browned the chicken breast a little in some red pepper oil oil.  Added Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning and baked. Very moist and full of flavor.

I love this recipe! It's super easy and tastes amazing. I usually bake it and zucchini/squash together in the same casserole dish and it turns out even better! I also use Tony Chachere's original creole seasoning and garlic salt to give it an extra level of flavor.

I marinated some chicken tenderloins overnight hoping they'd be full of flavor. It had no color, so I added paprika, garlic powder & pepper. Baked in oven then broiled for last few minutes. I think it would taste way better grilled.

I was shocked with how favorful and juicy this chicken was! I added mushrooms as another reviewer suggested and kept everything covered in the oven until the last 10 min. or so. The leftover chicken and mushrooms were excellent eaten cold for lunch the following day!

I totally forgot all about this recipe! Today I used two chicken breast, marinated it for an hour, topped it with fresh minced garlic, sweet basil, rosemary, onions, and red, green and orange bell peppers. I am cooking it in NewWave oven to prevent heating up the entire house. I wrapped the chicken in foil but will open the top after it cooks for 30 minutes and allow it to cook another 30 minutes. I can't wait for the aroma to fill up the house. For side dishes, I baked some potatoes and made a tossed salad. Although it is not ready to eat, I know this is going to be a delicious dish. My mouth is already watering.

Great, easy, tasty recipe. You can marinate overnight or in the morning and have it ready for dinner at night.  remove the chicken from the marinade and use it for basting if you like. I tried cooking it in the marinade- but the chicken was WAY too tart.  Now, I pour off the marinade and baste the pan with olive oil before I add the chicken. I bake covered for 30 mins. Then  1 cut  6 carrots in quarters (lenghthwise) and 4 potaoes in quarters also lenghtwise. I add these to teh chicken and bake uncovered for 30 additonal minutes. Awesome!  The dressing gives the vegetables a great flavor and they come out slighly crisp. The chicken is brown but very moist. If you just want a slight brown, you can uncover for the last 15 minutes only. That works fine too and the vegetables are less crisp.

This is my favorite grilling recipe. I have made this for years and it is a favorite among everyone. I made for dinner guests once (always embarassed because its so easy). And, everyone RAVED. Kept complimenting every bite they took - I was blushing because it was really a quick fix.  My sister cuts this up and grills in chunks on sticks with other veggies. Serve with rice and its a perfect weeknight meal (can marinate the night before).  If you want to go all out. You can cut the breast in half lengthwise (pound if you want super thin) and marinate. Then, lightly grill until browned and put back in fridge with more dressing to marinate a few more hours. Then, totally cook through in the oven.  You can not go wrong with this!

This was a great dish. I added mushrooms, onions to mine( for an extra kick) and it turned out wonderful. The chicken was so moist and juicy. Note: make sure you marinate the chicken an hour or more. Then cook the  leftover sauce with it. I promise you it want disappoint.

We have done this alot and love it!  Definitely use high quality dressing.  If you are in a hurry, cut the chicken into bite size pieces, put it in a pan with the dressing, and simmer it for just a few minutes until it is done.  Toss with pasta, include some of the cooked juices, add veggies like tomatoes and mushrooms, and you've got a quick, tasty, healthy meal.  No need to marinate this way either.  I also add this chicken when I make caprese with noodles.  YUM!!

YUM! this will officially be in my menu plan more often! I started the marinade at 9pm the night before and it sat in the fridge all day till it was cooked at 6pm. I forgot to poke holes in the chicken, but its ok. I put the chicken in the pan, then poked holes. I added fresh italian dressing rather than putting on the leftover marinade. I also seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, italian seasonings & a hint of seasoned breadcrumbs. I flipped halfway though and added the same seasonings to the other side, as well as basted the chicken. My fiance couldnt stop talking about how delicious it was!!

I think'forking' the chicken and cooking at 275 for 2 hrs really helped make this dish more tender. Had it covered up until the last 20mins. and turned and basted the ckn a couple times. AWESOME!!!

I make this often because it is too easy. I poke holes to let the marinade seep like most reviewers suggest and sprinkle parmesan cheese halfway through baking time. I also sauté sliced mushrooms and onions in some butter AND the dressing and add it to the chicken before baking. Soo yummy!

Overall, I enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe! It had a very light and healthy feel to it and goes very well with rice! My chicken came out very moist with a slight tangy taste to it as well as the spicy after-kick that comes with Italian dressing. Though I admit, the dish felt like it was missing something, though I'm not quite sure what. For this recipe, I followed the following suggestions from other users: poking the chicken with a fork before marinading, baking the chicken in the marinade, and adding potatoes, carrots, pepper, & garlic salt. Also, I covered the baking pan with foil and baked it in a toaster oven for about an hour. I only marinaded the chicken for about 2 hours and I used Kraft Tuscan House Italian dressing. Both of these factors would probably account for the light taste of this chicken. In the future, I would probably marinade the chicken overnight and use a more flavorful Italian dressing.

This one is so good. I put my chicken in a casserole dish with dressing on it and just place the whole thing in the oven the next day. It comes out perfect every time. So Juicy!

I also add soy sauce to the marinade.  I marinate everything in a 2/3 Italian dressing and 1/3 soy sauce.  It is fabulous grilled too.  Always juicy and tender.

Very easy and very moist. I added a little Chicago style giardiniera to the dressing for a bit of a kick. Really good.

Chicken was a tad dry.  I added a very small amount of chicken broth to pan also.  May need to cover next time.  Took juices to cook noodles and veggies so that was a nice touch for other foods.

Quite simple only used some of the dressing in the pan and sprinkled some breadcrumbs on top. Next time will put in more slits in the chicken since tho good could have done with more flavor.

So easy and simple to do. The chicken came out great and it was a big hit. I ended up placing the chicken breast on the grill instead of baking them though. Excellent recipe.

This is so easy and tasty.  I like this recipe very much and find, with a little crusty bread and a tossed salad, it's a perfect light meal when you don't want to spend a lot of time over hot stove.

Easy recipe but the chicken was a little dry.  An hour is way too long.  I cooked 2 breasts (cut in half) for 35 minutes and it was plenty long.  Def poke with holes when marinating and add mushrooms.  I also added all the marinade to the chicken while it was cooking so that we would have some sauce to pour over the chicken. It was all eaten and it is good for a fast midweek meal.

I've marinated chicken in the zesty italian dressing many times. I puncture with a fork and marinate the chicken over night, or just the 11 hours I'm gone during the day. I broil the chicken, only takes roughly 8 minutes on each side. Serve rice and a veggy on the side.  quick, easy and tasty.

This was pretty good. I marinaded it for about four hours. It had a pretty good flavor, but I was wanting more. Next time I will marinade it for a lot longer, and perhaps use a different Italian dressing. I did add fresh mushrooms like someone suggested, and those were very delicious. The mushrooms act like a sponge and soaked up the sauce really well. I think I liked the mushrooms better than the chicken itself! Also, I forgot to poke holes in the chicken, so I will be doing that next time too. All in all, it was pretty good and I'll try it again eventually.

Excellent basic recipe that can be developed further by keeping the marinade & adding veggies to it.  First of all I do salt the chicken well letting it set a few hours or overnight, then a few hours before baking add the dressing ( Wishbone- Italian).  One hour before baking cover the chicken with 28 " can of diced tomatoes,  3 cloves garlic  slivered, 1 sliced carrot, 1 celery stalk sliced & 1 onion halved & sliced.  Also Cacciatore style, olives & raisins could be added.
While chicken is baking, blend a heaping handful of fresh garden parsley to put onto the chicken & sauce before turning over the breasts after baking 1/2 hr , saving half of the parsley to put onto the rotini noodles.  Bake about another 20 minutes or so.  I then shred zucchini to cook with the noodles 2 minutes before noodles are done.  
Also I use 4-5  large breast.  When baked& cooled a bit, slice  them vertically into 4-6 slices per breast 
& serve  with sauce over breasts & noodles.  A handful of chopped or blended basil is nice.

This was awful.  I scored the chicken breasts and marinated them for almost 24 hours.  I then baked them exactly as directed, and it came out very bland with an occasional hint of vinegar from the salad dressing.  My husband likes pretty much anything and he couldn't eat more than a small piece.  Not making this one again.

I actually tried this on my own one day when I was in a pinch for a marinade when one I made went sour. It is the most delicious chicken ever! If you are from Canada, the taste is similar to all dressed chips! When I'm really hungry I skip the overnight in a bag step, I cook the chicken in a frying pan with the sauce in the skillet. Once the chicken is done, I remove it and with the remaining dressing, I add 'club house roasted garlic&pepper' seasoning and some seasoning salt, then cook it on low heat till most of the liquid is gone and it's more like a thick paste. Then I mix it with the cooked chicken. Takes about 20min! The flavour is much stronger this way though so if you don't want very strong flavoured chicken then I make it in the oven the way this recipe suggests :)

This is such an easy recipe, and full of flavor! I always season my chicken with salt, pepper and garlic salt no matter what I'm cooking, so I did that and then added the Italian dressing and let it marinate overnight, and it turned out very moist and delicious! My husband and kids loved it, and my husband's grandmother (who is an EXCELLENT cook) tried it and asked me for the recipe! I will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe, but since the Kroger near my residence hall at school usually has chicken drumsticks on sale more often than chicken breasts, that's what I use (I mean seriously, $.99 a pound for drumsticks vs $2.99 for chicken breast and the drumsticks come in family sized packages, so I divide it up and store some in the freezer in ziploc freezer baggies) instead of the chicken breasts.

This is a quick and easy way to prepare chicken. I have done it numerous times. I would suggest marinating only 1~4 hours. I once left it overnight and it became bitter and acidic. It's a great recipe for beginners. I always broil or grill, after marinating though.

I make chicken breasts this way when I'm rushed for an easy meal.  I serve Chicken Rice a Roni to make this a complete meal.

Awesome recipe!!! I added diced fresh tomatoes for color and flavor.  As a poor college student, it's hard to find the time and money to make meals but this was cheap and really easy!

SOo easy and soo good. I threw some chicken ternerloins in a baggie with some italian dressing and froze it, the night before I stuck in the fridge and they were ready to bake when I got off work. Kids enjoyed it.

this was the easiest chicken recipe.  I was worried that baking it uncovered for 1 hour and 15 minutes would temp to dry out the chicken, but I was wrong.  This was the juciest baked chicken I have ever had.  And the great flavor and ease of preparing was an added bonus.  Thank you for sharing.

I used about 14 oz. of a 16 oz. bottle of Kraft Vidalia Onion dressing & marinade and marinated it for about 24 hours.  It was way too strong for me.  It's a good recipe though, and I will try it again with a regular Italian dressing!

This was simple but both my husband and I thought it was too tangy from the marinade. All I could taste was Italian dressing. This would have been much better on the grill, but I think we would rather have a different marinade or dry rub in the future instead of trying this one again. Thanks anyway, it was a nice change and I made a wonderful dish with it.

So easy, and turned out pretty well. I would marinade longer (I only did about 3 hours) and poke holes in the chicken next time. I also only cooked 3 chicken breasts, so I cut the time down to 35 minutes.

My husband and I have been using this recipe forever.  It is even easier if you simply grill the chicken (best tasting way in my opinion) after marinating or inside we just take the chicken unmarinated, throw in in a deep pan with the dressing (poke holes in the chicken or cut it up to make it cook faster) and cover until cooked.

This was so good my hubby went back for seconds and he isn't really a fan of chicken.      I did poke holes in the chicken with a fork and I had it in the fridge marinating at least three hours before I cooked it.

This made a very moist chicken, but that being said, it was a little bland. That was my fault, as I only was able to marinate it for an hour. I would make this again, but marinate it for longer.

I cooked it on the stove in a skillet with a little olive oil, which I think dried it out.  Next time I will try baking as the recipe states.  Still tasty though!

This is by far the best chicken I've eaten. I added some potatoes with butter, salt, pepper, and paprika and then put in with it the chicken and left in in for about a hour and 10 min, then covered it with aluminum foil and let it cook for about 10 more minutes turn out delicous.

I have been cooking chicken like this for years. This is my oldest sons favorite way to eat chicken. I cook the chicken in the marinade and then discard after cooking. I have made chicken this way on the stove, in the oven, on the grill and in the crockpot.

This is easy and tasty! I only had a vinagrette dressing on hand, so I used that. I also added a small can of sliced mushrooms, like others suggested. It was very good. I will make this again, but next time I will use creamy Italian dressing.

Quick and easy.  When I'm short on time I marinate for 30 minutes in the fridge.  This  chicken is great used as a leftover for chicken salads.

This is my family's favorite marinade. The flavor is outstanding and I also use it with baked potatoes cooked in the microwave, slice them and put them in a bowl with the salad dressing. Cook them on the grill for enough time to just brown the potatoes.

This recipe is my Daddy favorite way to have chicken.  I grill the chicken instead of baking it.  Our favorite dressing to use  is a  Italian-Cesar dressing.

My friends have been telling me to use Italian dressing as a marinade for a long time so when I came across this recipe I tried it. It's not bad for a quick, no-fuss marinade. I made mine in the toaster oven and it took only 30 minutes. I left it in a bit longer and it got a little dried out. This marinade smells delicious as it is cooking. You may want to add additional spices as it is cooking.

Wow was I disappointed. With such high reviews, I really thought this was a no-fail recipe. But... it was SO bland!! My husband and I had to grab the salt, and find a dipping sauce to give the chicken some flavor. If anyone recommends a specific Italian dressing that works for them, please share! I’m willing to try again with some tips from those who love this recipe.

I've tried this recipe before, but with pork chops. Trust that if you take the time to marinated it over night it is the best. The meat comes out so tender and flavorful.

This recipe is super simple and tasty but the chicken turned out far too dry when I discarded the marinade so when I remade it I cooked it with the remaining marinade hoping it would retain the moisture and flavor, I also added some crushed garlic and black pepper and it turned out fantastic.

I was intrigued by this dish because it only had 2 ingredients and had rave reviews. I tried it on my parents for a Halloween night dinner and my dad really enjoyed it and had seconds. I on the other hand was hoping for a little more flavor  and found it to be OK. It was very moist but it was a little white and "ghosty" looking so I guess it worked out for Halloween but I was hoping it would be more browned. I did use half the marinade in the dish while cooking which helped with the moistness I think. I also added some roughly chopped crimini mushrooms in the marinade while cooking in the oven as another reviewer suggested and these were my favorite part. Very flavorful and yummy. I forgot to prick the chicken (as another person suggested and my dad later mentioned as a good idea) and I think this would have made a difference in the taste. Will try again with this method. I think I wil also try browning it in the pan first before putting it in the oven. Overall, it was good and worked out :)

I followed this recipe to the letter THE FIRST TIME, but when we ate it,  it was desperately missing salt.  So the next time I cooked it I added Salt ,Pepper, cumin and garlic powder  placed the breast in a zip lock and left it in the fridge overnight .  On the second day I added the Italian dressing to the bag along with some dehydrated onions and left that in the fridge overnight.   Cooked it ....Yea That did it!

My mom made this my entire childhood, and taught me how to do this as one of my first real cooking lessons! She made it in a big skillet, and left the marinade in. She called it “coca cola chicken” and she would put a tiny amount of Coca Cola in it- later I realized it was to distract me from the Italian dressing which I thought I didn’t like! I fooled my son (now 16) the same way until he was old enough to “handle the truth!”

I’ve made it in skillets and in the oven, different temperatures and different cooking times, covered and uncovered, with extra seasoning and without- it’s never failed! And everyone who isn’t “in the know” thinks I have done something fancy ??

I always leave the marinade in though- it makes such a glorious “sauce” afterward! It’s great with fresh rosemary sprigs (discard or leave as garnish) if you happen to have a plant. Fresh sliced hot pepper from the garden adds an excellent kick, and different flavor type depending on the breed of pepper as well! I’ve been known to add a hint of lime as well- but none of that is necessary!

Will not be making this again. I marinated for several hours, poked holes, cooked in marinade. It still wasn't that great. I'll be using the rest of the chicken in a salad so it doesn't go to waste.

I liked this very much.  I did as some of the other's suggested and cooked the chicken in the salad dressing.  I thought it might be too salty but it was note.  I cooked for close to 3 hours in the broiler, too hot to put the stove on.  I will definitely make this again.

marinating too long can change the texture of the chicken and the vinegar in the dressing can start to cook the chicken.

This  is so simple and DELICIOUS. I cooked for a big group of 70; marinated the chicken overnight and after placing it in the pan, I sprinkled the chicken with bread crumbs and a little bit of parmesan.  It was great. I also think adding some of the marinade in the baking pan adds to the flavor.

I am giving this a two because I am willing to give it another shot. I used almost a whole bottle of dressing and it was very dry. I read on here where someone said pour the marinate mixture in with it. I will try that.. the flavoring wasn’t bad but it was very dry.

I have made this several times. I marinade over night.  And then dredge it in a mixture of breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese with a little bit of garlic powder. I serve it with a side of buttered egg noodles with parmesan and a salad.

Made this last night for dinner and it turned out exceptional. I marinated the chicken in the dressing for around 1 1/2 days. I also cooked the chicken in with some of the marinade to ensure it stayed moist. And we also used little bowls with the cooked marinade in them to dip the chicken! Paired it with green beans & fried potatoes! My entire family loved it! Definitely will make it again!

Thank you Marion for posting this recipe.  After reading the reviews, I used chicken thighs and Italian dressing.  I marinated over night and cooked uncovered at 225 for 1 1/2 hours in the marinate.  The chicken was delicious.  I served the chicken with a garden salad and the dish received rave reviews!!

I marinated the chicken overnight, then baked it tonight. I basted it a couple of times while it baked. It turned out great! Wonderful for people like me who are not natural cooks and love simple recipes!

If you have leftovers, try shredding the chicken and making chicken salad!

I've been doing this for years, thinking I was being innovative! I always marinate it overnight for maximum juiciness. Best on the grill, but baking it  OR even  cooking it stove top in a pan works!

I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and made a few changes. Since I had huge chicken breasts, I butterflied them first. Then since the store brand of Italian dressing was on sale much cheaper than the name brand, I bought that one. However it didn't look too flavored so I added about a tsp. of red pepper flakes and a shake of cayenne to it. I poked hikes in the breasts with a fork and marinated the chicken for 2 hours with a few quartered mushrooms. Then I dredged the chicken in bread crumbs and laid them on a greased foil covered pan. Tossed the mushrooms on the pan with a bit of the marinade as well and for good measure I drizzled a bit of marinade over the chicken here and there. Cooked it all for an hour without turning and it was perfect! Everyone said it was a keeper.

Very simple, just put everything in a bag and let sit in refrigerator. My suggestion would be to make sure you can marinate the chicken for at least a few hours, as I was only able to do so for 1 hour, so the flavoring was pretty much just on the outside of the chicken. But very enjoyable.

I tweaked the recipe a little. I added fresh garlic and red onion and allowed it to marinate over night. I cooked the chicken with marinade and it was so flavorful. My family loved it!

I have done my chicken this way for years.  I prefer grilling it, but do bake it in the oven during the winter.  It works for all cuts of chicken.  

I usually use Kraft Greek Feta with Oregano now.  You can also use any vinaigrette type dressing that you like.  If you happen to be a fan of Bonanza Chicken Monterey it is just grilled chicken breast basted with Catalina dressing.

The Greek or Italian dressings also work great on pork chops or pork tenderloin.

When I buy a larger package of chicken, pork chops or even steak I package them with the dressing marinade before freezing.  The meat marinates while it thaws in your fridge overnight.

This is my favorite way to cook chicken breasts.  In my family we add sriracha sauce to the Italian Dressing and it gives it a nice spicy flavor we like.

I made this as the recipe stated but I let the chicken marinate for 10 hours while I was at work and I did poke holes in the chicken to let the marinade seep threw and it was the best tasting chicken ever. So juicy!

I don't have a clue what the fuss is about. It tastes like exactly what it is... Salad dressing on baked chicken. It's not bad, just nothing special at all. I may make this again if I am running low on time as it's relatively easy and quick to make. I marinaded it over night and baked it until it was nice and juicy.. Just not impressed . With all the reviews I was expecting much more. Oh well :-/

As is I think it would be pretty bland. I added salt, pepper, garlic, shallots, honey and sprinkled with paprika. I used thin sliced chicken breasts and baked for 15 min. on  each side, then broiled for 5 min. It was Really Good! :-)

I was excited to make this because of all the excellent reviews it received but was disappointed in the end.   I marinated it for 3 hrs but it was too bland for our liking.  On the plus side, it was very moist.  (I cooked it in the marinate)  I probably would not make this again.,

VERY GOOD! When i cooked the chicken i left the marinate on and the dish ended up very juicy. Next time i would put the chicken in the marinade in the morning, and cook it for supper. Everyone liked it, and this is a recipe to make again.

I finally made this delicious dinner! I let it marinate for two days and have to say it was the most amazing dinner I've ever cooked to date. It was moist and tender yet flavourful and again amazing.... Thanks for the great tip... Only thing I tweaked a bit was I poured some more italian dressing into a frying pan and added 1/4 cup of butter and used it as a topping for the chicken.

Certainly easy enough. Very much like a slow cooker recipe I use where you don't have to marinate or thaw your chicken. More flavor than the crock pot recipe

Very easy but bland.  The chicken is probably better sliced in a salad or on a sandwhich, it's too plain on it's own.

It was good. I actually have been making this recipe for years but I usally use chicken with bone but I didnt have any on hand so I tried it with chicken breast. It came out pretty good.

Loved it! So easy too. I poked chicken with a fork and marinated for about 3.5 hours. I baked in the oven and then browned in a pan after - perfect! Oh and I used chicken tenders and a bottle of Safeway brand Italian dressing.

It was delicious! I rated it a four because it didn't "wow" me, but will become a regular in my menu. I added fresh mushrooms with the chicken while it was marinating too. Definitely a must try!

This recipe was just okay. As a previous reviewer stated, the chicken meat might taste good in a sandwich. Not great as main dish.

I used to work in a group home with 8 older gentleman with disabilities and this was always a hit.  Now I make it at home for a simple meal after a long day.  It is so easy to prepare and everyone loves it.

This is a great recipe especially in a pinch. Chicken is very tasty when grilled too.

I rated this as a 3 star recipe because it is way too simple to be served as the main dish.  I ended up making Goya boxed beans and rice and then adding this chicken in diced cubes.  I also added some broccoli to the mix and it ended up being great...

I poked holes in the chicken and marinated it overnight. I didn't have Italian dressing so I used a "Naturally Light Greek Feta Mediterranean" dressing. It tased quite nice. Baked it at 350 for 40 minutes, then browned it in a frying pan with about a tsp of butter for about 30 seconds each side. This made it look much nicer and tastier. The chicken was a bit dry but it was low-cal so that made up for it. :)
