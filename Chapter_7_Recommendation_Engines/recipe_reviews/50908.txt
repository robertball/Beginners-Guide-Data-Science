I got chill bumps when I saw this recipe.  My mother, who is no longer living and referred to as "Nana" by her grandchildren, had a special recipe for goulash.  Hers was similar, but better, I think.  She used the ground beef, onion and green pepper, sauteed together.  In a separate pan, she fixed a "boxed" macaroni and cheese mix.  After the meat was browned, she drained it and added the mac-n-chz with a can of tomatoes and a dash of salt, pepper, and garlic salt or any other similar spice you want.  Hers was a one dish meal, served with a tossed salad and crusty bread.  SO good! And easy to warm up leftovers - if you have any!

This was Awesome.  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.  I used 2 zukes, 1 red pepper, spicy paprika, garlic powder and garlic salt and 1 tbs. of sugar to cut down on the acid.  I boiled a brown rice Boil n Bag and added it to the sauce, extended the cooking by time by 15 minutes.  It turned out fantastic.  The leftovers were even better!

I substituted sweet onion for red, and yellow pepper instead of mushrooms. Kept everything else the same. Served it mixed with elbow macaroni, but the 16 oz box was a bit too much. Probably go with 8 or 12 oz. next time, but this time it was still fine, just a tad noodle heavy. Still, this is very good and I love all the veggie goodness. My 13 month old loved it, especially the zucchini.

Very good, and a quick and easy weeknight supper.  I added a couple cloves of fresh minced garlic, and also added around 3/4 of a cup of sour cream in the last few minutes.  Served it over rice and it was delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Thought this was pretty tasty. Did make a few changes/additions: Used only 1 green bell pepper, no red. Used yellow onion instead of red. Sauteed the mushrooms, onions, bell pepper, and 1 clove garlic first, then added some lean beef. There wasn't any fat to drain, so it saves some time. I also added some chili powder with all the other spices. Omitted the garlic sauce. Served with brown rice and topped with 4-cheese blend.

This goulash is very yummy! I bought some Hungarian Goulash spice mix in London, so wanted to find a good recipe as soon as I got back. I substituted the spice mix (paprika-based) for the paprika in recipe and used ground turkey and a little extra zucchini. I served it over brown rice and added greek yogurt on top in place of sour cream. My fiance was scared to try it (I think the name "goulash" was the main problem :) and he really liked it... he finished off his serving! It's really just almost like a chili using veggies instead of beans. Very good.

This had a great flavor and was very healthy.  It was also easy to make.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and it came out fine.  With all the veggies in the pan, along with the meat, I didn't think the one can of tomatoes would be enough, but I am glad I didn't add another one because it was perfect.  Don't do what I did: I added cooked noodles INTO the goulash and it totally absorbed all the liquid.  Next time, I will either serve it over the noodles or by itself without pasta (it's great as it is).  Thanks, we loved it!

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe! I did add some yellow squash and went just a bit heavier on the seasonings since I was using a bit more than a pound of ground beef. It made for a great supper last night and lunch today. If the rest of my crew hasn't devoured it by now it may end up being supper again tonight! ;)

Thanks for a great recipe. I'll definitely be making this one again!

This was a very good recipe.  I only wanted to make a couple of changes.  I added an extra tablespoon of olive oil because the vegetables wouldn't cook properly without drying out and burning otherwise.  I also added an extra can of whole tomatoes.  I'm a tomato fan - personal preference!  My husband and I enjoyed it and especially liked the high amount of veggies in the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

This was really good. I am still eating the leftovers from a week ago and the taste gets even better with time. This is a fun recipe to work with because it is so versatile. I threw everything into a crockpot and cooked it on low somwhere around 4-6 hours. I waited until the veggies got soft to turn it off.

Loved this recipe!  I made it just like the recipe except I served over noodles.  Next time I will add more mushrooms because we love them and add more red pepper (or yellow) and less green!  Very great!  Thank you.

I served this over white rice and it was very good.  The basil adds a lot of flavor.  My teenage son thought he wouldn't like it, but before I knew it he was getting a second helping!  Thanks for sharing.

This was great...I needed to clean out the fridge and had everything on hand...I did use a yellow and red bell, no green. I did throw in some black olives that I needed to use up also.Toped with some cilantro and shredded Parmesan cheese.

I didn't eat any of this (I don't eat meat) but my hubs and kids (8 1/2 & 3 1/2) really liked it a lot. They have asked me to make it again so it gets a 5. Very easy to make and wonderful of a cold winter night.

This was a great basic recipe, but I didn't have garlic salt, so I tried to improvise with garlic powder and salt.  I basically ad libbed until it tasted ok, so I don't know how much I added in the end--it seemed like a lot, though!  I recommend making it with the correct ingredients.

This is good, but it needs something. Not sure what. Per another review, I added 3/4 c. sour cream.  I think next time I will add some cheese, too.  Loved the veggies.  It's a keeper, but needs a little work.

I made this with elbow pasta and mixed all together.  I also added a diced tomato (I had half of one in fridge that needed used) and I omitted the mushrooms bc not a family fav.  I LOVED the zucchini! It remained crisp and yummy.  What an awesome dish!!  I've made it 3 times in the past month and we just love it!  Know, I just add what spices I like.  I now cook minced garlic with the hamburger meat and it adds nice flavor to the meat ;)

I used crimini mushrooms, a yellow pepper instead of green and I added a little homemade marinara sauce because I've always grown up eating Goulash a little saucier than this would have been. It really does need a little sauce, that's what I felt was missing. I did double this so I could make a batch and freeze a batch without pasta. I mixed it with whole wheat spiral pasta. The half batch I served....no leftovers. My husband ate most of what the kids didn't. I'll make this again. It's like an update of what I ate as a kid but with a healthier spin.

This was alright. I didn't see the difference between this and a thin pasta sauce. Only changes I made were ground turkey for the beef, no mushrooms because my husband hates them, added in fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and green beans for the zucchini. It was just too bland, but I saved it by adding extra paprika and basil, plus pepper and a tad of cayenne. I probably won't make this again.

Loved it!! I'd made something similar for years but never thought to put the zukes in. I used diced tomatoes instead of whole, and I used the box of macaroni and cheede as suggested by another reviewer. Also added some oregano.

My family loved this including my 7 year old picky eater. I did use lean ground turkey instead. It could use just a bit more flavor and grated parmesan cheese helped. I liked that it was full of healthy veggies and I got my kids to eat it!

DELISH!!! I dont think its a 'goulash' but what do I know? Served over Egg noodles as suggested - awesome. I added in a can of artichoke hearts (in a can - water Not oil packed) I rinsed and quarted them. MMMMMMM. Left out the Bell peppers. what little left overs were left, were great too!! Good job.

I, too, found this recipe delicious. What a great way to get your veggies! I used the diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano. I can also see how, with a little tinkering, this recipe can become a super soup.

This is just delicious!  I made as directed, except I cooked the onion with the ground beef, since I like my onion well done.  (It does lose a little bit of it's nice color that way though.) When I added the beef back to the pan w/the veggies, I noticed that there wasn't much 'sauce', so I added a small can of tomato sauce, and then added a small can of tomato paste and a little water.  I added a couple of tsp of chili powder, too.  This did the trick!  I cooked 8 oz of elbow macaroni separately, and then stirred it into the mixture...YUM!  The zuchinni was awesome, I think I may add 2 next time rather than one, or a yellow squash, as suggested.  The first thing my hubby said when he sat down to the table was that the dish was very colorful, and it was delicious too.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  Will make again soon.  Oh yes, a sprinkle of cheddar cheese on top is great, too.

Nanny's Goulash Haiku: "Big goulash surprise! This turned out pretty tasty, smelled great cooking too." I let mine simmer for awhile, enjoying its aroma; oh, and I used a garlic clove as opposed to garlic powder, and served over rotini. Sure it's not elegant, but for a pretty quick, filling dinner, it worked for us!

I just didn't use white pepper and used black pepper instead. I wasn't sure what the difference was, but this dish turned out realllly bland. I would suggest doubling up on the seasoning or adding salt. I sprinkled some Parmesan on top of it while I was eating it and that helped.

My family really loved this recipe, my husband asked me who made it and I told him it was a family affair.  It was so easy my daughter who is 11 and I put it together after work. The only thing I changed was we added approx. 1C. of tomatoe juice and 1 Tbl. spoon of sugar.

This is not the goulash I've been used to, but it's a good healthy dish. I found it a bit bland, and would have only given three stars, but my husband felt it deserved at least four.

I wouldn't really call this goulash.  Add some carrots and tomato juice and you've got a variation of vegetable soup.  
I added some water, because it was dry.  Served with macaroni noodles.  
I won't make this again.  Not good enough to repeat or even try to improve.

I have never had goulash before so I didn't quite know what to expect.  My husband, on the other hand, has had it before.  I made this recipe last night and it was OK but my husband said it didn't taste like goulash to him but he still liked it.

Thank you for this delicious, healthy goulash recipe. I also added an 8oz. can of tomato sauce and some water chestnuts for a little crunch and a little red pepper flake. Otherwise I followed it exactly the way it was. YUMMY!!! It almost tasted to good to be good for you. Thanks again.

This was okay. I didn't do any major changes to the recipe and felt that it was average for a lot of work. It was a little bland and needed more seasonings. I will not make again.

Amazing! My 17 year old son and I loved it! I'm a vegetarian, so I substituted veggie beef instead of 'real' beef. I also doubled the zucchini.  We ate it over brown long grain rice.

We enjoyed this goulash recipe.  I played with the amounts based on what I had on hand but it was actually better the second day after all the flavored had meshed together.  Very hearty, easy dinner.

I am in Dallas this week, helping my son in law with my 3 year old grand daughter while my daughter travels on business and he has a couple of evening meetings.  After not having great luck with take out for the past few nights, we decided to make  our own dinner last night.  I found this recipe on AR  while looking for ingredients that we had on hand.  It was really good.  We followed the directions pretty closely, but we only had 1 bell pepper, we used 2 medium zucchini, and we threw in a few carrots, just because we had them.  We used 1/2 tablespoon of smoked Spanish paprika (my personal favorite) and a little Hungarian paprika. We added about 1/2 cup of beef stock to give it a little more liquid, and I think it would be really good if a couple of cups of beef stock were added to the leftovers to make more of a stew for lunch.  Thanks for posting this really good recipe.

This is a great way to use lots of veggies and make a healthy meal! I doubled the seasonings and added an extra can of crushed tomatoes. I used yellow squash instead of zucchini, Portabello mushrooms and

Will definitely be making again and again. Was a little skeptical at first because is nothing like my family's traditional recipe; seemed foreign to serve over the pasta instead of combined.  Was so pleasantly surprised with the flavor of the paprika and those healthy veggies, nice recipe. Quick & easy stick-to-your-belly recipe to make especially after a long day at work. Think it would also be very good with some sausage.

This is a tasty recipe and easy to prepare.  I made small substitutions, such as I used garlic pepper instead of garlic salt, also used a sweet onion instead of red onion and omitted the white pepper.  My family loved it!

I loved goulash growing up and decided to make it for my four-year-old. I took out the mushrooms and added squash. Used chili powder instead of paprika (my little one can't handle things too spicy) and cut the amount of onion in half. Served it over penne noodles and topped it all with Romano/Parmesan cheese. Had it along side a spinach, strawberry, and walnut salad and garlic toast. A fantastic healthy meal that my little one gobbled up!

This is one of the best meals I have ever eaten.  It tastes like the goulash that I remember from childhood, but is much different without the noodles and plus a couple of ingredients.  The Zuchinii was a very nice touch.  Seriously one of the best meals I've ever had.

This was a great, it had tons of vegetables (you can add whatever you want to - if it is in your fridge and you need to use it up, throw it in!). I added a little more paprika and some celery salt to help boost the flavor. I served it over whole wheat noodles. The sour cream does add some good flavor too.

This is an awesome recipe and my husband even liked it.  I did change/add a couple of things.  Mainly, I used a bit more paprika, used two cans of whole peeled tomatoes and added 1.5 cups of macoroni, 1/2 cup of water and a bit of dried mustard.  Season to taste using the recipe's seasonings.  The zucchini is great.  There are lots of leftovers and they are very good.

I would agree with many of the other reviews on this website that the recipe needs more flavor.  So I did add a little salt, additional basil and used canned diced tomatos that already had olive oil and garlic in them.  I agree u could use less olive oil when cooking the vegetables.  It turned out well and would recommend trying if you are looking for a quick easy and fairly healthy meal.

This was just okay. I used one zucchini and one yellow squash, used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, canned mushrooms (all I had on hand), and just one green bell pepper.  I served it over whole wheat egg noodles. I think maybe a can of tomato paste, plus a good bit of salt, would have made a big difference. Either way, it's fairly tasty and used up some of our surplus of squash.

I followed the directions exactly except I doubled it.  Served over white rice with salad and fluffy biscuits.  Big hit.  Might lesson the olive oil next time as I had to dab oil off of the top prior to serving.

Tasty and easy to make.  I did cook it for 15 min more because we like our zucchini to be mushy.  I did add yellow aquash and the 1 Tbsp sugar.  Served it with mac and cheese.

This is a keeper.  I made two versions, one for me, and one for the family.  They don't like mushrooms, and I didn't want the beef...so one version was minus mushrooms, the other minus the beef.  The only issue I had with it, was it was a little bland, so we added sea salt at the table.  Next time I'll add the sea salt while cooking!

I thought this dish had a nice consistency.  I used a 28oz can of tomatoes instead of the smaller one, used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, no mushrooms, added a yellow pepper.  My only problem with it was that is was too bland, I even doubled the basil and paprika.  I have some left over and I'm hoping that letting it sit for a day or two will give it a bit more kick.

This is pretty good!  Certainly something I won't mind making often - you can't beat all the veggies.  Here are my changes:  I only used one green bell pepper (omitted the red); used white onion instead of red; decreased the olive oil a little (not sure by how much, I didn't measure); added one 8 oz can of tomato sauce, some salt, garlic powder (added at the end), and 8 oz of whole wheat rotini.  If you plan on serving this over any sort of pasta or rice, I would DEFINITLEY suggest adding the can of tomato sauce - it made the consistency PERFECT and I don't think there would have been enough sauce if I didn't add it.

This is not what I would have considered goulash.  It tastes great anyway.  What I did was leave out the zuchinni, add some white wine, and thinned it just a little with some tomato sauce.  It made a great spaghetti sauce. I prefer some sweetness to my spaghetti sauce and this had just enough.

Ok recipe. I followed the directions to the letter, and was good enough for one meal, but not good enough for leftovers, or lunch. We needed to add LOTS of garlic powder, as something in the flavor just wasn't right. I think the Paprika may have gotten scorched adding it where recommended. If I were to make again, I would add the seasonings after some "liquid" was added. Also, I added the juice from the canned tomatoes... I think it would have been better with fresh roma tomatoes, as it calls for all other veggies to be fresh. Maybe that's where the flavor changed...?

This was pretty much ho-hum.  I had high expectations and this dish just didn't meet them.  I had to add quite a bit more seasoning after preparing and we still were not impressed.  Sorry Nanny.

My family did not enjoy this dish. Kind of a bland taste and I will not be making it again.

Pretty Good, glad the veggies are incorporated.  Added a few red pepper flakes and cooked 8 ounces of elbow macaroni to stir in and  make it into a complete meal.

This was a very good recipe. My husband liked it. I added some hot pepper flakes to spice it up a bit and served it with rice.  Will definately make it again.

This was good, but really I don't know what all the fuss was about. It was really rather ordinary.
