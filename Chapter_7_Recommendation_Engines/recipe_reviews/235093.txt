I give it a 4 for flavor but a 5 for fun.  I made these with my niece after watching a documentary in King Tut.  It was a fun together time and a tasty meal too.  She made me promise to make them again, so this one is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe and the memories.  PS...I forgot to mention that we used tooth picks to secure the strips while wrapping and baking.

I made it with the chicken tenders recipe instead of cooking the normal chicken, so it was crispy and nice. It was hard to wrap the tortillas, when it comes to connecting one to other. But lookes really cute and fun to eat. Good recipe!
