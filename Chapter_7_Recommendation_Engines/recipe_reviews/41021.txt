Since I'd never had lentils before I had to think about this recipe for a while before I tried it. Am I glad I did!  It's exotic, yet not too spicy for my 2 and 4 year olds.  I didn't want a thin soup, because I wanted to serve this over rice so I reduced the liquid to about 4 1/2 cups. When it was finished, I took a tip from the lentil package and added about 1/4 evaporated milk to the pot(instead of sour cream)  and it was excellent Another tip: I've made this twice and think it's just a little better(if that's possible) with a yellow onion cooked in, instead of the green.  The green onion looked great as a garnish, though! :~)

This was really really good. It's a perfect blend of ethnic spices that warms the stomach on a cold afternoon. I think it would be better if it had a creamier, thicker texture as it was on the brothy side. I cooked white rice and put it in after the soup was ready and again, the taste is great. I will make this again.

Very flavorful soup.  My husband and I both loved it!  I really love cilantro so the second time I added a little more.  This is now one of my "regulars".  Thank you for sharing.

I was looking for a good recipe to try out for adding lentils to our diet.  Already had homemade chicken broth and all of the ingredients except the fresh cilantro (I used dried this time).  This recipe is surprisingly quick, easy and tasty! I can't believe what a great taste came from a soup this quick!  I will definitely make this again and again!

This is an excellent recipe.  I did modify it though - I added diced onions, minced garlic, and roughly chopped apricots, then saut√©ed in some olive oil.  It really gives it a nice flavor.  Since I didn't have any carrots, I added some cubed potatoes.  Also, I had some leftover chicken and barley on hand and threw that in.  Near the end, I included some pre-cut spinach for color.  It's quite tasty!  Next time I'll try the recipe exactly.

Very good soup I substituted a small yellow onion for the green onions and then when the soup was complete I made it smooth with an immersion blender. Also substituted plain no fat yogurt for the sour cream for a more traditional curry flavour. Delicious will make again.

I really liked this.  I used a yellow onion instead of green and also added cooked white rice at the end.  I thought it could use a little more spice and would add more chili powder next time.

We loved this recipe.  It is very easy to prepare and very flavorful.  The sour cream completes it perfectly.  My two year old even enjoyed it!

This soup was SO GREAT! Amazing! The kids turned up thier noses, but who cares? So easy to prepare (I used a bag of already cut up carrots) and only 30 minutes until done - I will make this soup OFTEN!

So simple and tastes wonderful.  I'll be making this regularly.  My teenager had 2 bowls full and so did I.  :)  I did use minced onion instead of the green onion, as others suggested.  I had green onion for the garnish.

You can whip up a pot of this in no time flat.

Quite tasty. The recipe says that the sour cream is optional, but the sour cream really makes the recipe, I think.

I really enjoyed this soup!  The first time I made it, I did the whole "sour cream on top" thing in each bowl.  It made it look cloudy in a bad way.  Now I just add the cilantro and eat it with plenty of flat bread on hand!  Yum!  Thank you for the recipe!

I have had this recipe in my recipe box for a long time and it's no longer on this site anymore, but it was the best lentil soup I've ever had!  I wish I had made it sooner, as it will be my go-to recipe from now on.

Great, easy and quick recipe.  First time using lentils so i used red lentils by accident... which turned out great! Also didn't have cilantro so I threw in some cut celery and dried parsley.

Me and a friend decided to do an Indian dinner night.  Out of the 3 different recipes we made this was by far the best.  We put more lentils in and carrots in and a little less water. You could also add spinach.  But it was nice and flavorfull.  Make sure you have a nice strong chicken broth or else the flavor might not be as nice.
