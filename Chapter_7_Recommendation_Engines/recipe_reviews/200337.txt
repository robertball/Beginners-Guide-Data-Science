Excellent! Very rich. I only had skim/fat free mik which worked fine. I will cut the romano cheese down to about 1/8-1/4 cup next time I make it. While it is delicious it's worth noting that this dish (like regular risotto) is very labor intensive--you are standing at the stove stirring nonstop for about an hour.

I thought this tasted great. I did make one small change i cubed the chicken and cooked it in a tsp of the olive oil then added just 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar (instead of 2) at the end of cooking to glaze the chicken then set it aside. Then I continued the recipe in the same pot.

I did a little tweaking - poached the chicken. Didn't use water - it has no flavor - used stock & wine. Needed more liquid/time to get the barley cooked. See my custom version for notes.

Never had barley before in my life. It was good but had a strange taste and texture. I recommend adding some seasonings of your own because it was kind of bland. My dad used hot sauce and said it made it 10 times better.

Nobody in my family enjoyed this meal. I made exactly as is but it had an odd flavor. I typically love barley but this wasn't good.

I chose this recipe to use a left-over roasted chicken breast. I also used my homemade chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth just as a personal preference. We thought this was a great dish. This is not the quickest dish to make but certainly it is very healthy and filling.

This dish is a hearty filling dish that is easy to make vegetarian. The barley is an interesting substitution for rice that lends this towards a winter meal. I followed the directions exactly and it turns out creamy with just the right amount of chew. I'd recommend.

I made this tonight and got RAVE reviews from my Daughter her husband and their 2 teens. Easy economical and DELICIOUS! I have to admit that I tweaked it a bit: I added 1/2 lb. of frozen broccoli crowns to the mix and "topped" it with 6 slices of American Cheese during the last 10 minutes of baking time. Next time I think I'll toss in a can of White Beans too.

I made this with chicken broth. Added a bay leaf and some cilantro seasoning salt and dill toward the end of cooking. It was very good and hubby loved it. Next time I'll add more mushrooms. The only critique of the recipe is that since I've never made risotto I didn't know you're supposed to constantly stir it until I looked up a video online on how to do risotto. A little more specific directions would be good. I didn't add all of the liquid as it seemed like it would be too much. No harm done and I just added the rest of the liquid (about 3/4 cup) to the leftover portion. Hubby loved the flavor; I added a bit of garlic salt and it was perfect.

Very creamy and mild. I used arborrio rice instead to stay gluten free and it turned out great! I also used a 3 cheese blend. Everyone loved it! Would be good served with asparagus on the side. This only served 4 double for a bigger portion or leftovers.

I used Arborio rice instead of the barley also used chicken broth for all of the water and vegetable broth called for in the recipe. I added 1/2 tspn. Basil and omitted the balsamic vinegar when cooking the chicken I simply stir-fried it with the vegetables(sliced thinly length-wise). It was wonderful. I think next time I might add a 1/2 tspn of dried thyme or Rosemary for more flavor.

Very delicious!!! I soaked the barley for 4 hours before cooking which decreased cooking time to 30 minutes. I didn't add the Romano/ parmasean cheese and used almond milk bc a family member is lactose intolerant. It was still extremely delicious.
