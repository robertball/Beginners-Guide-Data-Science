Wonderful mix of flavors!  I did make a few changes, though.  I used fresh oregano and basil, doubled the amount of tomato, and added MUCH more white wine than the original recipe called for (I used at least 1/2 cup of  the wine as the base for the sauce, as others said it was dry).  I also added a little bit of salt to the sauce.  Instead of just shrimp, I used a seafood mix of shrimp, scallops, and squid and tossed it all with spinach linguini.  Definitely a keeper!

The best meal I've ever cooked, and one of the best I've ever tasted.  I cooked for a friend who loved it and in a week I had to cook it three times for all the friends that she told about it!

One little glitch is that it seems a bit dry with the ingredients posted here, I increased the portions of everything but the pasta by a half and it was perfect.

Also, try adding some pitted black olives, it gives it a better look and taste.

Outstanding!!! I thought the idea of feta cheese with shrimp sounded odd, but I was SO wrong! It was very tasty! (I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the pasta to sauce ratio is a bit off; you don't need to use 16 oz. of pasta; just use about 2/3 of that.) I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes rather than fresh, added a few pinches of crushed red pepper and a splash or two of half & half at the end. Oh my goodness! What an awesome recipe! My husband and I both had seconds and there's still some left for my lunch tomorrow. I'd been looking for something new to do with shrimp and now I will look no further! Thanks so much for a terrific recipe!!!

Absolutely delicious! I used Farfalle (bowtie) pasta, added extra garlic, then added fresh spinach to the tomatoes and topped off everything with a sprinkle of crushed red pepper.  The feta I had on hand was "Crumbled with Garlic and Herbs" and I would deliberately buy it again for this recipe.  I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to anyone!

This was awesome.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using frozen shrimp. This made it faster and equally as yummy.

Excellent!  It was quick to make and everyone loved it.  I used canned Delmonte chopped tomatoes (14 oz)Italian Flavoring.

This was a definite winner.  I made this for a family of friends, and everyone loved it.  I took the advice of another review and used a half a cup of white wine.  Instead of cooking the tomatoes in the oil, I used the wine sauce that was left over from cooking the shrimp. If you are using Roma tomatoes, which you should, use a few more than the recipe calls for.

We didn't have any tomatoes so we used a can of diced tomatoes, which worked out quite well. Next time we'll use two cans. The feta was a great addition.

So simple, yet delicious! We loved this dish and my husband requested it again just three nights later! I took the advice of another reviewer and used the frozen shrimp (be sure they're fully thawed or they'll add more liquid from the melted ice!) and that saved me a ton of time. This recipe is a keeper - next time I'm making more, as it made for a great lunch the next day!

A new favorite! This is very tasty and soooo easy to make. Resturant quality. Followed the recipe exactly, however next time I would add a little more tomato and white wine, only because I like a lot of sauce (personal preference). I highly suggest adding this one to the recipe box.  UPDATE-made this again, and doubled the amount of white wine and added an extra tomato.  I also served it with 1/2 pound of angel hair instead of 1 pound of linguini. With the adaptations, I would give it 10 stars!

I decided to try this and add a few of my own tricks to this recipe and to even vote 5 stars is putting it mildly!!! My family,particularly hubbie, gave me a standing ovation. I used a huge head of garlic, minced in 1/4 c. + 3 heaping Tbspn. butter in pan to somewhat bring down the taste, cooked shrimp to an almost done consistancy adding 1 tsp PARSLEY and BASIL instead of oregano. Taking pan off heat add 4 oz heavy whipping cream and 1tsp crushed red pepper (careful to add to liking-I like it spicy!) mix in warm pan. Instead of adding tomatoes from the can I diced 5-6 ROMA tomatoes and added to sauce. Happily poured over Linguine and was very giving with Garlic & Herb Feta crumbles. Serve with homemade bruscetta... mmm Purr-fecto!

This was wonderful!!  I made it for a side dish at my Dad's birthday bbq and it was the talk of the party!  Everyone loved it and was asking for the recipe.  I adjusted the herbs and garlic, added much more than called for, and added about a cup of the white wine, 2 cans of garlic and olive oil tomoatoes, and a pound of frozen shrimp.  The feta that I used was sundried tomato and basil feta.  The dish was to die for!  Thanks for such a great recipe :)

This was a delicious pasta! I hate when people rate based on their "changes" but after reading the reviews I did the following: Made 3/4 lb of pasta (only two people were eating, anyhow), used one can of diced tomatoes (not drained) and one chopped tomato, 1/2 cup of wine and fresh herbs. I also used 1/2 chicken and 1/2 shrimp. DELICIOUS! I will be making this one on a very regular basis! What a perfect summer pasta!

Very, very good...even with individulal variations. I used 3 Roma tomatoe's, fresh Basil and added some mushrooms, onion, zucchini I grew (first time...isn't hard)plus more wine per other reviewer and some Smart Balance with the Olive oil/wine and extra garlic. I use reduced fat Feta and whole grain pasta also. The extra vegetables and sauce balanced the 16oz of pasta...or not, depends how you like it. Definately a "company friendly" recipe.

I was between 3 and 4 stars for this...it is a good pasta meal but the recipe needs a lot of doctoring in my opinion.  I added more garlic, tomatoes, wine and used fresh basil.  I also cut down the amount of pasta and it still was too much for the amount of sauce so it would have been VERY dry had I not added extra of the aforementioned ingredients.  The taste was good though, but I think next time I will add some mushrooms, olives, roasted peppers and/or onions.  There is just a little something missing, but it still is worth making...a good base recipe!

This was so good!  I increased the wine to about 1/2 a cup using 1/4 C for the shrimp (I used frozen) and 1/4 C for the tomatoes.  I also used 3 roma tomatoes and a pound of shrimp.  I used about 4oz of feta cheese with herbs.  I also added fresh spinach (about a cup of baby) to the tomatoes about 2 minutes before they were done.  At the same time I added fresh basil and oragano and minced garlic instead of garlic cloves.  This was very good.  Next time I will add about twice as much spinach and additional garlic.  I had the leftovers the next day and they were awesome as well.

This was pretty good and very easy!  I used stewed tomatoes instead of fresh and it still turned out yummy!  I added steamed broccoli on top which added some nice color and went nicely too.

This recipe was fantastic! I did make a few small changes. I added 1/2 cup of wine(chardonay) instead of the 1 tbs the recipe calls for.  I also omitted the 3rd tbs of olive oil since I had plently of cooking liquid to cook the tomatoes & spices in. I only let the tomatoes simmer 5 mins before adding the shrimp back in & assembling the dish. This prevented the fresh tomatoes from breaking down too much & becoming a "sauce" instead of diced tomatoes. I seasoned to taste with salt and pepper. I also added a good handful of chopped Italian flat leaf parsley at the end which gave it a nice burst of color and freshness.

Deeelish! I made it for our wedding anniversary dinner and it was wonderful! Next time I make this recipe I will: double the shrimp, double the feta and halve the pasta. My husband suggested putting in some cayenne for a little kick if you like. I also ended up making am emergency substitution as my tomatoes were yucky when I got them out of the refrigerator. I opened a can of diced tomatoes and drained them before adding them to the pan and the end result was fabulous! A nice quick and easy company dish that will impress!

I have shellfish issues but my husband loves it SO....I tried this for him. Before I tossed the shrimp with the pasta I removed a portion of the pasta for ME! Worked fabulous! He ate his shrimp/pasta and I had just pasta. I followed recipe precisely except that I used a can of tomatoes because it's winter. This is a keeper for us. We can both eat it and he loved loved it! Esp the feta!

Even when I increased the ingredients by a half for everything except the pasta, I still found this pretty bland! I used fresh garlic, fresh tomatoes, and then dried herbs. If I did it over, I would use fresh herbs and Italian seasoned canned tomatoes, I think...the feta cheese was a good addition. When I asked my husband what he thought, he said, "bland shrimp and noodles." I also bought fresh shrimp and had to peel and devein them all so by the time this dinner was done I was beat! I am shocked that I couldn't taste the garlic, I used nearly a whole bulb! Very disappointing... I'll buy the frozen already shelled and deveined shrimp from now on. It'll be a while before I try this one again. Thanks though.

This was a HUGE hit in our house!  I used a pasta blend that I had on hand.  I added chopped fresh asparagus that I cooked along with the tomatoes and I also added an extra splash of wine.  My husband and four year old couldn't get enough. It will become a family staple!

I incorporated the following suggestions from other reviewers:  used 1/2 c wine; more garlic (1 head in total); 1 can diced tomatoes, drained; and added some crushed red pepper, salt, and pitted and sliced kalamata olives.  I tasted the sauce once it was done cooking, but before I added the shrimp, feta, and noodles and I was pretty nervous!!  It didn't taste like much, but at least it wasn't horrible.  However, once I mixed it altogether, I breathed a sigh of relief -- it was actually pretty good (mostly thanks to the feta, I'm sure)!  I wouldn't say it's my favorite dish in the world, but it IS super easy, convenient, and different than most of our "easy convenient" dinners, so I know we'll have this again.

Delicious!! My whole family loved this recipe.  I used 8oz of bow tie pasta, 28 oz of italian diced tomatoes (drained), 6oz of garlic & herb feta cheese, the seasonings, 4oz of half & half, and 3/4 C of Chardonney and garlic.  Will definitely make this again......Very easy recipe.

I gave this only 4 stars because of the changes I had to make. Since other reviewers said it was not enough sauce, I used 12 oz. angel hair. I used 1-1/2 lbs. cooked shrimp so I added it at the end. I used more wine to cook the garlic & added 1 14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes, juice and all, 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper and 1 cup fat-free half & half. Used 1 Tbsp. fresh basil & 1/2 tsp. dried oregano and more wine. Had only a 4-oz. pkg. feta cheese w/garlic & herbs that I added with the shrimp. We added fresh parmesan at the table. My husband asked twice what the name of the recipe was because it was so good. Will definitely make again.

I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time.  It is like the old German farmers around here made years ago.  The only change I made was to process the meats, onions and spices int the food processor unil they were super fine.  It turned out a good bit like braunschweiger.  Excellent.

I made this tonight for dinner.  This was really, really good for a pasta dish without sauce, which is what my family is used to eating.  I did take the advice of another viewer; I added an extra tablespoon of white wine, extra garlic (just because my family loves garlic) and I used a chicken bouillon cube to add a little more favor, because  viewers stated the dish was bland.

This was so good!  I took the advice of the others and added a 1/2 cup of wine and a few splashes of half and half.  It was delish, and I will be making it again.  I also added a can of black olives.

Followed recipe exactly except for using fresh basil.  Way too dry - even after adding additional oil and wine. And the pound of pasta was overload. A full package of feta cheese (6oz) was also too much for our taste.  With some tweaking, this could be very good.

Great recipe. Used 1/2 cup of white wine as recommended by other reviewers. Also, I divided the amount of pasta by 2 in order to have a better pasta/sauce ratio. Will definitely make again.

This was soooooo good!  I made some minor adjustments:  Used 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with basil & oregano, 3/4 cup of white wine.  I added some some red pepper flakes with the tomato mixture and a about 2 splashes of half n half.  To thicken the sauce, I added about half a tablespoon of corn starch.  YUMMY!  My husband typically doesn't care for tomatoes but he went for seconds!

I made this last night and it was fabulous. I did change a couple of things as others did, I used 2 pounds of small tiger prawns, simmered a 28 ounce tin of drained diced tomatoes in the wine after I removed the prawns, simmered for about 20 min. then added 1 pint of whipping cream, salt & pepper and 1 tsp red pepper flakes. I used a little less than 1 pound of pasta, added all the pasta to the sauce and simmered that for a couple of minutes and then added the feta and prawns to heat through, it was very flavourful and light, fantastic recipe that I will make alot. thank you

My husband loved this one.  I had to make a few changes, but overall it was very good.  I don't like dry pasta so I added about 3/4 cup chicken broth and 1/3 cup of wine.  Unfortunately I could not use fresh tomatoes so I used canned, with fresh basil.  2 TB of olive oil to cut calories and fat and 5 oz of feta (1 cup) and about 2/3 package of pasta.  I needed some pepper and a bit of salt, but this reduced calories to about 420 per serving instead of the 600+ listed below.  Oh, and I added some brocolli and asparagus.  Will definitely make again.

This dish was so-so, the shrimp and feta combo was really good but it was dry over all. Would make again and maybe put some more tomatoes in it.

To make this even easier, I used two cans of italian diced tomatoes. Have tried fire-roasted tomatoes w/ great results.  I also up the wine to 1/2 cup and use a little more feta. Very good..will make again!

I think you will have to make adjustments to this recipe!   I had to use one large & one small can of diced tomatoes in order for this recipe to produce the true amount of servings listed.  I only used half the feta & it gave the sauce a very balanced flavor.  I think if we had used the amount called for, it would have had an overpowering effect.  We used about a 1/2 cup of wine.  I think this recipe would've been better & alot less work without the shrimp. It was good overall but next time I would leave out the shrimp & add 1-2 shallots in with the base.  Even still, people seemed to enjoy this dish.

This recipes was good but not fantastic. It was really simple to make. Next time I would use a couple more tomatos, more garlic and maybe a little more wine and also I'd add the feta earlier so it gets a little melty. All in all, with some changes I will be making this recipe again and again.

I love shrimp but this recipe is sorely lacking in flavor...I added red pepper flakes to offer something that would step out of the bland.  Will make again with adjustments.

It was to bland for me. So for the original recipe I give a 2 star. After some tweaking of adding more wine and garlic and adding some butter I was much happier.

My family liked this, but we all agreed it was missing something. I agree with other reviewers that the noodle to sauce ratio is way off; next time I will add more wine & more tomatoes. I think I will also add some veggies to it.

This is a very good pasta.  It is not a very "heavy" meal, after eating a lot of it you wont feel sick.  I like it with even more feta cheese than it calls for.  One comment I would like to make is that it lacks a punch of flavor.  There is no real dominant taste which makes it something that goes well with other foods.  Definitly worth saving the recipe and making for guests.

I followed the recipe fairly closely and it turned out well.  The flavors are not very strong so next time I would try to add more spices or use fresh ones. Overall a good, quick meal.

I used 1/2 cp. or so of wine, 1 lg. can tomatoes diced and drained, extra herbs and 2 pkgs. feta cheese. Also increased garlic and used about 2lbs shrimp, deveined, peeled, and tail-off (frozen). This was fantastic but made enough for atleast 4 people!!!!

EASY!!!! Next time I make I'll add more wine & probably use diced tomatoes since our home grown are done for the year. Adding more of the basil & oregano will be done also unless I use the Italian diced tomatoes. Using reta chesse that has garlic, basil or tomato adds also. Hubby liked this because it was a "light" sauce for the pasta.

Personally, I like "saucier" pasta dishes, this was too dry for me, too much pasta, ended up being dry.  Maybe next time will double the recipe for the sauce, this recipe has potential, it does need a kick though, like crushed red pepper other reviewers suggested, I added fresh spinach myself.
Great base recipe, don't be afraid to experiment.

I agree with other viewers, to me it was bland as written, for one thing it needs salt (just under 1 teaspoon). I didn't have wine, just used water. It also needed at least double on the basil and a good bit more garlic. I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used a 16 oz. jar of tomatoes that I canned from our garden this year, and 8 oz. dry angel hair pasta in place of 1 lb. of linguine. The dish was not dry at all and the tomato sauce and cheese blended well. I didn't have feta, I did have crumbled goat cheese with basil (on top of the doubled basil)......YUMMY......The trick is to taste the sauce making sure it is highly seasoned before adding in the pasta, shrimp, and cheese. The seasoning will tone down once the other ingredients are added. Even though I had to tweak this recipe to suit our taste, I still give it 5 stars because everyone has different taste buds and this is a really good recipe. 
My husband and mother-in-law loved it.

Fantastic, simple and delicious enough to serve to company.  I added some fresh spinach to the tomato mixture for the last 4 minutes of cooking and tossed some sliced olives in too.  JWEARY15 - you should be proud.  This definitely tastes like something out of a high end italian restaurant.  My hubby has eaten 3 plates so far!  :)

Loved this! I scaled down the pasta to about 2/3 a box and used sun-dried tomato feta (and less than 1/2 a tub - that stuff is SALTY.  Added more fresh tomato and used a bit more oil and wine to make more of a 'sauce'.  This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious! I was out of white wine and squirted in some lemon juice instead. This had just the right amount of creaminess and seasoning for us. I think it would be good with chicken too.

Delicious and very easy to make! I made a couple of changes based on other reviews.. I used less pasta, roma tomatos (3), 7 garlic cloves, and much more wine, about 1/2 a cup! I also added a little salt.. overall, excellent dish!

This turned out to be an excellent dish! I'm an amateur, very amateur cook, looking to step up my game and this was the perfect dish to begin with. I read many of the reviews and, based on them, altered the dish a little. I added 1/2 cup of white wine (chardonnay), I used one more tomato, a half of stick of butter (unsalted), onion powder, garlic powder and red crushed pepper pinches. DELICIOUS and a HUGE hit with the family.

The overall taste of this was good, but it is WAY TOO DRY! I usually tend to make recipes 'as is', and not modify too much, if at all. I read some reviews that this was too dry, but didn't listen! However, if you enjoy your pasta dry with a grainy texture, then follow the recipe. The pasta seemed to soak up what little liquid there was to begin with - and I even added a little more wine then called for. After plated and eating a few bites, I ended up putting all the pasta back into the pot and adding a can of diced tomatoes to give it moisture, which made all the difference. It was alright, however I don't think I'll be making this again.

Sounded like this would be tasty esp with all the great reviews but it very bland.  Used a wine I never heard of that was given to me.. guess that could be part of the problem.  Anyhow, even tho I increased the wine to 1/2 cup to make more sauce I had to doctor it up a lot to make it edible and the changes I made def did the trick.  I used 3 fresh tomatoes (will use 4 next time) also added about 1/2 tsp ea of garlic powder and thyme, 1 tsp crushed red pepper, a generous tblsp of real bacon bits, 1/4 tsp of black pepper and kosher salt to taste.  Sprinkled with parmesan cheese to serve.  All this totally saved it from the trash can!  My version I will make again and I may try this one again with a different white wine.  If it turns out like my first try I'll just do what I did this time.

The first time I made this, I made it as written and it was great. The second time, I added a bit more white wine (1/3 cup), plain goat cheese instead of feta, and a can of diced Roma tomatoes (drained). It was just as good, maybe a bit less salty than the original. I especially like how the goat cheese melted down and became like a sauce, blended with the wine, oil, and garlic. This is definitely a dish you can play around with and still expect above average results. Next time I think I'll add a chopped chili pepper...

I would give this about 4.5 stars.  After reading some of the other reviews, I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup of white wine.  I would also say to add some sea salt and black pepper.  Definitely makes more than the 5 servings (more like 8 servings.

Good and quick and easy, the best combo.  Didn't really measure the herbs and wine, also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes.  I will use two cans of diced tomatoes next time or fresh tomatoes.  I also added red pepper flakes and some onion powder.  Will add this to the rotation.

Very good, I loved it.  Only thing I did different was to up the wine to 1/2 cup and use a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  Makes a little more sauce this way. I also used a garlic, herb feta cheese and would use that again.  Very tasty, its a keeper.  Thanks for posting this one.

This recipe is awesome. I can't stop making it. Made it again for a dinner party and everyone raved about it. I cooked the shrimp and garlic in the oil but used about 1/2 cup wine. I drained that into a bowl and mix oil and 1/2 cup wine to cook the tomatoes. Once the pasta was cooked I added all the ingredients, tossed the feta cheese, put on a plate and topped with grated Lucatelli cheese.

This recipe is out of this world.  Sooo easy, flavorful and yummo!  The only thing I added at the end was plain black pepper to give it a little kick.  Other then that, a perfect meal!

I followed previous advice and doubled the tomatoes (I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes), used 1 cup wine, and only used 1/2 of the cooked pasta.  It was yummy, I will season the shrimp ahead of time with S and P,lemon juice and lemon zest.

Very quick and easy meal to prepare. I probably should have taken the advice in adding a bit more white wine. I melted butter into a pan and added the spices along with garlic and chives. I cooked the shrimp on the opposite side of the pan in the white win and just a touch of olive oil. Once the shrimp were done, I folded the pasta into the seasoned melted butter and then folded in the cooked shrimp. I was so excited to eat, I forgot to add the tomatoes. I didn't have feta on hand so swapped with parmesan. Look forward to making this again. Thanks!!!

I don't think enough wine or herbs were used to have the flavor needed.  However, the shrimp and feta pair well together.

Wow, this is an excellent recipe. Both my husband and I loved it.  I made quite a bit extra and there were no leftovers! I used frozen shrimps and fresh basil instead of dried. Thanks for submitting this recipe, we will definitely make this again.

Thank you for this fantastic recipe. It was quick and easy to put together, and just so good. I threw in some canned artichokes and sliced olives I had, and since I didn't have fresh tomato on hand, I used canned diced tomato, so obviously I did take some liberty with the recipe. Since I'm trying to watch my weight, I used only 3.5 oz of reduced fat feta and found it was plenty, and served it over whole wheat angel hair. Totally delicious. The recipe is such an awesome base, I think it would have been so great as is but is easy to add to as well.

I made this tonight and it was good but...I did triple the herbs and used about 1 cup white wine.  As the sauce simmered, I added wine to keep it from getting too thick.  I also only used 3 ounces feta cheese and used the other 3 ounces to top each serving.  I also grated fresh black pepper over each serving.  I used about 14 ounces fettuccine (all I had) and it was too much pasta.  Next time I wouldn't use more than 12 ounces pasta.  I liked the quickness of the recipe.

This is very good, although I made a few adjustments. I prefer more sauce with my pasta, and I assumed this would be on the dry side so I made the following changes: Increased the white wine to 1 cup, doubled the olive oil, and added 3 Tbls. of butter & bit of lemon juice. I also added some fresh basil, only because I had it on hand anyway, also grape tomatoes instead of regular because that's all I had. This was delicious, I couldn't stop eating it with warm crusty bread! Thanks (:

This was exactly what I was looking for.  The only things I changed was to use 1/2 cup white wine as suggested in previous reviews AND I used a Lemon, Garlic and Oregano Feta cheese that I happened to have on hand, which really added to the flavor. Also, since there's only 2 of us, I cut the amount of pasta in half and it was the perfect amount for the recipe.  My husband loved it and I will definitely make it again.  Want to try different flavors of feta.

This is definitely one of the easiest and most delicious meals I've ever made.  Definitely a keeper in my recipe box.  The next time I make it I will use more of the white wine... I followed instructions and it did turn out just a bit on the dry side..  Will follow other people's suggestion, but all in all - delicious!!

Made this tonight for the first time. Since I was trying to use ingredients I had on hand, I used Rigatoni instead of Linguine and used two cans of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. As with other reviewers, I used around 1/2 cup wine. The taste was GREAT, but it is definitely chunky with the tomatoes. I will definitely make this again, but perhaps blend half of the tomatoes first.

Very very tasty.  Mine came out a bit dry though despite the fact that I added more wine.  Next time I would add the extra wine to the tomatoe saute instead of at the beginning.

This dish was just fantastic!!!  The slight changes I made was to add 1/2 cup of white wine(it cooks down nicely)to the tomato mixture.  I also cooked the shrimp in olive oil and butter along with the fresh garlic. Oh soooo Good!!

This was awesome, but I made a few changes. Following other reviews I increased the wine to a 1/2 cup.  I sauteed spinach with mushrooms, adding a couple T of butter to the wine, garlic and olive oil. After the veggies cooked down I added 4 roma tomatoes fresh basil and fresh oregano. I used small penne, and continually seasoned with salt and pepper. After a few changes this was superb and still relatively healthy.

I love this dish!  I usually double everything except for the pasta.  The only changes I make are to add black olives and use farfalle (bow tie) pasta.  I would also recommend Chardonnay as the wine.  I actually prefer this dish cold and it's wonderful to take for lunch!

I modified just a bit as others suggested and it was a hit with the hubby as well as with my little ones! Used only 3/4 lb of spaghetti and will use even less next time and will definitely add more garlic. Used 1/2 cup white wine (nice buttery chardonnay). May even add green onion next time too. Very pleased with the results so far.

I made a few adjustments and the end result was really delicious.  I felt like the sauce to pasta ratio was off, as mentioned.  To make more sauce (without making it heavy by adding cream or milk) I added some chicken broth and increased the white wine.  I also added some pepper.  The feta cheese I used didn't seem to melt too much and wasn't too strong, but it was a great touch.  Wonderful, light, easy dish.  I used frozen shrimp, too.  I also cut back on the butter.

One of our favorites.  This is served at least 3 times a month.  I use the refrigerated pasta..since it is a bit less than what is called for there is plenty of sauce.  I add another tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of butter when I am cooking the tomatoes.  Fabulous dish!

Very Tasty!  But way too much pasta.  I think you could use half the amt of pasta and twice the other ingredients and be fine.  I also used canned tomatoes and they worked great.

This was one of the yummyest dinners I have EVER made.  My husband could not believe that I had made it.  I took some of the others suggestions and basically doubled everything for the sauce.  I also added a full half cup of heavy cream.  I forgot to add the pepper flakes-so next time I will add those just for the kick...it is wonderful as is!!!  Thanks for a new family favorite!!!!!

This was pretty good.  Like other reviewers I thought this pasta was a little dry.  To make it a little less fattening I only used 1 tblsp of oil and used 3 tblsp of chicken broth and 1/4 cup of pasta water.  I also added a little crushed red pepper and wheat pasta.  I think I will use less pasta next time.

This was really great tasting, easy and beautiful as well!  I used canned tomatoes and only about 2oz of feta since that was all I had but it was still delicious.  I will certainly make this again.

This was delicious!  I took the advice of others and added less pasta (too litte actually...probably 3/4 lb. would be perfect), more tomatoes, more shrimp and also added black olives.  Next time I make this, I am going to add fresh spinach and scallops.

I increased the amount of shrimp, decreased the pasta and used 1/2 regular tomoatoes and 1/2 sun dried tomatoes.  It was great for a romantic dinner and then I personally devoured the leftovers the next day.  Fantastic!

I've been making this recipe for several years now.  Ive made it as written, and although tasty, it's just a little dry for my taste.  I've since tried other variations based on reviewers suggestions.   I've found that a 14.5oz can of diced fire roasted tomatoes, and an 8oz. can of tomato sauce work best.  I add a teaspoon of sugar, and I let it simmer until soft.  I also used RPCOOKIE's advice to use more white wine.  I use a half cup.  Also based on another review, if I have it available, will stir in a little cream.  Restaurant quality is mentioned in the compliments I receive for this recipe.  My satisfaction comes from sitting back, watching and listening to the grunts and groans as my guests inhale this meal.  What an awesome recipe to work with!  Thank you for sharing!

This combination of flavors is outstanding.  Without looking at any reviews in advance, I did increase the wine to at least 1/2 cup, used 1 cup fresh basil instead of the dried herbs, and 1/2 the pasta (used orzo).  My partner has said at least 5 times now how much he liked the meal.

Pretty good, very easy. Next time I will use less pasta, more tomatoes and a little more cheese. I also used fresh basil. Had good flavor but a little skimpy on the shrimp. Will definitely make again for ease of prep and fresh flavors.

This is a winner!  The flavour combination is excellent.  I added a bit of ground chili pepper and some chopped parsley and a squeeze of lemon at the end.  Even though I made a few minor changes, I love the simplicity of this dish.  All the ingredients enhance one another.  The feta and the tomatoes and the basil go so well together.  It has a very fresh  flavor.

Don't underestimate the simplicity of this recipe, it was very good. As one other reviewer stated though, fresh herbs are the way to go (if you use them regularly). I probably used about 3tbsp of wine and just used canned diced tomatoes. I didn't need nearly the amount of feta in the recipe, but you can adjust to your taste. Will definitely make again!

Reading reviews, we used crushed tomatoes instead of fresh.  My husband thought this rated an 8.5 out of 10.  Me and my stepdaughter thought it was "shrimp spaghetti", and just gave it a 6.  I didn't add 6 oz (a whole container) of feta cheese either, as it would have overpowered the entire dish!  Thanks for the interesting concept tho!

This was pretty good, but I thought it was lacking in flavor, just a bit.  I added a bit more white wine,  used fresh basil and added black pepper.  I'll make this again, but I think I'll add some onion, red pepper flakes and either some baby spinach or some broccoli.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe as written except that I used a can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh, I served over couscous and I used lemon juice in place of the wine.  The entire family loved it and asked for more!  A definite keeper!

CANNED CHOPPED TOMATOES GIVE IT MORE MOISTURE WHEREAS THE FRESH TOMOATOES DON'T GIVE ENOUGH MOISTURE BUT ARE STILL GOOD TO INCLUDE. THIS WAS EXCELLENT.  I WILL KEEP THIS AS A FAVORITE.

Very tasty dish.  I read the reviews prior to making this meal and so I made the following changes.  I used 1 cup wine and 1 can diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic.  I did not add any dried oregano or basil.  I used a 4 ounce container of crumbled garlic and herb feta cheese.  I enjoyed the lightness of this meal and I will definitely make it again.

Good recipe, improved with some changes.  Agree with other reviews that the ratio of sauce to pasta is way off.  Suggest halving the amount of pasta, doubling the tomatoes adding some salt and fresh crushed pepper.  I am not sure of the other recommendation that others make of increasing the wine as most of it evaporates, specially if added early.

This was sooo good!  I took the reviewers advice and substituted red wine vinegar for the white wine since I didn't have any.  Like her, I used 2 T to sautee the shrimp.  I added another T when I did the tomatoes and instead of oil, I added a T of butter.  I also added some leftover mushrooms.  In addition, I added a little bit of a pack of dry caesar dressing mix for added flavor.  Next time, I think I'll double the recipe, but keep the amount of pasta the same.  Also, I might try adding zuccini.  My kids even liked this one!

The best pasta I have ever made!!!  I made a few changes to match what I had on hand and my own taste. (No white wine) Make sure you have plenty of water in a large pot to cook the pasta and salt the water liberally.  Cook 6-8 min. I cooked 5 cloves of garlic in about 3 tablespoons of olive oil (30 sec. if instantly sizzling) at little under medium heat.  I then added about 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar(in place of the wine)in a metal sautee pan (not non-stick), and threw in the shrimp.  After the shrimp was cooked, I pulled them out.  I added another 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil and another 1 tablespoon garlic red wine vinegar.  I also added chopped black olives, 3 large roma tomatoes,one half tablespoon of plum preserves (also in place of wine, could use grape as well), salt, pepper, basil, oregano, lemon pepper (didn't have a lemon), and green onions.  (I didn't have sundried tomatoes or I would have chopped and added them as well.)  They cooked together for about 5 minutes (green onions were added in the last 2 minutes).  I then crumbled (good quality) feta cheese into the pan and added the pasta and tossed.  Parmasean cheese was added when plated.  I told my wife I would have paid for this in a nice restaurant, and I consider myself very picky when it comes to gourmet food.  Good luck and good eating!

I tried this recipe last week without changing a thing expect the amount of white wine used. The outcome was pretty good. I tired it again this week and changed a few things and it was awesome! My way does have a lot more fat in it though :).  I used butter instead of olive oil and I used a can of garlic and onion diced tomato. I added about a half cup of half and half and also added some spinach. To top it off I added about a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes which gave it a nice kick!

What a great recipe!! The flavors all blended well together. I followed the advice of others and halved the pasta and increased the cooking wine. I can't wait to make this again.

Delicious! I did however saute the shrimp first until they just started to turn pink, removed them from from the pan and sauteed the garlic adding the tomatoes a little later.I poured in the wine until it looked right for the sauce I wanted.I then added the shrimp to cook just a minute or so longer I added it to cooked Linguine added a handful of both fresh basil and oregano and the feta cheese. It was excellent.

This dish was fantastic.  I did add a half onion chopped and changed the prep method.  I sauteed the onion and garlic with the oil and wine until the onion was soft, added the tomatoes, a bay leaf, oregano (I realized I didn't have any basil) and simmered a bit, added the cheese (I used tomato basil feta) and then the shrimp.  I let this cook for about 3 - 5 minutes until the shrimp were cooked and tossed with about a half pound of pasta.  I do beleive this has to be the best shrimp dish I've ever had!  Thanks so much Jweary15!! :D

This dish was sooo good! I did as others recommended and used about a half cup of wine and half pound of pasta. I only had 4 oz. of feta and that was just the right amount. My husband who doesn't even like pasta went back for seconds and took leftovers for lunch today. Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for myself with a few modifications.  I used frozen shrimp and canned tomatoes, and since I didn't have any feta cheese, I used a mix of mozarella and cheddar jack cheese.  I also used a little more wine and it turned out excellent!  I will definately make this for my husband and family.

Very easy and a surprisingly great flavor combination! We prefer to have a little more sauce, though, so we ended up sort of doubling the sauce. The tomatoes cooked down a bit more than we expected, but it turned into a sort of very light marinara sauce. We will definitely revisit this recipe!

I loved this recipe, I have already made it twice, I followed some others advice and used fresh herbs instead of dried.  I also added black olives since my family loves them and added extra wine.  Very wonderful!!!

This was really good.  It had more flavor than I expected.  I added about 1/3 cup white wine and doubled the spices, but I only used the called for amount of tomato.  Next time I think I'll double the tomato also and make a little more sauce as well.  Definitely a keeper!

Aside from adding extra wine I followed this recipe exactly.  It was good flavor but not very strong.  Will need to double up on spices and it'll be better.

This is a good basic recipe that rates 3 stars. It can very easily be made to rate 5 stars.  I found the recipe as written to be a little lacking in flavor, and there wasn't enough "sauce".  I made it again using 1/2 c. white wine, fresh basil, spinach, 4 fresh tomatoes and some red pepper flakes for a little "kick".

Very good recipe.  I added alot more garlic b/c we love garlic !  Followed  the rest of the recipe closely with the exception of adding about 2 cups of broth.  We don't like our pasta too dry.  I also added a handful of cut leaf spinach just to give it a little color. This is a very easy recipe.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I had to use 1 can of petite diced tomatoes.  You could also kick it up by adding some red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese.  Thanks for sharing.

Was a good dish as recipe is written.  Hubby liked it OK, but he's not one for alot of seafood dishes like I am.  It seemed to need some salt or more seasoning to be better.  I liked it!

We loved this recipe!  I sometimes substitute chicken broth for the wine, and use about a 1/4 cup.  I used two cans diced tomatoes with garlic and onion, and cooked, frozen shrimp.  The feta is a perfect combination with the tomatoes, shrimp, and pasta!  I think this meal took me about 20 mins total to make from start to finish, since I used the already cut up tomatoes.  I will make this often for my family.

This was my son's first time cooking, he made this for his girlfriend, it was very easy and very tasty. He followed a couple suggestions in the reviews and it turned out perfectly, she was very impressed. For those people who don't like shrimp, chicken can easily be substituted. We will definitely be making this again.

I made this with angel hair pasta as that's what I had on hand. Also threw in some fresh basil that needed using up. If I were to make this again, the only thing I would do differently is to remove the tomato skins - they were kinda annoying. Great recipe though. Thanks, Jessie!

As is, it is dry. I wish I had read more reviews before I made it. It was good though and I did add more tomato, and wine because it looked like it needed more. I would go with the reviewer that added 1/2 again except on the pasta, that would be perfect. And next time I think I'm going to add artichoke hearts when the tomato is added in. Loved it though!

This was tasty.  Ingredient list did not seem correct.  I used only half of the one pound of pasta that I boiled and almost tripled the olive oil, white wine, and used 4 tomatoes.  Added some spices....of course everyone likes their own 'zing', but I always love to use Old Bay seasoning with shellfish.  In the future, I would love to see just when these recipes first appeared on this website.  I make an effort not to try the really new ones until there are some reviews and comments from others who have tried it.

I would give this a 4.5 rating.  I read the reviews and added more wine to make more sauce.  I also used fresh basil (because I had it).  It needed some more zing to it so I added red pepper flakes and then we really liked it. I would try this recipe again.

My husband and I really liked it. I used less pasta than the recipe called for and still had a lot of left overs. We also used little corkscrew pasta instead of linguini, because that is what I had on hand.

Was excellent!  I also used 1/2 c. wine as some people suggested.  Also used 1 can of diced tomatoes, which worked out fine.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

Loved this.  Definitely needs salt, but I am a big believer that salt should be added minimally at first, and let your diners add it to their individual preferences.
Yes, increase wine to 1/2 cup (or even a full cup) and let it reduce after cooking the shrimp.  Also, a local restaurant does a version of this, but uses browned butter and dried hazelnuts.

I didn't have any tomatoes so I took a shortcut & used some store bought bruschetta that I had. I cooked the shrimp in the oil & a touch of garlic, then added the bruschetta. I topped it with feta & broiled it for a few mins. till it browned. A quick, light & tasty meal. A definite keeper!

This recipe has become a staple in our house.  It also tastes well as leftovers.  I took the following shortcuts and it still turned out great:
- Use pre-cooked, cleaned frozen shrimp. I still saute but not as long.
- I've also used canned plum tomatoes.

Excellent!  I was in a hurry and in the end forgot to add the feta cheese but the pasta was delicious even so.  Adding the feta will only improve the flavour I'm sure :)  UPDATE:  Added the feta this time plus some spinach at the time of the tomatoes... SO GOOD!

I made this recently for my husband and 4 year old daughter. We all loved it. It was very easy to make and very good. The only time-consuming part was shelling the shrimp, but you can do that while the pasta is cooking. Will definitely make this again.

If you do this one right, it pretty much tastes better than anything you would find in an italian restaurant around here. However, if you do it wrong, it's just dry  and nothing but trouble.

As suggested by a few others, I changed a few things. I added a tablespoon of butter to the wine/oil. I used about 1/2 can of Trader Joe's fire roasted diced tomatoes. And I added one pound of asparagus, cut into one inch pieces. I also used Mediterranean spiced feta. Make sure you toss and serve it right away, it's not as good when it starts to get cold. It does look really nice with the asparagus adding some color. Also, I purchased all of the ingredients at Trader Joe's and it was much less expensive than a large grocery store.

Pretty fast, very easy and my husband and I loved it.  Thanks!
I served it with asparagus cooked in tinfoil in the oven with butter and garlic and wine seasoning.  The wine I used for the recipe was an inexpensive pinot grigio which we also drank with dinner.

I have made this twice. I have to say this recipe depends on the shrimp used. If the shrimp is fresh the meal is absolutely delicious!!! I also add grated cheese (either Romano, or parm) and thought that made it even nicer.

This is a great recipe. I added some thinly sliced zucchini and cooked it with the tomatoes --it was perfect, because my boyfriend doesn't really care for shrimp, but he still had a filling meal with the zucchini there. I also used canned tomatoes, only because I didn't have any fresh ones. I also think that this recipe would still be great without the shrimp, but I will use it if I have some in the freezer. Next time I might also add black olives with the zucchini, as some other reviewers suggested. The white cooking wine really made this an especially good meal.

Dee-lish!  We doubled the shrimp (and therefore doubled the basil) and used 8 oz. feta.  Had to had a little olive oil to the leftovers (a little dry, probably from doubling the shrimp!).

I am not a cook at all.  But I LOVED this recipe!  I love shrimp, I love feta cheese and I love pasta.  I used angel hair instead and next time I'll probably add black olives.  I do agree that it could use more sauce.  Next time, I'll try that too!!

I have made this again and again for my husband.  I almost always have shrimp in the freezer I can defrost, so all I have to pickup from the store are tomatoes and feta.  I ususally don't use wine in my cooking much, but it certainly makes it a restaurant-style dish.

I did my best to spice this up since I read a couple of reviews that said it seemed bland. I added spices, additional garlic, more feta cheese, lemon juice, chopped Pasilla chiles and Tabasco to the recipe. I clearly underestimated the amount of bland it was because the cooked dish was still too bland for my son and me. He said unenthusiastcally that it was okay. But I could tell by his additions of ketchup and pepper that he didn’t like it that much. Leftovers got tossed even in our usual no-food-waste home.

Very simple yet elegant recipe. I used only 1/2 lb pasta because I was concerned there wouldn't be enough sauce to flavour the noodles otherwise. I also used garlic infused oil instead of garlic cloves. Next time I'll try adding some garlic cloves, as called for in the recipe. Very nice!

I loved this dish but I could only give it 4 stars because I made some moderations. First of all, I had the app change the recipe from 5 to 2 servings. I used more shrimp, garlic, oregano, basil, and feta than called for. I also used basil garlic and oregano diced tomatoes and used more than what would have been equivalent to the amount of fresh tomato the recipe called for, which also added more tomato juice since they were canned tomatoes. I also added red pepper flakes when cooking the shrimp. After everything was done I tried it and it was in need of salt and pepper, once I added a good amount, the pasta was delicious!

I think it's an awesome recipe! I read the reviews and made adjustments.. Adding more wine, 3 Roma tomatoes, a little cream and less pasta.. It was amazing! Definitely gourmet!!

I used this recipe as a guideline but I added a bunch of stuff. I used vegetable spaghetti noodles instead of linguini. I grilled diced, red onions and garlic with chives until the onion was translucent before adding the tomato. I eye-balled the herbs and probably used more then what was called for. I also added a dash of sea salt and red pepper flakes with a generous portion of grated Romano Cheese sprinkled on top. I used diced, canned tomatoes because I didn't have fresh tomatoes and I think it worked. I added about a tablespoon of olive oil to the pasta before adding the shrimp and tomato mixture. Next time I think I want to add mushrooms. It was a big win in my house! Delicious!!

My whole family (including kids 8, 5 and 3) all loved this.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding a can of artichokes.   It could probably have used either more shrimp/tomatoes or less pasta but it was good as is.

I've been making this for years, where I learned it from a Greek restaurant I worked at.  The difference is that I carmelize 1 med. thin sliced onion first in olive oil, add 4 large peeled, chopped tomatoes, big splash of wine, 4-5 cloves of minced garlic - let it cook down a bit, add 1 1/2 lbs. peeled & deveined shrimp and then 6 to 8 oz. crumbled feta.  Toss noodles into the sauce.  Top with a sprinkling of feta. Simple to make and awesome to  eat.

This is an easy and yummy recipe.  I added a 1/2 cup of pasta water to the pasta and shrimp mixture that was suggested in other reviews but honestly I think it would have been just as good without. The key to this recipe is too use two large garlic gloves and a very juicy lemon.  If your lemon isn't juicy, use two.  I got a full 1/4 cup from my lemon. Also, I did sprinkle some cayenne pepper on the top for an extra kick.  It was perfect.  I used gluten free pasta and because there was so much flavor in this recipe, we didn't miss the real pasta flavor. I have made this dish several times.  This time I put in about 1/2 cup of fresh cooked peas because I had them from a farmers market and needed to get rid of them.  Delicious!

This was delicious! My husband and I cook together and we made  this recipe  this evening.  We followed other reviewers recommendations we added more fresh tomatoes, salt and pepper and just a touch of cream.  Of course we also added more white wine and drank a glass with our meal.    For colour we also added green peppers into the tomato sauce.  We are happy cooks and even happier diners this evening.

Something new to do with shrimp - also very flexible. Four stars because as written there is not enough sauce to go over pasta and it lacks a bit of flavor - I added chopped olives and capers and a bit of salt along with more wine and a bit of chicken stock. Because I wanted to get a few extra veggies into my family, I added about a cup of shredded power greens (baby spinach and kale mix) at the very end, just cooked for a moment til they wilted. Also used far less feta cheese , just an ounce or so per person for the sake of calories. Maybe thats why I found it a little more bland?

My boyfriend and I made this dish for dinner. It was very easy and quick to make! I added more wine to the shrimp to give it a more intense aroma. It was a delicious and very light meal which goes perfectly with white wine and good music. :)

Delicious and easy! Just made sure to use a little over 1/2cup of white wine and double the rest of the Ingredients besides pasta. I also cut down the amount of pasta used to ensure it wasn't dry.

Easy. Delicious. We followed others' advice and used 2 cans diced tomatoes, 12 ounces pasta, and a splash of half and half at the end. It made enough for 7 adult servings and one child. This will go into our regular rotation!

This was a smash hit in my house! Like other reviewers, I added more wine, using about 3/4 of a cup. I first used 1/2 cup and then later added more wine, olive oil, and garlic to make more sauce. It just didn't look like there was going to be enough to me. Glad I did! Otherwise, it was fabulous. Good flavor. Can't wait to have leftovers tonight! I've already been asked to save this recipe and make again.

I like this recipe as well. I have also done it with orzo instead of linguini, and tomatoes sautéed up with the shrimp. I then throw it in the oven covered with feta and let it bake for a few minutes.

Extremely good! I used fresh basil as that's what I had and Marsala wine instead of white.  Also increased the wine as per personal taste.
Penne instead of linguini, also.  Added red pepper and crimini mushrooms to increase veggies.
Excellent taste and it was definitely restaurant quality.  Thanks for sharing.

Have made this a couple times now and everyone has loved it each time. Hubby and I go shrimping every year, our freezer is usually over-stocked with shrimp, I'm always trying to find new and tasty recipes to use them in. This one is definitely a keeper!

This is definitely a regular in my household. The only thing I did different was I added about 5oz frozen spinach (thawed) when cooking the tomatoes. I also used extra small shrimp so that you have a shrimp in every bite!

This is awesome!!  We use fresh tomatoes, diced instead of canned.  But we have tried this basic recipe on shrimp, bay scallops, and cubed chicken.  Just great light, fresh flavor. Super quick to throw together.  This is one of those recipes that just beg for extra fresh garden produce to be added.  Wow, Thanks~

Are you sure you aren't a professional chef? This is awesome!  I had to cut the tomato in half since my husband doesn't like them, but even though he complained that tomatoes were in the recipe, there were no complaints once it was on a plate.  I'm a big fan of Feta cheese.  It was great in this recipe.  Kudos.

Simple recipe that makes a nice alternative to pasta with red sauce.  My husband had it for lunch the next day and said it was just as good. I did go a bit lighter on the garlic.

This was very fast to throw together and had good flavor.  I did like the feta with the shrimp.  To save even more time, I used a drained can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh.

This was a lovely meal and I got three meals for myself out of it.  I changed it slightly:  one cup of white wine, 5 peeled roma tomatoes, 5 cloves of garlic, two handfuls of spinach, fresh basil, 4 large mushrooms, and half a yellow pepper.  This made enough sauce for half the amount of pasta.  I needed this to be gluten & cow dairy free so I used rice noodles and goat feta.

I tried the recipe as written. It was not bad, but I felt like something was missing. I will try it again and maybe add some pesto or sun-dried tomatoes.

as others I increased the wine and used Italian seasoning.  You can also use any pasta you have on hand. I didn't really care for the feta cheese in this which is why I rated 3 stars.

This recipe was delicious! Super easy and quick. I used ditalini pasta instead of linguine because that's what I had on hand. I also made it with frozen shrimp and canned diced tomatoes. Whether it changed the taste from the original, I'm not sure. Either way, it was very good. I will definitely make this again and share it with others. Thanks for sharing it with us!

I have made this twice now and plan to make it many more times. The first time I made this a couple weeks ago, my children, who say they don't like shrimp, even cleaned their plates. I used a can of diced tomatoes since I was out of fresh tomatoes and substituted a Knorr concentrated chicken broth tub and a little water for the white wine (I don't like wine). 
I made this again last night using fresh tomatoes and still using the chicken broth tub but also adding spinach, as some of others suggested. My husband said it was the best shrimp dish he has ever had. The fresh tomatoes made all the difference and the spinach was just an added bonus. Thank you

This is outstanding.  a few simple flavors that blend so well together in a VERY uncomplicated dish.  This is the type of dish where you don't have to worry to much about measurements and whatnot...more about cooking by feel.  My favorite kind!  Delish--we served over whole wheat spaghetti.

I did add more of everything as other users suggested, however, I did make a few additions. I added in snow peas with the tomatoes (which was very yummy) and added garlic salt to the pasta before serving it. Overall, Very good! Will make again!

This is so quick but tastes devine! The only thing I do differently is use lemon infused oil to saute the shrimp, it gives it a little extra kick. I also like to add some fresh spinach to this to give it a veggie and colour boost.

I'd give this 5 stars except the other reviewers are right - there's not enough liquid and I pretty much had to double it. Otherwise the taste was fabulous. I also made this with freshly grated parmesan once as I didn't have feta - equally good!

Good base recipe.  I just didn't think there was enough of a "sauce", in fact, I thought the pasta was rather dry.  If I did this again I would add more white wine and maybe add some butter in the end for a smooth sauce.  Thanks for sharing.

Sooo good. Used lemon juice instead of wine, tomato paste instead of chopped, and didn't add oregano. Very easy to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand. Will make this one again and again!

I have made this recipe several times with both fresh and canned tomatoes.  It is wonderful either way, fresh spinich linguini adds extra color and a wonderful flavor to the overall dish. My daughter loves all seafood but her eyes really light up when I say shrimp feta pasta.

This was a good basic place to start.  I used chicken, although I would also try shrimp in the future.  I marinated the chicken in Caesar dressing.  I used 1 tsp. dried basil, 8 oz. feta, and also sauteed an onion, a summer squash, and some sun-dried tomatoes, then added that as well as some sliced green olives and fresh pepper.  Delicious!

This recipe rocked my socks. The only thing I did differently was to use about 3tsp. chicken bouillon instead of white wine. I did not thaw shrimp ahead and the bouillon mixes well with the water from the shrimp to make the tomato sauce. I also used canned tomatoes and let the tomato sauce simmer for about 15 minutes to let it thicken a bit. SO delicious and my whole family liked it, even my 4yr. old. Mmmmmmm....

I used cherry tomatoes, reduced fat Feta, whole wheat noodles and added Asparagus. It's a great, lite recipe that even my meat & potatoe loving boyfriend got second servings of. Excited to make again.

This might be a good base, but it definitely needs some tweaking. I will make it again, but next time I will do 1/4 cup of wine, 2 TBSP of lemon juice and maybe add some green peppers.

Loved the dish.  My husband doesn't like shrimp, but he ate it up.  I used frozen shrimp, added green onions, and peppers.  It turned out wonderful.  One could add more white wine if more sauce is desired.  I will make it again.

Delicious! I just realized that I forgot to add the basil and oregano... oops... but it was still good without it! As per most of the recommendations I added about 1/2 c chicken broth so there would be more sauce. I used a bit less pasta then called for and still thought there could be a bit more sauce. Will have to play around with the amount of liquid to get it right.. but it is really good!!

This was just a delicious recipe - and since I had most of  the ingredients on hand, it was a great shrimp recipe to try. I did use fresh oregano for the dried and penne pasta for the linguini, but other than those two modifications, I followed the recipe. It is a definite make again, and a company good fast meal.

AMAZING!!!  I made this dish with no pasta.  I made some couscous for a side dish.  Also, the only other change I made was to add a small box of sliced fresh mushrooms.  It is now a family favorite!

Restaurant Quality! Very impressive!   I used angel hair pasta and added another tomato or two when I saw there wasn't enough tomato "sauce" for my taste. I also didn't have any white wine so I made it without, and it was still wonderful.

I added more white wine, garlic, and feta cheese.  You do not need but about 2/3 lb. pasta.  With these adjustments, it was great.

Overall very good but lacked depth.  Added 6 oz. fresh spinach to main recipe and topped with fresh chopped chives.  This added color and nutrition.

great, easy recipe. I did make a few changes after reading other reviews: used bow-tie pasta, coated the shrimp in salt, pepper, and garlic salt. I used butter instead of olive oil. Sauteed garlic, onion, and red pepper flakes with the shrimp until pink. Increased the white wine to about 1 1/4 cups. Used half for cooking the shrimp and than half when making the sauce. Used roma tomatoes that I seeded. Added about a tablespoon of milk and flour to the sauce to thicken and a tablespoon of butter along with some fresh parmesan cheese. Tossed some steamed fresh broccoli with the pasta, sauce, and feta cheese. turned out great!!!

I followed the directions to a T on this one and it came out amazing, restaurant quality and delicious!  I might add some capers next time I make it to add a little something extra, but honestly it doesn't need it, this is definitely a keeper in my recipe box.

I made this for the first time while on vacation with a large group of people, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Needless to say, the meal got rave reviews!  Everyone needed a copy of the recipe at the edd of the week. The only changes I made were to add small amout of butter just before tossing everything together to firm up the juices.

The only changes that I made to this recipe were to cut down on the garlic and use spaghetti noodles (because I didn't have the others). I really enjoyed eating it but my three teenagers didn't. My husband thought it was OK.  I have therefore had a serving of it for either breakfast, lunch, or dinner every day for the last five days.  I still think it is a great recipe.  What do kids know anyway.

My family doesn't eat tomatoes so I omitted them from mine when I cooked this and everyone loved it.  This will be cooked many more time in my house I can assure you.  It was so good, we thing we would even just eat the noodles cooked with the sauce sometimes.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Well the husband is usually the final grade when it comes to meals. It seemed like it would be too flat with just the ingredients it called for so I added a Greek olive medley mushrooms and green onion to it. It still seems to be lacking the big wow but I can't put my finger on what that would be. I liked the recipe for the most part it was a nice light late night meal. I'll have to think about what would give it that wow factor and try it again. Thanks for shareing

This was okay nothing too special about it. I think it would be very good with spinach added into it and some red pepper flakes. I might or might not make it again, thanks for the recipe.

pretty  good - I used canned tomatoes since that was all I had and I didn't really like the tomato part - I'll try w/ fresh tomatoes.

Just made tonight and everyone really enjoyed it. I, like many others, added olives and increased my wine and olive oil amounts. This is a simple, yet delicious dish.

This recipe was sooooooo good!  I can't wait to serve it again.  The Feta Cheese really gives the pasta a good flavor.  The next time I make it I might add some black olives.

This recipe has potential but, as is, it is very bland.  I will try again using others' suggestions regarding red pepper, and increasing the wine and other spices.

Very good....very similar to dishes that I've thrown together over the years, as well. I did a full box of angel hair, fresh basil and almost 3/4 cup wine....added pepper flakes. One HUGE mistake....I used lowfat feta which I know now has no flavor compared to the regular feta. Very versatile dish....everyone liked it!

I made this for my family last night and it was delish!  We all loved it, except for my son whose not a seafood fan.  I added 1/2 lb. baby scallops and only used 8 oz. pasta.  I used 1 cup of wine, about 1/4 cup half n' half added at the last minute and I topped with fresh basil. Served with salad & Bruschetta I recipe on french bread rounds.  Yummy!  Will make this again.

It  had great taste and is an excellent recipe. I like the fact,I had all the ingredients on hand,as I always keep feta cheese and frozen shrimp on hand.I had fresh cherry tomatoes from my garden. I did add 1/2 teasp of red pepper flakes & 1cup of wine and used 1/2 pkg of linquine, so it was  perfect -we added  grated fresh parmansan on top--my  husband had 3rds --I will be making again and thanks for sharing your recipe!

I increased the wine to 1/4 c.--adding 2T with the shrimp and 2T more with the tomatoes. I also only used 2T olive oil--I didn't add anymore to the tomatoes. It was delicious!

I made this tonight with some modifications. I don't eat shrimp so I crumbled some tilapia, and I didn't have tomatoes on hand and I used angel hair pasta. But with the changes it came out great, the seasoning was so tasty. I was making this for me so I didn't use quite as much fish or pasta, but when I make it again I will use the full amount and definitely use tomatoes, as it will add some juiciness. I might use spinach as well. Thanks for the recipe, will be a go to recipe for me from now on!

I made this a few weeks ago and it was excellent! Next time I will definitely use frozen shrimp instead of precooked. Like others here, I increased things like white wine and olive oil. Definitely made it better for me. Also beware of putting too much feta. The recipe's amount definitely isn't too much. I'm new to this though, and at first I almost had the right amount, and then accidentally put way too much. Too much feta will ruin it ha ha. Before my mistake it tasted great. My blunder aside I totally enjoyed this dish!

This had a nice taste, but was a little dry.  Part of the problem is because we can't use tomatoes (the hubby is allergic to them) but we drizzled a good bit of Olive Oil to try and help compensate.  Still needs a small kick, but overall the taste of the shrimp and using the feta cheese was wonderful tasting!

i used chicken instead of shrimp and it came out fantastic!! I suggest adding some veggies like julienned green peppers, red peppers, and some onions when you're simmering the tomatoes! Definitely a favorite!

this was very good. lots of good flavor. I did have to use 1 can of diced tomatoes ( 1 tomato I had on hand was bad)and I added a chopped tomato that I had cooked in a little olive oil to that along with some dried basil & oregano. I used fresh linguine pasta. Will certainly make again.

This turned out very good.  I did change a few things.  I cooked fresh onions and mushrooms in olive oil and added that to a can of diced tomatoes with the juice.  I increased the wine to 3/4 cups.  This was served over the linguine.  It could have used more sauce.  Next time I'll use more wine and tomatoes.

This recipe tasted delicious, so I am glad I took the advice of other people on here. Otherwise, it definitely would have been too dry. I used half a pound of linguini and the amount shown for everything else except I kept pouring in white wine until I thought it made enough sauce. I probably used 2 cups or so, maybe more. I used two tomatoes and still thought I could have thrown in one more. I used a whole pound of shrimp, but for only a half pound of linguini, I probably could have used a little less. I threw in some of my own spices and added a bit more garlic than shown in the recipe. It was a taste explosion, which is how I like it! Thanks for the recipe, loved it!

I absolutely loved the simple but yummy tastes of this recipe.  I've always been pretty true to the recipe, but sometimes have added some sauteed mushrooms and onions or even some sun-dried tomatos.  I used fat free feta and whole wheat pasta to make it more healthy (Weight Watchers Core) and love it.

This was very good.  I used a little more olive oil and added about 1 Tbs of butter to saute the garlic.  Also increased the white wine to about 1/4 cup. It does need some salt.  Had very little left over!  Thank you the recipe.

I made this for supper last night and I just made a few simple changes,I used grape tomatoes and two cans of diced and pepper jack cheese. It was good but to be honest,the other recipe called 'Happy Shrimp' seems like a better dish.

I really liked it!! Since i didn't have any white wine, and didn't have a chance to buy it, i just used grape juice, some apple cider vinegar, and some lemon juice. I don't know if I got the same taste, but it turned out to be very good. I probably added 1/2 cup of grape juice, 2 teaspoons of vinegar, and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.  I think because i didn't have any wine, my shrimp wasn't cooked through very well, so I suggest to cook it for about 15+ minutes.  Over all this recipe was great. I loved the meal!

was skeptical at first about the feta, but this was fabulous and so easy to prepare.  I added crushed red pepper to the garlic to give it a little zing.  Thanks again.

OMG this recipe was really really good.  I did make some changes tho!  I used alot more wine than even all the other reviews said...about half a bottle in total.  I used 1/2 cup to cook the shrimp in and then after I added more.  I used a big can of seasoned diced tomatoes because it was much easier.  I didnt drain them. This yielded much more sauce and was better, I added a little milk to thicken since I didnt have cream or half and half, will use next time.  I aslo added spinach while the sauce was cooking.  I suggest using the 70 count shrimp they cook faster and you get more.  The feta is sooo good in the dish, I went with seasoned feta btw.  Angel hair pasta and some cheesy garlic bread made this dinner very nice for two and I will be making again!

Not a whole lot of taste with this one. All the spices need to be increased. Add some red pepper flakes and definitely increase the wine to 1/2 cup. Everyone ate it and had no complaints but I don't think I would make it again. Since tomatoes are out of season I went for the canned roasted ones instead.

I really thought this recipe would be good because I love shrimp and feta cheese.  However, it was truly disappointing.  The feta cheese simply was not good in this pasta recipe.  No else in my family liked it either.

I give this recipe 4 1/2 stars.  The only thing I did differently was use canned diced tomatoes.  It needed just a little more flavor to me, but it was good.

Wow! This is good stuff!

Here's what I did:
-up the wine to 1/2 cup.
-chopped up 5 roma tomatoes total. You could EASILY add more.
-added a couple dashes of crushed red pepper.
-after cooking the prawns and removing them I didn't bother adding more olive oil to finishe the sauce. With the extra wine added it's really not needed.
-I used 4oz of feta instead of 6. It's PLENTY, and I would assume just as tasty.

This was very, very good.  I sub'd 1/2 cup of chicken broth for the wine and it was still really good.  Quick and easy and a great use of our fresh tomatoes.

We had this tonight, and it was pretty good.  I didn't cook it, so I'm not sure about everything I might change when I make it.  My husband fixed it, and he follows recipes EXACTLY.  I did like the pasta and feta more without the shrimp, but I would have liked more feta and probably a little more ... zip.  I think it needed more wine and a little more in the seasoning department.  Some other things to give it more texture and flavor - pine nuts or peas or water chestnuts, etc.

Overall, though, for a fast, simple pasta recipe, this was decent.

This was really quick and easy with good flavour.  I used another reviewers suggestion and used 1/2 cup white wine.  I didn't have two tomatoes so I used some yellow peppers that I had in the fridge.  Next time I will use more feta, that is just a personal preference.

Based on some of the other reviewers, I increased the amounts of everything (except the pasta and feta) by a half.  The wine I increased a little more.  I also added some corn to the mix at the end.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Very good - but have to make adjustments. I added closer to 1/2 cup white wine, a little extra olive oil and and extra tomoatoes to give it more moisture. Tasted very fresh - and is very easy to make.

I was afraid of having too little sauce from what others were saying about this recipe.  I halved the amount of pasta and added 4 tablespoons of wine.  All the juice from the fresh tomatoes watered down some of the flavor so I added a bouillon cube.  I also had some extra spinach so I tossed that in for extra color.  I wish I had added more feta though.

My hubby lives blue cheese so made it with that instead of feta and it came out wonderful. The sauce was a little thin so I added a can of tomato paste and it came out perfect! It was also great reheated, and that is hard to do with shrimp.

Everyone loved this recipe.  I used a lot more wine than called for and I sauted the garlic a bit in the olive oil before adding wine.  I used a ton of fresh tomatoes from the garden. I have made it 3 or 4 times now.  A big hit!!!

This was great!  It made the whole house smell delicous!  
Like other reviewers, I added extra wine in place of the olive oil (only used about 1 tbsp oo total.)  I don't like tomatoes, so I threw in some portobello mushrooms with the shrimp.  
Thanks for the recipe! :)

Good recipe, I'd give 3.5 stars. I modified a bit though. I used apple juice for the wine, added spinach and a can of diced tomatoes. Everyone liked it including my 5 yr old who went back for seconds! I'll make this again but with the wine next time.

Really, really good!  I used angel hair pasta and chicken broth b/c I didn't have wine.  Added pepper - we like lots of pepper!  Excellent and easy to prepare - the feta MAKES this dish!!!

I added 3/4 cup white wine & 1 cup half & half to the recipe . Cooked the wine down to half & then added the half & half & cooked it down as well. Added some cornstarch & water. It turned out very yummy. Will make again.

I read so many good reviews about this dish that I had to try it, but my husband is allergic to shellfish.  I followed the recipe with the suggestions of using 1/2 cup white wine and cutting back on the olive oil.  I used Italian seasoned chicken instead of the shrimp, added a dash of red pepper flakes and some parmesan on the top (we are both cheese lovers), and it was great.  My husband loved it, and it made great leftovers for lunch the next day.

This recipe was great!  I omitted the white wine and tossed in a handful of shredded cheddar cheese while cooking the sauce and it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

The flavor was good and it was extremely quick and easy. I felt it was too dry, though. I will double the 'sauce' next time.

I agree with many of the other users, it's a good base to start a good recipe.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh and used the garlic and herb feta cheese.  The dish tasted fine, but was a little dry for my taste.  Next time I make it, I will either double the sauce mixture or use less pasta.

This is a good start to a greta recipe.  Not a lot of flavor.  I would double the garlic and the feta for more flavor!  Also, use a can of diced tomatoes and you can lose one tablespoon of oil.

Used a leftover shrimp ring, not used at a party we hosted.  Very easy to make. My husband and 12 month old loved it - my husband said it was one of my better meals and wants it again!  Tasted great the next day for lunch.  Only change was using 2 cans of diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano.

Pretty good, but a bit too cheesy for my families taste, next time i'll cut some of the cheese out, and add some more tomato. The Tomato's were awesome, but there weren't enough!

Great recipe.  I added 1/2-1 tsp of crushed red pepper to add a little kick.  A can of diced tomatoes was an easy substitute for the fresh tomatoes.

This is a great recipe. My husband only likes shrimp in a few dishes, but he loves this one. It's even better with fresh basil and oregano. We serve it will garlic bread and a full glass of white wine. Perfect for special occasions.

Wow, this was great!  And sooo easy.  I added a third tomato, and added a little more wine after removing the shrimp.  I also used fresh basil and added it near the end of cooking the tomatoes.

This is very similar to a recipe I was given years ago, then called Adriatica Prawns Skiathos. There are differences in amounts of olive oil, garlic, shrimp, white wine, and feta (but they aren't that big), plus fresh lemon or lime juice. But I can't imagine this dish without fresh basil and a small amount of fresh chiles. I just didn't like this recipe as much as our regular one - the one my husband requests once he's aware there are prawns (fresh OR frozen) on the premises.

Very Good, fast, simple,very easy. The only thing I added were hot pepper flakes and fresh basil and the dish turned out very well and did taste like resturant quality food. A loaf of crusty bread really hit's the spot with this dish.

I will definitely be making this one again.  It was fast and easy and the whole family loved the taste.  I did use canned diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomatoes.  I tossed in some black olives and some capers too, with the feta.  My husband did say that, while tasty, it lacked sauce.  It was wet and all but he was looking for something visibly covering the pasta.  (sigh)  He also likes a little lettuce to go with salad dressing when it comes to salad so he just seems to need *sauce*.  I'll try to add a can of tomato sauce next time.

My husband really liked this but I thought it was just OK. I probably won't make it again. It was easy, though, and good for those who love feta cheese.
