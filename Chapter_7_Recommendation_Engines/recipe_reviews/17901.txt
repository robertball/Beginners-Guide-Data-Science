Pretty decent cake, but as white and yellow butter cakes are notoriously a little drier, I think for my own personal preference I would add a couple of extra yolks to the batter in the future. Experience has shown me this really helps. For those who remark this tastes like or has the texture of corn bread, perhaps you're not beating your butter and sugar long enough? You really have to beat it for a good 2-3 minutes to aerate it, which definitely makes all the difference in terms of texture. I made these into cupcakes, and added 1 tsp. of grated lemon zest to the batter.  Frosted with Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting, also from this site.

I made this into a 9x13 sheet cake and cooked this for 30 minutes. It turned out golden and moist. I found an easy and quick yellow cake. Excellent with chocolate frosting.

I didn't have any butter so I used shortning and added a little butter flavor to it. It was fantastic! This is one of the lightest cakes I have ever made and as a semi-professional baker that says a lot. This one is getting filed. For those who had a problem with dryness. Never sccop out the flour, spoon it into the measuring cup and level it. Too much flour = dry cake. Also beat the butter sugar till it's really well creamed together and add eggs one at a time beating to death after each one. Good luck.

Flavor is very good-better than boxed cake mix on flavor. However, the cake was also very dry. I do think I overbaked it some, but, I don't think the was the entire reason for the dryness. The cake is quite dense as well. In my opinion, while the flavor is good, I willmore than likely use the box next time or maybe add pudding or egg yolk to the mixture? Not sure. I was just bummed b/c i tried to follow the advice of another reviewer and ensure that I creamed my butter and sugar well, yet, I had a really dry cake. Oh well. I did pair it with the sour cream chocolate cake frosting on this site - which is very chocolatey!

This cake was very easy to make. I was very pleased how it turned out- until I tasted it....it tasted like cornbread. This is the first time one of my cakes has turned out tasting bad. I was very dissappointed- will not try this one again

This is a very moist and flavorful cake. Would work well with any type of frosting--perfect birthday cake basic. The only problem I had was with the amount of batter. The recipe states there is enough batter for six 9 inch round pans so I cut the recipe in half hoping to make a 3 layer cake. The halfed recipe barely made enough batter to make 2 skimpy 9 inch rounds. However the cake is so tasty I can't complain. My son could hardly wait until it was frosted.

So many complaints about this cake being dry....possibly because the layers are too thin.  I always makes this particular recipe in a  9 x 13 pan  - no problem.  Also, it is better if the eggs are separated, i.e. beat in yoks and whip whites until soft peaks form and fold in at the very end.   Good luck.     P.S. Use this recipe not only for frosting cakes but also as a base for strawberies or fruit of your choice.

I have been using this for years glad to see it shared here. I actually cream the butter and sugar for 5 min to get a really good cake.

This cake was quite simple to make, tasted good.  It was a little harder than the usual cake, but still good.  It holds up to layering very well.  I made it with a lightly sweetened whipped cream topping/filling and it was delicious.  I also made one version with sliced fresh strawberries between layers with whipped cream, delicious!  I'll probably try cake flour next time to see if it will lighten up the cake, but even if it doesn't I'll still make it again since it tastes good.

The flavor and texture remind me of my grandmother's old world cakes. By far the best yellow cake recipe I've found!

Creaming the butter and sugar for long enough is the whole secret to this recipe.  My daughter made it this week, and just left the mixer running while she did some other things.  The cake came out SO moist and delicious, not a bit like cornbread.  Very flavorful!  I don't usually like cake without frosting, but this one was yummy enough it didn't need it!

This cake tasted a little to floury to me. I would have liked it to be a bit lighter as well. I used a 9x13 pan and that worked well. Baked for about 30 min and frosted with chocolate. Not bad for a sweet tooth craving, but I will still look for another basic cake recipe.
