It tasted fine, but be aware that the “sauce” has no flavor as is.  It’s just a bit of butter with Parmesan.  You might want to add something else as a flavoring, (e.g. soy sauce, teriyaki, etc) or add more: garlic, Parmesan, basil.  Maybe some oregano.  Even some beef broth would add some flavor.

I added 100ml of cream to thicken it before adding the pasta.
Added salt and pepper for seasoning. 
I then added the juice of a lime (just before serving) to give it some acidity. 
Absolutely delicious.

It's about as easy as it gets, and it may not be super gourmet but it is good comfort food.

Followed the basic recipe but I added a few shredded carrots for color, some pea pods, white turnip and broccoli since I had them fresh from the garden.  Some of the family wanted red sauce for the pasta so I added that as a side dish.  They loved it.
