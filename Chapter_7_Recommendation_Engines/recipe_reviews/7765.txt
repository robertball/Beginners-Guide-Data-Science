Yummy!  I made this with oreo cookies because I didn't feel like hunting down the toffee bars and skipped the almonds because I topped it with the crushed cookies.  This is so yummy!  I almost tried butterfinger bars but chickened out.  Don't know why, I think it would be hard to make this taste bad.

Very good when made with brownie mixes instead of cake mixes too. I made it for a BBQ and it was devoured even before the meal!

Wow, this is sinfully good! I did a little scaling as the recipe makes a huge amount and I wanted to use my trifle bowl. I used 3 of the smaller boxes of pudding mix with 6 cups of milk. Instead of the frozen topping I made real whipped cream, using a pint of heavy cream and just a little sugar. I used only a little over half of the cake and could have done with a little less pudding too. The recipe does say to use a large punch bowl....their not kidding!

I make this often for large get togethers and everyone loves it! I use Kahlua flavored syrup in the chocolate cake after it is baked and crumbled. I also skip the candy bars & almonds. I wipe the inside of the bowl with a paper towel after each layer to give a cleaner look.

Another keeper. Serves a big crowd. 6 adults & 4 kids hardly put a dent in it! Easy to make - add your own favorites. I thought I was in trouble when I saw that I had purchased INSTANT pudding by mistake, but it turned out great!  Such an attractive dish!

This is pretty well my Death by Chocolate recipe except I use Kahlua instead of coffee liqueur and Skor chocolate bars.  I also add zest of one orange to pudding, add a layer of canned mandarine orange & top with mandarines.  It's yummy!

Excellent recipe for a get-together.  I brought this dessert to a party last week; it was only on the table a minute when someone shouted out "who brought the 'bowl of sin'?!?"  What higher recommendation could there possibly be?

Outstanding! The compliments I got on this when I brought it to a Christmas Eve function only confirmed what I already knew from trying it myself: this IS the ULTIMATE dessert! I cut cake up into chunks and drizzled coffee liqueur and Godiva chocolate liqueur over them as I layered. I also used real whipped cream, sweetened with just a little confectioners sugar and vanilla extract. To add a little color, I drizzled a bit of strawberry dessert topping on top of the whipped cream layers. I did NOT leave the leftovers at the hostess's house, but it followed me everywhere until it was gone, the day after Christmas!

Had this at a friends house.  Loved it.  I didn't know the exact measurments.  This is perfect every time.  Everybody loves it.  You can't go wrong with this one.  So easy.  Even if you don't have a nice glass bowl.

Loved this recipe! I used ready made chocolate pudding cups, in order to save time. I also crumbled some peanut butter cups for each layer. I also used the recipe 'Too Much Chocolate Cake' that is also featured in this website. It tastes better the next day, refrigerated. Will make again!
