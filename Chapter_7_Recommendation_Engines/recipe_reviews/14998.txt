BEWARE!!! There is no salt in this recipe. If you use unsalted butter (as I always do), the cookie comes out really bland. Big flaw in the recipe, so I couldn't rate it higher. Otherwise it turned out fine.

In order to make these a bit "healthy" as the description says, I used olive oil in place of butter and wheat flour instead of white. Also used some nutmeg. Definitally good cookies, I managed to get my husband to clean the kitchen by promising to make them again. They're in the oven now. ^_-

These are perfect cookies. I turn them into health snacks that the kids will even eat for breakfast. I substitute whole wheat flour and about 1/2 cup of flax meal for the all-purpose flour, and mix in whatever nuts and raisins I have. They're not too sweet and just the right texture. Doubling the recipe just fills my Kitchen Aid. I bake about 25 cookies, then roll the rest into logs and freeze. Then we have home-made cook
ies anytime we want them.

These are the absolute best oatmeal cookies I've made in my life.  It's got to be the honey!  :)  I didn't have raisins, but I put roughly 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips in, and about 1/2 cup of craisins in-- my god, they're fabulous.  They are the softest, moistest oatmeal cookies I've ever had-- highly recommended.

This is an awesome recipe.  The cookies
were a hit with my great grandchildren.
It is one of the best cookies I have
baked over the last 40 years. It is easy enough that my great grand
daughter age (7) helped make it.

the trick to these cookies is to not overbake them! they are so moist chewy and delicious. I used Sun Maid baking raisins...no soaking or boiling necessary.

These cookies taste delicious.  But after a few days of eating them, my husand and I both realized that they were upsetting our stomachs because of the dry oats (minimal moisture in the recipe).  I will not make them again for this reason.

I added 1/2-3/4 cup coconut and made as directed. These are wonderful! Crunchy on the outside, chewy inside as others commented.

Very good oatmeal cookie. I added a shake of salt and used salted butter. Used KAF white whole wheat for half the flour and traditional oats which I think gives a bit more texture than quick oats. Soaked raisins. Moist, chewy, flavorful.

Made this recipe 3 times in 3 weeks, 4th time this weekend.  It's SO tasty and healthy.  Husband, who doesn't like oatmeal, loved them, and I tried them on 2 girls at work, one asked the next day if I had brought in any more of those cookies!  This time I'm trying it with the whole wheat flour and ground flaxseed.  Husband's blood pressure has gone down since I started making them, we are so pleased.  THANK YOU for the recipe, it's a keeper!

I was actually a little apprehensive about how EASY it was to mix with just a tablespoon, after the butter/sugar/eggs/vanilla were creamed. (I thought they wouldn't hold together and spread all over the pan!) You should absolutely soften the butter first for best results. I soaked the raisins before adding them, and actually totally forgot about the salt, as I was using unsalted butter. Regardless, these cookies are phenomenal. If I remember next time, I'll probably add some, but I'm so glad I spent like 30 minutes reading reviews of recipes before deciding to make this one. Fantastically chewy, delicious oatmeal raisin cookie. This is a keeper!

This is the 4th time I've made this recipe and when I make cookies, it is usually just chocolate chip cookies! But a good friend requested oatmeal raisin cookies and thankfully I decided on THIS recipe. The ONLY thing I do differently is add walnuts. These stay moist and chewy even in high altitude

Amazing! My husband insists I make these every two weeks from now on. I did add about 1/2 c. coconut, and next time, I'm going to make a side batch with no raisins, but chocolate chips added, for my picky daughter. Thank you, Kathleen!

This was a very delicious cookie!  I was looking for a healthier cookie so I did make some modifications.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 1/4 cup and used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour.  I think next time I will use even less sugar (3/4 cup) and substitute half of the butter for applesauce.

Yummy! I followed the recipe but added a little salt (1/2 tsp). All I had were quick oats and they worked fine.

I was craving oatmeal raisin cookies and decided on this recipe. I am so happy!  This is the first time I have ever made cookies from scratch and they came out PERFECT.  10 minutes in the oven and they had a lightly chewie dark golden brown edge and a nice softly chewie middle. Just the right amount of sweetness and spice, loved it! My neighbors tried them and now they want the recipe :)

These were pretty good, easy to make, and relatively healthy. I made them to the exact recipe. I believe that next time I will add nutmeg and additional raisins.

I just made these cookies and they are absolutely fantastic!! I would have followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't have any honey on hand. Instead of using honey, I used agave sweetener. I also soaked the raisins in water overnight. This made the rasins plump and juicy!! I will definately make these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!! 8)

This is a great cookie recipe.  I consider myself a true oatmeal raisin cookie connoisseur and these are awesome.  If you like maple, try substituting real maple syrup for the honey.

This recipe got good reviews so I decided to try it. Needless to say, I do not know if I did something wrong, but I thought it was awful, the cookies were very flat and hard to get off the cookie sheet. I tried leaving them in oven a little longer and that did not help either no matter what I did its like they were just not working. I scaled the recipe for 60 because I wanted to make them for a fund raiser. Well I tossed them and started over with a classic oatmeal raisin. I also did not think they were very flavorful at all.

Hands down, the best oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I have ever made.  Moist and sweet = delicious.  Both my kids inhaled these.  I could not keep up with the demand.  I do not know what made them so perfect, but, they are, and that is all that matters.

I do think that portraying these as healthy cookies though is quite deceiving.  A cup of butter is not health food.  But, I would not have it any other way.  A cookie is intended to be a treat!

An easy recipe to follow even for a beginner like me!

The outcome was delicious; chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside: precisely the cookie type I like the best.

Have made these many times. They are fantastic. Have used 1/2 marg, 1/2 butter when I was low on butter and they were still great. I've added coconut, dried cherries, white chocolate chips, dried mangos - what ever I have in the pantry.  Really great recipe!

Excellent, but I made quite a few modifications, based on the ingredients I had on hand. I used ww pastry flour instead of all purpose, half quick cooking steel cut oats and half rolled oats, cut dough into 2 parts and added raisins to one half (good). To the other half, I added a combo of 1/2 cup semi sweet choc chips and 1/4 cup sweetened flaked coconut. I let the dough sit for about 45 mins before baking to allow steel cut oats to soften. The choc chip/coconut version was a huge hit with my hubby, who is VERY picky about cookies. Not too sweet, very hearty and filling, but also satisfies the sweet tooth! (Shared recipe in my profile under "Oatmeal Choc Chip Coconut Cookies")

Just got done making these and they are wonderful. Crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle. I did adjust just a bit. used 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white. I wanted to make sure they would not be runny. I also did 1/2 tsp of a cinnamon spice blend and 1 tsp of cinnamon. They still could take a bit more for even better flavor.

My family loved these cookies.  We made 2 more batches and  I added 1/2 tsp ginger and  small amount of grated nutmeg to the first batch.  The second batch I added 1 cup chocolate chips.

Very good cookies, but if you use unsalted butter, be sure to add back in 1 tsp of kosher salt.

This will be my new go-to recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies!  I used a heaping teasp of cinnamon and also added about 3/4 cup coconut.  I rolled the dough into balls instead of dropping them and they come out more round and moist.  I also always error on the side of underdone instead of overdone.  I baked them for about 8 minutes.  Fabulous!

i followed the recipe exactly but added a little extra cin. has an ok flavor, but i was pretty disapointed, it has a cake texture, not a cookie texture, so it wasn't as moist as i was hoping. oatmeal raisin is my favorite cookie, but i won't make these again.

I took this recipe as a base and took it to another level.  First I used 1/2 c butter, 1/2 cup shortening.  Added a tsp of salt per recommendation of other reviews (which I would have done anyway, how can the flavors be brought out without salt?) Then I used 3/4 c whole wheat flour and 3/4 c ap flour, 1 tsp molasses, 2 tsp cinnamon, nutmeg, 2 tsp honey.  My husband doesn't like raisins, so I seperated the batter made half with raisins, the other half with mini cinnamon chips.  He didn't realize I had made two different flavors and ate the cookies with the raisins and LOVED THEM!! What else can a wife say when you can get your stubborn German husband to eat raisins! Oh, almost forgot.  Let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet to set before putting on cooling rack.  This will keep them from crumbling and changing shape.

Great recipe. Only changes I made were I used margarine instead of butter, 2tsp baking powder because I didn't have baking soda, and I was out of regular oats, so I used a box of Apples and Cinnamon instant oatmeal (3 packs=1cup), and it came out delicious!! I will definitely be using the instant oatmeal packs from now on when making these...it just added to the taste!

This is a really easy recipe. I left out the honey because I didn't have any. I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. They are very good, not really sweet, but good.  I would recommend it and will be using it again.

I have a hard time with oatmeal cookies.  But I have to say these ones are wonderful.
I made a few changes.  I used canola oil, instead of butter (just added a touch of salt).  I used Splenda brown sugar blend, instead of regular brown sugar.  I added about 3 tbsp. of honey.  I also used slow oats, because that's what I had, AND I added a 1/2 tsp of clove to the mix!  I know it sounds a lot, but they're really very subtile differences.  Or so I think anyway.  hehehe
The recipe made 80 cookies for me!  Cute, and tiny, firm on the outside, soft, and chewy inside!  I really liked them!  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the best oatmeal cookie I have ever made.  My son and I made them last night for him to take to pre-school.  They are very soft with a little crispiness around the edge.  I think that little touch of honey adds so much to the flavor.  Thanks for the newest addition to my cookie jar!

Delicious! I too soaked the raisins. I ended up using 2 1/2 cups of oatmeal but I should have used all 3 cups, due to the soaked raisins the dough was quite wet. Added a little more flour to compensate but I think the oats would have been better. Also did 1/2 baking soda and 1 1/2 baking powder so they wouldn't be flat.
One last thing-due to some others saying how bland they were, I used APPLE PIE SPICE which gave it a great flavor! I used 2 tsps, I think a little more would have been even better. Otherwise, loved this cookie.

AB-SOL-UTE-LY one of THE BEST recipes I've made on this website!!! The only change I made was adding a tsp of salt. They came out FANTASTIC! Soft and delicious, even the day after.. These are much, much, better than store bought and will serve me well for years to come.

I was disappointed with these cookies. I used about 2 1/2 cups of oats because 3 just seemed like too much. The dough was delicious, but the cookies didn't spread at all and were just a little bland and dry. Also, it is definitely a stretch to call these healthy!

Good base recipe but I would definitely go with the suggestions of other reviewers. I made two batches the first one exactly as the recipe says and instead 24 cookies I got one big mushed cookie because they were so runny  LOL my husband found it interesting but me ... not so much :) the second batch with more flour  is still in the oven so we will see

these cookies taste healthy but the only thing holding them together is butter.  I made no substitutions (except replacing 1/2 cup of white flour with wheat) and made sure to use salted butter but these cookies are not dessert.  I could see eating a couple with a cup of coffee for breakfast - but not the sweet I was looking for today. too bland.

I made these cookies this afternoon and my first thought before I even put them in the oven was wow the batter smelled and tasted great but it looked thin.  Sure enough I was right and they ran and almost burned.  So through trial and error I ended up adding about another cup of flour and baking them on a light colored sheet between 10 and 12 min.  Absolutely the BEST cookies I've ever had, even my daughter who protested me making them in the first place is on her 3rd one.

Followed recipe as written but discovered at the last minute that I was out of honey. The still came out great. I'm sure next time with the addition of the honey, they will rate a 5.

WOW these turned out better than I expected. Me and my 1 year old were bored (lol) and we had all the ingredients on hand so I thought we would try it. Actually, I didn't have baking soda so I used baking powder and just doubled what it called for. I did add a pinch of salt as others suggested. They were so homemade tasting. Moist and so tasty. Thanks...BTW this was his first oatmeal cookie and he agreed this is a keeper..

I made these cookies with my six year old son & they were fantabulous! The only change I made was to add a 1/2 tsp of salt.  The cookies were moist, chewey and mostly gone by the time dinner rolled around :)

Made as written would rate 5 stars.  With my additions due to family's personal preference rates it higher! Didn't have raisins, so used Craisins, added a handful of chopped pecans and a handful of chocolate chips. My teenaged daughter loved it because it wasn't sicky sweet like most cookies. My husband liked it because I don't enjoy baking but made these!

This is the easiest, most amazing oatmeal raisin recipe! I made them exactly as calls and they turned out perfect. If yours spread too thin, just add about 1/3 cup flour and they puff right up. Everyone is in love with this recipe! I've passed it out to several friends. Thank you so much for the fantastic recipe!

These cookies were great.  I followed the recipe exactly, but added dried apricots and sunflower seeds to it as well as raisins.  I skewed the recipe for 10, but it made 18 (might be due to the oxo cookie scoop that I use)- however no problem.  This recipe was great.  Adding the sunflower seeds and dried apricots made it taste similarly to Aussie Bites from Costco (which are delicious btw).  Only these tasted a LOT better.  I think next time I'll buy some flax seeds and add them in as well.

Summing up - fantastic cookies!

this recipe was exactly what i was looking for.  the cookies were a bit looser than i thought, so maybe add just a tad more flour.  also, i found the cookies caramelized beautifully if just left in the oven for 5 more minutes.

i made this recipe yesterday and added butterscotch chips to half the batch and chocolate chips to the other half of the batch. i shared them with my friends and i know they must have really liked the cookies because they ate a lot of them. they are thick and really maintain the integrity of the oatmeal; i'm not a big fan of flat cookies. and, of course, they taste great too.

Overall these cookies were good but there were a couple of problems that I had. The receipe says to not grease your cookie pan, but my first batch stuck really badly to my pan, so I used cooking spray for the rest of the cookies and it helped a lot. Also, one of the comments I read said that their cookies fell apart, as did mine, but my husband and I ate them anyways. I had read that they did not have enough flavor, so I put a dash of nutmeg in mine and the taste was great.

Very moist and chewy cookies.
Baked quickly, and browned instead of burning.
Would reccomend!

I made this with 1/2 c. wheat bran and 1 c. whole wheat flour. I also used 3/4 c. turbinado sugar. I added 1/2 t. of the following: cloves, nutmeg, and ginger (along with the cinnamon called for in the recipe). I made bars in a 9 x 13 pan, baking them for 30 minutes. These turned out even better than the other batch of bars (VII) I recently made--far less greasy and with a lot more texture. This might be the one I stick with (even after all my alterations).

Very moist cookie.  Cookie dough tastes very sweet prior to baking but the sweetness mellows once baked.  I soaked the raisins as suggested, which made them plumper.  Next time I will add a another tablespoon of honey in an attempt to sweeten a little more but other than that, I thought this to be the best oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I tried.

Loved these! They're really soft and moist, perfect oatmeal raisin cookies! Lately, I've been eating lots of really sugary cookies and cakes, because baking helps me cope with stress. This recipe is perfect for a healthier, perfectly delicious cookie!

My first couple of batches tasted excellent, but they were quite brittle and thin. A couple fell apart.Then I added an additional 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, and they tasted great! These are yummy cookies, just make sure you include the extra flour.

I was married for ten years before I found out that Oatmeal Raisin Cookies were my husband's favorite. I made a half batch last week to test the recipe and a whole batch this morning, so we could share with the neighbors. I did add a teaspoon of salt to the sifted flour this time with a marked improvement in taste. I also flattened each cookie with a fork just a little bit before baking. This technique made for a more uniform shape. I used a cookie scoop and it made exactly four dozen cookies.

I had been looking for a recipe that I could sub some applesauce in for oil.  This one worked well!  I read a number of reviews and made some similar adjustments to other cooks.  I used half margarine, half applesauce, and reduced the brown sugar.  I substituted 1 c. whole wheat flour and a half cup ground flax for the all purpose.  Just  because I like spicy cookies, I added cloves, nutmeg, and ginger as well.  I'm munching on them now as they cool down and they are delish...they aren't as moist with the modifications, but they are soft and not at all greasy.

Just made these. Not too bad an outcome but that's only because I added milk. Way too dry without it. The oats were just like dust in the bowl without any moisture. Granted, I did skip the honey but I doubt that would have made that big a difference in terms of moisture.

I made these last night. Instead of honey, I used maple syrup, and I added a teaspoon of salt because the first batch I made tasted... healthy. My family seems to like them, so I'll probably make them again.

Simple to make and were delicious. I got a few compliments as well. I'm not a baker but I felt a bit proud how well these cookies turned out. I'll be making another batch soon.

Easy and delicious! I followed the advice of another reviewer and added a dash of salt since I was using unsalted butter. I will definitely make these again!

My boyfriend was craving Oatmeal Raisin Cookies, so off to Allrecipes.com I went...this recipe seemed to be a little healthier with less sugar, so I decided to go with it. I have to say that as I was adding the 2 tsp of vanilla, I thought it was too much - and it was. The cookies smelled incredibly sweet because of the vanilla, but they were not very sweet at all. Granted, I was going for less sugar, but it is a cookie and you still want it to taste like one, right? I think with half the vanilla and maybe another 1/2 c brown sugar, they would be good, but we found them to be just OK. I also forgot to add the salt, as recommended by another reviewer, so I'm sure that didn't help. Sorry, Kathleen!

These turned out really well and were gobbled up by people at work. So easy to make, too, with the help of my Kitchenaid. But I prefer a chewier oatmeal raisin cookie. And my search continues...

A great cookie.  I didn't have honey, so I used molasses and they were still great.  I cut the sugar also.  Good texture, too.

Fabulous cookie. A client asked if I had a recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies with molasses. I simply used twice the amount of molasses in place of the honey. Next time I will remove the vanilla. Generally I love to bake with vanilla, however, the taste was to strong and overpowered the molasses.

Anybody tried making these at high altitude? I couldn't get any of my usual high altitude adjustments to work and ended up with cookies that had a nice flavor but were very flat and greasy looking.

This cookie is best oatmeal raisin I've ever had.  Followed the recipe exactly and while I thought it might not work out, they turned out perfect.  Very moist cookie.  I will definitely use this recipe anytime I want a great cookie.

If you're the type that likes a spicier cookie, then you'll definitely want to add more spices (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg etc). I added a hare more cinnamon, and a tsp of salt even with salted butter. Oh, and I substituted 1/2 c of drained applesauce for 1/2 c butter. A little less sinful this way! They turned out fabulous!

Excellent oatmeal cookies.  I think the honey adds additional sweetness and helps bind the ingredients together.  These cookies did not last in our house...I will have to whip up another batch this weekend!  Thanks!

Excellent cookies! I've made several of the oatmeal raisin cookies from this site, and these are the best.. chewy, but don't fall apart, and really yummy. I did add other spices however--nutmeg and cloves.

I'm not too huge of an oatmeal raisin cookie person, but these were just below what I would even normally rate. They didn't seem to have any flavor (I even added extra cinnamon after the first batch to see if that would help! It didn't...) and the texture was strange - almost between a cakey cookie and a true oatmeal cookie. Other people said they were "fine" or "good" but no rave reviews.

Fantastic cookies :) I wanted to make these, but I was out of butter. I substituted crisco, and they still came out really nice. Before I made them, I read everyone's suggestions and left out 1 cup of rolled oats. I won't do that again! I also added a little nutmeg and soaked the raisins beforehand. Thank you for this recipe!

Husband had a craving, said they were "darn" good cookies. I had to stop him from eating them before he got sick. I added two shakes of the salt shaker and about 1/8 tsp nutmeg. Very moist and very flavorful.

Ooo! This are really moist, and held together really well. I added a little salt. And I took them out of the oven and off the cookie sheet when I thought they were just a little underdone.  Perfect! My husband really likes these.  Fantastic flavor. They taste even better the next day.

Mmmm, really really good! I used whole wheat flour and probably only a cup of dark brown sugar since I didn't pack it.

These were pretty good. A little "crumbly" for my taste. I like crispier cookies. Otherwise they tasted good.

@Becky... I used 1stick salted and 1 stick unsalted and they came out delicious.  Although I did make some other changes.  I used 2 cups loosely packaged brown sugar and reduced the flour by 1/2 cup.  They came out just the way I wanted... delicious I!!!

These are pretty good.

I couldn't find oatmeal around here (Asia) so I used barley meal instead.  The malt made it way too sweet, so I'd suggest cutting the sugar by half.

Also, I was trying to do a Christmassy thing, so I used 40g molasses (instead of 20g honey) and added nutmeg and ginger.

If you're using rolled oats or barley; both of these are pretty dry and might upset your stomach; I suggest soaking the raisins and then taking water and all and mixing the raisins/water with your oats/barley.  Let the barley/oats absorb all the water for a while, then use it as normal in the recipe.

I made this twice. Very good! I used the Splenda brown sugar blend instead of all brown sugar and the cookies turned out just as good as using brown sugar. Follow the measuring directions on the Splenda package. Also, I used margarine instead of butter to cut down a little on fat.

This recipe is very good. I switched out the all purpose flour for whole wheat flour, no other changes were made. Light, fluffy, and held together wonderfully. Be sure that butter and eggs are at room temperature, this makes all the difference. 5 stars!!!!

These are, BY FAR, the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever eaten, let alone made! I followed the recipe exactly (which was a first coz I usually don't have all ingredients on hand), and they came out absolutely fantastic! This made about 56 cookies for me-- I'm not good at uniform-sized cookies-- but at 10 minutes per sheet in the oven, they were done in no time. My son-in-law ate (I am not exaggerating) 14 cookies in 3 hours. I think I may have to hide them so the rest of us can have some. THANK YOU!!! Will make these all the time!

I've made these a few times and they turn out so moist and chewy. I love a lot of raisins so I add another 1/2 cup and I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of unrefined coconut oil to cut down on the butter in this recipe!!

My dad wanted me to make him some oatmeal-craisin-pecan cookies and I used this recipe as the base. He loved them and has asked me to make them several times since then. He shares then with his coworkers when he travels and I get so many complements on how perfect these taste.

Awesome cookies.... Because this recipe doesn't call for salt I def recommend using it. I made 12 serving and used about 1 tsp salt. But if your using salted butter then u probably don't need to use salt. Whole family loved and will def make again.

First time I followed the recipe ALMOST exact - my family doesn't care for raisins, so I always bake with craisins.
This second time I substituted 1/2c white flour with 1/2c whole wheat and added some nutmeg. 
First batch baked at 15 minutes - a little too long. Will do second batch at 12.
Perfect cookie. Everyone loves them. They are in demand.

This recipe was delicious. I did add about 1/2 tsp of allspice and probably added more than a cup of raisins, but those were the only changes. They came out delicious. Everyone loved them! I will definitely make these again!

Super yummy oatmeal raisin cookies!! Didn't soak the raisins and turned out just fine. I added about an 1/8th teaspoon salt because I used unsalted butter. I sprinkled in some nutmeg too. Delicious!!

Awesome recipe. Great Cookies.  I tried reducing the recipe to 1/2, and found they were a little dry…this kind of thing happens when playing with a recipe.  I will try halving it again, and use two eggs.  I will be in touch.  Yummy.

I made these today and found them to be a little dry and they don't spread out in the oven even though they seemed to be of the correct consistency when I dropped them onto the cookie sheet.  My husband enjoyed them with his tea, but he eats anything sweet. I did not find them moist as in other reviews.

Incredible! I substituted in organic whole wheat flour,  canola butter (1 to 1 ratio of butter & canola oil blended at room temp) for the flour & butter.  Plus, I used all organic ingredients.   End result,  wholesome, non GMO & DELICIOUS!!!!!

I used 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and a cup and half of raisins.  Next time I will up the raisins to 2 cups, but I really like raisins. lol Also, need to add a pinch of salt if you used unsalted butter -- I forgot to do that.  They weren't bland, but didn't have that pop.

I love this recipe not too sweet, lots of raisins. I think when I make them again I might add a little allspice just to jazz them up a bit.. N.Foster

I was really afraid the cookies would spread and run with all the butter but they were perfect and yes I always add a little salt. I live way below sea level so I never have to make compensation for bake goods like I do when camping high up in the mountains of CO.The 
cookies were crisp and chewy, good recipe.

Mine were good. I didn't drop by spoonful. I rolled a lil like a biscuit and they weren't runny. Also had a fresh double yolk egg instead of two eggs. Yummy. Just sweet enough!

Very tasty and filling cookie. I have made these cookies many times and think it's easy to make it to suit your taste. My change is to add double the honey, double the cinnamon and 1/4 cup more raisins. Yum Yum

Loved these, but did make a few changes..  Lowered the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, added 1/2 cup maple syrup, lowered the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp, and eliminated the honey.  Only because I happen to have the syrup and not the honey this time.

This is a great recipe for a chewy oatmeal cookie! I followed the recipe to a T, except that I boiled the raisins for about 2 minutes then let them sit in the water for 5 additional minutes before draining them.

As another user noted- there is no salt in this recipe, so if you use unsalted butter, you really need to add some!  I forgot it when I made my first batch and they were so bland.  The next time I added a teaspoon of salt, used baking powder instead of soda, almost doubled the cinnamon, threw in a little nutmeg, and was generous with the honey.  I don't know if I've ever gotten so many compliments on something I've made! They're amazing!

Nice buttery oatmeal cookie. I always soak my raisins first. I did try to modify the recipe by subbing whole wheat flower and some flax but it made the cookies flat and hard to scrape up. I won't be trying that again.

My fiance asked me to make his favorite kind of cookies for the holidays. I have never made oatmeal raisin cookies before and this recipe got me great reviews from him and he just finished the xmas batch and is begging me to make another. His only suggestion is to add more raisins as he loves them.

This is a delicious cookie! I added a tsp of salt as I use unsalted butter, subbed half the white flour for WW flour and reduced the butter a bit and used chocolate chips instead of raisins and the cookies are moist and chewy.

These absolutely rock!  I never tamper with anyone's recipe, but I didn't have all the things necessary to make it true to Kathleen's recipe...but with the following additions...they are blow away!!!!!!
1 1/4 cup spelt flour instead of ap flour 1/4 cup chia seeds (added fiber and omega 3's and I put that stuff in everything!) 1tsp salt 1 tbs pumpkin pie spice and 1/3 cup liquid egg white in place of 2 eggs and 1/2 c craisins

As good as these are...can't wait to try it "true" to the recipe.

So easy to whip up and ready for the kids when they get off the bus!

Thank you, Kathleen :)

I made these cookies and the dough was so thick, it was hard to stir.  There is not enough moisture to this recipe.  I had to add some water to be able to stir it, at the end.  Needs more oil or something.  Will probably try a different recipe next time.

I agree with Becky that this recipe needed salt which thankfully I added ahead of time due to her heads up. I also would add more brown sugar and/or honey, because I like a sweeter cookie. I also added 1/2 cup of dried pineapple in place of 1/2 the raisins and a 1/2 cup of black walnuts. I turned out well. All in all, a good recipe, not a great one.

Tasty but I found these to be a little too sweet, especially when still warm (would have been fantastic right out of the oven with some vanilla ice cream ... yum).  I really liked the honey and cinnamon flavors but the sweetness level would work better with walnuts instead of raisins (kind of an oaty baklava).   I'm definitely going to make these again with raisins and less sugar or with walnuts.  Also, I didn't add salt as I figured the baking soda would add enough saltiness (mine weren't bland at all).

These were the BEST oatmeal raisin cookies I've made. I have finally found my recipe that I'll stick with, and throw the others away! The fact that it's healthy is a bonus. I used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour, and added 1 teaspoon salt, plus a few grinds of fresh nutmeg.  They're perfect. Thank you!!!!

I think this recipe uses a little too much oats, the cookies were a bit dry. If I didn't bake them as long, the oats wouldn't be cooked through...(I used quick cooking oats too) Maybe cut back on 1/2 cup?

I made these twice already...The first time I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of raisins I used 1/2 cup dried blueberries and 1/2 cup of dried cherries.  They ended up coming out quite good - but were not as soft/chewy as I had expected.   This time I made them I chose to experiment and I used 1/2 cup extra virgin organic coconut oil and 1/2 cup organic unsweetened applesauce, dark brown sugar, 1 cup whole wheat flour and only 1/2 cup white flour...and dried cranberries (because that is all I have in the house). They came out decent - more cake like in the middle, and a little more bland - but my 5 yr old niece loved them and she hates oatmeal cookies usually.

We loved the recipe. I am currently baking my second batch. My two kids and husband loved them. They were gone in two days and asking for more.  The changes I made, which was mentioned before, was adding nutmeg about 1/2 tsp or so, 1/2 tsp of salt. They taste great! Thank you for the recipe!

These cookies were delicious. However, I halved the oats and used 1/2 cup blueberries with 1/2 cup raisins. Yum, they were delightfully chewy with the blueberries adding extra bursts of flavor!

These were great!  I made a few alterations such as adding some chocolate chips, some cardamom for a little spice and a little less than 3 cups of oats.  Overall, a great recipe and really easy!

I added a tsp of salt, plus a 1/4 cup more of butter. Salt to get rid of the bland flavor and butter for a more moist consistency. I also added just a dash of pumpkin pie spice for added flavor.

This is my first time baking cookies. I used 3/4 cup grapeseed oil and 1/4 cup butter and it turned out perfect. I brought them to work and they were gone in one hour literally. Everyone said it was very good.

Awesome recipe! My family doesn't like raisins so I added 1/2 cup coconut instead. I also cut the sugar down to 1 cup and added 2 more Tbs of honey. I let my 5 yr old decorate the tops of the cookies with chocolate and peanut butter chips before putting them in the oven :) Great fun!

Nice and chewy. Much better after an hour. Stick with the butter. I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of ground ginger and was very glad I had.

I loved these! They are not SUPER sweet but they are a great breakfast cookie or snack. My 2 year old son LOVES them! The first time I didn't have any honey so I just added a little extra brown sugar and they came out great! The 2nd time I followed te recipe 100% and they were good too! I'll use this again in the future!

Excellent recipe!  I have been on a mission to find the perfect oatmeal cookie recipe and I believe this is it.  It's easy to make, smells wonderful when cooking, not too soft and not too crunchy, not too spicy and just looks good!!  I added the 1/2 teaspoon salt as others suggested plus chocolate chips and walnuts.  I'm going to experiment with the butter (ie, half butter, half crisco), but will stay with this recipe.

My 14 yearold daughter made this on her own today, her first cookie made by herself.  They were fantastic, really good cookies.  The only change I had her make to the recipe was the addition of salt, 1/2 teaspoon.

Great cookies! I added about 1/2 tsp salt and halved the oats. Don't overcook, as they come out thin and chew. Perfect!

I'm not too sure what's healthy about a recipe with a cup of butter, but these cookies are definitely delicious.  I used a little less sugar and added some chocolate chips.  They came out great!

These cookies were good, but a little flat. In the last batch in the oven I added a little salt. It made a big difference. I also added some pecans, which I just happen to like in my oatmeal cookies!

I added a teaspoon of molasses to this and threw in cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, ginger, and cardamom until I was satisfied with the taste. At my father's request, i also used half whole wheat flour and half white flour for this batch. Delicious! These are a huge hit--my father, boyfriend, and brother are devouring them faster than I can bake them!

Followed the recipe (and used salted butter).  Results from the "offical cookie tasters" said they were the best oalmeal cookies ever.  Added some chopped cashews--nuts are always necessary.

The flavor of these cookies is wonderful but they flattened out quite a bit and were difficult to get off the cookie sheet. The shape changed when lifted with a spatula.

Excellent recipe! I also added just a 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp salt. Moist and delicious!

Very tasty and chewy on the inside.  A nice tasty snack with a glass of milk for a bedtime snack.

Really enjoyed these cookies.  Wish it was a tad bit sweeter, though.  Will add chocolate chips next time.  Thank you so much for sharing and God bless.

These are really good cookies,very moist, not dry and hard. I did not add 3 cups of oats, only 2, I feared it would dry them out too much.  I added chocolate chips instead of the raisins. Big hit, and no white sugar!!

These cookies are classic! I used light brown sugar the first time and they were mildly sweet. This time I used dark brown sugar, added walnuts, and a dash of nutmug....awesome!!!

Great, simple recipe for a tasty, not-too-sweet, chewy oatmeal raisin cookie. I will definitely make these again!
