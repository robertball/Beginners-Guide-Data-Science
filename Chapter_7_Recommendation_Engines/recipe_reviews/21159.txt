I never tried the original version of this recipe but I give it 5 stars with the alterations I made. Instead of honey, I added 1/2 cup sugar and cut the eggs down to 6. I also used frozen wild blueberries, which I prefer to cultivated blueberries. It was sooo tasty!

I used raspberries instead of blueberries and it came out fine, but it was definitely not sweet enough for dessert.  I added extra sugar in the recipe, and ended up sprinkling more sugar on top before eating it.  Without the extra sugar on top, it was like scrambled eggs with raspberries in them.

It came out more like flan than it did a traditional custard.  It was very good though.  My kids really enjoyed it.  The top got a little brown, but that didn't detract from the taste.  The flour also seemed to settle a little at the bottom, but that made for almost a crust.  I would make this again.

Not over sweet.  Personally, I find that to be a good thing because I think we drifted to the over-sweet in our food these days.  This recipe reminds me of the food in my grandparent's bakery in Germany.  I used gluten-free flour.  It worked fine.  I could taste a little salt in it, so next time I plan on halving the amount of salt used.    I used Martha Stewart colored baking sugar on top, in addition to the confectioners' sugar.  I love using that stuff.

I thought this was really good.  My kids weren't crazy about it.  I thought it needed to be a bit sweeter so I sprinkled more powdered sugar on it before serving.  Next time I may try raseberries and see if the kids like it better but as I said I thought it was great.

made this with other reviewers suggestions for change and my family really liked it! I used six eggs, i changed the flour amount to three quarters of a cup and added three quarters of a cup of sugar on top of the honey. it was sweet enough for our family. I personally don't really like custard and I thought this was delicious! Will make again - thank you for the recipe!

I liked it but it was very eggy - next time I will use more vanilla and sugar instead of honey. I might also try a stronger fruit such as raspberries or even a mix of berries. Also it was difficult to tell how done it was supposed to be - it was cooked and puffed around the edges but not in the middle - and it all fell as it cooled which was sad as it looked much less appetizing!

It was ok. Though, nothing to jump up and down about. I've used much better custard recipes in the past.

Not very good at all.  When I went to pull a piece out it just fell onto my plate like a big lump.  It resembles scrambled eggs not only by the taste and texture but by the look too.  So it's quite off putting.  I had even cut the recipe in half and only used 3 eggs.  I added 1/4 cup brown sugar and it was only slightly sweet which might have been fine if it had came out custard like but the scrambled eggs kept throwing me off so much I just couldn't make my mind up on anything.  Definitely won't make again.

This was a nice dessert, quick and easy, but it just missed the mark when served warm.  The custard was very eggy and could have used more sweetness.  I had added extra berries which I recommend doing.  However, the next morning  we enjoyed this much more served cold with whipped cream.

I like it!  I used 6 eggs, 1/2 C sugar and the honey and all the blueberries I had 2C. I rarely have fresh blueberries but I'll try it again if I get them. Oh I left it in the oven after I turned it off cause it was still soupy.

6 3 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/21159/blueberry-custard/ ... I went along with some changes that were suggested by several reviewers. Pretty yummmy.  I used more berries (4c) & they were frozen.  I should've added more flour than I did, which was 3/4c.  (No points off the review.  My choice.)  A cup may be too much, but I don't think it would take more than that.  I used half cup sugar, no honey.  Sweet enough.  Reduced eggs to six & salt to 1/4t, as suggested.  'Didn't add any sugar on top - or nutmeg.  This was quite unattractive, but with fresh berries & a bit of whipped cream or a mint leaf- or lemon twist - I think it might have a bit more selfconfidence.  :)  I put the eggs, milk & vanilla in the blender; then combined & slowly added (while running) the flour, sugar & salt.  Easy McPeasy!  I sprinkled the berries in the buttery dish first.  :o ... Okay, update now that it's cooled:  More unattractive & the flour amount was fine - only a bit of liquid in the middle.  'Reminds me of flan, which, in my mind, is a bit different than custard.

This is a very good recipe. I did do a few things differently. I took advice from some of the other comments. I only used 6 eggs, used about 1.5 cup sugar plus some honey, I also put about a handful of blueberries in the blender. then poured the cup of blueberries into it. After it cooled down I used the 10x sugar, nutmeg and added a small amount of cinnamon. I will definitely be making this again.

This was good.  Followed others advice to only use 6 eggs.  I used about 4 to 5 cups of blueberries, so as it cooked the juices came up and when sprinkled powder sugar over it making a nice sweek crunch on top.  The only other thing I did was add 1/2 cup organic brown sugar.  Oh and I did not use real butter, but parkay buttery spray (no fat or calories) which has salt in it so I did not add any salt.

Except for the fruit, this tasted and had a texture a LOT like scrambled eggs. The honey is mostly unnoticable as a sweetener; it might have been better had I followed the other reviewer's advice and added sugar.

Way too much eggs. I used 7 instead of 8. The whole thing cooked solid. No custard. Eggs with blueberries is a no go for me.

I made this as written, and it was excellent! You eat it just like you would French toast, with powdered sugar or maple syrup. It did take longer to cook than stated, but I used our duck eggs, which are jumbo or bigger, so that may have increased the volume. Mine puffed around the edges when it was done, and I put tinfoil over the top to keep it from browning too much. Will definitely make again, and will try with some frozen blackberries I have in the freezer. I also added fresh lemon zest, because the last thing I made with blueberries and fresh lemon zest was an amazing flavor combination, and that was a good idea. I bet this would be great with strawberries and other fruit as well! Yum!

I carefully followed the recipe and I am on my second 25 mins because the body of the custard is still like soup. The top did puff up and I had to put foil over the top to prevent it from burning. I tread the reviews (unfortunately after I had put it in the oven) but only one noted the soupiness of the custard. I would appreciate it if either the originator or someone who didn’t have this problem to give me some advice

It was simple and came out great.  I followed instructions except used unsweetened almond milk because I didn’t have regular milk.  No problem.   It wasn’t sweet.  I would make this again. Very happy with it.

If you want a sweet treat you need to add more sugar. More fruit would make it better.

This was excellent. I made this as directed with one exception of adding 3 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, only because I LOVE blueberries with lemon. I appreciated the recipe with honey vs. sugar which I do not use. I thought it was just right, but I am not a big sweet person. I used Pamela’s baking pancake mix instead of flour. This will become my go to recipe. Thank you for the recope

Not sweet enough to balance the blueberries.  The honey didn't make it sweet enough.  It was disappointing to my guest also.  A lot of eggs and inbred. Not to turn out well.  Will add white/brown sugar next time.

Made this exactly as listed, and although we enjoyed it, we weren't really sure it was a dessert. Not overly sweet, which is good, could have had more blueberries, and I might have suggested making it in individual custard cups, because the way it came out, my husband called it blueberry quiche

I often use this when I have too many eggs from my chickens.  It's easy and tasty.

My mistake I didn't read the reviews.  I followed the directions, didn't have a 9x13 so I used an 11x8 and dropped the temp to 350 and added time.  Looked really good, went to eat, not so good.

This was delicious!  Made it for company, everyone loved it.  This would make a great potluck dish for brunch--we heated up the leftovers the next morning for breakfast.  I did add a small amount of sugar (1/4 cup) per other reviews.

I've made this recipe many times as a breakfast for my family as well as when we have company. It's tasty, filling, and (I think) relatively healthy provided you keep the sugar on top to a minimum. Instead of honey, though, I use agave.

This recipe is a good concept, but needs a bit of alterations: 1. it needs a ton of berries to fill the empty space - if you get a bite of just flan, it's very eggy 2. it needs increased flour as well, to save it from being too "fluffy" 3. i sprinkled a bunch of vanilla sugar and nutmeg on top, after it was baked - which also worked out the bland-egginess  otherwise, it's great!

Maybe add two less eggs and a 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the honey.  The original recipe was a tad eggy and more like a quiche than a custard; not quite sweet enough for my taste, as I made it for dessert.

Delicious!!  We served it with a bit of whipped cream instead of the powdered sugar.
