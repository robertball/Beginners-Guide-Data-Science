This cheesecake is very easy to make compared to others I have made. I did add one ingredient though. Before i put the cream cheese mixture in the pan i tasted it and thought it could use something else. I added half a cup of baileys. YUM! The taste of the baileys with the caramel and chocolate to die for! I baked for 40 minutes with a water bath underneath and turned oven off and let cool  with the door open for about an hour. Perfect.

This was my first cheesecake ever.  It turned out great.  I couldn't find the oreo baking crumbs or Toblerone at the grocery store I went to, so I used graham cracker crumbs and chopped up a refridgerated Caramello bar.

Exceptional recipe...but then...it comes from the King of Cream Cheese makers! :) Although I did use the "light' cream cheese in a desperate attempt to lighten the calorie load! LOL! Was still fabulous, had to give over half away to daughter and SIL to take home so I wouldn't eat anymore of it - polished off the last piece I kept for breakfast this morning...ok...now...OFF to the Gym! Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and guests loved this! Huge hit! I also stirred about 3/4 cup of broken oreos into the batter. I didn't do a standard water bath as some suggested, instead i filled a 9 x 13 pan about 1/3 of the way with water, then put it on the rack just below the cheescake. When the top started to turn golden brown I covered it with foil. I followed the advice to turn the oven off, leave the door open and let cool for an hour. Next time ill try reese peanut butter cups.

I made this using no name cookie crumbs and light cream cheese.  I couldn't believe how great it turned out.  It tasted awesome and the cheesecake slices held together beautifully.

This recipe is so easy and by far the best cheesecake I have ever had!  I used other kinds of wonderful chocolate like turtles as a substitute for the toblerone.  I also use a little extra and put it in the cheesecake itself!  Enjoy!

Super excited about this recipe, made it and it wasn't good. Not sure why. I think it might have been the filling. No one really liked it.

I've never made such a perfect cheesecake....taste and presentation was yummy!.  The only thing I changed was made a regular graham crust instead of Oreo.  Only because grocery store didn't have them.  I was very pleased how it tasted. This will catch the attention of all your guests!

this recipe was easy to do, it was my first time making cheese cake. I added 2 banana's to the mixture and for the topping i melted 2 bakers semi sweet chocolate and drizzled on top of the cheesecake instead of the topping suggested in the original recipe. The cheesecake turned out great it had just a slight banana taste to it that everyone really enjoyed.

This was an OK recipe. If you dont have oreo baking crumbs. take about 1 row of oreo cookies and put them in your food processor. I used 2 tablespoons of Vanilla, and also added some of the carmel topping in the cheesecake mix. I think next time i will melt the candy bar and drizzle over the top of the cheesecake instead of using the chopped candy bar on top. I did not care for the texture of the candy on top. I also may add some hazlenut or caramel extract into the cheesecake mix. But the hubby did enjoy!

This cheesecake is the ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!! And, so easy to make!!!

I made a few changes:
- if cooking in a dark pan, lower the temp to 325 and check it after 35 minutes 
- I use light cream cheese and it tastes just as good (but with a FEW less calories!!)
- I use a LOT more caramel sauce.  I keep adding it until the entire top is covered and any cracks in the cheesecake are covered up!!!

I've never used a water bath and it's always turned our perfectly!

Whenever I make this dessert everyone ALWAYS  asks for the recipe!!!  Always perfect - always tastes amazing - always gets rave reviews - and always so easy to make!!!

Yummmmmmmmmmmmm!

delishhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! made this for my friends bday everyone went crazy and no one would believe that it was homemade! i used graham cracker crumbs instead cause im not a fan of oreo crusts in cheesecakes. i used a dark pan and 40 minutes was a bit too much.. the cake was great but if you're using a dark pan check the cake after 35 minutes!
also, i used dulce de leche instead of caramel sauce. it was amazing!! oh and i also added 1 and a half chopped toblerone bar to the batter.... deliciousness!

This was the most bland dessert I have ever had in my life.  I even went back to check if I had left out an important ingredient because it had so little taste.  Thankfully, I made it the night before I brought it to a Super Bowl party and tasted it to make sure it was edible.  I would have been embarrassed bringing that to the party!

This recipe is totally delicious! The only thing I did different was sprinkle some crushed Butterfinger candy on top. That simply gilded the lily.

I used cookies and cream chocolate bar for the topping instead of Toberone and used oreo crust!  I added 1/2 c of Bailey to the filling as suggested by someone and felt it was too overwhelming in flavors.  I will make this again without the Baileys!

Not the greatest cheesecake I've ever made. Used crumbs as recipe suggested...but they were a miss - not sweet enough to balance the tartness of the cheesecake. I had to keep adding more topping and caramel to make the cake sweet enough. Should just stick to honey graham cracker crumbs.

Such an amazing cheesecake!! I made it for a work meeting and everyone told me how fantastic it was! I substituted the oreo crust with a graham cracker crust and the ice cream caramel topping with Starbucks caramel, and I got so many compliments! A great treat for an aching sweet tooth!

I like this simple yet creamy recipe of a cheesecake...its my first time to bake a cheesecake and im proud of the result. I used crashed grahams and add 3 tbsp almond flour to the crust to add a different taste to the crust. Thanks again for this recipe.

i altered this one a bit --  i used dulce de leche instead of caramel ice cream topping. am not a baker but this turned out really well this way
