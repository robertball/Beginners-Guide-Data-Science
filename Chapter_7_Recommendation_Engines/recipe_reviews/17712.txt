I love this recipe.  I have made it many times and changed just a few things.  I make all of this in an oven-proof skillet, so when I finish the saute, I just put the whole thing in the oven to finish.  Increase curry to 2 tsp, add 1/2 tsp cumin, omit parmesean cheese, use olive oil in place of butter, cut chicken into 1-2 inch pieces, add potatoes cut into 1-2 inch pieces (boil first for 10 minutes). And I bake it for 30 minutes at 350, make sure to let the dish sit for at least 10 minutes before serving -it all settles very nicely that way, seems to be creamier that way. Sometimes I add some dried parsely to it just to give it an "herb" look.  Very tasty!!

My husband and I loved this dish!  I did everything on stovetop instead of baking in the oven.  I sauteed the onions and added some chopped green pepper in a skillet with olive oil, instead of butter, and in a separate dutch oven, I cooked cubed chicken breast with salt and pepper and olive oil.  In a separate saucepan, I put chopped canned tomatoes, tomato paste, 1 bottle of beer, and all the spices (extra curry and cumin!).  I added the onion/peppers to the chicken and poured the sauce & spices over and simmered for about 15-20 min.  I have a microwaveable rice cooker, so I partially cooked the rice, and then added it to the tomato and chicken mixture and simmered for another 10 minutes.  Sooo delicious!  I will be making this when friends and family come over.

This is the recipe my friends ask for the most often.  Taking another's advice, I have added some spices and made a few changes.  I add a can of drained diced tomatoes in addition to the soup.  With the diced tomatoes, I think the recipe needs more spices so I use 2.5 teaspoons of curry and add in 1.5 teaspoons of cumin and 1.5 teaspoons garam masala.  After it is finished baking, I dice up the chicken and serve the dish over rice.

Yeesh!  This recipe was a TOTAL bummer.  Frankly, I am COMEPLETELY mystified; since this had received 5 stars from just about everyone, I had been expecting it to be fantastic.  Followed the recipe exactly, only to get dry chicken breasts and a sauce whose smell and taste really turned me off.  Yikes!  The only taste-affecting variable I can think of to blame for such negative results (when everyone else seemed to have positive ones!) would be the type of beer used . . . but to be honest, I was so yucked out by this that I wouldn't try it again regardless.  Bummer!

I made quite a few adjustments based on the reviews - I seasoned the cubed chicken and onions with salt, pepper, curry, and paprika.  I browned the chicken with the onions in a large suace pan, then poured in 6 oz beer with 1 can crushed and 1 can diced tomatoes.  I then stirred in 3 tsp curry, 1/2 tsp cumin, cayenne, garlic powder, salt and 1 tsp basil.  When the chicken was almost cooked through, I threw in some pre-cooked cubed potatoes and cauliflower, let it all simmer and right before I took it off heat, a few dashes of cream to balance out the tartness of the tomatoes.  YUM!  Total hit  =)  I took away one star because of all the changes, but the basic recipe is great - very easy to make.

I changed the recipe a bit and used a whole chicken, more beer and lipton onion soup mix instead of a real onion.  It wasn't bad, but still needed more kick to it.

This recipe was great! It was easy to prepare and tasty. I did cube the chicken, and the curry seemed a little sweet next time I plan on adding cayenne to cut the sweetness.

I'm not a big curry lover but this recipe is the perfect blend to me.  I like to substitute diced tomatoes for the condensed tomato soup.

This was surprisingly good!  Because the sauce tasted a bit bland and too sweet, I added a little garlic powder and some garam masala along with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.  The result was a very yummy chicken curry that wasn't too bold tasting for my kids.  Who knew tomato soup could taste so good as a sauce?

This was nice and easy and tasty too!  Hubby really liked it.  Next time I may add more Indian spices but it was good as stated.  I cooked it all on the stove to same time.  And didn't add parmesan cheese; that just seemed odd with the curry flavor.  I only used two breasts so there was plenty of sauce to dip our naan in.  Yum!

After cooking the onions and stirring in the beer and spices, I personally didn't think this was spicy enough. So I added 1 1/2 tablespoon paprika, 1 1/2 tablespoon of cumin, 1 tablespoon of curry powder, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, and salt. Then it was delicious!

This was really good.  I like spices so I added a variety over what the recipe calls for (2 tsp curry, 3/4 tsp garam masala, and 1/4 tsp cumin, cardamom, chili powder and cinnamon).  The best part about this is that it doesn't require a special trip to the grocery store!

This is a very good base curry sauce.  Baking the chicken seems to really keep it tender.  I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times now, each time with a different variation.  I feel that the curry should always be doubled.  I have also added garam marsala and cumin (2tsp curry, 1tsp garam marsala and 1/2 tst cumin).    I suggest adding any combination of  chopped red potatoes, chick peas, cauliflower, fresh chopped tomatoes, chopped fresh cilantro, heavy cream.  The possibilities are endless!

I adjusted this recipe in the following manner to cook it in my slow cooker.  I used 2 cups cooked cubed chicken, 1 enveloped Lipton onion soup mix, 1 cup apple juice versus the beer called for, 2 teaspoons curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon cumin.  I also parboiled some small red potatoes(just enough to fill the bottom of a six quart Dutch oven, in one layer with 2 Tablespoons salt.) I cubed the potatoes and placed them on the bottom of the slow-cooker.  I then put the cubed chicken on top of that.  I then made the sauce and poured that over all.  I cooked this on the lowest setting for five hours.  The length of time allowed the flavors in the sauce to permate the chicken and the potatoes.  It was just the right amount of spiciness for me.

This will sound silly, but I prepared this with a very strong wine buzz. Once I was convinced that I had destroyed it, I recklessly threw in haphazardly measured ingredients (original ingredients, though), + some cumin. So there I was with my sangiovese and some Steely Dan all through the kitchen when it was suddenly filled with the most delicious aroma! My point? Even my goofiness could NOT sabotage this recipe! EVERYONE loved it despite the predicate, "Yeah, I probably screwed this up but it's this or Alpo." Mad props to the submitter!   PS - as others have already suggested, the cumin + extra curry works. My face is still sweating, and that's a good thing!

Made some changes, like adding potatoes, using tomato puree (not the soup), and adding some more spices, I thought it was ok. My 7 y.o. LOVED it, rare for her to like anything w/ curry, so I have to give it a thumbs up!

I cubed and sauteed the chicken with the onion. Added the rest of the ingredients to this and simmered it for 15 min. I omitted the beer and substituted 4 oz cream cheese at the end of the cooking. Served over rice.

This was pretty good. All the leftovers got eaten up. One thing, I followed the recipe except my chicken breasts were frozen, and the meat was dry. My chicken often comes out dry, what am I doing wrong?? I did cover with foil too. We served this with peas and fried potatoes with green peppers and it went well together.

Oh WOW!  This was great and so refreshingly unique in the world of chicken recipes.  I doubled the basil and curry,used sweet onions and half of a leftover green pepper.  I also usedl1 sliced zuccinni one yellow squash and well a whole bottle of beer.  Served with wild rice and this will be a dish for company in the future.I used provolone cheese cause it is what I had.Thanks Franny we LOVED this.

Very nice! Easy, but tasted like it came from a restaurant. Kind of an introduction-to-curry recipe. Was good with rice, and I recommend serving sauce separately for picky children and dieters.

I changed a little bit of the recipe, added double spices, also added garlic and onion powder. I didn't have beer at that moment, but used chicken stock instead, then cooked on the stove instead of oven, and i totally forgot the cheese, but it still tasted good. Try to eat with mash potato, it is a good match!

This was very, very mild, but good.  I even sprinkled it with a bit more curry.  We will make it again, but double the spices.  There was a lot of sauce and I think I will try to thicken it when I make it again.

I combined some of the suggestions on the reviews to make this and it came out great: I doubled the curry, added a half teaspoon of cumin and garam masala, added cubed potatoes, omitted the parmasan, and added a can of diced tomatoes with the juice, and cooked it all up on the stove top.  Pretty far from the original recipe, perhaps, but it was all based on reviewers suggestions and we loved it!

This was the best chicken recipe I have ever made!! My hubby loved this - that doesn't often happen.
I followed the recipe exactly, then added more curry powder, garam masala and cardamom as per the advice of another reviewer.

Recipe is really great, but I did make some changes.  There didn't seem to be enough sauce to fill a 9x13 pan, so I baked it in a 9" pan instead. We aren't beer drinkers, so I used chicken stock instead, and replaced the butter with EVOO. Also added some garlic powder & about 1 Tbsp. ground cumin. Instead of the parmesan, during last 5 minutes of cooking I sprinkled shredded mozzarella. It only needed 30 minutes to cook with a few minutes to sit afterward. Served this over rice and even my 21-month old loved it!

Very good basic recipe to try to get my husband to enjoy curry as much as I do. I would call this "training wheels" curry. Also, I thought the beer lent an unnecessary flavor layer -- and don't get me wrong, I LOVE beer -- I just don't believe it suits curry all that well (let's stick with Irish stews for that :) Suggest chicken stock instead. Probably will not make again since it was just "too basic," but do appreciate it's value as a first pass for hubs!

I loved it!  But I do think cubing the chicken and serving over rice is a great idea.  I will do that next time. But as is, this recipe was so easy and so tasty I know I will be fixing it again. It tastes like it was a lot more work than it was. I also liked the suggestion of doing it all in an oven-proof skillet - one less dish to wash!

At first taste, I was not that impressed with this dish. However, as I allowed the food to sit in my mouth, I was able to distinguish the different flavors and I found that I really enjoyed this dish. Once again I was thwarted by ingredients available in Bolivia. We have no condensed soups here. So, I took a can of peeled tomatoes and chopped them up, mixed them with a can of condensed milk and a bit of heavy cream. I added extra basil (I can't help myself when it comes to basil!) and a bit of salt. All in all it turned out to be a good 'tomato soup'. I tripled the curry (by the way, there are so many varieties of curry out there, I would be careful with doubling or tripling until you know if it is spicy or sweet.) I also did not add the cheese. I served this paired with the Indian Basmati Rice recipe found on allrecipes. Great meal.

A very good basic tomato curry.  I prefer boneless chicken thighs for curries (I always sear meat in a skillet with a bit of oil before transferring to a baking dish) , and used them in this dish.  I also used 1 1/2 tsp of curry powder to give a bit more of a kick.  I also used fresh basil.  I did use a darker beer (Modelo Negro).  There were no left overs.   I served this with Basmati Rice and peas and carrots.   I will make this again.  Thank-you Franny for posting this one.

I liked this recipe.  Have played around with it by adding more curry and cayenne pepper on the days I want something spicy.  Since I don't like alcohol, I use chicken broth instead.  I've also tried this sauce on fish instead of chicken and it always comes out great.  Really yummy with feta sprinkled on top.

there is not much to say about this except that it's absolutely delicious!  by far my favorite recipe that i've tried out.  you can adjust the level of heat by simply adding more of the curry and perhaps additional pepper but it's certainly not necessary.

Great recipe...I took the advice of earlier reviewers and cut the chicken into bite size pieces. The boyfriend and male roomie loved this dish; there were no seconds. We love curry, so adding more (2 or 3 tsps) is a must. Definitely needs more kick...cayenne pepper. I'm making this again tomorrow night as requested in advance by the boys! Thank you for the recipe!

I took the suggestions of adding a few dashes of cayenne and crushed red pepper, doubled the curry and added 1/2 tsp cumin.  Included boiled potatoes and left out cheese, served with Jasmine rice.  We thought it came out very tasty and you would never know it's soup based!

I was skeptical when I read the ingredients list, but it comes together really well and has a great flavor.  I made a couple of changes:  I only used 4 chicken breasts (which was just the right amount), I didn't have any basil so I threw in a little italian seasoning (not much) and I did it all on the stovetop which I think made it even simpler.  I will make this again, even my husband who doesn't really like curry liked this!

I used many of the suggestions made by others, in particular Irelandmeals, and added a few of my own.  

I prepared the entire dish in a wok as follows:  First I browned some diced chicken thighs, seasoned with s & p.  Then added 1/2 an onion, equal amount of green pepper, and 1-2 cloves of garlic (minced).  Then added several large peeled shrimp, removing and setting aside as soon as they turned orange.  Then added the sauce, which consisted of 1/2 cup beer, (6-8 oz) diced tomatoes, (1 Tbsp) tomato paste, pinch of sugar, triple the curry powder, 1/2 tsp each of cumin and dried basil, black pepper and also chili flakes.  While reducing, I boiled some udon noodles, and added those (drained) along with the shrimp when the sauce was the proper consistency (I like it quite thick.)  Parmesian cheese and more black pepper to finish.  While this version takes us ever farther from the original, I found it to be most excellent.

Great recipe!  I took the advice of others and added a bit more curry powder (1 1/2 tsp), and added a bit of cumin (1/8 tsp), and I baked it for 45 minutes.  Great served with white rice!

This was a huge hit - delicious and very easy.  I did add extra onion, extra curry powder and some salt.  This one definitely has a permanent place in my recipe box.  It's also great to heat up in the micro for the next day's lunch!  Thank you VERY much for posting this one! :-)

This was completely delicious and easy! Following some other suggestions, I changed it slightly: instead of the soup, I used a can (15 oz) of tomato sauce. I also used the following spices: 2.5 tsp curry powder, 1.5 tsp cumin, 1.5 tsp garam masala. Plus I skipped the cheese & used vegetable oil rather than butter. Definitely a winner!

I loved this recipe.  I made it exactly as recommended except I cubed the raw chicken and cooked it on the stove in the sauce.  I served over rice.  Awesome and much faster than the baked method.

The first time I made it I wasn't so sure. I made it a second time with about half the curry, and it was much better! I have also tried this with porkchops, and it's equally as tasty! The parmesan cheese really gives it a unique flavor! I think next time I will try this in the slow cooker, and am expecting great results!

I fixed this for my coop group last week, and it was delicious.  I added green pepper to the recipe like some others did.  Next time I will used tomato soup concentrate like the recipe calls for, instead of regular tomato soup, because mine was too soupy.  Will definately fix again!

The five-star rating is for my variation of this recipe -- not the original recipe. I prepared the recipe with tomato paste (mixed with water to correct consistency) instead of condensed tomato soup. I added cumin, garam masala, and more beer (I used Heineken) to the sauce to create an Indian-flavored dish that had everyone licking their lips and asking for more! TIP: When using spices for Indian dishes, add them in equivalent amounts; that is, if you use one teaspoon of one spice, use one teaspoon of the other spice(s). Curry is the only spice that you might want to add in larger amounts. Garam masala really makes my version of this recipe special! If you love cooking with spices and/or want the same garam masala I used, it's called Penzey's. It's a great spice store! (Btw, I'm not affiliated with Penzeys. I'm just an enthusiastic customer.)

Delicious and super easy!  I didn't have a can of tomato soup so I used tamato paste instead and it worked just fine.  My fiancee had the leftovers for lunch the next day and said it tasted even better!

This recipe was quite tasty but "missing something".  Adding extra curry powder and red pepper helped a bit, I'll keep on trying.

I was reluctant to make this because I don't like tomato soup, but this was excellent. I used a little water instead of beer. Next time I may try low fat milk. I'm giving it 5 stars because it was so easy and good.

For some reason I expected the flavor to be bold and I wasn't looking forward to is so much. I also wanted to serve something a little different for dinner so I was willing to give it a try. I'm glad I did, it wasn't really bold at all and I really enjoyed it a lot! served over rice and corn but peas would have been good. Also I've never been one for liking the taste of foods cooked with alcohol so I substituted the beer for a bit of beef stock and water. Definitely will make again!

Excellent recipe!  I did make a few changes, however - I mixed together all ingredients in a deep pan on the stovetop and brought to a boil.  I diced the chicken into small bites and added this to the boiling mixture.  The chicken cooks in much less time (less than 15 minutes) and is much more flavorful than whole breasts.  Also, I doubled the sauce recipe, as there just wasn't enough to go around with the original recipe.

The whole concept of the recipe is easy and wonderful. I adjusted the seasonings according to our likes and used chicken tenderloins pounded thin and browned lightly. You can step it up a notch or down depending on your personal preference. Side of mashed potatoes and a fresh green vegetable makes for a filling dinner with the right amount of eye appeal. Thank You for Sharing

My whole family loved this.  I had about 5 chicken breasts so I doubled the sauce as I usually find I don't have enough sauce.  There was enough and a bit left over.  The only other change I made was I added a package of fresh sliced mushrooms.  I served over brown rice.  I hadn't read other reviews before I made it so next time I will try adding cumin and see what the difference is.  Definitely a do again as it was an easy after work meal to make.

This was really very fabulous.  I LOVE my slow cooker, so I tried it in there and it worked really well.  I threw the chicken breasts in whole (raw AND frozen), added in my onion, and the rest of ingredients I doubled, because I knew I'd like extra sauce.  As per other reviews (and personal taste), I added cumin, and used extra curry (to taste).  I also used one can of tomato soup and one can of diced tomatoes instead of two cans of soup.  When it was almost done I tried the sauce and it definitely needed salt, so I added to taste.  Right before we ate I took out the chicken and chopped it, added it back to the sauce, and we served it all over rice.  It was pretty good but the sauce was really runny and I felt like SOMETHING was missing.  The next day, I melted an 8-oz block of cream cheese in my big skillet, dumped in the leftovers (there was quite a bit), and it was PERFECT.  I made my husband try it again for dinner (he's not a huge fan of indian food even) and he commented on how much the cream cheese improved it, and he asked if he could take the rest for lunch the next day.  I will never make it again w/o the cream cheese.  Soooooooo good.

This turned out excellent for such as easy recipe. I added cumin and cauliflower per other reviewers' suggestions (as well as omitted the parm cheese).  I also cubed and seasoned the chicken several hours earlier (garlic powder, onion powder, curry).  The biggest change I made was using one can of tomato soup with one can of Muir Glen Fire Roasted diced tomatoes.  I think this MADE the dish!  I also increased the recipe to 6 servings, but only used 4 chicken breasts, so that it would be extra saucy, which was great for the rice.  We like spicy in my house, so i tripled the amount of curry powder and added cayenne pepper.  After i took it out of the oven, i stirred in about a third cup of lite coconut milk for a more creamy sauce. It came out awesome and everyone in my house devoured it.

Great recipe, full of flavor!!!  I added cumin and red peper flakes as others suggested.  Also added more curry.  red pepper gave it too much heat, so I wil skip next time.  Otherwise, my family loved it!

I made it for my family and didn't expect it to be that good but it really was great. My boys came back for seconds, which is unusual when I make chicken curry.  The thing that I did different was used crushed peppers to make is spicy.  Great Recipe.   Shoby

Delicious but it does need a little kick for me - I added double the curry and some red pepper.  Substituted fire roasted tomatoes for the tomato soup.  Really good with a good rice on the side.

My changes: Brown cubed chicken in oil...remove..and return to pan when 'sauce' is simmering...Cover and simmer 45 min...uncover and sinner til sauce thickens another 20 min to half hour. I, too, used diced tomatoes but added a bit of vermouth in place of the beer that I didnt have...:) Added a touch of 1/2 and 1/2. Also added diced potatoes and bell pepper Served over brown rice. Still ..hmm...missing something....?

WOW!  This was awesome!  My husband made this and to be honest, I was thinking I'd have to eat something else for dinner as I don't like curry.  But, it was amazing.  I even had seconds!  We did make a few (slight) changes to make it even healthier.  We used olive oil instead of butter, omitted the parm (we didn't miss it at all!) and added small red potatoes to the dish.  Super yummy!  We will definitely be making this again soon.  Thanks!

This was really good.  My kids ate it up and they aren't big on trying anything new.  My husband said it was really good and he's not a big chicken lover.  I didn't have curry powder, so I looked online to find a substitute.  Couldn't find one, so I used the some of the ingredients I had on hand to make curry powder, but I didn't have them all.  I added a dash of ground mustard, cumin, garlic powder and pepper and it turned out great!  I'm definitely going to get curry powder though and try this again.

I should have known that since all of the reviews had their own variation of the recipe that it meant this recipe wasn't worth the stars they were giving it. I tried to fix it by using what everone else suggested and it's still not good in my opinion. I have one more idea of my own to go in the kitchen to salvage it, but when you have to stray from a recipe this much just so your family will eat it.. it's not worth it.

I made this recipe with lemonade instead of beer because we don't use alcohol, but it was still great. Taste was very good, perhaps four star, but the ease of preparation compared to many curry recipes makes this worth five stars.

Great flavor!  I added extra curry and some cumin and I think that made the dish have that little extra something!  My husband hates trying new stuff but he really enjoyed this, even took leftovers to work.  I served it over white rice and it was great!

This recipe was great! I'm not normally a fan of "spicy" food, but this was fantastic.  Like some of the other people, I added more curry (about 2 tsp.) and 1/2 tsp of cumin.  Served mine with brown rice and grilled vegtables.

I had 3 relatively thick chicken breasts for this recipe, of varying sizes, and cooked it for 40 minutes, then put the parmesan on and cooked another 10.  It was good, not as juicy as I would have liked...maybe next time I'll cover it with foil and bake it for the same amount of time.  The flavor was good, but I added WAYYYYY more curry powder than called for, and also added salt, pepper, and curry to the breasts before pouring the sauce over.  My husband said it was good, not great.  Easy, though, which earns a few stars in my book!

I thought this was absolutely delicious.  I made a little more of the sauce and served it over polenta with the chicken.  I also took some advice from the others and used more curry and also added some cumin.  I was very generous with all of the spices and even added some chili powder.  I did not have any tomato soup, so I used tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes, drained. I liked having the diced tomatoes in the sauce. I will definately be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe that is different from the same ole chicken recipes.

Pretty good.  I didn't have onion, basil or parmesan cheese.  I substituted onion flakes, dried coriander & left out the cheese and butter.  Also, I added a tiny bit of honey.  I would've given this 3 stars for taste but I'm going with 4 for ease of preparation.  I will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe.  I always bought the ready made "just add chicken" type of curry sauces-but I won't need to do that again.  Especially since I could make it with things that I already had at home.  Bonus-it gives me a reason to open a bottle of beer in the middle of the day!  I used a whole cut up chicken.  Today I'm just using thighs and legs.

This was sooo delicious.  My boyfriend is even a culinary graduate and he loved it so much!  I took people's advice and put salt and double the curry, and cooked for only 45 minutes.  The chicken was amazingly tender and the parmesan added the perfect finishing touch.  I'll definitely make this again!

This was great.  Served with basmati rice and green peas. I doubled the curry powder and added salt.  Also reduced cooking time to 45 minutes.  I'll definitely make it again.

Quick, easy and delicious.  I'll probably make twice the sauce next time, and save the half that I don't use on the chicken for rice - it's really tasty!

Good Stuff!  Works just as well, if not better, with chicken thighs.  When I used chicken breasts, they tended to turn out a little dry.

Delicious!  I added a bit more curry because I'm a curry nut and a little less beer because I'm not a big beer fan and it turned out great.

My husband said this was the best chicken I ever made!  I added chopped green pepper, tomatoes, garlic, and fresh basil.  Also, I added cumin and red pepper to liven up the dish.  I doubled the sauce and it was perfect.

This chicken is quite good.  It came out very tender and the sauce was delicious.  I used grated parmesan to top it but next time I think I will use a shredded parmesan/romano blend as suggested by other reviewers.

This was a delicious, easy recipe. I made it in my crockpot. During the last few minutes, I mixed in a bit of cornstarch paste to thicken the sauce, and added a few handfulls of raisins.

Really tasty, especially for how easy this was.  Let the onions cook a bit to bring out the sugar.  I served it over rice to soak up all the delicious sauce.

this was a pleasant surprise and a switch from the "same old chicken." i did not have curry so i used chili powder and some ginger, added a few splashed of hot sauce and in the end i had a parmessan and romano cheese mix. the cheese makes this recipe complete. we will make this again.

I did it with suggested changes (browned with onions in butter, seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, red pepper, curry, cumin, garam masala, skipped basil because didn't have on hand) and I used real tomatoes instead of any cans (I blended them in vitamix mixer) and used 1 bottle of beer. Let it sit in the oven for 45 minutes. The sauce came out very thin so when I served over rice,  I added some sour cream to make it thicker.  Since the recipe was made with many changes suggested by all recipes community, I gave it 4 stars. Other than that it's delicious!  Definitely a keeper for a weeknight dinner!

86ed the Tom soup in lieu of peeled, parboiled, fresh garden toms with a bit of skim milk and cornstarch. Had to up the salt to taste, but even my 4 yoa devoured. This is due for a 2nd try indeed

This was really yummy. I liked the flavor, but didn't seem to get as much of the curry flavor that I expected. I think I might add a little more curry next time. Other than that, it was great and something different.

This was just ok, the basil and parmesan were a little weird to me - not like a traditional curry.

I thought this was pretty tasty with the adjustments I made.  I, like others, made everything on the stove top.  I cooked the onion and a little garlic in olive oil, added cubed, uncooked chicken and browned it.  Then I added 2 cans of tomato sauce and a little can of tomato paste and the beer.  I also added fresh basil and 2 big tbsps of Patak mild curry paste.  I cubed 4 med sized potatoes and let it simmer while the jasmine rice cooked.

I doubled the recipe, I cut up the chicken into ~1" 'cubes', and cut up the potato (Yukon Gold) into roughly the same size.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  Personally I'll double the curry powder next time.  Wife and I added a bit more to our bowls, and I put a little bit more the left over dish before freezing.  4 Stars, because it's not the best in the world, but quite good for how simple it is.

Delicious recipe, will definitely make again. Modifications: diced chicken breasts into 1-2 inch chunks before cooking, used 2 tsp curry powder plus 1 tsp cumin.  I used an oatmeal stout for the beer, because that's what was in the fridge. Served with rice. My family loved it.

Very good! I chopped up a red pepper and used some minced onion instead of real thing.  Added some parsley and red pepper flakes and garlic powder.  It had a little kick.

Sorry, but this recipe was blah. Had to add cumin, more curry, red pepper, fire roasted tomatoes, and zesty tomato sauce to make it taste good. I probably won't be making this again.

I was not crazy about this recipe.  My boyfriend made it exactly as the recipe says, and I just felt like the flavoring was off.  I don't think I would make it again, but it was a unique dish and glad we attempted it.

This dish is delicious!  I couldn't believe how good it tasted, considering the simple ingredients.  I baked it in a covered casserole dish, and left it uncovered after adding the parmesan.  Served on a bed of fluffy rice, it was amazing.  Thanks for this recipe!  Will definitely be making again.

This dish was okay, but a little tart and unsalty.  Might be my fault, of course.  Didn't have tomato soup, so used a 5 ounce can of tomato paste (+ can of water = 10 ounces of tomato soup? :))  Doubled up the curry and added cumin.  Decreased cooking time.  Could it have been the tomato paste?!

YUMMMMMM..... This was so tasty! My husband is very picky and he went back for seconds. It was very easy and made the house smell awesome. I used a red onion (cause that's all I had)  and it tasted great. This recipe has a really unique flavor.. i'd recommend it!

Very easy to make.  I added twice the cumin in the recipe and decreased the baking time to 45 minutes as suggested by others.  It came out great!  Would recommend serving over brown rice.

This was delicious, and very easy!   Like many others, I doubled the curry, and added 1/2 tsp of garam masala.   I was concerned that the parmesan wouldn't go well with the dish, but it tasted great.   I will definitely make this again.

OUTSTANDING!!!! This recipe was really easy and REALLY tasty! I followed the recommendation of the other reviewers who suggested extra Curry powder and 1/2 a teaspoon of Cumin. I served it with a rice pilaf and next time I might double the sauce because it was SO GOOD on the rice. :-)

Wow! What a great recipe! I also took everyone's advice and added an extra teaspoon of curry powder, along with some garam masala and cumin ... and it turned out great! Next time, I think that doing this in a skillet with cut-up pieces of chicken will work better

My husband said this smelled 'different' while it was cooking, but it tasted fine.  I doubled the curry powder, but otherwise kept the recipe as is.  Served the sauce over Parmesan Potatoes (I liked this, but my husband kept everything on his plate separate).

This was rather bland, and didn't smell all that appealing while cooking. It was edible, but I won't be making it again...

Delicious! I tweaked this recipe - didn't have condensed tomatoe soup so I used 6 oz of tomatoe paste and one large garden fresh beefsteak tomatoe.  Also added 1/2 tsp garam masala, 1/4 tsp cumin and a dash of salt.  Baked for 45 min. Served over brown rice.  Yum!

We liked this recipe, the beer definitely added a nice flavour.  Both hubby and kids ate it all up....I was the only one who liked it, but didn't love it, but I will definitely make again.

Wow- really good!!! I find it easier to use a medium saucepan instead of a skillet. My whole family loves it- easy, good, & healthy!! I also only bake the chicken for 45 min. total. Thanks for submitting!

Chicken was a little dry...but overall a great dish.  Easy prep, and very tasty!!!  Will definitely make again.  Next time I'll try to pour sauce over the chicken a few times while cooking to hold in the moisture, or maybe just reduce the cooking time.  I served it over brown rice.  Very good!

Wow this was great.  I made it for guests and it was a big hit!  My picky fiance liked it too.  I took the suggestion of increasing the curry and adding the garam masala and cumin and reduced the cooking time to 40 min.  Great recipe!

This turned out really well.  I used boneless skinless thighs instead, and reduced the baking time to 45 minutes total.  I also doubled the amt of curry powder.  I served this with saffron basmathi rice and green peas.  Yummy!

Once again, I try a recipe based on the outstanding reviews and I end up disappointed. While I think this has the potential to be great it really needs some tweeking because it is just a little to bland for our taste. My family voted this is NOT a keeper. Thanks for sharing just the same.

MMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm this recipe was delicious...  I served w/ White rice and was sorry i didn't make more rice to soak up the super-tasty sauce.  Be sure not to over cook the chicken and make it too dry.

This really didn't do it for me.  Sauce was a little too tomato-ie and sweet... may give it another shot to see if my opinion improves.

I wasn't too crazy about this recipe. I think the tomatoe soup really overpowers all the other flavors. Maybe next time I will use less tomatoe soup then called for. I couldn't even taste the fresh basil and curry.

Good and easy...Next time, I will double sauce and add something, such as artichokes or fresh tomatoes.
