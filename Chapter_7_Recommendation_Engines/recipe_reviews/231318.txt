I followed this recipe exactly, except added more lavender. I found the dough very hard to mix using the above method. Next time, I will mix the wet ingredients first, then add the dry ingredients a little at a time. The cookies were quite dry, so I would have liked to use less flour, but using this mixing method, I didn't have the option.
The recipe also doesn't call for the cookies to be flattened once on the cookie sheet.. since they are quite dry, they will not flatten just from baking. I recommend either rolling them out and using cookie cutters or flattening the balls once on the cookie sheet. 
The cookies were a bit bland, so I plan on using an egg white wash and sprinkling granulated sugar on them next time. And possibly adding a bit of lemon zest to the dough. 
Oh, and I made just 1 less than 2 dozen cookies after rolling them into 1.5 inch balls.

Added more vanilla and flowers. I also added two drops of lavender essential oil. It helped with the moisture. I also rolled the dough up into a log and then sliced the cookies. They were more uniform in size and deliciously flavored.

I made this several times the first time I did everything exactly as the  recipe said & it turned out pretty good but the lavender wasn't very strong tasting.  The second time I made it I put lavender and the sugar together and post it in my food processer ... it turned out great! Would recommend

Just got done mixing this recipe up...did not have any butter soft on hand so I used margarine, and I added a little lemon zest, but the cookies smell and look absolutely lovely!

The base recipe is good, but it lacks flavour. I tripled the lavender and added a lemon-lavender glaze (just soak the lavender flowers in lemon juice, strain, and mix the juice with powdered sugar until it reaches desired consistency). Four stars for the original recipe, five for minor adjustments.

If you decide to refrigerate it before baking, adjust cooking time to 18-20 minutes. At 15 minutes, the insides were a little underdone.  I used English lavender from the tea shop and put it through a mortar and pestle. No soapy taste. Great simple recipe! My husband enjoys these cookies!

Cut butter in half and used coconut oil and added a splash of raspberry vodka.

I added chocolate chips, and Â¼ teaspoon of salt to the recipe. The cookies taste bland without the salt. Otherwise a very good recipe

We loved it! We made it for Summer Solstice! Added a teaspoon of crystallized lemon and it was perfect.
