I used reduced fat cream cheese and chilled fat free evaporated milk. This makes a smaller sized cheesecake. I liked that this particular recipe had a very thin crust which is a dream for someone watching their carb count. My husband was the only one who didn't care for this dessert--my kids and I thought it was pretty good. I'd make this again. I think this would make a pretty good "mousse" dessert if I were to omit the crust, chop the strawberries and fold into the "filling", then pipe into dessert dishes.

This is delicious, and I have made it several times. BUT it is not truly sugar free unless you can find sugar free graham crackers. Graham crackers have quite a bit of sugar in them.

Absolutely delicious!  I doubled the recipe (family was coming to dinner).  No one guessed that there was no "added" sugar in the pie.  I did not change any of the ingredients, but assembled it a little different - Once the cream cheeze & milk & spices & pudding were mixed I added the sliced strawberries to the mixture and then added to piecrust of graham crackers.  This is really a nice treat and a very tasty one!  Thank you for the recipe - this is a keeper according to my husband (and me!).

I have just made this for the second time for our diabetic friend.  I used fat free white chocolate pudding instead of cheesecake pudding for a white chocolate cheesecake.  His sugar levelss spike when he has fruit, so I made a topping of whipped cream (0 carbs) and folded in fat free milk chocolate pudding.  I made it the first time for his birthday and he was beaming.  A definite good one and easy to make.

I used a half pint of heavy whipping cream and slowly added it to the cream cheese. Turned out really good thick like cream cheese filling. But no graham crackers. We love the mixture.

DOESNT SET! I followed the recipe to a tee for the filling albeit switching out strawberries for blueberries and the mixture is SO gooey. I ended up adding whipped cream to thicken it but the end product is still too watery. It ended up tasting like melted cheesecake icecream. I will add less milk and more cream cheese next time.

Easy & great recipe, but finding sugar free cheesecake pudding was impossible so I substituted vanilla which did work.

I also prepared this for a diabetic.  While it's true that Graham crackers have carbs, a diabetic is allowed some cards per meal.  I chose to use just the filling piped in sliced (crisscrossed at the pointy end) strawberries.  Thank you pinterest.  They are wonderful.  Cream cheese is very diabetic friendly.  It's nice to have a sweet treat that truly satisfies.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made it with Neufchatel cheese w/no preservatives and Annie's Bunny Grahms (organic). Delicious! Oh, and I didn't use cheesecake flavored pudding. I just used regular vanilla, sugar free, fat free pudding mix.

I like this recipe it is very easy to make!  I had to substitute almond milk in place of milk due to a milk allergy.  This made it not set as well, but still very good.

I've made this twice and loved it both times!  The second time I made it, I used a little less milk (I used heavy whipping cream) than the recipe called for b/c it was a bit runny the first go round.  Tonight I am trying it with sugar free cheesecake Jello and will melt some dark chocolate chips to drizzle on the pie before I put it in the fridge to set.

Super easy! I used a prepared graham cracker pie shell to fill. Fresh strawberries not in season so we had it plain. Better the next day to set firm. Many possibilities with trying different sugar free puddings such as pistachio.

Mine set up fine....husband said best strawberry cheesecake he's ever had.  Used fat free milk, fat free Jello cheesecake, reduced fat cream cheese.  Delicious.  Made it twice in one week and will make it again and again.

I made this today. Few things of note, 1 small box of pudding is not enough with the amount of milk in order to get a cheesecake consistency. I used two small boxes. I added 3 more tablespoons of milk and the consistency was perfect. If you use unsalted butter, I recommend adding a pinch of salt for the crust. The volume of the pie is thin. I added a layer of Lite Cool Whip to make it thicker.  I think next time, I’ll add just a bit of vanilla to bring out the flavor a bit more.

Couldn't find cheesecake pudding mix so I just got the sugar free vanilla. It was so good and no one guessed it was 'sugar free.' I could skip the pie crust and just serve this in cups with the strawberries! Love it.

I would make this all of the time! I changed out the graham cracker crumbs (I needed it to be gluten free) and used 1 and 1/2 cups of almond flour, 3 Tbsp salted butter melted, and 2-3 tsp of Truvia. I used fresh raspberries instead of strawberries (I didn't have any strawberries), I used white-chocolate sugar-free JellO instant pudding instead of cheesecake flavored, and I used half and half instead of milk to make it really creamy. HUGE hit! Everyone loved it. Great versatility with this recipe. Thank you!

I definitely enjoyed it, and it tasted good! But... the cheesecake mixture didn't seem to set very well. I had it chilling in the fridge for a few hours (so more than the 1 recommended) before serving, and it still fell apart as soon as we cut into it. Still tasted good, which is why I gave 4 stars.

I really liked this and so did my family. I purchased a 9 inch graham crust from the store and doubled the recipe.  Will keep this in my sugar free collection to make when that is appropriate.

Easy to make and fast. I was making for an office carry in , my boss is diabetic. Everyone really liked it. Light dessert. I substituted the cheesecake pudding for sugar free white chocolate since store was out of other. It was good.

Used almond milk, cut it back several tablespoons. Added a drop or three of vanilla.  Spooned into 1/2 cup monkey bowls, covered and chilled.  Topped with WM sugar-free strawberry preserves. (Used sugar-free fat-free Jello cheesecake pudding.)
Being severe diabetic this really takes the place of ice cream and other desserts without sugar spike, even after eating 3 bowls! Also froze some, very good with SF caramel sauce on hot as heck S FL  afternoon!

It wasn't bad. My pie plate must have been bigger then 8" because I could have used a lot more filling. Next time I think I will use 2 cream cheese instead of one and make more . Also used a mixture of strawberries and blueberries.

Loved this recipe. Only changes I made was I used 1 pint of strawberries instead of the 2.  Next time I might even use less strawberries.  The cheesecake filling was delicious and the graham cracker crust tasted better than the store bought kind.

My husband is diabetic, and as most know, its hard to find good diabetic dessert recipes. I would definitely rate this on the great scale for taste and ease of prep. I used 2% milk, sugar free cheesecake pudding. I prepped the recipe as written, with the exception   of using a pre-made graham cracker pie crust, which does add 5g of sugar, but with the added savings of sugar in the rest of the ingredients, it was still an acceptable level

I didn't make the sugar free cheesecake recipe because how can it be sugar free if you use graham crackers in it?  Graham crackers have sugar.  Do you know where I can get sugar free graham crackers?  I gave it a five star rating because unlike another "sugar free" cheesecake recipe I saw, it didn't have  frozen whipped topping which even when it says sugar free on the label it does have high fructose sweetner.  If that's not sugar I don't know what is.

I made this because of the ease, I did add sugar to the Graham cracker crust, skipped the nutmeg because I didn't have any but used extra cinnamon.  I also baked the crust for 10 minutes and cooled.  This was very addicting!  I made it again and made 2 pies, strawberry in the middle and raspberries on top, this recipe is a keeper!

OMG this was the easiest pie I've put together.  One thing I did do, which RLCLARK93654 might want to consider - I divided the strawberries into Pint 1 and Pint 2.  The first pint was chopped and then I sprinkled the pieces with 1.5 TBSP Splenda Blend (has a little sugar, but is still great for Diabetic recipes).  Pint 2 was sliced, sprinkled with Splenda blend and put on top. I also used a Keebler Reduced-Fat Ready-crust that I had on hand.   YUMMY!!

This recipe was easy to make and set up well in the refrigerator.  Based on others’ recommendations, I used half-and-half instead of milk.  To make it completely sugar-free, I used a pecan crust.  
 Now the bad news: I used Jell-O sugar-free cheesecake pudding. The sweetener they use is not very good, and you can taste the faint bitterness in the filling. I won’t be making this again. Instead, I will use my regular cheesecake recipe and substitute Swerve for the sugar.

I loved this but made changes. I add 1 more 8oz cream cheese. 3/4 cup of Splenda, 1 Tsp Cinnamon, and 1/2 Tsp nutmeg and 1 Tsp Vanilla extract. It set up nicely, I used fresh strawberries, Next time peaches or Blueberries.

The fastest dessert ever! And delicious! I didnt make any changes except for using a store bought graham cracker crust. Makes just enough to fit it.  I am diagetic and always looking for something sweet without sugar. This is the ticket. Loved it and so did my family.

I made the cheesecake as written except I did not do the layers. I made it in a 9" springform pan so it was shallow. Next time, I will double the recipe to make a traditional size cheesecake. Everyone loved it. I will use this recipe as my go-to for cheesecake. Easy and yummy!

I pureed a quart of strawberries and reduced the milk by 1/2 cup. Folded strawberry puree into cream cheese/pudding mixture, and poured into a pre-made graham cracker crust, as others suggested. Even DH said it was tasty!

If you don't have cheesecake flavored pudding, you can just use vanilla. It works just as well.

I was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and love to bake. I wanted to find something I could bake and enjoy. I shared this recipe with my family and no one guessed it was sugar-free. The pudding  like texture is better than regular cheesecake.I hope you try it, I give it five stars.

I doubled the recipe for 18 Easter tarts. I bought graham cracker tart shells already made & used Fat free Vanilla Instant Pudding. Also cut up strawberries & folded them into the batter before filling the shells. I added a whole strawberry (cut into four pieces) to the top of each tart. My mother-in-law is diabetic & they were a huge success. And so easy; definately will make them again.

I made no changes. It was super easy to make and was quite good. It's not your "traditional" cheesecake, but is delicious as a low-carb alternative.
