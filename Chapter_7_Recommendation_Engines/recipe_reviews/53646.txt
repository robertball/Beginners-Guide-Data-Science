This was really good!  However, after reading reviews I decided to use fresh, cooked asparagus rather than canned.  I can't imagine this tasting good with canned asparagus.

For someone who never seems to have enough time to eat, let alone cook, I have to say this is a great recipe. It's quick, it's delicious, and I had all the ingredients just laying around.  I did add artichoke and parmesan as well, and I used a tiny bit of mayonnaise because the sandwich looked a little dry. As it turns out, it really wasn't as dry as it looked, but the mayo was a good addition.

I didn't like these.  I've had asparagus a few tiomes before at resturants and liked it, so I thought that I'd like these too.  I guess it's just the canned asparagus that put me off.  If it was fresh asparagus cooked nicely then added to these I'm sure they would taste a lot better.

I made this with fresh asparagus that I simmered for a few minutes in salted boiling water, and then sliced in half. The cheese and bacon was, of course, delicious, but I didn't think the asparagus was a good addition. It was also pretty unwieldy to eat. I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't make it again. Thanks anyway.

I took these sandwiches to my sisters bridal shower and they were a hit. I followed the recipe just like it is and the only thing I would recommend is to either serve them immediately or heat them in the microwave right before you serve them. When I served them they were pretty cold and it changed the sandwich a little. Overall though they were wonderful and full of flavor.

I made these exactly as suggested and was not impressed. I love asparagus, but it was not good in these sandwiches. Canned asparagus stinks, I know, but I have a feeling that they wouldn't have been good with fresh aspargus either.

I thought this was good!  To lighten it up a bit I used turkey bacon which to me is a GREAT substitute and I didn't have the sourdough bread so I used some rye.  Also used fresh asparagus.  Great little sandwich and I didn't even miss the mayo!  Thanks!
