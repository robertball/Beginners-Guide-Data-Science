I bent this recipe a bit to suit my needs and to make a little tastier end product. For a little more flavor, I added more vegetables (little more celery, REALLY BIG onion, some chopped turnip) and more spices (fresh parsley, couple bay leaves, poultry seasoning, fresh ground pepper, little sea salt).  I wanted to make this into a rich chicken-ish noodle soup instead of potato soup so I nixed the potatoes, made my own handcut noodles (I used the steps from Great Aunt Nina's Noodles and Chicken recipe, which is also from this site) and cooked them in the broth of the soup after the removing bones step. This turned out a really flavorful soup that was comforting and filling. Cornish hens are almost always inexpensive and turn out some of the best dishes--this soup was no exception. I'll use this recipe again.

This was excellent!  I was very surprised.  It looked like the hen wouldn't supply enough meat for all of the veggies that this receipe calls for.  But alas, do not let it fool you.  This was perfect.  The best homeade chicken/hen soup I've ever had.  I did use more than dbl the broth to make it real juicy.  Also, used Egg Noodles, and it was WONDERFUL.  I spiced it up with salt, pepper, some greek seasonings, and a little bit of garlic powder.  Very, very good.  Thank you!

Perfect!  Budget friendly and really tasty!  I made this with Vermicelli pasta instead of potatoes.  The only thing I added other than that is a bay leaf.  I just halved the hen and browned.  BEWARE - those little hens take a long time to defrost - 3 days for a little hen!   This would be easy to expand with more broth and more vegetables.  An ideal cheap winter meal as written.  Thanks for a great recipe, Danielle!

This is a great recipe.  I made this the night before a snow trip.  Fast and easy!  I served egg noodles with the soup.  My critics were one hungry husband and 2 boys.  Warm fresh bread with butter rounded up this crowd, frozen from too much fun.  They finished lunch nice and warm ready for more snowball fights.

Perfect comfort food....I made a double batch to share with a neighbor who had a death in the family. She and her husband were so grateful to get a pot of steaming soup and rustic bread to eat before the news travelled and others brought the usual  "funeral food" for the family that would gather in. My husband and I LOVED it and I am making more this week to freeze in one portion amounts for him to take to work. Our only changes were to add some of our homegrown fresh herbs (parsley, sage, rosemary....the thyme was already gone for the season :-) ) during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Also, our broth was the expensive kind from the natural foods store, but it lacked salt, so we added what we thought it needed. I think the quality of broth really made the soup rich and tasty and it was worth the expense! The hens were so easy to handle...why hadn't we thought of that! Thanks for a great recipe that we will make over and over, I'm sure!

This soup turned out very good.  I used frozen onion, celery, and carrots as that is what I had on hand.  Be sure not to skip the browning of the chicken step.  It adds a lot of flavor to the broth.  I left the skins on my pototoes.  My husband and boys loved it.  I'll probably double the recipe next time.

Very tasty!  Who knew you could get so much meat from one little hen?  This made two dinners for my husband and I, for very little money.  He's a big fan of chicken noodle soup and thought this was great.  Thanks!

I made mine without potatoes and added a couple of bay leaves. It's become a weekly meal in our home now.

Such a good soup for a cold night. I wanted to add additional seasoning, but decided to try it as is. The results were very good, with only a bit of S & P added after cooking. Leftovers were great too!

This recipe is super easy, and super good.  The only change I made is to throw in some small ditalani pasta.  I like my soup to be more like a stew.  My step-son LOVES it, and he's a picky eater.

Good hearty soup but nothing really that special.  I substituted brown rice for the potatoes, which was a good addition.  This soup needs something in the way of spices to give it more flavor.

I had a hen left over from the night before I baked in the oven with wild rice. I boiled the hen in chicken stock to make it easy to debone. Added the veggies and garlic as you suggested and left over wild rice. Simmered it all in one pot. It was delicious! Much better than regular stewing chicken soup.  My wife enjoyed it as well. It's a regular now every time I cook Cornish Hens. I just make one more for the soup next day.
