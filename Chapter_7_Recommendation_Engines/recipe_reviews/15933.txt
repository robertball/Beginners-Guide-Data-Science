Very good recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  The only change I made was to use an 8" skillet of cornbread (in the South we don't use cornbread mix lol) I think it needs just a slight bit of tweaking to be perfect. #1--is mushy, so I think the cooking temp should be brought up to at least 350­° & possibly reduce the broth by 1/2 - 1 cup; #2--needs a bit more sage flavor, next time I will either increase sage by 1 tsp or use sage flavored sausage. (p.s..for those leaving out the green bell pepper, you are missing out on some great flavor,  just chop it really fine & you will not know it is there)

Update:  I remade this recipe; I decreased the chicken broth to 3 cups, upped the sage to 1 tablespoon, used sage sausage, & upped the cooking temp to 350.  IMHO those changes have made the dressing perfect (& now 5 star rated).

Well, THIS is Gloria!! I cannot believe my recipe it in here but I'm proud it is!  I do believe you need to cook the cornbread in a skillet first!  That would be better!  Thanks.  Louise and I have been friends since the 8th grade!

I made this recipe using Mrs. Cubbison's seasoned bread crumbs, one pkg. cornbread and one pkg. regular, and chopping up a left over loaf of day old french bread. I also used mushrooms and no green bell pepper(I didn't have one). I left in all the seasonings the recipe called for,even though the bread crumbs were seasoned(the only thing I reduced was the salt). Needless to say, everyone raved and had seconds and thirds. There were six of us and there wasn't much left afterwards. This is just a good old fashioned, can't go wrong, please everybody, kind of a recipe. I will be making this every year.

This turned out great!  I did use a little less broth; about a 1/2 cup less.  The flavor was wonderful.  A keeper!

This is wonderful! It is super moist and very easy.  It does take some prep time, but well worth it.  I have made this twice this season already and everyone wants the recipe.  They ate every bite at my company holiday party!  Hint:  I used 2 boxes of Jiffy cornbread and the second time I made it, I reduced the white bread to about 10 slices.  This will feed 15 people easily.

This was enjoyed by all on Thanksgiving!!  The only thing I would leave out next time would be the green pepper.  I like green peppers but I never used it in dressing before and I thought it did not taste well with the other ingredients.  I added 1-lb of mushrooms and used italian sausage.
Very good!

Good basic recipe but make your own cornbread and skip the mix.  The preservatives in the mix give the "stove top" "right from the box" taste that some have complained about.  Buy good quality, stone-ground corn meal, (Bob's Red Mill, etc) follow the simple recipe on the bag, and you will be so pleased with the flavor of your cornbread that you will never buy a mix again.  Make a large enough batch that some of the cornbread can be the cook's breakfast while the rest goes into the stuffing. 
 Warm buttered cornbread makes getting up in the wee hours to prepare the holiday feast much more enjoyable.
(if you are a baker, make your own baguettes or whole wheat bread for the white bread portion of the recipe.  I freeze a leftover baguettes and bread "heels."  Double wrapped, they keep frozen for 3 months.  You then eliminate all the bread preservatives and your stuffing will really taste like "Grandmother used to make.")

Thanks for the other reviews.  I doubled this recipe for a dinner with 20 adults, 11 kids.  I cut back the chicken stock as suggested, left out the bell pepper, cubed the white bread instead of using the processor (used a full loaf for double the recipe.  Cut it into cubes and then let it sit out over night) and added extra sage.  It was delicious and the crowd was very pleased.  Texture was moist (not dry or too wet) and hearty enough to chew.  I did drain the sausage.

Nothing fancy or unusual about this, it's just good, old fashioned tasting stuffing.  Brought back memories just by the smell!  We followed the directions except using veggie sausage.  My husband stated 'tasted MUCH better than the kind out of the box!'

This is much like I cook.  I have a little trick that really works well.  I add all of the condiments to the cornbread before baking.  It's tastier and easier.  I would leave out the bell peppers also.  Adding a couple of chopped boiled eggs are good.  Welcome to Texas cooking!!

This was my first time making a real "holiday" dressing. It was wonderful.I changed some of the spice proportions because a needed to make enough for 20 servings. I added spices to the cornbread to cut down on the sweetness, and also added more spices to the dressing itself. This is a real keeper. Will use this as my "go to" dressing recipe from now on.

I made this for 2001 Thanksgiving and for Easter 2002. It's my family's new dressing! They absolutely loved it and raved about it. One suggestion is to leave both breads in small pieces so it's not grainy. For the sausage, leave chunky..you'll taste it more.  This is a winner!

My family is so picky about their dressing, they will only eat it if it's simple and classic.  We all loved this recipe (thank God), and the family insists that I make it every year for Thanksgiving dinner.  It's perfect!

This was incredible!  It smelled heavenly while preparing and baking, and I could barely keep my husband out of the kitchen!  It put my mother in law's dressing to shame, and it was so good that she told me that I'm in charge of making the dressing from now on!  Now THAT'S a compliment!  There were NO leftovers, which was a dissappointment to many and a surprise to me, since I thought I had made quite a bit!  Thanks for a great recipe!  I didn't change a thing and won't!

Just made this on a test run before Thanksgiving next week.  I made the recipe pretty much as written. I did make homemade skillet cornbread cooked in bacon drippings. I put all of the dry seasonings into the cornbread mix. I didn't measure the seasonings but added each to personal taste. I used sage sausage instead of regular and french bread instead of white bread. Like other reviewers stated, I should have reduced the amount of broth. The texture came out too moist and grainy for my preference (but still tasted wonderful).  I baked it for 40 minutes covered then 20 minutes uncovered at 350 in a gas oven. After a small taste, it was still to wet so I put it back into the oven uncovered for an additional 20 minutes and increased the oven temp to 375. So, next week I will reduce the amount of butter from 1 cup to 1/2 cup, reduce stock to 2 1/2 to 3 cups and maybe use more french bread to cornbread ratio. Leave in the green pepper. I thought this was odd at first when I read it in the recipe, but if finely diced, they add so much flavor. Very good recipe. Thank you for the inspiration to deviate from our regular Thanksgiving dressing. This is my new favorite.

Being my FIRST Christmas to be the "grown up" and cook my own dinner for my family, I was very nervous that this would not taste like the one I grew up with. I was nervous about sausage being in there! I had never heard of it. The hubs is very picky but this recipe is great. I will use this every year from now on. Did not add green peppers. I doubled the spices... delicious!

*10 STAR DRESSING* I only used 2 cups of broth,which made the perfect texture.Sage sausage gives it a wonderful dressing flavor.I also used 1 TBSP of ground sage.I used a pone of home-made cornbread instead of the packs.The food processor is the key.It makes a VERY fine crumb(be sure to pulse some cornbread a few times & then add a few slices of white bread.took me about three times to do all the breads).Using an ice cream scoop makes perfect dressing balls.I love leftovers,unfortunately this was gone by Thanksgiving night.

I thought this recipe was terrific! No lie. I DEFINATELY agree on cutting back the chicken stock. I used 2cups plus a I made Cup of soup and drained the noodles ( i was low on stock!) I also added extra sage which helped the flavor. The sausage was quite tasty, I used italian turkey sausage it was a lot less fatty and a great addition to the thanksgiving spirit! i was nibbling at it right after it came from the oven! a great recipe!

I used less corn bread and more white bread so it wouldn't be as grainy.  Be careful not to mash pork to small when cooking, you want it alittle chunky.

I'm coming up on year #5 with this recipe - it's the only stuffing my family will eat so I make it at least 2 or 3 times per year.  My modifications are as follows: I DOUBLE the sausage!  It probably adds a gazillion calories but since there is so much left over, I'll pack just a small container of sausage to bring to work for lunch and it fills me up.  Last year I made a mistake and sauteed the vegetables with an extra stick of butter and it was a disaster so I look forward to 'making it up' to the family this year!

First time I made homemade stuffing and it was great! I will never make boxed stuffing again! I made the cornbread and cooked the sausage the night before to save cooking and clean up time, and it was perfect. I did omit the green pepper because I can't stand it in any dish, and this still was a hit.

This recipe is very good.  I used mushrooms instead of onions, and that worked out nicely.  It is hard to taste the sausage though, I may have to look for a more flavorful one.  I ended up only using 1 can of 14.5 oz chicken broth, and that was just enough.  Any more would be a puddle of dressing.  A little on the sweet side, I will follow the 'less cornbread, more whitebread' suggestion.  Thanks!

I used only ONE red onion (not as strong).  This is a really good SWEET dressing as I used a sweetened corn bread mix.  Watch how much chicken broth you use, I used the recommended amount & had to add some more toast & cornbread crumbs.

I also used turkey sausage in the spirit of Thanksgiving (turkey)!

I loved this recipe as did ask my guests, I added chopped mushrooms, I cooked the sausage in the oven while preparing mix and then food processed them with skin on because I had bought the wrong item, it was still delicious.

Cooked it for a bunch of people in Japan, Ausies, Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Finnish.. All loved it. Using a little extra meat doesn't hurt. Bake a 9x9 in. pan of cornbread and make sure it is fairly dry. You don't need a food processor.

I took BAMATT's suggestions of lowering the amount of chicken stock to 3 cups and upping the temp to 350. Even then, the dressing came out really mushy - which I don't mind, considering this is my first try at homemade dressing. I don't own a food processor, so I ended up tearing the slices to small pieces and using a hand mixer to combine both cornbread and white bread. I added a little of the chicken stock to the bread mix in order to make it easier to mix. My final verdict on this - it's awesome. My only conundrum at the moment is figuring out how to reheat it for tomorrow's official dinner...

This was very good!  I took another reviewer's advice and used 1 pckg jiffy cornbread, 1 packg cubbison's seasoned dressing, and 10 slices of white bread.  It was still mushy, so changes I will be next time will be to use 3 cups chicken stock instead of 4, and I would also omit the salt.  The ground pork sausage gives it a great flavor!

Big hit with the family! I made two pans but the first one seemed too mushy so on the second, I reduced the broth by 1/2 cup as others suggested and it turned out perfect. Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe!  I'll make again but I'll definitely add some tweaks.  I'm going to use maybe 1/2 cup less broth and instead of making the bread into itty bitty pieces, leaving some bite to it.  It turned out a bit like bread pudding.  The taste was incredible though!

My sister found this recipe here and used it to make the dressing for our family's Christmas dinner.  I thought it was a little bizarre while helping her make it because I had never heard of using bell peppers or sausage to make dressing.  I was incredibly surprised to find that this was the best dressing I have ever tasted in my life!  It was a lot moister than my mother's traditional dressing, and my sister said that was why she chose this recipe.  I'm so glad she did... and I will definitely be making this another time!  GREAT recipe!!!

This is now my official dressing recipe!  I was unsure of the sausage at first, but I found it adds flavor and interest without taking over the dish.  The fresh parsley and green pepper are wonderful.  I found it a little easier to use the bagged cornbread and bread dressings mixed together.  My six year old said I was the best cook ever and asked me to send this dressing in his school lunch!  Great recipe!

Stuffing/dressing has always been my favorite part of the holiday meal. This dressing is hands-down the best ever. I will never make anything but this. I had some day old can biscuits and substituted each for one slice of the bread. Also when making my cornbread, I added some sage and poultry seasoning to the batter and used Jimmy Dean sage sausage. Deelish!

My family enjoyed this recipe but it was our first using cornbread so the taste was new for us.  The texture is also a bit finer due to "processing" the bread.  My husband liked the taste but was used to a chunkier dressing.

I also cooked it in my crockpot as my oven broke on Christmas morning and it turned out fine!

This was my first attempt at making Thanksgiving dressing. My mother always had Thanksgiving at her house and made her traditional cornbread dressing. This year my husband and I had Thanksgiving at our house and I decided to try a recipe that was new so there were no expectations :) My whole family LOVED the dressing, it was not too mushy but just moist enough. My husband even said it was better than his mothers. Those are words I will always treasure and this will become our traditional Thanksgiving dressing for years to come.

I changed this a lot to suit our tastes, but the results were excellent!  Double if you are making for a large group.  We had 14 people and barely had enough dressing.  I left out the sausage, celery and bell pepper.  I added chopped hardboiled eggs instead of mixing them in.  Since we like our dressing sweet, I used two packages worth of Jiffy cornbread and just under 1/2 loaf of store-bought french bread.  Everyone loved this!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

We decided to try a new recipe for dressing on Turkey Day, I prepared this dish and after tasting it I agreed with other family members that the dressing was "okay" nothing special. If I was to make a change I would leave out the green peppers it doesnt go with the dish.

REALLY good.  My husband and son can't stop talking about this dressing.  Best we've ever had.  Mine was a little mushy after I added all the ingredients.  So I added a few more pieces of bread until it looked the right consistency.  Other than that....perfect!

I made this for my fellow teachers for last weeks Thanksgiving luncheon. I had never cooked dressing before but when your husband doesn't want you to take it to work because he is busy chowing down-- its gotta be great! So many compliments!!! Since I cooked for 40 people, I decided to use half "Jiffy" baked cornbread and pre-made cornbread crumbs. Since I don't own a food processor, I used cubed white bread crumbs and just hand crushed them. This recipe is my dressing go to. I  cant wait to cook this for my dad this week.

I had 10 people over for thanksgiving dinner and every one of them said this was the best stuffing they have ever had!  I used a bit more cornbread and a little less peppers and maple sausage.  Going to try it with chorizo for Christmas.

This was my first ever Dressing I have made and it turned out Perfect. I have had so many compliments on it. Thank you for sharing.  I have been making this wonderful dressing for 3 years now and The only tweaking that I ever do to this delicious dish is change up the serving size.  I go exactly by the ingredients.  Every time I make this, it gets eaten up.  Thank you Gloria and Louise for this wonderful tradition which I have now made.

I was looking for something Grandma used to make when I came across this recipe. Very close! The only thing I did different was that I made a skillet of cornbread from corn meal as opposed to the corn meal mix. Very good! I will be making this from now on. Thanks! :)

This turned out very good today for Thanksgiving. I went exactly by the recipe, except I cut back just a little on the herb seasonings. It was perfect, got many compliments. I used medium sausage, one pound, in my opinion it did not need more. I would've given this 5 stars, but feel that I can't since I cut back on the seasonings a little. I will be using this again for Christmas, it is definitely a keeper (I will always use a little less seasoning than called for, for me seasoning amounts listed are a little too strong, just my opinion). I used 4 cups of chicken stock as called for. I learned a long time ago, if you take a potato masher and mash and mix your dressing quite a bit before putting in pan to bake, your dressing texture turns out quite nice, just add the sausage after the mixing so it won't blend your sausage into mush. I baked exactly one hour at temperature called for and it was perfect.

Great dressing! I made it at Christmas. I used sage sausage, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It may seem moist when blended, but it cooks up perfectly textured. My family told me to cook this every year from now on!

Okay, so I am not a dressing lover, but my mother is.  I made this dressing for Thanksgiving, and my husband did the drunken head-bob when I asked him if he liked it.  For Christmas, I made it for my mother and raved about the flavor-she enjoyed it very much.  I, however, think it is too moist, almost soggy.  So the next time I make this I will omit about 1/4-1/2 cup of the broth.  I also cooked it at 350 for 1 1/2 hours (I have a gas oven).

Have always made my grandmother's tried and true stuffing recipe until trying this Holiday Dressing.  This stuffing was superb.  Used all of the ingredients except the green pepper and didn't bother with the fresh parsley, just sprinkled some dry parsley seasoning and it came out just fine.  Only used 2 1/2 cans of chicken broth.  My family really liked the taste and texture and I think it was the corn bread added to the white stuffing bread that added just a touch of sweetness to it.  Tried a similar recipe that I saw on Martha Stewart's show last year and that one could never compare to this..Will always use this one for "turkey day"......

Very good!  This recipe is a new tradition in our house.  Some picky eaters in the family and they all gave thumbs up.

simply deee-licious!!! This was my first stab at a "made from scratch" recipe, so I was very apprehensive about trying this one.. but the results were stunning! It was served for our christmas dinner, and it was very well liked. I agree to reduce the amount of stock to at least 3 cups.

This dressing was really good. My whole family loved it. I substituted ground pork for the sausage and used bouillon cubes for the stock instead of the canned stock. It was excellent. Can't wait to prepare this dressing in a turkey!

This stuffing didn't do so well in the turkey, but it did wonderfully when cooked on its own.  My husband isn't used to cornbread stuffing, but he liked this recipe.  I will keep it on hand to use again in the future.

Very delicious and moist.  Instead of using slices of bread, I crumbled 2 cups of Pepperidge Farm bread stuffing into the mixture instead, and next time I'll cut the sage down by half the suggested amount. But overall,this is a tasty and good recipe.  Will keep and will make again!

I use this recipe every year now! My entire family looks forward to this stuffing even over the turkey!! The only thing I do different is crumble the cornbread with my hands and tear bread into small pieces by hand. This makes for a fluffier stuffing although it is very time consuming to do this. Worth it though!!
I usually have to double or even triple the recipe for 7-9 people, because everyone goes back for seconds and expects to eat it again with leftover turkey the next day, lol!

I love the flavor of this stuffing, but it was incredibly mushy. Whether you use a cornbread mix or a cornbread recipe, DO NOT use a recipe that is sweet or the stuffing will be very sweet. Make sure your bread is either well toasted or stale before sending it through your processor. Be sure to add your broth slowly (1/2 cup at a time). When you're finished adding it all together, the mixture will be moist - not wet and certainly not soggy.

This is by far the best cornbread dressing I have had ever had.  I can't stop eating it! Instead of using boxed cornbread mix, I made the cornbread recipe from this site called 'Grandmothers Buttermilk Cornbread' it made all the difference.  I also used white wheat flour and an 8oz package of turkey sausage with a little olive oil just to make it a little healthier, instead of the pork sausage.  I'm sure it's even more amazing with the pork. It makes A LOT, so you can freeze some for later.

This was a rich, flavorful dressing, however I had a big challenge with its consistency.  Instead of  "mushy" my dressing was soupy, and I actually used 1/2 cup less stock.  I ends up baking it for 1-12 hours and butter was actually pooled on top.  It was very greasy.  If I make it again I will use half the butter and go way easier on the stock!

Excellent! Made this a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving as a test. Glad I did because I found out a few things. The cornbread should either be made from scratch or find a brand that does not use sugar. It was too sweet using the most popular cornbread mix. This type of dressing should not be sweet at all IMO. Also I chopped the celery too big. Another thing I discovered was the amount of chicken stock was dead on contrary to other reviews. I used a 32 ounce (4 cups) box of broth and it was perfect! The only thing I can think of that other reviewers are doing is not using enough bread. I use 16 slices of Butternut (keeping the crust) and had no problem at all with the dressing being soupy. It was moist and delicious. In sum, I would make my own cornbread with NO sugar in it. And chop the celery super fine via the food processor. And keep the stock at 4 cups. Doing this made my second batch pure heaven. My mom said it was better than hers and she was right (and I didn't think that was possible).

This was a favorite dressing recipe but I changed it by adding granny smith apples, and tripled the recipe which made much more than a 9x13 pan as stated in the recipe. I was able to fill 3/4 of the way to the top of a roaster pan for a 20 lb turkey, plus put 8 cups in my turkey. It fed our huge crowd. I used my own bread crumbs that I make the days before TG but everything else I do almost according to this. It is a good recipe to have for someone who is doing TG at their home for the first time and has never made Dressing.

Everyone with whom I have served or shared this recipe has RAVED about it. As Louise's son said, none other will do now! If you like Southern cornbread dressing at Thanksgiving or Christmas, this is what you are looking for. The only thing I change is less white bread - I usually only need about 10 slices to get the consistency I like.

I made this recipe last night. I went for my thyme and I was out! Followed the recipe other than the thyme and I have to tell you. This is THE BEST dressing I have ever tasted hands down even without the thyme. Can't wait for my friends to taste it! This will certainly show up again in my home.

You will NEVER look for another recipe again!  This is now requested by my husband, and his mother even begs for the recipe...but it is my secret!  The only substitution I made was to use sage sausage and extra sage ....otherwise PERFECT!!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

this stuffing was awesome!  I used store bought unseasoned bread crumbs and I did not add any salt.  The cornbread gave it just the right flavor and it wasn't dense like cornbread stuffings can be.  I also added a lot more herbs than called for to taste, and a little chopped fresh sage.  My friend was sitting in the corner with pan eating the leftovers after dinner was over!

I've used this recipe going on three years now. It is the BEST stuffing I've ever made. My family love it, we wouldn't think of having Thanksgiving or Christmas without it!! The only thing I do differently is I add a can of water chestnuts, it gives the moist stuffing a nice crunch!!

I found this recipe on this site about 4 years ago and now I make it every Thanksgiving. No matter who else is cooking, I have to have this stuffing to make the meal right.

OK, this is seriously the best dressing EVER!!  I have made it several times in the last 2 years since I read it.  I followed some of the suggestions by others like reducing the chicken stock by one cup, using Sage sausage (a must), and baking a little bit higher temp.  Your mouth will water once you smell this cooking in your oven!  I will never make dressing out of a box again!

Used this for Thanksgiving this year - it was great! Very pleased and I am so glad I did not leave out the bell pepper, it really added to it. I chopped it real small. I added a little more sausage than called for and used sage sausage. Thanks for a new staple!

SO GOOD!  Definitely recommend chopping up 1 granny smith apple and adding a few handfuls of dried cranberries although I know it would've tasted great without as well but it adds some color and just a little more sweetness.  Only bad thing: there were no leftovers.

This recipe was easy to use and allows one to be a little creative.  I used a little more cornbread and less white bread.  I tried some red bell peppers with the green and it tasted wonderful.  I also used a spicy sausage that gave it a little kick but wasn't too much.  Needless to say it is very popular!!

This has a really good flavor. The sausage really sets it apart. I did not put my bread slices in the food processor, I just tore them into small pieces. I like my dressing to be "chunky style"! I think next time I will only use a half cup of butter and 3 cups of chicken stock because it was a little too moist for my taste but overall it is an excellent recipe.

WOW!! This dressing was the hit of our large THanksgiving gathering at my church! I was skeptical because I've never liked sausage in dressing, and I'm used to my mom's southern cornbread dressing, but this was terrific! I used sage sausage. THe only change I'll make in the future is to use less salt, maybe 1/2. Also, make sure you don't use sweetened cornbread mix. I checked the ingredients on all the boxes at the store for no sugar. Hard to find! Thanks for this delectable recipe!

this recipe was time consuming and very oily. The sweetness of the cornbread in contrast to the other seasonings was awful. Would not use again.

This dressing got rave reviews at our Christmas dinner.  I only changed a few things instead of chopped celery I used celery flakes and instead of fresh parsley I used parsley flakes but it still turned out great.  Everyone loved it!!

This has wonderful flavor!  I only had sage sausage, so I just used that, and cut out the sage from the recipe.  I would also suggest cooking a bit longer than recommended, or maybe cooking at 350 instead of 325.  Mine came out a little soggy, but I cooked it for another 20 min and it was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was just "okay" to me.  It came out way too mushy. Perhaps I should have taken the recommendations of some of the other reviewers and reduced the amount of chicken stock to only 2 cups.  
I did make a couple of slight changes. Like others, I left out the bell pepper and I also used a sage-flavored sausage, which added a bit more sage flavor.
In the end, though, this tasted too much like Stove Top or other store-bought stuffing mixes. I'll continue to look for a better recipe.

yum!  this was very good and tasted just like my dad had made it.  I'm also a southern girl, and left the bellpeppers out.  Plus, I used 3 boiled eggs instead of cracking one raw egg over the mixture.  Yummy!

this is a wonderful recipe for dressing, it takes me back to when i was a child. only made a few minor changes to the recipe. first was to omit the green pepper as i feel it has no place in dressing. 2nd was to use sage sausage for extra flavor. i also cut the amount of sausage down to 1/2 pound and cooked it with a pound of ground round (takes on the sausage flavor and makes more drippings). i only used 1 onion and felt it was plenty and left out the parsley. the first time i tried this i chopped everything by hand and it took some time to do , but the next time i used my processor for chopping the celery and onion. when you warm the onion and celery mix through add the butter and all when putting it into the mix. this dressing will smell up your whole house and make you keep checking it to see if its done so you can nibble on it. took a double batch to work for a pot luck and everybody raved about it, a few wanted the recipe because they were going to switch from their recipe to this one. then i got the best compliment from a coworker on it, he said it tasted just like the dressing his grandmother used to make -now thats saying something!

I have cooked Turkey and Dressing for over 20 years and have never made my own from scratch.  I will never buy dressing again.  This was a huge hit with my family.  Easy, and very, very good.  I did however leave the bell pepper out, maybe just the southern in me.  Everyone loved it.

This stuffing is delicous!  It's so simple to prepare and it got rave reviews from guests over Thanksgiving!  I'm not sure why the recipe calls for so much chicken stock.  I used just 2 cups and eliminated the green peppers.  It was fabulous!

I was terrified of creating a dressing to match my mother-in-laws .. not only did I match it, but maybe beat it!!  Warning - Keep storage containers handy b/c this makes a LOT of food.  I always send some home with my holiday guests!

This stuffing was soooo moist!  It stayed moist through all the re-heating and 
it was never mushy.  Just right.  My husband loved it.  By the way, we don't eat 
pork so I used 1 lb. ground beef and seasoned it with chopped onions, garlic, 
salt, pepper, and sage.  It worked very well!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I cut the broth in half to avoid mushiness, and tore my bread up by hand.  I used two loaves of day-old French bread, made a box of jiffy cornbread, and supplemented with a few pieces of white bread.  I used fresh herbs.  There were lots of complements on the dish.

This is my new stuffing recipe. I am allergic to wheat so I made the cornbread from a gluten free mix and I made a gluten free Dutch oven bread- nice and crusty. I left both breads in chunks and let them become stale for a few days.  When I added the the stock to the bread chunks I let it stand for a while before deciding to add about another cup of stock.  I’m sure I had more bread than the recipe calls for simply because I have as making it from scratch and didn’t use the same exact breads. 
We LOVED it!  We had tons of leftovers which was great because stuffing is one of my favorite sides!  I used a little gravy to help moisten- I probably could have added another cup of stock before I  baked it- but when it was fresh it was perfect!

This dressing was not bad at all. It was not as popular as the dressing I made previously last Thanksgiving. In my opinion, it was a little too herb-y for my taste. If I were to make this again I would definitely lighten up on the herbs.

I tried this recipe at Thanksgiving for a large group of family members.  Most of the family liked it, but not better than the stuffing I usually cook.  I gave it one star because it tastes and smells like pizza, of which I am not a fan, especially at Thanksgiving.

Made this last night exactly as written, semi disappointed, I think just too much of a “cake” type texture versus old fashioned chunky stuffing/dressing

I have been looking for a stuffing recipe close to my grandmothers basic bread sausage stuffing/dressing which was my favorite on Thanksgiving and this one pretty much hit the mark and brought back very fond memories.  Thank you and this will be my go to dressing from now on.

This dressing was delicious!  It is the first time we almost ran out of dressing during dinner.  We had only a small scoop leftover.  The sausage and cornbread excited the guests who like those types of dressing, while the people used to a standard bread and herbs dressing enjoyed it too.  It was moist with a little crunch on top.  I made it a day ahead and then cooked it just before dinner.  This recipe is a keeper!

This dressing was delicious, and was a big hit with my family!!!  A really nice mix of herbs and spices, and not too dry or mushy. I do agree with the other reviews that it tastes like Stove Top stuffing. Next time I make this, I’m going to eliminate the cornbread. I really think it will change the flavor to something a bit different than the “box” flavor. But all in all, it gets four stars!!!!

Great recipe! As some of the other comments suggested, chicken broth is based on preference. I did the full 4, mixing in a 1/2 cup at a time. I enjoyed it, but will probably reduce to 3 cups next time. I also left out the pepper and added mushrooms instead. No food processor needed either. Just crumble cornbread with hand, make sure bread is stale or toasted and tear into chunks vs doing all crumbs. Came out great!

I was so excited to make this dressing due to the rave reviews. After making my homemade cornbread, keeping the white bread out overnight to dry up a bit and all the preparation that went into this dressing, I was highly disappointed in the result. I used 3 cups chicken broth instead of the recommended 4 cups. I also added an extra teaspoon of sage. There was not much flavor to this dressing. I’m not from the south, so maybe this is the typical “southern style” dressing and that’s where I went wrong. But I was expecting a more savory and traditional dressing. This was “meh” to me.

I’ve been making this for almost 20 years now because everyone requests it. Absolutely delicious!  The only difference is I usually cook it a bit longer cause we like it when the top is crunchy.

I prepared this as a side for Christmas Dinner, 2017. My wife was not a fan, primarily I think, because she did not expect sausage to be in dressing. The consistency of this dressing is not chunky since the food processor reduces the corn bread and bread to fine crumbs. If you prefer chunks of bread, take note to either avoid the food processor or just use it sparingly. I thought the flavor was excellent and if it were just me, would not hesitate to have it again.

My dad made this for Thanksgiving last year. I loved it so much that I made it for us this year. It takes a little more work, but make your own cornbread. Also, used dried bread crumbs instead of white bread and added a little more broth to compensate for that. Turned out wonderful! I have saved this in my favorites and will make it again.

This recipe may have secured my reputation as a good cook. Absolutely outstanding. Only change was to omit green pepper as we don't like it. Also for the white bread I used Kings Hawaiian bread. I prepared this the night before and baked as directed Thanksgiving Day,  Best dressing ever.

I made exactly as written and made the cornbread.  The stuffing was sweet which I did not care for and the cornbread gave it gritty texture.  Our family recipe uses cooled mashed potatoes instead of cornbread in our dressing.  I made again substituting 4 cups of crumbled and cooled mashed potatoes for the cornbread and it came out beautifully.  Followed everything else exactly and it was great.

Every major holiday my uncle is in charge of the stuffing (dressing for some of you) bc he does a stellar job. Well this Christmas Eve he couldn't be there so I was recruited. I knew I had big shoes to fill. Well this recipe was a home run! I added mushrooms, cut the broth to 3 cups as suggested by others and used sage sausage. Really awesome result!

This was my second time making dressing and it was quite tasty. I improvised on the sausage and used andouille sausage which made the dressing a bit oily. It did keep the dressing moist and gave it a nice flavor.  My family really liked it.

I'm old and I've been making Rhanksgiving dinner for many, many years and each year the dressing is a challenge for me but this year it cooked well and came out perfect with this recipe,  I just changed a couple things. I added two boxes of Dromedary muffin mix (baked) and sautéed the onions and celery in butter. Really, really good!

This is pretty good.  I actually liked it much better a couple days later.  I used my own homemade light oat bread and I just tore it into pieces and left it out overnight.  I reduced the recipe to 4 servings, which created some problems with scaling!  I think it turned out fine anyway.  I doubled the seasoning called for and mine needed more chicken broth than called for.  I suggest just adding a little at a time until it's the consistency you want .

Solid bread dressing recipe. Spices, amounts of broth, egg, spot on. I cut the sausage and used a combo of cornbread and bread Mrs. Cubbisons. I added sliced black olives as a personal preference and for contrast.

This will be my go to recipe from now on. Based on reading reviews I did cut back on the chicken broth to about 3 cups. I also don't own a food processor and just cubed up the bread. I took the cubed bread and toasted it on a baking sheet in the oven for a few minutes. Absolutely delicious!!

I used 2 c of chicken stock instead of 4 based on comments I read from others. I used pkge of cornbread, cut into 1/2 in cubes and dried in oven at 350 for about 20 mins, and one pkge of potato bread cubes.  I drained the veggie mixture a bit after cooking as it seemed like too much liquid. I baked it at 350 for about 1.30. It was moist but not soggy.

Great recipe!  I picked up Andouille sausage by mistake (I was apparently very distracted at the store), but decided to use it anyway.  WOW!!  The flavor and texture of this dressing was amazing, but the andouille spice just added to it.  It wasn't overwhelmingly spicy, either - just a nice additional zing.  I left everything else exactly as it is in the recipe.  Brought this to the office Thanksgiving potluck, and it was a huge hit.  Thank you!

(For the andouille sausage version, use a cornbread mix that isn't sweet.  Bob's Red Mill's cornbread mix is great for this.)

This was the first time I've ever  made dressing, and made as recipe directed, only I had to use Turkey Sausage instead of Pork.  It turned out ok.  Looked pretty, but wasn't anything like Grandma's Chicken base dressing, so was thumbs down for me.     Grandma set the bar fairly high, lol.

I rarely make stuffing because it is difficult to get the blend of flavors I am looking for.  This was amazing.  Better than any stuffing I have ever had.  I don't need to have someone else bring the stuffing because now I have this.  I made 8 servings of it and used about 4-5 cups of cornbread and 4-5 cups of regular bread.  I do not have a food processor so I just cut the bread into small cubes. Took no time at all.  Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter and it was wonderful

really good.  used only 3C of broth and sage sausage as others indicated.  also, used 2 packets of cornbread and 1/2 the white bread.  made it faster by chopping everything in food processor to saute then using it to mix seasonings, eggs, and some broth (all of it would spill over).

Excellent dresssing, this is the only recipe I will use from now on.  I used red peper instead of green as we prefer the flavor of red and also it gave it a nice color.  I used two pouches of Martha White corn bread mix, made with buttermilk.  This is more than the recipe called for but it was outstanding.

This was Amazing...  I've been searching for a recipe that reminded me of the dressing my Grandma used to make.  She's gone now and I never got the recipe but remembered things about it and this sounded like what I remember.  Turns out it's spot on...  I did use extra sage sausage and upped the sage called for to 1T...  it was just a little wetter than ideal so I will probably cook a little longer or higher temp or both next time but a definite keeper... :)

I'm not a fan of anything boxed so I would leave out the cornbread mix and use less chicken stock. Great template recipe to adjust to my own tastes. I also added diced apple and golden raisins and roasted pecans. Next time I would chop up the sausage after cooking. No need to use all that butter, I just sauteed my veg in the sausage pan. I used 2 cups of stock. IMO parsley isn't needed either. 5 stars with these edits.

This dressing is a WINNER! It's not just for holidays, it'll easily compliment any night when turkey or ham is the main dish. I did substitute the green bell pepper for a yellow one because no one in my family likes the green ones (including me), and it lacked nothing. It's moist (unlike many other dressing/stuffing recipes) and the flavors blend together so well in your mouth that you'd swear you were eating in a restaurant. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!

This recipe is a good start, but if following the recipe exactly, I would rate it a 3-4 star recipe...it's too soupy, and not nearly enough cornbread or flavor.  I've made some changes to turn it into a 5 star recipe.  In fact, with these changes, this is by far the best stuffing recipe I've ever had!  Modifications: 1) Crumble and use 1lb of cornbread. 2) Reduce bread to 8 pieces (I prefer sourdough bread). 3) Use 1 onion, 5-6 celery stalks, and 1 green pepper very finely chopped.4) Cut butter to 1/2 cup. 5) Increase sage to 1 Tbsp, 6) Use sage sausage 7) Cook at 350. 8) Reduce to 1.5 to 2 cups of stock. 8) Add 2-3 hard boiled eggs.

Great recipe! Okay, I made some changes because I rarely if ever follow a recipe verbatim. I added some leftover pureed pumpkin from my a homemade pumpkin pie, some dried cranberries and I made my cornbread and bread from scratch. But the foundation of my dressing remained true to this recipe. Thanks!

Good, but the second batch I also added 1/2 a red pepper, finely diced. And did 10 slices of bread with a crushed bag of seasoned croutons. Even better.

I made this last Thanksgiving, and my in-laws are already asking if we're having it again this year.  It's a little labor intensive, but worth every minute.  I prepped everything the night before then combined the ingredients and cooked it the day of.  Worked beautifully.

Wonderful recipe. Almost the same way I make mine. I omit the bell pepper, use 1 bag Pepperidge farms dry corn bread mix and 1 bag dried cubed white bread crumbs. Saves time and has seasoning in both. Only 1 egg because 2 seems to make recipe a little gummy.

Perfect dressing for Thanksgiving. I use homemade cornbread and homemade whole wheat bread instead of the cornbread mix and white bread. Tastes amazing!

I cheated and used boxed chicken broth, and Italian sausage instead of plain pork sausage.  It came out great!!  Again, I made this for my first attempt at cooking Thanksgiving for combined family, and scored very well!  Everyone, even the family chefs asked for take home plates!!

We love this, and the family requests it every year at the holidays. Even my husband's family who said they don't like dressing loves it.  I had originally tried this recipe because it sounded very similar to the dressing my granny used to make. I make just a couple changes, based on how she did hers- I use half beef and half chicken broth, and instead of white bread slices, I use half a loaf of Italian bread.

I have been making this recipe for years.  It is the only dressing I make for the holidays.  The only changes I make is leaving out the green pepper and I use dried parsley.  My daughter wants me to make it for her on her birthday every year.   It is the best!!  Have served many with this and everyone loves it!!!

This recipe was fantastic and everyone loved it!!!!!! This is my second time making it.  The only change I made was the cornbread.  My family is from Mississippi and Alabama and I did not make it from scratch, I would be shunned...lol.

This stuffing is excellent!!! I added mushrooms and used 3 cups of chicken stock instead of 4. Even my extremely picky toddler ate it! Takes alot of prep work but its so worth it in the end.

i give this 4 stars becuase the end result is a little greasy and a little mushy.  reduce the butter and broth. maybe drain the sausage. add more sage...maybe use fresh herbs next time.  other than that, a real crowd pleaser!

I have to say, I printed this recipe out 2 or 3 years ago now. It is a huge hit in my family. I am requested to make it at both Thanksgiving and Christmas. Thanks so much for this recipe. Like some others, I have only modified it by using a little less stock. It is so good!

Normally my mother or great aunt would prepare a southern dressing for family holiday gatherings but I decided to do it myself in 2005.  I printed the recipe out a couple of days before Thanksgiving and my mom was a little skeptical when I told her about it but it was a total hit with everyone; even my mom!  I make it every year now.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I used it for Thanksgiving this year, and it was gone in a second! I had to double it for requests for Easter and a potluck.  It takes a little bit of time to prepare, so I prepare it the night before and throw it in the oven the next morning. This is definitely the dish that will be raved over!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone absolutely loved it. I have been told I have to make it every year, and not just for holidays. Based on some of the suggestions  from the other reviews, I used 3 cups of chicken stock and sage sausage. It was so delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Great recipe Everyone liked it!  I took the advice from other people and only used 1 can (14 oz) of sodium free chicken broth and it was perfect. When I chopped the onions and celery (very small chunks) with melted butter it came out a little runny so that may have helped with the liquid in the recipe.  Also, I omitted the green pepper and only used 1 onion.

I received this compliment: "This is the first dressing I've ever had that I liked." I was going to skip the green pepper but at the advice of another review I kept it in and after tasting, I understand why. It is not a strong pepper taste after cooking down but just adds that little something. This is MY holiday stuffing recipe from now on.

Great recipe.  I have made this 3 times now, and it's always a hit.  I used light Jimmy Dean sausagae the last time and it was just as good.  We have made this recipe a regular on the holiday menu.

Fantastic dressing. Lots of prep work, but it really is a special dish that is worth the effort. I used the modifications suggested by BAMATT (posted 10/31/05) and thought they helped avoid mushiness quite well.

My first time making stuffing w/o the box.  This recipe was perfect from beginning to end.  I used the bell pepper- it was fine. Changed the sausage to apple turkey sausage(from whole foods market) and upped the oven to 350.  It was the best!!!!

I modified this recipe only slightly.  I used dried parsley IPO fresh.  I used Hillshire Farms smoked sausage and ground it up in the food processor.  I used a small can of green chili peppers IPO the fresh green pepper.  I used a can of condensed cream of celery soup IPO the fresh celery.  I baked at 350-degrees for an hour.  This dressing can be a casserole main dish all by itself.  There are never any leftovers and the house smells great when it's cooking!

Made this instead of my usual Stove-Top stuffing for this years dinner.  It tasted a little mushy to me but that is my personal opinion.  No one complained...so all in all it was okay.  Thanks for sharing.

I talked my Mom into letting me make the dressing this year and everyone was so glad I did.  It was wonderful!  My Mom's dressing had over powering flavors.  This dressing had wonderful flavors that tasted just right.

So, this was our first time hosting Thanksgiving, and I was looking for just the right recipe for dressing, so I found this one, and boy was it perfect. The only change I made was use orange bell pepper in substitute of green and it was terrific! Using the sausage really added a great taste and texture. I was quite suprised.This is the only dressing I will be making from now on.

This is by far the best dressing ever.  I was cooking for 20 people so I used 18 oz. of cornbread mix without changing the other ingredients.  It turned out awesome.  I omitted the bell pepper though, since I'm not a big fan of it.

I made this recipe for this year's Thanksgiving Holiday.  My family raved about it.  It was delicious.  From now on, this is the dressing we will have each Thanksgiving.  It's excellent!

This will definitely be a tradition in my home.  Absolutely delicious, moist, and a real hit with everyone.  I added garlic and used jalapeno cornbread, which gave it a little zip.  Really good!
