So in my search for satisfying "diet" food, I wanted new salads to eat. This is soooo flavorfull and yummy, I actually crave it every week. I would reccomend OMITTING the salt. It is plenty salty enough using the soy sauce. I would also recommend slicing (very thin) your cabbage rather then buying the pre bagged stuff. It adds more flavor and juiciness. I also add my dressing right to my bowl of salad right before I eat it.I am going to start using Braggs liquid amino acids. It has 1/3 of the sodium then soy sauce and is actually good for you and tasts the same. Look for it in the health food section by the cider vinager.PLEASE, PLEASE make this. You wont be sorry! I make it at least 2 times a week, and I am not sick of it yet! Also, add the cilantro righ to the dressing, otherwise it stick to the sides of the bowl instead of being"IN" the salad. Enjoy friends. I know you will love it.

Really good and satisfying.  I tried to make this recipe according to the directions, then realized I didn't buy the red peppers so subbed carrots, which were good, but I think the recipe as written would be even better.  Still, it was a 5 star recipe.  Use natural peanut butter if you can-it really is easier to work with and tastes more like peanuts.

Wonderful!  Made this for a gathering this past Saturday and everyone went nuts for it.  I, too, used the natural peanut butter.  I also used aged tamari soy sauce which has much more flavor than the standard supermarket brands.  This was served with sliced pork tenderloin and was the perfect accompanyment.  Will make this one again and again.  Also, followed everyone's advice and made this the morning of my event instead of an hour before.  The longer it sits the better!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this fou times in two weeks from the cabbage in my garden. It is so good as a side dish for pork dishes and is also a nice change from the standard coleslaw recipes.

Wow!  This is so good....I made this but used a bag of coleslaw mix, about 4 cups.  Cut the dressing ingredients in half.  I didn't hve the bell peppers.  I used a handful of match stick carrots, no cilantro or sesame seeds (personal taste).  My friend came of to taste test it with me and we both loved it.  I sent 2/3's  of it home with her because my husband won't eat cabbage.  She called later to tell me her mother loved it too.  Now I don't have enough fo myself.  No prob though, it is so easy to make.  I'll just make another half batch and keep it all to myself!  Thank you so much Dawn, for the new addition to my reipe box.  This will be going with me to the next pot luck dinner.  I'm sure there will be lots of guests wanting the recipe.

I usually make the Angie's dad's coleslaw on this site, but this is a lovely change.  Nice asian flavors.This was very tasty.  I did not have chives or sesame seeds.  I added 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and a tablespoon of splenda & a couple of teaspoons of lime juice.  I hope it holds up for tomorrow. if it does, I will give it 5 stars;)

I am a huge fan of both coleslaw and peanut butter but this slaw was not one of my favourites. It was too peanutty and just didn't have the crisp freshness of traditional mayo coleslaw. I'm still on the hunt for a more nutritious coleslaw!

This was absolutely delicious and pretty easy to make. I added more hot sauce and omitted the salt.

I was really excited about this recipe since I like all the ingredients it calls for, but boy was this disappointing.   I had some fresh cilantro that I did not realize had gone bad so I omitted this from the original recipe.  Maybe that's what it was missing? It just tasted really really salty and very boring.  My husband and I even tried it the next day to see if the flavors had developed but it was still not very good.  I have no plans to try this one again but if you want to go for it, I would strongly advise tasting before adding any salt.

I was looking for a cabbage recipe to use up the cabbage I had. I did a few things differently due to personal taste (cilantro tastes like soap to me so I didn't use it, I don't like things too salty so I omitted the 1/2 tsp. of salt), but otherwise followed the recipe. Tasty! I almost felt like the sauce was missing something, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. But I would make it again as-is!

If you don't like peanut butter or cilantro, you should not make this recipe.  It tasted pretty good, but you couldn't eat a lot of it.

If I could give this 500 stars I would. I despise mayo in any way, shape or form so when I came across this recipe I just had to try it. Hubs and I love it. LOVE IT. It goes especially well alongside some spicy ribs. I don't use cilantro as I'm not a fan, but do everything else as written. I've tossed in other shredded veggies as well to use them up: broccoli, carrots, cauliflower and it still is great. THANK YOU Dawn for this recipe.

This was fantastic! I cut back on the cilantro due to personal preferences and added some fresh ginger.  I also used a combination of red and green cabbage - maybe 1 part red to 2 parts green - and it was a very pretty dish!

The dressing on this is fabulous.  It gets even better on the next day.  I did change the ingredients in the salad because of necessity, but I followed the dressing recipe exactly and it was perfect.  It reminded me of thai food, and it was a great change from regular mayo-based coleslaw.

I really liked this recipe and thought it was a great alternative to the mayo-based coleslaws.  I took it to a family gathering of about 20 people and most of them turned their noses up at it so I'll be making it just for myself in the future! 
NOTE: I, too, upgraded this to 5 stars after letting it sit for the flavors to blend.  I think it takes a bit to get used to for people who are expecting a more traditional coleslaw flavor, but this one is highly addicting! I've made it several times since finding the recipe.  Thanks!

Although I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I'm still sure it's worth 5 stars and even more.  I hate mayo based coleslaw, and love peanut sauces. So this was perfect. I needed a salad dressing using rice vinegar and peanut butter and found this.  I didn't have cilantro, chives or red bell peppers, so I actually used pico de gallo and it worked wonderfully. I used the sauce on baby spinach and topped with the sesame seeds. I will definately make this again, next time using cabbage. But I think I will keep using pico de gallo to avoid the work of chopping the veggies!

Excellent flavors...exotic combination!  That being said I modified it a little.  I doubled the hot sauce, used reduced sodium soy sauce, only used one red bell pepper and 5 cups vs 8 cups of shredded cabbage.  Delightful :-)  I'll definitely make this one again!

Quite good. Company enjoyed it. I dumped the general ingredients in without measuring a whole lot. Hard to mess this one up. A nice change from mayo-based coleslaw, and Weight Watchers Friendly! (1 point per serving)

**Pot Luck Success** We had a Tahiti/Polynesian theme potluck at work and this cole slaw was well received.  I was so impressed with the flavors and I don't even like peppers...but gobbled them up in this recipe.  One person already asked for the recipe!  Thanks Dawn!  ~~best of all I now have a recipe for a fantastic Asian Peanut spicy dressing.  WOW!

Very tasty...  I added some diced up boneless skinless chicken breast and made a meal out of it by adding fruit salad on the side.  It didn't quite feed our family of 7, though, even with adding the 4 chicken breasts.

I was skeptical about this recipe, but so good and different!  Needed to add more cabbage & celery, as the sauce is a pretty strong flavour. Delish!!

The vinegar taste was too strong.  We all took a few bites and then moved on to the other dishes- never to return.

This recipe is delicious.  I do not usually like cabbage or traditional coleslaws, but I will eat this.  We recently served the coleslaw at a dinner party, and no one could get enough.  Outstanding.

We though this was ok but didn't taste good until I added some sugar...  Not bad, just not what I was looking for!

This was good but I wasn't "wow"ed by it. I needed a side dish for a Polynesian / Tiki themed party and this fit the bill. For overall taste and everyday menus, though, think I'll stick to traditional coleslaw.

I originally gave this 3 stars, but am now upgrading it to 4 after the coleslaw had about 2 hours to hang out. Note: I did not have chives, red pepper, or sesame seeds and I added the juice of one lime and about 1/2 tsp. honey to perk it up a little.  I used a natural peanut butter that doesn' have any added sugar, so that may have made a difference in the taste/texture.  My hubby said he'd like to have this again.  I am happy to find a lower fat/higher protein coleslaw recipe!

This is a great alternative to the heavy mayonnaise-coleslaw.  I used green bell peppers instead of red (which was also good) and I toasted the sesame seeds before I mixed them in.

(I used a Chinese rice-based cooking wine I've had forever, red onion instead of the chives, and left out the red bell peppers.  I also used natural peanut butter which is not as thick and unmanageable.)
This was great, and my husband loved it as he loves most savory things.  I was actually looking for something with a sweetish tang to it, and when I actually made it realized there wasn't anything sweet in it, but it was still delicious, and I love finding recipes with so few calories and fat in them that are still so tasty.  I think you could adapt the ingredients with a little brown sugar and honey for a sweeter dressing.

This is addictive! Definitely leave out the salt. I use all natural crunchy peanut butter and don't bother with the sesame seeds.

This was a great change to the standard creamy coleslaw. No salt needed, due to the Bragg's Liquid amino (soy sauce) that i used.  I also used no salt organic peanut butter.  Also, substituted what i had on hand, which was white wine vinegar, but it still was great!

This coleslaw turned out really well with my Thai themed dinner and had to add a little water to thin out the mixture. I only had champaign vinegar but it worked out fine.  Overall, a great alternative to the average mayo slaw.

me and my boyfriend loved this slaw! I was never a fan of traditional coleslaw so I decided to give this one a shot. The flavors go great together, and I'm going to make it again for a family reunion! I followed the recipe to a T.

DELICIOUS! I did not have peppers or chives.  I used minced white onion, shredded carrot and bean shoots. Next time I will add a can of black beans to make it a hearty lunch!

Nice recipe.  Perhaps even better on the second day.  I did not add the salt and it was perfect; I think it would have been too salty with both the salt & the soy sauce.

I also use Bragg's liquid aminos instead of soy sauce.  So much less sodium--same great taste.  I added some crushed pineapple.  How can you have a polynesian flavor without pineapple?  It turned out very well

I absolutely loved this recipe and it doesn't have any mayo in it.

I've made several times.  Didn't change a thing.

Didn't care for the combination of flavors.I can appreciate a coleslaw with reduced fat but I will stick with a mayonaise based slaw.

This was tasty. I didn't have any red bell peppers so I used red pepper flakes and added soem shredded carrots for cruch. I used a powedered peanut butter product to cut the calories and fat back. I think next time I'll add some broccoli slaw to this as well as more red pepper flakes and some salt.

This was delicious!  I also used natural peanut butter, so I added approx. 1 tbsp of honey to increase the sweetness.  I also left out the chives, but I didn't really miss them.  Finally, I used a bagged cabbage mix that contained carrots; they really added to the coleslaw's texture, flavor, and color.

Super easy to prepare and even better tasting knowing it's healthier than normal slaw! :-) I used a bag of preshredded coleslaw and it was that much faster! Will make again.
