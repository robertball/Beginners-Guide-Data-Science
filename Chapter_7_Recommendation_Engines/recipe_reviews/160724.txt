Submitter here!  I'm glad you like the recipe.  I entered that the cayenne should be "to taste", so please forgive the spiciness, as that part did not go through.  Add as much or as little as you like.  Cayenne does not add much flavor, but only heat.  Substituting smoked paprika for the cayenne would be great for those of you sensitive to heat.

I am usually not a fan of brats but these were so good!  Someone made them for a potluck at work and I will be making these myself soon!  The sweetness of the brown sugar was just right.

This was great!  I used two cans of beer instead of three and that was plenty. It was a little spicy for my 6 and 4 year old so next time I'll cut the cayenne pepper in half.  Great alternative for brats!

These were GONE in the first pass at the church pot luck! I made 3 changes: After cooking in root beer, I cut the bratwurst into about 5 bite sized pieces then tossed them in the brown sugar mixture before wrapping them in bacon. Dee-lish!

good, you loose a little flavor if reheated or made a day ahead of time. Make same day and keep warm in crock pot

Wow! I took this to a Superbowl Party. It was the first thing gone! Everyone wanted the recipe. I was thinking it would be a good guy appetizer, but the ladies loved it too. Will make for the next gathering for sure.

My husband loved this recipe and has asked for it again after only one week. I will decrease the cayenne simply because I felt it was too spicy for me and our 2 year old. They turned out perfectly cooked and full of flavor.

I substituted apple juice for the beer, as I am a recovering alcoholic and it's suggested that people like me just stay away from it all together. Tasted GREAT! I used low-sodium bacon and Splenda Brown Sugar. Turned out absolutely great! My grandmother parked herself right by the table and ate most of them. I would highly recommend this

This was OK.  It is easy to prepare and is a good way to enjoy brats without having to grill them up (I do not enjoy grilling).  Also perfect for those days when you are craving grilled fare, but the weatehr is not condusive to outdoor cooking.  Next time (if I decide to make these again - my bf thought they were just "OK" as well), I'd double the cayenne as I couldn't taste it at all.  I will also make a mustard dipping sauce for the brats (just seemed as if something were missing...)  Serve with German potato salad on the side.  Overall a neat idea for cooking bratwurst.  Thanks!

10 stars, minimum! After making these several times, I've found that two beers are plenty - why waste beer?!! :)  I've had good luck using center cut bacon...the strips aren't as wide and they fit perfectly on the individual pieces.  It's easier and quicker to mix the brown sugar and cayenne in a medium-sized container with lid, throw in several of the assembled pieces and give the container a few good shakes.  I cover a broiler plan in foil, put slits in the foil in several places to allow the grease to drain AND spray the foil with Pam.

Fantastic appetizer, thanks for posting - but I have to say I'm flabbergasted by all the people complaining that this is too hot for their children... The brats are perforated, submerged in beer, brought up to the boil in beer, and simmered - in beer - for 15 minutes - and the biggest concern some have is that they're spicy?  Check Wikipedia, "Cooking with alcohol" - there's a chart that indicates that food simmered for 15 minutes WITH alcohol retains 40% of the alcohol content - I have to think this is going to be higher ... Again, a great snack - for adults ...

Great recipe. My girlfriend and I loved it, she was skeptical about the beer boiling but she didn't mind after wards.  The only thing I will do differently next time is I'll dip just the bacon, on both sides, with brown sugar and then wrap it. Makes it much easier to coat and gives a better flavor.

Wow... what can I say?  This is just about as good as it gets.  Pork on pork, pure perfection.  I did them exactly as the recipe calls with the exception of skewering them like kabobs on bamboo skewers.  We have bratwurst in the freezer and I said something about this recipe since it was the one we used the last time we had bratwurst.  My husband said "that was the best thing I've had in a long time".  He likes to eat and will say something is good, but he rarely makes those type of statements.  The sweetness of the brown sugar and the spicy cayenne with the salty bacon.  Wow, that just about sums it up.  I used Wright's Applewood Bacon, very thick, may have been the final touch to this outstanding dish!  You have to try it!

I've made this for a New Year's party and an office potluck; both times I was not able to have any of it because it was gone so quickly.  Each time, I prepared these treats as written, but placed them in a large crockpot to keep warm.  As far as I've been told, they are delicious, but I'm going to have to make a batch for myself to see what all of the fuss is about.

Great recipe! Have made this recipe dozens of times and it is a family favorite as well as a company favorite. I omit the toothpicks by placing the bacon seam side down. Also, works just fine on a cookie sheet (covered with foil for easy clean up).

These are great! Made them for the Super Bowl.  I made a pkg of 5, so 15 pieces total.  I cooked for 25 minutes, but needed to cook longer to get the bacon crispier.  I will add more cayenne next time.  THEY SET OFF MY SMOKE ALARM! so be warned, and use your exhaust fan!

I made this for an Octoberfest party and it was a huge hit!! I of course made more then the recipe called for because I knew they would go fast :) I like things spicy so it worked for me but I am sure this would be good with out the CP. I cooked the brats in the morning and put them in the fridge until I was ready to assemble and cook. It did take a while to do that but it was worth the time. This recipe was delish and I will definately make it again.

I used 2 Octoberfest beers and threw in a half an onion for flavor.  I also added water to cover the brats (I made 3 lbs). For my family I cut the cayenne by half and it was just enough heat.  I rolled them in the sugar cayenne mixture but didn't cake it on.  I also did a few in a mix of brown sugar and cracked black pepper for my 5 and 3 yr olds.  Also made "Warm Dijon Potato Salad" from this site (also modified a tad).  Great dinner!

I like some of the other reviews I read had the same problem, of this dish being the first to go at the Super Bowl party we just went to!!!  It was so good, got a TON of compliments!!!  The only complaint was that I didn't make enough!!!  I've already gotten requests for this at the next potluck.......Only downfall, is that my house still smells like bacon, but some might not think that's such a bad thing!  Thanks for sharing!

I think my boyfriend loves me a little bit more after making these. Men love bacon, beer and brats, so this is the perfect combination to make a man happy. I must say, I enjoyed as well. Thanks for sharing!

Everyone raved about  how good these were. I thought they were just ok. I used two packs of brats, cut them in four pieces, dipped in 1 cup brown sugar mixed with 1 TBS cayenne pepper, and wrapped each in 1/2 piece bacon. Baked 35 min.

This was FANTASTIC! I served this as a main dish, left the brats whole. I used apple cider to boil the brats in instead of beer, then rolled the brats into the brown sugar mixture, then wrapped with 1 slice of thick cut hickory smoked bacon and cooked on a broiler sheet for about 25 minutes (turning over half way through cooking). My husband and son absolutely LOVED these. We served them on buns with various flavors of mustard and BBQ, though they really didn't need anything extra. They were wonderful. I will definitely make these again.

I fixed this for a annual UK verus UL football party and it  was a huge HIT, they where all eaten up quickly. Will try it using turkey brat wrapped with turkey bacon the next time.

This is a very simple, yet delicious, recipe. Made as is was excellent. I saw no need to change it when I made it those few times, though it is simple enough that you can add almost anything that suits your fancy, such as different peppers or seasonings. Whatever ends up floating your boat.

Any stadium brat works here, even precooked. The key is wrapping in bacon and rolling in the brown sugar, dry mustard and Creole powder instead of cayenne.BIG HIT

This is a great recipe..I have made something similar, but I only use 1 bottle of beer, which is plenty and I cook the brats 10 minutes on each side and they are done..I buy pre-cooked bacon, it works great with brats and shrimp!

I used turkey brats and substituted paprika for the cayenne.  I also sauteed onion and garlic in a bit of butter in the skillet before adding the beer and brats for a bit more complexity.

Let me say this.  My whole family loves it!  I do double the brown sugar batch to load them up.  Very tasty.  Will never get sick of this recipe.  Started at the Super Bowl and now have it as a meal all the time.  Great Recipe.

I tried this recipe for our company Christmas (finger food) potluck.  It was the star of the meal.  There were no leftovers and I had several emails when I returned from lunch from the men in our department asking me for my recipe.  Many of them are hunters and very heavy meat-eaters.  They just loved them.  SO easy to make and the best bratwurst recipe we have ever tasted outside a Gasthause in Germany.

The men in my life loved these...boiled in beer, how could one go wrong. I simply added a large bottle of medium dry hard cider and covered the brats with beer afterwards...I did half with cayenne, half without and they both turned out delicious

A little tedious but very good. We use less cayenne because it seemed too hot.

This was so good!  I served it up with pan-grilled red potatoes and broccoli.  I dipped every few bites in some Dijon mustard.  I left out the cayenne and used black pepper instead.

I have made this recipe 10+ times in the last 3 years! My husband asks for it all the time and is always a hit at pot luck dinners or when we have guests over. Out of the different beers we've tried, Guineas Blonde has had the best turnout!

I reduced the cayenne to 3/4 tsp. Still very spicey but we like spice.   My husband liked them but the rest of us did not. The beer flavour was very strong and I only used 2 cans of mild beer. Overall I would not make these again. If you love beer flavour,  you may enjoy them

This recipe was fabulous! I used apple juice instead of beer and cut down on the pepper so my granddaughter would eat them. I made 5 brats as that's what was in the package. My hubby said he could eat all of them they were so good! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was amazing. I made for a couple clients and they loved them. I used a whole piece of bacon though. This was fabulous.

These were good, but a little too spicy for my guests.  I cut back on the cayenne pepper by a little, and next time I will only add half.  I also ended up cooking them too long, but that was not the recipes fault, it was my own for not checking them at 25 minutes.

This was very good! This will be great for parties, football games etc. I used mustard for dipping. a great compliment to the very subtle sweetness of the brown sugar. A keeper recipe.
Thank you for sharing : )

Delicious! I've brought them as an appetizer to parties 3 different times, and each time they were gobbled up!  I used smoked paprika instead of cayenne.  I also used apple brats I got at the butcher.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly as written.  Very very good.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh my goodness, these were fantastic!!   Followed recipe as written, but  added a bit of smoked paprika.  They were a bit spicy, but that's something we enjoy, so add cayenne to taste.  We used Coors Light because that's what we had on hand.   I could taste the beer, but my husband could not.  Next time may follow other reviewer's suggestion and use apple juice or apple cider or a darker beer.

I followed other's advice and cut back on beer and cayenne. I used two blueberry brats, one can of Stella, about a 1/4 tsp of cayenne, and 3 tbsp of brown sugar. I ended up throwing away some of the sugar/cayenne mix, so I could have reduced both by a third and been fine. I also cut the brat into 6 pieces and they were still huge bites. Granted, my brats were pretty big. Excellent recipe! Will be making again soon for gatherings and just for dinner for hubs and I.

I used enough water to cover the brats and added one can of beer (and drank one as well). I allowed the brats to soak in the beer mixture for 15 minutes before removing to cool. I also substituted the cayenne for smoked paprika which made a world of difference flavor wise. I am making them again as I'm typing this review to take to a tailgate party. Enjoy!

Made these for a Christmas party and they were a hit. I impressed everybody and when it comes to potlucks it's fun to be the only one leaving with a clean dish. the beers I used were 2 dark pilsners and a couple of ambers. Turned out really well, definitely use thin bacon or it won't cook all the way and have the desired texture.

These were easy to make and a crowd favorite!  The only thing I altered was adding a little garlic to the brown sugar and cayenne.  I cooked them at home then threw them in the oven at the party to warm & crisp them up. They leave a little warm tingle in the back of your throat and are full of flavor!  I'll definitely make them again.

unbelievably easy and great tasting treat. easy to prepare and make away from home at a friends house. Definitely prep up earlier in the day and bake fresh out of the oven. a couple of choices of dips add to the intense flavor. make sure you bake on a rack easier to take off. You gotta try these!!

I have made this 3 times and that's because my friends can't get enough of them. I do cut cayenne in half and make 15 at a time. I also made the mustard sauce in someones earlier comment and they definitely are good together. Next time I will be using my smoker to make them. Thanks for a great recipe !

I made this once before but couldn't find any brats for some reason but it was pretty good with a substitute (unfortunately it was a precooked sausauge so the beer flavour didn't really get into it).  This time I made it with real uncooked brats and cooked them on a rack like the recipe called for.  Oh my!!!  Amazing.  My only thing is more cayenne or maybe my cayenne is getting a little old.  Regardless it is so worth making and its nice you can make it ahead of time.  Thank you, thank you!

I made this app for the first time for a neighborhood party this past weekend. I made two mistakes: I didn't double the recipe, and I intentionally went a little light on the cayenne.

The carnivores made these disappear almost immediately, so I'll double the recipe (or more) the next time I do these for a party. I'll also use all the recommended cayenne. There was still a bit of a kick with my watered-down version, but more would have been just fine.

These turned out great! I used a bottle of beer I had on hand since I didn't have any cans. I figured beer is beer and it was for flavor anyway.  Yummy!! My hubby liked them too. Will definitely make them again.

I made this for a game night with friends and it was deemed the best appetizer of the night.  The family wants to have this for dinner this week because they loved it so much.  I doubled the recipe to make sure we had enough and it was still gone within 30 minutes.

We love how sweet, salty, savory, and spicy these are. The cayenne amount works well for us - it's not an overwhelming heat. We don't usually have beer and just cook the brats in beef broth - tastes great. We also like to partially pre-cook the bacon in a pan to ensure that it is able to cook at the way in the oven (particularly the parts of the bacon that are underneath the brat).

Really really good. I'm not a brat lover by any means but the DH loves them and I finally found a way to enjoy them as much as he does. These were so tasty I didn't change anything about it other than baking on a rack so they would get nice and crispy. Use cayenne with caution we didn't mind the full amount but they are rather spicy but thats what we like.

I made this recipe for a beer tasting party.  I couldn't believe how fast they disappeared!  This recipe took longer to make than I usually invest in an appetizer for an informal get-together, but it was time well spent.  A definite hit!  I did add some red pepper flakes to the brown sugar.  Also, I bought some dipping mustard to serve with this.  Yum!

Delicious! I wanted to use these on buns w/ fried onions and spicy mustard, so I kept them whole. Also, I omitted the cayenne/brown sugar mixture, but plan on trying that sometime soon. This is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love how simple this recipe is and how few ingredients are needed.  I didn't think it was too spicy at all!  Even my kids loved it (ages 5 - 11).  A perfect blend of sweet and spicy!  Our brats are bigger so I cut then in 4 or 5 pieces each.  Several people asked me for the recipe.

Came out good, Let it cool down for about 15 minutes before serving or you'll miss the subtle flavors. I used a blend of pepper seasoning sold by WalMart . ..  indicated as "fiery" . .. but cooked up rather mild. Found  out the brown sugar and pepper mix adhered best to the bacon strips. I'll do it again for sure. I like experimenting and massaging recipes. Every once in awhile my wife has to admitt that I've done good.

These were a huge hit with my husband. They're juicy with a great smoky flavor. I was afraid the brown sugar would be too much like a glaze, but they turned out perfect!
