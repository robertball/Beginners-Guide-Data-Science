This recipe was quick and easy. Kind of different, but really tasty! My coating didn't stick that well, so next time I'd make sure to crush the potato chips (I just used regular kettle cooked ones) really small and to press into the mayo well. I will put a bit more wasabi powder in next time too, to make it a bit spicier.

Excellent recipe!!!  The salmon was very moist and flavorful.  Sprayed a foil-lined baking sheet with Pam.  Used a 10 oz. bag of kettle chips, which were well crushed and pressed into the mayo, as suggested by another reader.  We tripled the Wasabi powder, plused used Wasabi paste for added flavor.  It was NOT spicy hot.  The bake time was longer than 20 minutes.  It reheated very well in the microwave at 50% power for a short time.  The only thing lost in reheating was the crunchiness of the chips, but the moistness and flavor was still there.  Definately a 5 star recipe.

this dish is good. i made a 3/4 lb. salmon steak, so i only used 1/4 cup mayo to about 3 tsp wasabi paste. i first used the wasabi powder and was completely disappointed by the flavor. i dumped that batch of mayo and started again, but only with the paste. much better. the powder does not taste good to me. i also added garlic to my mayo. salmon turned out good, but still not enough flavor. so i mixed up lemon juice with a tsp or so of the wasabi paste to drizzle over. that was awesome!!! i suggest that to everyone. it gave it the kick it was missing.

5 star with modifications: Uniformly rubbed wasabi paste on the raw salmon. Mixed 1tsp minced jar garlic & ginger in with mayo, added splash of soy sauce & 1tsp dry basil. Sprinkled plain dry bread crumbs on top of fish instead of potato chips. Last 3-5 minutes broiled.  Served with zucchini & tomato pie (many recipes on this site).

This is a REALLY easy recipe and I make it with a few modifications!!!

First you lay the slab of salmon in a baking pan, then pour YOSHIDA sauce (found at Costco) or any teriyaki sauce till it fills the bottom of the pan.  Then spread the wasabi-mayo over the entire slab of salmon.  Then sprinkle the Japanese seaweed/sesame seasoning "Furikake" over it.  Then bake!  I think this variation will have a more Asian kick to it... and also more flavor cuz of the Teriyaki sauce!

Trader Joe's sells Wasabi Mayo which worked fabulously.  Makes this delicious and easy recipe even easier!  I don't think it makes too much difference which potato chips you use; they all add a nice crunch to the dish.

This was quite possibly ine of the best pieces of salmon I ever had. Like some of the other cooks I added an extra T. of wasabi powder. I didn't have chips so I used panko bread crumbs topped with a little melted butter! It was great! I also like my salmon a little on the rare side so I only did 15 minutes and then under the broiler till the panko browned. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Fabulous recipe!  I will make it often.  Don't be turned off by the Wasabi. Used in the proportion stated in the recipe it is not spicy, just very flavorful. Yum!!

I used the Smart balance mayo, wasabi sauce(because i couldn't find powder and Special K sea salt cracker crisps and it was delicious!  It was not spicy because I was afraid to use too much wasabi so next time I will use more.  There will definetly be a next time!  Thanks!

Excellent!  Modified the recipe, and used what I had on hand: Wahoo in lieu of salmon, Panko bread crumbs in lieu of potato chips, wasabi paste in lieu of powder.  Came out great!!  Next time will spread the mayo a little thinner and bread crumbs a little thicker-- wonderful flavor and very moist, both my husband and i loved it!!

This was great and easy to put together after working all day.  I used 2 tsp of Wasabi paste with the mayo and it was great!  I will be making this again.

Made this last night it was awesome. The only thing was I had to substitute the Wasabi Powder/Mayo with Wasabi Horseradish as that is what I had in the house.  I also put Kettle Spicy Tai Chips to the top.  Even my 9 year old loved it.  This is definately a keeper!

Instead of using a wasabi powder and mayo, I had a jar of wasabi sauce in the fridge that was a lot like a mayo spread. I put it on really thickly and it soaked into the fish a bit and kept it fairly moist. I also used some extra sauce for dipping. Overall, this was fantastic!

Incredible!  Just made this and followed other reviewers ideas of Trader Joe's wasabi mayo and panko crumbs and it was delicious....couldn't have been simplier.  Made quinoa with toasted almonds and cranberries (recipe was on the package!) to accompany which was also fabulous.  Definitely give this a try!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE! THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS I USED SMART BALANCE MAYO A LITTLE OVER A 1/2 A CP. WITH 3 TBS. OF WASABI POWDER. AND I ALSO TOPPED IT WITH A SPRINKLE OF PLAIN BREAD CRUMBS. (WATCHING CHOLESTEROL) IT CAME OUT PERFECT, THIS WILL BE MY WEEKLY FISH DISH!!! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE.

We really liked this. Instead of salmon, I used skinless/boneless chicken breasts. At the suggestion of another review, I marinated the chicken in soy sauce for about 20 minutes. I added some cut red and green peppers to my casserole dish and put the chicken breasts on top of those, added the mayo mixture on top of the chicken (omitted the chips) and cooked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. It was subtle enough but still full of flavor. Will make this again for a quick and easy dinner!

This recipe sounds odd, but my husband made it for me one night and I LOVED it.  I eat salmon at least one a week and it was nice to have it prepared like this.  Thanks for sharing!

The combination of Wasabi and Mayonnaise does not go together well, particularly when baked. The topping of crushed potato chips did not help. I was reluctant to give this one a try. Now that I have, I'll pay more attention to the inner voice that says, "Nah, you don't want to do this," and save myself some disappointment.

Not our flavor in salmon recipes....but after following it Julesmom way it was fantastic!   Uniformly rubbed wasabi paste on the raw salmon. Mixed 1tsp minced jar garlic & ginger in with mayo, added splash of soy sauce & 1tsp dry basil.  Used the potato chip topping.  Served with roasted carrots and cherry tomatoes.

I've made this serveral times and the ONLY reason I gave this a 4 star is that I don't like the addition of the potato chips.   I make this with mayonesa (mayo made with lime instead of lemon, KRAFT makes it...and you can sometimes find it in the international isle in the mexican section)and I used wasabi sauce found near the mustards.   It is WONDERFUL and I love to eat it with wild rice and asparagus.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The hardest thing about this recipe was finding the Wasabi Powder in the grocery store (it was not in the spice isle, as I had originally thought - it was with the Mexican/Chinese stuff).  This was an extremely easy recipe to throw together in mere minutes.  And surprisingly good considering how little prep time it required.  All family members, including 3 kids under 8, all enjoyed this recipe.  Will definitely make it again.

To give it more flavour, I marinated the salmon in soy sauce for 30 minutes and instead of potato chips I used Japanese PANKO bread crumbs.

Ok, I forgot the potato chips but I still loved this.  I used fat free mayo.  I put the left over wasabi mayo in the fridge to use for sandwiches, etc.  Let me tell you, it gets spicer over time.  I will try this again with the chips and rerate it but I am just so happy with the simple way that I had to tell everyone.

this was a great recipe- something asian without the usual teryaki flavor. My husband and i loved it but i dont think i would reccommend it for kids. Start off slow with the wasabi powder and taste it as you add more- all wasabi powders are not created equal. I ended up using 1/4 cup mayo and about 2 tbsp powder. I didnt have Yokon Gold chips so i used Lays seasalt and pepper and it turned out great.
Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe using Trader Joe's Wasabi Mayo and Utz potato chips. It was yummy! I added a little pepper to the fish before cooking as well. Goes great with salad and bread.

I love spicy mayo at Sushi restaurants so I substituted sriracha instead of wasabi in with the mayo.  This turned out wonderful and perfectly cooked!

We really liked the recipe. I added a little soy sauce to the wasabi/mayo mix for salt and I used plain kettle cooked chips. It is really quite good. Definately will serve again.

Really Really Good!  My husband and I are tentative about salmon (I've never cooked it!) but diets recommend it, so we tried.  We purchased some filets from Sam's Club.  I used the Wasabi paste as that was all that was available at our grocery store and layered the mixture pretty thick on the salmon.  I also used regular Ruffles chips, crunched up.  I cooked it a little longer than called for and then broiled it on high for about 5 minutes to give the chips more crisp.  Very tasty!  Next time, might try french-fried onions instead of chips for more low carb.  Served with herb-roasted potates and asparagus.

I am sorry that I dont agree with all of the positive reviews. I made this for myself, husband and other couple. We all agreed that the recipe was good, but not all that moist, and def not the best we have ever had or made. I had high hopes for this because my husband LOVES wasabi. I wont be making this again without making big changes. Sorry

My bf likes his salmon on the skillet and hates fish cooked in the oven. But he loves this and said it was excellent. 
I made a number of modifications. I seasoned the fish with some seasoning (black pepper, garlic powder, Tony's Charcheres). I also used more wasabi powder and Miracle Whip instead of mayo.
Didn't have chips, so I just topped it with some Italian bread crumbs.
It doesn't look great,  but the taste was very good! 
Will be making this again soon.

This is a new dinner staple for us.  My husband was blown away - called it 'restaurant quality' and even had me print out the recipe for him to make for this shift at the firehouse.  They loved it too!  I used 3 tablespoons of wasabi paste, 40% less fat Cape Cod Kettle Chips with some french fried onions thrown in.  This is different and delicious!

Really tasty. I only had wasabi paste on hand and used about a teaspoon of that. The only advice I would give is to make sure to grease your pan thoroughly. I sprayed on Pam and it didn't keep the skin on the salmon from sticking. When I went to take it out the entire skin was burned and stuck to the pan. Next time, I'll grease it a bit better. I used original kettle cooked chips. I put it in plastic wrap and used a big spoon to crush it into small pieces. I served it with a side of asparagus (also baked w/a sprinkle of salt on top) and cajun rice from Zatarain's. Will definately cook again!

Wow, this is great!  I stumbled across this recipe because someone gave me a jar of Trader Joe's Wasabi Mayo.  I used that instead of making my own.  I used Kettle Baked Lightly Salted chips (120 calories/3g fat per oz).  After the 20 minutes, I cut off the thinner parts and then cooked the thick part of the fillet for another three minutes.

This was great!  My new fave salmon recipe!  I used a combination of fat free and reduced fat mayo, and lots of wasabi (paste and powder).  Love that wasabi rush!  Wish I could think of a good reduced fat substitute for the crushed potato chips but we enjoyed them as it was.  I did use a little less than called for.

I thought this salmon was good but I was afraid the wasabi would be too strong  so I stuck with the amount listed in the recipe but I could have doubled the amount.  I used salmon steaks instead of fillets, grilled on alder planks and used just regular potato chips because that is all I could find.  Next time I would add more wasabi and I think the family would enjoy it more.  The chips were a nice touch.

Nice flavor - not too spicy for my kids (ages 8 & 4). I made a little extra wasabi mayo for dipping. Leftovers reheat well in the broiler and toast up the chips nicely. Very easy make quickly.

Very moist. The wasabi sauce was a very nice touch without overpowering the fish. I just used a few crushed chips on top for a little crunch without adding too many calories. We eat a lot of salmon as it is so good for you so I am pleased to add this to my salmon recipes and will be making again soon.

used aioli instead of mayo- a THIN layer, much less than the recipe calls for. also used reduced salt chips the second time through- equally delicious.

I made this Wasabi Mayo Salmon before I shaw your recipe.  I usually use salmon steak to make this and it is still delicious because(in my opnion) the steak cooks more evenly than the fillet.  And I used wasabi paste to make the wasabi mayo.   I've never tried using potato chips as a crust yet, but I'll give it a shot sometime.  =)  Thanks for the idea!

I know it totally defeats the purpose of "wasabi" mayo salmon to replace the wasabi...buuuut.. I wanted a spicy new recipe for salmon and only had Sriracha ( another hot chili sauce ) on hand. So I substituted the wasabi with the Sriracha and oh my goodness! It was amazing. I also only used half the mayo because a whole cup seemed a bit much. I also used asain style rice crackers ( again all I had on hand ) instead of chips. It turned out awesome! My daughter was a hugely against this combo but after the first bite she asked when we were having this again. Soon!

This is awesome! I used 1 tbsp of wasabi paste instead of powder. I might have added more for a bit more spice but the rest of the people eating it would not have like it as much. I used plain kettle chips on top. This will definitly be made again in my house.

I really enjoyed this recipe! My variation included panko bread crumbs, blue cheese dressing and wasabi paste. The crust was crunchy and tangy with just enough spice from the wasabi. Definitely a favorite!

Really good recipe.  Simple and flavorful, "restaurant food" is what we call things this pretty and delicious in our house.  I use good thick Yukon Gold chips smashed into crumbs, and I've also tried it with Mahi Mahi.  Just fantastic.

I changed this a bit according to what I had on hand.  So, it was more of a starting point recipe.  Top salmon with plain mayo and press in crushed Wasabi almonds (Blue Diamond Bold) Wrap in foil, and place on hot grill, covered, approx 20 minutes.  Fabulous taste, crunchy, and easy. 4 stars, only because I changed it.

Looks great and is definitely moist. Probably the moistest salmon I've ever made but VERY GREASY. I'd make it again though but with more wasabi sauce. I don't taste anything spicy.

Was only cooking for two so halved the recipe. Used Cape Cod kettle cooked chips and crushed them very well. Took the advice of other reviewers who said it wasnt spicy and tripled the wasabi powder. Still this did not create any spice but created an amazing flavor. I can not imagine preparing salmon any other way. And it only took about 3 minutes to put together.  I should also note that even though I used only 1 1/2lb. of salmon it still required the full 20 minutes in the oven.

Can Wasabi powder go bad? That's the only thing I can think of why I did not care for this dish. It had a flavor that I did not care for - and I LOVE wasabi. Husband said he didn't mind it. Sorry.

Excellent!  This is easy to cook in the oven, and I loved the kick of wasabi flavor.

I really liked this, but next time to save calories, I would omit the chips and just serve with wasabi mayo. We used fat free mayo and it was still great.

Loved it. I have a hard time eating cooked salmon because of the smelliness factor, but the wasabi really helps. I couldn't find powder wasabi, so I used a tblsp of prepared paste. Next time I will use 2.

The topping is delicious!  It compliments the flavor in the salmon perfectly.  It's also very quick.  I recommend making more topping than the recipe calls for, though weight-conscious folks should not.

I gave this only 4 stars as it didn't "knock my socks off". I'm not a big mayo fan and perhaps that's why.  But my son loved it. I did only two fillets and tried to adjust the measures accordingly. Used w/paste (all I had) and bread crumbs (again, no chips on hand) also used Ultra low fat Helleman's Mayo. Next time I'll just run it quickly under the broiler as I thought it looked "undone". The 2 fillets baked in an 8x8 pan took approx. 25 min. The EASE of prep is wonderful and I will definetly try again. Next time will make sure there are chips. Actually this sounds like it would be wonderful on the grill and as soon as the ice melts a bit more .... Thanks Lesley, you've given me inspiration to experiment.

This was a delicious dish, spicy yet not hot at all. I did double the ammount of wasabi powder, and it tasted really great!. The chìps I used were regular chips, and it tasted wonderful. Thank you very much for a VERY easy to make dish!

I more than doubled the amount of wasabi powder/paste the recipe called for, but this just didn't have the "pow" we were both looking for.  I will admit, the salmon was quite moist, but we were expecting more of a stronger wasabi taste.  The Profanity Salmon recipe on this site will give you the kick you are looking for!

I'm not much a seafood lover; but this salmon is quite good. I'll be making it a lot more.  Please come up with more good recipes for this and tuna. I give this a 4 3/4 stars.

This is a nice and easy twist to a baked salmon recipe, and for the most part everyone will likely already have the  ingredients in their pantry. It is also a nice way to spice things up if you are just having a simple fish and veggies dinner.

AMAZING!!! Best baked salmon the hubby and I have ever tried! Super juicy and cruchy. I do suggest using the wasabi paste like most everyone says though! We used the Cape Cod kettle chips and mindful mayo. So delicious!

Made this recipe last night and while it wasn't bad it wasn't terribly exciting either.  At the suggestion of other reviews I doubled the wasabi, but still found it to be somewhat bland. We will finish the left overs, but won't make it again.

Five stars with a little tweaking .   Using the paste wasabi instead of the powder and using a little more than called for is a definite .   Simple , easy yet looks  and taste like you should have your own show.

Omg, this was so delicious. I did a couple things different. First I put salt, pepper, galic powder, fresh grated ginger, lemon juice, then wasabi powder and wasabi mayo on the fish. I topped with panko bread crumbs and sprayed my pan with olive oil nonstick . I also only baked my salmon for 15 mins and it was so juicy and delicious!! My man loved it. Will make again!

Wow! This recipe came out delicious. I used about double the wasabi because I like it spicy. I also used tri colored exotic Terra potato chips which made the dish. This was a fantabulous recipe and I will definitely make it again!

This was quite a tasty dish, although I tripled the amount of wasabi and used Tim's wasabi flavored chips. I think any less than that and you would lose the wasabi flavor to the salmon

if I could give this no stars, I would.  Very rarely I come across a recipe that is downright bad and this was it.  I was so excited about the culmination of flavors of salmon and wasabi, but this was just OFF.  I used wasabi powder, even doubled it, like previous reviews, but it just did not taste good!  I took the first bite and did not like it.  I had a guest over and she stated the salmon was good, the flavors just did not gel.  I couldn't even finish my dinner, it was that bad and disappointing.  Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.

I did not like this much, I ended up scraping the wasabi-mayo off the top; my husband however loved it and he doesn't even like salmon that much, I think with a few adjustments this good be really good, as salmon and wasabi is a great combination

We cook fish often.  My husband said this recipe is the best he's ever had.  He fishes in the Gulf and is anxious to try it using other types of fish.  He usually brings home "red fish".

I used miracle whip and a little extra paste and it turned out great.  My husband and exchange student from South Korea really enjoyed it.  We happened to make the Campfire Vidalia onions and it was the perfect combo.

I loved this recipe - thanks so much for sharing it.  I think it has been one of my favorite so far, as we like things with lots of flavor.  I followed other's suggestions and used 3 tsp of Wasabi paste instead of powder.  Used crushed Tortillas.  We also used a lemon-wasabi drizzle over the fish at the end and it was delish!

AWESOME!! This was the first time I cooked salmon. This recipe was so easy and quick!! But best of all it was super tastey!! I used wasabi paste instead of powder and thick potato chips with sea salt (crushed pretty fine). It was a HUGE hit!!

Wonderfull. Absolutly needs to triple the Wasabi in the recipe and I used Sea Salt Kettle Chips for the topping and it was GREAT!

Just to see if it would rate I put a coastal cuisine rub on half of my Copper River Salmon & half with this recipe (extra wasabi added as suggested) and I have to say this one was bland, boring and not worth another shot.  The coastal cuisine rub however was stellar.  You can get it in the packaging of cedar cooking planks at costco.

The flavor was overwhelmed by the excessive mayo.  I am cutting down on the mayo next time.

My family enjoyed every bite.  I added about 4 tablespoons of wasabi paste to mayo and took advice of mixture of lemon juice and wasabi drizzled over salmon. Yum!!

This was very good. Lots of flavor. I used Gold Tostito Chips and the crunch gave it an extra suprise!

This was just amazing!  We used more wasabi because we only had the paste on hand and I don't find it as potent as the powder.  We also made a sauce of lime juice, wasabi and mayo to add extra zip to ours and not the kids.  Everyone here ate it all up.  Thank you so much for sharing a super fast, easy way to make salmon.  This will definetly go into our regular rotation.

This meal was excellent! I had to use "cajun" instead of "wasabi", but it was still great.

It was really good.  I didn't have the powder wasabi so I used the paste in the tube.  Also, I mixed Flying Fish Roe (tiny fish eggs) with my mixture and it was delicious!  The spice in the wasabi really made the dish.

didn't care for the potato chips, but the wasabi mayo more than compensates!  absolutely delicious with soy sauce or teryaki for condiments.
