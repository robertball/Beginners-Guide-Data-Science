Giving 4 stars with changes: I pounded the chix flat & rolled with pastrami; made a pretty plate presentation. Left out bacon. increased broth by 1/2 cup & just added the uncooked rice with rest of ingredients; mixed & poured over the pastrami/chicken rolls. Covered to cook & turned out great!

I thought this recipe was delicious exept for the bacon wrapped. Maybe the bacon should be cooked somewhat before wrapping that way it does not become slimy.

Has a good taste I did two things differently. I added 1 cup water to the sour cream and condensed soup mixture. The rice cooked up better. I also used deli sliced pastrami and only needed approximately 2-3 oz. I cooked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes covered and then 400 degrees for 15 uncovered to make the bacon crisper. Lastly do not use thick bacon it will NEVER cook.

I took into consideration the comments about soggy bacon and revised the recipe a bit. Instead of wrapping the bacon around the chicken I wrapped the pastrami around the chicken then fried up the bacon and crumbled it over the top of the dish before baking. It turned out wonderfully. The only negative comment I would make was that the cream sauce was a bit gloppy. Maybe it was because I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream (I was out of sour cream) but I doubt it. Flavor was still good though!

Nice blend of flavors. Bacon didn't cook. Doubled the time....then raised the heat. I agree with the others...partially cook the bacon and raise the temp...add some spices to the sour cream blend to spice it up if desired...very good base for many variables/additives.

This is a great recipe. I made it for my neices and nephew ages 6 8 and 11. They each had two pieces of chicken. I didn't wrap the bacon around the chicken because I had none substituted fresh mushrooms for the canned. I topped it with onion soup mix. Absolutely fantastic!!

The flavor in this recipe is good. But the bacon needs to be cooked first so it is not slimey. The tempature should be uped some and you should really cover this dish in the oven for a while so that your rice stays tender.

I would probably make this again but with some changes. The flavor was good but it definitely was not done in 30 to 40 minutes. Breast tenders might a better option that breasts cut in half. After 50 minutes I ended up raising the oven temp to 350 which could have caused it to dry out a little on top. I partially cooked the bacon and used ham instead of pastrami. It might a good idea to add a little more broth and/or cover it for a portion of the time.

My family really enjoyed the pastrami chicken bake we all had seconds; we followed the recipe and really enjoyed it it was a flavorful and filling dinner. I imagine this will be worked into our dinner rotation.
