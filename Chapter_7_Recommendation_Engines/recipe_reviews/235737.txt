This was easy and delicious.  I made some small additions.  I have never made meatballs with no salt or spices at all in the meat itself, so I added half a tsp of dry mustard, half a tsp of garlic powder and half a tsp of black pepper.  I formed the meatballs using a quarter of a cup measuring cup so they were fairly large.  The sauce is wonderful.  It thickens as it cools and really sticks to the meatballs.  Yum!  I used a brand that is more mustard based (Cattleman's Gold).  My only observation is that this makes an awful lot of sauce.  I had at least a cup and a half after all the meatballs were gone.  I'm going to use it to bake some chicken cause it's too good to waste.  I also wish these were called by another name.  Hamballs is somewhat misleading.  Please list this recipe again just calling it BBQ meatballs so others can enjoy it like  we did.  I will be making again and again.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Very good and very easy. I made it just like the recipe, even using a spicy version of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.
