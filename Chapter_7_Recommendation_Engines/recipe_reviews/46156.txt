This is a good base recipe that I've made for mussels, shrimp, and crayfish tails.  Spicewise, I find it a little too mild as is, so I ramp up the curry powder by using 2 tsp madras curry powder, a dash of hot pepper flakes, and 1 tsp salt.  If you substitute some/all of the heavy cream with half-and-half, be sure to have cornstarch on hand to thicken everything up.

We loved this recipe! (except for Ashley) I used half and half and made two sauces; one with the curry and the other I subbed with dijon mustard. I served the mussels over thinly sliced toasted italian bread as an appetizer. Thanks Kerry!

I literally just made this. I doubled the entire recipe. There was three of us (two were men--who can EAT). There was just a few left. It was FANTASTIC!! This recipe DOES NOT need to be altered AT ALL. It was amazing just the way it was!! We all loved it!!

This was great.  I used a tablespoon of dijon mustard instead of curry as one reviewer suggested.  It was exactly like the dish I order from a local restaurant.

Excellent! I followed the recipe to a t except I used half and half instead of cream. We had this on a bed of pasta but fresh bread to dip in the oh-so-yummy sauce would be great too!

I loved this recipe! However, I'm lactose intolerant, so modified the recipe as follows:
- I replaced the heavy cream with coconut milk
- added another half a cup of wine
- eliminated the butter

It turned out great! I'm making it again this weekend!

Oh boy, this is awesome. My husband and 24 yo son ate all of them making "mmm" noises throughout. Simple, savoury and delicious. 
At the mens' suggestion I might add some heat next time. Since I didn't get any to eat anyhow, I might as well cook it to their liking!

Oh, SO good. We have been searching for the perfect mussels since our trip to Paris.  These were delicious. I did add a healthy pinch of saffron. I would cook the sauce down more next time before tossing in the mussels as it was a bit too thin, but otherwise great. Paired with French bread and homemade caesar salad = PERFECTION!

Delicious, and super-easy. I'll save this as one of my Top 100 "make again" recipes. First of all, the prep time was nowhere near 40 minutes: This was much quicker than that. I made it with whole cream (aka heavy cream), and that was perfect; I'd been concerned it would curdle, like cream sometimes does at high heat, but not at all. I used slightly less cream than called for, tho -- because I had only a certain amount on hand -- and a bit more wine than called for, and I liked the weight of the sauce like that. A keeper!

This is a great recipe. Try substituting coconut milk for the cream and adding fresh tarragon at the very end.

These are excellent. If you like the broth a bit thicker, just cook it down further either before you put mussels in, or after they are cooked. I too put in a bit more curry.

Quick, delicious and rich! This recipe is dangerous specifically for that sauce! I find myself going through a whole french baguette trying to soak up all of the sauce. For the shellfish lovers in your life, this is an excellent dish to show off!

This was really good. I didnt have white wine so i used some red cooking wine and it turned out just fine. We had snow crab legs with this and i used the leftover cream sauce to dip my crab in..My clams were precooked so I just added them at the end.

I loved this sooo much. I made a few changes for this recipe. I am pregnant so I used apple juice and vinigar instead of the wine. I also added shrimp with the mussels. After it was all cooked, i thickened it with flour and placed it over lingune.

These were SOOOOO good! I first tried it with half and half but it curdled! Then I got real and used the cream and it was beautiful. I may have poured too much wine because it turned out a bit thinner than I anticipated...but FULL of flavor!! We will definitely use this recipe again!

My whole family LOVED this recipe. I bought the mussels from Costco so I had to triple the recipe and I used 1/4th half/half , a bit more curry powder and some salt.  served with crusty bread.  Super Yummy!!!

I thought these were fabulous!  My husband found it a little rich, but loved it also.  I served it with a mixed greens salad and sourdough bread.  The bread was perfect for dipping in the flavorful sauce.  I used extra curry as per other reviewers comments, and I'm glad I did.  I will definitely make these babies again!

This recipe was easy to follow and tasted great. This is the first time I made mussels. I didn't use the curry powder and I added in a bunch of diced tomatoes instead. I served it up with a side of home made fries and a baguette with goat cheese and red pepper jelly.

A real winner. I find the leftover sauce also makes a nice soup.

A little more curry powder makes this a nicer dish.  It was a big success in my house and asked for all the time.

I also used 1/2 &1/2. This is the best recipe i have tried on this web site.  If you like garlic and curry this is for you.

Not as much curry flavor as I was hoping for and a little strong on the garlic and shallots but still tasty.

We enjoy mussels and this was the first time we prepared them with curry. In one word....DELICIOUS. We served them over jasmine rice which added a nice texture together with the flavors in this recipe. Highly recommend trying it.

I did not have any wine in the house so I substituted a high quality Japanese SAKE.  I also used half and half instead of the heavy cream.  It was absolutely delightful along with a loaf of toasted french bread for dipping!   Ooooh la la

Excellent. I added a little more curry than recipe called for. Next time I may experiment and add some mango chunks at the end.....

This was absolutely wonderful!! My whole family loved this. I didn't have any shallots or green onions on hand and it still came out great. Another difference is that I used frozen mussels which I cooked first to let them open and then added them to sauce at the end. Glad to find something else to do with mussels. Thanks

This was SO GOOD. If you are looking for a hot and spice curry, then this isn't the recipe for you, but the mild curry flavor was exactly what I was looking for and perfect for our whole family. I served it over rice, as pictured, because my husband is gluten free. I added lemon grass and substituted cilantro for parsley, since that is what I had. I used the extra sauce over seared scallops the next night, which was also amazing.

Excellent!  My son and I made this tonight and cleaned the pot.  The sauce is great and leftovers (sauce - all the mussels were eaten) will be turned into a chowder soup tomorrow.  I will definitely make this again.

I've been known to prepare a great pot of mussels with white wine and fresh parmasean and never really considered any variation. Well, I tried this curry inspired recipe and found it tasted great, fast and easy to prepare. Will make it again. Thanks.
