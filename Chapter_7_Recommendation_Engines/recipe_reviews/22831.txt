Quick and easy. I used margarine instead of butter and homogenized milk instead of heavy cream. I did not need to use any thickening agents-the consistency was just right. Just toss with fettucine and serve.

You would not believe how incredible this sauce is!  My husband and I made this sauce (served over fettuccine noodles) for my friend and her husband, as they just had their third child a few days ago and we figured they could use the break from cooking - they went nuts, they loved it so much!  Even their two younger sons (3 and 2) loved this dish.  It literally tastes IDENTICAL to the sauce that they serve at the Olive Garden.  Another good tip is to add a can of drained mushrooms to the sauce - it really tastes great.  I'd give this 6 stars if I could - I will NEVER buy alfredo sauce again!  The next time I might use milk and a little cornstarch instead of the cream (as one previous reviewer suggested) and perhaps reduced fat margarine to save on fat and calories.  Be sure to use fresh shredded parmesan (available in bags in the dairy section), Kraft grated just doesn't do it as well - and the shredded parm melts really well.  ENJOY this incredible dish!  Thank you, Rebecca!  :)

Very good flavor in this recipe, but I did add a 2nd clove of garlic. If you just stir the cream into the butter and let it simmer, it will seperate. I gently whisk the cream and butter the entire time it's simmering and whisk while adding the cheese (a little at a time) and it doesn't seperate, even after a day in the fridge. The consistency is a little hard to get smooth, but probably because parmesan is a very hard cheese with a granular texture to begin with, and doesn't melt smoothly. I used a parmesan/asiago blend and it was beautifully smooth after lots of whisking. Also, make sure you use unsalted butter - if you use margarine or lightly salted butter, it's way too salty. I used this recipe to make a white chicken lasagna, which was absolutely delicious, and it held up well in the refrigerator to have leftovers the next day.

Holy Moly! My husband loves alfredo, and he freaked out because this was so good. I made a double recipe, added 1.5 pounds of pan seared chicken breast and poured it over tri-color rotini (it was the only pasta in the house). Unbelievable! It was a little thin at first, but thickened as it cooled. I used genuine Parmesan Reggiano and it melted wonderfully smooth--just be sure to add only a handful at a time. Do not boil, or the sauce will separate.

Bland & throughly uninspired. My husband was none too pleased, and my children were less than enthused which is a far cry from their usual elation with my Italian cooking. I made this for my family yesterday, and recognized the taste right away as being a recipe I've made before though not from this site (copy cat recipes; the book actually). I added 1/8 tsp ground pepper since the flavor was sadly lacking. While I know that I'm am a tough critic having lived for 3 years in Italy this wasn't even passable to my husband who has only visited there with me. This alfredo is fine for someone with a bland palate, but if it's flavor you crave then move on to a recipe more original and authentic.

I love this recipe and make it for my boyfriend at least once a week!  We add an extra quarter cup of fresh Parmesan cheese and a tablespoon of flour...it makes the sauce much less runny.

I made this recipe for my x-mother and father-in-law last weekend. She is an avid vegetarian but will eat seafoods. I made the alfrado using the Gruyere cheese, then in a separate skillet sauted 4 chopped green onions, 1T crushed garlic, and 2T fresh chopped parsley in 2T olive oil, added 1lb cleaned devained shrimp and 1 can lump crab meat over medium heat until shrimp turned pink then folded into the alfrado sauce and served over linguini.

I tried this recipe using 2 different types of parmesan cheese, the shredded kind and the finely grated kind (think Kraft green container).  The shredded was SOOO much better, though both times I used a bit more cream and a bit less cheese.  I used equal amounts and added about a 1/4 cup of cream extra and did about a 1/4 cup less cheese.  We served it with grilled chicken (marinade in Itailian dressing)and grilled red peppers.  YUM!  Thanks for the recipe.  Ths was the best alfredo I've ever had!

This recipe is exceptional! Bravo to whoever started making this. I also used the gruyere cheese which i think is a plus, it was really creamy. We were big fans of the Olive Garden alfredo until we found this. Thanks!

Very good basic Alfredo sauce. Remember to keep the sauce at a slow simmer, and never bring to the boil. The high heat will cause the cheese to turn grainy... a slow simmer will keep it smooth and creamy.
Note: A simmer is where the temperature of the liquid is just below the boiling point, or where small bubbles come to the surface and break gently.
You could try different cheeses... why not, or you could substitute the parsley with another herb, such as, Cilantro.

Oh, and I enjoy a bit more garlic... keeps the Vampires away.

Simple ingredients, FANTASTIC FLAVOR! I've made this a few times now and I've learned:  1. definitely use FRESH SHREDDED PARM (instead of the grated green can)- and, just one cup of cheese will suffice  2. use TWO CLOVES MINCED GARLIC  3. HALF&HALF in place of heavy cream  4. CONTINUOS WHISKING! I start whisking when I add the cream to the unsalted butter and I don't stop until I turn my stove off.  ...Thanks for the great recipe, it's a new family fave!

For those who say it is grainy. USE fresh parmesan and grate it yourself and make sure the heat is not too high.

Use heavy cream and REAL butter, not margarine

And for flavor, this is a sauce. The basic sauce is cheese and cream, if you want more flavor, add what you like.

I thought the sauce was perfect. Creamy, I heat on low and simmer slowly to melt slowly. It came out creamy and perfect and easy to prepare.

No problems what so ever. I season with salt and pepper after it is done before I toss or serve it. I like to season accordingly to what I am serving it with.

Tastes amazing.  A funny thing though--after I put the extra sauce in the fridge for later, I took it out the next day and it had congealed to the form of a spreadable cheese.  This was just fine, though, as it microwaved to smooth and creamy.  I found that slicing up some french bread and spreading the leftover alfredo "spread" over it made a delightful cheesy garlic bread after baking.  Regardless of the interesting texture change, the sauce was positively tasty.  Very cheesy.

A great basic recipe!  I  don't usually use heavy cream, so I make the roux first with flour, butter and use milk or half and half. I also add a few garlic cloves and have been known to add some steamed broccoli and roasted red peppers.  For those of you who said the texture is not smooth, you need to make sure you buy a block of cheese and grate it yourself or buy it in the cheese department of the grocery not in the Kraft plastic container or any similar, they usually add some kind of anti-caking powder which renders the cheese useless if you want it to melt.   Also, if you add it a bit at a time and stir, you will see better results regarding the cheese melting.

This is a great recipe!  I made fettuccine, placed the alfredo sauce on it put a boneless chicken breast on the fettuccine, and spooned alfredo sauce on the chicken.  I made fresh broccoli and put that on the side along with some garlic bread.  Best meal I have made in weeks!! My boyfriend agrees he wants it again!! Thanks Rebecca

Delicious simple Alfredo recipe! I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream which cuts the calories and fat by 2/3 and adds flavor. As another suggested, replaced parsley with fresh chopped cilantro. Used 1 cup grated gruyere and 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan reggiano. Mangia!

This is my go-to recipe for Alfredo sauce. The most important thing is to use freshly grated Parmesan, not the pre-shredded bagged stuff (or heaven forbid bottled!). This makes a huge difference. Thanks for the great recipe, Rebecca!

I love this recipe!! With a family of 5, I "upscaled" the serving size to 10; using 3 cups of Gruyere and 3/4 fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  Like Italian restaurants, I sautéed some Vidalia onions making it GRAND!! I use this sauce for pasta, meat, pizza and FONDUE!

I love this sauce!  I did take Rebecca's suggestion and used Gruyere cheese instead of parmesan.  It melted perfectly!  I also used margarine instead of butter and half and half instead of heavy cream.  I mixed this with fettucine, chicken, and steamed broccoli.  It was wonderful!  A definite keeper!

A delicious alfredo sauce! I tripled the recipe, used half and half but cut back on the parm. Truthfully, I used a good grated parm right out of the jar and it was wonderful. This sauce would even work using evaporated skim milk. Thanks Rebecca!

The taste of the recipe was unbelievable!!!  My husband and I loved the first few bites.  Then we just couldn't handle the texture.  I spent over 45 min. trying to melt the parmesan.  I read all the other reviews and added it slowly, but the lumps wouldn't go away. They got even worse as the sauce cooled and was mixed with noodles.  I was really disappointed.  This was so much work and expensive ingred.  I will be trying another recipe next time.

Wow! We loved it. VERY VERY VERY good. If you want to save the leftovers, toss it with the leftover pasta first, then refrigerate. It will come out better that way. Good, good stuff.

Sorry, but didn't come out right!  The cheese totally seperated from the cream/butter mixture and stuck to the chicken pieces (that I added in)! I tried saving it by stirring even more, but it just made it worse! I'm going to stick to the "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" on this site, it tastes AWESOME and at least it doesn't seperate!

At last, I've adjusted a few things and now it's perfect for us!  Substitute fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 for cream, 1/2 c of shredded parm (from the little plastic tub), LOTS of garlic, pepper to taste, and a block of low fat or Neufchatel cream cheese.  Great taste, not too gluey.  Great with sauteed onion, chicken and frozen (thawed) shrimp.

This sauce is incredible (and not to mention very quick and easy to make)!!  My husband who NEVER says anything is really good actually was the first person to tell me it was really good and then he suggested that I make it again! He even said that he thought it was better than most restaurant's versions! I did however use whole milk instead of the heavy cream and it turned out spectacular.  I also found that if it is too watery then I add a little corn starch to it to make it nice and thick and creamy.  I made a quick chicken scampi to top the pasta and it was a hit with everyone!  Thanks Rebecca, I will never use alfredo from a jar again!

Amazing! I feel like a chef, like a professional cook!!! My husband loved it. My 6 year old daughter (who does not like chesse or milk)cleaned up the plate! This recipe is totally a keeper. The only thing I added was some shredded chicken (I like meat of any kind). Thumbs up!!!

It doesn't get any easier or any tastier.  To those trying to swap out margerine for butter, it might save fat, but it costs you flavor.  You don't need to have this on your menu every night, so please do yourself a favor and fix it with the real cream and butter, (just skip having seconds) and enjoy your food a little.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is my first attempt at alfredo sauce.  It was a huge success!!  Tastes great.  I will make again and again.  I used grated parmesan and heavy cream but next time will try half & half and other cheese varieties.

This is my first time trying to make Alfredo sauce from scratch. I thought the recipe was quite easy to make however, it was too rich and once it was on the pasta I found it to be clumpy, and almost paste like. I also thought that there was too much cheese if that's possible. I thought it was o.k., but I'm afraid I won't make it again.

I made this recipe with parmasean cheese and thought it came out awesome!  Tasted exactly like the alfredo I have paid big bucks for at italian resturants.  Parmesean can be a bit hard to melt, but be patient and keep whisking and it will be worth it.

This was pretty good.  The thickness was just right.  I stirred the entire time.  It ended up a little gritty but I think that was from the cheese (may have used more than 1 1/2 cups, I didn't measure).  The cheese I used was freshly grated from one of those wedges.  I know that cheddar can get gritty when heated too much so next time I will remove the sauce from the heat before stirring in the parmesan.  In any case, I made this for some friends and everyone liked it :)

Simple, quick and tasty!!!!  I sauteed bacon, fresh garlic, 1/2 bag of frozen peppers and onions in EVOO. Removed from pan and made this sauce. Cooked a bag of cheese tortellini and steamed some garlic broccoli. Added tortellini and veggies into sauce and topped with additional Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper flakes.

This sauce turned out amazing! I used 2 cloves of garlic, just because I LOVE garlic. It takes a while for the cheese to melt in, but it will- just allow plenty of time for it. As PP said, don't let the sauce boil, it WILL separate. I will never buy alfredo again, and I don't think I'll ever try another recipe. This was truly the best sauce I have ever made- and it is so simple. Thank you for such a great recipe!

Very good and extremely easy! I used asiago cheese since parmesan does not melt very well and I kow asiago does.  I also doubled the recipe to use with one package of fettucine.  This recipe will impress your friends who will think you slaved for hours in the kitchen!

Great recipe as is. If your parmesan cheese doesn't melt, it's because you bought pre-shredded and it has dried and hardened. Freshly shredded has much more moisture content and flavor. And if you really want a treat, use parmagiano-reggiano from Italy. I have also used 1/2 parm and 1/2 asiago for deeper flavors.

I made this tonight with wood grilled zucchini, squash & tomatoes from the garden and added a little bit of fresh rosemary and thyme. Amazing!

This was pretty good and pretty much the way I make it only I had always melted the butter with flour before adding the cream and garlic and cheese. So this is really already what I do to start with. But I did not add the flour this time and I did add more garlic. I also used carrots, broccoli and chicken with the alfredo and some mushrooms. I skillet cooked my chicken for that grilled taste using olive oil and cajun seasoning. That made the dish.

Very easy to make and tastes great!  I made it just as is to use in a recipe that called for a jar of alfredo sauce.  I have only ever bought jarred alfredo sauce twice and didn't care for the taste of it either time.  Now I know I'll just make it myself. Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

This is incredible! Like other reviews say, it really is restaurant quality. I used 2% milk and a tablespoon of corn starch instead of heavy cream because I wanted to cut some calories.  Definitely couldn't tell I tried to cut calories with how rich, creamy and flavorful it was. I used freshly grated Parmesan cheese from the deli section and it melted beautifully... just had to give it enough time. My company was late for dinner and it started to thicken up.  I turned the heat back on, added a bit of milk and stirred it and it was as good as fresh. I made chicken broccoli alfredo over Asian stir-fry rice noodles to keep it gluten free for my 6-year-old who has gluten sensitivity. Perfect meal with a side of veggies and garlic bread. What's also great is that it doesn't take long to make!  Cubing the chicken was the most time consuming part.

I did not like this at all. I followed the directions exactly as written...the consistency was too thick and "gritty," the taste was much too salty, and I thought there was way too much of a parmesean cheese taste. I served it over pasta for my kids (who love alfredo sauce) and they wouldn't eat it.

This recipe was an awesome base recipe. I followed the recipe as far as the butter and cream and added 1/2 a clove of garlic. ( I found that a whole clove was a little too much for me) then I added about 1/2 cup of fresh shredded asiago cheese. I didnt have any fresh parsley so I just used about 1/2 TB of dried. I also added some fresh ground black pepper and it turned out fantastic!!! It was so good with fresh garlic bread!!! Will make this again, thanks for sharing!

This turned out great!  I added an extra clove of garlic and I served with chicken on the top.  I brushed melted butter on the chicken and sprinkled each side with salt, pepper, thyme, and parsley and baked in the oven for about half an hour.  I then sliced it into long strips and put it on top of the pasta.  It was an easy and delicious dinner!

I'm sure this is delicious as is, but I made two minor adjustments.  First, I used half heavy cream and half half&half instead of all heavy cream.  Second, I only used 1 cup of Parmesan and for the other 1/2 cup of cheese I used Pecorino Romano.  Otherwise I kept the recipe the same.  This sauce is DELICIOUS!!  It's sitting on the counter right now waiting for the rest of dinner to be ready, and it's actually a little thick so I might thin it out with a little bit of milk.  The thickness of the sauce and it's great flavor made me think of making spinach and artichoke dip with it next time I make it...we already wiped the pot clean from dipping bread in there after I poured the sauce into a bowl.

I don't usually review recipes, but I just HAD to review this one. As a devoted customer of Olive Garden, I was skeptical when I made this... so many people had reviewed it, saying that it was as good as Olive Garden. Now I love that stuff--I get alfredo dipping sauce for the breadsticks, & I get fettucine alfredo as my meal! But honestly, this alfredo is just as good, or even better. I made it for my mother, & she liked it so much that she begged me to make another batch of it for her the very same day! It truly is a wonderful recipe, & I will be using it a lot. One note: when making it, make sure that you stir in the cheese slowly, and also make sure that you whisk it while you do so. Basically, after you add the cream and it begins to simmer, you will need to whisk it every few seconds for the rest of the time it is cooking. Otherwise, it will separate. It is a very good, easy recipe-- a real treat for busy women! :)

Best ever alfredo. Sometimes I make a variation with fresh mushrooms cooked until almost tender with the butter before adding the rest of the ingredients.

I made this sauce few times already and its is very easy and tasty. There is no reason to buy Alfredo sauce in a jar if you can make it your own. ***Make sure you always use the fresh Parmesan cheese that you grate yourself, the other stuff will not melt and you will have grainy sauce*** I also add sliced portabello mushrooms or chicken to the sauce to make it chunkier.

This was amazing.  It is super important to keep moving the entire time for it to be blended.  I whisked is while adding the cheese, and almost the entire time that it cooked and it was very creamy, but I also added a touch more cream.  I served over pasta with shrimp and mushrooms to a huge crowd of family, and they all couldn't stop going off about how it was better than restaraunt quality.  Thanks for the post!!!

I LOVE this recipe.  I come from an Italian family that's very picky about their pasta sauces, and they all love it, too! The garlic flavor blends really well with the parmesan, it's terrific!  My roomate loves it as well, and demands I make it on a regular basis.  Since I'm not a Gruyere fan, I've found that using a hand mixer with a chopping blade before adding the parsley works to break up the clumps of parmesan cheese that melt together, and makes the sauce extra creamy.  Again, fantastic recipe, thanks for sharing it!

I read one review that sounded horrible, but I didn't have the same experience.  The only changes I made to this recipe were that I added a dash of white pepper, and maybe and extra Tbs. or so of parmesean cheese ( which helped thicken it a little). The sauce looked really thin, but as soon as it is put on a plate over chicken and pasta it thickens beautifully and really has a very nice flavor. I would recommend this to anyone as you have the comfort of homemade sauce, but it is still very little trouble to make.

This sauce was spectacular ! It was so creamy and smooth. I used Parmesan cheese and it melted very well (probably because I added it slowly, not all at once). Very delicious....highly recommended !

This is a GREAT Alfredo recipe.  I like the Gruyere substitution in this recipe.  Not so kid friendly, as alfredo usually is not, but for adults Alfredo is quite the treat.  Overall I give it *****.

Not the best sauce I have ever had but nice and simple to make. The family was very pleased with the taste and will make again when short on time. Only problem when reheating left overs the oil separated. All in all I really liked this recipe.

Rich, flavorful, excellent. Everyone enjoyed this recipe! I used some half-and-half in place of the cream. Used FRESHly grated Pecorino Romano cheese because I had that on hand...fabulous. If you are still using that infamous tall, green can...stop. Switch to freshly grated for this recipe and any others. =) Great recipe--easy to make! Give it a shot!!

This is a great recipe. Though it adds a little more work, I recommend using a chunk of Parmesan from the deli and grate it yourself. The anti-caking additives in many pre-shredded/grated cheeses are the culprit to a less-than-smooth result!

Ugh I did not like. I thought it was just me, but in looking as some past reviews, it was way too salty. Cheese "looked" like it was melted and creamy, but it tasted like there was sand in it. I saved some for the next day to put with another pasta in case it was just me, but it became so hard I could barely get it out of the container. Sorry to be so negative, but I will not try it again.

Wonderful alfredo sauce!  I added extra garlic anda freshly grated nutmeg and that made a huge difference.  Yummy!  To those who have a problem with graininess, buy the wedge of parmesan cheese and grate it at home.  A litte bit of effort makes a big difference.  You won't have any problems with your cheese not melting.

Absolutely disgusting.  Do not waste your time, unless you're willing to buy the really expensive cheese that might melt better.  It was gritty, and flavorless.  I followed the recipe to a T, except for adding more garlic.  Too heavy, and you do not need all of that parmesean.

Gourmet at home!! I can't believe I made this!! Fantastic recipe. I used minced garlic, and only 1 1/4 cup shredded parm (because it was easier to grab a bag and it was pre measured. It still came out very creamy! And super FAST!! Excellent plain with pasta - I added shrimp and scallops and felt like I was at the Olive Garden! I plan to have a "make your own" dinner with family over and offer chicken, shrimp or scalops to go on linguine and this alfredo!

Tip I found for knowing when the parm is melted enough in the original cook time - lift the whisk out of the pan every minute or so and when it is no longer stringy it is fully incorporated. That's when it's the most creamy! 

Sauce will separate upon reheat but if you reheat it on its own (instead of on the pasta) you can whisk it back into a cream. On the pasta you get clumps and oils, but the flavor remains! I reheated mine on low heat and stirred with a whisk until it came back together and it was just like the first day! DEE-LISH!!

Great recipe, especially for a quick dinner fix--I heated up two cans precooked, cubed chicken breast in a little bit of olive oil and a clove of garlic, then removed it from the pan and made double the sauce.  I added the chicken back in along with the parsley after adding the cheese (I used fresh parmesean and it was great) and garlic, and continued to simmer while stirring for about five more minutes.  The result was a great sauce!

I didn't have any trouble getting the cheese to melt. However, I did discover that eating promptly is a must as the sauce will not sit long before turning rather gluey on the noodles! Eat fast and you'll be fine! :)

Very yummy. I made this as a last minute supper. I didn't have cream, so I used milk, which, of course made for a bit of a thinner sauce, but it still worked out well. I think the amount of parmesan cheese that the recipe calls for helps to thicken it a great deal. Will definately make this again.

I had an idea of the kind of dish I wanted to fix, so this is what I did.  I cut up 2 chicken breasts into chunks and sauteed them until done in a pan.  I added steamed broccoli and 2 sliced green onions to the chicken and then poured this Alfredo sauce over it.  I doubled the sauce.  I didn't use as much parmeasan, but I did thicken the sauce slightly with a little flour and water.  It was DELICIOUS and there was hardly any left overs.  I also didn't use the heavy cream, but I used half and half instead.  I've finally found the Chicken and Broccoli Alfredo I've been looking for and it's as good as anything you'll ever get in a restaurant.  Thanks for the inspiration.

I used Kraft Shredded Parmesan, little flakes of it in a clear tupperware container and dumped the whole thing in. Melted evenly and the taste was better than I expected for Kraft, in case anyone is looking for an afforbale alternative to the shaker-parmesan cheese.

Not sure if it was the parmesan cheese or what but it was so strong in taste.  I mean in a bad way!! I couldn't finish my plate and niether could the kids!  We love alfredo and I wanted to find a simple recipe that I could make for me and the kids and this just didn't do it.

this is one of those things you need to "adjust to taste". Needed a bit more zip for me/added some fresh ground black pepper....but that is a small thing. Since the parm cheese is the primary flavor you really do have to use real/decent Parm cheese....not the gritty, salty sawdust the Kraft can passes off as Parm cheese. PS: made an awesome pesto sauce from this base by adding a second garlic clove and 2 TB of pesto sauce...

7.17.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/22831/alfredo-sauce/ ... Wayyyyyyyyyyy too much Parmesan.  I used the bagged shredded kind & it wouldn't blend/melt with the heavy cream & butter.  It was too strong a Parmesan cheese flavor to be good.  It really isn't Alfredo if you use Gruyere cheese.  Misleading recipe.  Gruyere would melt better, but also tastes mild & not like Parmesan.  I say we vote this one off the island.  :D

I must have done something wrong... I wound up with a lump of melted cheese and milky butter.  I used milk instead of cream, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly, even adding the cheese in small doses as the other reviewers suggested.  Maybe you just need to add the cheese one pinch at a time.  I'll use a different recipe next time, though I may be scared off from alfredo for a while!

I just made this tonight for me and my hubby.  He loved it!  I used 1/2 n 1/2 instead of heavy cream and it turned out pretty good.  Not as thick as I wanted but the flavor was still all good.  I think this will become my new alfredo sauce!!

I've made this recipe twice thus far, only changing the garlic to powdered garlic and adding a bit of white pepper and salt to taste.  I used the shredded Parmesan that comes in the bag at the grocery store and it melted perfectly after about 3 minutes of whisking.  I get amazing oohs and ahhs each time.  This is the greatest alfredo recipe I've made and I will continue to make it (or at least use it as a base) from now on.

Yummy! I loved it and it was truly loved by my father and husband and my children. We all love flavor and spice and this was not lacking at all. I sauteed chicken in extra virgin olive oil, basil, oregano, ground black pepper, kosher salt and crushed garlic. I steamed brocoli until still tender and bright green. I diced fresh tomatoes and mixed all these together then topped w/ your deliciously rich sauce and ate with linguini that I boiled in evoo and oregano leaves : ) It was delish! I guess if people think your dish is bland they have to find a way to liven things up expecially when you're an "expert" cook : )

Mmm, this was absolutely divine! It was all cheesy, creamy and fragrant, and I had no problems with the clumping. It is very thick, so it's very important to serve it right off of the stovetop.

This is delish! My husband cannot stand parmesan cheese, and he loved this! Our kids had nothing left in their plate too! My only adjustment was a pinch of nutmeg, salt and white pepper.

I served it with Chicken tenders cut up and pasta.

Very simple not to get it clumpy, just ad the cheese slowly. Mmmmmmm Good!

OMG!  This was outstanding!!!  The only change I made was to add a little more garlic.  This is not a low-fat meal, but it was high on taste!  We would have given it 10 stars if possible!!  *Note-  Make sure you use fresh grated parmesan cheese, NOT the stuff in a can.  It totally wrecks this awesome dish.  Splurge a little and get the fresh!

This rich flavorful sauce made a nice addition to the Basil Chicken posted by Wendy on this site. Thanks Rebecca! This will be the Alfredo Sauce of choice in this house from now on. And it won't be used only on pasta!

Very good.  Way too much cheese.  As other reviewers point out how gooey it gets, keep in mind that 1 cup of parm should be sufficient.

Keep Stirring.  :)

I just made this again last night. It is so good. I cooked some spinach and mushrooms and put it on lasagne noodles rolled them up and topped them with sauce and then baked. My bunko group loved it. If you grate the parmesson real fine it melts better. Came back to this recipe many years later than this review. Just to double check before i made again since my Son now decided he likes alfredo. This time i made it with the heavy cream ( like it calls for ha ha) instead of milk and wow liked it so much better. Thanks

This is great! We microwaved it, and it was fine except that the cheese didn't
melt completely. I am twelve years old, I cooked this, and it was wonerful. A
tasty foolproof recipe.

I found that if I added some marachino cherries to this, it tasted quite bit better.  If you like it sweet, add another cup of brown sugar.  I like to serve this with raspberry jello shots and jungle punch for added effect!

This is my go to recipe. I have been making it for about 7 years. The only thing I do different is I add black pepper. Quick, easy and very good.

Quick, easy, flavorful, what's not too like? Some people have mentioned a few problems with this recipe, cheese not melting, cheese separating, too thick, and too thin. Here's a few fixes. Cheese not melting, try adding the cheese in 3-4 increments while whisking (not string). Cheese separating, you're cooking at too high a temp, cook no higher than low/med. Too thick, add a little of the pasta water. Too thin? The starch will thicken it when you add the pasta to it (remember this is not a sauce you ladle on like red sauce). Happy cooking :)

Very yummy, easy-to-make alfredo sauce. Note that the balance of cheese and cream is delicate - too much cream and the sauce is runny, too much cheese and the sauce is very thick. I usually don't measure exactly, but if I put in too much cheese, I balance it out with more cream.

This was very good.  To bring out the flavor of garlic, I chose to thinly slice, then slightly brown it the sauce pan with the butter. I did leave out the parsley and added black pepper to the mix.  I put the sauce on spinach fettucini nests, added steamed broccoli and kiebasa.  DD loved it and her guest who never had Alfredo before gobbled it up!

Last minute surfing and I chose to make this...it was fabulous! Super quick, didn't require many ingredients. I used string cheese in addition to cutting the parm in half (from a shaker!); also added some milk. Fed 6 over spaghetti, steamed broccolli and chicken..quick easy family meal!

A GREAT base recipe! Here's some things I've tried:
-more garlic, and add it right away with the butter so you really infuse that flavor
-onions, chives, and/or shallots
-peppers (you could even get crazy an add some spice!)
-salt, sea salt, seasoning salt, etc.
-black or white pepper
-paprika
-Italian blend seasonings
-a couple of different cheeses
-if you're eating it with shrimp, add a seafood seasoning blend.  Steak, a steak blend.  Chicken...you get the idea.
-whatever tastes good!
-and finally, a little flour to help thicken it up more.

Also, you can totally skip the parm and exchange it for cheddar and/or pepper jack and - ta da! - nacho cheese sauce! 

Remember: recipes are just GUIDELINES and meant to explore and have fun with! (And I learned that while in the USA!) ;)

This sauce was delicious! I added about a tablespoon of flour to the melted butter so that the sauce would be thicker. I also added 3 cloves of garlic (Hubby and I are garlic lovers!). I added a bit of fresh ground pepper as well. Since I'm in Italy, my parmesan cheese was of the highest quality, so the sauce was incredible. I had to forcefully take it away from hubby because he wouldn't stop eating! This is a keeper for sure.

Simply amazing! I had an inexplicable craving for fettuccine alfredo. I usually cook healthy, but sometimes you just have to give into those cravings. I doubled the garlic and like another reviewer suggested, whisked the entire 5 minutes of simmering to prevent the sauce from separating. I used parmesan cheese and the sauce came out pretty thick, but that was easily remedied by adding a touch more cream. We topped this off with "Marinated Grilled Chicken II" from this site and a salad and it was a wonderful meal!

This is a GREAT recipe.  If it is too salty you used SALTED butter, use unsalted.  The trick to successfully making any alfrado is SLOWLY adding the ingredients. First slighly warming the milk in the microwave and SLOWLY adding teh milk so it absorbs and is combined before added me.  Then add the cheese a teaspoon at a time. IF you add it too quickly it will cling together... Also, adding a little of your pasta water wil thicken it up from the strach and give it an authentic taste. I add Sundried tomatoes and Pinenuts. ITs a great recipe but it

I bought wrong thing and used 1/2 and 1/2.
Didn't have fresh garlic had to use the bottles stuff. Too much cheese fell into pot so mine was way too thick. But everyone just loved it!!! Will adjust and make again :)

This is my "go-to" recipe for Alfredo Sauce.  It's ready in a jiffy.  I don't know how it could be any better, so I'm sticking with this beauty.  MY TIP:  Don't turn the stove up too high when making this sauce.  Nothing worse than curdled Alfredo!

Totally bland.  I only used this recipe because I couldn't find the recipe booklet that came with my magic bullet.  I ended up using pepper, at leave 5 more cloves of garlic and more parm cheese.  
I blend it all in my magic bullet, then take off the top and microwave for a minute, then blend, then microwave and so on until I get smooth consistency.
My kids did like it though.

Made this exactly as written. I found the parmesan to be a bit too powerful, next time I'll use white cheddar with just a bit of parm. The consistency was perfect though, and I will definitely be making this again. Quick and easy, thank you for posting :)

You can't beat the combination of quick, easy, and sooooooooooo good.  A wee bit of chives is a nice addition but it's fine without it too.  I agree with some other suggestions about the cheese to use.  Shaved, shredded, or even better buy a block and grate it yourself.  But if all you have is the kind in the shaker can use it, it still tastes wonderful.
Thanks so much for sharing.

I tripled the recipe hoping I would have enough sauce for a large casserole with 1 1/2 lbs of rotini. Thankfully it was. I used half n half,  2 1/2 tsp of chopped garlic and 1/8 cup of dried parsley. I had to thicken as it was too thin. Tasted very rich & delicious. I may try a lower fat milk next time.

This was incredibly tasty and incredibly easy.  I loved it.  A lot.  I've never made "real" Alfredo sauce before.  I want to try this again with some grilled chicken.

I use this recipe ANY time I need a good cream sauce.  There isnt too much cheese, it's very light tasting with a heavy feeling, as alfredo sauce should be.  It makes a lovely addition to any pasta.  Thank you!

LOVED THIS RECIPE!  I added white pepper and omitted the parsley.  So simple to make your own!  I tried some in a jar and they always tasted awful....so I would have to wait till we went out to eat to have a good alfredo sauce.  Now I will be making mine all the time!

Good recipe, but maybe the parm cheese I used was to pungent because it overwhelmed the dish.  I think next time I'll just use a cup of cheese.

Wonderful! My husband is very picky and he loved this sauce! Also, my mother-in-law was over for dinner when I made this and raved about it! She even asked for the leftovers for lunch the next day! The only thing I changed: left out the parsley, added a quick sprinkle of nutmeg, and I bought a wedge of extra aged parmesan and finely shredded it. (added it by small handfuls to ensure even melting) Perfect!

I am surprised to read that some reviewers found the sauce too runny.  I have made this sauce 3 times in the past couple of weeks (it's THAT good!!) and all 3 times, I had to add more cream after whisking in the cheese because it was just too THICK!  I may experiment with using less cheese in the future, but either way, this recipe is AMAZINGLY delicious!  **UPDATE** I tried making this thinner by adding less cheese, but it was not flavorful enough.  I will just continue to add a little cream as needed after whisking in the cheese.  I also add black pepper.

Made this sauce for the kiddos over top of a whole grain Buitoni pasta. A bit too thick with the amount of cheese. I'd put 1 1/4 cup next time, rather than 1 1/2 cup like the recipe suggests. Overall, a wonderful, quick alfredo sauce! It's in my recipe box!

Liked this because it didn't have flour in it. Good flavor on basic recipe. Jazzed it up some after initial recipe with pepper cause we like a lot and some shredded cheeses. We like a lot of sauce! Agree that fresh shredded parm makes world of difference.

I've tried this recipe with heavy cream, light cream, milk, and various Parmesan cheeses. I prefer the light cream with a nutty, hand grated Parmesan. My experience with Kraft and other pre-grated Parmesans have made the sauce less flavorful and the texture gloopy.

I have made this sauce about 5 times now, and its WONDERFUL. The first time I made it I thought it didnt quite have enough spice to it (I grew up in a garlic type family) so I added 4 cloves of garlic instead of 1, and I still do. As well, the sauce itself when made directly from the recipe may be too thick to serve right away...after I mix the Parmesan in with the butter and cream and let it melt, I add a little milk and stir, and continue to add milk until the consistancy is better...it doesnt take away from the flavor and makes this dish PERFECT. If that doesnt jive you, you could try adding a little less parmesan and add the left over to the top of your pasta dish when its done. 

Also, I got requests to instead add the parsley as a garnish on top, instead of inside the meal itself, I do that as well.

Amazing sauce!! I made exactly as written, except I added a dash more cream because not all of the cheese was melting and it was getting a little thick, and I didn't add parsley, just a personal preference; who would want to ruin a perfectly great white sauce with specks of green? Not my taste, but anyways thanks so much!! I have no need for any other alfredo, this is the best!

It just wasn't that good for me. I changed the cheese, as recommended by the author, so maybe I just didn't like the cheese. I would prolly try it again though, with the right cheese.

OH MY...I can't believe how awesome this recipe was...easy and delish. I doubled the recipe, but I didn't double the parmesan part, and It was perfect. I've tried the recipe with the cream cheese that has the most ratings and this one tastes way better.

Very yummy!!  Was very rich, so you don't need a lot on your pasta!  I did find that the Parmesan didn't melt that great either, leaving a gritty texture, but the taste was wonderful!!

I made a slimmed down version and it was excellent!!  Used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of butter.  Substituted No Fat Milk for the cream.  Kicked the garlic up a notch.  Have served it over penne, rotini and grouper.  Am making some right now for dinner!

I gave it 5 stars but I made a few changes out of necessity. First, I only had half and half and about 3/4 cup of parmesan cheese. I accidentally added the garlic WITH the cream, but it tasted great. I brought it almost to a boil and stirred constantly for about 5 minutes.  Also, before I added the cheese, I beat an egg yolk and tempered it by adding a couple of tablespoons of the hot cream mixture to the yolk while stirring it. (The egg yolk was part of another alfredo recipe I got from this site. It makes the sauce silky.). I then whisked it into the cream and added the cheese. I just realized that I forgot the parsley, lol!  It was SO good; my kids loved it. I used Rotini which was great because the sauce stuck to it really well. I would have used a little more cheese if I'd had it, but probably not all 1.5 cups. Thanks, Rebecca!

Maybe the fresh parmesan really does make the difference. I used the packaged kind, and it didn't all melt properly. Still, the taste was good. Very rich.

This is a good base recipe. It definitely benefits from adding some white pepper.
I used half parmigiana reggiano and half Gruyere, and used 3 large garlic cloves. I also added a can of crab meat with the butter while it melted, then added raw shrimp at the end. 
I think next time I'll use more pepper (only used 1/4 tsp to start) and add some old bay.

This was a wonderful recipe. I did tweak it a bit. I used two cloves of garlic instead of one. I added a teaspoon of red pepper and and a teaspoon of garlic powder (just because it did need a bit extra flavor). I used 5 oz of shaved parmesan and slowly whisked it in and the sauce was thick and creamy. I added steamed broccoli and sautéed mushrooms to it and served it along side italian breadcrumb crusted pan fried chicken cutlets. I had enough to serve four (as a side) and some leftovers for the next day. Great recipe!

I really love this recipe. I use it more as a base since I add a lot more to it. Fresh basil, oregano, etc. I love black pepper so I add that along with vegetable bouillon for a deeper flavor, but of course meat eaters could use chicken bouillon or just already made broth. Sometimes I'll add fresh mozzarella to make the sauce thicker, but this is a great recipe just the way it is or spruced up. Thanks :)

Amazing! My bf and I LOVE Alfredo sauce and this recipe was perfect. I used light cream (5%) instead of heavy cream and 1/4 cup of dried parsley and 3 cloves of garlic. Only because be both love garlic. It turned out AMAZING! I too would give this 6 stars if I could.

I followed this recipe to a "T", and let me tell you... It's perfect just the way it is! I come to this website frequently and try new dishes all the time, and until I tried this recipe I have never had the urge to rate a recipe! Hubby and I will never eat store-bought or restaurant Alfredo again! Simple-- quick-- and easy! Three things that this new-mom love in a recipe! I am absolutely in love with this recipe! 

Per another reviewer-- I will try "fresh Parmesan" next time though! My Kraft Parmesan didn't melt down completely! :)

It had the basic ingredients, but knowing it would be too thin for my taste, I decided to add flour to the garlic/butter mixture.  Then add the cream.  I then needed to add more milk.  I also added pepper and a dash of nutmeg.

We loved this!  Make sure that this does not boil or it will separate and add the parmesan cheese a little at a time and stir often.  We don't put in the parsley because we don't care for it.  We also added cornstarch to thicken it.

Good standard recipe, but needs fresh ground black pepper.  I would suggest removing the sauce from the heat prior to adding the parmesan cheese, it will keep the sauce from becoming gritty.

Parmesean melts perfectly fine if you use fresh cheese that you grate yourself.  The pre-shredded cheese has preservatives and other additives which WILL change the viscosity and texture of the sauce.

This sauce is really good AS IS if you FOLLOW the directions.  DO NOT let it BOIL, as that will make your cheese GRITTY. DO stir pretty much continuously after adding the cheese, and keep the heat no higher than a simmer (simmering is when the sauce may have some small bubbles that gently rise and pop, but generally there is little to no bubbling).  DO use a whisk. 

I like to add a little romano cheese in addition to the parmesean for a subtle shift in flavor, and because I LOVE garlic, I use at least two cloves.  I rarely have fresh parsley but substitute dried and also like to add a pinch of nutmeg and sometimes a TINY bit of sauteed freshly minced onion.

Very easy and delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly, although I let the garlic simmer in the butter for a bit before adding the cream. I also added a small amount of chicken broth the second time I made it and I do think it made a difference in the flavor. Corn starch if it's too watery!

I made it as the recipe stated and it was bit "lumpy" but WAY better than anything out of jar!!  I will double it next time because one batch was not enough for the 4 of us! I didn't add the parsley into the sauce.  I sprinkled it on top because it's "green" and my kids have an aversion to green stuff :)

I added rosemary/oregano instead of fresh parsley, and used 1 cup of parmesan/asiago cheese instead of the amount in the recipe. This was fabulous. Will definitely be making it again.

This was fantastic! However, I used 3 tbsp of butter and 3/4 cup of 2% milk, 1/4 cup fat free 1/2 and 1/2 in place of heavy cream along with a tbsp of corn starch. This made it creamy and oh so delish! I will DEFINITELY make this sauce again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This made a beautiful dish but it was quite salty and cheesy thick. Maybe a little milk or extra cream would have been better.
* I made this again and it was absolutely delicious. Tastes a lot like the Alfredo sauce at Olive Garden. The Leftovers had me wanting breadsticks to dip in it. I added about a teaspoon of garlic and sauteed in the butter

Loved this recipe with a few minor changes...I doubled the garlic and added a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  I also thickened it up with a small amount of cornstarch/water mix...1 Tbsp did the trick!  It is better than Olive Garden, hands down!

Fantastic! This was soooo yummy! If you like Olive Garden's alfredo sauce, you will LOVE this!!! I was gifted with a beautiful pasta serving bowl for Christmas - and this gave me a chance to use it! While visiting family for Christmas, we made an AWESOME alfredo pasta dish for Ronald McDonald house (we volunteered to prepare dinner the day after Christmas). It was SO delicious, I've been craving it ever since! :) Rebecca's version is equally as good and TOTALLY hit the spot! Unfortunately, I had to make a few changes due to what I had on hand (my pantry was pretty bare since I had been gone for several days). Instead of fresh cheese and garlic, I substituted canned Parm and a t of powder. I also omitted the parsley alltogether. For what it's worth, my sister uses canned cheese and granulated garlic in her alfredo, but to be fair, I'll use the fresh stuff next time. :) Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Rebecca. I'll for sure make this again - and often! :-)

Would give it zero stars if I could.  Have no idea how everyone managed to get it creamy...the parmesan cheese ended up not blending at all and turned into one big glob.  Will not make this again!

This sauce was very good overall, but I did run into a problem with the cheese melting in smoothly. I used shredded and mixed asiago, romano and parmesean cheeses. I added musherooms to this recipe by request and it was a yummy addition. If you're making it with the same cheeses, allow about 30 munutes of time to get it successfully mixed in. I cannot afford some of the other cheeses mentioned by others that have reviewed as alternates for an easy-melting cheese.

Great recipe when you're looking for quick dinner ideas! I didn't have heavy cream, but I found an equivalent (1/3 c butter, 3/4 milk, 1 tbsp flour). Used 1 clove elephant garlic (which is about 2-3 cloves of regular garlic) and 3/4 c parmigiana. Much more cheese than that seemed to be too much. It came out thick, creamy and the SO loved it to pieces.

Would work great with a stronger cheese like Gruyere or even Gorgonzola if you're adventurous.

I made this twice. The first time i made it as written and the flavor was fantastic however the consistency was slightly thin for our liking until it cooled slightly, which caused it to thicken. The second time, i thickened with flour and it was too thick. In the future, i will just allow it to sit for a few minutes before serving

Delicious.  I used the Kraft Parmesan and it was gritty - next time I'll try fresh Parm.  The flavor was great and it was very simple.  After it was cooked I mixed it with cooked cheese tortillini, green peas, and chopped-up ham steak.  An very yummy one-pot meal. Served with sweet and spicy green beans from this site.

Couldn't go full 4 star because the final steps of perfect came from my last step modification. 

The only thing that went wrong with this recipe was that once the cheese melted it came out way to thick. I had to add almost 1/2C milk at the end to make it creamy. I also chopped up and wilted spinach to make it Spinach Alfredo. 

Other than that this recipe is amazingly good! My first attempt at an alfredo sauce and I loved it!!

This dish turned out very good.  I melted the butter and added extra garlic and cooked it for 2 minutes and then as another review suggested, i whisked in the cream, a little salt & pepper.  I  continued whisking for the 5 minutes and then whisked in the cheese a little at a time. Makes all the difference!  Thanks

I am very picky about my alfredo sauce and this is simple and amazing! And its even better left over for lunch the next day! Although make sure you finely grate the parm cheese.... If it's not fine it won't melt all the way and doesn't come out as good.

I don't know what I did wrong, but my sauce was too grainy and rich. The next day I added a little bit of chicken broth to it and it was a much better texture.

Heavenly, To lighten it up a little, I used half and half and some chicken stock thickened with corn starch, and no one knew the difference!!!  So good served with grilled chicken breasts and Byrdhouse Blistered Cherry Tomatoes from this site…OUT OF THIS WORLD!

I like that this recipe is easy, and it did taste good, but I was not a fan of the consistency.  The parmesan did not melt well and left kind of a grainy consistency.  I like my sauce much smoother than this came out. I also added milk as this came out super thick after I added the cheese.  I prefer the Quick and Easy Alfredo recipe from this website, but taste-wise after tweaking, this is a close second. I will probably make again if short on time.

I'd give 10stars if I could. This is the best Alfredo sauce ever. I use to make one with cream cheese but this is SO much better, it's so creamy. I use garlic powder versus clove.... So yummy over a hot bed of any pasta and bread chicken breasts! Olive Garden, watch out!!

I will make it again!  I used Best Life Margarine instead of butter, 2% Milk instead of heavy cream and 2 cloves of garlic instead of one.  I see some reviewers mentioned adding corn starch if they use milk the next time they make it.  There is NO NEED to add corn starch, just cook it a little longer before and after the addition of the cheese while stirring constantly with a whisk.  That's what I did and it turned out beautifully.

As mentioned by a couple of reviewers, I used GRATED cheese and thought the texture was a bit grainy (and no, I didn't break my sauce!).  As a couple other reviewers mentioned, I think I will use 1 cup Gruyère and 1/2 cup of a shredded Parm instead.  I am not a huge fan of the Olive Garden Alfredo, it's a bit too salty for my taste, so I feel using the Gruyère will tame the salt a bit.  (Then I can add some bacon or pancetta too!).  Enjoy!  This is a winner sauce.  Thank you to it's author!

Yum!  I added cajun spiced chicken breast and fettucini.  I doubled the recipe to get enough  to cover one box of fettucine with about two  lbs of blackened chicken.

I guess I just expected more. From the reviews it made it sound outta-this-world good. It was okay. My family never ate the leftovers, which is always a sign! I made it as written but added extra garlic, pepper and nutmeg.

This was good, but not great. I prefer a much richer alfredo.

I tried it with the powdered cheese. It still came out alright but I recommend cutting the amount down to a cup because the cheese is more tightly packed so the cheese in a cup and a half is too concentrated.

I've tried numerous alfredo recipes.  This one is the best!  Easy and so delicious.  (Not low fat, though!) I added fresh peas straight from the garden, along with cracked pepper on top.

I will never buy Jar stuff again. I used this recipe as a base for the sauce and added chives, extra garlic, mushrooms, chicken, and finally some dill. I loved it. I do however need to start using alternatives to cream and butter.

I make this at least once a month. I serve it over chicken breast and rotoni noodles. I found that heavy cream is too much so use half and half instead. Everyone in my house loves this!

This alfredo sauce was very easy to make, and  very flavorful. It tasted just like ordering in a restaurant.  We sauted some shrimp in butter and garlic and tossed in.  Very good!

What the heck?  I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with what looked like curdled cheese in a bath of melted butter.  I poured it over pasta and shrimp, and the melted clumpy parmesan coated the shrimp while the buttery liquid drained through the collander.  What a waste of time/money.

Hubby and I love this! I made this last nite for dinner. I did add more garlic though. About 1-2 cloves depending on how much you like garlic. Also, make sure you use FRESH GRATED  parmesan cheese or it will not melt all the way and settles at the bottom of the pan as soon as you stop whisking it. I also added some steamed broccoli and cubed cooked ckicken. Wonderful!

From your lips to your hips lol, This was GREAT! Oh and how easy it truly was, Just follow the directions, they are perfect. First I sauted some BLSL chicken in butter and minced garlic, then I melted the butter slowly, added the cream and whisked until it started to simmer. Then I added the parm handful by handful, and it melted beautifully. Some people said their sauce separated, mine never did. It is DELICIOUS! Thank you ?

I made this with fat free half & half to cut back on fat & calories. It was still tasty, but a little thin. I'd also cut back on the parm next time or use a blend so it's a little creamier. All in all, this is a great, easy recipe!

As a newbie to cooking I'm hesitant to rate a recipe, but I have eaten more than my share of Alfredo at dozens of restaurants.  This recipe is quite possible the best I have had.  I have modified it some because I don't like garlic or parsley.  The first time I made it I used a little garlic salt in place of garlic.  The results were outstanding!  But it still had the garlic taste that I do not care for.  Another time I left it out all together.  The recipe seemed lacking.   Last night I added sun dried tomatoes.  I have never dried tomatoes before, it took almost 20 hours in the oven!  Next time I'll just buy some, I can't even imagine what my electric bill will be.  My wife and I don't like biting in to chunks of sun dried tomato, so I ground it almost to a paste in a food processor.    With that, I have the best Alfredo I have ever had.  It might be important to mention that I made the pasta fresh, and added charbroiled chicken.  So my modified recipe: 1/4 cup butter 1 cup heavy cream 1/4 cup (rough estimate) ground up sun dried tomatoes. 1 1/2 cups freshly grated parmesan cheese.  The directions are the same, I added the chicken and tomatoes after the cheese was mixed in.  ~Jay

Simply Amazing. Ended up subbing Heavy Cream for Cream Cheese (it's cheaper) and adding 1 1/2 c. milk to thin it out a bit for a bigger group. We also added some sun-dried tomato which gave it a nice color and a nice taste. It was amazing! I will be making this a lot.

Very good alfredo sauce, and easy too! I doubled the recipe and had to use light cream because I had a pint I needed to use before it spoiled. I used a bit less cheese though, and this sauce still turned out super thick. I used freshly grated parmesan which is very important, do not use the grated cheese that comes in the container. My boyfriend said this tasted just like Olive Garden's sauce which he loves. I used Farfalle pasta (bowties) and topped with Quorn brand vegetarian chicken cutlets. This was an excellent meal. I will use this recipe again for sure. We really like the addition of the garlic also. Thanks for sharing :)

Great! I wanted a simple, basic cream sauce recipe for my basic pasta tonight and this one came up, and was perfect. I didn't have parsley, but it was still great. I think I would add a bit more cream and a bit less parmesan cheese. Gruyere would be an excellent alternative as well, I think. I added some pepper, mixed some bits of broccoli and chopped chives when I put the garlic and cheese in, tossed it with some kamut spaghetti, et voila! A perfect, I'm poor-I have nothing in the fridge-meal.

Just what I needed. I'm trying to cut back on our pizza budget and make it at home. I used this alfredo recipe as a base for a Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza. I sauteed some chopped onion in with the garlic and butter and when the sauce was ready, I added in the dry spice from my own ranch dressing dry mix and bacon. This DID need a little more half-n-half, it was a little thick. Next time I use this for pizza, I'll thin it out even more. It was real thick and rich, a little overkill. Worked out great, though!

This is THE BEST alfredo sauce recipe. I will not ever make another one. The key is to buy the cheese in a block and shred it off yourself. A little work but it's well worth it.

I love alfredo sauce and was so excited to try this out, but it was incredibly bland to me. The parmesan wouldn't melt. I'll try this again, but maybe with the Gruyere cheese others have suggested.

Great recipe, I use it over and over. If I don't have cream I use milk and just add a little bit of flour when my butter melts to make the sauce thick.

I have reviewed  quite a few alfredo recipes here with good ratings, HOWEVER I do know that this is a true restaurant style alfredo sauce, and I don't mean the ol' olive garden close to the mall.. I mean a quality Italian restaurant. to make alfredo, most chefs simply melt butter, add cream, maybe garlic, toss in real Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, toss in fresh pasta & serve... the cheese melts as it sits in the hot pasta.

Grating your own fresh parmesan is the KEY to a SMOOTH sauce! The only sub I made was using half 'n half. I love recipes that only have a few ingrediants in them, as "less is more" prevails! Just wonderful and easy!  Thanks!

All together this was too much.  The cream should have been half and half, and cut in half and mixed with an equal part of chicken broth.  That not only adds to the flavor, but will cut down on that buttery fatty taste in your mouth afterwards.  Also, cut the butter in half and add flour to make a roux.  Then add another soft dairy product, cream cheese, preferably neufchatel, perhaps a half of a block.  Add that to the roux, then the garlic, then the liquid, then the parsley, only don't add so much.  Parsley is an herb that pulls together flavors, not one that stars on its own.  That's why is the most popular GARNISH, not the most popular spice, salt, which isn't in this recipe, which was okay by me.

I didn't have any parsley, but this sauce turned out amazing anyway!  The only things I did different were add freshly ground pepper (I love pepper in my alfredo sauce) and extra garlic.  Easy and delicious!

Very good recipe. Excellent taste, nice consistency, overall an excellent sauce. About my only two recommendations would be to add a 2nd clove of garlic and sautee them to really release the flavors before adding them to the sauce. 2nd would be to maybe add a slight amount of cream cheese to the mixture, about 2-3 tablespoons just to give it a little more smoother, velvety appearence. GREAT JOB =)

In my on-going quest to eliminate all processed and pre-packaged foods from my home, I decided to make my own alfredo sauce. This recipe was wonderful! It was so rich and creamy and the taste was fantastic. I used Parmesan that was pre-grated at the store and it didn't melt very well. I think I'll either try to grate my own or try Rebecca's suggestion of substituting Gruyere cheese next time. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe! UPDATE: I tried this recipe again grating my own Parmesan cheese and it came out perfect! Great recipe - so quick and easy!

ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING! I ADDED MORE CHEESE AND GARLIC, But the recipe Doubled perfectly the first time- added 2 Lbs 21-30  Shrimps, (Sautee'd in garlic and herbs with a little Olive oil first!) 

3 lbs of Pasta later, Not a drop left -AND NO ONE COULD GET UP FROM THE TABLE!

This sauce was delicious! I added two cloves of garlic, used real parmesan cheese from Italy (well worth the little extra it may cost) and included fresh mushrooms. The secret is constant whisking!

The flavor was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, using freshly grated Parmegiano Reggiano.  The sauce was very smooth, but I should have made a bit ahead and allowed to cool as I prefer a sauce a bit thicker than this turned out to be.  I will make again but next time prepare ahead of time and use an extra clove of garlic and finish with freshly ground black pepper.

Mmmmm! I couldn't stop 'taste testing' this sauce while I was cooking dinner; it is so rich and delicious. I did skip the parsley because I was making this sauce to use in a recipe which had plenty in it already (Crab Stuffed Manicotti, from this site). I guess I should have taken the advice of the recipe submitter because I did use shredded parmesan and it really didn't melt all that nicely. So my sauce was a little lumpy, but who really cares when it tastes so awesome? :)

Used 1/2 cup less cheese, a pinch of salt, half-n-half instead of cream and twice as much minced garlic instead of cloves. This was fantastic!

I didn't have Parmesan, so I used Romano, and the recipe was pretty cheesy, but it was good!  Used it on Portabello ravioli.  Also, I didn't have enough cream, so I used 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup whole milk, and it turned out plenty creamy.

Pretty darn good!  Simple and fast to make.  Next time I'll use unsalted butter.  I found it a bit salty.  Kids loved it.  Added some nutmeg also.

An excellent recipe. the sauce came out thick and creamy and tasting better than any other Alfredo sauce I have ever had. I followed the recipe but did add one more clove of garlic only because we are all garlic fanatics here! I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is delicious! I used this sauce and added browned CHICKEN, WHITE WINE, and SUN DRIED TOMATOES. Also! I used grated pecorino/Romano cheeses. I let it cook an additinal 20 minutes and had to add a little extra cheese to thicken it up. MAGNIFICO! Tasted like it was restauravt quality! 5* no doubt

Why buy canned sauce when delicious sauce is this easy to make?

I made this last night and it was wonderful.  I used a bag of grated parmesan cheese, and didn't have any problems with clumping after I heated it long enough to melt it completely.

Rave reviews from my boyfriend too.

Not being an Italian I alway just went with the bottled sauce.....never again. 
This was so easy and good. I couldn't believe it. Even made for a pizza sauce. 
Great and yes use fresh the fresh cheese not canned.

Nothing about this recipe melts well, I had to add so many things to it just to get it back on track so I wouldn't waste what little ingredients that I had on hand at all.
I'll surly try another alfredo recipe instead of this one.

Very good. Was definitely a bit too thick so either add extra cream or milk to thin it out and have extra sauce or just cut back on the cheese some.

WOW!  This recipe was superb!  I made it for a pary, and used half shredded parm (already shredded from Costco) and half gruyere cheese and it melted immediately.  It took awhile to thicken-up, but actually got thicker after I poured it over the Penne pasta.  We prepared blackened salmon and placed on top of the pasta- delicious!

Amazing.. This recipe has become my go to whenever I want a delicious alfredo sauce.  This recipe is quick, easy and amazingly tasty.  Whenever I'm in a hurry I'll substitute an Italian Cheese Blend for the Parmesan because it usually melts more easily.  For some fun with this recipe, try it on a pizza instead of using pizza sauce, it makes the most delicious pizza.  Overall though, this is a wonderful recipe and the flavor is even better than some restaurant recipes.

I couldn't find any gruyere cheese, so I used parmesan.  The cheese didn't melt and it was very gritty.  As for the taste, pure parmesan cheese.  I even added extra garlic and a nice pinch of nutmeg and couldn't taste anything but the cheese.  This recipe was a big dissapointment.

Wonderful recipe. I eliminated the milk altogether and used 1 cup heavy cream, a little more garlic as we are huge garlic fans, and also more parmesan. Very good.... we barely had enough left for pasta as everyone kept dipping their breadsticks. Thanks so much for sharing. This is definitely a family favorite.

This was outstanding!  So few ingredients, yet it made a meal that you could find in a restaurant.  It was creamy and rich and the whole family loved it.  I added the cheese a little at a time, while whisking constantly and it worked very well.  Do not skimp and go for less fat...go for the fat!  You deserve it once in a while ;)

Very Good!!!  I have tried other alfredo sauces and it never turns out the way I had expected.  I added cooked chicken and spinach to the sauce....Wonderful.

Made this with a blackened chicken recipe I found on the site and was good.  I couldn't taste the garlic, so next time I will add at least 2 cloves of garlic.  Also I suggest chopping parsley very fine.  Tastes better.

Excellent alfredo sauce! If you have ever heard of "Blackened Chicken Alfredo" from TGI FRidays, I tried to replicate it today using this as the sauce. Upon finding a blackened chicken recipe, I made the noodles and this sauce (the minced garlic and a little more of it is a MUST). I poured this sauce over the noodles, spinkled some diced pimentos and minced green onions and placed the blackened chicken on top. WOW! Not only did it look gourmet but tasted just as good. Its only too bad this recipe is SOO unhealthy for you but caution was thrown to the wind today and my boyfriend and I ate this lunch. Every bite was worth it. Thanks Rebecca for the great alfredo sauce!

Excellent sauce.  I will never use canned Alfredo sauce again.  To make chicken Alfredo, marinade boneless skinless chicken breasts in Italian salad dressing, then cook the chicken on a George Forman grill.  To serve, cut chicken in pieces and serve over fettucine & Alfredo sauce.  Better than Olive Garden.

Very, very, very, very good!!!!!!  The only thing I would change is maybe a little bit less garlic. I poured sauce over fettucini noodles and added blackened chicken sliced on top (recipe also on allrecipes.com). My husband raved over it.  Yummy.

this sauce came out great the first time i ever tried it, and everyone loved it. a very yummy sauce if you don't mind the zillion calories and fat. i did find that it didn't re-heat well though - when i stored some for my lunch the next day, the sauce went runny when heated in the microwave.

This was excellent!! I added some farmers cheese because Gruyere was a bit pricey for me, but it worked out very well. I also added some chopped mushrooms and a 1/8 cup of parmesan cheese. It couldn't have been better for dinner!!! thanks for sharing! We will definitely eat this again!

Very good! Quick and easy.  I used garlic powder as I never seem to have fresh garlic around.  I also added a dash of each of nutmeg and chili powder, two alfredo sauce must-haves. Great with sauteed mushroom and chicken.

Great recipe--Easy to make with great reviews from the family.  I added a fresh seafood medley mix from my grocer.  I added the seafood at the end and cooked 2-3 minutes more.  Don't overcook the seafood or it will be tough.

The taste was okay, but it definitely wasn't alfredo.  Perhaps a different name would be more appropriate.

MMMMM. I poured this over fetticini and baked stuffed swordfish.  I always 
get seafood alfredo when dining out and I must say this was my favorite
and beat all the rest.  I used a little more heavy cream and cracked pepper 
taste.  This recipe is a keeper

I just used this sauce to make Chicken Alfredo Pizza, and it was amazing!  This sauce is what made my pizza a total success.  My father in law went to a very expensive restaurant earlier today, with very good food.  When we had the pizza I made, he said that it was even better than at the restaurant.  Again... this sauce made it happen!  It's *SO* easy to make!  I added just a little bit of flour to make it thicker.  I will keep this recipe forever, and pass it on!

Immediately after beginning this recipe I had thought that I made a grave mistake and had bit off much more than I could chew. However after mildly shredding my thumb along with the Parmesan and ultimately deciding "chopped" was close enough to "shredded", I made it through and decided this was definitely worth the minor blood loss. I also added broccoli, spinach, and chicken to the sauce as well as using part gruyere cheese and put it over a 3-cheese ravioli. Note: if you bleed on the cheese do not use that cheese, dispose of it and plan ahead by purchasing a bit extra cheese.

This is my standard alfredo recipe. In order to get good results you ABSOLUTELY MUST use fresh grated cheese! Preshredded packaged cheese and the stuff in the green can have added ingredients that make the sauce clump and taste gritty. This is a good basic method for any cheese sauce. You can change up the cheese with cheddar and pour over macaroni, add emmental and gruyere and enjoy a swanky fondu. In every instance, you MUST use freshly grated cheese.

My family loves this recipe. I doubled it and used 6-8 cloves of garlic, instead of one. I had to use dried parsley, obviously in a smaller amount (like 2tsp). It was easy and turned out great after I added the extra garlic. I served it on fetticine. With a ceasar salad and garlic bread, it was like eating at a restaurant. :)

I made Chicken Alfredo with this sauce and it was a big hit. The sauce was very thick so I added an additional 1/2 cup of heavy cream and it turned out velvety smooth. I also added the Parmesan in half cups increments so that it would melt evenly. The jarred sauces are so full of preservatives and I'd rather do without them. After finding this recipe there's no need to resort to jarred Alfredo sauce again.

I substituted half and half for heavy cream and used 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 parm, as that was all I actually had on hand. After quite a bit of whisking, it came out AMAZINGLY! Better than any thing I've ever gotten out of a jar! Thanks for posting this one!

It was very tasty. Much different from a jar type.   I sauteed a can of mushrooms, chopped them and added to the sauce.  They made it even better.

Yes. Yes. Yes. Finally! I did a double batch of this and realized when I got home I didn't have enough parmesan. But I did have mozzarella and it worked beautifully. I added my garlic right away when I added the cream and let it simmer. After I melted the cheese I added both white and black pepper with my parsley. Cooked for my mom and she said "This isn't good... it's phenomenal! " I will NEVER pay for Olive Garden's Alfredo again!

I just finished making this and I thought it was delicious! I added a little basil, some garlic salt, lemon zest, pepper, and fresh lemon juice. It completely brought it all together!

Made this last night and it was excellent with this substitution: one cup of grated mixed Romano/Parmesan (Kraft) and a half a cup of higher quality grated Pecorino Romano cheese that I brought back from Italy. You could get a similar quality of cheese from any good deli in the States.  Romano cheese is sharper and much more flavorful than Parmesan. The sauce was excellent just with that substitution, but then I also added some morel mushrooms and topped with cooked crumbled bacon (didn't have prosciutto - ham would have worked well, too) and it was incredible. The quality of the cheese you add is the key to this recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. I was skeptical of which recipe to choose but I'm glad I went with this one. I'm a fiend for chicken Alfredo at Olive Garden, I never order anything different so I'm glad I now know how to make something that tastes almost identical! My only complaint is the chicken I bought from the store to go in it sucked but the sauce definitely made up for it. Can't wait for my boyfriend to come home and eat it.

Some changes I made were by adding salt, pepper, cayenne, chili powder, baby portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, and some milk. Also, instead of just using parmesan cheese, I added four other kinds of cheese (asiago, romano, mozzarella, & provolone).

This is an outstanding and simple recipe.  The only change I make is to use 50% Danish Esrom as well as the Parmesan.  Esrom is an acquired taste, but really adds to the sauce.

This was my fist time making Alfredo sauce from scratch. I LOVED it! So much better than the jars of sauce I had been buying. I was super impressed with how easy it was to make. Will make again!!

This is a great, simple recipe. BUT, switch out the Parmesan for freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese and the results are PHENOMENAL! The Parmesan makes the sauce much too cheesy & thick, but the Pecorino Romano blends so well with the sauce, you can hardly feel it. Make the change and trust me, you will be pleased with the difference!

Cooked as directed except I had about a third less Parmesan than was called for; however, it was still wonderful. Served as a chicken Alfredo over fettuccini noodles...and the crowd roared. ;-)

This was delicious! With a little bit of linguini and spinach, it was the perfect quick dinner fix. And to lighten it up some, I left out the cream and used whole milk instead. Still very tasty! Will try adding chicken and broccoli next time for a whole new taste

A nice basic recipe but I added extra garlic and some fresh ground salt and pepper. You can also add/substitute any hard good-quality cheese (I added some Welsh cheddar) to give it a little more kick. Served over zucchini "pasta" it was terrific!

I just tried this recipe, but with a few changes. First of all, its bad idea to simmer the sauce then add the parmesan at the end because it wont have enough time to melt, so I added everything in one go: garlic, parmesan, parsley at the very beginning before simmering the sauce then I simmered it all together. Came out great! Additionally, I added cooked chicken breast to make it a chicken alfredo sauce next to some pasta.

Easy and delicious. Instead of parsley, I added chopped spinach and grilled chicken breast. Everyone loved it over noodles. Leftover sauce tasted like spinach dip we ate with tortilla chips. Yummy!!!

Although the taste was great, the cream and butter split, ultimately leaving me with bits of Alfredo rather than an Alfredo sauce. As suggested by a reviewer, I tried whisking throughout and still had no luck. I'd suggest adding a bit of white pepper and salt.

My family loves this recipe. 5 stars, 2 thumbs up!

Tip: I have used assorted cheeses such as Parmesan, Mozzarella,Cheddar,...

Tip: Eat sauce with stuffed crab or lobster pasta and drink white wine with this meal. 

Double thumbs up and stars.

Fantastic! This is some of the best Alfredo sauce I've ever tastes! My husband and 3 year old son loved it too! Only thing my hubby requested was more garlic, so I may use 2 cloves next time. Quick, easy and delicious. This recipe is a keeper!

This was a good start.  I knew from reading the recipe that it didn't have enough garlic for my family so I chose to use 3-cloves.  That's a personal preference so I did not ding the recipe for that.  However, even using the heavy cream the sauce did come out very thin.  I mixed a little (1 heaping teaspoon) of corn starch to a little water and added it the sauce.  It only took a minute or so at a slow simmer for the sauce to thicken right up.  I also added a teaspoon of black pepper (again personal preference).  Since you can not allow a cream sauce to boil, I also think it best to add the garlic when melting the butter and allow it to sauté for 2 or 3 minutes.

This is almost like mine I have been cooking since I learned it from my grandmother at 10 (39 years ago). She started with butter added red pepper flakes, white pepper and garlic with the butter. She then added 1/2 and 1/2 and used about 1/4 cup of the pasta water to thicken it better and keep it thick longer. Sprinkle with flat leaf parsley.

Perfect just the way it is!  I served this over linguini noodles, sauteed spinach, onions, garlic, and mushrooms with a small Tilapia filet sauteed with pepper.  Seriously better than any restaurant's alfredo sauce.

This is restaurant quality alfredo and a lot easier than some recipes I've used with flour.  Instead of using the whole cup of heavy cream, I used 3/4 cup cream & 1/4 skim milk to make it slightly more healthy. It wasn't as thick as some I've made in the past, but it wasn't watery. Don't buy alfredo in a jar, this is easy and delicious!

Can I just say...wow!  Followed recipe exactly (except when I read one clove of garlic...i use 4...always)...except I was looking for spinach alfredo..so prior to making the sauce as described, I heated olive oil, garlic, crushed red pepper then sauteed spinach in that mixture..set aside. Then, in same pan followed recipe to the letter..added my spinach as the last step...so good..best alfredo I have ever had..ty so much for sharing. After reading some of the reviews...especially those that said this was bland...I feel like I must note that Alfredo is a cheese sauce...and is definitely dependent on the cheese one chooses to use..I would imagine the original poster, as I, used a good cheese as a base which is why there was no need for "extras" to make it taste good. :)

Made this recipe for the first time tonight and added some Cajun blackened shrimp. I can honestly say this is one of the best recipes for Alfredo sauce that I have ever tried. My picky 7 yr old son had it without blackening spice on the shrimp, and finished his entire plate and then asked if we could have it again for dinner tomorrow night.

I made this recipie as described with one minor change. I simmer the garlic in the butter for a few minutes before adding the cream. This brings out the oil-soluble flavors and aroma of the garlic, infusing them into the butter. Aside from that I followed this recipe to the letter and it comes out perfectly!

This is a good basic recipe - only thing missing are the seasonings:  a dash of salt, pepper (maybe 2 dashes) and nutmeg about 1/4 tsp.  Don't add the cheese too early or it gets stringy but melt the butter and warm the milk add the pasta and then just as you are ready to take it off the heat add your cheese, salt/pepper/nutmeg.  Grate fresh parmesan cheese on top just before serving.  Our family favourite is to add chunks of ham.

It is delicious and riddiculously easy!!! I didn't have all ingredients on hand so i made do. I swapped out butter with margarine and simmered garlic in butter before adding the cream. I used 1 tblsp of crushed garlic you buy in a jar. Didn't have any cream so I substituted 1 cup of cold milk with 3tsp of cornstarch wisked in, for thickening. make sure the milk is cold and whisk in until there are no more lumps. added that to the butter and garlic , whisking on a low simmer until it thickened to a consistency that I liked. All I had was whole milk mozzarella so I shredded a cup and added 1/3 cup of kraft parmesan tha comes in the green bottle. whisked it in slowly a little at a time till it was all melted, never bringing to a boil , just a low simmer. It was ridiculousy good!  My husband is one of those that never says its good. He loved it! 
And had seconds and thirds. Thanks for posting this. will make more often with different kinds of cheeses.

My family LOVES this sauce!  I use the shredded parmesan cheese, and it does take patience to get it completely melted, but it's so worth it. I've never tried gruyere cheese, but I bought some today so will try it this week.  My 7-year-old stepdaughter told her teacher "My stepmom makes THE BEST fettuccini alfredo!"  And it's thanks to this recipe!  My husband and I LOVE this sauce over potato gnocchi. It is sinfully rich but it's our favorite way to eat this sauce.

I give this 4 stars. This recipe is the perfect base. I cut the fat in half and did not use heavy cream. I had to use a little more than the 1 c. to thin out the sauce and make it creamier. I followed other reviews and used half and half instead. The only thing this recipe is missing is the seasoning. I added salt and pepper and the flavor was perfect. I also used an Italian blend cheese instead of fresh parmesean or romano. It tasted better than any restaurant. I am happy I found this recipe.

Delicious!  I added a second clove of garlic, used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and added a dash of white pepper.  So good!  It was a little thin (probably because I used 1/2 and 1/2) so next time I might add a little flour.

I bought a block of Parmesan cheese and grated it for this recipe.. it's so delicious! The first time I made it, I thought it was much too rich and added another cup of cream, but once it was mixed into the pasta it was too bland. So don't make the mistake of overestimating your sauce, the original one given here is perfect as-is!

Perhaps I was impatient and didn't give it enough time but I could not get the shredded parm. cheese to melt which left a lumpy, unpleasant texture.  I also found this to be too garlicky (and I like garlic).

I followed this recipe several times and love it.  After a while, I began to experiment.  I put in more garlic, and combined Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese with parmesan (1 cup and 1/2 cup, respectively).  It makes it much creamier and with a little more bite.  A tip to reheat - warm slowly and add in extra cream to keep it's consistency, or else the cheese and butter separate.

This tastes JUST LIKE the Alfredo sauce at ANTON'S Pasta Bar in Burnaby. I added at least 6 cloves of garlic, 2 cups of fat free creamer and much less butter, it still turned out amazing. The only problem is that the sauce thickens a lot when it cools, almost becoming paste-like but still tastes great.

Good and simple.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream and added pepper and a dash of nutmeg at the end.  Used fresh shredded Parmesan, not the grated stuff in the green can.

It was very good but I needed to add a little bit of corn starch to thicken it. Otherwise the flavor was just what I was looking for.

Quick and easy :)  I had to use milk since we never buy heavy cream, but it worked perfectly!  The parmesan cheese thickens it perfectly.  The man loves it, which is what counts :)

I thought this was pretty good over stuffed crab ravioli. However, I did make a few changes. I wanted to try and duplicate the sauce served at Carrabas over their lobster ravioli. I think I came close. I first sauteed some onion and pretty much followed the directions until after adding the cream and letting it cook.  I then added 1/4 can of petite canned tomatoes and a teaspoon of minced garlic. I let that cook for another 4-5 min then added the parsley and served immediately. Will def try again!

Awesome! My 6 year old wanted Alfredo for her birthday dinner, this was the first recipe that came up and it seemed pretty simple.
We loved it.  I added a table spoon of flour and a teaspoon of lemon juice and it was perfect.

AMAZING! Will never buy alfredo sauce again. I added a bit more garlic and used regular milk. I used flour to thicken it up. My husband LOVED it!

Made this recipe for my son's wedding - 144 people served. The young men want to marry me and the other adults found it superb. I replaced the heavy cream with half and half and it came out perfect. Made cream of broccoli with the left overs and some steamed broccoli. Bellisima!

Delicious!  This was my first time making alfredo sauce (I'm a new cook) and it was very easy.  Only thing is that my hand was aching from grating all that cheese by hand!  :)  Make sure you include the parsley, it makes all the difference.

This was great, I didn't use the parsley, so it might of tasted better, but It defiantly didn't take long to make.

Great recipe.  I added a dash of nutmeg and a splash of dry, white wine. Instead of cream, I used 1% milk and a T. flour to thicken.

I used 2 cloves of garlic and added some crushed pepper to up the flavour. Mixed sauce with tri-colour pasta, topped with mozza and baked. This was amazing - my brother-in-law had 3 helpings!

This sauce is very good. It beats the Alfredo Sauce of all expensive restaurants I've been too. Add some white wine for an extra touch.

I am ecsatic! This was totally delicious! My neighbors and family said it was "restaurant quality" ! No more expensive Olive Garden Fetuccini Alfredo for me!
I did double up the recipe due to the amount of people eating... was a bit short even when doubling.
YUMMMMMMMMM!

Really good sauce but if you have left overs, DO NOT put it on the psat to store. reheated it becomes grainy - it is authentic though, so that's what you get. Store it seperately.

I know this is a "basic" recipe but it is super delicous. Everytime I make it I litterally do not have ANY leftovers even when making it for 20+ people. Also, I made it for a bunch of kids(ages 2-10) for dinner and they all ate thirds...no lie! Thanks for sharing!

I ended up adding a bit of cream cheese (inspired by another alfredo recipe on this site) and then adding extra cream to get the right consistency.  It was delicious!

Yum!  I used whole milk instead of cream and it was a little runny, but it tasted very good. Maybe next time I'll add a little corn starch to a small amount the milk before I mix it in.

Great base recipe! Easy to add your own spin. I used an extra clove of garlic and topped with grilled cajun chicken breast from this site (made with the cajun seasoning mix, also from this site} so it gave it more zing. Rave reviews! Next time I'll double the sauce.

Very good... as easy as opening up a jar of sauce but so much fresher.  I used liight cream and a mix of parmigiano reggiano and shredded peccarino ramano.  I went overboard on garlic ... but like others I sauteed the garlic and little onion in the butter with a little olive oil.  

This sauce was for tortellini with broccoli very good!

Oh my gosh! This was excellent!!! I only changed the butter to olive oil and kept the rest the same. It was to die for!!! I think the olive oil helped make the whole thing a very creamy consistency. It was Amazing! I can't rave about it enough. I will never go back to the stuff in a jar! Thank you Rebecca :)

I'd have given this 10 stars if I could! This was awesome in all ways. I needed something quick and simple for a lot of unexpected guests and this really came through. The only thing I did different is added more minced garlic (only because we are garlic-aholics). Everybody loved it! Will definitely be making this again in the near future.

This was soooo wonderful.  Fettuccine alfredo is one of my favorite foods, but this was the first time I have tried to make it.  The recipe is very easy to follow.  It was very smooth, and my difficult-to-please family loved it.

I don't think I would change anything about this recipe and left it completely as is, other than adding about half a tsp of ground white pepper. The sauce was rich and creamy and the perfect consistency as it began to cool. I would say that if you prefer a slightly less rich taste, you may want to add a little less cheese.. We used 100% natural Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan) and it was terrific. Also, I'd like to mirror what some other reviewers have written - that I never knew Alfredo could be this fast and easy and I will make it much more frequently now that I know! Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe and so did my family.  I've made it twice and both time it was wonderful.  The last time I added 2 tbsp of cream cheese and it was even better!  I served it with the Paula's Bread Stick recipe from this site, and they were fabulous dipped in the sauce.  I'll never buy alfredo again!

I'm giving this 4 stars only b/c I changed it a bit. Otherwise, it was great. I used 2 small garlic cloves and I sauteed them in the melted butter for a couple minutes before adding half and half. I also added a little freshly ground pepper and a sprinkle of  nutmeg. I used freshly grated parm from my grocery deli. I stopped at 1 cup; 1 1/2 would have been WAY too much. I wish I had stopped at 1/2 cup b/c the sauce was too thick for my taste. I tossed the sauce with some sauteed broccoli and cooked chicken before adding it to my noodles. It's a pretty good sauce, but I'll decrease the parm next time.

Restaurant quality!!  We didn't change anything to this recipe, and it turned out wonderful.  We eat chicken fettucine alfredo often, and this is the first time we didn't use a store-bought jar of alfredo sauce.  Well worth it, and only took a few extra minutes than usual.  Highly recommended!

Looooved it!  The only thing is, and I don't know if it's just me, it doesn't make for good leftovers.  Warming it the next day just creates a pool of butter but the sauce was great when served immediately.  Made it with blackened chicken and was a huge hit. I'll definitely make it again.

I used the parmesan that came in a bag but it didnt melt quite like I thought. I also added a little mozzerella. Thought it tasted very good and so rich. I added broccoli and chicken.

I have tried many jar alfredo sauces and just have never found one I like.  I came across this recipe as a 2010 Top 10 recipe and glad I did.  This is a keeper!  I thought I had heavy cream and when I started making the recipe I realized that mine was out dated so I had to use 1/2 and 1/2, but it was delicious and a little healthy so I will do that again!  I did double the batch to make sure there was enough and was glad I did.  We even had a little left over that my husband and I heated up the next day for lunch and it was just as good.  I added a little brocolli in with it and was great.

As written: just 4 stars.  Here's why....made exactly as written, the end result was very thick and needed pepper.  So the changes I made were pretty simple: I whisked in more cream, probably another 1/3 cup in addition to what the recipe called for.  I added it in small amounts until the consistency was perfect.  I also added several cranks of freshly ground black pepper (because to me, alfredo isn't alfredo without black pepper) and an extra clove of garlic.  With my minor revisions, this sauce is absolutely outstanding and definitely a keeper.  I served it tossed with shrimp and capellini.  Just be sure you're not on a diet the night you make this for dinner.  ;)

Delicious!  I used pecorino romano and added the cheese very gradually.  Simmered the sauce and whisked often while I prepared the rest of the meal.  Didn't have any pasley, but otherwise prepared it following the recipe as written.

Tasted great, I also added 2 table spoons of cream cheese just to mix it up. I do not recommend the canned/jar dry parmesan, I used that type and could not get it to mix, it stayed grannie. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe! i followed exactly, except for adding gruyere cheese instead of parmesan as suggested. Excellent! I made this for a family get together and everyone was raving about it.  I boiled peices of brocolli with the fusilli and added the cooked chicken to the sauce, but it is awesome on it's own.

I love this recipe!  Toss it with your favorite pasta and it is such a comfort dish for a cold or rainy evening.  The only thing I added was a pinch of nutmeg.  Make sure you continuiosly stir it so it gets a velvety texture.  Thanks so much for this great sauce.

I just needed something different to make for dinner tonight besides a tomato sauce for pasta and came across this recipe, i've never made alfredo sauce before and this took me about 10 minutes to make wow! ..came out great..i didn't have parsley so added some tarragon which worked well, and ofcourse salt and pepper to taste, also added 4 roasted cloves of garlic crushed. Easy to make and pleasantly surprised at how creamy and yummy it turned out!

Very easy and delicious. I did however add some salt and pepper for a little more taste, and used a regular milk with some flour to thicken it. Overall very good and quick.

This sauce is excellent!! I did however have to add almost double the amount of cream because the sauce was super thick.  Maybe it was the type of shredded parmasean I used.  My family raved about it though.  This recipe is a keeper!! Thanks!

Tasty!! Too much parsley for my taste, I'll probably half the amount of parsley next time. But I'll be making it again!

Following the advice of others here, I doubled the recipe to be sure I had enough.  In the process, I used a can of evaporated milk (and a little 2% milk when that didn't quite make 2 cups), and tossed in a tablespoon of flour for thickness.  I minced 3 garlic cloves for the doubled recipe.  I had 2 bags of 1.5 cups of the Parmesan, but left about a third of the 2nd bag.  The constant whisking/stirring was great, but even still, my sauce caught a little at the bottom when I accidentally left it for too long and didn't watch the heat.  No biggie, though... there was no burn smell or taste, and the scraped up parts from the bottom gave my sauce some character.  :)  Lastly, I added a dash of chili powder, some white pepper, some black pepper, and two sprinkles of dried parsely.  I poured it all over whole wheat shells, along with shrimp and broccoli I had sauteed with olive oil, more garlic, and other seasonings in a separate pan.  De-lish!  Will definitely use this again.

Wonderfully easy alfredo sauce! I didn't know what to expect as the ingredients were pretty basic but it turned out wonderful! I have always been a little IF-ie of making a good alfredo as I thought it would be too rich... too salty... too bland. I am definitely a beginner when it comes to cooking and I will definately be making this one again.  I used fat free half and half to cut the heaviness (and calories!) and sauteed the garlic in the butter before adding the cream. I added creamed spinich and roasted tomatoes and folded them in at the end and omitted the parsley as I didn't want to waste the rest of the bushel. I topped farafelle pasta with grilled chicken strips and the awesome alfredo. Only problem I had was getting the shredded parmesan cheese to melt completely. Maybe next time I will try gruyere. Thanks for the recipe- this ones a keeper!!

Good base sauce!  I had some leftover cream and I wanted to try to make something new.  This worked well!  I used a ton extra garlic, and I didn't have parsley so I used some italian mixed herbs.  Some people said it was quite thin, but I found it to be perfect.  Mind you, the cream in Japan is super thick and that might have had something to do with it.  I also added a bit of salt, but I really like salt so maybe it's just my preference.

Yummy!  My kids (9, 11, and 13) practically licked their plates clean.  I was afraid that it would be difficult to make homemade alfredo, but this recipe is SUPER easy!  I actually had the 9 year old stirring it while I cut up a chicken breast.

Delicious and so easy to make. I've tried with different types of parmesan and some melt better than others. I'm sorry I didn't write any names down and I can't remember the brands I've used. I've made this 3 times and have gotten rave reviews. Enjoy.

I served this for my daughter's birthday dinner.  Everyone agreed that this is as good as any restaurant.   I included diced chicken to round out the dish.  I made the mistake of trying to cook the sauce to slowly when I added the freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  I had to turn up the heat to get the cheese to melt into the sauce.  I did not let it boil, but I did let it get very hot while continually whisking.

I am picky and this recipe is great! Easy, quick, and tastes delicious.  I like a little kick, so I threw in a sprinkle of crushed red pepper.  I also added a little more garlic than called for and sauteed that in the butter before adding cream..that gave the sauce a little more flavor.  I can put this sauce over chicken and broccoli with farfalle or shrimp with spinach fettuccine.  Very versatile, simple, and tasty.

Perfect.  I've made alfredo sauce from scratch before but lost the recipe, so I came here to print one for dinner with friends.  They raved about it, and I went on letting them think I'm some fabulous gourmet cook, all the while knowing basic sauces like this are SO EASY.  If people only knew how easy it was to make great pasta at home, they'd never buy another jar of sauce in their whole lives.  Give this recipe a try, and be the "gourmet cook" for your non-cooking friends, too (ha ha ha).

Alfredo sauce was always something I thought I should like but never did until this recipe. I considered adding extra garlic, but found one medium or large clove of garlic gave plenty of flavor. I also use a dash of white pepper, and a little bit of dried parsley in place of fresh (I find fresh parsley to be bitter). Perfect!  The first time I made it I used block parmesan that I shredded myself with a rotary grater, and it melted beautifully. I also tried it with "fresh" grated parmesan (the powdery kind, but from the deli case), and it didn't turn out as well -- the texture remained gritty.  Definitely whisk the butter and cream together, and stir occasionally with the whisk while simmering to avoid separating, but you shouldn't need to whisk the whole time.   The sauce reheats well by itself with some vigorous stirring with a whisk or fork, but doesn't reheat very well if it's already on the pasta. So if you think you'll have leftovers, only toss as much pasta and sauce together as you're going to eat right away.

I did not like it at all. I followed the recipe exactly. We were so disappointed because most of the reviews said it was really good and we were expecting it to be the best sauce ever.

This was very easy and yummy.  It was a bit thin at first, but thickened as the pasta sat for a few minutes.  I would make it again

I reduced the parmesan to 1/2 C and added red pepper flakes, 1 TBS sherry and grated fresh nutmeg.  Very delicious, nutmeg is the secret ingredient!!  You can also sautee 1/2 lb of sliced mushroons  in butter, in a separate pan, and add to the finished sauce.

Very good. I used a fresh wedge of Parmesan that I grated myself and added it in small amounts, which made it melt just fine. I omitted the parsley just because I didn't have it. I did throw the garlic in while the butter was melting just to get more flavor out of it. My husband enjoyed it as well. Definitely a keeper!

Very good over all. I do think the parmesian cheese dosen't melt very well and might cook it a little different.

Very good recipe!  I don't make this too often, only because of the fat content, but it is VERY good.  I don't use parsley, and sometimes use romano cheese instead of parm; there's not much of a difference.  You just have to remember to continuously wisk and add the cheese a little at a time.  The only problem I have is that the leftovers always separate when reheating; don't know if that is something that is preventable.  Great recipe though; thank you!

I've been making this sauce for 5+ yrs because my daughter is such a pasta lover. I usually use the same amount of parmesan as the butter. You don't really need to use fresh ingredients as well. Pre-grated Parma and dried parsley is good enough.

I did not like this sauce at all.  The parmesan flavor was way too strong.  I found another recipe with a lot less parmesan and a lot more cream and it was a much better recipe.  My family didn't even want to finish eating this recipe when I made it.

Loved it! Yes the cheese did not melt well but it still tasted great. It was a little salty so I added a 1/4 cup more heavy cream. Did not have fresh parsley so left that out. Other alfredo recipes included a dash of nutmeg so I did add a dash of nutmeg. So great and simple sauce to make! Next time I will try the Gruyere cheese!

Freaking awesome! Even my picky teenager loved it. I added about 3 heaping T of ricotta cheese at the end of the simmering time but it was awesome even before that. If you taste it in the pan, it is very cheesy but don't be discouraged. It tames down in a few minutes! Definitely making this again!

I have tried several different alfredo sauce recipes and I also found that parmesan cheese doesn't melt very well...my sauce always seemed to come out grainy...I took your and some other readers' advice about using Gruyere cheese...I shredded it fresh...and I have never gotten a sauce as smooth and creamy! I also added an egg yolk and used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic, and also added some black pepper (based on some other alfredo recipes I've seen). The sauce was perfect!!!! Thanks for the suggestion on the Gruyere cheese! It's definitely the way to go!!!!

HOLY STINKING MOLY!!! This is great alfredo sauce. This is a wonderfully thick alfredo that it also good to dip bread in. I took the suggestion of using Gruyere cheese rather than parmesean and it was elegantly rich and creamy.

The amount of cheese called for is WAY too much.  I used half & half instead of cream, as I had it on hand.  I had to add more than double the amount of cream as all of the cheese made it too thick.  Other than that, this was great with lots of fresh parsley and garlic.

I was looking for this recipe because I'd been using almost the exact same recipe that someone sent me calling it an Olive Garden copycat.  The only difference was this recipe called for TWICE the amount of parmesan!  I've been wanting to try using fresh garlic for awhile so I requested my mom buy some when she shopped for groceries.  She also picked up a garlic press and I went to town.  We have a large family of ten children so I quadrupled this.  After reading some reviews I tried adding an extra clove of garlic and did not put the full amount of parmesan because we didn't have enough.  Oh my gosh this stuff is incredible!!  I think the fresh garlic is what kicks it over the edge.  Before it was just kind of blah but this, oh this is great!!  Will make again and again!!!

This is a really great Alfredo recipe because it's easy and can be made with practically anything. I added the cheese (fresh parmesan) slowly, about 1/4 cup at a time and I don't think I used quite as much as the recipe called for, but it was plenty thick and rich. I also added an extra clove of garlic and a touch of fresh nutmeg. I tossed pasta with sauteed mushrooms and spinach and topped it all with a marinated salmon filet and the sauce. it was amazing!

My boyfriend LOVES this recipe! I do add more cream as it cooks to get it creamier. I personally do not like the consistency because of the parmesan cheese. But the flavor is good so we have it on occasion but every time I make it I follow this recipe and just add more cream towards the end.

Was delicious. The texture was just a bit dry as I used parm, but my husband said he actually preferred it that way. We had it over leftover roast and veggies- I sliced the roast thin and layered it in a glass baking dish w/carrots and potatoes also sliced thin. I then poured the sauce over the top. A yummy way to use leftover roast! I would have added steamed broccoli and mushrooms if I had had them on hand.

This turned out wonderfully. Make sure to whisk the butter/cream while it simmers so it doesn't separate. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and dried parsley instead because I didn't have any fresh on hand.

I make this with half and half instead of heavy cream and it's still absolutely delicious! You definitely have to use REAL Parmesan cheese and let it all dissolve. Also, I always use atleast 4 cloves of garlic.

This is more like fettucine and cheese. The sauce is so thick it isn't really even sauce, it's just melted cheese. The worst alfredo recipe I've tried.

Really good sauce, but I always put a dash of white sugar and white wine in this base.

I just made this for dinner tonight with cheese ravioli...it was wonderful!  My husband loved it and it was soooo easy!  I used half and half instead of cream and two cloves of garlic instead of one. Thanks for posting this recipe, it's definitely a keeper.  No more jar alfredo sauce for us!

This is the first time I made this recipe and I'll say that I'm definitely impressed!  I've always cheated my family out of alfredo, due to thinking it was a tedious task.  This was simple and will definitely be on our menu often!  Thanks!

This sauce was wonderful!  I made this on a Friday during Lent when I needed a meatless dish.  I only made a couple of changes to it.  I made it just as stated in the recipe and thought it was a little too thick.  I thinned it out a bit by using a little milk.  I also wanted a little more color so I soaked 1/4 cup of chopped sun-dried tomatoes in some chicken broth and added them with the parsley.  Not only was the dish more colorful, the tomatoes made it more flavorful.  I poured it over some whole wheat penne rigate pasta and served it bread and salad.  YUM!

This sauce was creamy, but didn't have much flavor. It all depends on the quality of Parm cheese used. Next time I'll add nutmeg and see if it comes out tastier.

This was super easy and my husband and I loved it.  I did double the recipe and added an extra clove of garlic.  Fresh, real parmesan that I grated myself melted like butter and was very flavorful.  Will positively make again and again.

This is a great recipe!  I have made it time and time again.  I always add at least 3-4 cloves of garlic and fresh ground pepper.  I serve it with grilled chicken, it is delicious!  I would say its probably better than Olive Gardens sauce!!!

Good sauce and easy to make, but it seems to be missing something.  Salt and pepper, but something else.  I added ground nutmeg, but maybe garlic salt?  I'll make again (it's to quick, perfect for a last minute dinner), but I'm going to tweak it some more.

excellent... my family loved it! I increased butter to a stick and used 3/4 whole milk and 1/4 cup half-n-half. I added a cup of shredded mozerella cheese and whisked the entire time from start to finish and voila... no seperating!
Thank you, this is a keeper!

OMG!!! I cannot say enough about this recipe! If I could give it more stars, I would…  I doubled the amounts and added 4 diced Chicken Breast that I cooked in 2 Tablespoons EVOO and then added ½ Onion, 2 small garlic cloves & 1 ½ teaspoons Italian seasoning & cooked until no more pink. I made 1 lb of noodle but I think that was just a little too much so next time I will add less noodles or make more sauce… I like that it is a much lighter flavor then the stuff in the stores and that I can add more or less depending to how I feel that day… Thank you for this it is a keeper!!!! ;0)

Excellent sauce.  I also added an additional garlic clove, nutmeg and romano cheese.  ABSOLUTELY USE UNSALTED BUTTER!  The cheeses have enough salt.

I never liked Alfredo Sauce until I took a bite from my husband's plate at a restaurant.  Now I realize that most Alfredo is made improperly.  After having good alfredo at the restaurant, my search for alfredo sauce was born.  This one hits the spot:  It's simple and delicious.  You can easily alter the quantity of ingredients for your personal taste.  My sauce now rivals the sauce I had at the restaurant!

This is perfect alfredo sauce. It is supposed to be a simple dish and stands on it's own with quality ingredients. I have made it several times and tonight I added some gorgonzola, fresh spinach and diced plum tomatoes. Soooo good!

This recipe was easy and quick. I made a few changes because I did not have all of the indredients.
I used 1% milk rather than cream and 1 cup of cheddar cheese along with about 1/3 cup of parmesean cheese. I also added a little salt and added an extra clove of garlic.

My roommate's daughter wanted Chicken Alfredo for her birthday party.  I used this recipe for the first time and it was a total hit.  Everyone raved about how wonderful the sauce tasted.  It was as good as eating in a restaurant but without the bill of feeding 22.  Will definitely be making this in the years to come.

I would give this 5 stars however I found it bland...I always add sherry, I find it amusing when others reviewing say when they have kids they don't add alcohol, THE ALCOHOL IS COOKED OFF! All that's left is the flavor, your kids nor you will get drunk, I promise. Also I like to fine grind fresh nutmeg before serving, just a bit seems to really bring in a lot of flavor,(it's fine to use the pre-powered if that's all you have). Seriously I don't get all that parsley, Italian has way more flavor, but not a whole lot from the "regular"...maybe color...for me it's always about taste, presentation...not ineatable garnish!Do add cut up grilled chicken breast; shrimp; seafood; grilled veggies; have fun with recipes and tweak them to suit your taste, and your family. Taste as you go along, try a smaller amount just for you before you make it for company. The main ingredient you need is LOVE!

I made this lastnight and let me tell you it was awesome!  I never knew making such a flavorful alfredo sauce could be so easy.  This is definetely a recipe I will use again, and again.  It's so quick to make for those nights you just don't feel like doing a whole lot.  Grill some chicken, toss with noodles  (I used penne), prepare green salad and you're done. Thanks for this recipe!

This sauce is really good. I would give it 5 stars except I personally think it would be better with the shredded parmesan cheese rather than the grated. It did not melt all that well, but still tasted good. I did add some mushrooms and some diced chicken and it is delicious! Will make again!

This was a nice sauce for a basic meal of homemade spinach fettucine and pork medalions simmered in a tomato-apricot and white wine reduction. I suggest that anyone having trouble with the strong flavor of the Parmesan cheese look specifically for COW's milk Parmesan, which is not as tangy as sheep's milk parm. Also, stay away from any Parmesan cheese that states a long aging process on its label. The rennet in the cheese may go "off," and the longer the cheese sits, the  more likely it is that you get that intense "tang" of the increased microbials - akin to the process for bleu-veined (moldy-looking) cheeses. With this recipe, I added cumin and just the smallest dash (seriously, like less than 1/8 tsp.) of fresh grated nutmeg. I was also liberal with pepper because I like it that way.

Delicious!! Being Lactose Intolerant I had to switch a few things...2% lactose-free milk for the heavy cream, lactose-free margarine for the butter and veggie shreds Parm cheese (increased to 2 cups to thicken sauce). I have not been able to have Alfredo sauce in over 2 years!! I cannot wait to try it again and add some crab meat, lobster and/or shrimp! Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW!!! I am a student and all i can say is that i am impressed. I couldn't get a hold of my mom for her recipe and then i looked this one up and tried it....i guess that i wont need to phone her for this recipe anymore. I added a can of mushrooms, and some chunks of ham to this, and i loved it. My roomies liked the way our house smelled when i finished cooking tonight! Try it!

I would compare this recipe to the taste of the alfredo dipping sauce served at Olive Garden. A friend and i were cooking and tried this. We all fell in love with it! It's very simple. The taste is great. I usually double the sauce, if I am cooking for more than 2 people. Adding 1 more clove of garlic adds more flavor as well. :)

I loved how easy this recipe is!  I added a little freshly ground black pepper for a little depth of flavor.  I thought it was way too much parsley and ended up adding less.  I will definitely make this sauce again.

Tasty. I always add a pinch of nutmeg and serve this over tortellini, then top it with toasted pine nuts.

Maybe I did something wrong...but I don't think so. I doubled the recipe so it'd be enough for my family. That's all the changes I made. I grated a block of parm right before making the sauce, I didn't everything right. The parm was very very gritty and the whole sauce was just completely flavorless. I'm sorry. We couldn't eat it, I had to pull out my bottle of store bought alfredo sauce. Again, I'm sorry, but we just didn't like it.

Totally scrumptious! I used an Italian Four Cheese blend. I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I used dried. I also added an extra clove of garlic because I love garlic. This is a super quick and easy recipe. Whisking the whole time resulted in a smooth, creamy sauce. Delicous served over egg noodles!

Outstanding. Easy. A single man's dream. Even I can do this one. Heavy cream is whipping cream right? Great Value packaged Parm, a piece of galic, some margerine and I can cut grass, so parsley ain't much different. Stir it up, pour it over some extra wide egg noodles and WOW! One bite and my mind is flooded with nothing but an old time Italian resturant! Impressive. Can't say how it holds overnight ... but I can make more.

I just made this recipe and I am SO PLEASED!!! I have never made Alfredo sauce before and I can't believe how easy it is. We love garlic so I used a very large clove and it gave this sauce a wonderful flavor. I did not find this to be too salty and I used salted butter. In fact, I even added a little sea salt to the pan, as well as sliced mushrooms and it was perfect! 
Thank you for giving us a quick, easy, delicious recipe, I'll be making this again for sure!!

I gave this five stars because it is very good and also very easy. Mine separated a little, but I used 2% milk instead of cream and had two toddlers "helping" me. Next time I will omit the parsley-- it didn't really add to the flavor and scared the kids.

This recipe was awesome! ( I cooked for 2) But I will be making some changes next time. The sauce was too think and really heavy on the stomach (so beware...) I wont use as much parmesan cheese and ill add a splash of water to thin it a little. And the parsley was too much I cut the amount in half. Other than that...it was great I will defenetly be making this again...

I read alot of reviews about this before I made it. I used unsalted butter, and I used the parmesian and romano cheese blend. I have a "Gizmo" which comes with a wire whisk attatchment and I used it when I added my cheese at 1/4 cup at a time. It made it so smooth and it never got gritty due to the constant whisking. So if you have one I highly recommend it. At the end I folded in some fresh lump crab meat and served it over penne pasta, it was awesome and it really did taste alot like the Olive Garden, even my family said so without me saying anything about it. This was a very easy dinner that was a huge hit.

Made this for dinner tonight.. it was okay. A little bit to salty for my taste. It was smooth and not grainy at all as others have stated. Not even sure how grainy is possible with the ingredients listed?? Are you sure your parlsey was washed thoroughly? I always find a ton of sand at the bottom of my bowl that i use to wash my parlsey in. Fill up a big bowl full of water and wash parlsey thouroughly that might be the problem. I had a hard cheese grater, that alows me to grate very finely. It melted in seconds. It was very easy to make.

This turned out amazing and everyone went back for seconds.  I used a freshly grated parmesan, asiago and romano blend and wisked during the entire cooking time to avoid clumps.  I also added grilled chicken to the final product.  Next time I think I'll add some veggies (broccoli and mushrooms)for variety.

My boyfriend loves Alfredo, but I really haven't had a good version of it. This recipe was it! So delicious! Be sure to buy fresh grated cheese, and wisk it in slowly. I had no clumps at all and it was ready in minutes. I added chicken and carrots. Also, I recommend only making as much as you can eat, it does not reheat at all. Definietly try this sauce, it's well worth it!

Excellent!  My husband will not eat cream based sauces but he RAVED about this.  The only thing I would change is next time I will use half romano and half parmesan cheese.  It was awesome as posted but I like to try a variety.  It was even better the second day!

This is such a great sauce. I read a few reviews and when I went shopping bought both Romano and Parmesean cheese. The sauce was a bit grainy, I think because I used shredded Parmesean instead of grated. One piece of advice..make double the recipe if your cooking for more then 2 or 3 people. I make a double batch for 6 people. (Glad I did) When the sauce was done I added pre cooked shrimp and some (slightly heated via microwave) brocolli pieces. If you've ever tasted Apple Bees Shrimp Alfredo..this is VERY close!

Great sauce as is, but I do like a bit more bite - and cheese... I used 1C Parm, 1/2 C freshly shredded Romano and some mozzarella to smooth it out.  Loved the parsley.  I added this to blackened shrmip and it was marvelous!

This sauce is delicious!  I had made the Baked Dijon Salmon from this site and had some leftover fish that I didn't know what to do with.  I found this recipe and thought it looked easy enough since I already had all of the ingredients on hand.  I tossed the sauce with some thin spaghetti noodles and then broke up the cold leftover salmon into small pieces and sprinkled it on top. It was excellent!

This is "my" standard Alfredo Sauce recipe now. I haven't changed a THING. My husband loved it so much, that even HE recommends it to all of his friends. 

We have served this over fettucine noodles and have also served it with Steak and Feta / Gorgonzola cheeses on the top with much success.

I don't use measurements, but the ingredients in this recipe make an outstanding "made from scratch" alfredo sauce.  There is no store bought sauce that can top it.

I of course, completely screwed up this recipe while making it and put everything in out of order. It still came out to be delicious, but reheating it was a problem.  The sauce completely separated and I had oil everywhere the next day.  Next time I won't make extra for lunch.

I have always hesitated making this dish afraid of it not turning out. I finally made this recipe and it turned out perfect on the first try. I had none problems the other people had.I found using the heavy cream a bit sweet for me. may use half and half next time since I will be making it again. I added fresh garlic as well as some fresh grated nutmeg. I grated the Parmigiano Reggiano myself. I will make a double batch next time and use 16 ounces of dry pasta.I wisked a lot because of what others said. Try again I will!

I loved it, I added more garlic then what was required, because it has a sweet tatse because of the heavy cream. Otherwise good. I made twice in two weeks when I first ran across this recipe.

My daughter had to have this for her 18th birthday. This is the 3rd time I have made this sauce and I will never buy store bought again. It always turns out smooth for me. The secret is to get the butter and cream hot enough and slowly add the cheese, while whisking away like crazy. I let the parmasean sit out a little while before using, so it's not cold. I thin it out a little by adding 1/4c or so extra milk or cream. Don't leave out the fresh crushed garlic clove, that makes it! We add 2 Tbs of juliened sun dried tomatoes (in oil) and cooked chicken after the sauce is smooth.

Quick & easy, but the cheese does not melt easily, it clumps up.  Would suggest that either less cheese is used or more cream.

I thought this recipe was great! I used half Gruyere/half Parmesan. I added them slowly and stirred frequently and the cheese seemed to melt just fine, although there was some texture, but it wasn't bad at all! I also added salt and pepper, a few pinches of nutmeg, and a little more garlic like some other people suggested. It had a great flavor! I think the Gruyere definitely helped some of the texture problems others were experiencing, so try it!

I tought I followed the recipe to the T but it was SUPER salty. I didn't put in a bit of salt.  I couldn't even finish it.  I am not very versed in the kitchen so it very well could have been my fault.

This is a wonderful recipe. I usually double the recipe to make plenty. I have substituted milk for some of the heavy cream and it turned out fine.  It worked best for me to use freshly grated parmesean. Will make often.

Every bit as good as Olive Garden!  Make sure you use this with raw pasta found in the refrigerated section of the grocery store.  If you like more garlic, I use an entire bulb.  Simmer peeled garlic in 1/4 cup butter for 20 minutes, mix in 1 Tbsp flour, add 1/4 cup milk, cook 2 more minutes, then strain into alfredo sauce.

I have made this recipe over 10 times and it's a HUGE hit; for dinner, as an appetizer, you name it! Found that the sauce will get thicker the longer you let it simmer, and not to use already shredded parmesan. (It doesn't melt well at all!) Grate it yourself; it's worth the pain!

We sauted portabellos & diced tomatoes and added them on top.  We don't eat meat, so portabellos and tomatoes are an easy and excellent addition to almost anything!  Good stuff.  VERY filling.

I would suggest paring this with pan seared scallops (heat up the oil in pan on high, add scallop, sprinkle salt and pepper, white wine and lemon juice)

I found the cheese flavor to be very strong and overwhelming.  I used a high quality, freshly grated parmesan - maybe that was the problem - I'm used to mild, packaged, preservative filled cheese!

The consistency was good and it was very simple to make, though.  Maybe I'll try again with a different parmesan.

Absolutely delicious alfredo sauce!  I did double the recipe but used half and half instead of heavy cream.  It was a bit difficult to get the cheese to melt.  I used Kraft grated parm/romano mix.  Perhaps next time I will use fresh.  I also only used 2 cups cheese instead of 3.  Nonetheless, the whole family LOVED it!  I served it with grilled marinated chicken breast and broccoli over fettucine noodles...YUM

This is a great recipe, however, I varied a bit from it and wanted a bit richer sauce so I used a whole pint of heavy cream, 1/2 cup butter and only 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese.  I know that Parmesan is not the the easiest cheese to melt in sauces and was very skeptical about using fresh so I used what I had and that was the big container that you can get at Costco Wholesale. The brand is Messana and I tell you , it was perfect!!!!  It wasn't too rich and that cheese blended very well in the sauce.  I think it really does make a difference in the cheese you use.  I had used fresh not too long ago and it globbed up on me and I was really disappointed.  I recommend the type I used if you have a Costco.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese and WOW, very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted great!  The cheese was difficult to melt and made the texture a little gritty.  I will definitely make again, but with less cheese as others have suggested.

This sauce was good, but almost too rich, if that's possible.  Next time, I may use half and half instead of cream.

Awesome! I was concerned that there wasn't going to be enough sauce but there was. Different than my usual alfredo sauce - richer. (reserved for special occasions!)
A new favorite!

Delicious:) I found that a pinch of red peppers and a dash of black pepper really spiced it up.  Perfect sauce for Juanita Peek's Easy Lasagne recipe.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  I had never attempted alfredo, I was afraid of scalding the cream.  You showed how easy it is - I'll never buy pre-made alfredo again!  I added garlic and green onion with the butter, and broccoli at the end.  Thanks again!

While this was the best alfredo sause ive made myself, their were alot of adjustments to be made. I added an atleast another half cup of heavy cream and lots of of seasoning. Even with all the extra cream it was still far too thick. The taste was great and i added garlic prawns but i think more cream needs to be added to the original recipe cause all in all it took me a while to get it just right. Maybe im just picky. Thanx regardless.

I love alfredo sauce. This one, however, has way too much parmesan! I love anything cheesy, but there was just too much parmesan. The sauce was much better with just a touch of the parmesean (basically a heavy cream and butter mixture).

Very good, came out smooth and delicious, especially since I made to my specifications (doctor it up). Very simple and quick to make. Why buy fettuccine sauce in a jar, can etc. with all the additives that you don’t need

This recipe was so simple and delicious.. I did add Black Pepper since - and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream because that is all I had.   If you use good fresh peccorino romano cheese -that makes alot of difference.  This will be our staple Alfredo Sauce go too.  Oh and Muffin Girl...relax.

I've made this with garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and half-and-half instead of cream and it was still good. Be sure to not overheat the parmesan because it can form a large lump of melted cheese impossible to work with!

My farm-boy-turned-meat-and-potatoes-man husband gave this four stars. That’s high praise from a very picky eater!  I made the recipe exactly as written except I had no grated Parmesan so I used shredded. I also pan seared some chicken, dusted it with Cajun seasoning and cut it into bite sized pieces. That went on top, after the lovely, rich Alfredo sauce. Yum!

I love this Base Alfredo recipe!! it is amazing.  After making it as instructed the first time though i've made some of my own tweaks.  instead of just using Parmesan cheese  I actually use an Italian blend cheese so it has a few different cheese flavors mixed in.  I also tend to use a higher quality, grass fed,  butter.  I'll also use  pepper to taste.   

Remember though this is a basic Alfredo, so it should be used to expand on and make different variances depending on what is desired for the dish.  :)

I've made many a sauce in my life, including alfredo, and this recipe is terrible. the ratio must be off. The cream and butter and cheese never combined. The "sauce" ended up with a gloppy cheese with seperated butter/cream. I whisked and whisked and whisked to no avail. Never again.

Very nice.  Worked well.  Have made it a few times.  I have also made it with less cream and some marinara sauce for a beautiful rose sauce.  Overall it is an excellent base.

This is a pretty standard Alfredo recipe and is solid gold.. 
It is an easy sauce to break by overheating or not keeping whisked so .. be warned..
Stick with the "name brand" Parmesan or get fresh parmesan reggiano..   I have not found an "off" brand of pre-grated parm that was worth a darn (too much like sawdust)  Hence perhaps if you use cheap cheese, you get "bland" flavor?

I thought it was amazing! but I recommend lowering the cheese amount to one cup and use half mozzarella and half parmesan. and add a half cup of cream cheese!

The secret is to Alfredo is to cook VERY slow. Medium-Low heat for 10-15 minutes while adding the parmesan, and add pinches of salt., pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder instead of cloves.  Comes out as good as a classic Italian restaurant.

I read some of the comments bellow, and I was wondering why my experience was soooo different than the negative ones.
Until one day I followed the recipe to the comma, and got the cheese-ball result.  I would therefore recommend to respect the butter and heavy-cream ration (for a thick and flavorful result) and simply reduce the Parmesan to half of what the recipe suggests. Specially if your grating your Parmesan super thin, or buy the powder type; you'll be adding more Parmesan than required. So either weight it, or go with your guts. Less is more sometimes.

Better than any Restaurant Sauce with the addition of an Extra Garlic Clove~!!~ Extremely Addictive~!!~ I'm so making this into a Tomato Alfredo Sauce by adding a can of Organic Tomatoes and Basil. I used to buy a Jar of Tomato Alfredo Sauce at Aldi's and they don't carry it any more so why not make it. It's going to be Soooo gooood~!!~ :)

It is simple and the family loved it.  We have trying to get away from buying process foods.  It is. Ice to make the alfredo not from a mix or jar.

It is an awesome, EASY, rich creamy base Alfredo sauce. It's what you do with it that either makes it incredible or a boring edible.
You can see in the recipe that there isn't even salt or pepper. Adding some fresh ground pepper and a dash of salt to the sauce is kind of a no brainer. I agree with the others that said shredded cheese was far better than the Kraft parm. 
I sauteed mushrooms and onion in some butter and garlic. I boiled some fresh spinach and feta ravioli, drained it and threw it into the pan with the mushrooms and onion. I sauteed that for a few minutes  before adding the sauce. 
It was beautiful when plated, the smell alone intoxicating and the taste definitely 5 stars and had the ability to impress!
Use the sauce as your base and use your brain for some inspiration!

I gave this a 5 star because it's the easiest and best basic Alfredo Sauce recipe I've found.  I did make some changes though after reading all the other recipes and some reviews of this one.  I used half the butter and the same amount of extra virgin olive oil.  I added the garlic to the oil before the cream.  The hot oil pulls all the flavor out of the garlic.  Don't brown it though.  I added a dash of white pepper.  I used a combination of Italian cheeses, Parmesan, Romano, Asaigo, and Provolone.  For Heaven's sake, DON'T use that powdered Parmesan.  It has Cellulose and preservatives in it that make it not cream as well.  Slivers of fresh Basil make a good garnish.

I wouldn't use the grated Parm...I'd go with finely shredded. I also would suggest garlic powder. I've never been too great at chopping up garlic cloves for some reason...but using garlic powder and finely shredded cheese works great!

I doubled all ingredients except parmesan cheese. I used 2 cups of pre shredded parmesan cheese. I used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic and skipped the parsley. A little salty on its own but amazing on fettuccine and chicken. My favorite alfredo sauce ever. Yum.

Delicious.  I made some changes just based on what I had.  I only had 3/4 cup of heavy cream so I used milk for the last 1/4 cup.  I had just over a cup of freshly grated Parmesan, so I added shredded mozzarella for the rest of the cheese.  Added a second clove of garlic and a little garlic pepper.  Per other reviewers I whisked gently the entire time as soon as I added the cheese and had no separation or grittiness issues.  I can't speak to leftovers because it all got eaten.  Served with sliced sausage over fettuccini and not only was it tasty, but it was one of the easier meals I make.

Great recipe! It's super easy to make and easy to convert into another sauce. When I make it I only use half then save the other for the next night. I will char a red pepper on the grill with a little olive oil then warm up the leftover alfedo. Take out the seeds of the pepper and quarter it and place it in a food processor and add the warm Alfredo. Serve it over grilled chicken breast or mozzarella stuffed meatloaf. It's great and my son loves it!

I used half shredded Romano, half  shredded Parmesan. My only other changes: I put my crushed garlic in after the butter had melted and let it sizzle slightly for a few seconds, then added the cream. It's also always been my custom to put a pinch of fresh grated nutmeg in Alfredo, so I did that as well...I loved this recipe, because other Alfredo recipes I've tried have had egg. You have to be so super careful to add the egg so it won't cook or curdle. No worries regarding that here....This is a lovely sauce! Alfredo is not supposed to pack a big punch! It's supposed to be delicate, cheesy, and subtle! This lived up to my expectations of a good Alfredo, and it was so EASY!

Omg!! This recipe is so simple yet very delicious. My very first time making Alfredo Sauce from scratch and I impressed myself lol. No more store bought sauce for me. I made the sauce just as it is. The only adition was at the very end, I added seared chopped chicken breast that I made about 10 mins prior to making the sauce. The chicken simmered with the sauce. Deeelicious!

This was so easy and yummy. I used unsalted butter, half & half, just 1 cup of Kraft shredded Parmesan cheese, and omitted the parsley. The only thing it needed was a few dashes of Cavender's Greek seasoning. Amazing!

OMG what a easy recipe, Of course I tweaked it a bit to my liking. I added more garlic, a little more parmesan cheese. I added mushrooms & peas & chicken after I made the sauce. Nice thing was so good no left overs. So easy even if you can hardly cook you can make this sauce,

I made it for the first time tonight.  Husband likes meat in all supper dishes, but instead of chicken, I used crisp bacon.    Didn't change anything else though.  It was awesome, definitely a keeper.

I've made this many times. One time I made plans to make this for my Aunt and I. By the night of the dinner she invited her neighbors and another friend of hers. No pressure. 
  I used a recipe for garlic bread I found in my magic bullet cookbook and balsamic strawberries for dessert from here also.  I followed the recipe exactly except I like more garlic and I use already crushed from a jar. I pre-measure everything first and put on standby.  With the cream you don't want to take the time to measure something mid boil and risk burning the cream. 
  Timing was perfect and everything finished in prefect sequence. I got great reviews including "better than any restaurant". My Aunt had broken out the fine china and the table looked like a fancy restaurant.  Best meal ever.

Quick and easy Alfredo Sauce.  Yes, it's high in fat, but that's Alfredo sauce ...or at least the kind of Alfredo we wanted.  I used a wedge of parmesan and grated it just before using, adding a three-finger pinch to the pot at a time, stirring until melted, and then adding another pinch until all the cheese was incorporated.  Of course it separates when you heat it up again, so don't plan to have leftovers.  They taste fine, but you're reminded of just how much fat is in there when it separates on the reheat.  I probably used more garlic than the recipe calls for, but I do that in just about everything I cook.  Disclaimer: I've never lived in Italy, never gone to culinary school, and didn't expect this recipe to not present a very real risk to my coronary arteries.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I work in a high school and my supplier didn't bring me any Alfredo sauce for my lunch that day.  I looked up an easy recipe and made this for 400 teenagers.  They loved it, and were even asking for another lunch!  With my limited resources, I only had ground Parmesan, and bought half and half.  And that worked great.  I will make this at home!  Never buy a jar of sauce again people.  This is too quick and easy, and tastes way better!

This is my first time making any sauce and it would not be my last! I made it exact and it turned out fantastic!! I cannot believe I have been buying store bought Alfredo sauce all these year. lol I added shrimp to mine to make shrimp alfredo. I pan seared the shrimp in butter and olive oil in a separate pan for about 5 minutes while the sauce was simmering. I added the shrimp to the sauce after it was done and let it sit for another 7-10 minutes so the sauce could thicken. If you're a newbie this is a GREAT recipe that would make you look like real chef. Cannot wait to my leftovers for lunch later :)

Love this recipe!  It makes an excellent alfredo sauce, rich and creamy. I made it with parmesan and, as the chef who posted the recipe notes, the cheese is difficult to melt. Didn't matter--it tasted amazing.  I cooked some chicken breast in the pan first, then made the alfredo sauce in the same pan--excellent. I'll make this again and again.

This is the first time I've ever made anything from a recipe off the internet. I've recently, at 45, decided to learn to really cook - not just heat things up or sauté veggies and boil pasta. The first time I messed up. I used salted butter against the advice of many here who recommended using unsalted butter, and I used shredded parmesan in stead of grated. It was waaaaaaaay to rich and the parmesan didn't melt thoroughly. The second time, I used UNSALTED butter and GRATED parmesan, but I still used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1. IT IS DELICIOUS!!!!

Absolutely amazing and much better than any store bought Alfredo Sauce. If you make this REMEMBER! GRATED not SHREDDED Parmesan and UNSALTED not SALTED Butter.

I saved the remainder and put it in the fridge. It formed into a solid paste when I removed it from the fridge just now. I'm not sure if that is supposed to happen, but it tasted delicious as leftovers! I just sautéed some mushrooms and spinach in olive oil in a large ceramic coated frying pan, added two spoonfuls of the sauce in paste form, and added cold, precooked pasta. If I hadn't made it myself, I would have thought it was leftover pasta from an upscale Italian restaurant.

Can't wait to try my next recipe!!!

I've cooked this recipe several times and it is amazing! The trick is to keep it on a very low heat so that the butter and cream doesn't separate. I've made the mistake of turning the heat up to speed it up but that's a definite no-go. I also use the shredded parmesan and finely chop it before adding in so it melts better. Mushroom and bacon are a great addition to this recipe as well as broccoli and chicken :) Enjoy!

Simple ingredients. It was great! I had to do it twice. First time the cheese didn't melt very well and made the sauce gritty. That is due to my overly hot gas stove. Have to cook it the second time on the lowest setting and it came out perfect. It's not good the second day when you have to microwave it. The cheese and butter will separate. It's only good to eat up fresh! But this recipe satisfied my cravings! Thanks for the post

I have used this recipe before and again today. I didn't have any heavy cream on hand, so I used 2 cups of 2% milk and an 8 oz package of cream cheese instead. I wisked the milk into the pan with the melted butter along with two cloves of minced garlic and let these ingredients cook on med/low heat. After adding the brick of lowfat cream cheese, I let that melt down constantly wisking until the sauce finally thickened up. Served with pre-cooked Cajun seasoned chicken and angel hair pasta. Quick and easy weeknight meal. Loved it!

I made this recipe exactly with only the following modifications: 1 cup parm cheese instead of 1 1/2 cups and upping the garlic cloves from 1 to 2. However my sauce came out very thick. Does anyone have any ideas why? I don't think those modifications have anything to do with the thickness. Thanks.

My family loves this alfredo sauce recipe! I substituted whole milk and about 7 ozs. of cream cheese for heavy cream because I had none on hand. Also used less parmesan cheese added a bit of dry sherry. So easy and delicious. I'll definitely make it again.

I thought this sauce was delicious. It was a little thick and salty, I thinned it with a little half and half. I did add a pinch of crushed red pepper and Italian seasoning to the butter and a pinch of nutmeg to the cream mixture. It was really good. Quick and easy to make. The fat calories are ridiculous, this is not something to eat on a regular basis.

Very good! I cut the recipe in half for just my husband and myself and I wish I had made more!I think alfredo sauce really requires a good quality Parmesan Reggiano in order to work and have a good flavor; this is what I used and it melted perfectly! I followed another reviewer's tip about whisking during the cream-butter 'simmer stage' and added the cheese a little at a time...perfect! Keep the heat low for the duration of this recipe. I like a thinner sauce myself so I added a good splash of milk at the end and whisked it to the consistency I like- no problems with separation...I also used garlic powder instead of the real thing!

Incredible. This sauce is better than anything I've had in a restaurant. I used kerrygold salted butter, organic heavy cream,  and organic grated parmesan. I only simmered for about 3 mins and the sauce was ready in about 5. A keeper.

It was decent, but not really a keeper.  Cheese didn't melt well, so the mixture didn't turn out smooth and creamy like the Alfredo sauce I'm used to.  It was also really bland, even with all that cheese.  Definitely needed more flavor.

Whoa!  So easy ; so good!  I used 1% milk and a few sprinkles of garlic powder ( all I had in the pantry), with unsalted butter and fresh shredded parm/Romano blend. Tossed with fettuccini. Hfs this was delicious!

So my mom came up with this great idea, we have four family members in our household and she told us each to pick a day Monday - Thursday  (we eat out on Fridays). Once we had picked our night she said "great on that night you cook dinner and do the dishes. No if, and 's, or buts about it." Me and my younger brother are sometimes picky and complain about dinner and that was her solution. In all honesty I love it! I have learned  how to cook so many different things some dishes that my mom has never even made. And tonight I made this Alfredo sauce and they all loved it, it tastes so delicious and creamy I'm definitely going to be making this again! (She also has a rule about phones it's very easy to remember, if you bring it to the table it gets taken away. Ha let's just say she runs things in our house)

Unbelievably quick and easy, but I get so many compliments on this when I make it.  And there was nothing I had to tweak (and I ALWAYS feel the need to experiment and add my own twist).

Delicious flavor, but the texture was a little loose and grainy.  I added a tempered egg yolk and it tightened up a bit and created a little more of a velvety texture - it also eased the grainy texture a bit.  Definitely would make again!

This is an excellent base recipe. I think for full flavor, it needs quite a bit more. I doubled the recipe as leftovers are a must have in this house. I added just a sliver of butter at first and sautéed 1 full finely chopped shallot and added the rest of the butter then heavy cream as instructed. For a double batch, I only added one garlic clove (since I already added the shallot). I also added NO salt considering I put shallot and garlic in. In went the cheese and I added paprika, oregano and quite a bit of pepper before adding the parsley. For what it's worth, I added the curly leafed parsley and not flat leaf (it seems to chop better and personally I really think the flavor is different). I love parsley so I added a little extra as well. I don't have any for leftovers. My 16 month old kept saying "Mmmmm. More?" I gotta say there's no better validation than your kids eating all their dinner and asking for more. And honestly? Best alfredo sauce I've ever had with those additions, and of course broccoli, chicken and garlic bread!

Made this as per recipe with the exception of adding 2 egg yolks to help thicken. Was a little slower than I expected to get creamy smooth, but it was well worth the wait. I'd put this recipe up against any Italian place in town. Creamy, rich, just the right texture with the little particles of parmesan floating around. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.

Pretty decent recipe for a basic alfredo sauce.  First time I made it, I didn't let it simmer long enough for the cheese to melt.  The next time, I added the cheese a little at a time, and kept continually stirring.  It also helped the cream to thicken up a little bit as well.  We like garlic, so I used 2 cloves (and will probably add even more next time!).  I also added some pepper to give a little bit more flavor.

I liked it. But original Alfredo sauce was not made with cream. Its 1/2 cup unsalted butter and 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano and 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the pasta water with garlic of course. But I like this version with the cream also but the original is much much better and people please don't use margarine use butter and fresh Parmigiano Reggiano

when I tried this sauce, it didn't go so well.. the Parmesan cheese never melted into the sauce, and whenever I tasted it (while it was cooking) it wasn't very good.  this might be bc the cheese wasn't fresh, but that can only do so much.

This is such an easy recipe full of flavor, only complaint is it's one time use, no reheating, everything separates, but it's so good there are rarely any leftovers!

I doubled this recipe and followed almost to a T, knowing that authentic alfredo is not just parm, I also used shaved asiago and romano cheeses. This sauce needs to be stirred CONStANTLY with a wisk so it does not seperate, also, I find that parm is difficult to melt, so leave it on the stove for a while after finishing on LOW mixing it while making your noodles and protein and it melts it just takes a bit. I also found this to be too thick, mixed one cup of cheese in at a time and omitted the third cup. I also added some milk because I still wasnt satisfied with the consistency....Also alfredo really NEEDS black pepper so I added a tablespoon near the end ;)

Bland, uninspiring, and expensive, not to mention fattening. I am one to splurge on calories in favor of flavor, but this sauce does not redeem itself. If you do decide to try, at least double the garlic and listen to the other reviewers--do not use Kraft or similar Parmesan cheese. Better to use your ingredients elsewhere than end up with a grainy sauce.

So easy and very yummy! Love the use of fresh parsley, and crushing the garlic and adding it at the very end makes the flavor more pronounced. This mixture doesn’t lend itself to being smooth, but the flavor is there and we don’t mind a few unmelted pieces of parmesan in our sauce. TIP: The parmesan adds sufficient salt, so use unsalted butter. Try pairing this recipe with eggplant croquettes.

Excellent recipe. I've used it in my chicken florentine and on my alfredo pizza. I have found it works well regardless of the milk/cream I use, so I just use what is on hand. I often add extra garlic as our family likes it that way. I have also used parmesan cheese from a can with no complaints

Let me just offer some advice, if you want the cheese to melt better and have a different flavor add mozzarella instead of parm. It tastes so much better and has a very rich flavor. I have made this for chicken alfredo lasagna and people honestly just love it!! So if you think it is too gritty try mozzarella!!

We made this for dinner tonight. It was so easy my 7 year old helped! We didn't add the parsley but we did add diced chicken and mushrooms slightly sautéed in butter. We added a little extra cream to adjust for the extra butter and another clove of garlic into the chicken and mushrooms. We will be making it again!

I had to use milk instead of cream, cause that is all I had, I used a little corn starch to thicken it, but I probably didn't need it. I didn't have fresh parsley so I put a tinny bit of cilantro. We loved this and the cilantro was an amazing  change.

I thought it had WAY too much cheese in it. I'm used to a much thinner Alfredo sauce. I would recommend about 1/3 as much cheese.

very good, I added seasoning on chicken, cooked it then pulled the chicken out and made the sauce in the same pan.  I also added extra garlic.  Good and quick.

Really good; can make it less fatty and it would taste fine I'm sure;  don't leave out the fresh parsley; fresh Parmesan was still gritty so I'd be curious what it tastes like with gruyere cheese;  kids didn't like

This was wonderful!  I was looking for a side dish, and this was great.  Did lighten it some -- used fat free half-and-half and Smart Balance (the kind with olive oil).  Perfect -- still tasted rich.   Thanks!

Tasted as good as any restaurant alfredo. Gave it four stars not five because I did not  like how the parmesan cheese melted- kinda of clumpy would be the best way to describe it. I followed all the suggestions-not canned shredded parm, watched my heat, constant stirring.  adding parsley hid the "clumpy" so no one knew but me-  My son said its Olive Garden at home. Now that's a true compliment from him.

Made this for my daughter's 21st birthday get together last night and it was a major hit. Everyone LOVED IT!

I  sauteed my garlic with my butter (salted butter)and I added a little white wine for taste.

This was really good and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and didn't measure exactly and it still turned out well. Most importantly it was delicious and didn't seperate. I melted one stick of butter in a pan and added four large cloves of garlic. I let the garlic soften for a few minutes. Next, I poured in one half carton of heavy cream and grateda block of parmesan cheese right into the pan. I stirred every minute or two to make sure the cheese was melting and the cream wasn't burning to the pan. The sauce will thicken once it starts to simmer. This is where you want to make sure to stir constatly. If you start making the alfredo at the same time that you start the water for the noodles the sauce should thicken enough by the time the noodles are done. So yummy! Everyone loves it.

I really like this but I had to tweak it a bit. As I was melting the butter I added the garlic to it. Then I added 1 cup Parmesan and 1 cup Mozzarella cheese. I also added my home grown basil and oregano to the mixture.
I'm a meat lover but since it's Lent, I added broccoli and shrimp to the sauce and poured it over the pasta. My husband said it tastes better than the Italian restaurant we go to.

It didn't work - tried three times! Everyone says it is so easy but it is clumpy every time. Butter and cheese separate. Not sure what I am doing wrong but it happened three times.

My first time making homemade Alfredo and WOW! It turned out so amazing. I did add about 1/4 more of cream and 3 more cloves of garlic because I'm obsessed. This was so delicious that my picky 2 year old ate it! He told me it was "so delicious"! Definitely going into my recipe book.

Incredibly simple to make! Alfredo sauce was a last minute decision tonight and all I had on hand was Neufchatel cheese and shredded parmesan/Romano. I also didn't add quite as much milk after reading another review, using only 1 1/3 cups. This will be my go -to recipe for Alfredo sauce.

Great base to jump off from! I used a full 2cups of light cream, added nutmeg, mustard powder, cayenne powder, black pepper, and I used a bag of grated mixed Italian cheese - you need to add a cup of water if you do this. Awesome!! -

This recipe was simple and perfect.  I used it and adjusted the recipe for 50 servings to feed my son's wrestling team.  They ate and went back for second's. The key to great sauce with dairy is slow and low.  Wisk the entire time and use the best ingredients you can afford. Butter and heavy cream are the perfect combination and with the garlic and Parmesan it was like liquid gold.  Thanks for a easy and adjustable base recipe.

This recipe is so easy, and it came out positively delicious.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it did't keep well.  When I reheated for later eating, it separated and was very greasy, and the consistency was not desirable.  This time I will not toss with pasta and just put the sauce in a different container.

This is a great basic Alfredo recipe. Although, I used powered Parmesan and it turned out a little grainy.  Also, I used evaporated milk and it was a little too rich. So follow the recipe as is!

Loved it.. and to all of you who say it's gritty or tastes like sand, did you use FRESH GRATED parm as the recipe suggests or did you use a shaker of the dried stuff? If you use FREST GRATED I am sure you will find you have a different result...

I have made this recipe many times and have never had it too salty or gritty.... please give it another chance with fresh cheese!

Was looking for something quick to make after working late. Popped some tortellini in a pan to boil and to my surprise I had everything to make this sauce. It came out great and I saved it for later use to make again. Thanks for posting.

I had a block of imported parmesan cheese so I shredded that and added extra clove of garlic.  Even with a lot of whisking this still came out grainy.  The parm flavor was way too strong but that may be due to the imported block I used.  Otherwise it was easy.  But I don't think I will be making this recipe again.

This was ok but kind of bland. I think the garlic should be gently cooked in the butter before adding the cream. Another recipe I have that I think is better uses a full stick of butter for 1c of cream.

Wonderful alfredo recipe! I sauteed the garlic in the butter as it melted, then added the cream. I used shredded parm, and I agree with others -- there is a world of difference in flavor.

The only alterations I made were just matters of personal preference. I added black pepper, a sprinkle of nutmeg and a TBSP or so of chopped green onions at the very end.

I did end up having to thin the sauce a bit with some milk. (I probably cooked the cream too long, but that's easily corrected). Just an FYI -- this is enough sauce for about 1/2 to 2/3 lb. of pasta, depending on the pasta type and thickness of the sauce. I used linguine, and it was fantastic! Thanks for sharing!

Used the recipe to double check my butter-cream-cheese ratio. Here's a secret: try adding just a 1/4 pinch of nutmeg (like 15 grains) to the sauce. Its amazing!

Made this Alfredo sauce to go over fettucine as a side dish for Garlic Chicken breast.  I found it a little thick when making it but thinned it out by adding more milk.  My husband (Mr. Picky) loved the sauce! I liked it to but I felt like I needed to add a little salt to mine. Very good recipe, will be making it again.

I was really excited for this after reading reviews. But, sadly, it was not that good. Maybe I did something wrong? I followed this recipe exactly as directed and after adding only half the Parmesan the safe was gritty and tasted terrible. I had to substitute milk for heavy cream, add salt and pepper and shredded mozzarella to cut the harshness of the cheese. If you like it sharp then this may be good. But I'd recommend using more mozzarella than Parmesan or maybe a milder cheese. Fresh Parmesan was too sharp and gritty for my taste. So, it's possible I did something wrong. But was very disappointed. I'll try again with some other cheese options and see.

This is an awesome recipe.  This was the first time I have ever made a homemade Alfredo sauce.  My family LOVED it.  I knew this was a keeper when my VERY PICKY 6 year old asked for seconds.  I followed the recipe exactly and to my surprise I didn't need to add any salt or seasoning.  This really does remind me of the Alfredo sauce at O.G.

SUPER SIMPLE AND FAT-LADEN, but oh so good! I only had 1/2c. wh. cream, so to thicken a bit I made a roux of 1 T butter and ! T flour, whisked that together (a roux makes the flour NOT lump), then proceeded with the rest of the recipe.  I used three cloves of garlic, not one, and I used 1/2 gruyere and 1/2 Parmesan. DELISH, QUICK!

I surprised my husband with this recipe last night & HE LOVED IT. My whole household loved. This recipe is a keeper & it taste like or even better than restaurants.

I was so blessed to find mostly everything cheap or on sale at the grocery store. I did not use the bag cheese like others suggested. I used the parmesan cheese in the container & the cheese melted perfectly. My husband added onions, pepper, & sautéed chicken breast while it was cooking. I served it over noodles with some garlic bread. This recipe was so delicious. You must try this.

The only thing we may do different next time is add a little fresh mushrooms or fresh spinach.

This is awesome!  Had a huge pregnancy craving for 'good' alfredo, not jarred.  Never use jarred again!!  So good, I doubled the recipe, didn't have enough parmesan on hand so used a blend of mozzarella and provolone along with 2 cups of parmesan.  So good and easy to make.

I was craving something cheesy/creamy and since starting a gluten-free diet, that limits me a bit, but then I thought "Alfredo!"  As I always do, I tweaked the recipe, but used this as my guide.  I tripled the garlic, doubled the cheese, doubled the parsley, and doubled the cream...as a runner, this is not something I would normally do, but hey, indulgences are okay on occasion, right?  I think the one thing the recipe neglects to say is the let the sauce "rest" for a few minutes of the heat until it thickens.  I served with minimally peppered, baked chicken--yumm!!!!

An excellent and easy to make Alfredo sauce. I give mine a little variety by crumbling about four slices of baked bacon into the nearly-complete sauce.

This recipe is nasty!! Garlic is overwhelming, and the sauce is bitter. If you go into a restaurant it should be creamy and sweet. I followed it step by step, exact ingredients. (I am also an alfredo lover, we make it all the time)

Make more! and never add cheese over higher than LOW heat (and never stop stirring it if you leave it on the heat) or add last completely off heat.  Garlic and good cheese makes an Alfredo.  Forget the shake sawdust cheese in a plastic container.

It is excellent! To anyone who says it's bland, you probably used crappy cheese from the grocery store. That stuff is not good. Go to an Italian Deli or an upscale market and buy the real Pecorino Romano cheese. You will see the difference!

OMG! This recipe is FABULOUSLY AMAZING!!!  I am ashamed that I used to buy jarred alfredo sauce - never again!! This is sooo easy with only a few REAL ingredients! I doubled the recipe and added a little extra garlic & cream.  Also added 3 cut up cooked chicken breasts and fresh broccoli - OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! Served with garlic bread. The entire family raved about it & went back for more.  I can't wait for lunch (leftovers!!!)! Thanks for such an awesome sauce....Allrecipes ROCKS!  :o]

I gave this recipe a four because I added some changes.  The changes I made definitely made it a ten.  First, I cooked some shrimp with cayenne, garlic, green onions, onion powder, and garlic powder.  Then I continuously whisked the butter and cream together for about 5 minutes, then I added the 1 pound of shrimp and immitation crab meat, a little bit more whipping cream and parmesan cheese,and 1 can of mushrooms, garlic, parsley, and added some ground pepper and tonys seasoning... it ended up being soo yummy!  My husband and I gobbled it up!!!!  He loved it!!!!

Made this last night. I made 1 1/2 batches for my family of 6. Perfect amount! Really awesome flavor. I added just a dash of salt. Otherwise followed recipe exactly. It was PERFECT!

One of the best Alfredo sauces we've found. I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding the parsley at the end because I didn't have any on hand and I like my Alfredo sauces with just the cream, butter, and cheese. Thanks!

I actually combined two recipes, but the ingredients listed here are in the recipe.  I started with one cup of chicken broth, added minced garlic, one small, thinly sliced onion, salt and pepper; let boil.  Then reduced the heat, added one cup of heavy cream, 3/4 cup of fresh grated parmesan and 1/2 cup of fresh grated pecorino romano.  I simmered on low for approx. 20 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent separating.  Added the parsley as a garnish on top of the mixed pasta and noodles.  I added a pre-cooked chicken from the grocery store to this as well.  So good.

Made as is to serve over spinach fettucine. Simple enough to make, but was a tad too salty, overwhelming the pasta. Next time, unsalted butter and maybe a bit less cheese to cut down on the salt. Also 1/4 cup is WAY too much parsley - probably only needed a few sprigs of it chopped.

I was shocked how well this came together! I managed to injure myself while chopping the parsley, and even preparing one-handed, it came out great! I thought I made it to as written, but thinking back, I believe I forgot the garlic.  Butter was salted; and I threw in a few shakes of pepper for some color.  It was a crowd pleaser!

The first time I made this I had to slightly adjust and substitute with what I had on hand.  Fam loved it.  It was really smooth and yummy.  Second time I made it exactly how it says and it had a slight rough texture to it.  Smelled great, and "taste" was good, but texture made it not so great.  I'm doing 3 stars for now, but I will definitely want to try it again and see what the problem was.

Great recipe! I think the people who are complaining didn't follow the recipe properly. I used almost two cups of real parmesan cheese, and unsalted butter. It was great, thanks for the share.

I used this sauce on a chicken alfredo pizza and I loved it. Very simple to make and didn't take much time at all. I did whisk the butter & cream while it was simmering before I whisked in the garlic & cheese too. I forgot to get parsley while I was at the grocery store so I made it without and it was still very good. It

Great recipe & super quick; I can offer a few tips I found are helpful;
don't get the butter too hot before you add the cream; start adding the cream very, very slowly at first and whisk the entire time - but this recipe only takes 5 minutes or so. I used about a half a wedge (4 oz) of Fontenella cheese cut into small chunks. The cheese is soft and very flavorful. After that I add a half cup of parmaesan cheese & the Fontenella really helps blend the parmasan. To avoid oversaltiness, I don't season until the end with pepper, parsley, garlic and marjoram. It is better to use unsalted butter but if you cut out the parmasan & only use 8 oz of fontenella, it will be just right even with salted butter. The marjoram gives a nice very subtle flavor.

I thought the recipe was very good.  I doubled the recipe, and used 1/4 C dried parsley and 1 cup of kraft grated parmesan cheese.  To it, I added 2 cooked, cubed chicken breast halves, and 2 cooked broccoli crowns and served with pasta.  I'm updating my review.  Although the recipe tastes good, I'm afraid it is too unhealthy for me to make again.  When removing the leftover sauce from the refrigerator the net day to reheat, the sauce was solid - like a stick of butter, which made me actually think about how unhealthy this recipe must be.

I tried this tonight. I added 2-3 oz of cream cheese and about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, like other reviews suggested. I cut back on the parmesan cheese just a little. Wow! Olive Garden copycat is right. I loved it. WIll be making this again and again.

I did as others suggested and added more garlic (two cloves instead of one).  It was very rich and yummy!!  Unfortunately, I couldn't get the Parmesan cheese to completly melt.  I used the shredded kind you buy in the bags.  Next time I'll get a chunk of fresh and grate it myself.

If you use 2 - 3 ounces cream cheese (when your cream is hot, the cream cheese will melt into it), you can use less Parmesan cheese. Start with 1/2 cup and increase to taste. A little white pepper is also a welcome addition.

This is the same recipe I have used for years.  One foolproof way of making sure the cheese melts beautifully and the sauce doesn't separate is to use a double boiler. Perfect every time.  I always add fresh ground pepper for a little more interest.

Flavor was good. I added salt and pepper and a few garlic cloves. I thought 1 1/2 C was too much cheese. I was so clumpy and wouldn't melt.

Fabulous sauce! I added 1 T. flour to the melted butter (previous reviewer's note - for thickening), more garlic, and I added onion powder and a little pink sea salt. Really, really yummy! THANK YOU for this recipe!

The taste of this sauce is outstanding!  My only complaint was that it seemed a bit runny to me, but that is easily fixed by either simmering the butter & cream longer or by mixing in a little flour with the butter before adding the cream, which is what I plan on doing next time.  My usual go-to recipe for alfredo has cream cheese in it, but I don't always have cream cheese on hand and this recipe is much simpler - and just as tasty, if not better!  I also add in a touch of salt and pepper and with any white sauce, I add in a little freshly grated nutmeg.  I love the simplicity of this recipe and that you can really customize it to fit your own personal taste!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. It is so easy! We added shrimp to the butter and garlic phase, then added the cream and cheese once the shrimp had cooked up a bit. Served broccoli on the side. Turned out to be a fantastic, quick, meal. I recommend this recipe.

Super easy to make, easy to remember! SO much better than the pre-made canned stuff. I will NEVER buy pre-made alfredo sauce again. I have found that if you don't allow the cream and butter a few minutes to simmer, the cheese does not combine well. I usually add a little black pepper and sometimes dried oregano instead of parsley if we're out of parsley.

If you have left-overs, heating goes more smoothly if you reheat in a small saucepan, stirring constantly. Refrigerated, the butter tends to separate.

Very Rich and Creamy!  Easy to make and delicious to eat!  I added 1 garlic clove, crushed with butter and lightly sauteed till lightly browned.  I like a garlicky tasting alfredo sauce.  I bought prepared mushroom ravioli and added the alfredo sauce and it tasted like it was all homemade and delicious!

A true-to-parmesan Alfredo recipe here. The key is to use the fresh grated sort. It will render awesome bursting flavor on every noodle. I don't tend to tweek a recipe on 1st try, but I did here because I am a lover of garlic. Garlic should swim with butter for 5-minutes prior to adding the cream. Don't forget the finely cracked peppercorn on the finish, and NO salt! Fantastic simple little recipe. You will LOVE it!

Yum!  Simple Alfredo sauce that can be modified to make other dishes.   Two things...the recipe does not call for salt or pepper which I believe was an oversight, but be careful....parmesan is salty in its own right so its easy to over salt.  Its also important to GRATE your parmesan or it won't melt properly.  I used shredded...pretty lumpy...my fault.

Followed directions with a few modifications:  substituted half and half for cream and used 1/2 tblsp each dried oregano and basil in lieu of parsley. Also added about 1 cup of jarred tomato basil pasta sauce and chopped, cooked chicken.

Very good.  I used half paremesan and half romano.  I think the flavor was a bit too strong o next time I will try the Gruyere or mozzeralla to smooth out the flavor.  Otherwise it's really too good.

this recipe is simple. It's just missing some key ingredients, salt and pepper. Without it, your sauce will be quite bland. Also, I like to add a little chicken stock to enhance the flavor.

Simple and basic ingredients which can be swapped for what's on hand or fancied up if you feel like it. I used a blend of fresh grated cheddar, gyerie and parm. I loaded up with pepper and sautéed the garlic I'm olive oil before adding the cream and cheese. Skipped the butter since I used olive oil. Added fresh basil at the end since I had that and had no parsley. This will be my go to for alfredo from here on out, it's just so versatile.

Quick and easy,. Don't be tempted to cut corners by using cheese that was purchased grated; it does not melt so well. At times, I have subbed half and half for the cream with good results, and have added the crushed garlic with the butter and then removed it before adding the cheese. Definitely a keeper, for a weeknight or more elaborate meal. I really love it with campanelle pasta.

Yum yum yum! I did add a couple tbsp of italian seasoning to the recipe and it also needed a dash of garlic salt. Perhaps because I used unsalted butter? I also added a bit more milk to it and a little flour to keep the consistency from becoming too runny. I'm taking off a star because it definitely needs a bit more seasoning but otherwise it's a great and easy recipe!

My husband absolutely loves alfredo sauce! I found this recipe online and gave it a go He told me that it was probably the best alfredo sauce he has ever had. The only changes I made to it was that I added more parmesan cheese to it. Other than that...it was delicious.

Simplicity. A good cook knows the basics and this is almost perfect.
One tip. I sauté the garlic in the butter before adding the cream. Helps the garlic release it's full flavour. Add the cream and let it reach around 130f (slow of course) before you add the parm'. This will allow the sauce to fully combine the ingredients.

Just a tip- put garlic in the butter for a few min. and let it sizzle then add the cream... I also used 2 cloves instead of one and added some asiago cheese for extra flavour.
Turned out well!!

Just fantastic:
The only change in work flow I made was this: I diced the parsley and garlic in a blender together and added the mix to the heavy cream after it had simmered. The sauce was incredible. My guests absolutely loved it. I will never buy off the shelf Alfredo Sauce ever again.

It was delicious but I have a question so it can come out better next time...how long after you add the cheese are we whisking because i feel like my cheese never fully melted and there were little cheese clumps.  I whisked for like 10 mins.  I dont know if it was the type of parm cheese i used or because i didn't whisk long enough.

Excellent, easy recipe. It's a nice lighter recipe, with some nice parmesan flavor. The changes I made:

1. I added the garlic to the butter and browned it before adding the cream and cheese - if you're not worried about how it looks, I think it adds to the flavor (the born bits might be off-putting if you have guests coming).
2. I didn't measure the cream or the cheese; I estimate I added 1.25 cups of cream and well over 1.5 cups of cheese (probably closer to 3 cups of cheese). 
3. I added a pinch of white pepper and a few shakes of salt - the salt really brought the flavors out, which is that I suspect the people who thought this recipe is bland might need to do.

I made this over egg noodles, because I didn't have any other pasta in the house, and it came out delicious!

That was totally Awesome!!!!!!  I made this for my girlfriend for Mother's Day and she flipped over it!  I marinated some boneless/skinless chicken breast and some portobello mushrooms, ran them over a hot grill, sliced them up and did some acorn squash on the side.  MAJOR HIT!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Plan it next with grilled or pan seared  shrimp!

I am not much of a cook, but by necessity have been forced to eat at home more often now. That being said, I have been trying my hand at receipes I would normally go out to eat to get. I am a huge fan of the Olive Garden's Alfredo Sauce and this receipe is as close or not better than OG's! I did substitute a 3 cheese blend in place of the Parmesan alone. Thought I was going to lick the bowl it was so wonderful! Highly recomment this receipe for anyone who loves Alfredo sauce. Can't go wrong with this one!

Made this last night and it was phenomenal!  I even used cut rate ingredients, like green can of store brand parm and whole milk, still it was delicious.  I didn't have parsley but it was great without it.  Don't use salted butter!  I'm on a high salt diet, but for normal people, it might be too salty.  After I made this, I added warm chopped chicken, tomatoes and cooked spinach, then served it over spaghetti.  It was incredible.  Wish I had made more than a double batch!

This was SO good my whole family loved it and they are not big pasta or garlic fans.
I used whole wheat fettuccine and put in some cubed leftover chicken. I also added a bit of lemon juice to the sauce which gave it a nice flavor.
I used heavy cream and 1 TB of flour which I think made it a little too thick so next time I will leave as is. My sauce came out fairly smooth and you cant even tell when its mixed in with the pasta so I wouldn't worry about that part.

I ran into the same problem someone else did where the cheese and milk (I did use milk, not cream) separated and it was lumpy and not very appealing.  I added some Italian cheese blend (about 1/4 c) and then added about a 1/3 of a stick of low-fat cream cheese and poured in a little more milk.  The cream cheese really seemed to help "smooth out" the sauce.  I also added some Wildtree Scampi blend to the milk and butter for a tasty garlic flavor. (in addition to the clove of garlic)  
Tossed it with tortellini and steamed broccoli.  It was good,  but I think I might change up the cheese next time.

So easy and tasty too. I will make this again. I added chicken and frozen broccoli, carrots and cauliflower to the sauce. I used the shredded parm as someone else suggested and half and half because that is what I had on hand. It was amazing and even better then next day for lunch.

great quick alfredo sauce. Next time I'll take out a bit of the butter. I added a pinch of nutmeg, onion powder and garlic powder. Otherwise I left it the same. Thanks!

A nice simple tasty sauce. I did use a little corn starch to thicken it slightly.

Made this last night to go over ravioli.  It was absolutely delicious and VERY easy to make!  Used unsalted butter instead of regular butter, and I doubled the batch.  Be sure to use grated parmesan from a tub instead of a bag -- I started with grated parm out of a bag and it doesn't melt so well.  I added more from a tub (like Boars Head, you can find it in the deli case) and that melted divinely.  Upon our first bite, we could still "feel" the grated parm from the bag, so it will be tub for me from now on!  DELICIOSO!!

Simple and delicious. I have made this multiple times with low fat evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream. I also bought the already shreaded parmesan cheese and this could not be simpler and quicker.

Great sauce. Hubby loves it and he is a picky eater! I use skimmilk instead of the heavy whipping cream. If the sauce is too thin i thicken it with cornstarch up! Yummy!

This is the easiest and best tasting Alfredo sauce I have ever made! There are never any leftovers when I make it for anyone. The only complaint I have ever gotten is that there is never enough to satisfy a third helping :)

Yummy. I left out the parsley because I had people who don't care for it. I added sweet italian sausage and got rave reviews for such an easy recipe. Fresh garlic is the way to go on this one.

very simple and yet very delicious. i made a few tweaking... i used 2 cups of all-purpose cream, 1/2 cup of butter and instead of using just parm cheese, i used 3/4 cup parm plus 2 tbsp cream cheese. i used 1 clove of garlic as instructed and it was enough to keep my sauce garlicky. then mix mix mix with a whisk on my pan. when all are incorporated into a thick, creamy sauce i added the japanese parsley. yum yum yum!!! my friends loved it and asked for the recipe. thank you for sharing this! :-)

I used garlic butter and no cloves, It was garlicky with just the butter.  I also used parmesan-reggiano.   I did as one user suggested and made sure to add the milk and cheese slowly, whisking the entire time.  It didn't separate on me.  Definately a keeper.

Just made this for my family and my 6 year old actually ate everything on her plate (anyone with a 6 year old understands what a big deal that is lol). It was lovely... I *did* use 2 cloves of garlic and added fresh ground black pepper, but found this recipe to be the perfect "basic" to tweak to your family's taste :-)

I had written of alfredo sauce.  I couldn't ever find one, ready made, that I liked.  
I made this sauce (minus the parsley) recently and it is amazing!  I used it with the Chicken Pesto Penne Casserole recipe that is on this site.  But before it made its way in to that dish I dipped a few pieces of chicken in the sauce to test it.  Love Love Love.  Can't wait to make it again!

This sauce is so easy to make and absolutely delicious as well!  What I did was I minced the garlic first. Then I melted the butter and then sauteed the garlic in the butter.  Then I added the heavy cream and simmered for the 5 minutes, then added the cheese.  I tossed it with linguine and sauteed spinach.  SOOO DELICIOUS!!  Even my SUPER picky 11 year old LOVED it!  Will definitely be making this one again!!

My boyfriend and I love this sauce! I add an extra clove of garlic and I also add a few dashes of white pepper and some fresh black pepper. We also love pesto so - depending on how pesto-y we want it - I add 1-2TB of pesto and it's super amazing! Try this with gnocchi or other pasta that will really collect the sauce.. I usually also grill or sautee some chicken with rosemary and a bit of garlic and pepper as well. Add some garlic bread and steamed broccoli and you have a fantastic Italian meal!! It's one of my boyfriend's top 2(!) meals I make, so I'd really recommend. 
P.S. As noted elsewhere, you should keep the sauce separate from the pasta if you'll need to reheat it later as the butter and cream separate and it can get a bit grainy if you don't whip it all back together. You can still microwave it, but again you'll just have to make sure it all gets smoothed back out.

Amazing sauce!! Very light and went wonderfully with cheese ravioli. Added 1/3 Romano to 2/3 Parmesan. The cheeses melted beautifully. Only used half the amount of parsley and opted for Italian Parsley.

Very very good! Tastes just like at a fancy Italian restaurant! I left out the parsley because I'm not that much of a fan but it still tasted wonderful to me and my husband.

Super easy recipe, and the flavor was fantastic! I used a garlic/basil blend instead of parsley, and added a bit of pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Definitely a keeper.

I came home from work tonight knowing I'd forgotten to leave something out for dinner! The horror! I needed something quick, simple, and good enough for a picky 3 year-old daughter, and this was definitely it. Followed the recipe almost to the letter, except when I melted my butter, I added about 3/4 tsp minced garlic. I had 1 c cream I needed to use up, and this worked perfectly, though I ended up thinning out the finished sauce with 1/4 c milk. I used finely shredded parm as well as the remainder of a bag of the finely shredded Italian blend, and had no issue with it not melting. Threw in a dash of nutmeg, freshly grated black pepper, and a pinch of sea salt and voila! Used the sauce over gnocchi and sausage and threw in some steamed peas for color. Will certainly make this over and over again.

11/11:matthew liked this recipe.  i halved it with half the pasta too.  whisk the whole time so that it doesn't separate.  good with bowties.
1/2014: i did not half it this next time but it did not need all that cheese, i only used 1 cup of cheese.  turned out too thick so i added some pasta water until the consistancy was right.  for me and larry i made a bag of steamed brocolli and split it in 2 bowls. also cut up a bunch of cherry tomatoes and put that in the bowls.  I sauted up a few chicken breasts in evoo and butter and put that in the sauce with the ziti.  Put it on top of the vegies for me and larry in our bowls.  THis way the delicious vegies did not touch matthews alfredo sauce.  we all liked it.

Very good and very easy. The cheese is a little bit heavy, so I added in a dash of milk to lighten up the sauce.

I used an extra clove of garlic only because I love garlic. Other than that I use everything else the same and this sauce is AMAZING! My family loves it. It is a major success in my kitchen.

After reading the reviews i was a little scared to try this. I am not a very good cook and i worried that it would turn out gritty like some have said, but it turned out PERFECT! I used Parmesan and it was just fine and not thick at all. I follow directions to a T because if i don't, i usually have no clue how to fix it haha. Not sure how people are ending up with a gritty, salty clump of sauce. Thanks and will definitely make this again!!!

AWESOMENESS! I loved the sauce I added a little salt for taste and my parmesan melted perfectly-maybe because it was finely shredded idk. Will definitely be using again.

This is delicious. Super quick, super easy. I did change a little, I used 2% milk instead of heavy cream used like 1.5 more cloves of garlic and added a bit of mayo. Sooo good!

Great alfredo sauce base!  I used fresh grated nutmeg, two cloves of garlic and fresh thyme (instead of parsley), and it turned out fabulous--what a great dinner for a rainy day at home!

I made this for my ultra picky daughter-I mean PICKY-she LOVED it! I loved it as well but I added 2 huge cloves of garlic, and it was too much for my taste. This is a quick, simple, delicious and now regular (but not too regular because it can expand the waistline) recipe in my "kitchen arsenal" to get my kid to eat ;)

I thought this sauce was very good, however, I doubled the recipe and would not recommend doubling the amount of parmesan, it was almost too salty with all of the cheese in it. I added some marinara to it to make a sauce I love from my favorite local Italian joint and loved it aside from the saltiness!

This sauce was easy to throw together and had a great consistency!  I added plenty (!) of black pepper and didn't add put parsley into the sauce -  I just sprinkled it on top of the finished pasta dish.  Next time though, I will probably only add about 1 cup of cheese as it was a bit too cheesy...and that's rare for me to say, being a huge cheese fanatic lol. :)

This recipe is phenomenal!! I followed it exactly. I also mixed 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and a couple large boneless chicken breasts that I cubed and baked. The cream from the chicken soup and the alfredo sauce mixed perfectly!! Add some cheesy garlic bread and you have yourself one heck of a meal!!! Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!!!

This recipe is one of my kids very favorites.  I add grilled chicken and we actually have a dinner that everyone eats their dinner without complaints.  My daughter just told me that we need to have this EVERY week.  It's so quick and easy that we will be adding it to the rotation of kid friendly meals.

This is a great sauce as is. For personal preference, I cut down the cheese a bit after the first time I made it. I also doubled the garlic. Very good over veggie pasta - the pasta tastes nothing like vegetables but is less starchy. It takes some of the "heaviness" out of the dish.

The recipe should have stated not to use salted butter.  It was very salty.  It was also grainy. even though I slowly whisked the cream into the melted butter and slowly added the cheese while whisking.
Probably won't make again.  I liked the jar suce better.

This was my first try at making Alfredo from scratch and it was so easy! I didn't have fresh parsley so I left it out. And I also used 2 cloves of garlic vs 1. Will be making again & again!!

I don't particularly like this sauce the day I make it. It tastes too parmesan-y so when I do make this. I make it a day before the dinner. I like for the flavors to mellow down a bit and it tastes much better the following day. Overall, an easy and good recipe.

Very good and so easy.  Husband said it was the best he's had.  I doubled the recipe to have leftovers.  My husband made 2 portions for lunches and he never takes leftovers....

Everytime I make this dish I enjoy it a little bit more.  We have tweaked this sauce to our liking.  I use 1/2 &1/2 instead of heavy cream.  I add 2 1/2 cups of a parmesan and parmigiano reggiano mixture.  The extra cup of chese gives more flavor and seems to thicken the suace better.  We also add 2 cloves garlic instead of one, and salt and pepper.  FRESH parsley is a must!!  It really makes the dish.  Just buy a bunch at the store and chop it up with your kitchen scissors and toss it in at the end.  Happy eating.

This is a great recipe.
I've made it twice. The first time I followed the recipe and I found it to be a tad rich for my liking.
The second time, I chose to use 1 Cup of Parmesan and 1/2 cup of Gruyere to smooth it out. I also added a tad more creme. It came out pretty much to my liking. Not watery, but not thick. Being a fan of cajun seasoning, I decided to add some creole seasoning to it after I added cheese. This came out pretty good. Added sliced andouille sausage and chicken to the mix.

This is a wonderful base recipe! I doubled the batch, and it reheats very well the next day if you add a little milk. (Tastes better too, the flavors have a little time to meld.) I used a microplane for the cheese and turned off the heat before mixing it in, and it came out velvety smooth.

It was a little thick even though I used light cream. I think next time I'll try half milk and half cream, more garlic and a little white wine.

A very nice, basic recipe that will not fail as written.  If you chose to tweak it for your personal taste it is even better!  I used a mix of parmesan and parmigiano-reggiano plus extra garlic and it was wonderful.  We were especially pleased with the consistency.  Not to thick or too thin!  Perfect for the gluten free rice flour pasta I made to go with it.   I will make this often I'm sure because it is so much better than ready made and no more trouble.

This is our favourite alfredo sauce. The only change I make is that I leave out the parsley. It overpowers the garlic and parmesan in the sauce. I like to garnish with freshly ground black pepper. Definitely a keeper!

I doubled the recipe, omitting the parsley. I melted the butter, added the garlic, cream and parm. Stirring until hot and the cheese melted. A hit to the three girls I served it to. Added shrimp to hubby's. Yum.

This Alfredo Sauce recipe was SLAMMIN!!!  I made sure I used the guyere cheese- best choice!  I prepared everything just as the recipe called for...While having my hubby stir the alfedo sauce to ensure it wouldn't burn, even on the lowest setting (hehehe), I sauteed a pound of medium cooked shrimp and a can of Phillips Jumbo crabmeat with some olive oil, minced garlic and a teaspoo of Phillips Crab and Shrimp seasoning.  Then I combined the sauce with the sauteed crab and shrimp and added in a half bag of cooked ronzoni wheat egg-style noodles!!! Mmmmmmm- to die for!!- Oh and I added half a bag of frozen broccoli cuts too!!

this alfredo sauce was absolutely delicious, although I made a few modfications. First, I used two cloves of garlic, and I sauteed them in the butter, rather than add raw garlic to the sauce. I also grated fresh nutmeg and black pepper into the sauce. The texture was a bit grainy for my liking; I think next time I'll used a blend of parmesean and asagio and/or romano. 
All in all, I found the sauce delicious, and I'll definitely be keeping the recipe.

Despite using Tre Stella pre-grated Parmesan,dried Parsley,dried Chives and half and half this turned out "great" says hubby.  I did cut down on the Parmesan a little and still good.  Next time will try fresh Parmesan etc:O)Mixed this with some leftover chicken and placed on top of some homemade egg pasta noodles I had experimented with by freezing a week ago.  Dinner was done in a flash.

Nice to have a recipe that you can substitute this and that according to what is in the cupboard/fridge.

This is a wonderful recipe. I prefer to make my alfredo sauce rather than buy a store brand and this one is a winner. I do like to add a little finely chopped onion for some extra flavor. I just saute' it in the butter or olive oil before adding the cream

The only way to improve is a pinch of salt and fresh cracked black pepper! Delicious!

This is a yummy and easy recipe. I adjusted the ingredients in the recipe to one and a half times to feed my family of four but next time I would just go ahead and double it. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream and I whisked it the whole time it simmered, slowly adding in the fresh Parmesan.  For my stove medium low was not hot enough and so I simmered over medium.  I used two garlic cloves this time so maybe I will use three next time I make it if I double the recipe.  I also added fresh ground pepper and a couple of dashes of nutmeg.  I served it over fresh fettuccine (Buitoni) and it was yummy :-)

This was REALLY tasty! I added a splash of white wine for a little extra zing, and it made it a little runny, but the flavor was fantastic! I added sliced chicken and mushrooms, and it made for a fantastic Valentine's Dinner.

I just had this alfredo as written.  To my meal I added chicken breast cut into cubes and coated in hot sauce ( Frank's Red Hot) and some steamed broccolli.  Mix it all up with whole wheat pasta.  Look out taste buds!  Thanks for the easy delicious recipe Rebecca!

It was just ok. I didn't have heavy cream so substituted 3/4 cup whole milk and 1/3 melted butter per another site. I may try it again with heavy cream.

This was good. I used SALTED butter and it was NOT too salty. It was quick, easy and cheap. Along with the fettucine noodles, I served steamed broccoli which went great with the sauce. Husband, daughter and I enjoyed big plates of it, but I do not plan to make this again because it's not that healthy AND I realized I just don't love Alfredo sauce.

Amazing! Tried it as it the first time and have been tweaking it to my tastes ever since. It deserves five stars as it is, but I enjoy using a blend of 1/2 romano, 1/2 parmigiano reggiano and using a generous 1/4 cup of unsalted butter. I also cut down on the parlsey, and add a little basil and oregano. It pairs quite well with broccoli or asparagus and a nice glass of wine.

Really good.  I used the parmesan cheese, plus a pre shredded italian cheese blend. Didn't have fresh parsley, so I used the dried version. I also didn't have heavy cream.  So I used 3/4 cup of milk plus half a brick of cream cheese. It was yummy.  Waaaay better than the stuff you buy in a jar and better than some restaurants.

I only had about half the amount of cheese on hand, so it probably wasn't as tasty as it should have been, but with that being said. It was still very yummy!

I love this alfredo sauce.  I always throw a bit of pepper into in so it's not so blah looking and I never have fresh parsley on hand so the pepper adds another layer of flavor as well as a little bit to look at.  Also for the cheese, I made this with only having bags of shredded parm. and it took a lot loner to melt.  So the next time I made it, I used my can of grated parmesan cheese and it mixed right in and thickened up, now I just go off the basics of this recipe and experiment a little...  Yummy!

Deicious and very similar to how I make mine! I used half and half in place of the heavy cream because I had it to use up, and just added some dried parsley at the end because I didn't have fresh. Thanks for sharing. :)

We really enjoyed this recipe. Instead of using garlic cloves, we used garlic powder (1/4tsp). We also used only 1 cup parmesan cheese and then sprinkled a little on the top afterwards. Very fast meal. Fixed it in under 15 min.

This is the sauce that use for my Chicken Florentine and Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo.  I usually have to double the recipe because we like lots of creamy sauce, but it's got great flavor, and always gets great reviews!

Excellent as long as you use shredded Parmesan rather than grated as it makes it very salty. I am new to cooking and this was easy, quick, and looked like it was made in a restaurant! Also, I added chicken that I cooked on the skillet with Italian seasoning and garlic powder. Excellent!!!!

Added salt & pepper, a can of crab and chopped up cooked shrimp...yummy! Also used whipping cream instead of heavy cream. Great basic alfredo sauce.

This recipe was easy to follow and came out perfect. I added my own twist by upping the garlic to 3 cloves (pressed) and cooking the garlic in the butter before adding the cream. I also used 3 different cheeses- shredded Romano, shredded Asiago and shredded Parmesan...amazing!

I found this way too salty and I made the recipe to the T. I also made it three times adjusting the whisking and not whisking and it never really got creamy using Parmesan. I don't know if I'd make it again.....

This is a great alfredo sauce. First you must simmer this sauce, if you bring it to a boil it will separate. Second, increase the garlic to two cloves. And most important use your own fresh grated cheese. If you use the kind in the green can made for shaking on pasta, it will not melt right!    Also, I have to laugh at the ones who say, "I'm Italian and this isnt' the kind they serve in Italy". Alfredo is an AMERICAN dish, there is no Italian version. LOL There is a butter and cream sauce in Italy but it is NOT alfredo nor does it taste like a garlic, parmesan, cream sauce.

4 stars for taste!  DO NOT USE MILK, unless you want alfredo soup! Stir vigorously after each addition of parm., add it slowly, about a 1/4 cup at a time.  Try a pinch of nutmeg, most alfredo sauces call for it.  And definitely add pepper, white or black is fine!

I would have given it 5 stars had I used freshly grated Parmesan. It's true that grated does not melt well, and my sauce was thick and clumpy. Next time for sure I will use grated. Otherwise it was delicious!

I did not care for this recipe...there was so much parmesan the consistency was off and the flavour was just so intense it wasn't even edible..if you're going to try this recipe you're better off simply gnawing on a block of parmesan

I add bacon and fresh green onions to this dish, and the family loves it! Also, you can convert this recipe into a roasted red pepper sauce or a tomato alfredo by adding a jar of roasted red peppers puree (add jar into the blender, add while you add milk) or a couple table spoon of tomato paste.  Very good, very easy!! love this recipe!

This was wonderful.  However I substituted one large container of fat free Greek yogurt for the heavy cream, added more fresh garlic and little more butter and added about 1/2 cup of finely diced Portabello mushrooms to it.  I used the Kraft Parmesan cheese, but next time I'll get the fresh and grate it myself.  As smooth as it looked it was a bit grainy textured.  I also cooked it in my electric wok which worked brilliantly.  The woman whose husband almost wept would have literally wept at the taste of this stuff.  Excellent and I like the fact that I could substitute for the heavy cream -- I know it must be better tasting, but the HC has just way too much fat for me.  This was a really easy recipe to make for a dinner party and it was smashing~

I doubled the recipe as it is shown, and used a blend of Italian cheeses (the Mario Batali brand at Sam's Club) and this was PERFECT.  I'm always looking for the best alfredo dish at different restaurants I go to but I think I found it when I made this sauce.  My DH asked me to make it again the following night!  I added a bunch of salt and pepper to my own serving but that's just how I like it.

I have tried this with pecorino romano and another time with parmesan.  It is just too strong for me.  I will stick with the recipe using cream cheese.

Wonderfull sauce, however, homemade alfredo is never as good reheated. The sauce tends to seperate and become oily/greasy, so be sure to eat it all first time around!

Made this last night for spinach fettucine, using half and half instead of the cream.  Used grated parmesan and added some cold cooked shrimp.  My sauce came out grainy, but it could have been from the moisture in the shrimp - I should have heated them separately, put them on top of the fettucine and poured the alfredo sauce on.  Good taste though.

I really love this sauce, simple, true ingredients like it is meant to be, nothing strange and exotic to ruin it. Easy to make, creamy and rich. Too bad it is so high in fat content! Isn't all the best food though, geez

This sauce does work nicely by itself, but it's kind of bland and thin. I found that by adding some provolone cheese (grated or shredded), pepper, a pinch of salt, another half-clove of garlic, and a little bit of cajun spice really deepened the flavor. I also added a little flour to thicken the sauce.

I followed the recipe to a t except that i added 1 cup of parm instead 1 and 1/2 cups so i have no clue what i did wrong.but it was chunky and the parmesan was way to overpowering...nothing close to the creamy tasty fetticini alfredo i know...wont make this again

The first time i made this it was ok, but then the next time when i measured the cheese i packed it into the measuring cup and it was great! i also used garlic powder instead of crushed garlic.

Delicious!  Since the author suggested Gruyere as a substitute and I didn't have quite enough Parm/Romano cheese, I substituted 1/4 lb of Provolone, chopped up.  I had to use my home-dried basil instead of fresh, but it didn't suffer much for that.  I served it over tri-color pasta, with sauteed chicken strips and green beans.  My teen-age son loved it too and thinks it will be good with mushrooms as well. Very very rich, I told him it will be a special occasion dish.

Definitely needs just a little pepper, some salt, squeeze of some lemon and maybe some Italian spices (thyme, basil, oregano).  A little bland for me.

I loved the recipe, it was really easy to make and tasted great. I used less garlic powder and added some actual minced garlic clove for a slightly different taste. besides that I wouldn't make any kind of changes to it.

This was really good and made plenty for our needs (read: a little too much).  Used fresh garlic and dehydrated parsley.  Very flavorful in itself.

I made this the other night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I used dried parsley (put into the mix early to soften up) and added a small amount of salt (my butter is unsalted) and pepper.  Next time I will added another clove of garlic.  I served the sauce over penne pasta with some blackened shrimp.  My husband was thrilled and I was quite happy to have the meal on the table in 30 mins.

This is the basic template for Alfredo Sauce. While there are a million substitutes out there, the staples (butter, heavy cream, and parm cheese) should not be omitted. This is the kind of sauce that take multiple tries, not because it is difficult to make, but because we all like it different ways. I make my Alfredo thick and rich. I allow the cream to thicken before adding parmesan And romano cheese. Use fresh whenever available. The pre-grated kind will give you lumpy results most of the time. Also, season the finished sauce with salt and peper (white pepper, if you care about looks) to taste.

This is a great recipe!  I made this for the first time for a group of friends and they loved it!  I would suggest using the Gruyere cheese as well.  It was a bit difficult to get all the Parmesan cheese smoothly mixed in.  Even so, it was AMAZING!!

Oh my, this is heavenly.  I doubled it for my family and it was perfect.  I added a couple more cloves of garlic than the recipe says and it was so tasty.  I also thickened it a bit with a little flour.  It was quite runny and I didn't want to cook it any longer because it was starting to curdle a bit.

I made this last night and thought it was absolutely fabulous! I used a full cup of freshly shredded Parmesan and half a cup of the Kraft spaghetti Parmesan. I also added a bit of onion powder. My family loved it and I will definitely be making it again!

WHAT! One of the best alfredo sauces we've ever had. I enjoy dining out at nice resturants and feel this recipe is up there with one of them. My husband for 20+ years never cooks & for Valentine's dinner I sat down, & walked him through it.  Very simple & creamy.  We slightly changed the recipe. He used 2 cloves of garlic & evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.  Love it!  Rochelle & Gerald

I needed an emergency alfredo sauce to save another not so great dish, and thought this was great. It was super easy, and the result was nice. I used skim milk + cornstarch instead of cream, as well as light butter. I also used store brand grated parm instead of fresh and it did the trick. Thanks.

I will never order it in a restaurant again.  That's how I know I have found a great recipe.  Make sure you buy a good 'triangle' of Parmesan cheese and grate it fresh so it melts smoothly.  I also use half and half instead of heavy cream to make it slightly less fattening (but really--butter, cheese, cream?  It's fattening no matter what!).  Thank you so much for the great recipe!  We serve it with blackened chicken on top.

This recipe is so easy and fast to make!  Alfredo is my favorite sauce, though I had never made it at home before.  My husband doesn't usually like it.  He liked this flavorful recipe so much that we made it two nights in a row!!  I used fat free half-and-half and thickened it with a tablespoon of flour.  YUMMY!!

This is very good and very simple! I found that the sauce got very thick after adding only 1/2 cup of cheese so I left it as it was without adding more. Everyone likes it!

Simple and delicious.  I didn't have enough parmesan so I used some asiago to finish out the rest and it was quite tasty!  I threw in a bag of fresh spinach and let it wilt in the sauce and served over linguine.  Some diced tomato or mushrooms would be a nice addition as well.

This recipe is perfect.  My son was so impressed with it, he said it tasted better than olive garden, and that kid loves olive garden!  I didn't use fresh garlic, all I had on hand was dried minced garlic and it still tasted wonderful.  I highly recommend this one!

I served this at our Christmas dinner and it was a hit. Very creamy and full of flavor! I had prepared it the day before and refrigerated it until our meal time. It reheated very well with a little whisking as it wanted to seperate initially.

I have made this more times than I can count now. I have never made it with Gruyere cheese, but parmesan works well and blends nicely if you add small amounts at a time. I also like it with romano.

Not fool proof... Blasé and came out with a weird texture. I will stick to my original Alfredo recipe.

The Parmesan didn't melt well and it was very lumpy and unappetizing. I think I prefer premade, jarred alfredo sauce to this. I have made alfredo sauce in the past that turned out beautifully so I don't think the results were my fault, though they could have been. Either way, I won't be making this again and will go back to another recipe.

If you use shaved Parmesan instead of grated it melts better and you end up with a smooth and creamy sauce....but this is a great quick-easy sauce

Simply said....Great!  I did use garlic powder (about 2 tsp.), canned Parmesan and dried parsley and it was great.  Can only imagine what it would taste like with fresh ingredients!

This sauce was really good and very rich! I added spinach to the sauce while it was still in the pan heating, than tossed it with Penne and Grape Tomatoes and it was fabulous! My husband is a great cook, and he was very impressed with this pasta dish! It's even great cold the next day!

I make this recipe exactly as written, and it is perfect every time. I do recommend doubling the sauce if this is your only entree. The "4" servings are usually barely enough for me and hubby. Thank you for the recipe! :)

This sauce was pretty good. I added more garlic. I also added black pepper. The 1 1/2 cups of cheese was a little much, so the 2nd time I made it I added a little over a half of a cup and just kept adding it in until I got the consistency I wanted.

I used standard cream instead of the heavy, omitted the parsley, and used a blend of shredded cheeses. After adding in the cheese and garlic, I added in some roughly chopped spinach that I sautéed with garlic and butter. Spooned over sautéed chicken breast fillets and fettucini. Everyone LOVED it. Excellent recipe! It's now my go-to alfredo recipe.

For some reason, I thought the recipe called for one whole garlic crushed. Even with all the extra garlic, it was still great and my kids devoured it. Next time, I will be sure to use only one clove though! ;-)

I was not a huge fan of this.  I used freshly grated Parmiagiano Reggiano, and maybe this is one of the few recipes where the pre-grated bagged cheese would actually taste better. I think I prefer the flavor of the recipes with a cream cheese base (i.e. "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" from this site).

I tried this recipe recently and it came out to be VERY cheesy...I guess that is because I added alot of cheese and I used twice the amount of heavy cream.  I added Mozzarella, Provolone and Romono in addition to the Parmesan that the recipe called for.  I also added spinach and sauteed mushrooms. It came out great. I used to buy the Chicken Spinach Alfredo frozen bags dinner by Bertolli and this sauce and meal came out to taste much much better than that.  And they were restaurant quality.

This is amazing and so simple.  I always buy a block of parmesan cheese and grate it myself and have absolutly no problem with it melting (in the past I have had problems w/ the pre-shredded cheese from a bag, & kraft grated cheese doesnt work at all).  I usually add broccoli and chicken for a complete meal.  So so yummy... Ill have to try it with milk with flour or cornstarch next time for a healthier option.

Tasted great, but the Parmesan cheese doesn't melt very well, next time I'll try the Gruyere cheese, if I can find it here in Sweden.

This is a good basic recipe.  However, I built off of this and I have added rotisserie chicken or chicken sautéed with the garlic and a touch of olive oil.  I used a touch more garlic and heavy cream-which can be split with half and half to reduce the calories.  I also added sautéed portabella mushrooms and fresh thyme.

By far THE BEST alfredo sauce recipe I've made.  Add 1/8c chopped shallot and saute with the melted butter for 4-5 min then add fresh cracked pepper at the very end. Even better!  YUM!!

This recipe is amazing! Alfrado sauce is a simple sauce and is to be mild in flavor. This recipe hit it on the nose! I first did this recipe with salted butter and itialian seasoning, I did not have fresh parsley. It was good but the second try was perfect fresh parsley and unsalted butter was a definate. Also with the chees I mixedd it up abit and used an itialian 6 cheese mix and parmasan. Enjoy it is a fabulous recipe!

I've attempted alfredo sauce in the past and has never turned out well.  This was easy and the flavor was fantastic.  I doubled the recipe but was about 3/4c shy for the cream so I added 1% and about 2 tbls of flour.  Thickness was perfect!

The flavor of the sauce was good, but I did the idiot thing of adding the cheese at too high of heat.  It clumped together.  My 11 year old ate it anyway. Done correctly, it is probably a great sauce.

This was very easy to make and my family liked it.  My only problem with it was it got very thick and lost some of it's creaminess.  But the taste was very good.  Next time I will add some chicken or shrimp.  Flaked salmon might also be good.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making it again.

Outstanding!!!  I didn't have heavy cream so I used milk instead and a bit of cornstarch to thicken it.  Probably didn't need it since it thickened a lot overnight.  Taastes even better the next day! Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought the taste was excellent.  I used dried parsley flakes and minced garlic.  It coated the noodles very nicely.

This is a great basic recipe that I will use often. My family loved it. I was low on parmesan, so I used 1 cup parmesan and 1 cup mozzarella. I also used dried parsley, fresh would add more flavor, but it was all I had.

This was great.  I used more cream because mine separated so remember to whisk often.  I added a bit of nutmeg.

Very good just as is.  The only thing I added was a dash of salt and pepper.  The most important part to getting this recipe right is to not let the cheese clump up; add it little by little while whisking the whole time.

This was wonderful! It is simple and easy and you can put your own spin on it. Instead of parsley you could add crushed peppercorn and do like a Steak au Poivre, with fettuccine or something. Anyway we loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out so bland it was practically tasteless.

Perhaps next time I'll add bacon or other more flavorful toppings and see how it goes.

This tasted amazing!
I did do some minor changes though.  I added the garlic to the butter in the pan as I was melting it and I added 1 tablespoon of cream cheese to it and substracted some of the parmesan cheese.  The cream cheese made it taste a lot creamier.

I prefer a lot more seasonings in my cooking but this was a great recipe to jump off of. The cheese and cream combo was great - you just have to wisk it really well as it cooks to get a creamy consistency. I seasoned the sauce with a pinch of salt, white pepper and garlic powder. I added sauteed chicken that I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, basil and oregano. I also added some diced tomatoes and served it over fresh fettucini. Pretty good!

Wonderful recipe! So simple and quick to make! Only thing I change is to use mixed cheese of Asiago/Parmesan cheeses.

Make this all the time! YUMMY!

This is the best Alfredo Sauce recipe I have ever tried and it is so easy!  My kids, the pickiest eaters in the world, just love it!.  Over the next few days after making it, we even ate the leftovers by zapping it in the micro over and it was still delicous.   I wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you for sharing.

Great and east recipe! I love making this sauce over chicken, broccoli, and ziti. 
I cut and cook the chicken and broccoli into bite size pieces, then add it to the cooked ziti and pour the alfedo sauce over eveything. Makes a great dish! The alfredo sauce sticks to the ziti pasta really well. I also add 4 cloves of garlic instead of one. And be sure to used shredded parmesan as other reviewers have suggest, It really does melt alot nicer. Be sure to add a handful of parmesan at a time as you wisk (mix) the sauce, the sauce will be alot smoother. :)

I made this recipe twice tonight, and both times was a failure.  The first time it came out looking like alfredo sauce, but the texture was not sauce like.  I don't want to say what it looked and felt like..it wasn't good.  The second time, I made it with 2% because I thought maybe the heavy whipping cream was the culprit. This time the cheese wouldn't even melt.

I MADE THIS FOR LUNCH TODAY. I USED MILK IN PLACE OF THE CREAM, AND GARLIC POWDER. AND A WHOLE CUP OF PARM CHEESE. I MADE A HALF RECIPE. IT WAS A LITTLE THIN, BUT THAT WAS PROBALLY FROM THE MILK. BUT IT STILL TASTED VERY GOOD.

Wow, very, very nice recipe.  I used half & half and only about one cup of grated cheese, mostly romano with the parmesan.  (Changes were just due to what was in the house.)  I think the key was whisking the entire time and definitely simmering the butter/cream mixture for the full 5 minutes.  The consistency was perfect.  The only change I would consider is possibly a pinch of white pepper.  We served it over fresh pasta and it was absolutely maarvelous.  A great flavor blend that was not overpowering.

So unbelievably good. Rich and creamy and incredibly decadent. I didn't have any parsley so I added a TBSP of pesto. Way better than store bought and very easy to make.

I have made this sauce several times, with no problems, and nothing but rave reviews.  For me, it has always turned out creamy, with a great flavor. Alfredo sauce is not supposed to be a "strong" sauce. I can't help but wonder if some of the "experts" who made it, used the shaker jars of Parmesan Cheese, instead of the good stuff.

I made this sauce last night to go with a parmesan tilapia dish I was making. I absolutely LOVED everything about this sauce; it was easy, quick, and tasty. I will definitely be keeping this recipe in my favorites. The only change I made was using garlic powder in place of fresh garlic, as I didnt have any fresh garlic on hand this time.

Awesome alfredo recipe!  Made just as shown except used half fat free half and half.  To make my own, added some smoked salmon, red pepper and home grown tomatoes. Served over a fresh lemon spinach pasta noodle.  Great!  4/16/09 Made this recipe again and was just as delighted. Again, used the fat free half and half.  Served over a bed of fettucini, and topped with a rolled italian flank steak from the butcher (rolled with parmeson and provel). Accompanied by fresh steamed asparagus.  Yum.

This was delicious over sweet potato gnocchi.  It separates and hardens when it cools, but just zap it in the microwave and stir and it turns out just fine!  Leftovers were good too!

This recipe is spectacular!  We used this as the base for our Chicken Alfredo and our family thought it was the best they have ever had, hands down.  We tried 1/2 Parmesan and 1/2 Reggiano it and was excellent!

WOW! Very simple, very impressive! This sauce is so similar to Olive Garden's! I could not find freshly GRATED Parmesan cheese in the cheese section of HEB ( a popular grocery chain in Texas). I finally found 6 oz. tubs of Digiorno brand grated Parmesan in the Deli area. I made a double batch and it was more than enough to coat about 20 oz. of bowtie pasta. I used unsalted butter as recommended and I threw in some precooked cocktail shrimp (from the frozen seafood section) that I thawed out under running water. The sauce was brought to a gradual simmer and it began to thicken after 5 min. I was afraid to let it go longer for fear of the sauce breaking. Maybe I should have cooked it a little longer because I could feel the lil granules of cheese. Other than that, THIS ONE STAYS IN MY RECIPE BOX!

I did not really crush the garlic well so there were still bits of garlic in the sauce but other than this, it was great!  I left out the parsley and added some black pepper and it turned out really good.  It is really simple and tastes delicious!

This alfredo sauce was totally yummy and super easy to make.  I sauteed the garlic in the butter before hand instead of adding it later. That's the only change I made.  I will use this recipe regularly.

Great alfredo sauce and so quick and easy to make. I have used 1% milk instead of cream and the parmesan in the green can because that is what I had in my refrigerator, and it still tastes really good! Great, versatile recipe.

Wonderful recipe. Taste was perfect. I changed a couple of things: Used regular whipping cream, 1 cup each aged Gruyere and Parmesan (grated at home) and 2 large cloves of garlic. I let everyone garnish their dish with the parsley and additional cheese. Yum!!

Awesome, Rebecca! And fast. I added flour to thicken and used half & half instead of heavy cream (melt butter, slightly brown garlic, add 2 Tbsp flour, add half & half). My friends loved it... many thanks!

I also whisked the butter and cream rather than stir because it separates. I love cheese so I put 2 cups of cheese inspead of 1.5. Other than that this sauce was fantastic--rich and oh so creamy

This recipe was amazing! I made this for dinner for my dad, so i only made one serving. Also i didn't have any Parmesan cheese so i used this garlic cheese i had so didn't add any garlic to the sauce. I didn't know if the cheese would work, since it wasn't Parmesan, but it did and it was great. Also i always add nutmeg to my cream sauces, which made this sauce wonderful.

quite good...i simmered the cream with the garlic and then strained it out before adding the cheese. after the cheese melted the sauce was quite stringy, (that whole melted cheese thing) so i added about 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water which made it fluid enough to coat the pasta. i left out the parsley, but i think next time i'll add chopped basil.

Loved this!! The easiness along with the taste is unbeatable! I did omit the parsley, because I thought the kids would like it better, and used 1/2 & 1/2 because that's what I had. Next time I will use 1 C  of parm. to see if I like a little less cheese flavor....... would recommend to anyone!!!

The sauce is delicious, but the amount of parsley was a little too much for us, almost made it taste grassy. We add less parsley and just love this. Fresh black pepper is a must!

Have made a few alfredo recipes from this site and this one was by FAR the best! I have made it twice now.  First time as written, the second time I made a few changes, mainly added some spices such as basil and more garlic and onion which I left in the finished sauce, didn't bother straining them out. I also added two tbsp of Scotch and one tbsp of white wine and used fat free half and half. I have to say WOW, those really made the sauce AMAZING. My FI literally licked his plate clean when I made it the second time!

I feel kinda bad for reviewing this, because I did change it some, but I wanted other readers to see the changes.

I substituted fat free half and half (with a touch of corn starch) in place of the heavy cream...anyone notice the fat conent?  Replace with half and half and you'll be happy you did.

I also increased the garlic to about 6 cloves of very finely minced garlic.  Alfredo sauce needs more then 1 clove.

I also added about a teaspoon or so of freshly ground black pepper.  Black pepper is essential to a great alfredo sauce.

Also, I used hald parmesan and half romano cheeses, just as a preference.  Always make sure you buy a wedge and grate it yourself.  The stuff in the jar and in bags will not melt properly and you will end up with a clumpy wierd tasting sauce.

Excellent sauce. My DH is pretty picky when it comes to alfredo sauce, and I had not found one that he liked. He told me I had outdone myself with this one. I used half and half to try to lighten it a bit. I also used an italian 3 cheese blend. You have to stir and stir; it will melt!  I was concerned at first because it seemed thin. However, I pured it over the pasta and let it sit for just a couple of minutes before serving.  It was perfect! Thanks for a great sauce. We can't wait to try it on chicken.

I found this sauce to be too runny, i needed to add flour and water mixture to thicken it up a bit. That being said, it had great taste, I also added an extra garlic clove. I will make again, though cut back on the cream. thanks.

Very very good, and easy to make! I added some oregano, basil, and fresh ground black pepper to mine for some extra flavor. Freshly grated Parmesan is the way to go for this recipe!  Giving it 4 stars because it solidifies in the fridge...not good as a leftover.

AWESOME!! I added 1 tsp oregano and a few shakes of black pepper. I've made a few times and if you use "kraft" parmesan it will be "grainy". The trick is fresh grated parmesan cheese! Thanks it's quick and delicious!!

Very easy to make. Being a garlic lover I also added an extra glove to the sauce, but found it totally overwhelmed everything. Next time I'll also cut down on the cheese, as it made things a little too thick (but remedied with a splash of milk)

I added a couple of extra cloves of garlic and a tad more cheese, so my sauce was slightly thicker. If your sauce does get too thick, add a splash of milk to it. Loved the stronger garlic fragrance with the extra cloves.

This recipe is great- but a little too much cheese for my taste. It's still a keeper! I grated the cheese myself and had no issues with it melting. It was smooth and lovely.

You never realize just how unhealthy alfredo sauce is until you make it...but it is sooo good! I used whipping cream (had some onhand), and added pepper and chunky smoked salmon at the end and served it over fresh linguine. Absolutely loved it!

Tasted really good but it was a little gritty like some of the others reviews said.  It might have been the type of cheese i used though, parmesan and asiago.  I will try it again with only parmesan and see if i get that same texture

Great recipe!!! Tried it with the Le Gruyere. I admit it's a little stronger than parmesan, but excellent choice still. I actually made it twice in one week. Trying asiago next! I love this stuff!!!!

I'm only giving it 4 because I added to this.  I used 3 cloves garlic (minced), 1/2 cup 2% milk, 2 tsp white sugar, 1 tsp oregano, and 1/4 cup Prego Fresh Mushroom sauce (in the glass jar).  It balanced out the flavor and turned it into an alfredo marinara sauce which was wonderful over cheese tortelini.

Very delicious alfredo sauce. I didnt have a clove of garlic so I just sprinkled some garlic powder in with the butter as it was melting. Soooo good I could eat it with a spoon. This goes perfect with chicken or pork chops if you're watching carbohydrates.

The flavor was really good, but I think I may have cooked it too long. It looked creamy about 3/4 of the way through adding the cheese, but I kept cooking and addings, so it came out grainy. Served over fettucini with grilled chicken--super good!

This was absolutely wonderful!  I made exactly as written, except I used a combination of fresh Parmesan, Romano, and Asagio cheese. (It came in a container at the grocery store already combined).  The cheese melted nicely with a wisk.  This was every bit as good as Olive Gardens!  I added chicken from A Good Garlic Chicken.  It was great!  Thanks for making me feel like a gourmet cook!

I made this sauce last night. I cooked 1/2lb of chicken with 1/2lb of smoked sausage, threw 2c of steamed broccoli and tossed it all with mozzarella and herb stuffed tortellini. I did use margarine and half n half to cut back on fat and calories and it still turned out great!!

My family wasn't crazy about this one.  They didn't like the flavor of the parmesan, so that could have been the problem.  I bought the refrigerated plastic containter of grated cheese you find next to the gourmet cheeses.  I would have probably had better results by grating a higher quality brick of cheese myself and it would have melted better, also.

Wonderful!  I used Gruyere instead of Parmesan, but other than that I followed recipe exactly.  My husband and I ate all of it; there wasn't a drop left.  If it wasn't so fattening I would make it once a week.

I have tried this recipe twice and both times the cheese was lumpy.  I have used high quality parmesan and an Italian mixture, and the results were the same.  Taste is good, but texture is an issue with the lumpy cheese.

The best!!  Just like Olive Garden...I don't buy it in a jar anymore.  Sometimes I do have problems with it being too thin.  Can't figure out where I go wrong, but it is still worth it.

It's a simple and quick recipe to make. Try it! But make sure you use fresh cheese, not the powdry parmesan cheese! You might not need as much cheese as is quoted in the recipe either.

This is a very good recipe.  I will use it over and over again.  I did change things by doubling the recipe and adding garlic salt, and instead of double cream, I did 1.5 c. cream and .5 c. of milk.  I didn't have any problems with clumping, and I didn't add my cheese slowly.  Luck?  haha!  EXCELLENT recipe with additions.  I added steamed broccoli, too.  YUM!

This recipe is so amazing and quick. I didn't need to add any of the other things that other reviewers suggested. Parmesan cheese is very tasty. It didn't need salt or anything. I can’t wait to make this for my sister when she comes home!!  I did make the mistake of adding a little bit too much cheese after making the recipe, which made it a little salty. I’ll follow the directions next time. I grated fresh parmesan cheese and added it sparingly as I stirred the milk and butter. It melted with no problems.

I made this recipe twice because I thought I did something wrong the first time.  Well, I got the same results the second time.  I couldn't get the cheese to melt completely so it was gritty.  Even without the grit, I've tasted better sauce in a jar.

This is very good but, considering the cost of the cheese and cream, it's not worth it to make....just buy a jar of the good Alfredo sauce at your grocery store. I hate to say it but this is not one of those sauces that you need to make from scratch.

I'm sorry, Rebecca

The recipe seemed to have so much promise...It seemed to have such simple, tasty ingredients...I even went whole hog and got *real* ingredients (cheese, did not skimp on the cream, etc) but it seemed to lack something.  I did some reasearch on the site and found that nutmeg is a staple in the sauce.  Being allergic to nutmeg, I used a dash of allspice and the sauce improved tenfold. It was very tasty...but the consistancy...It might have been the real parmesean, but it was elastic-y.  I don't know how to solve that problem.  My kids took one look and wouldn't try it (they have had alfredo before).  I'm sorry for the bad review, but I am going to be looking for a new recipe.

This is the easiest and best alfredo recipe I have ever made.  I use freshly shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated and I use approximately 2 cups instead of the 1 1/2 that the recipe calls for.  I've found that if you don't use at least 2 cups the sauce is somewhat thin rather than a thick and cheesey. I add the cheese gradually because if you add it all at once it becomes lumpy like some of the other reviews have stated.  Also, you must whisk the entire time you are adding the cheese, and do it quickly.  Trust me, this recipe is to die for.  All of my friends and family now use this for their sauce as well.

Yum!!! This is SO good! It's 10 times better than anything any restaraunt could ever make... I served it over chicken on a bed of noodles and found that it tastes way better with just noodles. The parmesan cheese looked like it was never going to melt at first, but just keep stirring; it does eventually :)YUM! Make this recipie!!!

Great recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated just added oregano.  The key to making the sauce smooth is gradually adding the parmesan cheese if you use the can stuff is adding it slowly in stages it melts better that way! Fantastic

If you cut down on the butter, the recipe is absolutely delicious.  We all enjoyed it very much.

Very easy. I probably would have given this four stars, but my family loves it so I gave it five. I used fresh Parmesan cheese and although it doesn't melt well, it still tastes great and the texture doesn't seem to bother anyone here.  I did add extra garlic.

This tastes really delicious, but the texture sucks. Though I have made it several times, it is always grainy. I even tried putting it in a blender once! I cannot find gruyere cheese anywhere, so I have not tried that. The recipe also lacks nutmeg - a very important alfredo ingredient, which I added. Also put a bit more garlic and seasoned it a bit. Left out the parsley, I don't care for it in alfredo. This tastes great with shrimp & pasta, but the texture kinda kills it for me... I may try with a different cheese sometime. Still, i'd like to know the resturaunt's secrets for smooth alfredo... I think I will try another recipe next time!

Ok to be fair I didn't make the recipe exactly how it says to. I used freshly shredded parmesan. I think it would be better with the grated. It would melt better. It was ok but the parmesan was too overwhelming. We love Alfredo and this is my first try making it so it could be I'm just clueless.

Very good, very easy to prepare.  Be prepared - VERY cheesy! Original recipe yield, if for 4, would be very small servings. I served 3 and it was a little short. Will probably do half again more next time.

Delicious Alfredo sauce!!  It was a little thin - I'll probably add flour to the butter next time to thicken it up.  I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 Gruyere & 1/2 Parmesan, put in some whole mushrooms and also added a few drops of lemon juice.  I've been trying to recreate a recipe from an Italian restaurant and this came close!!!

Well, i actually used this as a base recipe & i ended up tweaking it.  I doubled the recipe & added 2-3oz.cream cheese, salt,and pepper. Added garlic powder instead of crushed & omitted the parsley, cuz i didn't have any.  Came out superb!!!...just not good for reheating!

This was a good sauce (not the best, but good).  It was a little grainy at first, but with additional heat and stirring, it became smoother.  Definitely a keeper.

This was EXCELLENT!!!  Equal to or better than Olive Garden Restaurant!!!  We won't need to go out for alfredo ever again!  I cut and cooked up some chicken breast, chopped some brocolli and mixed it all together with some bow-tie noodles. SUPERB!!!!!!  I'll be making this over and over again!  Husband loved it!

This is the closest recipe I have found to my favorite 'restaurant chain' alfredo sauce!!  I leave out the parsley and add a few sprinkles of a dry Parmesan/Romano blend I got at the grocery store.  I just sprinkle it on right before serving.  Rich but DELICIOUS with breadsticks and pasta!! We make this at least once a month, sometimes more!  YUMMY :)

I use this recipe all the time and people LOVE it. I usually use Gruyere but sometimes it is so expensive that I use Parm. (Costco has great prices on hard cheese FYI.) I also have used chopped fresh cilantro and a little crushed black pepper and loved it that way too.  Excellent and never grainy for me, although it doesn't reheat very well but you probably won't have much leftover!

Good flavor, but very gritty.  The sauce appeared very smooth, and did not separate, but when we tasted it we found out the parmesan cheese had not fully melted.  Next time I'll try Gruyere cheese, and also cut the amount of cheese down -- 1-1/2 cups was a bit overpowering.

This recipe is fabulous as a base for a great pasta dish. When the cheese is almost completely melted, I add chopped green onions and julienne cut sun-dried tomatoes (I've used both the ones packed in oil and just the dry ones and they both work fine). Separately, I cook diced chicken breast with white wine and garlic. Then I mix chicken and sauce together with some penne pasta and it tastes sooo good. I once tripled the recipe when I was visiting family to serve about 10 people, and they ALL loved it.

This is tops!  However, I would recommend adding another garlic clove and definately using unsalted butter.  A pinch of dried parsley works fine.  I've never had Olive Garden's sauce, but I have had Red Lobster's crab alfredo sauce (which I adore).  I added one can of lump crab meat at the end and it was a dead ringer for it.  So easy!  You won't need another alfredo recipe again!

This recipe is excellant. I'm a newbie cooker, and I must say I was knocked off my feet by how good this was. I used the sauce to make a seafood alfredo, which consisted of the sauce plus crabmeat, squid, clams, and oysters, and the taste was beyond belief. I can now add an authentic alfredo recipe to my lists of things I make well. :)

This is an awesome recipe. Very easy and incredibly tasty for so little work. Its so good in fact that I now use it as a basis for Carbonara and other white Italian sauces. 10 stars

This was a terrific sauce. We had to add some extra cheese to get it the consistancy we like, but overall great! My husband got the leftovers out for BREAKFAST the next day!!!

This was a great and easy-to-do recipe.  Thank you.  I will make this again, but probably use a little less parmesan so the sauce will be a little thinner.

Excellent!! I used fresh Parmersan- makes all the differece!! I also used 1 cup Parmesan and 1/2cup Romano (fresh as well). I love Romano, so I loved the sauce. My husband isn't as fond of Romano and recommended that I use only 1/4 cup of it next time. But I absolutely loved it!!!

Although this was very good, I had a hard time getting it to thicken, I used fresh grated Romano and Locatelli cheeses and I even doubled the heavy cream and it was still pretty thin so I addres about half a cup cream cheese. After I added the chicken and pasta it was nice and thick it within a few minutes it turned very sticky and pasty, dont know what happened, I am going to mess with this recipe a little more to get it perfect because the flavors are quite good. Try it but you will prob have to make a few alterations

Fantastic!  Very easy (and quick)!  Fresh parmesan makes all the difference.  I added some sauteed shrimp, clams and scallops.  You could do a variety of things with this sauce.  Thanks for posting it.

This is my go-to pasta sauce. My family loves it. We usually omit the parsley — it’s not really needed. And I’ve occasionally been out of heavy cream and used milk instead. Turned out okay anyway.

A very good sauce. Was fairly easy to make. I cut the amount of parm cheese down a bit. Found it "too cheesy" with whole amount of parm. Would make it again. Was really good on noodles with vegetables and chicken/shrimp mixes in.

Very easy too prepare. tastes great! Altough I used 1/2 cup of butter instead, and also sauted chicken in an olive, for an added bonus.

This was wonderful.  I sauteed a few shrimp and put the sauce on it.  This would be great for company because it is so easy.  julee

This was my first attempt at alfredo sauce.  I decided to oven roast the garlic first and add both parmesan and an italian blend of cheeses.  The taste was amazing.  However, I had a hard time getting the sauce to thicken.  I just mixed some flour and water together and that did the trick.  I used the sauce in combination with a chicken and shrimp saute recipe that I got from the McCormick web site.  The recipe was called Chesapeak Bay Chicken and Shrimp with Penne Pasta.  I just replaced the cream with the alfredo sauce.  Thanks again, it was great

My first try at making alfredo sauce was a disaster, so I was reluctant to try another. However, since this recipe recieved such great reviews from other users and because the ingredients did not call for a whole lot of expensive spices and was seemingly easy to prepare, I tried it and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! Not to mention, my boyfriend LOVED it also!! Thank you so much, Rebecca!

Was very good.  You need to melt the cheese very slowly or the sauce comes out grainy.

Yes, we will make again. Here are our variations - 13oz shredded Parmesan, 24oz of heavy whipping cream, 1.5-2 tsp minced garlic (from a jar), 1 tsp salt. We did have to turn up the heat to med-high to melt the cheese.  Very tasty! Our sauce was not thick, probably due to the amount of cream we added.

Absolutely love this recipe! I had to double the ingredients but I added Krafts mixture of shredded Mozzarella and Parmesan to the mix with a little milk. Was originally looking for Krafts shredded Parmesan but either way it turned out amazing. Thick, Rich, and Creamy!

I tried to make this recipe for dinner and it was a FAIL. I ended up with a butter and cream mixture that had a lump of cheese on the bottom. I did substitute cream with whole milk, but the milk didn’t even seem to be the problem. So I do not recommend using the parmesan cheese (that was the kind of cheese listed in the recipe).

I used salted butter and doubled the recipe. I thought there was no way this could have a lot of flavor, but boy was I wrong! My husband only orders chicken alfredo from Olive Garden and said "why are we spending $12 on this?"  Can't recommend this recipe enough.

This is not good. I wonder if this recipe was intended for pretend parmesan (eg. the stuff you buy on the shelf by the pasta). I used real, freshly grated, aged parmesan and that's all you could taste-- don't get me wrong, I love parmesan, but that's all that the flavour was.

To try and fix it, I added more garlic, the juice from half a lemon, as well as the zest from a whole lemon, a few good pinches of pepper, extra fresh parsley, and I let it reduce for a good 30 minutes. It wasn't bad after I did all of that, but this recipe is not good if you don't tweak, and even then, it was by no means a great alfredo.

Loved it! Only thing I might change, would be to use different cheese, had a hard time getting the Parmesan to melt. Family loved it, will definitely make and stop using the jar sauce

Was great! I doubled the recipe, but still used the original amount of parsley. It was slightly salty but I’m a wuss about salt, my dude thought it was perfect! I used shaved parm from the deli. Heat the sauce slow and whisk whisk whisk. I found it better to pour the sauce directly into the pan with the entire box of cooked boneless and stir it up, instead of adding it on the plate. We added sautéed mushrooms.

You'll never buy premade again!
I've tried many different kinds of cheese with this recipe; bottom line, the parm gives it the tangy, rich flavor we're accustomed to so don't leave it out!

So I was going to make it just like the recipe but I changed things up a bit. I used a little less than a 1/4 cup of butter, no cream just 1% milk. I added a little more than a cup of the milk, maybe like 1/4 more. I used a pre-shredded Parmesan mix that had Asiago in it and added some basil and a dash of nutmeg too. Lastly because the milk made it runny I made a roux of 1/4 cup milk and heaping tablespoon of flour which I whisked in when it was lightly boiling. My kids just loved it.

This is a simple and fantastic Alfredo sauce! I’ve been looking for a great Alfredo sauce recipe since going gluten free (due to celiac) and now I can’t get it at a restaurant locally. I use shredded Parmesan and a little bit of dried parsley instead of fresh. My husband says it’s “restaurant quality!” and this is now his new favorite dish. I finally get to enjoy Alfredo again! I pair it with steamed broccoli, pan-seared chicken breast that is dredged in gluten free flour and Italian seasoning, and barilla gluten free linguine.

I made an extra 1/2 cup and added 1 cooked, cut up boneless chicken breast, 1c. Broccoli florets, and 1 small can sliced mushrooms.  I also did 1/2 whole milk, 1/2 heavy cream.  The sauce did taste salty as one said but was balanced out with added chicken and broccoli.  I also used Penne pasta instead of fettuccini.

Terrific. The sauce was a little too runny but luckily I had extra parmeasan and added more to get the correct consistency. Will definitely make this again!

I made this for dinner tonight, but as always when I make a recipe I added my own little spin to it. I added canned chicken, some leftover broccoli, and I ended up tripling the recipe since I was feeding 7 and always love leftovers!

Yikes! The sauce turned out ok tasting, but so so grainy, and it separated when reheating. I'd try this again with an emulsifier...

This is not Alfredo sauce. This was horrible! You would be better off to dump a can of grated Parmesan cheese on your dish.  Really bad.

Great flavor! Fast and easy. I added extra garlic. I did use shaved parmesan from an airtight container and it melted fine, but some stuck to the pan. I might have had the heat too high. I will make this again!

I make this at least once monthly and it always turns out great. It's super easy and always a hit. I do vary the seasonings (sometimes just using black pepper and a dash of nutmeg, other times adding a little Italian seasoning, which includes marjoram, parsley and basil).

I will say this recipe can be trial-and-error, as it relates to the type of cheese used. I've had instances where it comes out too salty or too thick and the only thing I changed was the cheese. What I find works best for me is the fresh, shredded grocery store parmesan (only, not mixed with other cheeses).  I get consistent, delicious results with that kind.

I add the Parmesan cheese very slowly, whisking like crazy, and it clumped when put on the penne. I think it would be better to whisk it into the cream as it is heating up.

This alfredo recipe is a family favorite. I have made this several times by now and have tweaked it a bit to fit my personal cooking style and taste. One change I made was reducing the amount of butter from 1/4 a cup to 2 tbs.  And I add a tsp or two of freshly ground black pepper and a couple pinches of salt. Overall, this is an easy recipe to make and hard recipe to mess up! I highly recommend giving this one a try.

I made this today and added the garlic after the butter melted so that is would have more flavor. And then I added the Italian cheese blend as well as parmesan cheese and it makes it so good!

I made it just as described. Actually this is my second time making it. I precook chicken breasts, shred them, and throw some cooked pieces over the top of the noodles before putting this sauce on. It's one of my fiancee and my favorite dinners. So easy and delicious, but so elegant. I substituted 1 tbsp. of minced garlic, and half & half with a tbsp of milk (because it's what I had in the house on hand), and bottled parsely flakes,  and I can't believe it's not butter. I've made it the other way also, and honestly, it's just as amazing to our tastebuds. I substitute with what I have on hand with many recipes. As long as the substitutes are close, it's certain that you won't be disappointed, either way. We loved it, substitutes or no. I highly recommend making  this recipe. It's a winner!

Great basic recipe. I used whole milk with a little cornstarch and it was plenty thick for my pasta. I added a bit of black pepper and sauted the garlic with the butter.

This sauce is so simple and so good. I followed the recipe mostly (except I only had dried parsley). Even with the dried parsley, it was very good!

I didn’t make any changes, but wish I had used unsalted butter. I double-checked the recipe to see if I had made that mistake by using salted butter. We found this Alfredo sauce recipe way to salty. It was easy to make, however. I will try it again, but use unsalted butter or less cheese to see if that makes a difference.

If I could give 0 stars I would. Ruined this recipe Bc I followed it completely. They forgot to mention if you burn the butter, start over. Also they didn’t say to remove pan from heat & add cheese in parts. The cheese curdled & we had no dinner. What a waste!

It is SUPER CHEESY and so delicious but it becomes sticky after 10 minutes or so because of how much cheese it has, so you will probably need to add more cream to it before digging in it again but that will reduce its cheesyness. I added shrimps and it worked PERFECTLY, it balances everything and makes the dish a lot TASTIER.

Liked it a lot! I am strictly gluten free so I used LiveGFree ALDI brand gluten free penne, used 2tsp of minced garlic and shredded some Parmesan myself. I left out the parsley, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. I prefer white wines so I looked up recommendations and am pairing it with a glass of Barefoot Chardonnay. I like it and will be making it again!

Amazing. After reading some of the reviews I was hesitant...but after making this sauce so pleased. If a recipe only calls for a few ingredients use the best! It will taste good or bad depending on the quality of butter, heavy cream and cheese. The only change I made was I added 4 smashed cloves of garlic to the butter as it melted. This is a no brainers. Simple and tasty. Can't wait for dinner.

My 1st time making this recipe so here’s my 2 cents.  Next time I will not substitute the heavy cream with 10% cream.  Unless you love garlic, 1 clove is enough.  I used 2...ugh.  I will leave the mushrooms and bacon out of it.  The freshly grated Parmesan worked very well, I used salted butter and it wasn’t too salty at all.  The fresh parsley from the garden was also good.  The recipe cooking instructions and portions works well.

I added some of my own spices but left the recipe basically the same. I will say the Fresh Parsley and real grate it yourself cheese is huge when doing this recipe. Cooking is imaginative and recipes are only a guide. Thx it was delicious ??

So simple. I followed some of the other suggested comments and used parm AND gruyere cheese. Delicious! I may try it with just gruyere alone next time.

I did half parmesan/half asiago freshly grated. Used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. Omitted parsley. It was perfect. Creamy and slightly sweet!

Excellent recipe. I doubled it and did half cream cheese, half heavy cream. Also, mixed grated Parmesan with shredded. It came out awesome! Better than most restaurants. Thanks!

Fabulous recipe to used as a firm foundation to be expanded upon.   It  is quick, easy, and creamy. Reminiscent of a favorite dish at a little Italian restaurant in Bethel, Connecticut I used to frequent 30 years ago.  I was sure to follow the recipe exactly until the last minute of gently bubbling on the stove top after adding the freshly grated cheese.  To personalize the Alfredo, I added (all freshly cracked/grated)  black pepper, pink Himalayan sea salt, and just a touch of nutmeg.   Also, I stirred in a clove or two more of  garlic I had sautéed in a little butter, just until fragrant.  Buono Appetito!

Made this today and my daughter loved it! Made a rookie mistake using salted butter for a pretty salty finish after adding Parmesan.

It was delicious with a couple of alterations. I only used 1 Cup of Parmesan Cheese, added more Cream and I used roasted Garlic to give a nice rich garlic flavor. I didn't add any thickeners, I just made the above adjustments.

The best tasting Alfredo sauce I have ever had! I make Alfredo sauce at least once a week (my favorite sauce), but I thought I'd try a new recipe last night, and it will be my new standby.

It was easy and good but I would use less Parmesan, maybe 1 cup instead of 1.5 cups. It was a bit too strong. I added more heavy cream and some flour mixed with a small amount of water to tame it a bit. Then it was perfect.

It's  a good base. As is, it's very vanilla and bland. Add whatever seasonings u want to make it ur own. Didn't have parmesan so I used Cracker Barrel havarti cheese (I got it from Grocery Outlet ) and a slice of pepperjack, some random seasoning and onion & garlic powders. Came out delish.

This is an outstanding baseline recipe. Of course, I always make tweaks to any recipe I find online, like, noticing the Alfredo looked like it would barely cover two bowls of pasta so, I doubled the heavy cream, butter, and garlic cloves. Didn’t use as much parsley as the recipe indicated and added salt a and pepper. The only constant I used in this recipe was the 1 1/2 cups of Parmesan. It seemed to be the perfect amount of cheese for the other doubled ingredients.

DELICIOUS! I can’t believe I never attempted Alfredo Sauce before! It was so easy & incredibly quick!!!!  I doubled the recipe & added 12 slices of crushed bacon. I added/whisked in 1/2 the bacon to the sauce just before serving & garnished the pasta & sauce with the rest of the bacon. I served with shrimp.  My husband & daughter, son in law & grandchildren loved it.  I will definitely make this again!

I reduced the amount of garlic since my husband can't eat it much. I also omitted the parsley. Came out awesome! Will definitely make again. Much better flavor and cheaper than buying at the  grocery store.

I loved this Alfredo sauce it had really great flavor. Only thing was I would have preferred shredded parmesan to the grated Parmesan, I thought it got a little to grainy. I also added a little milk to thin it out as well. Otherwise super simple and easy to make with great flavor

always wanted to try my own alfredo sauce,  just needed th e basic recipe,  I sauteed the garlic and some diced onions first then added the cream to simmer and thicken a little on its own.  the only cheese I had was about 1/4 cup parm, 1/4 cup asiago, and about a 1/2 cup or so of  a mixed italian cheese blend, simmered til as thick as I wanted it,  WOW,  the asiago cheese made it!!  so good!  thanks for the basics''

Made as listed with freshly grated packed Parmesan and dried parsley. Fresh would have been better, but this was still great. Next time won’t pack the Parmesan so thick.

Nice, easy and quick sauce.  The hard part was getting the timing right.  Both the sauce and the noodles cook about the same time so it was a challenge keeping everything hot until I could serve it.  Flavor wise, my husband loved the flavor.  Preferred it to the store's premade brand.

The proportions are way off. I had to add another 1.5 cups of skim milk to make this look even remotely like a sauce. Before that,  it just looked like a melted blob. I also had to triple the garlic and add pepper or there would have been no flavor.

Super quick and delicious!  I made it with fettuccine and shrimp.  My family LOVED it and couldn’t believe how fast dinner was served.  Will definitely be saving this recipe for future use!

This is my go-to alfredo recipe. It is so easy to make. I use pre-shredded parmesan, but make sure it is the kind with no fillers (cellulose, etc), just cheese. I add it 1/2 cup at a time. I also cooked some cut up chicken and when it was almost done threw the garlic in with it to saute instead of putting it in the sauce. I think next time I'll keep it in the sauce.

So simple to make fresh, and delicious! Used unsalted butter. Used a combination of pecorino and asiago cheeses for a robust flavor; about 2 cups total grated (not packed). Enjoyed with sauteed chicken and fettuccine.

It's delicious. Fast and easy. Now when I make mine, i always add a little flour with the butter to get started. It gets thicker quicker and gives it a richer texture.

I was way to cheesy - like eating the cheese out of the jar. If I make it again I'll try a 1/2 cup of fresh parm.

Personally I love cheese, but I thought the recipe had a little too much, if I made it again I would use maybe a cup at the most and some more garlic, besides that it was very good. I don't know how to cook either by the way.

I doubled the recipe and it was delicious but I would not consider this Alfredo sauce. This is a rich parm cheese cream sauce. It was perfect to top our lightly breaded pan fried chicken. It was very rich though so a little bit went a long way. An Alfredo sauce should have a smoother consistency and a more mild flavor- this tasted like pure parm cheese.

The sauce was perfect and delicious. The only reason I didn’t give it a five was because it tasted terrible reheated because everything separated. So make sure you eat it all the night you make it.

This is definitely a good starting point to making alfredo sauce. I cut and seasoned my chicken thighs with Italian seasoning garlic ect. Cooked it in pan. Then took it out and cooked my sauce  in the same pan with all that was left over seasoning bits of the cooked chicken. Added more Italian seasoning ect if needed and done. Me husband and kids loved it had nothing left. Have to make.more today. I used Kraft shredded parmesan cheese.  And it was fine.

Great easy Alfredo.   My husband doesn't like parmesan so I used fresh grated Romano plus butter, heavy cream and 4 cloves roasted garlic.  Will try asiago next time.

We all actually loved this. I don’t usually use garlic powder but I did or would have added more then 1 clove. Just had jarred Parmesan so took pan off stove and stirred it in to keep mix from clumping. We did 1/2 a recipe and was enough for 4 people- course we mixed some marinara sauce in with it. Definitely a winner! Thanks

This was so easy to make and was really good. Not like store bought Alfredo thick gooey bland sauce. I didn't have heavy cream so I used what we had,  2% fat milk and it still turned out great. The parmesan makes the sauce so don't scrimp on the cheese.

Out of necessity, I did change this recipe a little... I had doubled the recipe and realized I didn't have enough parmesan cheese, so I used what we had on hand ~ garlic and chive white cheddar cheese curds (which I grated) to account for the missing parm. The flavor and consistency were amazing and it definitely kicked it up a notch.
My family loved it and from now on, I'll be making it this way every time. 
(In case you're wondering, I only had about one cup of parmesan. I grated enough cheese curds to make about 2 cups. DEFINITELY worth it!!)

The key to this recipe is to use GRATED Parmesan cheese. I made the mistake, once before, using shredded cheese and that turned into a sticky mess. It was still edible, but certainly not the creamy texture that using grated cheese gives you. Overall, this is a great base to use; I enjoy it just as it’s written. It also makes a good base to add other ingredients based on your taste preferences.

I use this as a base for my Alfredo. it is a nice flavor and consistency but a bit thick so I alter slightly with equal parts heavy cream and milk (or just use half and half instead) and always add a bit of pasta water to it.

Pretty good sauce but next time I would lay back on the parsley. I’m not a huge fan of cheese so I cut back on some. Added garlic paste instead of clove

Awesome and easy. I didn’t have heavy cream (it was time to go get groceries and I was trying to use up stuff in the fridge). So, I doubled the recipe and used 2 cups of whole milk, grated Parmesan cheese, and the last of a block of white sharp cheddar. The thickened nicely, even with milk. I had grilled chicken from dinner last night that I chopped up  and boiled the rest of the egg noodles I had (only pasta left) and it tastes amazing!!!! I also added a few dashes of garlic salt. I see most recipes on here as suggestions.

I give this 5 stars because of the simplicity to prepare that yielded a wonderful flavor!  Gruyere!  Who would have thought that would have made a simple Alfredo so much better and so much creamier?!?  I added a little more garlic and a small amount of celery salt.  This is now my Alfredo.  No need to look elsewhere.

Made this recipe with some slight changes. I know it's annoying when people do that because you want to know if the recipe is good as is but it still would be. I just added a little white pepper, minced the garlic, and left out the parsley (didn't have any on hand and honestly it was awesome without it). I know some people said they had trouble with parmesan melting but mine melted within seconds. Used Bel Gioso and grated myself. Hope this helps!

It is one of my favorite sauces to make but after I put the sauce on the pasta and but it on plates I normally put some pepper on top to make the flavor more impeccable, but over all very delicious!!!

Great basic recipe for Alfredo.  Can add a bit of nutmeg for a more traditional Alfredo. I add fresh parsley from my garden when it’s in season. I also like to add artichoke hearts and/or chicken breast and top it with fresh diced tomatoes. The tomatoes give it a carbonara vibe and add a light, cool and fresh quality to a sauce that is heavy. I add a a couple tablespoons more of Parmesan. Sometimes, I add Asiago with the parm. I grate them finely and they melt bueutifully.

I skipped the parsley, used jarred garlic, and didn’t measure the Parmesan (I just winged it). It tasted like Olive Garden pasta! My new go-to Alfredo sauce. So easy and waaaaaay more appetizing than jarred Alfredo sauces.

Good, simple alfredo recipe.  The recipe does need salt and pepper.  I added 1/2 tsp of salt and a dash of pepper.

This is wonderful as is, but I actually like it even better with half the cheese, so I’ve made it three times and I double everything except the cheese for our family of 7.

This recipe is excellent. I add the garlic in as I’m melting the butter, it makes the flavor pop more. Also, if you’re making a big pot of pasta, you may want to quadruple the recipe...the serving as is doesn’t make very much at all

I followed the recipe as written.  I doubled the recipe for a whole box of barilla fettuccine pasta and also added sauteed chicken and mushrooms. It I was tasty.  After making, I put all in the crock, just on warm .  The noodles really soaked in the sauce.   Thanks for the recipe.  Easy, peasy!

I love this alfredo sauce. This time when I made it though, the parmesan cheese immediately got real stringy, like mozzarella when hot. To salvage, I tried putting it in my nutribullet. It worked! So, if you end up with the same problem, try a nutribullet or blender.

I did a smidge more butter and parmesan.  Fantastic!!! Served with baked chicken breasts. Had a little more pasta than sauce but didn't even matter.

It was a little too thick for my liking, I think that next time I will add a little bit more butter/cream.

Incredibly good!!! I didn’t have any trouble with the Parmesan melting, but I did whisk almost continuously and I let it cook quite a bit longer than called for. I also turned up the heat a bit. It was delicious!!!

Delicious! Didn't have fresh parsley.  Can't wait to make this in the summer, when the parsley in the herb garden is full and lush!  The Parmesan makes for a salty sauce, which means that the salt shaker didn't get used.  We are eating in the Keto fashion, and used this sauce for the sauteed greens and vegetables.  Goes good over eggs, too.

This was so simple and delicious!  Of course I didn’t have exact ingredients so I used half and half instead of cream and I added the garlic to the butter first to infuse some of the flavor into the butter, then added the half and half.  I used about 3/4 cup Parmesan and 3/4 cup mozzarella, it was delicious if a little on the thick side.  Next time a little more half and half !  I made shrimp scampi to serve on noodles also , YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This was ultra easy, and absolutely delicious. Unfortunately I did not have any fresh parsley, but I did add some cracked black pepper while it was cooking.  You can make this so fast, and it turns out wonderful. I have no idea why anyone would ever want to buy alfredo sauce in a jar again.

The only thing I did differently was added a little bit of Italian shredded cheese (about a cup), along with some cornstarch for thickening. I had to triple the recipe since I a small army to feed. ??

So simple it’s ridiculous. I added a handful of peas to the simmering sauce and finished with fresh grinding of black pepper when serving. Next time, a drizzle of truffle oil and I’ll look like I got this from little Italy.

My first time making Alfredo sauce and it was surprisingly very easy. I gave this recipe a few tweaks because I found the Parmesan cheese flavor to be a bit overwhelming:
1. I added a little salt (like maybe 1/8 tsp) and freshly ground black pepper (1/4-1/2 tsp depending on how much you like black pepper).
2. I also added 1/4tsp of ground nutmeg
3. I added a couple TBs of whole milk at the end and whisked it in to incorporate with the sauce and thin it out a touch.
4. I made the pasta separately and drained most of the pasta water except for maybe a 1/2-3/4c of pasta water. I then added 3 big handfuls of baby spinach, gave a good stir, partially covered with a lid (to let the steam escape) and set it to low for 5 min or so to let the spinach wilt - not to where it was soggy, just until softened.
5. I added the pasta and spinach to the Alfredo sauce, added a little oregano (1/4-1/2tsp), stirred again, then garnished with some chopped parsley.

In the future, I may make the following changes:
1. Maybe substitute 1/2 the Parmesan with Gruyere or another cheese , to offset the Parmesan a little bit.
2. Instead of oregano, I may add Italian seasoning when I add the nutmeg.
3. Add other veggies such as broccoli/cauliflower mix (like a Normandy frozen veggie mix)

I have made this several times now and here's what I learned. 1) ya gotta let it simmer the five minutes 2)add the cheese in thirds and stir until it melts before adding more cheese 3) do no skimp on the cheese. Buy the good stuff for this. 4) double the recipe cuz everybody loves it!

This sauce is amazing - It paired perfectly with a homemade fettuccini!

It was incredibly simple to make, and easy to let sit simmering on a burner while everything else finished up.

Some extra cheese helped to thicken it up some, and extra garlic is never bad!

I have tried several alfredo recipes, but this will be my go-to from now on. Delicious and easy to make. I added chicken and peas, this is a great sauce on its own, but easy to add to. Thank you for sharing this!

I’ve been making this recipe for years. Everyone loves it. I usually add chicken, broccoli and zucchini to it. It’s rich and creamy. I think the key is using fresh grated parmesan, not anything like Kraft.

I used 1 cup parmesan cheese and 1 cup shredded "creamy melt" Mozzarella cheese and added 1 cup of milk in addition to the 1 cup of heavy cream. I kept everything else the same & it was delicious!!!

This turned out wonderful.  I added some cooked, sliced chicken breast and also used homegrown parsley.  Since I have to refrain from gluten due to Celiac, I used Barilla gluten-free fettuccine and it did not taste any different than regular pasta. My picky husband even loved it!

Very delicious, it's a great recipe to use as a base. I tried using the best quality parmesan as that really makes a huge difference. Only change I made was I used 2 cups heavy cream and 1/2 tablespoons salt for taste.

I made this sauce using the reduced fat cream cheese as some people recommended and it was very good. Very easy and quick to whip up. I poured it over grilled chicken and ravioli and my household all said it was good. Also as others have pointed out, you cannot taste the cream cheese once you've added all your ingredients. I think the taste that stood out the most in the sauce was the parmesan. Overall I was very satisfied with this recipe and I will definitely save it and keep it in my recipe book.

I’m not big on measuring I usually just wing it but my kids loved this. I added shrimp and chicken this is def a fav now

It's good but I doubled the recipe and the pasta and vegetables I mixed in needed salt otherwise it could have been bland. Added black pepper.

This is the best Alfredo. Tastes just like Olive Garden. The recipe itself is perfect. I play around with recipe and cooked the garlic, large cuts with the butter. I used half n half and the whipping cream to lighten the sauce. If you happen to have leftovers it won’t harder as much if you did the original recipe.

A good quick recipe for alfredo. I did make a couple small changes. No matter what alfredo sauce recipe you use, always use freshly grated real parmesan cheese. It makes all the difference. I also add 1 more garlic clove (family of garlic lovers) and of course a little bit of black pepper. We make this at least once a month.

The whole family loved it. I added a squeeze of lemon to the sauce to give it a zing. I will be making this again and when the price of heavy cream is on sale, the price is very worth it.

I barely give anything 5 stars. But this was a great base for Alfredo sauce. I did make some adjustments, per my liking though: I added more cream, a tablespoon more butter, cracked black pepper and more garlic. It was perfect! Will use this recipe again!

Absolutely love this version! The only thing I did differently was add a pinch of garlic salt instead of a garlic clove. I also added less of the parsley, but it all turned out amazingly!

This is my go to Alfredo! I recommend grating a block of Parmesan as opposed to using already grated/shredded. The flavor difference is insane! It is a little runnier when I grate the cheese, but the flavor is worth it. Fantastic, simple sauce!

The directions are easy to follow. You are making a white sauce and making it very cheesy. I found half and half, even subbing some milk in, still makes for a rich pasta sauce. Very indulgent

I actually use this recipe as a good base for my Chicken Alfredo Pizza. I tweak it a little as I prepare the sauce but I go back to this to start the sauce every time.

Easy and excellent. I've been making Alfredo from scratch for about 20 years, based on basic recipes I using restaurants that it worked in. This is my kids favorite and it was easier and faster.

Very bland.  I tried adding different spices, but the boring taste just masks everything I add. I admit though, it's a great meal if you like dull food.

So good! I love this recipe!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I threw in some frozen peas towards the end of cooking.  The sauce was phenomenal! I served it over mushroom ravioli and topped it with some dehydrated mushrooms. 
Thank you for posting it!

This is definitely a good starter recipe. Easy and quick. I grated my own parmesan and added black pepper & nutmeg. I was surprised that I needed to add salt too with that much parmesan cheese. I served it over penne noodles with grilled chicken and steamed broccoli. My family enjoyed it. Definitely better than jar sauce.

Excellent tasting and easy to make. Added an additional 1/4 cup whole milk to thin out some. Use high quality pre shaved Parmesan for best results and add extra garlic if so inclined. Also garnished with crispy prosciutto.

This recipe was so easy and came out amazing! I substituted parmesan for gruyere cheese as someone's comment suggested. Next time i think i will try with gorgonzola. Tastes better than a restaurants alfredo.

It’s delicious. I sautéed the garlic. I used a cup of milk and then added about half a cup of half and half. ALS added mushrooms sliced. It’s positively delicious! Will serve with fettuccini noodles and probably add broccoli to the mixture

This tastes amazing AND is so easy to make! My family couldn’t get enough. In fact, there were no leftovers. I would recommend using a high quality Parmesan cheese instead of the one in the can. It will not only melt easier but taste better. I will use this recipe from now on.

Muffin mom is clearly a pretentious twat. Three years in Italy means  all if ya can't cook, honey. The fact that you couldn't fix up a simple alfredo sauce speaks VOLUMES about your skill. It's God  cream and cheese, yet you couldn't figure out how to fix the recipe...  off. I could do a better job whipping one up with my .  She's from Florida, so there's no need for an explanation.

Super yummy recipe (with a few minor adjustments and a secret ingredient)!Here’s what I did: 1 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of minced white onion, followed by 2 cups of heavy cream, 2 16oz. bags of parmesan cheese (I had a handful of Italian mixed cheese in my fridge so I added that too). While whisking I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and the secret ingredient, nutmeg. Yes I said nutmeg!  So yummy and now my new alfredo sauce recipe keeper!!

Just made this. Wow. Delicious! Back when we used to Olive Garden In Canada, we used to love their Chicken Florentine Fettucini Alfredo.
I just used this sauce to recreate the dish, and it is amazing. The only change I made was to double-up on the garlic because we are fiends for it. Amazing!

This was terrible! Way to much Parmesan! I use two other recipes for Alfredo that are vastly different but delicious however I was in a hurry and decided to try a new one since I just downloaded this app and it’s super fast to find recipes. I wound up adding a little more butter, more parsley, an additional cup of cream, basil, and oregano. It made it editable. I will not be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and wasn’t impressed, it was way too rich and thick and almost powdery from all the Parmesan cheese it was so thick that I had to add some milk to it just to have more of a sauce consistency, I wouldn’t make it again

With parmesan it is fantastic.
The second time I made it, I used gruyere cheese which made it more like a cheese fondue sauce. Both were tasty but I really prefer parmesan!

This is the easiest and best tasting Alfredo sauce. I’ve made it a number if times for my family and it’s always a hit.

Taste wise...rich and decadent.   But the consistency was not good.   Followed the directions and read many of the reviews for advice (and used good quality ingredients) but the parm wouldn't melt down to a smooth and creamy consistency.  It was gummy and chewy and grainy!   Had to eat it quick because it  solidified on the pasta.  I'll have to keep refining my technique or move onto a different recipe.

Eventually it  turned out delicious. But I added the cheese too quickly the first time and it turned into a rubber ball in a soup. The second time I stirred and stirred and grated directly into my milk and butter.

This was a great find! I’ve made this several times already and everyone has absolutely loved and devoured it. I haven’t made any substitutions to this besides omitting cream cheese once since I was out and it was still great! 10/10, will make again!

We really liked it. I changed a couple things just simply because I didn't have a couple of the ingredients or not enough of. I used Italian seasonin in place of parsley and garlic powder in place of minced garlic. I also used less parmesan cheese and added cornstarch and water instead to thicken it.  Thank so much I will not be buying jar sauce ever again.

I made this recipe exactly as is but added grilled chicken. My significant other, who loves chicken alfredo, said mine was better than the Olive Garden. I wasn't sure I believed that, so we purchased an alfredo meal from Olive Garden and did our own taste test. My alfredo was richer, creamier and more flavorful. No use for Oliver Garden alfredo again. Thanks Allrecipes.

This was simple and tasty. I added a little pepper and nutmeg for flavor. My mistake was in using pre-shredded Parmesan. It would have been creamier if I had taken the time to shred it myself. Otherwise I followed the recipe.

I took out some parm and added ricotta as well as using half the prescribed parsley and using two cloves instead of one, finally I added an eighth of a cup of pepper. Add some broccoli and chicken with fettuccini. Side salad, finish with a nice piece of cheesecake or a cannoli.

My family love this recipe they said it was better than our local Italian restaurant. I did make a few changes. First I used two cloves of garlic and browned it in a table spoon of olive oil. Then  used a three cheese bread of Italian cheese instead of just parmasian.

I doubled this recipe for a large dish with tortellini, chicken, and spinach.  It tasted good, but either I didn't use enough parmesan cheese (use actual parmesan, not that powdery stuff, and it'll melt for you) or there's just way too much butter in this recipe, because I wound up having a giant puddle of butter at the bottom of my container the next day.  Which don't get me wrong, it tasted good, but still.

I'd recommend halving the amount of butter you use to start with, and/or adding some milk with flour to help make it a little creamier.

Oh, and add lots of black pepper and oregano.

It’s a good base recipe. I added an extra half clove of garlic, Italian spice and pepper. You just have to keep taste testing until you get the flavouring you like.

Great recipe as is. I like to tinker so.... This time I added some extra garlic, used a tsp-ish Of Herb de Providence (a tasty gift from my sister in CT.) instead of parsley. Had a handful of shredded Italian 6 cheese left so I added that and cut the Parmesan  down to 1 cup.

OMG this was absolutely amazing!! My girlfriend loves Alfredo, especially from Olive Garden. When I made this she freaked out and said it tastes like Olive Garden, almost better even. I added an extra half cup of Parmesan, extra garlic clove, and a TBS of flour to make the sauce less runny, and it came out absolutely perfect. I also added a little pepper and a little extra parsley. Our new go to when we cook fettuccine, screw the store bought sauce, every brand is disgusting

Wow, I just made the best Alfredo sauce I've ever had with this recipe. Better than restaurants. 
At restaurants this dish costs minimum 15$ for one person, and at home for 8$ I added mushrooms and fed myself, my girlfriend and I had leftovers still!

ALSO very easy to make

This was delicious. My five year old son ate a grown up size portion, and he rarely wants to finish pasta.  I will definitely make this again.

I did substitute ¼ tsp. garlic powder for the clove of garlic.

Made it as the recipe called for  and it was super thick; it was more like a heavy cheese dip rather than a sauce for pasta. Luckily, I had chicken broth at home and was able to add a splash or two of that in order to thin it out and make it more sauce-like. With the impromptu addition it was awesome, however without it the “sauce” would’ve gone in the trash.

I double it. This is an amazing recipe if you use the right Parmesan cheese. I don't usually add the Parsley and I do add pepper. So easy and so good. I cut up and cook about a pound of chicken breasts in a pan with 2-3 Tbsp of salted butter and black pepper, then transfer the chicken to a dish, then put a stick of butter and 2 tsp. of minced garlic in the pan I just cooked the chicken in, stir it until the butter melts, add 2 cups of heavy cream, stir until the cream is nice and hot, then add about 2 cups of shredded Parmesan. Once the Parm has melted and the sauce is a bit thickened, I add the chicken back in, turn it all to low, and cover and cook it all for about 10 more minutes, or until the pasta is done. A family favorite.

Great easy recipe, mine had to much garlic so I suggest finding a medium sized to small sized clove when you make the recipe. 

My husband and daughter loved it though! They didn't think it was to much garlic just me.

I make this often.  Usually, I use romano (less grainy) instead of parmesan, or use both.  Also, double the garlic.  I've used heavy cream or half and half with the same success.  Simple and delicious!

I have made this several times and it’s a good recipe and very easy. I prefer to add fresh ground black pepper and crushed red pepper to add more flavor so it’s not too bland. It doesn’t make much sauce but you really don’t need much of this sauce to coat the pasta.

Very good recipe!  Super easy but very tasty.  I doubled the recipe bc I have 3 big boys who like left overs.  I grated my own Parmesan and the only thing I added was black pepper and dried parsley instead of fresh.  It was fairly garlicky in a good way.  Will make again!!!

So easy. I added fresh shrimp at the end and cooked until they were done.  Added cooked fettuccini to make it a complete meal. We loved it!

Made this over brown rice with chicken & it was really good! Added onions & mushrooms for flavor. Going to try throwing in some broccoli next time. Doesn’t need any salt either! Saving this one!!

I used cream cheese but added just a bit of parmesan, I also added in diced up Roma tomatoes to add a light acid flavor. I poured it over a bed of baked spaghetti squash and chopped pan seared chicken thighs. I hardly ever measure and this is a dish that can be altered with any of your favorite flavors... IT WAS DEEEELICIOOUSSS.

Wow this was terrible. It was just wet cheese. Had to add 1 cup of milk and another 1/4 cup of butter just to get the consistency right, along with about 1/8 cup of flour. After that it still had no flavor so ended up throwing in salt, pepper, garlic powder, and italian seasoning to taste. Really garbage recipe. Can't believe it had such a high rating.

I've had to triple the recipe. But it still turned out excellent. My family loves it. Fresh ground pepper and a bit of sea salt makes it great too. I cook all my chicken 1st with its seasoning. Then I cook the Alfredo in the same pan sometimes. That's really good also. Thank you.

I love this recipe! It's my go-to for alfredo sauce because it's quick and easy with good results! I usually use half parmesan and half asiago cheese and then add some fresh black pepper. I *highly* recommend buying blocks of cheese and grating them yourself for this. The cheese melts easier, and the sauce tastes so much better!

I gave this 4 instead of 5 because I definitely needed another cup of heavy cream otherwise it was just congealed melted cheese and I added some garlic. Other than that it was perfect.

It was good. A bit bland, but then I didn't have parsley and used herbs de province instead. Need lots of salt. However, my niece and nephew loved it! I put that in the win column.

This is a terrific sauce! I sauteed the garlic in the butter and then removed the garlic as best as I could. My family does not care for the pieces of garlic in the sauce. My son said this was better than anything he has ordered like it in a restaurant. Make sure to grate your own fresh cheese and I don't think you will be disappointed.

Made this for my husband ..and served it with a tortellini type pasta. This sauce will only be as good as the quality of your cheese. I used cheese from the specialty cheese section at my local grocery store.. most times you can find smaller chunks of the REAL stuff ..and it's not very expensive. Overall taste was good..i don't eat this type of dish anymore  But if I did I would have doubled up the garlic and added pepper.

This is delicious!!! It’s perfect for a low carb meal. I grill 4 chicken brest in a frying pan with a pinch of salt and pepper. Then Boiled some fresh broccoli about two handfuls you can use frozen broccoli but I prefer fresh. When the broccoli and Chicken are done you just put them aside and then start making the Alfredo sauce. Put the chicken and the broccoli on a plate and just pour the Alfredo sauce all over the chicken and broccoli. Omg, delicious. And there you go a low-carb meal.

Diffidently a keeper.  I sauteed the garlic in the butter prior to adding the heavy cream & freshly grated Parmesan.  I also doubled the sauce along with the garlic.  Never have enough Alfredo sauce. :)

Didn't think that this would be so tasty. It's such a simple recipe. It reminds me of the pasta dish we always ordered in Rome, cacio e pepe. So easy to make and tastes delicious. A hit with the husband and kids.

Tastes great! I made this with pasta and chicken for my parents, and they loved it. My mom said she’s never going to buy the pre-made alfredo again.

Everyone in my family loved it!  Kids (3&5yrs) was awesome.  Husband said it was restaurant quality.  And it was EASY to make.  I will never go back to store bought Alfredo again!

All thee of us loved it.  It was rich and creamy, and so good.  I made a double batch, and we're going to freeze what's left of it (though there isn't much!), and see how that works. If it freezes okay, I can make extra batches and store it in the freezer for a quick dinner fix.

Wasn't all that great, my whole family thought it was pretty heavy on the Parmesan. I added more cream but think I will search for a recipe with a higher ratio of cream and butter to the amount of Parmesan called for in this recipe.

I made this the other night. I didn't have heavy cream so I had to substitute half and half. Otherwise I followed the recipe as it was written. The taste pretty good but I found it to be a little too thick and rich. If I make this again, I will add more cream or butter in order to thin out the sauce some.

It’s a very good base recipe, but it was far too thick and sort of plain. I added a lot of skim milk to thin it out and a lot of spice and seasoning (Italian, red pepper, black pepper) to make it taste better.

I have made this about a dozen times now. When I had to triple the recipe for a luncheon.  I made it in the crock pot.  I add 1cup of chopped leftover chicken per 4 serving recipe. Then right before I walk out the door I drop in some al dente fettuccine noodles.  Keep it on warm.  Everyone loves it.  So easy

Fantastic modern Alfedo. Considering that real Alfredo sauce is nothing more than butter & Parmesan cheese for the sauce, this wasn't bad at all. For those who don't know alfredo history, here you go! 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fettuccine_Alfredo

I too lived in Italy for some time and have a problem with American wannabe Italian anything. Newer versions of this sauce include thickening agents & or cream. I added a bit more garlic to it to go with salt & pepper. I had unsalted butter. I used flat leaf parsley. Along with some fresh garlic, put it through my presser so it came out nice and crushed as opposed to minced jar garlic. Added a splash of white cooking wine. A pinch of nutmeg & 1 egg. & half cup of romano cheese & only 1 cup of Parmesan cheese.

I think you should try your food as you are making it at that same time, so that if you need to add something that you think would compliment it, you can do so. I enjoyed it. Thanks.

Super salty, instead of sitting only being rich tasting. Unfortunately it was either too runny, or thick and gritty when cooked down for consistency.

This was delish ~  I did what the reviews suggested and added 1/2 Gryerre and 1/2 Parm and a little flour to thicken.  I also added a bit extra garlic.  Kids raved over this.

This was so good; especially considering the few ingredients required.  I doubled the batch without doubling the butter and used dried parsley because it is what I had.  Extremely simply and extremely tasty.  I was a little concerned that it was not thick enough but once it cools, it was perfect.  

I added this to sautéed onions, mushrooms, broccoli, shrimp, and blackened chicken over fettuccini.

I added a few more ingredients and took some away and substituted others. Had no heavy whipping cream so I just used cream and milk. No garlic. So I used garlic powder. I also added salt black pepper mozzarella along with Italian seasoning and some chicken  bouillon. It is DELICIOUS. Thick and creamy as it should be.

Very good! Added 2 garlic cloves to butter to sauté them. Then added cream & cheese. Put on low & whisked frequently. Added a little pepper. My daughter raves about it and she is a connoisseur of Alfredo!

I have made this twice now, it is very good and super easy. The first time I added grilled chicken and the second prosciutto and peas. I enjoyed it both ways. My only caution is don’t make extra thinking you will have left overs, when you reheat it gets very oily and the sauce separates. As someone who enjoys left overs this is the only complaint I have. Otherwise I highly recommend.

This sauce is pretty good my wife loves it. I did however make a few adjustments I doubled the recipe and used 2 cups of parm and 1 1/2 cups of Asiago cheese. I also added about 1/2 cup of full fat milk. Just because I like my Alfredo sauce a bit thinner. Over all quick easy and very delicious.

Look, I saw a review with 3000 likes- the person suggested gruyere. That is not Alfredo sauce. That is Mac and cheese. Yes, the review is fifteen years old, but if you are out there, Mrs. Sweet, I sure hope you’ve learned how to cook. For cryi by

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I had to add some more heavy cream as the consistency was too thick at first, but then it was great.  I didn't have any parsley and it was still very good.  I will make again.  Easy to do.

I love this sauce because it was not too heavy and everyone loved it! My boyfriend was not expecting much since he is not a fan of cream sauces but he actually really liked this one.  Will definitely make this sauce again.

It is really good overall. I added salt and pepper. I made this to put over spinach fettuccine with mushrooms, green beans and chicken. I threw the mushrooms into the sauce while cooking it.

I made this exactly as specified and it was delicious! I was actually making extra sauce to add to a pot in which I used canned alfredo sauce from the store, and after I made this, I vowed to never buy canned sauce again! So glad I finally tried this recipe!

Best Alfredo sauce I’ve ever had! Definitely need to whisk it quickly to blend the Parm cheese and make it less gritty than it appears when it’s just stirred gently. I use a 6-serving ingredient list, but used only 1-1/4 cups parm cheese instead of the 2-1/4 cups it called for. To reheat for leftovers, I suggest you keep the sauce in a small saucepan and reheat slowly on stovetop. It will be very buttery/oily at first, so you must again strongly whisk it to get back to its creamy texture. Don’t use a microwave to reheat bc it just gets oily and gritty.

This was a good versatile alfredo base.  I doubled the recipe (with a bit less butter and cheese) to work with 16oz. pasta for a dinner party.  I didn't have fresh garlic, so I used garlic powder (probably about 1 tsp.) and I added a little fresh parsley.  Everyone loved it, including the kids.  Easy dinner party recipe that's super fast, looks good, and doesn't take you away from the guests too long while you cook it.  Served with a salad.

As per the other reviewers, I used Gruyere instead of parmesan. I also used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 1. (We're a garlic loving family). I ended up thinning the sauce out by adding about a cup of half and half, but that could be because I didn't measure the gruyere. It was delicious, and I will make it again. The only thing I might change would be to thin the sauce even more, or use less fettuccini.  It's a great recipe!

After adding the cheese, it was more like glue than sauce. Thinned it out with milk and got it to the right consistency, but the finished product was flavorless and chalky. Needed

I made this the other night. It was so quick and easy!! And more importantly delicious!! I had to make it twice because I screwed up and the sauce broke, but at least now I know when to quit stirring!! :) Next time I think I'll dice up some pancetta and throw it in but definitely worth your time!!

A few tips that were omitted from the recipe. 

You want to add 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch to the cheese prior to adding into the hot cream mixture. Coat the cheese with it. That should stop it from separating or clumping. 

 Also if it gets too thick use a bit of the pasta cooking water to loosen it up. 

Throw the hot pasta directly from the water into the sauce and finish in the pan. 

Quality of ingredients is super important here. If you are using crappy parm you will have issues. 

This worked out well for me. Flavor was good and consistency was great after the above modifications. Minus one star for the missing basics.

Great recipe, but the "20 minute" cook time was absurd. Be prepared to spend easily 90 minutes on this undertaking. We thought we had enough parmesan to make this, but we did not. We had to drive back to the store to buy more. There was no mention of needing to do this in the recipe, it would be nice if someone could add that.

This didn’t work out for me. I knew it was a little too basic but I was in hurry and I ended working harder than I would have with my dependable recipe. I used Parmesan Romano and it would not thicken at all. I ended up adding corn starch and eventually added cheddar and took turned it into a version of Mac and cheese. I had already added three cloves of garlic because who can even taste one clove?!? I also added basil which have it a nice little kick.

Super easy and it was delicious! I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was perfect.

I didn’t have heavy cream so I just used the 2% I had on hand.  I think this made it too thin so I added extra Parmesan. It never got really smooth. But the flavor was good and I was in a hurry.

Followed instructions but used pregrated Parmesan cheese. Sauce turned out quite grainy. Would use 2 garlic cloves next time. Really couldn’t tell it was in the sauce.

Turned out so good and was easy to make. I added more garlic, parmesan, salt and pepper to suit our preferences. Added chicken. Next time I will try adding green onions and mushrooms with our chicken.

I followed the directions exactly & I agree with the chef that the parm doesn't always melt well.  I had to thin the sauce with a little milk, but it is delicious either way!  Thank you!

This is a good base recipe, I added an extra clove of garlic and I use 1/4 to 1/8 of teaspoon of nutmeg and I squeeze a little lemon in it! It adds a lot more flavor and I think you will be happy with it.

So simple I was able to teach my 12 Y.O. great granddaughter how to make it. I do use two cloves of garlic. (No vampires come to this house. lol). Consistency and flavor are comparable that of our local Italian restaurant.

I thought it was good and easy to make. DON'T use the "parmesan" in the green shaker container. That stuff is grainy and isn't going to melt. The best cheese to use would be actual Parmigiano-Reggiano, but it's pricey. I used the pre-shredded cheese you get in a bag, and added it a little at a time while whisking. Melt it all the way before adding the next bit of cheese. Make sure you whisk the whole time it's on the stove, or it can separate. If you want it thicker you could add a little flour.  I used extra garlic and lots of black pepper for seasoning. Overall a pretty good recipe, but might be a bit too bland for some people.

This was my first time making this,  I added 1 - 8 ounce cream cheese because all I had was 1/2 & 1/2 and 3 cloves fresh minced garlic (we like garlic) and put it over saute chicken, carrots. onion. celery and broccoli    next time I will double or triple the  recipe. My family loved it.

Made this without doing a trial test run before serving it to 8 guests. It was a success! Alike many I made minor changes; added black pepper and a pinch of salt. Lastly swapped fetuccini noodles for ravioli and added butter sautéed mushrooms. Everyone left their plates clean and loved it! Thank you for this AMAZING SIMPLE recipe!

Great base.. I also agree with another reviewer that it's as good as the quality of ingredients.  I tweaked a lil as follows:  I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in the melted butter.  Added a splash of white wine and 1/4 cup of chicken broth before the cheese.  I used 1 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese, 1 cup of shredded Italian cheese mix and 1/4 cup of cream cheese.  Once the cheese was smooth I added a cup of sliced mushrooms.  Added garlic salt, pepper, Italian seasoning to taste.  Garnished with fresh parsley.  Final result was excellent!

Saving this recipe! I followed exactly except for fresh garlic. I was feeling a bit lazy and put a little garlic salt instead.  I did have some parm to grate fresh and I think that is key. I doubt it would be half as good with "saw-dust" parm from the the can.  This is super tasty and rich.  I'm going to serve it with pasta and wilted spinach and some grilled chicken.

I first sauteed the garlic in the butter, then melted them all in a double boiler.  Instead of 1 and a half cups of Parmesan, I used 1/2 cup of Gruyere, and one cup of Parm.  Since I've never had Alfredo sauce before, I wasn't sure what it is supposed to taste like, but this was pretty good!

I followed this letter to the T and it was horrifyingly bad. the butter and cream did not dissolve the parmesan, or lower melting point hard Italian cheeses I put in, so I am thoroughly angry I wanted my good cheese on a horrible recipe.

Very good but would have used half of the amount of garlic, needs about half of the parsley (it was way too much). Just start with that amount of whipping cream and cheese but add more cream if it is too thick or add more cheese if it is too thin. Honestly I almost used two cups of whipping cream in it. But over all very good.

As a husband I do most of the cooking. I love it ! As for most any sauce recipe u come across... u want to throw your own personal taste and touches on. We did just that. Let me say first ... as most Alfredo pastas from restaurants r very heavy! This one is not ! It's nice and light. But again use your own personal preferences to spice or lighten up this sauce. We added extra garlic. Thought the recipe skimped on it. Extra parm which melted amazingly. Ground tyme and crushed red pepper. Extra pepper. Because that's what we like here. It came out amazing. Remember.... when u use someone else's recipe u will need to use your own touch to make it yours ! Throw your own touches on it to your own

Made it exactly as recipe states. It was OK, lacking in flavor.  Consistency was perfect, I didn't have any problems with lumping that other people had. If there is a next time, I would add a bit of salt and some garlic powder.

First time making this (and any) alfredo sauce, turned out GREAT! Used margarine instead of butter and no cheese, still delicious and the thickness was just right.

On par with our favorite Italian restaurant. First time trying was amazing. We did add lots of fresh garlic. More than recommended. I can see adding mushrooms and broccoli or squash. Every over the counter alfredo sauce we have tried has been disappointing but this was fantastic. So easy to season to individual taste. Super easy. Super simple. Super tasty. Makes me question why we never tried this before. We prepared this over chicken and fettuccine and served with garlic bread.

A good, basic recipe. Nothing spectacular, but relatively quick and easy. Great base for customizing.
I threw in some cooked chicken and broccoli, would probably be good with Italian sausage.

I made it and it was Great! To the folks that thought it was bland , I don't know I put 2 cloves of garlic in it and it was a hit. I'm not Italian but Mexican American and we don't go for bland food and this was everything but bland. So I think add  more garlic.

This was fabulous! I subbed a five cheese Italian mix because some said they had trouble melting the parmesan and keeping it creamy. This was smooth and delicious.

So this was my second attempt at making homemade Alfredo, the first was very unsuccessful.  This recipe was easy to follow and it was a quick process.  Apparently Julia Childs was right, its all in the butter.

The reason I like this recipe so much is because its very basic.  I like that I could add almost anything into it to get the flavor I wanted.  So I added seasonings to match the chicken that I was going to be putting in it.  I could just as easily have added lemon to make lemon pepper chicken Alfredo and I like that.

I would like to add that I did cheat and I used Kraft pre-shredded Italian cheese and it worked wonderfully.

I was very short on time and needed a quick and easy alfredo for my fettuccini, so when I found this very basic one I was all over it.  Had all the basic ingredients, but had to use some Italian 4-cheese  shredded along with some grated parmessan.   I also added a small dash of nutmeg to the cheese and garlic before I added those  (nutmeg to me, has always added a little extra flavor to alfredo).  Put this right into my recipe box, in case I might forget the simplicity of it. 
 Great , simple, and basic.  We loved it!.

There are really people that don't like this recipe? Wow. Two words: FRESH Parmesan, NOT the junk you buy in a container. Use the type that you buy in a block, chop it in the food processor. I use whipping cream versus the heavy cream. Pan fry some chicken with flour, paprika, a little salt and pepper. Add the chicken to the sauce and noodles. Bingo!

Liked the garlic flavor in this. I had a problem with sauce being gritty but it's not a recipe issue really it's that I didn't use fresh Parmesan, used shaker kind as I didn't have other on hand. Omitted parsley as I'm not a fan. Added black pepper.

I made this for my SIL birthday. It was good and easy to make. I did feel like it was missing something so I added pepper. The garlic flavor really stood out. I did not add the parsley to the sauce but rather sprinkled it on top. Overall a good recipe.

I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was wonderful.  I will probably reduce the cheese just a bit next time so that it is less thick - taste was out of this world.

I have made this a bunch of times, I love garlic so I add extra!  And watch the parmesean , most of it has so much ground celluose it actually does not taste at all like cheese but more like trees,, For those that said it was bland, it can be sparked up  to suit your taste buds.  it is a basic recipe that can be used using so many different meats and sea food, my favorite is shrimp and scallops,, lots of garlic and butter.. Margerine, not for me.. do your self a favor and use real butter.. you will love it. And you really do not have to use heavy cream either,  using regular Vit  D milk is good and if it needs thickening, just add a bit of flour,, no brainer.

I have made this numerous times and it is great! Even the old cowboys love it.! The ONLY change to recipe that I have done, is do it in a skillet and a higher temp when adding the cheese. It comes out creamy and smooth!

I thought this was quite nice. I browned the garlic a bit before adding the cream. I also only used 2/3 cups Parmesan and about 1/2 cup Gouda. I didn't have fresh parsley so added 1 Tbsp dry to the sauce right after it started to bubble.  I served this with Cajun chicken over the pasta.

This is so easy to make and SO GOOD! We make it with half Parmesan, half gruyere. Definitely a favorite meal at our house. Great served with blackened chicken.

Had to add some salt and pepper. It was a little bland as written. Would still use as a base for future sauces.

This recipe was quick and VERY easy to follow. And luckily I had cream on hand...so that nice. I didn't have to leave anything out beforehand (like cream cheese or butter). And I had grated Parmesan and I just kept mixing and stirring (because at first it look clumpy)...but as I cooked it (medium lo) and stirred it; the clumps melted out. We will definitely make this one again and keep it saved in favorites.

I followed it to a tee, and I was so excited, but it all clumped even though I added the cheese a little at a time. I dont know, it might be user error, but it was clumpy and disappointing. Smelled amazing though. Might try it again

It's pretty good, the consistency can be difficult to achieve if not heated properly. Butter and cream need to be really hot before adding Parmesan cheese or it will not melt properly. I let the cream and butter come to a simmer and then add the Parmesan cheese and continue stirring until smooth. Best to use fresh! This is good as left overs but the sauce will harden when cooled so it is best to pour over noodles and chicken when you store it!

I made this sauce, I find it tasting great. My only problem is however that it is extremely runny there's no thickness to the sauce. I am not sure why I followed the recipe exactly. Five stars for a great tasting sauce.

I love fettuccine alfredo but sadly wasn't getting to eat it for dinner anymore because my family hates alfredo sauce from the jar. I discovered this recipe and now they beg for it! I usually sauté some shrimp to go on top as well. This recipe is super easy and as long as you use freshly grated parmesan (like it says) it turns out perfect every time!

This is a great recipe! I did add more garlic than the recipe called for, and added a bit of salt, but those are fairly minor changes. Overall, I highly recommend!

Love this sauce--so quick and yummy! I do add quite a bit of extra garlic and generally add 1 cup shaved parmesan and 1/2 a cup of cheap, grated parmesan...the full 1 1/2 cups of shaved parmesan creates a bit too intense of a flavor.

my modifications: sauteed the garlic in butter so it becomes fragrant and sweet.  Then added the cream and reduced it a bit before finishing off with parmesan and parsley. I also added lots of freshly ground black pepper.

I made this sauce for my shrimp alfredo and it was loved by all. My boyfriend couldn't stop talking about how good it was! The garlic was subtle but flavorful, and the parsley really gave it a nice fresh taste. The  sauce was a bit thin, but that's nothing a little cornstarch couldn't fix. Overall, this was a great recipe. I'll definitely be making this again.

It was pretty good. I like my usual one I make with cream cheese better, but I didn't feel like cooking and this one looked easy. It was quick, and easy, which I liked. I will probably go back to making the usual one I make.

I used mozzarella and parmesan cheese. I also added fresh ground pepper and a tablespoon of flour.  I sauteed portabella mushrooms to make it a meat-less meal. Served over fresh fettuccine noodles and garnished with parsley!! Perfecto!!

I love this recipe - it really hits the spot when I'm craving pasta with alfredo sauce.  I follow it exactly but add a small pinch of nutmeg, and it elevates it from great to excellent! I used to be a server at a high-end restaurant in college, and they used to add nutmeg to their alfredo which was oh-so-good! If you haven't tried nutmeg in this, give it a try - just remember to add a small amount!

I have made this several times and it turned out really good! I didn't use heavy cream, I used 2% milk and a teaspoon of flour to thicken the sauce. Also the parmesan cheese didn't melt very well so I would have parmesan cheese chunks I'm the sauce with is perfectly fine with me. if you want a smoother sauce I would suggest using different type of cheese as parmesan typically does not melt. overall very easy to make and this is now in my regular cooking!

Alfredo is one of my favorite foods to eat. I liked it because it went great with the pasta olives and parmesan cheese.  It was awesome because of this sauce.  There are 2 places that I eat alfredo; a restuarant called olive garden and at my house (with this recipe).  It is amazing.  It tastes good with orange juice.  Thank you.

Simple, fresh and delicious!  I used Kerry Gold butter, Trader Joe's Shredded Swiss & Gruyere, organic half & half, and basil.  Then I served it over TJ's Lemon Pepper Pappardelle.  The family inhaled it!  ;)

Very easy.  I will make it again.  It does get quite thick.  Tonight I made it in a large pan that I had just cooked fettucine in.  Then I added the pasta, some pre-cooked chicken , bacon and peas for some wonderful, homemade chicken carbonera!

Pretty tasty! Mine came out SUPER thick, I think it's because I let it simmer a couple extra minutes or not long enough. It paired nicely with my chicken and pasta

It had a very nice tasting flavor, but it was too thick and sticky. It might have been the Parmesan, but I'm not sure. Over all I am very pleased with the outcome of this. The flavor was delicious, but the sauce could be less thick.

Great tasting, easy recipe. I only used half the cream before adding the Parmesan (so it melts easier and becomes smoother), then added the remaining after. I've also tried this with some spinach and it is delicious!

Used this recipe to make spring vegetable fettuccini alfredo for dinner. I took the advice from others and doubled the call for garlic. I used dried parsley since I was out of fresh, and I added some fresh cracked pepper too. Sautéed asparagus, onion, red bell pepper and mushrooms. Great flavor- my boyfriend LOVED it- we both had two helpings and were extremely satisfied.

Parmesan melts well, but you have to remove it promptly from the stove once heated through. Leaving it on the stove for longer than needed to melt it will cause it to separate from the cream. Anyway, great recipe. I have made it 100 times at least. A family favorite.

Taste was five, texture was three.  I followed all the suggestions: fresh Parmesan, low and slow, but I still had a distinct grandular feel.  As a side note, I added more garlic than the recipe called for.  I'd make it again based on taste but the texture was off putting.

This was fantastic and so easy!  The sauce is rich and creamy, the other reviews were right when they said it tastes like an alfredo sauce you would order at a restaurant. It can take a while for the butter and heavy cream mixture to simmer, but be patient! I read some reviews that the cheese made the sauce grainy, but it melted perfectly in mine (I used bagged, shredded parmesan). I think the key is the slow simmer. It's so delicious and simple  that I already know I'll be making this again for friends and family!

Best alfredo sauce I've ever tasted and so simple!  First time I've ever made this myself and it beats the store bought stuff hands down!  So much flavor  but not too salty tasting.  I used half and half and grated my own parmesean.  This is a keeper!

Very, very good. The key is to buy a block of aged Parmesan and  grate it yourself. Let it get to room temperature before trying to melt it into the sauce. Definitely want to add an extra clove or two of garlic and maybe some black pepper. Also, cook the garlic with the butter for a couple of minutes before adding the cream. All in all a very good sauce.

Super easy recipe for anyone that is making it for the first time (myself) and also if you're looking for something quick. I like food on the saltier side, but for those of you who don't, dont use salted butter! The cheese itself should add enough saltiness, if you use salted butter it will probably take it over the top.

I love this! I didn't have any heavy cream so I substituted 18% table cream & 2% milk (equal portions). I also used 2 cloves of garlic.  My 3 very picky kids loved it.  This will become a midweek meal staple in our house.

Delicious ! Double up for a pound of fettuccine.  I added a package of cubed prosciutto to the melting butter, do double the garlic. Bacon or pancetta good too.  A little flour thickens it up as necessary depending on how much and what kind of cheese you use.  I used hard grated parmigiano reggiano and some left over asiago.  When you drain your pasta, pour half of the sauce in the bottom of the pasta pot, dump in the pasta, put the rest of the sauce on top and toss with tongs.

Very good sauce but you don't need 1 1/2 cups of Parmesan - it makes it a little too cheesy

I think there might be a problem with the ratio of cheese to heavy cream as written. I scrolled through some reviews and noticed others had similar problems. I used a bag of shredded parmesan from the grocery store which is equivalent to 1.5 cups. This was way too much cheese, and it essentially turned my sauce into a stringy thick glob. I had to add at least double the amount of heavy cream in order to get it back into liquid form.

best review right herrrrrr. first review ever I mean i ever did. this is what you can do to make this recipe even better.
after melting butter saute garlic in it then add heaving shipping cream/ cream chesse/ or milk with a little starch or non. (adjust garlic to your tasting more is always better in the sense of garlic). cheeses to add this can range. I suggest mild cheddar or Sharp, asiago, parmesan and a combination of these won't hurt and makes all thr better. any veggie goes exceptionally well. (as I am vegetarian) ones to use are sliced mushrooms and tomatoes  (which are a fruit technically speaking). also the grand finales, add fresh spinach at the end., I mean the end don't cook it unless you want to, i perfer it fresh. salt and pepper add a great deal to this recipes, even making it or breaking it. thanks hope you like the review

Wonderful!! This was so easy!  Very similar to Olive Garden! I skipped the fresh parsley just bec I didn't have any, so I used a small amount of dried parsley. Key is to continue to stir it. It does thicken after about 15 min. U might thinks it's runny but it will thicken perfectly. I doubled the recipe (fed 7 with 2nd and extra) and used SHREDDED parmesan, it melted perfect. I added it slowly to ensure it melted. Everyone Love this! Quick & Simple!

Very easy to make. I used milk instead of cream, and  I added a tablespoon of flour to the melted butter, and let that cook for about a minute before adding the milk -- this helped keep the cheese from getting gluey. I also added a little ground pepper and nutmeg.

Hard to get much easier than this! I doubled the recipe, worried that it might not be enough, and I'm happy now to have extra! I even used the cheese from the tall green can, and it worked great.

This was good but I could not get the texture to smooth out, so it was kinda grainy tasting due to the Parmesan cheese. If someone could explain on how to get it smooth it might be perfect

This was absolutely delicious! It was easy to make, but my arm hurt from all the whisking! But it was worth it! The only change I made was using half & half rather than heavy cream. I was surprised there were leftovers, but it warmed beautifully. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing !

Easy and tasty.  I made with Gruyere (which I don't think I like), but I had on hand from another recipie.  Would use fresh parm and extra garlic next time.

This was a very easy recipe, ideal for busy families during the week. The only thing I would do differently is to use unsalted butter. Other than that, it was excellent!

VERY GOOD!  I made this recipe to have with our spaghetti tonight.   My only change was to use garlic powder as I was out of fresh garlic.  This was so easy and surprisingly quick to make.  I will be making it again.  Thank you, Rebecca Swift, for sharing!

I made a traditional roux with 1/4 c butter and flour. Then added milk and a bunch of shredded/grated cheeses along with 1 c. chicken broth. Delicious even though it deviates from the heavy cream. YUMMY

So quick and so easy. My 12 year old made it the first time she tried cooking by herself.  The one thing we did do is we mixed the Gruyere cheese with some Parmesan cheese to add flavor.  We did 1 cup of Gruyere and the other 1/2 cup with Parmesan. It is also good left over too. If you just heat it up in a microwave it tastes great!

The flavor was good - but the sauce was a little lumpy.  I think the instructions should specify the  smallest grating possible.
I'll also try a splash of lemon juice next time.

I made this twice now, and love it...the first time I used shredded parmesan and the 2nd time I used gruyere that I shredded.  They were both really good, but the gruyere won!  I was so rich and flavorful.  I made the recipe exactly as stated, consistency was perfect.  When the sauce was done in the skillet, I put in a pound of shrimp - cooked that for about 3 minutes and served over linguine.  Beautiful meal, not many ingredients, and very easy!  Will always use this for my alfredo dishes.

Easy and delicious, I used parm and was nervous it wouldn't melt. It turned out perfectly, I even added more Parmesan. For me it thickened  up a  once it cooled a little bit  and the taste was delicious! No more store-bought Alfredo for us

It is my go-to Alfredo recipe.  Wish I could get the parmesan cheese smooth and I add more cream to make the sauce a little thinner. For a rich creamy sauce, this is it! Great for adding to. In photo, I made my version of Shrimp Palermo with shrimp,  ground sausage,  fresh peas, steamed broccoli and fresh spinach.  Very yummy.

What I like about this recipe is its simplicity which gives it diversity. Makes a great base Alfredo to either let stand alone tossed with Fettuccine or amped  up as required. I used this as a base for Pulled Chicken Alfredo Stuffed Lasagna. Worked just fine.
Overall,  It is only bland if you don't season to taste.....and you don't need to spend 3 years in Italy to figure that out.....Ciao

Freshly-grated parmegiana reggiano, just a cup is plenty. 3 cloves of garlic. Whisk, whisk, whisk. Tossed fettuccine noodles in the sauce pot then plated that with brined & marinated grilled chicken breast strips on top. Plus Caesar salad. To die for.

I happen to have a horrible habit of making food when I have insomnia (works out for lunches the following day though).

I made a bit more of the sauce because it's a habit (recipes sometimes don't offer enough sauce, in my opinion).

We were low on cream so I added milk to make up for it and I don't think it made the sauce less rich. Another tip I've used for replacing cream is to use condensed milk.

Wonderful recipe! A keeper for certain!

I will definitely make this again.  I just happened to have some cream I thought I'd use up and this fit the bill.  It was late in the evening so I substituted dry for the fresh.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I substituted 1 TBS of dry parsley.  Instead of fresh garlic I used 1/4 TSP of garlic powder.  I only had parmesan reggiano so I used that instead of parmesan.  Other than that, it came out fantastic for a last minute throw together sauce.  I'd definitely use this recipe again but I might try milk (only because this was so rich) to see how that works.  Better tasting than any restaurant Alfredo sauce I've had.

This was a super easy recipe, and so good!  I used Sargento shredded Parmesan cheese and unsalted butter...I didn't have  heavy cream on hand so I used half and half...I tossed it with a jar of artichoke hearts, angel hair pasta and sliced up a  package of roasted red pepper and Asiago chicken sausage...so good!  A perfect quick, midweek recipe.

I doubled the garlic and parm. Grated the parm right before I needed it. Added broccoli and rotisserie chicken. Topped with parm, also. The sauce is too thin without the extra cheese.

I was craving Olive Gardens Alfredo and found this recipe.  I followed it as best as I could and had to use a  blended cheese, Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago and it was delicious.  It was too much for just myself so I froze the leftover pasta/sauce.  I also added lemon pepper chicken to the pasta.  I will make this again!

Great recipe, and I was able to cut the fat by using half and half, only 1 cup of cheese (when pared down for 4 servings) and it was more than enough. I also simmered the garlic in the butter so the flavor would infuse the butter. For personal preference, I thickened the sauce with 2 Tbs of a cornstarch milk slurry. I want to try this with Swiss cheese, instead of the Parmesan, too. Served over store-bought mushroom ravioli. Was a very romantic dinner with little effort. Keeper recipe.

This was very good...to the people who say this was bland and not authentic Alfredo sauce- authentic Alfredo is butter, Parmesan and pasta...there is nothing spicy about it.

It is super thick. THe amounts are weird. THe parmesan and parsley were way too much. The taste is ok at best. I won't make this one again. I have not any problems with any other recipe on this site like this one.

Tasted really good. Couldn't get the parmesan cheese to melt completely, though, so the texture, when removed from heat, became like sludge--okay for me, but I wouldn't want to serve it to others, just because of that. I would make it again, but I'd use a different cheese.

Definitely will make this again and again. The butter I used was salted. You could probably use unsalted and it would still taste great. I also used two cloves of garlic and for the Parmesan I used half grated and half shredded. I tossed it with tortellini. Delicious! It was a hit with the whole family. The creamy consistency was perfect.

The first time I made it it was way too rich for me. The second time I used soymilk instead of heavy cream, half a teaspoon of crushed garlic, and 1.5 cups of parmesan. It was amazing and I would definitely make it again. My sisters liked it too! I never knew it was so easy to make all this time! Great recipe

I made this with what I had left in my house. I had no parsley but I added pepper for a bit of flavor and it tasted great! The Parmesan didn't melt all the way yet it gave the alfredo a nice texture. 10/10

First time making alfredo like this. Wish it had been mentioned that you should add the Parmesan to a butter/cream mixture that isn't too hot. It wouldn't mix, it just melted into a large ball of cheese. So I did some research, took the ball of cheese out and let it cool and added the extra cheese I had left. It blended a little better but still too loose and clumpy. Now I have to figure out what's for dinner. What a waste!

My first attempt at alfredo sauce. I added salt, black pepper, and white pepper to taste. I substituted a blend of Swiss and gruerere for the Parmesan....it melts better. Then I sprinkled Parmesan on top. Very nice...mild, quick sauce.

This saved my ziti garlic and broccoli dish! It is no longer dry and boring, now it is lusciously delicious! I used a four cheese shredded mix ( Parmesan, fontina, Asiago and provolone) It melted beautifully. I didn't know Alfredo sauce was so easy! I will have to force myself to not make it too often since it is so rich and sumptuous. A wonderful treat!

Loved it! The only revision I made to the recipe was substituting heavy cream for whole milk, and a dollop of plain Greek yogurt to thicken a little. Perfectly rich and savory!

Very VERY good sauce. I doubled the batch as I made a whole box of noodles. When making the sauce I poured in a quarter cup of shredded paremansean at a time and wisked it til it melted. Doing it slowly like that helped thicken the sauce. I also added chicken and broccoli. Very yummy and will be making this again.

Made a double batch, good thing because my wife and I love Alfredo, and it was delicious! Used everything just as the recipe called for and turned out great! Served it over home-made Gnocchi for dinner. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I've never made a cream sauce without flour, and I was skeptical. I was also concerned that it would be plain. WRONG. This was so easy, and restaurant-quality.  I no longer need to consult any other Alfredo sauce recipe.

Be careful when adding in the cheese mine didn't melt right and had chunks of cheese, but still was good! I sauté some green onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms to give it a more earthy taste!!! Paired it with some rosemary garlic Italian bread and my favorite wine and it was all gone before I knew it!! Great recipe for anyone beginners to the top chiefs! Despite my mishap it still turned out incredible!!

I made some adjustments. I used 4 cups of heavy cream. 2 cups of butter, and 2 cups of Parmesan cheese.  I also used garlic and basil.

After making this three times, I finally nailed it.Key is to use unsalted butter and freshly grate your own cheese.
The two times before it did come out good but was salty and lumpy from using salted butter and pre-packaged  grated cheese.The Anti caking agent they use to stop the shreds from sticking made the sauce lumpy.Will definitely  make again now that I got it right!

I've made this twice, I always add 3 times the garlic that a recipe calls for as we love garlic in our house.  The first time I followed the recipe and it was way too rich.  This time, I use half heavy cream and other half was half and half.  It's better to me and not as rich.

This recipe is delicious although it doesn't reheat well. If you use REAL parmesan cheese it melts just fine. Not the stuff in a plastic jar. I use a mix of parm reggiano and pecorino. Grate your own and you should love this!

This was my first time making sauce myself, so I was pleased with the simplicity of this recipe. My 6 year old daughter and husband loved it, and both are picky eaters. My daughter hardly ever eats anything I make, but tonight she was asking for seconds and commenting on how good it was the entire way through dinner. However, the recipe definitely required some tweaking for my taste. I love garlic, and I do not enjoy bland food at all. I cannot enjoy store bought Alfredo sauce. I feel I have tried them all, and I've never been satisfied. Instead of 1 clove of garlic, I added about 10-15 cloves plus a little bit of garlic powder. Some people may find that to be excessive, but I have grown up eating very spicy, very flavorful foods, so for my family it was just right.  I also added some salt and pepper. Like the other reviews say, the parmesan cheese does not seem to melt well. However, what I found is that once you mix it in with the fettuccine, that makes no difference. I have to say that it tastes better than it looks in the pot once you add the pasta. When I tasted it directly from the pot, I wasn't sure what I thought of it. Once I mixed the pasta in with it, I found myself making seconds. The consistency was great as well, very creamy. I recommend it, but I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it needed to be tweaked.

I found this recipe while browsing on my phone in the store when I refused to pay $6 for the tiny ready made store-bought one.  I was not disappointed!  This was rich and creamy and tasted just perfect.  The only thing I did differently was to use two cloves of garlic instead of one because we love garlic.

I've made this recipe a billion times; absolutely perfect and better than what I've found in most  restaurants! And easy/fast!!  I would rather make this than take a chance on a restaurant making it right !
Great on noodles of course but especially good on zucchini "ribbon noodles" and added sautéed chicken for a gluten free option.
My picky teenager loves this every time I make it. And that's saying something.

I found that it serves really well as a base. I added mushrooms and a little oregano, and the result was very good. I'll be doing it again many times for sure.

I try to stay away from Alfredo sauces. So when my wife suggested I use this recipe for a late garden harvest stir fry of egg plant, bell pepper and some pineapple sausage, I sighed and replied "ok".  Wow!  She took one bite and said, with a look I hadn't seen in a few decades "This is good!".  Try this recipe when your young.

I followed the directions almost perfectly (I only had half and half so had to use some baking soda to thicken), doubled it, and the kids all complained it tasted bitter. Can anyone tell me why and what I can do to make it better? Thank you.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for. A basic (full fat) Alfredo sauce. I haven't made it for years and needed to begin again. I know how to add various herbs and spices I love, but it was the basic sauce recipe I truly needed. Not that the sauce isn't lovely as it is. Merely subtle.  
This is an excellent recipe!

This recipe is so great. Looking at the reviews I decided to try it with Kraft's pre-grated parmesan in the green bottle and it was definitely way too grainy. The next day I bought fresh parmesan and grated it myself ... SO delicious and it smells great. Don't use any short cuts with Kraft's parmesan! Never buying alfredo sauce again. Tip: Don't rush when whisking the cheese in. If you whisk long enough the cheese will melt and it'll be creamy and less oozy.

I made this for some friends that were coming over and it turned out great. I made it exactly as directed in the recipe. I did double the recipe because we like extra sauce and wanted it for any left overs. After melting the butter I never stopped whisking until the sauce was completed. I cooked it just a tad under medium heat. This was very easy to make and it turned out better than any major restaurants that I ever tried. Try it and you won't be disappointed.

I made this exactly as per the recipe.  My sons love the Olive Garden Fettuccine Alfredo and this did not disappoint.  It is so close to the Olive Garden both of my boys are asking for it frequently now.  This is the best Alfredo recipe I have ever found.

Delicious. My husband and I loved it! I agree that the parmesan cheese doesn't melt smoothly. But, if you add it in slowly in small amounts and don't allow your pot to boil or even simmer for too long it's still pretty smooth. Plus the tiny pieces of parmesan that were left added more flavor to each bite! This reminded me of restaurant quality alfredo. If you're making a whole box of fettuccine you'll probably want to at least double the recipe.

This was really good. I found that if you put the sauce in a blender on puree it will make the sauce smooth with the parmesan cheese added. I also found that adding a little milk will thin out the sauce.

This was delicious! I made chicken Alfredo with this sauce and it was a hit! I didn't read the directions (oops!) and just threw everything in together and it still turned out delicious! I used shredded parmesan and grated Parmesan cheese and munched garlic instead of a clove and I didn't have parsley. I doubled the recipe because we like a LOT of sauce on our pasta!  After it started thickening I threw it in the pan with the pasta and chicken and let is soak in to the pasta a bit and thicken up even more! We will be making this again!

Excellent! I had the canned stuff ready to go but I was making a large amount of chicken fettuccine alfredo and didn't know if I would have enough sauce. I had some heavy whipping cream in my fridge that I needed to use so I decided to give this recipe a try. I'm so glad that I did! It was really yummy and I didn't even use any of the canned stuff... nor will I again! This was too easy and delicious not to make my own each time. Thanks for a great recipe!

I doubled this recipe to throw on some ready made ravioli. Added some sage and fresh basil into the sauce mix. Used 1 cup half n half and 1 cup of chicken broth instead of heavy cream and threw in some mushrooms, fresh spinach, and cherry tomatoes because why not? It was yum!

I thought this was a great basis for Alfredo. I quadrupled the recipe for a big family. I sautéed a bulb of garlic, peeled & minced in the butter. Also I added a little fresh black pepper & salt to the sauce. So much more savory.

The changes I will make is once, I stirred in my fettucine noodles and the sauce begin to thick.  Next time I will add some olive oil. To Keep the cheese from becoming thick over time before serving. 

Family had agreat time, they enjoyed but the next time I'll come prepared and ready to burn the kitchen.

I made this sauce, but I used coconut milk since I can't have cow's milk. I can have organic, grass fed butter, so I used that. I added a tablespoon of crushed garlic, salt and pepper to taste, and dried instead of fresh herbs. :) Absolutely delicious. My husband asked who made this, with a funny look on his face. I asked why, and he said it was to die for. I then told him I made it from scratch. Lol

My husband wanted something with fettuccini noodles, so I made this.  I added chopped, cooked chicken breast and heated it through before mixing with the fettuccini.  It was ok, but the sauce was thin and I will change that before I make it again.  I also added more garlic but it was still bland.

It was way too cheesy and not creamy at all. I will make it again with half the Parm next time and add some salt, pepper, and garlic powder to bring more of the garlic flavor out.

Very simple to make and very good. I added a little bit more cream than the recipe calls for (on accident however) but it turned out amazing nonetheless. I was scared at first of the consistency of the sauce but you really need to whisk it in order to get it just right

The best alfredo I have ever had! Very easy to make. The parmesan is slow to melt, and I added some mozzarella, A little thin at first, but thickens if you let it set for a couple minutes! Very tasty!

Made exactly as stated in the recipe and was very happy with the end result. It made a very tasty chicken Alfredo. I had some leftover chicken in the fridge and cooked up some fresh pasta. It was very quick to throw together.

The recipe was very easy and my family loved it! My kids are big fans of "white sauce" from a jar, but I'm not, so I thought I'd try making my own. I was nervous if they would like a homemade version if their palates were accustomed to the jar, but they gave it high praises all around! I did add one extra clove of garlic, because we enjoy garlic, but overall, I'm happy with this recipe!

It taste good, but I was expecting the sauce to be thicker. It was watery so I added shredded mozzerella cheese to thicken it.

It was super quick and easy to make I did add some salt and pepper to the melted butter and a bit more garlic because I love garlic ! It made it so flavourful and I added a bit of basil instead of parsley because I didn't have any and I also substituted 18% table cream instead of the heavy cream its just what I had in the fridge. It turned out really good!

It was way too thick so I added more cream and milk. I also added broccoli and chicken and put this over fresh pasta noodles and sprinkles of bacon.

So I bastardized this recipe for lack of ingredients and health, but for all intents and purposes I started with this. 
Used half and half instead of heavy cream.
Added the parsley (dried), and salt and pepper to the half and half before adding to the butter.
Used 1/3 mozzarella, 2/3 parmesan.
Over fettuccine with ground beef and broccoli.
Came out amazing.

Great flavor but couldn't get the Parmesan to melt correctly. Maybe user error. Will make again with different cheese.

I have made this recipe twice, once using the parmasean, and the second time using gruyere,  and it is delicious both ways, but far smoother with gruyere.  If you are not used to working with gruyere, which I was not, it can be a little smelly during the cooking, but the end result was scrumptious!

Perfect!  I used 1/2 & 1/2 and added a1 tbs sherry at the end along with pepper, but that's just because it's what we like.  I'll use this recipe again.

This had an amazing flavour and was super easy to make and my family loved it. I made a couple of changes - used 10% cream, added another clove of garlic, and used half Parmesan and half grated Gruyere and consistency was right. Will definitely make again!

Made this tonight for dinner and while the flavor was ok, the texture was terrible.  The parmesan cheese never fully melted and the mixture simply didn't blend up like it ought to have.\ I followed the recipe as it was written with no substitutions or changes.

Delicious. I added another clove of minced garlic as well as a pinch of flour and a pinch of italian seasoning to thicken it up a bit and give it a bit of flavor. I also added another quarter cup of Parmesan because...well, we're cheese people. Haha. But, other than that, the recipe is perfecto!

Also, it couples great with sautéed spinach and tomatoes! I threw them into the sauce and it was a hit!

Really yummy and delicious. It really matters on the quality of the cheese you use, so DON'T BUY REALLY CHEAP  CHEESE! Or you're gonna get a cheap flavor. I added some broccoli and shrimp, and seasoned with pepper and salt on each plate.

this is a good base recipe, that's easy to elaborate on if you want to jazz it up.  i simmer (and triple the amt of) the garlic in the butter for a few minutes before adding the cream and cheese.  for basic alfredo, i also add a couple dashes nutmeg, and white pepper.

Wonderful recipe. I followed the advise of another reviewer and  I gently whisk the cream and butter the entire time it's simmering and whisk while adding the cheese (a little at a time) . Turned out great. Also, it doesn't need any salt. The cheese brings enough.

My wife has made this a dozen times, each time she changes it up a bit. The best is so far is with gruyere, mild, sharp, and shredded parmesan. The whole family loves it.

Nice easy recipe that has great taste. Second time I made it I replace half the cream with buttermilk and used about a teaspoon of corn starch as a thickener. Throw in some sautéed shrimp and diced greens, put it over some pasta and you have an easy dinner.

This is my go to Alfredo sauce...it is amazing & better than most restaurants!  Rich, creamy, savory....my family always begs for seconds!  The only thing I can add is that I use 2-3 cloves of garlic (love fresh garlic).  I always use the pasta water to mix with the heavy cream.  Also cook the pasta

We liked this but I had trouble getting the Parmesan cheese to melt. Yes, I grated the real thing in my food processor just like a famous TV chef does. I grabbed the wrong butter and used the salted instead of the unsalted. It didn't ruin it but it was on the edge before I added the broccoli. I'll make this again and again. We could take or leave the garlic depending on what is being served with it. We are ready to have Shrimp and Spinach Alfredo over pasta.

The only thing I would suggest is to use a really high quality cheese. The better cheese you use the better sauce you get. I love this recipe. It's my go to for Alfredo sauce. Sometimes I add mushrooms or peppers. Sometimes I don't!

Will make it again! I love how easy and quick this recipe is. It's more than good starter recipe for novice cooks. I added different spices that we love and took some reviewers advice on stirring. I was satisfied with the thickness. I gave it 4 stars because my husband made a recipe of Alfredo that i am still drooling over and its so hard not to compare

Very tasty.  I use garlic flakes if I don't have fresh garlic on hand.  I alsoI add a pinch of nutmeg and also add a little romano cheese.  I use half romano and half parmesan.

This is my go-to  Alfredo sauce recipe. I always use Parmesan that I grate myself. I think when people complain about recipes that call for grated cheese they are using cheese from the store that is already grated and contains an additive (like wood pulp) that changes the way the recipe turns out. The recipe will only be as good as the ingredients you put in it, folks.

I never have cream. I feel it's too fattening. So I just used milk and some corn starch to thicken it. It was really yummy. I surprise my family with the random recipes I make and they loved the Alfredo.

I used homo milk instead of heavy cream, herb and garlic cheese instead of parmesan, margarine instead of butter and added a few more cloves of garlic. Plus a tiny bit of roux just because i like my sauces a little thicker.  Topped w/ fresh ground pepper and it was  yummmyyy :)

I find this to be a good base I used a blend of pepper jack and Parmesan cheese and for the liquid I did a mix of half and half, white wine, lemon juice. Had the cheese and liquid in a bowl with pepper and garlic until ready for mix in. Used  Half the butter and onions which also seems to do the trick

Great base for this sauce. To take it to the next level is mostly in the preparation.  Olive oil in a hot pan, chopped garlic in the hot oil, simmer until just browning and add your protein, I used chicken. Season with salt, pepper and thyme. Cook until golden, then reduce to medium low heat and add the butter.  I used a mix of Havarti and guda cheese as I only had powdered parm in the house, which is not an appropriate substitute for Alfredo. Once the cheese is melting add your cream and reduce heat a bit and let the flavors meld.

This was a great base Alfredo sauce.    I used shredded parmesan and added Broccoli and cooked chicken with spices.    It all turned out great once completed.     I gave four stars because I added my own twist.

I found out that a whole clove of garlic is the whole bulb so I definitely taste really good from me trying this even with some people putting one star.  I think it depends on what ingredients you use.  Thanks soo much.  LOVE LOVE this.  :D

I’ve made this tons of times the way it says & it’s awesome. I’ve also tweaked it occasionally by adding a little cream cheese, a few drops of lemon juice, added broccoli & chicken... it’s very customizable. Nom, nom, nom...

The sauce has got a good consistency to it overall, though the strength of the Parmesan did lead me to adding a cap or two worth of white wine to mild it down for my roommate. This is defiantly a recipe that will remain one of my favorite sauces, though I'll probably experiment and see how to thicken it up a bit for gnocchi.

I didn't have fresh parsley. so I used dried from my garden last year.  I also made 1.5 times the recipe since we had a good amount of fettuccine.  It was delicious!  Everyone loved it and it's so nice that I have some left over for lunch tomorrow.

I love this recipe as a good base. I actually tripled this. I used shredded Parmesan and shredded Gruyere, six cloves of garlic, salt and 1 tbsp fresh ground pepper and 4 green onions, it came out banging. I put the garlic salt and pepper and green onion and some of the parsley in with the butter and the garlic so they married together. I used 3 cups of heavy cream over low heat and added the cheese slowly, it worked beautifully.

Love this sauce. I have made several times now. I use half Gruyere, half fresh Parmesan, I also add just a tad more garlic. Serve with chicken and broccoli, over fettuccine....yum! One of my favorite dishes and I get compliments all the time.

Great recipe! I doubled the recipe and as I did I made a few changes. The first change that I made was that instead of using one clove of garlic I baked a whole head of garlic and put the baked garlic into the sauce, baked garlic tends to be a little mushy so it blends right in. The second change that I made was that I used half Parmesan and half Gruyere cheese.  With these and a little bit of cornstarch to thicken this made a phenomenal sauce! We had  shrimp fettuccine Alfredo and it was delicious!

It was good! It's better if you add more garlic to the mix, I found anyway.

Comes out delicious. I personally thinks it needs more heavy cream so that it's creamier. Yum

I may try unsalted butter and I used parsley flakes. I melted butter, simmered garlic and parsley for a while, added parmesan and heated it to brake down the pieces to create a "sandy" texture. Heat cream before you add the cream to sauce. It turned out awesome. I'm awesome. This recipe is awesome.

I did use reduced fat cream cheese instead of regular.  For having such rich ingredients the outcome was totally unappetizing. Tasted way too much like cream cheese.

A simple quick and easy way to prepare a cheesy sauce for the kids. I followed the recipe as described though I used a cooking cream (which holds against the heat better) instead of heavy cream. I did not have parmesan cheese so I used medium sharp cheddar and a few slices of processed american cheese. Took less than 15mins to prepare. Sauce was wonderfully creamy and worked perfect for a quick mac and cheese dish. Will do again

It's easy, it's tasty, it's fast to make. I used about a teaspoon of powdered garlic and half a teaspoon of dried oregano for seasoning instead of the fresh garlic. I've served it over noodles with chicken or shrimp and also added steamed veggies on the side that blend nicely with the creamy sauce. My family likes it, will make again!

Yum! I made as posted but it was too thick for us. So added another 2 Tablespoons of butter and 1/2 cup of milk.  Just make sure you are patient as the cheese melts. It will be smooth and creamy.

OMG! So amazing, and easy. I'm only 12 years old and it was better than any restaurant I could think of! And it is cheaper than all restaurants! Thanks so much I enjoyed this SO MUCH! Also it is better with Heavy WHIPPING Cream than just Heavy Cream, or at least I thought that. Again thanks so much!

I would make this again in a heart beat. I added barely a pinch of nutmeg and the juice of half a lemon. Grating the parm and adding the heavy cream gradually as you stir it in helps to create a creamy sauce.

Phenomenal alfredo sauce! I made this for an event and X8 the recipe. I only had 3 c. of parmesan cheese and left out the parsley. It was perfect! Good to know that you can use 1/4 of the cheese, and it still tastes great!

Loved this! Made it is written except with freshly grated parm an some freshly cracked black pepper and it is fantastic! I saw a couple people say this isn't authentic and bland...well they obviously don't understand that "real" Alfredo sauce is a bit bland (it's just  cream, butter and some parmesan, yes?). Thank you for the recipe!

Yum! How can you go wrong with butter, cream and cheese?! I found the finer the cheese is grated, the easier it is to melt and blend.  Certainly not an everyday meal but a nice treat and great for company, quick and easy yet everyone is so impressed that you made it!

This was an excellent recipe! The best I have found. I had to adjust the recipe because of what I had on hand. I doubled the recipe and used half heavy whipping cream and half 2% milk. I also used half Parmesan and half shredded mozzarella and substituted the garlic powder for fresh garlic. The family loved it and it thickened perfectly!!!

Way too much Parmesan.  As I was pouring it in, I stopped and only used 1/2 a cup.  It still ended up tasting like straight melted Parmesan.

I love this recipe! I've tried several other homemade Alfredo sauces and they all turned out gritty or tasteless.  This is a home-run recipe!! Everyone loved it.  It's our new favorite & don't have to go out to eat and spend a bundle for a nice Italian dish.

After reading many of the reviews, I took their advise on a few of the changes. I used Gruyere and Parmesan 50/50. I bought it in wedges and grated it with the food processor. I heated the butter and half and half (not heavy cream) and then slowly added the grated cheeses until it was just a little looser than I wanted for the finished product. It will continue to thicken slightly as time goes on. I whisked almost continuously and had no problem with it separating later. I also used cilantro and Italian parsley 50/50. I doubled the recipe and used it the next day as a spread for garlic bread (wow, awesome). I made home made fettuccine sautéed shrimp in butter and served. My wife doesn't care much for Alfredo and isn't easy to give compliments, but she said it was the best pasta dish she had ever had. I was thinking the same thing but thought it was just me. Thanks for a great recipe and for all the great ideas on how to make it better.

Can't get much simpler/better than this! Might be able to throw an extra garlic clove in, but this is a great baseline for alfredo sauce!

I thought this recipe was pretty good. Not a ton of flavor but the texture is prefect. I used gruyere instead of parmesan. Very nice if you serve it alongside a spiced meat. We had it with tri tip but would be great with shrimp as well

This is our go to Alfredo sauce. We do add a dash of nutmeg and 1 tablespoon of corn starch with water to give a little flavor and thickness.

This is not a bad recipe, but if you want a bit of variety, loose the parsley and add white wine along with salt and white pepper to taste.

I substituted some of the Parmesan for Asiago cheese and it turned out great!

I also added thyme, rosemary, and mushrooms that were sauteed in a little butter and white wine vinegar.  It was delicious!

Delicious--but there's a whole lotta Parmesan. Next time, I'll cut it by a quarter and up the garlic a tad. Otherwise, this went really well with whole-wheat noodles, bell peppers, mushrooms, and broccoli.

My girlfriend and I are both are good cooks and we tried the reciepe. We did as a team. I read to her what to do and she did it. It started getting pastie when we added the cheese.  We added  more  heavy cream and a little water . Finally after a few minutes the cheese started to melt. We added the shrimp and it was better than what you would get at a restraurant  . I would agree that next time we will use fresh Parmesan Cheese.   Love it!

I make this recipe a few times a month. It quickly became a family favorite. Super easy and always delicious! I love it with fresh parsley, but it isn't always available so it's optional. I also add more garlic and freshly cracked black pepper. Love it!

I used real, unsalted butter.  Shredded Parmesan in a tub.  2 cloves of fresh, organic, homegrown garlic, and let them cook in the butter for a few minutes.  I used half and half, cuz that is what I had. I slowly added the parm, whisking the entire time.   It was sooo yummy. I had never made Alfredo before. I will definitely be making this again.  
PSA:  Everyone should grow their own garlic. There are hundreds of varieties, mild to spicy hot.  Very easy to grow!!  Different varieties for different climates.   You can't beat fresh juicy garlic. It is night and day to store bought.

Very good! Was pretty salty even though I used unsalted butter and didn't add any additional salt, but not overwhelming.  Kind of had a granular texture, maybe the cheese didn't melt completely. I used parmesan grated right off the block, actually didn't measure but used the entire triangle. Very close to restaurant Alfredo, and much better than a jar!

Delicious! Sauteed the garlic in the butter first. Made it with the cheapy grated parmesan cheese and it was REALLY good but I should've used just about 1 C  instead of 1 1/2C since it is so densely packed. Still delicious! A keeper!

This is a good recipe. I did add a little salt and pepper to taste.  I grated fresh Parmesan cheese and had hope it would melt and blend into the sauce but it did not,  so I put the sauce in the blender and  while is was not silky smooth the consistency was much improved. Next time I will try it with gruere cheese as the op and others have suggested.

Teenager loved it. It was quick and easy! I added more garlic than it called for. This  tastes way better than the jarred version. I will make this again and again and won't ever go back to buying it.

Really simple and really tasty! The key to this sauce is once the cheese is added, you must stir constantly until melted and thickened and serve immediately. You cannot warm this on the stove, nor keep cooking it once its melted,  or; it will get grainy. I added sauteed spinach and portabellos and topped with basil flakes.

This Alfredo is amazing as a base to your sauce. If you like mushrooms and chicken you can easily put it into your sauce to get that flavor that you may think it is lacking. Just take half the butter required in the recipe and cut up some mushrooms sauté them. Once they are cooked add the other portion of butter. Also basil is a great ingredient to add, you can do it at the end once everything is cooked. I have always thought that many of the Alfredo sauces that people make are too thick and are over the top. The consistency is amazing in this Alfredo! Make sure to season it as well. This definitely gets my stamp of approval.

Hi,

I added 1 jar of Classici Alfredo sauce, 1/2 cup of bacon and 3-4 sliced mushrooms. Turned out to be pretty good :)

I am not a huge fan of Parmesan, and it was really over powering. So, I added some cream cheese (can't really be accurate in the measurement, i just kept dumping it in until it tasted better). I also added sauteed portabello mushrooms which always makes everything better.

I added 3 cloves of garlic instead of one. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. It's easy, delicious, and perfect! I made it to put on pizza instead of red sauce, and it was out of this world! Thanks for sharing this winner with us!

I have made this many times and have never had a problem.  I only use parmigiano reggiano cheese, shredded with a fine microplane.  I've never had it come out gritty and it tastes great.  The real test was when i had some leftover noodles and my husband wanted another helping.  I had a jar of Classico alfredo sauce in the pantry, so he used that.  He said it was so gross compared to the fresh version.  He was fine with the jar until I started making this.
So if it's coming out gritty you may be using cheese that is shredded too big or maybe the cream isn't hot enough to melt the cheese completely.  Freshly grated by YOU is going to make a huge difference!

This was incredible! VERY cheesy (in a good way)! If you love parmesan, you will love this. My only remark is that the quantity was a bit small, may want to make for a larger # of servings than you are planning for.

I added a little bit of mozzarella to make up for a small amount of Parmesan cheese that I was short on, and garlic powder instead of a fresh clove. It turned out very well and was quick to make. I am sure there are some better recipes out there, but my family enjoyed this one a lot. It was good tossed with shrimp and I only with I had broccoli to add to it.

this was great! So simple and delicious! I made a few alterations though. Added pesto towards the end. it's strong tasting so I toned it down with the left over mild cheddar I had from another recipe I was making that night. suggest another type of creamy mild cheese though I haven't figured out which yet. happy eating!

This sauce is amazing and takes very little time and effort to make... and its homemade with very little ingredients instead of a jar!!! This sauce is very similar to Olive Garden's alfredo. I am a stay at home Mom of 3 and all of my little ones LOVE this sauce!!!! This is my go to sauce since it's so quick and easy!!! Guest, family etc always ask if its homemade because its so good!!! Give it a try. Play around with the recipe a lot little.... add more garlic, pepper, parsley etc. ENJOY!!!!

This recipe was awesome and easy! My wife loved it and told me that it was the best dinner I've ever made. I used half and half and had to thin it out just a little (2-3 table spoons) at the end. I also whiskey the cheese in and raised the heat a little to assist in melting the cheese! Lastly, I used spaghetti squash. SO GOOD!

I made some changes. I did not use any garlic. I love the rich creamy flavors of the heavy cream and butter with freshly grated parmesan. Delicious. I am not a fan of spicy Alfredo and this hits the spot, nicely.

This is a great base recipe to start with.  I made a few changes and it turned out fantastic!

-Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium low heat. Add heavy whipping cream and simmer for 5 minutes. 

-Then add 1/4 cup minced garlic crushed, "QUALITY" cheese (Parmesan (Block)/Gruyere (Grated)/8 oz Philadelphia Cream Cheese), Dash of garlic sea salt,  1/4 cup parsley, 1 fresh lemon squeezed (juice) and whisk quickly, heating through.

-Simmer is the key!  (Don't boil just light simmer where bubbles gently pop on top for 10-15 minutes w/ continuous whisk)

We also added (Chicken/Broccoli/Mushrooms/Peas)

This was my first time making my own Alfredo sauce, and I was worried about some of the comments saying it was bland and runny. It was neither of those things! This was honestly the best Alfredo sauce I've ever had in my life, and I've eaten a ton of Alfredo. It was very rich and creamy. FULL of flavor. I'm sure I'll make it a thousand more times. It's delicious.

Quick, cheap, and easy recipes.I found that I had to add about 3/4 of a cup of whole milk to thin the sauce out. The original recipe turned out too thick. I also added the garlic to the melted butter first and sautéed it briefly, before adding the milk. This gave it more flavor. I also added sautéed mushrooms a chopped cooked bacon to the finished product. Delicious.

Easy to put together and tasty. I used this recipe  as a base to make a chicken alfredo fettuccini. If the sauce gets too thick, just add a little milk.

Good consistency, fun to cook, but for me, no flavor made as is. Perhaps I will try it with Romano cheese instead of parma next time.

Make this one all the time - so easy and so much better than store-bought sauces! I usually do substitute at least some Gruyere cheese as suggested - seems to turn out much better & creamier that way.

First, let me start by saying that I left out parmesan because I didn't have any in my house but that never stopped me from enjoying Alfredo so I wasn't too bothered by it. It might have been why this wasn't as flavorful as it could have been though. And with that all the way, let me say that you definitely need to add salt and black pepper to this, to your personal taste but it is definitely needed. You also have to add some kind of thickening agent to this sauce or it'll be too runny: I went with flour. Finally, I added some sauted onions to this. Overall, it was a really quick and easy alfredo sauce to make when you're in a hurry and you're not too concerned about taste.

Love this recipe is doubled the recipe and used two 5 Oz containers of shredded parmigiano cheese and added an 8th of a cup of flour to the butter so it would thicken a little and added more garlic and served it with Cajun grilled chicken, New Orleans style sausage, and Cajun sautéed shrimp. Delish

This was SO good!! Creamy and kind of cheesy and super delicious! I substituted the parmesan for gruyere! I think it was a good choice! Also, super easy to throw together and it tastes like it took a long time to make!! Would definitely do this again!!!! Very happy with the results!

This sauce was a great foundation. I agree with other reviews that it could be bland as is.
I added garlic, Italian seasoning, tomatoes, grilled shrimp, salt, pepper, and garnished with fresh basil.

I have made this recipe many times now.  It's very easy and delicious.  It does depend on using quality ingredients.  All I do differently is add a bit more garlic because we love garlic!

Really great with a few changes added one cup of half and half one stick of butter and used some milk to thin it out   if we didn't add the additional 2% milk it would've been super thick. we also added 2 cups of Parmesan cheese   And about five or six cloves of garlic it was amazing   We added some garlic salt for seasoning and chicken seasoned with garlic and garlic salt to make a full meal of it threw in a few veggies too. Yummy and easy!

I just made this tonight and my family loved it! I made shrimp Alfredo and used blackened seasoning on the shrimp. I added the cooked noodles to the pan of cooked shrimp and then poured the Alfredo sauce on top and tossed. The blackened seasoning gave it just enough of a kick.

Bomb! Soo good and simple which I love when I'm starving as I'm cooking.  I made it with 2 garlic cloves and less cheese, about an ounce.  Mine sat without cheese for 30 minutes because I had to wait for my brother to bring the cheese and so meanwhile I had the sauce on low and it thickened a lot.  I only got 3 servings out of it by the way.  Anyways, I was really happy with it.  Next time I'll have to double up on the ingredients.

This is super easy and very tasty. I'm not sure how people can think this is bland, but everyone's taste buds are different. I followed this recipe to the T and it's GREAT! I used Trader Joe's crushed garlic and tossed this sauce with some fettuccine noodles and will be serving it with shrimp! Definitely a keeper!

It taste really good but you can tell there is Kraft Parmesan in it. Its really gritty, maybe use real parmasan instead of Kraft would be better.

This is a great basic alfredo recipe. You can dress it up any way you like by adding  a few simple ingredients such as pepper. To the people who want to post a critical review, please include how you would improve this recipe. Don't just criticize like some of the other posters here.

Holy moly this was fantastic! Super easy and fast to make. I made NO changes to recipe - it was perfect. Served it over linguine with some diced chicken breast. My whole family wanted seconds, and probably would have asked for more if I had it! Will definitely make again soon!

Lovely, quick alfredo sauce. I grew up calling it insomnia noodles because it's so quick you can make it in the middle of the night and because it will (definitely) put you to sleep.

I only used a bit of butter to saute the garlic, then added the rest after the cream had heated, stirring constantly over low heat. Lowish heat is dead important, otherwise the cream can scorch or the sauce separate, and stirring constantly is a must. Freshly grated cheese is definitely worth it; it melts better, tastes better and results in a thicker sauce. Add the cheese a bit at a time, stirring to melt it entirely until adding the next bit. Reduce the sauce, and keep a bit of the pasta water on hand to add to the dish if the sauce is too thick when you add the pasta. Delicious with spinach added.

I used margarine instead of butter and Homogenized milk instead of heavy cream. I added a bit more minced garlic than the recipe calls for and cut down the parsley a touch. Easy and delicious, one of the best Alfredo recipes I've found so far! The best part is that it doesn't get chunky if left in the pan to warm while the pasta is cooking, which is a huge issue with many of the Alfredo recipes that exist.

I really liked this recipe. I tripled it, and made a minor change: I used one of those big triangular blocks of fresh aged parmesan and some havarti. It came out delicious. 

I tossed it with some rigatoni and grilled chicken. I'll be using this as my go-to recipe from now on.

Great starting point. I added an additional clove of garlic, used 1 cup of Asiago and 1 cup Parmesan, a tablespoon of Rosemary and a tablespoon or oregano. Also some black pepper and a little bit of salt. After the additions, we absolutely love it!

Tasted OK. Stirring, whisking over low heat and the cheese never melted completely.  I followed the directions and still it was never smooth

Made it! Recipe is perfect. I'm on a low carb diet, so I put this over Shirake noodles. Delicious!

A very cheesy recipe, I cut a bit of the cheese, added a little more parsley and some sweet peas at the end to give it more flavor and some texture.

I prepared meatballs and wanted to change up the sauce from the traditional marinara option. Knowing my significant other loves this cheesy sauce, Alfredo was a natural choice. 

This recipe was easy to make and all ingredients were in my pantry already.

Substitutions: 

*Clove or Garlic Substitute
Minced Garlic

*Heavy Cream Substitute: 3/4 cup milk (skim, low fat, regular )
1/3 cup This recipe can also be used as a dipping sauce for bread sticks, crescent rolls, and of course pasta.

I think that this is a great basic recipe. Personally, I like a stronger garlic flavor. I added about 4 small cloves instead of the 1. Also I changed up the cheese. I actually don't like parmesan cheese and rarely have it in my fridge. I did have mozzarella on hand and it worked very well. Just make sure to cut it up into really small pieces so it will melt easier.  As for seasoning, I did add some freshly ground pepper and that's about it. No need for salt if you use salted butter.

This tasted very good, however I found it was very grainy.  I should have read the reviews that stated how to keep it from getting grainy.

Absolutely delicious! The sauce wasn't quite as creamy as I'd hope for with only 1 1/2 cups of Parmesan cheese so all I did was add a little bit more. No other changes that would have altered the flavor.

This sauce is going to be made regularly at my house from now on.

Good basic alfredo sauce that lets you "garlic" it up as you see fit. I used 3 garlic cloves and 1 cup of evaporated milk. I grate my own Parmesan cheese which tastes so much better than pre-grated. In order for this sauce to become smooth and not lumpy, add the cheese in small amounts whisking really well in between each addition. I also used margarine and whisked often during the 5 minute simmer time so the evaporated milk and margarine would not separate.

I love this easy recipe for alfredo sauce! I definitely recommend using a bag of shredded or fresh parmesan, not the grated powdery kind, (which I tried the first time and it was too "gritty" of a texture). Sometimes I add a little extra garlic to suit our taste. Our favorite way to eat this is with ground hot Italian sausage over fettucine noodles.

Super quick & easy to make! Fresh Parmesan doesn't melt well, as it sticks to the pot or pan and often the utensil you're using to mix.  So, I used Parmesan out of the shaker and added the fresh stuff at the end when I tossed the pasta in the sauce.  I also put the pasta in a frying pan with a bit of olive oil and mixed in the parsley.  Then I tossed the pasta in the sauce.  Kids & hubby devoured it. :)

Doubled the recipe and added fresh cracked pepper (per the traditional Alfredo recipe) also doubled the garlic. Definitely whisk the cream into the completely melted unsalted butter, this will help with separation, and use fresh Parmesan, none of that dried stuff. Super simple and delicious for a quick meal!!! Added it to pasta with shrimp and broccoli :)

This recipe was amazing. My family loved it. I paired it with blackened shrimp. The flavors complimented each other perfectly. The only thing I did differently was instead of the garlic clove, I used a table spoon of crushed garlic.

This is my go-to recipe for Alfredo sauce. I love the simplicity. When I don't have quite enough parmesan I sometimes add mozzarella. It still comes out fantastic. Creamy without being too rich.

Very simple, very good, but missing something.  To me, it isn't authentic pasta without basil, so I added about 2 tablespoons.

I absolutely love this recipe!
Ever since finding this recipe I will never use jarred alfredo sauce again.
I usually use penne rather than fettuccini, pan fry up some chicken or shrimp and mushrooms, steam some broccoli, and throw a heaping handful of fresh spinach into the sauce.
Definitely a family favourite!!

I made slight adjustments to the recipe.  

I minced a large garlic clove.  
Used half and half instead of heavy cream.  
Added a 1/4 tsp. fresh cracked black pepper.  
And...I used a packaged so shredded Parmesan cheese instead of grated.  It is delicious??

I made this pretty much as written. I used a bag of shredded parm which was 1-1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup Romano. I sautéed the garlic in butter before adding the cream. I had no problem melting the cheese and it did not come out grainy at all. I kept heat on low and kept stirring until everything was melted which happened pretty quickly. I did splash in some half and half because I think it got a bit too thick. This did not coat a whole lb of fettuccini but about 12 oz.  I thought it would be too dry if I tried to coat the whole lb.  all in all a very enjoyable meal.

Simple and delicious Alfredo sauce. 

Used about half the butter and made up the difference with a good healthy heart vegetable oil (you can use a good olive oil too, but might affect the taste slightly). Also added fresh ground pepper. Depending on the type of Parmesan cheese, you might add about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt, but be careful as the cheese has its own saltiness.

This sauce was AMAZING in my zucchini chicken alfredo pasta! It wasn't enough though so I doubled it (cooking for 4) and i added much more garlic and parmesan for flavor. Also added some extra salt and spices. Came out perfect I will be making this at least once a week!

Great recipe. I added a little extra garlic (bc I looove garlic), fresh ground black pepper,  and a little oregano/basil.  Perfect with fettuccine and cajun grilled chicken. Also with chicken spinich, black, olive, whole leaf pizza

I scaled the recipe down to two servings, and used a dash of dried minced garlic instead of 1/2 clove of fresh. I also omitted the parsley because of personal preference. This was quick, easy and delicious! I used it on zucchini "noodles". Will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

This is wonderful.  I find it tastes better than the jared kind plus you can tweak it for different tastes such as add mushrooms,  more or less garlic.

Fantastic and so easy! Doubled it for a pound of noodles, I will
never make boxed noodles again! Or buy nasty jarred Alfredo sauce, either. Parmesan melted just fine.

I made this for lunch today, and it's not bad. I wanted pasta and I didn't have any sauce, or the time to make tomato sauce, so I was looking for something quick and easy. 

I halved the recipe since it was just for me. I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted half-n-half, as others have done. It was still very creamy - I added a little of the pasta water to thin it out. 

I do think it needs more garlic - and I added the garlic to the melted butter so it could sauté a bit before adding the cream. (Does the recipe really want you to add raw garlic to a sauce?) I think pepper would be a good idea, as well.

I just tried this recipe...it sets the foundation for a great tasting Alfredo sauce...I added garlic salt and pepper..as well as Cajun blackened shrimp and mushrooms that gave the sauce extra flavor. I definitely will be using this recipe again!

delicious, quick and simple.  I will never buy alfredo sauce in a jar again.  It is definitely cheesy but that is what alfredo sauce is supposed to be.

This recipe was very delicious, i did however, have to substitute the fresh garlic clove and parsley with dried garlic and parsley, I made sure that I made the dried garlic and parsley equivalent to fresh garlic and parsley, I also used milk instead of cream, but the thickness was perfect as it should be. My only problem, which it might have been suppose to taste this way, was that there was way to much Parmesan cheese, if you do not want an over powering taste of Parmesan cheese then i would suggest to you that you do one cup less that what it called for, I had 16 servings because I have a big family so it called for 6 cups of Parmesan Cheese, I should have done 5 cups. If it doesn't taste good enough then slowly add more Parmesan to recipe. Otherwise this is a very tasty Recipe :D

This sauce is great!! I added chicken and red and yellow bell peppers. I reduced the amount of butter but added more cheeses [Gruyere, Blue cheese, Parmesan  because I LOVE CHEESE! EASY AND QUICK TO MAKE! Also, it can be modified and played around with for extra variety.

the only reason I put 4 stars is my computer is so small I can't see the fifth star. This is a glorious piece of pasta topping goodness. I pulled it out of the crock pot and poured it over some potatoes. The bad part was I missed and it spilled all over the floor of my dirt hut. However we broke out the corn chips and soon realized it's fantastic! Floor sauce or fresh sauce!

This is a great sauce!  It's very good as is, but I made some changes the other times I've made it. Adding two cloves of garlic, oregano, basil and some squeezes of fresh lemon. I've always made another recipe for alfredo sauce requiring cream cheese which was awesome, but my family liked this better. It's not as heavy/thick. This is the only recipe that I make.

If you use shredded Parmesan instead of the grated powder, then the cheese will melt down a lot easier. Other than that this recipe is perfect and tastes wonderful.

I reduced the amount of cheese because it was getting too thick. A little over a cup was prefect.

The sauce is good. I'll say that much. Getting it to blend? Not so easy. Holy cow... So I sommered the milk like it said along with the butter, then dumped all the cheese in at once... It was a pile of melted cheese and butter and milk.... I was devastated but would not give up! I heated it all up and dumped it in my VITAMIX! I blended for a few minutes and added some more milk to get the right thickness. Yummy! But what a journey.

I followed the recipe exactly it was awesome! I love this it tastes great and its really easy to make. It's also very inexpensive. I was thinking about getting that too salty processed easy melt cheese. I'm so glad I made this instead its healthier than that other stuff. My husband says this is better than the Alfredo sauce at olive garden.

Loved this! It's a great base Alfredo... I added just an extra clove of garlic & then blanched some fresh spinach at the end & added it. If you like, you can also heat up a few artichoke hearts and that's delicious as well! We served over a portabello mushroom ravioli...makes a quick, but wonderful dinner!

Excellent Alfredo and simple to make. I add some sautéed mushrooms and onions at the end and serve it over gluten-free spaghetti with sliced strips of baked chicken on top. I still have yet to find gluten-free fettuccine, so spaghetti it is.

Very easy to make and depending on what brand of parmesan you use, you can make it stronger or weaker in flavor. Definitely 5 stars.

Delicious start to alfredo!  DON'T BOTHER with grated parmesan - buy a wedge and do it yourself, or set the kids grating while you prep accompaniments.  I make this with about 1/2 cup less parmesan and add a little romano, as the parmesan got too overpowering.  Add some cayenne, black pepper, basil, and fold with red bell pepper, mushroom, chicken/rabbit/shrimp, and onion, and it's quite a nice meal!

Great recipe.  When stirring, I've found that an easy stirring produces a smoother sauce.  I also add 1/2 tsp of anise seed to the sauce, along with extra garlic and fresh ground black pepper.  This is a pretty basic sauce, so I wouldn't be afraid to experiment with different cheeses, spices (lightly done!) or other things. Just be creative, and enjoy cooking.

Really easy recipe. Would not change a thing. It turned out very good and took a short amount of time. I used this for a culinary project and my family loved it! Can be made with minimal culinary experience, as I'm not too skilled in the kitchen.

Tried this recipe exactly how it says but my "sauce" turned more into a paste.  Very thick, not sure what made it seize that way.  Maybe more cream or less cheese next time?

This is an incredibly easy and quick sauce to make. I added shredded cooked chicken at the end and served it over steamed broccoli. Delicious!

I used 3 cloves of garlic, 1 1/2 cup of Gruyere and 1 cup of Parmesan cheese and another extra 3/4 cup of half and half ( didn't use heavy cream) because otherwise the sauce barely enough to toss a box of cooked noodles. ( we prefer more of a saucy Alfredo).
I also tossed in blanched broccoli florets in with the noodles and sauce, sprinkled with fresh cracked black pepper and chopped fresh parsley.
Really good !

Yummmmy!  I tweaked the ingredients, because I didn't think the original recipe would cover a pound of fettuccini, I used 1 stick of butter,  3 cups of heavy cream, 8 cloves of garlic (we LOVE garlic) and only added 1 additional cup of Parmesan and the consistency was perfect!  I used the regular store bought Parmesan cheese this time, but next time I might use  fresh Parmesan and maybe some Romano or gruyere, but it's probably not necessary. It was a great, cheap and filling meal that we all loved. Delish!

I usually double the recipe but use 
1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup whole milk then 1 1/2 cups parmesan and 8 oz of cream cheese... If you have parmesan rind throw that in while it is cooking for extra flavor, then removed just before eating

I made this today for friends and it was heavenly! It was creamy, incredibly flavorful, and so delicious! I did use good quality Parmesan mixed with Premesano Reggiano, both of which I grated myself. It took longer than the recipe said, but it still wasn't too time consuming, and it was definitely worth it! I would suggest that you add the cheese in very little at a time, and whisk constantly!! And if it seems a bit too runny at first, don't worry, it does thicken as it sits. Everyone loved this sauce, and I was told it was better than Olive Garden's Alfredo. This is a great recipe and I will be making it regularly!

I made this sauce tonight It was great I served it over Burtolli Chicken and Herb Tortillini.  This sauce was just right for the pasta I used because that had it's own flavor as well.  I will make it again and again my husband loved it with the pasta as well.

there was to much parmesan cheese.. I made it for my sister and grandmother and none of could eat it. what I did was I added lemon juice, milk, lime juice, mozzarella cheese, garlic salt, and pepper, and a little bit of Alfredo from a jar just to lower the taste of parmesan and even then it didn't help.

This was amazing! So easy to make and so creamy; so much better than the Alfredo & Pasta kits in the store...and to think...I thought those were the best! This sauce takes a short time to make just like the store bought ones. This is for sure my new fave!!!!

A good basic recipe that is easy to prepare!  I would have loved more garlic but I wanted to try it as written and it makes a great sauce and easily could coat a pound of pasta.  Will use again!

This is a keeper!!!  Fast, easy and delicious...what more could a cook ask for?  I doubled the sauce recipe & added an extra clove of garlic.  Better than the chicken fettuccine alfredos I've had at many restaurants!  (Did I mention it's easy?)

I was expecting my family to love this, but they thought it was just okay.  My sauce came out a bit grainy.  I am wondering if it was my cheese.  Bought from cheese section, but did not shreed my own.  My kids felt the sauce was bland.

I actually managed to make this with %2 milk. All you have to do is halve the butter. prepare one half as the recipe calls and melt the other half with equal part flour to make a nice roux to mix in when the sauce is finished cooking. Thickens it right up!

This is very good and easy to make. I used I cup of parmesan and 1/2 cup of an Italian cheese blend. I did add some freshly ground pepper and a dash of Nutmeg right before serving. No more store bought for me.

I absolutely love this recipe. For more flavor and a thicker sauce I add about 2 oz of cream cheese to the recipe for serving size 8. I also add spinach, chicken, and mushrooms to the mix to make it even yummier

Sauce is very good. I did put in the garlic and added some green onions while melting the butter and used parmesan/asiago/romano blend. Served it over fettuccine with chicken & broccoli. My 15 and 3 year old loved it!

Awesome. Took the advice of others and added more garlic, and stirred the cheese with the cream. Next time I will make more sauce.

This was extremely easy and came out tasting exactly what I was expecting.  I used 5oz of shredded Parmesan cheese from the fancy cheese isle in the store and I found that it melted quite easily.  You just have to stand through it til the end, and whisk until it becomes all cream. Be sure to wear your apron though!  And I strongly urge you to wash your whisk immediately when you are finished, otherwise it will be very difficult to wash once everything dries.  I do not understand the "bland" claims that came from some reviewers.  This is how Alfredo sauce tastes!

This is the first time I have ever made Alfredo sauce from scratch. My Bestie shared her secret with me and I almost wished she hadn't!  It is so so easy and amazingly delicious!

This is a good recipe. I used roasted garlic and cooked up some chicken breasts. I had no issues with it being runny. Not sure where that's coming from. I did use salt, pepper and some of emeril's essence. It was very good!

Amazing! I can't imagine anyone not liking it if preparing it correctly. I only ever use freshly grated parmesan cheese and I slowly add it stiring constantly as I do so to prevent clumping! It's wonderful.

I really like this recipe.  I will never buy Alfredo sauce from the stores again.  I like to add fresh garlic, maybe two cloves, while my butter is melting. Garlic is a must to bring this true alfredo taste to a head!!

Easy and tastes great! I ended up using a little extra garlic and a little more heavy cream to thicken it up more

Very Delicious and simple to make. I sautéed some mushrooms in olive oil, then added the crushed garlic. Once the garlic was fragrant, I added butter and heavy cream. I then added a dash of nutmeg, a dash of cayenne pepper and  black pepper. Once the parmesan cheese was added I just watched the consistency of the sauce till it was how I wanted it, poured it over penne noodles and sprinkled on some parsley. All I was missing was some garlic bread. Very Good.

This is an amazing alfredo.  I used Jarlsburg cheese which was fantastic.  I also added a 3 finger pinch of sea salt and used fresh parsley as a garnish.  Amazing!!!

Excellent sauce that my whole family loved.  I was scrounging our kitchen to make dinner tonight and decided to whip up this sauce on the fly.  Easy to make and tasted fantastic over bowtie pasta with broccoli.  I substituted dried Parmesan for the requested freshly ground cheese and it was still amazing, albeit a little salty (but that's my fault, not the recipe creators).

perfect exactly the way it is better than any commercial jar sauce plus homemade so you know what's in it fresh ingredients. I just used kraft grated parmesan in the plastic container and it came out great for me. didn't have fresh parm on hand but it worked!

Perfect recipe and a good base to play with. We had some left over Spaghetti Factory Mizithra cheese, so that took place of the Parmesan cheese and we doubled the Garlic (we roll that way in our home!) Had some shrimp in the freezer, quick saute in butter and Chardonnay. It was major yummy!!!

this is a great recipe!I just don't understand why people want to make it low fat? its Alfredo &Alfredo is fattening lol. That's why it's so good. also if you buy fresh Parmesan in a block and grate it yourself it melts superbly.

This was my first time making this recipe and boy am I glad I did! my wife complimented me saying that it tasted better than what we get out the jar! when I made this sauce following the recipe verbatim,  my sauce was very thick...almost the consistency of oatmeal. I added about another cup of milk until it was the consistency I liked, added salt, pepper, and that was a wrap! Thank you whoever posted this!

My husband is a huge fan of Olive Garden's alfredo sauce.  This recipe is really close and I've made it many times.  I use half and half instead of cream and add some regular powdered parmesian to thicken it up.  I also double the garlic and throw it in with the melting butter.  To save time, I use freeze-dried parsley.  I double the recipe for extra sauce to spoon over chicken and broccoli.  So nummy!

It was great.  I read some of the reviews and tweaked it as well.  Plus I added shrimp and crab meat.  Used the unsalted butter whisked from start to finish.   Instead of 1 cup of heavy cream I made a seafood broth from the shells of shrimp and crab boiled with peppercorn, garlic, salt, pepper then put through a fine strainer.  Used 1/2 cup of broth to 3/4 cup heavy cream.  Used 1cup Parmesan and 1/2 cup of asiago cheese. 2 gloves of garlic Added sun dried tomatoes finely chopped at the end with chives instead of parsley.  Pinch of red pepper flakes.  I then used the rest of the seafood broth for the pasta water.

I kind of expected this when I looked at the ingredients, but this mostly just tastes like garlic and parmesan. The recipe calls for way too much cheese, almost making a fondue. If you don't think of it as alfredo sauce ("sloppe garlique" perhaps) it's okay (it tastes like garlic, after all), but it's certainly not passable as alfredo sauce.

This is the best Alfredo sauce I've made! I've tried several recipes. My husband and kids loved it!  Only change I made was with the cheese. Added 3/4 cup grated Romano cheese and 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese. I did not add salt. It didn't need it.

This recipe is AWESOME!! My 4 year old loved it! I doubled the sauce and used 2 c. gruyere cheese and 1 c. shredded parmesan. I also used dried parsley because that is all I had on hand! My husband said " Man....That's good sauce" thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.I added fresh parsley and used fresh Asiago cheese because that is what I had. I also added 2 cloves of garlic instead of one since we love garlic. I served this over Spinach-Artichoke fetuccini and it was perfect.

I found that the sauce was too salty. It does not taste like Olive Garden Alfredo sauce to me but my family liked it okay once we added pesto to it. The lady at Olive Garden told my husband that use a Parmesan Romano blend so I will try that next time along with unsalted butter. Also when reheating the sauce the oils have separated from the rest and I'm having a hard time getting them to the right consistency as they were yesterday.

We always use this recipe. Sometimes we leave out the parsley, if we don't have it around. It just as good with or without it. We like it served over penne pasta with chicken and broccoli. It is so yummy! The picture I added was preparing to make it. We're having guests for lunch today, and it's been a while since we had this. Can't wait!

This is better than restaurant quality Alfredo Sauce. Simple and quick to make.  We served it with  garlic shrimp over linguine and it was scrumptious.  This will quickly become one of our favorites I'm sure.

Loved the flavor of this!! I took the advice of a couple of reviews and added a second clove of garlic because I'm a garlic fanatic, and I added a little flour to help thicken it a little as my past experiences with making cream-based sauces is that they tend to be thinner than I'd like. Overall, a delicious recipe!!

I did half a cup of lite cream cheese, half a cup of sour cream lite and 1/4 cup of  1% milk . didn't have shredded Parmesan cheese so I used shaker Parmesan cheese.  Let it simmer to melt cream cheese and Parmesan cheese and wow so creamy and lite really really great... Better than the original. And some pepper and garlic powder  instead of fresh garlic... Great...  chopped up chicken breast cooked with green onion and mushrooms ( brown mushrooms and onions together. Then take out use same pan and cook diced chicken breasts. Once chicken is cooked add mushrooms and green onions) waaayyy better

Loved this recipe! I was worried that the parsley would overpower the taste, but it didn't. Next time, I'm going to double it. The only thing I changed was to add cajun seasoning. My entire family loved it and wanted seconds! I got two thumbs up from my son's girlfriend! I would recommend constantly stirring/whisking to keep it from burning. I did this, and it didn't burn at all.

I fixed this for a family get together.  It was fast and easy. I also wasn't worn out like I usually am after I prepare a meal for a large crowd. Everyone loved it, even the picky ones.  Plus you can add chicken for those who have to have meat with their meal, leaving some for the vegetarians.

I love this recipe.  The key is to use high end parmesan I get finely grated parm from the deli section. Im a texture person so I like that parm doesn't melt all the way down. I also add shrimp chicken and spinach that I sautéed in melted butter evoo and fresh garlic. I used bow tie pasta layered chicken shrimp and spinach and pour on the sauce yum.

I added the garlic to the butter and used about 1/8 c dried parsley (adding it just before putting in the cheese). Other than that, I followed the recipe.

This was delicious! A bit on the salty side, probably because of the cheese and I used salted butter. But, man, was it good! I've saved the recipe and will definitely make again.

I love how fast this cooks up and it's just a few ingredients - which is awesome. Husband loved it too, and he's not a big Alfredo sauce person.

I personally hate Alfredo sauce but my brothers love it and I made it for them. They loved it. Easy to make. I actually used the green jarred parmesan cheese because that's all I had, and I whisked a ton and added it in small amounts. Turned out fine. Also added a little pepper and chili powder.

This recipe really does taste exactly like Olive Garden's Alfredo. You can use milk and cornstarch or flour instead of cream, reduce the amount of butter (considerably), and it tastes just as good! I love, love, LOVE this recipe. I make it at least once a month. :) :) :) :) :)

I made this exactly as written.  It was perfect. I'll never buy another bottle of alfredo sauce.  That's a biggie for me because I love shortcuts.  I am not a big fan of cooking, but I do enjoy simple, fresh food. The only thing I added was some leftover cubed chicken breast which I heated in the microwave. I added the chicken to the pasta and then mixed in the sauce. Add a salad and you will have a great meal.

I heated the butter and cream separately until they were almost simmering, gently steaming (This sauce does NOT need to simmer to thicken.) Then I whisked the cream into the butter and added Gruyere cheese a little at a time while the pasta boiled. This recipe can get fairly salty, so watch the salt.

Quick and easy, I would probably double it though next time.  I used shredded parmesan instead of the grated kind.  We loved it!  Make sure to simmer it on low heat and constantly stir it.

I was disappointed because the sauce broke.  I followed the directions (and the reviews) closely so that wouldn't happen...but it did anyway.  The sauce was also grainy and I used a quality parmesan...not the stuff in the green can.  I don't know what went wrong, but I will try other sauces in the future.

Perfect just the way it is except i left out the parsley and added a dash of white pepper and doubled the recipe but really it needs no changes. I used real unsalted butter (salted will make it too salty) and heavy cream because whats the point if you don't use the good stuff? My picky kids even loved it and thats unheard of. I added chicken and broccoli as well. If you use the right parmesan cheese it melts perfectly. I shredded a block of fresh parm and it melted like a dream. Don't use anything in a package or canister get the good stuff and shred it yourself its worth it. Fabulous!!

Very good!! I needed something quick cheap and easy to make with the items I had on hand...this was perfect for chicken pasta Alfredo. I used parmesan-romano and half & half instead and it came out great!

Fresh Parm is best. Once the cream and butter are heated put the cheese in and stir. Do NOT let it cook long, it will become very lumpy. 1-2 min max and it will be completely creamy. Any longer and it will clump.

Add one clove of chopped garlic with the butter and allow it to color slightly. You will get no flavor if you put it in with the cheese. Just chunks of garlic shock.

Great recipe!! Except I used 1/2 cup of parm cheese and 4 oz of cream cheese (I ran out of parm and saw that in another recipe). It was fantastic!! Also, only had dried parsley but did the trick if in a jam. Sooooo good!!

Delicious! Although I didn't use fresh Parmesan so the sauce was a little gritty. Lesson learned! I also added 1/2c of bacon to the sauce and tossed it with grilled chicken and pasta. It was a family hit!

So I deviated a bit from the recipe, but as is, the sauce is still delicious! I doubled it and added a cup of Romano cheese, grated, and an additional half cup of parm. I used heavy whipping cream because I was out of heavy cream. Other than that I combined ingredients as directed. I made this for Mother's day and my family raved about the sauce! I served it over penne pasta with spinach, turkey bacon, and mushrooms. IT IS ALL ABOUT INGREDIENTS! YOU MUST USE FRESHLY GRATED CHEESE.

This recipe was awesome even though I tweaked it just a bit. I used Apple-wood Smoked Gruyere cheese with a little Parmesan which added a great scent and flavor to it. I also added a quarter stick of cream cheese as well and the results were phenomenal! I will use this recipe for the rest of my days and never buy store sauce ever again!

Yum!  I love the alfredo sauce at the Olive Garden and this is just a good and I can stay home and dunk my bread rolls in it, use as a base for a pizza, or spoon on top of a pasta dish.  Very easy to vary the item to suit so many different dishes.  Thank you for sharing.

I talked my son into making this to show him scratch sauces are better than jarred. He's learning to cook and did an excellent job. Now he's hooked on cooking from scratch and is getting better all the time. The sauce IS easy and delicious.

This sauce was good the first time I made it. The second time, I omitted the garlic and used Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, with a few scrapes of fresh whole nutmeg. To me, it was the perfect flavor for alfredo sauce. Especially good served on the plate, under a big piece of lasagna.

After years of trying, this is by-far the easiest and quickest successful recipe for alfredo sauce yet!  The only thing I did differently was to add the garlic right after the butter melted to give it more of an infused flavor.  When the butter & milk were simmering, just be sure to whisk every now and then to create that thick rue.  Mmmmm....

Wonderful recipe! Thanks so much for sharing.  Your recipe is great and versatile too.  I didn't have enough heavy cream so I substituted sour cream for the remainder.  This is so good we may have it again tomorrow so I can buy the right ingredients.  Thanks again!

This is now my go to Alfredo Sauce. Easy, and tastes wonderful. Iyou found this bland the first time you make it,try adding the garlic in at the beginning and saute in the butter alone, also add more garlic if needed. I also added the parsley to my liking, as well as a bit of salt, pepper, and a small amount of italian seasoning. (P.s. make sure you DO NOT use pre-grated cheese, thats just asking for a disaster)

This is my "go to" Alfredo recipe that makes me feel like a gourmet chef!  I've made it about 8 times in the last 3 months.  Usually, I make it exact to the recipe, but I made a small change this time.  Some of the reviews mentioned blending a bit of gruyere with the Parmesan.   I had some left over from a previous recipe so I tried it and it greatly sharpened the flavor.  My husband loved it, and so did my teen kids. I actually preferred the sauce without it and won't add it again.  Besides gruyere is expensive so I wouldn't try it unless you had it on hand.   This recipe is the best.  Try it and you'll want love it,

This was delicious however I added way too much garlic. I used fresh parmigiana and the sauce was very thick. The only thing I would change was my overuse of fresh garlic. I will definitely make this again

I made the sauce on the stove in a sauce pan and the cheese formed clumps that were inedible and had to be strained. The sauce was basically just milk and butter that was marinated in cheese.

The recipe itself makes a good consistency alfredo. I added some italian seasoning and an extra two cloves of garlic as well as fresh black pepper.  I used 1% milk as that was all I had on hand.  I compensated with a shake or two of corn starch, but it was not necessary.  With my changes my husband thought it was a 5, but I hate when people rate recipes after they make changes.

I made this for my boyfriend, who only orders Alfredo at any Italian restaurant we go to. He said it was better than in the restaurant. I used table cream instead of full cream and of course almost tripled the garlic as we are huge garlic fans. I used freshly grated parmasian and it melted amazingly. I even at left overs 2 days later and it was just as good. You can even use this Alfredo sauce as a bread dip! Yum! Enjoy everyone

I made this a couple of days ago for my husband and brother - I've been looking for a good alfredo recipe for a while now.  All I substituted was half Fontina/half Parmesan (and some extra cheese) for the pure Parmesan, and added some salt and pepper at the end.  I also sauteed the garlic in the butter at the beginning rather than waiting until the cheese step, but it turned out amazing.  A+, making for a second time tonight!

I like the flavor but found it heavy and thick despite using milk instead of cream; will try gruyere next time. Slow-cooked fresh tomatoes to add at the end (pushed through a sieve leaving skin and seeds behind) along with a dash of pinot noir for a delicious topping over fresh porcini tagliarini that I'd tossed with a small amount of virgin olive oil and a chiffonade of basil. My husband said, "Make sure you save that recipe!"

Do Not rush the sauce, you need to give time to let the parmesan melt - I didn't give enough time, so it definitely was not thick like I was hoping it would be. I also added way more garlic. SO GOOD!

This recipe was great! Basic, easy to follow instructions and tasty. The best part is that you can play with it and add or remove ingredients. I didn't have parsley (thought I did before I got started...oops! lol) but it still turned out very tasty, creamy and cheesy! :) Thank you!!!!!

Your husband will never let you make "fake" alfredo again. But i did have to add 1/2 cup more cheese and a bit of corn starch to get that thickness.

WOW!  This sauce is delicious!  I made it at the request of my 8-yr old who discovered alfredo sauce at a restaurant. I minced the garlic and added it to the butter for a minute or two before adding the cream. I will make this again.

My family, even my picky eaters cleaned their plates with this recipe. I didn't have fresh parsley, so I omitted it. I used kosher salt and pepper for seasoning.

This is a really good recipe! My family loves alfredo pasta but we always go out to have it. I tried one recipe at home and it was a total disaster (and I made it for company! It made me seem like a bad cook lol). But I absolutely LOVE this recipe! Its very tasteful and creamy.. anyone complaining about blandness should just add more spices! But I followed the recipe as is and it turned out well. I just had to leave a review :)

I've made this recipe twice now and wasn't pleased either time.  I didn't have the same problem that others had with the cheese not melting, but the flavor was just bland.  I won't be making this again.

It's definitely a solid base recipe.  But I had to add extra milk, and it definitely needs more spices (we added salt and pepper).  I'm not totally sure whether or not the salt was necessary: my boyfriend said it needed it and I foolishly believed him without tasting it for myself first.  Certainly, adding a bit of salt did NOT make it taste super salty, so he was probably right.  And it definitely needed the pepper.  My suggestion is to taste it while you are cooking and add more pepper/salt/other spices if it tastes bland.

Easy! I didn't make it. My fifteen year old did with no problems . It is a bit bland probably depending on the type of cheese you use? We used fresh Parm & just added a few sprinkles of garlic powder.

My husband, who isn't a fan of Italian inspired foods, always enjoys when I make this meal. I use more parm, and prefer basil instead of parsley. The star of this sauce is the parm, get a bad parm and you will have a horrible sauce.

So, like it or not, this is American Alfredo.  Nothing but butter, cream and cheese. Great recipe.  Originally Alfredo was only cheese and butter tossed on pasta.  The "Alfredo" adaption of pasta with cheese and butter was only to increase the butter.  Americans add cream, from what I read, to compensate for lesser quality cheese.  But this is definitely it.
Would love to see the instructions adapted to include more specific direction on how to temper the sauce so it doesn't break.  I see so many comments on here about broken sauces, which is a temperature issue, not a recipe issue. A low heat and steady whisking (not stirring) will keep the sauce smooth and intact. Dont let it boil, all ingredients at room temp, and grate your own cheese.  Pre-shredded has anti-caking ingredients in it.
Even so, there's not much in Alfredo, so throw what you will into the sauce before serving.  It can take it... Its a great base. I increased the garlic and added black pepper when serving.

This sauce is amazing!  I used Kraft grated parmesan for convenience sake and it is grainy but still very good!  I'm sure freshly grated would make it perfect!  My son says I make the best blackened chicken alfredo ever!  Thanks for the recipe!

For a less rich sauce, cut back on cheese and use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  Great recipie either way.

Found the cream to be too heavy, and pasta not as creamy as we would have liked. Next time will do less heavy cream and milk.  Thank you for a good starter Alfredo recipe.

I use a bit of mozarella for ease of melting and a touch of asiago to ramp up the flavor.  I also do extra herbs and a dash of pepper as others have suggested.  This is a real crowd pleaser.

I'm a garlic fan so added 3 cloves to a double recipe. While I'm very fat conscience I felt obligated to use heavy cream and butter and I'm very glad I did. I reduced the butter to 1/3 C on the double recipe and didn't notice it missing. HIGHLY recommend using a top quality imported parm that you shred yourself just before cooking; made our meal perfect.

Followed the directions exactly the 1st time: Lovely! 4 of my 6 kids ask for Alfredo [something] for birthday dinner, and this is always my go-to sauce. Also excellent with a generous pinch of nutmeg.

I will never buy store-bought Alfredo sauce again. Who knew making this would be so easy? I didn't have enough cheese, so I used 1c. instead making no substitutions and I think the results were still fantastic. Might add a bit more parsley next time, but its all preference.

The only change I made was to double the garlic and throw in some dried parsley (I didn't have any fresh on hand) at the end.

Delicious! I adjusted a few things for my personal tastes, but didn't divert too far from this recipe.  I had never tried Gruyere before but it was great - that's why I love this site, I learn about new foods all the time.  Thank you for submitting this...I will never buy alfredo sauce again!

By far THE BEST alfredo sauce I've had or made. I'm Puerto Rican and this was VERY flavorful! I doubled the recipe exactly using the equivalent of dried parsley and minced garlic.

This recipe is easy to make and super yummy. My family LOVES it! We also add cooked chicken or shrimp to the sauce for a main meal.

Very tasty! i add a pinch of nutmeg, and sometimes use Gorgonzola cheese as well. I make this all the time. I also use 2% milk most of the time. The trick is to not let your butter and milk boil or your cheese will clump and be ruined.

Excellent! It doesn't specify, but I would recommend unsalted butter. Parmesan is so salty as is. I had a hard time getting the cheese to melt and incorporate, so I used a stick blender. I don't know if that's "proper", but it sure worked perfectly. It thickened right up and became smooth. We used our sauce on pizza with spinach, chicken and mozzarella.

I am not much of a cook but I did good on this one! I was starting to panic because sauce wouldn't thicken up. Hubby saved the day by turning heat up higher. I added chicken and bacon towards the end for a complete meal.

Pretty darn tasty... I added a little less than a TBsp of flour and about a tsp of Salt Seasoning to the butter and then added the cream and other ingredients. It had a great consistency and was flavorful... Will make again...

THE best homemade alfredo sauce I've made yet; I've made a few. Definitely a recipe box worthly. Shred your own parmesan cheese, do not use the can kind.

I made this recipe for a family of 8 and they all loved it.  I did use Smoked Gruyere cheese instead of Parmesan and for 4 recipes I used 5 garlic cloves.  Amazingly even the kids loved it.

Amazing recipe!  I love it and will never buy commercially prepared Alfredo sauce again!  This recipe holds up well to mild changes such as adding different spices and cutting with milk a bit.  Simply the best Alfredo sauce ever!

Quick, easy, delicious! I didn't have any parsley and I added a little black pepper because that's how hubby and I like our alfredo. Even before I added the pepper, though, the sauce was delicious! I made sure to stir it often while it cooked to get all the clumps out. It got a bit too thick for my liking so I added a little milk to thin it out. Served over fettuccine noodles with grilled chicken and steamed broccoli. Delish!

Tried for the first time last night and loved it!  I used half and half and grated parm from the bag, it melted just fine.  My 6yr old daughter said it tasted just like Olive Garden alfredo sauce :-)  I think next time I will try heavy cream and fresh parm...maybe add a variety of cheeses also, just for different variations.  Good recipe!

Love this sauce!  I use a Microplane to very finely grate the fresh parmesan and the garlic so it melts quickly and easily.  There is no gritty texture.  My husband wanted seconds but there wasn't any fresh sauce left.  We had some jarred sauce in the fridge so I told him to use that.  He took one bite and threw it away.  Guess I won't be buying that stuff anymore!

This alfredo sauce is super easy and so delicious! I made it for my boyfriend for dinner and he absolutely loved it. I added a little more heavy cream and used 3 teaspoons of dried parsley instead of fresh. I will definitely be making this again!

I think this recipe is fantastic.  I use to make this recipe all the time as is but I wanted to sneak veggies into my families meal so I pureed a head of cauliflower and added it all in.  The cauliflower makes it thick so I use 2% milk to thin it out.

I thought this was great. I had used a Classico alfredo sauce the night before, but didn't have enough sauce for all the left over pasta. So I tried this recipe and it was WAY better than the Classico! I was really surprised at how much flavor there was for not having much seasoning in it. I think the parmesan cheese is what adds a lot of the great flavor. Definitely use a whisk to mix in the cheese and get it to melt in.

Make alfredo sauce all the time.  Originally, Alfredo sauce was nothing more than butter & parmigiana cheese.  If you don't use Parmesan, it is not alfredo.  I use lots of garlic in mine and occasionally will add a little red sauce to make a rosette .

Great recipe! Very quick and easy. Try replacing half of the parmesan with feta cheese and it creates a very interesting flavor that I would highly recommend.

Very good, and my family loved it.  However, I had to add almost twice as much cream than the recipe called for.  I used a blend of shredded parmesan, asiago, and romano cheeses, and found the parmesan and asiago flavors to be overwhelming.  Next time I will try different cheeses.  But getting my son to try new foods is tough, and he loved this.  Getting my husband to eat leftovers is next to impossible, but he reheated this for lunch today and loved it again.  So I'm keeping this one.

Fast and easy! This recipe was great. My wife added shrimp to the sauce. It was just like being at an authentic restaurant. Also, we did't use heavy cream, we used regular sour cream. And on top of the parmesan cheese, I added gouda cheese: outstanding!

Absolutely delicious! Made this for a large dinner party with 20 people.  Sauteed some chicken breats and cut them into thin strips and cooked some penne pasta, then tossed the pasta, sauce and chicken together- it was amazing and a huge hit! Will definitely make again!

I should have gone with my gut and added some flour to help thicken the sauce because mine came out pretty thin.  I added a second clove of garlic and some salt and pepper, but I still think it was missing something.  It was good and we didn't let it go to waste, but it's not the go to Alfredo sauce I'm trying to find.

Fast, easy, and everyone, including the kids loved it!I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I had to double it because everyone loved it so much.  This is perfect for the pint of cream because what else are you going to do with a leftover cup of cream? Even with doubling the recipe there was none left with a family of five. I also thought the alfredo sauce tasted very salty while cooking but once you pour it on the noodles it's perfect. PERFECTO!

This has become my go-to recipe for alfredo sauce. I add an extra clove or two of garlic and it tastes very similar to Olive Garden's sauce.

Some people have mentioned having problems getting the parmesan to melt. I always shred my own parmesan, the shredded stuff from the store has an anti-clump coating on it that keeps the cheese from melting correctly.

Was very good. I used 1 cup shredded parmesan from deli department and 4 oz of queso Blanca Velveeta. Did not use the clove I used Gourmet Garden Garlic (organic; already finely chopped; added to taste).The queso made this recipe nice and creamy with no separation issues.

4 stars for taste and ease, but lacking one star because when I reheated the next day, (on stove, in pan) it was greasy! Any tips or suggestions to avoid excess greasiness??

A quick and easy recipe, When I used to be a prep cook at a place that we made all the noodles and sauce I can tell a difference between the good stuff and the bad and this isn't bad if you do it right. I made it with 1 cup of parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup of Romano cheese and used table cream instead of heavy cream and my family loved it. being served with chicken if coat your chicken breast with a little parmesan cheese then fry it on the skillet it gives a little extra something to the meal!

Perfect alfredo recipe. The texture and flavor are spot on. Depending on your stove you might have to simmer closer to 8 minutes. I cut this recipe in half and use it as a white sauce for my homemade chicken, artichoke heart and sundried tomato pizza. I also use it for chicken and shrimp alfredo. My whole family loves it and it's definitely staying in my recipe rotation.

I really liked this recipe. I decided to grate fresh parmesan as well as add a few spoonfuls of light cream cheese - nothing flavoured just plain. It turned out great! I had to double the batch to make enough for 4 plus leftovers. I also chose to use spaghettini instead of fettucine or any other pasta.

I think this is pretty good alfredo but is a little bland, I've made it twice so far though so it's not bad just needs some extra seasoning. (:

Even in skimping on garlic, this was the best alfredo sauce I've ever had.  Used Parm-reg.  So delicious.

Simple and amazingly delicious.  We vary the recipe with the type of cheese we use.  Romano, or other hard cheeses.  The fresh parsley takes the recipe from OK to AMAZING!

I was looking for a smooth, creamy alfredo and this is it!  I used light cream instead of heavy and added 2 tablespoons of flour to to the butter to thicken it up.  Some pepper at the end made it perfect!

Made this last night... so easy and quick.  The flavour was as it should be... but the parm. cheese doesn't melt nicely... next time I will used SQUIRKIE's suggestion and try a blend of parm / asiago cheese to make it smooth.

I really liked this recipe.  It tasted great although I thought it was maybe a little too salty so maybe cut back on the butter or something?  Either way, we had it over noodles with broccoli and chicken and it was fantastic.

This was really good.  I would have liked the dish a little more if the flavor was a little stronger.  Next time I might try a stronger Parmesan cheese.

I doubled the garlic and also used 2% milk with a bit of cornstarch.   It was great and I'll definitely make it again--and maybe even experiment with skipping the cornstarch so that it's not quite as stiff.

I wouldn't say this is bad, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but it was just a cheesy creamy dip. Nonetheless, it was tasty.

This was such an easy dish and so tasty.  I added grilled chicken and cracked pepercorns for an easy dish that the whole family enjoyed.  It is a running joke in our family that I am not a cook, but this was so simple it made me look like a gourmet.

I used half and half instead of heavy cream, because that was all I had on hand.  Also, I used pre-packaged minced garlic instead of crushing a fresh glove.  Also, I used a gruyere/parmesan combination.  I ended up adding a little cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it, because the lower fat cream choice was not thick enough.  If I make again I will use true heavy cream instead.  I chose this recipe because I was trying to use up gruyere.

Great & EASY recipe! Followed other tips and doubled the garlic... we also substitued part of the parmesan with fresh romano.  FRESH ingredients are a MUST for this to be flavorful and delish!

I love this sauce.  The success is to use only fresh ingredients, esp the cheese.  It tastes so much better and is less expensive if you grate your own.  This is a hit for whatever party I make it for.

I scaled the recipe to 4 servings.  I used real butter, heavy cream, and fresh grated parmiagiano reggiano.  The only things I did differently than the recipe stated was to omit the parsley (didn't have any), sauteed the garlic in the butter as it was melting, and stirred continuously.  The sauce never separated.  We served it over fettuccine, roasted broccoli, mushrooms, and chicken.  Due to the high fat and calorie content it's definitely not going to be a frequent indulgence, but it was delicious!  Simple, tasty, and quick!!

it was really good. I will only use Parmesan, maybe because I'm Italian, but I think the sharpness of Parmesan makes it so good. It wouldn't be the same without it.

I made this with milk instead of cream. A little too  much butter and cheese. Next time I will use less but overall flavor was delicious. :)

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!  I don't know how someone said this was bland!?!  We live in Paraguay and Alfredo is almost unheard of here.  I did (out of necessity and out of preference) make some substitutions.  I have not been able to find fresh parmesan here so I used 1/2 the amount (3/4 cup) shelf-stable Kraft parmesan.  The other ingredients were easy to find here.  I also threw in a bunch of fresh diced tomatoes when I put the cream in.  The tomatoes almost tasted sun-dried this way.  Delicious!  My friend keeps asking when I am making this again.  I won't ever go back to store bought (or those good McKormick packets even)again.  This is just too good!

I made this and it turned out great, I made a few changes because I did not have everything required on hand.  For the cheese I used 1 cup parm and 1/2 cup mozzarella.   I used half and half, instead of heavy cream, and also added 1/4 cup of marinara and a small diced tomato.  My husband loved it, and says he is having dreams about it.

This is so good!  My 16 year old son loves Alfredo and the "jar" versions are so thick and pasty.  This is smooth and has an authentic Parmesan taste.  (Gotta use fresh Parmesan, makes all the difference!)

Best of all it was easy enough that he can cook it!

I normally dont put a review in the recipes that I try. But I had to for this one. I was extremely surprised by how amazing this alfredo sauce came out. So was my wife. Her exact words were " its better than the alfredo at expensive restaurants". I did not have heavy cream so I used a heavy cream substitute. Besides that I followed it to the T. It was Amazing.

Great and simple recipe.  I would suggest slowly adding the parmesan cheese a little at a time so you don't get lumps.  I set my linguini to boil at the same time I started making the sauce and they were done at the same time.

This is SO good and SO easy! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't use the full amount of parmesan cheese. It got pretty thick! But seriously tasted delicious and was super quick and easy.

I would give this recipe a 5 star! I made it exactly like the recipe, except I used dried parsley instead of fresh. It taste salty by itself, but I had it over bowtie pasta and it was perfect. Planning to make it for a wedding reception we are catering later this month.

Great recipe!  Just one thing... if you use REAL FRESH parmesan cheese... you only need 1/2 cup!  I made it with 1 1/2 cups and it was very chalky.. couldn't even eat it.  Also, the portion size only feeds 2 for me.  But we like our pasta.

I followed this recipe base except I made my own adjustments to my liking. I used 1 cup of parm cheese, 1/2 cup of romano, 1/4 cup of unsalted butter, 1 clove of garlic chopped & browned with a teaspoon of olive oil, and 8 ounces of heavy cream.

Outcome: sauce was a little salty at first. Will use fresh grated parm next time. Sauce thickened alot. This can be fixed by thinning with milk. Used 1 clove and I liked it. Was not too garlic-e. 1/4 cup of butter was perfect for this sauce, had a nice color. Will add parsley next time.

Over all I liked this recipe, thanks

Yay! Finally I found a sauce for mac 'n cheese that my picky 5 year old loves! Do try this on elbow macaroni. It's delicious. Also you don't have to have fresh parmesan. I was out and just used some Italian blend cheese from a bag. Worked fine.

This recipe is so delicious and easy to make. I never knew making alfredo sauce could be so simple. However I think I will only make it once a month because it is loaded with fat. Hope I can find a modified recipe that doesn't have so much calories.

An easy but excellent recipe! I used Kraft Italian Five Cheeses instead of straight parmesan. Also, instead of parsley I used a heaping teaspoon full of pesto sauce from the jar to ramp up the flavor.

This is AMAZING!! I does taste a lot like Olive Garden.  I was out of fresh garlic :( so I had to use garlic powder.  I also continuously whisked after adding the cream and had no seperation issues.  It went well with about 1.5 lbs of chicken and 8 oz of pasta and fed 4 people.

I double this up and use a pound of pasta...it's delicious!  I skip the parsley, but sometimes add a little grilled chicken or make chicken cutlets along side this dish.  It's my son's favorite...and he's a really hard to please 8 year old :)

wow....easy recipe....unbelievable flavor!  I used more garlic, added a tad bit of water to make the sauce go farther, and did what others suggested...used real parmasean.....much better flavor and not as salty.

This is a great simple recipe for delicious Alfredo sauce.  The fresh parsley really makes it.  I use half & half in instead of heavy cream, works fine.

This is absolutely delicious! I followed the directions exactly.  Also, I would pick a parmesan cheese that is not so salty.  I will double it the next I make it.

I tried this recipe, but did not have heavy cream.

I used whole milk but the butter and milk did not thicken.  So, I added some milk and flour and used romano and asiago cheeses.  

It did thicken after adding the milk/flour mix, but still looked funny.  I should have mixed the flour with the butter as it was heating, then added the milk and I think it would have been creamier.

Otherwise, it worked out well and was very tasty.  Oh, I neglected to put parsley in it.

I used it with the Italian Saucy Chicken Parmesan recipe which is very good  which is a great recipe, except I substituted rice for the Spaghetti.  See my comment on that recipe.

I used this sauce over bow tie pasta to accompany baked salmon and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was perfect. I finely shredded the Parmesan cheese and it melted immediately and was a very smooth sauce!

It was quick and easy to make and turned out fantastic.  I let the sauce stand for a little bit to thicken then tossed it with chicken and fettucini noodles, delicious!  Will defiantly make this again!

Wonderful recipe!  I changed a couple of things-I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream, doubled the garlic, and also added about a tablespoon of onion.  I added this great sauce to spinach, broccoli and chicken breast, then served it over whole wheat pasta. My husband loved it!  I will definitely use this versatile sauce again!

This came out amazing. I did not know what I was doing and my guests loved it. I did notice it had a bit of a kick to it and I couldn't figure out why. I followed the recipe except I think i may have put more parsley then asked for. Does this happen?

I was so disappointed with this recipe I can't even express it enough.  I am a huge cheese lover and this was just oo cheesy, tasted nothing like Olive Garden like people said.  It was more of a pasta with parmesan sauce.  Almost like a mac and cheese and way too salty.  INcredibly sad about it.  Will try a recipe with way less cheese next time.

This is a simple and excellent recipe.  Keep it around if you need something fast a delicious when people show up unexpectedly, or anytime.  I tried substituting low fat and skim milk (separate times) for cream, and margarine for butter.  Although they were OK (the sauce tended to clump more with the substitutes), and probably had fewer calories, the full recipe is much better in flavor and texture.

I made this and my whole family loved it. It is quite rich but still very yummy. I had to substitute powdered parmesan cheese because that's what I happened to have on hand but my ultra picky 9 year old who NEVER tries anything new loved it :)

Wish there was a ten star option! Its a great recipe. I did a lil over a quarter cup margarine, one can of evaporated milk, then followed the rest of the recipe. Oh, I like my sauces thick so I added a bit of flour, which I wouldnt have needed to! The recipe is just great the way it is! THank you for such a simple sauce recipe I can make with a toddler and an infant in the kitchen with me.

This is a great recipe! I followed it as written and it was amazing. It was easy, quick, inexpensive and really delicious. I put it on about 1/2lb of fettuccine (it was 1/2lb before cooked) and it looked and tasted like a million bucks! A favorite dish from our local Italian restaurant is fettuccine Alfredo and this was spot on. I love adding dishes to our home repertoire that are as good as going out! Thank you so much for sharing!

4.5 stars My husband loved this and I have made it several times now he refuses to eat jar sauce any more :)  I am still having trouble getting the gritty texture out but I just add chicken to it and that helps off set the texture. It may just be the cheese I'm using.

This was so simple to make and what a hit!!!  I added 1 lb cubed chicken and 1 lb crispy bacon.  Stretched out the recipe and made everyone go back for more.

Easy & better than restaurants.  We also use a combination of Parmesan, Gruyere and Asiago cheeses....and sometimes substitute/mix half & half for the heavy cream depending on what's in house.  Italian parsley can add a nice touch vs. regular bunch parsley.  Awesome!

This has a spectacular clear flavor from the Parmesan Cheese, and the cream gives it a very rich texture, but I would recommend a little water as the sauce tends to get a little pasty.

Excellent!! I doubled recipe.  I then added in a few tbsp. of flour to thicken the sauce.  I also added in a few squeezes of fresh lemon, 2 pinches of nutmeg, & a handful of crumbled goat cheese that melted right into sauce to make it rich & creamy.

I FOUND THAT BY CUTTING BACK ON THE CHEESE TO JUST 1 CUP, IT TURNS OUT SOOOO MUCH BETTER!  SAUCE BECOMES A LITTLE THINNER (IN A GOOD WAY) AND NOT AS OVERBEARINGLY RICH.

This is wonderful for a base recipe. -I use one sprinkle of garlic powder instead of a clove. -I use dried parsley. -I add all my ingredients at once and it works just fine. ALSO i add mozzarella to the sauce too!

OMG to die for, absolutely phenomenal!!!! I usually use the quick & easy alfredo sauce on this site because I don't normally have heavy cream on hand but I had some leftover from something I had made & wanted to use it up. It was the BEST alfredo sauce I've ever made! Tasted restaurant quality & wasn't runny like the other sauce I use. I think I may buy cream for this & toss my other recipe from now on! I used the sauce on some fettuccine & mixed in some chicken & broccoli that I stir fried in olive oil.  Delicious dinner :-)

The Recipe was out of this world. I made this with some Salmon that I grilled for my wife for mother's day and she was VERY impressed. I messed up and used Kraft Grated Parmesan istead of using freshy parmesan but that was my fault. It still was amazing. I can't wait to make this again the right way. It went very well the the Salmon and aparagus. Huge Hit. I wouldn't know about how the leftovers were because there weren't any. Easy to make, cheap, and full of flavor.

I used processed parm. cheese.  I thought the sauce tasted just like store bought alfredo sauce.  I would add some more spices to add some flavour next time.

The sauce was super easy to make. My husband loves it? To me, the cheese was kind of gritty. I whisked it a lot over heat to melt the cheese, but it seemed really hard to melt. But it had a nice taste

Very good sauce. I did take some advice and used the Parmesan with romano grated cheese (they come together in a jar).

I loved this pasta sauce.  I must say, I have never been this successful at alfredo before!  I even had to sub cheddar for the parm and it was amazing!  Yummyyyyy!

This is such an easy recipe and the end product is great.  I substituted dried parsley simply because I had it and also only used 1 cup of Parmesan cheese instead of 1 1/2 cups and was still wonderful.  My wife is a huge alfredo fan so for her to love it, made it even better.  Thanks

Tried this with my family the other night and everyone loved this sauce.  Its so easy to make.  I did add a couple more cloves of garlic for extra flavor and passed extra grated cheese at the table, but overall can't find anything negative to say about this recipe.  This will become a regular meal for us!

This is so far from real Alfredo sauce it is crazy. You need to make a rue first, 3 tbsp butter same flower. Also gruyere cheese is needed and no garlic.

I and my husband love this sauce! Here is my rendition to this wonderful recipe: instead of heavy cream I used carnation canned milk..and then I add  canned boneless pink salmon once the mixture is cooked...pour over whole wheat spaghetti and you have a delicious meal!!!

Easy and delicious.  I only had a 1/2 cup of heavy cream, so I used 2% milk for the other 1/2 cup and it turned out great.

Wow, could this be any easier? I won't buy jarred sauce again!  I used half-and-half because that's what I had in the fridge, added dashes of garlic powder (not garlic salt) in hopes of getting a smoother sauce, a pinch of nutmeg and some freshly ground black pepper.  I agree with the other posters that the butter used should be unsalted because Parm. is salty enough, but it was still delish!  Because my shredded Parm. didn't melt down smoothly, I decided to tell my family this was a "rustic" Alfredo sauce, LOL!  But it still tasted amazing, especially over the mushroom ravioli I served it with.

This recipe was yummy! I only had half and half and so I used that instead of the cream and it worked out perfectly! In fact, it was even a little thick so I ended up adding a little bit of milk. It's also good with chicken and a little can of drained mushrooms. Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed all the tips that people made, but it wasn't the greatest. I needed to double the receipe, but I found it to be way too salty and as hard as I tried I could not get the sauce to be smooth.  The parm made it course and dry. I used the suggestion of using Milk instead of cream, which I was glad about because it was so rich. I think next time I may reduce the amount of parm or try the other cheese suggested.

The BEST alfredo sauce I have found yet. This is a keeper for sure! I will never buy jar sauce again. I used this sauce for chicken and broccoli pizza(white). Now that I've found this, I will be using this recipe for all of my alfredo meals. The only thing that I did change was that I added maybe a half cup of freshly grated Asiago cheese and a cup of shredded parmesan and added that in small portions to the sauce. I thought it was too thin and that was the reason I added a little more than what the recipe called for. The taste was so yummy and the consistency was absolutely perfect! The timer just went off so my hubby and I can finally test this pizza out. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe :)

Easy and very tasty.  I didn't have parsley so I changed it for fresh spinach.  I used the the hard parmeson cheese.  My husband commented that this is much better than the grocery store jars.

Delish!  My husband said he would order this at a restaurant.  My kids loved it too.  I didn't have a problem with the parmesan cheese melting but I will try it next time as you suggested with the gruyere cheese.

Good as a base, but needs more seasons. I didn't have any problems with it being to thin or the cheese not melting right. Next time, I will add sundried tomatoes and baby spinach

I loved this sauce. The flavor was great, as well as the consistancy. My husband said it was the best alfredo he's ever eaten. I also added grilled italian sausage to the pasta, so it was just the right balance. Next time I will add a tad bit more of all the ingredients in order to make a bit more sauce, as there wasn't a whole lot for the two of us.

Yummy!  I made this last night for the family, and it was a big hit!  My husband went back for seconds, and my daughter finished her plate (both are a rarity).  Since some complained it was not very flavorful, I doubled the garlic and added some italian seasoning with the cheese.  I also served with chicken breast strips that were seasoned similarly and dredged in flour.  The sauce looked a little lumpy but still tasted smooth.  I think it's because I used shredded cheese from the deli instead of grated (it's what I had on hand).

Great flavour! Although I personally found it to be a little heavy. I ate 2 servings of pasta, so I basically ate a 3/4 cup of cheese, 2 tbsp of butter and half a cup of heavy cream... o__O

I was EXTREMELY disappointed. The flavor was bland. You could barely taste the garlic or the parsley because the milk taste was overwhelming. It never thickened up. It was watery and thin. Will not be making again. :( After all the good reviews I thought I had an easy, simple recipe but now I am just disappointed.

This recipe is fantastic!  Very rich though so we don't make it too often.  I tried to add more cheese and it didn't mix well so make sure to follow the recipe well.  We always grill chicken breasts and add to the top of our alfredo. YUM!

It is good and easy to make, I doubled the garlic and I thought that was too much. Next time I make it, I will stick with the one clove.

The sauce had a really good flavor and the whole family loved it. The reason I only scored it a 4 is because it was way too thick and stringy. I think next time I will try using milk instead of the cream. Thank you for the recipe.

Good, easy alfredo recipe. I added the minced garlic right into the melted butter in the first step.  If you're not a huge garlic fan this is an easy way to cook the garlic down some.  Using fresh grated parmesan definitely makes the difference and helps with the thickening.  That Kraft stuff just won't do it!  Awesome recipe!

Loved it! Only thing I don't like about it is how sticky it is. Used dried basil from my garden instead of fresh parsley. We have already made it twice this week! (86)

Really good and extremely easy.  This was the first time I had made alfredo sauce from scratch.  Wanted to make something slightly fancier when having last minute dinner guests.  I had Romano cheese already on hand so I used that instead of Parmesan.  Also used the parsley in a tube which made it all extremely easy.  Turned out great and got rave reviews from our guests.

personally my follow of this recipe came out nothing like the picture. the solids to liquid ratio is completely off because the sauce turned into a dough looking ball in my pan. i had to add milk, which is an unlisted ingredient, to try to doctor up and smooth out my ball. definitely continuing my search for a homemade alfrado recipe.

Based on the previous reviews, I thought this alfredo sauce would be amazing!  I was very disappointed :(....Maybe it was me, but my sauce turned out very chunky/gritty from the fresh parmesan cheese.  I was very careful to add it slowly and stir, stir, stir, but it just didn't work out.  My hubby, who is happy to eat whatever I put in front of him wouldn't even finish it!

Eh, I'm not sure why people are raving about this.  The parmesan cheese didn't melt (and there's zero chance I'm subbing a non-authentic cheese!) and it was lumpy.  It also only makes TWO servings, not four, so that was a huge disappointment when I didn't have enough sauce for 4 servings of pasta.  I will used fresh powdered parmesan if I try this recipe again, but I probably won't.

I thought this was a wonderful base sauce. I saute some portabella mushrooms and zuchinni in butter and set aside. Then I cooked shrimp with a little olive oil and old bay seasoning and set aside also. I made the alfredo sauce exactly as the recipe states and then combined all ingredients together. I served over angel hair pasta. I like this pasta better bc it really holds onto the sauce. Make sure you whisk the sauce for the whole 5 min so it doesn't seperate. This is a keeper!

As a beginning amateur cook, I was looking for a very basic and easy alfredo recipe.  This one was great.  It was easy and simple.  My only problem, and remember, I am a beginner, was I couldn't get the cheese to melt all the way.  I ended up with a slightly chunky sauce.  It still tasted amazing though.

My hubby and I were craving fett. alfredo late last night.  We were just about to order from a local Italian place down the street when I realized that I have all the ingredients to make myself.  It was really good.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream because that is what I had and it is better for you. I also used fresh ramano cheese.  I stired the whole time with a fork to make sure the cheese melted and did not come out grainy.  The texture was PERFECT!  I served with fett. noodles and garlic cheese bread to sop up the sauce...YUMMY!  I would suggest to serve right away cus it gets really thick and would need more cream/milk in order for it to become thin enough to serve.  I will for sure make this again on those nights I can't figure out what to cook

This was a real treat.  Better than at a restuarant. I don't ever rate recipes, but I felt I had to because it was so good.  I didnt change a single thing.  I used it with orzo pasta.  The calorie count is frightening, but it was so worth it every once in awhile.

This had WAY TOO MUCH garlic. My house still stinks this morning. The cheese was grainy and kind of clumpy. Not good.

OMG this recipe for Alfredo Sauce was SSSOOO good the whole family loved it. It was fast & easy. the only thing I did differently was i used evaporated milk because i did not have heavy cream but it was still very good. The consistency of the sauce was just right. Olive Garden watch out I have a Sauce that is better than yours now.

SO good, it actually tastes like the Olive Garden! I added 1/4 tsp basil and a pinch of nutmeg and left out the parsley. I used Kraft grated parm but can see how fresh would melt better.. soo good!

This was easy and tasted fantastic! I used margarine, garlic powder, parsley flakes, and a 2-cup package of Great Value shredded cheese that was an 'Italian' mix: mozzarella, parmesan, and several others. It melted just fine.

I didn't have parmesan so I used mozzerella and it came out okay.  Next time I won't use fresh garlic, but garlic powder only.  The fresh garlic was way too strong and ruined the taste.  The garlic doesn't blend well on simmer.  The other option would be to fry the garlic in the butter before adding the cream.

Very good recipe.  I sauteed the garlic and a shallot with the butter and then added a splash of white wine for a little extra flavor but other than that it was perfect and very easy to make.  The parmesan melted just fine for me.

Very easy to make! I have made it with both ways with shred or can parmesan. (Kraft) Also, I added minced garlic to the butter while it was melting. When the sauce was thicking,  I added chopped cooked bacon and dried parsley. (all I had) Served with rotini noodles.. Family enjoyed it!!! YUMMY! Will def make again!

Unfortunately, I didn't have fresh parmesan on hand so I had to use the stuff out of the green container. It was still better than the jarred stuff. I did add some pepper while simmering the cream. I also took the advice of a previous poster and whisked the cream and butter continuously. Very yummy.

i just had to write a review!!!! this was soooooooo good!!! i was so skeptical about cooking it but i am sooo happy i did. me and my fiance loved it!!!!!! i doubled the recipe. the only thing i suggest is a lil less garlic. this time since i doubled the recipe i used 2 cloves of garlic which left an after taste so next time i will only add 1 clove for a double recipe. if u love garlic keep the recipe as is!!! the only other thing i changed was i used parmesan and ramona cheese and it was perfect!!! will cook again for sure!!!!!!

I followed the directions to a T. I'm giving this a 2 just because the flavor was not too bad, HOWEVER the consistency was terrible! The sauce was watery and the cheese was actually chunky - certainly not the creamy sauce I was hoping for. When the sauce began cooling, the chunky cheese became rubbery!

I just made this sauce tonight and it was delicious!  It was really simple to make, and it was great over fettuccine and grilled chicken.  I substituted grated romano cheese for the parmesan and it was very tasty.

this Alfredo was great as is! I did not have parsley but other wise made exactly as written. It would be really good if you add some mushrooms or broccoli. I will definitely make this again easy, fast, and soooo good!

What a hit!  A house full of teens showed up and I didn't know what to do about dinner.  I had three chicken breasts...and 11 hungry teens!  I tried this recipe, sauted the chicken...added some noodles and voila!  They raved about it!  Hubby came home from work and I made it fresh for him... he couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  My variation, since I used what was here, was half and half with a little starch and grated three blend italian cheese with garlic and oregano.  AWESOME!  I made it later following this recipe and it was just amazing!

If you saute the garlic in the butter the flavor is released better and no "chunks" are left. Super delicious

I have been trying forever to find a great tasting alfredo and finally hit the nail on the head.  I followed this recipe exactly and it came out creamy and rich.  Tastes just as good as the Olive Gardens.

It was just alright. I added some dry white wine to add some more flavor to it, which helped a little. I'll keep trying for a better alfredo sauce.

I found that I had to add a bit of milk to thin the sauce out a tad, but it tastes delightful. I served it with potato gnocchi, with molten choclate cupcakes for dessert.

This was okay. I thought it had kind of a weird tang to it though. I followed the recipe exactly. My husband loves alfredo and says he would much rather have the jar sauce that I usually get. Got to agree with him, the jar sauce we get tastes better and doesn't have as much work. Won't be making again, but thanks anyway.

This was my first time making anything from scratch as I am eighteen and just got a place with my boyfriend and daughter. My boyfriend and I LOVE anything Alfredo.  We both thought it was amazing. I added about a fourth of a cup of Parmesan to it and a half a pound of shrimp. I did not understand why I would have to put a whole 1/4 of a cup of parsley so I just put about a tablespoon. It was enough. IT WAS BEYOND AMAZING! This will have to definitely be saved and made quite often.

Started by sautaying the garlic. I then made a buchmel by adding some flower to the melted butter & so that it'd be thicker because I only had 2% milk. I then added about 2 cups milk and did the rest of the rescipe. It was delicious, but don't make too thick of a buchmel (I did the first time) or you'll just have to thin it down even more and end up with WAY too much sauce. Not that that's a horrible thing...  Anyway- great! Delicious.

Excellent recipe.  We added pancetta (cooked in a pan and added at the end to the sauce to quickly reheat) and served over strozzapreti noodles - was wonderful, great recipe!

Awesome, fast & easy!  I used 3/4 shredded bag Parm and it was great.  Added shrimp, peas and used ramen noodles- voila!  Dinner in 15 minutes!  I'll never buy jarred sauce again.

This was amazing! I didn't have any fresh parm on me, so I used an Italian six cheese blend, which worked out pretty well. When I first added the cheese I was worried that it would be too much like a stringy ball of cheese so I added a bit of half and half (I'd used up all of the heavy cream), and it smoothed out nicely. : ) I also added salf and pepper and a bit of garlic powder, because it had a weird aftertaste (though I blame the cheese for that). Afterward, it tasted perfect. Great recipe. : )

This is a great base to start from.  Thanks for the post.   Personally I wanted more of a garlic flavor.  So next time I'll dice the the crushed garlic and then lightly pan fry it while the butter is melting.  This way the oils from the garlic start to come out sooner and can infuse into the cream while it is simmering.   Also I found that dried parsley is fine, but of course doesn't have as big of a punch as fresh parsley.

This is just what I wanted. Rich and creamy and delicious. I didn't change a thing and it was perfect, oh except I added black pepper. This is how I will make my alfredo sauce from now on! Thank you!

I found this bland, as others have mentioned.  While it may taste like Olive Garden's sauce, I find OG's sauce bland as well.  Should have stuck to my own recipe or found one with more flavor.  Sorry.  Mixed well with the Marsala sauce I made for the meat, though.  I will give it that.

This is excellent.  I use a little more garlic and I use dried parsley.  Everyone loves is.  This is a great date meal.  I serve it with blackened chicken breast and broccoli florets over linguine.

This is as good as it gets. I've used this recipe over and over again. I like to add pieces of chicken for a bit heavier meal. It's a really good sauce.

This was super easy and great tasting. I substituted half a cup of the plain cheese for herbed cheese and that helped kick up the flavor.  It was delicious!

Yum. Made as written with addition of 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and some white pepper. Tasty and delicious, the cheese did fine melting in since it was in tiny chunks from the food processor. Served with steamed brocolli. Appreciate not having to use egg. Hurray for heart-attack food at home! Thanks!

Very easy to make. I used 2% milk simmered to thicken, instead of the high caloric heavy cream. I cut back on butter and add olive oil, salt and pepper to taste added garlic and parmesan cheese. It was still very good. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is the best! I only make it 1-2 times/month because of the fat content, but my family loves it. I give them a choice of either homemade mac and cheese, or homemade alfredo. They choose the alfredo every time! I usually double the recipe and use a pound of shell pasta, it's easier for the kiddos to eat. I use the shredded parmesan that comes in the bags...the recipe says 1 1/2 cups and the bag is only 1 1/4 cups...but it always works out. I use a wire whisk and it usually takes about 5 minutes or so to melt all the way. It is a very quick sauce. Just make sure your water for the pasta is boiling before you start the sauce...otherwise you will be "tasting" the sauce by the spoonfuls while you are waiting for the pasta to cook! :)

WOW! I have tried alot of different Alfredo recipes, but this is the BEST ever! I did what someone else recommended...used Asiago cheese. So it end up 2/3 grated cheese & 1/3 Asiago Cheese (a perfect blend).  Also my family loves garlic, so I added an extra clove.  I poured it over Fettuccini noodles (of course the longer it sits, the thicker it becomes). We had leftovers. So the next day, I made more sauce and took it to work. Each person poured it over there own portion of noodles, which made it even creamier. All anyone could say was "It's the bomb!" Needless to say, I have copied this recipe for everyone in the office.  Thanks Rebecca Swift for your submission!

I cut this recipe down to one serving for myself and it was delicious! The main reason I tried this recipe was because of the fresh garlic listed. I preferred the taste of this sauce 100% more than the ones using garlic powder. I also upped the garlic a bit. I ran short on Parmesan cheese so I added in shredded Cheddar cheese to make up the rest. It was basically 2 parts Parmesan, 1 part Cheddar. It was wonderfully cheesy with the tang from the Parmesan. This is my new "go-to" Alfredo Sauce. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

Yum.  I added bacon, brocoli, frozen spinach and fresh cherry tomatoes with ravoli.  Make sure to microplane the garlic so it infuses really well with no big chunks.

This was easy and very good.  Only diff was I put the garlic into the melted butter (then added cream and simmered) so the garlic would flavor the sauce more and also subdue a bit.  Also, I didn't have enough fresh grated parm so I used 1/2 fresh grated and 1/2 of the powdered kind which wound up making the sauce way too thick (like a fondue).  But more cream and butter solved the problem.  Can't wait to try some of the other reviewers' lower cal versions! !

Excellent recipe! Taste, easy and fast preparation. I use other cheeses too mixed with Parmesan, because it melts easier.  Once you try this sauce, you will start complain about other Alfredo sauce in Restaurants...  Simple the Best.

I found this to be an ok recipe. It tasted a bit bland, but not too bad. I also had a hard time getting the cheese to melt, so the texture was a bit off. However, I would probably try it again, but add more garlic and some pepper.

Very easy and very tasty! I added an extra clove of garlic because we're garlic junkies and a generous batch of freshly ground pepper plus about a cup of shredded marble cheese with the parma as we didn't have enough parma. It was awesome!

Absolutely a cinch to make and so creamy. Since I was using this only as a dipping sauce for some toasted ravioli, I cut the recipe in half (but used a whole clove of garlic still). I subbed asiago cheese for the parmesan, since I have a huge big bag of it in my freezer I need to use up, and it worked great. I would really have a hard time using so much fresh parmesan, because the good stuff is soo expensive (and I only buy the good stuff)! I will make this again.

really great sauce!  i made it with shrimp and doubled the recipe... used 2 cups of kraft grated parmesan instead of 3 just because i didn't have enough, but it still tasted great... also added mushrooms and a 1/4 of chopped onion.  definitely going to use it again!

It was awesome! However whn i cook, i consider health n carlorie. Therefore i made low-fat version f alfredo sauce instead f using heavy cream. I used the mixture f 1/2 c 1/2&1/2 n1/2 c skim milk. To thicken the sauce, i added 2-3TBL flour n whisked with the butter melted since i knw tht the mixture wouldnt b as thick as the cream. Try2 make the sauce with it coz it would b guitiless n better4 u!! I also added a pinch of nutmeg n used gruyere cheese. WONDERFUL!!!!! Hope u enjoy this sauce without guilt.

I thought this was pretty good and it was very easy. I quadrupled the garlic and sauteed first in a little oil, and also added a good dose of black pepper. My family enjoyed it quite a bit. My 7-year old doesn't normally like alfredo sauce, but he did like this one.

This was my first attempt at making Alfredo Sauce and it turned out great! I loved the simplicity and taste.  I did make just a few changes. I used evaporated milk instead of heavy whipping cream and I tripled the garlic. I love garlic, but was surprised my family couldn't taste the garlic. I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I used dry parsley. I added my shredded parmesan cheese to the sauce bit by bit as it melted, to prevent clumping. I also added sautéed chopped mushrooms to the sauce. I poured this over farfalle pasta, and cooked broccoli florets, asparagus tips, carrots and chicken. It was very tasty and my family still got their veggies. My family gives this a 4.5!

very good just the way it was written!  i doubled the recipe and added 1 1/2 lb of chicken.  ***note*** this recipe portion sizes are a bit off.  when doubled, it only served 6, not 8.  i had to make more sauce for our noodles.

First off, I used Amish butter from Wisconsin to make this recipe. I did everything as stated, tasted the result, and was not very pleased. So, I used Janpie's advice and added 1 more cup of heavy cream, 1/2 cup of milk, and a little bit of chives. Husband brought back a WHOLE BUNCH of cheese from Wisconsin so I added a thick slice of Butter Kase. Topped off with more parmesan and I had a winner!

This recipe tastes awesome, and I did make a few changes.  I added a little garlic salt and nutmeg for more flavor.  I, too, had the problem of the cheese not melting.  I used my hand blender to blend it and it smoothed and thickened right up...you need to try this recipe!

My husband and I like the sauce, but our kids did not. My picky eater said, "Mom! What's wrong with the noodles!" I don't make pre-packaged noodles... I'll make it again for us, something different for them. Thanks for the recipe.

This was too yummy.  I added half a cup of chicken and broccoli and followed advice of some of the others - i used a cup of milk and margarine. Delicious.

This was a lifesaver! We were having guest for dinner and were planning to have spaghetti and at the last minute I learned that one of the guests was allergic to tomatoes!! So I fixed this with some sauteed chicken for her and it was a hit. I had the leftovers for lunch the next day, it wasn't pretty because of course all the ingredients separated but it still tasted fine. I liked this a lot better than any of the store bought alfredo sauces I've tried.

This sauce was just a little too rich for us. It was very good, but I could not have had seconds. My children ate everything that I gave them though so it is definatly a keeper. I made some grilled chicken to go with it and served with green beans.

Wow!  Very good sauce.  I made a few changes.  I used Italian seasoning instead of parsley and used to cloves of garlic.  Also I lessoned the cheese by 1/4 cup.  All in all very good.

This is a very easy recipe and does not take long to make at all. I didn't have cream so I used milk with a butter and flour rue to thicken it a little. It is a little bland but it is also easy to customize. I put some sundried tomatoes in my mom's portion and some sauteed mushrooms and spinach in mine and it was great. I also added a little bit of cream cheese to make it creamier and help thicken it a bit.

The pasta was already cooking and YIKES I'm out of spaghetti sauce! I whipped this up in no time and the family loved it!  I added minced garlic and onion since it was already prepared... was a great compliment.  Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe is very good.  And its very easy to make.  It took me longer to cook the pasta than to make the sauce.  I served it with some steamed broccoli and grilled chicken breast.  It's a fast recipe for a weeknight meal.  I agree with other reviews that the key to a smooth sauce is whisking nearly constantly.  And fresh grated Parmesan is essential.

Quick and simple! Didn't have cream so I used sour cream which turned out delectable! Grated the cheese extra fine so there would be no problems with the cheese melting.  Only problem was I didn't cook the rigatoni long enough!  The sauce made up for it tho!

So delicious! I doubled the recipe for a large crew and had to use half shredded parmesan and half grated parmesan so it wasnt quite as smooth as it could have been but it was a big hit! Will use this one every time.

I think this recipe is pretty good and flavorful for how simple it is.  I used grated parm from a jar and it worked well, fresh would have been better but I only had the jar cheese on hand.  I also used dried parsley instead of fresh and jarred minced garlic, and a lot of it.  I used things I had on hand so all I had to buy was the cream. The sauce was a little clumpy and not as thick as I would have liked but it tasted great and was cheap and easy.

I added a bit too much parmesan and parsley. Also, I substituted half and half cream, added mushrooms, and used 2 cloves of garlic. Hopefully it will taste better next time I make it :)

Of all the alfredo recipes I've tried, this was the family's favorite so far.  The fresh cut pasta probably helped!  I used dried parsely instead of fresh.

Followed the recipe to a T. Looked great and thickened nicely.Unfortunately it was a flop. I did purchase the best parm-reg cheese you could get and it was way to overpowering.
Next time I think I'll try to mix the cheeses.

I doubled this one, but used only 1 cup of shredded parmesan. It turned out wonderful. Served it with shrimp scampi which we just ended up mixing in with our pasta and sauce. So delicious. No leftovers.

This recipe was easy and very good. I made a few changes to it. I used light cream and I used part parmesan cheese and part colby monterey jack. This was very good and I plan to make this again next week.

Pretty good.  I did make one change, adding a dollop of cream cheese (since I'd seen it  included in so many other highly-rated Alfredo recipes).  I'll try several other Alfredo recipes before I settle on just one.

WOW!  Easy, simple and restaurant quality.
I prepped the sauce one day before and heated it up....still awesome.
(Don't delute to reheat---waters it down)
It really coats the noodle.
Make sure you wisk the sauce until the cheese melts to a velvety finish.
Awesome.  Different cheeses work well.

This recipe was a great start! My husband and I didn't really care for the taste of the Parmesan cheese so we replaced it with Gruyere cheese sometimes adding a bit of mozzerella. Gives it a bit more "nutty flavor."

Tip: Make sure you heat the cheese very slowly on low heat otherwise it will result in a grainy texture in the sauce.

First time making alfredo sauce and this was a good receipe.  I didn't have cream so I melted the butter and added a couple of tablespoons of flour to make a rue.  Then added milk instead of cream-a little garlic powder and lots of pepper.  So much better than the stuff in the jar at the store!!

Very easy to make, and my brothers loved it. I did increase the parm cheese and added a tbsp of flour early in the recipe to increase thickness. If you reheat this, it will separate, just have a whisk handy. Haven't tried it with Gruyere yet, but I am definitely going to make this again.

Really? This is very plain and doesn't taste a lot like alfredo sauce. All I could taste was parmesan. To try to make it taste a little better I added 1/4 c herb and garlic cream cheese and salt and pepper. It was good with the modifications... the way it was written produces a very boring taste.

This is a classic alfredo sauce recipe.  We loved it.  I didn't have heavy cream, so I used light sour cream instead. Was how I remembered my father making it. Yummy!

This sauce was great.  My cheese didn't melt all the way even though I did use shredded instead of grated, so I put it in the blender and blended it for a minute or two (before adding the parsley).  That made it smoother which just looked better in my opinion.  I also used 3 cloves of garlic instead of one.

This recipe was so easy!  I am so glad I found this recipe.  It is definitely too rich to become an everyday recipe, but was perfect for my husband's birthday dinner.  He was very impressed!  

I doubled the recipe, which worked nicely.  I used about 8 cloves of garlic, but I put a ton of garlic in everything.  I added a pound of cooked shrimp at the end.  Dee-lish!  Thanks so much for sharing a great recipe.  It is a keeper!

Wow, this was both easy and delicious! I used half-and-half, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I think it was very tasty, but not restaurant quality. I also think there was way too much parsley, and I will half the parsley next time. I served this with 'chicken scampi' from this site, and it was a hit! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is one of my absolute favorite takes on Alfredo. I added a lot of pepper (because that's how I like it, not because it was bland) and a little bit of mozzarella cheese to convince everything to melt well.

For a lower calorie/fat option, I used 2% milk instead of cream, and only a third of the required Parmesan cheese.  I used salted margarine, and when I tasted it after adding a third of the cheese, it seemed done.  Very delicious.  I've had problems getting the cheese to melt smoothly, but this alfredo sauce came out  silky.  Five stars because it was easy to modify and get a great result.

I love the richness of a good alfredo sauce.  Over the past several years I have tried several different recipes that I haven't been wowed by. Last night I made this one...WOW!  It turned out great, very rich and creamy just like it should be.  I didn't have heavy cream so I just used milk after melting the butter and some flour together.  I poured it over shell pasta (that's what my littler kids like the most) and add chicken that I cooked up.  
Thanks for the great recipe!

Quick, EASY, and yummy. Couldn't ask for better! I like it so much because it's not too buttery and not too cheesy.

It's an okay sauce in my opinion. The thing I really didn't like is the fact that when I left it in the fridge, the pasta harden and I could barely scoop it out. not only that but when I reheated, all the butter seemed to separate from it and it was just gross.

This was pretty good. All I had on hand was the "Kraft Green Can" (gasp!) and some pecorino romano cheese...so I used the pecorino. I also added some shrimp that I sauteed in butter and garlic. I think I found my new alfredo recipe.

This was excellent! I'm giving it 5 stars, even though I added fresh Crimini mushrooms sauteed separatley with vermouth and black pepper, out of preference. I used freshly grated Parmesan/Romano cheese. Gruyere would be great also. This is a fabulous basic recipe for Alfredo! Thank you, Rebecca.

This was really good! I may cut the amt of cheese down to 1 1/4c rather than the 1 1/2. I used the shredded parmesan, and it didn't melt very well. Cooking it too high will burn it! constant stirring is a must. I may experiment w/ less cheese next time. Good recipe though!

This recipe is so good!! I made this last night and asked my husband to BBQ some chicken to put in it and he didn't realize that the chicken was for this recipe so he put BBQ sauce on it. I thought it would make the alfrado sauce bad but it gave it a really good twist. So if you like this recipe but want a different take on it add some BBQ chicken with BBQ sauce. Very good!!

I've been making this for years now and it is my go to alfredo sauce recipe.  Sometimes the Parmesan cheese can be difficult to melt so you have to whisk it a lot, but otherwise super easy and fantastic recipe!

OH MAN.....it was way to much cheese ! You can tell the flavor is there but its masked behind the giant cheese blast. We doubled the recipe to make alot of sauce... i will make it again...like i said the flavor is for sure there. Next time I am going to hlf the amount of cheese. Oh yea, added more garlic also like the others said. It was very good and we will make it again...just not going to add the entire amount of cheese. thanks for shareing tips !!

I think it's safe to say I knocked the socks off my boyfriend with this recipe.  It was EXCELLENT!  I followed the directions exactly using fresh parsley but wondered if dried would make any difference.  At any rate this was a quick and restuarant quality dish!

May 2008: This is THE PERFECT recipe! I have tried many because we all love alfredo but my husband is allergic to many preservatives in store bought or mixes.  This turned out perfect and my husband LOVED it as did my kids. I could take or leave the parsely, and I did one cup of parmesan and 1/2 of romano ~ not too heavy on the garlic ~ with some fresh ground pepper. It is perfect! Thank you!

This is the best Alfredo Sauce I have found in recipe form. It still does not stand against the Olive Garden. I really do like this sauce though. I followed the recipe exactly even using Kraft Parmesean cheese. I used this with  the Resteraunt Style Chicken Scampi recipe by Julie, and it was wonderful! You just can't find a good alfredo sauce in the grocery store, and this one is an Awesome alternative

I followed the directions but the cheese would not melt with the sauce and clumped together at the bottom. I'll stick to store bought jars in the future.

Awesome Recipe. I mixed some oregano seasoning and basil leaves and the usual veggies incl celery. Dont add pesto, that makes the taste too strong and overshadows the pasta. So i had tomato, green peppers, finely chopped onions, finely chopped celery, mushrooms and broccoli. Oh Dont forget the prawns.

Very nice, but my husband brought home pecorino and it came out WAY too salty.  I would add that folks should use unsalted butter as well...(which I discovered the hard way but most people might know already).

my husband and i both loved the flavor, made a few modifications: it got really thick after whisking in the parmesan so i added about 1/2 c more cream (i may not have been using the right stuff though; i couldn't find "heavy cream" so i used "whipping cream"); also, i didn't have fresh Parmesan this time, but the other reviewers are 100% correct - only use fresh...the KRAFT types leave the finished sauce very grainy. very easy, very worth it - never buying the kind in a jar again!

I thought the flavor was okay. However, the consistency was not. Didn't blend together well, had little gritty pieces, but maybe that was something I did wrong. My husband, who loves the Olive Garden's alfredo, did not care for this. Won't be making this again.

Everyone seemed to like this recipe. The only thing I did different was add fresh basil. The cheese took awhile to melt but you just have to be patient and keep stirring until it does melt. The end result was worth it.

I made this with the Mushroom Chicken Parmesan from this site along with fettuccine.  Together I give it fours stars, but each recipe on their own would probably get two stars from me.  As recommended I used freshly grated Parmegiano Reggiano and the cheese flavor was a little too much for me, so if I try this recipe again I will either cut down on the cheese or use the canned parmesan cheese. UPDATE: I made this again using the little green can instead of fresh parmesan and it was 100% better!  I would now give this recipe 5 stars on it's own.

I know from the revues that most people love this recipe.  I did not like it - it is too thick, I don't like the taste and it is lumpy.  I was disappointed.

The main reason I wanted to make fresh alfredo sauce is because the jarred versions in the store always have an odd/tangy taste to them that I can't describe.  I wanted to see if I could make some fresh alfredo from scratch. 
This recipe turned out pretty good.  I found that with all the parmesan the alfredo was a little bit on the salty side.  Also, if left sitting for too long after you pour it over the noodles it sort of separates, hardens a little.  Not sure how to alleviate that issue.  I did not have any parsley so I just tossed some basil with it.  I would make this again but need to figure out how to get rid of the over saltiness taste.

Very tasty!  I served this as a dipping sauce for toasted ravioli (from this site)and herbed dill french bread from the breadmachine.  My husband that seldom compliments a meal even said he enjoyed it(his usual response when I ask him if he enjoyed dinner is "I'm not picky").  Definitely a keeper!

I cannot say too much for this great recipe that fits my white lasagne recipe to perfection. Think about adding "nutmeg" to perfect it.All my family and friends ask me for it!

This recipie turned out really good for me, I had no problems with it separating. I did add the garlic at the same time I was melting the butter right at the begining. I tossed the sauce with spinach cheese tortillini and shrimp and it was a big hit. Way better than jar sauce and super easy!

We tried this recipe tonight, and for a little twist added some lemon juice. The only thing I wasn't thrilled with was that the sauce didn't turn out as thick as I thought it might. Otherwise, it was incredibly tasty!

Seems like a good recipe, but it had waaaaaaaaaaay too much Parmesan. I'm not sure where I went wrong, since I followed the recipe exactly. I will try to make this again, but using half the amount of cheese, as another reviewer recommended. Maybe then it will be a 5 star recipe!

Too much Parmesan cheese which makes for a very thick sauce. I cut it down by about a half. Otherwise very simple and tasty. I also add some spinach to make it a bit healthier. ;)

This was so delicious and so EASY! I didn't have any parsley, so omitted that. I used 1/2 parm and 1/2 asiago cheeses. Whisked the entire cook time and it came out smooth, thick and delicious.

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST ALFREDO SAUCE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!  Instead of just plain alfredo sauce i added some fresh broccoli and some grilled chicken to it!!!  Instead of just Parmesan cheese we used a little Asiago cheese blend too!  It was so yummy!!

This is a good alfredo recipe, but I wouldn't add in a whole clove, I did the first time, and it tasted like nothing but garlic. I use the shredded Parmesan cheese, and it comes out fine with no separation.

This was really good. The Parmesan was a bit overwhelming, making it dry and thick; it still tasted awesome, though! We lessened the amount of Parmesan and added a bit of milk, and it was better. (We did chicken Alfredo, by the way.) Thanks for this recipe!

I overcooked it because I was trying to cook too many things at once and it ended up being really chunky, but still tasted delish! Had to add a bit of salt because I didn't use 1 1/2c of parmesan. And I didn't use heavy cream, just some 35% cream and skim milk and I also cut back the butter to about 1 tbsp.

This was very good and very simple.  The texture was just perfect, nice and creamy.  But it was a little bland for me, next time I will have to play around to kick up the flavor just a bit.

This recipe was pretty good. I added some crushed garlic to the butter, I doubled the cheese, and I added a little bit of white pepper. It was really thin despite the extra cheese, but it had great flavor and was very smooth and creamy. I just wish it'd been a little thicker.

Made this for a birthday party and everyone thought it tasted just like the Olive Garden!  I did cook it a bit longer to get it to melt, but I also tripled the recipe.  Didn't have the parsley, but it was still awesome.  Great recipe!

This was a very good recipe.  I was whisking constantly and still couldn't get it as smooth as I would like it, so I got out my hand/stick blender and got it sooo smooth and creamy.  I will definitely make this again!

I've never made alfredo before, and this was surprisingly easy and delicious. I didn't really measure the cheese, so the amount may have been off. I added a bit of cracked pepper as well. Those worried about the salt (it was fine, but some mentioned this), just use unsalted butter and season to taste- that would be an easy fix.

Awesome even if you don't have parsely! My 2 year old loves it, and he is very picky. I used penne rigate noodles and snuck chicken inside of the noodles! He didn't even reallize because the sauce was so good!

Great recipe! I used half and half, and 2% milk. Everyone loved it, and commented specifically on how great the alfredo sauce was. Will definitely make again... Was a little grainy from the cheese not melting, but next time I will use fresh grated...

Really easy to make and tastes great! Even better the next day. I didn't have any parsley so I used chopped chives instead- which worked perfectly!!

While I'm not a fan of Alfredo sauce (which is strange because I love all the individual ingredients that go into it), I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I changed it up a bit, adding 1 1/2 cup of parmesan and 1 1/2 cup of fontina brought to room temp. Left out the parsley and had no fresh garlic so I used garlic powder. According to my guests they would eat it again!

Simple and delicious. Next time I think I'll try a parmesan blend because the sauce was a little grainy despite my constant whisking. The flavor is so rich and satisfying. A great comfort food. A keeper for sure.

This is so good I can't even pretend I can eat jar alfredo sauce again.  I didn't have parmeson or gruyere so I used fontina, and it's so good I'd be afraid to change it.  Added extra garlic, because that's what I like.  Very good, thank you!

I was asked to prepare a shell pasta with Alfredo sauce for a wedding that would serve 100 people.  I wanted a simple recipe and found it in this recipe.  I received so many compliments and requests for the recipe.  Thank you allrecipes for having this service so easy to access. I'm preparing it for my untraditional Thanksgiving Dinner today with Ribeye Steaks and fresh green beans.

I paired this with "Maria's Stuffed Chicken Breasts" from this site.  This was the best alfredo sauce I've tasted!  I forgot to add the parsley, but it didn't taste like it was missing anything!

This sauce  was great.  I didn't have any clumps because I stirred it constantly until all the cheese was melted. It took a little time, but it was worth it.

this was good! but..i would cut down on the butter. firstly, i hate foods with obvious oily texture. [chocolates and cakes are fine ahah] i'd prefer it to be creamy without the oily texture. so i might try 1 tablespoon of butter next time. doesnt clog up my arteries too! [:

WOW!!  What a great recipe.  I was worried because it didn't look like the alfredo that I was used to (from that popular chain restaurant) but my husband said it was "spot on" and that it was fabulous.  This one is DEFINITELY a keeper.  Thanks for helping me make my husband such a great meal!

This is the best alfredo sauce I have had.  I added a small can of sliced mushrooms made it even better.  I used this recipe for a small office contest on the best sauces and won first place.

I agree with everyone who said this recipe was o.k. on taste, not on texture. I just couldn't get past it (eat with your eyes before you eat with your mouth)! I must have stirred the parm in for 20 mins before giving up and serving the chunky sauce. I won't use it again.

I used half parm and half of the guyere?  turned out amazing.  I grated fresh so maybe that helped.  I mixed it with fresh pasta and it was excellent.  Easy, simple and delicious.  Had dinner ready in 15 minutes.  Definitely will make again. Better than any restaurant alfredo I've had and that says a lot!

The sauce came out excellent.  I followed the recipe closely except I used 3/4 cup of cheese and dried parsley instead of fresh.  I also added nutmeg and fresh ground pepper.  I served it with Buttoni fresh tortellini, my boyfriend loved it and I had two platefuls.  Delicious!

Very Good Flavor & easy to make...I sauteed some smoked bacon & muchrooms together and then cooked thinly pounded chicken breasts in with a little seasoning, set that aside & kept warm.  Then made the sauce with dried parsley, (all I had and still was good).  I had a good aged parm that I shredded and it melted/blended just fine.  My husband said this was very good, he absolutely loved it, so I will be adding this sauce as one of my staples. Thank you Rebecca!

When I asked my husband what he would rate in on a scale 1- 5, he said 7.  This was DELICIOUS!!!!!  This is the first recipe that I have made that didn't separate the second it started to cool.  If I hadn't read reviews about the texture before hand, I would not have noticed.  There was barely anything less than simply smooth and creamy.  I will be making Fettuchini more often now that I have this sauce.

Great recipe!  My husband said it tastes better than at the restaurant! I had no problems with texture at all... probably because I grated my own Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.

This was very yummy! The whole family loved it. I didn’t make any changes and it came out great. After I made the sauce I mixed it with spaghetti noodles, mushrooms and broccoli. I served it with chicken breasts that I baked in the oven and it was a heavy, but fantastic meal.

This was very good.  One change I made to the recipe was that I used half and half instead of heavy cream.  I served it over pasta and broccoli.

I thought this sauce was very good! If fresh parmesean wasn't so expensive, I would've used it. Instead I used the store bought parm, and it didn't melt well at all. The sauce was still excellent.

Excellent and easy alfredo sauce. Made it over tortellini for a party. It got raves from everyone. I added a little more garlic, but otherwise kept everything else the same.

This was my first time making alfredo sauce, and boy, was it ever delicious!!!! It DID taste just like Olive Garden's. I forgot to get the fresh garlic cloves, so I just used garlic powder. It still turned out perfectly. I grated the parmesan myself and I didn't have any trouble getting it to melt. Now I can have people over for dinner and really impress them.

This was a pretty good Alfredo sauce, but I found it had too much cheese for my liking, and the sauce got very lumpy after  I removed it from heat.

If I make it again I'll reduce the amount of Parmesan.

Tastes great, but it always turns out too lumpy.  The parmesean cheese melts well, but once I take it off of the heat, the sauce lumps together.  Still very yummy, though.

This recipe got an "A" for flavor, but an "F" for texture. Maybe I did something wrong, but I could not get the cheese to melt to save my life! It tasted like sauce with lumps of grated cheese. Perhaps I will try the Gruyere next time.

Very good alfredo!  I doubled everything except the parsley; that is a LOT of parsley; still tasted great.  I might add more garlic next time for more flavor, but overall great!

This tasted great! I agree that the parmesan doesn't melt smoothly, but it doesn't affect the flavor at all, it's really just a consistency thing. Also, I might add two cloves of garlic next time--one didn't seem to give enough flavor. I served it over chicken and fettucini and it was YUM!

Holy calories! haha... this was an alright alfredo sauce - better than the bottles, but not as good as the restaurants. I just don't think I can make it again knowing how terrible it is for you - I'd rather a waiter bring me some fettucine alfredo without me having to look at all that butter, cream, and cheese  ;)  Not a bad sauce, though.

This recipe was delicious.  I served it over Shrimp with cheese tortellini.  It was very rich and the parmesan made it flavorful.  The only negative thing was that it didn't store well (it all separated when I re-heated the next day), but it still tasted delicious.

This was really, really good. I made bread sticks to dip in the sauce, my hubby said we don't need to go to Olive Garden anymore!

This was great! I used a little more garlic and grated the cheese myself. It tasted just like olive garden!

This is really good. I add a little Wondra (or flour) to thicken it up so it's not so runny and it tastes great. I also double the recipe. It's evern better if you add mushrooms and cooked chicken breast chunks in the end. Great for dipping breadsticks in the sauce too! Definately a keeper, thanks for sharing this recipe.

I had 2.5 cups of grated parmesan and 1/2 c of other kind. I stirred for about an hour before giving up. The sauce was extremely rich and tasty and the parmesan that didn't melt was as if I'd sprinkled some on. I'll make again and doubling serves 5-6 adults well. Sauted cubed chicken with seasoning and added towards last bit just to warm through. 4 star the way I made it, but 5 star potential. Hope to shorten cook time too!

Yummy....creamy......flavorful!  I can't complain.  I did add some white wine in to add a little oomph, tossed in some mushrooms and shrimp and it turned out absolutely perfect.

I love this alfredo sauce.  My husband did say that there might be too much parmesan in it (it was very rich), but I think he needs to figure out what to substitute it with.  It's alfredo sauce for cripes sake!  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was okay, but I had to add alot of extra flavor to get it to taste the way my family likes. I added extra garlic, parsley, butter pepper & some corn starch to thicken it a bit. The end result was really good, but I don't think I will make this recipe again w/o the added ingredients.

This sauce tastes amazing! As it said, the parmesan cheese didn't melt completely, but I didn't think it was a huge problem. Only thing was that I doubled the recipe and it was almost gone after five of us ate. We may be big eaters, but I would suggest if you're cooking for three or more to double it. My friends can't wait for me to fix it again!

Really great sauce.  As suggested by the author, I added some Gruyere, which gave the sauce a nice complex flavor.  Wonderful!

I whipped this up one morning when my husband wanted one of this favorite casseroles that called for a jar of alfredo sauce and I didn't have one on hand. Very easy to make. I liked ours with extra pepper.

Great Recipe. It was a little difficult to get the parmesan to melt, but I found that if you keep whisking and adding milk over medium heat, the cheese will melt pretty evenly and the sauce will become a lot smoother in consistency. Near the end, try adding some mushrooms, cooked shrimp and some italian seasoning along with the parsley. Makes an incredible dinner!

I thought this recipe was excelllent.  I have been using jar Alfredo cream sauce in search of a really good one, but this is just as easy and double the flavor!  It is the most rich alfredo sauce EVER!  I love it!  Mangia!

I never could get the texture smooth so the sauce was pretty gritty.  But it does have excellent flavor and warmed up well for my husband who works late!

Very good recipe! I was a little disappointed when the mixutre began to separate. I had melted cheese and greasy butter. It didn't make it past one day in the fridge. Next time I'll try frozen butter instead cold.
