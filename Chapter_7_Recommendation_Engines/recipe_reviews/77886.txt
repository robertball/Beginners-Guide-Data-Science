I made this for my office Thanksgiving Day dinner. I was very nervous since no one had ever heard of using the cinnamon candies in the recipie. It was the hit. People went back for seconds and thirds. I had several people ask for the recipie. I'm making it again for our own dinner....

This is clever, unique and delicious. I had a feeling this would be good but this was wow! I highly recommend giving this a try, esp. if you love cinnamon and sweet potatoes. It's almost like a dessert. It was easy to make too.

This is just like what my mom and Granny made.   We swapped half & half for the water.   Very good and simple recipe.

I feel terrible that I've never reviewed this recipe. We've been making it for several years. It's my family's ALL TIME FAVORITE Thanksgiving dish! I make it exactly as the recipe states. I even add the optional marshmallows. We like them sweet! 

If you're looking for a savory sweet potato dish, you need to look elsewhere.
