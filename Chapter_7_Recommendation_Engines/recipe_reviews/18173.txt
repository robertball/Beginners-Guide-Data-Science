This is a good recipe!  Really liked the nutty taste of the whole wheat flour with the honey.  I will try it again.  I changed the recipe to 8 servings as my crockpot was 2.5 quarts instead of 3.5.  Had a hard time telling if the bread was done and over cooked it a little and the bottom edge got very brown.  Will try mixing it up the night before and keeping it in the refridgerator, punching down in the morning, keep refridgerated until my lunch break and put it in the crockpot then to serve for supper.  Thanks for the recipe.  Also, my crockpot doesn't have a bread or cake baking dish, just the removable ceramic insert with glass top.  Worked great!

This bread was way too easy!!  It turned out great.  I cooked it for 2 hrs in the slow cooker and didn't use any special pan.  It was a bit overdone on the edges.  when I do it again, I will cook it for less than 2 hrs.  It  looked kind of like an artisan loaf in the oval shape of the crock pot.

Good bread.  I didn't bake it in the slow cooker bc I was using mine, so perhaps I'll try it that way next time.  I just made a regular loaf of bread in a bread pan--baked at 375 for 40 mins.  Came out perfect, a dense whole wheat that is good for toast.  Thanks for the recipe!

This bread had a great texture and easy to slice.  I used parchment paper to line my crock pot which made it easy to remove when done. Did not need a special bread pan.  I think it would be 5 stars if it was  just a little sweeter.
