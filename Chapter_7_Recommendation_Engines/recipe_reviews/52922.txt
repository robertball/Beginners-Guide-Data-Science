The potatoes turn out great with basil and rosemary. But 400F is far too hot to ever expose basil to, not to mention for 30 minutes. The basil is best added 10 minutes prior to taking out of the oven, and the tomatoes do best at 350F.

I love any roasted potatoe!, but I always 'par boil first' it cuts cooking time and keeps the inside moist and the outside crisp and this is the key to not overcooking other added vegies etc.

Very nice. 

Used very small reds, cut in half and steamed for 10 minutes. Put on low sided foil covered baking sheet and drizzled with garlic infused EVOO. 
Cut fresh grape tomatoes in half and tossed with potatoes, fresh basil and oil. Roasted at 425 deg. for 15 minutes on next lowest rack in oven. Tossed on the fresh chopped rosemary and back in oven for another 5 min. Before eating added more fresh basil and a grind of salt and fresh black pepper. 

Served with steamed fresh shrimp and roasted fresh corn.

Steaming and roasting times can vary--they do for me.

I really enjoyed this. As always, I like to twist things around just a bit. I agree with everyone who suggested more rosemary. Even if your not a big fan of garlic, more IS better. After roasting it becomes sweet, and mild. I added just a sprinkel or two of Balsamic viniger, and tossed everything together before baking. Yumm!

This was good but as written I can definitely see how they could be bland. I upped my fresh rosemary, added more basil, more garlic, some garlic pepper and garlic salt, season salt etc and they came out very tasty....

This is a wonderful dish.  I added fresh cracked black pepper and sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top for the last 10 minutes.  Wonderful flavors without being too heavy!

A nice side dish to serve with 'Easy Tilapia with Wine & Tomatoes'.  For the tomatoes, I used canned petite diced (drained of excess liquid) which roasted to a sundried tomato chewiness -- a fav.  Added more garlic, S & P and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.  Diced on the smallish side, the potatoes were done in 30 min.  Thanks!

The flavor for this dish is excellent.  However, I added salt,pepper and extra rosemary - and I'm glad I did, or it would've been very bland.  Also, the temperature and time allowed on this dish is inaccurate.  I roasted at 400F for 35 minutes, and the potatoes were not completely done.

These were excellent potatoes.  I used baby blue, red and yukon golds.  The additional flavor that the fresh tomatoe brings is delicious.  My batch took about 45 minutes to cook and I added the basil the last 15 minutes. VERY good recipe- THANKS MYAGIKUN

With a few slight modifications, a definite 5 stars!  For a handy timesaver, use steamable red potatoes for microwaving.  Microwave until almost fork tender and cut into cubes.  Toss with oil in mixing bowl along with halved grape tomatoes and wedges of onion.  Transfer to foil-lined baking sheet and sprinkle with garlic salt and freshly ground pepper.  Bake as directed then place under the broiler to brown and crisp before tossing with fresh basil.  A delicious summer side dish!

Next time I'm going to try them wrapped in foil on the grill

Very easy and tasted great - I added balsamic and minced onions, which improved the flavor. May have been a little on the bland side without.

This is a great recipe - I make it often as a side dish to chicken or pork. I always par-boil my potatoes, then toss with veggies and spices and bake for about 20min to bring everything together and crisp them up. I usually add in a sliced up large red onion, and sometimes I omit the tomatoes since my boyfriend doesn't care for them. It's delicious either way, and it always looks nice!

Loved this! I used red bliss potatoes baked at 350 and increased cooking time to 50 - 60 min. Used grape tomatoes and added fresh basil the last 15 minutes as previous reviewers noted. Heavenly smell and the taste bellissimo! This recipe is a keeper for sure!

This was very good, I followed the advice of steaming the potatoes, but they still came out a little stiff.  I'll try a little longer next time.  And there will be a next time!

This recipe was so very delicious.  It is a good way to use potatoes in a unique way.  The flavor is outstanding as a result of the fresh basil, garlic and olive oil. May family loved it as well as myself and I am sure I will prepare this super tasty potato side dish many times in the future.

I have to agree with everyone else this is a great base but you will need to add more garlic & rosemary along with salt & pepper. Will make again with a few added seasonings.

Bland.  I left out the tomatoes because I didn't have any, and added salt & pepper and they just didn't have enough flavor.  Even fresh basil & rosemary couldn't save this dish.

I used garlic scapes that I diced it up in the Magic Bullet instead of garlic cloves; I used butter instead of olive oil as I prefer the taste; and I left out the rosemary.  Delicious!  This might become a new staple in our home.  The only problem is that it took much longer than I anticipated to cook thoroughly -- it was probably in the oven for 45 minutes in total.  I would dice the potatoes smaller next time or put them in the oven sooner.

These were supper yummy! The cook time is not at all accurate. It took almost an hour for these to cook all the way. My recommendation is turn down the oven to 350 and cook them for about an hour.

Very flavorful!  I loved the tangy tomatoes mixed with the potatoes and basil and garlic.  It paired perfectly with the Parmesan Sage Pork Chops I served.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved it.  Used lots of tips from other reviewers:  boiled potatoes first, added salt and pepper, put basil on at end and added cheese.  Tasted like a good Christmas side dish.

I followed the recipe but wish I would have listened to other reviewers because it was really bland. I could taste basil of course, but the recipe needed something to balance and complement the basil-ness. 

Next time I plan to double the garlic and add onions. We'll see if that helps.

As it is written, the recipe didn't impress me.

These are awesome!  I wanted something different and had tomatoes around so this was a good choice.  I used dried spices instead of fresh.  I put them in hot water for about 30 minutes before using to rehydrate them.  I used about a tablespoon of the basil and about 1 tsp of rosemary.  I also added about 1 tsp of Parsley and 2 pieces of fried, chopped bacon.  I used regular potatoes instead of the red ones.  This recipe is awesome!  I'm so glad you posted it!

I left out the rosemary, used cherry tomatoes and added 1/4 cup of Italian dressing.(used lots of salt and pepper) Very good as my side dish.

I tried this recipe twice.. the second time was the best!  I used more garlic less rosemary, a little bit more tomoato and added the basil 10 minutes from end of cooking time.  Delicious.  Adding lemon juice and/or Parmesan cheese would be okay but not needed to enhance flavor.

A little bland. Needed plenty of salt and pepper.  Also, next time I'll follow some of the suggestions to add the basil 10 minutes before the potatoes are done.  But with a few tweaks, this will be the way I roast potatoes from now on.

I thought  this dish was good, though a little bland.  I added zucchini and salt, and I think it really needed the salt.  I also waited to add the basil until the last few minutes of cooking.  When I took it out of the oven I sprinkled with lemon juice and paremsan, as others had suggested.  Overall, it was pretty good.

Had to double the recipe for a big dinner.  Used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and did not add the rosemary.  I did add some sesame seeds which gave it a wonderful taste. Obviously, cooking time was longer.  Very tasty

Liked this one a lot!  Like others I added more garlic and I also added a little lemon juice.  I sprinkled with salt and pepper and a little extra olive oil before I put into the oven.  The tomatoes had a fantastic flavor. Still could have used a little something though.

Delicious! Five stars all the way. Tastes wonderful, and as noted below, the dish is visually appealing. I added more garlic. Didn't have as much fresh basil on hand, but I used what I had and added some dried seasonings. Came out excellent.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used small salad tomatoes halved, fresh basil, and fresh rosemary all from my backyard garden.  The only thing that improves this recipe is to double the rosemary, and then splash some extra olive oil on before serving.

Loved it!!!  I don't like cooked tomatoes so I waited until the last 10 minutes of the cooking time to add them along with some feta cheese.  We used dried basil and rosemary since that is all that we had.  I forgot to add salt and pepper and the flavor was still amazing!!!  Oh, and parboiling the potatoes is a great suggestion.  Excellent!

Bland is the only word to describe this.  We really enjoy using fresh basil and was disappointed with this dish.  Needs more spices, salt and pepper.  Will probably not make again.

This was delicious! I used 1 1/2 pounds of tiny miniature yellow potatoes from Trader Joe's and a pint of grape tomatoes, cut in half. I also added the fresh basil only for the last 10 minutes of cooking because I didn't want it to burn. Delicious paired with grilled chicken breast. I will be making this again for sure!

I did as Marysf suggested and used small red potatoes, steaming them first. Put them in the pan with the chopped up tomatoes and seasoning, and roasted it for around 25 minutes at 400F. Turned out excellent - even with dried rosemary (didn't have fresh). This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for posting it! Will definitely make again soon.

i don't generally measure. some potatoes, fresh grape or cherry tomatoes cut in half, some dried basil, jarred garlic, evoo or sunflower oil, fresh rosemary, some chopped onion and salt and cracked black pepper. give it a good toss with your hands, cover it and throw it in the oven on 425 until the potatoes are cooked through.

These were ok. This recipe needs some important modifications. The temp should be at least 425 if not 450 for 45 minutes to get these cooked well. Also the basil burned off and should be added at the end. Add some parmesan on top and your good to go.

Everyone loved this. Great flavor with the basil and tomatoes.  I did wait until last ten minutes to mix in the basil.  Made the mistake of waiting to throw the rosemary in then, too. That should probably go in right in the beginning.  Also, I quartered the red potatoes and cooked it at 400 degrees for 35 minutes and they were perfect.

When I think of Roasted Potatoes, I imagine potatoes that are crispy on the outside and tender inside.  Maybe the tomatoes that I used (yellow tomatoes ripe from the garden) contained too much juice because instead of roasted potatoes and roasted tomatoes, I ended up with cooked potatoes in a slightly thickened tomato sauce.  The flavors were very good (hence the "4" rating),  but the texture was not what I was expecting.   I topped the "casserole" with cheese to make it a complete light meal.

I made this recipe two ways: first, I followed it exactly as stated and it was OK, basil and tomatoes too overcooked and lacking some flavor. Second time around, I chopped up the garlic and some white onion and added them to the listed ingredients. I took all of the ingredients and put them into a pot of water and boiled(1:5 ratio for water-ingredients)for ten minutes and simmered for fifteen. It was excellent!

I love this stuff.  I add a few thinly sliced onions, and make the sauce a bit more substantial with a mix of olive oil, tomato paste and seasonings.  Delicious:)

This was good. I hade to leave it in the oven for almost an hour to have the potatoes done but I probably cut them to big. It needs some salt and pepper before baking. Like others, I added shredded parmesian cheese before serving.

I was dubious but it turned out delicious and everyone loved it.  I was out of garlic, but I'm sure it would have been better.  I mostly used grape tomatoes sliced in half and diced red potatoes.  It's going in the rotation now!

Very tasty.  I really liked the flavor that the tomatoes gave the potatoes.  I used regular russets and they turned out great.  I did have to bake them for about twice as long as the recipe called for and added salt as well.

Maybe my potatoes weren't cut small enough, but this one definitely needed some extra time in the oven.  And don't skimp on the seasonings - add even more! Still a great recipe and goes with so many things!

This was really yummy. And easy.  I only used 2 Tablesppons of oil to cut back on the calories.  And it was still perfect. I also squeezed some fresh lemon on it once it was done.  It;s a get side dish to go with Chicken with Garlic, Basil, and Parsley ( another great recipe I found on this site)

This was EXCELLENT! I cut my red potatoes and my tomatoes into small chunks instead of dicing them. (the roasting time was only about 40 minutes.) I also used dried basil and rosemary, along with fresh garlic. Next time I will add some sliced bell peppers and small onion chunks. This makes a nice side dish to take to dinner parties.

I followed this recipe exactly and we found it to be quite bland.  If I make it again I'll add onions and sweet peppers plus more garlic -- also maybe some hot peppers.

Easy to make. I agree that paboiling or steaming can shorten roasting, making the potatoes tender inside while the outside crisps. A basic recipe with lots of room to add your own touches.

I loved the addition of tomatoes and basil to an all time favorite way to cook potatoes ... a fitting combination for all that end of summer produce from our eastern Washington garden.  Needed a little salt and pepper to flavor.

These were DE-licious! :) I found that I had to bake them for waaay longer than the instructions called for before the potatoes were tender.  But it was worth the wait.  Also, I put all the ingredients in a gallon-size ziploc bag and shook it all together to ensure that everything was evenly coated.  It just made it a little easier.  I will definitely be making this again.  The only change I wish I had made is doubling the batch so we could have had some leftovers :)

I have used this recipe a few times now and each time have had to add about 20 minutes onto the cook time.  Maybe I am not cutting the potatoes up small enough.  I also add shredded Romano cheese right out of the oven to give it that extra touch.  
Very good each time!

This was decent.  I needed to use up some fresh tomatoes and I was surprised how good they tasted in this.  I usually like my roasted potatoes more on the "dry" side, but these were good---just different.  I added more rosemary as others suggested and more basil as well.   These could really use some salt.  By no means my favorite potato recipe, but the fresh herbs and tomatoes give it extra points in my book.

I thought this was a great starter recipe, but i added a bit to it and it turned out fantastic!  I diced red potatoes and pre-boiled them for 9 minutes.  After, steam fresh green beans for 7 minutes.  Strain both veggies, and put on a broiling pan along with fresh diced seeded tomatoes, 1 fresh chopped clove of garlic, 1/2 cup of feta cheese, and 1 can of chopped artichoke hearts.  Then sprinkle basil & parmesan & bake for 15-20 minutes!  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because you need to add more to make it into 5!

This is a good recipe - tasty and easy to make. I made 1/2 a batch, and it fed 4 easily. It does need salt and pepper and I took the advice of another reviewer and added parmesan (I used freshly grated) to the dish with about 10 minutes left in the 45 minute cooking time.

I'm sorry... maybe we messed this one up... but it was awful! Way too much basil and the cook time is way off. (I liked the tomato addition and want to work that into another roasted potato recipe though... not this one!)

The flavor was excellent, although potatoes didn't seem quite done.  I didn't have any fresh tomatoes so instead I used a can of diced tomatoes (Hunt's brand with roasted garlic) and it turned out delicious.

Delicious!  Omitted the rosemary (for personal preference), decreased the garlic to 2 cloves, and sprinkled with salt/pepper as suggested. Company enjoyed.

DELICIOUS! I used the recipe as a guideline and threw all the ingredients together with some salt and pepper. I did par-boil the potatoes for about 7-8 minutes before putting them in the oven. I recommend this recipe!

Good, but not great.  Could use a good sprinkle of Parmesan before serving. We do not like rosemary & I did not add too much of that, but thought it needed some type of additional seasoning.

I really enjoyed these. Light and tasty. I'm a cheese lover so I added some when the potatoes were done and put it back in the oven for a couple minutes to melt it. I think I'll use this as a brunch dish.

I found this recipe to be ok but nothing special.  The recipe needs salt and pepper to help with the flavor.  It is however a good base recipe that just needs some adjustments.  Like one of the other reviewers I too added extra rosemary with out it I think this recipe would really be bland.  I will probably try this again but add more garlic some green peppers and onions.

Not sure what I did wrong but it took a lot longer than the suggested time. I used a 9x13 pan, maybe I'll try a baking sheet next time. Tasted great though so I'll still give it a 5.
