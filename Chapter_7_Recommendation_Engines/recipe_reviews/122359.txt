Delicious! Added carrots and a clove of garlic, salt, and 1/2 cup frozen corn, and hormel cooked salad bacon pieces. This is the best soup ever regardless of fat content!

I made this and everyone loved it.  It has a lot of flavor for being low fat.  My only substitution was carrots instead of celery, as husband is not a big fan of celery.

good, low fat recipe. it has the texture of a hearty soup, but you dont feel like you gained 5 pounds after eating it!  I double the recipe, added a bag of corn and some carrots, and then used a total of 3 cans of broth (since i added more veggies)  Let the soup sit for a bit and it thickens up really nicely! topped with cheddar cheese and green onions.  oh, and add SALT!! it needs a bit of it.

This potato soup was AWESOME--even my picky husband raved about it.  I used sharp colby low fat cheese.  It's a stick-to-your ribs yummy soup--great for fall and winter.

This was a great recipe!  I didn't even add the cheese because I wanted it to be even lower fat.  Also added some ham pieces and like other review carrots instead of celery.  It was delicious.

As far as a low-fat soup goes, this recipe was excellent. I had never used evaporated milk before and the color threw me off a bit, so i might use regular fat free milk next time. i also added carrots with the celery. i will be making this again.

The only thing I omitted was the cheese, due to personal preference.  This was very yummy.  It tastes yummy if you blend it also.  This was the only way to get the kiddies to eat it up.  For a low fat recipe, this didn't taste yucky at all.  Thanks.  I served it with homemade bread!

Really good,  rich, creamy, I did not miss the fat at all.  I didn't follow the recipe to a T but I did use the all the ingredients.  The only thing that might could have made this soup better would have been bacon... but then it wouldn't be "low fat" and its still GREAT without it.

Excellent low fat soup!  I love potato soup but it's usually pretty fattening and I'm looking to lose a love handle or two!!  I made this and didn't tell my husband it was low fat, like I usually do when I alter recipes :-}  He loved it and wants me to make more!  This is a keeper.  I love this site......so many great recipes!  Thanks

This soup turned out great!  I doubled it, added some carrots & garlic, and some salt, as others have mentioned.  I also used both the evaporated milk and 2%.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I loved this soup!! I doubled the recipe and added corn instead of celery.  I even used fat free kraft cheese, you couldn't even tell that it was a low fat soup!  Of course I added a bit of spices then what it asked for, but you can just make yours to taste.  I served it with some homemade bread, yummy yummy! Thank you for such a good and easy recipe!  And it's not expensive to make either!

This was very good! I made a few changes but essentially stayed with the original recipe. I used 1% milk and only 1 tbs of cornstarch because I pureed the potato mixture once cooked with a hand blender. I added splashes of milk until I liked the consistency after I blended it. I omitted the celery (personal preference), added a clove of garlic, and salt (definitely needs salt). I used shredded cheddar, diced scallions, and a few bits of real cooked bacon, along with a small scoop of low-fat sour cream. It was very satisfying and I'd make this again for sure.

I doubled this recipe based on reviews and was SO glad I did.  I also sauteed onion, celery and carrot before adding potatoes, etc.  Forgot the garlic, darn!  So added some garlic salt and also tested a bowl with Thyme, which I loved!..but husband didn't, so stopped there.  I did use my immersion blender a bit since I prefer a smoother soup.  It's as good as a fattening soup!!  A real keeper!!!  Thank you!!!!

My husband was on a soft diet so I needed to make a dish that would accomodate his needs and be filling at the same time.  Thie soup hit the spot and he loved it.  I sauteed the onions, potatos and celery in olive oil and one tablespoon of butter (just to get the flavor).  Other then that, I followed the recipe and it came out delicious!  Be prepared when you add the cornstarch.  The soup thickens up fast!  Very filling for a dinner time meal.

Absolutely delicious! It tastes so thick and rich and creamy and BAD for you, you would never know it was low-fat! Even my boyfriend who hates any potato that isn't fried LOVED it. I would double the recipe next time.. it doesn't make a whole lot.

This is an incredible recipe! My husband loved it & will want it again for sure. I think 12 oz milk was too much for this recipe so I had about 1/2 cup leftover. I used fat free cheddar cheese & added some salt. It was fast, easy & anything low-fat yet delicious for my husband is a winner!! Thank you for sharing this.

My husband and daughter really loved this soup.  I cooked up a little bacon to put on top but it was lean so it didn't add much fat.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it could have used just a bit more flavor.  However it was definitely a hot on a cold winter night.

My 8-year-old son loves this recipe. Since it's lower in fat, it's not as overly rich and filling as other potato soups. Just right. Highly recommend it with or without cheese.

I was out of cornstarch, so I used whole wheat flour (1 to 2.) I also added rosemary and thyme. So good and comforting! Delicious topped with seasoned croutons.

I loved this recipe, it was so easy and exceeded my expectations. The only difference was I used regular chicken broth since I couldn't find the low-sodium kind.

Oh this soup was so good!  I doubled the recipe and the only small things I changed were that I put 1 cup of cauliflower with the almost 3 cups of potatoes and I used beef stock instead of chicken because I didn't have enough.  I pureed it at the end before adding the cheese.  WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!!

I'm on Weight Watchers and was so excited about a new soup recipe.  I read all the reviews and it seemed like a sure thing.  But...although I followed all the directions and included some of the other reviewers tips, I found it had an odd slightly sweet taste to it that was unappealing.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't very good either, so I doubt I'll be making it again (note: I usually love chowder type soups)

This was a really good soup, and very easy! However, you DO need to add salt. I didn't at first and it was way too bland. I used kosher salt and just added a few pinches until I was satisfied with the taste. I also added some herbs de provence and some turkey bacon. You can't have potato soup without bacon! Next time I'll try adding a bay leaf and some carrots. Great recipe!

My soup very dark in color and a little thicker than I would have preferred. Perhaps I used too much cornstarch. I added a half cup of mozzarella cheese too. Served with crusty bread. Yum!

I made a few modifications based on personal preference: added 3 cloves pressed garlic, 1 sliced carrot, used 1/2 the amount of lowfat milk instead of evaporated milk, rosemary, corn, and a little salt.  Next time I will add ham to this.

This soup was DELICIOUS. I doubled the recipe, and put cut up mushrooms in it. YUM! I added 3 cloves of garlic. First, in a little bit of cooking oil, I sauteed the chopped onion, garlic, celery & mushrooms. I also used 1% milk, and only put about 2 TBSP of cheese, not the whole amount, to reduce the fat content even more. I added some green onions at the end. GREAT RECIPE!!

I've made this soup several times now and think it is awesome.  You'd never know it was low-fat, that's forsure!  I don't use the fat free evaporated milk, I use 6 ozs. of skim milk, 6 ozs. of 2% milk and the cornstarch mixed in.  Turns out great!  Tastes very rich, as with the cornstarch thickening the soup and some added cheese, it gives it that rich creamy texture and taste!  I love it!

This soup is amazing. I love the use of cornstarch and evaporated milk as a thickener! I've used regular cheese for the final touch (as reduced-fat cheese can sometimes be quite expensive), which I think adds a lovely richness. The second time I made the soup I also added diced carrot. It reheats nicely in the microwave so I make double the recipe for plenty of leftovers through the week!

This is very good..I am on a diet and it really is satifying with some fat free crackers...sometimes I will sprinkle in some garlic powder and some italian seasoning..but the original is great....

My family loved this.  Used carrots instead of celery.  Wonderful flavor. Nice and hearty too for being low fat.

Good consistency and taste.  I added extra freshly ground black pepper and topped with green onions.

sorry, i think this definitely tastes like "diet food".  Granted, it is thick enough, but I wouldn't make it again>
