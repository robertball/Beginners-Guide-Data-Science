Needs more spice IMHO. I added some paprika and garlic. Also , 3 minutes is more than enough to cook the peppers.

Looking for an Instant Pot recipe and found this. We liked it, but did not love it. Only think I did differently was to use a can of diced tomatoes and added water to make 1 1/2 cups.  We traditionally like Italian stuffed peppers, but this was a nice change.

Really good recipe. We added saut√©ed mushrooms, used only half an onion, and our tomato paste was 8 ounces instead of 6, so we just cut out some of the water. Also we used about 2 cups of water since that is the minimum fill level per the instant pot manual. Toughest part was pulling out the cooked peppers.

I never thought I would make stuffed peppers, they  just seemed liked something I would not enjoy, then one day my niece served me a stuffed pepper and it was wonderful, so I set out to make a stuffed pepper for myself and came across this recipe. I don't own an Instant Pot, so like one reviewer, I baked it in a 400 degree oven for 45 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but like other reviewers have stated, it does need some salt and pepper added to the meat mixture. If I could, I would give it four and a half stars, but I can't, so I'm giving it four stars due to the lack of salt and pepper in the ingredients list. I will make these again. Yum!!!

Easy and delicious. I added shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream to each after plating.

I have made this several times and I always enjoy this simple but delicious recipe. The only thing I do differently is add a little salt and pepper to the meat, and I use ground turkey over beef.

I have to say WOW, because this recipe was simple and delicious! I thought I'd choose this as my first ever instant pot meal and I'm so glad I did. I feel a lot more comfortable using it after this. Since I had a mini I have to do two 'batches' to cook all four peppers, but I still used the same amount of water and cooking time and the peppers turned out tender and delicious. I also used colored bell peppers because I love things sweet and savory, and I find them a bit more sweet.

Thank you so much for making this recipe!

I found it difficult getting the peppers out of the instant pot and plated. They fell apart so I am thinking this may be a better oven recipe.

I baked the peppers for 45 minutes in a 400 degree oven instead of  a pressure cooker. Then topped with Colby Jack cheese and diced tomatoes.
