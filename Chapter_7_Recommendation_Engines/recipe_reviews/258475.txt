The chocolate was not sweet at all, it needed sugar desperately. The spice was decently proportioned, but the sugarless chocolate flavor spoiled the whole batch. Such a shame :(

Some adjustments were made by the site to the original recipe I submitted, as I included sugar as one of the ingredients before and now it's oddly been completely unlisted here, not sure why. I definitely recommend about 1/2 to 3/4 cup sugar as well though, or as the other reviewer stated it really won't be sweet enough at all!
