I was a little wary of the combination but tried it anyway, with one egg instead of three.  It came out great!  Thanks for a good kid-friendly recipe.

If you're looking for something like babaganoush, but more filling, this is the perfect recipe. I made it for my dad, and he fell in love.

This was as good as it gets. The I used 2 eggs instead of 3 because that is all I had on hand, and the taste was not overpowering and it blended in well with the eggplant. The egg did not look like omelet and incorporated perfectly in the dip. The only thing I would add is more spices for an extra zing. Will make again and again!

It's not delicious.  It's more like a diet food.  You eat it because it's food, low in calories, but flat taste.

this dish didn't turn out very nicely..maybe it's because I m not skilled at cooking scrambled eggs usually...definitely won't be trying it again. Sorry!

This is a no from me.. big no. No flavor, not pleasant to look at, smell isn't great. I love egg, and I love eggplant but not this. I cannot think of any way to salvage this so I will be tossing it

I make these without the tomatoes and serve over rice. Not be for some though but I grew up on it.
