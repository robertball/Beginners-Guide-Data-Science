Oh, these are DELICIOUS!!!!! Only thing...I couldn't bring myself to add a tablespoon of coconut extract (I use pure coconut extract), so I did reduce that amount to 1/4 teaspoon, and that was absolutely perfect. As a lover of both coconut and cheesecake, I knew I was gonna love these. Oh, also, I did have to leave these in the oven a bit longer, so just keep an eye on that. These were so simple to make and the flavors are wonderful. I will be making these over and over ~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Followed the recipe instructions... Great! The only change I made was to the topping. I mixed a caramel ice cream topper with shredded coconut & chopped up Samoa cookies & it was well received. Easy to make! Don't hesitate to try this.
