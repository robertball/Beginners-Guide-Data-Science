I omitted the lemon zest, replaced the oil that the recipe asked for with 1/3 cup of applesauce, added an extra 1/4 cup of bananas, and also added some extra chopped walnuts, as it seemed like there weren't quite enough. I don't have a standard-sized muffin tin, so I just filled my 24-mini-muffin-tin. The result? Heavenly, and even lower in fat!

We added a package of vanilla instant pudding mix and 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup milk to the batter for added moistness.  Cut down the oil to 1 TBSP.  Added 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon and 1/2 cup rolled oats.  Also put in about 1 and 1/2 cups of mashed banana.  Baked in our oven at 350 for 23 minutes.  Delish!  Would be great with mini chocolate chips!

This will be a great muffin for my husband and kids to "grab n go" in the morning.  I doubled the recipe, cut back on the white sugar, added 1/2 C  brown sugar, and it gave them a wonderful bronze color and flavor!  I omitted the lemon zest, and instead simply added Vanilla Extract.  I increased the amount of banana as well, using 4 large ripe bananas.  I also added extra walnuts for more protein content.  All in all I will probably be making this recipe again.  Thanks!

So easy and good!! I was a bit lazy, so I used whole eggs ( instead of just whites). Also, measured 1/2 cup of walnuts. They came out perfect! Me, my husband and my 10 y.old loved them. Keeper!:) Thanks.

Very delicious muffins, although I did a few alterations. I used whole wheat flour and omitted the zest. I also Cut up length wise a piece of banana and put it in the center of the muffin which made it so moist and a nice surprise in the middle. And you can also add some blueberries to make it even more delish

These muffins are really easy to make and very good. I do recommend adding more walnuts then the recipe calls for. And i used one whole egg and one egg white.

After reading others suggestions I made the following changes: 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1 3/4 cups mashed bananas (about 3 1/2 bananas) and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  They were great..low cal and quick to fix.

the perfect amount of bananalicous flavor all wrapped up in a muffin!  a definite winner with my roommate! i added extra walnuts and about a cup of flaky, multi-grain cereal for extra texture.  then i mixed that same cereal with some brown sugar to create a sweet and crunchy topping.

These muffins were delicious!!  The lemon zest made it wonderfully refreshing!  I will definitely make them again.  I added 1/2 cup of walnuts instead of 1/4 cup.

If you top these right then these banana muffins  transform themselves into muffins for the masses.  These muffins are for people that typically can't stand banana bread/muffins or anything banana flavored for that matter.  With that said, I followed everybody's advice and added my own banana-taming ingredients: added the cinnamon, added the vanilla, used olive oil, 2 cups pureed banana, 1 cup all purpose, 1/2 cup whole wheat, 3 tsp baking powder, 1 whole egg, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tbsp fresh squeezed OJ, 1 tbsp oatmeal, 2 tbsp crushed frosted fiber one mini wheats, and oats/almonds/soy nuts.  Keep the nuts out of the batter.  The nuts on top warn people with nut allergies to skip over to the nut-free table.  Toppings I used (just mix and scoop on top of muffin batter) 1.  crushed almonds and maple syrup 2.  crushed toasted soy nuts and dark honey 3.  oats

No frills here - just a straight up delicious banana muffin.  Used 1 egg instead of 2 egg whites.  These came out nicely domed, moist, and full of banana flavor.

The best muffin recipe I've found! I used pecans instead of walnut because that's what I had in the cabinet, and I used 1/2 cup of nuts instead of 1/4.

I followed the recipe exactly, cooked for 20 minutes and found them heavy and a bit tough, although the flavor is good. You may want to add baking powder to the recipe. I found it odd that a muffin recipe would call for 1/4 tsp of baking soda, like a cookie.

Muffins are very mild in flavor, next time I may add a little bit more banana, but they were easy and quick to make.

Yum!  Like most, I changed some things.  I used orange zest instead of lemon.  Added a 1/4 cup extra banana and a dash of vanilla.  And I doubled the walnuts and exchanged apple sauce for the oil.

The rating may be fault.  I modified the recipe and used Splenda and low sodium salt for a healthier alternative.  Although the taste was good, the texture was rubbery and the batter cemented itself to the paper cups.  Next time I'll kick the fake stuff and go native!!

Quick, easy, non-fussy, good old-fashioned recipe! Sometimes you just want something simple and this recipe gets it right. Only 4 stars because once I tasted it I realized some spices were missing that usually go with banana nut muffins/breads. So the 2nd batch I made, I added a touch of cinnamon, nutmeg, and 1 tsp vanilla flavoring. Yet still, a great recipe for a delicious breakfast muffin. Bravo!

The recipe was wonderful. It was my first time ever making muffins from scratch! I cut the recipe in half because I only had 1 banana. I did make some changes. Instead of vegetable oil I used butter. I used pecans because I didn't have any walnuts. I added white chocolate chips too! Otherwise, everything was the same.

Added 1/4 cup more walnuts than the recipe called for, but these should be called vanishing muffins, they're gone before they've completely cooled!

I used chocolate chips and vanilla extract instead of walnuts and lemon zest because those were what I had on hand. Also, I used 1 egg white and 1 whole egg because the yolk escaped into the bowl. The results were great. These muffins have a great, light texture.

I'm sorry but I was uttely dissapointed in these.  They were too dense, not fluffy at all and they weren't flavorful enough.  I won't be making these again.

These muffins are just DELICIOUS! I did change it a bit though; i added a tsp of cinnamon and a pinch of fresh nutmeg. I also substituted the zest for a tsp of vanilla extract. For a crunchy topping, i added some raw sugar on top before popping it in the oven. Delicious and crunchy. Although I only got 11 muffins, i will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe in a rush one morning so I could give some to my girlfriend before she went to work.  They were delicious.  Light and fluffy as opposed to heavy and greasy like many oil-filled recipes.  This one goes in my recipe book!  Thanks.

This is a really good no-guilt recipe!  I used 1 1/2 cups white whole wheat(instead of AP flour), 2/3 cup of sugar(instead of 3/4), 2 TBL oil(instead of 3 TBL), 2 eggs(instead of 2 egg whites), three ripe bananas. And then added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla( I add vanilla to everything!). I made three types with this batch.  I made six plain ones, without nuts and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top before baking. Another four, with 2 TbL white chocolate chips and chopped walnuts and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top before baking.  The last four had chocolate chips.    I was able to get 14 muffins from this recipe.  They were fluffy and rose nicley, not dense at all.  Packed with flavor! A definite Keeper for muffins!! PLUS, these are way healthier than the store bought ones! ****** Update: I used this crumb topping and they are so good! -1/3 cup packed brown sugar,
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour,
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon,
1 tablespoon butter

This recipe was quick and easy.  However, I found the muffins to be dry and a bit bland.  I also used 1/2 cup of walnuts instead of the 1/4 cup suggested.  The lemon zest was a nice touch.

This is a simple and good recipe. Cook time in my oven was a bit shorter than described here (about 15 minutes per batch). I doubled the recipe, but omitted the lemon zest and walnuts. If I make these again, I might add some cinnamon or nutmeg and some vanilla extract. Overall, though, very good recipe.

I made some slight changes. I did 3/4 cup white flour and 3/4 cup wheat flour. I changed to sugar for 1/2 cup honey and oil for 1/3 cup applesauce. I also did a little more banana and added more walnuts. This recipe is great!

Very tasty. I used whole wheat flour and I think I should have used a little less than the recipe calls for. But other than that, they turned out really well.

This was a favorite for my kids and especially my husband.  I was in such a rush that after I poured the batter in the muffin cases I noticed that I forgot to add the nuts, so I sprinkle them on top and push them in.  They still turned out delicious!

It tasted so light and delicious. Although, not being calorie conscious I used whole eggs and since I hate tough muffins I used cake flour so over mixing the batter would not be
a problem. When bananas could add so much
moister who needs buttermilk or yogurt? Thanks Mom!

I made this recipe for mini muffins, which were used for gift baskets for a conference. This recipe was awesome. The muffins smelled wonderful, and tasted even better, I did cut the lemon zest by half in my second batch. I will be using this recipe again. Thanks for posting it.

I didn't really know how to rate this recipe!  I could hardly stir the mixture together, (DRY).  I didn't have anymore bananas so I added some applesauce.  It made it so I could stir it but when the came out of the oven (and cooled slightly) they were a bit rubbery.  I will not be making them again.

I used a hefty 1 cup of mashed banana, omitted lemon zest, adding a couple drops of lemon juice, and only put the walnuts on top (no measuring).  Baked for 27 minutes in my stoneware muffin pan to get the perfect browning. Amazing muffins with the perfect amount of banana and walnuts!  I will make this again and again!

This has become my favorite recipe lately. I use whole wheat flour and make these as mini muffins (and cut the cooking time) every week for my toddler. They are a perfect snack. He thinks he's getting a sweet treat, and I feel like he's getting something healthy. Everyone I've made them for, including a lot of other  young kids, loves them. I highly recommend.

I omitted lemon zest and walnut; replaced 1/2 C of flour with bran and added 1/4 C flax seed (half ground and half whole); added 1/2 t cinnamon; ginger, all spice & nutmeg - 1/4 t each; replaced sugar with Splenda and reduced the amount to 1/2 C; replaced oil with prune juice and added drops of almond extract and coconut essence into the batch.  It's not fat free but you're getting good fats from the flax and with added bran for more fiber.

I think these muffins were wonderful. A little mild in flavor though. Next time I will be adding more bananas and walnuts. I hadn't read the reviews until after I made the muffins so I will def be making some changes. But overall they were great and came out nicely.

These are delicious! I use 3 TBS melted butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the white. I have made them with and without the lemon zest; they are good both ways but the zest certainly adds something. I like to make these each week with leftover, too-brown bananas, split them and freeze them so they're ready to toast for breakfast.

These were delicious but a little dry because I didn't add enough banana. The lemon zest was a nice touch, but next time I'll use half the amount so the lemon flavor isn't so dominant.

Changes to Recipe: Added 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar to reduce the sweetness.  Omitted the lemon zest...

Overall, these turned out nicely.  They are not gooey or extremely moist, but perfect for a breakfast topped with jelly, butter, etc.  I would make these again, however will add "banana nut bread spice" next time for more flavor.

I used: whole wheat flour, 2 whole eggs, light brown sugar, canola oil, dried orange zest, approx. 1 cup walnuts, 2 large bananas, cinnamon and vanilla powder. Still hot in the tins but the  one just sampled is pretty outstanding!

Much easier to make than I thought they would! I used three previously frozen bananas. They rose beautifully, but could use more flavor. Mine weren't overly banana-y. Perhaps some vanilla extract would improve the flavor.

Feel free to add some extra bananas and other fresh fruit... I ran out of bananas on the second batch so I added some strawberries and a couple tablespoons of orange marmalade. They were yummy! You could also use half whole wheat flour and half regular all purpose for a more earthy taste. If your watching what you eat these are great! Just don't expect decadent... they are just sweet enough and healthier than regular muffins. Super easy and I will definitely make these again! THankS!

I would love to give this 5 stars, but I made so many changes, I wouldn't be rating the original recipe.  It's an excellent base, though!  I wanted something a bit more nourishing (and wheat-free due to allergies), so I used 3/4 cup white spelt flour, 1/2 cup whole spelt flour, and 1/4 cup flaxmeal in place of the AP flour.  I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tbs. agave syrup and 1 packet of stevia in place of the white sugar, and I reduced the oil (olive) to 2 tbs.  I whipped the egg whites to soft peaks and folded them into the batter with the nuts at the end.  They baked for 20 minutes and came out beautifully--light and fluffy!  My only complaint is that while I filled 12 standard-sized muffin cups, there was only enough batter to fill the cups halfway, and the result was teeny tiny muffins!  This recipe really only makes enough batter for 8 standard-sized muffins.

Simply delicious muffins! I used freshly ground white wheat (lighter than standard red wheat and very healthy) The muffins were awesome. I plan to use only 1/2 cup sugar next time. Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for a lighter banana muffin recipe but one that my kids would still enjoy.  This recipe fit the bill!  They LOVED them and I did too.  I did make a few minor modifications. I left out the lemon, used one whole egg instead of 2 whites, used 2T oil instead of three, used 1 1/2 cups of banana, added 1/2 tsp. Pampered chef cinnamon blend and lastly added 2 T. wheat germ to the flour.  It sounds like I changed too much but really it was quick, easy, light and tasty.  Great basic recipe without all the butter and oil in typical muffins but not tough like some low fat recipes.

Very moist, great flavor, but changed a few things.  Added a tsp. of vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon, but omitted the lemon zest.  Also added a tbsp. of sour cream as I do with banana nut bread.  Turned out great, will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe because I always have everything on hand to make them.  They come out a little dense, but they are a healthy, filling snack, and they do taste and smell lovely.  I add a heaping handful of walnets, some cinnamon and a little vanilla when I make these.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very quick, easy, & delicious! I didn't get 12 muffins, but got 10 (I divided them with an ice cream scoop to ensure the same size for every muffin). All 10 disappeared within the first 30 minutes out of the oven. I also added 1 Tsp of vanilla, 1 Tsp of cinnamon, and used 1/2 cup of walnuts.

These were a hit with my toddler! To make them a little more healthy, I only used 1/2c sugar, replaced 1/4c flour with whole wheat, & replaced oil w/ applesauce. I was just short of one cup banana, so I went out on a limb & added sweet potato puree to make up the difference (had some in the freezer); gave them a buttery flavor - yum.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe.  The batter was very dry so I added a 1/4 cup of milk.  The flavor was there BUT it lacked moisture.  This is the first muffin recipe I've come across that doesn't have liquid (milk) in it.  Three tbsp vegetable oil is definitely not enough.

This recipe was ok.  I think it would have been better if I would have followed it exactly. I doubled the recipe using 1/2 ww flour and didn't have any veg. oil after all my holiday baking so I used melted margarine.  The muffins were ok, but nothing special.  I am continuing my search for a healty muffin that doesn't taste boring!

These are fantastic. I used three banana's, added a smidgen of vanilla and exchanged the nuts for 1/2 cup of chocolate chips due to allergies.

Weren't spectacular, but no real complaints. Used the lemon zest, but couldn't really taste much of it in the muffins. Also, didn't have any walnuts on hand so substituted chopped cashews. (omitted the salt to balance). The kids love them and they're definitely a "healthier" muffin. Overall a good go-to recipe for those elderly bananas.

I substituted 1/8 cup of Splenda brown sugar blend for 1/4 cup of the white sugar and they were absolutely yummy! I forgot the lemon zest so they were missing that little zing, but will definitely make these again. I had 4 very small overripe bananas that were the perfect amount. I also made only 8 muffins because I like them that way and my kids are going to eat the whole batch no matter what the size!

These turned out delicious!  I had to make a few adjustments simply because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I used unbleached whole-wheat flour (a preference) and replaced the sugar with 1/4c. Splenda Brown Sugar and 1/2c. Splenda.  I used one whole egg and since I didn't have any baking soda (I know.. I know), I went without.  I also didn't have plain walnuts so I crushed up some Pralines. I love to cook but have a tendency to be a very bad baker.  But oh my did these turn out great!  My husband gobbled them right up!  The lemon zest was an absolute prefect compliment and made them taste very fresh.  I will definitely be making these again and will try varying up the fruit selection.  Thanks for the recipe!!

These came out great!  As a single girl I always har some bananas that go to waste (but not enough for bread) so this is a great way to use them. I followed the comments' suggestion and carefully folded wet ingredients into dry and they came out perfectly moist. I sprinkled raw sugar on top for a candied effect on top.

My husband (Mr. Picky)  says I never put enough nuts in banana bread. I saw this recipe and decided to make it instead of bread. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and two whole eggs. I dumped in 1 1/2 cups of walnut halves. He gave it a five. Will wonders never cease.

This recipe is perfect.  I made the muffins with this recipe once before (with three bananas), but I only had one large banana this time.  It was still excellent.  I would not change anything about this recipe.  Fabulous.

I think it was my fault, but I will try these again.  I usually LOVE lemon zest in recipies, but it didn't work for me here.  I zested 1/2 lemon - maybe that was more than the 1tsp it called for.  Also, I don't know how fresh my nuts were - and they were pecans.  Hey - it is a rainy day and I wanted to make something without going out of the house!  Like I said, I will try again - my husband and I LOVE banana nut muffins.

When I was beating the bananna's, I added a pinch of cinnamon and the egg yolks.   Simply forgot to add the oil and they seemed to work just fine without it.  Subsituted sultana's for walnuts, but both work equally well.  I usually use less sugar, and turn this into a grab-n-go breakfast.

The batter was really thick and hard to stir, and the muffins came out really dense. They tasted pretty good but I don't think I will be making these again.

Delicious. I followed the directions exactly, except I added some cinammon, and used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 of the vegetable oil called for. I also added a handful of chocolate chips (cant help it, I love bananas and chocolate!). Once the muffins were done, I let them cool until I could handle them and placed them in an air-tight container. They have remained moist and tasty, and I will likely make these again. Next time, I may try 1/2 ww flour and 1/2 white.

Made these muffins exactly as stated in the recipe. They are delicious and come together very quickly.  My favorite part is the texture.  They are lighter than other banana muffins I've tried in the past.

The muffins were pretty small but it still tasted good. Not my favorite banana nut muffin recipe I've tasted but a nice healthier alternative.

These were perfect, and just what I was looking for to use up some very sad banana sitting on the counter. Two days later, and they are still tender and moist. I did swap pecans for walnuts, used 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg whites, and changed up the order for combining the ingredients. Next time I am going to try them with macadamia nuts. Hopefully, that will be as good as I am thinking in my head.

I made these today, I used 1 tsp of Vanilla Extract and a dash of cinnamon also omitted the oil and used 1/3 cup of unsweetened Apple Sauce in place of oil. Also cut back the sugar to 1/4 rather than 3/4 

and instead of All Purpose Flour I used Wheat Flour and I used 1 1/2 cups like I would of with all purpose flour and they were not too dense at all and they rised also added 1 cup of chopped walnuts and 3 whole banannas as well this made 1 dozen perfect yummy Healthy Muffins ! Would make again for sure .... High in Protein and good carbs ! low in calories also !! 

Hope this helps with my tweaks to the original recipe.

Most cooks like to tweek a recipe, as do I.  I love to read what others have tried.  I used 1 cup all-purpose & 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I also used 2 whole eggs, but also added 1/3 cup sour cream and 1/3 cup apple sauce as did some others.  I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and the zest of a small orange along with the lemon zest (a must).  I find walnuts can be bitter so I always used my Georgia pecans.  Baked at 350 for 22 minutes and they are the best we have had.  Baked them for friends at the marina and they loved them.  Thanks to all who review.

For a less healthy alternative of this recipe: I ixnay'd on the lemon zest, kept the egg yolks, added an extra 1/3 cup of sugar,  1/2 cup of bananas, and 1 cup of walnuts. And a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Turned out scrumptious.

Very nice! I made only half a recipe and got 10 muffins, I used one egg, no lemon peel, and I didn't really measure the bananas, I put 3 medium bananas in and a handful of walnuts. They just came out of the oven, they smell so good and the texture is soft and moist but not greasy. A keeper!

This is a great basic recipe that I changed quite a bit & made it gluten-free & a ton healthier.  I substituted rice flour for all-purpose, almonds instead of walnuts, coconut oil instead of vegetable and added blueberries and flax seeds.  I also kept the eggs whole because, frankly, I was lazy (but whites only would have kept it healthier).  Don't leave out the lemon zest.  It really adds a nice flavor profile.  I also added a little vanilla.

This recipe is not only easy, but delicious.  My husband and I both love them.  We will definitely be making them again!  We did not have lemon zest so I used half a tsp. of lemon extract.  I also doubled the amount of walnuts because so many comments recommended to do so.

I loved this recipe! I had some bananas about to go bad in my kitchen and this is the best way to use them after they are browned. I did not use the lemon at all. I used the rest of the recipe and for an icing because I thought they were pretty floury I melted 1 tsp of butter and 1 tsp of brown sugar and drizzled them over each muffin. Delicious!

Quick to make and a nice little snack. Followed recipe minus lemon zest and they came out pretty good. They have just the right amount of banana not over powering. Next time I may add more walnut 1/2 cup at least and some milk like I've read in other reviews see if they come out a bit more moist. Will be making these very often.

This was a satisfying recipe! I did not have walnuts, so I couldn't add those.  We are 6,000ft about sea level so I added about 1/4 cups of skim milk because I knew the consistency of the recipe would dry out quickly.  I also added 1 1/4 teaspoons of vanilla, and cinnamon for taste.  They were DELICIOUS.   Everyone loved them! I will be using this recipe again :)

These muffins are okay, especially considering that they are much more healthy than your average banana nut muffin. I think I will add a few semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter next time to add a little sweetness.

These are delicious!  Mine rose really well, I baked at 360 and added a tiny bit more baking soda to a double batch just in case.  I didn't do nuts because it was for my daughter's class.  I added chocolate chips instead and they are absolutely perfect! I will be doing this one again for sure. Not too dense but not cakey either. Perfect muffin consistency.

I used whole wheat flour because that's all I have. For the sugar I used 1/2 c white and 1/4 c brown. I skipped the lemon, and used fat free vanilla yogurt in place of the oil. Since the 6 year old doesn't like nuts, and the 10 month old, only has one tooth... I didn't add the walnuts to the batter, and instead sprinkled them on top of half, and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. It made 24 mini muffins (10 minutes) and 2 large (20 minutes). They're delicious and moist, I'll definitely make them again!

I have always loved this Recipe as written. I have made it many times with rave reviews.Having the Grandkids over for the weekend, I planned on making them, but someone ate half my bananas, darn! Probably the Wifey! Lol!So, having only half the amount, I peeled and shredded a Granny Smith Apple and added it. Then I realized I didn’t have a Lemon for zest, so I used an orange! It was still awesome as the original recipe!But, who am I, to write a recommendation! I’m just a “Guy in the Kitchen”

I substituted applesauce for the oil, added 1/4 cup more chopped walnuts, 1/2 cup more banana, and made a crumbled topping of oats, turbinado cane sugar, cinnamon and softened butter.  Came out moist with a bit of a crunchy topping—delicious!

Wish this recipe would have said how many muffins it made. Ended up doubling it because I thought it would only make a 1/2 dozen. Ended up making 2 dozen.
Still came out delicious

This was the first muffin recipe I've ever made. It was flavorful and moist. I just had to double the walnut amount. This is a keeper.

I really loved these! I did not make any changes as it was the first time I was making this recipe. It really is perfect as it is. I was a bit skeptical about the lemon zest but it ties in perfectly. I will definitely make these again.

The taste is fine, but they didn't come out muffin-ey. They were very dense and dry. The only things I changed was doubling the walnuts and leaving out the lemon (I didn't have any). These two things would not affect the consistency of the batter. It's missing some milk, yogurt, or something wet to make them less dense and more moist. I most likely will not make this recipe again.

Easy tasty banana muffins. I'm not looking for low fat, rather no milk or butter.  I  use 2 whole eggs. My son doesn't like nuts so omitted them.  Large bananas was enough.  Maybe I made them smaller, but I got 18 muffins out of a batch.

Good, moist muffin. I used less sugar but regretted it. Next time will use all the sugar called for or add mini chocolate chips. Definitely recommend this muffin!

I used half applesauce/half vegetable oil and added 3/4 cup of walnuts instead, and they turned out delicious! Moist muffins with a good amount of crunch. They were a hit with everyone at my house. Definitely will be making these again.

Excellent muffins! The texture of these muffins are perfect! I was a little skeptical because of the two egg whites and the reduced amount of oil, but these are better than any other banana muffin I've made and they're low calorie too. Delicious!!

Changes I made were I used 2 whole eggs instead of only egg whites, used a little extra mashed banana, and pecans instead of walnuts.  Family enjoyed them.

It's good. I substituted the all purpose flour with wheat flour, the oil with apple sauce, and I did not add the lemon zest. I also added a few splashes of apple juice because it seemed too thick. But it was delicious!

I changed the lemon zest for cinnamon (used the same amount), used 2 whole bananas, used 2 whole eggs (yolk and egg white), and did 3/8 C white sugar and 3/8 C brown sugar. Other than that I kept everything the same. They turned out moist, soft, and delicious. Would definitely make these again!

These were really good!!!  I used walnuts as the nuts, and added extra bananas and nuts.  I also omitted the lemon zest, as we didn't have any.

I skipped the lemon zest, doubled the walnuts, and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Topped with a basic streusel topping. Might consider substituting half the oil with peanut butter and/or adding chocolate chips and/or peanut butter chips.

These came out very delicious! I did not put lemon zest in mine simply because I did not have any and only used walnuts in half of the batch. I put semi-sweet chocolate chips in the other half of the batch.

I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and made a topping that really added some flavor.  Mix 1/4 cup each of brown sugar, melted butter, nuts (I used pecans) and rolled oats and sprinkle on top before you put into the over.

I changed the recipe a little- 2 banannas, 1 tsp. vanilla, 2 whole eggs, extra walnuts.  I loved this !  The bread/dough is just right, 
made 6 large muffins and filled them 3/4 full and turned out great!
 I will be making these muffins from now on instead of banana bread!
  Oh I also added about 1/2 cup of dried blueberrys :).
