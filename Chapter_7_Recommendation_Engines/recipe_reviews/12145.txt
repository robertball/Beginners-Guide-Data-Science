Wow!!! This was already a great recipe but I took it over the top!!!!  I made my crust with oreo cookies and butter.  I also put caramel in holes after I took the pie out of the oven.  Then I made fudge brownies and broke them up and mixed them with melted semi-sweet chocolate and layer it over the pie on top of the caramel.  Then I added the whipped cream and on top of that put shaved chocolate and strings of fudge topping and caramel topping.  I'm a hit!!!

Great pie. I made the following modifications: 
- removed the nuts
- chopped up semisweet bakers chocoloate and sprinkled it over the fudge
- placed the whipped cream on the side
It was a big hit. Super-dense-intense chocolation.

YUMMY DELICIOUS!!!   My husband can't get enough of this one!  I made one modification - I melted some chocolate chips with 1/2 teaspoon shortening in the microwave and drizzled it over the whipped cream.  Watch out for adding extra nuts - we had too many.  We all agreed that the pie base would also be great served warm with ice cream, omitting the whipped cream.  Its a very flexible pie.

The recipe was great- I made it for my friend's birthday and our classmates devoured it. Personally, it was too chocolatey for me but noone else minded! I used "hot fudge sauce II" from this website and it worked very well.

Love this recipe, it's very rich though so do expect to take a large portion at one time.

This is a keeper!  The only change I made was to add the whipped cream at serving.  This is very easy and company worthy.

Very good and fairly easy to make.  I added a decorated topping for a special potluck.  Enjoyed and photograped by all.  One fellow from the South said he was a Mudpie expert.  He rated this among the best he has had.  Can't go wrong, try it.
