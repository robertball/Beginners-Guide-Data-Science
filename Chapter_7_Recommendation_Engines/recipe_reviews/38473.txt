I have never cooked ribs of any kind before, so am a total and complete novice in this field.  I followed this recipe exactly (well, I used a little extra maple syrup and no sesame seeds) and these came out as the best ribs I have ever had, and I have eaten ribs many times in good restaurants!  I highly reccomend this recipe to anyone, novice or otherwise, who loves great ribs.  Especially if, like me, you like your ribs saucy, sweet and slightly spicy.  I have the recipe memorized now, I have cooked it so often since I first used it!  Go for it, it rocks!

I love this recipe. My husband couldn't stop raving about the taste. I didn't bake the ribs, I boiled them, then put them in the oven with the sauce on them. This has just the right amount of sweetness and them the orange taste comes through. This is a keeper for sure.

These were pretty good, my family enjoyed them.  I probably would have used less orange juice concentrate and curry as it seemed like that's all I could taste, but I'm pregnant so my taste buds may be off.  I also had to cook them a little longer than listed as I like lots of sauce and the sauce is a bit thin.  We did not use the sesame seeds.  Excellent paired with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes.

YUMMY! This is a GREAT rib recipe... I followed it to the letter except for the sesame seeds. Left them out because I didn't have them on hand. Thought the combination of ingredients sounded a bit weird, but it really worked together well. I will make these again for sure!!!

I really liked these ribs... MMM fall off the bone baby!!!! I think the best ribs are the kind you can use JUST a fork to eat. They are a little sweet though. I think they are best served with something else like steak, or chicken with a regular BBQ sauce on the beef, or chicken or however you like your steak/chicken. Just something to break up the flavor. Also I flavored the ribs with Hickordy Smoked Salt made by McCormick. I find that gives the pork a nice smoked flavor.  I don't know if I liked the seaseme seeds or not. My wife liked them, I didn't think they were horrable, but I plan to leave them off my ribs next time to see if it makes  diffrence. Jessica felt the seeds gave it a nice flavor, so I would suggjest trying them at least as you may be like her, and like them.

My family and I really enjoyed these.  Everyone left with a copy of the recipe.  It was my first time cooking for a group of 10.  I was intimidated just walking into the butcher shop to buy them.  I used Beef Ribs.  At the end, everyone was licking their fingers.  Thanks!!

I have made this recipe 3 times.  It is great, not too sweet, and I prefer to use real maple syrup over the artificial maple syrup as it gave the ribs a subtle flavor.  This is a winner.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  We used side ribs and cooked them on a rack with a pan to catch the drippings and they turned out perfecty yummy, just falling off the bone.

Everyone liked them. They looked beautiful, and they were not at all difficult. The prebaking can be done ahead. Then jus refigerate the ribs in the sauce and add 10 minutes to the baking time. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this recipe for an end-of-the-year pool party when my son was in Kindergarten. Now my son is finishing up 5th grade and both the pool party and the ribs are a tradition that everyone looks forward to. We need to ration the ribs in the beginning so everyone gets a chance to eat some. I have been increasing the amount I make each year and thus far have never had leftovers. Last year I prepared 25 pounds of ribs and there were still no leftovers.
I have found that the sauce is enough for about twice the amount of ribs. In addition, I bake the ribs with the sauce for 1 to 1 1/2 hours to thicken it up nicely. The ribs are not difficult to make, but you do need to allow quite a bit of time to prepare them.
Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

I've been making these for years and am always asked for the recipe.  When in a pinch, these changes will also work.
- Sub regular syrup for the maple
- Sub regular OJ for the concentrate
- Thicken the sauce with some bbq sauce to cook on the grill

This was excellent!  I used country pork ribs because it's what I had and it was awesome.  The meat was tender and the flavor was so good.  I didn't have a rack so I just used a baking pan and drained the fat before adding the sauce.  Will definetly make again.

Picked it for a different option than BBQ ribs and it was a nice change!   Sauce thickened up nicely. Cooked 325 for about 1.5 hrs because my oven runs a bit hot.

I made this for a family BBQ and it turned out great! I boiled the ribs for thirty minutes, then baked them in the oven for an hour on 350 degrees. Then I grilled them for about fifteen minutes, flipping them every five minutes.  The meat was falling off the bone. Great recipe.

I thought it was a "4", my son a "3", my girlfriend a "3.5". They had issues with the amount of meat on the bone (not the recipe's fault), and she prefers "tangy" over sweet, (again, not the fault of the recipe). I love 'sweet'- especially with ribs. This came out very well overall.
Will do it again.

FANTASTIC!  I've always made ribs with BBQ sauce or rubs - this was a great variation.  I used orange juice instead of concentrate.  Made it with stir fry veggies and homemade fried rice - no leftovers!

These are the bomb.  My loving boyfriend asks me to make them all the time.  I usually make something salty with them, like macaroni and cheese.  They're almost Asian-like.  The maple syrup is not overpowering, but they are pretty rich.  Try these!!!!

I have never had good success cooking ribs, that is until now.  My family ate this up quick.  The only change I made was using fresh squeezed orange juice in place of concentrate.  I put in one extra tablespoon.

This was a great recipe.  My family loved the ribs, very tender. This is definitely a keeper.  I din't have a pan so I did use a roaster which worked well but I should have cooked them till they got a bit crispier but otherwise it was delicious.

Outstanding! I used boneless ribs and put them in a dish with two-thirds of the sauce (instead of cooking the suace over low heat)to save time. Then put the remainder of the sauce 10 min before they were done. This ROCKS!!!!

I cooked the ribs in the crock pot then poured the glaze over it, and put it in the oven. They turned out pretty good. My family and boyfriend enjoyed it. I'm not really a fan of the flavor, but I'm picky, and I think it was just fine if you like that flavor.

This was great!  I always do oven-baked ribs, but don't like dealing with the fat that collects in the pan and muddies the sauce.  Putting the ribs on a rack and then basting with the sauce at the end was an excellent solution.  Wonderful flavor and easy sauce.  Thanks!

Loved! I used to slow cook in the oven all day, not anymore! I tweaked the recipe based on what I had on hand. Dry rubbed with s&p, chinese five spice,chili powder, garlic and onion powder and Mrs Dash Steak spice. Followed the cooking time exactly and the ribs turned out amazing! I subbed the ketchup for a Tbsp of Hoisin Sauce and Aunt Jamima Lite for pure maple. Omitted oj and curry. Fall off the bone! Thank you for proving you don't have to slave in the kitchen all day!

These are amazing!  I didn't use pure maple syrup...just the cheap stuff (it works just fine) and I used orange juice instead of the concentrate.  I never really poured the sauce over the ribs but just basted them a lot with it.  Used black sesame seeds.  These are so flavorful!  Huge hit!

My family loved this recipe! I used boneless country ribs instead of the boned and the meat just fell apart.  I also used fresh OJ instead of the concentrated.  They were delicious.

These were excellent!  I served them with an asian coleslaw and orange slices for four people and there were no leftovers.

I made this recipe exactly as written.   The meat was extremely flavourful & very tender.   We will definately be making this again.

I followed the recipe except I reduced the syrup by 1/4 & added maple whiskey instead.

Great taste.  Used regular quality orange juice in place of the concentrated stuff.  Will certainly use this recipe again.  Easy and good.  No need to preboil.  I like that.

I'm making these for the second time today. The first time, I delivered a TRIPLE batch of the ribs (and about a double quantity of glaze) to our local volunteer firefighters' meeting, and there wasn't a single rib left. Tonight, they're going with me to a fireworks-watching party.  The only change I make is that I finish the ribs in a crock pot because they're easier to transport and keep warm that way. As another reviewer said, definitely use real maple syrup; it's a much better taste than pancake syrup. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made it in a baking tray and it turned out very nice. However, the meat was not exactly fall-of-the-bone so next time I will boil the ribs first as per Sylvia's Ribs recipe.

Just not a big fan of sweet ribs. Flavor was good but it was to sweet for me.

Absolutely amazing tasting ribs!  I made these for a family get together (doubled the recipe) and there were no left overs.  The recipe is alittle on the sweet side due to the maple syrup, but the curry compliments the sweetness.  The taste is to die for!

The sauce was kinda overpowering and strange tasting. My family didn't like it and it was a disappointing dish. Will not make again.

This makes an awesome sauce.  Would be good on any pork dish, or even as a bbq sauce for the grill.  Thought the spare ribs were a little tough still.  May need to alter time depending on cut of meat.  I'm thinking orange juice can be substituded with pineapple or limeade concentrate for an interesting twist.

I must say I didnt care for this recipe.  I personally thought it was too sweet tasting, but I am more into spicy ribs than sweet ribs...personal opinion.  My guests said they liked it though.

My whole family loved these ribs and insisted that I rate it a 5 out of 5, but even though I thought that they were great, I have had better. They are well worth trying.
