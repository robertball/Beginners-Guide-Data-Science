This recipe was very easy and good. I did make a couple of changes. I added 1 cup chicken broth along with the wine also 1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning. I felt the cooking time was long for boneless chicken so I cut back. I used the cherry tomatoes but next time will use plum tomatoes seeded and chopped. I served over pasta but think it would be even better over rice. Topped with parmesan. Will make again. Thanks.

Wonderful! Added a bit of italian seasoning and used capers instead of olives. I also sauteed some onions with the garlic. Served over rice and was a big hit. This ones a keeper!

We found it basically flavorless. A cup of wine and some garlic is not a "sauce." We had to doctor it a lot to make it edible' we added caramelized onions sauteed mushrooms Italian seasonings a balsamic vinegar reduction etc. I feel sorry for people who think this is "Italian."

I like this recipe but I did have to add some personal touches to it. I always sautee my onion peppers and garlic together first. I am on a low sodium diet so I use alot of Mrs dash. I try to make things palatable to 5 kidz and stay in my diet (I have congestive heart failure). I love chicken but fryed is just kinda old school. I put black olives in it and sometimes some zuchini as well. I used chopped tomatoes in my sauce. But this is a good base recipe.
