This was a really good.  But Remember to not add the coconut until the end because it will turn brown.

Not Bad, but it had a very strong pineapple flavor, even though I only used 2 cups of pineapple juice. So, if you love pineapple, this is for you, otherwise, its not that great.

Really good. Used Splenda & Bisquick pie crust recipe. Put pineapple rings on the cooked crust & the mix on top. Also broiled the finished pie a few minutes to form a crust. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper ??
