I'm probably not the best person to review a recipe for Butterscotch Cake since I'm not a fan of butterscotch - it's difficult to be objective.  That said, I took into consideration a couple of reviewers' comments -  the cake was dry, the cake wasn't butterscotchy enough - and made a couple of changes to address them.  To add more butterscotch flavor I used  a butter pecan cake mix (just so happened to have one on hand) and substituted 1/4 cup of butterscotch schnapps for part of the milk called for.  An alternative might be to add some Watkins caramel flavoring or rum extract, maybe a teaspoon.  I couldn't see the point of using egg whites and wasting four egg yolks - this isn't a white cake.  So I used whole eggs - two instead of the four egg whites called for and a third for added moistness.  While the cake was cooling I kind of just winged it and threw together a butterscotch glaze using butterscotch chips, heavy cream, and just a little butter and corn syrup (for gloss).  The verdict?  The small changes must have worked because it's moist and butterscotchy, so butterscotch lovers (like Hubs) will be pleased!

Love this recipe! So easy and quick! I don't care for the confectioner's sugar, so I used melted cream cheese frosting as a drizzle topping, delicious!

I've tried several butterscotch cake recipies and this is the best.  This cake is very easy and very impressive.  I like to add a glaze made with melted butterscotch chips.  This is definitely one to try!

This recipe is so easy and I have made it several times. Sometimes I keep it simple and opt for powdered sugar on top. Other times I make my own butterscotch glaze with melted butterscotch chips mixed with some milk and powdered sugar until reaching desired consistency. I make sure I have these ingredients on hand when I am craving an easy cake that is tasty too! My boyfriend loves this cake.

This cake was awesome!!!!  I made it for a large family gathering and everyone loved it! I made a glaze with the butterscotch chips, powdered sugar and milk and then I just bought a can of chcolate frosting and microwaved it to melt it and then poured that on top of the butterscotch glaze. It was absolutely TDF!  I will be making it again!!

Used a butter flavored cake mix and followed another reviewer and used 1/4 cup of Butterscotch Schnapps for an equal portion of the milk. Flavor was great, definately butterscotch. Thanks for sharing!

I'm not a huge butterscotch fan, either, but I have been on a mission for the last few months for a good recipe and this is it!  It was quick and easy and good!  No frosting even required!  Gonna' test this on my family over the holidays!  I used yellow butter cake mix.

I made this cake in a 9x13 pan and topped it with the "Chocolate 
Frosting II" recipe. (also on allrecipes.com) I then sprinkled it with halloween sprinkles and it looked great and was a HUGE hit.  So moist and really, really tasty. I'm going to try with different flavors of pudding.  Very easy to make!

Ended up doing 1 1/3C milk and 1/3C oil; also used 3 whole eggs which seemed to work out fine.  These were basically the directions on the box.  For glaze I put over med heat 4T butter and 1/4C milk, stir to boiling. Remove from heat add 1/4C confectioner sugar and 1C butterscotch chips... liquid gold! Thanks for the recipe.

Loved it!  Made it for work and everyone wanted the recipe!!!  I was a little worried because the batter was so thick, but it came out just right!  For a topping, I warmed some jarred white frosting and spooned it on top and then sprinkled chopped butterscotch chips on top.  Yummy!! Thank you!

This was quite delicious; I did make a few changes:
1) I couldn't find a Vanilla or Butter Pecan cake mix, so I used a Butter mix, and that was quite good.
2) I didn't feel like having to make pudding--even if it were instant--so, I bought ready-made pudding in cups and used two of those, (6.8 oz instead of 3.25). As I was putting it in, I thought, "What am I doing. . . ?" since it was so much more, but it made the cake very butterscotchy, which was great.
(One thing I did find, and I'm not sure if this is because of all the extra pudding I put in, but the powdered sugar just soaked into the cake. This wasn't something I could powder the night before; it's a do-it-right-before-serving addition.)
3) I didn't make a bundt cake. I made two 9-inch cakes, baked for 30 minutes at the instructed degrees. Perfect!
Great recipe---everyone enjoyed it. :)

I also am not a huge butterscotch fan but my hubby wanted a cake for his b-day - so... 

I took what others had said about moistness and flavor.  I used three full eggs and followed the rest of the recipe as noted.  I did not try the schnapps.  Then I put in 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips that I rolled in flour first to keep from sinking to the bottom.  

The cake itself was nice and moist but not butterschotchie enough. I should've known but didn't have the schnapps.

For frosting I made a standard cream cheese(1 brick cream cheese,  powered sugar to taste, 1/4 stick of butter) I still had some butterscotch chips left so I used 3/4 c. and melted them in the microwave with a bit of milk - enough to thin it so I could pour it into the frosting.  That made all the difference.  As a nice garnish I melted some caramel and semi-sweet chips and drizzled it over the top.  It was decadent.

The frosting together with the cake was a show stopper.  I would also try doing a layer cake with maybe some chocolate in the middle.

I made this cake and followed someone else's review of changing the 4 egg whites to 3 eggs and substituting 1/4c. of milk for 1/4c. of butterscotch schnapps. It worked out great!  My only recommendation is this. I set the oven as it called for at 350 and the timer for 50 min. Right before the timer was to go off I started smelling a burning smell. After I cooled the cake in the pan for 10 min. and turned it out onto the cooling rack I noticed that it was black in spots and had a burnt smell to it. I threw it out, rebaked a new cake but this time set the timer for 40 min. and checked it. It needed just a couple minutes more. My oven may bake a bit hotter I don't know, but just thought I'd share my experience.

This was a very moist, simple cake.  My husband loved it, but he could have used more butterscotch flavor.

This was just okay for us.  I think it has to do with personal preference and the butterscotch taste was just okay to us.  Thanks for letting us try

I needed something quick and happened to have the ingredients.  I made this exactly as written and thought it was just a nice cake, moist and tasty.  I sifted some confectioners sugar on top.  Family really loved it and son just asked for it for his Bday, so I guess it's a keeper.  With some of the reviewers additions and suggestions I think I would like it more myself.

I put in 3 whole eggs and while it was very tasty and moist, it didn't rise very much.  I topped it with a simple glaze of butterscotch chips thinned with a little almond milk.

I had a small box of butterscotch pudding (not quite 3 ounces, like the recipe suggested) that I wanted to use up so this recipe was perfect.  It ended up making about 16 cupcakes.  Even with the smaller box of pudding the flavor was delicious.  I topped them with some caramel frosting and it made a tasty snack.

This was an awesome recipe! My kids, mom and co-workers devoured it. The only thing I did different was to add some butterscotch chips after mixing because I only had a 1 oz. box of pudding mix. Very delicious and easy!

I'm sorry to say that I found this cake very dry. The glaze on top helped some (butterscotch chips, powdered sugar, and milk), but I doubt I'll ever make it again. The only thing that might have made a difference in my preparation is that I made the cake a day prior to applying the glaze. Maybe if I'd poured the glaze over a warm cake my outcome would have been different.

Made it in cupcake form for a bunch of friends and they loved it! It's great because it's quick and the ingredients are relatively cheap. I added butterscotch chips and a pinch of sugar right on top of each cupcake before baking, turned out very butterscotch-y. I just wish I had made more.
