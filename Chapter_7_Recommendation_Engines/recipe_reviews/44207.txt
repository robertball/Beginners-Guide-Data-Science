A great recipe-- my husband doesn't like most meatballs, but he loves these.  I skip the step of browning them on the stove, and just put them straight in the oven.  I use 1/3 cup measure when I'm making the meatballs so they're all the same size.

These are really good.  I made them with the beef, turkey & sausage just like the recipe called for. I used a 1/4 cup measure to portion out the meat.  I got 22 meatballs. I would make this again.

These are very moist and flavorful.  They also freeze really well for a quick weeknight dinner!

This is a WONDERFUL recipie!  I think it's the best made with hot italian sausage.  Then after the meatballs are browned in a pan, I transfer them to a baking pan, pour a jar of spaghetti sauce over them and bake.  Then top with parmesan cheese.  Yummy!

My own meatball recipe is very similar to this one.  I only used half the amount of oats and bread crumbs in this recipe.  In it's place I used a 1/2 cup of fresh shredded romano cheese and sometimes fresh chopped parsley!!  Since I usually cook my small to medium sized meatballs in red sauce I don't pre-brown them.  I also use minced onions and not chopped.  I tried the Quick Pasta Sauce recipe with the meatballs and cooked on low 3 hours on the stovetop.

These are truly awesome meatballs!  I always like to use ground turkey with my meatballs anyway, and I think the oatmeal added to this recipe really helps to set up the meatballs.  This is definitely a "keeper" for my family!

Yummy!  I added some fennel seed and a few drops of hot sauce.  I got a bunch of compliments on them, especially because it was my first time making meatballs.  Thanks :)

I made this last year for xmas eve, and they were the biggest hit. We always have a traditional Italian dinner. It has already been "requested" that I make them again.  This Italian family loves them!!

These are freakin awesome!  I made some smaller and some bigger and had a total of 52 meatballs!  I saved them for later!  After cooking in the oven, they are perfect for just an appetizer.  Bite size to pop in your mouth, I ate 3 before putting them in sauce to simmer.  I found if you didnt brown the whole meatball, you had a flying saucer shaped meatball but still flippin tasty!  I used a half pound of spicy italian sausage and it gave a nice little kick!  My new favorite food!  SO GOOD!

Excellent. Used mild Italian sausage. Added some dried green/red pepper flakes and a little black pepper - otherwise just as published. Made 2 dozen nice-sized meatballs. Used nine with spaghetti sauce and divided rest into freezer bags for future dinners. We'll see how they do in the freezer!

I've made these a few times now. I stick to the recipe and I've been happy with the results everytime. These go nicely with any marinara sauce.

Pretty tasty! I just used 1.2 lb ground turkey and 1 lb of Italian turkey sausage and kept the same amount of other ingredients. It made about 21 meatballs. I poured a jar of tomato basil pasta sauce and a can of diced tomatoes over the top. Then sprinkled on parmesan cheese. Served with wheat spaghetti for a delicious healthy dinner. Big hit with the guys!

Awesome meatball recipe, great flavor and very most and tender.  I recommend backing off the onion a little bit, nothing wrong with the flavor, but I got a little too much texture from the onions than I would prefer. Perhaps just a fine chop would work well.

This was a great basis for the meatballs I was hoping to make.  I added 3 cloves of garlic and some shallots, italian parsley, oregano (all minced) along with a little salt, pepper, and olive oil.  I also omitted the oats and substituted with 1/4 cup more bread crumbs and 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese.  The texture was awesome, and the flavors came out just the way I'd hoped.

Yay! I found the meatball recipe I needed.  Excellent flavor and texture.  I've tried several meatball recipes and this finally has the flavor I'm looking for.  I used mild italian sausage. I browned in the pan as suggested and am pleased with the results.  Wasn't sure about using ground turkey but it worked!

My advice would be to add a bit of salt to the recipe.  The recipe made nearly 50 meatballs.  I baked mine in some leftover jarred spaghetti sauce.

I loved this! I used 3 lbs. of hamburger (what I had on hand) and the only thing I added that wasn't in the recipe was 1 1/2 tsp. of salt. I did everything else to spec and my family loved them!

Made a double batch. I did not 2 step bake them.  I just put them in the oven and it went fine.  I froze the 2nd 1/2 (unbaked) and used another time.  Froze and thawed well!! May even do 3 batches next time.  Super easy and tasty.... thanks.  MADE WITH "BEST MARINARA SAUCE YET" BY JACKIE..... FABULOUS!!!!!!!

I made so many meatballs that these were also sooo yummy not only with spaghetti sauce but I used some of the leftover meatballs and made a simple sweet and sour sauce and mixed w meatballs and finished with some basmati rice.. perfect meatballs that goes with so many different types of sauces or just plain! Thanks for the recipe! A+

Thanks for this incredibly simple, yet deliciously moist meatball recipe!  My whole family loved them and I will probably double the recipe the next time I make them since they were all fighting over them!!  After losing my old meatball recipe, I was hoping to find a good replacement and found that this one was even better than the one I used to have!!  I did use 2 lbs. of ground beef in place of the 1 lb. of ground turkey since I didn't have any on hand; however, I'm sure it would be fine either way. I also skipped step 3 (browning the meatballs) and just placed them directly into the oven - they browned up just fine.  Thanks again!

I followed the recipe as-is.  My meatballs came out tough.  I don't know - perhaps I packed them a little too much?  I do like the flavor, but the texture didn't work for me and my family.

These meatballs are good, but I actually found them a little bland, which was surprising, given their spicy aroma.  A good sauce would add more zest.

These were excellent! I didn't have turkey on hand; but used the sausage and beef, and only 1 egg. I was a bit skeptical at first; but these meatballs were very tasty!! A+

Served them as an appetizer... everyone loved them.  I left out the turkey, added some garlic powder, parmesian cheese, and parsley.  Turned out great.

SO GOOD!  I had yet to find a meatball recipe that my husband liked, but he absolutely loved these.  I used spicy Italian sausage and added garlic powder, oregano, basil, rosemary and black pepper for extra flavor... simply delish.

These meatballs were pretty good but I thought they were a little bland. Next time I will add Italian seasonings, parm cheese and some garlic. They were really moist though which is nice and the sausage is really a great touch. Good job Bruticus.

Nice recipe, and with three pounds of meat it makes a lot of meatballs. Enough to freeze some for sure! I broiled the meatballs instead of frying them, and then I simmered them in marinara sauce for about 25 minutes. Otherwise I made it as submitted.

Best meatball recipe I have tried by far. I skipped the step of browning the meatballs in the oil and baked them in sauce instead, but I think the browning might have added a nice texture...just didn't want to mess wit it. Very tasty. Served them over pasta. Makes a lot of meatballs. Very moist and flavorful. Nice texture and I am very picky about the texture of meatballs. Would be better if my knife skills were better....I can't quite get onions diced as fine as I'd like. May try doing the onions in the food pro next time. Highly recommended!

These are SO yummy!  I made these exactly as the recipe stated ( ok, not EXACTLY...  We have to eat gluten free, so no oats and brown rice crumbs in place of Italian bread crumbs).  They turned out just perfect. I am throwing half in a Swedish sauce, and the other half in a tomato based sauce. Thank you for this easy peasy recipe!

If you go with 1 cup of oats and drop the bread crumbs, these are gluten free!  You'll need to add some additional Italian Seasoning to make up for the seasoning in the bread crumbs.  I make these all the time for my family and no one knows the difference - but my gluten free daughter can eat them with us!  A real favorite.

Just okay. I thought they needed some salt - but didn't realize till they were cooked. Maybe subbing cheese for oats or crumbs as someone else suggested would help.

Delicious. Love the combination of flavors. Husband loved them too. We ate them sliced up on bread as a sandwich, but I'm sure they'd go great with pasta too.

Best meatballs I've ever eaten!!! I did a couple things different, I followed the ingredients but I put my oats into my magic bullet and grinded them into a fine powder and also added parmesan ramano cheese to it. Frying them in the pan before placing them in the oven makes them turn out so much better then baking alone. great recipe Thanks for sharing!

Excellent for second day meatball sandwich!: Pick up a fresh French bread at the market (2$), slice in half, broil (500) for a couple of minutes to toast. Cut the meatballs in half and heat in skillet, once hot, place them on the French bread, while heating meatballs, heat tomato pasta sauce of your choice (preferably spicy), once hot, spoon the sauce over the meatballs, sprinkle cheese on top (shredded provolone, mozzarella, asiago). Enjoy! Then run five miles ; )  --- By the way, as to the original recipe, I cut the onion to 1/2 instead of 1 whole.

We really liked these.  Made with "Best Marinara Sauce" recipe on this site.  Also, I skipped the browning step and baked at a little higher oven temp. until they were brown.

These were very good meatballs.  My turkey and ground beef amounts were slightly greater than the recipe called for, so after cooking a sample for seasoning, I found that I needed a bit more seasoning.  I added some garlic powder, about a half cup of parmigiano reggiano and a few good shakes of worcestershire sauce.  I did not brown them, I put them directly in my convection oven and then into a pot of pasta sauce.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

These meatballs were great!  I did make a few alterations.  I used ground pork instead of sausage, I added fresh garlic, a little nutmeg, and I fried them in extra virgin olive oil instead of veg oil.  Also, we made HUGE meatballs (about baseball size) We fried and baked them a little longer than directed becasue they were so big. They were fantastic! Recommended for sure!!!

Wonderful!  My husband could not stop eating them, and my 2 year old ate his fair share, too!  Due to some allergies, we cannot eat beef, so I used 1 and 1/2 lbs Italian sausage and 1 and 1/2 lbs turkey.  They were wonderfully spicy, moist, and delicious.  I also did not brown them before putting them in the oven.

This was disappointing. I did change it up a bit by omitting the turkey & oats. I added garlic powder also but it still turned out pretty bland.  It needs salt and/or more spices..was not as flavorful as I had hoped.  I had to drown it in pasta sauce which made it ok, but just a very so-so lifeless meal.

This is a great recipe and very easy.  I added 4 cloves of garlic which I sauteed with the onions.  I did go ahead and brown the meatballs, but I didn't add anything else to the pan, just used the same pan I'd used for the garlic and onion.  It didn't take too long and I think they turned out better than if they'd just been baked.  These went great on top of pasta with marinara sauce and fresh asparagus from our garden!

I made these pretty much by the recipe. The only difference being I did not bake them. Mine were only about 1.5 inches big, so once I browned them, they were cooked through. It made 50+ and I was able to get over half in the frying pan the first go round. It really only took about 30 minutes to brown them all. They were absolutely delicious!!!This is a definite Keeper!

I used 2# ground turkey and 1# turkey italian sausage.  Otherwise, followed this recipe exactly.  Delicious!  I will be making these again and again.  I fried them, as the recipe states, and the frying is a bit tedious in my opinion.  I wonder if they would taste as good if you skipped the frying and baked them.

This is by far the best meatball recipe because it's so easy AND it produces outstanding flavor every time.  Thanks for the recipe!  Goes great with "best marinara sauce yet," another easy crowd-pleaser on this site.

I thought this was a really good recipe, but my kids wouldn't touch them.  I think it was the oatmeal.  I even ground it up in my food processor so that it would be less noticeable, but they didn't like them one bit.  Great for adults, though.

Personally I make a simular meatball but I use ground lamb ground beef and ground Italian sausage and I use parm and mozzarella cheese rather than oats. Also I have found using crushed ritz crackers inplace of Italian bread crumbs give it a little saltness and less heavy Italian flavoring. After all the Italian sausage have that flavor already.

These were okay, but they would benefit from cheese and better spicing.  Not worth making again, IMHO.

I thought these were great. I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, so I used regular and added extra Italian seasoning, garlic, and salt. Will definitely be making these again!

Excellent meatballs.  I did adapt as I had hamburg, ground pork and ground turkey for meat.  I also added Fennel Seed as another reviewer recommended and thought they had an awesome flavor.  Fennel is not overpowering, perfect!  I used brown gravy on top and served as appetizer with tooth picks!

Best recipe for Meatballs Ive tried on this site! I did make some tweaks: Didnt have beef so I used 1 lb hot italian sausage and 1 lb turkey. Used 1/3 cup bread crumbs, 1/3 cup oats, half an onion, one egg, and added garlic. Once they were done cooking in the oven, I put them on a baguette bread with marinara sauce and sprinkled mozzarella on it and popped back in the oven for 8 mins or so at 410 degrees just to melt and brown the cheese. Hubby said it was the best meatballs I ever made :-D Very delicious.

These are great meatballs! I used ground sausage instead of beef (can't have it), then used 3 eggs,1 C.oats instead of bread, and I also added 3 cloves of chopped garlic.This made huge meatballs that I just browned in a pan and then poured over it: 29 oz. Hunts Tomato Sauce, 1 tsp brown sugar, 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp. Oregano, 1/2 tsp. Thyme, 1/2 tsp. Basil,and 1 Bay leaf(let it simmer in a pan a little bit before pouring over it.)Let it simmer till meatballs are done then add 2 C. shredded Mozz.and continue cooking till cheese is melted.Also makes great meatball sandwiches!

So far this recipe is the best we've had. I made meatball sandwiches with them and my entire family LOVED them and want it again, anytime. My husband has been wanting a different meatball recipe for a while and I couldn't find any he liked until now. I have 3 teenagers and they all gave me the thumbs up. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, it is AWESOME!

Great meatballs!!  I used 2 lbs of ground beef and 1 lb of Italian sausage, added 4 cloves of diced garlic and left out the bread crumbs.  They turned out great.  After cooking, I cut them in half and put them on a hoagie roll with some marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese and put in the oven until the cheese melted.  Wonderful.

I added two minced anchovy fillets, a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, and some salt, maybe a teaspoon or so, into the mix.

They were awesome.  Thank you very much for this great recipe!

Although they were ok, they weren't anything that great.  My husband is still munching on them (I froze about half the batch after they were cooked).  I probably won't make this recipe again.
