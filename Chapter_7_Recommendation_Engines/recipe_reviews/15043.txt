This recipe was so quick and easy but didn't taste like it. It was just like the soup that is served at a local Mexican restaurant that my husband and I frequent. I was so fond of that soup that I have asked my daughter to consider working there part time just to get the recipe; now she is off the hook.
I added a 4oz can of chopped chili peppers to spice it up, and since I like a more brothy soup, I will increase the broth, spices, and salsa the next time I make it.

This is a very easy recipe to make and very very flavorful. I highly recommend it to Tortilla soup lovers.
To save time, use regular tortilla chips. As good and much quicker.

This was extremely easy and excellent.  I scaled it to make 20 servings for a party and it was great.  I used less cilantro and topped with mexican cheese.  I also used store bought tortillas for ease.  Definitely would make again.

This recipe got rave reviews.  I altered it a bit, by using leftover whole chicken, omitting the salsa, and topping it with avocado and Jack cheese.  Yummy.  This ones a keeper.

This was okay, in my opinion. Instead of frying the tortilla strips, I buy plain tortilla chips and throw them in. I had to add more chili powder and omitted the corn (personal preference). It wasn't the best tortilla soup I've had, but it wasn't the worst. I'd make it again with some tweaking.

This was hearty and satisfying.  I just had to add a bit more seasoning for my taste because I like things with a lot of zip.  Overall, I enjoyed it very much and will definitely make it again.

Great recipe. Doesn't take long to cook. I use store-bought tortillas so that makes one less step. I used 1/2 the fresh cilantro, 1/2 the salsa amount the recipe calls for, and more chili powder.
Serve garnished with chopped cilantro, plus either grated cheddar cheese or a TBSP of sour cream.
Adjust spices accordingly for children.

This was really good!  This is the third recipe that I've tried for Chicken Tortilla Soup and they've all been very tasty.  This is the first time that I've included beans and corn and I really liked it.  I didn't fry the tortilla strips this time, but plan to try it next time.  Instead, I offered store-bought tortilla chips, sour cream, and shredded cheese as garnish.  Although I didn't, my husband said he missed the avocado & lime that I added to a previous recipe.  Next time, I'll offer avocado and lime slices as garnish, too.  Either way, this was a great soup!

I loved this soup.  Im always looking for new healthy and tasty recipes.  I had given leftovers to my dad, he took it to work for lunch and let his coworkers try it and they loved it.  They now want me to make  a pot for them.

This one is one of my families favorites I do make a few changes now that I have been making it for so long.  I cook the chicken breast or sometimes boneless skinless thighs, and grab two forks and shred the meat.  I add 1 can of diced tomatoes 1 can of drained and rinced black beans, you can use pinto too, and 1 can of Mexican corn (not Hominy) with one small bottle of your favorite store bought chunky salsa and 2 tablespoon of lemon juice. I double the recipe so the whole thing works for me. After all that melds together nicely. When I go to serve it I put a handfull of tortilla chips at the bottom of the bowl push down slightly to crunch them up a bit and serve on top, garnish with Monterey jack cheese and a dollop of sour cream. It is soo good they'll come back for seconds. Sometimes I'll put the chicken in the slow cooker and when I come home from work I just have to shred it and add all the ingredients. It's my Go To when I'm short on time for dinner.

YUM!  Quick and easy...  I had chicken breasts that had been marinated and cooked previously.  Did not want them to go to waste so made this soup using them.  Doubled all ingredients except the corn and beans.  Spices were perfect!  A dollop of sour cream in the bowl when serving adds a nice flavor!

Very yummy. The only change I made was I added just  a few diced green chilis.  Maybe a 1/4 can.  I topped with sour cream and monterey jack cheese.

I've always been afraid to try tortilla soups because I thought the tortillas would just be a soggy wet mess. I was wrong!  This was delicious!  I added a few tablespoons of lime juice, but fresh lemon juice would probably be excellent as well.  I garnished with a teaspoon of sourcream on top of the crispy tortilla strips. So good and unbelievably easy.

This soup is delicious and the recipe is so easy!  My 12-year-old daughter cooked dinner tonight with very little coaching from me.  We did tweak the recipe ever so slightly.  We doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers.  We didn't have any salsa, so we used half a can of Mexican style stewed tomatoes instead.  We increased the chili powder a bit and also sprinkled cheese on top.  My daughters both loved it and even my macaw had some!  (I know...that sounds sort of cannibalistic...a macaw eating chicken LOL)

This was very good.  I didn't fry tortillas but made my own flour tortilla chips to serve on the side with guacamole.  I sauteed a bit of onion and jalapeno pepper at the very beginning b/c I never cook without some onion. :)  I had 2 cups shredded chicken to begin with so I had to use more broth.  I also subbed Rotel for the salsa and added some cayenne pepper for some more kick.  I also subbed an 11oz. can of corn with green and red peppers.  This soup was very yummy and will be on permanent rotation.

One of my favorites on the site!  I use quite a bit more salsa (I just keep adding until it tastes right... I like mine more tomato-y).  I also use store bought chips.  When I'm not feeling lazy I serve it with cheese quesadillas.  It was the first thing I ever cooked for my boyfriend.  He is not much a soup guy, but he loved this!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've never rated anything on All Recipes, but I thought this recipe deserved my time.  My husband, youngest daughter and I absolutely loved this! Hubby said it reminded him of a soup from the restaurant "Ground Round".  One change that made it thicker and added great flavor was adding a can of pureed white beans (in food processor).  I also put store bought tortilla chips in the pot right at the start and let it simmer until they dissolved into the soup.  We used a spicy salsa, but you can use mild if you like.   Fabulous!!

We really loved this soup. I did it exactly as directed with the exception of following another reviewer's example and using store bought tortilla chips. It was absolutely delicious, quick and simple to make. I think it would be great with ground beef as well. Think I will try that next time.

This was a good soup.  I used low sodium broth and no salt added corn, and it turned out well.  I'm sure it would have had a little better taste with the sodium, but what doesn't lol.  Anyway, all the spices in the recipe make it so you don't need all that salt, so I recommend the low sodium stuff.  It was a hit with my family!  Even my 3yo took a few bites and said it was good-but I think after he tasted the spiciness he wasn't as much of a fan lol.  Oh but I didn't use as much cilantro as it said, I used maybe 1/4 as much and it tasted great to me, I fear if I put all of it in it would have had way too much cilantro taste, but if you like cilantro then go for it!

Awesome soup! I made it easier by using canned chicken, though. I also added chopped tomato and onion, plus a sprinkling of garlic powder. It was seasoned perfectly for me. I didn't even have to go to the store, as I had all ingredients on hand!

This soup is awesome! It's come out really thick with a substantial amount of chicken. It's pretty healthy - I made a few minor alterations - I shredded the chicken, added lime juice, fresh tomato. I reduced the salsa to about 1/4 c and I only added the tortilla strips to garnish.

Foolproof recipe. I've made it many times, with various small changes, such as adding some zucchini (surprisingly good!!!), tostada shells or chips instead of fried tortilla strips, etc. I often use leftover precooked chicken, so it goes really fast. Also works great in the crockpot, just throw everything in and cook on high for a few hours.

I might consider shredding the chicken rather than bite sized pieces.

Added shredded cheese, a dallop of reduced fat sour cream, and some lime juice at the end.  It made a big difference.  I will make this again.

This is a favorite of mine...quick, easy and very tasty. I usually add a can of lima beans to make it a bit healthier and leave out the tortilla chips to reduce the calories. If you like it spicy just use medium or hot salsa.

This soup is amazing! I used leftover turkey, and substituted frozen veggies, but it turned out great. I like my soups a little thicker, so I added some corn starch. The family loved it with a dollop of sour cream and some grated cheese on top.

First time made as is and it was simple, easy and delicious.  Second time I used leftover turkey, added a can of white beans too and it was terrific.  Sour cream or avocado on top was a must. Store bought tortilla strips were used.

It has potential for a great quick meal but falls short on flavor. Made as written. I am sure if I tweaked the spices and simmered some onion and garlic with the them befor adding broth it would have definitely improved it. Maybe I will write my own recipe and share.

Rave reviews at my house! I made a couple of changes...used store bought blue corn chips (added two handfulls in with the veggies), sauted a chopped red onion and red pepper before adding spices (1 tsp oregano and 1.5 tsp cumin and chili powder **note more than doubled). Doubled the broth and boiled 2 frozen chicken breasts in it before shredding and adding back in. Used only 1/4 cup clilantro - freeze dried. Crumbled more chips on top. Would be awesome with cheese and I forgot to add lime juice as other reviewers suggested.

I have to agree with those who said this is missing something.  I used Pam in a pan to fry up the tortillas to save some greasiness.  It was OK, but I expect a tortilla soup to have more umph.  I tried adding more spice but I can only take it so far before it's going to just starting ruining it.  I would prefer on something like this to have the chicken cooked up ahead of time,.

I did add a few things due to personal preference but this is a great recipe just as it is. I would suggest though that if you have frozen chicken, you can just boil it in the broth (don't put in the beans til the end) until it is shreddable, then shred it and proceed. I saw no particular reason to burden myself with the thawing and cubing step. (I actually picked that technique up from a recipe on one of those bagged-soup mixes, and loved it. Another tip I learned from the same bagged-soup mix is to crumble tortillas into your soup early on in the cooking process--it thickens it, but more importantly adds a tortilla flavor to the soup, and you can get away with using less tortilla!) Thanks for the recipe, we enjoyed it :)

This soup was really good.  No leftovers! The amount of spices were good, I added a bit more though (my own preference though). Instead of using raw chicken, I used a pre-cooked rotissere chicken from the market. It worked great and it didn't have to cook that long, just until hot. Will make again. My own recommendation would be to taste the broth to make sure the spices are right, you might not want it tasting too much like plain chicken broth.

This was a great soup for being sick - like others I thought that it needed a little bit more oompf - so I added a diced onion, some garlic and green pepper + a bit more chili powder to really kick up the spice factor. I will definitely make this again.

This turned out better then I thought it would! If you like spicy tortilla soup, you might want to add more chili pepper because this is pretty mild but that just perfect for me!

This was quick and easy, and tasted great!  Make sure to make your own tortilla chips - it's definately worth the few extra minutes!  This is a great healthy recipe as well, and I would definately make it again.

This soup is a great side with enchiladas. I usually double the chicken and use Pace Cilantro salsa instead of the fresh cilantro. This soup is even better the next day, so double the recipe.

Family loved it. I cubed chicken, browned in the pan with oil and onions and garlic.  Added to broth to deglaze.  Toast corn tortilla strips in oven to make crispy. I also added one diced jalapeño for heat.  Delish

As usual, I tweaked the recipe with more spices, cumin ancho garlic and onion. I used tomatoes with peppers, a can of black spicy beans and red kidney beans. Delicious! Adding the tortilla strips to the soup pot was the key to the flavor. One of my favorite soups.

My husband made this with turkey instead of chicken, added 1/4 more of salsa, 1/2 tsp. more of chili powder and 1/4 tsp. more of oregano. He skipped the tortilla chips. It was delicious and very filling. We had it with corn muffins.

At first I didn’t think I would have enough for everyone, but once you add everything it turns out to be a good amount of soup. I did make some modifications. I had some left over chicken from a whole one I had done in the crockpot so I used that, and I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes, as well as some salt and pepper and two cloves of pressed garlic. It really brought it to life.  Served with some sour cream and some shredded cheese. Delicious.

This is my go to for a quick and delicious soup. I use tortilla chips as I saw someone recommend and it is very good and makes it even easier to make. I use frozen corn instead of canned as I hate canned corn. My husband employees love it and I always make extra so they can have leftovers.

I only made 3 changes. I used 48 oz of chicken broth, I used a HALF JAR of salsa (mild for that extra kick!) and I thickened it a bit with cornstarch. Other than that surprisingly this recipe is so very simple and delicious. Perfect for a cold day.

It was great! The only thing  is I added 2 cans of corn, chili beans with chili sauce, large can peeled tomatoes chopped (instead of salsa) , and a few jalepeno chopped. With cilantro (at the end of cooking).

With some little tweaks (saute onions and chicken first with some chili powder and cumin), a pretty good soup. Didn't have flour tortillas so used tortilla chips in the soup when served.

Not as thick as I like, but that was an easy fix( and it is my personal taste). And the taste was great.
It was actually very fast an easy to do.

Great soup for a cold night. I added some Franks hot sauce to up the heat, and since I didn’t have any salsa, I used a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilis. Worked great!!

I added mild, shredded cheddar cheese, and let it melt then served it. Substituted chopped tomatoes with chilis for the salsa. 
Next time I will add more 
I would make it again. 
Next time I would add more chicken broth,  there wasn't enough breath.

Very good recipe! I followed the recipe as written. Making your own tortilla strips is DEFINITELY worth the (very little) time. I'll try some of the other recipes on the site  and come back to this one if I don't find a better one. Next time, though, I will shred the chicken (after cooking) because that will be way better than little chicken cubes.

So easy. Had baked chicken breast to use up. Used tortilla chips for ease, increased broth to 4 cups, chili powder to 1 tsp and no cilantro. I even forgot the salsa but it was still delicious. I will definitely add the salsa next time.

This is a great chicken tortilla soup recipe. The only things I changed was omitting cumin and right before I served it, and added Mexican Cheese. I had made cornbread a few days ago and had some left. It was great together.

if you understand flavor, it'll need 2 Sazon Goya packages, plus 1 Knorr chicken boullion w/tomato. Cumin and chili powder don't do enough.
I followed the recommendation of others and also added one can diced green chilies and chose spicier salsa

Super yummy. I added avocado and a dollop of sour cream to each serving. Today I am going to try the slow cooker and shredding the chicken. Should be yummy. Very hardy meal. To save time buy tortilla strips from the salad dressing isle.

Have made many times, excellent recipe.  I always substitute crushed Tostitos for the tortillas, and most times add a small can of green chilies for flavor.  You can substitute any kind of chicken, one time I used some leftover smoked chicken, delicious.

Husband is on a low sodium diet so I used low sodium chicken broth. The soup was not lacking in flavor and made a healthier version. I will make this again but will top with sliced avocado. Delicious and simple.

This was so good!  After reading all the reviews, I did do some things differently.  First, I shred the chicken.  I did this via stovetop - 1 can broth, onion, carrot and celery in with the chicken breasts.   Bring to a boil for 10 minutes on med-high, then reduce to med-low and simmer for an hour (covered).  I seasoned chicken with salt, pepper, paprika and a bit of turmeric (because I really like it!).  Take out and shred - it was very flavorful!  
For the soup - I diced onion and garlic and sauteed in pot along with a bit of olive oil and the seasonings before adding other ingredients.  Added some diced carrots for a boost of veggies.  A can of petite diced tomato, small can mild green chiles and I also used fire-roasted corn, plus the black beans, chicken, cilantro and salsa.  I used more than the 3 cups of broth (low salt), as I wanted less of a chili-like consistency.  In addition, I added a secret ingredient that I like to add to soups to bring more flavor - a few spoonfuls (2-3) of Better than Boullion!  
Top with tortilla strips, avocado, Mexican cheese, more cilantro and sour cream and it was delicious!

This was super easy and quick! I cooked and cut up the chicken before I even started on the meal so it didn't have to simmer as long, and instead of frying the tortilla, I just used tortilla chips and it tasted great!

I boiled my chicken in Pollo mexican seasoning and water. Added some chopped jalapeno  and some onion and 3 cloves of garlic.  

Used the baby Ninja to chop for me. 

Boil the chicken until done.  Remove from water and wait to cool. Then shred adding back to broth

Added 2 chopped up tomato I had in fridge

1 can of corn
1 can of black beans - both rinsed
1/2 bottle of Pace Picante Salsa
Chopped up approximately 6 or 7 corn torillas and added - gives awesome masa taste. 
Salt and Pepper
Cumin
Serve with fresh cilantro, grated cheese, dollop of sour crema 
and baked oiled corn tortilla strips.  Bake them at 400 until crispy.  

You can use crushed tortillas - but I made mine to cut back on salt.  First time I've made chicken tortilla soup. It was very good!!  I wouldn't hesitate to make this again.

Awesome and super easy as written.  I agree with the suggestions to use store bought tortilla chips (just crunch them up before adding them to the soup.)  This makes it even easier and less messy.  My Salsa was only "medium" in heat, and I like more heat than that so I diced up some pickled jalapenos and added them to the pot. The suggestions of grated cheese or sour cream as a topping before serving sound yummy, I will have to try one or the other next time I make it, which will likely be sooner rather than later.

I had some leftover cream gravy that I threw in.  Doubled the recipe for a group and was complimented heartily.  Am buying ingredients to make enough for 30 people tomorrow.  I will use purchased tortilla chips for this big of a group.

I've made several different types of this particular soup, but this one is one of the easiest.  BUT, it certainly doesn't taste like it.  It fools my family, who are used to me preparing much more elaborate meals for them.

The second time I made this, I increased the cumin (doubled), only because I love the flavor, I added a clove of crushed  garlic, and added cooked rice at the end.  Also, a good quality salsa is essential, I like to use one that has roasted tomatoes in it because it adds extra flavor.   Super quick soup!  A new staple on the monthly fall/winter menu.

This is awesome.  I ran out of cumin but added a little salt and pepper.  I also used four cups broth to make it a little brothier.  Finally, I cheated and bought pre-made tortilla chips.  Super easy to put together!

Huge hit with the whole family!  I also used the leftover can't-do-anything-with the chips at the bottom of the bag for this recipe.  No worries about what kind of beans to use either; pink beans worked just fine. Corn bread on the side is nommy.

This is the first time I've ever attempted a soup.  It was quick, easy, and very tasty.  My husband really enjoyed it, but the surprise was my son ate it!  He doesn't eat any kind of bean, but he ate and liked this soup, black beans and all!  Will be making again soon!

Great recipe! I baked my tortillas, though, and I threw all my ingredients into a crock pot because of time constraints. Turned out delicious! It is a mild recipe, so be sure to add some extra heat if you like a little more kick.

I made this to use up some salsa.  I liked the ingredients but it was just missing something.  I like a little thicker broth so maybe I'd cook the salsa and broth longer or I'd add some sauteed onions.  Good use of salsa, but I just wasn't as pleased as I'd like it to be.  Maybe it'll have more flavor after it's in the fridge overnight.  I followed the recipe to a T, unfortunately I doubled the recipe to use up all the salsa.  Two teenagers in the house will take care of that though.  I'd make it again, but I'll mess with the ingredients next time.

Awesome! Only thing I changed was I used a can of diced tomatoes with chilies instead of salsa since I didn't have any on hand and I didn't fry my own tortillas because I didn't want the extra calories. I used some jalepeno lime chips I had. I also added some frozen green chilies I had. Very good recipe!

I really didn't care for this recipe much.  The only changes I made (based on what was in my cabinet) was replacing dried oregano with basil and chili powder with chili seasoning.  I had tortilla chips in the bag but they didn't enhance the soup much.  I didn't use cilantro either because I don't like cilantro.  I added a bit to one bowl just to see if it would make things better and it didn't.  I forgot to rinse my black beans (but I did drain them) and my soup turned a little muddy looking.  It just felt like it was missing something but I dont know what.

this was awesome soup.   I did replace the chicken with leftover rotisserie chicken and I used frozen corn instead of canned.  Left everything else the same, and it was perfect, so easy and quite filling.  Will definitely make again. Cannot wait to eat leftovers tomorrow.

This was absolutely delicious!  I couldn't believe how easy and yummy it was!  I fried up the tortillas and this to me made all the difference.  (There is a HUGE difference between tortilla chips and frying up tortillas!)  I topped with fresh cilantro, avocado and sour cream!  Super yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I'll be making this again and again!

excellent!  Very easy and very tasty.  I added some crushed tortilla chips to the soup and let them simmer in for the last 15-20 minutes and they added a nice flavor as well as thickened the soup.

Excellent tortilla soup and very quick and easy to make.  Used shredded chicken from a beer can chicken we made the night before.  We had about 12oz of chicken left over so we used a bit more broth (3 14oz cans) and added a bit more chili powder and cumin.  Also used a can of Rotel rather than salsa.  Cut tortilla strips and sprayed w/ cooking spray and baked...still came out crispy w/out the fat and hassle of frying.  Great recipe and takes absolutely no time to make.

I am a firefighter and this recipe was extremely easy and everyone loved it. I cook for 9 people every shift and am always looking for meals that don't take much tim.  I will definitely make this in the future.  I used roasted red pepper salsa and green chilis to give it a bit of spice.  Great recipe.

The only thing I did differently was add a little can of mild green chiles to simmer--and it's fantastic! Thanks so much!

This was excellent! I substituted cayenne pepper for cumin (gave it a nice kick) and added 1/2 tsp. garlic. I used frozen corn and tortilla chips, like some other reviewers suggested. I also added a can of rotel. The only problem with this soup is that there wasn't enough!

This recipe is really good, just like in restaurants. My kids were apprehensive about the black beans and bell pepper from  the salsa, but my husband and I loved it.

I used this as a guideline, and added some cayenne. I used a whole jar of salsa, and it was great! My picky-eater boyfriend loved it, but wanted me to put more chicken in next time. He even ate some of the "veggies" without making a face!

This was yummy,but I did change things up a bit. I used a rotissere chicken (already cooked) and tortilla chips as well as chicken stock instead of broth. (richer flavor) I doubled (at least) the spices and added fresh chopped tomato and chile peppers. Then I topped the soup with pepper jack cheese..It's really tastier the next day. I will make this again...super easy!

This was very tasty but I made some modifications including using an entire small jar of salsa, an additional cup of chicken broth, adding more spices (1 extra tbsp. each of cumin, chili powder and oregano), about a tsp. of chili seasoning and sauteed onion.  I also used bagged tortilla chips.  We loved it and I will make it like this again.

I thought this was a great recipe.  My husband thought he liked our other tortilla soup recipe better.  I think he was looking for more broth and the other is thickened a bit more with tortillas.  I think I could adapt this recipe but I liked the hardiness as is.

This was a huge hit at our house! I didn't put the corn in because we didn't have any, and I used tortilla chips on top. Husband said "fantastic!"

This is a great recipe for tortilla soup fans, better than I've had in a lot of restaurants!  The recipe was really easy, I added some cooked onions as well and crushed red pepper because I didn't have quite enough salsa and it was delicious!

This had an okay flavor, but was a little bland. It was edible, but just okay. The Slow Cooker Taco Soup is much better in my opinion.

Overall, this is a great, quick soup. If your salsa has a lot of kick, then you won't need to add any additional heat to the soup, but if you have a medium/mild salsa like I had on hand, you might want to add a jalapeno or a couple dashes of hot sauce for some more kick.

This was really good, but I did make a few adjustments, which is why I rated it a 4 star instead of 5.  I sauted onion and bell pepper then added rest of ingredients.  Also, I didn't have any salsa so I added a can of rotel. I sometimes add an additional can of petit diced tomatoes.  I usually double the spices to 1 tsp.  I do not fry the corn tortillas...we just use baked tortilla chips and top w/low-fat cheese and sometimes a dollop of light sour cream.  My family loves it.

This is a VERY easy and tasty soup! Pretty basic as far as tortilla soups go, but it is so easy to make that it is worth the little effort for the great result! I didn't fry the tortillas, but used crushed tortilla chips as a garnish instead.

Super easy, great tasting.  I didn't add the cilantro and I used store bought tortilla chips which made making this a breeze.  I added a 1/2 can of refried beans which made the broth a little richer.  Very good recipe.  I will defenitly be making this again.

Delicious!.. I added 1 extra cup broth and a little more spices to strech it further.  A dash of cayenne zipped it up.  We garnished with a dollop of sour cream, shredded cheese and I didn't have cilantro, so I used some fresh parsley.  It would probably be even better with the cilantro!  I saved the tortilla stips for the top.  Yum!

Excellent! And so simple! I baked my tortilla strips in the oven with a bit of oil and salt till crispy. I also, like someone suggested, added a bit of sour cream, fresh lime juice and cheddar cheese at the end. Garnished with avacodo, more sour cream, tortilla strips and lime wedges. This is one my favorite meals! Thank you. (my 2 and 4 year old gobbled it up too!!)

This recipe was excellent.  I made a few adjustments.  I doubled the spices and added 1 tsp cayenne pepper and I added a half can of Campbell's Healthy Request Cream of Chicken soup w/equal amt of water.  I used a combination of black beans, white beans and corn to equal 15 oz.   I used store bought chips....excellent!!! I'd absolutely make it again.
