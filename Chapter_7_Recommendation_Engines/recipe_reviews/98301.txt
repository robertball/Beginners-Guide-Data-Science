I thought this recipe was good, but if I made it again I would make some changes.  The flavors are good.  The filling reminds me of samosas but next time I would add more such as green chiles and peas.  I also microwaved the potatoes instead of boiling because it is easier.  My husband suggested adding sour cream or milk or something more to it to make it a bit saucier because with the tortillas it ends up dry.  It was quick to make and tasty so I have no complaints but it was not great yet.

These wraps were different and delicious!  My sister is a vegetarian so I am always trying to find a good recipe with flavor that I too can enjoy.  I did not have curry paste on hand so I just made a mixture of olive oil, curry powder, onion powder and garlic powder which worked out just fine.  This recipe is a keeper in my book!

Really good and quick to make.  I used American cheese and yogurt instead of Muenster and milk because that's what I had.

This has become one of my favorite easy meals.  I sometimes use evaporated milk instead of the cream.  It's less expensive and has less fat.

This was different and good! I wasn't sure which kind of curry paste to use, so I used green, and that was fine. I did have to add some salt to the potatoes, but other than that, I kept the recipe the same. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've never used chipotle salsa prior to trying this recipe.  I think I would have preferred regular salsa as the strong flavor of the chipotle salsa totally overwhelmed the flavor of the other ingredients, including the curry.

These are absolutely delicious! I've made these numerous times throughout the year and they never cease to please. Tasty, easy to prepare, quick to cook. The kids LOVE them (and so does Mom!) =)

Not bad but kinda bland. I used sour cream instead of cream (increased it quite a bit) plus a combination of crumbled queso fresco and a Mexican cheese blend. Not really sure what I could have done to make it more flavorful - maybe add cumin to the cream mix, or sprinkle on some fresh cilantro. Thanks anyway!

It was way too bland for my taste. Nobody in my house liked it. I had to smother it in salsa so it was edible. The flavors didn't mesh well either.

These were great! I actually added turkey sausage and a little more cream and they were delicious.  We cooked up the leftovers up with scrabled eggs the next morning for breakfast.

It was a strange combination of flavors between the curry and the salsa, but I like where the recipe was going. Might end up tweaking it a bit to get it somewhere I prefer.

I did not care for this at all.  I ended up eating the potatoes and cheese and throwing the rest away.  Sorry it was not for me.

Delicious!  A little fattening, I would cut down on the oil.
