We were a little unsure about pairing cinnamon sugar with eggs, but this actually works. The only thing I think we will do different next time is mix the cinnamon sugar into the rice, making a "cinnamon rice" and then adding the eggs and bacon. Really good for a different breakfast for dinner...thanks for the recipe!

As strange as this might sound or look it's actually quite good.

It was great especially after I added some quinoa and a tablespoon of maple syrup.
