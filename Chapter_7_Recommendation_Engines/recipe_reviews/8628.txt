This recipe is getting rave reviews so it's obviously very popular and delicious to the reviewers, but having lived in Japan for 23 years, I must say this is not an authentic recipe.  A true Japanese yakisoba recipe would never have any chili sauce in it, and it would be finished with matchstick red pickled ginger and Aonori (green flake-type seaweed).  Japanese foods tend to have very subtle favors which probably does not have "enough kick" for the American palate, and as a result, recipes tend to get modified quite extensively.  I mean no offense by this review, just wanted to inform the public.

I used traditional tonkatsu (yakisoba) sauce for this instead of making the sauce from scratch and it was awesome - made by Kikkoman and found at my regular grocery store. I also added fresh grated ginger, minced garlic, and a few dashes of soy sauce instead of a whole 1/2 cup. For extra veggies we threw in bean sprouts and mushrooms. We added a dash of crushed red pepper for a little kick - this was very tasty and cooked nicely in my wok! Try the tonkatsu sauce - it will definitely give you the yakisoba flavor you are looking for!

For having so few ingredients, I thought this was incredibly flavorful. And I didn't even use chile paste because I couldn't find it in the store. I substituted about 2 tsp. of chile powder, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, and a dash of cayenne pepper.  Also used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2. The result was just the perfect amount of spice (warms the mouth but still allows you to taste your food). The soy sauce tasted great on the chicken, veggies, and noodles.  I just added a dash of rice wine vinegar to the veggies as they were finishing cooking. Will definitely make again.

So very, very good!  Taking the others' suggestions I did the following: used Sriracha (Rooster) Sauce in place of the chili paste; doubled the garlic; used 8 chicken tenders instead of breasts (I can see using sliced beef or cubed tofu too!); cut the carrots into matchsticks; to the cabbage mixture I added 1/4 cup chicken broth to help the softening process; after the cabbage mixture was softened I added 1 small can of drained & coarsely chopped bamboo shoots, 1 can of drained bean sprouts, and about 1/2 cup of prepared muchrooms.  A touch of chopped scallions on each serving was the finishing touch!

This yakisoba recipe left out the tonkatsu sauce that is needed for authentic taste. As is, the dish is edible, but nothing at all what I was going for.  All in all, I would say this is not a recipe for the person wanting to taste real japanese yakisoba. I suggest doing a Google search.

This may taste fine for many who never had real yakisoba but this is NOT Japanese yakisoba.  I was born and grew up in Japan and yakisoba is my favorite dish.  Yakisoba is a staple dish at festivals and recreating it at home is actually harder than we think if we don't have the pre-made yakisoba sauce.  I'm not here to deny this recipe, I just want all of my fellow cooks to know the facts about yakisoba since many people are getting familiar with Asian dishes, especially Japanese food and ingredients.  Although we call buckwheat noodles, "soba," for yakisoba, we NEVER, and I mean never, use buckwheat noodles for yakisoba.  What we use is "chu-ka soba."  Most of supermarkets in Asian food section isle has dried "chu-ka soba" packet.  If you live in a community with many Asian descends, you might find a bag in refrigerate Asian section perhaps near tofu or kimchee.  As for sauce, traditionally at festivals, worcestershire sauce and/or chuno- sauce flavor the yakisoba (tonkatsu sauce is for deep fried pork and it's too thick and sweet) but at home, some people uses soy sauce.   So, if anything, please try this recipe with chu-ka soba and then you'll be having "yakisoba"!

I have been wanting to make yakisoba for a loooong time now!  Thanks for this great recipe.  I added some mushrooms, too, just to sneak in a couple more veggies to my family.  The kids loved it, too. OH, and I used chili powder because I didn't have any paste. %)

I tried this recipe.  I replaced the chili paste with chili powder, and added teriyaki to the chicken as it was cooking.  I really enjoyed this recipe, and so did my family. I will use the recipe again.  Thank you!

This is the first yakisoba recipe I have ever tried to make, and it turned out exceptionally well!  It easily compares with the teriyaki restaurant near my home that makes this dish.  Since I could not find "chili paste," I used a "hot chili garlic sauce" by Sun Luck that made the dish a little too spicy when used in the same quantity as the chili paste.  I ran out of soy sauce so I used a little teriyaki sauce in combination with what soy sauce I had left, and it was just fine.  I also added a zucchini and used fresh yakisoba noodles, which did not require any additional cooking and draining.  I wouldn't have eaten this as a kid, so I don't know if it's "kid-friendly," but my husband and I both loved it!

That was FANTASTIC, and I cheated a little. (I used ramen noodles from the packets. (college kid) I love double parenthesis). It probably would have been even better if I could follow the ingredients perfectly, but I was hoping for something simple that didn't involve running to the store, so this was perfect.   I would definitely recommend it to friends.

Recipe wasn't too bad.  It reminded me of Korean japchae.  Pretty tasty, and quick and easy to make.  Didn't follow the directions exactly--just threw stuff in as I went, and it turned out well.  Will make again when I need a quick meal.  Note to chefs: make sure to rinse your soba noodles thoroughly because they are VERY starchy.  Run them under cold water and wash them until the water runs clear.  Otherwise, you may run into the problem of them getting too gooey when cooked.  Also traditionally, yakisoba is not made with the buckwheat soba noodles so don't expect these to taste EXACTLY authentic. Look for chuka noodles (more similar to ramen) for more authenticity.

This may not be authentic Yakisoba, but I honestly don't care. Call it whatever you want, but I call it delicious! We added water chestnuts and baby corn, and subbed in bok choy for regular cabbage (I assumed this was an implied task). My daughter thought it was a bit spicy with the 2 tablespoons of chili paste, but she's just been fussy with spicy food lately. This is definitely on our monthly rotation.

This was a really good recipe.  I used leftover turkey in mine but I plan upon following the recipe exactly for the next shot.  I discovered that the soba noodles need a lot of rinsing for this to work.  You need to wash off all the starch or the noodle will stick together.  There is a good how-to on the website justhungry.

3.5 stars. I liked it, but it didn't really wow me and didn't taste much like the yakisoba you'd find in teriyaki joints, which was what I was expecting this to taste like. I did buy a bottle of tonkatsu sauce instead of making the sauce from scratch, used vegetable oil instead of canola oil, and used mushrooms instead of cabbage (not a fan of it). I'll make the recipe again if I'm feeling in the mood for yakisoba, have the ingredients on hand, and feel too cheap to go out and order the real thing.

I currently live in Japan, and make yakisoba on a regular basis for my wife and friends. Adding a bit of OYSTER SAUCE gives yakisoba a bit of zing. Also, instead of chicken, try shrimp or squid.

Having eaten Yakisoba growing up and in Japanese restaurants, it is still one of my favorite dishes and a “comfort” food. Yakisoba is better than it looks and sounds. “Yaki” refers to “fried” noodles with your choice of meat, seafood and veggies. The sweet, tangy, thickened sauce is what really makes this dish shine! It imbues the noodles with a deep brown color and gives the whole dish a unique caramelized flavor.  Having said all of that, I used Maruchan's fresh yakisoba noodles instead of the soba noodles (buckwheat). I never heard of chili paste or any type of heat used in yakisoba and family doesn’t care for it so I omitted it. In a skillet I added the sesame oil, sautéed Napa cabbage, soybean sprouts, sliced white onions, and carrots until they were mostly tender. Then I added the garlic and noodles, stir fry, then the low-sodium soy sauce (eye-ball) and made sure everything evenly coated. At the end I threw in Kamaboko (Hilo’s Amano Fish Cake) julienne, for flavor, color and texture. Sprinkled green scallions and right before serving I garnished with sharp-flavored benishoga (picked ginger strips). Normally aonori (seaweed flakes) is sprinkled on top as well but I did not have any on hand. While the dish itself had good taste with the vegetables and noodles, it’s not an authentic Yakisoba, missing that key ingredient sauce that this dish is known for. The dish itself was simple and easy to prepare.

I think this recipe was nice, I also think that one should not attempt to make this Yakisoba Chicken if one already knows they will not be happy with it not making it the exact cultural way it originated in Ye Old Japan over 400 years ago... but I am educated now, so thank you.  Anyway, thanks alot for the Almost Yakisoba Chicken.

I thought this was pretty good. I didn't have the hot chili paste so I improvised with hoisen & oyster sauces as well as tabasco soy sauce. I also added mushrooms, very tasty!

I've just gotten into oriental dishes and I've cooked quite a few, but this was by far the best.  My husband loves it and since I found allrecipes I haven't had the same thing twice except for this and one other dish.

Yummy, yummy!! I made this tonight and it was so good! It smelled good as I was making it too! I ommited the cabbage because I didn't have any. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful. I did just add half of the chili paste because it would've been too hot for me. The only thing I was wondering about would be if the chicken needed a little bit of salt or some kind of seasoning. When I was eating the chicken with the noodles it seemed like it was missing something.

this is very yummy - even my picky kids ate it, quick to make too especially since I used coleslaw mix (it's only cabbage and carrots) instead of chopping up all the veggies

The simplicity, intense flavor, and healthiness of this dish has made it a favorite at our house.  We have it almost weekly.  If you don't like things spicy beware, because I regularly partake of spicy, and this one's a doozy if you make it to spec.  And we do.  Awesome!

I'm not from Japan, but I have taste buds and this was very good!  The hubby loved it! 

I took some of the user's tips and added bean sprouts, shataki mushrooms and used bok choy cabbage.  Next time I would up the chili paste by 1 Tbsp (its not very spicy), use fresh mushrooms (not dried) and add 1 more garlic clove.

I made this without the noodles, served it with asian flavored quinoa instead...  I used olive oil because it was all I had on hand, skipped the chile paste and used some red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper instead, I also added broccoli, chopped red bell pepper, and chopped mushroom.  With all that, a definite 5!!!  Even my vegetable picky husband liked it!  Thanks for sharing!

Simple recipe. Easy to make. Pretty healthy. Wonderful taste!  My husband insisted I must now make this at least once a month.

Having lived in Japan for 4 years, I can tell you that this doesn't taste like yakisoba.

Really good. I used udon noodles since that is all I could find. Not authentic Japanese (as a japanese friend of mine said) but I don't know the difference. I have made this twice already and the second time I doubled the sauce.

It was decently tasty, but it's not really yakisoba. It is more like a spicy pasta dish that happens to be made with soba noodles. The end result was pretty good, just not what I expected.

My fiance and I loved this recipe.  Made exactly as written except that I used a bag of coleslaw mix from the produce section instead of chopping a cabbage myself.   Used the stated amount of "Rooster" sauce, thought the heat was perfect.  We both thought that it would be great with more fresh veggies.  Next time I will add water chestnuts and broccoli (maybe pea pods)

We just finished eating this dish and we absolutely loved it!  Our modifications: udon noodles (because we had them on hand), more garlic, a little more sesame oil,the rooster sauce that others have substituted and we added broccoli. So healthy and tasty.  Thank you!

Very Good.  I used 1 T. of the Rooster sauce in place of the chili paste.  I used 1 t. of the sesame oil instead of 1/2t.  I thought it needed a little more.  I used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies because I forgot to buy the cabbage.

Even though this hardly tasted like a real yakisoba in Japan, it was still pretty good.  My friend who was visiting liked it and had a second bowl.  I don't know how to make this taste like the one I know from Japan.  Some suggested Worcester sauce but that didn't help much in recreating the yakisoba flavor from home. 

A note: You will need a large wok or pan to accomodate 1/2 cabbage head suggested in this recipe. I had to give up and reduce the amount of cabbage into a half.

As someone who lives in Japan.  It is true that it is not authentic.  However, having made the recipe, I found that it was equally delicious.  It turns out that authenticity doesn't indicate how tasty a dish can be.  So I would definitely recommend trying it with these new flavors!

My kids enjoyed eating this, but I thought there was way to much soy sauce. Next time I will reduce the amount of soy sauce and increase the amount of vegetables that I use.

This may not have been an authentic Yakisoba (I wouldn't know), but it was really quite good.  I happened to have all of these ingredients in the house and followed the recipe exactly (cut the onions a little thinner than 8ths).    It had just exactly the amount of spice we like.  This one is definitely a keeper for us.

While I did LOVE this recipe, I did make the following changes: 1 T red curry paste, 1 lb chicken breast, 1 carrot, 4 oz soba noodles, PLUS i added a large mushroom, and 1 bell pepper. It was SO amazing! -- But a bit on the spicy side for my taste. Could have been the sub for chile paste, Im not sure, but I couldnt find it at the store. Either way, I will make this again and again!

My kids and husband -- all vegetable-hating individuals-- DEVOURED it and asked for more! I was for sure they would stick up there noses to it because of all the vegis but they didnt!

Thanks for this tasty, and easy recipe! :D

Totally LOVED this!!  Made it for my family which includes one VERY picky 13yr. old and he ate it with gusto!!  I used prepackaged coleslaw mix instead of buying and cutting up a whole cabbage. I used chili powder & crushed red pepper flakes instead of the chili paste.  I also used 1/4 cup soy sauce when cooking the chicken but added 1/4 cup teryaki sauce with the vegetables.   Will definitely make again!!

This was really good!  I’ve never had Yakisoba Noodles before so I can’t comment on how authentic it was, but this tasted like a lighter, spicier, lo mien to me.  I did make a few changes because of what I was trying to get rid of in my fridge plus I figured this recipe was pretty forgiving anyway.  I added celery because I had some that I wanted to use up.  I also added some white wine to the sauce because I had some leftover in the fridge.  I used rice noodles because I didn’t want to go out shopping and I subbed red pepper flakes for chili paste for the same reason.  I tasted the sauce right before serving it, and decided that the salty almost sweet flavor could benefit from some tangy lemon juice (plus I had a half a lemon I wanted to use up).  That was a great addition: it really made the flavors meld and pop.  This was effortless for how tasty it was.

Good, but not quite what I'm used to here in Japan.  I changed it around a bit for my personal taste and added red pepper flakes instead of chili powder and sugar to taste.

Not bad. However, being part Japanese and growing up eating the authentic Japanese food, it is not the traditional authentic recipe. And just a note after reading one of the other reviews, not trying to criticise:  tonkatsu sause is not yakisoba sauce, it is a completely different sauce for a completely different dish, so you will not get the traditional yakisoba flavor, but kudos for trying the tonkatsu sauce! Not many people know what that is at all.

I thought this recipe was very tasty. I look for new things with ingredients not too hard to find. We all do not have time to wander around ethnic shops. So, as to the "not authentic" reviews, well, we are here.  Adapt. Also cabbage is a truly nutritious vegetable which I try to incorporate into different recipes. Thanks for the American version of this.

This was tasty, easy and quick!  My husband loved this recipe,  He is still talking about it (two weeks later).  I only used about half of the amount of chili paste the recipe called for and it was still a bit too spicy for me.  next time I will use even less, so I can enjoy it too.

This was my first try at Asian cooking. The recipe turned out great! I found the chili paste and the yakisoba noodles in the "ethnic" aisle at my regular grocery.  I used a one pound bag of Dole's Classis Cole Slaw for the cabbage and carrots. Quick,easy and delicious.

My family loved it. It was a little spicy for my tastes and will put less chile paste in next time or try some different sauces that others have suggested. But it seems to be a terrific jumping off point for a fabulous recipe.

I did everything to a T. I actually used 3 Tbsp of Chili paste. I'm glad I did, its spiced just right. I only had 2 chicken breasts, next time I will add more chicken. Flavor-wise, I felt like it was missing something, I just cant put a finger on it.

This was a big hit at my house last night. I doubled the sauce for the chicken except for the chile paste, I only used 3T. I added parboiled green beans and pea pods and red peppers and mushrooms...yummy!

I made this with tofu by browning it well first in the oils, then putting all the veggies and then putting in the sauces. i ran out of soy sauce so i put teriyaki sauce and it was delicious! not a heavy sauce, it was just great!

Very tasty and easy to prepare.  Did not have chili paste so I used crushed red pepper.

DELICIOUS!  My husband and I love the yakisoba noodles that we get at a local sushi place and I've been wanting to try it at home.  He said these were eve better!  My 18 month old also loved this dish.  I was surprised at how she kept asking for more even though this was a ver hot dish!  Definitely a new favorite!  Next time I am going to try it with shrimp.

My entire family loved this dinner!  It is easy to make, healthy, and a nice change from the usual dinners we have during the week.  One word of caution: the chile paste is VERY spicy-- in my opinion, 1 tablespoon is plenty!  It adds great flavor, but packs a huge punch!

Just a suggestion, if your not near an asian market or can not find the Soba noodles--Ramen Noodles work well.  If you use the Oriental flavor packet (I use about half) it can cut out the other spices needed.  Experiment with the veggies, celery, onions, carrots, cabbage or bokchoy, snowpeas, your choice (cut thinly or matchstick) but I do suggest nothing spicy.  Even crack a egg or too when stir frying. Good recipe for college students since they can buy precut veggies at the grocery now.  And alot eat the Ramen noodles.

Quite good! I really shouldn't rate this recipe because I used spaghetti noodles instead of soba... but I guess everyone should know that it still made a tasty, though inauthentic, dish!

Didn't use the chili paste - used crushed red peppers instead.  Added tonkatsu sauce, grated ginger, bean sprouts, and mushrooms - just like reviewer littlehemmy wrote.  Also only used half the amount of soy sauce.  My husband LOVES it!

The chili paste makes it way too hot. It should be cut in 1/2.  If I make it again, I would definitely cut the chili paste in 1/2 or omit it altogether...

this is a really great "starter" recipe - you can add any veggies you want, omit anything you want, etc. I didn't have chili paste, but thought it was fine without it. The major change I made was the noodles - my grocery store didn't carry soba noodles, but they did have rice noodles which I found to be very yummy.

A very Western version of a Japanese dish. This dish is so common that it is probably eaten at least once a week by everyone in Japan. A common lunch meal for most schools each week.

This is an awesome recipe, and has become a family favorite!  Instead of chile paste, I use a mild red curry paste, and can't imagine making it without it.  This recipe is quick, healthy, makes great leftovers and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is ok but it's better with a tablespoon or two of sake (or sherry) added with the soy sauce. I used one tablespoon of the chili paste (following other reviewers advice) and it was a nice amount (heat lovers can always add more to their own plate). I also threw in an extra clove of garlic and bean sprouts. If you have pickled ginger I strongly recommend putting it on top just before serving. I also highly recommend pan-frying the noodles a little at the end (add a touch of water if needed to separate them and let water evaporate- I think yakisoba literally means "fried noodles' so it makes sense to include this step).

I thought this was really good. The only thing wrong was that it was a little too salty. I would recommend using a low sodium soy sauce or add something to water down the salt.

I've made it 5 times so I'm qualified to judge; FANTASTIC!!! sauce  oriented, tonkatsu a must but don't deny the other taste buds. Be very creative on the vegies I haven't found one I didn't like. Stay with the chile paste and double the sesame oil. Found a version of udon noodles in an oriental store that are way superior to the ones in a traditional grocer. Remember the golden rule of recipes: always add mushrooms!!!

Incorporate minced ginger during the oil chili phase, add mirin sweet sake(a dash)during the sauté, and sesame seeds sprinkled at the end. Now that makes this dish complete!

This was tonight's dinner and I made it almost exactly as directed except for the soba noodles which I could not find at the grocery store. Instead I used steam fried noodles. I cut back on the meat by 3 breasts since there was only two of us and it turned out really well. Hubby loved it! I'd give it a 5 star but for the saltiness of the soy sauce.  Next time I will use a low sodium soy sauce or maybe just less soy sauce. I am a salt lover and this was way too salty for even my taste buds. Otherwise GREAT! recipe, easy to make and inexpensive to buy. It's on my regular rotation now so thanks for posting! Update: I've since been diagnosed with diabetes so looking for diabetic recipes this one popped up.  40.7 grams of carbohydrates per serving is NOT a diabetic recommended recipe!  Who screens these for categories? Anyone?

I made this recipe because I had half a head of cabbage to use up.  Boy am I glad I found this recipe!  We used shrimp instead of chicken, because we love shrimp, but I can't wait to make it again using chicken! This was very good and had great flavor.  I had never used chili paste before or soba noodles.  I will say that I'll be using both from here on out.  There is just enough for me to take for my lunch tomorrow - and I know I'll be the envy in the lunchroom!

I'm going to  give this recipe a 5, because its a great rounded  recipe to start with. After I read many reviews here, I did a  google search on yakisoba. I came up  with a few ideas to add to this recipe and ideas from some in the reviews here.I kept seeing this exact recipe all over and people seem to really like it.
I used napa cabbage,but next time I will use regular cabbage, its sweeter to taste. I bought chuka soba noodles, which was 3.79 a pkg,(expensive),so next time i will use regular spaghetti or top ramen  and those  would  work and they would be cheaper. I made a yakisoba sauce(I found in my search). I added more garlic,a few sliced mushrooms, ginger and I cut down on chili pasteto 1 T and plenty hot. This is delcious and I will make again. My husband loved it and said it  tasted as good as  you get at a  restaurant. thanks for sharing your recipe.

Made this for my family twice this week.  They loved it that they begged me to make it the 2nd time. It is pretty simple to put together. The main thing I did do is less of the Chili paste and I added fresh grated ginger.  Delicious.

Used left over spaghetti noodles from another dish. Used the 3rd most popular reviewers notes and added lemon juice/vinegar. My husband enjoyed it and so did I. :) Edited: Made same sauce with rice and previously cooked chicken and all frozen veggies (brocc, caul, carrots, corn and green beans) still great - thanks!

I ended up using 3 c. sugar total in a triple batch and that was perfect. (I used 2 1/2 c. in the first batch and that was way too sweet, so I made more batchez to make it better.)

My husband was stationed in Japan for 5 years and loves Yakisoba - after spending way too much at Japanese resturants decided to try my hand at this --couldn't find chile paste so used a little chile powder instead and hot chile oil with the other oils and threw in jar of shitake mushrooms - hubby said I "nailed it".  Permanent in my recipe file

Did everything except the sauce. I mixed a couple tablespoons of soy sauce + a drizzle of rice vinegar + teaspoon of sugar for that perfect salty sweet taste. Great with Sriracha sauce when serving.

Used shrimp and added mushrooms.  Easy, flavorful.  Husband and kids liked it, but seemed a bit too saucy for me.

This tasted great, my family loved it!  I did make some adjustments, I added a teaspoon of brown sugar and some mushrooms.  I also did not have any sesame oil, but used vegetable instead.

Very easy and tasty! I used a tablespoon of rooster sauce instead of paste, low sodium soy sauce, four cloves of garlic and went with shrimp instead of chicken. I also added mushrooms with the veggies and let them cook for just a bit before adding the cabbage so it didn't get too soft.

The soba noodles made the dish VERY gooey. We did not like it. I used "soba sauce" which is what a guy at the Asian market recommended and it just didn't give it the flavor that we are used to. I will try it again with different noodles and the correct sauce.

This is a very good recipe, although I made one major change:   marinated the chicken in a mixture of Mirin, Soy sauce and sesame oil for about 4 hours.  After discarding the marinade, I followed the recipe as indicated and it was fantastic.  We had a Japanese night at my house and everyone enjoyed it.  What little leftovers tasted better still the next day.  I will definitely save this recipe for another time.

I made this recipe, almost the way it describes. I too couldn't find chile paste so I used a little chile pepper. I doubled the garlic, and added a little regular black pepper. (I know it's weird, but I pepper everything). My family really, really enjoyed this dinner. My daughter especially. My husband says it was a little salty so next time I'm going to half the soy sauce and instead try one of the more traditional sauces like the tonkatsu that others mentioned in reviews. Also, I will be adding some mushrooms to the mix but all in all a pretty easy family dinner!

addicting!  not sure if it is or is not traditional but i say "who cares" b/c it is sooo good.  i bought chili sauce instead of paste.  really don't know the difference but mine turned out way spicier than when my friend prepared the same recipe w/ 'thai roasted red pepper paste'.  Didn't spoil the dish but next time i'll ease up on the hotter sauce b/c i am a wuss:-)

This was very good. It is easy and fun to prepare. I used Linguini pasta in place of Soba Noodles and Thai Chili Sauce replaced the Chili Paste. Added Bean Sprouts before serving. I am looking forward to enjoying the leftovers for lunch tomorrow and will be happy to make this again. Thanks for sharing.

I have to be honest... I made lots of changes to this recipe, but it was outstanding!!  I used the ground fresh chili paste with garlic and added an extra teaspoon or so, I added a splash of teriyaki and miran to the soy sauce, and I added many fresh vegetables, including baby corn, sugar peas and water chestnuts.  I also added a 1/4 cup of chicken broth at the end to get more sauce.  I will be making this a lot - my boyfriend couldn't stop eating it, it was addicting!

i didnt think this tasted like yakisoba at all. first of all, chile paste is not japanese. second, it's way too spicy to be a yakisoba. i didn't use cabbage (not a fan), so instead i used frozen chopped spinach (thawed and squeezed of excess water). it was so spicy, but if you're into spicy food, it's good. i didn't have soba noodles on hand, so i used 8 oz. of somen instead, which worked out fine. i only used the first 1/4 cup of soy sauce because it tasted fine, and i didn't think i needed the other 1/4 cup. i would make this again, but reduce the amount of chile paste big time.

Couldn't find soba noodles so used udon instead. I should've just left out the noodles all together and just did the veggies and the chicken w/ some white rice. The flavor was really nice and I don't think it was too spicy at all. I used chili & garlic sauce. Only had an onion for the veggies. It was a bit salty, but I think with more vegs, such as broccoli & cabbage and maybe some zucchini next time, that will help disperse the saltiness better. So overall, really good flavor, but next time will just have it with rice :)

A good dairy-free meal...used sriracha sauce in place of the chile paste and added about a cup of frozen broccoli and 8 oz.  of sliced mushrooms when stir frying the veggies.  It was a little spicy but not overly so.

I found this recipe about 3 yrs ago and have been making it every chance I get since then.   I had to get my sister to get the chili paste for me from an oriental market in our hometown but it was well worth it!  It has great flavor and it's a healthy meal that will fill you up...I LOVE IT!!!!!

I didn't particularly like this dish but I gave it three stars because my hubby enjoyed it. I felt the sauce lacked sufficient flavor to compete with the strong taste of the soba(buckwheat) noodles. Honestly, with a little doctoring, I could probably make this more to my liking; however, I didn't like the base recipe enough to even try it again.

Very good.  Probably not traditional, with the chili paste in it, but that was ok with us.  Definately a 5 star from my husband.  I liked it and will make it again since all 4 in my family liked a lot.  Tiny bit on the dry side.  I used only 1 Tblsp of the paste after reading the reviews and am glad I did.  I also added a little sesame seed on top of the finished dish.  Will make again.

I could only give this 3 stars making the recipe as stated. 2 tablespoons of chilli paste was way too much for me. It wasn't the heat factor that spoiled my first attempt at this dish, it was that all I could taste was chilli. I agree that this is a great base recipe with alot of potential to personalize the sauce mix. I intend to add mirin to the soya sauce and perhaps a teaspoon or two of Japanese cooking wine to the chicken. Other than the chilli overkill, everything else was great.

I made this tonight for the first time. It was very, very good and I made it exactly as the recipe said. I'll maybe use less soy sauce next time, other than that, it was perfect.

Very tasty!  I too used the rooster hot sauce.  I only used 1 tbs. though and I am glad that I did, because it was very spicy to me.  My very picky husband on the other hand thought it was right:)  He even went back for seconds, something that he rarely does. Thanks for sharing:)

Extremely tasty. Even my mother (who doesn't really do spicy food) enjoyed it. I think you could even skip the soba noodles all together if you really wanted to. Tip: If you've pre-soaked your noodles and left them to settle while you cook the rest of the recipe, it would probably be a good a idea to give them a quick rinse (and move them around a bit) just before you place them in the skillet, just so they can separate. I didn't do that, and I wound up with globs or noodles stuck together. Still tasted pretty good, but each noodle didn't get coated with the spicy sauce.

Very good.  Took it to work for a potluck and it got lots of praise.  I used udon noodle since I couldn't find soba noodle.  They worked fine.  Next time I make it, I will add more veggies.  This recipe is a keeper!

This one's a keeper.  I admit that I couldn't follow it to the letter so I used what I had as follows:   about half a pound of good smoked ham for the chicken (cut in julienne), napa cabbage, chili-garlic paste, and linguine for the soba.   I cut the soy down to 1/3 cup since I had salty ham in it already.  I used low salt and can't imagine using regular because it would be super salty then.   It was quick, tasty and full flavored.   My kids enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again.

We loved it! It had great flavor and we loved all the veggies in it. I used the less sodium soy sauce (I recommend this since you do use a lot of soy sauce), and added some green onions. I also used thai red curry paste instead of the chile paste because that's what I had on hand, and I used less than called for because it would be too spicy for me. The first time I tried I added the red curry paste with the oils in the pan, but it burned very quickly. So I threw that out and added the paste in with the chicken and soy sauce, and it worked just fine! Also, make sure to cut the carrots into pretty small pieces because I think mine were a little to large and they didn't quite cook all the way through. You'll enjoy this recipe.

Very easy and very good.  As a previous reviewer noted, using precut cole slaw mix was a time saver.  I cut the recipe in half and one bag was enough.  I also included the seasoning package that came with the refrigerated noodles.  Good for left overs too.

Excelent.  I thorougly enjoyed this meal.  Don't be concerned about the amount of cabbage.  I almost held back some since it filled my wok.  The cabbage looses about half it's mass once it cooks down.

SO GOOD. I could eat this every day. The only change I made was to add some strips of red bell pepper, since I had one to use up. This one is definitely going to be made a lot around here.

Fantastic flavor!  Instead of cabbage, I used broccoli slaw and added in onion and celery.  My husband is a VERY picky eater and went back for seconds.  Left overs make a perfectly healthy lunch alternative!

Made the recipe as written.  It was bland - not much flavor.  It needed something to spice it up.  Made it along side homemade sushi because we had family members who do not eat sushi.

I made this recipe for the first time yesterday, it was excellent.  I do quite a bit of Stir Frying but this was by far the the easiest and the best tasting stir.  Thank you (my husband told me to double the recipe next time, so that he has more to eat)  Myra Shannon

I've made this twice and we loved it! I couldn't find chili paste, so substituted the same amount of Thai style chili sauce. I couldn’t find soba noodles, so substituted the same amount of lo mein noodles. I used “less sodium” soy sauce and cut the amount in half (1/4 cup). I prefer it without the chicken so will make it that way from now on. Thank you for introducing me to new flavors!

As someone who has never tasted an "authentic" version of this dish, this recipe is an absolute homerun!  I've made it with Udon noodles as well as Thai rice sticks, and it is always wonderful.  I see no need to cook the ingredients separately and suggest sauteing the onions, garlic, and carrots in the oil/chili sauce until the onions are translucent.  Then toss in the chicken and soy sauce and cook until the chicken is cooked through.  Finally, I add the noodles and a whole bag of Trader Joe's shredded cabbage and mix it all together just until the cabbage it heated through--about a minute or two.  It's perfect and delicious.  Note: I use Hunan chili sauce (potent!) instead of chili paste so I only use 1 Tbsp.  I still cry, but only a little. :) Update: My feelings remain unchanged, but my husband who is very salt sensitive, can't even eat this dish. :(  Use low sodium soy sauce.  But even then, it might not be tolerable for some.  Oh well, more for me! :)

woah, watch the chili paste ! Our mouths were on fire...I did find chili paste in the Asian Food Market and it is spicy...warning if you find some start with 1/2 tsp rather than 2 tbsp. The dish was soo spicy that our toddler couldn't bare another bite and my husbands and I's noses were running.... I would make it again just using waaaaay less chili sauce !

Very good recipe nice taste. I added zucchini to have some extra veggies and some five spice powder. I couldn't find the noodles so I used whole wheat liguini which worked well. I will definately make this recipe again for my husband. Next time i may add shitake mushrooms and napa cabbage.

I think this is "OK"...a good flavor overall but missing something. I'm not quite sure what though.  2 tbsp chili paste is way too much for the average taste. I used only 1/2 tbsp and it had a little kick but still palatable for kids. I add broccoli when stir frying the onions and carrots for a more complete meal. Overall, my family likes this and I think it's a good recipe..I'll continue to try find ways to tweak it though!

Very good! I used bok choy instead of cabbage, but everything else just as in the recipe. My hubby loved it, but my kids weren't crazy about the soba noodles. Too bad for them, I say! We'll be having this again...thanks for a great recipe!

Used half the chili paste and it was still way to spicy.  The chili paste was all you could taste.

This was very good with chicken, and it was also good when I made it with salmon instead.  Very simple and delicious recipe, thank you.

Our whole family didn't care for this at all as is.  Maybe if you modify it or something it might taste better but wouldn't make this again.

Cooked as directed but added some bamboo shoots and a little stir fry sauce.  This is now one of my favorite meals..and my kids ate it.  Just be easy on the chili sauce if serving to kids.

This just wasn't good....it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.
Very soy saucey, my husband thought it was very basic lacking full flavor.
The noodles were good but it needs somehting else to add to the flavor.

This was good but not great.  I don't know how authentic this is, but it mostly tasted like soy sauce.  I added extra garlic, ginger and sesame oil, but the taste was kinda uniform.  I did like the cabbage though.  It tasted great, so I might use those sauce for the cabbage on its own.

OMG - Is this GOOD!  So, AMAZINGLY good!  Only change I made was to add about 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, just because it seemed to belong there.  Will make again and again!

Very good!! Didn't want to bother with the carrots so left them out. Used half bag of shredded cabbage ... will use more next time.  Had to bring down the heat of the chili paste by adding about 1/4 cup chicken broth. Spicy but very tasty!! Will make again since kids loved it (less heat, though).

I'm not really concerned with food being "authentic" as long as it tastes good, so this gets 5 stars.  I used less chile paste just for my preference and this was delicious.  
Our largest, most expensive grocery store carries soba noodles, but it's cheaper to get them at an Oriental food store or a natural food store...even if they're as expensive as at the regular grocery store, they tend to be better quality (more buckwheat, less wheat).  I think you can also order them on-line if you live in a small town without natural or specialty stores.

My husband and I lived in Japan for 2 years and we LOVE yakisoba. Although this didn't taste exactly how we remember it, it was YUMMY!!!! I did change things a little. I couldn't find soba noodles, so I used bean threads. I didn't have chile paste, so I used thai sweet chile sauce. I also added a can of bean sprouts (drained). I boiled my chicken first and deboned it, then I doubled the recipe. We only had 1 bowl left over. With my family of 5, we gobbled this up! Even my children had second helpings! A Definite keeper!

I prepared this dish exactly as the recipe states and thought it quite good.  I will make it again, adding more vegetables as that is my personal preference, and if that makes it less "authentic," so be it.

Very good and easy. I too added additional vegetables and bean sprouts. I used reduced sodium soy sauce. I used less than was called for in the recipe because it's easier to add it at the table than to have too salty a taste in the finished dish. I tend to follow the cooking commandment 'Taste as you go', it usually works out in the end.

I would have rated this recipe 3 stars but I didn't follow the recipe completely so I don't want to effect it's score. So here's what not to do - I used chili oil instead of chili paste because that's what I had on hand and for fear of making it too spicy I only used a quarter teaspoon. Without the spice it's pretty bland yet salty. I will make this again but will add more garlic and sesame oil and include other seasonings like ginger and rice vinegar.

This was wonderful. I was concerned that it might be too spicy because of the reviews so I went light on the chili sauce a touch. Will not change a thing next time. All 3 (12,10,6) kids liked it. Will make again with out a doubt. THANK YOU MAXWELL

Made this last night for dinner.  Even better today.  After reading others' reviews, I made the following changes:  Used 1 Tb. chile paste (will use the whole 2 the next time---not spicy at all with the 1), 2 lbs ground chicken breast, 1/4 cup lite and 1/4 cup regular soy sauce,(will probably use all regular next time---not salty enough for my taste), 10 oz. pkg of angel hair coleslaw, 1/2 of 10 oz. bag of matchstix carrots, about 9 sliced cremini mushrooms, 1 can diced water chestnuts (drained and rinsed), 1 can bean sprouts (drained and rinsed) and a 10 oz. pkg of dry udon noodles.

My husband and I enjoyed this meal, but the 2 T chili paste was a bit much for me.  (He thought it was great!)  I drained the sauce off the chicken before I added it to the vegetable mixture.  It was tolerable then, but I think I would have enjoyed it better if I'd only used half the chili paste.  Otherwise, yummy!

This recipe was okay.  I didn't have soba noodles, so I used whole wheat spaghetti.  I like soy sauce, but this was just too salty for my liking.  I would have added more cabbage, and maybe some snow peas or other vegetables to give this dish some color.  (It just looks bland!) I might make it again, but I would doctor it up.

This didn't taste too much like the yakisoba we have in the local teriyaki joints but it was still really good. A nice change from ordinary dinner. My husband made this one for us and he followed the recipe exactly except we couldn't find any straight chili paste so we went with Thai Red Curry Paste. The heat was just right for the grownups with 2 tsp but only one of our kids could eat it so kids may not appreciate how hot it is. Two things I would change next time we make it - add more cabbage and add some kind of green vegetable, like broccoli or zucchini. All in all a tasty little dish!

my husband was stationed in japan for 5 years with the marine corps. he loves japaneese food and is very particular about it. when i made this for him, he said it tasted just like it does in japan with the exception of the chili paste. he still really liked it and i thought it was absolutely delicious. i will definitely make this again!

This was really good.  I live in Japan and I actually like this better than some of the yakisoba sauces I have tried from the local grocery stores.  I did cut down on the cabbage, even with the shrinkage there was still a bit too much for my liking.  I couldn't find chili paste, so I used sweet chili sauce and it worked fine.

This is wonderfully simple dish with great tastes and spiciness. I would cut way back on the cabbage, though. A half a head came out to over 4 cups and about half would do. The soba noodles have a great meatiness to them that added to the dish. My whole family was impressed!

Do note that if using gochujang as your chili paste, use half as much as called for unless you have already achieved spiritual enlightenment, as the spice level permanently closed my third eye. Nonetheless a wonderful meal.

This was my first time cooking with soba noodles (which was remarkably easy, by the way) and it turned out well. My boyfriend really loved the dish and had seconds. I enjoyed it as well: It definitely tasted as if we had ordered delivery from our favorite Japanese restaurant. The sauce basically just tastes like soy but with some subtle head added from the chili paste. This makes a ton for just two people, and we will have plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

A few alterations/notes:
-I really love sesame oil, and used a full teaspoon. Still couldn't taste it. I'd consider using more next time.
-I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. The thighs are much more tender.
-Substituted olive oil for canola oil, and also used some extra oil when stir frying the veggies.
-I stir fried the veggies for about double the recommended time: 6ish minutes. This was necessary as the carrots I used were massive. I probably could've even cooked them a little longer. i also added in the remaining soy sauce a bit early, when frying, rather than adding in after I was finished with the cooking.

Delicious! We added half a red pepper, snap peas, a little fresh ginger, and some red pepper flakes. Loved the spice!

Easy to cook and very tasty. Added a bit of Japanese chilli powder as didn't have paste.  Used seaweed and wasabi pepper at the end.

Made this last night for my picky-eater husband...he had seconds!  I through in some bok choy, broccoli, mushrooms, and it was yummy.  It will go into the dinner rotation.

I know a lot of people are complaining that it's lacking the tonkatsu sauce. Well, my mother just found out she was diabetic and it's really hard for her to adjust. I was compiling recipes that she could make as a diabetic and stumbled across this one which was listed under diabetic recipes. The thing about tonkatsu is that it contains quite a bit of ketchup and sometimes fruit juice that wouldn't be good for a diabetic. So, I feel that that may be the reason it was left out of the recipe. Just a thought. Otherwise, I think it's great.

Having lived in Japan for seven years I can state that most traditional dishes do not have the kick that Americans usually want for their taste pallets. With at said this recipe is quite similar to what you would expect in the true sencse of originality.

We were disappointed with this recipe. It was spicy hot, but not very flavorful otherwise--pretty bland. I used the dried chuka soba noodles other reviewers recommended--8 oz makes A LOT of noodles! I followed the recipe pretty closely except added some mushrooms and bean sprouts. Used my largest skillet, which is pretty big, but it wasn't large enough to hold all the noodles, chicken, and veggies. If I were to make again, which I probably won't, would definitely use less noodles and try the tonkatsu sauce others have suggested.

This was a pretty good recipe. It is not quite an authentic Japanese recipe though, but if I really needed to make a authentic version I would have used one of my Asian cookbooks. I figured I give this a try and I'm glad that I did since my kids really enjoyed it. The only things I did differently was to julienne the carrots instead of coarsely chopping them and to slice the chicken breast instead of cubing.

Good flavor. I found it to be a little too salty. Still edible, but it would have been more pleasant with less. Next time I make this, I will use reduced sodium soy sauce. Also, this tastes better with a drizzle of lemon or lime juice.

This came out really good...  I was lazy and used a bag of coleslaw mix for the cabbage and carrots and I couldn't find Yaki soba noodles so I used udon noodles.. I served it with rice on the side to cut any spiciness - I make a pot of rice for everything though. Overall the fam really liked it. Even my 81 year old grandma who rarely ventures into the realm of food from a foreign land....

I halved the recipe. I used tofu and frozen Japanese veggie mix*. Did not have onion so used freeze-dried chives. Added 3 slices fresh ginger.

I didn't read the instruction first, and mixed all ingredients (except tofu & veggies) together and then marinated cubed tofu in sauce while noodles cooked. I used a fresh peanut/sesame oil blend to saute some more chili paste and garlic before cooking tofu. Topped with minced ginger and Japanese chili mix sprinkles. 

Maybe not authentic Japanese, but still delicious! 


*Japanese Veg Mix -  snow peas, carrots, peppers, broccoli, water chestnut

Very good, very easy recipe. I didn't have soba noodles so I just substituted regular spaghetti noodles. Also need to use lo-sodium soy sauce so it doesn't taste too salty. I added about 1 tsp (made a double recipe for a bigger family) of freshly grated ginger to the veggies. One lesson I learned... vegetables cook quick, so make sure your pasta is ready. My cabbage lost most of the crunch because my pasta wasn't done in time. I will definitely make this again. Next time, I'll try to find real Soba noodles.

Very nice flavor and easy to prepare, but even using low-sodium soy sauce it was very salty for our taste (I have do watch my husband's sodium intake due to health problems). I omitted the chile paste since I couldn't find at the grocery store and I used whole wheat thin spaghetti.

This chicken stir-fry dish was quite good!  I replaced the onion with scallions and added snow peas just because I had them.  Love the crunch of the bok choy in the dish.  Next time, I'll add water chestnuts and sprouts too, just for an added kick.  Very tasty!

I've never had Yakisoba Chicken before, so I have no idea if this is authentic or not. All I know is that I made this as written, and found it pretty bland and sour. I ended up adding a little sesame oil, some ground ginger, and a pinch of white sugar. Oh, and it was only when I went to get the noodles from out of the fridge that I discovered that I'd bought the Udon variety. Oh well. All in all, it turned out super tasty. Next time, I'll up the amount of onion. Thanks!

Have no idea what I did wrong but I didn't not like this at all.  DH ended up really liking it after I put several teaspoons of curry and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes in.  Hence the 3 stars.  Sorry

My son is all into learning Japanese. I surprised him for his 20th birthday with this dish. He has eaten Yakisoba before and LOVED this dish.. Followed directions completely. So simple and delish

I really enjoyed the cabbage and soba noodles in this recipe. And, it had a lot of chicken which was excellent. I highly recommend it. Just make sure you really do use a large skillet, at the end it gets pretty full.

Great basic recipe. I used pork instead of chicken, regular spaghetti instead of the noodles called for, a splash of fish sauce, and lots of Korean red chili paste (probably 3 Tbs). I threw in a very large minced jalapeno, a few splashes of white wine, and a couple tsp. of fresh minced ginger because we LIKE spicy! I would have given this 5 stars but the half cup of soy sauce is just WaYyyyy too much. Cut the soy in half (at least) and it's a winner!

This was delicious!  The only thing I changed was cutting the soy sauce in half and using mirin to make up the difference.  I just couldn't see using all that soy sauce - it's so salty!  It turned out fantastic.

I just got up from the dinner table. I made this recipe as stated except I used sarachi Thai chili instead of chili paste (didn't have any) Next time I will cut the chicken chunks way smaller than 1 inch, add a whole bag of cabbage (way more convenient), cut the chilie paste to 1 tablespoon (it was really spicy) and add all the noodles (1 package) and double the sauce. It was tastey, just spicy. I will make again with adjustments. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I was stationed over in Hawaii for four years and spicy yakisoba was my favorite dish in the mom and pop shops over there.  This is pretty close to the real thing...not quite "authentic," but still very good.  I used SriRacha Hot Chili sauce and it is relatively easy to find in the grocery store (clear bottle, green top, with a rooster on the front)  I like spicy food and for me this was just about right, but would probably cut back to 1 1/2 tablespoons next time.  I also like salty foods, but this was a little too salty for me (not trying to nitpick)...so I will cut the soy sauce back to a little over a 1/3 of a cup, but that is all personal preference.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good and I will make it again. I cut back on the chili paste by 1/2 tablespoon fearing that it might be too hot for my taste (as others have stated). I thought the spice level was perfect using that measurement. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. I think I might have had too much cabbage and not enough chicken. I will adjust the next time.

Looked for chile paste in supermarket and only saw Thai chili paste that I was afraid might be too hot.  So I used chile powder & red pepper flakes which probably added a completely different flavor, but worked.  DH was not thrilled with the way it looked, but after his third helping suggested we might have it again.  I will go to the Japanese grocery and get the right chili paste for my next try.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This is a great base recipe that can be filled out with whatever you're in the mood for or whatever's in your pantry. I was timid with the chili sauce and will try adding more next time. Great flavour and quite easy. Husband loved it. I don't think the original author intended it to be a faithful, authentic representation of Japanese cuisine -- just a yummy dinner inspired by yakisoba, which it certainly is. Will make it again.

Oh my gosh this was good!  I made this exactly as written, including the chile paste (Sambal Oelek).  We like spicy food, but this was a little too spicy hot.  Next time I'll cut the chile paste down to about 1.5 Tbs.  Excellent flavor!

Really was looking forward to making this dish. However, could not find the soba noodles in the 2 grocery stores I visited. So I subed in some udon noodles. I found the 2 tsp. of chili paste way too hot for my palate. Perhaps others may like it this hot. Also found heating the oils and the chili paste created quite a splatter.

Yum.  Used sweet chilli sauce instead of chilli paste as that was all I had.  Added capsicum ( sweet red pepper I think you call it) and bean shoots.  I shall definitely make this again

this was a very tasty dish.  i made the dish with the original recipe of sauces.  i really like the chilli paste favor.  i will have to make it spicier next time.  i did add extra garlic and both bean sprouts and mushrooms.  next time i think i will make it with bamboo shoots and baby corn as well, just to try it out (i really don't think you could limit all the different veggies that would work in this, peas, water chestnuts etc.).  oh, and i also used pulled rotisserie chicken from a local store...so good.

This was yummy!  Couldn't find chili paste so we used 1 heaping teaspoon of chili powder.  It was hardly spicey (which I like) so if you want that kick use more.  Also used low sodium soy sauce and it was still on the salty side, but still very good.  Will make this one again!

My husband liked this dish a lot, but I thought that it was a bit too salty with all the soy sauce.  The chicken came out wonderfully tender, but next time I would cut back on the cabbage and maybe exchange the carrots for another vegetable.  I couldn't find chili paste, so I used Thai chili sauce, which was very good with it.  I think the sauce needs something though to cut back on the overpowering soy sauce flavor..maybe rice wine or sugar?

This was good, but I did make the following changes:  Added 3 cloves of garlic, and a similar amount of fresh ginger.  Cut the cabbage wayyyy down.  I used about 2 cups and added some baby corn, sliced red pepper, mushrooms and sugar snap peas.  I also cut down the soy sauce and added a little hoisin and oyster sauce.  I found soba noodles and thought they were quite good.  Topped with bean sprouts, this was a healthy, low fat meal that my hubby and I both enjoyed.  Will make again.

This was hot! I pretty much followed the directions, adding a few more veggies and then tasted this and nearly spat fire. I rinsed of the noodles to get rid of some of the chili paste and it was much better. Be careful when using the chili paste. I thought it looked like a lot and for me it was too much. I ended up adding even more veggies at the end.. some more sauted cabbage and zucchini. This is great to take to work for lunch.

This is a delicious recipe!  I used 1/2 tbl of chili garlic sauce instead of chili paste which was just right for the kids enjoyment as well as the adults.  I also used ground pork instead of chicken which allowed the sauce the soak into the meat...yummy!

Good shtuff. Would add a photo but I don't have a good camera.

Alterations:

For the chili paste I had to improvise.

Homemade Chili Paste Substitute:
- 1 cup Ketchup
- 2 tsp Crushed Red Pepper
- Combined both in side container

I made this for the first time tonight and it was delicious!  I am sure I've never had authentic Yakisoba, but all I can say is that this was tasty.  I added a chopped red bell pepper and a few chopped mushrooms to the veggies and actually broke out the wok to cook it!  My husband and I like things pretty spicy, and topped off our servings with a couple squirts of sriracha, a dash more soy sauce and a couple drops of sesame oil.  I will definitely be making this again!

Pretty good and straightforward to make. But it's a little salty. I'd cut back on the soy sauce a bit.

I liked it.  Overall, it has some pretty good flavor.  It's a pretty easy recipe to make.  I tried it with shrimp.  I would make it again.

Made this straight by the recipe except that I didn't use any chicken. It was a vegetable yakisoba and it was delicious. We'll definitely be using this again.

Made it and it was good, but will adjust the heat next time. 2-Tbs Chili Paste was a bit hot for me, but if you like the heat, by all means go for it.

I have made this recipe twice and both times it was incredible! The first time I made it with the soba noodles but the second time I went to make it the Asian market no longer carried them. They suggested something called “Baily Canton Dry Noodles”. I was reluctant to try it but I’m glad I did. It was just as good as the soba noodle version. It is a bit spicy but I like it that way. If you or your family doesn’t like things with a little kick, I would cut the chili paste in half.

It was very tasty and a bit different.  Not your same ole weekly meal plan.  Simple to do and very subject to modification.  Use what ever veggies you have on hand and like.

My store was out of soba noodles, so I used rice noodes. It was delicious! When I removed the chicken from the pan, I used a slotted spoon and cooked the veggies in the leftover oil/garlic/chili paste sauce. Not sure if that's what was expected, but it turned out great!

I only used 3 teaspoons of the Chile paste ( maybe I used the wrong paste) and it was a little too spicy for my 6yr old. However, the rest of us loved it!!!! I will make it again.

Flavor  is so good. I’d forgotten what a mess soba noodles can be and ended up with a glop of noodles. My fault but next time I’m trying this with rice noodles. Not as authentically Japanese but easier for me to work with.

This turned out very good! Thanks! I adjusted the servings to 3, all except for the sauce (used the 6 serving) And I used avocado oil instead of canola and it was fine. Oh, and I used 2 chicken breasts. My husband really liked it as well

WAY too salty, even though I used only half of the soy sauce called for. I had to sprinkle sugar on it to make it edible. Won't be making this one again.

Wonderful. I had 3 separate people with different likes. It was a hit for them & the two of us. I was he amazed. My partner labeled it restaurant quality. Variations are possible, if desired. But certainly not necessary. Thanks for sharing.

I’ve never made a recipe with soba noodles and this recipe was great! I kept the noodles and the chicken mixture separate until serving and that worked great. I served it to my adult children and they loved it. It was very tasty and easy to make!

I had to replace the chili paste with sriracha sauce because I didn't have any chili paste .But it still tasted amazing! It a smooth texture and the soy sauce made the chicken flavorful. When I Mixed the chicken with the rest of the ingredients the soy sauce spread out giving a balance taste throughout the entire meal. It is easily one of the best meals I have ever made and my family agrees too.

This was really good.  Don't know what it was supposed to taste like since we'd never had it before, but it was a huge success with the family.  We have added it to our meal list and will be having it often I'm sure.

Excellent dish! I didn't have chile paste and substituted with sriricha sauce and red pepper flakes.

We ended up getting a chilli paste that was way too spicy, but the flavors were very good. Next time we'll cut down the amount of chilli paste (we had already cut it in half due to the kids) and probably double up the other ingredients for the sauce

This recipe is good! Nicely spicy and easy to make. I didn't like the cabbage to noodle ratio, though. I followed the recipe to the letter, and mine didn't look at all like it's pictured. It was all cabbage. Next time, I'm going to double the noodles and use a quarter head of cabbage. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!

I substituted pork tenderloin with the chicken, since I had it already on hand. My picky eaters, ages 13 and 15 LOVED it.  I pulled back on the hot pepper paste as well but could have added a bit more and still have the kids love it. There was left overs, which were found by my 13 boy before bed...no left overs for my lunch after all!

This was really good. I reduced the amount of chili paste, because it seemed like a lot of spice to us. If you love spicy, go for it. If you like a mild kick, halve it. Otherwise, the recipe is great! Thanks!

If i could i would give this 4.5 stars. Very good recipe. Versatile and you can throw in whatever veg you prefer. I think i would like a tiny bit of sweet to balance the spice - next time i will sub part of the soy sauce with teriyaki. Plenty of heat and for- sure use low sodium soy sauce. Great recipe overall. Will definitely make again

My first attempt at making Yakisoba Chicken was a success!

I followed the recipe exactly this time around and the end result was delicious. The recipe was easy to follow and the prep, cook and ready times given were pretty spot on. 

There are few changes that I will make the next time I make this recipe and they are as follows:

1. I will cut the chicken into much smaller and thinner strips. This will allow a better distribution of chicken throughout the dish and will also mean that you won't hit large bits of chicken that require lots of chewing. 

2. I will cut the cabbage into much smaller and thinner strips for the same reason as the chicken. 

3. I will roughly GRATE the carrot next time, rather than coarsely chop it for the same reason as the chicken and the cabbage. 

4. By following the directions I ended up with about 8-10 portions (depending on appetite size). This was great for company, but would leave a lot of leftovers for just two of us. When making it just for two I would have the recipe so that we have a couple of serves of leftovers but not enough that we get tired of it after a few days.

Used whole wheat linguini for pasta and lowered the amount of chili paste to 2 teaspoons, because I just can't take the heat any more. Otherwise, stuck to the recipe. I will definitely make again.

Really good!  Not a fan of buckwheat noodles, so I used Chinese Miki noodles (egg noodles).  I also added pea pods at the end for a fresh finish.

 Recipe ingredients list missing carrots, but mentions them in the cooking instructions.  I julienned about 3/4 cup.  

Its a little spicy (as my daughter pointed out), so if you don't like spice, reduce the chili paste to 1 tablespoon maybe?

Also, I used 16oz of noodles and I used chicken thighs instead of breasts because that's what I had in the freezer - delicious!

delicious- one thing careful with the chili paste- that stuff can be really spicy - first time I made this people loved it but were literally crying and laughing from spiciness.  I made it a few more times we came to love the spice but I tried to turn it down a little :)

Amazing!  I think next time, I'll get a pre-cut mix of the cabbage, carrots, and onions.  Chopping the veggies was the most time-intensive part of this recipe, and it didn't even really take that long!  A keeper, for sure.

After visiting this little cafe in Washington while one a road trip my daughter and I fell in love with Yakidoba! The only changes I made it o this recipe is bought a bag of pre shredded cabbage aka coleslaw mix. I am a busy Mom to 3 kids so anytime I can save time I try too. I also add a few chopped pieces of left over bacon because the Yakisoba we had at Sweet Phee's had bacon and we love bacon.

Very good! My cooking times for the chicken and the vegetables were a little longer than the recipe called for, and next time I think I might reduce the chili paste (hot hot hot!) and add a little more variety to the veggies.

I had chili garlic sauce not paste so we used that a little on the hot side but that's how the hubby likes it! Baught the prepackaged cabbage and carrot mix super easy! I also need to reduce my sodium so we used low sodium soy sauce and I cut out 1/8 of a cup next time will try reducing it to 1/4 cup over all!

Very good. Cut soy sauce and did half chilli paste half sweet chilli sauce (so it wasn't too hot for the kids). Whole family liked it. (added mushrooms and broccoii b/c i had them and needed to use them up).  I put Sriracha in mine to spice it up again

Used shrimp instead of chicken and udon noodles instead of soba (just didn't have any!). Also added some green beans and broccoli but followed the recipe otherwise. Not bad! Though I was hoping for a slight bit more sweetness like some of the yakisoba I've had in restaurants. Next time I'm going to add a bit of ketchup for that touch of sweetness. Overall though a great simple recipe!

I used ramen noodles without the seasoning packet (i'm cheap), and added broccoli and mushrooms. I did a mix of worchestire sauce and soy sauce and a couple squirts of ketchup (thought the kids might like it better) and only 1/4 tsp chile paste (didn't want it to be too hot for the kids). To my surprise 2 out of 3 kids ate it without complaints!

this was alright the night i made it....somewhat bland i suppose....someone mentioned a yakisoba sauce that might elevate the flavor better....it was way better the next morning when i ate the left overs for breakfast lol....we added some broccoli and didnt measure out the soy sauce since some people said the 1/2c was too much i just added it here and there what ithought was needed....i used regular spaghetti noodles...it was really great next morning is all i really have to say

My family really liked this but I was looking for a more unique taste. I felt the soy sauce overpowered. This was easy and relatively healthy (except for the sodium). I will likely make again as my family liked it a lot and it's easy.

I had to make a few changes when preparing this, based on what I had available.  I used 1 tsp of chili powder (for a half recipe, would use 2 tsp when making all servings) in place of chile paste.  I omitted the onion and did not have any cabbage so I added some extra carrot and also threw in some green beans.  The beans were good but I would like to try the cabbage next time.  I doubled the garlic because we like it.  This was a fast tasty recipe that I will make again sometime.

Great and quick recipe.  Very versatile - could easily use pork, chicken, steak, shrimp. Many reviewers indicate this was too spicy and many others said it was too bland.  My husband likes very spicy meals, me - not so much.  Even I thought this needed more chile paste and we added some at the table.  This is definitely a keeper.

This was very good, although a little spicy for me (my husband thought it was perfect).  Next time I think I might put 3/4 of the recommended amount in.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I forgot to bring my cabbage in from the car and it froze, but it was ok anyway!  This dish was good, however, my boyfriend liked it more than I did.  I particularly liked the way the chicken was cooked, and I want to try it with other vegetables.  Like I said, it was really good...but it was fantastic the next day!

We love this recipe! The soba noodles are key I think. My husband who usually doesn't like asian flavored meals, thinks this is delish. I follow the recipe exactly and have made this several times now, I add more cabbage now as I think it is filling without adding calories.

i used some leftover green thai chile paste i made w/ ginger, garlic, scallions, cilantro, lime zest and juice, ground coriander,and turmeric. i also had some leftover shredded chicken to use so i just sauteed the veggies in some white wine until tender crisp, added the sauce mixture and chicken, heated it up, then added a liitle flour to thicken it. it turned out great. i didnt know what to do with my leftover cabbage and i will probably make something like this again.

Yikes, this is hot!! I don't know how anyone would handle 2 Tbsp. Otherwise, very yummy. I will make it again! And I am going to scale down the soy sauce. There is lots of room for experimenting with ingredients.

OMG! this was my first attempt at making Yakisoba anything. It was fantastic. I used Sambal Oelek, ground chili paste made by Huy Fong Foods as recommended by Tim's Oriental Market. Clear bottle, green top and rooster on label. I used packaged cole slaw mix, chicken tenders, fresh mushrooms, bean sprouts and snow peas which meant to double the sauce. Ramen noodles are a staple in my kitchen so I used them up instead of buying soba. Hubby gobbled it up and wants to me make it at least once a month. Next time I will use shrimp. Thanks for a keeper.

I brought this to a potluck but the noodles ended up being too mushy. For a dinner item it's great when eaten right away, but don't let it sit too long.

I have made this several times, always differently, and always turning out pretty good.  I've made it according to the recipe, with kikkoman tonkatsu sauce and with yoshida's original sauce.  I have to say we preferred it with yoshida's the most.

We LOVED this recipe.  It was great but we had to use ramen noodles (minus the seasoning) because we can't find an asian market near us.  We might try it with cowmein noodles next.  Still great though.

This recipe is great! So what if it isn't true "yakisoba," it is a delight to my taste buds! I make this a few times a month for my family as it is quick and easy! I throw in whatever veggies I have on hand, which are most often leeks, snow peas, carrots, and onions. As of late, I have been adding in some La Choy Teriyaki Sauce and some La Choy Garlic Ginger Sauce. This recipe is also great without any changes, however.

I like it spicy. I find that chopping a jalepeno finely and adding it to the dish gives it that extra flavor I like.

Delicious-- not traditional Japanese, but I found a similar recipe that mentioned that this was an adaptation of a Yakisoba-style noodle dish from the Philippines, so maybe it's not TOO far off. As for the flavor itself, though, I was very impressed. DEFINITELY cut the paste to 1/2 to 1 tbl spoon, and if you can find the chili paste that is a combo chili/garlic paste (same company with the green top, typically found at Asian food stores and sometimes even major grocery stores like Safeway) it's even more delicious. Besides the addition of the chili/garlic, the only other change I made was a few splashes of Mirin (Japanese cooking wine) throughout the stir-frying process. I like the way the Mirin balanced with the soy and spice, so you may want to try that if you have some on hand. Either way, though, a very delicious and well rounded recipe.

I thought it was pretty good, not your ordinary chicken dinner. I did not find the chili paste so I had to use red pepper flakes and some of chili garlic sauce. I also cooked the veggies longer than was recommended for them to get softer. As I said I thought it was good but I will not be making this again. There are similar Asian recipes that are better.

I taught an after-school enrichment class for middle schoolers and they all loved this recipe!  I was surprised because I thought it might be too spicy for them.  Only issue I had was that I couldn't find the chile paste at my local grocery store.

really tasty, I'm gluten free (allergy) so I had to use soy sauce w/o wheat and I couldn't find the buckwheat noodles so I had buy these rice noodles from an Asian market that worked fine. Those dining with me enjoyed them as well. SPICY :)

This is very good - 5 stars with the modifications I made to suit our tastes. I omitted the canola oil and just used sesame oil. Double the garlic and saute chicken with only a tablespoon or two of soy sauce. A little fresh ginger is nice too - just don't over do it. Then at the end add additional soy sauce to taste. I was afraid this would get too salty very easily. I used quite a bit more cabbage, carrots and onions than called for, added red bell pepper. Then I used rice noodles (the kinda you use for pad thai noodles) just because it was what i had on hand. Really any noodle would do the trick if you don't care about being super authentic. I'll make this again. I love stir fry recipes that have lots of veggies in it - especially the cabbage!

Wow, this was a great recipe. Instead of using the soy sauce (which I love) I had to use teriyaki sauce because of my husband. I also didn't even include the chili paste (which I couldn't find at the store) and didn't use anything as a substitute. This was a great and easy meal which I will be adding to my regular rotations. Next time I'm going to add some fresh mushrooms, I think that would taste WONDERFUL!  It wasn't bland at all even without the chili paste or powder...etc.

I thought this would have a little more flavor. I had cut down to 1 1/2 teaspoon of chili paste due to other reviews, but could have handled the 2 teaspoons after all.

I will definitely make this one again.  I worked today and this was very easy to put together, just a little chopping involved.  I could not find the chili paste or noodles at my local grocer and substituted sweet chili sauce and curly Asian noodles.  It still came out fabulous with just the right amount of heat.

Delicious! This is quickly becoming a new family favorite. I use fresh yakisoba noodles from my local Asian grocer. I marinate the chicken in soy sauce and then throw chicken,cabbage and onions together in my electric wok with some tonkatsu and 1-2 Tbsp of Thai Chili Garlic Sauce or Sambal Oelek. This might not be 100% authentic Japanese, but it is pretty close to the one I have from my Japanese cookbook. Thanks for an awesome recipe

This recipe was very delicious. I'm a heat lover, so the amount of chili paste was perfect for me.My girlfriend was a little overwhelmed by the heat, however, so be careful with how much chili paste you add. Make sure the oil isn't too hot when you add the chili paste because it will splatter. Also, this recipe requires a good-sized wok or stir-fry pan, as mine could barely hold all the ingredients. Fortunately, this recipe looks very easy to halve. As leftovers, this meal is still pretty good, but the soba noodles may turn to mush in the fridge. It's possible that I overcooked them, though, as they were very thin and delicate. I have no idea if this is an authentic yakisoba dish, but that doesn't matter to me because it tastes great.

I admit at first I was a little skeptical about trying the Buckwheat Soba noodles with yam, but they actually were really good. I have tried other types of Japanese noodles, and I actually liked these the best. Next time I might use Low Sodium Soy Sauce, but other than that, we enjoyed this very much.

Delicious! We used half the chile paste so that it wasn't that spicy. Also to make it salty we subsituted half the soy sauce or light soy sauce.

My husband loved this recipe. I thought it was very good but I wasn't gaga over it like he is. I enjoy making Asian food-be sure to prepare all your ingredients and chop the vegetables before starting, it goes fast. I cheated on this and used pre-shredded cabbage and carrots from the store. I also used roasted red chili paste and it was just the right amount of spiciness. The soba noodles were good too. I will use them in other dishes as well.

Excellent if you're looking for something more flavorful than just standard chicken dishes!!  I used more chinese vegetables and left out the cabbage since my husband doesn't like it.  Also, I used UDON noodles instead - they are more like lo mein noodles. Excellent recipe!!

Great recipe. I couldn't find soba noodles so I used rice noodles which I thought were a little chewy but still good. Also had to substitute chili sauce for chili paste. Wasn't as spicy as I would have liked probably due to the substitution. Will spice it up more next time.

This is soooooo simple and yet....sooooo tasty. I admit I was a little skeptical of how good it would be but it got rave reviews from my biggest critic - my husband. I used stirfry noodles (all I could find) - the spice was just right. I only added 2 tbsp of Oyster sauce to the veggies and added zucchini too. FANTASTIC!

I really loved this recipe.  Didn't add carrots because I didn't have them, added napa cabbage and rooster sauce because that is what I had.  It was VERY spicey, and I LOVE spicey so I was thrilled with this new recipe.  will make again!
thanks for the recipe.

Pretty Good - I agree about the chili paste (change to 2 tsp instead)plus I would lessen the amount of soy sauce-  Yakisoba is too wet.

With a few modifications, this was very good. Used low sodium soy sauce, more garlic and vegies and cut back on the chile paste. Added more seasonings too. Family was very happy and thanks!

This was just OK. I liked the spicy, salty flavour but felt like something was missing? The addition of honey and fresh chopped ginger would probably help lift the taste of this dish.

This was really good.  I made some changes:  I used peanut oil instead of canola, I added 1 1/2 cups broccoli, 1 cup of mushrooms and because of all the veggies made a little extra sauce due to the veggies.  I highly recommend this recipe, my husband and I both loved it!

excellent.  you can control level of heat in this recipe by reducing the amount of chili past e you use.  i think i will reduce it to 1 1/2 tablespoon next time.  great flavor and texture.  everything you would want in a dish.  THANKS!

My whole family loved this!  I did add a little less chili paste, as I'm familiar with it, and I know my small children won't eat it that spicy, but this was delicous.  I also used fresh soba noodles from the refrigerated section of my grocery store,  Yummy.

I like this recipe, but feel a need to tinker with it just a bit.  It seemed on the edge of too salty, so I reccommend using low sodium soy  sauce.  I did not have chile paste, so I used sezchuan sauce which is pretty hot and spicy.  Everybody liked it-just not as enthusiastically as my old recipe.

This is a great dish.  I found the quantities to be perfect.  The first time I made this, I didn't use a big enough pan which was difficult.  As the recipe reads, it was a bit to spicy for my 2 year old, but perfect for my husband and myself.  To solve this, I now omit the chili sauce and add a sweet-hot chili paste as condiment at the table.
