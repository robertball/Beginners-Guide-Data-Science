Loved this recipe.  I didn't add the romano or walnuts to the dressing, but added them to the salad once it was tossed with dressing.  I toasted the walnuts.  This was an excellent combination of flavors!  Very nice taste.  Will definitely be a favorite in our house - thanks for sharing!

I used this on a mixed green salad with arugula, sorrel, mint, chives & lemon balm.  I also added the walnuts (toasted) to the salad after plating. Very bright flavor; excellent with the slightly bitter greens.

This dressing is delicious! My fruit was not terribly sweet, so I added a few drops of honey. I tossed it with half spinach, half mixed greens, and some orange and grapefruit segments, but didn't use nuts or cheese. So fresh, so light. I'll definitely keep this one.

This was good, didn't use the cheese, personal taste and added some honey. When I opened the refrigerator to put it in I spied a jar of fresh raspberry puree that I made, couldn't resist and added some to it, Oh my is that good!

I didn't put as much olive oil in the dressing, added a bit of garlic salt too. I no longer cared about the salad. I was eating the dressing with a spoon! Yummy

This recipe is wonderful. Made something like this in my cooking class. Except I used cider vinegar and feta cheese.

Yum, I love citrus so of course I loved this! I thought I had an orange, but didn't so I added more grapefruit. Delish!

This was pretty good.  I only had white wine vinegar, so I added a tsp of sugar to compensate for the lost sweetness of the balsamic.

Didn't care for white vinegar , it looked like just oil. It needed some oregano to give it color but still had bad taste so this was prob better left without vinergar if it's citrus dressing. Sorry.
