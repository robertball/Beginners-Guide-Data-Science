I made this tonight based on the daily recommendations and saw the 5 star rating. Wasn’t until afterwards that I saw it was based on 2 reviews. The chili was good, not great, but good. Minus 2 changes, I followed the recipe as written. I didn’t have white wine, so I used the same amount of a dark beer. I also didn’t feel like measuring 2 cups of picante sauce, so I just used the whole jar. We topped it with sour cream and cheese. I might make it again.
