This was excellent and the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is due to the fact I made a few modifications. I replaced the mayo (not a fan) with light sour cream, reduced feta to one cup, adding one cup of mozzerella instead, added one large crushed garlic clove, fresh ground black pepper, and instead of just parmesan, I used a parmesan/romano/asiago blend. I also broiled it for an additional 5 minutes to crisp up the top. Served with pita chips. I think next time I might add jalapeno to give it some heat.

This was really yummy!  I halved the recipe and added a clove of garlic, and ground pepper.  I also added some monterey jack cheese as I had some that I needed to use up.  This dip looked great, and it would look like a great Christmas-style dip if spinach was added.  Personally, I would add a little less feta and more stringy cheese next time, but if you're a feta lover, go ahead and make this recipe as is.  You won't be disappointed!  UPDATE:  Since I made this one for myself I wasn't able to eat the whole thing.  I put the leftovers in the fridge and re-heated them the next day or two.   It actually tasted better.  Next time I make it, I'll assemble the ingredients and let it sit together for a couple of days.  Awesome recipe.

The feta cheese was a really interesting change of pace in a hot dip, and I'll definitely make this again. I did substitute half of the mayo with sour cream as I know from experience that much makes dips a little too oily, and with the oil-packed peppers it would have been even worse. I also used half feta and half "italian blend" cheese, and as the feta flavor was pronounced enough I'm not sure I would have been too crazy about two cups of feta. Marinated artichoke hearts seasoned the dip nicely. The red pepper pieces look very festive in the dip and add great flavor - thanks for sharing.

Delicious dip!  I am only giving it four stars because I made some changes just to up the flavors a bit.  I changed the mayo to 1/2 C and added 1/2 sour cream.  I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic, some black pepper, and 1/2 C mozzarella cheese, and dropped the feta down to 1 cup.  I took this to BUNCO night and it was a big hit!  Great recipe!

I baked it for a little longer and it was so good!  We couldn't stop eating it!  I also exchanged the mayo for sour cream, and used half feta and half shredded mozz cheese and it was so creamy and cheesy, a perfect combination.

Overall, the dip recipe is pretty good but I made a few modifications. First, I added only 1 cup of feta and replaced the 1 cup of mayo with 1/2 mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream. I also added some sharp cheddar cheese, green onions, and olives. If you put the artichoke hearts into a food processor, you get a nice smooth, creamy dip texture.

I made this for our Christmas Eve party. It looked festive with the red peppers and green artichokes. I substituted a 12 oz. jar of marinated artichokes, drained and chopped, to give more flavor. It was a big hit. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I am sure it will be a family favorite for years to come. Thank you!

I was unable to find the peppers, so i finely chopped some jalapenos, rather than all of the feta, i added 1/2 cup blue cheese crumbles...very very good. Next time, though, I will be more careful to get all water out of artichoke hearts to avoid a runny dip. Will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit.  I might add more roasted red pepper next time to give it even more flavor.  Can't wait to make it again!

I am definitely keeping this one! Only thing I changed was to add some pepper. I think it would be very nice with Asiago cheese along with the parmesan. It is pretty expensive to make, what with the 2 cups of feta and the roasted red peppers, etc.  I used fresh shredded parmesan as I don't think the finely grated "powdery" kind would be the same at all.  This makes a large amount of dip, but cost me almost $20 to make.

I followed other's reccomendations and used 1/2 c mayo (lowfat) and 1/2 c sour cream (lowfat). Also, I only used 1 c feta and 1 cup italian blend shredded cheese. It was fantastic, everyone wanted the recipe.

This was really, really creamy and absolutely scrumptious!   However, it was a tad salty - the feta and the Parmesan both together was probably a little too much. Next time, I'll only do feta.   I made two changes based on everyone's reviews: 1. I added garlic (One large clove) 2. Subbed the mayo for sour cream. (Not a fan of raw eggs in the mayo.)  Will make again.....and again.....and again! :)

I made this for girls night out and it was a big hit.  I went by other suggestions and used half mayo/half sour cream and half feta/half mozzarella. I would definitely make this again, however, I might cut the recipe in half as it really made a lot.  Hubby loved the leftovers too.  Thank you for a great recipe.

YUM! -- not your average artichoke dip!  Loved the red peppers in it.  Mine came out a little "looser" then I'd like, but I did half mayo/half sour cream, so maybe that's my fault.  I used just a bit less feta and added mozzerella for a cheesier end result. I'd still do the mayo/s.c. combo next time, but possibly use a bit less of it and add extra mozz. for a thicker dip.  We had it with pita chips, crackers and fire roasted tomato triscuits.  Yum Yum Yum!!

Thought this was a great base dip and love the primary ingredients.  Yum.  I reduced the cheeses by half and added some minced garlic.  I served it with pita crisps at a party and everyone loved it.  Smelled heavenly warming in the oven.

This was amazing!! I couldn't stop eating it. I threw some frozen garlic naan in the oven for a few minutes to let it get a little crispy and then served with the dip. It was so yummy!

This was so very easy and very tasty!  I severed this with simple Townhouse Topper crackers and everyone said it was very good.  Super easy but a little on the expensive side for an appitizer.  The artichokes, feta and roasted red peppers are somewhat pricey ingrediants.  Still for the time saved on a good recipie- it's worth it!

This was awesome! I was skeptical the feta would dominate the dosh, but it was perfect. A keeper for sure, thanks!

I made this dip five times over the holidays and everywhere I took it, it was a hit.  My nephew wanted to just spread it on bread and make a sandwich!

This was a real easy app to make. I put the artichokes and roasted peppers in a food processor to chop them up and added 2-3 cloves of garlic. I also used sun dried tomato feta for more flavor.

Great! My boyfriend loved it and will definitely  make again. Although the recipe was a bit salty and rich for my taste ( i'm not huge on mayonnaise so thats probably why)  but still delicious!

Following the original KraftFoods recipe, I use a jar of diced pimientos, and a generous tablespoon of minced garlic.  For presentation's sake, I also change the oven setting to "broil" for a minute or so, to brown up the top.  Always a hit at holiday parties with woven wheat crackers!

I substitute mild green chili peppers or sun-dried tomatoes for the red pepper.

This just didn't really do it for me - guess I didn't like the combo.  I followed exactly except I substituted 8 oz cream cheese for the mayo.  I know from experience that I hate a large amount of cooked mayo.  I didn't find the 2 cups of feta overpowering at all; I almost forgot it was in there.  I think you could easily use the 12 oz jar of roasted red peppers to give it more flavor.  I had a friend over for appetizers and he didn't really eat much of it.

Very tasty.  If you like thing hot, don't be afraid to add a few chopped jalepenos as well.

This was really good, I added some leftover creamed spinach that I had and it turned out perfect! Served warm with french bread and crackers
