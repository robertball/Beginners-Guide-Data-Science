OK, I have been searching for a good "all-purpose" white bread dough recipe - one that looks good, tastes good, feels soft, and doesn't get stale right away (yes, I'm a stickler, but when you go to all the trouble to make it yourself, you want it to be good).  I just made these today, and so far the first three criteria are met!  These rolls are GORGEOUS; even the dough is beautiful when you're working with it.  They didn't taste bland to me at all, and usually I have to increase the salt or the sweetener in doughs.  They are soft and yummy.  I made 6 hamburger buns, 6 hot dog.  I sprinkled sesame seeds on the hamb. buns.  I just greased my cookie sheets - worked great!  I'll see how they hold up in terms of getting stale - homemade bread does dry out sooner, but that's because it's not full of all those preservatives anyway!  I have the leftovers in the freezer and will update on the "freshness factor" when I thaw them.  You could easily get 24 smaller rolls out of this recipe. Highly recommend!
*** Next day... I pulled one of the hamb. buns out of the freezer & thawed it in the microwave.  Still very good texture & softness, although if you overheat it the bun can get a little tough.  Thawing on the counter might have been a better idea.  But this is good enough for me - I will look no further!  LOVE IT!   *** Even more updates - yes, thaw them on the counter, then heat in the microwave JUST until warm (for me, about 25 seconds for a hamb. bun).  Delish.

Lovely soft, ethereal, yeasty pillows that will elevate your burgers well beyond the ordinary. Perfect exactly as written. Just be mindful not to add too much flour. The dough should feel ever-so-slightly sticky to the touch, so go somewhat light on your first flour addition. If you squeeze some in your hand, it should adhere just for a second or two before falling when you release it. If using a bread machine, check it after the initial kneading, while it rests, before the long knead part of the cycle, and add flour if too sticky, add a few drops of water if the dough seems heavy or dry. Check again 2-4 minutes into the second knead and adjust again, as necessary. The complaint that these rolls are too "dense", providing sufficient rising time is allowed per the recipe, is because of 1) insufficient kneading 2) insufficient rising time or 3) too much flour in proportion to liquid. The amount of flour when baking breads is not a precise science. Think of it as an "area" and not a "point." The amount can vary from one time to the next, depending on the humidity, altitude, barometric pressure, accuracy of measurement, if you've sifted, age of your flour, etc. Work by feel and don't consider any measurement to be carved in stone, if you want to produce perfect yeast breads of any kind. Use the minimum amount of flour necessary to achieve the above-described feel to the dough, and you'll make the most heavenly bread on earth, each and every time.

Due to poor reviews on the other hamburger bun recipes I tried this one which had NO ratings. I liked it. The buns turned out perfect & I even made sandwich rolls (like hoagie). The consistency of this finished product made a perfect (not soggy or mushy) hamburger bun. It is important for all cooks to know, when you work with yeast it is important to read on the jar/package the manufacturers recommendations for liquid temperatures. I learned that because I was adding liquid to the yeast/flour mixture I could put in the liquid when it registered 120-130 degrees. It probably wouldn't have risen had I not read the instructions on the yeast pkg first.

This a nice hamburger bun recipe. My family and I really enjoyed it. I have read many of the reviews and think I can offer some help to those who are stuggling. You will have a very dense bun if you add too much flour. When you are adding the last two cups of flour, add them in a little at a time. When the dough starts to pull away from the bowl and is not so sticky that you have a sticky "pool" of it at the base of your bowl, you have the right amount of flour. It will still be a little sticky, but you will have a very light dough.  If you find that your dough isn't rising well, there are a couple things you can do. First, check your yeast and make sure it is still good. You can do this by adding some yeast to warm water and adding a little flour or sugar. Leave it for about 10 minutes. At this point, it should be frothy or creamy looking. If it doesn't do anything, you need new yeast. Another thing you could do is switch flours to bread flour. It has a higher gluten content, and it should do better in the rising phase. If you wish to make the recipe with 100% whole wheat flour add a little gluten flour; a tablespoon for every cup of flour. I use this for making a 100% whole wheat breads with freshly ground wheat. It will help your dough rise. I hope this helps someone. :)

Because I had run out of AP flour, I used whole wheat. I replaced the sugar with honey and only because this is how I'm used to making bread, I proofed my yeast by adding the warm liquid to it. Once bubbly, I then added my dry ingredients. After the egg wash, I sprinkled on some sesame seeds. My family raved over these buns, including my hubby who is not a bread person! Thank you!

This was a simple and delicious recipe. the batch size was perfect. I Wraped the dough around scrambled eggs, sausage, and cheese before the last proof; it made an easy breakfast sandwich which is portable and hearty. I also used it to make hotdog buns for polish dogs

Nice texture and very forgiving...My 3yo and I made these to hold bbq filling this weekend and everyone loved them.  I used the exact ingredients, but mixed them up as we usually do. I let my daughter roll and pat the dough until they were almost flat..but they still rose beautifully. I did end up tossing on some minced onion and poppy seeds which gave "Tay-Tay's buns" some extra flavor...Thanks Belle!

Wonderful recipe.  I divided the silky dough into 8 large buns.  All the family enjoyed them, with the soft crust and chewy, soft crumb.  The buns were a little thick for our tenderloin sandwiches, but would be perfect for hamburgers or cold cuts.  The next day, the leftovers were great warmed with jam, too.  I make bread quite often and intend on adding this to the favorites.

This is a great recipe, very easy & made very good buns. After I brushed the tops with the egg/water mixture I put sesame seed on top. Will use again and again.

Wonderful buns.  I make them up and keep on hand in the freezer.  So much better and healthier than store bought.

The taste was OK--it tasted a bit salty though. The recipe submitter said they are light and fluffy, but that's not how they turned out for me. They were kinda of hard from the outside and chewy from the inside like french bread. They were also too heavy for a hamburger or hot dog bun. The bread is thick and heavy that it steals the spotlight from the slice of meat or hot dog sausage you use. The bread fills you up before you reach the meat. Perhaps this recipe would be better to use for dinner rolls? Definitely not hamburger buns. Also, I wanted to add that you need way less flour than the recipe calls for. I almost used 4 cups. As soon as I mixed 3 cups of flour w/ the yeast mixture, the forming dough looked dry. The dough was easy to work with. Kneading the dough was the only light & fluffy thing in this recipe. Sorry. I may try again since I like to give some recipes a second chance. We'll see.

If you wanted a SOFTER outer crust do NOT do the egg wash before baking.  INSTEAD you should BASTE THE TOPS WITH JUST MILK for a "milk crust" just before baking  -- it's a SOFT crust like store-bought bread crust.  The egg wash gives it a shiny gloss... Egg white more just gloss, with the yolk it'll be a more yellowy gloss.  You can tailor make the type of crust you want.  If you put a pan of water, or ice cubes in the bottom of the oven it will steam them and they will be very chewy crusts, like French bread.


Personally, I'm going to try it with a whole egg wash sprinkled with pre-toasted sesame seeds.  Mmmmmmmm, good!  ;-)

I'm new to the world of bread baking, and this was my first attempt at making hamburger buns.  I topped some with sesame seeds, a few with dried minced onion, and left a couple plain. I didn't flatten them at all, and that's something I would do in the future. They ended up looking more like a dinner roll rather than a hamburger bun.  Although they look very nice, they're not the texture I was looking for in a hamburger bun, too dense/doughy, but that well could have been my lack of yeast bread baking experience.  I'm planning to try this again using less flour to see if that will help lighten the texture.  Still pretty tasty.  UPDATE 9/3/11:  Made again today starting with 4 cups of flour and added about another 1/2 to 3/4 cup of flour while kneading in the KA.   I also think I over-kneaded the dough yesterday, so today I kneaded just until the dough started pulling away from the sides of the bowl.  I made 12 good-sized balls which when slightly flattened turned out absolutely perfectly for a 1/3 lb burger (and they LOOKED like hamburger buns).  Many reviewers made the comment about the buns being heavy, and based on how these buns turned out today, I think this recipe calls for too much flour.  The texture was MUCH IMPROVED over what I made yesterday.

These tasted great, but didn't rise much for me and they were awfully dense.  I made sure to not use too much flour (started w/just over 4C and didn't need to add anymore to make the dough not sticky), but they were not light and airy.

I have made these many times and if you want a great bun with wonderful flavor that is a light textured bread, make these.  If you want fluffy flavorless sweet-tasting buns, buy a package from the store.. these are not your typical fluffy mass produced, tasteless, lifeless and laying waste in a plastic bag.  I am laughing at many of the comments - "they didn't rise", "they aren't like hamburger buns should be", "they are too dense".. well, I have news for you, we've all become so accustomed to eating that mass produced garbage that it is now how we gauge what things should taste like.  Step aside Sara Lee.. REAL buns are here!

Worked very well with our pre-made hamburger patties.  I will use some garlic powder next time to give it a bit more flavor.  Also, after I let the milk mixture cool, I added the yeast to it and let it sit about 10 minutes until foamy as others stated.  Worked well.

These worked out great.  A little on the dense side but maybe I added too much flour.

Awesome! I made the dough in the breadmaker. Just skip steps 1 & 2, and start by putting all ingredients in the breadpan in the order recommended by manufacturer. Pick up on step 3 and enjoy! I also replaced 1 1/2 cups of flour with whole wheat all-purpose flour. My husband and 3 year old loved them!

These were amazing, I added some garlic powder and montreal steak seasoning to them.  They work for a lot of things.  We had them with our burgers one night, egg sandwiches in the morning, and garlic bread with our lasagna the following night.  I will definately make them again.

Made these today and they turned out great! I used 1 C. wholewheat flour and the rest white flour. Reading the reviews I noticed the people talking about how dense they were. I think the mistake some are making is to add the entire 5 1/2 cups flour rather than judging when enough has been added. I also used honey instead of sugar and  let the yeast mix with the warm liquid rather than add it to the flour, I baked 1 pan at a time getting 13 big buns! They will be very good for sandwiches or even just eat with butter and jam.  A sure way to impress if you're doing a summer BBQ. Thank you Belle!

Easy?  Yes, with a dough hook on a stand mixer.  Tasty?  Yes, though I had trouble getting the top to brown and the bottom not to burn, even after following the instructions regarding the oven racks.  Also, my buns were sort of flat and slightly dense but I've never been one to have luck with yeast breads.  I might try this recipe again, as the imperfections could be my fault.

Next time I'll use my tried and true bread recipe. I'm not quite sure where things went wrong. Wet mixture was at 110ºF, the usual lukewarm temp for water for yeast. But the dough was reluctant to rise.

I make these breakfast rolls, by putting the desired filling in after the first rise.  Then put them on a baking sheet, and freeze.  Take them out an hour or so before you need to cook them and let them finish rising for the last time.  Then bake.I also add a little extra yeast when I am doing this.  I work shift work, and it is hard to keep a family fed.  Sometimes when I have a few days off, I will make up a batch with pizza like fillings , or a bunch of different cheeses .  The field is wide open.And the beauty of it is, the six youngsters can take them out and cook them themselves.  Of course, you run the risk of a teen age party making a run on them when you are there, but that is OK, it is good nourishing food, and I know where they are.

Very very light and fluffy! I have made the dough in a bread machine, using the exact ingredients, 3 times now. Every time, they turn out exactly right. This last time I split the dough in half, used half for rolls, and I rolled out the other half into a large rectangle, covered it with melted butter, cinnamon, sugar and brown sugar, rolled it up, sliced in 1/2 inch sections, let rise till doubled and baked at 375 for 10 min. The best cinnamon rolls ever! they were STILL so light and fluffy! Thanks so much for this recipe!

I wish I could give this recipe 0 stars. It never even made it to the oven. I knew as soon as I added the liquid to the flour mixture that it was going to be a disaster. I kept going anyway and it gave my stand mixer hell. It was a dry, crumbly dough that would have never held together. But definitely proof the yeast first and decrease the amount of flour. 5 1/2 cups is way too much. (I make some sort of bread from scratch almost every week. I should have known better.) UPDATE: I tried again used less flour and proofed the yeast. still turned out like so-so biscuits and not at all like hamburger buns. I won't try again. sorry.

Very disappointed!.  Made this two times.  The first time the dough never rose!  The second time I proofed the yeast first and added to the dry ingredients with the wet and it did rise to double.  Did everything else exact.  The buns had a hard time even getting golden brown so I had to get them out of the oven.   Well, the buns were indeed dense and more like dinner rolls, tasty (thus the two stars and not one) but way too heavy to eat with burgers or pulled pork. Good to eat as a roll with dinner or on its own.   My flour is new, everything is new and it just did not work!  Why all the 5 stars when this recipe is just not what its cracked up to be.

I had to make these twice because they were far too dense the first time around. After reading more reviews I learned two important things that really made these turn out perfect. 1. read the instructions on the yeast packet. The instructions in the recipe say to let the heated liquids cool until look warm, however my yeast said to add flour mixture when liquid is 120*-130*F. 2. Slowly add the flour near the end until you have the dough at a slightly sticky texture. If you squeeze it between your fingers it should stick and then come off after a second or so. We've tried these with hamburgers and sandwiches and they are great!

These are an excellent simple hamburger bun recipe.  I make them frequently for sandwich rolls.  I have even made them for hotdog buns!

To make them into pretzel buns (I made pretzel hotdog buns with this recipe tonight - amazing), form the dough into the desired shape, allow to rest for ten minutes and then dip them into a almost boiling water bath mixture of water and baking soda for 20-25 seconds.  Pat dry and bake for approximately 14-16 minutes or until a dark brown.

I made half the recipe using my bread machine, and they were excellent! At first I thought the outer crust would be too tough, not at all! Good flavor, perfect consistancy for bugers. I'm going to make sure to save this one, it is now my go to for hamburger buns!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! I frequently make homemade bread and usually do all of the mixing/kneading by hand since I don't have a dough hook or a bread machine. This recipe is so easy and almost perfect as written. I only used 5 cups of flour. And after putting the egg wash on, I sprinkled dried chopped onion and garlic salt on top of the buns. They were wonderful! Thank you for a great recipe!

:: Start with only 4 cups of flour!!  The 5.5 cups it calls for is TOO MUCH::

These rolls were perfection. I used rapid rise yeast instead of active dry yeast and I used brown sugar instead of white (becuase it was what I had on hand).  I only needed 5 cups of flour, the dough was pretty dry at 5 cups, next time I will start with4.5 adn add in the other flour as needed while kneading.  The kneading for the full 10 minutes really paid off.These rolls are absolutely delicious.  Next time I think I will add some dried onions and make onion sandwich rolls.

Update!!  This recipe makes PERFECT garlic bread sticks. I followed everything exactly except I use the rapid rise yeast and bread flour and then roll them into sticks. Brush them with butter before they go in the oven, and again after they come out and then dust them with garlic salt. THey were better than olive garden!

I LOVE this recipe. I have made these buns about a dozen times and just havent reviewed until now. I have used this recipe to make hoggies, hot dog buns and hamburger buns, all with great success. Everyone that tries them cannot believ they are homemade. I have replaced the sugar with honey in some of the times i have made this as well as used butter on top instead of the egg mixture, each of these changes worked wonderfully. I honestly believe this is the easiest bun recipe out there. Thanks for sharing!

First I made these according to the recipe and they were good.  I thought the texture was a bit dense, but they were good.  THEN I made them again but added and egg and they were wonderful!  Much ligher and fluffier texture (even though I also replaced 1 1/2 c of the white flour with whole wheat).  I will definitely make these again with the addition of an egg.

I really loved this.  I made a couple simple changes.  I added the yeast only to the lukewarm liquid, and let it stand for a few minutes until it started to foam.  I always do this when I make any bread recipe, but I just learned that this is called "proofing" the yeast.  I used part whole-wheat and part white flour. I did not brush with egg.  I brushed some melted butter on top after they came out of the oven.  That kept them soft on top. The mistake I made was letting them cool in the pans.  The bottoms got a little too hard.  Next time I'll cool on a cooling rack. These were soft (except for the bottoms!) and delicious.   These are a "make-again" as my kids say.

Once the water/milk/butter mixture came down to 110 degrees I added the yeast and let it bloom for about 10 minutes.  I added **ONLY 3 CUPS of FLOUR** to the wet ingredients, kneaded for 10 minutes and rested the dough on a wire rack over a pot of hot water.  Wonderful results. I will definitely make again.

worth the work!  I ended up using about a cup less flour than called for - I put the yeast in the warm liquid and added flour a cup at a time.  Make sure you don't let it rise longer than 1 hour before splitting up the dough into buns, otherwise your buns are a little flat, but still flakey on the inside and chewy outside!

Made these today, and I was definitely pleasantly surprised! I usually hate hamburger buns, especially the cardboard-flavoured store-bought ones, but these were very nice. They look so wonderful, too. Even though I was only cooking for one, I made a full batch and I'll be enjoying the rest for lunch next week, freezing them in batches.   I did do what I've always been thought to do with the yeast; mix lukewarm water and sugar with the yeast and leave it for ten minutes. I then poured it in with the flour, milk, butter and salt and took my frustrations out on the poor dough *laughs*  These are easy to make and comes out great, and I'll definitely make them more often.

I made these to go with BBQ beef that I prepared for dinner but couldn't help having part of one warm from the oven with a little butter.  These are nothing short of amazingly delicious and so easy to make. These are going to be a bread that I will prepare every week to have on hand for sandwiches, buns, dinner rolls, etc.  Just fantastic  - thanks so much!

For those comments on the "denseness" of these buns... um, yeah.. they aren't the buns you buy off the shelf at the grocery store.  This should not be a huge surprise.  Mine turn out light and fluffy, but an incorrect measure of flour or overmixing can make them dense and too dry to mix.  NEVER PACK YOUR FLOUR IN A MEASURING CUP!!  If you do, you'll get way too much flour.  If you want a light bun, you can cut back on the kneading by a couple minutes and then brush with butter at the end of cooking time. Your dough should be sticky and adhere to the bottom of your mixing bowl, but clean off the sides.   Also, for those of you who want to change up the recipe to proof your yeast in the warm liquids.. that works too.  I've made them both ways and have never had a problem with the rise.  Allrecipes changed that part of the directions.. for whatever reason when they published it, but either way works.  If the buns are dry, it could be you over kneaded them, did not measure your flour properly (too much) or something different as a different altitude or a sunny vs. a rainy day.. which can effect bread baking.

Just made these for a cookout I hosted. Everyone was amazed to see fresh buns being made but the only thing that amazed them more was the taste. These things come out looking gorgeous and I'm an amateur who's never even made bread before. Only advice is don't think you need to follow the amount of flour exactly as called for. Start with 3 cups or so and keep adding until the dough is not sticking to your hands. I ended up only using like 4 cups.

Careful when adding flour, I ended up needing only 4 cups to make the perfect dough. I added only 1 tsp of salt because I used salted butter. I brushed the tops with milk since I heard it makes them soft, not crispy on top. I thought the recipe failed because they came out of the oven almost rock hard, but softened up immensely as they cooled. I baked them to use for sandwiches for my husbands lunches so as soon as they cooled, I grabbed the funniest looking one and made a sandwich to taste test. It was delicious! I thought it was the perfect mixture of softness/chewiness and the taste was delicious.

I'm new to yeast, but i usually dissolve the yeast first.   I can see the yeast in the mixture.  Also, the dough isn't rising at all.  Not sure how they will bake. Not impressed so far. Update: did not rise.

I did not like these. They came out beautiful but they are way too dense and bland.  Hamburger buns should be light and fluffy, these came out very heavy (heavier than potato bread).  I do not think the bun benefited from the egg wash, unless you like your hamburger buns on the crunchy side.  I might even compare the texture of this bread to French bread, or pizza crust, a really dense form of it.  I always follow recipes to the letter the first time, so I know I didn't make any mistakes.

I think these were very nice but I did have to make a couple of tweaks.  I mixed 2 cups of flour with the yeast and added the milk mixture, while mixing I gradually added the remaining flour, but found that after 4 3/4 cups it was starting to look dry.  Not one for wasting things, I chucked the egg white in and let the mixer knead it for a little more than 8 minutes.  It was just enough moisture.  These are not like commercial buns, they are better with a crunchy outside and fluffy soft inside.  I was afraid after other reviews they may be bland so I sprinkled herbs de province on half of them.  Both with and without they were very nice, I would say you just need to add half of the flour slowly because depending on the humidity in the air you may use more or less than the recipe calls for.

These were easy and very good. I found I didn't need all the flour called for, so perhaps those who are having trouble would benefit from just adding it as needed instead of dumping it in all at once.

Easy, soft & delicious!  I toss the ingredients into the bread machine, split the dough into 12 buns and bake them on a stone.  The bread machine does all the hard work and it takes less time than running to the grocery store to buy a bag of buns.

Although, they rose well and appeared to have turned out well they seemed to be lacking in flavor and to be very dense. I ended up adding a couple small spoons of water to the mixer as the dough seemed very heavy to me. The directions were easy to follow, though I didn't understand why with the end product they were so hearty. I guess the texture of the dough should have been an indicator of that. The only thing I can think is that the buns at the stores and bakeries add dough conditioners which causes them to over rise and be super soft. Although, I thought they tasted more like a dense sub bread it was still better than buying store bought and not knowing what is in them. I would have just prefered a lighter bun.

These buns are amazing!! So moist and delicious! The only thing I changed was mixing it in my bread machine for 15 minutes and then unplugging and allowing to rise in the warm mixer for 30 minutes. My husband told me we can never go back to store bought!

I followed the recipe exceptly except I used buttermilk (I had some leftover) and the buns were as advertised. I would flatten them a little more before baking, but they are fantastic. I used carroway seeds on the top and the aroma in this house is overwhelming. This will be my go-to hamburger bun recipe.

These were very good when they were first made. The next day we used them for Hamburger buns and they fell apart. It was like they were too dry. I stored them in a plastic bag after they were completely cooled.

Amazing!  I prepped the ingredients a few hours early and used the bread machine dough cycle. I peaked when it was mixing and had my doubts; the dough seemed very heavy and I had to resist adding liquid.  After it was done rising I was greeted with beautiful dough that was overfilling the machine.  I punched down and shaped into 8 large burger buns.  I let them rise on a greased baking sheet I sprinkled with cornmeal.  I had to help the rising process along by warming the oven to 100 degrees than turning off.  It took them about 20 minutes in there.  I baked the 2 pans individually.  I forgot the egg wash for the first pan, they were soft with a very slight crust, I remembered for the second pan, and added a light sprinkling of sesame seeds.  That batch was glossy and crusty.  I suggest toasting the split buns or using then day old if using a "wet" filling like pulled pork or sloppy joes.  

As for the people that had "thick" dough.  I wonder if you maybe needed to knead more and let rise longer?  This was about double a loaf recipe.  If I didn't use my bread machine to mix the dough I probably would have gotten tired and under mixed the dough.  Also, it was cold and dry today...the second rising took double what it does in the summer, but was probably key to these amazing buns!

Mixed with bread machine on dough cycle, starting with 4 cups flour, adding only 1/2 cup more while mixing. Total of 4 1/2 cups flour. Substituted buttermilk, half bread flour, Canola oil. Made 8 large sandwich (HB) buns. Used them with NEAT SLOPPY JOES, on this site. My husband really likes them. Thanks.

I've made a lot of rolls ~ I made these for hamburger buns and I'm a little confused with the 5 star ratings. The taste of these was really good, but they do come out very heavy and dense. I've made these twice (to possibly account for human error), and while the dough was easy to work with and light both times, the buns are not. Good taste though!

These did not turn out at all - we followed the directions to the letter and we ended up with dense, tasteless lumps. We don't ever change a recipe until we've made it at least once with no changes - therefore we didn't proof the yeast or anything first. Not too sure why these didn't turn out unfortunately they ended up in the trash... (you know it's a bad sign when the yeast is still undissolved when you form the dough into balls and it falls out of the dough into your hands...)

I thought these were great! Yes, they are going to be more dense than the off the shelf buns, duh. However, mine were still very fluffy. Family loved them and they held up really well with juicy grilled burgers and all the toppings. Thanks for the great recipe ;)

They taste ok but they are very dense and not exactly what I would consider a hamburger bun.  I think that proofing the yeast would have helped them rise better and hence be a little less dense.

Great hamburger bun recipe! Simple, fast (as far as yeast dough is concerned that is), and delicious. I halved the recipe using a full envelope of yeast and and entire egg. It made 8 perfect buns for Slopy Joes II. I have no complaints here. Baked up beautifully as instructed. Will definitely use this bun recipe in the future. Thanks for a keeper! :)

These were so easy to make. Who knew? The dough was so easy to work with. They are much better than store bought, and they held up really well with our BBQ sandwiches. The only thing I'll do different next time is make them a little bigger when I portion out the buns.

I don't know if I did something wrong but they came out hard on the outside and very dense and chewy on the inside, which could be a good thing if I was going for a French Baguette and not a soft hamburger bun. They also lacked any flavor what so ever. Sorry but I will not use this recipe again.

I was planning on making sliders for company that was coming over, and naturally the one time that I needed them, I couldn't find any slider buns at the store.  So I decided to give this recipe a try.  Fortunately, I was smart enough to read the other reviews.  To echo what others have said, yes, 5 1/2 cups is waaaaaay to much flour.  In my case, I stopped at 4 3/4 cups, and in retrospect, I probably could have used even less.  I left the rest of the recipe unchanged, and they came out very nicely.  More than one person asked me where I got the buns, and couldn't get enough of them.

For the tl;dr crowd,  here's my quick notes.  Stop adding flour when the dough is sticky, but not so much that you can't handle it.  You'll be happy!

WEIGH the flour! Reviews that state the bread is too dense may have a flour measuring issue. A cup of flour is not always a "cup". If you dip the cup in the flour you may actually pack it. If you dip the scoop in the container then pour it in the cup & level the cup you don't always get the same amount in each scoop and you get air pockets in the cup. The best way is to get a scale and figure how many grams are in a cup of flour. Don't be so quick to keep adding flour. If you think the dough appears wet, give it a moment. It is tempting to add a lot of flour and before you know it tough bread. This bread is really good!  I make it a lot. I make it for sandwiches as well as for meatball sub-rolls. Another tip: keep that thermometer!  I am at sea-level so my bread is "done" at 212 degrees. You should know at what temperature your bread is considered "done" or when to pull it out of the oven. I like to have a very crispy crust when doing the sub rolls so I turn the oven off when done, open the oven door and leave the rolls in the oven to cool. If all else fails, you can get a bread machine. I'm not talking expensive. You can get one for ~$50 just to make dough. It can be gentler to the dough and you can still shape it and bake it in the oven. But no matter what you do, please do yourself the greatest of favors and buy a nice digital scale and weigh that flour. This recipe is really good and you should have the best!

Excellent! I can see making miniatures for mini hamburgers, but a full sized bun has enough density to support a 1/3 lb hamburger.  I'd love to try with sesame seeds next time.  I will definitely make these again.
Update: I made this dough in my Zojirushi breadmaker ... so easy, and just as good.  Made them a little larger and flattened a little more .. perfect hamburger buns.  As another reviewer pointed out, humidity can slightly affect the ratio of water to flour, and there's a little bit of a learning curve in recognizing when the dough is just right.  But really, it's not too difficult so do try this recipe for buns.

Oh, I love this recipe!  Made a full batch and came out with 8 (2oz) hotdog buns, 6 (3oz) hamburger buns; and 9 extra ounces which I rolled into a 8" circle, spread with butter, and then cut into wedges for 8 crescent rolls.  I proofed yeast using 1 tsp of sugar and 2 T of warm water the simply warmed remaining water, milk and butter to room temp over medium heat. Make in KA using onlt 5 cups of flour to begin with, then added a little more to get workable dough.  Let KA knead for a good 7 minutes.  Haven't tried the hamb buns yet, but the hotdog buns were fantastic with brauts and a quick sample of the *crescent rolls* yielded a lovely nice soft fluffy rolls.  One batch of this recipe gives me enough for 3 meals - I *love* things like that!  TY so much.  Oh - note to self:  when baking, cooked at 375 for around 15" (all 3 at different times).  I did htdg buns first, then ham buns, then rolls.

Really good, easy, and a nice change.  I found them a little heavy though, and it only made 8 normal-sized buns for me.

I made these last night for the first time and got great reviews. The only thing I might change is save the 1/2 cup of flour for kneading. I kneaded mine until the dough was elastic and smooth like my bread dough I make, which is about 4 mins or so. I thought the 10 mins. was a little long. They came out great and will use this recipe all the time. I used them for zesty slow cooker barbecue chicken and they were a hit!  Thank you for a great recipe.

Great after making this a few times and tweaking it a bit.  To streamline the process, in step #1 I do not add the water to the saucepan and I only heat it until the butter melts - boiling it is unnecessary.  Then I add the water.  Otherwise you are sitting around wasting time waiting for the mixture to become lukewarm.  I probably had to add another 1/2-1 cup of flour as I kneaded the dough (it is humid where I live, so my flour was not quite as dry as it usually is).  After shaping the buns, I let them sit about 35-40 minutes until they had risen some.  20 minutes is not quite long enough.  Skipped the egg wash and didn't feel like the buns needed it.

So let me first say that if you were to ONLY eat them the first day you make them, it would be a 5 star recipe! However, the very next day, the rolls were totally dried out, almost inedible, and would be a 1 star recipe. 
I make bread and rolls all the time, and I know not all homemade breads dry out so quickly.
So, make these if you want to eat them right away, because they are delightful! I had NO trouble with the dough rising (maybe people weren't proofing correctly?), and the texture was not dense at all. They were light inside, but had enough texture to withstand holding in both hands like you do for a burger/sandwich and not getting squashed.  The egg wash looked fabulous. I sprinkled sesame seeds on after the wash and it looked amazing.
I would recommend refrigerating half of the dough before the second rise if you plan on having them another day, and baking them fresh right before eating.
Note: I halved the recipe, and got 8 large buns. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, letting my bread machine do the work, and baking for 20min.

Great hamburger rolls, even better than the recipe I got from king arthur flour. I used potato water in place of regular water since I hear it helps with the texture of bread, I also used half an half in place of the milk. Finally I subbed some of the all purpose flour for whole wheat and bread flour. Perfection thank you. Ill be reviewing this recipe on my blog decupcakecriminal.blogspot.com

It was ok... it's edible but wasn't great.  It was way too dense for a hamburger bun, I'm looking for something light and fluffy and perhaps a bit buttery for my hamburgers.  I may try altering the recipe to use less flour and more butter next time.

I made these tonight to put my sloppy joes on. I thought they tasted pretty good. They were tender, but a little more dense than what I like for hamburger buns. I'm definately going to make them again but I will use them for brat buns! This recipe will be awesome for that. I will also use it for pizza crust next time I make homemade pizza.

I had the same issues that most others did.  The dough was wonderful and light, but the buns were not.  HARD on the outside, but soft on the inside.  Also, they didn't get quite as big as I wanted.....more like mini-bun size.  Won't make these again.

These are scrumptious! I followed the directions exactly to see what the baseline was. The addendums I would add would be for clarity: use rapid-rise yeast (due to mixing it with the flour), and the temp of the wet mixture should be between 115-120 degrees. I made them into brat buns, and next time I would make them bigger, forming only 9 - 10 chubby buns.

These are really good. I use all whole wheat flour, make the dough let it rise until doubled, shape into 12 good size buns, let them rise about 25 minutes and bake. They are a staple in my house being made at least once a week.

First time I made these, I measured instead of weighed the flour...5 1/2 cups precisely.  Second time I weighed the flour instead and got a much lighter, much less dense bun, which we vastly preferred.  I would say, too, that 'larger than a golf ball' might be a bit small.  I pulled the dough the size of small lemons.   I was looking for a bun that wasn't huge and fat in the middle,too,  so I let them sit for 5 minutes and THEN flattened them.  Seriously flattened them...they WILL rise again in the oven. That way, they didn't get fat and overly doughy in the center.   I also added dried onion to the dough and used garlic salt in place of regular salt.  Also, be sure and brush the entire bun with the egg/water mixture if you want the entire bun to have that lovely, shiny finish.

For those of you who say your buns were dense and tough, is it possible that your liquid was too hot and you accidentally killed the yeast?  If you are using a bread machine, just warm your liquids in the microwave SLIGHTLY, then add your yeast after the flour.  Just a helpful hint.

These rolls are excellent. I did adjust the recipe/preperation the second time around. They were somewhat overly dense the first time when I followed the recipe exactly. I reduced the flour to 5 cups and mixed for 3 minutes on a higher speed in my stand mixer with the bread hook. They were lighter and fluffier but with the same great taste, I will continue with these modifications from now on.

These were ok; I almost followed the recipe to a T, except I realized I'd forgot the salt. I scaled it for 18 buns, but I didn't use all the flour it stated to use, about a cup and half less, actually. I was afraid it would get to dry; the consistency I had was soft and pliable, just a tiny tad "wet." But it was not sticky. However, mine came out a bit heavy; I know that homemade tend to be denser than store, but I think these were a bit too much. Not sure if losing the salt messed it up, but I've done that in bread recipes with no prbs, so? Any ways will try once more, since it is so highly reviewed. Any ideas on what I did wrong, wouldn't mind hearing in future comments. Thanks!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY - every ingredient, every step (except the second rise took about 40 minutes not 20, phone call from mom). By following the directions I created light, fluffy hamburger buns. They were, however, pretty bland in my opinion. I suppose when you are adding burgers and all the condiments, you don't need a very flavorful roll, but for me, who likes plain burgers (bun-burger-bun). So, a good option if you aren't very confident in your bread making or recipe tweaking skills, but not amazing.

Absolutely delicious. Made exactly as written using kitchenaid bread hook and were fantastic. Would be good with sesame seeds on top.

I halved the recipe since we're a small family. The only change I made to the ingredients was to split the flour between all purpose and whole wheat. I didn't have time to boil then cool down my milk/water, so I added a thermometer to the pot. As soon as the temp was at 110, I added to my bread machine. I then added the ingredients in the order my machine instructions say to. Can't wait to make these again!

These were extremely dense, like heavy pancakes.  I would never use them for a hamburger-- I wouldn't even be able to bite through the whole thing!  Taste was fine, but we will be eating these rolls for breakfast rather than using them for burgers.

These were great! I didn't find them to be dense at all. I used half whole wheat flour and used my bread machine to make the dough. I only made half the batch and got 8 decent sized buns out of it.

These are fabulous - if you want a dense almost baguette type of bread.  They were a bit heavy.  However, I will definitely use again but more for when I want a dense almost french bread tasting roll.  The taste was superb.  THe buns do hold up well.  No amount of ketchup will make them fall apart!

***Made these again today.  Few tips - these make fabulous pig in the blankets.  I used bread flour and that took care of my density issue.  Also, if you knead by hand, use less flour to begin with since you are constantly adding flour to keep it from sticking.  Your total amount of flour should not exceed the 5 to 5.5 cups.  I think this is why my first batch was so dense.  Thank you for this great tasting bread.

We thought this would make excellent BREAD!  It was way too dense for a hamburger bun.  It's so hard that with every bite, the burger would get squashed and break apart, making it very messy eating.  Very tasty bread though!

After reading reviews and looking at several recipes, I decided to try these.  I bake almost all my bread, rarely buy any, just hadn't tried hamburger buns yet.  I hate to give poor reviews but I was so disappointed.  The first batch were too dense, more like a hearty roll for hoagies, but not right for hamburgers.  So I thought I must have messed up and tried again, let them rise longer, but still just not hamburger bun texture or taste.

Ugh. Really dense and yeasty-tasting.That much flour made a stiff dough that only rose after I added about another 3/4 cup milk. Before that there wasn't even enough liquid to disolve the yeast. It was dotting the dough like grains of sand, not raising at all. If I were to make this in the future, and I use the word 'if' very loosely, I would disolve the yeast directly in the milk after it has cooled. And instead add the salt to -some- of the flour, and proceed very carefully in adding it. I'm not sure why this has so many sparkling reviews. As written, it did not turn out well for me! Sorry.

These were fantastic!  Once I saw that the author of the recipe was from Missoula, Montana (GO GRIZ!) I knew it would be a winner, and WERE THEY EVER!  I substituted 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and they were still fantastic. The dough was not sticky at all was was very easy to shape into buns.  I topped some of mine with sesame seeds and some with poppy seeds.  This will be my "go-to" recipe to make hamburger buns!  Thanks for sharing!

I don't think I will ever buy hamburger buns from the store again. These were so good and I thought had plenty of taste. I mean how much taste does a hamburger bun even have. But these were so good, in the morning Im having these with eggs and sausage. I had to go somewhere so mine rose in a bowl for about 2 1/2 hrs. and then when I went to put them in the oven I forgot to add the egg yolk and water part. Mine cooked for 10 mins and then I took them out and spread some butter and grated parmesan cheese, put them back in the oven for 5 more mins. turned out beautiful.

These were ok. I used whole wheat flour and made the dough in the bread machine. I added just a tad more yeast because of all the reviews claiming these are really dense. After I'd shaped them, I put them aside to rise for 20 minutes per the recipe. Nothing happened. So I left them. For like 3 HOURS. They didn't rise much. Definitely didn't "double" in size. Also, they were really small for burger buns. Next time I will probably try to get 8 or 9 buns instead of 12. I don't know what to do about denseness.. they tasted really good though. Just not the texture of storebought, which I guess isn't necessarily a bad thing. :) Thanks for posting!

These were so easy to make and turned out delicious! They do make a slightly more dense bun, but not what I would consider too heavy. I used my KitchenAid to knead the dough and only did so for about 6 minutes. Next time I'll knead it for a little less to see if it yields a lighter bun. The taste was fabulous and I'll never go back to store bought again!

I used 3 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 2 c all purpose.  These turned out beautiful, and really do hold up very nicely to a piled high burger w/ all the fixins.  I baked in the oven for the entire 10 minutes after switching the racks.  I'm freezing the leftover buns, we'll see how that goes!

Maybe I messed these up but they did not turn out at all.  I'm usually pretty good with breads and I followed the recipe exactly,and they turned out very heavy.    I served them at a barbecue complete with beer so you can imagine the full tummies after dinner!  I won't be making these again, just too heavy of a bread for hamburger buns.  They also had a very bland taste, if you do try these I would suggest adding some herbs or spices to the top atleast to give them a little flavor.

Five stars for easiness, but only three for flavor.  I thought they were okay - a bit too dense for me.  I think they raised too fast and that's why they didn't have a fluffiness to them.

I've made these about a thousand times and they always come out really tasty.  I've used the dough to make rolls, garlic knots, and a big loaf of garlic bread.  People rave over them and can't believe they are homemade!

I obviously didn't do something right as my buns didn't rise properly.  Next time I'll make sure to get exact measurements as I thought it was a bit tasteless.  

I'll be trying again.  For now, a five for my mistakes.

Made these for the first time today and they are outstanding. They were the only rolls that can stand up to a hamburger and not fall apart before you finish. I will make these again and again.

These were so good. I used my bread machine, set on the dough cycle, to make these. I halved the recipe to make 6 hamburger buns. The only problem was using half an egg. I beat the egg in a measuring cup and poured half in the machine and used the rest to brush on buns after the 30 min rise. Can't wait to make these again. UPDATE! I went to make these again and actually read the recipe instead of dumping everything in the bread machine. Realized that the egg was intended for egg wash and not to be added to the recipe. Well the buns were so good the way I made them the first time.....I added half the egg again this time. I don't know if that made any difference or not, but they were still amazing.

I am allergic to eggs so I like this recipe because there are no eggs actually in it.

I've been making bread for my family for about 20 years now, but never tried making my own buns.  I made this recipe for our 4th of July dinner (sloppy joes) and the texture was exactly what I was looking for.

It didn't have much flavor, about what you would get from pre-packaged buns bought in the store, but I think if I double the yeast & salt for the next batch that should do the trick.

The instructions are a bit confusing for the inexperienced baker. For those having trouble, you don't just dump 6 cups of flour in a bowl and pour the yeast in.  You have to start with HALF the flour the recipe calls for, add your liquids, then add your flour 1/2 cup at a time until the dough can be handled easily, usually about 4 to 5 cups.  Then work in the rest !!as needed!! on the board as you knead it.  This is called "Board Flour".  

Remember that on humid days your bread will need more flour, while on dry day's it will need less.  This is where experience comes in handy.

I made these for my chicken burgers and my boys LOVED them.  The only thing different I will do next time is rehydrate the yeast.  I made them according to the directions and I have much better luck when I add the yeast to the liquid then to the dry mixture.  Perfect recipe!

Excellent!  So easy, my six year old did a lot of the work including the kneeding.  We have doen much less with bread since becoming a non-processed food family.  We make our own bread which is good, but is heavy and not like sandwich bread you get at the store.  This recipe makes the best hamburger buns I have ever tasted and a poud six year old to boot!

I thought these were really good, mine did turn out a little dense but I'm pretty sure I used too much flour and wish I would have read more of the reviews warning of this. Oh well, live and learn!

I did not care for this recipe. Way to much flour.  Not worth the trouble.

Great Hamburger buns.  I did half the work in my bread maker.  I microwaved the milk and water for a minute each and then added the rest of the ingredients as listed.  After the second kneading of the machine, I removed the dough and placed it in a well greased bowl.  The dough was very sticky so I added another 1/4 cup flour.  I also used unhbleached bread flour instead.  I rolled the dough into balls about twice the size of a golf ball and still came out with 16 buns.  I did not do any wash on the buns.  They were light and fluffy and held the hamburger with all the fixings without any problems.  The taste was nice and light.  My husband really liked them too and said I should always make these.  Thank you for the recipe, it sure is a keeper and I will share with my daughter.

I found these buns to be a little heavy.  I will say I dumped it all into a bread maker and didn't follow the directions about boiling the milk though, so it may be better if you follow all the directions properly.

These buns are great! They are dense enough to hold up to a messy pulled pork sandwich without falling apart. Yet they don't taste too dense or heavy. I altered the recipe slightly. I proofed the yeast in my mixing bowl using 1/4 cup of water and 1 tsp sugar. I boiled the remaining water, sugar and milk while the yeast was proofing. Once it cooled enough, I added the milk mixture to the yeast. I then added the flour just until the dough didn't look 'wet' anymore (about 4-4.5 cups). After baking, I covered the buns with a damp dish cloth to keep them soft (I don't like crusty hamburger buns). Overall, a great recipe!

These buns were amazing! I am not a bread maker, every time I attempt to make bread it just does not turn out. I made these buns today and they turned out very nicely. I am so proud of my little buns!!!!

Do you like the hamburger buns offered in the bar of your favorite special occasion restaurant? You know, the kind of burger that costs $12, before the side of fries? TRY THIS RECIPE!!! If kneading by hand, you will be looking for a very smooth, silky dough. When I made these, I used the egg wash, but once out of the oven, immediately put them into a clean, open plastic bag, so the crust could lightly steam, and make it a bit softer. I have done this in the past as a professional baker, except there it was on large standing racks with a bag that went over the whole rack! ^_^ I put coarse salt on top of the egg wash, but we enjoy a salty flavor.

I made these for the first time for a 4th of July get together. My brother the "grill master" made the most awesome hamburgers. He is so picky, however, he won't eat store bought buns again. So now every time we grill burgers he insists I make them. I, like other bakers, Topped the buns with onion, sesame seeds and poppy seeds. I also shape some into hot dog buns. We use the left overs for sandwiches. Thank you Belle. This is a wonderful recipe. I have the dough in my bread maker as I write for turkey burgers tonight!

the first try, i made these with whole wheat flour, epic fail!!  second time, i dont think they rose enough, so next time i will bloom the yeast in the wet ingredients, and then add the flour. they were dense, and the crust was crunchy.  someone said they topped them off with steak seasoning great idea!  
next time, i will try the less flour suggestion and see which i like better. and i will also cut it down the 8 buns, we like a BIG burger here.  but these turned out very good!

Delicious. Using a golf sized roll of dough made buns that were good for small burgers. If I am using pre-formed burgers I'll definitely use more dough for each roll. But the bread is good.

Flavor was descent.  Too dense in my opinion and I proofed the yeast before hand.  This was basically a large, ok tasting, dinner roll.

These were easy to make and much better than store bought buns. I topped the buns with sesame seeds but it still felt like the bread was missing something in the flavor department.

These were good. I followed the instructions excatly as they were written. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because I was a little disappointed with the crunch crust. I like soft rolls instead of crunchy crust.

Excellent flavor and easy to make! I'm usually not very successful when it comes to yeast breads, but this one turned out perfectly. I added sesame seeds, granulated onion and garlic and a pinch of kosher salt to the tops of each bun and WOW! An explosion of flavor!

Today I am making these for the third time.  The first time I used the entire amount of flour and they were too dense. I reduced the amount by a cup last time and they were wonderful!  I am reducing the amount again by another half cup today.  I want them light but firm enough for a 1/3 pound burger with trimmings.  They freeze and reheat nicely.

I halved this recipe for my bread machine (anything over 4 cups of flour is way too much for it to handle) and because I was in a hurry I didn't read the entire directions so the egg yolk went into my dough instead of on top but it still resulted in 9 pretty big hamburger buns that were very soft inside. The outside of the buns were a bit harder than I wanted to so brushed them with butter when they came out of the oven and they softened as they set. Thanks for sharing, these will be great with our cheeseburgers tonight!

I make bread all the time, so I am not a novice. This was so dense it swallowed my burgers!! Seriously disappointing. The only reason I am giving it three stars is because it was still good bread, but not a good bun. I read the reviews, and I know how it turns out dense, but I used less flour than the recipe called for, about a cup less. I did sub in 1 cup of wheat flour so maybe that changed things. When I am eating a hamburger I would like the meat to be the star, not the bread. So, overall, great bread, bad bun. This is my second bun recipe, I will keep looking, sorry!!

Delicious! I'm at high-altitude and these turned out soft and buttery with no alteration. I used a bread machine on the dough setting to mix the dough, then shaped, let them have a final rise, and popped them in the oven. Great, easy recipe!

Amazing! First time I've ever made my own bread and they were fantastic. It was very cold here so the first attempt following recipe exactly using a stand mixer, and it was an epic failure. Second time around I proofed the yeast in the 1 cup of water (100-110 degrees),let the dough rise by the heater, and kneaded by hand. They were amazing. I used sesame seeds and Kosher salt for the tops. Another helpful tip, I added the liquid to 4 1/2 cups of flour and and slowly added last cup to achieve desired feel. You won't always use all of the flour. Great easy recipe. I will definitely use again and again

Perfect! My husband loved them. I used this recipe to make 4 hamburger and 4 large hotdog/hoagie buns. I've tried to make hotdog buns in the past without success but theses were great and this is now my go to recipe. I followed the recipe exactly but used a stand mixer just for mixing and then kneaded by hand for 10 minutes. I think I will make ahead and freeze so I always have some on hand

This is my first review ever but, I had to agree with some of the other reviews. The buns themselves were tasty and my family really enjoyed them however the recipe needs modification. I am not a baker so I cannot discount that maybe I made some sort of mistake but I measured precisely and followed the directions exactly (except for proofing the yeast…….not being a baker I honestly thought it was “understood” that I was always supposed to proof the yeast) When adding the liquid to the flour, I knew within seconds that there needed to be more liquid. I had to add more warm water to the mixture just to get it to come together.  After finally getting good dough, everything turned out fine and the buns were great. They were a little dense, but I needed a good hearty bun to hold on to my Carolina chicken barbeque and slaw sandwiches so it worked out in my favor.

These rolls are very, very easy and tasty--a great combination.  I like my buns a bit larger, so I made 8 buns instead.  This is my go-to recipe in the future.

Interesting.  I will say first that I enjoyed them and they weren't all that hard to make, and I will make again.  The changes I would make though, depending on what you plan to put on it, I would definitely make them larger than a little larger than a golf ball.  By doing it as written, I had 21 buns that werent all that big. This was okay for the shredded bbq chicken I was putting on it.  But if I were making them for hamburgers, I would want a little larger although it probably wouldnt hurt for us to cut back on the size of our hamburgers either.  I mixed the yeast with the wet stuff first.  I had measured out the flour but didn't use it all.  The extra I used to knead it out on the counter.  I have a convection oven, and although I did switch the rack placement as instructed with the first batch, I don't think it was necessary.  And even though my convection automatically adjusts the temperature, I had my first batch in a little too long and they are sort of hard on top, but not bad.  So the 2nd batch, I didn't switch them and they were probably barely 10 minutes, but again, they werent the biggest things in the world either.  All in all, I enjoyed them.  The second batch especially.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe. Despite using oil in place of butter and half whole wheat flour, these were still nice and soft and fluffy. The dough is easy to work with -- not sticky. Increased the salt by half a tsp because 1 1/2 tsp salt seemed low for 5 1/2 cups of flour. Glad I did, and I might add another 1/4 tsp next time.

I used the custom version that was modified for a bread machine & these were great. I halved the recipe and got 6 HUGE buns. So I would say the full recipe would make at least 16 large buns. Great recipe!

This bread had the best ratio of dry to wet that i didn't need to add any flour to the table to knead! It was the best feeling bread I have ever used. Unfortunately, i must have done something wrong because my bread came out very dense and kind of tasteless, yet almost salty. It has great potential for being amazing and I will try this again! :D Thanks for the recipe.

These are terrific for a juicy burger and really hold up well to lots of toppings.  Great for sloppy Joes too or a pulled pork bbq sandwich.  I did alter this just a bit and added 2 TBS of shortening along with the butter.  I used 3 cups bread flour and the rest all purpose and added a tsp of diastatic malt powder to soften and keep them fresher (made early in the AM for the evening).  Nice touch on the milk and I think that's what makes these richer and more robust.  These are not your fluffy buns that you buy out of a plastic bag and so reviewers here seem surprised that they are a bit heartier.  Mine came up big and soft and I brushed the tops with the egg and added sea salt, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, hydrated garlic flakes (just a touch) and a pinch of fennel seed.  Really good, really easy and instructions are perfect.  BTW, you DO NOT have to add the yeast to any liquid in order for the yeast to activate and ferment.  Yeast does just fine on it's own without growing in a warm liquid.  I use Red Star, but a rapid rise or instant will also work here.

I made these to go with some sloppy joes since I didn't have any hamburger buns and didn't want to go buy any.  They turned out wonderfully!  My husband was skeptical when I said I was making some buns but he loved them!  He even said that we should use these from now on instead of buying any.  I didn't do the egg yolk on mine, but next time I definately will.  I loved these and they were super easy to do!

As other reviewers noted, these are too dense for hamburger rolls.  I even tried a second rise before forming into rolls.  That didn't help.  I used all of the 5-1/2 cups flour and they were still pretty sticky.  Tried melted butter on top for half the batch and not the rest.  They were slightly softer.  I gave it 4 stars, because as a dinner roll, they're pretty good.

My only issue with these was that the hamburber buns came out round like a baseball, even after falttening them pretty well.  It could have been that my dough wasn't moist enough.  The kids didn't like how the egg wash made the rolls "crusty", but I loved it!

I did like the taste of these and they were soft but even using a bit less flour as some had noted, they were still slightly dense and not quite soft, fluffy burger rolls. I will keep for now but will try a few others as well.

These were fabulous!  I skipped the stove top steps and just dumped everything into the bread machine.  Worked great!  I added some sesame seeds on top for a little extra flavour.  The texture was perfect, although I added a little water as it was mixing.  (No bread recipe will be perfect in terms of moisture as all areas have different humidity.)  A fabulous recipe, one that I will make over and over!

Love, love, love this recipe.  It is soooo hard to find products without HFCS* (high fructose corn syrup).  So I'm always on the lookout for great recipes.  I will NEVER buy hamburger buns again.  My family loved them.   *(My 6 year old was diagnosed with Type 1 so I'm very conscious of the effects of HFCS on his numbers.  As a family we just avoid it whenever possible.)

Excellent rolls! Mine didn't puff up quite like the picture, but I did try to flatten them out quite a bit. I suspect if I'd left them more like golfballs I would have rounder rolls. At any rate, I used around 4 cups of flour and folded my first rise 3 times every 20 minutes, with a total rise time of 1 hr 20 minutes. The folding helps the yeast to gluten to fully develop resulting in a finer crumb and lighter rolls. Also, I followed the suggestion of another and used buttermilk instead. Finally, I completely forgot to add in the butter until the dough was formed so I kneaded it in. It still worked out fine! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

The dough was much too DENSE. I knew as soon as I had finished mixing the ingredients that something was wrong. Almost impossible to knead- I thought it was going to tear up my stand mixer. I finished them up anyway. The outside was hard, the inside chewy, dense, and tasteless.

These buns came out okay...I was not impressed with the crumb, it seemed a bit dense to me.  Flavor was okay, pretty much like any bread just made into the hamburger bun shape. Good, but I'll keep looking.  :)

AWESOME Recipe!  Made it in my much loved (and used) bread machine on the dough cycle using a technique I picked up from my favorite bread recipe.  Let the water sugar (added 1 more tbsp sugar) and yeast sit in the bread machine for 10 minutes to proof the yeast.  Then  add the flour (switching 1 cup to whole wheat), butter, milk and salt. I was very leary of the amount of flour needed, so I only put 4 1/2 cups at first.  I did end up using the extra cup.  They rise very well and have an incredible texture.  They made my husband's already awesome burgers absolutely heavenly!!!!!  Bravo!

Tried this recipe yesterday and was glad I found it. I read through the reviews and didn't make any changes except cut back just a little on the sugar. I divided the dough up into 8 pieces and made hoagie rolls for left over meatloaf sandwiches. The flavor and texture was fantastic! It is an old cliche on AR but "I'll never buy buns or rolls again" but It is true for me and way cheaper too.

This is an easy and tasty recipe. My goal is to give my family the healthiest and freshest products possible....homemade burger buns used to be out of reach....no longer. These buns are soft yet sturdy enough for even sloppy joes...I highly recommend Belles Hamburger Buns...Enjoy!

These are awesome!  Probably the easiest yeast type bread i've ever made.  I wanted something to use for buns for Mexican Hamburgers (you know the rectangular burgers), and these worked out great!  I didn't want wonderbread fluff; i wanted a hearty tasty bread, and i got it.  I will use this recipe again for bistro sandwiches and hearty dinner rolls.  I'm also very tempted to try a larger version for bread bowls.  This bread is the perfect consistency with a nice crispy outside.

I've made these buns several times now and they always turn out soft and light.  I use 2 cups of whole wheat flour because that's my preference and don't move the baking pan between shelves, just bake it on a middle shelf for 18-20 minutes.  Like many other reviewers, I'm not comfortable with the dough conditioners and other ingredients in many store bought buns.  These are easy enough that I make them regularly.  I normally get more than 12 buns out of mine, so I have plenty to freeze.  These are surprisingly light and fluffy, even with part whole wheat flour.  And still soft the second day.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a very easy recipe & the results were wonderful.  I had to add a little more flour (maybe about 1/4 c.)  We eat homemade bread all the time, so we're used to a denser texture, but these were actually fluffy.  Loved 'em!!

Awesome! I have made these two days in a row. My family says I am NOT to buy buns again! I made hamburger and hot dog buns last night, served jalapeno cheese deer sausage with the hot dog buns. Made hamburger buns and hoagie buns tonight and served chicken salad. Will make these again and again. Thanks. (I used my bread machine dough cycle).

I give this 4 stars for the simplicity and ease of the recipe, which is convenient enough to throw together a couple hours before dinner when you decide that you're too lazy to drive 5 minutes to the grocery store just for buns (hem, hem). The buns also turn out quite beautifully, given that you shape them properly and use the egg wash. Without some sort of topping or flavoring mixed into the dough (onion powder in the dough would be nice), however, they can tend to be a little bland. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. I topped some of mine with sesame seeds and the rest with caramelized onions. These were definitely more dense than store-bought buns, but that didn't bother me one bit. In fact, I like them better for it! All in all, these were very, very good, and would only take a little onion powder or other flavoring in the dough to make them perfect.

First time they came out great. I used only 5 cups of flour and kneaded by hand. Topped with sesame seeds and they look almost store bought, but taste better.

Very good directions in the recipe - thanks for the yeast reminder (I killed it in another recipe).  They tasted great - took these and store bought ones to eat with sloppy joes at our small group and no one even opened the store bought ones!!

This recipe is phenomenal! I've made it a handful of times and had no problems. I've also made these rolls with whole wheat flour and they are delicious that way, too. Sometimes I take the suggestion of a reviewer and wrap the dough around scrambled eggs, sausage and cheese (before the last proof) to make a nice breakfast sandwich. Delicious!

I'm usually note very good with the yeast dough, but these came out great. I made a half-portion with rapid-rise yeast, which was actually few months past its "best" date. The recipe might be actually meant for this kind of yeast - actuve dry usually needs "proofing", but rapid-rise just gets mixed with the flour and then the wet ingredients are added. Instead of bringing the liquids to boil and waiting for them to cool, I warmed it up in the microwave until it reached 125 F (120-130 F is recommended for rapid-rise yeast).

Then I started the dough in the food processor with about 1 3/4 cups flour (for 6 buns). Processed the dough until it came together and processor started to struggle and then kneaded by hand 5 min. tops, adding only as much flour as needed. I probably ended up using only about 2 1/4 cups of flour instead of suggested 2 3/4.

Since I had only one pan, I simply baked the buns for 15 min. on the middle rack. The crust was a bit too tough when they came out of the oven, but I covered the rolls with a clean dish towel for about 20 min. (checking periodically) while they were cooling on the rack. This softened the crust just perfectly and they had a very nice texture inside and out. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

OK- If I knew that hamburger rolls that were homemade were this easy and SO good- I would have made them sooner!  Thank you for a great recipe!!!! I placed all the ingredients into my bread machine (dough cycle) and then formed by hand. My husband loved these with just butter!  I had extra dough since we only needed 8 rolls so I placed the dough in a bread pan and topped with Marjoram, Rosemary, Garlic Salt and the Egg Wash- baked for 25 minutes.
THANK YOU CLOUDZBABE, these rolls rock!

Maybe I should wait until I've actually tried this with a hamburger, but I've just tried one of the mini rolls alone and it's soo good.  I used only 5 cups of flour (2/5 whole wheat).  I also added a teaspoon of onion powder to the dough and then sprikled dill weed, sesame seeds, and onion powder on top.  So good.

I have made these several times and I don't change a thing.  I follow the recipe exactly using my stand mixer and the buns come out light and fluffy with a wonderful texture.  I sprinkle poppy seeds on the top.  My family loves them.

Not too bad, not too good.  

Update:  I made these buns ahead of time and only tasted one by itself before I made my first comment.  After having garden burgers with them, I'm changing my rating from 3 to 4 stars.  These are actually great buns!  I do think I may have overworked the dough a little, which messes with the texture a bit.  Next time I'll set my timer.

I wish I could agree with everyone else on this recipe but based on my results, I can not.  I found the buns heavy and tough.  I used a breadmaker to mix the dough and also let it rise in it so that may have been the problem.  I would suggest that when you go to press the balls down that you keep in mind (again, from my experience) that the dough will not expand much but will rise, so make sure you flatten them well.

These were very good. I also substituted bread flour for AP flour. The only problem I had was that they stuck to the parchment paper. Next time I will try just greasing a cookie sheet. Will definitely make again.

These were pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly but the buns came out flat.  I ended up feeding a houseful of teenagers and they all said they were delicious.  I will try again for puffier buns.

I just gave a 4 star rating to avoid changing the overall rating because I didn't make hamburger buns! I used this recipe as a base for cinnamon roll bread. I followed the recipe (except for adding an extra tsp. of sugar)up to where you divide the dough and instead i split the dough in 2 rolled the dough about 3/4 inch thick, spread plenty of melted butter on it and then sprinkled generously with cinnamon-sugar, rolled it up and put it in a bread pan lined with parchment. I baked it at 350f for around 45 mins. Once it came out of the oven I lightly sprayed it with oil and water, covered it in cinnamon-sugar and let cool completely. Makes 2 large loaves. Thanks!

These were okay but very heavy. I'm a pretty experience bread baker and just felt the crumb and texture to be a little dense for me. Thank you, though!

I had a lot of fun making these and was very excited to use them for my chicken sandwiches.  They were beautiful to look at but a little too hard and chewy for my taste.  I might try to make them again and do as another reviewer suggested and brush them with milk instead of the egg yolk to see if that makes them softer.

The recipe in of it's self was wonderful. I got the exact results I wanted. Nice fluffy hamburger buns. The only down side was the next day the left over went stale fast. So yes I recommend this, just be sure to eat them all on the day they are made.

These Buns was just the right texture with a very nice flavor. Not just for hamburger. My hubby like them as well. you can add sesame seeds, mince onion, or garlic butter on them. or you can go the sweet route with honey or jam with or without butter yum! I will make these again. thanks for sharing.

Made them today and they turned out fabulous. I only used 4 1/2 cups flour. After reading a few reviews I decided to only do half in the egg wash as there was some concern about them being too crispy. I actually found my egg wash ones to be softer.

These were so good! I made them because I didn't have any hamburger buns on hand. I only need 3 so I figured I would just freeze the rest when they cooled. Needless to say they never made it to the freezer. My family snacking on them. I did add some sesame seeds to the top of these and kneaded the dough through 2 risings in my bread machine. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will never buy store bought hamburger buns again. This is a keeper!

These were alright if you are looking for a dinner roll, but didn't work out for our veggie burgers.  They turned out to be too dense and we ate them with butter instead!

I made this recipe this morning, didn't have any milk, so I subbed prepared nonfat milk powder, while kneading the dough seemed really dry and strange, so I added about a Tb of warm water which loosened it up a bit, it ended up rising nicely, and my sister said they were delicious.

A good roll recipe, but definitely NOT buns. I made these to go with sloppy joes, so the thicker consistency was ok. However, I'll keep looking for a soft, airy bun recipe.

It was good. I only need two buns so I made the rest into a loaf. I think it was too much for one loaf so it was very dense.

Excellent taste and texture.  Simple, inexpensive ingredients.  Holds its shape well when fully loaded with the hamburger patty, etc.  The egg wash adds a eye-appealing gleam to the buns.  I eliminated a few steps by using my stand mixer and dough hook with bread machine yeast.  I microwaved the milk/water mixture to warm and then proceeded as though using the bread machine - liquid, butter, flour, salt, sugar, yeast.  
I substitued one cup of whole wheat flour for one cup of all purpose.  This recipe probably costs less than $2.00 to make at home and turns out the most delicious hamburger buns you've ever tasted.  You'll amaze and delight your friends at your next BBQ...just as I intend to do. :)

I really like these rolls.  I have a hard time flattening them as much as I would like for a sandwich bun, but that is probably my error.  They are still very yummy.    I've made these 3 times and each time I've halved the recipe. With a halved recipe, I had to use a little more than the 2-3/4 cups flour (no more the 1/2 cup more, but I don' t really know because I added a little at a time until the dough picked up the pool on the bottom of the bowl).  With each halved recipe, I still end up with 12 smallish buns (not too small, though!).  These are super fast and super easy and I know I will continue to use this recipe. There are some rolls in the oven as I type :)

Ok, I messed these up.  I read through the recipe but when I was mixing the dough, I added the egg yolk.  I finished them anyway, and they have a fantastic texture - they're not too doughy or too airy.  But, they are super-duper bland, and except for messing up with the egg, I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm going to make them again, because I really liked this recipe.  I'll edit my review then, to make sure that it was me who made them bland!

I have to agree that there is way too much flour called for in this recipe.  They came out very thick and heavy like biscuits rather than buns.  They would make good dinner biscuits, but I would not make these again as hamburger buns.

These were really good.  Mine rose well the first time but not much after I divided the dough into buns.  Maybe it's just because I'm a novice bread maker but this recipe isn't exactly fool proof.  As other reviewers have said it's a good idea to mix the flour in slowly until the dough is the right consistency.

Made these exactly as recipe stated and they were perfect. Had them with hamburgers tonight and will use the rest on pulled pork tomorrow. Thanks for this recipe- it will now totally be my go-to bun recipe.
And as a side note, I rarely like anything enough to review it. These are the truth as far as hamburger buns are concerned.

i made these with whole wheat, rye, honey, added gluten and extra yeast (because of the whole wheat).  i didnt bother with the wash and i didnt use quite as much flour as the recipe calls for, they came out wonderfully light and tender.  my children had no complaints, two days late we have two left and they are Still tender/ not stale. good recipe.

Just made these wonderful little buns!  Although I have baked a lot of bread, I've never done buns.  They were easy to make and very tasty.  I loved the texture.  They are a little denser than store bought buns but I'm making my own because I hate the ones in the store!  Perfect and will use again and again.  I did let the yeast bloom in the lukewarm milk/water mixture instead of putting it in the flour.  I also started with less flour and added as needed. I think this helped keep them from getting 'dense'.

Tasted great. Didn't think they were dense. I did use half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour. I scaled the dough to 3 1/2 ounces and it made 13 buns. They were perfect for sloppy joes. If I use this recipe for actual hamburgers (boca patties), I would probably scale them to 4 1/2 ounces. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Incredibly good dough recipe. I've taken this and used it a number of ways (smaller rolls/twists are a great replacement for the canned biscuits). Simply delicious.

This is the ONLY homemade bread item I've made that my husband really likes.  (Probably because I make everything with whole grain flour.)  I even make these the "lazy" way, and they turn out great.  I measure all the ingredients by weight with my kitchen scale in a large bowl- no measuring cups to wash!  Then I mix/knead it just for a minute.  I cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise for about 2 hours on the counter.  Then I use an oiled ice cream scoop to form the rolls on the pan.  Bake for 15 min, and done!  They are so yummy!  I think next time I make bread, I will use this recipe and just throw it in a loaf pan!

My buns only rose about half way, really not
sure where I went wrong, as I followed recipe exactly. Maybe too much flour?
They did have a good flavor but way,way too heavy of a texture.

Amazing! Simple to make, and SO good! 

I didn't have an egg to use on top, so I sprinkle some water on top of them before placing them in the oven, and they turned out beautiful. 

I will definitely be making them again!

These are pretty tasty! I'm not an expert at making yeast breads, so mine turned out a little dense, and I had a heck of a time getting them to rise, but I finally got them to rise enough for baking. next time I know not to add all the flour all at once. Definately a keeper and will make again.

These buns are great!  They came out heavier than I thought but everyone loved them.  The crust was crunchy but the inside was chewy. These buns would also be good for deli style sandwiches. They were real easy to make also.

These were fantastic!  My husband says we will never buy store bought buns again.  I did change one thing that did speed up the prep time some.  I did not boil the milk.  Instead I added it after the rest of the liquid mix has come to a boil.  This brought it to a workable temp right away.  Also, the first raise only took about 50 minutes in a warm oven but I had to let the formed buns raise 30 minutes.  The texture is slightly heavier than store bought but that makes them hold up much better to grilling or toasting. Perfect for a juicy sandwich because the bun does not get soggy. Great recipe LemonLush.  This is a keeper.

Fast easy and very tasty. I ran out of all purpose flour and put 3 cups whole wheat and they still came out fluffy and soft. I put sesame seeds on top and wow do they look good. I tried to make hot dog buns but they were to low and wide instead of raising up as the hamburger buns. Will do again for hamburger buns forsure!!!!! Much cheaper and taster and healther than store bought. Thank you LemonLush!

I made these for the first time on Monday. Great simple recipe.  I didn't make them large enough so we had sliders, but nonetheless they were great.  I used the leftovers to make french toast the next day.

Very soft!  Next time I'll make 15 or 16 buns as they turned out bigger than my burger patties.  Also, they were slightly more well done on the bottom, so I'll take them out at 5 minutes.

If you follow this recipe to a T, you are sure to have delicious, fluffy rolls.  You need to knead the dough long enough and you need to let it rise long enough, to ensure a nice, light, airy roll.  Also, remember not to use too much flour--and let the rolls cool before slicing, unless you plan on consuming them immediately.  Like I said, these are great.  I will never buy store bought again.  Thank you, Belle!  Darthi Ugurlu

What a nice recipe!  I added one cup whole wheat flour and about a T wheat germ.  Followed the rest exactly except I sprinkled sesame seeds on top of the egg wash before baking... they came out perfect!  Made 6 reg buns and 12 sliders.

well the first batch of these did NOT turn out.  I did it exactly as instructed mixing the yeast in with my flour, however, it just didn't rise well.  I also had used 2 cups of Whole Wheat Flour, and 2.5 cups of white.  I left the other cup of white out till seeing if I needed it.  Not wanting to feel defeated I made another batched and saved the other smaller ones as biscuits for soups.
The second time around I waited till the liquid was lukewarm, then added the yeast to it and proofed it first.  Once it was done about 15 min, I then added it to the flour, this time using 1 cup of whole wheat and 3.5cups of White Flour. They don't feel super light, but Im assuming that is from the whole wheat all purpose flour.  Anyway, they resemble hamburger buns better then the first batch and did what it was supposed to which was rise!  Im not sure how they taste yet since they just came out of the oven, but will try them with my hamburgers tonight and then update this one on taste.  Thanks for sharing!

These are the most beautiful buns I've ever seen! The texture was delightful-sturdy but light and airy at the same time.

I did make several modifications. First of all, there is too much flour in this recipe for the amount of liquid. I  used 2 cups of whole wheat and 2.5 cups of bread flour (gives a better rise). I also added 1 T. of vital wheat gluten, which made the rolls pillowy soft.  It is much better to have a wet dough and only add small amounts of flour during the kneading process (I hand-kneaded for almost 10 minutes). JUST enough to keep it from sticking to the counter during kneading. 5.5 cups of flour would result in a very dense dry bread. I also added 1/2 t. more salt and 1 T. more sugar to enhance the flavor a little, and some garlic and onion powder.

Forming the rolls using her golf ball method and then flattening out resulted in gorgeous, perfectly-shaped rolls. And don't skip the egg wash step-it makes such a beautiful shiny top! I sprinkled sesame and poppy seeds on top before baking, then baked about 15 minutes until golden brown. A huge hit with my family. Thanks Belles!

I've made this a few times now and it turns out nicely each time. I no longer buy buns from the store. I just make a batch of these and freeze the extras until they are needed. The only changes that I made were cutting the salt back a bit (to 1 tsp) and making it with 1/2 whole wheat flour and half all-purpose. I leave out the last cup of flour and add it in slowly if needed. Some times I don't need all 5 1/2 cups to get the dough to come together.

Very nice bun. I did proof the yeast in the liquid before I added the dry ingredients but that is the only thing I did different. They held up to sloppy joes so I'm very happy. I'll be making these again. Thanks!

Gourmet!  My family was crowding around the oven in anticipation of these little gems.  Everyone had one with some butter and honey while they were still warm.  Later that night when I made our burgers and we ate the burgers on these, my hubby and I kept saying, "These are the best burgers we've ever had!!".  By the way, I used bread flour because I have a huge bag to use up, and they were deliciously chewy.

One thing I've learned in 45 years of baking bread, the amount of flour required in a recipe depends on the flour.  Some flours require more liquid - you have to go by how the dough feels.

Great recipe  been making breads for 40 years so I did change a couple of things. I used bread flour instead of all purpose as it has gluten. Also added 8 tsp. Of gluten  powder add light texture and preserves well. You can buy box gluten in all grocery stores where they sell flour. You will live the texture. Rule : 4 tsps of gluten per each loaf of bread.

These were good but I must have done something wrong because they had more of a soft pretzel texture than a hamburger bun. Still they worked for hamburgers. My son loved them and ate them by themselves.

I love these!  Super easy to make.  I followed the directions exactly, but added a bit more salt-about a tsp more (the family likes salty).  Everyone was super impressed by the taste and look of these.  They really are better than store bought!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Nothing like the hamburger buns from the grocery store. These are delicious.  I originally made them to go with pulled BBQ chicken. YUM! I used the leftovers to make cold-cut sandwiches with the next day, soooo good!

These are great!  I misread the recipe as I was in a hurry and accidentally added the egg yolk to the flour along with the wet ingredients.  I was really worried they'd be ruined as I had no back up plan...  However, they turned out great!  I made them to use with Rachel Ray's Sloppy Buffalo Joes and they were a hit.  The kids took them with ham, turkey, and havarti in their school lunch, and I am having one for breakfast with peanut butter!

These are great hamburger buns, and recipe is easy to follow. I made them with half wheat flour. My only suggestion is to cut back on the amount of flour. I ended up only using 4 cups, because the first time they were a little dense, still very good, though.

Delicious hamburger bun recipe!  The only change I made was to start with 3.5 cups of flour, once I added the wet ingredients & mixed, this was all I needed.  The buns were light & airy & had amazing taste and were so easy to make!  Store bought buns will be a rarity for me now.  Thanks for the recipe!!

These were okay.  Very attractive, fluffy, and easy to make... just nothing special in terms of flavor.  Bland in my opinion.  They were not dense, but if you are comparing them to packaged hamburger buns, then of course they are!  I rather prefer these to a flimsy packaged bun - they hold up regardless of what you put on them.

Perfect for sandwiches.  Worked very well for Portabella mushroom burgers.  Would make again.  Make them larger, instead of making 12 I would make 6.

Fabulous! I used buttermilk instead of milk. That's the only substitution I made (only because i had a large amount of buttermilk on hand.  Used my bread machine as others have, allowing the warm water sugar and yeast to "fizz" for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then "dumped in" the rest of the ingredients.  This is one fantastic recipe. My husband and I are crazy about these beauties! Definitely a keeper.  Thanks SOooooo much for sharing this great recipe.  DELISH!

I am a 1st time bread maker. I had made biscuits, but no yeast breads. I needed hamburger buns and had some yeast and decided to try making them when I read this recipe. All I can say is WOW! These are great! I actually made bread! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. Looked fantastic and tasted even better. Even passed the hubby test with flying colors, Thanks for turning this scaredy cat into a real baker!

This is a wonderful recipe. I'm a novice baker and I have the tendency of making lots of mistakes when following recipes. Of course that was the case when making this bread, but I still managed to make something really nice. Like other's have mentioned, the texture of the bread is not what I expected, but it was a lot better. I will most def be making these again.

This made excellent, light and fluffy hamburger rolls.  We are veyr excited about this recipe!  I didn't really change it, although I used honey instead of sugar, just because that's what we do.  (Who needs a better reason than that!) Also, some of our flour was homeground wheat, and they were still light and fluffy! We used them with BBQ pulled pork, very saucy, and they held up very well.  This morning we made bread out of the recipe.  Also fab!  I used a breadmaker for this recipe.  I did check it now and again, and it required a bit more flour, probably due to inaccurate measuring on my part.    Thank you infinitely for this recipe!  Delicious!  Five stars!

so amazing! used the bread machine and my husband said these were the BEST gourmet bakery buns he's ever had....he loved them even more when I told them I baked them myself (saving $$$).  so this is my trick: 1 put the yeast, warm water and sugar in the machine and let the yeast fizz for 10 minutes...then add the rest of the ingredients and put on DOUGH setting (for me it's 1.5 hours) then baked at 400 for 10 minutes then swapped oven rack positions and baked another 10 minutes.  ABSOLUTELY the best buns!  I had enough to make 12 decent sized hamburger buns + 2 small loaves of bread. Normally I don't do the egg/water glaze but I did it this time and would definitely recommend it - - just seemed to add a "pretty-ness" to the buns.

Ran out of packaged buns and needed some for burgers.  Everyone liked these.  To me, they just seemed like french bread in a roll form.  I kneaded for 10 minutes and everything.  Mine were not really "light" or "fluffy."  The taste was good, just not my idea of a burger bun.  Like I said, the rest of the family liked them.  Will try again when I have the extra time, thanks.

Nice dough, but too dense for hamburger buns with regular white flour. I wish I had read the July 24/09 about gradually adding the last 2 cups of flour. I knew the dough was too dense when kneading. As is, not suitable for hamburger buns, but good as dinner buns.

I am a rookie when baking breads, this recipe was sooo simple!  I proofed the yeast beforehand like some other reviewers suggested...and also added some garlic powder.  The rolls baked up beautifully!  The only problem I had with these is I should have made the rolls bigger, our burger patties were falling off the edges.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these today when I realized I forgot the buns while shopping. I substituted 2 cups all purpose flour with wheat flour, made the dough in the bread machine and then shaped and baked in the oven. My child doesn't normally like bread, but she asked for more after sampling a bite. Husband loved it too. The conclusions are: 1. These are better than buns bought from the store. 2. This could easily be made as a loaf bread. 3. We're going to use this to make cloverleaf rolls for the holidays.

I and my family thought these were great! The only difference we made was letting the yeast prep in the water/milk first and then adding the flour and salt slowly, a cup at a time until it was a good mix. And I forgot the egg wash. But they were really good - it was nice not to have to rush to the store just because we needed hamburger buns.

I needed a recipe to make buns and need it quick. The name got my attention and it was the recipe to try. I was nervous as I was not so sure if it would come out great. But it was and my kids "inhaled" the buns! Great thanks! And that got me to look into the site of course as I wanted to say thank you.

mmm these were goooooood good. I kept mine in paper bags (the wine bags from the grocery store are awesome) and they were good the next day. I also toasted them in a pan. They are firm enough to hold together with bbq pulled pork and lots o' sauce. I also froze a few rolls and reheated them by thawing on the counter then 20 sec in the microwave, they were still tasty! My only regret is that they weren't very shiny on top, but I've never been able to get that right.

Very good and easy to make.  I baked them a little less then called for but may be because my oven runs hot.  I've made them 3 times.

Followed EXACTLY. They were good but I did find them a little heavy for what I like in a hamburger bun. Pretty easy to make though.  A nice treat to have homemade buns with a sunny bbq. Thanks!

Flavor was good and the dough was easy to work with but mine turned out dense for some reason.  They weren't light and fluffy like you would want a hamburger bun.  I will attempt again just in case it was something I did inadvertently.

Very good. The 'golf size' dough balls don't make regular size buns, but more like mini buns. I added an extra egg to the dough to tenderize and moisten it up - very good as is though.  I only had to bake mine for 11-12 min. for golf size dough balls.  I sprinkled with poppy seeds and sesame seeds - will definitely make again.

These make a nice dinner roll, but the texture was way off for a hamburger roll.  Too crusty on the outside, too soft on the inside.

These turned out AWFUL for me.  I followed the recipe to a T, and everything was much to dry.  The rolls were very hard and did not brown properly (they looked a lot like biscuits).  I don't know what I did wrong, but usually breads are not a problem for me.  These were.  I wish I knew the secret all the 5-star reviewers had to make these mildly edible.

these buns were fantastic!  I used 5 cups bread flour + 1/2 cup wheat germ.  I was a little worried the second rising wasn't going so well, so I just let them sit there for a while longer before I popped them in the oven.  they turned out really well.  great taste + texture/consistency.  I'll use this recipe whenever I need tasty buns!

Fantastic!  Made these this afternoon.  Made dough in the bread machine, adding garlic powder, grill seasoning, onion powder.  Baked in the oven on one pan so didn't move them.  Forgot the egg wash for the top, but topped with melted butter and a little salt and pepper before I finished baking, as these took about 5 minutes longer to finish.  Not too tall and not too flat.  Perfectly soft, but hold their shape well.  So easy that store bought have just become a "convenience item" rather than something I will need to get on a regular basis.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've been looking for a good recipe for hamburger buns for a while, as I prefer to make as much of my family's food from scratch as possible.
This recipe was easy and turned out beautifully!  I prepared the bread dough as I always do, and replaced 2 cups of white flour with whole wheat flour.  I also grated a bit of cheddar cheese to sprinkle on top of the buns before baking.  They were just the right size and the texture was perfect!
They got rave reviews from my VERY picky husband, and I'll never buy buns from the grocery store again!

These were very easy to make and they did rise beautifully, but they are very dense.  The texture is not what you expect in a hamburger bun.  I had read all the reviews, and so I was prepared for this.  The family thought the flavor was good, but didn't care for such a "heavy" bun.

I make these whenever I make bbq sandwiches, hamburgers or sometimes just for no reason at all.  They are delicious.  They're fairly dense and not really really air-ey so I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong.  But, if I am.. I plan to continue doing it wrong.  They are amazing just the way they are.  Everyone RAVES over these. I love even having them fresh out of the oven with a little butter.  Amazing recipe.  Thank you soo soo much.  We just LOVE it!!!

I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 AP flour.  I proofed the yeast with the 115 degree milk mixture and then added the flour.  My first rise was great, but the final rise was not that great. They cooked up nicely, but a little too flat.  Fairly dense with whole wheat, but stood up to sloppy joes nicely.

These were absolutely the best hamburger buns I have ever eaten.  They are soft and have a very mild taste.  I made sour dough buns two weeks ago for burgers and they weren't half as good as this recipe. Although I'm a fan of no knead bread, once this dough got going, it was very easy to knead and it was also very satisfying.  Great easy bun recipe!  Thanks!

This was really good, and I'm not usually one to try yeast breads. The advice on another comment about the temperature of the milk (should be between 120 & 130 it said) may have helped for a beginner like me. They were perfect, my family loved them.

These were good, and they were easy to make, and rose well.  We had them with Greek Turkey burgers.  I made exactly 12, like the recipe said.  These are not like store-bought hamburger buns.  They are filling, and good!

I'm only giving this four stars because of the directions. Also, the crust came out a little crispy for a hamburger bun. But I'm sure some adjustments to this otherwise very good tasting recipe could fix those things. The directions say that the dough balls should be a little bigger than a golf ball, but I made mine significantly bigger and still had enough dough for 16 rolls. However, some of them did not really get as big as I thought they would, although they're still perfectly useable as hamburger buns. I am trying to save money by making breads and bulkie rolls instead of buying and other than the things I mentioned, I was happy with the texture inside and flavor and would definitely make these again. Since it made so many, one batch frozen will last awhile for my husband (who takes bulkie roll sandwiches to work).

The only thing I *didn't* like about these is that they were a little tough. But next time I'll just knead them for 6 or 7 minutes instead of the 8. This recipe is a keeper!

My family really liked these. They held up to juicy burgers with mayo and ketchup. They are not at all like store bought buns that seem to melt away like the sugar/corn syrup in them. They are very basic tasting though and I could see putting some onion bits or powder or something in/on them before baking. Over all they are a great platform to start from. I will make them again.

These came out quite good, just a little heavier than I like. Next time I will not add use all the flour to start with. I will likely use 4 1/2 cups of flour and then after I mix in the liquid and knead for awhile, I will add more if needed. The dough was a bit stiffer than I am used to working with and that is because I followed the directions and added all the flour at once. My guess is 5 cups would have been enough. Cutting back and then adding, if necessary, is the way to go.

Make sure you let your liquid cools down to 120-130 degrees. Following the direction of "lukewarm" could result in a disaster if your definition of lukewarm is much warmer than 130 degrees. I baked each pan separately for 15 minutes. Unless you have a convection oven it is never a good idea to bake on more than one shelf at the same time. These rolls smelled so good and tasted great. The minor heaviness I experienced was likely due to too much flour. Great recipe and very easy!!!

This recipe is very easy, especially if you have a stand mixer.  The recipe instructions were very accurate, and the buns turned out perfectly.  They're  beautiful, and the texture is just right.  I will be using this recipe alot in the future.

Great bread. I made sure to flatten the dough and the buns came out perfectly shaped. They actually taste a lot like my grandmothers famous rolls, and of course that has to mean that it's a five star recipe! Cheers!

These were fantastic! So easy to make with mixer- I just wish I had cooked them a tad longer.

This is a good recipe for picky eaters or people who like simple tastes. My family and I like more complicated flavors, but we were still pleased with the results. We found they were more dense and heavier than typical hamburger buns. We decided to eat them as rolls with a little butter and salt. Keep in mind that these buns expand upward, but NOT outward, while baking.

My six year old daughter and I had a blast making these last night. We used both all purpose and whole wheat flour. We'll be making these again.

I'd give this recipe 3 stars as a hamburger bun, but 5 stars as a dinner roll type bun - so I averaged it out to 4.  I followed recipe exactly, using dough hook on kitchenaid mixer, and I got heavy buns in the end.  I liked the flavor as a fresh bun with some butter or jam on it, but as a hamburger bun it was just a little too heavy.

This recipe turned out fabulous! The bread rose beautifully; we ate hamburgers and sandwiches on them. They were the perfect consistency and easy to make! I will definitely make again.

I used a multigrain flour and did have to add about a third cup more water. After letting it rise for 1 1/2 hours, I shaped into 18 extra large buns.  Yum!

The dough was a bit too dry. Start out with just five cups of flour, and add the last half cup if necessary.

Super easy and delicious! However not my type of burger buns. They made our burgers super big. I wanted something slightly lighter . Perfect for an open face type of burger (as my cousin suggested). They will be perfect rolls too.  Chewy and soft with butter mmmm...

I followed the recipe...did not turn out soft and fluffy, but were rather crusty with a soft crumb. More like homemade bread, not soft hamburger buns. Perhaps I used too much flour to knead the dough? Tasted ok though, but definitely not a good sandwich bun.

Made according to recipe (didn't change anything).  Fail.  Didn't rise hardly at all.  Tough on the outside and almost raw on the inside.  Won't be making these again.  Congrats to those of you who were able to make these work!

I'll fully admit, I am not a baker.  I usually avoid any baking of breads.  I tried this recipe because I was making Italian beef and wanted a good bun to serve along with it.  I started out following the recipe to the T.  When I got to the missing the wet/dry ingredients, I found the mixture to be way too dry and dense.  I know enough about baking to know that the dough should be pliable and slightly stick to your hand.  I ended up adding almost 1.5 cups more water.  The dough finally was more of the consistency I thought it should be.  They turned out very good.  Next time I will only add 4 cups of flour and see how the dough consistency is at that point.

Personally,  I would have given them four stars , but my family loved them so much I had to give them five! Having made bread before I knew that It wouldn't use all 5 cup of flour. I started with one  and  added until it was the right consistency. I only ended up using 3 cups of flour.  If you are wondering one 25 ounce envelope of yeast is about 2 and 1/4 teaspoons. They raised perfectly for me at first part, but after I had formed the buns they did not raise hardly at all. That may be due to old yeast  or something else.  I will make these again.

We enjoyed these rolls as sandwiches on New Years Day filled with pulled pork.  I made the dough in the bread machine, using  5 c. of flour instead of 5.5 (although I sprinkled quite a bit extra while shaping the dough).  I also increased the rising time to 35 minutes.  The texture was light and delicious and whole family loved them.  I wonder if part of the problem some people are having is not with the amount of flour but the rising time.  Thank you for an excellent recipe!!

I think this will probably be my go-to hamburger roll recipe.  The one quality that draws me to these seems to be the quality that others hold in distain--the toothsome quality.  I cannot stand a burger bun that soaks up all the juices and drips  doughy strands between my fingers.  I made these for the first time for sloppy joes, and I'll tell you what, these held up nicely.  No dripping and melting into the sauce.  Even on their own, these have a pleasant, mild bread flavor, won't take center stage from anything you might be filling it with.  I almost think these might make a great Kaiser roll with cornmeal sprinkled on top and the traditional Kaiser scroll imprinted into the  rolls.  Regardless, if you're looking for that  ultra soft, fluffy, melty burger bun, I think you probably need to look at Moonie's burger bun recipe.  Those are good, but better for chicken salad, in my opinion.  You want a burger roll that holds up to juicy meat and overstuffing, I think this is an excellent choice.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  I've tried making this item twice, and both times the bread ends up too thick and not fluffy like a hamburger bun.  I did the recipe to the letter...maybe its some trick in kneading or something that I don't know about.  I am not a very experienced baker.

As written the recipe has way too much flour.  I had to make this twice because the first batch was so stiff it was difficult to knead and then it never rose.  The second time I let the yeast bloom in the liquid before adding the liquid to 4 cups of flour.  From there I slowly added in more flour until the dough was no longer sticky but not dry.  They came out much better.

I’m giving this recipe 5 stars with the caution to not start with 5 1/2 cups of flour. Your climate is going to vary the flour used, so I’d recommend starting with half until you know what works in your kitchen. I always use between 3 to 3 1/2 cups of flour before the dough pulls together like I want it. I do leave it slightly sticky, because I roll out on a floured surface after the first rise and cut it with 4” cookie cutters to get uniform buns rather than shape by hand. Heating the milk is optional. Basically, milk straight out of the fridge isn’t optimal, because the cold makes your yeast grow more slowly. Thing is, the mixing and kneading process alone will bring it to room temperature. The main advantage to warming liquid is it helps the yeast do its thing faster, but there’s always the risk that if you heat it too much, you’ll kill it. So, if you can spare an extra half hour for the dough to rise while you get on with other things, there’s no point in heating up the milk. You’ll get the same delicious, soft hamburger buns in the end with cold milk.

I admit I'm not good with raised breads, but this recipe was ok. The taste was good, but mine turned out heavier than I would have liked. Also a little too small for hamburgers (more maybe slider size). So I think the second rise could have used longer than the 20 minutes, or I may have overworked the dough. I will continue to play around with this recipe until I get it.

The only substitution I made was to use maybe 1/3 or so whole wheat white flour because I didn't have enough white flour. These are really dense, and the flavor was just OK. I think I'll look elsewhere for lighter, fluffier buns. If the only criteria you're looking to fill is "better than storebought", these will get you there, but these weren't what my family of hardcore breadatarians was after.

Mine came out very dry and dense, like biscuits. We ended up eating them that way with butter and jam.  No way could I use them as burger rolls. I'd give it 1 star for rolls, 3 for biscuits.  I think the flour/liquid ratio is off.

This recipe turned out wonderfully! At first, I was unsure about making them after reading the negative reviews, but I followed the directions exactly and they turned out perfect.

Great recipe!  I don't think I'll be able to return to tasteless grocery store buns after this!  I subbed half of the flour with the flour.  Delicious!  Light, fluffy, and flavorful!

They were soft and delicious but I was trying to make slider size and made them too small.  They are much like germain Zwieback I make and they are wonderful. I used canned milk as I do when I make my Zwieback and that really makes a difference.

Simple to make and taste great. These are slightly denser than I would prefer, but the taste and texture are still fabulous. My family loves them, and they have become a staple for hamburgers and any bun-based sandwich. I have also substituted 1 - 1.5 cups whole wheat flour, and they still come out delightfully.

These tasted great except that they weren't exactly light and fluffy. They ended up flat and the bottoms were crunchy. I followed the directions perfectly. They still tasted good though, and that's what counts.

I love this recipe.  5 stars.  I added 3/4 c pizza sauce in with dough. Brushed tops of buns with pizza sauce too before baking. Added 1 egg in mix too. Delicious for lunches.

Denser then I expected, this is a heavy bun. Follow the direction exactly and my family enjoyed it. May add some garlic or rosemary to the recipe next time but definitely a good recipe. will make again. Seems very forgiving.

I tried this recipe with a few modifications. I used fresh yeast and so a little more than the recipe recommends, I used less flour and kept adding the milk mixture till the dough felt soft enough so some was left at the end. They turned out absolutely delicious!!!!! Soft and warm! Just perfect!

I made this in my  mix master and added 4 tbsp of gluten to the whole wheat flour. I also proofed the yeast in about a cup of the milk mixture at about 120 degrees and only heated the milk until the sugar & salt desolved and butter melted. I took another reviewers suggestion and sprinkled with sesame seeds after brushing with egg yolk. The result was a soft bun with a slight crust. It was very good, but next time I will cut the salt to 1 tsp.

They were okay, but too hard for hamburger buns. If you remove 1/4 cup flour or 1/8 more water they would be a little bit softer.

This is so good!  I made it with my stand mixer and used not quite the full flour amount (but close) making sure to sift the flour and spoon it into a measuring cup.  I put sesame seeds on top, and baked for almost 20 mins turning halfway through as per the instructions.  I put them on cooling racks when they were done, and then made 1/4 pound beef patties that fit perfectly on these buns.  they were flavorful and chewy.  Absolutely the perfect hamburger bun!  I also made hot dog buns, rolling them out instead of flattening the balls.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

I used half whole wheat flour and have bread flour for my rolls, but I think I will stick to ap flour next time since I think it made them a little dense. Also, make sure you cover the entire top of the roll with the egg wash or else it looks kind of blotchy.

My husband and I loved these buns! Would anyone have an idea on how to make them fluffier? I may have added too much flour, but that didn't take away from the overall result. Delicious, soft, full of love, and even may replace our current recipe for a loaf of bread too! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Made these twice now and both times followed the recipe exactly except didn't bother with the egg wash.  Recipe made 12 perfect sized buns.  Turned out great for our burgers and even made pbnj for my daughters lunch and breakfast sandwiches with them using eggs, bacon, and monterey jack cheese the next day.  Much better than those things you buy in a plastic bag at the store.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very easy dough to work with and the end result was 12 perfect little buns! They also tasted equally delicious! I followed the recipe to the "T", with the exception of a bit less flour. I also brushed the buns with the entire egg (yolk and whites), sprinkling with some toasted sesame seeds before baking. I baked for the initial 10 minutes, switched racks, and baked for an additional 7 minutes. I made these in anticipation of my upcoming BBQ. Here's hoping! Thanks for sharing!

Yes, Great technique. I actually didn't use this recipe the first time because I ferment my dough but it worked great with my whole wheat dough. The technique is golden. Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly as written and the buns turned out great! The problem with other recipes I have tried in the past was always that the buns ended up way too thick and the burger to bun ratio was not very good. These were absolutely perfect for the homemade burger patties I made. Will be using this recipe from now on. Thank you :)

I had never made buns or rolls before so I was a little nervous. I chose this recipe because of its high ratings (and it seemed easy enough). Turns out, it is an easy recipe for beginners, like myself. I read reviews beforehand and took some advice and suggestions of others. However, they are still pretty dense and a bit too sweet for hamburger buns in my opinon. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but at least I'm a little more comfortable with baking bread now. I actually enjoyed them better as dinner rolls with butter... But even like that they are still a bit heavy and dense.

The best buns i have tasted And i Baked These First Time in My Life. I Followed the Steps as Mentioned, Except For The Flour Which I Put 1 Cup Less. It Turned Very Soft N Very nice Taste That You Can Eat It Simply With Butter. Since I Was In  Hurry To prepare lunch, I Allowed The dough To Rest First At 40 Mins, Then When I Placed on Baking Tray I allowed 15 mins rest. But This did Not Have Any Bad Effect On The Dough After Baking For 10 + Additional 5 Mins. My Husband Loved It And Joked about Opening A Bakery.

When I made this they turned out a little dense for hamburger buns. Does however make delicious dinner rolls... maybe it's just me.

Instead of the egg yolk wash, I should have melted butter and brushed across the top. The egg yolk made it way to dark on the top before it was through baking! I used a baking stone and it worked very well!

Easy recipe - delicious.  I added the sugar/water/yeast and let it sit for a few minutes.  Then added it with the butter and milk to the flour and salt.  Kneaded for about 5 minutes.  Family loved it!

Great recipe. As a novice cook, I found great delight in this mild and tasty bun recipe.

it was a a rough bun, not a fluffy or soft bun. I enjoyed it a lot. Not to sweet or salty!

These turned out really good - very soft and tender. I used lactose-free milk instead of regular due to allergies in the family. The only thing I would do different next time is increase the salt to 2 tsp. I thought they were a little on the bland side. Will definitely make again.

Love this recipe. Very easy. I used 3 c stone ground wheat flour and the rest white, proofed my yeast in some of the warm liquid. Ate 2 of the buns right out of the oven! Following day, a little heavy on texture, but still light. Will definately make these again!

Delicious! I made them just as the recipe states except I made the dough in my breadmaker and I started with 4 1/2 cups flour and then added more as needed. I also used half AP flour and the other half bread flour only because that is what I had on hand. I will never use store bought hamburger buns again- these were great and a huge hit with my family! Thanks!

Turned out fantastic--subbed a handful of wheat flour and didn't press them flatter due to sluggish yeast; baked in 13 x 9 glass pans w/melted butter on top...
didn't take very long to raise either!

I have cooked for many years and tried many recipes from Allrecipes, but this is the best recipe for Hamburger Buns I have ever made.  Followed the recipe amounts exactly, but as far as instructions, added the yeast to the cooled down liquids and let it bubble, then added it to 4 cups of flour and stirred in the other cup a little at a time.  There really is no need to knead for so long, 3-4 minutes is fine.  Texture was great.  When brushing with the egg wash, make sure to cover the entire top, makes them really pretty.  Mine were bumpy on top from mashing down, but raised real pretty while cooking.  This is a great recipe.

these were great.  They seemed sweet even though there is only 1 tlbs of sugar in them.  I used half wheat and half ap flour. I over baked mine and they came out quite dark  and the crust seemed hard and crusty, but when I bit in to them they were so soft. The crust was not even chewy.  I made these with black bean burgers, very yummy.

These turned out more like a dinner bun for me, but we loved them! I made them the size stated but they were way too small so I made some just smaller than a tennis ball and they were okay to put turkey burgers on. They turned out to be a firm bun, not so soft and fluffy inside, but still good!

I got snowed in so I made some homemade hamburger rolls for dinner instead of getting some from the store.  Glad I did because they were great. Will continue to use the recipe.

MMM.  Made these exactly like recipe calls for and they turned out well.  Just the right bun for a "juicy" sandwich like pulled pork.  Froze some, let them thaw on counter and they were good that way too.

Soooo Good! Bread was moist with just enough sweetness. Followed the recipe exactly buns came out just like the photos. When it was time for burgers I sliced the buns in half, painted them with a little melted butter and grilled for just a few minutes. The rolls pushed my husband’s already wonderful burger patties to a new level.  Better than the burger joints! Thanks for the recipe : )

My heating element burnt up right before I went to put these in the oven. I had to cook them in my toaster oven instead and they were still great. Cooking them in a toaster oven is, of course, not ideal and I am really, really looking forward to trying these the way they are supposed to be baked.  Awesome taste, great texture. Not dense, not spongy. Thanks!

Good recipe. I made the dough in my breadmachine then baked them in the oven. They turned out well, they are fairly light & fluffy. They almost remind me of an english muffin.

Awesome buns. I don't measure well so I just went by what looked correct but I find most bread recipes you need to do that to a certain extent.

These tasted great.  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to kneed the dough and they came out a little denser then I wanted.  Next time I will kneed them by hand.

Very good. Like others have said, i can see how they are perceived as dense but they were awesome!. Pretty simple to make, made a good amount. Made tehm the night before and they tasted great for lunch the next day. Put the rest in the freezer. I did only use 4 cups of flour but I also used half whole wheat and half AP, so that may have had something to do with it. Had one just out of the oven with strawberry jam, yummy!

I have been bread challenged my whole life.  In fact this was my second attempt today to make these.  Mine did not look like golf balls but they turned out perfect anyway.  They were more shaped like hockey pucks.  I used half wheat flour too and I am stoked for dinner tonight.  Thanks so much!

Wonderful buns!  I used whole wheat for 1/2 of the flour, and they were great.  I'll be using this a lot this summer!

This is an amazing and simple recipe.  The hamburger buns came out beautifully and so did the bread I made.  Off to experiment with different types of flour and such.

These were such a lovely addition to our homemade pub burgers.  Will make again.  I halved the recipe but found it was too wet for my bread maker's dough setting so I added more flour.  I think'll I'll need ~3.25 c of flour next time....I didn't measure it accurately the first time....

I followed the recipe and these turned out perfectly! I cooked one sheet at a time for 10 minutes each and they were just right. The aluminum foil underneath gave the buns a crisp golden bottom and made clean up a snap! I'll use this recipe a lot - so that you so much!

So far the best I have found.  A little dense, but still a tasteful bun.  Thanks.  Very good as is but I think I may try bread flour next week to see if that is an improvement.

What a great recipe! I ended having to brush them with melted butter instead of an egg yolk, and they were still fabulous. Made for a very tasty start to a sandwich!

After baking and eating it, I feel that I have to rave about it here. It was FANTASTIC! The end-product was fluffy, soft and chewy.. Exactly the way I wanted. This recipe is definitely a keeper.. I am so gonna make it again and again..

WOW!!!  Talk about adding class to a homemade hamburger.  These were delicious!!!  My daughter in law was ill but decided that the reviews on the buns were so good that she ate one all by itself. Will definitely make again but will increase the size of the buns.  Next I want to try as a hot dog bun.  YUMMY!

Tasty, hearty buns. I don't have a bread machine so I heated the milk, butter and sugar and then added the yeast. I'm new to baking bread and have found that when I add salt to the warm liquid mix, it prevents the yeast from foaming properly, then my dough doesn't rise. I added the salt with the flour and followed the rest of the recipe. The ones I shaped into hamburger buns came out better than ones I tried to make for hot dogs.

These were pretty tasty buns.  A bit dense but then again I'm not a baker and not sure how to knead too well.  All in all prety good.  Thanks for the recipe.

To make it easier I used powdered milk so I didn't have to scald it. I just doubled the warm water activated my yeast and then added 2/3 cups milk granuales.   The buns were soft, moist and perfect for the burgers. I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing and accidentally added the yolk the dough and it still turned out great.

Very good.  I think part of my problem was my portions when divided into the rolls weren't quite even as they didn't bake evenly.  The taste was great.  I didn't need quite as much flour to get the "sticky" dough that the good reviews mentioned but overall very pleased and will make again.  Update:  Better dividing of the dough helped a lot.  I think I over baked them a bit, but still acceptable texture and flavor.

These are terrific!  Very easy to make and they had both a nice texture and flavor without the chemical taste of commercial buns.  My family loved them.    As others had mentioned, I proofed the yeast in the warm (110) liquid for a few minutes before adding to the flour to make sure it was completely dissolved.

These were wonderful buns.  They were dense if you wanted to eat them as a roll, but that was perfect to hold a burger.  I subbed 2 of the cups of AP flour for wheat with no problems.  Yum!

I made these twice. They were good both times. Make sure you let them rise in a warm oven though. I just turn my oven on to any temperature for 30 seconds and then turn it off and put them in. And give them extra rising time. That always helps. They turned out great and my guests loved them. They did loose alot of their puffiness when I set them on the counter to preheat the oven, but I kind of liked them flatter becasue it makes the burger more manageable and you don't have to un-hinge your jaw to get it into your mouth :-)

Used bread flour and a little whole wheat flour.  These are good buns, but I really think they work better for sandwiches than hamburgers.  The egg wash leaves the outside a little crispier than I like for a burger and the buns are a little dense.  Definitely did not need all the amount of flour.

I followed this recipe carefully and took into consideration other reviews, but I still had a fairly dense bun that was just a little too heavy.  I blame this on my developing baking skills though, and others with more experience might have a better end result.

Thanks for the great recipe! All of the kids and my husband thought they were great. After one bite, one of my daughters said they were the best hamburger buns she had ever eaten! I did these in my bread machine and replaced some of the white flour with whole wheat flour. They came out just right, not too wimpy and not too heavy - just perfect for a hamburger with all the fixins. I think the key to not having them turn out too heavy is to add ONLY enough flour during mixing so that the dough is not very sticky. If you add too much flour, I think it would result in a heavier bun. Also, be sure to let them rise plenty long. They should be nice and light. I will definitely be making these again.

I tried making this twice.  The first time it didn't rise well because I used rapid rise yeast and didn't warm the liquid enough.  The second time was better but still very dense.  It could be me, but I did not get fluffy bread.

These are good, basic buns.  They are a bit more like rolls, but for heaver burgers or sandwiches like meatloaf sandwiches, they are very good--hold up to all that liquid.    I halved the amount of rolls to make sandwich rolls and they were quite big.  I think following the recipe amount of buns and making them longer would make for some good hot dog buns.  Thanks!

Excellent - not too heavy, slightly sweet, and a perfect match for a freshly-grilled burger.  I made this recipe in my bread machine, using active yeast, and it turned out perfectly.  The only change I made was to substitute one cup of whole wheat flour for one cup of the white flour.

These were awesome!! They were great for hamburgers and also for sloppy joes. Just put a little butter on a half and toast it, then put on your topping. YUM!!!!

Beautiful buns!  Holds up well to soggy foods such as my semi-world-famous pulled pork!  Excellent recipe!  Hubby raved!  I will be adding this to my most-favored file.  Thank you so much

I have made these buns several times and every time, they get better! This is a wonderful basic recipe that you can add you own flavor to. One reviewer stated she would try sesame seeds and onion on top. I thought that sounded great and it was. Thanks for this delicious bun recipe.

A nice, all-purpose bun recipe.  Be aware, these rolls rise straight up to heaven while baking, even though I flattened them out in hamburger bun shape first!  They ended up looking like dinner rolls, but they still held up well with burgers.  Family thought they were marvelous.
Next time I will put on some sesame seeds, or put some minced onion in the dough for more flavor.

I used my bread machines dough cycle to make these.  I think I'll try kneading them by hand next time because the dough was really sticky and I couldn't get it into a ball shape.  They tasted great, but were oddly shaped.

I want to try these again sometime. I am not the expert bread maker yet, but for some reason these never got very big for me at all (I let them rise over an hour). When I made them the directed golf ball size, they ended up being mini-sandwich buns! They still tasted all right, but weren't what I expected. They also were a little dense. I'll try again or have my husband try (he makes great breads) to see if we can get these fluffy and normal size! Fun to try.

The first time I made these I was already committed when I realized I didn't have enough white flour, so I substituted 1 1/2 c. whole wheat flour.  The buns came out beautifully, and I am still hearing raves!

Very good and pretty simple to make.  I did proof the yeast first in the the cup of water and 1 tsp of sugar.  I then heated the milk, butter,salt and 2 tsp of sugar, cooled and added the flour, milk mixture and yeast mixture all at once.  The only negative comment was they were somewhat less fluffy than then grocery store variety they had eaten all their life; however my husband liked these so much he was eating the buns plain after he had his burger.  They also make especially good rolls for sandwiches too.

My family loved these!  The recipe was very easy to follow, and we especially liked the ones with minced onion (dried) sprinkled on top before baking. Yummy!!

I really love making homemade bread, but these just didn't work for me.  They rose fine, I shaped em, I baked em, and they tasted like cardboard and we didn't like the texture.  Maybe I messed it up, but I won't be trying this again.

Delicious!  You could easily make 18 or 24 smaller buns out of this recipe.  Very versatile - would make great hamburger, hoagie, or hotdog buns.  I think I will try them as dinner rolls next time.  Thanks for the recipe!
