Quick, easy and good!

Making this delicious AND nutritious is a no brainer:

1. Substitute ground turkey for ground beef 
2. No margarine~use olive oil or canola
3. Eggbeaters for whole eggs
4. Low or no fat sour cream (and use less than 2 cups!!!)
5. Low or no fat cheese

Using these substitutions should make this much less fattening!

I made this for Husband's breakfast, and he said it was "delicious." I used Jimmy Dean sausage instead of ground beef, and I eyeballed the other ingredients. After browning the tortilla strips, I removed them from the skillet, and stirred them in immediately before serving - this avoided any sogginess. I also sprinkled some freshly snipped cilantro on top. Awesome recipe. Will definitely make again. Thanks so much!

I wasn't too crazy about this one - the tortilla strips became very dry and didn't blend in well with the rest of the dish.  And although it tasted allright hot off the stove, it seemed stale and unappetizing after only a short while and nobody felt like a second helping.

My family loved this recipe. I did change the ingredients though. I used flour tortillas, turkey meat and salsa instead. It was really good. Will definetly make again(using the same substitutions)

Very good - we'll be making this one again!
I used flour tortillas and seasoned the ground beef while cooking, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.
It was quick, easy, appealing-looking, and tasty.  My husband prefers spicier foods and topped his with hot sauce; those seeking to feed a spice-loving crowd could season the meat with a little taco seasoning and use hot enchilada sauce and pepper jack cheese, with pico or hot salsa to top.  I liked it just fine as written, though; it was not bland.  It seems like an affordable, use-what-you-have-onhand kind of recipe, and is going to become comfort food in our house!

4 out of my 5 kids loved this. It was easy and I found it by typing in the ingredients I had on hand. I wish I had drained the beef better as it was a tad on the greasy side. Scrumptious though!

This is a great recipe.  I've used flour tortillas instead of corn both times I made it.  The second time I made it I put chopped tomato on with the onion and black olive and served it with thinly sliced lettuce.

I'm rating my own recipe, but it's a favorite of mine. It looks pretty in the skillet but turns a little messy on the plate.
Thanks.

Taste good if you do half side with green sauce and other side with Red sauce. Every person who tries Chiliquilla loves it !!!!!

This was really great!  My whole family loved it even my daughter who doesn't like eggs or enchilada sauce.  I doubled the recipe for my family of five and it was just enough. It was a quick one-pan dinner that was just what a busy school night called for! YUM!!!

I tried it with Mexican-seasoned turkey and we liked it better than with the beef.  It enhanced the flavor. A quick and easy meal.

Mmmmm. Easy and fast. This takes less than thirty minutes. I seasoned the meat and used homemade enchilada sauce. I loved using enchiladas sauce instead of salsa as it was non chunky. Great recipe! Scaled down to 1 serving easily, I just added a bit more sauce to taste.

I added fresh cilantro and used medium enchilada sauce, but it still needs a little more zing. Will probably add some taco seasoning the next time.  Also, I didn't cook the tortilla strips long enough.  Make sure you get them good and crispy.  Overall, we enjoyed this.

Even my grandson, who is a fairly picky eater, loved this and asked me when I was going to make more.  I brought some to work and people were salivating over it, absolutely loving it!!  Nice and easy and delicioso!  It's even better served over freshly cooked refried beans.

This is delicious and so easy to prepare -- it's a staple in our house.  Because it is a little heavy on the calories, I skip the sour cream altogether, replace the margarine with no stick cooking spray, and cut back on the cheese to make it a little healthier.  But it's really good recipe either way, thanks for sharing!

very yummy! I made a few changes, first I used flour tortillas because that is all I had, second I used only about 1/2 the amount of butter and third I made my own enchilada sauce (the texas style  one found on this website) We will have again for sure.

This was so simple and everything that it called for I already head in my kitchen.  I added some taco seasoning while cooking the beef, and added some garlic powder.  I also added two large tamotoes towards the end.  I will make this recipe again and again!

Awsome! Everyone ate it, that is a first. I use 1 lb. of stew beef (instead of ground)  Cook it on low for 6 hours with a pkg. of taco seasoning mix and 3/4 cup water. Shread beef and stir into liquid in crock. Let cook for another 30 or so minutes. Yummy flavored meat to add to recipe.

MMmmm . Had this last night for dinner. Really tasty. I used ground turkey, didn't use the margarine and also left out the olives. My proportions of things were a little differnent as well, but not by much. I added some taco seasoning to the meat as other had recommended. I really enjoyed this. I serve this with some spicy black beans and really enjoyed it. I'll defintely make this again.

Average.  Smelled better than it tasted.  It was fine, but I wouldn't make it again.  I followed the instruction exactly except that I left out the olives because my husband doesn't like them.  I'd suggest adding some more spice with a hotter enchilda sauce and some pepper jack cheese like someone else suggested.  I made it milder (per the recipe) in hopes that my 4 and 6 year olds might like it, but they wouldn't touch it.

This was surprisingly yummy. I did use olive oil instead of margarine and I also browned the tortillas, then removed them and stirred them back in right before adding the sour cream. I think this would be great with some tomatoes in it.

This recipe really surprised me!  I just finished eating it and it was very good.  I made a few changes, however, and next time would make more.  I used whole wheat flour tortillas and really browned them.  You must leave the tortillas and the egg in the pan (pushed to the side) just like the recipe says because this makes the finished product hold together so nicely that you can cut it up like a pie into slices!  I used twice as much ground beef, and enough sour cream to make it look nice on top.  Next time I will season the ground beef first.  Overall, very pleasing! Use lots of olives!

My picky family, who never likes the same casserole, all loved it!  I used ground turkey, and cooked Egg Beaters with Pam to keep the calories down.  It wasn't my favorite - but to keep the husband and kids happy - it was worth it!!  This will be served often!  Fast and easy!!!

This was quite good.  Three of the four kids (all under 7) liked this. I used 4 corn tortillas instead of 8. It took at least 10 minutes to get the tortilla pieces nice and crispy.  I made my own enchilada sauce, but even so this was pretty quick to make.

Great presentation.  I was a little skeptical at first, but I was pleasantly surprised!  Used flour tortillas- it was all I had on hand, used ground turkey instead of beef, and finally I added jalapenos and cilantro.  This one is definitely making "the list".

This definately got rave reviews in our house! I did add more than 8 ounces of ground beef, that just didn't seem like enough.  I used green chilies instead of the green onions and flour tortilla's instead of corn.  8 tortilla's seemed like a lot so I did some in the pan like the recipe calls for & did some in the oven.  Overall it was very simple & very tasty.  I will definately be making this one again!

We really liked this recipe.  It has potential for lots of variations.  Add chicken, use different sauces, add other vegetables (we used tomato instead of olives and added fresh cilantro).  So fast and easy.  Will definitely try again with variations.  Next time maybe salsa verde!

Very good, simple one dish meal. Made it with corn tortillas. Next time I'll try flour. I'm also going to try substituting chicken for the ground beef for a change. I topped it with fresh chopped tomatoes, salsa & cliantro. yummy! Served over refried beans.

This recipe was so easy and the flavor was awesome.  I used the corn tortillas torn into thin lengthwise strips as listed and made sure I browned them to the point where they were a little crispy and not soggy.  I used butter instead of margarine and cut back to about half the amount.  I also used lean ground beef and low-fat sour cream.

The visual appeal was good, flavor was excellent, and only one pan to wash.  Will be adding this to my list of regulars.

This was just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly and the flavors were good but not great.  The egg did very little for the dish and the tortillas came out soggy.  I will keep this recipe in the back of my files.

Ok, but we weren't inspired.  My girlfriend found it "slimy" (perhaps less margarine/egg would accommodate her?), and I found it a bit bland, and more egg than I was looking for.

I used flour tortillas instead of corn, but followed the recipe otherwise.  I didn't look at the reviews first, but it seems that the people who added some extra flavor liked this recipe better than those that didn't.

I made this again, only this time I used sliced round steak, and plain corn tortilla chips on top and it was very good, much better with the red sauce than the green.  It still needs some spicing up so I would reccomend some chili sauce.

Definitely an interesting meal.  It does present itself nicely.  May try to mix the beef, eggs and sauce together after cooking the beef.  Really fun to try to pronounce too.  No one is sure what they are getting for dinner!

When a recipe doesn't call for any seasonings, it's a dead giveaway that it's going to bland. I know many people like to cook a recipe as written in order to rate it fairly, however, if I see potential in a dish I'm not going to bore my family to tears just to make a point.  Well, this was one of those kinds of dishes to me. I seasoned the meat with garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, cayenne, cumin and chili powder. Also added two cans of green chiles, pinto beans and minced onion. Instead of scrambling, I poached my eggs and then nestled them on top of the meat mixture. Kind of like the Charlie Brown Christmas tree, this recipe just needed a little tender loving care. The end result was so yum and I thank you for a great start to a dish we all enjoyed!

I have wanted to make this recipe for a long time and I think it's because the picture makes it look so appetizing.  Well, the picture definitely looks better than this tastes.  It's very bland and I even used hot enchilada sauce.  I only used 4 tortillas because 8 sounded like an awful lot for a half pound of meat.  My daughter had leftover pizza after one bite - I did eat mine and I'll probably eat the leftovers but I won't make it again.  Sorry :-(

Very easy to make and one of those you can easily create from ingredients on hand by doing a few substitutions.  I would use taco seasoning as mentioned by others and flour tortillas would probably taste better.  We also added a few jalapenos to give it some "punch."

I LOVE THIS DISH. Seriously, the second i found it in my 'Recipe of the day email" i decided to make it that night, and have made it (at least) once a week from there onward. I make my own enchilada sauce otherwise i follow this recipe almost to perfection.. we usually add on olives, jarred jalapenos and sour cream right at the very end so they stay cool and fresh on top instead of cooking in. Sometimes we use a can of well drained beans (kidney or black are the best) or we use fake beef, or ground turkey instead of the ground beef. works about the same but of course you dont have to cook the beans in the beginning of the recipe just add them in where the beef goes back in at the end so they get a warm up.

I personally would give this dish a 3 at best, as would the rest of my family.  But, my brother came over and raided the fridge and reheated these leftovers.  He said that in the future, if I'm ever planning another dinner for him and my folks, to prepare this dish.  He LOVED it.  He ate every last bit of the leftovers.  Which, was great for me that I didn't have to throw it out.  And great that I have a recipe especially for him to prepare.

My son-in-law whipped up this recipe and we were all so surprised.  It's absolutely delicious, so much so that me made another batch for left-overs (lunch at work for the next day).  We've made it a couple of times and the corn tortillas are so much more enjoyable than the gooey flour ones.  We substituted shredded chicken for the ground beef and added green chilis and were surprised with the difference. We loved both. The eggs make the whole dish light and fluffy.

This wasn't a bad recipe, but not quite as I expected it to come out. I will modify next time. It didn't help that I did not have sour cream on hand. It is a recipe with potential.

Yummy!  Kind of had a tamale-like taste to it.  I doubled it for the 7 of us and there wasn't any left.  I used mexican blend cheese instead of plain cheddar.  Will definitely make again.

Made this recipe with flour instead of corn tortilla strips and I think that made it even better. A big hit with the whole family. Thanks for posting!

This recipe when served in Mexico is normally  made with chorizo, and boy does it taste much better. This recipe tasted flat.

This was a very easy dish to make and it did look pretty in the skillet.  However, I didn't think all the flavors meshed very well.  Although my husband ate it, neither of us was crazy about it and I couldn't even finish my plateful.  I won't be trying this one again.

I thought this was a quick easy idea for dinner that tastes great.  I didn't have corn tortillas so I substituted flour.  I also used hot enchilada sauce instead.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was great for a quick work night meal. I added taco seasoning to the beef as I was browning it. I also broiled the corn tortillas rather than frying them in the butter to cut down a tad on the fat. I made a double recipe so for the left overs I served over baked potatoes with some salsa.

We enjoyed this dish, however, I will add extra spice the next time or purchase and Enchilada sauce with additional spice.  If you are serving this recipe to children you may want to stay with mild Enchilada sauce.

I am not a big fan of Mexican cuisine but this was good. Very easy to make. I made it as per the recipe just added a bit extra enchilada sauce (in retropsect, I should have left it the way it was.) My husband LOVED this, my mother enjoyed it...my 8 yr old wouldnt try it , but it really was a good ,quick meal. I would certainly  make it again.

Easy to fix. A little bland for my tastes. Next time, will try to spice it up a touch with pepper flakes and/or Mexican seasoning. A hit with younger palates.

This turned out great, instead of ground beef I substituted fresh made chorizo I picked up at the local Mexican market. I have been making this for years, I've just never reviewed a recipe before.

We thought this recipe was really good.  It was fairly simple to make.  I did not use butter, instead I just used several sprays of Pam when cooking the tortillas.  The only other change I made was to add some taco seasoning to the beef.  I doubled the recipe to use up a full pound of ground beef.  I will be adding this to my "will make again" list.  To reduce fat, I may try it with chicken next time.

This turned out way better than I expected.  I made it simply to use up a bunch of leftover ingredients, so I used ground turkey (which I seasoned with adobo and garlic) and green enchilada sauce.  Up until the first bite I still was questioning the recipe, but it was really good.  Husband ate it but didn't say "wow", four year old didn't finish her serving.  I probably won't make it on purpose again, but will keep it in mind when I need a clean out the fridge recipe.

I took another users suggestion and adapted this for breakfast.  I used hot pork sausage and cooked green chilis in with it while browning.  I also used medium enchilada sauce since we like spicy food and I use 6 eggs.  I left off the sour cream since my husband doesn't like it and I wasn't quite sure how it would taste with the sausage.  When I first read the recipe, it sounded like too much work and I was skeptical on how the whole thing would cook, but I am so glad I tried it.  I have made this twice and it will definitely be a regular for our weekend breakfast!  Thanks!

One of the reasons I love this recipe (in addition to its yumminess) is that it's so versatile. First time I made it, I didn't have corn tortillas, so I substituted nacho cheese doritos (just before serving).  I also like to sprinkle some dry taco seasoning mix in with the ground meat while it's cooking.  When using the corn tortilla strips, I saute them until they are crispy and set them aside, adding them at the end - layer of meat mixture, then olives & green onions, then finally tortilla strips, sour cream & cheese (until cheese melts).

This was a hit with my family.

Wasn't a fan of the egg. Take out the egg, make with 2x the amount of enchillda sauce, and instead simmering the sour cream in add afterwards. I think it will be much better with those changes - IMO.

Loved it. We didn't have any leftovers.  I do think that the recipe could have used another egg though, and I think green chiles would be a good addition also, but really good just as is.  Thanks.

We really loved this recipe.  I only used 5 tortillas and that was enough for us.

This was very good as a different dinner option. The corn tortillas added a great flavor to it. I doubled the recipe, which I am glad I did....my 17 year old had 2 large servings...that's how much my family liked it!

This recipe was very good.  Even my 4 year old liked it.  I would set the tortilla chips aside so they don't get soggy.  It is almost better the 2nd day when the flavors can mix.  Just heat the corn tortillas whole and break off and enjoy.

This was a fun meal.  I used mild enchilada sauce which the kids thought was still kind-of spicy.  I really enjoyed the crispy tortillas.  Take the time to really crisp them up.  It's a nice addition!

This was just ok.  Kind of bland. Next time I would season it and add more things to it, like tomatoes and cilantro. It was quick and easy though. The eggs were good.

This was a really simple and tastey recipe. I substituted ground turkey for the beef and made my own enchilada sauce because my child is allergic to the canned stuff. It came out great. There were no left overs

We liked this one a lot.  It was a little bland but we added some homemade salsa and chips as well as the tortilla to it.  It was kid friendly because most kids love cheese and sour cream.  The chips were a bonus also.  We will make this over and over.  Easy and quick.

Although quick and easy to make, that was all this recipe had to offer. It was not very kid friendly either.

This was very good! My pickiest eater didn't care for it but the other 3 members of our family enjoyed it. I would make again but stick to using the amount of sauce recommended in the recipe, I think my son would have enjoyed it more if the tortilla strips still had a little crunch to them. Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious.  I only had flour tortillas on hand and had to use them.  I think it would be even better with corn tortillas.  Really tasty.

I put a little extra sauce (like others recommended) and it was great.  Even my pickiest eater ate it.  Next time I will add a bit of seasoning.
