I am not a big beef lover but this broth has such a rich depth of flavor that I loved this. I did not add the capers or red pepper because I didn't have it on hand-and it still was very good.  The only thing I think it needed was veggies.  I added carrot chunks this time. My husband ate over white rice. I had over red beans and rice (leftovers). 
Added 2-27-03:I've made this a few times now,and have noticed each time, when you add the potatoes,it loses quite a bit of flavor. I now add extra spices WHEN I make with the potatoes. When I serve over rice, beans etc., I simply omit the potatoes.Also, we did not like the flavor of the capers, when used.To our taste, the capers really changed the flavor (to "sour" instead of nice and "tangy")., Will make again WITHOUT the capers."

I love all kinds of stews and this was a great departure from common European stews. My husband raved and my son ate it without complaints, even with the olives. I departed from the recipe by slow cooking in a crock pot (love my crock pot!) - after browning meat, adding spices and simmering for 3 minutes. Ate it in a sourdough bread bowl - yummy. Next time must try more authentic Cuban meal with fried plantains.

This was without a doubt the best stew ever! I made this for our weekly"extended family", 12 people, dinner . That required doubling the recipe.  I used my crock-pot and cooked the beef and other ingred. (except the potatoes) for 8 hours on low.  I cooked the potatoes separately and added them to the stew for the last 1/2 hour. I served this with crusty bread, steaned whole green beans and a salad.  This is a winner.

Oh, my, my, my, my, my! Or should I say, que bueno!  My hubby LOVED this dish, giving it an off the charts "10"!  Tweaks:  I made exactly as directed except used beef broth instead of water, did not add potatoes, served with mashed (thanks previous reviewer), and added a tablespoon of cornstarch with beef broth at the end for a lovely gravy.  AH, the sweet, the savory, very well done, indeed.  Will be a winter classic in this home! 12/11/19 : I added cubed sweet potato, delicious!  One of my fave AR recipes of all time.

I left out the potatoes and served this over rice.  I put all the liquids in a measuring cup and added just enough water to make 2 cups.  I threw the meat and liquid in my pressure cooker and cooked it for 50 minutes.  Very tender and excellent!!!

I was looking for something a little different and this was a great choice.  It's very flavorful and satisfying.  My alterations were to double the meat, onions and tomato sauce, and add a 7 oz can of diced green chiles.  I also browned the meat first and then sauteed the onions on top of all the browned bits from the meat and deglazed with the sherry.  This all helped to make a thick, dark gravy.

Loved this!  Another hit at my Soup and Stew party.  Interesting blending of flavors that only got better the longer it simmered away in the crock pot.  Next time I will make it spicy by adding some crushed red pepper or a fresh jalapeno or two.  Great Stew!

Made for our gourmet cooking club of 8 people on 4/3/04.  The stew was a hit as part of our Cuban inspired menu.  Rave comments about the great blend of flavors with the unusual combination of ingredients.  I did lightly dust the beef with flour before cooking and I rinsed the capers with water before adding them.  Otherwise, doubled the recipe and followed it exactly.  Served with an avocado soup, salad, crusty bread and white rice.  Poured a red Italian wine from Umbria that held up well to the green olives. Slightly fruity rather than tangy. Dessert was a banana and pecan "Brown Betty" type topping served over a rum cake.  The stew recipe is a keeper!

We all liked this. I served it over rice and it was really good, although it could have easily stood alone because of the potatoes.

I was sort of doubtful with the olives, capers and rasins.  The combination makes a sweet and salty broth.  I added some portabella mushrooms and it turned out great.  The recipe doesn't specify when to add the red bell pepper, so I added it with the olives.

I don't normally take the time to rate a recipe, but this was just NOT good at all.  We ended up going out to dinner instead. And my husband LOVES Cuban food.

Very good flavors!  I made it exactly as the recipe states (minus the red bell pepper).....except I just dumped it all in my crockpot and cooked it on low all day.  Definitely a different twist than a typical stew I'm used to - but we loved the flavors!

This is very good - "peasant food" I call it.  I was a little hesitant with the ingredients like the olives, raisins and capers together, wasn't sure about the combination, but tried because of the other reviews. I am glad I did.  Rich, a good winter meal!

Very good and while it looks intimidating its actually pretty easy. I skipped the potatoes and served this over rice with a loaf of crusty bread. I used up the last of our summer tomatoes which I added at the very end.  It was delicious! Try it!

Oh, my! I was looking for something different and I found it! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe as is. Everyone liked it, but thought it could have had a bit more "middle" (body). The second time I made it, I doubled the spices, cumin and oregano, and I used beef stock/broth instead of water. I also left out the capers for my family's preference. I cooked the potatoes separately, and on one occasion, I left out the potatoes all together and served it with rice. I also used green pepper because it's what we had. YUM! Either way, it's a hit. Thanks!!!!

I was looking for a Cuban recipe and I don't know if this is authentic but, it was very good. I had to cook it at least two hours instead of the hour and a half. I really loved the raisins. This is a dish that is better the next day. I would definitly make this again.

By FAR the best stew I have had in a LONG time.  Although the ingredients are different, the flavors blend so beautifully to make a truly lovely dish.  This one is definitly great for company.  The whole family loves it (even my toddler!)

Yuuuuuummm. Such a nice change from a typical beef stew. I added half a can of Goya black beans... this added a great different texture to the soup. I served it with rice and sweet plantains. This is definitely a "wow" recipe worthy of company. I plan on freezing all of my leftovers for a special treat on a rainy day!

Very easy and satisfying.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any sherry, so I substituted beef broth.  The flavor was nice, but I'm sure it would have been better with the wine... will have to make it again sometime as written.  Good recipe, though - thanks!

This is what beef stew should taste like!  I used chuck roast and omitted olives and capers, it's still good.  Instead of sherry, I used Madeira.  I also used a whole 15 oz can tomato sauce.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly (with the addition of some red pepper flakes for heat) and it was soooo tasty.  The ingredients do seem a bit strange, but the combination of sweet and salty is what makes this dish so good...thanks S. Shames!

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time I did it exactly as the recipe said.  It was stunngingly delicious.  The second time I didn't have bay leaves or red pepper.  While still good, the recipe really needed each ingredient.  This stew was popular even with several "picky" eaters that I tried it on.  My husband would like me to try adding carrots; I haven't yet because it may change the flavor too much.  This stew is scrumptious!

Very tasty and easy recipe.  I did not have any Sherry so I substituted with Madeira.  Next time I would spice it up a bit more perhaps with red pepper flakes!? I did add more vinegar than called for.

This recipe has great potential!  I chose it because of the unique ingredients.  I substituted cumin with chili powder and green olives with black olives -- only because I didn't have on hand.  I believe the green olives would enhance the flavor even more.  There's a sweetness to the sauce -- it's delicious.  The only problem I had was with the timing of the potatoes -- following the receipe the potatoes aren't done in the time period provided -- making dinner late.  Next time, I would add the potatoes at the beginning.

Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe. My family loved this meal. I made enough so there would be leftovers, but my kids liked it so much, there was only enough left for one more serving! Changes I made: no raisins; substituted apple cider for the wine vinegar. We served it with optional side dishes of: white rice, salad, and sour dough bread. All sides went really well with the meal. My husband said that he really enjoyed the blend of spices and how they came together in the flavoring. For a change of pace, next time I will be serving it in small sourdough bread bowls and omitting the rice, as the sourdough really complements the meal.

Great recipe.  We really enjoyed this.  Browned the beef first then added onions etc.  Used 2 1/2 cups water to cover the beef and added 1 Knorr beef boullion cube.

Exactly what I craved. Excellent! I love the tangy taste. Used golden and regular raisins, did not have sherry, so I used white wine, served on top of red potatoes...YUM! Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty stew. I used a full cup of dry sherry and golden raisins instead of the dark ones. I also doubled the cumin amount, the green olives, and the capers. We had large bakery fresh rolls on the side. My husband and I really appreciated the unique flavor, such a welcome change from old-fashioned beef stew!

I was worried about this one - ingredients seemed a little odd, but I tried it based on the 5-star rating.  It was very good!!! Just don't make the mistake of telling the picky eaters in the family what's in it.  My husband for example, hates raisins but ate an entire bowl thinking they were some kind of little beans because they were plump after cooking so long!
I will definitely be making this one again this winter. Thanks.

Just tried this recipe and was a little concerned over the combinations (raisins, pimento olives, etc.) but it was great. I sauteed the meat and onion/garlic as directed but then put all in the crock pot (except potatoes which I simmered separately an hour before serving and then added to the meat mixture in the crock pot) and it was absolutely delicious. I would probably add some carrots next time, but my husband loved this flavor so much that I will fix it often. Donna Delene

Pretty good but did not have the depth of flavor as some of the Cuban stews we’ve had before. Made this as written except we substituted beef broth for water. After tasting it, we added Tiger Sauce to bring more flavor. There is no reason that raisins need to be cooked for 1 ½ hours in step 2 unless you like mushy ones . . . 15 or so minutes of cooking time is adequate. Some other reviewers skipped the potatoes, and I would do the same next time or possibly substitute 1 cup malanga, cubed. Increase the cumin to 2 tablespoons (from 1/2 teaspoon) and add 2-3 tablespoons of Spanish paprika.

This was easy to make and has a wonderful flavor. My kids came home from school and said it smells like "Grandma's cooking", that is the best compliment since my mom is an awsome cook. Did not have dry sherry but the flavor was still on point.

I didn't add the Sherry and I used Crushed Tomatoes instead of Tomato Sauce. I also added 2 cups of fresh sliced mushrooms and half a jar of Salsa. I wanted to make enough for a few nights so I added two cans of drained Black Beans and two cups of Beef Broth. My wife told me to add this recipe to her list of favorites.

I personally thought this was on the best meals I have ever made.  By hubby of 13 years didn't think it was the best ever but he did enjoy it!LOL   I made just a few changes because of what I had on hand.  I subbed just a dry red whine, and balsamic vinegar, dried Italian seasoning and no bay leaf, yellow bell pepper and no capers. No potatoes, so I served it over yellow rice. I almost left out the raisins but decided to put them in. IT WAS AMAZING!!!  The 4 year old I was babysitting asked for 3rds!  There really wasn't any left over.  Will be making again for sure!! Thanks!!!

Nice recipe. To shorten the cooking time, I just pressure cooked the meat for about 35 mins on low heat. Also didn't have any sherry so replaced it with redo cooking wine. The stew was delicious and the meat very tender.

This was great!  I used stew beef and floured it before browning.  Also substitued golden raisins for the regular, used beef brother rather than water and used a full cup of sherry rather than the 1/2 cup.  My husband and I loved it, only problem was for some reason my kids wouldn't eat it...their loss!

Great recipe! I used the suggestions and used beef broth instead of water and red pepper flakes. It took a bit long to the get potatoes tender. I used two small potatoes, one carrot, and japanese pumpkin for a mixture. I served it over white rice and it was great....my boyfriend raved over it. The flavor of the capers, raisins, and olives were amazing!!

We enjoyed eating this. It's very different to any other beef stew we have tried. It has kind of a sweet & tangy flavour. I left out the potatoes so I could serve it on mashed potato instead of on rice.

Great recipe!  I usually make it with venison instead of beef, leave out the potatoes and serve over polenta.  It's always a hit!

Made this today for dinner and it was so good. I didnt have sherry nor red wine vinger so I didnt add it. I did however, add about 3/4 cup of Goya Sofrito to the sauce and it was just perfect. I also added a small can of veggies. I served this over a bed of rice and sweet plantains. Will definetly make this again. Thanks!

One of the best beef stews I've ever had and very easy to prepare.  I did double the amount of beef and added some cornstarch and water to thicken the gravy - which was just a preference of mine.  The sherry really does add to the flavoring.  Thanks submitter.

This was a great recipe! My husband raved about it and I made it twice for him in one week. I added a little more tomato and garlic than the recipe called for, but it was fresh tomato ground up, not canned.

I followed the recipe except for using Capers and was disappointed.  My family ate the meat and I ate some of the potatoes.  The raisins were not bad, but overall, despite liking the individual ingredients, this combination of flavors must be an acquired taste-- we like to try new things in this household, but will leave this one alone.

The flavor was much more subdued than I had expected. It was... an interesting flavor. If I make it again, I'll add more heat to it (i.e. hot peppers).

I used pork tenderloin instead of beef, since it's what I had and needed to be used. It was perfect! I also had 2.5 pounds of meat, so I needed more sauce and added about 8 oz. of jarred Goya soffrito as well as the tomato sauce. I also used a little Goya seasoning and left out the olives and capers (although I love them) because it sounded strange. I also left out the raisins. Otherwise, this was a great recipe served with the Easy Arroz Con Gandules that I found on this site.

I fed my family of 5 with this recipe.  It was an EASY recipe.  My husband and my sons ages 16 and 12 said on a scale of 1-10 (10 being best) they would give it a 7.  My daughter rated it an 8.

Personally, I was not floored.  I rated it a 6.  Perhaps I did something wrong.  I truly feel like this was a flavorful beef stew period.  Not something to write home about. 

I followed the recipe TO THE LETTER.  I could not get the benefit of the raisins.  Yes, the recipie is tangy.  I like the tangy but I did not benefit from the sweet.

Next time I think I'll leave out the olives.

YES! My Mamá used to make something similar. There was def. something missing in the texture. Will add carrots and perhaps a little corn starch next time to thicken. I let it simmer a lot longer than the recipe call for. Very good!

Aside from using only 1 lb. of sirloin tips and adding a bag of baby carrots, I followed the recipe as written. My entire family loved this dish - even my stew-hating husband! I will definately be making this again and again.

I made this stew a week ago.  I kept past reviewers suggestions in mind while making this stew.  I doubled the recipe browning the beef cubes then combining everyting in the crockpot on high for 4 hours.  I tried out the recipe on my husband his reply "different, but good" having another bowl.  I used 1/2 pound of potatoes for double the recipe.  I will definatly fix this stew again thanks for posting this recipe.

This was great!  One of the best recipes I have ever tasted.  The only modifying we did was I had no tomato sauce on hand, didn't realize it, and so I used PACE roasted onion and garlic sauce.  The flavor was so good that I wanted more but resisted cause I knew I didn't need more.  We served it over rice, didn't add potatoes.

I come from a Cuban background and made this because it looked so similar to some of the dishes I make, but for some reason it was lacking to me. Not to say that it was bad, but just different than what I am used to.

This is a very good everyday recipe. I don't think I would use if for entertaining but a great family meal. Next time I will use the crockpot. Also, I didn't have olives or raisins and it was still good. I think this is a recipe that you can mix around the ingredients and still have a great meal.

I have to give this 5 stars. As I was cooking it I was afraid the kids would hate it and refuse to eat. It really is a very strange combination of ingredients and I never had anything like it before. Well, it was just delicious! The kids and I couldn't get enough. I served it with hot, crunchy Italian bread. This is a great dinner for a cold winter night and I will be making it again and again.

Lovely Flavor. I used beef top round & cut them into 1-inch cubes, added fresh cilantro, 1 cup of diced canned tomatoes instead of tomatoe sauce, green pepper instead of red, 1 tablespoon of paprika, half a seeded & chopped jalapeno, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper,white pepper, and 1 cup of sherry instead of half. Came out DELISH!!!  Thanks for sharing.

I served this with Cuban bread (basically thin-crusted water bread) and went heavy on the olives and raisins.  Definitely little different and not exactly fast, but tasty nonetheless.

This was very good.  I wanted to slowcook it so the meat would be more tender so I coated the meat in some flour and browned it first in the olive oil, then placed in the slowcooker and added the other ingredients.  I didn't have a red pepper so I used a green one instead.  I didn't have any sherry on hand so I used beef broth instead and I accidentally used red cooking wine instead of red wine vinegar.  It didn't make a difference - it still tasted great.  The green olives and raisins were different and really good.  Thanks S. Shames!

Very good stew!  However, there are so many ingredients that yeild a VERY small portion!  This stew was not enough to feed 5 people.  I will just add more ingredients the next time:  I will add beef stock to add more volume, more potatoes and more beef.  I did add a little bit of frozen corn to add more diverse flavor and add a festive color to the dish.  It was very good!

This stew is fantastic! I got several comments like, "I can't believe I just ate a raisin in a stew on purpose," and "I wouldn't have thought I'd like olives in stew, but this is pretty good." It only took four of us to finish the whole pot. Also, I was out of sherry, so I used port. It worked out great. Definitely serve with fresh bread for sopping up all the great juices.

Very tasty even though I had to improvise a little because we didn't have Sherry in the house.  Cognac and a tablespoon of sugar make a nice substitute.

This is my favorite stew recipe.  I made a few changes, and won a chili cookoff contest - it was years ago, and I called it "Not A Missile Crisis" Chili (I had gone easy on the heat factor, teehee).  Do not leave out any of the ingredients - that crazy combination of olives, raisins, and capers is known as "alcaparrado".  I first used it in a fish recipe from the Victory Garden series (Cod Messina).  Consider doubling the recipe; you'll be glad for the leftovers.

This was really good. The recipe says to cook in a sauté pan. I wasn't sure how that would work once the liquid was added so I cooked the whole thing in a large sauce pot.  I did make a few modifications because I didn't have exact ingredients: I left out the capers and potatoes, used a scant 1/4 c. of sliced spanish olives because that is what I had on hand, used half sherry and half pinot grigio. I added about 1/2c. Chicken broth. At the end, I added a 15 oz. can of kidney beans that were drained and rinsed because I did not think there looked like there was enough for 2 servings in the pan, let alone 6-8. In total, cooked for 2 hours, Served over jasmine rice. Yummy. One note for those who thought this was too watery. In general, if you cook something uncovered, the liquid will evaporate. So, I suggest checking the stew about 1/2 hour before it is done and if it is too liquidy, uncover it for the rest of cooking time.

Wonderful recipe. I did everything like the recipe stated. Next time I will omit the raisins though.

I do not like raisins so I didn't add any. I know it adds a bit of sweetness to the stew so I added about a cup of apple juice instead. Having no dry sherry, I used orange muscat. The stew still turned out wonderful and flavorful.

As a time shortcut, I also added the potatoes before simmering the stew for an hour. That way, the potatoes were already soft when the meat became tender.

Wow this was a huge hit from 3 to 42 years old. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper. I suggest making Mojo as a condiment. One onion, 5 cloves of garlic, juice and zest from one lemon, 1 teaspoon cumin all put in the food processor until smooth.

Really great recipe with a wonderful taste.  I'm quite perplexed by some reviewers who say that this recipe lacks flavor.  I can only imagine that those people altered this recipe in some way...left things out.  Its important to note that red pepper, sherry, capers and cumin, along with everything else really, are very important to this recipe.  To be successful, you'll want to follow this recipe very closely. You might want to quarter a lemon/lime and serve it on the side as a condiment.  I'd suggest that you have some of your favourite hot sauce on the table when serving this dish to guests, as well

I was a little skeptical on how this would turn out but wound up loving it.  It was very flavorful.  I didn't have sherry and used leftover prepared tomato sauce instead of canned but kept everything else the same.

Wow, I don't know if it was just me and I did something wrong but this was just ok to me.  It seemed a little bland.  I took a few reviewers suggestion and didn't add the potatoes and even that didn't help.  OH well. :-/

The best thing for me about this recipe is that I don't have to think about whether I have the ingredients I need--in my house they are staples. This stew is how I start off the work week--Sunday afternoon lunch/dinner, leftovers Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...depending on how much I make LOL. Always tastes better the next day. This is the MOTHER of beef stews. Rich, with contrasting flavors, like sweet/salty, earthy/tart. 2 modifications to try: a teaspoon of ground cinnamon along with oregano and cumin, and then a splash of cayenne pepper sauce right before it's done. Serve over white rice, fresh salad and a side of tostones with garlic sauce. Thanks for sharing.

This is good as is.   5 stars, and worthy of serving to company who would appreciate  deep, rich, authentic flavors.    I made it as posted, no changes.  Use small potatoes or all the broth and flavor is gone.  Thanks for sharing! 
When it was done, the raisins had plumped back into grapes....very juicy.   Don't overdo the water.

This did not work for me at all.  I thought I was going to love it based on the high rating and I like olives and capers!  There was way too many flavor combinations in this.  Be prepared for a very different and odd stew!

This was an outstanding stew recipe.  I contimplated on whether or not I should add the raisins and capers because I didn't think my kids would like them but no one noticed once they cooked down.  This was an amazing dish!!

I made this dish once last year and loved it. I just remade it yesterday to see if it was selective memory or if it really was THAT good. Well, it is THAT good. Amazing stew. I read all of the other reviews and agree that keeping out the capers and the potatoes makes a more flavorful (not sour) stew. I also added 4 carrots (as did some other reviewers) and added them at the same time as the bell pepper. Definitely recommended. I will keep making this.

What a nice change from the typical beef stew recipe. Really enjoyed the different flavors in this. I used a London Broil, coated the chunks with flour and browned in a small amount of oil first. Then proceeded with rest adding the potatoes at the same time as the water and cooked for about an hour. Delicious!!

It was Ok but not as "to die for" good as I expected it to be. I used boneless beef ribs and cooked it in the crockpot. Maybe that's why it didn't jump out and knock me down but personally, I probably won't make it again.

Long overdue, but this is and always will be one of my all-time favorite recipes. I've always been a huge fan of dishes with plenty of acidity (e.g. capers/olives/vinegar), so it might not be for everyone, but my husband and I are obsessed and make a huge double-portion recipe every few weeks. Only thing I skip is the raisins.  Thanks to the author for sharing!

I left out the potatoes , halfed the capers and olives and subbed red wine for the sherry. I seasoned the beef with salt and pepper before cooking.

I made this with all the ingredients except for the capers  and  I used crushed tomatoes  instead of tomato sauce because I didn't have these items on hand.  The meat was very tender and the flavourful sauce was a nice change from typical beef stew with a meat broth gravy.  I served this with quinoa cooked in a vegetable broth.  I would definitely make it again!

I strayed slightly because I didn’t have red bell pepper, raisins or cherry.  I substituted cherry for some Malbec wine, used craisions (dried cranberries) instead of raisins and used green pepper rather than red.  I also added one medium Jalapeño to satisfy my man’s live for spice.   Delicious.  I might forego the potatoes and try it over rice or pasta next time.

Wow... this was  great, the flavors blended so well... The only thing that I changed was using spiced apple cider in place of the sherry because I didn't have any. I also served this with mashed potatoes instead of adding cut potatoes to the stew. I can't wait to make this again...

I left out the red peppers, capers, and potatoes (family preferences) and served it with yellow rice and black beans. The flavor of the sauce was so deep. We wanted to eat more and more, even though full. The one serving leftover was a prized meal! I really don't know why I waited so long to make this recipe.

Just fab!  I didn't have bell peppers but I did throw in some mushrooms.  We like spicy food so I also took other advice and threw in 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and used beef broth. Really yummy. Would totally make this again and again. We all (teens, hubby and I) loved it.

I used some leftover NY strips to make this. My family loved it. I substituted roasted red peppers in a jar because I didn't have fresh. And added beef broth in lieu of water.  Served over  yellow rice. This is a keeper.

I browned the meat.  Saute onions and pepper for 4 mins then added garlic and 1/4 tsp semi sweet paprika and 1/4 tsp hot paprika.  Did not add raisins.

Always looking for good dinner recipes. This was a nice blending of flavors. I made per directions, but used my leftover tri tip roast. I just added it cubed with the red peppers. I did leave out raisins.The only thing I wish I had is a piece of crusty bread. Yum!

I made it with cubed elk steak. I browned the steak and then simmered everything together (minus the potatoes and capers) in a Dutch oven for 1 1/2 hr. I served it over jasmine white rice and it was delicious!

I was more than a little disappointed in this beef stew.  I did everything as stated.  Even sent out my son for capers and olives.  The taste just wasn't there.

This recipe is a keeper! For my family's taste, I add a little more garlic, cumin and oregano. I do not care for cooked raisins and was pleasantly surprised that they mostly disintegrate into the stew. The depth of the broth is amazing. Thank you for your recipe!

This tasted just like the stew my roommate's Cuban grandmother makes. I really liked the raisins' slight sweetness and the richness of the sauce. I think this would make a great slow cooker meal, since my beef was still a little tough.
