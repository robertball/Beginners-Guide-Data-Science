Can't say enough about using the Basic Cookie Mix and customizing it!  This is now the family go-to recipe since you can mix up a big container full, stick it in the pantry and pull out and easily whip up a fresh batch of cookies anytime you want.  Going to experiment with pre-making some and freezing the dough to pull out a few at a time and baking next.
