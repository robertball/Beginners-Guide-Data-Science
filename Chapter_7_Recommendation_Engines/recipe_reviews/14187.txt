The husband gobbled up three servings! I did as others suggested and went with Key Lime Yoplait NonFat yogurt instead of Lemon, pecans instead of walnuts, seedless green grapes instead of celery, and mandarin oranges instead of a nectarine (but only because nectarines aren't in season). I cut up the apples and put the yogurt in right away to keep them turning brown, then put in the grapes. Don't put in the mandarin oranges, dried cranberries, and pecans until right before serving to keep the oranges from disintegrating (stir them carefully) and to keep the cranberries firm and the pecans crunchy. I strained the yogurt with cheesecloth, and I guess I needed to double the cheesecloth again because some of the yogurt went through. (If you don't strain the yogurt, some of the runny liquid accumulates on the bottom of your fruit salad bowl. Truthfully, I wouldn't know since the hubby wolfed it down so fast! :D)

I prepared a huges amount of this for a recent holiday open house and it was indeed fabulous!  I added green and red grapes and several types of crisp apples.  Also mandarin oranges and canned apricots (I'll leave those out next time -- too soft).  I followed another reader's advice and added the cranberries just before serving.  I would suggest you do this with the nuts too if you like chewy and crunchy.  The key, I think, is that lemon yogurt.  Seems no matter what fruit you use, that yogurt sets it off just right.  It reminded me of a wonderfully updated Waldorf salad.  There were no kids at my open house, so I have no idea if they would like it -- but I bet they would.

I also doubled this recipe and took it to Christmas dinner.  I used 2 red apples, 2 green apples, a can of mandarin oranges, celery, 1 container each of lemon and vanilla yogurt, and I added the dried cranberries and walnuts just before serving to preserve texture and crunch.  I received several compliments on the salad, and my husband loved it.  (For next time, I will probably strain the yogurts first using a coffee filter, as there was quite an accumulation of liquid at the bottom of the dish.)  Very enjoyable salad.

This salad is soooo refreshing. It has become a family favorite which they don't mind having 4 to 5 times a month. The lemon yogurt is great, but so is vanilla and key lime. I have also cut the sweetness of the other flavors of yogurt by adding a half carton of plain non-fat yogurt to the flavored one. By using half plain and half flavored, the taste of the fruit is allowed to shine through. YUM!

Wow! This definitely is "Fabulous Fruit Salad" bursting with vibrant color and flavor! I loved the crunch the celery and walnuts give this - it kinda reminds me a bit of a Waldorf salad.  I toasted my walnuts for a bit more flavor and used vanilla yogurt and added a bit of fresh lemon juice and lemon zest. Very nice presentation and definitely "holiday-worthy"!

We love this in the Gless household!  Fast, Easy and Good for you!  Try it with pecans and carmel yogurt.  Or, slivered almonds and vanilla yogurt.

This was so easy and SO good!!  I took it to a brunch that featured only breakfast foods (maybe we should have eaten earlier in the day- ha, ha!), so I skipped the celery and used mandarin oranges and red seedless grapes instead.  I also added the dried cranberries and walnuts just before serving.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks, Tracy!

Very yummy. Tastes creamy as if it were made with whipping cream, instead it's no-fat yogurt! A total success at our last BBQ. 

I substituted a lot of Tracy's fruits (added bananas, raisins instead of cranberries, no celery, no nectarines, added grapes and strawberries), but it was just as delicious. 

Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

This was such a quick, easy, and healthy recipe!  My husband and I loved it--fought over the left overs!  I left out the celery and walnuts then used a can of mandarin oranges instead of nectarines.  It was great!  The lemon yogurt is definately the must in this recipe!!

I absolutely loved this fruit salad.  Some fruit salads can be too sweet, but this one was sweet and refreshing.  Everyone I served it to had second or third helpings. I don't think I'll be making any other.

I have made this several times - and I always get requests for it.  I made a few changes to it.  I use the Yoplait Lite Key Lime Yogurt (this was a suggestion by a review posted back in 2005).   I omit the celery, add bananas.  Nectarines are hard to find, so instead I use mandarin oranges and sprinkle a little bit of coconut.  For cranberries, you can get the CranRaisins (available usually in the cookies/granola bar aisle).  It is yummy and makes a very decorative appearance.  I put it in a crystal candy dish (which is quite large) and it always delights the crowd!

I made this fruit salad for a recent party and it was very good.  This is a dish that should be eaten as soon as possible after being put together and I do not recommend making more than can be eaten within a 48 hour period, fruit is not cheap and a shame to waste.

I doubled this recipe and made it for our family Christmas dinner. People were fighting to take home the small amount left over after dinner! In addition, I got calls the next day asking for the recipe. It was a huge hit with my family!

Amazing!  I thought it was too simple and was a little nervous about bringing it to Easter Dinner, but it was a hit with everyone!  Everyone went back for seconds.  Definitely a keeper!  Nectarines were looking pathetic in the store so I used mandarine oranges instead and it worked beautifully!

My family really enjoyed this fruit salad. Especially my son & me who love fruit I was a little leary about using the lemon yogurt. It gave it a wonderful, tasty, creamy sauce. My son informed me, we have to serve this for every holiday meal!

This salad is very tasty, the cranberries really complimented the rest of the fruit. And the celery seem to bring out the walnut's flavor and also brought a nice crunchiness to the salad.
It also keeps well overnight - the apples didn't brown at all.

This recipe was so easy to prepare and came out so delicious. I tripled the recipe to feed a large crowd and used 3 different kinds of apples. The cranberries and nuts are the perfect compliment. It's a keeper. :)

This is perfect.  I have made this a few times, tweaking it a little each time.  The first time I made it I added the cranberries right before serving like so many have suggested.  The second I added it right away (I made it for a brunch the night before). I will say I prefer it being added at the beginning and not right before serving because they plump up and one may argue they absorb some of the liquid.  Just my 2 cents.

Yummy! I loved this recipe because it was simple, inexpensive but most of all healthy. I calculated the calories and it's only 90 calories for four oz. I only added one stalk of celery and used canned peaches since it's the dead of winter. This will be a staple in our house for afterschool snacks and as a side for breakfast. Thank you so much for sharing!

Very different taste from the same old fruit salad.  I enjoyed the combination of tastes and textures (although I did leave out the celery, which I detest).  A nice healthy addition to any meal.

I was looking for a fruit salad without too many calories and this was perfect! My husband watches what he eats so I try to look at the nutritional value of a dish.  He loved this!  Will make this on a regular basis.

I like this alot. I couldn't find a lemon yogurt so used lime. It was very good. Also, I would suggest using a yogurt that is NOT fat/sugar free. The textrue just wasn't the same.

I find myself using this recipe quite often for a great low-carb breakfast.  I use whatever fruit I have on hand and make enough to last a couple of days.  The nuts, cranberries, and yogurt make a satisfying but light meal.

Excellent!  Used vanilla yogurt instead of lemon (wasn't available) and canned mandarins instead of nectarine.  Tasty and satisfying snack food instead of reaching for a sweet!

I usually go for the real rich fruit salad with marshmallows...I never like anything that is on the healthy side.Well,This is DELICIOUS. I've made it twice & the second time used bananas & green grapes. I also leave the skin on.....for color.......yummy..a winner!

Hmmm. I didn't find this "fabulous" at all.... Other than being a new twist on the basic waldorf salad, this wasn't all that different from any other fruit salad I've tried. Reviewers comments about how the lemon yogurt added a nice creaminess and subtle, complementary flavor persuaded me to try this. In retrospect, I wish I would have gone with my gut and prepared an ambrosia salad to serve with Easter brunch as originally planned. The yogurt was the very thing I didn't like about this. It gave my salad a "pasty" texture I just couldn't get past. Other than subbing Greek-style yogurt (I feared a soupy mess collecting at the bottom of my salad bowl otherwise), I followed Tracy's directions to the letter. To my dismay, using Greek yogurt made no difference whatsoever and was a total waste of the extra $'s spent. My verdict? There are much better recipes on this site. I will not reattempt this one. Sorry! :(

Without the celery, this was perfect. Because we don't like walnuts, I used pecans instead. Really great fruit salad that we all enjoyed and left nothing behind.

This salad has wonderful texture with the nuts, celery and cranberries. Any combination of firm fruit would work well. Thanks for sharing, we really enjoyed this dish.

When I made this dish, I followed all the suggestions in the reviews and cut the celery in favor of grapes.  When I was finished, I took a big bite and immediately thought something was missing... *needs celery*.  If I were to make this again I would follow the recipe exactly as the original. Overall, I don't see what all the hype is about -- It's *okay*. As a side dish, this recipe serves way more than 4 people and I doubled the recipe so, unfortuately, I have a ton leftovers.  Also used pecans and mandarin oranges.  Pecans were good but be very gentle with the oranges as they will fall apart.

I was looking for a different fruit salad for a wedding reception and tried this.  Very good.  I toasted the walnuts and since I couldn't find 8 oz. of lemon yogurt used 2 - 6 oz. and it was great.  I also added 1/2 salad dressing for a little taste.  Will add grapes and canteloupe next time.

I thought it tasted just like fruit with yogurt.  I added strawberries which were good, but turned everything pink.  It's nice for everyday but not good enough for company.

This is essentially a "Waldorf Salad" - just fine but nothing special.  Also, it makes so much more than 4 servings - unless the servings are huge!

Took this to a family party and noticed all ages eating some of this salad! I toasted the walnuts before adding.  Because we had a little travel time, I sprinkled the cranberries on top of the rest of the fruit, with the walnuts layered on top of that.  Stirred it all up when we arrived and that seemed to keep the textures alive.

Loved this! I made it twice! Although, I did modify it the 2nd time. I used Greek Honey yogurt, pineapple, manderine oranged, banana, green apple, and a gala apple. I didin't have any walnuts, but I found that the apples and pineapple had enough crunch to them. Thanks! Amazing recipe.

This salad is wonderful.  To reduce sugar and increase calcium, I used plain yogurt and just added a dash of cinnamon and a squirt of lemon juice for flavoring (per serving).  I plan to make this weekly as a healthy snack to have on hand.  Sure, the recipe is not rocket science, but I wouldn't have thought to try it if it wasn't posted here, so thank you!

I loved this  and it was so easy to make.  I to substituted red grapes for the celery and used pecans instead of walnuts.  This doesn't keep well, it was real runny by the end of the next day.  Maybe next time I will wait and add the yogurt right before I eat it.  Its such a simple recipe and a great way to add fruit in your diet.

This was SOO good! Nectarines were not available so I substituted with strawberries. I also omitted the celery and added some grapes instead. I don't think it really matters what you put in this... it's the lemon yogurt with the walnuts and dried cranberries that really make it!

I used clementine orange sections instead of the nectarine, although mandarin oranges would probably be good too.  As I try to stay away/reduce sugar, I substituted nonfat plain yogurt, 1 tsp. of vanilla & 1 tsp Splenda for the lemon yogurt.  I suppose I could experiment & add some lemon juice.  I'd also use only one stalk of celery next time.  I may substitute grapes for the dried cranberries as well so there'd be natural sweetness instead of more sugar.  If you're going to serve this for guests, I'd suggest draining the fruit before serving & then adding the yogurt & nuts as it gets a bit liquidy.

An excellent, easy and well-received salad.  Were I to make it again, I'd eliminate the walnuts, I think, and add some grapes.

Substituted jarred apricots once and dried apricots once, instead of nectarines. Cranberries rehydrated after over night in fridge. Better to throw them in right before serving. Served it twice over the holidays. Everyone loved it!

My husband asks for this salad regularly . . . but without the celery.  My 4 year old won't go near it . . . I think the lemon yogurt is too tart for her . . . but I think it is wonderful and this will probably become a family tradition!

I made this pretty much as written, except I used grapes instead of nectarines (out of season). The nuts and celery are nice, and had the grapes had more flavor it would have been better. The lemon yogurt was a mistake. Too citrus-y. I will try again, but with vanilla yogurt and bananas, which would have given it a fuller, sweeter favor. I used a Fugi apple, which was very nice.

This was another big hit for my wife and me! I used plain Greek vanilla yogurt and it served as a great binder for everything. The celery gave this fruit salad a real kick and it has become our go-to dessert/snack. It was just as good the next day, and I just actually whipped up another batch. The crunch of the walnuts also add some real texture to it!

I've been using this recipe for years now because once I made it the first time it became a family favorite. It's my go-to healthy dessert. I use all flavors of yogurt (vanilla is an all time favorite) with apples and whatever fruit is in season. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Easy and quick. I left out the nectarines, and it was still great. I added green grapes cut in half to give it some different texture. I used 6 oz lime yogurt and 2 oz plain yogurt to cut the lime flavor a bit. The best part is the cranberries and walnuts!

Made this recipe today and it's very good and refreshing for a warm summer's day.  The only change I made was that I used Key Lime Pie yogurt instead of lemon - but only because I couldn't find lemon at the grocery store.  I was a little hesitant adding the celery, but after tasting it, I'm glad I did.  Will make again very soon!

Great fruit salad! I like the fact there is no sugar added and yet produces a sweet taste (no marshmallows). I used Greek yogurt, rather than regular nonfat lemon yogurt.

This is my favorite go-to potluck recipe.  I have substituted the nectarines when not in season with peaches and/or mandarin oranges.  Also, my husband and I didn't have quite enough lemon yogurt, so added in a little bit of strawberry to make up...AWESOME!  Make this one often.

Refrigerate it before serving!  I wasn't crazy about this recipe until I happened to put it in the fridge overnight.  Completely chilled, it was definitely the way to go.  Unless you're a huge celery lover, don't include it; the taste of it throws it off.  Add sliced almonds to chopped walnuts!

Terrific!  I follwed the advice of previous reviews and eliminated the celery, added grapes, and used key lime yogurt.  
It was even better the next time I made it- lost the grapes, and added blueberries!  Perfect!

I really enjoyed this fruit salad for breakfast and for mid-day snacks. My fiance loved it but thought the bitterness of the celery was to abraisive with the sweeter fruits. I'll definitely make this agin, however I think I'll substitute sliced red and green grapes for the celery.

The name says it all! I was surprised how great this was. The blend is just right. I used grapes, instead of the nectarine (out of season). But the celery blends well, and I loved the nuts and cranberries inside. And it is healthy to boot! My family ate it up.

fabulous with 3.25% yogurt, fresh lime or lime juice. Seasonal fruit. Walnuts are great or any nut/seed you like. Keep separate the crunchies, if prepared in advance.

Used all of the ingredients and also added mandarin oranges, sunflower seeds for more crunch and a tablespoon of sour cream to give it a little more 'twang with some left over super mini marshmallow treats. HEY....it works and the kids loved it! Oh yeah, i also used one fresh lemon and squeezed it over the entire bowl and mixed so it keeps the fruit from turning brown and adds a little more zing to the lemon yogurt!

Fed this to my girlfriend and coworkers last week, but I made a few changes. 

I made a double batch, so quantities reflect this: 
2 red apples, 
2 Granny Smith apples, 
0 Nectarines (out of season), 
~20 green grapes, 
1 cup dried cranberries, 
1 cup chopped walnuts, 
8oz lemon yogurt, 
8oz plain yogurt. 

First off, everyone loved it. Second, I would replace the Granny Smith apples with something else--the ones I used were a bit too hard for my liking. I used half plain yogurt because another review suggested it, and I found it worked well; the lemon flavour was a bit more subtle. 

All in all, very happy with this recipe and will make it again.

We made something this in a knife skills class I took, except we subbed chopped fennel bulb for the celery (worked out great for me - not a fan of raw celery, but I like fennel!).  I came across this recipes and loved the idea of adding nectarines.  I still went with fennel, though, and used vanilla yogurt with a touch of honey.  Nice as a snack, side or even a dessert!

Not sure if I did something wrong, but I wasn't wowed by this. Used pears, mandarin oranges, green grapes and pecans instead of nectarines, celery, and walnuts. I also used french vanilla yogurt.

Delicious!  And so easy!  The only thing I might change next time would be to cut back on the walnuts a little bit.  I couldn't find lemon yogurt so I used strawberry and vanilla yogurt (since I doubled the recipe).

This is easy & delicious.  I took it to a pot luck & there was nothing left to take home.  Several people asked for the recipe.

Lemon yogurt was almost impossible to find, and I'm not sure if it was worth the struggle.  Just your average fruit salad.

You can use whatever combination of fruit in this recipe (or yogurt) and it turns out awesome!  Yum!  So simple and easy!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I adjusted it slightly..... I used vanilla yogurt instead of lemonn, added grapes and omitted the nectarines.

Wonderful! I used what I had on hand which ended up being apples, bananas, (fresh)cherries, and cherry yogurt. I especially liked the extra flavor the cherry flavored yogurt added.

This recipe was quite good.  While it appears to need to be doubled, a single batch of it was plenty.  It's a keeper.

Served it at a baby shower and everyone raved about it.  I added strawberries, bananas, and grapes, and left out the celery.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, and vanilla yogurt instead.  I will make again for sure!!

I cannot get enough of this. I used grapes instead of nectarines, but can't wait for nectarines to come into season to try it with them. Recently I took it to a pot luck, and printed off four copies of it just in case I was asked for the recipe. I should have taken six.

Made this as part of a brunch for Mother's Day and it was perfect!  I did not use celery, I used grapes instead as suggested and found the perfect.  I used 2 fresh peaches as well and found the taste to be light and yummy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was pretty good, it was different than a lot of fruit salads, the lemon yogurt was a nice touch.  I should have left out the celery though, I just thought it was an odd taste and didn't really go with the rest of the flavors.  Also, I think pecans might have been a better nut choice.  I followed the recipe exactly except added grapes.

This recipe has been well received everytime I make it.  People can't believe that it is a low fat salad and are very surprised when I tell them the coating is lemon yogurt.

What could be better than just plain fruit showcased in a sweet, natural tasting dressing!  This recipe is great, so easy--just chop and mix the yogurt in.  Much better than those yucky fluff-type salads, and way more tasty than those with mayonnaise-based dressings!!

Wonderful!!  Subbed 1 cup strawberries for nectarine (needed to eat them) and 1/2 cup ff sour cream with 2 T. apple juice, 2 pkt Splenda, 1/2 tsp vanilla & 1/4 tsp cinnamon instead of yogurt (my yogurt was spoiled).   Absolutely delicious!!  Would be great for a holiday meal or a potluck!

We used a mix of fruit that looked fresh on the day we were buying - apples, bananas, cantaloupe, strawberries, cranberries, and mango, with vanilla yogurt and it turned out wonderfully.

This is a great fruit salad recipe as it serves as the foundation and extends itself to many variations. I added some spicy cashews and almonds instead of walnuts. We also put in a banana and mango slices. My daughter added peanut butter to hers and happily ate it (she is a picky eater).

I didn't include the celery (I never like celery in fruit salads), and I needed more than 8 oz. of yogurt. They didn't have 8-oz. containers at my grocery, so I got two 6-oz. and ended up using all of both of them because it just wasn't enough to use 8 oz. only. Even then, it was only so-so. I'll keep looking for a good fruit salad.

This was a decent but not fabulous fruit salad. I left the celery out because it seemed odd to me and I didn't have any on hand. I like the idea of using yogurt as a dressing, it would work with any combination of fruits. Thanks.

Delicious! I loved the lemon yogurt dressing. I couldn't find any good fresh nectarines as it is Feb. in Alaska so I just used grapes instead. That is the beauty of this recipe. You can totally substitute for seasonal fresh fruit. Or, on my case, whatever the store happens to have!

I love the tanginess of the lemon yogurt
too. A flavorful and beautiful dish.

Very versatile recipe, I changed a lot but unlike some people on here, I don't change the entire recipe then rate poorly stating that "It sucks" I thought some of my choices to change didn't work out so well but you can do much with this.

This was so good!  The only thing I did differently was to use frozen peaches in place of the nectarine since I don't care for them.  Gosh, it was good.  I am not a yogurt fan, but it was great here.  Yum!  Additional comments:  I made this a second time, still using peaches.  I had used up all of the walnuts, so I added pecans instead.  I used two tubs of yogart.  It was once again wonderful.  It will be a go-to recipe in the future as well.

I went with key lime yogurt (also make it with berry, but haven't tasted it yet), added green grapes, and used pecans instead of walnuts. Everyone loved it and it was nice not to have plain fruit salad again. Great fruit salad and it's still healthy. The celery gives it great texture. I added cranberries, nuts and oranges about an hour before I served it. Adding apples straight to yogurt did stop them from turning.

This was great!  My husband who earlier turned his nose up at the idea of fruit salad loved it.  My husband doesn't care for nectarines, so I used a can of mandarin oranges instead.  Otherwise, I followed the instructions exactly.  The lemon yogurt really makes this!

I didn't have a nectarine to put into this, but I loved it!  Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as it is written.  I will definetely make this again.  Even my husband who will not eat fruit ate a good size helping of this.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for the post- :)

This was good, but nothing exciting. I did leave out the celery because of other reviews. I also couldn't find nectarines, so I left those out. Maybe nectarines would have made it more exciting. I doubled the recipe because I was feeding 10 people, and there were a lot of leftovers.

Absolutely wonderful!  I used pecans instead of walnuts (because that's what I had on hand).  Either would work fine. The celery is a must.  I'm not sure why so many of the other reviews left it out.  Some of the reviews also suggested replacing the nectarines with oranges.  I suggest if you can't get nectarines use peaches, because of their similar texture and flavor. My 3 year old loves it... but then again her favorite flavor of yogurt is lemon.  I'm sure I will be making this salad many more times.

I adore this! My go to fruit salad that everyone thinks is fancy. Guess again! Now when I couldn’t get a nectarine, I threw in blueberries and sliced strawberries. Judge on color for the completed salad.. and use really good yogurt..

I’ve made three times now. So easy AND delicious. I use Cuties mandarins instead of nectarines. Use full-fat lemon or lime yogurt so it’s not runny. Big hit.

Instead of regular yogurt, I used Silk yogurt alternative (family member can't have dairy). Even added a little wheat germ and a little honey.

This is a hit at potlucks!  I doubled the recipe and used 1 key lime and 1 vanilla yogurt, instead of vanilla.  Also subbed 1 cup halved red grapes instead of celery and a 15 oz can of mandarin oranges instead of nectarines.  Also toasted the nuts.  Everyone loved it!

Followed the recipe, the lemon yogurt was good, but if I make it again I will add some additional lemon, seemed like it needed something or perhaps a some extra dried cranberries.  My 4-year old granddaughter loved it!

I made this for a ladies brunch yesterday and it was a big hit.  Used apples (1 fugitive,1 Fiji,1 Granny Smith) red grapes, green grapes, dried cranberries, celery, and walnuts.  Loved the lemon yogurt dressing. Very versatile recipe to make to your liking.

I used honey Greek yogurt to serve for Christmas...was asked to bring it for Easter. Very, very good.  Also used pecans because we have allergies to walnuts. For Easter I'm going to try mandarins instead of nectarines, and grapes added for another texture. Thanks!

Great! I served this with a wonderful Cioppino and it was refreshing and light.
