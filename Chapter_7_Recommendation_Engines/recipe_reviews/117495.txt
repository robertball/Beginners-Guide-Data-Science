I changed up just a few things. I used regular thick cut pork chops that I had on hand rather than buying a loin and I BBQed these because I have to make adjustments living in an RV. These are fantastic!

I have to tell you I was a little disapointed in this dish.  First, the marinade?  Was it?  With only 2T of lemon juice and the rest solid ingrediants I could hardly call it that.  I kept thinking the pork was going to add some juice.  Second the seasoning.  While I think there is a good base here my meat needed a lot more salt and pepper.  This might be a better recipe with more spice, but the way it is written NO!  The yogurt sauce was OK....I would cut down on the yogurt maybe to 1/4 Cup and add a lot more flavor to this.  Not bad, but not great. Thanks for sharing  I love to try new recipes.

I followed others' reviews and "marinated" the pork with more herbs and garlic than the recipe called for.  I also added salt and pepper.  Before frying, I dredged the cutlets in egg and then flour + pepper.  They turned out delicious.  I used minced garlic for the sauce instead of garlic powder, and I believe this made a huge difference.  The sauce was very good.

I think marinating the meat is somewhat unnecessary as the sauce is quite dominating, next time I will just season the meat while it is cooking.  The sauce is actually even better the next day.  We loved this recipe.

I chose this recipe because I wanted a new idea for pork.  It turned out well.  My husband loves pork and this dish impressed him.  The sauce is good, too.  Overall, this item was very easy to make and it took hardly any time to cook.  This is a great item when you're too tired to cook or out of ideas.  My pork came out a little dry--but I might have done something wrong along the way.

A nice recipe overall. I didn't have parsley and substituted cilantro, which worked but probably tasted less Greek. I would add a little salt to both the marinade and the cucumber sauce. I was skeptical that this recipe was going to work when I tasted the meat and the sauce separately, but together they did go very well.

The cook time (6 minutes on each side) was too long for me, resulting in pork that was overcooked. If I cook this again I will reduce to 4.5 minutes per side and then check to see if juices run clear. I think it should get 4 stars then.

I would rate this a 5 but the Tzatziki sauce is not made right. You must use greek yogurt for the right thickness and chopped garlic not powdered. Dill is a nice addition as well.
The sauce is best the next day.

I found marinating the meat almost 24hrs gave the best taste.
Broiled on low and turned it to high so it would not end up dry.

As far as the marinade, I added olive oil and A LOT more lemon juice to the mix. For next time the only change we would make is to grill the pork chops. The coolness of the yogurt sauce needs a counter balance to it and a smoky flavor from grilling would be perfect. Otherwise, this recipe is great!
