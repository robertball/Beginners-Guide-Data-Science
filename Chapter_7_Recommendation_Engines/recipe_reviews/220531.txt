The bread is delicious! However, next time I will bake it in a 9"X9" pan. After 40 minutes, the outside of the loaf was brown and beautiful, but the edges were overdone and the center was barely cooked at all. We cut away the edible parts and threw out the middle. Too bad! Will try it again, though.

With just a few ingredients, this recipe was a hit with me, my son & hubby both said, it was good. And since they are more the picky eaters in the house, I tried it on them 1st. The method of the steeping the fruit in tea was totally new to me and that's what drew me in to make this recipe. I used my Kuerig Vue, to brew 8 oz of Sweet Tea(it's rather stout and not very sweet at all). And my only dilemma was, that I tried locating some currants but couldn't find any available. I recieved some help from members of AR that have eaten currants to help with the flavor to sub with. I chose to sub with a half and half with regular raisins & cranberries. Kept the golden raisins the same. The whole recipe process was very easy. I even followed the parchment paper in the loaf pan. And had the correct sugar on hand as well, which is bakers sugar or sugar in the raw brand of sugar. This recipe totally will be made again. The sweetness from the tea and fruit were a surprise and it really is a nice change to regular raisin bread. It's very dense, like a soda bread. However, I loved the sweet & tart raisin taste, even the crust of the bread was nicely sweet. You have to try it least once. I'll make again, and can see using other fruit combinations as well. TY very much.

I found this to be delicious! I did change the recipe slightly though, I only used Raisins ( as that was all i had in my cupboard ) I added no sugar as i found the raisins to be sweet enough and i made my own self raising flour out of wholemeal flour and baking powder. I'm not sure if it is suppose to be moist on the inside but it came out the oven slightly moist which in my opinion gave it more flavour and texture. 10/10

Very simple recipe that yields a very moist and tasty bread. Picky eaters love it. I make this recipe about 5-6 times a year. It's mostly requested in the cooler months. I add a teaspoon of cinnamon when I remember. The recipe is good either way. I've also substituted regular raisins when I ran out of golden at home. My family likes the tea flavor, which adds the moisture to the bread. I typically brew 2 to 3 tea bags and let the tea cool before adding the raisins and currents.

Fabulous. I made this mainly as an excuse to use up ingredients in the house, so instead of demerara sugar, raisins and currants I used plain brown sugar, sultanas and dried cranberries, which I soaked in regular black tea. I'm a first generation Australian, but am getting into my Welsh culture so was really pleased that this worked out so well, even with the dabbling. Will definitely make it next time Mam comes to visit.

Perfection! Can easily be doubled! Don't over steep your tea, but do make it nice and strong to carry the flavor. 
I've done the recipe just as is and it comes out great. I've also made changes with equal success!
My changes:
*used Barry's Gold tea
*same amount of regular white sugar
*made my own self rising flour (only had all purpose on hand!)
*used a combo of regular raisin, dried cranberries and dried blueberries 
*made in mini loaf pans 

All that being said, I think this is an extremely good recipe and is adaptable to your tastes without losing the integrity of it.
