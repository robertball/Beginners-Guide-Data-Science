Good basic recipe to get ya going! Here are a few tips: you can use sour cream instead of yogurt. Either way, unless you are using Greek Yogurt (which is already drained) you must drain it. Spoon it into coffee filters or papertowels, set in a colander and then set all that into a larger bowl overnight in the frig. You also must PEEL, SEED and DRAIN the cucumber. After dicing it, wrap up in papertowels and squeeze the juice out or you will have a runny raita! Fresh spearmint and cilantro are a great combo for this sauce. Dried spices are not going to work. The cumin is a nice touch, even a little cinnamon (I mean a PINCH) and then top with ground sumac...this is pretty authentic and certainly refreshing for all kinds of summer cooking...lamb koftas, pakoras, anything spicy is better with this raita on it! This is my basic go-to recipe, I just add things for fun now and then...my favorite addition is plenty of minced fresh garlic, this will knock your socks off! Or chopped tomato, a green chile...Most important thing is to let it chill for a few hours so the flavors can mingle. It always tastes better to me the next day. My photo here shows this dish with ground sumac on top.

This goes well with any spicey food. I wanted it to be a salad so I cut the cucumbers into bite size chunks and used one English cucumber. I added one tablespoon of lemon juice. I agree with the parsley and cilantro amounts. I added less than a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin it seemed like too much for 6 oz of yogurt, it was approximately 1/3. I suggest you use greek yogurt and if not strain plain yogurt with a coffee filter or cheese cloth for an hour.

This turned out really poorly...I followed it exactly to the recipe too!  I found the cumin/mint/cilantro combination to be very strong.

I used plain Greek yogurt instead of plain normal. After seeding and dicing my cucumbers, I salted them and let them drain to reduce the watery aspect. Very creamy and delicious! Thanks.

I love this recipe as opposed to making the typical tzatiki, as the  diced cucumber doesn't make the dish watery the way shredded cucumber does.  I also double the mint in this recipe, and chop it very very fine.
