This was soooo good! I was skeptical, yet intrigued, so I just had to try this...We tried it both warm and cold, and enjoyed it both ways. I did use some regular hot sauce in place of the non vinegar based, b/c I couldn't find it, but just used the regular to taste. Also, I had some fresh cooked chicken breast, so I used that in place of the canned. I happened to have the chicken flavored ramen on hand, but I can't wait to try it w/ the beef flavored. Bd., Thanks for sharing this deliciously different recipe! :)

This definitely wins for most unique recipe at your next pot luck. I served it on gluten free toast, which I cut into fourths. Then, I served it over some green salad. People at my race day get together loved it, even though the kids thought it was too spicy. I may have exaggerated the jalapeños. I used gluten free rice noodles with homemade seasonings. It’s like a jazzed up chicken salad. In fact, I put leftovers on bread and ate it like a sandwich. Pretty good stuff! Thank you for the recipe.

I was hopeful this would be good, but I did not like it at all. Cannot recommend.

This dip is absolutely amazing! My family loves it and it's so easy to make. Also, it's very easy to doctor it up any way would like.

This was...intriguing.  I had some leftover rotisserie chicken to use up so thought I would give this a try.  I made only 1/3 of the recipe - 1 package of the beef ramen - and adjusted all the other ingredients.  This still made a big bowl.  If doing a party - I would still only do a third as part of a buffet of options. I chopped the chicken and used Cholula for the hot sauce which was what I had on hand.  After the first few bites we added in a big handful of shredded cheddar cheese.  That added a nice mellowing agent to counter the hot sauce without obliterating the heat. It was interesting and not a bad thing so on a table with other options it would be a good change of pace.  At the same time, if I were doing only one appetizer for a party this would not be my choice.
