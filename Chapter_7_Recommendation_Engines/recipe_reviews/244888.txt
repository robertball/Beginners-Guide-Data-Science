I made these today, and I modified it because I try not to use carbs. I used splenda(they have both white and brown follow directions,  each one is different) to replace both sugars,  and didn't find it was too sweet like the other review.  I didn't mess with the flour since it was such a small amount. One recommendation I have is to flatten after you scoop you dough. mine didn't flatten out like most cookies do. Once I did that with my second pan they turned out great.

I added extra oatmeal.  It seemed too thin.  The first batch of cookies spread out and were very thin.  After adding the extra oatmeal, they set up better.  Had to stop baking for a few hours and that helped the dough to firm up to a better consistency also.  I think adding the syrup helps make them “chewy”, something the grandkids like about grandma’s cookies! Thank You!

The cookies turned out wondeful. A tip though to anyone making these grease your pan especially if its a dark one.
