I made one batch of these and they were flat as pancakes but that was totally my fault.  They tasted good so I read a little tutorial on whipping egg whites and made a second batch that came out great.  The first time I used cold egg whites, wasn't that careful about separating and started on high speed which I know now is all wrong.  Thanks for a great recipe and a good learning experience.

After I'd read others' reviews, I used 2 Tbsp cocoa and only 1/2 cup sugar in my cookies; choc chips were omitted. Just the right sweetness and chocolatey-ness for me. On top of that, I didn't follow the instructions verbatim. I adapted instructions from other meringue cookie recipes to suit this recipe instead. First, beat in cream of tartar and vanilla when the egg whites become foamy; continue whipping till soft peaks form. When soft peaks form, gradually beat in sugar (a little at a time) to egg whites till they form stiff peaks and look glossy. I folded in cocoa lastly--don't overfold the mixture. Since this was my first attempt at making meringue, I was slightly worried. I wondered whether combining vanilla and cream of tartar with egg whites first will actually prevent the the egg whites from "growing" in volume. Separate the egg whites from the yolks right after the eggs are out of refrigerator. Then, wait to start baking when the egg whites get to room temperature. Also, make sure you use only grease-free metal or glass mixing bowl and beeaters for whipping egg whites. Finally, these cookies took longer to get done (for me), about 35~40 minutes; they're done when the tops of the cookies are kind of hard. I got about 36~40 of them with a teaspoonfuls for each. Overall, this is a wonderful choc meringue drop recipe--definitely a keeper! The best part is they're lower in calories than other cookies!

This is good! I used splenda instead of sugar, omitted the chocolate chips and I have a treat that is good for diabetics and lowcarb! All Atkins dieters should try this!

I doubled the cocoa in this recipe and it came out fine.  I also substituted chopped pecans for the chocolate chips.  Make sure they are completely cool before storing in an airtight container.  The slightest bit of dampness will turn these to chocolate marshmallows.  Delicious right out of the oven!

Great recipe.  These turned out wonderfully and were very quick and easy.  I did make a few changes to suit my personal taste.  I also read the article concerning making meringue.  I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and increased chocolate chips to 1/2.  I baked them at 275 because my oven tends to run hot.  I did have to "assist" the cookies off the cookie sheet.  I expected this due to the sticky nature of meringue and found that it was no problem, but may try parchment paper next time.

MMMMMMMM!!!!!  I'm not usually a meringue fan, but these are awesome!!  Easy to!!  I didn't change a thing.  For those having trouble with the egg whites, maybe you're just not beating them long enough.  It takes at least five minutes.  I baked for the full 30 minutes.  A must try.  Thanks.

These were awesome.  I think they'd be just as good without the chocolate chips.  I had to look up how to get your egg whites whipped into perfect peaks:  Make sure your eggs are room temp and add a pinch of salt to the whites before beating.  Start off mixing them at medium low speed and then halfway through add the cream of tartar.  Next, increase the speed and mix to stiff peaks.  Careful not to over mix or it will destabilize.

my daughter calls these air cookies. We buy them in plastic tubs in the deli section of the grocery store. These are so much better!!! They melt in your mouth . They are very easy to make and pretty healthy too compared to most cookies our family eats. Thanks Madonna!!

This was my first attempt of making anything with meringue.  SOME TIPS: When dividing the egg yolks and egg whites, separate them while the eggs are still cold, then leave alone & allow them to reach around room temperature before beginning to mix. If you get the least tiniest amount of egg yolk into the egg whites, ditch the egg whites and start all over! Also, it works better if you use a metal or glass bowl when mixing egg whites. Make sure all utensils and the bowl is free of any water, dampness, and squeaky clean! Otherwise, you will spend 20 minutes trying to get the egg whites to peak - and you may come close, but they won't peak without curling over! For more tips, google how to beat egg whites and you will get some good tips. So, I had issues and ended up using wilton's meringue powder, which worked very well.   Also, VERY slowly add the sugar - not too fast or you will have to start ALL over again!  Add a little more cocoa powder for a more chocolate flavor. Make sure the pans are thoroughly greased. Bake until tops are stiff. There should be no browness on the bottom of the cookies, and the cookies should easily lift off the cookie sheets. Be careful converting the cookies from the cookie sheet to the container (or the wire rack), they can crack easily.   I am not a big fan of meringue cookies, but these are pretty good! Oh, and the recipe made about 2 1/2 dozen cookies.

These cookies were excellent and, if you are on Weight Watchers, a very low-point, satisfying treat. Meringue recipes that I've made in the past called for drying the cookies in the oven overnight. This one doesn't and they're wonderful.

Sorry, but I must give this one only 2 stars.  There are too many tips/steps missing.  I am so glad I read the other reviews before I started to make these.  

I did the overnight method.  I pre-heated the oven to 350F, put the cookies in, turned the oven off after 1-2 minutes and left them in overnight.  So easy.

Fantastic!!! I made 12 servings and my girlfriend and I couldn't help ourselves....All Gone!!!   Changes:  2 tbsp Hershey's cocoa powder 1/4 c. Andes baking chips  I'd describe the taste akin to eating a campfire s'more with the crisp outside giving way to soft fluffiness inside. The texture was like eating cotton candy in the way it melted on your tongue which was surprising when considering the way they look from the outside.  Would like to know recommendations on how to get uniformity to each 'drop' for future bakings because the abstract shapes I got are not the most presentable.

This recipe was great! Like the others, I made some changes. I used only 1/3 cups of sugar and two tablespoons of cocoa powder. I also omitted the chocolate chips since it sounds sweet enough without them. I didn't have any cream of tartar so I substituted with 1/4 tsp. of lemon juice. It worked perfectly fine. I recommend anyone who hasn't really made meringue or whipped eggs before: separate eggs when they're cold (it's easier), let them come to room temperature (around at least 30 mins, possibly more), and avoid using plastic bowls. Add the sugar slowly, too. It can take around 5min for the eggs, so be patient! The baking time took at least an hour for me too, but I suppose it's dependent on every one's oven. I found that it's easier when you make smaller cookies, the larger ones I made take a little longer to bake (smaller cookies - around an hour).

Great cookie and very unique!!  I made about 8 batches of these cookies for a cookie exchange and by the eighth batch i think i got them exactly right!!  Definitely whip the meringue to STIFF peak stage (but not too dry).  If the meringue is not stiff enough it will flatten out and won't hold its shape.  Also, GREASE the cookie sheets really well and take them off immediately!  Thanks for posting!  Merry Christmas!!

Made and brought these to an afternoon party.  Everyone loved them!!  I did separate the egg yolks and whites and allowed the whites to get to room temperature.  I started beating them on low first to a foamy consistency then added the cream of tartar and vanilla and beat together until soft peaks form.  Then gradually add the sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.  I was careful when folding in the cocoa and chocolate chips.  I made them a little bigger so mine took about 40 minutes to bake.  I used parchment paper lining the cookie sheet.  Will make these again.

This was my fourth of fifth time making meringue and I usually use a different recipe, the one for Authentic French Merigues on this site. That recipe has always made my meringues perfect-airy, sweet, and pretty. These are, in my opinion, not sweet enough, not chocolatey enough, and i don't know what caused this (I followed the recipe exactly) but the center is sort of chewy. Never using this recipe again.

Great chocolate taste although I prefer them with 2 T cocoa powder.  I've made these several times and I find that they work best when you whip the whites until very glossy and almost hard.  The cocoa powder will be tough to fold in, but you can do it with the mixer on the lowest speed.  Also, if you prefer a crisper cookie (which I do), bake for about an hr at 250 and then turn the oven off and leave until they are cool.

I think these are one of those "stupid simple" recipes.  I did not add the chocolate chips but did increase the cooca (Hershey's Dark) by 1/2 Tablespoon.  I piped these out to look like kisses and baked for 20 minutes only and let cool.  Once cool they melted in my mouth.  I had only made these because I had some egg whites I had to use but these are going in my "cookie" gift boxes.  I used my KitchenAid mixer and beat the egg whites until they were "dry" and folded in the cocoa.....easy, BUT you have to make sure you beat the egg whites really good.  THANK YOU FOR SHARING....yum!

Easy, tasty, low-cal snack. Per other reviews, I used room-temperature egg whites, upped the cocoa powder to 2 TBSP and used only 1/2 cup sugar. I omitted the chocolate chips simply because I had none on hand. I made mine larger (~1 TBSP per each) and they required about 15 minutes extra cook time to reach the desired dry, crispy texture. Such a treat!

I thought these were great as is....But..I did add some mint instead of vanilla and a little extra cocoa and they came out perfect.  I would make these again - super easy and fast.

I will not use this recipe again.  I made the peppermint meringues (Kathy Brandt's recipe) just last week with great success.  I worried about the differences between the two recipes, especially the temperature and cooking time, but went ahead and made two double batches.  The peppermint meringues just turned out so fabulous and I was really looking forward to these.  

These turned out brittle at the top and chewy at the bottom.  Very few could stand up to even a very light touch without crumbling.  The crumbled scraps did taste good, but I can't exactly put them on a plate and serve them like that.  It seems the tops cooked and the rest fell to the bottom leaving an air pocket.  The bottoms of the cookies were like chewy marshmallow.  With the second batch, I tried leaving them in the oven longer as in the peppermint meringue recipe, but it didn't help a bit.

I see many people have given this recipe good reviews, so perhaps it is something I did wrong, but I doubt it.  The weather was not humid when I made them, I know how to beat egg whites properly, I followed the recipe to the letter.  I simply won't use this recipe again.

These cookies remind me of when I was little. When my mother ever used egg yolks in a recipe she'd save the egg whites and we'd make these. We called them Forgotten Cookies though, and did not put cocoa in them (both ways are good!). I followed this recipe but changed the baking to how I remembered us making Forgotten Cookies: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and when you put the cookies in, turn the oven off and "forget" about them for at least 4 to 6 hours, or overnight. Yes, you have to wait longer, but they cook perfectly! I snuck one out of the oven after 3 hours and they were still yummy. :)

Hi everyone, a lot of you complain that your meringues fell flat, so I want to explain why it might have happened.  Water/humidity is meringues worst nightmare.  The water makes them fall flat and be gooey and crumbly like a marshmallow.  The best weather for making them is a mild to cool day with limited humidity.  I personally will never make meringues in the summer.  I loved these and they turned out amazing!!!!

These turned out fabulous.  I only used 1/2 cup sugar as per some previous reviews.  I also didn't used the cocoa powder, as we just wanted chocolate chip meringues.  I baked these at 250 for 1 hour and then turned off the oven and left them for about another hour.  They are crunchy on the outside, just a little chewy on the inside with that little hint of chocolate.  And the best part - they're low in fat and calories!

These were delicious.  Everytime I make them they turn out different, but I think it depends on the weather, believe it or not.  I've gotten many requests for the recipe.  Thanks!

These cookies are great!  I have made them several times now and they always turn out perfectly.  I don't change anything about the recipe, either.  I think they are fantastic just the way they are and so far so does everyone who's tasted them among my family and friends. Thank you so much for posting them!

A quick tip to get those egg whites stiff: put your mixing bowl and mixer attachment in the refrigerator or freezer prior to beating the egg whites.  Take your eggs straight from the fridge; this is one time when you don't want all your ingredients to be room temperature.  I've made this recipe several times, as posted, and it always turns out great.  I like to use mini chocolate chips, as they seem to float inside the cookies.  Yummy!

These were yummy!  I modified based on the suggestions of another reviewer.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, boubled the cocoa (I used Frys), and upped the chips to 1/2 cup.  I added the cream of tartar and vanilla to the foamy eggy whites, and once I had soft peaks, I started slowly adding the sugar to a running mixer.  I was worried when I lost some volume while folding in the cocoa and chips, but they still turned out great.  I've been looking for a way to use up egg whites when I need a lot of yolks for home made ice cream.  Most ice cream recipes call for 8 yolks, so next time, I will try doubling this recipe to use up 6/8 egg whites.

I made these last night.  Very tasty and very easy to make.  I followed a couple of other suggestions, backed the sugar down to 1/2 cup and doubled the cocoa.  I think I might back the sugar down a little more and use the original 1 TLBS of cocoa, next time.  My husband LOVED them, they were like little chocolate clouds!!!

Excellent. Used a smidge more tartar since had fresh eggs from my chicks (won't get stiff w/out tartar), 2 TBSP cocoa, 1c sugar, etc.  Didn't need to beat for 5 minutes but beat till stiff. Cooked on parchment paper but still stuck---maybe wait till cool to try and take off next time.  yummy!

These were fun to make and fun to eat. Had I made them with the amount of sugar called for, though, I would've given them 2 stars due to over-sweetness. Instead I used just 1/3 cup of sugar, and along with the chocolate chips, they were plenty sweet enough. Also, like others, I baked them for about 1 hour at 250 deg.  I lined a cookie sheet with parchment paper (ungreased), and after a few minutes of cooling, they popped right off the parchment. So, this is a great recipe (halving the sugar, though!). Next time I'll leave out the cocoa, use almond extract and throw in some sliced toasted almonds and a little unsweetened coconut along with the choc chips.

I made these because I thought it was the same as an old recipe I used to make all the time but have since lost. Unfortunately, I found it isn't at all the same. The ingredients seem similar, but the end result is horrible. The cookies have a burnt sugar flavor, but besides that not much flavor at all. Additionally, the texture is terrible. I love merigue cookies, but these are chewey and hard and stick to your teeth something terrible. I'll go back to searching cookbooks for the old one I used to use.

I too have enjoyed store bought chocolate meringues, but found this one even more scrumptious.  Cookies need to be cooked at least the full 30 minutes, and even at that, mine were still a little gooey in the middle.  Using cooking spray, the meringues tended to

Very yummy! Thanks to all the reviewers with the great tips on beating the egg whites. I used my stand mixer and it was very quick and easy. I got closer to 30 cookies, and some of them were bigger than a teaspoon size.

These are wonderfully light and have a nice soft, not sticky chewy, center. Definately have to store in air tight container. I tried to bring some to work and just plastic wrapped a plate. They were a mess. Still tasted good though.  :-)

Delicous Cookies. Kids and husband loved them.  Very easy to make. I chopped my chocolate chips up into small peices first before adding them.  This made the cookie alittle crunchier.  I also put the batter into my cookie decorator and piped them out onto the parchment paper with the star tip.  Then I placed one chocolate chip in the center.  After all done I sprinkled them with powdered sugar and cocoa.

Amazing. The egg white/sugar mixture must immediately cook when you place the cookies in the oven because my batch was crispy on the outside and gooey from the chocolate chips on the inside. Awesome!

i only gave this recipe 4 stars because the cooking temp and time were all off for me. i don't know if i made them too big, or what, but i ended up changing it to 250 for about 60 min. they came out way better. the only thng is if you decide to double the recipe, make sure you can fit them all in the oven at once. the ones that i let sit out waiting for the others to get done, became really sticky, and i couldn't get them off the foil. maybe parchment would work beter, but i didn't have any. anyway, i made half of them vanilla, and half chocolate. i left out the chocolate chips. these cookies are a hit!

Great recipe! Cook for the ENTIRE 30 mins--mine were nowhere near done after just 25.  I baked them again for another 5-7 mins, but the oven (and cookies) had cooled completely.  They still turned out well, though.  I used a pinch of ovaltine b/c I didn't have cocoa powder, and they taste fantastic!

Although I like meringue cookies, these just didn't work for me.  They required a lot longer than 30 minutes to become crisp throughout, and some of them burned a bit on the bottom.  (It wasn't humid out, either).  I didn't think the chocolate flavor was strong enough, either.  I would not even play with the recipe to improve it, I'd just look elsewhere if I decided to make something similar again.

WOW! After falling upon this recipe I was happy to see I had all the ingredients and made a batch right away. They were light and fluffy and chewy and sweet and chocolaty!!! Double MMMMMMMM! I followed the recipe exactly except used mini M&M's instead of chocolate chips. Those that gave a low rating, maybe something was just not right but not because of the recipe! AWESOME!

FANTASTIC!

I do Weight Watchers, and have been on program for two years now, and whenever I crave something sweet, I would usually go out and spend about $5 on a box of Miss Meringues cookies.  I found this recipe and I haven't bought a box since.  They are so wonderfully chocolatey and even without the additional chocolate chips (which I omitted the first time I made them and included the second time), they are still wonderful.  The best part is that I can control what goes into them to make them sugar-free (by substituting Splenda), and I can have enough to satisfy myself for very few points.

Thank you very much for sharing this great recipe!

I followed recipe exactly, but as soon as I added the sugar, I lost my stiff peaks.  I kept adding pinches of cream of tartar and mixed a long time, but it was just glossy and smooth.  That didn't matter though, because the cookies came out wonderfully light, crispy and tasty!  I lined the cookie sheet with ungreased foil and after cooling, they came right off. My husband loves them and wants me to try a vanilla version.

I like the cocoa added. I make meringue chocolate cookies once in awhile.....usually let the in the oven overnight after 10 minutes and I don't make them when there is a low pressure weather front....egg whites don't seem to make peaks well during these days.

Awesome recipe!! However, I didn't use cocoa powder, but I added 1/4 cup of shredded coconut instead. Came out a little chewy but that's how I like them... Will definitely use this recipe again thanks!

This recipe is absolutely amazing!! The only thing that I changed was the amount of chocolate chips I added. You don't want the chocolate chips to rule over the entire cookie so I added a single milk chocolate chip to each little cookie morsel.

Other than the fact that I over beat my egg whites and basically turned them into frothy soup, these are very good! My husband has dubbed them 'the cotton candy of cookies'. I did put in a little extra cocoa, based on the recommendation of others, and I used mini chocolate chips. In spite of the cookies being generally pretty flat, they are very tasty and quite addictive. I will try this again!

I doubled the cocoa because I am a major chocolate lover and used mini chocolate chips mixed in. I loved these light, airy, crisp cookies. I did beat my egg whites when they were room temp which helps them the best meringue.

This was my first time trying a meringue I followed aa few of the other suggestions only using half a cup of sugar and adding an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder. They were a hit with my children with just enought sweetness and chocolate.

I followed the recipe and found it to be an unapologetic sugar bomb.  This was much too sweet for me.  If I make it again, I'll cut the sugar and cocoa in half.

These turned out great.  I had used yolks only to make a cake, and started looking around for a good meringue cookie so that I wouldn't waste the whites.  I let the whites sit at room temp for a while before starting.  I let the mixer do the work at medium until I got soft peaks, and proceeded as written.  I used a small disher to drop onto the cookie sheet - definitely more than a teaspoonful! :-)  Baked for 30 minutes and got dry, crisp outsides with just a little chewiness in the center.  Very good!

I too made these with Splenda. I used almost 2/3 of a cup and placed one chocolate chip on top of each cookie. I was afraid that mixing the chips in would deflate these delicious morsels. They baked to perfect crispness in 30 minutes and by using the parchment paper they didn't stick. In fact they almost slid off the paper when I took the pan out of the oven.

These are amazing! I expected the kind you buy in the store - no a chocolate filling was so yum. I started tasting when they were warm and had to force myself to stop! I didn't realize till to late - I mixed the sugar & cocoa together then saw they ere supposed to be separate. They didn't beat up as high peak but they were great anyway.

These are just what I was looking for. I had these cookies as a kid and was excited to find a recipe. I used the same suggestions as the folks below and they turned out great. I piped them out of a baggie and made them more of a bite size cookie. Perfect for snacking!

I was nervous about making these...meringue just seemed so fussy...but they're easy, really!  I was so impressed with myself!  I even goofed the first time and used too much sugar (3/4 cup).  I used 3 oz. bittersweet baking chunks instead of the chips and processed the sugar in the food processor to make it "superfine".  I took the advice of others and baked at 250.  They went 50 minutes before I had to leave the house, so I turned off the oven then and let them sit in the cooling oven.  I think that they're much more forgiving than you might think.

I really love these.  I didn't get fancy or anything and I still really loved them.  I did put them in the oven at 250 degrees for an hour as others suggested, and some were still chewy, but I really like them that way.  I doubled the recipe and also doubled the cocoa.  Yum!

I have been making these cookies from this recipe for several years now. Whenever I ask the kids (grown up ones inhcluded) what they want me to bake this is what they ask for. Deep dark and delicious double chocolate and a flawless recipe. Thanks.

I use gluten free organic ingredients!  My family loves these cookies.  We bring them to family gatherings and they quickly disappear. I remember calling them "pink cookies" as a child.  Don't tell grandma, but these are even better with the cocoa powder.  I use slightly less sugar and sometimes add chopped pecans.

These are exactly as described...super light and completely guilt free.  I too doubled the cocoa and only used 1/2 cup of sugar which was perfect.  This was my first attempt at meringue and it turned out beauifully!  Thanx for the great recipe

Wow! A really easy, fast and elegant cookie. I was making Aracely's Flan and needed something to do with the 10 extra egg whites. I saved them in small ramikins of 3 eggs each and made 3 batches of these cookies:  some for a New Year's party and another couple of batches later in the week.
I cooked these according to the instructions at sea level and they were a bit chewy in the center. I tore them open instead of biting them and they did seem cooked-- just an odd texture. Biting them squished them in a way that made them look kind of raw. If you want it crunchier then listen to the instructions in the other reviews.
Thanks so much for this recipe!

Delicious!!!  I didn't have any cream of tartar so I substituted 1/2 tsp of baking powder and it worked great!  I also held back just a little on the chocolate chips. I medically have to be on a low fat diet and these cookies are wonderful for that chocolate craving!  Easy to make and my husband, kids, and even the neighbors loved them!

A simple, basic recipe that turned out only OK.  These didn't bake well at such a high temperature and quick baking time (for meringues).  Also, the vanilla was too overpowering.  Will not be making these again without a few changes.

These cookies were great. We made our first batch using teaspoons to form the  cookies. The second batch we used a pastry bag to shape the cookies. It was easier and the results were quite presentable. The kids made the second batch with the pastry bags and they looked neater than mine. It was easy and fun to do as a group.

Very sweet and very chocolatey. Don't make these if you don't have a very sweet tooth. For chocolate lovers and meringue lovers these are great, I will make sure to keep them much smaller next time I make them.

Great recipe !  I had to extend the baking time by 10 min, but other than that, my cookies turned out wonderfully !  We don't normally like meringues !

These are really GOOD!  I made them according to the directions and they came out great.  My 12 year old said they tasted alot like chocolate chip cookies.  These are fast and easy to make.  Whisk beaters on my electric hand mixer made whipping the eggs go faster.  For those who had trouble, make sure your bowl and beaters are very clean with no residue.  I'm making these for Christmas for sure.  Great recipe.

nice and easy, even though i had to hand beat the eggs (whew!).  the second batch, i added coconut and only put a chip on top.  Next time, i'll reduce the sugar because the coconut made it a little too sweet.  thanks for the recipe!  thanks for the earlier tip about using foil.  the meringues were easy to peel off, and the clean up was minimal!

Easy!!! These cookies are excellent and very easy to make.  Next time I will make with splenda and walnuts instead of chips for an atkins treat.  But, for the children, this one is excellent...

These are super easy to make, but you have to make sure that you either spray the cookie sheet well or use parchment paper. They taste great and are guilt-free.

Turned out great. Here are my notes for next time I make it:

(1) Separate egg whites while cold, then let the whites come to room temperature before beating
(2) Use superfine sugar (if you have it)
(3) Use a Silpat or parchment paper instead of greasing cookie sheets
(4) Cook in oven at 250F (lower temp) for 40 min, then turn oven off and let it sit in the oven closed for 1 hour
(5) I'd probably omit the chocolate chips next time.

One more tip:
They don't spread out while baking, so you can put them really close together on the cookie sheet.

I've made this recipe several times.  I normally wait until the egg whites have come to room temperature.   I make no adjustments to the recipe except for using 1/2 cup sugar.  I normally use our fresh chicken eggs. 
I decided to try just as the recipe states except for the sugar part and used fresh out of the refrigerator eggs. I separated the whites and didn't wait at all. 
I put the egg whites in the mixer with the whisk attachment. I started it on slow for about 2 minutes, then added the tartar and vanilla.  Then I put it on medium speed and let it go for almost 6 minutes before I had the soft peaks.  I added the sugar slowly while it mixed, then let it run for another 5 minutes, maybe 6 and had stiff peaks. I folded in the cocoa powder (out of chocolate chips) and they turned out perfect.  It just took longer to get to the soft and hard peak stages.    No more waiting needed, just let the mixer do the work while you do some other things.   Delicious and perfect.

Hubby thought these were the best meringues we've made from this site. I think it was the chocolate actually, because they came out of the oven with holes & they crumbled really bad.  I will try leaving the chocolate chips out & put them on top when taking out of the oven next time to see if that is better.

I, my husband and our extremely picky 4 year old, absolutely loved these! I made them with zero cal sweetener and less then a 1/4 cup mini semisweet chips, and it made 19 "cookies". They came out to about 11 calories a peice!! They didn't last the night, just hours later they were devoured! Our 4 year old kept sneaking into the ekitchen and snatching one at a time! Lol they are so light and fluffy and very full of taste!! Yummmmmy!! :D making a double batch today!!

Use parchment paper, use a metal bowl, mix sugar in very slowly or by the fine sugar or you can use a food presser type thing to make the sugar fine. Like others have said use more cocoa for a more chocolate taste. And bake longer at about 250 I thought it was odd when I saw 300 for 25/30 min not long enough unless they are very small, they should pop right off the parchment paper when done!

This was great! The only thing I did  differently was I roughly chopped the chocolate chips so that they werent so over-powering in the cookies. Next time I think i'll use mini chocolate chips instead. I found these to be perfect little chocolate bites.

Fantastic!!  My variation was only 1/3 cup sugar plus 2 Splenda packets.  Perfectly crispy on the outside chewy center, just the right amount of sweetness.

Never made meringue cookies before.  I have bought them before and these were way WAY better than anything you buy at the store.  Straight out of the oven they tasted like chocolate chip cookies.

These cookies are delicious and totally guilt free. I also used less sugar 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup Stevia, i also double the cocoa and they are fantastic! My husband and i have made these 3 times this week. I also substituted the cream of tartar for vinegar and they turn out great.

Yum! I folded the choc. chips in with 2 Tbsps coco powder and a bit of cinnamon.  Used only 1/2 cup sugar and would use less next time.  Also chopped a few up with some nuts and sprinkled on top for a garnish.  Baked at 300 for 35+ minutes.

Great recipe! The cooking time is off. I cooked them for 35-40 mins. Other changes I made~ 1. The egg whites at room temp. 2. Lowered it to 1/2 cup of sugar 3. Doubled the cocoa to 2 tablespoons.

i double the cocoa, halved the sugar, and left out the chocolate chips (b/c we were out!) and sprinkled crushed peppermint candy canes on top instead. very good. rather than dropping by spoonfuls, i cut 1 inch off the corner of a zip lock bag, filled the bag, and used it as a pastry bag. the meringues looked beautiful, and i could make other shapes.

So yummy, light and great for me gluten intolerant friends.  Huge a hit at a girl's party!  I added another tablespoon of cocoa as suggested by others and would probably omit chocolate chips next time.  Served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream!  Wonderful!

these are perfect to take to a holiday dinner!  They are so light and yummy-and you don't feel as if you can't eat dessert due to a huge meal-because these are soo light!  I did use eggology egg whites to speed up the process and because they are organic and pasturized, not to mention, they whipped up perfectly!

People loved these at my party. The first batch I made I used a spoon and felt they weren't so attractive, so I made a second batch that I piped. People didn't care how they looked and ate each equally. 
*I didn't use chocolate chips on top, and did add some cinnamon. I also baked the second batch on parchment paper, which I think made them better, but again, people like each equally so maybe I'm just picky.

I made this recipe last night and it was excellent- I was impatient and pulled them out at 25 minutes, so the centers weren't quite done, but they were still delicious and airy and just wonderful.

Tonight, using the same implements, ingredients, and technique, they turned out flat as pancakes. Still delicious, but pancakey. The weather is still cool and dry, so I don't think it was that.

I guess the moral of the story is that meringue is a fickle dish. C'est la vie.

I made this recipe today.  It was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  I liked it because it didn't have any flour, was easy to make and had less calories/carbs than regular cookies.  When I want something sweet, this is what I will make.  Thanks!

I think we would have liked these a lot better without the cocoa powder. For us it made the meringue bitter. I'm not giving up though will try again with just the chocolate chips. Will let you know how I get on. For the time being thanks.

A little on the sweet side.  The next time I'll cut the sugar in 1/2.  Otherwise good texture, good color, easy to make, didn't run into others on the pan (stayed in original position).  Glad I tried this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and these did not turn out good.  Not much flavor to these.  I dropped these by the teaspoon and they just didn't want to cook all the way through.  Made a 2nd batch and made the cookies much smaller and still didn't come out nice. I've had much better meringue cookies.

Made exactly per recipe. Turned out great. I dusted the tops with a little more cocoa to make them pretty. Very easy and worth a try. I've always been a little scared of meringues but will definately make again. Oh and everyone wanted the recipe and were impressed that they were diet friendly!!

These were too hard to make.  I burned a batch, so it's probably not this recipe, but rather my ineptness with meringue.  However, I'll just stop trying to make them and buy them at the store.

Did not make any changes.  Baked for 35 minutes.  Took about 10 minutes to beat egg whites from soft peaks to stiff peaks.  Wonderful taste.  So glad you had this recipe.  It's easy, and the meringues are delicious!

Really like these and they were a big hit at my New Year’s Eve dinner! Using a proper mixer helps get the consistency of these perfect. Instead of folding in the chocolate chips I put them on top before putting in the oven.

Giving it three stars because as soon as I saw "preheat to 300" I stopped reading - I've tried a couple different meringue recipes that cook them for a shorter period at a higher temperature and they've always collapsed. Instead I just used this as a guide to how much cocoa to use and added it to a standard meringue recipe I've had success with. While obviously this method has worked for some people, meringues need to be cooked LOW and SLOW (I do 225 for an hour to an hour and a half depending on size) and then left in the oven until completely cool if you want to have the best chance of them keeping their shape and staying crisp. Adding the cocoa powder and chocolate chips to a standard meringue recipe turned out pretty good, but some of them were "collapsed" and chewy on the inside (even though the outside kept its shape) and this seemed to happen most often with meringues that ended up with  more than one or two chocolate chips, or had chocolate chips close to the center rather than close to the edge, so I'm guessing the melted chocolate is at fault. Next time I'll just sprinkle mini chocolate chips or chocolate shavings on top instead.

Amazing recipe and super easy to make! I doubled this recipe and it made so many cookies, probably at least 60 (5 full trays).  Listen to the reviews! I followed the tips and I added the tartar and vanilla first while the eggs were beating and then added everything else slowly. Put the batter in a plastic ziploc and just squeezed out the cookies on the cookie sheet. Looks super cute packed in a big mason jar!

Very pleased with this cookie.  Had to get rid of some older eggs - doubled the recipe with no problems.  Chopped some chocolate wafers instead of chips.  Piped them on to the cookie sheet and was a little worried about the "poop" look of them, but no worries they cooked into a nice smooth meringue top.  Made this cookie along with the Lemon Egg Yolk cookies from this site to use up the leftover yolks.  60 cookies.

These were delicious!  Be sure the egg whites are at room temperature, beat them at medium speed until frothy, then add the cream of tartar and vanilla, and slowly add the sugar.  Put the meringue in a large ziploc bag, cut off the corner and pipe onto the parchment lined baking sheet.   After the meringues are baked, shut off the oven and let them cool down and dry out for a couple of hours.  Also good without the cocoa for plain meringues and you can sprinkle them with coloured sugar.

This is my new favorite recipe. I have made it twice. The first time I brought them to a meeting and the whole batch disappeared. The second time I brought them to a friend's. Everyone there raved about them and when I visited a few days later they were still talking about them.

This recipe makes just the right amount to fit on a cookie sheet, and doubling it still fits perfectly on the oven racks. Amazing.

However, I did use 2-3 times more cocoa powder than called for because I'm addicted to chocolate. If you just leave it in the oven for a few hours once it's finished baking, it cooks perfectly into a delicious, crisp, airy cookie.

I made two batches of these cookies. The first I used regular sugar, as the recipe states. The cookies came out great. 

Then I made a batch using Splenda for my diabetic friends and they didn't rise at all. It was weird. They tasted ok but didn't look near as good as the sugar version. They just baked in the state they were dropped on the pan.

I found this recipe to be a bit bland.  Next time I would add 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract for a chocolate peppermint flavour.  Texture was good, and keeping them in an air tight container keeps them crispy.

Mine also came out flat--I failed to read the reviews before attempting (I had some egg white to use up after using only yolks for custard).  A little meringue lesson would be kind--esp. the part about getting whites to room temp.

This turned out perfect!! I made it exactly as it said and made sure the egg whites were well whipped just like if you were making meringue for a pie. They expanded well and were so good thou I did not put in the chocolate chips.

I made this with my friend, and we found that you definitely need to bake them for longer than 25 minutes, and that the chocolate chips won't go through a piping bad, so either use a cookie scoop or leave out the chocolate chips.

These were wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly delicious!  Just make sure to whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form and if you GENTLY FOLD in the cocoa and chips  they shouldn't fall flat.

As someone who does not cook very much, I loved it. It is so easy to make and clean up, plus it tastes so good. I did not put in two tablespoons of cocoa, but it was still good. If you do not have cream of tartar, you can replace it with white vinegar. This is perfect for people just starting to cook!

I used room temperature egg whites, beat on low speed until frothy, then added the sugar little by little and increased the speed to medium high.  I also baked them at 250 for a bit longer, if the oven is too hot I find the meringue has a slight burnt taste.

I made these for a cookie exchange at work and everyone loved them.  I watched a You Tube video on how to make meringue cookies and it said the key is to add the sugar a tablespoon at a time and beat it until you can no longer feel any grains when you rub a little of the batter between your fingers.  It also said to get that crunchy outside/soft inside taste you should bake the cookies at 300 degrees, turn off the oven and let the cookies sit in there for at least an hour as the oven cools.  I also took the advice of another user here to use less sugar so I only used 1/2 c rather than the full 2/3 c and they were delicious!  Definitely sweet enough with the 1/2 c.  If my daughter had her way I would be making these once a week!  Enjoy!

I added a pinch of pink salt too. Really bumps up the chocolate! Plus I'm on Atkins, so I substituted a stevia based sweetener.

I didn't care for this recipe.  The batter was so flat and slimy and watery that I could barely do anything with it.  Btwi have no idea how they got theirs to look so good in the photo cause mine were so incredibly dark from the cocoa powder.

Very yummy. I made recipe as written. This is the first time that I have made meringue. I will try the overnight method next time. They collapsed and didn't come out quite right. Still yummy though.

I had white eggs to use up.  Although it held nicely,  the taste and texture seemed a bit differently from the real meringues.

This is a good recipe that my coworkers enjoyed.  I omitted the chocolate chips and doubled the cocoa powder--this made them lower calorie and no-fat.  Glorious!  I had a couple of sugar granules not melt into the meringue, but I already had very stiff peaks and was afraid of over-beating.  Next time I may use powdered sugar to facilitate melting.

I will agree that these are far too sweet.  Less sugar and even a little espresso would help tremendously.  The texture is okay once they cool (to be fair, I made them bigger, turned down the oven in the last 10 minutes and then turned it off and left them in there for half an hour), but they're just far too sweet.

Did as some other reviewers suggested and reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, used mini chocolate chips, and followed reviewer #8's tips on beating the almost room temperature egg whites.  Finished product is super delicious!

3.5 stars. Followed the recipe exactly, and it was very easy to make! Unfortunately, the meringues were far too sweet and I got sick of them after eating three 1-tps sized cookies. Cookie was crispy on outside and gooey on the inside!

AMAZING!  I made these for my gluten free husband and I wasn't expecting to love them because, in general, I'm not a huge fan of meringue, but OMG!  The outside shell was light and crunchy and the inside was fluffly and chocolatey... Delicious!  The only things I did differently (because I'm a chocoholic) is add a slightly larger amount of cocoa powder and 50% more chocolate chips!

These are very tasty, easier to make than most meringues I've tried and just as good. Just be sure to let the egg whites warm up to room temp first, and they will whip up beautifully.

Not impressed. I left the cookbook I usually use for meringue cookies at home when I went to my mothers house for the day, so i thought I would look up a similar recipe to try... not a good idea. Although they seemed okay when i took them out of the oven, when I tried one it was a normal, crunchy shell, with an unpleasantly chewy center. I may have screwed up when I was making them, but if I did I have no idea what i did wrong. The recipe I usually make turns out crunchy, but still melt-in-your-mouth, with an awesome chocolate flavor... I think I'll stick to that one.

Made these for a movie night with friends, and they were a HUGE hit!  I followed the recipe, except I doubled the amount of chocolate chips.  I would definitely recommend having your eggs at room temperature.  Also, don't whip egg whites in a plastic bowl.  Use a metal or ceramic one.  I had stiff peaks in 5 minutes. Thanks for a tasty, easy recipe.

I also had difficulty forming stiff peaks.  I believe my problem was that the whites were refrigerator temperature and needed to be closer to room temp.  Regardless, the cookies were amazing anyway.  I substituted peppermint extract (2/3 amount) for the vanilla, which I highly recommend.  The peppermint chocolate with the chocolate chip combination is to die for.  This is one of my new favorites.

These are the best cookies i have ever eaten in my life! i made 2 batches of 12 and the first 12 weregone within 5 minutes of cooling. my family is superrr chocoholics so i added an extra tsp of cocoa. the first 12 were a little soft in the middle. i cooked for 25 minutes and added an extra 5 after reading all the feed back. for the second batch i did a little more than 30 minutes (my cookies were a little on the larger side) all i altered was the cocoa and a littttttle extra sugar. i always bring big hit desserts to my boyfriends family party...i know exactly what to bring to the next one.  if your looking for big hits also try mini cherry cheesecakes, dirt cake, raindeer poop(or also instead of balls make bars)either way a huge hit, and snowman pops for the kids. ive yet to be a disappointment with dessert. thanks for the advice. :o)

Yummy!!

I made the mistake of not greasing my non-stick cookie sheet because I thought it wasn't needed; here's a hint - spray a spatula with cooking spray to get them off.  I may have beat the egg whites too long, as my yield was way more than 18 cookies and I was dropping them by heaping teaspoons.

They are light and sweet; maybe next time I'll reduce the sugar.  The chocolate was just right, but then again I'm a chocoholic ;o)

These cookies are great!  Nice and soft on the inside with great chocolate flavour.  I followed other people's advice and increased the cocoa to 1 1/2 tbsp. and the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup.  My husband liked them too and he's not a meringe fan.  Thanks for posting!

I am giving this recipe 4 stars, even thought the way I made them only deserved 2 stars. I would not recommend substituting the Splenda in for the sugar unless you don't mind a strong aftertaste.  I sub it a lot and don't usually mind it, but this time it was a detriment to the cookie.  I am sure this recipe would have been great with sugar.

I followed the directions but these did not turn out well. Will never make them again. This is the only recipe I am giving 1 star to among all the cookies I have tried this holiday season.

did not go well at all for me. Either I used the wrong type of sugar, or messed up on the cooking. Cookies would not come off of pan, and I added more sugar at the beginning hoping to thicken up the mixture which was not forming stiff peaks whatsoever. The crumbles that I got off of the cookie sheet were delicious though! Wasn't expecting them to be so delicate or hollow. Will double check the recipe next time.

Great melt in your mouth chocolate taste.  I was not expecting them to be hollow, but my children loved them!

These were delicious and so quick and easy to make.  Next time I will add about another 1/2 Tbsp. of the cocoa powder.  I used mini chocolate chips.  I found I needed exactly 30 mins. to bake these.  The first batch I only baked for 25 mins. and when they cooled, they were tacky to the touch and stuck together in the cookie jar.  At 30 mins., they came out perfectly!
