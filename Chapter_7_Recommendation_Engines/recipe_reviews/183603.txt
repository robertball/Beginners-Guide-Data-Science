Too much cream cheese for my liking. Next time I'll add the entire jar of sauce and use a milder cream cheese and half as much.

Great recipe. Definitely full of flavor! Like another reviewer, I used the entire jar of Newman's sauce (and couldn't find Bombolina sauce so used another kinds of Newmans instead). I bought a bag of frozen all ready cooked, deveined, and shelled shrimp, which greatly reduced prep time. The pine nuts were a nice addition but could be left out (if you don't have any) and it wouldn't affect the overall flavor much. I also used whole wheat penne pasta and it was still yummy. Thanks!

This dish was amazingly addictive. However I did as instructed by other reviews use the whole jar of sauce. Also I used canned diced tomatoes instead of sun-dried tomatoes, but that was because I prefer that kind, and it went really well with the dish. I did also use more garlic cloves too, about 5. Will make this again in the near future.

I don't know where to start with this recipe other than it looks as bad as it tastes.  The newmans sauce (or any red sauce for that matter) and sun dried tomatoes is too much tomato flavor together.  The addition of cream cheese makes the sauce so thick that I couldn't imagine serving it over pasta.  I tried to thin it out with some 1/2 and 1/2 and a little water.  It did help thin it out and unfortunately did not change the flavor.  I have another Newmans Own recipe that I was going to try tonight, but now I'm hesitant.  Don't waste your time or money with this one.  There are too many other delicious recipes out there.

This is delicious!  I made it without the nuts and didn't miss them at all.  This recipe makes enough to serve six, especially if serving it with a salad and some bread. I did use the whole 16 oz package of pasta. It has a great flavor to it!!

This was delicious the only thing we would change is mixing the parsley in with the sauce so it will talk to the shrimp.  This receipe would be great by substituting the shimp with chicken.

I think that this would be even better with capers rather than pine nuts.  I'm going to try that next time.  Pretty good though!

This  was easy to make and turned out fabulous! I made it for company and everyone raved. I'm just a run of the mill cook, so this was fun to try, easy to make and soooo yummy! Recipe says it yields 4 servings, but they were BIG servings. Give it a try - you won't be sorry!

This was wonderful. I didn't have the "named" ingredients on hand, but close enough substitutes. Also added fresh corn on the cob which I had taken off the ear and also some peas to get some greens in my kids.

Outrageous!  We loved this recipe.  I strongly suggest making it for company and plan to myself when the occasion arises.

VERY TASTY!!! I used already cleand/peeled/devined shrimp to cut the prep time, and a whole box of penne pasta. Made with garlic bread and a ceaser salad. Did without the nuts, and used the whole jar of pasta sauce. Will try to make it with chicken next time.

Yummy! Couldn't find the Newman's Own Bombolina Sauce, so I substituted a jar of chunky sauce I had in the pantry. I doubled the mushrooms!

This was delicious!  I made it just as the recipe called for, with the exception of using walnuts as I didn't have pine nuts & Neuman's Own Roasted Garlic flavor as they didn't have Bombonlina.  I wouldn't change a thing, and definitely see this as an easy item for having company, pot luck, etc.

Amazing! Great flavor and very easy to make. Love, love loved it!

Made a few changes to this because I wanted to use what I had on hand.  First of all, I used canned mushrooms which didn't make much of a differnce.  I used Newman's Own Vodka Sauce rather than Bombolina.  I used a couple tablespoons of cooking sherry rather than dry red wine again because (GASP!) I didn't have any.  Finally I used chicken rather than shrimp.  Even though I did a lot of different things, I think I still got the general idea, and what I came up with was really yummy.  The toasted pine nuts were a must--that flavor was there and it added a really unique flavor.  Same with the balsamic.  The flavor was subtle but it came through and combined with the sun-dried tomatoes, had a rich and interesting mix of flavors.  My 8 year old daughter and I really loved this.   I will pick up a jar of Bombolina for next time and look forward to making it with red wine.

As many before mentioned, I had a difficult time finding Bombolina, so I picked up Bertolli Garlic, Herb and Onion.  I left out the garlic clove, completely forgot the red wine ~ was drinking it instead ~ and didn't use the pine nuts (my family is really picky).  I used frozen, cooked shrimp, for ease.  Turned out really great.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This dish was amazing!  I couldn't find Newman's Own Bombolina Pasta Sauce as the receipe called for so I substitued Traditional Spaghetti Sauce from ALDI (my favorite) and it was delicious.  I served fresh garlic bread and a tossed salad with it.  The meal is a family favorite.

I made this recipe with my 16 year old daughter that I am trying to teach how to cook. It was fabulous! She is usually picky and commented that she did not like alot of the ingredients, but she went back for seconds and thirds. She is becoming more open to try new things now that she can appreciate all the work that goes into cooking a great dish!

Whew! I made a mistake and made this pasta with a tbsp of red pepper flakes rather than 1 tsp. It was HOT. And like some of the other reviewers mentioned, the 4 servings stated are BIG servings. Even with the extra heat I added (I also substituted broccoli for mushrooms because I'm not a fan of mushrooms) this dish was delicious! I also didn't add the pine nuts because my brother is allergic, but I think it still tasted great. Definitely worth a try for a quick and easy dinner.
