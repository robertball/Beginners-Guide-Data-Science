5 stars for easy, 5 stars from the pups, they love these! I doubled the recipe because my cutters are pretty large, I was able to get 28 pieces.

If your treats become moldy after a few days they are probably not dried out enough.  Try turning off the oven after baking and leave them in until they are cooled.  This will help remove moisture and make them crunchy.  Hope this helps.

Jake, my four legged child, absolutely loves these!  He has many food allergies and is incredibly picky, but he cannot get enough of these treats.  Just as the name implies..."Super Simple"!!  Thanks for this recipe!  Greatly appreciated!

I was looking for a way to use up my sweet potato casserole from Thanksgiving and found this. I didn't have any apple sauce on hand, so I just added extra casserole.  I'm way too lazy to roll out dough and cut out shapes, so I just used a large melon baller and then flattened them out with a fork like you would for peanut butter cookies, I was able to get 42 treats doing it this way.  Going to put some in a jar and freeze the rest for later.  My dog just ate one and loved it.  Thanks for the recipe, so easy and will now be added to the "what to do with Thanksgiving leftovers" recipes.

I have a Terrier mix and baked the Dog treats about a week ago according to the recipe. She loved them. I stored them in her Cookie jar on the counter. This was a big mistake. They are all moldy about a week later and I had to throw them away. My advice is that you either have to refrigerate or freeze some of them . But the recipe is very good and easy. Tomorrow I will bake some more.

These were a hit with my little fusspot.   Wanting to wean her off those dried jerky chicken strips made in China, I decided to try making my own treats. I'm not a baker but these were pretty simple to make.  I left them in the oven a bit too long, but that's my oven. Have to shorten the baking time.  One hint I will pass along is to make sure you flour the surface well before you roll out the dough  - the dough tends to be on the sticky side.

Doubled the recipe to give in goodie bags for Christmas to our 4 legged friends. My Rosie loves them! super easy. Keep them in the freezer and just take a few out at a time. They will go moldy if you leave them in a jar too long.

These were so easy to make.  I used the applesauce that I canned myself last summer so I knew there was no added sugar to the recipe.  I also added 1/4 cup of peanut butter to the mix. My lab loved them!  I'm going to try butternut squash and pumpkin next.  Definitely a hit!

Super easy, and very flexible. I didn't really measure anything, and baked them for about 15 minutes, so they were still a bit soft. That being said, I have a very well behaved dog who never gets himself into anything he's not supposed to. He actually climbed on the counter and are a whole in the bag I had these in and are them all! Bad dog! But he has a sensitive stomach and didn't get sick either. So they must be AWESOME!

My dog loves these.  I don't know if this will apply to anyone else but my dog LOVES gingerbread cookies (he doesn't get them but does steal them sometimes) so i add ginger, cinnamon, cloves and a bit of molasses to these.  He goes nuts for them.  but this is a fantastic  recipe as is or as a base recipe to add to!

Dogs loved them. Wicked easy to make. I always have all these ingredients on hand. I used the whole sweet potato (skin included) and ran it through my food processor before adding to batter. Will definitely be making these again!

My dog loves these, and I love how EASY they are to make. I will never buy dog treats again.

If you don't have applesauce on hand, use a mashed ripe banana. Works the same.

OH MY GOSH I was so surprised by these!
My 13 year old golden, Roxy,  was recently diagnosed with kidney disease so we've been trying to change her diet a little. Low protein foods are better for her kidneys as well as foods like sweet potatoes and apples.. (Well, they're good for humans with kidney disease id assume they're good for dogs too!) Roxy LOVES meat and cheese which stinks because that's the exact opposite of what she should be eating. I decided to make these because why not? It's worth a try! She usually hates vegetables though. Anyway, after I baked them I woke her up and handed her a piece. She loved it so much she followed me back into the kitchen for more!!! I'm so happy I've finally found a treat that's good for her and she actually likes!

Great recipe and easy to put together. They came out a little softer/chewier than I would have liked (the dogs like a crisp crunch) but perhaps I didn't dry them out enough. Leaving in the oven might be the better solution after turning off the oven.

My dogs really liked these. I gave it 3 stars because it was soooooo sticky and difficult to work with in the beginning. Use LOTS (TONS!!!) of flour; much more than other recipes.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. My dogs loved the biscuits and finished them in no time! Also they are so easy to make that I as a first time baker felt like a total pro when they turned out so nice.

I have made this twice for my doggie niece and nephew.  Used chunky applesauce, only 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 tsp each of molasses, honey and cinnamon and 1/3 cup of peanut butter.  The dough was gathered into a large ball, covered and chilled overnight.  Only the normal amount of flour was needed to roll out the dough.  It was only slightly sticky.  My doggie nephew enjoyed it both times.  My doggie niece liked it the first time but not the second.  The second time, I used a medicine bottle to cut the dough into little doggie cookies.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Used a cup of canned sweet potato. Didn't have applesauce, so I used about half of a ripe banana. Substituted some of the whole grain flour for ground flax and hemp powder. Very sticky dough, but workable with a lot of flour. Used a heart shaped cookie cutter to make them extra special for doggo. Baked for about 40 minutes, turned off the oven, and let them cool in it. I just took them out and Buddy gobbled one up. A wagging butt of approval.

My two morkies loved these! I didnt have applesauce so i substituted dehydrated apples that i smashed up to bits and used some berry flavored fruit juice to liquify it a little. The dough came out great but i dont bother rolling it out...i bought those little silicone candy molds...i just push them into those. I baked them 35 mins as suggested and they came out hard as rocks! ?? i know because i ate one and had to suck on it a bit so i didnt chip a tooth... it was pretty tasty!

A very simple recipe to follow. I think next time I will bake the sweet potato instead of cooking it in the microwave to get a smoother texture. Both dogs really enjoyed these cookies!

Awesome, simple. Used whole wheat flour the first time I made them, plain unbleached all purpose flour the next time because it's what I had on hand. Both times I used an applesauce cup I bought for my kids lunches. You can make these chewy or crispy, but either way they're fast and easy and good.

My dog is diabetic and fighting pancreatitis. I made these because they are natural and would be easy on his tummy. He loved them. He will once again be able to have a "small" treat! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I've made these a few times and forgot to leave a review. Fairly easy to make but I do need to add additional flour because as written the dough is too sticky. I followed the suggestions of other reviews and baked these for one hour, turned off the oven and left the treats in the oven until it was cold. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I am so far from a "baker", but found these really easy except the dough was sticky to work with.  Next time I will spoon them onto the pan as I read in another review.  My dog LOVES, LOVES, LOVES, them and sweet potatoes are really good for her diabetes.  I just wonder how long they will stay in the refrigerator, I froze half, and put the rest in a baggie in the fridge.  She is little and only gets a 1/2 cookie about 3 times a day.  But I guess I will have to figure it out, because my lil Macy girl is hooked on them.

Super simple! To get the biscuits crunchy,  at the end of the baking time, I turn the oven off and leave the pans in the oven. And I keep them in the freezer.

Too sticky together to roll out.  Added water and a little milk just to get it to barely stick together.   When I cut them out they would fall apart.   They were stuck ot the pon.  They crumbled when I tried to remove from pan.  I had to scrub the cookie sheet to reuse.  Guess I'll stick to my usual that hasn't failed me.

They aren't even out of the oven and my dog is almost drooling waiting for them and our black and white kitty (we think he's a border collie in cat clothes) ate every crumb he could find on the table where I rolled them out.  My sweet potato was not good so I substituted pumpkin.

Seeing that many people had issues with the really sticky dough- this should help:I upped the flour in the mix until it was more of a workable dough.Do that by feel...Heavy flour on board- used my bench scraper to incorporate it with a few folds- another addition to board and dust the top. I did NOT ROLL THIS. I patted it out. Flouring hands as needed. Also dipped my cutter in flour every few times and kept it clean.RE folded the dough to use all- it got easier to work with as it was a bit drier.I used parchment paper on my sheet pan.Rotate pans midway.When they were done- I used a pastry brush to remove any excess dusting flour- a small extra step- but necessary due to the texture of dough. Then put them back into the warm but Off oven- to dry out more.My friend’s finicky dogs loved these too.My 4- absolutely loved them.I got over 100 pieces(small hearts- see picture)I actually ate one- not bad at all!N.B. You can sub the sweet potato with bananaOr sub the applesauce with banana.Don’t be afraid of adding more flour as neededUse your judgment.I should mention-  I have a degree in Culinary and a few European certifications.So my tips have a bit of knowledge behind them.Happy baking for your fur babies everyone!

Not only did both of the dogs love these (and one of them is very picky) but the roommates parrot loved them as well. I did use rice flour instead of whole wheat since gluten is not the best for dogs, and they still turned out perfect.

Australian Shepherd approved.  Dough was perfect to roll out for cutting.  Found it the same consistency as gingerbread cookie dough.  Used the pizza cutter to make smaller square treats; cooked for 18 minutes.  Good crunchy cookie.  Happy to use up the left-over thanksgiving sweet potatoes.

My dogs love this treat! Made it as shared and keep them in the freezer. The are Great Dane rated "drool worthy" and my Lhasa prefers them thawed. Used gluten free flour (brown rice) for my friends who have dogs with sensitivity to wheat.

Puppy really loved these. Used canned yams - rinsed syrup off. Also didn't roll out dough - dropped by tbsp and flattened with fork. Only problem  was first batch stuck to sheet so i sprayed pam next batch. Will definitely make again.

It was a hit! My dogs don’t like canned sweet potatoes but they loved these! As easy as advertised! Made two cookie sheets full. As another commenter recommended, try leaving them in the oven to cool to ensure they dry out properly. Not that this batch will have a chance to!

My puppy doesn’t care for the gourmet treats we get at the pet shop but she devoured these. I substituted oat flour in place of whole wheat flour, check for conversion measurements.

Turned out well.  Had to add some water as the original dough turned out too dry.  The dogs treat  them like they are special and you can see  that they really enjoy eating them.  Thanks for the recipe.

My dog LOVED these simple treats and they were easy to make. However, I didn't store them in the fridge and they went bad quickly. The next batch I did refrigerate and my lab gave them a 2 paws up rating.

My dough was sticky and could not be rolled out. I tried adding more of the flour but that didn't work either. Any suggestions? I followed the recipe to a T.

My fur babies LOVE these treats. Simple recipe with great results. The treats also freeze well. I may try to add more flavour to them, but 2 thumbs up!

These are very easy. Made them twice for fundraisers for Fur and Feather Animal Assistance in western New Mexico. If you plan to put them in bags, give them an additional day to dry completely before you do.

I tried this recipe several times and my pup liked it a little, but then I substituted the sweet potato with carrotts and she LOVED it! They were also a little crispier!

Was a little sticky, so I just spooned them on the cookie sheet. My doberman likes them (he will eat anything) my moms PICKY Husky girl ate them (and that says a lot). All in all.simple and good. Recommended.

Doubled the recipe.  Didn't have applesauce so used olive oil which I didn't think would be an issue for my golden retriever who is a healthy weight but suffers from skin issues.
