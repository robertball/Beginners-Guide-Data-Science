Very good!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the walnuts.  Since I do not like walnuts, I left them out.  I took this to a holiday party and people loved it!  The only problem was that it started to liquify after being out for a while - but that's a given!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Definitely turned out fine, but I suppose a little too "healthy" for me! :P  I'm more of a chocolate girl and I just wasn't very satisfied with the tastes...but a great snack for kids...we also used it at a friend gathering.

Pretty, refreshing dessert for a summer party. I made these for a Hawaiian, pool party. I used cherry jello and added chopped fresh peach. Served in clear plastic cups.

GREAT idea making individual servings like this!  I only hade lemon and lime jello favors, so I left out the cranberries and added very finely chopped walnuts instead - still was a HUGE hit, especially for the kids who rarely eat jello with "stuff in it".  I WILL make this again using the proper ingredients! Thank you!

I loved these! only two tiny changes. I used sugar free black cherry jello because my mom is diabetic. I also left out the apples on accident haha. Fantastic taste, great presentation, and tons of ways to personalize to your taste. I am taking these to two family thanksgivings this year!

The first time I made this I used pineapple tidbits by mistake. It was very good. The second time I made it I used crushed pineapple like the recipe calls for and it wasn't very good. It went in the trash. Using tidbits made all the difference.

I made these for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved them. I used paper cupcake liners, which I sprayed with Pam, and I had no trouble at all peeling the liners off. They tasted great, had a nice crunchy texture, and looked very pretty. I'll probably make them again for Christmas and next Thanksgiving.

Had these at a Thanksgiving dinner I attended.  They were delicious and had a great presentation.  A wonderful alternative to cranberries alone.

These minis are great.  I used sugar free jello and swapped pecans for walnuts.  Everyone liked them.

My favorite! I make this every year for Thanksgiving! I leave out walnuts, cause we dont like them and I usually put it in a glass dish instead of individual muffin cups. Its easier to eat that way! I also mix a block of cream cheese and a heaping spoonful of mayo for a yumming topping!!

Very good.  I used strawberry jello instead since that's my favorite & didn't add in the walnuts.  Family has already asked for the recipe & I'll also be making more for this weekend's Thanksgiving party at work.

I like to use lemon jello to give it a little more zip.  I usually leave out the apple and make it in a mold instead of individual servings.  It is at my table every Thanksgiving.

This is delicious. I left out nuts for family members.  I made 12 in cupcake liners and filled two ceramic dishes with the remainder.  The cupcake liners became wet, but the dish was pretty on the plate.  I intend this to become a Holiday staple.  I am finally going to buy a jello mold! 2nd year to make and I am the only one eating it now.  Oh well.

I make this as 1 big jell-o salad rather than spend the time making singles, then trying to remove the paper when you are in a hurry. Always a big hit at Christmas or Thanksgiving. Leftovers are great too.

Followed the recipe. Tasted great, but did not hold there shape.  I had to add 2 more packs of Jello to get them to 'gel'.

This was delicious, however, working with the cups turned out to be a disastrous mess.  I prefer it in one big bowl.  Just as tasty.

I prepared this exactly as written. I could not get the liners to peel off! Because of that, I ended up wasting a lot. Had almost every one left that I took for Thanksgiving with family.

These were a good dessert that was different.  I previously didn't know you could do Jell-o in cupcake papers.  It worked out nicely.  They weren't however outstanding, that's why I gave it four starts.  I may make them again... they really didn't make an impression on my family.

This was good but I used my Demarle mold and it stuck to the mold! I was surpised because nothing has ever stuck to that mold before. It's a nice combo of fruit in the salad but its just a jello salad.
