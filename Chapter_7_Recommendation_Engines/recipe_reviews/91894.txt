Deliciously healthy comfort food! Of course, it helps that you like all the vegetables on their own! I substituted butternut squash for the acorn squash and added dried crushed sage leaves instead. Like others, I could definately finish a whole lot of this at a time. Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I cooked the potato and onion alone for 10 minutes, then added the squash, mushroom, and bell pepper and cooked for an additional 10 minutes. Finally, I added the remaining vegetable and cooked the final 5 minutes.

So good! A keeper of a recipe and a great starting point for making your own vegetable hash recipe.

I thought this was very good.  I used a mix of regular and shitake mushrooms because the shitake mushrooms were so expensive.  I have to say that the shitake mushrooms give it a much more interesting flavor.  I will be making this again!

I added the kale at the beginning, along with the potatoes and the squash.  5 minutes is not nearly enough to wilt kale in my experience: it can stand as much cooking as the potatoes.  The diced red pepper, on the other hand, I withheld until the last five minutes or so.  I substituted some of the giant puffball Kathy Turner gave us for the shitakes, and a leek for the shallot; added some frozen "meat"balls (my wife's vegetarian)for protein's sake; and I served this, with some grated cheese to go on top, as a main dish.  Delish!  This is an amazing festive autumn treat even without the giant puffball.    

In fact, we enjoyed this so much that I'm cooking it again tonight (for the second night running).  Still some giant puffball left, but this time I'll substitue fish sausage (she's a pesce-vegetarian) for the "meat"balls, and adding Kathy's green beans to the melange.

I don't think I've ever rated a recipe 3 before. if I don't like the ingredients, I don’t make it. This recipe states 15 minutes prep time. I don't think Martha Stewart and a room full of assistants could peel, and dice an acorn squash, a pound of yukon potatoes, 8 oz of mushrooms, a cup of kale, a bell pepper and finely dice a shallot -- in 15 minutes. Seriously? No Way. I'm pretty efficient when it comes to dicing, but I was making this dish for a dinner group at 5:00 p.m. and I began shortly after 2:00 p.m. If my husband had not joined me and worked side by side for 45 minutes, there is no way it would have been ready. There was no instruction on how to peel an acorn squash- so I’ll add that I scrub the squash well, prick holes in it like you would a baked potato, then microwave it for about 3 minutes. Then it is soft enough to peel. Once you peel, you can slice then dice. I also saw no instructions on what to do with or when to add the sage. How much is a “Sprig” of fresh sage? I took 4 nice sized leaves and cut in small pieces with kitchen shears. It was not nearly enough to taste. The flavor seemed very bland, and even with additional olive oil and butter, it kept sticking, so I did as another reviewer suggested and added 2 chicken bouillon cubes to one cup of water and it finally began to have some flavor. If you really like these ingredients, please try the recipe, just know it will take a lot longer than 15 minutes to prepare. For me, the end result was not worth the

I found this good, but a bit bland. I added a little soy sauce to pick up the flavor. Next time I make it, I would use only half of the potatoes.

This is fantastic!  The flavors of all the veggies go so well together.  It's very savory and satisfying.  Make sure you cut up the kale in small pieces for easier eating.

This was REALLY good!! I don't have a skillet big enough to cook this in so I put it all in a large baking dish at 475 degrees for 25 min and then added the kale to the top for and cooked another 5-10 minutes.  It was amazing and much easier than cooking on the stove.  I used all olive oil (no butter) to make it healthier. I didn't have a shallot so I used a chopped red onion instead.  I used 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I made this a second time for guests and everyone loved it!  I added sweet potatoes for half of the potatoes, about 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper instead of a pinch and 2 cups kale. This will be a regular recipe for us!

My whole family, including two teenagers, loved this recipe.  They were snubbing it while I was making it, but when dinner was over, there wasn't a morsel left.  I served it with grilled fish and a green salad.  It is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is very good as-is but even better, it's a super starting point for variations to suit what you have on hand and your personal preferences.  One important tip is to use a non-stick, LARGE frying pan. I had absolutely no trouble with the hash sticking, though turning the massive quantity of veg made me wish I'd used my wok.  I do agree that the prep time for this dish is way over 15 minutes, but the result is well worth it. The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is that it did, as a few other cooks have commented, need a little something extra to "oomf" the flavor. I added about 1 teaspoon of Worchestershire sauce, a dash of cayenne and a touch of balsamic vinegar and that did the trick. The balsamico worked very well with the squash and sweet potato that I added.  Other changes I made at one time or another were to use less plain potato and substitute sweet potato, add more kale (i like the stuff and it's so healthy) and added some bok choy that needed to be used. You get the idea, almost anything can go into this as long as you consider the cooking times. I'm going to try adding a cooked, crumbled hot Italian sausage next time just to see what that tastes like. One sausage in all that veg shouldn't add a lot of calories or fat.  I took the "4 sprigs of sage" to mean 4 small tips of the branches, not just 4 leaves. That worked out well though if you wait too long to add it and it doesn't have time to lightly cook, the flavor is way too powerful. Fresh sage sho

This recipe is delicious. I made it as a side dish with a boneless ribeye roast and it was great.  This is one I will make over and over again.  I would definitely due the chopping of the vegetables ahead of time it is a lot of chopping , but well worth the effort.

This was a really great recipe, with lots of room to play around. I used one butternut squash and one acorn squash. I also used one yukon gold potato, one red potatoe, and one sweet potato. I did find the shitake mushrooms a bit expensive, so I used half those and half baby bella mushrooms. We had some parsley and onion leftover from the fish we made with the hash, so I threw that in, too.  I found that I had to add a lot of water to the veggies while cooking to keep them from sticking, but other than that, the recipe worked just fine.

The hash was pretty tasty when we ate it the first night. The second day, I had some leftovers with dinner, and it tasted way better after having been refrigerated. The third day, I threw in a handful of dried cranberries, and it was HEAVENLY. 

My bottom line suggestion is definitely to double this recipe and, if you can, make it the day before and refrigerate overnight. It really makes the flavors meld wonderfully.

Two tips. One, if you're using a whole acorn squash, take the time to peel it really well. Bits of peel are very fibrous. Two, you should barely stir this once the bulk of the ingredients are added. It will brown if you stir it infrequently, which adds great flavor. Otherwise, you may as well steam it. Cast iron is your friend for this recipe.

I followed the recipe but found it rather blah. I wasn't able to get Shitake mushrooms so I used regular white.  Maybe that had a big effect on the flavor. Recipe didn't say to peel the acorn squash which was a mistake.  If I ever made this again I would use butternut squash instead.  Also needs more seasonings!

I liked this recipe a lot, and will definitely make again. It's easy, and doesn't need any crazy ingredients.  However, the provided serving suggestion (6 servings) is completely bogus. I made twice the recipe (2 lbs potatoes, 2 acorn squash, etc,), and it was enough for my husband and me for one dinner and i had all the leftovers for lunch the next day. Mind you, we are both very much in shape, and mind our portions.   Other than that little peeve of mine (it applies across most recipes on the site), really yummy, hearty recipe. Love the mushroom-potato-onion combination.

This was yum!! and I did it the easy way! Instead of chopping everything by hand I used my mini food processor so some of the veggies were a little smaller. I did chop the spinach (instead of kale), used a yellow onion instead of shallot and regular mushrooms instead of shiitake - because I had them available.  Threw all the veggies in a large bowl, whisked together 5 tbsp of the olive oil (instead of using the butter), 3/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, the garlic powder and used sage spice (I had in my cabinet) about 1/2 tsp - poured the mixture over the veggies, mixed everything up, put it in my stoneware dish and baked it uncovered for about 45 min at about 375. I came out absolutely yummy!! I was actually surprised at how good it was:)

My husband is more picky about what he eats than my three-year-old is, so I wasn't expecting to wow him with the acorn squash and kale.  I'm trying to help my guy eat a little healthier, though, and I thought this twist on a traditional hash might be a good halfway point. I was happily surprised when he went back for seconds and kept raving about how delicious it was. I went with previous reviews and cooked the potatoes and onion for about ten minutes before adding the other veggies.  Now that I'm feeling dangerous I think I'll try doubling the kale next time. ;)

Very good.  I used dried sage as I had it on hand, also used onion instead of shallot for same reason.  It is a good basic recipe that allows for experimentation--next time!  Added bonus:  with the leftover kale I put the kale leaves on cookie sheet, sprinkled with a bit of salt and garlic powder, and baked at 350 for about 15 min to make kale chips--yum!  Thanks for this recipe.

Excellent.  My modifications:  1) added several carrots, which gave a touch of sweetness to the dish, 2) used about 2 TBS of olive oil and a couple teaspoons of butter, 3) added dried thyme and marjoram, 4) added one shallot and one finely diced onion, 5) sautéed the onion and shallots until translucent, then added the potatoes and carrots and cooked for 10 minutes, and 6) added all other ingredients, including the kale, after this.  Note that preparing all the vegetables is time consuming.  I suggest buying already-peeled chunks of butternut squash, if available in your grocery store.

Fantastic!  Used chard instead of kale and dried sage in lieu of fresh.  All other ingredients the same and it was absolutely delicious.  Used the leftovers in an egg scramble.  Yum!

I was a little skeptical at first, but pleasantly surprised.  Even my vegetable (especially squash and greens) hating husband and toddler loved this.  I couldn't believe it.  I also made it for a Holiday dinner and everyone loved it.  Thought it was a great alternative to mashed potatoes plus it is very festive looking. I make this over and over.  Best tip is to make sure you use Yukon Gold Potatoes, they make all the difference.   *** I just made this (again) and put polish sausage chopped up and used a mixture of fresh and the powdered garlic. AMAZING! My one and five year old and husband ate all their dinner!

I tweaked the dish based on what ingredients I had (bella mushrooms, butternut squah and green beans) and loved it. Obviously a very versatile recipe, and why I gave it five stars. Love the shallot/garlic combo. I also found that the winter squah is easier to peel and dice if you first cut it in half and cook it in a 400-degree oven on a greased cookie sheet for about 5 minutes.

This was ok, but just not great. The flavor is very distinctive so this only really works as a side dish- couldn't really handle this in large doses.

So good.  I used a different winter green because I planned for this meal on the day we got our garden box, expecting kale and didn't have it.  But I think any winter green would work in this dish.  Poached eggs on top.

This needs a lot more salt, but otherwise it's a very tasty mix. I used butternut in place of the acorn squash and spinach in place of the kale. Be sure to cut the potatoes in 1/2" dice to ensure it cooks in the 25 min. specified.

I love these vegetables, but this was a big bowl of bland mush.  I even added the Worcestershire and balsamic that others suggested and the flavors just disappeared.  What a waste of a LOT of time.

The vegetables used made for a great flavour combination.  I boiled up some water as I chopped the potatoes and squash, and blanched them in the hot water prior to cooking in the skillet, made for much faster cooking time (15 minutes maybe), potatoes and squash were tender that way.  Also add kale right at the start in the pan, it takes a while to wilt.  Good flavours.  Ate it with turkey.....

Almost didn't make this.  Scared by some of the reviews. Different strokes for different folks I guess.  We loved it.  The only thing I changed was adding 1 tsp minced garlic.  I put some shredded Jack cheese over the top of my meat eaters plates.  All family members enjoyed this.

I didn't care for the recipe so much. I didn't like the sweetness of the acorn squash mixed with everything else. Nothing out of the ordinary. I added some summer squash to it and the yellow squash offered a nice visual presentation and added flavor.

Delicious recipe ... I didn't have shallot, so I used garlic and onion instead.  It was a tasty combination. This was my first time trying kale and it was a nice surprise.  I was glad to find a new vegetable recipe that was packed with nutrition and so yummy.

Loved it! Used russets instead of Yukon, baby portabellos (crimini) instead of shiitake, and delicata instead of acorn, just based on what I had.  Delicata is nice because you don't have to peel it, makes easier prep.  At first I was going to use some sweet potato, but then decided against it since the squash already has sweetness to it, but I did add carrots to use them up, add color and crunch.  I used thyme instead of sage just to match the rest of the meal better. The key to a recipe like this is the size of the dice, you want everything to cook through at the same time but nothing get mushy.  I started the potatoes a bit first, and I like kale a bit more done in things like this so I added it earlier than the recipe says.  I wish I would have kept the red pepper dice larger.  People that say it's bland probably did not add enough salt and pepper, although that is probably the fault of the recipe because it does say "pinch" which in my opinion is not enough. Maybe I should take a star away for that, but salt and pepper should always be to taste. I almost always ignore S&P measurements in a recipe. Regardless, this combination of veggies is outstanding and I'm keeping this one for sure!

Basically, you can use any veggie you want, like using up leftovers...don't want to deal with peeling acorn squash, then don't.  Use cut up carrots or parsnips or butternut squash, this recipe doesn't have to be so rigid. Add flavorings to your liking, and a 'pinch' of salt is not enough!  You need salt to bring the flavors together, to taste.  Usually a splash of chicken broth, which has salt, brings it together.

I loved this! I put in a lot more kale and cooked everything together apart from the mushrooms, which I put in towards the end. I omitted the red bell pepper as I'm not a fan of cooked peppers, otherwise I kept true to the recipe. I did cook it a lot longer than mentioned - kale in my view needs quite a bit of cooking. This was a hearty, delicious meal and I will be making this again and again! Thank you!

This was really good and my kids liked it too.  I used fresh garlic (about 4 cloves) and ground sage since I didn't have any fresh.  I also doubled the amount of kale.

Really good as written! Personally, I think I'd prefer something a little more tender than kale in it. Also, I'll probably serve it as a side dish to a meal entree next time.

I'm not a big fan of squash or kale, but had some I needed to use and since I like the rest of the ingredients I thought this would be the way to go, and it was very good.  Even my picky husband liked it.  The portabella mushrooms were really what made it so good!  I don't think it would have been as good with regular mushrooms.

I found this pretty unappealing, and time comsuming to make, it had a mushy consistancy, and seemed  to need something, so I added some crumbled turkey bacon, but maybe some sausage of some sort would work better, but not sure it is worth all that effort to try again, dont see where the 4 and 5 star ratings come from??

My husband and I couldn't believe how good this was!  We also added toasted sesame seeds and chili flakes on top and a little bit of worcester sauce but I think it was good even before that.  There are a lot of additions/substitutions I will try with this one (including less potatoes and with some scrambled eggs.  So happy to find a good recipe that uses Kale!  Thanks!

I fell in love with this at "Hello"!!!! Not a big squash fan, but after killing my hands to cube a butternut and acorn squash- it was worth it!  I had never eaten Kale, and I used the whole bunch, which worked fine. This was fantastic! Will be using this one forever! Thanks!

This is one of the best, easiest hash recipes I’ve made—absolutely delicious! I had a butternut squash from the CSA, so I used that, plus purple potatoes, so it was very pretty. I didn’t think the potatoes and squash would cook in 25 minutes in the skillet, so I added 1/4c veg broth, covered the skillet, and simmered for about 10 min. while I was chopping the other veggies. Next time, I’ll add a bit more sage. This is a new favorite!

Really good. I sliced the mushrooms instead of dicing because I didn't want them to go mushy I also used green pepper as well as the red. Next time I will use 2 shallots. Thanks.

Very Yummy!!!  My squash did seem to disapear and turn to mush, but still tasted great.  Next time I will try butternut squash and cook it separately.  I must have stirred too much.  Loved the kale in this!  Will make again!

I halved the olive oil and butter. I think five tablespoons of fat is too much for a recipe that makes only six servings. But considering the other reviews, the butter and oil must be making this dish worthwhile. The only other changes I made were using button mushrooms instead of shitake and chopped swiss chard instead of kale (all what I had on hand). This dish looked really good in the skillet, but was quite bland like other reviewers have mentioned. I just don't see the point of making this again and don't intend to try it with additional seasoning. Life's too short. The butter and oil are clearly the stars of this dish and, if I want to eat tons of fat, I can just make cookies. As for peeling the acorn squash, with a good peeler, it's actually not that bad. I hadn't done it before either, but found a few videos online. Just cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, cut the halves into wedges, and then peel the wedges. I even left little bits of peel in the hard-to-peel grooves of the squash and didn't notice them at all when eating the dish. Revision: At first I gave this recipe 3 stars because it wasn't that bad. But after heating up leftovers and eating it, I changed it to 2 stars. It's HORRIBLE the second time around. I had to gag it down. Will NEVER make this again.

My daughter and I are always looking for new vegetarian recipes and this one looked intruiging. It definitely takes some time to chop everything, so I do prep earlier than dinner.I used fresh garlic pressed instead of powder and regular sliced mushrooms due to cost. I had never cooked kale before but liked it and will double the amount next time and it doesn't hurt to put it in near the beginning if you like it tender.Peppers were omitted. Some people asked about how much sage? I used 4 good sized leaves snipped small and thought that was a good amount.I really felt the cooking time was understated, 45min was to my liking. The finished dish was warm and satisfying on a cold night and my daughter and I put it on our "have again" list!

Just made this and have already "tasted " it many times. It really is good. I used russet potatoes because I had some on hand that needed to be used and portabello mushrooms because that's what there was at the store. Also used dried sage. I'm pretty sure prep time was more like 30 minutes, those acorn squash are a pain to dice. Well worth the effort, though. It would be easy to add a little more protein by adding some sort of meat or even cheese, but it is great as is.

very good. I only used 1/8 c. olive oil and 8 oz. of sausage. Added a handful of spinach that I chopped. Wouldn't change a thing!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It really reminded me of a dish prepared by a friend from India.  I added 1 Tbs. Curry Powder, 1 tsp. Garam Marsala, 1 tsp. Ginger Paste, 5 whole cloves and 5 Cardamom pods for a nice twist.  When melting the butter into the oil on a low temp add the spices to release their best flavor and follow the regular recipe.

This was fabulous.  I can't see how people thought it was bland.  I did as others suggested and cooked the potatoes and shallots first and then as I chopped all other veggies I added them.  Thanks for sharing!

Hash is when you use whatever is needing to be used before it spoils.  So any combo makes a hash.  This combination is good and your family won't turn up their noses. I remember my Dad's hash when Mom was out of town. Those meals were made of some pretty interesting combinations.  It's amazing I survived!

This recipe was delicious, and very easy! It was my first time using kale and acorn squash, but everything turned out perfect.  You can also add just about any other vegetables you have. I will make this again.

Delish!  I did not use squash though but added fresh tomatoes.  MMmmm!  I put the kale in with all the other vegetables in the beginning & it worked out fine.  I served it with the marinated baked pork chops.  It was all gobbled up!

I added a bit of roasted chicken to this at the end and called it a meal. Everyone loved it, and it made the house smell fantastic! I did cover during much of the cook time, and it took about 15 minutes to cook through.

This was really delicious.  Like some of the other reviewers I used sweet potatoes instead of white.  I used fresh baby spinach instead of kale sine that is what we like and I had on hand. At the end I did take someone elses advice and added a little Worcestershire sauce and a little balsamic vinegar.  I have made it twice so far, and it is deffinately a keeper!

Total novices at cooking. A little mushy and I should have cooked the potatoes separately but delicious. What can I add to spice it up? Smoked paprika? Cayenne? Or Serrano pepper for some more green?

I like the recipe but I think you mean winter squash, not acorn squash.  I can't imagine dicing acorn squash unless it is first baked but then it would be too soft to fry with the other ingredients.  Also, I found it very bland and intend to add diced ham next time I cook it.

My prep time was longer than the 35 min. listed, but I'm not a cutting and slicing machine either.  Finally found a receipe to use the fresh Sage from my herb garden. The finished dish looks great, smell great,and full of flavor. Perfect for using winter vegetables. While Kale and Sage were melding into the dish in the last five minutes. I seared two fillets of Sockeyed Salmon Cagun Style on the grill. Can't wait to share it with a family gathering.

Good hearty meal. 2 servings per person is plenty food. We substituted the Acorn Squash with ordinary Squash and it was still good. We also had a couple of soy sausages on the side.

Delicious! A lot of prep work, but I did not mind - cooking is fun. :-) Makes a very fresh, seasonal side dish. I did as another reviewer suggested and started out sautéing the potatoes with the onion and fresh garlic (instead of seasoning) for 10-15 minutes, then added the rest of the veggies (except the kale). Turned out perfect - the potatoes were nicely done. I also used portabella mushrooms since I couldn't find shiitake, and it tasted just fine. Definitely a keeper for a warm fall/winter meal!

I used this recipe as a starting off point, adding some additional vegetables like beets, carrots, yellow onion, and garlic. Skipped the butter and used extra olive oil. (I'm a vegan) Changed up the herbs and spices too. At any rate, mine turned out amazing. Enjoyed by vegans an non-vegans alike.

Adding a poached egg over the top, and sprinkling on salt and pepper, are ideas straight from a restaurant that make this dish an even better meal.

This was one of the best veggie recipes I have ever had!  I have been looking for a good recipe for when people come over and I finally found one.  I think the squash is what truly gave it flavor.  I accidentaly over cooked it a bit so it was a bit mushy.  The sweet flavor rubbed off on the other veggies.  I used the club house garlic plus seasoning instead of the garlic powder and just put a little bit of salt and pepper. Also added a little bit of cayenne pepper and used a pinch of dry sage instead of fresh. So delicious and worth the chopping and peeling!

Very good! I think the cooking time is too long though, because my potatoes and squash were mushy and sticky. Next time I will cut bigger pieces and/or cook less. Great flavor with the sage, though!

Very good. I find it odd when people change recipes so much that they aren't recognized as the Same one
Like adding salty things to a low salt recipe or meat to a meat less one.
This one does invite change to the Vegetables. Hash does suggest using what you have
I did add an egg to my portion. I remember making hash with left over pot roast and always stirring in an egg.

I have made this recipe a couple of times and it was a hit both times!  My husband who requires meat with every meal was satified with it both as a main course and side dish.  Including some shiitake mushrooms really contributes to the flavor.  When I cannot find a good price on shiitake mushrooms I will prepare the recipe with half shiitake and half baby bella.  It is good both ways.  When I cooked it, the acorn squash lost some of its structure.  The hash still had a good texture (NOT mushy) and was quite moist as a result.  Will continue to make this veggie delight!

I don't get it. I wanted to love this; it's so different from my other meals. But really, something is just missing. It isn't BAD by any means, but just so blehh compared to the fawning reviews I read.

Delicious. Only giving it 4 stars because I made quite a few changes based on what I had on hand. Steamed baby potatoes beforehand. Sauteed some onions until translucent, added potatoes. Then I added broccoli and green beans until aldente, then added green and red peppers only cooking a bit, wanted to keep the crunch. I then added some pre-cooked squash (mine was too mushy but still tasted great). At the very end I added chopped up spinach and stirred until wilted.  For seasoning I used salt, pepper, italian herb mixtures, and dry sage.  We all enjoyed this!

Awesome!  I didn't even have some of the ingredients...just used whatever veggies I had on hand, and didn't have the fresh sage, so just left it out.  It was delicious!  Will definitely make again.

Excellent! Omitted red pepper & squash, added red pepper flakes. Added some browned sausage. Agree with other reviewers--kale needs more cooking time.

A little dry, but delicious. Did take the advise of other reviews and added the squash in with the potatoes, and added the kale in earlier.   The recipe doesn't state if the potatoes should be peeled.  I didn't peel and next time I will.

This was a fantastic way to use lots of the vegetables that were in my vegetable bin!  I made a few substitutions (no potatoes, regular white mushrooms,  a cubanelle pepper, frozen butternut squash cubes, garlic salt instead of garlic & salt).  I also added Penzey's Italian Sausage Seasoning and eggs (leftover from the egg wash from chicken-fried portobello mushrooms) to make it a scrambled egg dish and it tasted wonderful!  The fresh sage really made it.  The sum of this was so much better than its parts would make you think.

I thought this was delicious.  I did use regular mushrooms instead of shiitake and spinach in place of kale and left out the sage altogether (I didn't have those ingredients in the house), and it still tasted wonderful.  I would definitely make this again.

Very pretty to look at and fairly tasty. I would have liked it to be crispier than it was. Maybe a bigger pan would work for this. The prep time is quite a bit longer than stated in the recipe - all that peeling and dicing takes a while. Thanks for the recipe!

This is such a yummy recipe!  I made it as is the first time and loved it, but thought I'd change it up a little the next time to see if my kids would love it more.  I didn't want to buy 5 pounds of Yukon Gold potatoes so I used some red, some white, and some sweet potatoes.  I also tried it with spinach instead of kale.  It was even yummier the second time I made it with those changes.  Having the sweet potatoes with the acorn squash made such a sweet taste to it- great!  And I love that it's so healthy too.  My kids did like it better with the changes.  I'm heading to the pumpkin patch right now and will probably pick up some more acorn squash to use in it the next time I make it!

I am so happy to find this recipe! And my tummy is too! It's sweet and salty and savory and has all sorts of flavors going for it. I had some anise that I needed to do something with so I cooked it in too, but it didn't add any flavor I don't think. We didn't have any good shallots at the market, so I added onion. The fresh sage really makes this sing!!

This was really mushy and soggy, and I only cooked it for 15 minutes! It was also really bland. I made it with some lemon pepper cod (which was delicious), but none of us ate the veggie hash.  Well, except for my 7 month old.  He LOVED it!! Summary: good baby food, not good adult food.

Wow! I have never had kale before, but, even so I knew I wouldn't like it. Also, my first time ever using a shallot. 
The only reason I made this dish is I got some kale in my csa box. Very pleasantly surprised at how good it is.
I had all the veggies except for a red bell, but, my csa box gave me a red onion, so I used that and kept everything else the same.
If you've never had kale, I suggest you try this dish--it is very tasty.
Oh yes, for the squash. Obviously you can't peel a squash, so what I did cut in half lengthwise with the help of a rubber mallet, then cut in halves. From there, I diced, and then cut the skin off of each dice individually. Don't make the pieces to big. 
Enjoy-thanks Rebecca!

I really love this Hash, it's so perfect for the winter. I live in NY, and you need lots of calories when you do all of your travel by foot and train. Anyway, I added veggy soup broth in the mix to help the veggies from sticking. I also used a chopped up portobello mushroom. It only took me 20 minutes for  alll of the veggies to be cooked on my gas stove.  I will fix this over and over again.

We are back to having a vegetarian meal one night a week.  This was a perfect vegetarian dinner.  I used butternut squash instead of the acorn squash, and added fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  Invest in one of those dicer boxes - - it only took me 5 minutes to dice the squash, mushrooms, potatoes, red pepper, shallots, and garlic.  For the record, the dish needs a heavy pinch of salt and pepper for flavoring.  And we splashed on hot sauce right before serving.  (My husband added soy sauce too.)  It just needs alittle "zing" to make it fabulous!

I am a married mother of 2.  My husband and I are both 24 years old.  He is a total meat guy.  I made this for him and he loved it.  He didn't even notice that there were veggies in it. My 5 year old and 2 year old loved it as well.  I put a little ketchup on the kids plates and they loved it even more.

Super, super tasty. I opted for no mushrooms (can't stand 'em), but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. I REALLY enjoyed this, particularly with some soy sauce to spice it up. 

It was also quite tasty with eggs - I scrambled them together with a little extra salt & pepper. Yum!

I just made this for brunch on this snowy morning.  I had picked up some purple kale at Wild Oats but needed a recipe to go with it.  I made this and some fried eggs, and put out some crusty artisan bread next to it.  Delicious!

An update: This is 3 years later.  I can't tell you how often I've made this dish.  Trying to get colorful veggies down people can be a challenge, and this has ALWAYS worked.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I cooked it for a dinner party attended by a vegetarian.  She loved it and asked me for the recipe.  Even my carnivore husband loved it!

Good and healthy. It was good, but not great. Too much time and effort for just a "good" recipe. But you gave me a good start on producing my own veggie hash. Thanks Rebecca.

This is my favorite yellow squash recipe. The only thing I change is I put in a whole medium onion chopped.  I can eat the whole casserole myself.

This was so good. My handy dandy little dicer from Williams-Sonoma made it much quicker to make.  The only thing I didn't have was fresh sage, so I sprinkled in some powdered sage instead, and it was delicious.  It's part of my regular dishes now.

Took forever to get the ingredients prepared.  I would make it again if all the veggies were prepackaged and ready. It was pretty bland for my taste but my vegetarian daughter loved it.

I substituted 2 large carrots for the squash, white mushrooms for the shitake mushrooms and a yellow onion instead of a shallot. These were all things I had on hand. We loved the dish and I will make it again!

This was a very good recipe, taste-wise.  However, I would never use acorn squash again unless I can buy it already peeled.  It took forever!  I took some tips from other reviewers:  I doubled the recipe because several reviews indicated that it doesn't  really make six portions, I added a minced hot pepper because some said it was bland.  The hot pepper gave it some really good flavor, imo.  I did not add any sage simply because I didn't have any.  Finally, I cooked the dish for 10 minutes after adding the kale (rather than 5 minutes), based on other comments.
The final product was delicious but I would substitute butternut squash for the acorn squash to cut down on the prep time.  I would definitely make this again with the above changes!

Basic potato hash. You can make adjustments to spice it up a bit, but then you'll have a completely different recipe.

This is a very tasty dish.  I used butternut squash, as it is easier to cut.  Next time  I will use more kale and less oil .  I made this  for a guest who is vegan by omitting the butter.  It is definitely good and hearty enough to gain entrance to my regular line-up of recipes.

Nice  Recipe!!!!   Instead of me using Kale I opted for Collard Greens since that was what I had available.  Cooked time for me was 25 minutes x 2 which came out nice.  The flavor was oh so............. good.

I roasted mine in the oven as another reviewer shared.  The acorn squash was mushy as were the peppers.  I may sauté the peppers and scallions and use butternut squash.

Much better than expected. Took tips from other comments: cast iron skillet, started potatoes out first then added kale early, butter and half cup chicken broth and teaspoon Wor. sauce, added mushrooms last. Stirred minimally. Quite tasty (forgot oil and pepper but didn't miss). Edit: only used three small yellow potatoes; quite enough.

I paired this recipe with some chicken—delicious! My husband has even been enjoying the leftovers (he insists it's just as good cold!). I suggest adding salt and pepper to taste after taking the pan off heat.

Very good. Used fresh garlic, buttercup squash. Otherwise per original recipe
Added half a peeled tomato at the end, as it seemed a bit dry.  
Great flavor.

I thought it was underflavored, but I skipped the sage, so that could be why. Chopping all the veggies does take significant time, but I will likely be making it again anyway; maybe substituting butternut squash for acorn squash. Acorn squash was a pain to peel and dice!

Very tasty! I agree with what some other people have said about adding the kale sooner. I added it halfway and I think it could've still been cooked more. Also, I definitely used more salt but that's to one's own personal taste.

Really enjoyed this! I added a teaspoon of curry instead of sage, and roasted it all at 400 instead of on the cooktop.(I needed space.) frozen spinach in place of kale this time. This is super versatile, I like that!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was fabulous! It did take forever to cut up the vegetables.  I prepped that the night before.  But after that it's quick and easy.  Will definitely make this again.  I had Turkey Kielbasa with the vegies. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Fantastic. Thinking I am going to add to my thanksgiving day menu. Accidently used savory and did not have sage. I also added poultry seasoning.  I am sure the recipe is good as written,  but it was so good I am not sure I'll try it.

A tremendous and tremendously simple dish (made all the more tremendous by its very simplicity). Like others, I added about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, a few shakes of cayenne and a little soy sauce. Also went heavy on the sage and added some sauteed ground beef.

I LOVE this recipe BUT I did not have acorn squash or bell pepper so I tripled the Kale. Next time I will use all the ingredients (lol).  I made a frittata from the leftovers. This recipe is a real "keeper". I usually use garlic in everything but used the shallot as written and it was very tasty.

This was good fresh, but not as leftovers.  I had never cooked butternut squash before and it was way too big of a pain to do it again.  I will substitute something else in the future.

Great simple quick recipe for a november evening!  We used all kinds of root vegetables and greens from our garden in this in addition to the potatoes and squash.  Did without the mushrooms but added in a little chicken broth at the end when cooking kale to let "steam" for 10min. Perfecto!

Love the taste of fresh sage in this, and it taught me that I really like Kale too. If you like squash, then it's a great recipe for something healthy, fairly easy and different.

My husband fell in love with this. I thought it was good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the consistency, though it could've been the hash browns I used. It was nummy though!

Awesome. Used kale and potatoes from our CSA. Used regular mushrooms instead of shitake to save cost and still turned out great. Husband and I had this as our main course and we both had 2 helpings!

INCREDIBLE!  I was very skeptical because of the simplicity of the recipe but this was amazing.  I omitted bell pepper since I didn't have it.  I also substituted half of the acorn squash with 3 small turnips chopped, skin on.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

Good start, but needs something.  Needs some more spice and something else, just not sure what.  Could be a 4 star with little work

Super meal! I cooked mine with a bit of stock so that I could cut way back on the fat. Somehow my squash overcooked but the flavor was amazing, and it was sooo filling! I made Baked Kale Chips from this site with my leftover greens.

The potatoes weren't quite tender enough after 25 minutes. So after adding the kale and sage, I put the top on the skillet while cooking the remaining 5 minutes. This was a quick dish. Tasty!

This was delicious. We used mustard greens instead of kale. The shitake mushrooms were great- be prepared though, they are expensive. I kept eating this, so healthy and flavorful.

very good and healthy, my first time ever using acorn squash and second ever time using kale. It was a little bland for my taste, I added feta cheese on top and that helped for the most part.

I brought this dish to Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a huge hit.  I substituted sweet potatoes for the Yukon Gold potatoes, and the colors were beautiful.  Even vegetable-haters loved them.  Several people have asked for the recipe.

I didn't have all the ingredients for this dish so I just cooked the potatoes as directed with shallots, seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder and added the kale in the last 5 min.  It was terrific and since it was a much simpler dish, my kids agreed to try it!  Next time I'll try the whole recipe, but this was a good modification.

Because I had all the ingredients on hand except for shallots, I used regualr onions and seasoned it up with a touch of chili powder and oregano just for a bit more flavor. Original recipe was fantastic, just wanted to spice it up.  :)

This dish was absolutely delicious. My family are skeptical about trying new dishes but to their surprise they really enjoyed this dish.  I did not include the mushroom or the kale in this dish. Hopefully, the next time I make this dish the grocery store will have kale in stock.

Delicious and flexible, I substituted a few things based on what was in the house -- I used regular mushrooms, no peppers, half an acorn squash instead of a whole, and dried sage. Next time I think I will double the kale since it is the most healthy thing in there and it shrinks down so much. 
Hubby loved it, and he is not a fan of kale or squash. I think it was all the olive oil and butter and a liberal dash of salt that brought the flavors together so well. I'll be keeping this in the recipe box.

Really tasty!  I added two teaspoons of Italian seasoning to increase the flavor, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for a great recipe.
