Note from the recipe writer: This is meant to be a dry cocktail pizza. However, if you prefer a wetter one, try mixing a bit of ricotta cheese with olive oil, then spread on crust before adding the other indredients. It's very good and a bit mellower than the original. I'm giving 5 stars to the amended version--it's my friend Lori's innovation.

Very tastey.  I'd recommend blending the oil olive into the goat cheese, and then spreading it on the crust.  Then press the onions, seeds, and thinly sliced figs into the cheese before you bake.  Otherwise, the toppings tend to fall off when you try to eat it.  Just increase the cheese and oil until it's moist enough for you.

Used a ready-made pizza crust and fresh figs instead of dried. Outstanding recipe! I did reduce the fennel a tad because I don't care for it that much. Went great with a bottle of cab.

I loved this recipe! I made it on sliced baguettes instead of pizza crust and it was a huge success. Everyone at my party loved them and they were gone in an instant!

I love goat cheese stuffed figs so I love the idea of the pizza. Changes I made: fresh, sliced figs, 1 thinly sliced shallot, and a ready made Naan crust, topped with fresh parsley. I did not carmelize the shallot as the oven did the work. I brushed olive oil on the crust, then sprinkled it with coarse sea salt and fresh ground pepper before adding the toppings...10 minutes @ 400 and it was done. I added a photo. Delicious and easy for summer! Next time I will add proscuitto as well!

This makes a regular appearance anywhere I go.  I simplify it by using store-bought dough.  I mix some of the cheese with a little fig (or sometimes rasp/cranberry)preserves to moisten it a bit and then add figs generously on top.  Skip everything else. Super simple and tasty.

Turned out great. I added a little drizzle of acacia honey and fresh ground pepper, and used frozen quartered figs instead of dried. It impressed a bunch of my French friends-- irrefutable proof of a good recipe!

Always looking for untraditional pizza recipes. Love goat cheese and figs. Used fresh figs which were excellent. Don't skimp on the onion or dried spices.

We've eaten this time and time again. My kids love it and so did my neighbors when I served it as an appetizer at a neighborhood party. I dried and froze fresh figs. They worked perfectly well once re-hydrated by putting in boiled water and sitting for 10 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used flat bread for the crust - which worked wonderfully! Plus, I added basil leaves and covered them with the cheese. Delicious! Figs are an inexpensive alternative to sun-dried tomatoes.

The flavor combinations of this pizza are simply amazing.  I could not find fresh figs so I spread some organic fig jam on the dough after the olive oil.  I also used a bit of mozzarella cheese, then topped with goat cheese and a bit of ricotta as well, which really mellowed out the tartness of the goat cheese.  Really incredibly delicious.

This was delicious!  Great onion mixture with thyme and fennel.  I took one reviewer's advice and put the goat cheese first.  I couldn't finish it all and it has been good for days after.  I also used the Whole Foods brand 365 Whole Wheat Pizza Crust - yum!

I wish it had the amount of figs in cup measurements as I have never used dried figs before and mine were quite small.  I prob used 2x as many figs so there was more sauce.

Wowzas!  This was my husband's attempt at pizza (more specifically first attempt at anything other than a sandwich or something grilled) and it was fantastic.  The flavors are matches made in heaven.  He used a ready made dough from Trader Joe's and a goat cheese already mixed with red peppers as well as adding more that were sauteed.  Hopefully I complimented it enough that we'll get a repeat performance!  Thank you!

I love homemade pizza, and I have a fig tree so this was perfect.  I used pre-made pizza dough (for convenience), fresh figs & added some mozzarella.  It turned out terrific!  I never knew figs and onions would go so well on a pizza.

I put this over brown rice instead of on pizza dough because I was too lazy to make my own and didn't have any store bought lying around the house. I subbed herbs de provence for the thyme and fennel, which actually worked out well. I would say this is delicious, but on the dry side.

AMAZING!  I took some other reviewers suggestions and blended feta and EVOO to spread on first, then added the fig and onion mixture per the recipe (except used fresh green figs) and added proscuitto.  My husband and I ate the whole thing!  This is the kind of food that you will crave until you can make it again.  Love it!

Delicious flavor combiniation!! I added a little red pepper flakes because we like everything a little spicy. We are harvesting from our fig tree every couple of days and looking for interesting recipes to use them.  This one is a keeper.

Great gourmet flavor pairing. I made mine into a main course pizza by adding some plain tomato sauce, with tomato paste, garlic and a pinch of sugar, and adding a light sprinkling of mozzarella before layering the fresh fig slices, goat cheese, and red onions. The fennel added something special, although this flavor is not for everyone (boyfriend didn't like the fennel, but said it would be great without it). As for the pizza dough, I cannot rate, because the boyfriend made his own special dough.

Used a medium to large sweet onion instead of the red onion.  I had fresh figs, so I diced them and added them to the onions for a few minutes at the end.  I also added some chopped fresh rosemary along with the thyme and fennel.  Didn't measure the goat cheese, just added what seemed to be enough and finished it off with a sprinkling of shredded Italian cheese mix.  A very good way to use up fresh figs!

Amazing flavor combination especially when you use fresh figs!  The suggestion for mozzarella added at the end was a great one, and processing the goat cheese with olive oil for the spread-ability was great.  This is a keeper for next year's fig season.

This pizza was great!  Unusual blend of flavors that we absolutely loved.  Used premade crusts instead of making our own, but it was still fantastic.

I made this fantastic recipe on the BBQ grill, and everyone loved it. Just roll out the dough into 2 circles, grill dough on medium about 5 minutes or until browned (lid down), take off grill with tongs, add the toppings (I mashed the goat cheese with olive oil and spread on the crust), put back on the grill, cover, and bake until the bottom is browned and the toppings are warmed. A 10-15 minute entree!

This was my first time with pizza dough. I bought frozen dough instead of making it from scratch. I had trouble rolling it out into a circle because I did not know that I should have used flour and a rolling pin. I will not make that mistake again. The taste of this pizza was great. It was a hit with my wife. I cannot wait to try it again without the mistakes.

I made it with store bought pizza dough ( in France, so it's thin and crusty). I added a layer of creme fraiche before loading on the figs/onions/herbs.  I also used fresh figs, sliced, not chopped. Great dish. Easy and tasty.

Divine! Great flatbread pizza. The combination of ingredients is fantastic. No need to change a thing.

This was soooooo good! I used fresh figs and follewed the recipe for the topping. For pizza dough I used a dough recipe that I use on the grill and grilled the pizza instead of in the oven. It gave it a little smokyness, very tasty!

The flavor combination of the sweetness of the figs with the bite of the goat cheese is wonderful.

I found this a bit dry, even after increasing the fig count to 10 and using a large onion. My pizza was roughly 12" in diameter, so I'm not sure what I missed.  Next time, I'll use a wetter goat cheese and maybe add a bit of proscuitto.
