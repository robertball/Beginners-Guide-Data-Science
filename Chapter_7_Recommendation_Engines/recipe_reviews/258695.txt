In my original recipe I stated any nut milk or animal milk could be substituted. I have used different milks and the flavor does not change. It still remains chocolatey and frothy with a coffee mocha taste.

7.12.17 I’m all in favor of saving a few calories whenever I can.  I used vanilla almond milk,  my choice of a sugar substitute is always Truvia®, and this recipe was calling my name.  Not only do I love the nutritional breakdown, the thing I liked the most about this drink is that the coffee and chocolate flavors share equally, without one dominating the other.  Creamy mocha-coffee flavor and with a little dollop of whipped cream, it’s almost like dessert.  Very, very nice and refreshing.  This reviewer is an Allrecipes Allstar.

Oh my goodness this was absolutely decadent without all the guilt!!!  I used almond milk with vanilla and it was perfect!  I loved this recipe!!!  I did cheat a little bit and served it with a chocolate cookie straw!

Loved it!  I used regular milk and a sweetened hot chocolate mix, so I eliminated the sweetener. It was creamy, frothy, mocha-y and delicious!

I loved this! Using coffee ice cubes is how I make coffee drinks all the time, except I've never tried using cocoa mix; that was a great idea! I used 1/2 c of coconut milk and skipped the hot water. I thought it was sweet enough without adding the packet of sweetner. I didn't mix a whole 2 T of chocolate syrup, but just swirled some in the glass and then topped the drink with some whipped cream and added another swirl of chocolate syrup. You've got a winner here--you get the feel of a shake, but you can lower the calories and fat! *This reviewer is an Allrecipes Allstar.

Loved it indeed! This is thick, rich and creamy like a milkshake. Certainly less caloric, but you'd never know when tasting it. Instead of adding the chocolate syrup to the shake, I swirled it around the glass making designs on the glass before filling them. It made lovely desserts on a hot afternoon.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was really tasty. I added the chocolate syrup to the glass as suggested by Buckwheat Queen. I liked that the drink was low calorie and didn't feel one bit guilty drinking it. I used skim milk because I am allergic to soy.  I don't know if it makes a difference, but I did let the cocoa cool down before I made the drink. Cherries and some low calorie Cool Whip didn't hurt either!  A great drink on a hot day! Thanks, Yoly for sharing your recipe! ***This reviewer is an Allrecipes Allstar.
