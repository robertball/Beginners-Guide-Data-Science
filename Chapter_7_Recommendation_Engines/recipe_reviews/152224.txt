This dish needs help. That's where my creative juices came in.  I realized this is a simple recipe for me to make and I could make it into a fake Shepard's Pie.  I added garlic, more onion, did half a bag of mixed veggies (frozen with green beans, carrots, and corn), an extra can of mushroom soup, mixed cheese and worsteshire sauce.  First I did the meat and mixed in the egg, worsteshire, and a can of mushroom soup.  I added salt, pepper and garlic to this mix.  I put this on the bottom of the casserole dish.  Next I mixed the frozen veggies (about half a bag), 1 whole onion, 1 cup of cheese.  I put this layer on top of the meat.  Next I put on a random amount of tater tots and used a spoon to spread the next can of mushroom soup over them.  I dotted them with the soup, because you want it to get soft when it bakes.  I took the last bit of cheese (I did a mixed bag of "taco mix" but cheddar or anything would be good) and spread a very thin layer over the tots and soup.  The effect is the meat gets lots of flavor without drying up, the veggies get cheesy, and the tots get soft almost like mashed potatoes but with texture.  My mix is more hearty, not much more expensive, and feeds a lot or gives good left overs.

I started out to make this exactly as written, but I was out of Cream of Chicken soup so I had to sub Cream of Mushroom, low fat.  I also was a little short on the tater tots, but in the end I think that was a good thing.  The meat kinda browns at this high temp, and the flavor is good.  The tater tots kinda get mushy, but the taste is good.  I admit that I used a turkey baster to suck out all the grease on the edges.  I will make again for a quick supper.  Thanks

For the meat, egg & onion mixture, I also threw in some frozen corn, season salt and minced garlic.  Cooked the mixture for 40 minutes at 450 degrees.  Then added the tater tots and cream of chicken and cooked at 425 degrees for another 20 minutes.  Great dish!

This is an easy dish that's easy to customize! I mostly stuck to the instructions as my father doesn't eat anything with a lot of "stuff" in it but I did add several tablespoons of queso, and used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, and frozen hash browns instead of tater tots (working with what I had on hand).

I kinda of tweaked this just a bit. I didn't add the egg, but I added corn and green peas. Everything else I think is perfectly fine! But if you wanted to kick it up a notch, adding bacon before the tater tots totally makes this recipe even better! Cook the bacon however you like (I like to pan fry it), and cut it up into crumbs. it's delish!!! Oh yeah, I also cooked the ground beef and seasoned with salt and a little black pepper, before putting it onto the pan. I think it works way better.

A easy recipe for a quick filling meal.  I added 1/2 packet of Lipton Garlic/Herb seasoning mix and mixed in with the meat, egg mixture.  I doubled this recipe and my husband loved it.  It would also probably be really good with a sprinkling of grated cheese melted on top for the last 5 or 10 minutes of baking.

Top was fine but the bottom ends up being a giant beef patty. Had to chop it up while serving.

Made as was written with 1 exception,  used Cream of Mushroom soup- it's what I had on hand.  Bottom of beef burned.  Will make again & reduce time from 1 hour to 45 minutes.  Will check temp. before removing it from the oven though.

My nine-year-old boy made this with a little help. We used shredded hashbrowns, added cheese at the beginning and the end on the top, Cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken soup and didn't put the cream of mushroom over-the-top like the recipe called for but mistakenly mixed it with the beef and egg...still delicious. Super easy!

An hour must have been too long because it was very dry and a little burnt on the bottom. I didn't like the separation of the meat and the tater tots. The hamburger needed salt and the the tater tot portion was too salty. If you ate them together they balances out. basically dry and plain tasting.

this was so tasty. I didn't have a can of soup so I made up some white sauce using chicken broth for 1/2 of the liquid. Lots of stirring to make the white sauce but well worth it.  I baked it just like the recipe, however I did add some crunched up potato chips with a little grated cheddar cheese the last 15 min.  Also I doubled the recipe.
