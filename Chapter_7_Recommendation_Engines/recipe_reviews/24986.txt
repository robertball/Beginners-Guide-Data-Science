This is a great recipe. Just like a previous rating, I found this as the 'hummingbird cake'. I made a few changes that makes it healthier and just a tasty. I replaced sugar with splenda brand sweetener and replaced approx. 1/2 of the oil with applesauce. My family can't get enough, and despite my diabetes I can eat some to. I also made a glaze from the splenda and spread on top of it. I made mine in a 9 1/2" x 13 1/2" pan.

The cake is fabulous when made by the original recipe. I also make a browned butter glaze for the cake.Melt 1/3 cup butter on medium heat till golden brown.Add 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 1/2 t. vanilla and 3 T. warm water. Stir till mixed and quickly drizzle over cooled cake. Top with chopped pecans.

I have had this receipe for 30 years and my receipe calls for only 1-1/2 C sugar, 1 C oil, no nuts and an UNDRAINED 8oz can of crushed pineapple.   Easy and delicious.

This recipe has been a favorite in my family for three generations - that I know of - only we know it as Hummingbird Cake and ice it with cream cheese frosting. I thought it was a family secret until I looked in Allrecipes.com and found Hummingbird Cake 1, 11, 111, etc. Whenever I don't have quite enough bananas, I add chopped fresh apples or whole cranberries to make up the volume. I bake in 3 cake layer pans so there's lots of area to spread that luscious frosting!

What a WONDERFUL & DELICIOUS bundt cake! I omitted the nuts (I have a young son who can't eat them yet), but it is truly a great tasting cake.

This has been a family favorite for over a year now.  I made it once for a friend when I lived in England, and she and her whole family thought it was the best cake ever.  I make it at home all the time when I have leftover ripe bananas.  It's easy to make, easy cleanup, and everyone loves it.  We bake it in a bundt pan, no frosting, and eat it as a morning coffee cake or afternoon tea cake.  Oh and I also usually only use like 1 1/2 cups sugar and that is PLENTY.  This makes cute little mini bundt cakes as well.

This is a wonderful moist cake that requires no frosting.  (It is called Hummingbird Cake if it has a cream cheese frosting)  It needs to bake only 65-70 minutes though.

I used a cup of melted butter instead of vegetable oil and a half cup of FF sour cream. I didn't have enough vegetable oil on hand.....rare occurance. I made no other changes. Simple enough to throw together quickly with ingredients I usually have on hand. This came out incredibly moist and dense. I mixed together the dry ingredients in my Kitchen Aid mixer first, then added all the wet, only mixing until just moistened. A little over halfway through, I covered the bundt cake with foil to keep it from burning on top. If I were to make this again, I'd cut back on the sugar by at least half. Way too sweet. Good flavor, just too sweet.

This is my new favorite recipe.  I doubled the batch and put half in a bundt pan and the other half in mini loaf pans.  I sent the bundt cake to work with my husband and took a loaf to work with me...the cake was a BIG hit.  I made an icing for the top with the left over pineapple juice to "fancy" up the presentation.

This is an old family favorite.  Over the years, though, I've reduced the oil and sugar each by half, and I actually like the flavor and texture much better this way.  I've even baked it for wedding cakes--it's always good!

I WOULD HAVE RATED THIS RECIPE ANOTHER STAR - BUT -GOOD THING I TASTED THE BATTER AFTER PUTTING 1 CUP OF SUGAR INTO IT (RECIPE CALLED FOR 2 CUPS SUGAR) IT WAS VERY SWEET WITH 1 CUP (I DO LIKE SWEET THINGS) I'M SURPRISED THAT OTHER PEOPLE DIDN'T MENTION THIS.

I wanted to make this cake but didn't have any oil so I subbed it with 3/4 cup melted butter and 3/4 cup greek yogurt.  It's in the oven so I won't know for awhile how it turns out.  Looks good so far.  I wanted to make note of my substitution but can't see a spot to put them in with the changes on this site.

I've made this delicious bundt a few times. The  pineapple, banana, walnuts make it quite a treat. Yes, it does not last! 
Another to try is "White Chocolate Pound Cake". Calls for 5 (FIVE) eggs!

This is my 'go to' cake when I have ripe bananas hanging around.  I add 1 cup of unsweetened, shredded coconut and use pecans instead of walnuts.  Also, I use butter instead of vegetable oil.  Always tastes great and is gone very quickly!

I originally did not like this cake much. I ate a piece about an hour after it was out of the oven. It was too much like bread, I thought. The next day the cake was so much better. I am a beginner cook, so perhaps I didn't blend the ingredients properly to obtain the correct density. I only changed the recipe by omitting the nuts as my husband doesn't eat them. It cooked in my oven for 65 minuites and it was done. The pineapple flavor was missing. It tasted fine, but I really wanted it to be better. I love bananna bread and this is similar. I think it would have been better with a glaze over it.

Made this for my mom's 78th birthday and it was loved by all. I subbed applesauce for half of the oil and heated a can of cream cheese frosting in the microwave and used it as a glaze to drizzle over the top and sides. So good and thank you Jenny!

Followed one suggestion to use half the oil and add 3/4 cup of applesauce; that worked. Used fresh pineapple, as that's what I had (macerated in the food processor). Used 4 ripe but not overripe bananas. Very tasty, and I don't expect it to be around long.

I made this today, after seeing if I could find the recipe I've been using since my next doot neighbor gave me her "Blender Banana Bundt Cake" recipe in 1973.  As others have said, way, way too sweet and felt the cinamon to be out of place.  I've had one slice and will be taking it to a meeting to see if others will eat it.  My recipe, which is so very close to it has 1 cup sugar, no cinamon, no nuts and 1 cup oil. It's baked at 350 for 65-70 minutes.  As such, in the end, the calorie count will be much less.  Think I'll stick with my 44 year old recipe (where all of the wet ingredients go into a blender, then are folded into the dry ingredients.)

My husband and I love it and will most definitely make it again! So easy. The only change I made was using pecans rather than walnuts.

Pretty dry.  Definitely more of a bread than a cake.  Topped it with vanilla ice cream.

Original recipe made on 1st attempt.  Recipe as submitted was a little to sweet for my taste.  2nd attempt, I cut oil & sugar in half.  Added 3/4 cup applesauce.  2nd attempt was a keeper in my recipe book.

Delicious!  I had some ripe bananas that I didn't want to make into banana bread,  and some leftover crushed pineapple so I decided to try this recipe.  I did cut the sugar back to 1 1/3 and it was plenty sweet. I probably used double the pineapple with the liquid & only 2/3 cup of oil. It was nice & moist. I also substituted coconut for the walnuts and added some rum extract as well as the vanilla to give it more of a pina colada taste.  Then ,what the heck, I also threw in a few tablespoons of grated orange zest.  The cake was so good.  I did make the brown butter glaze like one of the other reviews suggested too.  Sure is a nice change from the same old banana bread.

We cute the oil and sugar by 1/2C each, but did add 1/2C honey. Since we were a little short on  banana, we added more pineapple. Baked up real nice, in a little less than 75 minutes, and we let it cool in the pan for about 20 minutes before turning out on a cooling rack. Tastes basically like a sweet, very moist banana bread; no frosting needed.

Fantastic recipe!  Took a chance and made it for company.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out moist, delicious, and rose beautifully in the bundt pan!  My company just loved the moistness, and even took some slices home.  My husband is not a cake person, but he snuck down in the middle of the night just to sneak another piece!  Wow!  I'm so glad I tried it.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!

FANTASTIC!  I'm always looking for yummy new recipes for old bananas and this is one of my absolute favorites!  My only change was substitute 1/2 applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil.  (I would have replaced half the oil with applesauce, but I didn't have enough.)  Thank you for sharing!

I love this cake, I made it for my co-workers and it was gone in 2 min! I use 1 cup of cinnamon applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil instead of the 1 1/2 cups of oil and its just delicious it comes out better in a silicone bundt "pan" and I always have enough batter for a small bread pan. making it to give to neighbors and friends for christmas!

I made this for my mom's birthday. I had made hummingbird cake before and wasn't happy, infact I'd decided not to make it again! This looked tempting enough for me to give it a chance - and I'm so glad I took it! 

I made it in a normal pan, and subbed a mix of nuts since I ran out of walnuts. That apart, I followed it to the T and I'm glad I did. Thanks for a lovely recipe!

I made this cake last night (exactly as written, only without nuts) and put 'The Last Cream Cheese Frosting Recipe You'll Truly Ever Need' on it and gave it to a friend today, and she gave me a slice to bring home.  Yum!!  The cake is delicious, and the icing adds even more to it.  I think it will be even better the next time I make it if I add walnuts (and maybe a little extra crushed pineapple or chopped apples??)  I can't wait to make another one of these!  Thanks for a great recipe Jenny!

My husband ate half this cake the first night I made it. I took it work and it was gone. Your right it didn't last long. Thanks for the recipe. I had some leftover bananas and pineapple. It was perfect.

This is the same recipe I've made for years and it has always been my very, very favorite banana cake. I would give it 10 stars if I could. The only difference is my recipe calls for dicing the bananas instead of mashing them. It also states "stir the mixture just to blend, but do not beat." It is high in calories so the next time I make it, I may take other's suggestions to cut back on the oil and sugar.

Very, very good!
I used 1/2 applesauce/oil instead of all oil.  Very good!
I also frosted mine with cream cheese frosting!  Perfect for our first fall dessert!

I agree this is an absolutely delicious cake,  It is moist cake,  I never have leftovers.   I had this recipe and it was lost I am thrilled to have it again.  Sometime I drizzle frosting over it while it is still warm.
