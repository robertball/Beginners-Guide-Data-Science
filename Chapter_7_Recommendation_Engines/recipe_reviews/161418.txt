My whole family went nuts over this desert.  I used Pinova apples freshly picked from the orchard and added a little cinn to the actual syrup while it was cooking.  The crumbles turned out just right and I will definitely use this recipe for all time!

I had sweeter apples and they worked just fine. Enjoy.

The Crunch Topping was really good although it could have used more cinnamon.  I thought about adding more, but didn't and wish I had.  It said to slice the apples thin, so I did and they turned out like applesauce.  I baked it for the exact amount of time that recipe indicated.  I probably will make this again, but will add quite a bit more cinnamon to the crunch and also to the syrup.

We all loved it. I recommend adding cinnamon to the syrup mixture. Highly recommended.
