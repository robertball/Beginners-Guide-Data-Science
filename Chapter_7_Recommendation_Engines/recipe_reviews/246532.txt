The spices in this recipe were phenomenal!! I know I hate reviews where they don't make the recipe per directions/ingredients, however I had forgotten to add the cream cheese and sour cream since I was going by memory..ugh. I really wanted to follow the ingredients. BUT, it still  tasted extraordinary without those two ingredients because the spices were so good! I did add a lot of milk which made it thinner so it's easier to pour over the chips (maybe the cream cheese and sour cream would've done just the same, but tasted more creamier?) . I loved the review of someone saying they added salsa to theirs instead of Rotel tomatoes because I, too, don't have Rotel handy, but I did have salsa! The salsa was really good in it. I just added a few tablespoons.  Very great recipe and next time I will do it the way it's written and I'm sure it will still taste 5-star worthy! :) Thanks for this recipe!

We LOVED this dip!  I do not keep Rotel(R) on hand, as we really don't care that much for it, so I used salsa instead, which worked perfectly. This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was looking for something different from my standard melted "cheese product" plus Rotel to make for nachos supreme.  This is SO lick-the-spoon good!  Only change I made was I used butter instead of veg. oil.  It makes a lot - which is great for a party, but next time I make it for the family, I will half the recipe.  I will never go back to "cheese product" nacho cheese!

This was a big hit with me and the kiddos! I used diced green chiles instead of the Rotel (what I had on hand) and left out the black pepper (because black pepper doesn't belong in everything). It was super quick and easy to make and really satisfied my nacho craving!

Turned out so good. Very easy to make. I made 1/2 the recipe and there's still a lot left!! The only substitute I made were to things I had on hand-I subbed Neufchâtel for cream cheese, plain yogurt for sour cream and the habanero Rotel. So yummy, I will def make again!

Just made this tonight to go with our burgers and it was excellent! Made a couple revisions to the ingredients to suit what I had on-hand but still fantastic!

I made half the amount and didn’t have chili powder, but added in some cayenne instead. Next time, I might use less cheddar and see if that makes it a little hotter.

We really enjoyed this cheese sauce.  I did not add the cumin and it tasted good!

It was ok, but there is just no replacing that fake cheese we all love.
