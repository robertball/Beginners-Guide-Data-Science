I didn't have file powder and I really don't know what it is or where to buy it. However, the food still turned out good by replacing it with 2 bouillion cubes of beef or chicken. Yummmmm.

A keeper! I fried the onion and okra in a small amount of bacon fat and omitted the bacon. Also threw in a little garlic and green pepper. Used fresh okra and fresh tomatoes and canned corn. My husband likes spicy so I divided the recipe and added cayenne pepper to his half. Everyone was happy!

I did not have file powder (& also don't know what it is) so I seasoned with garlic salt, cumin, salt, pepper and a little red cayenne pepper.  It really was wonderful.  I used fresh okra and fresh sweet corn scraped from the cob.  Yummy!

Just for informational purposes, as I read many comments about "file powder" (not having it, and not knowing what it is).

File (pronounced [FEE-lay]) powder is one of the key ingredients in making gumbo and has a distinctive "root beer" flavor. File powder is made from the dried ground leaves of the sassafras tree. They were believed to have been first used by the Choctaw Indians from Louisiana bayou region.Today the powder is used to both thicken and flavor gumbo.

I never liked okra as a child (slimy suckers).  I made this dish for my father.  My father, husband and son loved it (I loved it. have not eaten okra for ten yrs).. Great dish.

I was looking for a way to make okra from our garden other than frying it and this is delicious!  I also used onions and tomatoes from the garden and fresh corn I cut off the cob.  I happened to have file powder, so this was a winner!  I'd say you really don't have to cook it as long as it calls for, though.

This is awesome!! The family loved it. Alterations I made were: 10 slices of already cooked bacon, 3 tablespoons olive oil, 1/4 cup large yellow(sweet) onion diced in big pieces, 2 cloves garlic sliced, 1-15 oz frozen okra, 1/2 bag frozen corn, 1 can of petite diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil, Sea salt &  cayenne pepper to taste. Cooked as per recipe. This  is a keeper.

I'm trying to eat healthier, so I've been looking for ways to prepare fresh okra other that frying.  This is very tasty, quick & easy to make.  My husband raved about it & is looking forward to the leftovers.  I changed the amount of file powder to 1 tsp. instead of 1 Tb, because I wasn't sure how strong the flavor would be.  And I shortened the first cooking time by 5 min. This will certainly become one of our favorite side dishes.

This was really good. I did make some changes because I didn't have the file powder. So instead I substituted ground cummin and also used a little cilantro. I also used about 3 tblsp of olive oil to cook the okra and onions, then poured in a pouch of real bacon bits. I used fresh okra and cherry tomatoes from our garden with two nice spicey chopped jalepeno peppers. And just poured in a can of whole kernel corn (drained). The flavors were wonderful together and gave it just the right amount of "bite" that my family enjoys. We served it hot over cornbread. A definite hit for my family. Will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe :-)

I didn't try this recipe as I've been making it for years with shrimp and sausage. Try it with stewed tomatoes. File powder is ground sassafras and can be found in Texas and Louisiana in the spice section. It's a base for gumbo.

This is a great side dish.  I made a few adjustments of my own including substituting italian sausage for bacon, fresh okra, canned corn, minced garlic, olive oil, white wine, dash of cayenne and chili powder in addition to the pepper all ready listed in the recipe.  The results were magnificent.  :)

Absolutely delicious.  Don't keep file powder on hand, but I did use a few shakes of Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning to jazz it up.  I also add a couple of tablespoons of sugar because I love for my okra, corn, and 'maters to be sweet.  I make this dish at least 3-4 times during sweet corn season.

Yum, we both loved it. Omitted the bacon and fried with 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tsp liquid smoke instead. Used a large fresh tomato. Seasoned with cumin, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.

Made this with fresh tomatoes, fresh okra, fresh corn taken off the cob,.   Did not use file; substituted with fresh dill.  (Can use perhaps comino powder, or a little sage)  Also added lemon juice in substitute for vinegar, to help cut down the slime.  Very tasty

I'm a novice cook but a big veggie lover. This was great; I had too many tomatoes and not enough okra. I'll make adjustments on the next round. Well done recipe and easy to follow for the "non" cooks.

I was suprised that I didn't like this dish...  Especially after reading the 5 star reviews... Maybe it was because I added the entire tablespoon of File powder??  It had a very strange flavor - that I'm afraid ruined an otherwise good dish!?  In fact - no one in my family liked it!

Since I grew up in New Orleans, I reduced the amount of File Powder, and added minced garlic to the recipe.It was great. Most Cajun & Creoles added garlic to this dish.

Louisiana version of a low country (coastal N. GA,  SE SC favorite. Okra, an african staple is always a favorite however, first time using file. Also, cooked and served with a tender ham hock (or several)  and serving with or orer white rice converts this side into a whole meal. Always served with a splash of Tabasco or pepper vinegar.

Substituted lima beans for okra and it was delicious!  Also didn't have file powder so I used creole seasoning and crushed red pepper.

We could not find file powder so we didn't use anything in its place. Everyone at the Mardi Gras potlock liked. I would like to try it with the file powder.

This is a wonderful dish.  I wanted to make it as the entree, so I added bay scallops and served it over creamy grits.  My family and friends request this all the time.  BTW - I used scallops because I'm allergic to shrimp but I bet shrimp would be excellent.  Another time I added andouille sausage in addition to the scallops - amazing!

I made this for vegetarian friends so omitted the bacon.  Also, I used fresh okra, fresh corn cut off the cob, and fresh tomato. It was delicious. Everyone ate it up and I will make it again, maybe with the bacon.

I think fresh corn and tomatoes would have made this dish better--why use canned/frozen when you can have fresh?

This was a staple in my house growing up! I still make this today and my mom and I have tried some variations. We have never used file powder, always boullion cubes. Also, sometimes we add green beans to the mixture. We also like to eat this as a soup, using a broth base and adding either ground beef or sliced link sausage. It is so good!!! Leftovers are even better!

I'd give it a low four because I think the  corn took away from the flavor of the okra (my nephew, who enjoys a lot of the vegetable recipes I get off this site, agreed). I used Trader Joe's frozen sweet corn. Plus I only used a 16 oz bg and it was still way too much corn.  I'd use less or no corn next time. Otherwise the flavor was good. 

I'm surprised people have a problem finding file powder.  It is gumbo file and should be available with the creole seasonings in most big supermarkets.

This was a decent dish. It was the first time I'd cooked okra, and the first time I'd used filé powder. I made the recipe exactly as written (I didn't find the okra and corn in the package sizes given, so I measured them out from 16 and 32 oz. packages respectively.)

Good, however, not so sure that I liked the bacon in it.  Next time, I think I will use smoked sausage.  The combination of veggies turned out great.

This was very very good I wanted to try okra so I planted it in my garden knowing nothing about what to do with it.  This was very good and the corn made it great The only thing I would add is hot peppers and or a little brown sugar.  I also added salt, pepper, cuman, and garlic salt.  Because of these addtions I gave it 4 stars but with the additions I would give it 5 stars

I have never used file powder before and chose to make this recipe without. Since it's august, the 3 main veggies are in season so I used fresh. It was very good but was missing just a little something. I'm now going to keep my eye out for file powder (I'm in CA) and give this another try if I ever find it.

This is such a great southern classic.  I used all fresh vegetables, since everything is ready in the garden at the same time. So good! . Add some hot corn bread and put on your elastic waist pants!

Made this for the second time last night and it was as good as I remembered.  Okra is "new" for me - after experiencing the slimy sort when I was a kid - and I'm so happy to be able to introduce my kids to okra with a great recipe like this!  Completely non-slimy!!  Added a couple cloves of garlic with the onion, used about a tbsp of olive oil to saute the onion and garlic, and didn't have any file powder, so used some Cajun seasoning.  Also used a combination of fresh and canned tomatoes, and fresh okra from the farmer's market.  So glad I tried this - you won't be disappointed!

The recipe was good and for a few of you readers that don't know what file is...It's a spice you use in gumbo's. You can find it in the seasoning section of the grocery store, or by the section in the store for gumbo making and crab and shrimp boils.

I made this recipe as written except I used creole seasoning instead of file powder because that's what I had on hand. It turned out stupendous! I really loved the flavor. It was my 1st time using okra. I was a little apprehensive because of the slime factor involved, but it wasn't a problem. I also didn't have bacon or onions so I used canola oil and onion powder. Very simple recipe.

I really liked this recipe.  It was a perfect to use up some okra and also another good use for file powder, which is not used in that many recipes and so hard to find in my town I had to get some in New Orleans.  I can tell the file powder is really what made it special though, so try not to skip this.

Another wow!  I've never liked okra and had a dear neighbor hand us a bunch of fresh okra yesterday.  I knew he'd ask us if we enjoyed his okra and wanted to be able to answer him honestly.  I was happy to find this recipe with all the positive reviews.  To a Dutch oven I added and crisped the diced bacon.  Set aside to drain on paper towels reserving a tiny bit of the bacon fat.  Sauteed the onion and okra.  Added undrained tomatoes and leftover cooked ground turkey.  Added a can of water.  Simmered for about 20 minutes, added the file' powder, which was easy to find in the creole section of the spices.  The file' powder really makes this recipe.  I added leftover corn and salted and peppered as needed.

My husband really liked this but I did change the recipe a little. Instead of bacon, I used 1 package of linguisa. I didn't bother with file powder since linguisa is spicy by itself. At the end, I threw in a few eggs and cooked it. It didn't look that appetizing but it was really tasty. I will definitely prepare this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I fry 4 slices of bacon until crispy, then remove from the pan. Fry the onion in the bacon fat until it starts to soften, then add okra(I use fresh). Then add the corn (fresh again). Finish with the file powder, 1 tbsp. Worcestershire, and Louisiana hot sauce to taste . Add the tomatoes and simmer. Sprinkle with the crumbled bacon and serve. A family favorite !

Leave out the bacon - really does not need pig grease to be good. I used all fresh veggies, real tomatoes (not canned), corn cut off the cob, and fresh okra.  Add red pepper flakes and a can of tomato sauce. No added salt either- there’s plenty in the canned sauce.  Now *that’s* a healthy recipe.

Also didn't have file, used a combination of garlic, cumin, chile powder. Had all fresh veggies from the garden to use up and this was great!

I've been making this most of my life. I live in the Southwest now where okra is a rarity (except at buffets, and it's always fried). We went to a You Pick Em farm and I was in okra heaven! No file powder, I put in a little beef bullion. Serve over rice! Yummy!

Very good. It has a nice mix of flavors. I will reduce the FIle to 1/2 tablespoon next time. There will certainly be a next time. 
I served it as a side dish with the Cuban-Style Pork and Sweet Potatoes recipe for a very delicious dinner.

I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   The family was asking for more, but I did not make enough.  This dish will definitely be in the family meals rotation in the future.

I'm a vegetarian but love okra, corn and tomatoes. So... I used olive oil to cook the okra and onions (red). Browned them nicely. Added some fire-roasted canned tomatoes which helped to deglaze the pan. Simmered for 20 minutes. Added fresh corn from one cob, salt, file powder and pepper. I found it got a little dry so i added some water to continue the simmering. All in all.... DELICIOUS!

Great recipe if you want to do something different with okra.  I made it over and over again this past summer.  Also, you don't have to use the bacon if you don't want the added fat, it turns our great using just a little olive oil to cook the okra first.

I didn't use the file powder either, but substituted garlic salt, onion flakes,and black pepper instead. I also substituted a 1 1/2 cups of fresh  orange cherry tomatoes instead of the canned and fresh okra from the garden instead of frozen.  It was awesome and my kids liked it too!!!

I was looking for a good recipe for okra. This was quick, easy, and excellent in flavor.  I served this with grilled chicken.  The only changes I made was to use fresh okra and tomato.  Everything else was the same.  Awesome!!!!  Thanks for sharing.

I couldn't find my file, so maybe the 4 star isn't fair. I thought it was excellent however, and a great way to use okra without resorting to frying. Forgot the garlic, unfortunately.

I loved this recipe! "Southern" vegetables are a new thing to me and I am enjoying experimenting and using the recipes from here to try things in new ways! I did this on the spur of the moment after purchasing fresh okra from the fruit/veggie stand down the road, so I altered it by using fresh okra and went with another reviewers suggestion of cutting down the corn! It is awesome and NOT goopy like some okra recipes I've made! A much better alternative to breading/frying healthwise! THUMBS up!

This was great! I decided to buy some file powder on ebay and wait till I received it.
It turned out great. I did have to add some extra water while simmering.

Added roasted poblano pepper left from another recipe, frozen black eyed peas and proscuitto instead of bacon to this classic.  My mom who grew up in N. Florida said it was better than what she remembered from her childhood.

I always hated okra as a kid but my mother always boiled it (to death).With three kids, I'm always looking for new ways to fix vegetables to teach the kids that good nutrition doesn't have to mean boring. This was it. My daughters devoured it, and my picky, veggie HATING
son simply ate it without a fuss-that RARELY happens. So this one is going in the file for keeps. 
Personally, I try not to eat meat but I can handle the small amount of bacon used for flavoring in this. I'm going to try the recipe using olive oil and play with the seasonings a bit though to see if I can't make it more vegetarian friendly. Thanks for a great recipe!
