I've been making these for years- only 4 stars, because the butter content is too high.
Use 1 stick per 5 cups of pecans...melt the
butter in a shallow glass dish in the oven.
Stir in a dash of garlic powder. Add nuts, stir
gently until coated. Remove to baking pan with a SLOTTED spoon, to remove excess butter. Bake & shake every 10 minutes until
done to your taste. Enjoy!

I thought these were great.  I only had them in the oven about 25 minutes before they started looking like they were burning.  My oven is off quite a bit though.  Just peek at them every 10 minutes the first time you make them.  My husband thought they were a little too rich to eat on their own, but is taking some to work to put on his salad.  I might experiment with some additional seasonings next time.  Garlic salt or parmesan would be great.  Definitely a keeper.

I made these last Christmas for myself and friends.  They were delicious and easy - I do suggest that you keep an eye on them in order to keep them from getting overdone.

Okay...so I am saute'ing onions thinking the smell is so wonderful, when I decided to throw these pecans in the oven (for another recipe). Oh my goodness!  These are sinfully delicious!!!  They melt in your mouth and fragrance your house with a sweet scent.  I will make these agian for sure - if it were possible to rate this recipe more than 5 stars, consider that my rating!  YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!!!!!

I have made this recipe many times and use two egg whites slightly beaten to moisten the pecans with.  They are wonderful and less calories. Follow the recipe givn for oven temperature and cooking time.

It took all the self control I could muster not to polish these off myself!  The next time I make these I will cut down on the butter.  It took me quite a few paper towels to blot off the excess.  They only took 45 minutes in a 275 degree oven to toast up beautifully.

I use 4 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 tablespoon Tony's Seasoning.  1 cup of butter is way too much.

These are so great!  They were barely out of the oven and I had eaten a double handful.  I did save enough to give as a hostess gift along with some praline coffee.  I agree with other reviews that they may not need to be cooked for a whole hour..mine were plenty done in about 40 minutes.  I look forward to making these every holiday season!

Like others, I lowered the amount of butter.  I also added brown sugar to the butter, and while toasting I threw on some maple syrup.

delish!

The 1 stick of butter vs full cup is much better. There was still butter floating around on the tray. Cook only for 45 minutes. The hour mark many had over toasted and become yucky/ semi burnt even with stirring at 10 minutes.

EXCELLENT! I added them to the Holiday Chicken Salad from this site which made the salad over-the-top! I did use half the butter that the recipe called for and I toasted them for about 40 minutes. Definitely watch them closely because they burn very easily. O boy are they delicious! I was having a hard time saving them for the salad. I could have eaten the whole bowl full of them.

Having in-laws who grow pecans, there are always pecans around. You can use a microwave instead of oven. I use the same ingredients give or take amounts of butter and salt, depends on your taste. I add about a teaspoon of cold butter, couple of shakes of salt, a microwave dish, set on high for one minute  and stir between minutes. A cup of pecans can "roast" in about 5 minutes. My family loves this snack year round!

I omitted the salt and made a smaller portion and the pecans turned out awesome! I made them to top my french toast egg casserole; it was perfect combination with the creamy, sweet casserole and the crunchy pecan--yummy!

This is delicious. I do think there is a bit too much butter. Also tried with success adding Worcestershire  Sauce and garlic. Came out so good! And also tried with cinnamon and sugar which makes a great flavor!

Adjusted butter down to 2 Oz per 2 lbs of pecans.  Might lower butter just a little more next time (maybe - 0.5 oz)

Too much butter.  I used 1/2 cup per pound (4 cups) of pecans.  Was still a bit much.  I love butter - but not a fan of seeing the pecans swimming in it.  With less butter - this is a great recipe.  Added lots of salt then put them on paper towels to cool.

Pecan Perfection. These were a huge hit on the Thanksgiving appetizer table; everyone wanted the recipe. I did watch them as they baked, as I know nuts are easy to burn, and it was a bit less than one hour. I followed the rest of the recipe verbatim. I had a few stashed away to refill the plate but then forgot about them until the next day, when I tried them over vanilla ice cream. They were simply wonderful. Such an easy recipe and such a delightful treat.

I loved these pecans. I used pecans I bought at the farmers market, and they turned out beautifully. I accidentally used too much butter because I only had about four cups of pecans, and so it took about 75 minutes to bake, but I think as long as you keep an eye on them and stir periodically there's almost no way you can mess this recipe up.

Modified the amount of butter for a little over 3 cups of fresh GA pecans to 1/4 cup. Ended up in the over for about 40 minutes (I was paranoid of overcooking them based on some of the other reviews so I kept checking about every ten minutes after an initial time of 15.)  Couldn't be a more simple recipe though and so tweakable to your taste, although these sweet, fresh GA pecans didn't need more than a little butter and salt! :-)

Too buttery.  Read a few reviews and take the advice from those who tweaked the recipe!

Delish. I used the toasted pecans for a candy recipe (mini Pretzels, Rolo Caramel candy, & pecan halves). Perfectly toasted to bring out the flavor.
