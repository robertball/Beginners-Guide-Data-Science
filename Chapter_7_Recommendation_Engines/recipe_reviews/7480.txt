FABULOUS!!! I gave this out over the holidays and everyone raved and wanted the recipe! I did make a few changes... I used Meyers rum instead of white rum in both the cake & the glaze.  I also substituted brown sugar for the white sugar in the glaze.  I used mini Bundt pans (to make 6 cakes)and decreased the cooking time until a toothpick or knife inserted came out clean.

What could be better than chocolate and rum mixed together?  My only suggestions are that you use light rather than white rum, and make it a day ahead so that the flavors have time to improve.  This cake is delicious and moist, plus it's easy to make.  MMMM!!

A year ago, at this time, I was looking for something different to make for a friend and I found this recipe.  I started with one cake and ended with eight. This year it is my gift to all my dear friends.  My "secret ingredient" is actually a silicon bunt pan. ( I now own 3) Once the cake comes out and cools a bit, pour the glaze on and go to bed.  In the morning peel the glaze soaked cake easily out of the pan, wrap tightly and refrigerate for a couple of days to "cure". Put it on a pretty plate, and if you have the energy drizzle it with some melted chocolate.  I use dark rum in the glaze because my friends are so spirited. :)

Made cake for my mother's bridge group.  Poked holes in top of cake with long two prong fork (after baking.) Then I used measuring cup to pour small amounts of glaze, repeating procedure after glaze soaked into cake.   The men liked the cake because it was not too sweet and had a lot of moisture.  It probably tasted better because I made day before serving, refrigerated overnight, cut in serving pieces about four hours before serving at room temperature.

There's no mistaking this for a scratch cake.  It's so obviously a boxed mix even with the rum.  If you want an authentic fresh tasting rum cake try the Brown Sugar Rum Cake instead.

Yum!  Very easy, tasty and it smells fabulous.  It was a big hit at a recent family Christmas party.  I used Myers Rum instead of white rum in both cake and glaze, replaced a little of the water in the glaze with rum, and replaced 1/2 C of white sugar with dark brown sugar in the glaze as well.  I may add a little cinnamon to this one next time.

Very good and moist! I'm a "scratch" baker and thought it would taste like a boxed recipe but surprisingly good! I cut down the sugar a bit for the glaze but excellent! gobbled up. Lots of ideas for variations.

Great! Very easy recipe for such a nice cake. I didn't have any regular white rum so I used coconut flavored rum. It didn't get a coconut flavor like I thought it would and it was still great.  My cake turned out very moist. The only problem was that I had no leftovers to take home.

The batter is very dense, which I wasn't expecting.  Also, I recommend making this a day ahead to let the rum glaze sink in.  It will be moister.

High altitude changes.  Add 2 TBL. flour, 1 TBL oil, 1 TBL rum or water. I also poked holes in the cake while it was still in the pan with a wood screwier poured half the glaze. The turn it on a plate and poked more holes and rest of the glaze. I then made a chocolate rum ganache.  1 cup heavy cream to boil. poured it over 9 oz bittersweet chocolate and 1 TBL. rum. then drizzled it over the cake I refrigerated overnight. Then place  12 whole pecans identifying each piece. It was a smash at the party.

Ok licking the spoon and bowl of this cake is twice as fun as a normal cake!!!

This cake was amazing!!! 

Everyone liked it, even my mother... who is critical of everything!

I made extra glaze and concentrated it on the outsides of the cake so it would soak to the top. Next time I will take the cake out and pour some glaze in the pan and put the cake back in to glaze the top a bit more.

Next time I might add a bit more rum to the cake, not to the glaze... the parts saturated in glaze were fine, the parts that were just cake you couldn't taste the rum quite as much.

It was SOOOOOOOO moist! Everyone loved it. My sister almost ate half the cake!

My co-workers loved this! I made it for someone's birthday who requested a chocolate rum cake. I knew she liked coconut and since it was the only kind of rum I had handy, I used it in the cake and for the drizzle. Don't miss out on the topping, it totally makes the cake! I put chopped walnuts and coconut in the bottom of the baking flute before baking and also some on top after adding the drizzle - it was a smash hit and everyone is waiting for the next birthday to roll around to have some more!

This cake is very easy to make, and pretty good. It does need some flavor, and could use some ideas added to the recipe. I do recommend pouring half of the glaze into the pan first, and the other half later. The cake does taste good, and if you have already made a rum cake, and have special ingredients, try this quick and easy version!

Wow, this is really nice - and pretty. I used artificial rum flavoring, so I tweaked the liquid to work with it. I also added some instant coffee and vanilla to the batter and to the glaze - and I sprinkled another 1/2c of chopped walnuts on the "bottom" of the cake before I baked it. -- I made 2 of these today. One the second one, I reduced the amount of liquid in the glaze to make it thicker. I think they both work nicely - jest depends on preference... Thanks!

I have made this cake twice now and it gets raves from EVERYONE. Usually, it's gone within the hour. Oh... one change I make is that since I don't drink rum, I just toss in the entire pint into the batter to get rid of it. It doesn't hurt the recipe in the least, it only adds flavor-- which makes it even delicious in my opinion! You'll have a hit at any party with this.

With the addition of a chocolate ganache on the top, this rates five stars.  I also made this in a 9X13 inch pan because I have trouble getting cakes out of pans (baked 40 minutes).  Before baking I put the nuts and some coconut on top of the cake mix (instead of bottom).  After baking, I let it cool then used the chocolate ganache recipe from this website.  Oh yeah, I also added some chocolate chips to the cake before baking.  The men at work really seemed to enjoy this cake.

I love Chocolate and was curious about this recipe, since it had Rum in it.  I made it once and it wasnt very good. I made it again and upped the Rum and compensated with a little more flour.  I added another 1/2 cup german rum. Boy Howdy!!! it was Delicious!!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! Its best if you add just a bit more rum in the glaze and let it sit over night before enjoying it!

I don't "bake"; however, I'm a bachelor with a sweet tooth, so I do what I must.  I had already tried the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe for my birthday, so I was confident I could manage this one.  Very good it was!  As was suggested, I used Myers's Rum and a 50-50 split of brown and white sugar.  Also, after the first batch, I decided I needed to add chocolate chips.

The main challenge is to get the glaze to seep into the cake.  Poking holes in the top sort of works, but the walnut layer makes it awkward.  Will see what happens when glaze is poured on bottom instead.

Wonderful. Just wonderful.  My husband has a new favorite cake.  It's been out of the oven for only 2 hours and is almost all gone. 

I'm thinking of sprinkling powered sugar on it next time

I omitted the nuts and placed the cake in the fridge once cooled. The next day I covered it with the "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze" from this site and it was sooooo good!

So delicious and easy! I love the fact that this can be made with cake mix. It's so quick to make and tastes much better than any scratch rum cake I have ever made. I served it with fresh whipped cream and all of my guests oohed and ahhed over it...thanks for the great recipe! The only modification that I made was I used only 1/2 cup of sugar for the glaze, I don't like super sweet glazes and that was perfect. I let it soak for about 60 minutes before turning out of pan and that seemed to work well.

I wish I could give this 6 stars! It is an amazing cake and super easy. I follow the directions exactly and always can depend on a superb turnout. One thing I do is poke little holes in the top with a toothpick before pouring the glaze on. It seems like that lets the glaze soak in deeper. It's always better the next day too!

This recipe is awesome!  Even though it uses "boxed" ingredients, the flavors are both sophisticated and sublime!  Age the finished product for a day under plastic wrap and it becomes even better.  I would love to be able to suspend a cup more of walnuts within the matrix or perhaps use some walnut oil in place of the vegetable oil as the flavor combination is superb!

Yummy, yummy, yummy! A few modifications due to what I had on hand. Only had coconut rum so I used a coconut pudding in the mix and used pecans and chopped coconut on the bottom of the bundt pan.  It was delicious.  Made a great big cake and the rum was just right.  Definitely a keeper, and will make with other modifications.

I made this cake as an alternative to the Bacardi rum cake. Followed the directions and it came out great. I mailed this cake to my sister to comfort her after surgery. It was waylayed by the post office (priority mail wasn't a priority, I guess)and it took over a week to be received. However, it still got rave reviews by sister and family. The rum had mellowed and it was still moist.  The rum saved it from becoming a dry ruined cake. The glaze was not grainy at all as stated in a previous review. Delicious recipe, let it set a day before eating for the rum to mellow.

I made this into a traditional "poke" cake - I baked it in a 9x15 pan - and left in there for serving!  I also used 1/2 cup pecans and 1/2 cup walnuts to cover the bottom of the pan.  I also used macadamia nut oil, instead of regular oil.  For the glaze - make sure and use good quality, unsalted butter!!  Great taste - thanks!!!!!!!!      P.S. - we serve this cake as they would "over here" - by pouring a bit of "pouring cream" (heavy whipping cream, UN-whipped!) over the  top of each piece (make sure and warm the piece of cake slightly in the microwave first!)

My husband accused me of trying to kill him by having such irresistible decadence in the house when he finished his first piece and headed back for a second.  He was sure my plot was to have time die of sugar overdose from eating the whole cake.  But seriously, what a way to go!

This cake was very easy to make and was very good. The directions do not indicate to poke holes in your cake before you put the glaze on though. Make sure you do this, or it will accumulate in the middle.

This recipe is EXCELLENT and super easy to make!  If you want to use a 9x13 pan instead, bake it for about 40 minutes.

The cake was moist and delicious - we loved it!  The rum glaze was a little too much for some of our guests.

Instead of making rum balls for Christmas dessert, I made this cake.  It was a hit-very easy to make, very moist and chocolately with delicious rum flavor!  I made the cake about 4 or 5 hours prior to serving it, so the rum glaze had plenty of time to absorb while the cake cooled upside down the entire time, which may have allowed the glaze to be better distributed and absorbed throughout the cake without leaving a grainy effect that another had noticed.  Since I made my cake ahead of time, I simply warmed each cut slice in the microwave prior to serving, coupled by a scoop of brandy ice cream. Yum!  Am making tonight to take to a dinner party with friends!  I added a bit more rum to both the cake mix (reducing the water ingredient) and to the glaze mix for stronger rum flavor.

The batter is very dry but it soaks in the rum sauce really nice. I made this for Fat Tuesday and it was a hit! I have made it a couple other times since and have my neighbor addicted! It is so easy since you're not making the entire thing from scratch - takes no time at all and everyone loves it!

Just made both a vanilla rum cake and this chocolate one...the best suggestion for the glaze is to invert the cake onto a plate and pouring half the glaze into the bundt pan.  Put the cake back into the bundt and poke holes into the top.  Drizzle the remaining glaze into the holes, let it soak before inverting it back onto a serving plate.

Although I don't have any, I bet the chocolate cake will be great served with a vanilla custard or just plain old vanilla ice cream!

It was a success amongst everyone at the dinner party!  Thank you for everyone's feedback and suggestions improving this recipe.  I used an organic all natural chocolate cake mix and pudding mix to achieve a home made wholesome ingredient recipe.  I substituted dark spiced rum, Chairman's reserve spiced rum, for the white rum.  I used 3/8 a cup rum and 1/8 cup water for the glaze.  I made it the day before.  I made holes in the bottom of the cake before taking it out of the pan and poured half of the glaze in the cake.  I waited almost an hour.  I took the cake out of the pan then made holes in the top and poured the rest of the glaze in the cake.  I covered it with plastic wrap and left it on the counter overnight.  Just before serving, I sprinkled confectionery sugar on the top to dress it up.  Exceptional!

Very good as written but felt that dark rum gave more flavor....at least if you like a stronger rum taste.  Definintely allow to sit for a couple of days before using to develop the flavors.

I just made this for my uncle's 60th birthday and not only did it smell amazing but it tastes divine as well. I used golden rum only and omitted the pudding (subbing in 3 tbs of hot fudge topping) plus I used a mixture of almonds, peanuts and pecans...yum!

This is a Wonderful cake!  I baked this one, and a gluten free one using the Betty Crocker gluten free chocolate cake mix.  Despite the runny appearance of the GF cake batter, it baked up just as tasty and firm as the primary cake.   A good alternative for folks with wheat allergies!

Took this to an end-of-season soccer party and, now, 2 weeks later, parents are still asking me for the recipe.  (And, I didn't even have rum....I used Canadian whiskey.)

It's delicious.  Don't get apprehensive about pouring over the glaze.  My first reaction was "Where is all of this liquid going to go?"  Trust me....it finds a place.  I took it warm to the party (probably about an hour after completing) and it was perfect.

Next time, I'm using rum and pecans.

I loved this cake I had to alter it slightly because of what I had on hand. I didn't have any instant pudding but my cake mix had pudding in it. I also only had some dark rum which someone brought me from the Bahamas. Don't really care to drink it but it was great in the recipe. We had a couple pieces after I glazed it and my friend thought he had gone to heaven. Very moist and incredible rum flavor. It was also delicious the next day after a night in the fridge!  Yummy

This cake was delicious!! The only changes I had to make were that I reduced the baking time to 40 minutes, and I replaced the walnuts for pecans and added more chopped peacans to the glaze. I will definately make this again!

Love this recipe!  Everyone enjoyed the cake and the glaze... very very yummy!  I did not add the nuts (don't like nuts) and added a bit more rum in the cake mix to give it a bit more flavour.  I also cut the sugar in the glaze a little bit.  Has been added to as a new family fave.!  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

This cake is WONDERFUL!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I modified just a little...I didn't have chocolate pudding so I used French Vanilla.  I don't think it really matters.  I greased and floured my bundt pan but used cocoa powder instead of flour.  I used 1/2 cp brown sugar and 1/2 cp white and added chocolate chips to the batter after I poured it into the pan.  Everything was perfect.  I thought that the rum flavor in the sauce might be overpowering for the "non-alcoholic" eaters because it smelled so strong but the taste was superb.  People who didn't like rum said that they could hardly taste it and has a second helping.  Because I was afraid it would be strong, I cut the cake before saucing and set 1/2 aside.  Then I poured the sauce over the rest.  It looked great, tasted great and I made 2 in one week because my husband begged me for more.  So easy!  Definitely a keeper!

I made it as the recioed stated and I would only give it a 4.  But it has a lot of potential, so I am giving it a 5.  I like a stronger rum flavor in my cake so I am going to add more rum.  I used a white rum in the cake and a gold for the glaze.  It was really good.  Non cake people went back for seconds and thirds.

This was a really good recipe.  Not an overpowering rum taste, just a nice flavor, and a very moist cake.  I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts; and made sure I could get it out of the bundt pan prior to pouring the glaze over top.

I did a change to this awesome recipe! I used banana rum in place of regular rum and used almonds instead of pecans. This cake doesn't last long in my home!

This is a big hit with the family (adults). I use my own homemade triple chocolate cake recipe as the base. Less oil, more butter, white rum in batter, Appleton Rum in glaze. I keep extra glaze to warm and add as a drizzle when serving. I only put walnuts on half because some don't like them. Family devours as soon as it's cut.

This recipe has gotten a lot of compliments and never lasts long.  You can switch it up by changing the cake mix/pudding/rum flavor - Raspberry Rum makes a delicious chocolate raspberry rum cake!  I have also switched up with coconut rum and a pineapple cake mix and added some mandarin oranges for a tropical cake.  I think a dark rum with spice cake mix would be awesome as well.  So many possibilities with this recipe!!

I've been making this rum cake for years now and every time I make it it's a huge hit, and there's always at least one person who says it's the best cake they've ever had. I've also substituted all different types of alcohol in this cake depending on either what's on hand or just whatthat day- kahlua

I made this exactly as the recipe said. It was good but the next time I make it (and there will be a next time) I will either use a stronger tasting rum or I will replace more of the water with rum.

Made this for a friend about a week ago.  It was such a hit and we could not wait any longer - just made it for us.  It is sooooo yummy.  The only change I made was to cut back the sugar in the glaze to 1/2 cup of white sugar and then added 1/2 brown sugar to make up the difference.  It made it so rich.  It is very easy and super moist.  It makes a beautiful cake and I will be making this over and over since we are chocolate lovers.....

Very good!  I also recommend making this the day before to allow the sauce to permeate the cake.  I also prefer to use a spiced rum, rather than a white rum. It is a decadent but easy treat.

This cake was very easy to make and it was moist and delicious.  My company and my husband really enjoyed it.  I did read some reviews and I agree to poke hole in the cake before putting the glaze over it, and to make it the night before.

I am rating this now even though we have not eaten it yet as I made the cake for a friend's birthday. However in tasting the batter during preparation it was amazing and it cooked up beautifully. Can't wait to dig in! Thanks for a fun and tasty recipe.

WONDERFUL cake, and the easiest to make. The rum flavor is very light so don't be worried it will be overpowering, it isn't. My new oven baked these at 45 minutes tho so, yes, check earlier then the 50 mentioned in recipe. Hurry and try this. Thanks Suzanne for the delicious dessert!

Amazingly moist and delicious! I made this cake for my husband's birthday (it was his request) and there wasn't a crumb left! I took the advise of others and used Meyers dark rum. I also poked holes in it before glazing and made it the night prior to the party.

This is an awesome cake!  I used the SuperMoist chocolate cake mix that has the chocolate morsels in it - this is a very dense, moist cake.  And, not too heavy on the rum flavor.

I made this for our Christmas last year.  My husband and I wanted to start our own tradition.  So this will be a part of that every year!

I loved this cake.  I used sugar-free cake mix and sugar-free pudding and golden rum. This cake was moist and did not taste like a boxed mix. I used all brown sugar for the glaze, and pecans for the nuts. I will make this cake again! Delicious!

This recipe went to a work party with me and they were arguing who would get the last of it.  I also made some homemade wipe cream on the side. I will be making this again.

Very simple easy and delicious!  I don’t do nuts but it was great. I also tried it as bites using mini muffin pan. Loved it. Used a turkey baster to put the glaze on the bites.

I made this cake but I made a few tweeks. I added about 2 tbl spoons of instinct coffee,  2 til spoon hellmans mayo to the cake. My husband doesn't like walnuts so I use almonds and  them a bit. The glaze was good. I tweaked that also by adding some instint coffee and to boost the chocolate flavor by added some choco powder and also used 1/4c white sugar and a 1/4c dark brown sugar. There is only 2 pieces left and I only made it yesterday. Very good.

This was good, but not great.  I added chocolate chips at the bottom and throughout the batter.  I  poked holes in the cake before pouring over the glaze.  However,  you could tell a big difference in where the glaze was inserted and where it was not.  You would get a moist lovely flavor in one bite and a dry mouthful in another.  I recommend doubling the glaze and adding it over a period of time.

This is really yummy! I used a devil's food cake mix to make it even more chocolatey, and it turned out great. Next time I will double the walnuts (it seemed a little scant) and may do as some reviewers have suggested and poke holes in the cake before adding the rum sauce so that it can really soak into the center of the cake and not just the sides. Definitely a keeper.

Very moist and delicious!  I made this cake the day before I needed it.  I made them in individual mini cakes, so we ate a mini the day I made it and it was very tasty.  The next day was even better, the flavors were all blended beautifully.

Next time  I'll make it a day in advance so that the rum can soak in overnight.  It is a lot of glaze!
Be careful cooking the glaze as it is prone to boiling over.
Fantastic flavor and aroma.

I've baked this cake a couple of times and it's always been a hit. This time, however, I poured the glaze onto the cake while it was still warm and in the pan. I let it set and cool overnight. When I flipped the cake, half of the cake top stuck to the pan! I had to get creative with the presentation, but despite the aesthetics, there was none left!! Sooo moist and chocolatey (I added choc chips). Also, the recipe calls for 1/4 cup water and rum, but in the directions, it's corrected as 1/2 cup each...

Okay,  I've made this twice.  I haven't added the pudding because it's more expensive than the cake mix.  forget that!  It's delicious!. I posted a photo with an apple covering the hole I created waiting until dessert could be served.

Amazing, last minute decision when I realized I did not have the traditional lemon cake/pudding on hand.  Used the chocolate cake, and butterscotch pudding (what I had on hand!) Lined pan with salted peanuts, and added some cinnamon and ginger to cake mix .

My wife and I made this, Very Good! We did use the chocolate cake mix with the "pudding already in", and for the glaze we used half white sugar and half brown sugar.
Easy to make and tastes great for being a box mix based recipe.

This is a good recipe but not great. it's hard to make the icing penetrate cake evenly.
