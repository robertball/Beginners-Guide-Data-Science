I just wanted to say you don't have to fry these. I make them into patties and put directly into lightly greased 9x13 and bake about 10 min then add the soup cover and bake the 20 minutes.

This recipe was fantastic! I have a few suggestions though:
If you want to fry the patties and you don't want them to fall apart in the process, add shredded cheese and dip the unfried patty in bread crumbs before frying.  They turn out FANTASTIC!

EXCELLENT and tasty. I may never eat meat again! Versatile as well..I made a meat loaf and it was fine. I also vary the spice ingredients..green chillis, anise, chille power chopped tomatoes and sag, endless variety!! INCREDIBLE! I've already made 3 batches. I think the fried patties are the best...don't forget the bread crumbs before frying!

Great recipe, but even better with a few changes. We added parmesan cheese, minced onion, dijon mustard and worcestshire to the patty mix, and as other reviewers mentioned, we coated the patties in breadcrumbs before frying. This made an excellent vegetarian meal for a family of 4 kids!!

I followed the suggestion to bake these instead of frying and had no problem with them sticking.  I'm only giving this recipe 3 stars because I thought they were too salty.  Between the dry onion soup mix and the cream of mushroom soup, it was really too much salt for my tastbuds.

Made for my myself, two young boys and husband and they all liked. Didn't tell my little boys what was in them so they had to go on moms trust but they ate and said it was good. I personally thought they were very tasty and probably the best veggie patty I have eaten and can't beleive I made myself. I will be eating them in buns for lunch until they are gone. This recipe makes a lot. I would encourage everyone to try this recipe if your sick of buying meat all the time. I added breadcrumbs and used healthy cream of muchroom soup. Delicious!

This is simply amazing! The smell from cooking the patties woke my husband from his sleep. He immediately tasted a patty and said WOW. I did not cook them in the oven or use the soup. I just fried them up until both sides were brown on a non-stick pan using very little or no oil. The patties have just the right amount of protein and carbs. Each patty I made comes to about 125 cal. so I'm very happy about them being healthy too. My patties did not fall apart at all which is a problem I have been having with other patty recipes.

This is a great recipe.  I was particularly happy to find it because it is both vegetarian and gluten-free (if you omit the wheat germ)which is a hard combination to come by sometimes.  I baked it instead of frying, but would give it a little more baking time next time (probably 15 minutes in the oven, then top with the mushroom soup and bake 20 more minutes).  Also, a tip for vegetarians: Make sure to check the label on the dry soup package.  Some brands have animal fat in the mix.  I will definitely make this again!

I couldn't wait to try this recipe and I am soo glad I did.  I am a vegetarian and always on the lookout for new recipes.  This is my all time favorite, hands down.  I opted for a loaf instead of patties and it was DELICIOUS.  I have leftovers for lunches all week.  Thank you for a GREAT recipe!

I've had the other version that calls for nuts instead of oats and I like this one a lot better.  No grainy texture here.  I skipped the mushroom soup all together, though.  I only used a cup of cottage cheese because that's what I had and the texture was perfect.  Also added about a 1/4 c. of mozzarella to the mix.  I patted them in breadcrumbs before frying.  Ate one on a bun tonight with ketchup and mayo.  So good!  Will be eating the leftovers with mashed potatoes and gravy later this week.  Thank you!

This is my first rating and I have to gve it 5 stars. I hate to make anyone think my way is better, but i too made some changes. I doubled this recipe, to take to church, I am a SDA and the congregation is vegetarian, so I was looking for a great recipe I could share. I added 1 pkg of cream cup cheese, smashed walnuts, half of the onion soup mix, and instead of dredging in bread crumbs, I used crushed town house crackers. I mixed 1/4 cup sour cream with the cream of mushroom soup and kept it separate, so it could be spooned over the patties at the last minute. It was very very good. My husband who is a meat lover, and not a fan of cottage cheese loved these. I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Michaele L.

My boyfriend loved this. I liked it okay, too. I don't like mushrom soup and probably could have bought  better brand which might have helped. It is a neat recipe, yummy and somewhat like meatloaf. We tried to pan fry the patties but it simply didn't work - we may have had the ratio of cottage cheese to oats wrong. 

Overall this was easy and satisfying. I added salt at the table. 

Thanks!!

I was a little skeptical about this recipe, but the reviews were so good I tried it.  This is delicious.  I used regular rolled oats as opposed to quick cooking.  Because some people felt the recipe was a little salty I used low sodium mushroom soup.

This is a staple in my house.  I don't fry them at all. I baked them for 12 minutes on each side on a well greased cookie sheet.  While that's baking I make a mushroom onion gravy to put over.  Delicious!  I make this once a week, since I always have the ingredients handy.

OMG, this is excellent!!!. I made it as is, except I used jumbo eggs and it made the mix too runny to really form patties, I just had to spoon it into the oil. GREAT results though, my husband loved it. Next I will try the no-frying technique shared by other reviewers, but I always like to try the recipe as is the first time around. A HIT, thanks for sharing!

I found the recipe for these originally in a wartime cookbook.  They have been a staple in our vegetarian household for 20 years.  I also add the vegetable pulp from my juicer which gives them some added fiber and nutrition and doesnt change the taste much.

Delicious & versatile!  I made them a 2nd time with taco seasoning mix, bbq sauce, & adobe red peppers (in place of onion soup mix and mushroom soup), and they tasted just like spicy buffalo wings!  Great for new vegetarians like me.

Really tasty!  I added a little shredded cheddar to the mix and covered the patties in Panko bread crumbs before pan frying them in olive oil (pan-fried only, didn't bother with the oven).  I left out the cream of mushroom soup and everyone agreed these tasted very much like crab cakes.

Fabulous...We made these using gluten free steel cut oats, 1onion,  and all natural cream of mushroom soup... Also added Trader Joe's 21 salute spice approximately 1/2 tsp. tasted like Salisbury steak. Absolutely fabulous. this is our new meatless "go to" recipe and will alternate spices and sauces for "meatloaf" and "country fried steak."  This is the best.

Awesome!  These were so tasty, and I love that it's healthy, inexpensive and very easy.  
I did have difficulty with the consistency when trying to fry - they kept breaking apart.  I ended up giving up halfway through and just opted to bake without frying the whole batch.  Worked just fine.  I baked alone for 6 or 8 minutes, then added the soup topping and baked another 20 or so.  I did find the recipe quite salty, and may cut down on the dry onion soup mix, or use reduced-sodium cream of mushroom soup next time.
I was out of thyme, and opted for caraway instead (yum).  Added some worcestershire as others suggested.

Thanks!

I really love this recipe!  After the first time making this, I simply gave up on the patties and frying.  I just spread the mixture in a baking dish and covered with the cream of mushroom soup.  Then just cut and serve.  Much less messy!  Thank you for the recipe!

I really liked this recipe. I was a little short (about 1/2 cup) on oatmeal, so I substituted an equal amount wheat germ in addition to the 3 tablespoons and it was very good. I did not fry- I baked them in a  9x13 sprayed w/ non-stick spray for 15 minutes first, then baked them for 25 with the cream of mushroom. I forgot to cover it but it was still fine. I also used non-fat cottage cheese and 25% less sodium cream of mushroom and would have used lower sodium soup mix if I could have found it. It was not too salty, but I could see how it could be. I sliced tomato on top of the patties after drizzling extra soup on top and used some pepper- that's it. Very good. My bf who is not a fan of cottage cheese or mushroom loved it. Try this one.

Wow! These are ridiculously good!The mixture was a little runny, so I added some Italian style bread crumbs and some of the plain ones, so after that they held together nicely. I browned them on both sides on the very slightly greased pan and then baked for 10 minutes. They came out great! So full of flavor and the texture is great too! They remind me od real beef Russian cutlets, but since I am vegetarian now I am going to make these over and over again! And so healthy, too! Thank you for the recipe!

Pleasantly surprised! I LOVED these patties! My boyfriend liked them a lot too! They reminded me of a really delicious stuffing I made once. I didn't want to stop eating them! Next time I'll make a little more of the mushroom soup! Soo good!

I was really looking forward to something special after reading all the reviews here, but my vegetarian kids and I were disappointed. They tasted like onion soup mix to me.

Really Good! Easy and fun to make. You can tweak the seasonings to suit your taste and add variety. Great as a burger with all the fixings or as a roast with gravy. Very versitile!Thanks for sharing!

I'm hooked! I followed the recipe but added extras based on other reviews. I left out the wheat germ (didn't have any) I added a little bit of worcestershire sauce, a little bit of dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp of sage, and a few tbsp of parmesan cheese. I also used 3/4 cups regular rolled oats & 3/4 cup quick oats instead of all quick oats to give more texture. What a great recipe!

One of our new favourites. I tampered with the recipe a little bit, got rid of the wheat germ and added a few other spices. 

I also started making a very cheesy vegetable medley to bake on top of it instead of the mushroom soup.

This tasted and felt surprisingly like a hamburger. I used the breading before frying which I believe helped with texture. The basic recipe is mild enough that you could easily add other seasonings to customize or put it on a bun and dress it like a burger. I felt full and healthy after munching on these!

This recipe is amazing, it's not dry at all but please make sure and really cover the patties in mushroom soup, if they are dry they are not as good.  Also I splashed Frank's Red Hot on them and they were Amazing...

I add parmesan cheese to the mix and dip in seasoned breadcrumbs before frying and serve them with homemade tartar sauce.  We like them crispy so we don't bake in soup. One of my husband's favorite dinners!

Wow, these were fantastic! The burgers are a little wet when making them, but they stay together just fine. I made 6 good size patties. I happened to have the wheat germ so I used that. I used fat free cottage cheese. The only change I made was using cream of chicken ( It makes it non vegetarian, I know) but my husband doesn't like anything with mushrooms.

I used a seperate dry ingredient recipe for the onion soup mix, cause I didn't have any and that was a bad idea. This recipe, however, iS delicious. I didn't fry first, but if you do- USE BREAD CRUMB.

I halved the recipe and  skipped the cream of mushroom and ate it with ketchup and a side of spicy fries. i realized that i don't like the taste of thyme, but im not going to nitpick. i added a handful of shreaded cheese and i used beefy onion soup instead of original onion soup, because i was cooking for myself, and im not a vegetarian. i have lots of leftover, but i don't know if i'll use it because of the thyme, i'd rather start from scratch and omit it. My roommate is too picky to even try it, but i liked it very well.

My step-son who's a vegetarian was visiting, so we decided to make the cottage cheese patties together. I had my doubts, but they were actually VERY good!! I'd coat them in seasoned bread crumbs to hold their shape. The entire family enjoyed them and they were a welcome break from red meat. Thank you!

I really liked this recipe, the patties are delish!  I did dredge them in bread crumbs before I fried them, and it just requires a little care to keep them from falling apart and sticking.  Well worth any extra effort because they are very good.

I made this last night for my two year old and myself. Like another reviewer posted, this is way too salty for me and I even used reduced sodium mushroom soup. The flavor was good, not great, but good. But between the patties sticking, even when I generously oiled the pan, and how long they actually took until they were on the table, I won't make these again.

I really liked this recipe. I baked the patties rather than fried them. I also substituted a diced onion and 8 ounces of diced mushrooms. I sauteed the mushrooms and onions before adding them to the rest of the ingredients. This came out great. The preparation was very simple. I did not add the dried onion soup mix to this recipe.

I made these following the recipe but without the wheat germ (didn't have any and it said optional) and they seemed really runny to me.  They didn't hold their shape very well but they taste delicious.  Does the kind of cottage cheese matter?  I used 4% small curd.  Maybe I should have used large curd?  Either way, they taste good.

These surprised me. I did not know what to expect but was curious enough to try it out. They kind of taste like thanksgiving stuffing. I used regular oats instead of quick oats and they were fine. I dipped in panko breadcrumbs but otherwise followed the recipe. I might use a different soup next time since cream of mushroom isn't my fav but I probably will make it again.

Mixed reviews on this one in my Family.  i personally am not inclined to make it again but MR said he liked it. 2yr old would not touch it I just thought it was OK.  I found it to be a but too salty and I wasnt a fan if the soup on top where as MR said the soup made the recipe.  Will keep recipe around and maybe try again but I'm not in a hurry to do so.

These are really tasty and I will definitely be making them again and again. I baked them for 20 mins, then turned them over and added the sauce and baked them for 20 more in stead of frying. My mother and boyfriend (both meat eaters) loved them. I might add parmesan cheese on top next time, but they were delicious without it.

I really liked the taste of these...would say that they are about 4.5 starts.  It was a little too salty...maybe next time I would only add 1/2 the onion packet or 1/2 the soup.  They also fell apart while frying.....I think I would just try baking next time.

this was really good, if you let the mixture set for a bit,(10-15) the oatmeal will thicken and there is no need for the bread crumbs, but the crumbs add a nice touch too!! This is a great meat textured base andyou can do lotsa things with it!! Peppered gravy would be great over this also! Yum! Thanks so much for sharing!

My husband (a flexitarian) and myself (a vegetarian) loved these!  They have a very savory flavor, and hold up well in the frying pan.  We have been enjoying them for the last few days, paired with various side dishes.  These would even be good, sans mushroom soup, as a veggie alternative to a meat hamburger patty.

These are great burger/patties, however as this recipe is written IT IS NOT VEGETARIAN.  Most onion soup mixes have animal products.  Hunt down a vegetarian alternative.  

Also, I bake them (without the soup) then fry them to crisp them.  Then I either use them as hamburger patty replacements or will pour a gravy over the top.

Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I've had it in my recipe box to try for quite a while and can't believe I waited so long! I did make a few changes though...*only 2 eggs* onion mushroom soup mix (I don't like just straight onion)*no wheat germ or thyme-didn't have them on hand* added some Worcestershire sauce minced garlic and pepper rolled in Italian bread crumbs and fried in olive oil then baked for 20 minutes*mixed cream of mushroom with heavy cream instead of milk, just for fun. (I think next time I will use 1/2 the can of soup because the sodium is just too much for me.) When my husband ate this he said, "what is this, country fried steak?" I think that kind of reaction from a meat-free dish speaks for itself. Next time I will try this in a loaf. The only downside was portions-I didn't get 8 servings. Hubby and I both had two and there are two left over...so I would call that 3 servings because I don't think just one of these is enough! I served them with steamed mixed veggies and a sweet potato.

Very good recipe. I mixed and matched a lot of reviews on here and wound up omitting the thyme, onion soup mix, wheat germ, and cream of mushroom soup. I added 1tsp worchestershire sauce, 1/2 an onion, 2 garlic cloves, breadcrumbs, and a bit of salt and pepper - fried the patties in vegetable oil. They were a pain to hold together, but I managed to get the majority to make it to the end.   I served them with a side of sour cream. I think this is a great base recipe and could be tweaked in so many different ways. Thanks Zopooh!

Awe.  These bring back memories.  I grew up on them, although I don't think onion soup mix was included, just some simple herbs and salt.  Easy recipe to throw together anytime.  I like them both ways, plain and baked w/mushroom soup on top.

Hmm, OK, these were interesting. The main problems are that it's too wet to form a patty and the onion soup and mushroom soup were too salty and artifical tasting.  I will try this again as a loaf, but with more oats, lots of dried herbs and garlic, maybe some seasoned breadcrumbs mixed in and leave out the onion soup mix and mushroom soup.

I've been a vegetarian for 17 years and this is EXCELLENT!  I would maybe not put all the onion soup mix in next time (a little too salty), but other than that, it was YUMMY!

The texture was great, but the taste was strange (maybe the onion soup mix?). I baked them instead of frying and they held together beautifully. I served them with Butternut Squash Mac & Cheese and a baby carrot vegetable mix; the plate looked lovely (pics to follow). I think I could have solved the taste issue had I read all the reviews before making these. I definitely would have halved the onion soup mixture or omitted it altogether. For me, this is a great pantry recipe and I will try these again soon. As I feel the bones of the recipe are good, just need a little tweaking for personal taste. Thank you Zopooh for sharing!

I expected so much after reading all the fab reviews, but I gotta tell you, this was just not good. Reminded me of those ole salisbury steak TV dinners I had way back before I was vegitarian. Same mushy texture and same prossessed taste. You must replace the onion soup mix and the mushroom soup with somthing more "real" in order to have a satisfying meal.

These were awesome, they sound so weird, but I was curious. Even my teenage son liked em'. Since I don't eat meat I didn't have anything to compare them with, but my son said they reminded him of chicken fried steak. Will keep on making em'. I will use one more can of crm. of mush. soup next time.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but it just didn't work for out house. I found the patties a bit too bland on their own. The cream of mushroom soup sauce wasn't the best idea for us, either. Neither of us really go for that. I think it might go over better in my home if I made up a mushroom gravy, and spiced the patties differently. The hubby, a meat eater, says he preferred seitan.

This was just delicious, but too salty for my high blood pressure.  I would just LOVE someone to  concoct a low salt version as the flavors were just yummy....I guess I will challenge myself to that effort!

Don't get me wrong--it's a good recipe! I just don't think it's quite awesome as written. I did make modifications (ground flax instead of wheat germ, did not fry--just baked 15 minutes, no soup). I am not a big fan of just cream of chicken soup--it would've needed something else and I couldn't decide what (sour cream? milk?). The onion was a little overpowering...I may use a little less next time unless I do eat it with a saucy topping to help tone it down. Overall, a nice, healthy way to eat up some cottage cheese!

I made these tonight for dinner and OMG they were soo soo good.  I followed the directions exactly except I had no thyme so I used parsley and also before I friend them I dredged them in flour.  The first one I made flat before I dredged and it wanted to fall apart in the frying pan so the others I made balls out of then I rolled them in flour and laid them in the frying pan and used a floured spatula to flatten and they were perfect.  Oh.. and I added a little worcestershire in my mushroom soup.  These were so so amazingly good.  My kids loved them and both of the boys had 2 each of the patties.  This one is a total keeper!!!

I made these today as an alternative for the vegetian guests I had over for Easter.  I had two requests for the recipe!  I didn't leave anything out and after reading the other helpful reviews, I added a handful of shredded cheese and rolled patties in bread crumbs.  VERY good recipe!!!!!

Just a friendly note to an early suggestion of adding worcestershire sauce: it usually isn't vegetarian!  It most often contains anchovies.  There are vegetarian options for worcestershire, which you can find at your local organic food shop.

I made these with cottage cheese, eggs, oats, panko bread crumbs, and just a little onion soup mix, formed in small patties and coated them with more panko bread crumbs, baked them for about 20 minutes, then under the broiler till each side turned brown and they were awesome and lowfat!! I can't believe how good they taste!

I LOVED THESE!  I had read where others had trouble getting the patties to stick together.  My suggestion would be to add more oats until the mixture is thicker.  Then, when frying, it is important to wait until a good crust has formed on the bottom of the patty before turning it.  The first patty I turned, I did too early, and I had trouble with it falling apart on me.  I then waited to turn the others and had no problem.  These patties were flavorful and my 18-month-old ate his portion with no complaints!

Tried this recipe tonight and it was absolutely delicious.  I followed the patty mixture closely minus the wheat germ and used fat free cottage cheese (the recipe didn't specify). I didn't have the sticking problem.  They don't stick if you fry them long enough. I used olive oil instead of veggie oil. Since I detest mushrooms, I used fat free cream of broccoli. They turned out perfect.  My only suggestion is to use more seasoning.  I think I'll try a dash of steak seasoning or crushed red peppers to spice them up a bit next time.  Also, may add some smashed pinto beans just to give them a firmer texture and make them more nutritious.

Seemed like a great idea, but there was too much packaged and canned soup flavour for my taste. The onion soup flavour, particularly, was overwhelming. Sorry!

More oats and a good hot pan may solve the fall apart issues. I have been looking for a good cottage cheese pattie recipe. These do taste great, even if they stick.

These were okay.  The combination of flavors wasn't bad, but didn't come together either.  I didn't taste any thyme at all.  What I did like about this is that it seems to be a great base for making a meat substitute - it'd be hard to tell it wasn't meat if you didn't know.

The taste of this was good, but I did have a few problems with it.  As other reviewers noted, my patties fell apart when cooking them in the frying pan and stuck horribly to it.  In the future I would do as the first reviewer suggested and put them in the pan and bake them before adding the soup sauce.  Even in crumbles and no clear shape, it still tasted good though!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I was looking for a way to use up left over cottage cheese from a cesar salad dip I make with it. I will enter that salad dressing at a later date.
I would suggest adding basil, or green onions or chives to sprinkle on these when they are served.

Super yummy! Great texture. I added the Worcestershire sauce and breadcrumbs  as suggested in some of the other reviews. Other than that I followed the original recipe. Delicious! My meat-eating fellas really enjoyed them too, and were surprised at how much they were like little Salisbury steaks!

Turned out great very tasty and easy to make.  Use caution when frying they fall apart easily but I kept them all together. I swapped the cream of mushroom for a creamy tomato bisque because we don’t care for mushrooms and it was a good move. I may try other changes next time just for fun but will definitely make it again. Happy cooking y’all.

I was really surprised by how good these were. I even had them for lunch the next day. The only thing I would change is maybe the mushroom soup to mushroom gravy. I really like Heinz. I think it would be good to mix the gravy with a little sour cream, to give it a stroganoff taste. With some veggies on the side, this is a delicious, comfort food kinda dish. I'll make it again for sure.

when I saw this recipe, I laughed this has got to be soooo Gross. 
It was jokingly I made this. IT was AWESOME. 
I omitted the wheat germ. and made a coconut milk and mushroom base sauce, because I didn't have GF mushroom soup.

I made it as written and it was just slightly salty and too much thyme for my family's tastes. Next time I'll just add an extra egg and a little more oats. I think that'll fix it. And I'll cut the thyme in half. But these were definitely worth making and my family enjoyed them a lot. Thank you!

Very tasty!  However, they stuck miserably to the pan while frying. I salvaged what I could and finished baking them.

Love this recipe. The name sounds weird, but you won't regret trying it. I don't like mushrooms, so I opted for using cream of celery soup instead. Delicious!

Super impressed with these!!! Even hubby liked them somewhat. I am starting a semi vegetarian lifestyle.  Meaning I still want to eat chicken and fish, but mostly just vegetarian.  I can't do vegan because I need my eggs and cheese. I really liked these! Husband is not as gungho on the diet changes, but he did eat one patty. Lol!  Will be adding these to the rotation for certain! Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Who knew.  This is really, really good.  We are not vegetarians, but typically don't eat a lot of meat.  This sounded interesting so I gave it a try.  I baked it as a loaf and did not add the soup/gravy.  Will make again.

I make this, as a loaf instead of burgers about twice a month. Instead of the cream topping, I use the typical meatloaf topping (basically ketchup and brown sugar). Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes. Yum!!

I truly loved this recipe. Didn't think I would.  My daughter thought it needed more spices.  But I liked it just as made.  I ate all the patties on different days of course and enjoyed them  Great Recipe

Just made the cottage cheese patties I didn't have any wheat germ so replaced it with ground linseed. They were wonderful, ate them with cauliflower rice.  Will make them often.  Thank you for a great recipe. Please let me know if you can freeze them..

I was surprised how good these tasted.  Not fantastic, but good for what they are.  You would never know there's cottage cheese or oatmeal in these.  The thyme seemed to over power the taste just a bit.  Might cut the thyme in half next time.  No need for salt.  The onion soup mix added a lot of salt. Although cream of mushroom soup is good, I might try cream of chicken next time.  My son loved them as leftovers.

This is a delicious recipe. I added some shredded cheese and rolled them in a bread crumbs before browning. I also changed from thyme to garlic powder, parsley, and black pepper. I did mess up my first few patties, be sure to squeeze them tight before browning. Then I baked them for 10 minutes without the soup, poured on the soup, and baked another 15. Turned out lovely! My omnivore partner absolutely devoured them up. I think next time I will double the recipe, add a sauteed onion, and turn it into a meatloaf. I've recommended this to several people already and I only made it last night.

I have made this many times and its always very good. They taste like "salsbury steak" so instead of the cream of mushroom soup, I use brown gravy and add a little red cooking wine, marjoram , garlic and ketchup to the gravy and pour over these after I cook them and bake them for about 10 minutes :) My husband still swears I make these with meat LOL

Good consistency but tastes like stuffing. They're good but I would prefer a different flavor. Also, I agree with another reviewer that they're too salty with the soup and onion soup mix

This recipe was very interesting.  Certainly a different taste than I have had before.  I liked it.

Due to my mistake, I used Quaker Oats instead of rolled oats.  This gives this recipe a granola-type flavor that is good.  I did not get the overwhelming salt that others have mentioned.  

Note:  I did not fry these.  I simply baked them to save dishes.  The volume filled a 8x8 pan - no patties for me.

Tastes great. Served on top of mashed potatoes. I did not fry. Once ingredients were mixed, I slightly covered each patty with Italian-style bread crumbs and then placed on greased baking dish. Baked for 20 min, flipped, added mushroom sauce, then baked again for 15 min. I used all of the ingredients except wheat germ (don't know what that is).

My family has made cottage cheese patties for 30+ years, but a little different variation; we use bread crumbs instead of oats (whole wheat crumbs if you can find them!), add finely diced green bell pepper and onion, add chopped walnuts (the crunch is great!), omit the dry onion mix, and dredge the patties in a beaten egg with a few tablespoons of milk mixture and then crushed cornflakes prior to frying them (baking works too, if you flip them over so both sides get crispy!)  Be sure to mix the mushroom soup with a can of milk, or the sauce is waaaaaaaay too salty and thick!

Absolutely Awesome! This has became an once every week staple in my house. Very inexpensive and hearty like you're eating beef. I baked mine like meatloaf and it's honestly very hard to tell the difference from the real thing. Thanks for the great recipe.

My boyfriend was skeptical when I told him what I was making for dinner but loved them. He ended up eating 5! I just left out the thyme because I don't like it. Put the mix in the fridge before I formed the patties. Cheap, simple and delicious! Thank you.

Incredible! The texture is perfect and the flavor is wonderful. Did not have Thyme in my cabinet, so we excluded that ingredient and added fresh garlic. I can only imagine that they will be even more delicious with the Thyme AND we will be making these again soon with all the ingredients. Coating the patties with breadcrumbs is definitely suggested; it made them much easier to handle. Being a vegetarian and recently learning of the hexane use by most companies in production of their "burgers" made seeking out a healthier option necessary. Thank you for sharing this healthier and delicious recipe!

Easy, quick and tasty. I skipped the frying and went straight to the oven. Served it with brown rice, and will definately be experimenting more with this recipe in the future. Maybe the "loaf" that another reviewer mentioned.

We loved this!  I can't wait to try different variations.  I am most anxious to try an Italian version in marinara sauce.  My kids could not tell it was not meat.  I bet an Asian version would also be great.  I have a feeling I will be making these often.

These were really good. Although I found them a little too salty...next time I will be making them with a 1/2 package of the dry onion soup mix.

I think potential here.  Instead fo the onion soup mix, I did 1/2 an onion, 1 clove garlic, S&P, but it was still a bit bland.  Will need to continue to tweak to my tastes.

Perfect recipe! I did not fry it though. Was making it for a vegetarian family member. I was sceptical of any recipe that contained that much cottage cheese, but it was wonderful.

This is a good basic recipe.  Once you get a hang of the dry to wet ingredients ratio you can really play it to your likings.  I like to use different herbs and spices to come up with different flavors.  BBQ is always a big hit in our family.  I just pan fry the patties and they always turn out great.  Thanks for sharing.

We had half of them with the mushroom soup for dinner & then with eggs for breakfast & the rest that were frozen (w/o the mushroom soup) I just took one out for a "chiken" parm sandwhich & another when I was craving meatloaf & made mashed potatoes & gravy with it! Very veratile & yummy!

Tastes great!  Tried another person's suggestion of adding a little shredded cheese and rolling in bread crumbs before frying.  Awesome.  Whole family liked this dish.  Taste reminded me of a chicken fried steak.

This was to wet to make patties so I added cruched crackers. Husband really liked it was ok to me. Too much Thyme for me as well.  I will make this again but will have to change quite a few things,  this is a decent base recipee  for a meatless patty.

I REALLY enjoyed these! As did my husband. I was leary b/c I'm not a fan of cottage cheese, but you couldnt even tell! I only used 1/2 of the onion soup mix, and I'm glad I did, b/c the flavor was plenty strong enough. I followed another reviewer and baked for 10 minutes, added the mushroom soup and baked for another 20. It probably could have stayed in a little longer, but it was still good. They were very crumbly before being cooked. But this wasnt a big deal as I just sprinkled the breadcrumbs on both sides and plopped it into the pan. We will definitely make these again!!!

This patty is good.  I agree with some other reviewers that next time I'd use only half the envelope of dry onion soup.  Also, I followed someone's advice and didn't fry them -  I formed the patty, dredged it in bread crumbs, then baked on a greased cookie sheet for about 20 minutes.  I warmed the soup on the stove and spooned it over the patty on each plate.  Also, I'd like to try a different sauce instead of the cream of mushroom soup -- between the dry onion soup mix, and the cream of onion soup, it had too much of a 'canned soup' feel.  But overall, the patty itself is good and can be adjusted to suit different tastes.

I'm being kind by giving this recipe 4 stars because I think my proportions were off somehow.  I fried with the lite coating of breadcrumbs on top as suggested.  Instead of then baking the patties with mushroom soup on top I baked them without the mushroom soup and added a homemade mushroom sauce when they came out of the oven.  They were a bit dry and like I said, I think my proportions were off (too much oats?).  Because I like the idea i'm going to try to make this again paying better attention to what i'm doing, and I will bake with the mushroom soup (or the sauce) on top.   This meal DEFINITELY needed a green counterpoint ... definitely will be serving with a nice salad next time.

I made these last night for dinner and my meat loving husband gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I only used 1/2 of the onion soup packet based on other reviews. I used egg beaters and nonfat cottage cheese. I did add in about a half a cup more of organic rolled oats than the recipe called for because the mixture was too thin to make into patties. Even after adding the extra rolled oats, the patties wanted to break easily, so I made them kind of small (they fit in the palm of my hand), laid them in bread crumbs and coated them generously, then put them in a preheated electric skillet with some extra light olive oil and fried them at 350 for 5 minutes per side. Don't flip them too early, or they will break.  I then placed the fried patties in a 13x9 dish as the recipe states. I did use one can of cream of mushroom, milk instead of water, and I added 1/4 cup of sour cream per another reviewer. My husband and I decided it needed a little more flavor, and we added natural salt. It was perfect. We both like these a lot and I will definitely be making them again. They are very filling and tasty.

This was really good just way too salty.  Next time I'll use half a packet of dry onion soup.  Otherwise great as a main dish because it's very filling.

This recipe was an unlikely hit at my house.  The combination of ingredients sounds "iffy" at best, but my two teenage daughters liked this so much that they asked to have it for two consecutive days the first time I prepared it.  This has definitely become a favorite at my house.

My husband and I just finished eating these for dinner with some wild rice and green beans.  They were delicious!  I did not have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of celery with the splash of Worchester sauce.  I did fry them in EVOO with a breaded coating which gave a nice texture.  I am anxious to try these in a bun sometime.  Thank you for sharing.  This will be a staple at our house.

I made these exactly as directed except I added some panko bread crumbs to top and bottom of patties. This seemed to help hold them together a little better.  They were WONDERFUL.  If you are not a fan of thyme, you might want to reduce to 3/4 or 1/2 tsp.  I am going to try these as meatballs for meatball subs or spaghetti using italian seasoning instead.  Thanks so much for this recipe - love it!

My family are meat eaters, and they all liked these, even the kids. For us though, the rosemary was too strong, and the french onion.  Will try with 1/2 of the soup mix, and maybe italien seasoning, with marinara. Or, perhaps mexican seasonings, with salsa.

wow, are these good!  I followed the advice to dip in bread crumbs before frying and it did help them hold together.  They are a little difficult to turn when frying but they are so good that you won't mind.

I really had trouble keeping the patties together. I did what another reveiwer said and added extra oats worked great. Left out the onion soup and used worchestershire sauce added fresh onion, cheddar and another reviewers idea parmesan cheese. Turned out great.

this was a really good and easy recipe. i honestly would never have thought of trying this and it is weird but it tastes pretty good. i took the suggestion to bake it fro 10 minutes instead of frying it which worked great, i have no idea how you would have fried it, lol. i didn't have any wheat germ but i threw in some bread crumbs to try and get it to stick together a little more. i also added a few italian herbs. i also took the suggestion of using the 25% less sodium cream of mushroom soup and i'm really glad i did. i decided to try it as a sandwich so i threw on a slice of provolone and tomato and put it on a toasted english muffin. it was really tasty! i'm eating the leftovers now for lunch sans tomato and english muffin and it's still good. i'll definitely make this one again.

this was pretty good.  not amazingly great but good.  my kids all ate them without complaint.  i baked them as another member suggested and they hald their shape well.  i questioned not diluting the soup and next time will definately add about 1/2 can of milk to it to make it more like gravy and less like thick goop on top!  next time i think i will add green onions on top after baking.
