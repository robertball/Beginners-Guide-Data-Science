I gave it 4 stars because it was very salty. I only put 1/2 the Parmesan cheese in it and it was still to salty. I did salt and pepper my chicken and grilled in the skillet instead of boiling. It had a good flavor but I will add something to make it less salty, maybe milk.

Yes. I made the recipe then put it in a pie crust to make a pot pie. Wonderful. Being on Keto it fits the bill. Just use keto crust. You can also put it in cupcake pan and make mini pies.

I did alter a little.  Used a condensed cream of cheddar soup instead of shredded cheddar and used cream cheese instead of sour cream.  Poured in short fat rigatoni before adding to the casserole dish.  However followed the rest of the recipe and it is heavenly.  Thank you for the recipe!

I browned the chicken in oil and added onions. I used Knorr chicken bullion for broth and added it to rue with 3 slices American cheese. Added the broccoli and topped with Mozzarella. It was delicious!

My husband and I loved this. I did use roasted chicken rather than a boiled chicken. I also think this would be great for using left over chicken and broccoli!

This had great flavor, but was even better the next day. Will be making this again. Should have let it cool a bit longer but was to hungry & anxious to try it.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I added a bit more chicken than called for, and it was still a good balance. Just as tasty for leftovers. I would definitely make again!
