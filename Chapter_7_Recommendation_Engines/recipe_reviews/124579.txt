I have made these muffins for years.  To get the best flavor and nutrition, I used old fashioned oats.  I use OJ from frozen concentrate and add an extra Tbsp or two to make the Orange flavor more pronounced.  Then I mix the  oat and OJ together and refrigerate it overnight.  I frequently use all or part EVOO in place of the vegetable oil.  I prefer to use fresh berries over frozen ones because I don't as much green discoloration from the fresh ones.  I use slightly more berries than the recipe says and withhold enough berries to put 3 or 4 on top of each muffin before adding the sugar/nut/cinnamon topping.

Fantastic! I made these this evening and I just had one... amazing!  I did use the zest of an entire orange, so probably 2 tbsps of zest and I substituted Applesauce for the oil (to make them a bit healthier).  I will definitely make these again!

Finally a fabulous muffin that has a moist texture.  No dryness here.  Orange juice and oatmeal are a great touch.

Very yummy muffin.  I was looking for something a little different then a traditional blueberry muffin and this was great!  The only thing I changed was 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I just wanted to cut down on the fat and they were excellent.  Next time I will try with no oil!  Thanks for the yummy muffin.

A good muffin, but not a hint of orange flavor at all. I used OJ and I used orange marmalade (twice as much as the zest called for)

Great recipe.. I've made it twice so far and made a double batch both times.  They freeze and rewarm really well, I love the little kick that the OJ and orange zest give them.  Thanks for sharing this!

A good muffin. I halved the recipe, but still used 2 eggs. Subbed mostly whole wheat pastry flour & a bit of bread flour. Good & pretty healthy.

The orange flavor is very subtle. Almost an aftertaste. Maybe because I subbed 2 cups of the AP flour with whole wheat? The topping is a must. I almost left it off b/c I do not like blueberry and cinnamon together.

Very good, I used lemon zest instead of orange as that is all I had, other than that followed recipe as written.  I would fill muffin pan to full next time as I like big muffins.

I made these muffins just now, and didn't have quite enough blueberries..only about 1cup..still tried them anyways..and they are wonderful! Def be a bit better with the whole amount of blueberries, as well I used Oragne extract(1 tablespoon) in place of the orange peel(didnt have any) and used 2cups all-pupose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour! These are absolutely wonderful!! Enjoying one with my 2.5yr old right now!! :) thanks for sharing!! Cant wait for my hubby to try them, he will love em, I know it!! :)

I didn't find there to be very much flavor in these muffins except for when you hit a blueberry. I would definitely increase the blueberries and add some vanilla or something for more flavor. The texture was nice, though.

These muffins are very moist and flavorful.  I made them in a mini muffin tin and baked them for 10 minutes.  I like the look of the orange zest when you bite into them.  I will make these again and again.

Very nice fluffy, moist, flavorful muffins. Fantastic Versatile Recipe - Definitely a keeper!  Due to what I had on hand, I made the following substitutions:   only 1/2-Cup Sugar, 1/2-Cup Nutrioli SoyBean Oil & 1/2-Cup Stick Margerine softened, also mixed 1-Teaspoon Cinnamon into batter. Instead of Blueberries, I added 3-Large ripe Bananas mashed & mixed into batter. Then sprinkled Cinnamon/Sugar lightly on top each muffin.

I love this recipe. It is perfect, and it's hard to find a perfect muffin. I followed the recipe exact, except I replaced the blueberries and grated orange peel with 1 1/2 c. cranberry orange relish. I didn't use the topping ingredients either. I sprinkled the tops with course cane sugar before baking, and then after they were cool I mixed 1 1/2 c. powdered sugar with 3 TBS orange juice. I drizzled the glaze on the tops of the muffins. Definitely a keeper!!

THESE were really good.
Couldn't stop eating.
I did make 2 changes: used a 1/3 of the sugar and added wheat bran.

We LOVE these muffins. They are so light and fluffy and delicious. Of course they're better with fresh blueberries but frozen work great too. The only things I changed was I tripled the amount of orange zest and did half brown sugar/half granulated instead of all granulated. Perfect!

I 1 1/2'vd the recipe as I needed 3 doz. It measured out perfectly. I used 5 oranges to get the 1 1/2 cup of orange juice and used the zest of all 5 oranges.  I also topped the muffins with raw sugar before baking instead of the topping to entice the kids to eat them. They came out moist and tasty. Most of the kindergarteners liked them.

They're great.  Used all whole wheat flour and liquid egg whites (all I had).  My 3 yr old and 14 mo old both like them.   Note that batter looked dry but cooked fine.

I used whole wheat flour to replace the all purpose and applesauce to replace 3/4 c of the veg oil.  I also added extra blueberries.  Pretty darn good.  The orange flavoring is very subtle, but they are good even without it being too strong.

Very nice muffin.  I only had dried blueberries so I soaked them in orange juice for a few hours.  I also used half a cup of oil and half a cup of applesauce to cut down the fat.  I will make these again perhaps trying some honey in place of the granulated sugar.

These muffins have a great flavor. I didn't have blueberries so I used white chocolate chips. Next time, I will use the blueberries and frozen concentrate juice as another review recommended.

I didn't really care for these.  Although they were edible, they had an odd texture - kind of crumbly and cookie like.  My kids who normally gobble up this type of baked good, ate one, then refused to eat more, so now I have over a dozen muffins that will probably go into the trash.

Great Muffin!  I used substituted 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cup all purpose flour.  I also used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  Instead of eggs I used milled flaxseed.

I'm not a huge fan of the topping. The muffin was good but I will add more berries and orange juice flavoring. You barely know the oatmeal is in there.

My family loved these muffins. Next time I will add more oil to make them moist as thet were just a little dry, but they were super easy and tasted great.

I love blueberries and I love orange and this is the perfect combination! I zested a whole orange & I followed some suggestions and used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour. I also used 1/4 C. oil and 1/4 C. applesauce. I left off the topping to reduce the calories a bit more and they came out fantastic! Very moist and flavorful. Thanks for sharing Irene!

Very Good.  Forgot to put in oil but they were still AAA+++.  Everyone really enjoyed them so kept mouth shut about missing oil. Next time will not forget oil..

Awesome muffins.  Who-ever said these were dry must have over-cooked them.  Nice flavor.

I've used this for many years - handed down from my Mother.  When my 3 yr old niece asked if it had eggs (she's allergic) I modified it by substituting 3 TBLS applesauce per egg (9 total).  It came out great.  Also had to leave out the nuts from the topping for her and just used the sugar and cinnamon.

Really a nice flavor.  Found that they were a little more crumbly than I would have liked.  Also, makes a NICE bread.  We did half the batch as muffins and half the batch as bread!

I tried adding additional zest as other reviewers suggested but still got only a subtle hint of orange flavor.  These are moist muffins with a nice flavor - just not that orangy.  I was also surprised at how thick the batter was.  As an alternative to the topping, I used sparkling sugar - gave it just enough sweet and crunch without the nuts or spice.

Tasty!  Great recipe, I made it as is except substituted the 1/2 the oil for applesauce, added walnuts into the mix instead of doing the topping, and tripled the orange zest because the other reviewers mentioned that there was not much of an orange taste.  They taste healthy and yummy!

These came out very good.  I made these on a whim, and so I had to improvise.  I didn't have enough flour, so I made up for it in equal amounts of oatmeal.  I also didn't have baking soda, and used extra baking powder (although they might not have risen as much as they would have).  I also substituted pink lemonade for the orange juice.

These were delicious and easy.  I added a little more orange zest and just cinnamon and sugar for the topping. (didn't have any nuts on hand) I also used quick cooking oats.

I wanted to like these muffins, the taste was great, but someone the oatmeal was still a bit crunchy. Maybe they ment to call for quick oats instead of regular oatmeal?  I used fresh chopped cherries instead of blueberrys and left the topping off of 1/2 of them.  I really liked the topping-less ones, not too sweet and very yummy.

These were yummy! I didn't make the topping because I thought I had nuts and it turned out I didn't. Will make these again.
