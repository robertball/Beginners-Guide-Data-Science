pretty tasty alternative to a classic grilled cheese, a sophisticated version perhaps!

I don't usually make sandwiches for dinner, but this sounded good. My family loved it, said it tasted like mozzarella sticks at a restaurant, only better! Not to mention it was quick and easy!

This was good.  The cheese didn't melt before turning the sandwiches, so a bunch of it fell out.  Other than that it was easy, and the dipping sauce was good.

I totally liked the idea except I burnt the bread trying to melt the cheese.  I'm sure it would have came out better without the charcole taste... a little bland but I'll make it again i think.
