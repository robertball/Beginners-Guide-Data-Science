Just finished a bowlful of this for dinner.. really yummy and a nice kick to it. I made a couple minor changes - For some reason I only bought one can of the chili beans so i added in a can of drained back ones that I had in the cupboard.. and I used red bell pepper since they were on sale for 25 cents, and the green ones weren't. I cooked this in the crockpot too.. browned the meat and veggies and then tossed everything in for 6 hours on low

I thought this was okay.

 I would probably change a few things if I made it again:

1. I ended up transferring the meat from the skillet to a larger pot when I realized how much stuff was going to go in it. I'd probably just start with a decent sized stock pot and cook the chili in that.

2. I think I want a bit more of the yogurt mix to top off the chili. I'd probably double that next time.

3. The final product tasted a bit more like a tomato sauce than a chili, so I think I'd substitute more tomatoes for some or all of the sauce.

But overall it tasted fine, and turned out okay.
