Loved it!  Very good.  I wanted to try something beside our tradition and this was really good.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and my family asked me to make it again a few days later!

11.29.19  This is quite good, and IMO the one thing that differentiates it from every other regular cranberry sauce recipe that I’ve tried on this site is the onions, well, and the celery, too.  The only thing that I will do differently next time is cut the apple and pear into chunks instead of slices (just personal preference here).  I followed the cooking times, and I loved the slight crunch in the apple and pear, so I’d recommend not overcooking it.  Served this post-Thanksgiving on some grilled pork chops.  Solid recipe that I’d make again.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent.  Made it to go with pork...delicious sweet and savory accompaniment.  Lots of chopping, but well worth it.  So much so, that I am tempted to can some for Christmas gifts!
