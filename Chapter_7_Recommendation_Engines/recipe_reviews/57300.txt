I'm the lady who stands mesmerized in the produce aisle, smelling the summer tomatoes. If you're at all like me, lucky enough to adore these gems, the health benefit is a bonus. After confessing all of this, I did in fact come home with a basket of the red beauties. Now.. this isn't the first stuffed tomato recipe I've tried, AR and other sites included. Same old, same old; A big fat disappointment. Not to give up though, this recipe had promise. No rice or breadcrumb fillers. Instead, spinach, crumbly bacon, onion cooked in a little bacon fat. (Please, if possible use real bacon so you can stick to the recipe and get the most out of it.) A little sour cream to keep everything together and some Monterey Jack on top. There it is! I did the - take the first bite - pause- OMG?  I can see where the tomatoes could be watery. I used a paper towel to blot out the insides. Because salt will draw out the juice, don't salt the insides of the tomatoes till just before filling. This seemed to help but even the juice was delicious. I was quite happy spooning it off the plate. (Well, I really wanted to lick it off!) The filling was enough for the 4 of them. The author gives a great tip suggesting Romas for more servings. Thanks so much.

Made this for the Recipe Group this week.  We liked this, but I’d make some changes next time.  First I started with 3-3 1/2” diameter tomatoes.  I used a melon baller to scoop out the insides of the tomatoes, which worked really well.  I left probably a little less than a 1/4" shell.  I made the stuffing as directed, but added most of the cheese to it and just reserved a little to sprinkle on top.  I barely had enough stuffing to fill the tomatoes, so I would increase the amount of spinach next time.  I also reserved some bacon for garnish.  I found the baking time to be too much and one of my tomatoes totally split apart when serving.  I would make these again because they did have really nice flavor, but I would leave a thicker shell of tomato, increase the spinach, and reduce the temperature and baking time.  This was a fun recipe to try.

I made these for recipe group. I made one big change I subbed  1 cup ricotta for the sour cream because of personal taste and I forgot to add the hot sauce due to personal stupidity. However they turned out fabulous, we all loved the fact that we could taste all the ingredients. Mine were not watery at all considering I also forgot to drain the tomato shell before filling them. I would make them again in a heartbeat. Thanks for the great recipe. Cheers

Wow! Made this for Recipe Group. It's like a BLT explosion in your mouth! I know, it's not lettuce, and there is no bread. I gave up trying to get fresh spinach for it, it all looked yucky. So I drained frozen really well and used about 1/2 a normal size box. I cut the recipe in half also. Used two medium size firm tomatoes. I cut the tops off the tomato and salted the insides after gutting and put upside down on a rack to drain while I made the stuffing mix. I didn't add any extra salt. I never had a stuffed tomato so I wasn't sure I would like this, but it was fantastic! A little watery but that is from the frozen spinach I'm sure. Next time I'm using fresh. Really good, thanks ChefsyndiG! Hey we live in the same town!

Made these for Recipe Group this week. We have never had stuffed tomatoes before and we really liked these.  Used just picked tomatoes from the garden. Everyone enjoyed the freshness of the tomatoes and commented on being able to taste each ingredient. All of the flavors went together well. I used fresh baby spinach and experienced a little bit of the watery consistancy that "sassyoldlady" mentioned when cutting them open.  We usually cut back on the amount of hot sauce called for in a recipe, but everyone thought that in this one, we actually should have added a tad more. Neither of these little complaints will stop me from making these again before the end of tomato season this summer. Thanks for sharing!

I made these at my parents' house last night as a side to go with sauteed chicken breast and brown rice.  I used Roma tomatoes fresh from my friend's garden cut in half and cleaned out for this recipe.  I skipped the salting and draining step, because I didn't care if they were juicy.  They turned out perfect!  I used a 10-ounce package of frozen spinach because it's what I had on hand.  I had to add a little extra sour cream because of the extra spinach and I also used 6 slices of bacon instead of 3.  I forgot the hot pepper sauce and my parents didn't have any, so I added some salt and pepper to the filling so it wouldn't be bland.  We gobbled these down so quickly I didn't have time to take a picture!  Thanks, ChefsyndiG!

What the heck is recipe group and are all 5 of you i it together???  I made these last night just as the recipe called for and the were delish.  I used fresh tomatoes from my garden and per one comment did not scrape the tomato too thin.  Family loved them, we ate them with a side of angel hair pasta and a salad...perfect meal-didnt even miss the meat. Thanks for a delish recipe.

I made this for Recipe Group and liked it.  I used FF Sour Cream and Weight Watchers Mexican Cheese Blend.  I added the cheese to the spinach mixture and then stuffed the tomato shells.  I also topped the tomatoes with a bit of cheese after baking for 25 minutes.  I forgot to salt the spinach to taste, but will definitely do that next time.  Like others, I also experienced the watery issue, but I think if I had let the tomatoes sit for maybe 10 minutes, that would not have been noticeable. This came in at 2 Weight Watchers points with my changes.

Thanks ChefsyndiG! I have a new recipe that is especially nice for company because it can be made ahead of time and popped in the oven. We had friends over for dinner last night and everyone loved this dish. I did mix some of the cheese in with the sour cream and I didn't actually measure the cheese, so I probably used more. I used a sharp ice cream scoop to clean out the tomato, salted the interiors and let them drain a bit before I stuffed them. Just delicious, and it makes such a nice presentation! Only thing I might add next time is a little garlic.

I made some changes to the recipe to reduce heavy fat content and provide more of a Tuscany creation. I blanched Basil leaves and used them to linr the tomato cavity. I also blanched red onions rather than saute, then I used a Parma ham and a mascarponi to bind oregano leaves and finished with a Grana Padano cheese. Yummy as a starter with Veal second and wined with a full bodied Valpolicello.

OMG!!!!!!!!!! AMAZING! I followed the recipe to a T-I made no changes (on purpose atleast)! I did make one mistake though, I accidently added the cheese in the filling,  BUT it turned out perfect!I will do that anytime I make these... This was perfect for lunch! Then I also added cheese to the top! Thank you so much- Chefsyndi G!

I made this as written for Recipe Group, but I only made half the recipe since no one else was around to eat it.  These were so tasty!  I've been stuffing tomatoes for years and never thought to do them this way.  I will be making these again and I think I want to add some garlic to the filling.  Thanks for a new take on stuffed tomatoes.

My husband and I LOVED these stuffed tomatoes!  I've never made anything like it before, so I was a little nervous, but they turned out GREAT!  Something I changed to save time was I didn't use fresh bacon.  I just sprayed a small pan with cooking spray and threw the onions and spinach in the pan and then added about 1/4 cup of Hormel Real Bacon bits.  Then I sprinkled some on top of the cheese when I took it out of the oven.  It tasted great!

I feel really guilty cooking with bacon drippings, so it kind of tainted the final product for me.  I think I will make this again, though, and lose the bacon in favor of lots of garlic!

We liked this recipe.  It was not nearly as heavy as I thought it would be and the amounts were perfect to stuff 4 medium sized tomatoes.  I cut the tops off of the tomatoes and scooped out the insides with a mellon baller.  I added a bit more spinach, about a quarter cup, and a bit more bacon, 4 slices.  I put a little cheese inside of the mixture and put the rest on top at the end.  My only complaint is that I would have liked some crunch in the meal, perhaps some croutons or serving it with a grilled cheese.  I will make this again but as a side dish and with cherry tomoatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious!  I used baby spinach which turned out to be only 6 ounces, but it didn't seem to be a problem.  I cooked them on the grill wrapped in foil instead of baking and they came out great!  Had as a side with steak tips and corn on the cob.

These tomatoes are very tasty and filling. The filling is creamy with a BLT taste. Made them for a side dish but they turned out to be the star of the show. I salted the inside of the tomatoes first thing and put them upside down on paper towels. The salt draws out the excess water so give them a few minutes to sit. Used frozen spinach thawed, drained and squeezed in a kitchen towel to get out all the moisture. I've made them substituting frozen broccoli for the spinach and we liked them even more. Nice way to use up the garden tomatoes.

Very good recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, which I always do first.  I used ripe,but firm, Roma tomatoes.  I let them set to drain for 1/2 hour before preparing the filling & I didn't experience the watery problem or collapsed tomatoes that some indicated.  For me, the hot sauce took away from the dish.  I will make it again but with some changes.  Maybe use ground cayenne pepper or finely chopped jalapeno & perhaps replace sour cream with cream cheese.  Being a single person, I didn't wan"t to make 4 servings so I made the full recipe of filling, used 2 tomatoes & stuffed mushrooms with remaining filling.  They were good also.  Had them for dinner with rice & a pork chop.

These were okay, but not fantastic. I probably won't make them again. They seemed to be lacking in seasoning.

This was a great recipe.  I used a muffin pan instead of a baking sheet which worked out great.

I used fresh spinach and squeezed some juice out after the saute. Tomatoes are just watery, so not too worry, that is how it will be. This would be a good stuffing for a number of vegetables.

These were excellent. Hubby and adult son loved them. I made as directed. Next time I'd add a little pepper to tomato shells and grate a little garlic in the bacon grease.....I make these often.  I add a bit more spinach

What a pleasant change!  I'm always looking for different ways to cook vegetables and this recipe gets an A+++!  Just a couple of minor tweaks:  used shredded parmesan instead of Mexican cheese and mixed it in with everything else; and didn't have any hot pepper sauce (didn't miss it).  Served this with linguine and baked scallops:  fabulous!!

made this last night for a side dish with the divine chicken and green beans; my husband loved it!  used greek yogurt instead of cream; and frozen collard greens instead of the spinach and mixed in some mozzarella with the stuffing.  DELICIOUS.

I thought these were really good!  I used frozen spinach.  I skipped the step of cooking bacon and just bought the real bacon bits.  Normally, I think the bacon bits are not as good as the real thing but in this recipe I don't think that would matter.  Because I didn't have the bacon grease to saute the onions, I used green onions (hey, it looked a little like spinach dip now..) and I thought it was a good substitution.  With the modifications I made, I didn't even have to mess up a skillet!

This recipe was delicious!!  I did add a few more onions and seasoned both the mixture and the tomato with salt and pepper to taste. I also added more hot pepper sauce.  I cut down the cooking time until the top of the of the filling started to brown a little, about 15 minutes. I really enjoyed this and can't wait to share it with my husband when he returns from his business trip!

I liked these. At first I made them as written but made a couple changes to suit my taste. I added 1clove minced garlic. I found it a little watery so I took away half the sour cream. The cheese I mixed in with the spinach instead of melted on top.

I was surprised at how much we all loved these. DH isn't a huge fan of tomatoes so I expected he'd be 'ok' with them but he couldn't stop commenting on how good they were. Even my son made a point to say he liked these a lot. I did use frozen spinach that I defrosted & squeezed out the liquid.  Otherwise I made them according to the recipe, oh I did add garlic. Will definitely make these again!

I decided to make this after finding out it was a previous recipe group recipe. I was worried there would not be enough filling for 4 but it filled them very well. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was great with Hanover tomatoes in season.

Great way to use tomatoes! I modified only slightly by adding a little pepperjack cheese to the sour cream mixture, then topped with cheddar - I let them sit for 5-10 minutes after they came out of the oven - served with garlic bread - and it made for a nice light meal!  Will be making again soon!

Oh, these were so yummy! I followed the directions as written and wouldn't change a thing other than I doubled the amounts. I sliced around the edges with a sharp knife and then used a spoon to hollow out the tomatoes. The whole process was quite easy and everybody loved them. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

These are outstanding! I made a couple changes through- 1.  I added garlic, 2.  I used a mixture of sharp cheddar and parmesan cheese, and finally, 3.  I added chopped artichoke hearts. I served them for dinner, but I think they would be even better served for a Sunday Brunch, or luncheon.  Whatever the occasion, they are definitely a HOME RUN!!  Your guests will love them!

I hate tomatoes!  But this dish was outstanding!!!  I made these last night for my daughter-in-law's birthday dinner (paired with pork chops and garden salad) and both her and my son (who is a chef) said they were DELICIOUS!   I did use ricotta as another person had suggested, also added fresh garlic when sauteeing my onions and also added some pepper jack cheese into the mixture and on top which gave it a nice spice and helped since I forgot to add the pepper sauce.  I used fresh spinach and did not salt the tomatoes until right before filling and they were not watery at all.  Absolutely beautiful presentation.  I think I will use small halved roma tomatoes next time and serve as an appetizer using the same mixture to fill some mushrooms for the non-tomato lovers like myself (though this recipe had me sold)...  Thanks for the recipe!

Really delicious!  Make sure to thoroughly drain the tomatoes and pat them dry.  I liked them even better with an extra shot of hot sauce, and I think next time I'd mix a little cheese into the filling too.

This was pretty easy!  I left out the hot sauce and added more bacon. To make them sat and upright, I wrinkled tinfoil around them like they were foil nests with the tomatoes in the center.

Very, very good!   Ripe but firm tomatoes are necessary.  When heated, tomato skin tears easily and you want these puppies to 
stay upright.   Great way to get tasty, filling veggies - and really, what can go wrong with bacon????!!!!

I wasn't sure what firm tomatoes to use, so I used steakhouse tomatoes, just like in the photo. I did have trouble slicing the top off, since my tomatoes fell apart. I had little filling since I ran out of spinach and sour cream and added more cheese to make up for it. I did pass on the hot sauce too. Overall, it was okay.

I made changes just because I used what I had on hand.  Bacon bits, chopped green onion, cream cheese, feta and I used Capri tomatoes and didn't add the shredded cheese.  Cooked on the barby in an open casserole dish.  And for the spinach - thawed a couple of pucks of frozen chopped spinach.

Good recipe and I will make it again-- for a crowd.  I used Roma tomatoes and would recommend using them as they were tasty and held together nicely. I used a 5x9 inch glass baking dish and a dozen Romas sitting upright was not enough.  They laid in the dish semi-sideways not making the best presentation, so I covered them with crouton crumbs before baking.  I made the filling as described omitting only the sour cream and  hot sauce.  They were not missed.  The stuffed tomatoes were delicious and a great accompaniment to my roast beef, even though they were not as pretty as I had hoped.  Next time I will double the recipe or use a smaller baking pan!

I used Roma tomatoes and put them in a cupcake pan to keep them upright. Only one out of five of us liked them. They weren't bad, just not up our alley. Thanks though.

I'm always looking for side dishes to go with salmon and anything tomato seems to be a good fit. I did not go wrong with this delicious recipe!! Made it exactly to the recipe with one little exception. Oops, I mixed the cheese in with all the other ingredients. It was absolutely delicious but next time, and there will definitely be a next time, I'll sprinkle the cheese on and cook for the last 5 minutes. I highly recommend this juicy, delicious recipe!!

Made these for a small gathering and it turned out very well. Will definitely try this again. For the hot pepper sauce, I used Nandos Garlic Peri-Peri Sauce instead.

These were wonderful.  I used Romas and they worked great!  I too put the cheese into the mixture and it made it cheesy throughout.  No need to change anything, but after eating one I added some garlic salt to the second and it gave it something extra. Ate with a Blackened Ribeye. Keep the same as written or make your own.  Next time, I think I might even use blue cheese.

I'd never had stuffed tomatoes before. I doubled the bacon and also added about 5 cloves minced garlic and about 6 minced white mushrooms. Also, I used 1 cup onion and 1 cup sour cream. This mix fit into about  a dozen large Roma tomatoes. The Roma tomatoes kept this recipe from being overly juicy I think...delicious ! I deffinately plan on making this again

Theses were FANTASTIC! I am very confused as to the "blah" comments etc. The only things I did different were to use Garlic Salt to lightly salt the tomatoes before turning upside down and I used a combo of Mexican & Sharp cheddar cheese (Mexican mixed in with spinach etc. Cheddar on top). I served it at a dinner party with tenderloin steaks and they were a BIG hit. I was asked to send the recipe to all of them.

This is AWESOME! I made it with dinner tonight, thickly sliced the tomatoes and spread spinach on top instead of stuffing, cheese on top, baked till cheese just started to brown. Even my son who isn't a big fan of veggies LOVED it! This will be easy to increase the amount, and you don't even have to be all that precise about amounts, I just winged it and it was GREAT! This will be something I will definitely make again as I have tons of tomatoes in my garden.

Really tasty, really unique and REALLY simple!  I actually modified it to make a vegetarian version when I didn't have any bacon (used eggplant diced and tossed in olive oil instead of bacon).  I can only get tiny tomatoes here so I had lots of leftover stuffing.  I added a few more ingredients and converted that into a complimentary pasta dish.  Makes for a great meal!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! It was simple and fulfilling. I added about 2 cooked shredded chicken breasts and a slightly less amount of spinach but kept everything else the same. It made a light and creamy meal; very satisfying.

I wasn't impressed at all. The ingredients sounded really good, the sauce tasted good before the tomatoes were stuffed, and they looked really pretty, but the end product was just mushy blah. My husband said they were ok and didn't even finish 1/2 of one. I thought this would have been the perfect side to a steak and foccoccia bread but it just didn't turn out that way.

This recipe is great! I don't like bacon so I left it out and put in artichoke hearts, mozzerella, feta and garlic instead (put a little spin on the recipe). I think they turned out great. My guest asked for the recipe and made it the next night for herself!

Fantastic recipe that will definitely make it into the regular rotation. Any extra filling that doesn't fit makes a delicious dip while you're waiting for them to finish. I had no sogginess problems: I salted the inside walls heavily after scooping out the seed gel, and let them drain upside down for, I dunno, half an hour or maybe an hour, while I wandered off and did laundry. Lots of juice ran out, so I'm sure that helped. Didn't bake as long as directed, just directly under the broiler for as long as it took the cheese to brown. YUM!

great flavor.  Mine were a little wet and soggy despite the fact I gutted, salted, drained, etc.  Could have been the type of tomato I bought.  I made a happy mistake and used chicken wing sauce instead of hot sauce and my hand slipped putting way more then called for into the spinach mix.  Very spicy but good.  I tasted the spinach mix before stuffing the tomato and let me tell you, I will make this again just as a spinach dish with the bacon, onion, spinach and sour cream.  Thanks for sharing.  This was a pleasant surprise.  I was looking for something different as a side dish or a lunch dish.

This was delicious!  I did make one change, I replaced the hot sauce with cracked red pepper since that I what I had on hand.  It turned out great.

My husband made these and they were delicious.  Definitely must eat right out of the oven.  We will be making these again.  Thanks for sharing.  I added a picture as well.

like another reviewer, I put the cheese in the filling with the spinach and didn't have a "runny" filling.

My husband and I thought these were delicious!! I made them to liven up a leftovers night. I can't wait to make then again. I used canned spinach because that was all I had- I let it drip dry in a strainer and then patted the extra moisture out with paper towels. I also used a mixture of light and fat free sour cream to cut down on the fat.

Awesome do ahead or take along.  I added some fine sieved ricotta cheese and a teaspoon of pesto to lift the flavor.  This is a new family favorite for sure. Don't have Mexican cheese blend in New Zealand so just used edam, and it tasted great with the Tabasco Chipotle Hot Sauce as well.

This is a really good dish. I had a dab of cream cheese left so used that plus a little sour cream. Also mixed half of cheese with the spinach and added the other half the last 5 mins. Thanks ChefsyndiG for a nice new side dish.
