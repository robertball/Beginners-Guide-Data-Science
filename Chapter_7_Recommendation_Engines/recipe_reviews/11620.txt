Okay, after reading the previous reviews, I think I have a few pointers.  Anyone who is having flat cookies is probably not letting the butter soften naturally.  This is definitely important - if you use the microwave to soften the butter your cookies will certainly flatten.  If you are still having flat cookies you can try and use baking powder instead of baking soda.  The next suggestion is to add at least 2 tsp. cinnamon (and possibly some allspice and cloves if you like those flavors - 1/2 tsp. of each).  This recipe calls for rolled oats - but this does not mean traditional cooking oats - they are rolled oats also, but so are quick 1-minute oats and they will soften in the oven whereas the traditional oats will not.  And whatever reviewer suggested mixing the dough with your hands was a genius.  My hands worked so much better than a spoon.  And make sure to use 3 jumbo eggs or 4 large eggs to give it enough to keep it together.  These cookies when prepared correctly are wonderful.  By far the best oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever made!

I made these after reading many of the reviews.  I did modify the recipe a little, and the cookies were perfect...they look just like the picture and taste wonderful, and are not flat at all.  First of all, for the people who have trouble with flat cookies, check the expiration on the baking soda.  It is easy to have an expired box if you don't bake a lot.  I had a new box, but still used one tsp. baking soda and one tsp. baking powder instead of two tsp. soda.  I also used four eggs.  After reading other reviews, I used two tsp. cinnamon and a few dashes of allspice, and 1/2 tsp. salt.  Since I like to experiment, I used 1/2 cup pecans, and added some coconut and chopped dates.  I refrigerated the dough for an hour before baking. My husband, whose favorite cookie is oatmeal raisin, says they are the best ever.  Since the recipe makes so many, I experimented with some of the dough by adding chopped white chocolate to some of it and chopped semi-sweet chocolate to some of it. I baked all of the cookies for 9 minutes and they came out perfect. One tip: I always use parchment paper to bake cookies. Hope this helps with some of the problems I've read.  It really is an excellant recipe!

I'm feeling a little impatient with people who give a recipe 5 stars, saying it turned out great, and then go on to say that they changed just about EVERY single detail in the recipe.  This recipe seems to have collected a lot of that type of "5 star" reviews. After looking through earlier comments, I did the following: added some allspice, added salt, used 1 more egg, used baking powder and baking soda instead of just baking soda, let the butter soften before use, halved the amount of white sugar and lined my cookie sheets with  parchment paper.  What I ended up with was some excellent cookies, but I DIDN'T USE THIS RECIPE, doggone it. Like many of those who have given this recipe 5 stars, I used a totally different recipe that was gleaned from previous user's comments and my own experience. The difference is I'm not going to give credit where it's not deserved.

Excellent, entire batch gone in one day! I've already given out this recipe 4 times!  I made a few adjustments...half golden raisins, 1 cup walnuts, 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground cloves.  I also soaked the raisins in 2 eggs and added 1 egg to the batter for easier mixing.  Soaking the raisins in the egg makes the difference, never skip this step!

I printed two oatmeal raisin cookie recipes and this one was so good that I didnt even bother with the other recipe! The cookies weren't fluffy, but they weren't flat either. They were just right. And the taste....heaven! I followed the recipe exactly except when I was mixing. I dumped a little of the egg in early because this dough is pretty stiff and it helped with the mixing. I will be making these again!
YUMMY
Oh, one tip...let the cookies cool on the pan for about 2 minutes. This makes them easier to take off. Because they are soft cookies, if you try to remove them from the pan right out of the oven, they will just be a gooey mess.

The best I have ever eaten!  Don't make the balls too large as you drop them on the cookie sheet, or the middles will stay gooey.  Keep them around a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half.

I loved these cookies,used 1/2 cup sugar,1/2 cup brown sugar instead of a full cup. I also used 4 eggs instead of 3. My family doesn't like raisins so I added 1 cup of chocolate chips.I used 1 tsp. each of baking powder and soda instead of just the baking soda. I put in a dash of nutmeg with the cinnamon.We couldn't stop eating them!

The first 2 times I made these cookies they spread too much and were flat, altho the flavor was DELICIOUS! Today I rolled the dough into logs in plastic wrap and popped 'em in the freezer for awhile, then sliced and baked on parchment covered cookie sheets. They took a little longer to bake because the dough was cold (15 Minutes) but they came out picture perfect! Rolling the dough made everything go soo quick and easy! I had about a dozen on a plate on the kitchen table when guests dropped by, and they all thought the cookies were from a bakery. The plate was empty in no time! I would imagine the dough logs would keep nicely tightly wrapped in the fridge or the freezer, to slice, bake and pop in the oven anytime! I add 1/2 cup more flour, and more raisins. I don't use the nuts. Make sure you have plenty of milk on hand..these are sooo good!

I followed the additional tips of making sure my butter was softened naturally, as well as the OP's of soaking the raisins (srsly, why had I never thought of that,lol). I added chopped walnuts and a bit more cinn & cloves cause I like em a bit spicy, and they were fanfreakintastic! I did notice that when they were just out of the oven, they were a bit more "cakey" than I was hoping, but once they cooled they took on the consistancy i was hoping for originally...you know, flattened a bit, densed up some, but were still soft and bendy and flexi goodness. Definitely a keeper recipe for me :)

I don't bother to soak the raisins and they are still perfect. I'm only a little curious as to how that extra step could make these any better. I also add a cup of chocolate chips--the combination of flavors makes them especially delicious.  These have been a part of my Christmas cookie trays for more than 3o years and I always make them a little more special and festive by dressing them up with a maraschino cherry half before baking.

These were the best oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted!  Everyone else that tried one loved them too!  I added about 1/2 tsp all spice to give them a boost of flavor.  They are moist and chewy just how I like them!  Thank you for the awesome recipe!

These are a pretty good oatmeal raisin cookie if you're looking for a cake-like cookie vs. a crispy cookie. Unfortunately, I was looking for a more crispy cookie.  Don't get me wrong, this cookie is good, but just not one that I would make again.

Great Cookies....I read some reviews before baking.  I went with 4 eggs, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, 2 tsps cinnamon.  I omitted the nuts, only because I have a toddler. Everything else I did the same.  I mixed the butter and sugars in my Kitchen Aid Mixer, then added the flour mixture, I mixed that with a spatula, I then added the egg mix and oats, I started mixing with a spatula, found it did look dry, so I washed my hands and I mixed it the "good old fashioned way" I found that it did the trick. Even though hands were gooey, batter looked good. I used a small scoop to put them on the cookie sheet. I did bake them between 10-12 minutes.  The cookies not only looked great but tasted fantasic. I just took the last batch out of the oven. Does make alot of cookies, but my family will not complain. I would recommend this recipe to anyone craving oatmeal raisin cookies.  This is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

I can't believe this recipe is getting four and five stars. IT'S MISSING SALT. It wasn't until I had already made two dozen and taste tested one that had cooled when I realized it. The cookie tasted like nothing. Just...nothing. I added a 1/2 tsp of salt to the rest of the batter and those cookies tasted much better. I would suggest adding 1 - 1 1/2 tsp of salt to the full recipe.

This is the best oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I've ever tried! The cookies came out so soft and chewy. I love that the raisins are plumped; it keeps them soft and chewy in the cookie. The only change I made to this recipe is that I omitted the nuts and added extra raisins. This is going to become my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe...thanks for sharing!

Oatmeal raisin cookies are my all-time favorite kind of cookie.  I feel like I have tried 100's of different recipes and am always looking for a new one to try.  There is a particular bakery in town that makes my favorite oatmeal raisin cookie, and no recipe that I have made at home has ever come close...  until now. I followed this recipe to the letter, and while trying to incorporate the dry ingredients in, I almost gave up.  The dough resembled more of a crisp topping - it was crumbly and would not stay together.  I re-read the recipe 10 times and could not figure out what was wrong.  I decided to use my hands and roll these cookies into balls and bake them.  I wasn't actually expecting this to work, and when the cookies came out of the oven, I was amazed.  Even more amazing is the taste of the cookies.  They are the best I have ever had, and my husband agrees.  Seriously, they are so good.  My only hope now is that if I did make a mistake while putting the dough together, that I duplicate the mistake again next time I make these.

These are terrific.  But I do want to let whoever makes them to expect double what the recipe says.  I think I will have about 5 dozen.  Mine were not at all dry but I did have to mix by hand very difficult too as my arms are weak (old age :-)
Thank you very much for a beautiful and delicious cookie.  My oven is a bit off so I turned my heat down to 340 degrees and cooked for 11 minutes. Watching carefully.  Thanks again.  It is a definite keeper.

Totally good cookie, despite not adding the pecans. I needed to avoid nuts at last minute when I was making these because I found out someone I was donating these cookies to, had a but allergy. But I'll totally make again. I love a good oatmeal and raisin cookie, it's my downfall. And I can see adding a bit more raisins for it to be a tad chunkier ;-)

Ok I have to admit I was really tempted to skip the raisin-soaking step.  But so many reviewers said it was essential, so I went ahead and did it. And I am so glad I did! These cookies are awesome! And the raisins were so plump and flavorful. The only changes I made were 4 eggs instead of 3 since my eggs were on the small side and I used 1/2 cup of macadamia nuts and 1/2 cup of walnuts. I will make these again and again! Thanks for sharing!

First off, the changes: Per the vast majority of the previous reviews, I added an extra egg to increase fluffiness/avoid flatness. With one extra egg they are slightly cakey. I prefer chewy cookies so might try adding some oil next time rather than egg.   I added about two shots of whiskey and a dash of allspice to the mixture to soak the raisins in. I prepared these cookies without that step and they were definitely a little bland for me. Adding those made them more my taste.  That said, this was a great easy recipe and made solid, old fashioned oatmeal raisin cookies that would probably lend themselves really well to taking some semi sweet chips in as well. Definitely a keeper.

Awesome oatmeal cookie recipe.  The only thing I did differently was use half butter and half shortening.  I actually made it twice.  The second time, I omitted the cinnamon/raisins, and substituted chocolate chips.  Yummy!

I had an oatmeal cookie recipe that I used all the time and was afraid to try a new recipe.  However, I'm glad I tried something new!  These truly are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had.  I took others suggestions.  I used 1 tsp. baking soda and 1 tsp. baking powder.  I also used 2 tsp. of cinnamon rather than one. The cookies were soft and fluffy, and they didn't last long around our house.

I don't agree with other reviewers that these are "the best".  These are average, nothing special, basic oatmeal raisin cookies. We were very disappointed.  The 2 tsps of baking soda gave them a bitter taste to us.  You can soak the raisins while making any oatmeal raisin recipe - it didn't make these cookies worthy of the the hype.  I've tried several oatmeal raisin cookie recipes from this website and my favorite continues to be: Beth's Spicy Oatmeal Raisin Cookies (which has a full 5 star rating).

My boyfriend has NEVER loved anything so much!  By far his favorite cookie.. maybe any food in general.. that I have ever made.    I didn't have time to soak the raisins- and it was still great!

This is by far the BEST oatmeal raisin cookie recipe.  Everytime I bake these cookies, my ego soars!  People tell me I should be selling them!  They are delicious.... I soak the raisins for up to 2 hours and double up on the cinnamon!  Thanks!

I made one change....I used 1/2 c of oil since I had no butter or margerine.  They tasted yummy!  They were a bit crunchy and they stuck a bit to the pan, but I think that had to do with the substitution.  Still a really yummy cookie.

The reviews were very helpful! 

I added an egg (4 total), and split the 2 tsp. of baking power to one tsp. of baking powder, one tsp. of baking soda. I put the cinnamon in the raison/egg/vanilla soak and I toasted my pecans.

They turned out great! Mine turned out just like the picture! Two thumbs up! My mom and sister-in-law couldn't wait until they were cooled!

Also.. I work at a bakery and they are always telling me not to over-stir my cookie dough and to always toast my nuts. Hope that helps other novice bakers like me! :D

Great cookies. Used 4 eggs, added 1 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup coconut. Soaking the raisins made them taste great!

i was a bit disappointed to be honest.  they turned out a bit flat and im used to oatmeal raisin cookies being really chunky.  but they were very light which i did like and quite tasty so i went on and gave a 4.

These are absolutely the best cookies I have ever had - of any kind of cookie.. EVER! I took some advice from other reviewers though. Instead of just adding 1 tsp of cinnamon, I made it 2. Added 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder instead of doing 2 tsp of soda, and instead of adding pecans I added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, very very very yummy and chewy.

I give these 5 for the excellent flavor--they remind me of some of the expensive Oatmeal Raisin versions available in some bakeries.  I followed the recipe to a t except I left out the nuts, and I mixed on low setting instead of stirring by hand.  I think soaking the raisins prior makes the cookies more moist.

I did not care for this recipe! I tried it twice and included all the suggestions and it came out a fluffy mess. They weren't even recognizable! The recipe has way too much flour for the amount of oats. I'd recommend finding a recipe with about 2 times the oats to the flour ratio. Had to abandon this one and find another recipe. But this is the first time I've found a highly rated recipe that didn't work for me.

Update to my original review (4/19) Second time I made this I substituted 1/2 of the butter with Smart Balance® and this was not a good idea.  Cookies came out way too soft (tendency to fall apart when picking up) and had a sweeter flavor than original recipe. Looking forward to making a third time this weekend (using all butter) but will try dried cranberries instead of raisins.  Excellent cookie.

4/19: "The Best!"  I took the advice from one of the reviews and and added 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder because I feared a flat cookie.  These came out picture perfect. I extended bake time an extra minute because I made them a little larger, but recipe still yielded 50 cookies. Excellent flavor.  Thank you!

A real winner here.  I have used the same recipe for years, but decided to try a new one.  Wow, sure glad I did.  I was worried because the mix seemed a little dry, but they turned out gooey and perfect.  My hint would be to do the final mixing with your hands and use hands to place on cookie tray instead of spoon.  It stays together better when using hands to drop on cookie sheets. I also only cooked 8 to 9 minutes. My family are not nut lovers, so I left them out and they were perfect.  Thanks for this one.

I decided to try this recipe because I like soft cookies not the crispy ones but I also like my oatmeal cookies with a bit of spice to them. So I had to tweak it to my liking. The only thing I can say bad about this recipe is that for some reason salt was omitted in the recipe. I added a tsp of salt, increased the cinnamon by one tsp then added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/8 tsp of allspice. I was out of baking soda so I used 4 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp cream of tarter as a substitute and I did not use maragine I always try to use real butter. The cookies came really good. The were not flat and they were nice and soft like I like them. I did not get 6 dozen or more I actually only got 5 dozen but maybe I made mine a little bigger than the recipe called for. All in all this is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

These were amazing!! My secret ingredients were organic brown sugar and whole wheat flour. I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour. Oh WOW they were soooo good. Everyone who ate them thought the same. They were super moist for every day they lasted in the kitchen (about 4).

5 stars with my changes...combine 2 eggs & 1 Tablespoon of vanilla with 2 cups of raisins in bowl for one hour. Cream the butter with 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 sm. pkg of vanilla instant pudding, and 1 egg. Use 2 teaspoons of apple pie spice, 1 teaspoon of baking soda & 1 teaspoon of baking powder & 1 teaspoon of salt.. Everything else was the same. Baked for 11 minutes on parchment paper = the best oatmeal raisin cookies I and my family have ever had!!!!

I thought these turned out great.  However, they were thinner than they look in the picture and I would probably add some baking powder to the recipe in the future either in place of baking soda or to replace some of the baking soda.  I also added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon which is barely detectable.  After you mix everything together, the dough seems really dry as if you should add another egg.  I did not and I really liked the flavor of these cookies.  They are distinctive.  My only concern is the flatness and that can be corrected with baking powder.  All in all, highly recommend.

These cookies are out of this world.  The only thing slightly different than the published recipe that I did was to use 4 large eggs instead of 3.  When it came to the part to add in the raisins, oats, and nuts, I used my hands like one of the other reviewer's suggested.  Also, towards the end of mixing in the flour mixture, I poured the egg out of the raisin bowl to help let the batter stick together better.

I will not be making these again.  I followed the recipe and reviewers suggestions.  I let the butter soften naturally (not in the micro) I even chilled the dough for a couple of hours before baking and they still came out wafer thin.  I will keep looking for an oatmeal cookie recipe.

These cookies are always in one of my cookie jars and are the favorite of everyone who comes to our home-I boil the raisins for about 5 min then let cool before starting.

These were good but they were quite basic.  I did add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and an additional egg to the batter when I combined everything because it was very tough to mix.  Although the dough was sticky I found it easiest to spoon some out and then roll into small balls.  I did not flatten them on the cookie sheet, they baked up nicely uniform.  My oven is "off" so I seldom go by the times suggested therefore I can't offer any comment on that.  I have just gotten into the habit of watching my baked goods while they are in the oven and gauging from there.  The first sheet I baked just until they were VERY LIGHTLY golden--this pan stayed moist and chewy, even when cooled.  The second sheet was forgotten about for a few minutes and were medium brown--these cooled to a much harder texture.  Don't over-bake them if you want soft, chewy, moist cookies. Sure did make my house smell wonderful and they were tasty...but not a whole lot different than other oatmeal raisin recipes I've tried.  I think that soaking the raisins for an hour--I just don't plan that far ahead, ha ha--was just an annoying extra step.  You could microwave them in a bit of water with a splash of rum or vanilla for the same effect and in much less time.

I had high hopes for this recipe based on the number of reviews it had.  However, a lot of people gave it more stars based on CHANGES they had made to it.  The actual original recipe does not deserve 5 stars.  I followed the recipe and my cookies came out flat, spread too much.  Stuck to the parchment paper and had to gently peel them off after they cooled.  They had great taste but you could not even hold them in your hands to eat them.  They fell apart all over the place.  After the 1st batch I put the dough in the refrigerator to see if that would help the spreading.  Nope.  Then the next batch I put in the freezer (cookie sheet and all).  Didn't help.  I added baking powder and a touch more flour to thicken it a bit.  Didn't help.  I tried all the suggestions the other reviewers had and they still spread and came out flat.  Onto another recipe.

The best oatmeal cookies ever.  Got mixed reviews from others.  Some say perfect, some say too sweet.  Just taste preference I guess.  Only tip I have is to let the butter get soft naturally. If you must microwave, then only till it just starts to melt, then whip it before you add your sugar.

My dad loves oatmeal raisin cookies so I have been making this recipe for his birthday for the last couple of years.  I use 1 cup of quick oats and 1 cup of regular oatmeal in place of the rolled oats, because that's what I always have on hand.  I've never had problems with them being too flat.  This is the best oatmeal raisin cookie I've tried.  I love it!

These are the BEST oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever tasted. Most oatmeal cookies are too sweet, but these are perfect. Crisp, yet chewy. Very flavorful. Can't wait to try this recipe with Cranraisins. Thanks so much for sharing!

Among the cookie recipes I have tried, I have to say that this is one of my favorites.  I could not stop grabbing "just one more". I tried substituting half of the raisons for some crasins and it came out quite delicious. One of my favorite qualities of this recipe is the texture. The cookes don't crumble in your mouth, but don't also droop when held.  In all a wonderful recipe. DEFINATELY worth trying.

This recipe is the best I have ever made. The cookies came out soft and chewy. Usually my oatmeal cookies come out hard. Everyone LOVE them. I made another batch with cranberries, macadamion nuts, and white chocolate. Those were a big hit. Delicious!

These cookies were very average-tasting...I did however, toast the walnuts (substituted for pecans) and used raw sugar only. Maybe that made a difference, maybe I have high expectations...

Very moist, very delicious!  Even my husband who "hates" oatmeal/raisin cookies couldn't resist.  Soaking the raisins does seem to make these cookies better than any I have tried.  I have given the recipe out many times and no one has had a bad batch yet!

If someone is giving these less than 5 stars, they are doing something wrong. :) Will never use any other oatmeal raisin cookie recipe again! These are delicious. Made several times. (left out pecans tho, since we dont like them) and what makes these cookies is the soaking the raisins first! You will only get a gooey cookie by using butter. Also, this recipe needs 2 changes, 4 eggs not 3 and it needs 1/4-1/2 c more flour! otherwise they spread!

These are the BEST oatmeal cookies I've ever made.  I did make some changes to fit my family's taste.  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar..we don't really like our cookies too sweet and this change was perfect.  I also added some cranberries and some walnuts and I added 1 extra egg and 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I've been looking for one that taste good and after many tries I finally found one.

These are lovely! However next time I will add more raisins. I used lovely organic eggs so i had no problmes with the dough being too dry. I also ran out of brown sugar so I substituted Muscavado sugar (very similar)I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cloves. 
My husband loves anything oatmeal raisin...i had to stop him from eating the dough!

These are by far the best cookies! Read most of the reviews so came up with this... Changed the eggs to extra large instead of large to take into account other reviews calling them too dry, also reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup and up'd the brown to 1 1/2 cups. Saoking the raisins is the key to these. Next time I will probably add more raisins bu that is only because I love them and can never have enough. Finaly, these make loads of cookies, so make sure you have lots of cookie sheets handy! Good luck!

This turned into a very good cookie, though I did have to make a small change: I found the mixture to be a bit on the dry side, so I added an extra egg. This made the dough the right consistency, and made the cookies fluffy and chewy, and turned out wonderfully.

These are the best Oatmeal Raisin Cookies that I ever ate. I tweeted it a little bit by adding 1/4 cup of milk and baking them for 11 minutes. They were soft and chewy.

I have to admit that I "doctored" this a bit, but only becae I was looking specifically for an apricot cookie. Instead of raisins, I used chopped dried apricot and I replaced 1 cup of the rolled oats with toasted coconut. Absolutely fabulous cookies!!!

Great, with modifications! I add an extra egg yolk (tried it once with a whole egg, and felt they were just a tiny bit too soft. Just the yolk does the trick for me). I also used one tsp of baking powder with 1 tsp of baking soda, 2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp each of allspice and cloves.

This is a great recipe. I made a batch before leaving on business Sunday night, when I returned Tuesday night they were all gone and kids greeted me by asking for more.  I used butter flavored crisco, and 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda.

LOVE this!  Best than any I've ever had or made.  People who don't even like oatmeal raisin cookies love these.  My test run was with a half recipe, with 1/2t baking soda & 1/2t of baking powder.  A very different type of cookie.  The full recipe on the 2nd round, followed exactly, was exceptional!  I've shared with my neighbors & my local police department in appreciation of their work.  PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT!!!!!

I'm giving this 5 stars because most oatmeal cookie recipes are bland. That being said this one desperately needs 1 t. salt, under-baking slightly and like all cookies, will benefit from chilling the dough (chewier, denser cookies). I added chocolate chips and wished I'd halved or left out the raisins. Also, my cookies were not flat but I always use a half and half mix of "white" whole wheat flour and regular white flour for all my cooking so that might have changed the outcome. Dark brown sugar gives a fuller flavor. If nothing else, add the salt. It will make these cookies ideal.

I started making this recipe and then read some of the reviews on how to "fix" it. No recipe that needs to be changed by multiple people should have 5 stars

I did add the extra egg others mentioned and these were fantastic. Next time I'll space them about 2 inches apart to keep them from touching. Great cookies.

I actually don't really know how to rate the recipie because after reading the reviews and getting all the tips from there it's not even the original recipie. I don't have time to fool around soaking raisins for an hour; I dumped some water with them and put them in the microwave for a minute and let them stand for 5 minutes and they're amazing. I put in 1 tsp. of powder instead of the second tsp. of soda, doubled the cinnamon, added some salt and cloves, and an extra egg. Less white sugar. They are good cookies but not amazing, I will try another recipie next time.

I dislike it when a reviewer changes a recipe then rates it poorly.  I would not rate this recipe poorly with or without my changes.  I adopted all of Marilee's tips - 4 eggs, 1 tsp. each, baking powder/soda, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and I added a quarter teaspoon allspice.  These cookies have put a delectable aroma in my home and taste just as good.  I also omitted the pecans because of nut issues (they're all nuts) and will use more raisins the next time.   I subbed the white sugar for Splenda and did half white, half whole wheat flour.  I have to please the diabetics.  Really nice result.  Warning:  If you soak the raisins in the eggs, make sure you're good to go in an hour.  I wasn't ready yesterday and the raisins turned into a gloppy mess overnight.  I discarded them and started fresh today.  Thanks Gerirein.  These are excellent even when you cheat.

Made some of the changes suggested by other members, added my own glaze, and these where a smash hit! I see no reason to go in search of any other oatmeal raisin cookie recipes, this one got the job done...YUM!

Very nice texture  and flavour. Cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup white and brown sugar(don't like overly sweet cookies) Omitted the pecans(nut alergy) Otherwise kids loved them.

This is an awesome recipe. The brown sugar makes it awesome! Everyone commented on how chewy and delicious they were. I love the plumped up raisins also. 

I kept the dough in the fridge between batches so they wouldn't spread so thin. Make sure you cook them a little longer if your dough is pretty cold. 

These are kind of hard to tell when they're done. When the edges are just slightly browned, I cooked 1 more minute, then took them out. The centers will look undone but just let them sit on the sheet for 4 min then transfer to a cooling rack. Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and these are the best oatmeal cookies ever.  I sifted the flour directly into the measuring cups then leveled off and added to my dry ingredient bowl.  My batter was not dry or crumbly at all.  It did make more cookies than suggested.  My husband ate half a gallon size tea jar of cookies after dinner.

This is an excellent recipe. The soaking of the raisins is key. They stay moist and delicious. The only thing I changed, is I use about 1 1/2 cups of oats instead of 2 cups. They turn out chewy and delicious!

We made a double batch and they are by far the very best oatmeal cookies we have ever had.

My husband took some to the office and 10 persons are clamoring for the recipe.

I agree that soaking the raisins is important, the number of eggs, and the using of all real butter.

I used dark brown sugar, as I think that that is of more character, and also I use very expensive  Madacascar Bourbon Vanilla Extract and also do add the pecans. I also shook in a bit of nutmeg.

Hey, why not use the best ingredents and not make it so often.

Excellent! 
Due to previous reviews stating that the batter was dry, I fluffed the flour before measuring it and turned out just fine.
These are really good!

Awesome recipe! I used 1 2/3 cup of packed brown sugar instead of using 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. The cookies came out great! I also added another teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.

Much like all the other reviews, one word describes these cookies perfectly ... HEAVEN!  They are soft and chewy, exactly what I was looking for.  I've made this recipe twice already, first batch didn't last too long -- all six dozen it made lasted three days or so.  The second batch lasted a few days longer (made on Sunday as as of Friday night, they were still soft ... and gone).  EXCELLENT Recipe.  (I also had another recipe for Oatmeal Raisin cookies that I'm not even going to attempt.  This one is definately saved.)

A great oatmeal cookie recipe that I will defiantly use again. The only thing I would change is the amount of baking soda. I wish I had read some of the rerviews before making the cookies. A lot of people recommended substituting a tbs of baking powder for one of the 2 tbs of baking soda. I'll defiantly do that next time. Other then that the cookies were perfect.

These are just great!  I followed the recipe, but added my own version of the spices (including ginger, allspice, cloves).  Also, I took the advice of another reviewer and put the dough in plastic wrap, rolled it into a log, and froze it for about 1/2 hour.  Then I cut the cookies onto the parchment covered trays, and they turned out beautifully shaped.  I sprinkled the outside of the "log" with holiday sprinkles, then put more on top after cutting: festive and yummy!

These are THE BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted/made.    Several of my friends whom do not "like" oatmeal raisin cookies RAVED about these cookies. We followed the directions to the letter. We do not own a sify so we just used a fork to remove the lumps from the flour.  It did take a little more than 10 min to bake.

These are my husbands FAVORITE cookies. I'm not much of an oatmeal raisin lover, but I have to admit, these are GOOD! My modifications: used 4 eggs, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp of salt, unsalted butter, and I always bake on parchment paper. Perfect every time!

This is my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe.  There is a lot of sugar in the recipe so I'll usually sub-white sugar for fine natural cane sugar.   I always soak the raisins and leave them in the fridge for a few hours - same amount I'd leave out the butter to soften.  And then I make the dough, roll it up into 3" diameter logs in saran wrap, and bake later on.  I think the cold dough makes the cookies super soft.

Love love love these! These were such a hit that I baked them 3 times in a week! When I ran out of raisins so used dried cranberries...didn't have pecans around so I used walnuts instead.  I used others' advice and added 1/2 tsp of salt to bring all the flavors together. DELICIOUS!!!

very delicious and moist! definately need to mix by hand and let the butter melt naturally.   I have made these twice the first time i let it melt naturally and the second time i microwaved it and the cookies turned out totally flat and not as delicious as the first time.  Making these again tonight and the butter is already sitting out!

I actually swapped out the raisins and pecans and just added chocolate chips, and added a bit more oats. I brought these to a cookie swap 2 weeks ago, and people are still telling me how good my cookies were. Highly recommend!  YUMMMM!

These oatmeal raisin cookies were great!  I followed the recipes just as it appeared, it did seem kind of dry, like some other reviewers said, but they turned out perfect!  Also, the recipe did not say what type of oatmeal to use, so I used the quick-one minute oats and they seemed to work fine.  Definitely will be making these again.  Thanks :)

Aside from having a hard time getting these super moist cookies off the cookies sheet, they were delicious and very easy to make!  I left out the pecans and added a little nutmeg.  I ended up cooking them for 13 minutes and took one of the reviewers suggestions and left the cookies on the cookie sheet for 3 minutes so they didn't fall apart when I tried to take them off.  My husband couldn't stop eating them!!

I'm a novice to baking (got laid off, got bored one day ....) so this recipe appealed to me because it seemed easy enough that I could handle it and the spices suggested they would be tasty. I was right. I followed the recipe as written -- no alterations or substitutions -- and it was super easy to put together. I used a melon baller to drop the cookies on the sheets and the cookies came out in a decent shape and size. Most importantly, though, they were super delicious. The spices are rich and warm and I have to believe the raisins are chewy, plump and juicy due to the soaking. The cookies turned out slightly crisp on the outside and wonderfully chewy on the inside. It's what my wife called "perfect" and I'd have to agree. I think these are going to appear on our Holiday cookie plates for neighbors and friends this year.

These were pretty darn good. I did, however, add an extra egg as they didn't look like they were gonna hold together very well. I also added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and baked an additional 2-3 minutes. They weren't flat and not too soft and my daycare kids were quite happy

Great recipe, I tried it just as written once and it was great.  I modified it with double raisins and added some rum to the liquid to soak the raisins.  Also added a 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves and left off the pecans.  Added some extra baking powder.  They are truly scrumptious.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white.

I made these cookies yesterday afternoon, and rated them 4 stars because I thought they would benefit from more spices.  Well, the cookies sat on the cooling rack all afternoon and last night.  I ate one for breakfast this morning (we need our daily oatmeal, don't we?)...and have completely changed my mind about the cookies.  They are soft, chewy, just the right amount of sweetness, the raisins are perfect... they are so, so very good.  They're the best.

Perfect. Made 54 cookies at the 1 tsp. size. the only thing I changed was to swap out pecans for walnuts. Also I kept the batter in the fridge while the cookies baked.

Wow, I am shocked at how good these were. This was my first oatmeal cookie attempt, although I am used to making chocolate chip. I borrow some of the tips that I use for our awesome chocolate chips that maybe seemed to enhance this recipe even more. I softened the butter on top of a warm oven while the eggs were soaking the raisins. I also added extra cinnamon to every ingredient until it had a nice smell to it (I love cinnamon!) because pre-ground can be weaker. I also added a pinch of salt because every baked good needs it in my opinion. More importantly, I used these extra thick (what I call "hippy oats") rolled oats and I was worried about them being too dry. I drizzled a few tablespoons of milk to the oats so they would absorb some of the moisture while I creamed the butter and sugars. I made sure that there was not extra liquid when I mixed the oats into the batter, just a tiny, tiny amount so they would soften easier. This was very effective! I also rotate my cookie pans after 4 minutes on dark non stick, and 5 minutes on regular cookie sheets. We cook on parchment paper to avoid over browning, and use a flip icecream scoop to make sure all the cookies are the same size (which controls the spread), and cook evenly. These cookies were soft and chewy, with an excellent flavor (I omitted the nuts because I didn't have them). Remove cookies immediately from the pan, starting with the brownest ones first. They will keep cooking on the pan if you leave them there, which you

These are probably the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever made.  My husband, who is *not* a cookie eater, kept exclaiming, "Wow, these are good cookies!"  Every time he wandered through the kitchen he grabbed a few.  I made the recipe exactly as written, except made the dough into large balls, flattened them slightly, and baked them for 11 mins.  Perfect!

Good!

I added a little extra cinnamon, chopped the raisins before soaking them, and added half baking soda half baking powder.

350 F is too hot for these guys--it took only about 4 minutes for them to get a bit too brown an this heat.  I lowered the heat a bit.  Very soft.

Taking into consideration everyone's comments, I also let my butter soften naturally (while the raisins were soaking), and I used an extra egg (4 large ones) instead of just 3. I tried to be a bit healthier, so I decreased the amount of flour by 1/2 cup, and increased the oats by 1/2 cup. Lastly, I substituted half of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat. Eveything turned out perfectly. The cookies were perfectly chewy and delicious, and my husband couldn't tell I used whole wheat flour or more oats.

Very good cookies!  The texture is great, and the flavor is good.  The best part is the big juicy raisins (the soaking is genius!).  I added a half teaspoon of nutmeg, which I think added a lot to the cookies, and next time I would reduce the white sugar by quite a bit - these were very sweet.

I can only give it 4 stars because I changed it up abit. First, I used half butter half applesauce at room temp. Second, I added a dash of cloves, nutmeg and salt. With the added changes this becomes a 5 star recipe for me!!

This is a great recipe and the best one for oatmeal raisin that I have ever baked. My husband and daughter thought they were best oatmeal raisin they had ever eaten. My co-workers offered (the men) to pay me to make them for them. Thanks for sharing this is a must try recipe.

Exactly what I was looking for!! I am very picky when it comes to oatmeal raisin cookies so I am so happy I found the right cookie on the first shot.
 I added a little extra cinnamon and omitted the nuts. I used stoneground whole wheat flour too. These are amazingly perfect cookies! A definite keeper!

man did these go fast at work! i didnt use any nuts, as i think nuts are useless, but i did make a batch with chocoloate chips. the ones with the choc chips were eaten first, but once people started eating the ones without the chocolate they decided they liked them even more! i agree...yum, thanks for the recipe

These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever made!  I froze half the dough, thawed and baked a week later, and they were just as good.  They are slightly crisp on the outside, but chewy inside - not cakey at all.  I didn't have any trouble with spreading, but if you do, try putting the cookie sheets with the cookies on them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before baking them.  My family and neighbors loved them, too.  Update:  These are now regularly requested by my family.  I use old-fashioned oats, because the quick oats seem to make them more cakey, and I like chewy oatmeal raisin cookies.

First time cookie baker, Followed the recipe verbatim and mixed all ingredients by hand ( with rubber gloves
of course). Formed the cookies by hand also and made the 36 cookies. Only thing I did differently was bake them for 12 minutes instead of 10. Absolutely delicious !! Thank you.

These were VERY GOOD,I am happy I made them.  I would recommend them definitely.  Make sure you do the 1/2 baking soda and 1/2 baking powder, up your cinnamon to 2 tsp. and add just a bit of allspice and nutmeg.  Also, I found that 1 cup of raisins was not enough, I would use 1 1/2 cups of raisins next time.  But very nice cookies, ENJOY!

Very good, very soft cookies that are way too easy to gobble down with coffee before you realize how many you've had.  I used only whole wheat flour, half the sugar, and walnuts instead of pecans.  Yum!

I would recommend trying this delicious recipe to anyone! I just started learning how to cook, and oatmeal raisin cookies were something I really wanted to learn.  This recipe was so easy to make and just delicious!!  My future mother-in-law is an amazing cook, and even she was impressed by them.  The only critism I had was that they were too small and they felt fat for eating 5 or 6 at a time! :) These were great!!

I too did the 1/2 and 1/2 for the baking soda & baking powder. I added a smidge more cinnamon and walnuts instead of pecans. I can't wait to bring them all to work tomorrow to get rid of them because I'm eating them all myself!!! YIKES!

Very good cookies!  I used a HEAPING cup of raisins and soaked them in 2tsp. of vanilla for an hour, then realized I was supposed to add the eggs.  So, I added the eggs and soaked them for another 45 minutes.  (I don't know if that made a difference or not, but the raisins taste really good).  I cut back the baking soda by a 1/2tsp. and added a 1/2tsp. of baking powder.  They turned out beautiful!  My kids couldn't wait to get their little hands on them.  I will definately make again, the only thing I might do different is only add a 1/2 cup of white sugar (they sure are sweet.)  Thanks so much for sharing this one!

Great recipe.  After reading a lot of reviews i used all spice instead of cinnamon.  THAT DID THE TRICK!  very spicy just perfect, kids LOVED them.  I eliminated the nuts as I'm allergic and never noticed they were missing.  I did need to add an extra egg.  The cookies came out soft and just right.  The cookies i make usually always come out flat but not these.  I will make these again and again.

These are yummy. I think next time I will make the cookies bigger. I dropped the dough by 1 inch round spoonfulls......it made like 80 cookies lol...

Update: A few days later and we've gone through most of them. I actually think I'm satisfied with the size as well. If you don't over cook them they are moist and chewy. 10 minutes is plenty even if the dough doesn't look quite done in the middle. It sorts it self out as it cools. This for me is the perfect oatmeal cookie recipe.

Very soft and yummy!  Only used the brown sugar and they came out just to my taste - not too sweet.  And baked them for exactly 10 min - delicious!  Had to add just a DASH (maybe 1 tbsp) of milk to soften the dough a bit, but these cookies came out delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and these cookies just aren't good.  Typically, you cream the butter and sugar, then add the egg.  This recipe has a different order, which I followed, but adding the flour before the eggs just didn't work for me.  The cookies were flat and tasteless.

Incredible cookies! I adore cooking with a passion that will not cease. My father loves oatmeal rasin cookies, and I have tried many recipies, each one him loving :) However this is by far the best. I am trying other recipies as we speak to see if they add up.
The cookies melt in your mouth, however I should add, DONT over cook them!@ Take them out just before you tink you should and they will be crispy and chewy... mmm... schrumpshous

These cookies are simply the best oatmeal raisin I have ever tasted. I can't keep them in the house. My friends and family just love them. I made no alterations to the recipie, I think the next time I make them I will add some dried cranberries and cocoanut.

This is a very good recipe. I reduced the butter by 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup more flour. Otherwise, these cookies would have been flat! I'm keeping this recipe!

"Soaking the raisins is definitely a great idea.  My cookies turned out a little flat but delicious and soft.  I will make these again!"

That was over a year ago.  I've made this recipe since many times, and every time I convert someone to the recipe.  My mom begged me for it.  Several people have told me they are the best cookies they've ever had.  People who don't like cookies like these cookies.  Family members have stolen them out of each other's mailboxes.  What more can I say??

My niece was in town and she loves oatmeal raisin cookies. I made the recipe exactly as written. These were good, but more cake-like. My niece didn't care for the texture of the cookie at all.

I love the idea in soaking the raisins in the egg and vanilla. In addition I added an extra large egg extra cinnamon and changed to one ts baking soda one ts baking powder. I also added a ts of salt to my recipe. I cooked the batter at 350 for ten minutes they came out lovely inbetween batches i refrigerated the dough. The cookies were amazing with these changes!!

Pretty average oatmeal raisin cookie by my tastes.  I even made some changes to give it more flavor-more cinnamon and some ground allspice.  Needs lots more raisins also.

These are tasty, traditional oatmeal cookies. I cut the servings size to 24 and made some additional changes once the ingredients list had been adjusted: added in 2/3 cup shredded coconut, 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, an additional 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and one more egg into the whole batter, not the soaking part (I used three large eggs total). This batter made 20 "fat", medium-sized oatmeal cookies, the type/size you can get a la carte at bakeries. I baked at 350 for thirty minutes (until they were browned). I prefer a chewier oatmeal cookie, so maybe an eggier batter (other reviewers suggested 3-4 jumbo eggs) and taking out before totally browned would make a difference. I can tell this is a great recipe and only needs minor tweaking to get it there. I will make again and update!

delicious flavor, I will add more spice next time, but very good.  Going by other reviews, I made a small change- I exchanged 1 tsp of baking powder for one of the tsp of baking soda, and I had only medium eggs so I used 4 instead of 3 large.  It made the dough softer than others have stated theirs were.  The cookies were flat but not unusually so.  I added ½ c chocolate chips so cut the raisins down to a half cup, but that wouldn't affect the recipe much.  
A very good cookie, I will be making them again- this is the 4th recipe I've tried on the site, and this is the best so far!

This recipe was great!  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips.  Everything else I kept the same.  Will definitely make these again

Amazing recipe. First time giving this recipe a try as last winter the store had run out of rolled oats. I eyeballed the spices...as I love cinnamon naturally I added more + nutmeg. These came out fantastic but I also read a few reviews for some helpful pointers. Soaking the raisins & allowing the butter to soften to room temperature are a noted few. I definitely will make again.

They came to 5 stars with a little tweaking.  Following other reviewers advice I added 2  tsp cinnamon an 1/4 tsp allspice. I didn't  need an extra egg, the consistency was fine.

I have made these cookies several time with no adjustments and they turn out fabulous each time. As another suggested let the butter soften naturally, also be sure to sift the dry ingredients together.  Follow the steps in order and mix with your hands at the end. So often people just throw all the ingredients together disregarding the directions. This is the only oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I will ever use!

I read several reviews before making this recipe. I followed the reviewers recommendations. I used 4 large eggs, 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of baking soda. 1/2 tsp salt. 2 tsp cinnamon and 2 tsp nutmeg. i soaked the raisins in the egg mixture for 45 mins - next time i will leave it overnight as the raisins weren't plum enough for me. Plus i would increase the raisins - not enough for me. I omitted the nuts as I had just made another cookie a week ago that already had nuts in it. Depending on the texture i would add more quick oats to get right texture. After spooning the batter on the cookie sheet i put the tray in the fridge for 10 mins or so, which helped big time with the cookie keeping its form and not going flat as others said it did. The cookies were soft but really needed more raisin or the nuts. Makes a huge batch too.

Only thing I changed in the recipe was adding 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 C mini chocolate chip morsels and 1/4 tsp. cardamon.  Have made this recipe several times and it is consistent and delicious.  The cookies don't flatten out, but remain thickish and are a little crunchy just like I like them.  Softer cookie, just cook a little less time in the oven.

I loved this recipe. I tried it and the cookies were wonderful. I think that the soaking of the raisins really helped to add that "something special." I would recommend it and I know that I will be trying this again.

Tried this yesterday-first time I ever made oatmeal cookies. Excellent! After reading others' reviews, incorporated the changes of: 4 eggs, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp of baking soda and of powder, doubled the cinnamon, added cloves, nutmeg, allspice. Placing dough in freezer for about one hour, and in-between pans, made handling the dough much easier as it is very sticky. Make sure you don't soak raisins longer than an hour to avoid mush! Made golf-ball sized balls. Cookies were perfect, puffy and stayed that way, and delicious! I used maple-cinnamon-flavored oats for the first batch, and peach-flavored oats for the second batch-yummy. Only problem is that everyone ate them so fast..now I have to make more!

Turned out pretty good. There are very few recipes I won't tweak here or there just to take advantage of different ingredients I have on hand. The only thing I did differently was to use dried cranberries instead of raisins. I doubled up on the pecans because my family really likes them (and because my mom gave me about 20 lbs of pecans). I think soaking the dried fruit before mixing helps make the cookies a little more soft & chewy. Thumbs up from my teenagers!

Awesome cookies. As others, I made a few small changes. I used 4 large eggs, 2 tsp. cinnamon and a shake of all spice. Because my husband doesn't like nuts in anything, I eliminated the pecans - this time - but they will be added next time. I didn't read all the reviews, but I baked mine on air bake pans using my convection setting at 325 degrees for the allotted 10 minutes and allowed them to cool on the pans for 5 minutes before removing to the countertop. Turned out crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The only thing I couldn't figure out is how anyone got 6 dozen out of this recipe. I came up with 42 3" diameter cookies.

UPDATE: 2-9-14. I made another batch of these wonderful cookies. This time I used chopped dried apricots, craisins and pecans and added a dash of cloves along with the cinnamon and allspice. AWESOME once again!! I also forgot to mention that I used C&H "Light" sgugar (sugar & stevia blend). I don't know if this makes a difference in texture and chewiness or not, but I have never made a cookie that keeps its texture and chewiness like these do. I will be printing this recipe and sharing with my kids. They may not have grown up on this recipe, but there's no reason their kids shouldn't. Thank you for a wonderful recipe Gerirein!!!!!

Great cookies! I am not a big cookie fan but I will be for these from now on. Did add 1 extra egg, nutmeg and all spice. The batter was thick enough that I rolled into balls and flattened them a little they came out a perfect circle

These are better than store bought.  Beware though, I could not stop eating them. I followed the recipe exactly (leaving butter out for 1/2 a day) other than substituting walnuts for pecans.  Delicious! Mine were very moist even the next day.

Yum ! This is your classic oatmeal cookie. Crisp edges chewy middles. Some said it was flat mine may have been, but they looked like the traditional oatmeal cookie which is a bit flat I suppose, but still delicious. I added salt and didn't add the nuts.

Really good. Couldn't eat just one. That's the only drawback. As much as I tried. I did use my hands to mix the oatmeal & raisin mixture together. Was a lot easier that way. Everything well mixed together.

Followed recipe exactly and they turned out extremely good.  I normally change most baked recipes, based on my experience and preferences, but I haven't made oatmeal cookies in years, so I was basically starting over in search of a cookie that was somewhat crisp but also chewy.  This recipe was perfect.

Made these yesterday..These are fantastic.I followed recipe EXACTLY but added in ground cloves!!! To me, this sent the cookies over the top for 5 star rating. I rated these 4 stars as the recipe is..BUT add the ground cloves and these are INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!  Also, I rolled mine up in a log and put in freezer for 2 hours before rolling into balls..These will NOT be flat cookies if you do this..I used wax paper to roll..PERFECT BAKERY LOOKING COOKIE

So stinkin delicious! I couldn't stop eating these once out of the oven. The only change I made was that I forgot to add the pecans. Oopsie! I also substituted gluten free all purpose flour, oatmeal, and vanilla for the real stuff due to hubby's allergies and added 1/2 tsp. of extra cinnamon as suggested by other reviews. This cookie recipe is a total nummy of a keeper!   :)

I can't say (like other people here) that these were the best oatmeal cookies on here.  But they were good for "homemade" cookies.  I followed all the instructions to the letter, including the soaking, creaming of butter (at room temp), and other stuff. But I just didn't get the best taste. I consider The Best  to be Otis Spunkmeyer. LOL  But good though...try them out!

I don't eat raisins so I didn't eat these cookies.  I followed the directions to a T and EVERYONE was asking for a copy of it!  I suppose they were good based on the number of "Those cookies were awesome!!" throughout the day. They looked pretty and smelled great!  I may try it with craisins since I'm so anti-raisin. :)

I used the substitution suggestions on this recipe and LOVED the result.
I used 1tsp each of baking soda and baking powder, I also used a bit of salt and I added a bit of nutmeg. Baked the cookies for about 11 minutes and Yum! I did not use the nuts, only because my son isn't a fan. But I think they would be even better with them.

Also, I used whole wheat flour, which I use in all of my baking, and they turned out great and a bit healthier.

Following some other reviewers suggestions I added some extra spices and couple other changes and these cookies had a great flavor. I didn't realize that they would harden as they cooled so I over baked them the first time and they ended up crispy but not burned. Still good just not what I was looking for. Second time I cooked them for way less time and they turned out better. Basically the time it lists is accurate but they won't seem done when you look at them. Pull 'em out anyway if you don't want them crunchy!

Whoa! Tastiest oatmeal raisin cookies ever! I used unsalted butter, let it warm to room temperature (no microwave melting!), used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder, added 1 tsp of salt (due to the unsalted butter), upped the cinnamon to 2 tsp, and added 1/2 tsp each of ground cloves and allspice. Refrigerated the dough for about an hour, and baked at 11 minutes. SO good! Next time I'll try a bit less sugar (they were pretty sweet), and add 1 c of chopped walnuts.

Wonderful cookies, will make again, and again. My cookies were not flat, but I used butter at room temp, and substituted the 1 c white sugar for 1/2 c agave syrup (which is sweeter than sugar and healthier) and I made an adjustment using 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder. I also always add my secret ingred.-nutmeg. 1/4 tsp. I also did not have dark raisins and substituted 1/2 c golden raisins with 1/2 c dried cranberries and added 1/2 c dark choc chips.  Family always love this recipe and occasionally I will add 1/2 c applesauce for added moisture in the summer.

I modified this recipe A LOT, but the modified version turned out great, so I'm sure the original would, too. Here are the changes that I made:
- Substituted 1C peanut butter for the butter (yummm)
- Substituted 1/2C honey for the white sugar 
- Used 2 1/2C whole wheat pastry flour instead of the all-purpose
- Subbed 1/2C dark chocolate chips for the pecans

Because of all of these changes, I had to end up making a pan full of cookie bars instead of individual round cookies. I baked them for about 15 minutes in a 9x13" metal pan. They are DELICIOUS, although a tad on the crumbly side, and I suppose a tiny bit healthier than the original recipe. Definitely calorie dense! One thing that I won't do again is use both cinnamon and chocolate chips. I regretted doing so the minute I realized it. Cinnamon and chocolate are kind of icky together, so if you're going to use chocolate instead of nuts, omit the cinnamon. :)

What a great soft cookie! I used quick oats and substituted 1 cup of flour for whole wheat flour and they turned out great! I didn't use the pecans and thought the cookies were a little sweet for my taste. Next time I will try using a little less sugar and adding an extra cup of raisins.
I also followed other reviewers suggestions of using 4 large eggs and mixing the dough by hand when adding the oats. For the other mixing steps I used my hand mixer and it went well. I baked them using parchment paper and let the cookies cool a little before removing to avoid breaking them.
By dropping the dough in teaspoonfuls, this recipe yielded almost double the 36 servings indicated!

YUM! I loved these! I followed a few suggestions, 4 eggs instead of 3, 1tsp baking soda and baking powder rather than just 2 of the soda, 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp all spice. I put them right on the baking sheet, no parchment paper or anything. A little flat? Yeah a little, but it's an oatmeal raisin cookie, I didn't want a cake like cookie anyways, they were delish!

Good base recipe.
Mixed the ingredients as directed. My modificaations were due to reading other reviews and my taste. Soaking the raisins is a MUST!  Next I used 1 cup oat flour, 1 cup wheat flour, and 1/2 cup white flour(just healthier). Also changed to 1/2 tsp of soda, 1/2 tsp baking powder and 2 tsp salt(to help rise). To the flour mixture I used 2 Tbsp cinnamon and 1/2 tbsp of cloves(for more flavor). To the creamed butter I added 1 Tbsp of Vanilla, 2 Tbsp of Maple syrup and 1 egg. I ommitted the nuts and increased the raisins to 2 cups. Baked 12 minutes at 325. Let them cool for 2 min on the cookies sheet, them move them to a cooling rack to cool completely. They will crumble while hot, but pretty presentaton when completely cool.
Without  the extra spice, these would be pretty bland, I think.  But you can decided.
But they ended up most and chewy, just what I was looking for. 
I gave it 3 stars, but with my changes, it gets 41/2.
Yum.... enjoy

Absolutely fantastic!  I will definitely make these again; I did use half raisins and half dried cranberries (only because I only had two snack boxes of raisins).  Great!

I have not made Oatmeal cookies since I was a teenager.  This is a good recipe however I added 1/3 cup more white sugar and reduced the flour by 1/3 cup.  Also I added cranberries and pecans. Everyone loved them!  Tasted great, but did not give you a guilty feeling of eating something sweet.

Fantastic! My only modification was to omit the pecans. I'm not usually a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies, but these are the exception. I agree with other reviewers; probably the soaking of the raisins that sets this one apart. I also like the cinnamon; it's just right.

Great recipe but I think they're a little to floury, I like more oats in the cookies so I'm going to try it next time with 1 1/2 cups flour instead of 2 1/2 cups.

Well these cookies were the bomb.  Instead of raisins I used cranberries. I too added extra cinn and some all spice.  They were not flat and I even made super size cookies.  The flavor is great and I will make these often

These are great!  My boys and I made these in Colorado, and they didn't melt into puddles like other oatmeal raisin recipes we've tried.  We added salt, subbed walnuts, and thought  it could us a little nutmeg, but they were yummy!

THESE are AMAZING! I kept them in the oven for 2 extra minutes then promptly took them off the cookie sheet. So gloriously crispy on the outside with just a perfect tad of chewy in the middle. NEW STAPLE O&R recipe for sure. I also used rum soaked raisins for fun :) I dont think it altered the taste at all tho.

This is the most perfect Oatmeal Raisin recipe you will ever have. To make them less fattening, I have substituted "I can't believe it's not butter" baking sticks and egg beaters. They turn out perfectly chewy and delicious every time!

these are great! To keep them from getting too flat, after you mix up the batter, cover and put in the fridge for 20-30 minutes.  Then they won't spread as much on the pan but still cook perfectly.  Delicious, thank you!

I have now won 2 cookie contests with these using this recipe minus pecans plus 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and plus 1 egg at stir in time.  I also usually do more like 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. I like them best when they are just a hair underdone!
Great cookie!

I replaced the butter with 3/4 cup light olive oil, decreased the flour to 2 cups, used 1 tsp baking soda & 1 tsp baking powder, and added a splash of milk to help all the oats better incorporate into the dough. I used a medium cookie scoop to portion the cookies out onto the baking sheet and then flattened the cookies a bit before putting them in the oven. They turned out moist and chewy- perfect!

The raisins would taste better soaked in RUM!  Also, if you do not chill the dough before baking, they will spread way too thin!

I know theres lots of reviews on this one, but WOW! I dont consider myself a good baker, but I think Ive outdone myself. 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp rum extract, 1/2 cup butter w 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco and the change to 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp powder only changes. AWESOME! THANK YOU! I only used the mixer to cream butter and sugar, rest I mixed with my hand, kinda like making meatloaf! Suggestions to this one were so helpful.

I can't figure out what I did wrong.  The only thing I did differently was cut the sugars in half.  The dough was very crumbly and did not flatten out so I have cookie balls.  The next batch I put in the oven I tried to flatten first but it was very difficult because the dough was so crumbly.  Hmmm...

Just took the first batch out of the oven. So tasty, especially while they're still warm! I followed the recipe exactly and I think they are delicious as is. Slight crunch on the outside but still tender on the inside. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe but I don't know why the dough was hard to get to stick together, but I made 24 cookies and although they TASTED great even after baking and cooling they kept falling apart plus they were flat. I don't know why. I know that the dough was a bit dry and I added just a small amt of water. So I just don't understand they just didn't hold together.

This was a good cookie.  With fabulous flavor.  I just wish it had fluffed up some.  I did 1 tsp baking soda & 1 tsp baking poweder.  I added @ 1/4 tsp apple pie spice.  Soaking the raisins was absolutely brilliant!  I will bake again.

Absolutely perfect. Literally THE best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. EVER. No changes needed (other than using organic ingredients), I followed the recipe exact. This is now my new oatmeal cookie recipe.

I made these tonight with the suggestions I read in other reviews.  I added more cinnamon, added cloves, added an egg, added a little salt, and used 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1 teaspoon baking soda.  With these adjustments there cookies are amazing.  Oh and do not skip the soaking of the raisins in the egg.

Great recipe.  Made a few additions including soaking the raisins in rum.  Also added about a 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and a dash of cloves.  Substituted walnuts for pecans and added 1/3 cup of semi-sweet mini morsels.  These cookies are oh so good!

Awesome recipe. I'm really new to baking and I wasn't quite sure what to expect or whether I was on the right track. I read Jeniffer's comment, which was really helpful.  They came out great.  After some test runs I decided I had to bake them 1 minute longer and at 200C instead of 175C, but that's probably my oven. They came out really soft but well cooked and after some cooling they were really firm and crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I ended up using baking powder instead of baking soda and walnuts instead of pecans. I didn't have much walnuts left over so I had much less than one cup. Don't be skimpy with those nuts, because every bite with walnut is a delight.

WOW! I am a HUGE oatmeal raisin cookie fan, and have been searching and searching for the perfect recipe, and this is definitely it. The flavor of these soft chewy cookies is a rich, buttery, brown sugar flavor---exactly what I was looking for. I followed the recipe exactly and made no changes. It was wonderful. My search for an oatmeal raisin cookie recipe is FINALLY over!

I read the reviews and made sure my butter wasn't too warm and my baking soda was new but my cookies were still too flat for me.  Just average nothing special.  With such a good rating I was surprised.

These are excellent.  Ok here's what I did.  I followed the other reviewers advice and used 1 tsp. baking soda and 1 tsp. baking powder.  I used 1 stick of butter and 1 stick of margarine.  I also chopped the raisins before adding to the egg (to disguise them from some family members). I didn't have any nuts so subbed mini chocolate chips, (helps with the disguised raisins lol).  I chilled the dough for an hour.  First batch was beautiful at 9 minutes. After sampling one I felt it was missing something so I added a pinch of salt to the remaining dough.  I did noticed the 3rd dozen wasn't rising as much as the first so I put the dough back in the fridge for about a half hour and things great after that.  So I would suggest keeping the dough cold between batches.  Great recipe tho, will be making these again.

I made these cookies for the second time two nights ago and these are the best oatmeal cookies ever!! I didn't soak the raisins the first time, but tried it this time and I noticed a slightly more flavorful cookie, not a huge difference. I even softened my butter in the microwave. The cookies were a little flat, but it doesn't matter when they taste so good! This will be my only oatmeal cookie recipe! Thank you for the great recipe GERIREIN!!

Just what I was looking for.  My cookies came out soft, chewy, and substantial enough they did not spread thin like other recipes I have tried.  Like other reviewers suggested I made sure to let the butter reach room temperature instead of  microwaving and substituted one teaspoon of the baking soda for baking powder.  I also doubled the cinnamon for more flavor.  I mixed the dough without a mixer and actually used my hands when it came time to incorporate the oats and eggs.  I think this may have helped to minimize spread.  Delicious cookies!  My family loved them.

Great recipe! I just added some maraschino cherries into it. I added the juice to the egg& raisin mix and chopped up the actual cherries adding the diced cherries after you mix the raisin/egg/cherry juice mixture in with everything else.

I cannot tell you how wonderful these cookies are.  This was my first time (at 41) making homemade cookies.  I caught my son trying to sneak them several times.  My mother declares they're the best she ever had and my boyfriend has almost eaten himself into a cookie coma.  Wow!!!  I also agree with the others that have suggested adding salt.  It definitely works.  I also did not worry about having the rolled oats.  I have a small coffee grinder.  I just put my regular old fashioned oats (not quick cooking) in the grinder for about 1/2 a second and the results were great.  I also added flax seed and macedamian nuts to the recipe.  Wonderful recipe!!!

These are the absolute best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever baked.  The soaking the raisins is something that that you shouldn't skip. They get so plump and make the cookies what they are.  The only change I have made was adding extra cinnamon.  This of course is a personal preference of my family.  One thing to definately remember is to ALWAYS let your butter soften at room temperature. Trying to rush it by putting it in the microwave is going to result in flat cookies every time!! Thanks for the recipe its a keeper!!

Terrific recipe. I have made these at least 6 or 7 times at this point and they always come out amazing. My suggestions..... i do not add pecans because some people dont like nuts... but I bet that would be fabulous. Be sure not to over bake these. I may have taken them out a minute or two before the time said and the were well baked but remained soft and chewy instead of crispy. I also used vanilla rum instead of vanilla just because I had it and thought it would be good. TRY THESES COOKIES!! You will be glad you did!

These, by far, were the most amazing oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever had. They come together easily and turned out perfect!! I agree that soaking the raisins is the key!!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

** I just made these again, but used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Soaked them just like the raisins and added white chocolate chips in. Another great variation to this top notch recipe** 

I finally found the perfect Oatmeal Raisin Cookie! I have been trying several recipes for years and this is it! The only change I made was to add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon. My family loves cinnamon. They were crispy around the edges and soft in the middle. I was able to mix the ingredients in my KitchenAid mixer. Thanks for a great recipe! **9/3/10, I wanted to add that you can freeze the dough into balls and freeze on a cookie sheet, drop into a sealable freezer bag and bake when you want . It is just as delicious this way. With just two of us, I make the recipe, freeze and bake a dozen at a time.**

Delicious! mmm some of the best cookies I have ever had, even from the bakery.  I changes the recipe alittle to 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder to prevent flat cookies! It worked great, i also lowered the amount of oats by taking out around 1/4 of a cup. They came of great! Try them you will not regret it. Thanks for the recipe...will make again!

I gotten rave reviews.  I did alter the recipe slightly by adding 1 additional egg and another 1/2 cup flour.  For those who found this dough tough to work with, a 1/2 hour chill in the fridge takes some of the stickiness away.  Also, I as some reviewers mentioned, adding nutmeg and allspice really gives this cookie some umph (but only add if you like those spices).

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! I actually soak my raisins in a bit of coconut rum the night before and then in the egg mixture. You can drain the rum or just toss it all in! I call them my punch drunk raisin oatmeal yummy cookies! BEWARE - your friends will either be obsessed and hound you for more cookies OR they will hate you because they are waaaaaaaay off their diets!  P.S. Mixing with your hands is better with this recipe! I added an extra egg once - NEVER AGAIN!!! Leave it to 3.

I plan to make this my standing recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies.  I tweaked the recipe just a little and the cookies were outstanding....doubled the amount of raisins and soaked them in rum for a couple hours, discarded the juice before adding to dough.  I mixed in 4 large eggs after creaming butter and sugar which give the cookie that chewy texture.  Also I found that adding 1/2 tsp. of salt and another teaspoon of cinnamon gave the cookies more flavor and used 1/2 regular oats and 1/2 quick cooking oats.  Adding 1/2 cup coconut made the cookies even more chewy and moist.  My husband LOVED this recipe. Thank you so much for posting.  Would rate 10 stars if I could.

With a little tweaking, you can make these VERY healthy. Switch out the butter for EVOO. Add two egg whites for every egg, add a pinch of salt and you've got yourself a healthy cookie. Switch out raisins for dried cranberries and pecans for walnuts for a change of pace.

These are the BEST oatmeal raisin cookies.  Have been making this recipe for years.  I always soak the rainins overnight in the eggs and vanilla.  They are plump and perfect for the cookies. I always freeze half the dough for later.  Frankly, we would end up eating the whole batch if I didn't.  Yes, they are THAT GOOD.

These were really, really good.  Soaking the raisins keeps them moist and chewy days after baking.

Pretty good cookie.  I followed the recommended changes with 4 eggs, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, and added allspice.  I did half of the recipe with the added spice and half without, the half with was WAY better!  Thanks for a good recipe!

The cookies are delish but I made a few changes/additions. I substituted butter with Parkay and let it reach room temp before mixing it with the other ingredients. Since I prefer a spicier cookie, I also added 1/2 tsp of ground cloves, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, and 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg. As mentioned in other reviews, I used 4 large eggs. The only con I found with this recipe was that the cookies came out too soft, even though I kept them in the oven for another 10 minutes. They're definitely chewy but a little too moist for my taste.

This is a great cookie.  Amazing how soaking the raisins make them so much better. I cut the sugar in half and used 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white flour.  My husband loves them -- and he doesn't like sweets!  I'm making them again today for the second time.

The best.  I like to form the cookies then freeze half of them.  Then you thaw for a few minutes on the sheet and bake normally.    In my experience these do not spread much, so unless you want big round cookies be sure to flatten them out a bit before baking.

Far and away the very BEST oatmeal raisin cookie recipe!!!  Found this recipe in a cookbook a couple of years ago and then lost it.  So glad I found it again here!!
One note, I have found that it needs just a dash of salt to really bring out the flavor.

This is a gourmet cookie!  I went with some of the other reviewers' suggestions and added a tsp. of baking soda and baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. The reviewer who mentioned checking the expiration on the baking soda was right on! Even though I do alot of baking, my baking soda was expired.  I even added chocolate chips and baked at 375 instead of 350.  I made these cookies larger and watched them until they were ready to take out of the oven.  It's important to let them cool before handling so they won't crumble. Thank you for a great recipe!

This cookie was a hit at Thanksgiving with my family and friends! The only change I made was I used cranberries instead of raisins. Even my family/friends that did not like oatmeal or cranberries ate these cookies!

I made these cookies for my fiancee'. She loves Oatmeal cookies however I don't really care for them. They came out just great. They stayed soft and chewy even after cooled a couple of days later. They where very good, I even at some.

I read about 50 reviews on this cookie before I decided to make it. I was very excited because I had been craving oatmeal raisin cookies alllll day! Soaking the raisins definitely made them plump and juicy, but aside from that, these cookies were just ok. They definitely didn't satisfy my craving for a gooey starbucks-like oatmeal raisin cookie. The only change I made to the recipe was that I used 1 cup of applesauce instead of butter, which is something I do with many other recipes. (It is a more healthy option.) These cookies were just too fluffy. In fact, some of my friends referred to them as "muffies" instead of cookies.... So if that's what you're looking for, go for it. :)

This recipe was a big hit, I added a dash more cinnamon and a little nutmeg.  They were to die for.

This is the most outstanding oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever made (and boy have I made plenty!)  I totally agree that the soaking of the raisin in the egg made this one stand SO far apart from any other recipe, that I don't think I'll look ever again for the perfect cookie recipe!  Every one gobbled these down in no time and asked for more!  Thank you so much for posting this terrific cookie recipe!!!

I use this recipe often.  I find that there doesn't seem to be enough flour though.  It's important not to overmix because The flour (and also baking powder make sure it's not expired) help the cookies rise.  I try to make a point to mix just enough so that the dough is still a little floury.  The stuff in flour to make the cookies rise doesn't work if it's mixed in too well.

YUM! These were fantastic! Made more than the recipe states. I think I got around 60 cookies. Used a very generous heaping of pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon. Everyone up here at work loved them!

I love the idea of soaking the raisins in the egg and vanilla. At the same time I do this I also set out the butter so it's at room temp when I'm ready to bake.

Whoever created this recipe is a genius! Pre-soaking those raisins keeps these oatmeal cookie from being dry. For extra plumpness and goodness, use organic raisins. (You'll probably need to chop them up as they are so big and flavorful.)

These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had. The soaking really must make a difference with the raisins. I made a few changes: added 1/2 t additional cinnamon; no white or brown sugar, just 1 1/2 c evaporated cane juice + 2 T molasses; added 1/4 t salt; omitted pecans because of allergy. 
Fantastic. Still a little sweet for my personal taste, I'll reduce the sugar next time, but wonderful still.

Outstanding!  Just made today, and I can't imagine what the "1 star" reviewer did, this was easy and worked perfectly.  I needed to bake them for about 13 mins rather than 10, but otherwise no problems.  Thanks, great recipe!

The best recipe for oatmeal cookies I have ever made. My daughter tried one and her reaction was great.  She said it was the best cookie she ever tasted and she said they were the bomb.  I used walnuts instead of pecans and added 1/2 of ground clove.  Great recipe.  I have made them twice in this past week.  Thanks

These are definitely the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever had!  They are my favorite kind of cookie, so I've made and tasted plenty of different recipes.  The thing that caught my eye about this one was the secret of soaking the raisins - BRILLIANT!  These cookies were soft and chewy and SO FLAVORFUL!  I'll never try another recipe again!

Very good.  I just mixed as directed, with cold butter fresh from the refrigerator, baked for about 7-8 minutes and let cool quite a bit before removing from my baking stones.  Inbetween batches, I kept the dough in the refrigerator to keep it cold. They turned out delicious.

These are excellent!  The first time I made them, I soaked them too long (hours) and some of the flavor left the raisins. Other recipies suggest bringing the raisins to a boil, but that adds too much liquid.  These were great for taste and texture. 
A real keeper - Thank you.

These were by far the best cookies I have ever made, I can't bake and these were foolproof.  Everyone raved about them and I even devoured them (although I had previously thought I despised oatmeal raisin cookies).  Make these and you will be a rockstar too!

Delicious and one of my favorite cookie recipes. I also did the 1/2 and 1/2 for the baking soda and baking powder and they turned out perfect. The only "problem" is that it's difficult to stop eating them.

I think this is the best oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I've tried. They've never been a favorite cookie of mine, but I think this recipe changed that. Hubby loved them, too.

This was probably the best cinnamon raisin cookie I've ever made.  I threw in a little baking powder, cut down on the white sugar and substituted that portion with more brown sugar and added more cinnamon. mm delicious!

Yum!  These are great…we can’t stop eating them.  We just moved to Denver and I’m experimenting with this new high-altitude cooking: I ended up adding an egg, 5 tablespoons of milk, and raising the oven temp. to 370.  I baked them just under 10 minutes and they turned out very soft and chewy.  I will be making these again – but adding more raisins next time!

I thought these cookies were good, but they didn't seem to have the flavor I was expecting for some reason. I had to add an egg and 2 Tbsp of milk as the mix was too dry. They came out very moist and chewy and I really loved that!

Pretty good-not spicy enough for us.  I should have added some cloves and more cinnamon.  Makes a lot of dough.  Watch them and don't over bake as they spread and brown quickly.

We loved these cookeies! I had bought some "baking raisins" on sale that are supposed to be already moistened, so I didn't soak the raisins that long (30 minutes). The cookies came out delicious and were a  nice treat for my husband.

These were alright. Nice aroma. Would've liked the cookies to have a crunchy outside. I reduced the recipe to 12 cookies, omitted the white sugar, and reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. It was just the right sweetness. Also left out the nuts. My dough was quite sticky. It may've been because I used less sugar and I made sure to use completely softened butter. I left it out for as long as the raisn-egg mixture sat.

This is a very good base but it needs some work. I had to add 2 T of milk to the dough because it was too dry to even hold together enough to even drop on to a cookie sheet. My husband said there was too much sugar. I have a sweet tooth, so it didn't bother me but it might be something to cut back on if you don't like things too sweet. I also made a batch with Craisins and that was a great variation.

The best oatmeal raisin cookies ever!  I had received a similar recipe 10 years ago and couldn't find it when I was craving oatmeal raisin cookies. The secret is soaking the raisins.  You won't be disappointed!

Wow!  This is absolutely the best recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies! Soaking the raisins and adding the pecans really make these cookies stand out.  In addition to tasting great, they're moist and chewey!  Thank you Geri!

I changed this recipe to 72 servings, so perhaps it was part of the problem, but the mixture was very dry - too dry too mix up, so I added a bit of warm water to moisten.  Then they were great!  (they did spread a bit because of the water)

Awesome cookies, I left out the pecans, I refrigerated the mixture between each batch so they would not go too flat, I also put 2-3 more raisins on top of each dollop before putting in the oven as I think it looks better to see the raisins when they are done. I might just double the raisins to two cups next time and see what happens as like I said I left out the nuts anyway. I used the pin head/steel cut course grain oat meal rather than rolled oats, this makes the cookie more chewy! rolled oats gives a less chewy cookie and easy/quick oats even lesser chewy!! my sis said she liked them but to maybe put a little mixed spice in as well as the cinnamon!! we'll see.
As this mix was sooo dry when trying to combine the ingredients I mixed it with my hands, this meant the butter and sugar warmed ever so slightly and made it alot easier to combine.
23/8/05 update, I may use half the sugars to half cups next time instead of cups too as 2 cups of raisins will make these cookies sweet enough and will also make them alot healthier, I will let you know what happens. With such goodness of oatmeal that lowers cholesterol etc and the raisins I think lowering the amount of sugar is a good idea.

The texture was perfect.  Not chewy but not crunchy.  I agree somewhat that the oatmeal taste was not as apparent.  So I added 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp extra cinnamon.  This helped and didn't make the cookies taste cinnamony.  I also substituted 1 cup of GRANULAR Splenda for the 1 cup of sugar.  My family loved them and had no clue.  I even asked my husband if he noticed and said he just thought the cookies were really good.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is the best one I have tried yet!

I soaked the raisins in hot water until softened and then added as usual.  I did not wait any more time.  The cookies baked nice and puffy.  They did not turn out flat as a pancake.  I was concerned, as I have had this trouble with butter in cookie recipes before.  People at work loved them.  Will make again and again.

My 11 year old says that these are "the best cookies I've ever tasted" and deems them "heavenly." I didn't even know he knew the word heavenly. Great recipe, and the plump raisins adds to the appearance and taste. These cookies don't flatten out when baked, so you may want to squish them like I did for a flatter cookie.

I had difficulties with this one.  Once I stirred everything together and was supposed to drop onto cookie sheet, my cookie mix was dry like dry oatmeal and wouldn't form into a cookie.  I had to add 4 more tbsp. of butter before it was soft enough to form even though I had followed the directions exactly.  Once I did that, I cooked them and they were fine.

I cut the recipe in half since I’m the only one that likes oatmeal raisin cookies. I added 2 tablespoon chia,hemp and flax seed mix and 1/4 cup omega trail mix (no chocolate pieces). Used gluten free oats and flour, and plant based butter. Turned out amazing protein power cookies.

Great flavor and I will try this recipe again. My husband literally just said these are so excellent they won't be around long.

First attempt at this recipe so I followed it as directed.  All ingredients were at room temperature and I creamed the butter and sugar.  The dough was dry and crumbly so I ended up rolling in to balls as best I could and then rolling the balls in the leftover oatmeal and nuts in the bottom of the bowl. I did 4 different bakes as the first came out flat and under baked in the middle.  I chilled the dough after the first bake and did a 2nd bake at 335 for 10 minutes, a 3rd bake at 350 for 8 minutes , and a final bake at 325 on convection.  I slightly flattened the balls with a spatula before baking.  3rd bake was the best.
Next time I will use that 4th egg as others suggested.  
And I found the cookie a tad sweet so may try cutting the sugar.
I used old-fashioned oats but quick cooking probably would be better.  Posted pictures is my 4 bakes from left to right.

I used 4 large eggs. The next time I will add the flour mixture a little at a time. It was difficult mixing it completely adding it all at once.  I used 1tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda. Even with a gloved hand it wasn’t easy to mix the dough. Besides that, it was a hit. I baked the first batch for 10 min. The second and third batch for 15 min because I wanted them browner. They were soft and delicious. I will definitely make them again.

Came out just perfect! We left out the pecans (we don’t like them) and our butter was presoftened so they didn’t come out flat not puffy. Just right.

Turned out very well! I did use 2 teaspoons cinnamon as suggested and about a tablespoon of vanilla. Otherwise, followed the recipe. They took about 3-5 additional minutes to cook.

Outstanding cookies.  I think GERIREIN may be right: the secret IS the soaking of the raisins.  Most cookies I make like this one have a moisture problem, and after making these, I think the raisins were the problem--sucking the moisture out of the surrounding dough and not baking quite evenly as a result.  These were addictive.

A good base recipe. I like to soak the raisins for 10 minutes in warm waster. Drain and dry the raisins before adding them to the mix. I also like to add 1/8 tsp of ginger and 1/2 tsp ground cloves for better flavor. Don't over mix, warm the butter to room temperature and cook until you determine they are done. Elevation, humidity and time of year factor in to cook time. Good luck!

The only thing I would recommend...SOAK THE RAISINS! This recipe is super easy! I added a half cup of raisins to the original, but that’s it. Super chewy and absolutely yummy!

Not patting myself too much on the back- but I am an experienced baker who works doing this professionally. This is my very first one-star review. Prepared exactly to recipe specs I got a ridiculous mess. Other reviewers recommended softening the butter (not indicated), adding baking powder (not indicated). I should have read them first. Wasted client ingredients. What a shame. (On the other hand- if you don’t make them in the oven- the dough tastes fine.)

I knew these would flatten out because the dough was so loose. I added one extra cup of oats! Worked great, stiffened it up and made nicely shaped cookies. Also used four eggs, 2 tsp baking soda, and added heath chips so they are like blondies. Presoaked the raisins as well for just a few mins in hot water.

Added 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips. Were not as crisp as I liked, only baked one pan and froze remaining dough flattened on parchment paper. I will make them a little larger and bake crisper and they will be awesome.

These were fabulously soft cookies!  The only changes I made was adding some nutmeg & cloves per other reviewers suggestions, otherwise I followed everything else exactly.  I made the cookies using a teaspoon but found them too small so I ended up making my cookies slightly larger towards the end of the batch (I did a full heaping rounded teaspoon plus a little more for good measure), but still baked them for 10 minutes so they'd be soft & chewy in the center.  This recipe was exactly what I was looking for & will be using again and again.

I took the suggestions of all the folks in the reviews. (Extra egg, less white sugar, baking powder, etc.) and came out with possibly the worst cookies I have ever tasted. I will try this recipe again as written then I can give it a proper star rating. For now I will give it three stars, as it is written, as it closely resembles my recipe for chocolate chip cookies which is a family favourite.

absolutely the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had. they turned out soft and tasty. I loved the idea to soak the raisins, it plumped them up nicely. I did use 4 eggs and I'm glad I did otherwise the dough would have been a little too dry.

This is the worst recipe I have ever used to make oatmeal raisin cookies. I have tried everything I know to make these turn out. I’ve even tried melting the butter. But the dry ingredients out do the wet way too much. Every time I try this recipe it doesn’t work.

Wow! This recipe is fantastic! My cookies raised perfectly, and the taste is truly the best. Here is what I did. I used butter that was just soft enough to beat, but still really firm. I didn’t use baking soda at all, but used baking powder. I doubled the cinnamon, and added a touch more flour. They didn’t run at all. They puffed right up, and 10 minutes is perfect. I let them cool on the cookie sheet, on cooking racks a little longer than I do with other cookies. Probably 5 minutes, then transferred to rack. This is a perfect cookie.

Only chg was a bit of nutmeg and walnuts instead of pecans, lots of them.  This recipe is a keeper.  So glad I tried them.  They were eaten as fast as they came out of the oven.  Making them again today but in the near future I'm going to experiment with some dried fruit like cranberries or candied pineapple.  Apricots would go well too.  So glad I found this. THANK YOU!
UPDATE:  It's 2 weeks later.  Family asked me to make another batch.  Maybe because I'm adding a lot of walnuts and raisins, I'm getting at least 5 dozen cookies per batch.  My girlfriend is going thru cancer treatments and hasn't wanted to eat anything.  Last night I gave her about half the batch any she ate the whole thing for dinner last night.  We met for lunch today and she had the last 2 cookies with her to snack on.  Hope these are healthy!

These got rave reviews from many friends and family.  Do think I’ll try adding baking powder.  That being said the flatness was okay with me.

These turned out great! They are very flavorful. I used unsalted butter so I added a 1/2 teaspoon salt, otherwise I followed the recipe as planned. It seems like a lot of sugar so if I made them next time I’d decrease the sugar a bit. Overall they are excellent!

The cookies came out really well.  I made a double batch because the recipe didn't say the number of cookies, just the number of servings and no mention of the number of cookies in a serving.  Doubling the recipe made a LOT of cookies.

Delicious if I say so myself. I made a few modifications/additions.                                                                Modifications: 1 minute quick oats, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (I ran out)        Used Baking powder instead of soda              Added 1tsp of cloves            Added 1tsp of all spice           Be sure to let the butter sit at room temp for 1 hour while the raisin, egg, vanilla sit                  I ground glazed pecans instead of using the whole/chopped nut. I think the glazed pecan made up the missing vanilla.

Very easy and super fast cookies to make. I followed the directions exactly except subbed 1 cup of white whole wheat for 1 cup of all purpose flour and added an extra 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. I was a little worried that the cookies would be dry because the dough was on the dry side but they turned out great! Baked for 9 minutes on parchment on waffle bottom cookie sheets.

I wanted an oatmeal cookies that would spread and not clump. These were perfect. They were bendable with a snap. Not too hard or soft, just right. Everyone loved them and I have replaced my old recipe with this one.... Very satisfied. Will try this with dried cranberries and cherries...

I have made this recipe before, and couldn’t find it today. I then made another recipe.   I finally found this one again but I had already made the other cookies.   They didn’t even come close to these. I am now going to print this recipe out because it is the best one out there. My absolute favorite.

I have made these both as written and as a diabetic snack for my husband using truvia and Splenda blend brown sugar. Just remember that when measuring the brown sugar, you must use only 1/2 the amount of Splenda brown sugar so 1 cup brown sugar equals 1/2 cup of the Splenda blend. Also, when making the diabetic version, I flattened the cookies slightly before baking them as they do not spread out as well as the regular cookies. Both versions are awesome !

Very disappointed.....Mine came out extremely flat. I had a very hard time getting them off the cookie sheet and most of them broke because they were so thin. Not sure why. I followed the recipe exactly. I  put the last batch in the refrigerator so I'll see if they are any better. They do have good flavor though.

This is the best recipe. I used a cup of golden and a cup of regular raisins. TIP! If you’re getting flat cookies is because you’re not chilling the dough. I ALWAYS bake cookies after being in the freezer for at least 30 minutes or totally frozen. If the butter is room temp and then you bake, the butter will just melt and spread your cookie out.  Give that a try and see if it works!

Totally totally flat. Butter was room temp, eggs were room temp. I usually refrigerate cookie dough before I bake and I did not so that this time. Maybe that’s would have helped? Regardless, that wasn’t in the instructions. Maybe my soda was old? Don’t know. But they didn’t taste amazing, just average. And flat flat flat.

My family all loved these.  They were soft and fluffy. I used half butter half oil.  The butter was microwaved for a few but wasn’t completely ready. I just put it in the electric mixer and mixed with a cup of the flour then added the rest when the butter chunks mixed in. I added chocolate chips because I didn’t have all the raisins. I also didn’t soak the raisins long enough. About thirty minutes. Can’t get my siblings out of the kitchen long enough to make another batch. My little brother already had two. ????

This recipe is very good, the only thing I changed was step one, I soaked the raisins in boiling water then added the vanilla and eggs to it. I didn't add the pecans. Thanks for the great cookie recipe!

I am giving 4 stars because I don't think the instructions on the actual recipe are complete! I followed the tips from other reviews such as soaking the raisins, I used 4 eggs instead of 3 and I used 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder. Those seem the be the main changes and these cookies were absolutely amazing!! My hubby and kiddos LOVED them! I'm making my second batch in 2 weeks!

I’m giving this recipe 4 stars because I did make some of the changes recommended in the reviews. I added a 4th egg to the raisin mixture, I added a dash of allspice which I think added a little extra zing, and I did do the 1 tsp. baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder. These tweaks resulted in the perfect oatmeal raisin cookie! I always use parchment for cookie baking and I let them sit for the previously recommended 2 minutes on the pan before removing. I’m super happy with them and will make again!

These are excellent!  If you want something a bit different, add 1/4 cup of chopped dates and 3/4 cup of raisins.  it's a great combo.

Very easy recipe to follow. I took someone else’s suggestion in mixed everything at the end with my clean hands versus a spoon or spatula. My cookies did not flatten out at all. They stayed nice and plump. But I use parchment paper on my cookie sheet. My family loves them. These taste fantastic.

I have used this recipe every Christmas for three years! Shout out to the chef! I would note that it doesn't make much difference going half baking powder/soda compared to just baking soda, overall super easy to make, I do double and triple batches to give to my friends/family and they LOVE THEM!!

I generally hate oatmeal raisin cookies. But this recipe!! I took the advice of mixing the dough with my hands, mainly because I didn't feel like cleaning more utensils, and the texture was perfect! Since these are his favorite cookies, I made these for my father for Father's Day! He, and the rest of my family, were obsessed! The amount of cinnamon was perfect and the raisins were actually good! Thank you so much!

These turned out pretty  good! I used 3 tsp of cinnamon and quick oats instead of rolling oats. I used a Tbsp to drop the dough onto the cookie sheet and cooked them for 19 minutes. They were extremely moist. A must make again.

When I made these I replaced the brown and white sugar for raw sugar and coconut sugar to give it a little bit of a different flavor. I put an extra 1/4 cup of raisins in because I like a lot of raisins. I also greased my cookie sheets with coconut oil rather than Pam or baking spray to crisp the bottoms. Mine were definitely not flat, but rather very lumpy because of my added raisins, which I liked. This recipe is a good base for the proportions I think, and easy to change and add what you want.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of baking my cookies about two minutes more than noted.  I was very disappointed in the results as my cookies were very sticky, limp (should have baked them even longer) and were virtually tasteless.  Don't know what went wrong, but will go back to my old standby.

Since this was the first time making these, I made them EXACTLY according to the recipe.  They were fantastic, and I wouldn't make any changes whatsoever!  I didn't add more cinnamon or any other spices, I didn't add salt, I used THREE large eggs, and mixed the dough with the Kitchen Aid mixer.  The only thing I did do differently was rolled them into balls.  I know it's kind of anal, but I like round cookies. LOL!  I ended up with 7-1/2 dozen cookies; since it is only my hubby and I, I cooked 4 dozen (of which 8 disappeared when they came out of the oven) and rolled the rest into balls, placed them on a cookie sheet, froze them, and put them into a gal. Ziploc to use later.  Hubby has been looking for the elusivie perfect oatmeal cookie for some years, and he deemed these absoluely wonderful!

Like many cooks, I just can't leave well enough alone.  I added some 'white morsels' and 'coconut'.  The batter is moist enough to handle the two cups of extras and still come out great.. well, I did add an extra egg.  Well received by all, including myself.

Yes I will retain this recipe and make them again, who knows,  maybe I'll just add another cup or two of raisins!  Also, I'm thinking of trying out that new powdered peanut butter in it.

Excellent recipe! Did not change a thing : ) 

I did use parchment paper on the cookie sheets, because that is just what I do when baking cookies.

I will definitely be making these again, I made them for Christmas gifts and everyone said they were the best cookie they'd ever had, I have to agree. I used the quick oats and they were soft and fluffy.

Awesome cookies. I made them per the recipe. As suggested I stirred the mixture with my hands. It is a stiff batter & that worked well. I sprayed my hands with Pam because the dough kept sticking to them. I skipped using the teaspoon & rolled them into balls. They came out perfectly at 10 minutes. Do not over bake. Husband couldn't stop eating them. KEEPER!

Recipe was a bit wet and cookies were flat. In fact they were so flat that they covered the cookie sheet; evenly enough to cut it like a sheet cake. 
The recipe is good as is for the first batch.  I did change up and added nutmeg and allspice the second time and they were a yuuuge hit.

Wonderful recipe! Just need a bit of advise. When I bake on an unprepared baking sheet, the cookies stick ?? What can I do to prevent this?

These are very good! I change a couple of things; I used 4 large eggs and 2 tsp of cinnamon as per another reviewers recommendation. I also left out the nuts because I didn't have any. Thank you will be making these again!!

I think they'd have been better if I didn't make any changes. They rose too much and weren't very sweet after I used 1tsp powder and 1tsp soda and reduced sugar, as per review suggestions.

Great, chewy cookies.  I underbake just a bit, as usual to make sure they're chewy.  Also, since I don't like the texture of whole raisins, I chop them up before adding them so we still get all the taste and sweetness.

I followed this recipe to the letter and the cookies came out very good. Not flat, not super gooey, but medium. I gave it four stars only because I'm not super crazy about oatmeal raisin and these didn't turn me into a huge fan, but my family members who love oatmeal raisin said they were excellent.

I made a sugar free version of these cookies for a diabetic family member. I used 2 cups of Stevia in place of both sugars. I used four eggs to soak the raisins and was glad I did because the dough was still a little on the dry side. My cookies did not spread well (maybe from the sugar substitute?), but still were tasty. I used 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp all spice. It could have used even a little more cinnamon in my opinion. The cookies are still tasty though. Next time, I will try 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder to see if it makes a difference.

Followed recipe exactly. cookies are flat and have little taste. I thought that 1 cup of raisins was not enough and I was right. won't make this again and not happy that I wasted all those ingredients. Very bland.

Made it twice now, once with quick oats and once with rolled oats.  Way better with quick oats!  They held their shape a little better and seemed more evenly baked. Both times I added 1tsp of rum extract along with the vanilla extract, because that's how I roll. Five stars with quick oats.

This is a good cookie; however, I think it needed a bit more flower or oatmeal.  I will make it again and tweet the receipt a little.  Soaking the raisins was a great idea

The only thing I would recommend to make sure the cookies aren't thin or flat is to put the dough into the fridge for 20 min then they rise just fine. Other than that I think I might add some nutmeg next time as well as cinnamon.

I soaked the raisins in the eggs and vanilla for about an hour before I made the cookies.  My husband raved about these cookies.  Told me to hang onto this recipe!!

Awesome recipe I will save for years to come! First time ever making these cookies and I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect! I did follow one review on cooking them for only 9 minutes they came out a little doughy, which I like soft cookies! Next time il make sure not to make them so big lol no need to change, the recipe is great as is, oh yea I minus the nuts because I like classic oatmeal raisin :-)

I have made these a few times (following the recipe exactly except no nuts) and they are WONDERFUL!  So chewy and soft.  Every time I make them, they get gobbled up and I get millions of compliments.  If you like oatmeal raisin cookies, these are excellent!

There's a common theme to these reviews: the recipe works great if you alter it beyond recognition. I halved the sugars, added an egg, swapped baking soda for powder, and toyed with the spices. Worked for me.

Great cookies! added 1 tsp salt, used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder, cut the white sugar down to 1/2  cup. Left out the cinnamon. Could probably cut the sugar a little bit more. Yum :)

I loved this recipe I have now made it twice. The second time I made it my day was crunched and I left the raisins soaking for 2 hours. To me they tasted even better. I used a medium cookie scoop and 12 minutes in my oven was perfect. I have used the quaker oats cookie recipe for years and this one tops it for sure.

Excellent tasting cookie, better than the one on the oatmeal box.  Makes a lot of cookies, and after three or four days they crumble, so unless you have a large family to enjoy them in a day or two, I suggest cutting the recipe in half.

I only made one change, because I used unsalted butter, so i added 1/2 tsp of salt, but otherwise i followed the recipe exactly...and holy cow.....! These are unreal. Not only do i absolutely love them, but everyone who's tried one says just how good they are. They're chewy and not crumbly which is the key to a good cookie. 

Raisin cookies are probably one of the reasons I have trust issues but when eating these, I can totally get on board with raisins in my baking.  Adding this one to my "favourites!"
Thank you!!

I did not have butter when I first made these, so I used organic coconut oil instead.  They were a BIG HIT at the office and everyone wanted my recipe.  One of the BEST oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever made!

I made this recipe to the T except added craisins and raisins instead. Honestly, these were the fattest (they were about half an inch tall!) and chewiest (is that a word?) cookies I've ever made. Delicious through and through!

Wanted to make these cookies but didn't have raisins, subbed chopped dates. They are wonderful. I'll make them again with raisins like they're supposed to have but I'm equally sure that I'll make them with dates again as well.

My kingdom for a KitchenAid Mixer. By hand, they came out great though. Took the advice, used baking soda and baking powder. Added cloves too. Made the full recipe- rolled half into a log and put it in the fridge for another time. Experimented with different sizes- they were all fine. Crispy on the edges, soft in the middle.  The friend these were made for rated them "Killer".

I made these cookies and they were good. I couldn't give a 5 star because I used butter flavored Crisco. They tasted a little off, even though good, but I think that was because I used the Crisco and not butter as the recipe says. Will try again and use the butter.

These were really good cookies, even my hubby went crazy on them and he is not an oatmeal and raisin fan. I forgot to cover the raisins while soaking, omitted pecans, for no other reason then I did not have any, rolled them like peanut butter balls, b4 putting them on pàrchment paper and cooked them at 340 degrees on convenction oven ( have a hot spot under normal temp) and cooked them for 10 min

I've made these many times. The first time they gave me a tummy ache, and yes I used quick oats. They were so good I decided to try them a second time, the only difference is I soaked the raisins in water instead of the egg - kept the recipe exactly the same but I bake them for 12 mins instead of 10 - perfect and no tummy ache! I make these all the time, my family loves them. Sometimes I throw in a little grated carrot and reduce the baking soda (so the carrot doesn't turn green). Super Yummy!

I made this recipe EXACTLY like the recipe stated. So I will let you know they came out soft and delicious. The did not spread while cooking as I had feared they would because of the butter.  
I am most distressed that people who do not make the recipe as it is written give the recipe a bad review.  The most helpful negative review?????? really had nothing to do with the recipe and more to do with his dislike of other reviews.   Not Cool to give the recipe a bad review when you are giving a personal rant.  Agian..... Great Recipe!!!!!!! Enjoy

I make this recipe every year at Christmas time. I take the cookies to work and they disappear!! I change absolutely nothing! I don't think the cookies are at all flat and find that the recipe is perfect just the way it is. Do make sure the butter and eggs are room temperature and be sure to "cream" the butter and sugars...they should look light and fluffy when creamed. Cook until lightly browned. Do not under cook or they will flatten.

I make these for my sister in law because they are her favorites. That being said this recipe makes them my favorites too - these are so delicious that your normal, these are the saddest chocolate chip cookies people on earth will love them. Pinky promise. No changes. Just as is.

Way too much baking soda. The cookies ended up inedible, even after adding an acid to try to fix the batter. Also, I didn't really see a huge benefit in soaking the raisins, possibly because I put them in the fridge.

I love this recipe "as is" though it never turns out the same way twice... but the cookies still taste wonderful, whether the cookies flatten out too much or not at all.  Tonight I ended up having to use 4 eggs since one of the eggs was rather small, but a previous time using too many eggs led to gooey cookies that tasted great but weren't really a cookie.  Still, I don't usually find it necessary to add any other spices or sub anything in or out, the only change I ever make is how many eggs I use in it.  Simply delicious cookies.  Tonight's batch didn't flatten out at all, but I used cold butter.  After the first batch, we just flattened them with a spatula and that worked fine... though the cookie "balls" were REALLY good!

This is my boyfriend's favorite recipe....definitely the keeper oatmeal raisin cookie recipe! An option that I do from time to time...which makes them a bit better....(I soak a couple of cups of raisins in a canning jar, and cover with Jim Beam bourbon....and store in my cupboard until I need to use in a recipe)...I use half the amount with bourbon soaked raisins...the other half using regular raisins...and soak all together in the egg/vanilla mixture). Yum! But this recipe in its original state is fantastic on its own!!

I made these for my boyfriend and he loved them! I didn't have any nuts so just left those out. I did follow a few modifications:
1. I did 1 tsp baking powder and baking soda. 
2. I soaked the raisons in 3 eggs and then added an egg when I mixed everything together.
3.  I refrigerated the dough over night (makes them much easier to handle). 
4. I also added some all spice, which gave a great aroma. 
I made pretty small cookies and got about 45 out of this recipe. My boyfriend loved them!

These were a huge hit at the office & with the family members! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not "sift" the flour, which didn't matter. I also did not add nuts, but I added chocolate chips & raisins instead. They were SO good! I will definitely use this again in the future.

I also changed the recipe to baking soda rather than powder and also added two teaspoons of cinnamon as well as an extra egg per the advice below. I have three kids and a husband hovering around the kitchen as we speak saying that these are the best oatmeal raisin cookies they've ever had! Thank you for a great recipe and great modifications!! The family gives their seal of approval.

I omitted about 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar instead and cookies turned out great and not to sweet. Overall great recipe! My 16 month old also agrees, which is the reason I omitted some of the sugar ??.

Very tasty. I did add a little ground ginger and, instead of all butter, I used 1/2c canola oil and 1/2c butter. I also used 1/2c raisins with 1/2c dried cranberries, instead of all raisins.

Excellent. Followed it precisely with the addition of salt, a tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp allspice & a dash of nutmeg. Great flavor.  Mixing it by hand? What a disgusting mess. I lost 1/2 the batter between my fingers. Will use a spoon the next time I make these!

My go-to recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies!  Soaking the raisins does something magical to them.  Also, I love a cookie recipe that makes plenty....this fits the bill.  Usually I freeze half (or more) of the dough rolled up and ready to bake.  You can put right into the oven for a softer cookie or set them out to thaw for a few minutes.

I made the cookies today and they are the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever tasted. I omitted the pecans and used 2 cups of raisins instead of 1 and they turned out just great! They are soft and chewy with a wholesome, non rich flavor. 4 doz will go to my neice and her family and the other 2 doz are for me.

I have used this recipe twice, and both times the cookies came out fabulous.   Like one other reviewer advised let the butter go to room temperature naturally to keep the cookies from going flat.  I have also baked them with raisins, and have also substituted with dried cranberries and cherries delicious!

I love a rich chewed cookie, this is that.  Just the right amount of cinnamon.  I modified the sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 cup packed brown.

Just made these. I left out about 2 tablespoons of each sugar. I usually cut back on sugars in all cookie recipes. Jus a preference. This recipes makes about 72 using a #24 scoop. Equivalent to about a generous tablespoon. I baked for 11 min at 350F.

Very nice cookie. Sure to be better one the next day, allowing the flavour to settle in. I set aside enough batter to make 24 cookies and shredded 1/2 an apple (about 1/2 cup packed). II folded that in and scooped out. Baked +2 more minutes. Out of the oven, a slight apple flavour. Sure to be better the next day. My past experience of adding apple to cookies says the cookies will always be soft, actually too soft in a sealed container for our preference. So they can be kept in a container in the cupboard with the lid slightly off. Last about a week like that ... if you don't eat them all first.

Good cookie recipe!!  Made this cookie recipe today and each cookie came out pretty awesome. Soaking the raisins made them plump and super soft, great baking tip. I did add baking powder rather than baking soda and had a fluffy cookie. Also added some nutmeg but won't next time.

A PERFECT oatmeal raisin cookie!  They were still delightfully chewy the next day. The only thing I did different was had 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and 1/8 tsp. of cloves cause I like extra spice. I also left out the pecans as my husband doesn't like nuts.

This is the first time that I have made oatmeal raisin cookies that are better than the ones at the store! The raisins stayed soft and the cookies were the perfect texture. The only changes I make were that I used half butter/half shortening, and as an altitude adjustment I reduced the baking soda to 1 1/2 tsp.

This recipe is more flour than oatmeal making it just so so for us.  I used the Quaker oats old fashion recipe and those were far more chewy and oatmeal flavored.

These cookies are, by far, THE BEST OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIES I have ever made.
I think it has to do with soaking the raisins.
Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!

Excellent recipie!!!  Used 4 eggs as previous notes suggested and switched out white and brown sugar with 1 cup honey and 1/4 cup molasses. Also used 2 cups granola and a 1/2 cup ground oats instead of the 2 cups rolled oats and used half raisins and half cranberrys. Added 1 teaspoon cloves, used almonds instread of pecans and added some coconut.   Baked for 15 minutes and they were perfect.

I found this recipe to be very good though I did make a few adjustments.  I only used 1/2 the butter called for & replaced the rest with 1/2 Cup of unsweetened apple sause. This makes a healthier cookie as well as a more plump one. I also replaced a 1/2 Cup of flour with flax, added 2 tsp. Of cinnamon & omitted the raisins & pecans.  I did not let the eggs stand in the refrigerator.  Turned out wonderful.

I really can't rate these cookies as an original recipe, i changed up the sugar to use splenda brown sugar, added baking powder and used half applesauce for the half the fat. Although these are tasty they are way to cakey for me. I really like them crisp.

These were not as good as I had hoped they would be. With two cups total of sugar I thought they would be sweeter than they were. I actually thought they were kind of bland. I also felt they needed more raisins. Just not what I was expecting I guess.

First try. Loved it. Think the 10 mins is the key to making sure it's not dry and crusty. I used chopped walnuts instead and a little less sugar.

Very good and chewy! I ran out of raisins - so I used Craisins instead.  I also didn't have enough butter so I used some lard. They were still very good! Made about 5 dozen.

I followed some of the suggestions (added an egg, used baking soda and powder, added 1/2 tsp salt, allowed the butter to soften naturally), but added a modification I use with nearly every recipe that includes raisins:  I increased the quantity of raisins by half (in this case, to 1 1/2 cups) and soaked them overnight in brandy.   Obviously, I omitted the Works really well with raisin bread, and it sure tasted good in these cookies!  Any brandy will do, but a fruity one is a plus in cookies or cakes.  The raisins are plump and moist, have a nice flavor, and do not taste "boozy".  The brandy can be reused several times- just add enough to cover the fruit each time.

Yuk! I made these exactly as written. I thought I was going to get a cavity while eating one. WAY too much sugar. WAY too much butter as well. And this is coming from a gourmet cupcake baker. It tasted like I was eating a ball of butter with sugar mixed in. At least the cookies looked great coming out of the oven. If I were to change anything, I would substitute half of the butter with coconut oil or applesauce. Cut the sugars in half like other viewers suggested, 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda and add more spices such as ground clover, ginger, nutmeg and/or allspice.

Okay so if anyone is having flat pancake cookies then you should  probably let the butter soften naturally and let it rest in the fridge while you are baking the ones in the oven.

Made as written except I doubled the cinnamon, and they were good but not outstanding. They need something more. These are like chocolate chip cookies without the chocolate.

I had used all my raisins in mincemeat, but had a bag of slightly dried out prunes.  I chopped the prunes, covered them with boiling water, let them sit for a few minutes then drained and followed the recipe as directed.  My husband took them to work and the guys loved them even commenting on how soft they were.  I asked him if anyone noticed that they weren't raisins.  He said he did not even know they weren't!  These turned out so well, there were requests for more!

Made a batch of these cookies today and everyone loves them.  The only difference from the posted recipe was not adding nuts due to my son's nut allergies.  This recipe is a keeper!

Wow, finally a version that is soft and chewy day after day! I agree with cutting the white sugar down to 1/2 cup, and instead of chopped pecans I put in a cup of sweetened coconut, but otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. I can't recommend these more strongly. Enjoy!

Disclaimer: I made some substitutions.  These cookies came out fluffy & cakey, not flat at all. I replaced half the butter with applesauce. I replaced almost half the flour with almond meal.  I used 1 flax egg. I used only brown sugar & replaced the white sugar with 1/2 c brown rice syrup.  So I guess it's a different cookie all together, but if you're looking to make a healthier oatmeal raisin cookie, this recipe can serve as a good place to start.

Loveeee this recipe! I added chocolate chips rather than pecans-because I'm allergic to nuts! Soaking the raisins made a huge difference! Just delish! I found the dough a little dry so I ended up mixing with my hards-they turned out fabulous!

I used 1 and 1/4 cup white flour and 1 and 1/4 cup whole wheat, added another egg and some chocolate chips, I also used 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder instead of 2 tsp baking soda...the only thing I would do next time is add some nutmeg or more cinnamon! They turned out light and fluffy!!

Recipe is very good. My wife loves oatmeal cookies. I did change it as well by using crasins instead of raisins as well as omit the brown sugar. Still came out sweet enough. I didn't substitute baking soda for baking powder

These cookies are wonderful. I did add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, but other than that I stuck to the recipe exactly. I didn't have any problem with them spreading too flat like some other reviewers wrote. They were a little crunchy on the edges and the middles were soft and chewy. The last 2 batches I actually flatten out a bit and those were the cookies that I liked the best. I thought they were perfect and would definitely make again.

I tried this because of all the reviews but honestly I found it missing something.  So did my DIL.  Maybe missing salt.  It was okay good but still missing some ingredient.

Just tried this recipe.  Did as suggested, soaked the raisins for an hour.  I used coconut instead of the pecans (forgot I didn't have any), used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder, 4 eggs, added 1/2 tsp allspice and pumpkin spice (didn't have ground cloves).  I baked them for 9 minutes.  WONDERFUL!!!!!  Thanks to all those who made the suggestions.  This is a great forum.  Take a great basic recipe make it wonderful. Thanks all!!!!

Absolutely the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever baked and/or eaten. Delicious!  The only slight change I made from the recipe was that my raisins didn't sit in the egg mixture for a whole hour.  More like 20-30 minutes, but still soft and delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made it exactly as calls, awesome! Chewy, full of flavor, doesn't need changing for this recipe. 
I read some previous post, I did let my butter soften naturally, my were flat. Personally, I don't care it shows the texture of the cookie. 
Over all it probably depends on the type of cookie you like, dry crunchy over chewy , or some individuals like using crisco some do not. 
Therefore, the chewy cookie lovers should love.

Flat bland cookies.  The recipe as given here just doesn't work.  I'm an experienced baker and not prone to recipe error.  There are many better oatmeal cookie recipes out there.  Keep looking.

I found them to be only OK. They taste good but are a bit top heavy on the flour. Would prefer more oats and less flour.

These cookies earned 5 stars for flavor, however I was so disappointed that they flattened out during cooking and they stuck to the cookie sheets.  What a waste of my time and ingredients because they look terrible.  I will make these cookies again because they are delicious but I will chill the dough before baking and I will use parchment paper.

I love this recipe. Cookies are gone in a flash! I add 1/4 more flour though. I thought it was just to me using a stand mixer why they are a little flatter. None the less, they tasted great! In the past I have also added white chocolate chips and the cookies are awesome. I personally love nut but I don't add them due to no one else in the house likes that. But they are truly yummy!

Used 1 cup of sugar instead of two and added about a half cup more of oats and extra cinnamon. They were a hit. Great recipe.

My cookies came out fluffy and perfect!!! I soaked the raisins in the egg and vanilla mixture and that made the cookies softer. I also cut back on the amount of white sugar by half a cup. I added half a teaspoon more of cinnamon and sifted 1/4 teaspoon of salt into the dry ingredients. I also used walnuts instead of pecans. I am going to try this recipe again and add 1/2 a cup of dark chocolate chips!

I don't usually rate recipes but this one was so disappointing. I live overseas and oatmeal is hard to come by...I made these as a special treat, going off the great rating and they were not good.  Too much baking soda for one and for two they just didn't have great taste. I was really disappointed and will not make again.

Best cookie recipe ever. After making it so many times I have learned to play with it and add or substitute for whatever mood I'm in. My favorite is subbing craizins for the raisins and walnuts for the pecans. Either way, original or otherwise, it's a family favorite at our house.

The flavor of these were AMAZING.  I did change it quite a bit though so I could use brown spelt flour, used coconut oil instead of butter, used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar . . . only thing is I found it a little too sweet for my tastebuds so I will reduce maybe by 2 TBS (I made only a dozen).  I doubled the cinnamon and omitted the pecans.  It spread out just enough . . so still nice and soft yet crispy on the outside.  My cookies finally look like the picture of a recipe ! !  I am definitely saving this recipe.  THANKS FOR SHARING !!

I have used this recipe 2 or 3 times before and have always been happy with the results! This recipe made me an oatmeal raisin fan, something I never considered myself to be. Prior suggestions have been to increase the amount of cinnamon and add nutmeg, which works great. I also soak the raisins in water that has been nuked for 3 minutes.

Today I did some hippie-dippie modifications to this recipe with great success. I changed to the 24 serving recipe that called for 2 eggs. I substituted one egg for a tablespoon of cold milled flax with 3 tablespoons of warm water. I also added about 5 tablespoons of nutritional yeast flakes to the dry ingredients. There wasn't too much of a yeast-y flavor and the cookies were still rich and moist.

My 2 year old daughter inhales these cookies, so now I feel better about letting her scarf them down with toddler abandon with all the omegas and B vitamins the flax and yeast provides! :)

The soaking of the raisins does make this the best oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever had.  Can't wait to make another batch.  I cut down on the sugar by a third - 2/3 cup brown and 2/3 cup white - because I don't like my cookies quite as sweet as many people.  Other than that, followed the recipe to a T.  Delicious, thanks so much.

These cookies I have made for year.  They are delicious. Perfect flavor and not too spicy or sweet.  They are crispy on the edges but soft in the middle.  They will stay soft for a few days.

These cookies do not stay together. I made them exactly as the recipe said, and they just fall apart. There is just waaaaay too much flour in them. The taste was pretty good, but next time I will use an extra cup of oats and omit one cup of the flour.

Uh, these cookies are BOMB! Gave em four stars because I did add the 1 tsp. baking powder and reduced the baking soda to 1 tsp. Also, just added more raisins instead of the nuts. They are freakin delicious. Throwing my old recipe away!!!

Made as written, except added some shredded coconut for more flavour, and substituted toasted almonds for pecans since that was what I had on hand. I REALLY wanted to love this recipe, but the cookies were little more cakey than I like. Flavour was wonderful, though.

I did this recipe and added some ingredients that I also liked, and was very pleased. What caught may attention about this recipe was the soaking of the raisins. I've never done that before.To me a recipe is just your basic guideline to follow. For those of you who bake often enough, you know you can add or substract certain ingredients as you like, and make any recipe your own, but you need to start from the basics. You can use any dried fruit that you like ie; apples, pineapples, cranberries, cherries, ect. the list goes on. I added coconut because we like it. Imagine that with some other tropical fruits. For the risky, daring people, soak your raisins in wine or liquicor of your choice for an adult treat at your next party event, be sure the kids don't get those ones, alcohol does not cook out as with stovetop cooking. Have fun with it, if you don't like the outcome, throw them away, no one has to know you flopped.

This is my new favorite oatmeal cookie recipe. I doubled the cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp salt since I use unsalted butter. I used quick-cooking oats because I like my oatmeal cookies less poofy. I used a bigger cookie scoop -- it's actually the one I use for meatballs, I really don't know the size, but not that big -- and baked for 17 minutes. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Great recipe. Whoever said the secret is soaking the raisins was right! I only gave it 4 stars because I made the following changes: 4 eggs, 1/2 sugar (in the raw), 1/4 tsp. ground cloves, 1/4 tsp. allspice, and substituted 1 cup krisp rice cereal instead of pecans. Cookies came out slightly sweet and soft. Definitely a keeper!

WOW!!!I made a few mods - chocolate chips instead of nuts and 1 Tbs of cinnamon plus a dash of nutmeg.  My whole family adored these.  The soaking really made a big diff for the raisins as my kid won't normally eat them.  These she said were "awesome"

I made these for my husband who is very picky when it comes to oatmeal raisin cookies and he loves them!  He even told his mom and grandmother that they are better than theirs which is a huge compliment in his family.

Fairly good recipe. However, I followed each step, baked the cookies and then realized something important was missing! The Salt!!! The actual recipe mentions nothing about salt. In all my baking years I have only used UNSALTED butter. This good recipe needs an edit - 1 teaspoon of salt.

NOT a good recipe.  I followed it to a tee and the cookies came out flat, black on bottom.  The flavor is good, but they certainly can't be brought anywhere.  Horrible!  Don't fall for this one.

Awesome recipe! One more good hint is to soak the raisins in the baking soda, spices and butter....and I do melt the butter, let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes to ferment a little, refrigerate until butter stiffens.  Continue with recipe. Use butter and not margarine and rolled oats, not quick cooking as the previous reader suggested.

I made these for my son's baseball banquet and they were a huge hit!  I followed the directions almost exactly.  I did use jumbo eggs, let my butter and eggs come to room temp before starting.  And, once the initial batter was mixed in my stand mixer, I poured it all together in a large bowl and mixed by hand.  I used rolled oats, not instant, and they had a wonderful chewy texture. It worked out perfectly, I will certainly make this recipe again!

These were "ok".  I have to agree with some other raters that the cookies are quite bland, but the texture is great.  This recipe is a good base, but next time I would add 1/2 tsp. salt, another egg, another tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  That might make them have a little more punch.

Best recipe ever!! These are the best cookies!  With the changes I've made, they've become a staple food at my house.  I've edited the recipe to only use dark brown sugar, grind 6 cups of rolled oats into flour and add,  1 to  1 and 1/2 cups of all purpose flour, about a teaspoon allspice and double the raisins and or add cranraisins..  My co-workers adore them and don't feel guilty about eating them.   Next recipe I"ve soaked the raisins in 100 proof spiced  rum for an admittedly not so healthy but tasty "Adult" cookie!

my mom made these cookies and she used only the white sugar because we did not have any brown sugar. she also did not use self- rising flour, but she used un-bleached flour instead. 
she also baked them double the time that the recipe said but they turned out great.
they are the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever!

This is the best cookie recipe I have ever used. I did make some adjustments because I did not have everything. Used three packs of cinnamon spice instant oatmeal, salted butter and omitted the salt. Cookies were soft and chewy. Will not use another recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies.

Amazing recipe i did modify quite a bit though.... for example i only used 2 cups of flower, 2 tab cinnamon, 1/2 of both brown and white sugar, took out the pecans, used 1 tsp baking soda and 1tsp baking power and i added 1 egg ..... ok maybe i did a lot of modifying but they turned out sooooo good and stayed so moist :) to me this one is a keeper

My family and I loved everything about this cookie.  My husband commented, "Wow! These have great flavor." I really believe by soaking the raisins in the vanilla and egg mixture is why these cookies taste so good...Just my opinion.  Thank you for the recipe.

I just made a batch of these. My 4 year old who "doesn't like oatmeal cookies, just chocolate chip" has become a believer!! came back twice. My two year old is whining for another one as we speak. They are very yummy. Perfect. The only modifications that I made was that I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of all spice. Otherwise excellent recipe!

These Cookies are the best in Oatmeal Cookies.  Perfect description of these are moist, chewy, and great with a glass of milk. Not too thin and not too thick.   I like my cookies chewy and bendy and these are exactly on target.    I took to a function last night and  as I picked the container up from the table, several people asked me for my secret ingredient.  It was like they were totally waiting to find the owner of the recipe.  The secret is not in the ingredients but it's  the soaking of raisins and softening of butter.   Butter needs to soften naturally while the raisins are soaking.    I actually used margarine and it turned out fine.  Also, let set on the cookie sheets for a few minutes  to set up before removing.   Oh,  and if you toast the pecans before adding to the recipe, it goes over the top!  Awesome recipe!

I did not have a problem with the taste at all, they were good, however, they were flat like pancakes. I don't know if I overlooked something or if it was because I used steel oats.

I was looking forward to making these cookies because of the high rating. However, after making this recipe, I don't understand the high rating. The ratio of flour to oats is too high and ended up tasting mostly flour. Next time, less flour and more oats. Don't get me wrong, these cookies still ended up getting eaten.

These were incredible!! I followed the recipe the exact way it is and they were so moist and flavorful! I think that soaking the raisins helped to give the cookie that plump feeling. My kids love this recipe.

I didnt have time to make cookies, so I used a 9X13 cake pan baked for 30 min. Very good, chewy, just the way my husband likes his oatmeal raisin cookies! Next time I will leave time to actually make cookies.

I just made these and they are DELICIOUS. I didn't have any nuts on hand...so I can't wait to make them again.  I did add and extra egg because my dough seemed a little dry...but I don't always measure to the "t" so...may have been my fault.

These were awesome. Super chewy. I did add chocolate chips though. Also the first couple batches, although the dough was gooey tasted floury. So I added a bit more cinnamon to the next few and it was perfect!

Omigosh these are good.  I used craisins as I'm not a raisin fan.  I upped the cinnamon a wee bit, and used sliced almonds instead of pecans as that's what I had to hand.  I think the soaking probably does help as it softens the fruit somewhat, however, it's probably equally fine not to soak them too.  Also, I used baking powder instead of soda.

Wow...I just made these.  Reviews that show concern about flat cookies make me nervous.  I actually did what one one of the reviews recommended and split the 1 tsp soda and 1 tsp baking powder, used quaker oats (traditional), and took the risk of microwaving my butter (12 secs only!) and these came out perfectly! By far the best oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I've used to-date.  Being a novice baker I was a little turned off initially about the soaking but man--you'll never go back! I LOVE THESE COOKIES!! Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Very good -- I added some finely smashed up crumbs of Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal (leftover in bag) which add a nice sweet crunch.  Will definitely do that again. I soaked the raisins in hot water instead of eggs, to rinse them. Made them plump up. Kind of sweet, I would use less (white) sugar.

Very nice cookie.  One teaspoon of baking powder is plenty when you have 3 eggs.  I did increase the cinnamon a bit as I always do. Mine did not fall flat at all but if you find that your cookies are falling too flat on your first batch, add a couple of tablespoons of flour to the remaining batter.

I wanted to make these cookies but I was out of oatmeal and sugar. I used 1/2 cup of white splenda and 1/2 cup of brown splenda. I also used one cup of 9-grain cereal instead of oatmeal. The dough was hard to mix because of the 9-grain. They turned out well. My 2 1/2-year-old girl likes them.

Wonderful and amazing!  They are crispy, chewy and moist all at the same time!  I impressed my boyfriend and his mom with these.  I am not a huge oatmeal raisin fan, and I couldn't stop eating them.  I used walnuts instead of pecans. *Update- I've seen bad reviews for these when made as written and a lot of great reviews when they've made lots of changes. I make these with NO CHANGES, except switching out walnuts for pecans sometimes. They come out great every time, and they get devoured whenever I make them.

These are the BEST oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever had.  I made a few with pecans.  I made a few with walnuts.  I even made a few without nuts.  They were all divine and did not last long.  I read the reviews before making these as oatmeal raisin cookies are one of my favorite cookies and this recipe was a bit different.  I soaked the raisins, added an egg, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, and only used 1 tsp of baking soda as suggested by other reviews.     I look forward to making (eating) these again.

These cookies were very good.  They were more "cakey" than I usually like my oatmeal cookies but the taste was still great overall.  I didn't soak the raisins, but instead, simmered them for about 10 minutes, thus cutting the time down considerably.  I also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup crisco so they wouldn't flatten out so much.  They stayed soft and chewy which my family loved.

This was more of a sugar cookie, rather than the hearty sort of oatmeal cookie I was looking for.

These cookies are sooo good!  This recipe made me look like I knew what I was doing and I don't bake cookies very often.    Next time I will make the pecan peices a bit larger and I might even try walnuts, as I prefer them in oatmeal cookies.

Very tasty!  I added a dash of nutmeg & apple pie spice.  I had trouble with the edges of the cookies burning before the middle was done.  I ended up using heaping tablespoons for each cookie and pushed the middle down so that it took the edges longer to cook.  This worked well.

I have nothing positive to say about these cookies, bland, too much baking powder, not enough raisins, not sweet and they ran together. I tried adjusting the recipe but after the 3rd batch I realized my Christmas cookies were not going to make it.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. After all of the fab reviews, I was pretty confused. These cookies just didnt have enough flavor. It definitely lacked something.

Thanks for the recipe. These are by far the best oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever had. I did not soak the raisins, I couldn't wait that long to make them. If it makes a difference to soak them, I can't imagine, because they're perfect already.

Strangest cookies I've ever made.  I had to use canola oil in place of the butter which is what I think threw me off. Anyway, the batter was more like a crumble and the cookies looked like biscuits until I smooshed them down while they were still baking. Despite that, they're DELICIOUS. Go figure.

Who knows whether soaking the raisins is actually what makes the difference, but I love these cookies.  Love eating the raw cookie dough (frozen, or at least chilled) even more.

I'm not an experienced baker so the rating comments really helped me.  I incorporated the tips so that the cookies would not be flat, yet they were still flat!  However, it did not effect the taste - these cookies are soft chewy and really are some of the best I have tasted.  Next time I bake them I will substitute some of the flour for more oats and add a little more spice.

I just made these to put in the vintage cookie jar my sweetie gave me last week. He sat with a glass of milk and ate 6 in just minutes!!! I took the advice of someone who held the third egg out and added it later---I think that was a big help. This is most definitely a keeper!!! Will make it again and again and again!!!

This is the best soft oatmeal cookie.  I decrease the white and brown sugars to 3/4 c each, decrease the butter by 2 T, and add 1/2 tsp salt.  This has been our favorite oatmeal raisin cookie since 1992...so glad to find it on allrecipes.com too.  It's great with craisins for a change also.

Really really good cookies. Although, I do wish they had more raisins but that is simply something I'll remember next time. I left out the vanilla (because I don't have any) and doubled to spices and added allspice. Really soft and amazing. I will definitely make these again someday.

Last night, hubby and I had a sweet tooth after dinner so made these. They were absolutely delicious! The only thing that I did differently was that instead of just adding vanilla, I also added a little rum extract.  The few cookies that are left today are still yummy.  I will definitely hang on to this recipe!

While these were, by far, the BEST tasting oatmeal cookies I have ever had, the mixing process was quite gruelling.  I have osteoarthritis in my hands and this dough was sooooo stiff and hard to stir that I kept reviewing the dry ingredients to make sure I didn't make a mistake.  In the future, I will soak the raisins in water to soften them and add the eggs to the creamed mixture as in most recipies.  This recipe also makes about 6 dozen cookies so I would cut it in half. 4 1/2 stars!

This is a great recipe! The trick to good Raisin cookies is soaking the raisins in the egg & vanilla first. Makes a difference. My family loves these.

EXCELLENT COOKIES!  I made these for my boyfriend for Valentines day (they're his favorite) and he ABSOLUTELY LOVES them! I followed another reviewers advice and added 1 extra tsp. of baking soda, 1 tsp. of baking powder and 1/2 tsp. of salt.  I also added an 1 extra tsp. of cinnamon for an added yummy factor. I usually don't like raisins much but having soaked them before hand made them a little softer and I enjoyed them very much in these cookies. Everyone who has tried them has LOVED them! Thank you for the wonderful recipe, we will be baking a lot more of these in the future!

1. Raw dough-excellent!  I ate several cookies worth while waiting for the cookies to bake.  (I know, I know, don't eat raw dough)
2. Out of the oven-excellent!  Moist and warm.
3. Next day-excellent!  Tender and Chewy.  I'm shocked that some made it to the next day.  I was pleasantly surprized at how many cookies this recipe makes.

The only thing I changed was instead of raisins, I used craisins.  I'm sure it's perfect either way.

The cookies came out really good, I needed to cook them longer than the recipe called for, but watched them closely, I underbaked them so that they would be chewy. I only gave it 4 stars because I think that the recipe could use more flavor- maybe more cinnamon or ?  My husband liked them and everyone who tried them liked them. I took them to work and just got a so-so response out of them. No WOW's or asking for recipe, etc...

Good consistency and moistness...not much in the flavor department.  Just okay.

Great Recipe! Also, for those that prefer to use whole wheat flour...you can substitute the entire 2.5 cups all purpose with Whole Wheat PASTRY flour.  I tried it today and it's great!

The first cookies went all flat and spread out so I added about 1/2 cp flour to the dough. After that they came out much better. They have a better consistency. Once I added that flour the recipe was really good.

This is my first time to make oatmeal cookies, but it is what my boss wanted for his birthday. I did make it into one big cookie and it tasted wonderful. Everyone in the office loved it. I did add some cinnamon and nutmeg, but it is moist and not hard at all. I won't even bother trying another recipe, I'll just stick with this one.

these were good.  i changed a few things:  reduced the white sugar by 1/2 cup  (plenty sweet still!); decreased white flour to 2C and increased oats to 2 1/2.  also, smashed up the oats with my fingers first-someone had suggested this and that helps "bake" the oatmeal in.  increased cinnamon and vanilla by 1/2 tea each. after sifting flour and spices together i mixed in the oats.  after creaming butter / sugar, alternated egg/raisin mix and flour/oat mix to this.  worked great & tastes great!  next time i may try and reduce the butter a little and sub w applesauce--but just a little, still want them to be cookies.

These cookies are a hit, I modified them as well.  Instead of raisins, I "marinated" cranberries overnight, and instead of cinnamon, I used pumpkin pie spice.  Our family wasn't too crazy about cranberries, but needing them for healthy kidneys, I thought I'd give it a try.   I must say, they don't stay on the plate very long and I was VERY surprised how fast they went at other events.    Very yummy!

Good cookies.  I loved the texture.  Next time I will add some vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  I think that will make them a 5.

Fabulous recipe!  I used Craisins instead, but still soaked them as directed.  I added more cinnamon and a couple shakes of pumpkin pie spice.  I also used rolled oats, not quick oats.  They turned out so good!  I made them for my daughters' preschool teachers and they told me I should open a cookie shop!

These were pretty darn good, but not off the charts unbelievably good... I set the bar high when it comes to dessert. If I make this again, I'd add a pinch of salt and maybe mix in some golden raisins too.

Awesome cookies! Yum-yum! These also stay good for a week! They would make great cookies to send in care pkgs to kids in college or the service, because they stay good so long. They are great with dried cranberries instead of raisins if you prefer. Great recipe :o)

This is an overall excellant recipe. I modified it a bit by adding 1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce to egg mixture, 1/2 tsp salt, and using self rising flour instead of all purpose flour + baking soda. My kids haven't stopped eating the cookies.

I've made these cookies several times and my husband keeps asking me to make them over and over. If you are not a raisin lover, substitute craisins for the raisins.  Still delicious!

I think the best cookie I've ever made.  Other than leaving out the pecans, I followed the recipe as written.  Exceptional taste.  Big hit among the Christmas cookies.  A keeper.

I would like to try this recipe. One question though...why soak the raisens? And keep the eggs in room temp for an hour? Is that healthy? I don't like raisens plump and juicy. I like them on the harder, chewy side. With that preference in mind, should I still soak the raisens? Or just toss them in the batter? Thanks! :)

Everyone loved these cookies, they were a bit hit at the office.  Althought I may use a half cup of white sugar next time, just to cut down on the sweetness.

Make sure you have lots of milk in the fridge before baking these cookies!

I have been making this recipe for many years now. EVERYONE that I give these cookies to LOVE them. I told a co-worker about how much people raved about these cookies. This co-worker does not like oatmeal raisin cookies, however, she had to try them. Even she LOVED them. I never have any problems with these cookies; EVER!

The cookies were the "bomb"! Everyone raved about them. Instead of raisins, I used cherry flavored Craisins. They were soft and delicious, what more can I say?

These are the best Oatmeal Raisin cookies I have ever eaten. The raisins are soft because of the soaking, and the cookies are just the right sweetness. I would change nothing about this recipe.

I needed a "nut free" cookie for a friend with allergies, and these were easy and tasty.  Some of the dough didn't mix quite as well as I would have hoped, but a little extra vanilla for moisture worked great.  And the extras freeze great!

The best oatmeal raisin recipe out there! This will make raisins haters love raisins! My cookies turned a little flat but I like it that way. Crunchy on thee edges but chewy on the center. Definitely an A+++++. I added more   cinnamon though..and this recipe yielded more that what it says.  
Make sure you leave spaces between cookies and that you only drop them in small amounts or else they will spread and stick to each other.

I will try the 1/2 baking soda and 1/2 baking poweder next time. :)

Very good recipe!  I added more cinnamon and some nutmeg for spice.  I did everything else as stated.  My cookies ended up a little flatter - but they look prettier then the ones in the picture! Yummy!!! Thanks!

These went over GREAT with my family, friends, and students.  Hubby said that they were better than his mom's!!  (It yielded many more than 36 cookies, though.)  This one is surely a keeper with many copies of the recipe passed around.

WOW what a fantastic easy recipe.  I fell in love with Otis Spunkmeyer cookies when I lived in America and since moving back to London I have not found anything that comes anywhere close  ...until now. These cookies are Just as good, if not better.  
The only thing I had to change was the cooking time, I doubled it, as when I took them out after 10mins the underside was nowhere near done, but after 20 minutes they were PERFECT. They were gone in seconds and now everyone is begging for more  ...there all addicted !!!!

These are perfect. We keep them in the freezer, and serve them with 2 minutes of thawing. I found the dough dry, even with extra large eggs. However, pressing each spoonful with my hands helped form each cookie. My husband had been hoping for a better raisin cookie for years, and now he's finally happy!!

The cookies are amazing.  I took 1/2 tsp off the baking soda and used 1/2 tsp ok baking powder and they were light and fluffy.  Delicious.  The secret really is in soaking the raisins.

WOW are these ever good!  I'm not a huge fan of oatmeal cookies but wanted to make them for the goodness of the oatmeal and they are incredible!  I took someone's advice and used baking powder instead of soda and they were not flat at all!  I also used walnuts instead of pecans because they're really good for you too... Hey, I'm a health nut with a very sweet side!

Awesome.  Absolutely perfect.  They were nice and big, crunchy on the bottom with a wonderfully soft bite and the raisins were fabulous.  Everyone raved about these and I will certainly make them again and again.

The right balance of cinnamon vanilla and butter.  Wasn't heavy on the tongue.  My friends ask me to make these once a month.  They tell me they can't find store made that are as tasty as these.

Easily the best oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever made.  Also the only cookie where I won't pick out all the raisins.  The soaking is absolutely key
(I also tried them with dairy/soy free spread instead of butter and they were still great!)

I hate oatmeal raisin cookies, but my boyfriend and dad love them, so I decided to try this recipe.  They both loved them.  Dad said they were the best he'd ever had.  My boyfriend bought a ton of oats and raisins so that I'd always have the stuff onhand to make more.

These were the best cookies.  I changed the raisin amount to 1 1/2 times and didn't add the pecns because I didn't have them.  Walnuts would have worked though.  I also added 1 teasp of cloves and made them a little bigger.  They came out soft and chewy and wonderful.

These are wonderful! I thought that soaking the raisins was our family secret, but now it's out. We put the box of raisins in a sauce pan, cover it with water, bring to a simmer then save them til' the next day to make the mix. You can also make them the same day. I added a wee bit of salt to the recipe. I used walnuts, and they are absolutely fantastic.

Awesome, delicious cookies. Used freshly groound cinamon, touch of nutmeg and cloves - again freshly ground, a half teaspoon of baking powder and an extra egg white I had.  Also used golden raisins instead of the normal dark ones, and just broke up my pecans, as opposed to adding chopped.  They were gone in 15 minutes, so had to make another batch immediately.

Love to try soaking the raisins in rum or something like that for an adult cookie - will let you know.

Seriously, however, best I ever ate.

I'll never again make oatmeal cookies without soaking the raisins, and I will likely never again make a different oatmeal cookie than this one! Slightly crunchy on the outside, sweet and soft on the inside, just perfect. I used baking powder because I didn't have baking soda, I would do it that way next time too. Pull them out at 10 minutes!  Perfect, perfet, perfect.

I made these cookies day before fathers day.  While I was waiting I also made muffins while the raisins were sitting.  This was a wonderfull recipie.  The cookies came out super moist and I accidentally left a batch in too long and they still didn't burn just got more golden after about an extra 5 minutes.  I also want to mention that I used this batch and only made 2 1/2 dozen cookies because I love big cookies they came out chewy and delicious just in case any one wants big ol juicy oatmeal raisin cookies. They were easy to get off the cookie sheet and left the sheet easy to clean.  These are a very moist chewy yummy cookie but if you leave them in for a crunchier cookie they still turn out great!!!!

This recipe is a HIT with my family!  Soaking the raisins does make a difference.  I agree with the other reviewers that you should take the cookies out after 10 minutes, even if they don't look quite done.  I've made 3 batches of these, and they disappear quickly!

The dough was very dry and crumbly, very hard to "drop" by spoonfuls.  I won't blame the recipe though, I may have measured the flour wrong or something.

I like this recipe, although I'd have to agree with a previous review that they are somewhat bland.  I think next time I make them, I'll double the amount of cinnamon and add a little sugar. Mine also came out quite flat!

Excellent cookie!  I made these cookies 3 days ago, and they are still just as moist.  The only change was that I added 1/2 cup extra raisins and some dried cranberries, and they still could have used more (but that's to my family's taste).

needs more raisins I think. some parts did not have raisins in them, but it was a very good recipe. nice and soft cookies just the way people like. they were a hit among even those who do not like oatmeal cookies. next time I will add craisins as well for a bit of a mix.

Best oatmeal cookie I've ever had! I've been trying to find a recipe that is different from the others. This one just has a certain amazing spice to it. Like I read in previous reviews, I put my dough in the freezer to harden and make easier for spooning on baking sheets.

these cookies are great!! I couldn't see everything actually coming together...but it did. Don't be afraid to get your hands in there! I rolled them into a log and chilled for a bit...then sliced. We liked them so well that my husband decided he wanted some for work...that batch was gone quickly too.

Excellent recipe.  I just tried it today.  I added 1/4 cup of dates at the end instead of nuts.  And used 1/2 cup artifical sweetener and 1/2 cup white sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar.  1 3/4 cup of raisins instead of just 1 cup.  And used magarine instead of butter.  Used 3/4 cup.  Turned out moist and chewy when I baked it for 12 minutes dropping by tablespoonfuls.

This recipe is amazing.  I halved the recipe because I only wanted to make a few cookies, it made about 25.  The only thing I would do different next time is add a little bit more raisins.  This is a great recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is by far the best oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I have 
baked! I omitted the nuts, increased the flour to 3 cups,
so the cookies weren't flat and added a pinch of nutmeg, ground cloves and cinnamon to the soaked mixture. When cool,I sprinkled with confectioners powdered sugar. It is my grandchildrens' Breeann, Courtney,Ashleigh,Michael, Kailey, and Landon's favorite!!!!!!!!

Oh my!  I have never tasted anything more delicious...
My talent in cooking definately does not lie within cookies but I gave this recipe a whirl and the finished product was amazing!  Very easy also!  Be sure to soak the raisins...the taste is unreal!

Came out excellent and BIG! Make sure to use small spoonfuls. I thought it was a little too 'cinnamon-y' but that's just my taste. Next time I plan on adding more raisins to the mix.

Finally an Oatmeal Raisin Cookie that is perfect.  They are not too large and are chewey without being too soft.  I didn't add the nuts as my husband doesn't like them but I did add extra cinnamon, mace and cloves for more flavor.  I also left the egg mixture with raisins and vanilla in the fridge overnight.

This cookies were great!  They were very chewy and moist!!  Hint= spoon small amounts of cookie dough on the pan, they come out very big.  Only problem was that the cookies flattened out.

The BEST Oatmeal Raisin cookies I've found. I used chopped walnuts rather than pecans. Very soft and moist. I'll make these again and again and again...

Well, after reading the reviews I made these cookies, waiting the hour for the raisins to soak and everything.  They turned out bland, bland, bland!  ugh.  I used marg instead of butter, but can't see that as having made the difference.  I think if I were to do it again, which is unlikely, I would add a double helping of cinnamon, maybe some cloves, maybe a touch of molasses ... I don't know what.  ANYTHING to give these babies some flavour!  My older kids won't eat them, and the baby even took a few bites and pitched it (and cookies are his favourite food group!).  Sorry, not impressed.

These cookies rock my world.  Seriously these are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever tried and I will never use another recipe for them again! All other recipes for oatmeal raisin cookies should be destroyed.  The soaking of the raisins is key!  Thank you for this recipe!!!

These cookies got rave reviews from my "taste testers". Personally, I didn't find them visually appealing as they turned out very flat and seemed to brown before they were cooked through. I liked the raisin soaking idea, but I think I will try it in a recipe I like better. Sunflower Oatmeal Cookies on this site is awesome and I will try it with that one. But note you need to add the raisins to that recipe!

These cookies were pretty good.  I tasted a little to much oatmeal though.  I'll look for another recipe and see what happens.

Three words: Hea. Ven. Ly. I had a little trouble figuring out when they were done; the first pan I took out right at ten minutes, and the second I left in for another four or five. The first was soft and chewy, the second a little crunchier. My husband and I did (repeated) taste-test comparisons and determined we like both equally. Absolutely wonderful!

These came out fabulously! I had never heard of soaking the raisins before, but it really makes the world of difference. My husband said these were the best oatmeal raisin cookies he ever had.
