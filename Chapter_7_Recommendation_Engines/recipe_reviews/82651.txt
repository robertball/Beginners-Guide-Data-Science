This was soooo delicious! Left out the onions, reduced recipe for just me and hubby by using 1 can tomatoes, 4 eggs, and 1/2 large green pepper. Also used 1/2 hot Hungarian paprika and 1/2 sweet, gave it a great twist! To reduce cooking time, simmered at high temperature to remove tomato juice. Lastly, melted cheddar on top. Soooooooooo good! Don't miss the meat at all!

This is so good. Very flavorful and hearty and even better the next day. Make sure to choose a really flavorful rye, I like one with lots of caraway to go with this recipe.

This is really tasty and easy to make. I used smoked paprika, which I thought added a lot of the flavor.

One of my fave Hungarian dishes. You can use all eggs, meat or half/half. Sooo tasty.

I found this recipe very bland, even though I used loads of paprika. It is very quick and easy and I would try it again if anyone suggested any other spices or ingredients that would make it more interesting. I used courgettes, red peppers and mushrooms as I like a few vegetables in terms of colour and taste

Spicy!

I wasn't sure which paprika to use, so I used Hugarian paprika and mixed it with sweet paprika, like another reviewer recommended.  Wowee!  The Hungarian paprika gave it quite a kick.  It was too hot for my husband to eat!

I loved the flavors in this recipe and thought it was different and delicious, but next time, I'll definitely stay away from the hot paprika!

It was amazing! I added feta cheese at the end to flavor it up even more and add some more protein.
