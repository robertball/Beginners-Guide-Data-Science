This is my new favorite dessert.  As others suggested, I cut the sugar to 1 cup & added the zest of one lemon.  I served it in small antique sundae glasses & topped with a splash of cream, 3 raspberries & a sprig of mint.  All my friends were impressed & I raved about the fresh lemon flavor.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I had no problems with it setting up.  However, as I was making it, I thought it would be a great ice cream.  Just cool, then put in the ice cream maker.  Even if it is a custard consistency, you can still make ice cream with it.  I might try this with lime, too, & serve it after a Mexican meal.

This was smooth, rich, tangy, overall AMAZING!  And it was so easy to make!  I used some fresh Meyer lemons and Trader Joe's heavy cream- when a recipe has only three ingredients quality of ingredients becomes very important.  The whole family loved it, from my husband to my four year old.  I also made the Lemon Meltaways from this site and they were a perfect companion to the posset. I will definitely put this in my repertoire of recipes.

Delicious as written!  I have a SAFTY HINT for this recipe.  Since the lemon, cream, sugar mixture is extremely hot as you pour it into your dessert dishes, I have thought of a safe way to put the hot dessert dishes into the fridge without getting burned.  Place the empty dessert dishes in a low sided baking dish or tray, when filling them with the posset mixture.  Once you have filled all of the dishes, pick up the baking dish and slide it into the fridge.  This way you don't have to worry about getting burned, from the hot mixture, when picking up each dessert dish and putting it in the fridge individually.

Wow!  Lemon Posset, where have you been all my life?  What a sweet pleasure this dessert is.  It does soften rather quickly upon removing from the refrigerator, but I remedied that by freezing it for just a few hours before serving.  It doesn't harden too much, but stays firm much longer.  I did add the zest of one of the lemons, because it seemed to be screaming for that.  By the way, one recipe makes about 32 oz, which is helpful if you're trying to divide the mixture equally between serving dishes.

Super easy and delicious. I added lemon zest and I would reduce the sugar next time. Too sweet.  But otherwise - awesome!

This was lovely. I boiled mine for three minutes until it began to thicken on the sides of the pan but given that there is no flour it sets into a thick creme rather than a custard, even after leaving it overnight.

The recipe gets four stars for specifying number of lemons rather than spoons or mls of lemon juice, because the size of people's lemons can differ. This may be the reason why people were complaining the recipe is too tart or sweet. To overcome this simply taste the mixture as you add lemon juice and adjust accordingly.

I added vanilla to mine- you could add a vanilla bean at the beginning, I didn't as it was the first time trying the recipe. 
Some people suggested using lemon zest- I do not like the "marmalade effect" so I put two strips of peel in at the beginning so I could extract the lemon oils and then easily fish the peel out when I added the juice.

I will try this again with different flavours such as lime or orange with a spoonful of cocoa (chocolate-orange creme). It would also lend itself well to floral notes, such as a hint of rosewater or for something really unique, pandan extract which I have used successfully with lemon yoghurt. Maybe orange blossom water or limoncello would be nice too.

I'm not a total lemon dessert lover, but when I saw the recipe, I thought I'd try it. (I have to admit, the picture definitely caught my attention.) I halved the recipe. I'm not sure if that affected how it set or if I should have put it in serving glasses (I just poured it all in a bowl). It didn't set entirely even after the time suggested. When I first tried it, it was WAY sweet and I almost threw it away. Someone suggested to me to freeze it, which I did and found it much more edible. If I make it again and whether I freeze it or not, I will definitely cut the sugar down. Had I not frozen it, I would've given this recipe 3 stars.

Sensational flavor and shockingly easy.  The smooth creaminess blends with the lemon tart flavor for a truly refreshing dessert.  I only made 1/3 of the recipe since it was too hard to justify eating so much decadence all by myself (though I easily could have eaten more!).  This one is a keeper!

Excellent taste and quickly made.  Adding a little lemon zest makes it extra tangy.

I was looking for a recipe to use cream that had just begun to sour.  This receipe, calling for only 3 ingredients and including fresh lemon, was worth a try.  It was so worth it.  Slightly tangy, very smooth and creamy and wonderful flavor.  Will definitely try it with fresh cream next time.  Note, did try it with some fresh fruit, but decided it didn't need it.

Wow. You must try this very simple and easy dessert. I used meyer lemons from Trader Joes and scaled down the recipe to one serving since I am the only one who eats sweets in my home. It is an easy and quick tasty dessert!

I think I would have rated this higher if, after 7 hours in the fridge, the center wasn't still mostly liquid.  Perhaps it has something to do with the way I juice my lemons (with a potato ricer) and that gets more juice out of them - I would guess that might change the consistency.  It would be good to know what the 'juice of one lemon' equals to in measurements.  Just a thought.

Delightfully refreshing an SOOOO easy to make!  The first time I made it it was a little runnier that I preferred, so I made it again today and put it in the freezer after the 5 hours for about 30 minutes and it firmed up nicely!  Also, I stirred it while it was boiling so that it would not scald or burn on the bottom while in the saucepan.  I served it with maple syrup sweetened whipped cream and fresh raspberries.  It was a wonderful dessert and my guests enjoyed it immensely!

Heavenly silky texture.  I reduced sugar to a cup and added a little extra lemon juice.  Next time I'll add lemon zest for more tang.  My family oohed and aahed for this.

I loved the concept of this dessert, but the result was disappointing.  It was far too rich for even my husband to eat (and the man can scarf down amazing quantities of chocolate mousse at one go).  The posset also 'melted' very quickly once it left the fridge, and I felt like I was eating vaguely lemony cream.  Sorry!  Won't be making again.

I used whipping cream and it turned out PERFECT!, set up very hard and was nice and lemony. I did cut the sugar down to 1cup and am glad I did as I am not so much of a sweet tooth.

Awesome...I added a little more lemon juice and zest...This got raves from my boyfriend.  I also put it in the freezer instead of the fridge.  It sets much faster and I prefer a more firm consistency.  I can't wait to make this for guests!  Thanks!

Lots of lemony flavor, which I liked alot but I did have trouble getting it to set all the way through. Still this was tasty and I cut the sugar to 1 cup as suggested.

I tried this recipe last weekend for my husband, who is low-carbing for a while.  Just used splenda in place of the sugar - otherwise followed recipe as written.  Served with a couple of fresh strawberries and whipped cream on top - he was in heaven! Very easy and quick.

Mmmmm.. Very tart (possibly too tart), great texture. It is yummy but hard to finish an entire serving in one sitting because of the tartness.  Good though!

Delicious! I Love a simple 3 ingredient recipe and it was so easy to prepare.  Have made this for several events and it's always a hit. If you like lemon you can't miss with this recipe. Be sure to include the lemon rind suggested by several reviewers.

To cut the fat a little I used 2 cups of the heavy cream and one cup of skim evap. milk and that worked great.  I added a teaspoon of zest and used just a tad less sugar--good amount of sweet/tart.  I used six deep ramekins and they were FULL which means two things---first,you could easily get ten servings from this recipe, second, the type of serving dish you use will determine how well it sets up---mine were set on top but not on the bottom.  Easy to make, taste and texture are great, nice make ahead dessert.

I love lemon and this was wonderful.  It did not set up well for me, and I think it was that I used fairly large lemons.  It didn't matter!  Ate it anyway. Also cut the sugar to 1 cup.  Spooned some over pound cake and ate way more than I should of.  Even though it did not set up well, I still rated it 5 stars because it was very good.  Will make it over and over again.

I really liked this - so did everyone at the Mother's Day dinner.  I'm kind of stingy about handing out 5's but this was great!

This is a very good recipe. A little posset goes along way so I served it in very small cups. I did add more lemon juice, almost double, but that is just personal taste. I made it to take to dinner at a friend's house and one of the guests is chef at a very nice hotel. He asked me for the recipe! High praise indeed.

Made it for my family at Thanksgiving.  After squeezing lemons had 1/4 cup of juice.  I also threw it in the freezer at first for 30mins.  Than moved it into the fridge - they were in for 5 hours - I'll say it was "set" all the way through - but It was great

I was looking for a lemon posset recipe after enjoying a fantastic lemon posset at a little place called Homage in Reno, NV.  I made this recipe exactly as it is written here. Although it is tasty, I find it to be a little too sweet, and not quite lemony enough. I will definitely make it again with adjustments.

Five for ease and five for taste. I don't eat desserts because I'm always on a diet. I had my family taste these for me and they felt the dessert was too sweet, which can be easily adjusted. I did taste it and agree about too sweet. I am giving a luncheon and can't be cooking when my quests arrive so I will make these in advance.  I will serve smaller portions with fresh fruit. Tossing around doing a layered dessert. This being one layer. But because of the ease this is my dessert choice.

This was pleasant enough but it was nothing special. I am NOT one to turn my nose up at a dessert because of fat/calories, but for me the final product here was absolutely not worth the fat... I'm going to use the rest of the cream for creme brulee, which is worth the fat. We won't finish the posset.

So simple and delicious. My husband who is not a big lemon fan asks for this now and my 5 year old like to help make it. I use 1 cup of sugar and zest from 1 lemon.

Really good, very simple.  I reduced it to 2 servings (roughly) and made as directed.  Except I added the lemon zest.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's not exactly low-cal.  I'm surprised no one has tried to cut back on the cream with a low-cal substitute.  I will try it.  Although I don't know how to cut back on the sugar.  Any ideas?  Otherwise it was excellent.  Very decadent.  Poured into martini glasses.  Consistency was perfect.

This was amazing!  Smooth, velvety, creamy.  I made it twice, once to go in a lemon trifle which was waaaay good, and once by itself with frozen blueberries on top.  I wonder if it can be made in other flavors?

I have made this may times. It is my husband’s favorite. I made this to bring to a Christmas party. I used a 1/2 gallon of heavy cream and 2 cups of sugar. I bought 4 oz. plastic cups with lids at Smart & Final and portioned into 28 servings. I will top with a small squirt of whipped cream and a raspberry before serving. I simmer for 20 minutes so it is very thick. I know it will be a hit. Thanks for the amazing recipe.

So easy and so refreshing!  I did add lemon zest as others suggested.  My daughter thought the sugar level was perfect... but the rest of us thought it was a little too much sugar.  Great recipe - will definitely make again soon.

I love this recipe - simple and lovely.  My only complaint is the 'juice of 3 lemons' part.  Why not a measurement?  lemons vary wildly in juiciness and size.  I will make again, though!

Excellent and easy. I made these changes: cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, added the zest of one lemon (you could add more -- and you may want to strain out the zest but I did not), and boiled longer about 18 minutes. Then I put it into one bowl; an 8x8 baking pan would have been OK too.

Easy and very tasteful, just add a few hundreds and thousands for the kids, they lap it up
