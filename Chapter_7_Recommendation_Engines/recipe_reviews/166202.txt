I adjusted this recipe to stuff summer sausage casings. I got the casings from Cabelas, and used about 6 0z of pork butt with it. I ground and stuffed the sausage. then convection roasted at 170 for a few hrs until the internal temp was 165. Excellent!

This is a great recipe!  I use natural hog casings and smoke it with hickory smoke in my smoker.  I have made this three times and the modifications I have made to my taste are using a 1 1/2 cups high melt temperature cheddar & doubling the amount of jalapeno peppers. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe with us all!

This is my first ever review of a recipe, but I had to tell you all how AWESOME and EASY this recipe is. It is a perfect and tasty way to use venison (of which we always have alot:) I was worried that the jalepeno's would make this a little to spicy but they don't, even my dad who doesn't like anything spicy couldn't stop eating this. Everyone who has tried this loves it, even my picky kids! Try this recipe, it is amazingly good and easy!! Thanks for sharing Emily!

Very good recipe! The cheese adds all the fat you need to hold the sausage together. I omitted the Mortons and added salt to taste. I cooked up little batches until it was just right. I tried it baked in the oven and also made it into patties. Delish! I liked it made into patties better though. I think next time I will keep the seeds in the jalapenos. It just wasn't spicy enough for me.

This is a great recipe that I have made several times.  I first made the recipe with venison and doubled the jalapenos then stuffed collagen casings and smoked them on my smoker with hickory chips.  They turned out really well but I thought they could have had more kick to them.  I just made this recipe with lean ground beef and it turned out even better.  I still used the collagen casings and smoked with hickory chips but I added even more cheddar and jalapenos.  Make sure you leave some of the membrane in the jalapenos if you want more heat.  This time I used 4 Jalapenos and 4 Serano peppers and a 16 ounce block of extra sharp cheddar for 5 pounds of ground beef.  It turned out amazing with a lot more flavor.

When you roll into logs, you have to pack tightly or you will get air pockets. That's probably why casings and sausage stuffers work so well because you can get the typical summer sausage consistency. I like the flavor, but will probably use casings next time to get a better consistency.

This was very good, better than standard summer sausage according to my samplers.  I didn't have tender quick available so I used a tsp of sodium nitrite and 2.5 tbls pickling salt.

We made 10 pounds of sausage only omitting the cheese.  This recipe is very tasty and much easier than the recipe we usually use for summer sausage.  This will be our "Go To" recipe for venison summer sausage from now on. We will add more jalapeno pepper with the next batch. 
Thanks you for a stellar recipe!

Overall product wasn't as good as anticipated, would not repeat this recipe.  Flavor was rather bland and not as spicy as desired.

first time i made this i follow the recipe to the T, well fantastic taste, but very dry. the next time i experimented i used 80/20 ground beef to see if i just needed the fat to keep it moist and it was perfect!! also using habenero peppers is a nice HEATED change if u like spice

I substituted lean ground beef for the venison and it was a big hit!  Super easy to make since you don't need to use a casing. Will make again often!!

Flavor is definitely 5 star - loved the spiciness!  The texture was very dry though.  Next time I will either cook it wrapped in foil (with holes for ventilation) or sub out 1 pound of ground pork or beef fat.  I couldn't find the Tender Quick locally and knew the sausage would get eaten this weekend so I used a salt/sugar mixture of three parts salt to one part sugar.  I will order some online for future use, but this worked well.  I would definitely recommend this recipe!

This was my 1st attempt at venison summer sausage. I used hickory smoked bacon on a 5 to 1 ratio. I believe it is important to follow the directions and let it stand in the fridge for a day and that will settle the salt flavor. What's cool about this is that it's a great base to make your own flavors out of. Also, in casings, I did mine in a convection oven for 8 hours on 175.

I found it to be a bit dry, maybe adding some pork or pork fat would help, but wouldn't want it to detract from the venison flavor. The cheddar melted and disappeared along with it's flavor.

Tried this recipe last year and LOVED it...we also found the cheddar held it together fine, was not dry or crumbly at all.  Double the peppers or add in some pepper flakes to increase the heat.  Also made batch last year with 5 alarm cheese that 5 different peppers including habenero and it was our favorite.  Also, we found we like it better if we removed the foil prior to cooking--tried both ways..First deer this year is ready to grind so better get to it!!

Thank you sooo much for putting this online and actually taking the time to list the nutritional information!!! This is pretty much identical to a recipe my father-in-law uses and now I'm able to enjoy his, and know how to keep track of it for my diet. Thank you so much Emily! I wish more people would put the nutritional info on their recipes. Keep up the good work!

When I don't have casings I will roll tightly in wax paper like a tootsie roll to get it packed and shaped, let it sit in that overnight and bake at 175 for 8 hours, 1st 2 in the wax paper. I also cut the venison with fat back to keep it from drying out

This is a very good recipe for venison.  The jalapeno did not take over the taste.  I also used high temp cheese.  I added some bacon ends to the mix to bring up the fat content to meet 80/20%.  I used 2.5" fiber casings and I smoked it for 1 hour in hickory (180) then finished in the oven at 200 until the center was 170.  I think I will try smoking with apple wood next time for a different taste.  Either way everyone who tasted this mix loved it.

This is a great recipe to start out with!!! very glad I found it!  I would say to use more spices then it says to because I like a more robust flavor.  I tried it with     1 Tbls. garlic powder and 2 Tbls onion powder,  and 3 jalapeno peppers and left the seeds in.  the out come was good but next time I will use more  of  garlic and onion and probably more pepper.  but it is good so thank you Emily Tisdale for posting it.

This is one of the easiest recipes for making summer sausage.  The flavor is outstanding. The texture was excellent.  Most noteable for the first time was the moistness of the product and the smooth, mild taste.  As an option we smoked this on the smoker using pear wood.  Absolutely the right way to finish this product.

I used 2 pounds moose meat and 1 pound of pork. I left out th liquid smoke and cooked and smoked the summer sausage in my smoker instead. It turned out awesome! Will definitely make again.

I was "gifted" fifteen pounds of venison to experiment with as I have acquired a new sausage making hobby.  This was on the the three recipes I made with it.  After reading the other reviews I decided to use 3 jalapenos, two with seeds and membrane and nearly two cups of cheddar to add additional fat and keep the sausage moist.  It is tender, full of flavor and not dry at all.  We will be making this again soon and will try it in beef as well.  My batch was ready just in time for Superbowl Sunday!  Thanks Emily!

We really like this. I added a bit extra jalapeno. I had to make my own curing salt (not carried in my small grocery) by mixing twice as much KOSHER salt as brown sugar. 2T salt 1 T brown sugar. Mine was not too salty at all as others complained.

EDIT: I added more cheese to try to make it stick together better. Still a bit crumbly so next time I will try adding a bit of ground suet as well.

EDIT 2: I've made this several times now. I add just a bit of ground pork . Since we just butchered a hog I will add a tiny bit of ground fat this holiday season. Makes great Christmas/ hostess gifts!

EDIT 3: I guess I add WAY more jalapeno and cheese. Gonna try adding either some hot pepper flakes or a bit of cayenne. Also extra mustard seeds as I love the pop they make when bit.

Just a side note on this wonderful sausage. After a couple days in the frig before freezing the jalapeno was a lot stronger as were all the spices.

This sausage is very good but quite mild.  Potency of jalapenos varies based on growing conditions.  If yours are mild, increase the amount by 3 or 4 times.  Cheese amount is just right.  Smoking instead of baking also improves the flavor.  Works well with skins.

TOO SALTY!  This recipe would be delicious, if the salt wasn't burning the tastebuds right off my tongue.  Cut the salt in half and perhaps it will be edible.

First time making--Followed the ingredients as listed with the exception of cheddar cheese as I substituted high heat pepper jack.  First time ever "rolling" meat into a log but it wasn't that difficult.  Next batch will add some heat to it with cayenne pepper or more jalapeno's.  Might try using the smoker on the next go around.  Overall satisfied.

I made this exactly to the recipe. I like others was somewhat disappointed with the bland flavor. Regular cheddar cheese disappeared in the finished product i would call this a good base recipe at best. High heat cheese is available through LEM products which i will use next time as well as more jalapeño.

I made this, the only thing I did different was I packed them into summer sausage casings and smoked them in my electric smoker at 275 degrees for 2.5 hours until temp was 165.

Next time I’ll add more jalapeno with seeds and garlic.    We didn’t add the liquid smoke bc we plan on smoking them.  We used regular cheddar and jack cheese and stuffed into hog casings.

I used this recipie as a base / starting point for my first time making summer sausage and it turned out really good. Even though I did not follow the recipie entirely they came out better than expcted for oven cooked. Most of the cheese ended up on the pan after cooking so I may try a high temp cheese of use casings next time. And as for the ingredients, I added minced garlic, chipotle seasoning replaced the liquid smoke, red pepper flakes, and I went overboard on the crushed pepper. As for spice and taste it was a hit, even for those that wouldn’t normally go near deer. I cooked it at 190 degrees for 8 hours until the internal temp hit about 165 then tossed in the refrigerator.  Which I think was a little too high of heat, next time will be about 180 and pull the sausage when it reaches 160. Now I just need to find a way to keep the cheese inside the sausage instead of all over the pan.

Try heating it slowly at 175 or 180 until the internal temp is 155 deg. It will take much longer but the quality will be much much better as the fat will not melt out

This stuff is awesome first time making this followed recipe exactly except for adding a little pork fat and taking out of the oven at 165 degrees  The only complaint was that alot of the cheese melted out. Second time used high temp cheese and stuffed into casings baked at 200 to an internal temp of 165 this is the best we have ever eaten only thing I might do next time is add some crushed red pepper because it wasn't spicy enough in my opinion I wish I had come across this recipe a long time ago . Also when we ground the deer meat we ground it twice

I made this recipe exactly how it said and it turned out pretty good, but I decided that I wanted to change a few things the second time through. The second time I made the recipe I didn't add any water, instead of garlic powder I used real minced garlic, I added a half a cup of cheese, and tripled the jalapeños, because I wanted more spice and it turned out great! One of the comments below says that you can't get the rolls to the right consistency without using casings, but that's not true. What I did was Roll the meat up in a decent roll with my hands, then I used a baking mat (you could also use wax paper) and I rolled up the sausage roll into the mat in order to compress it as tight as possible, then Wrapped it in tin foil before baking. My rolls came out just like they do when I use casings.

I did not add the cheese or the jalapeno. I added more garlic powder and some red pepper flakes. After a day in the fridge, I smoked it at 200°F with hickory for 4 hours, and another couple hours in the oven at 200°F. After it cooled,  couldn't wait to try it. This was absolutely the best summer sausage I have ever made, and everyone else who tried it said it was phenomenal. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is fabulous. I used it with my first deer and was not disappointed. After reading the reviews I was worried it wouldn't have enough flavor so I added red pepper as well. Not necessary. Next batch will be straight after the recipe. I also used casings and it worked well. 
Make sure you pack them tight, it helps with the crumbliness.  I've currently got my second batch in the oven now. Can't wait!

I've made this 2 years now and it's very good. I made a couple of tweaks to it. I do it with 2 lbs venison/1 lb ground pork and blend or chop the jalapenos with the seeds to make it more spicy. I also put them in casings. High temp cheese would also be better as a lot of the cheese melts. Everyone loves it. Thanks for the recipe!
