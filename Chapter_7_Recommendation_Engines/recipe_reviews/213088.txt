Oh my gosh!  So good!  I didn't have risotto, so I just used regular rice.  I used fresh basil and rosemary and included some chopped bell peppers with the onion.  MMMMMM!  I'd definitely make this again!

So I made this last night & made it just like the directions said & once I added the chicken broth i was concerned about us eating chicken soup with uncooked rice. I think the wording of the direction is off but after letting it cook down for twice the amount it pulled itself together for a great meal, also ingredients did not include the parsley & parmesan cheese it calls for in directions.

Nice simple intro to risotto if you're intimidated by it (like I was for years). Coincidentally, one box of Pacific Organic Chicken Broth equals three and one half cups... how convenient! I subbed fresh limas for the peas (and added them after the first 3 c. of broth but before the additional broth), and added a couple Tbsp. of butter just before adding the rice for a nuttier flavor. This was SOOOO GOOD! Takes a little time (closer to an hour for me) but so worth it!

I've never made risotto before, this was an excellent recipe to try! I didn't add peas but tried to stick to this as much as possible. Everyone was impressed! I prepped everything first and had it ready to add as I went along to make life easier. I will definitely make it again! Thank you!

I made this using mild italian sausage since that's what I had in the freezer.  Very easy and very delicious.  Glad I found this recipe.  I also stirred in 2 tablespoons of butter at the end.

LOVE this recipe!  I made a few changes though, I put the sausage in the food processor because I didn't like the idea of chunks of sausage.  I also added more onions and mushrooms.

We all loved this.  The recipe didn't state how much parmesan.  We stirred in about 1/2 cup total, I think, and we didn't pass any extra because we're on a low-sodium diet.  We all loved this dish.  I served it with a spinach salad with strawberries and blueberries.  Great dinner.

I LOVE this recipe.  I change up the wine-- I add 3/4 good Marsala instead of 1 cup of white wine.  Incredible flavor.

This was easy to make and the texture was very good.  This was my first time making risotto, and I was able to get that creamy risotto texture. The flavor was a bit lacking, in my taste. Maybe next time I'll add more veggies and some butter, like some reviewers suggested, to bring out the flavor.

I really enjoyed this dish, and not just because I was drinking the rest of the bottle after adding the wine to the dish!  I was a risotto rookie and have been scared to try it.  However a package of chicken sausage about to go bad in my fridge forced my fears away and I'm so glad it did!  Creamy and delicious and awesome - all three words to describe this dish.  My husband was skeptical and informed me that he would just "eat his leftover pizza from lunch" instead of my risotto but one bite won him over.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of the frozen peas.  I could have sworn I had some, but when I opened the freezer I was met with spinach or broccoli.  I chose broccoli and it turned out wonderfully.  Next time I'll be using the peas, though.  Great recipe and it reheats well.  I will be making this again (and not just to use up the rest of my arborio rice!)
UPDATE:  I made this again last night and loved it even more!  I didn't have any wine in the house, so I just used mostly chicken broth with a bit of water at the end when I ran out of chicken broth.  My husband LOVED it!  Chicken sausage is frequently on sale (plus I usually have a coupon) so I plan on keeping the ingredients around for a quick weeknight meal recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

Good risotto, nice flavor with the chicken sausage, but the directions need a little work.  In order to make risotto properly, you have to add one cup of stock at a time-you cannot just pour in three cups of liquid and walk away like you can with regular rice.  Add one cup of liquid at a time, stirring until the liquid is absorbed before adding the next cup.  Risotto takes anywhere from 20-25 minutes to make it properly, but it is well worth it.

I was the "hovering" chef while my 19-year-old made this (in the past 2 months she's decided to cook every chance she can get).  Not only was it SOOO GOOD, I'm SOOO PROUD of her for a great effort.  As usual, a lot of stirring with risotto but well worth it.

I love this dish. I chopped the onion and  laid out the ingredients the night before. Then I put it together and was enjoying a great one pot meal in less than an hour. I followed the directions (subbing sundried tomato chicken sausage) and it turned out creamy and delicious. I added a little salt. Thanks for this recipe. It's a keeper.

This was a very unexpected surprise.  I was afraid it might be a little bland, but the spices gave it good flavor.  I will try adding fresh mushrooms the next time I make it.

This is an excellent recipe for risotto and my stepson is really enjoying making this for us!  It's a great way for him to learn cooking skills with a dish that is normally intimidating to some cooks.  The only thing I would change is to add more seasoning as he did.  Without the extra seasoning you only get flavor when you get a bite of sausage.

This was fairly easy to make and really delicious! I used chicken parmesan sausage (what I could find at the meat counter). I had to add salt at the end to bring out the flavor.

I was hoping for wow and only got o.k.  I followed it to the letter except used regular rice, as it was all I had. The consistency was right but the taste was salty and just not wow. Maybe I would make it again and vary the ingredients.

This was a great easy recipe for risotto...I was intimidated to make this but I made it and it was a hit!!!  I did not have wine so I replaced it with 1 cup of chicken stock.  I also added 1 tb of butter and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese even more creaminess.  When I make it again I would not add as much chicken sausage and up the rice quantity.  I will def be making this again and possibly with different meats and veggies added.

Don't know if I changed it too much.  Ehh who am i kidding? I think mine was just based on the idea LOL. I love my risotto creamy, so I cut down the rice to one cup and 6 cups of broth.  I didn't use white wine but am sure it would've been been better if I did.  I also added spinach for extra veggies.  I loved it.

We were eating this about once a week at my house!  I didn't make any changes that I can remember.  It was my first go at Risotto so I did have to look up how long it was supposed to take.  The times are way longer!  I thought I was about to have rice soup!  Perfect though to make and I love telling people I make "Risotto".  :o)

I found this recipe to be a great change, I usually just make plain risotto...nothing fancy.  Upon reading other reviews, some people had trouble with the consistency of the risotto.  One thing I have learned in making risotto, is that you need to take it slow, add only about a cup of liquid at a time at a low simmer.  When that cup is almost fully absorbed, taste and then add another...continue taste before adding more liquid to test the "doneness" (not a word I know) of the rice.  Stir often, and add liquid until the rice is nice and soft.  I think the only problem with this recipe is that for novice risotto makers, they may find themselves with mush or partially done rice.  I basically followed the recipe...although I am not sure how much broth I ended up putting in, as like I said, I taste and add accordingly.  I did use frozen peas and carrots, as I didn't have just the peas...used a cup of cooking sherry for the wine.  I am sure this would be great with mushrooms added too.  Hubby and Kids (2 & 4) loved it

While this is a totally excellent recipe, even if this was the 1st time I have ever made risotto. YUM YUM! I can tell you I couldn't find the Arborio rice for the life of me. So after a few trips to several stores. I had to google it to find out what it was and found it was a medium grain rice...Lucky for me, I had it at home ;-) The other thing I ran into with this recipe was, the fact that no one had the exact flavor of sausage other then it in the fresh variety, because of issues with availability in stores.  So I made do. Because of this, I had to cook the sausage prior to following the directions, then noticed the company photo shows sliced or chunked sausage, but no where did it state to do so, so I went ahead and sliced them after I cooked them almost done. And proceeded with the directions. This sausages are wonderful. The flavor of the recipe was hmm soo good. I can't wait to try other risotto recipes. The last thing I will note, is there is 2 ingredients missing in the list of ingredients but was stated in the directions. And glad I caught that and had them on hand. I see this error and want others to note, AR needs to add them ;-)  But this recipe will be a repeater in my house. TY

Some very important things to keep in mind when making this recipe, to make it as delicious as possible:) 

1. Do NOT use regular rice. You must use risotta rice. It kind of defeats the purpose of the recipe if you don't. Risotta rice is denser and more pasta like than regular rice. It's delicious! You'll be happy you did.
2. Make sure the wine is almost fully absorded before moving on.
3. The broth portion of this recipe takes about 30-40 minutes. You should heat the broth on low in a separate pan and add 1/2 cup at a time and stir until is absorbed. This is what makes the rice so flavorful.
4. Use FRESH parm, not the jarred stuff, about a 1/2 cup to full cup. Yummers!
4. Upon completing this, the one thing I would do different is either grill or really brown my sausage before adding it in, I think this would make for a much nicer flavor.

I make risotta all the time, tonight I had this chicken sausage on my hands and didn't know what to do with it. Came across this recipe and was thrilled for the suggestion.  Enjoy!

I followed the recipe exactly and we thought it was okay.  It was my first attempt at risotto, and it turned out nice and creamy, but the flavor seemed to be lacking.  Also the addition of peas tasted a bit strange to us.  I won't make it again, but I will look for another risotto recipe.

What I really liked about this recipe is how easy it is to modify if you dont have everything exact at the house and dont feel like going to the store!  My boyfriend has NOT been a fan of chicken sausage anytime we have cooked it.  I had one package left and decided to try something out of the box.  Google led me to your recipe.
Didnt have regular rice or enough broth but had chicken flavored zatarain so used that and sudsituted one cup of broth with water.  Added basil bc didnt have the thyme and cut up some fresh mushrooms as well.  DIdnt have chardonnay but had chablis cooking wine. And had to use garlic powder bc didnt have fresh for some reason...
I loved it, he loved it, his son loved it.  This was a HIT and I will be making it again!  Thank you!

Very tasty!  I used a recipe for italian style sausage but with turkey substituted in. I substituted brown rice for white rice, which tripled the cooking time of the rice.  
I also used homemade chicken broth that I had left from boiling a chicken in bay leaves, garlic powder, and basil.  
Some reviewers said this recipe was bland, but with all the added spices with the way I did it, it was awesome!

I subbed the garlic chicken sausage since that is what my local store carried and I think it was great in this. Risotto typically takes a little more time to absorb the liquid and get nice and creamy so you may need to add about 20 minutes or so to the cooking time. It's better if you don't rush it.

I did love this recipe, HOWEVER: the recipe doesn't say it, but I think that the dish will look a lot more appetizing if you brown the sausage. The recipe also doesn't say to cut the sausage, I did.  Brown the sausage FIRST (either cut or whole) and THEN add the onions and continue the recipe as written. I Didn't use the peas because of food allergies.

I decided to take a stab at risotto for the first time on a whim, and this turned out delicious!  I used sun-dried tomato chicken sausage from Trader Joe's instead, which gave it a very nice flavor.  My husband loved it too and this will definitely be saved as a recipe to try again.  One thing I would mention is that it took longer than 15 minutes for the 3 cups of chicken broth to be absorbed, and when it finally was, it was tender and creamy enough that I didn't need to add more broth.

Loved this risotto.  I didn't use the wine just all chicken stock and it turned out great.  I had my chicken stock in a separate pan on the stove and added it hot into my risotto pan.

This is a good and easy Risotto recipe; if you have never attempted Risotto before start here.  15 minutes to cook the Arborio rice is probably not enough, you need all the liquid absorbed and the rice to be al dente.  To get that creamy texture closer to 25 minutes worked for me, don't rush it.  I would also suggest breaking up the sausage so that the pieces are just a little bigger than pea size.  Enjoy.  Now go try some of the other delicious Risotto recipes on allrecipes.com because I know you will be hooked.

Tasty recipe.  I didn't have chicken sausage so I used chicken breast and added some sausage seasonings and it was still great.  The risotto didn't do as nicely cooking with the meat so next time I'll do them separately and mix them together at the end.

When are you supposed to cut the sausage?  Also, what could you substitute for the wine?  I used chicken broth and recipe was tasty.  Just a reminder for the good cooks contributing recipes to leave in details for us beginners.  THanks!

Due to the availability of the fresh sausage in my area I substituted fully cooked Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage. I browned them in the pan before thinly slicing and quartering the sausage. I continued on with the rest of the recipe as is using orzo in place of Aborio rice and adding the sausage back in when the orzo was done. I do have to say, though, that 15 minutes cooking time is a tad too long for orzo.  I am glad I read the directions before starting or I may have missed the parmesan and parsley. I used freshly grated parmesan cheese as well as fresh parsley. This was good but not sure if I would make it again using the saugage - maybe without. Love the ease of the recipe.

I used uncooked Sweet Italian Chicken sausage and omitted the oil.  I also used about twice the amount of thyme that was called for (it might have helped to read the amount before automatically using one teaspoon) and it turned out great.  We loved this recipe, and will definitely make this again.

This recipe is AMAZING!!!  Even my super-picky 6 year old loved it.  I didn't have any white wine on hand so I just upped the chicken broth.  The parmesan cheese listed in the recipe isn't in the ingredients, but I just stirred in 1/2 cup with peas.  So, SO good.  Will definitely make again and again and recommend to friends!

This was an excellent first-timers shortcut version of risotto.  The sausage gave it an amazing flavor.  I did have to substitute regular jasmine rice in place of the arborio rice because that's what I had on hand, so I ended up using 4 cups of chicken broth to get the rice tender.  The Parmesan and parsley mentioned in the directions are not included in the ingredient list, so I just added the 1/4 cup of Parmesan to the dish and then sprinkled a little more on each individual serving.  I left the parsley out because I didn't have any on hand.  All of us went back for second helpings and my husband told me I could make this dish again any time I wanted, which I'm sure will be often!

I was looking for a recipe that I could use some chicken spinach feta sausage in, and this sounded pretty good. I've never really made risotto, but I had some arborio rice so I gave it a shot. I also used broccoli instead of pease, and it turned out fabulous. This will diffinitely make it's way into the normal rotation.

This was good.  I make risotto often and this was a very good combo.  Beware, however, that the recipe calls for Parmesan Cheese, Parsley and Black Pepper to finish the dish and they are not called out in the ingredient list.  You will need them to round out the flavors of this dish.  If you use the shopping list feature, they do not transfer over.

I wasn't sure about this dish at first because the color was a bit off, but once it was ready to serve, it all came together and was terrific.  I believe that the color was  due to the chicken broth I used.  I was making the simple whole roasted chicken recipe from the AR site and made the broth from the parts from the insde of the roaster.  It was as fresh as it gets w/ no salt and a ton of flavor from the onion, celery,peppercorns, and bay leaf .  I also removed the fat from it prior to adding it in and it was outstanding. 

 I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding in some sliced mushrooms that I had on hand.  It was incredible and soooo worth the time and effort.  The sausage was a delicious addition!  This is a keeper!

We really weren't blown away with this. It was OK, but won't make our regular rotation. Like others, it was my first time making risotto and I was intimidated, but followed the recipe (except for timing - mine took about 45 minutes) and the consistency was right on. We definitely liked the Al Fresco sausages and will use them again, just not for this recipe. - Oh, and there's no mention of Parmesan or Parsley in the ingredient list, so don't forget them when you make your grocery list.

this was such a fabulously fresh and different dinner for my family tonight!  i made changes that suit our tastes better, including to nix the peas and i used all chicken broth because i don't have wine in the house.  i also mixed in a half cup of parm at the end, didn't put any additional cheese on top - the directions/ingredient list needs to be fixed, as written it's incomplete.  but all in all this was a really great tasting risotto, very easy to make, and mild enough of a flavor for my kids to enjoy, but still tasty enough for the adults too.  thanks!

Having cooked risotto for years (first learnt in High school) I thought this recipe was just average.  I did add a few mushrooms and some sweetcorn to the dish.  The sausages I find are not really to my families likeing, the consistancy is so unlike a regular sausage.  Glad I tried this recipe, just not sure I will be making it again

This recipe turned out really well!  I used chicken-spinach-Asiago sausage from Sam's Club, regular white rice, and a sweet Moscato wine (because that is what I like to drink).  A little salty so next time I think I'll use low-salt chicken broth instead of regular.  I left out the black pepper.  I followed a reviewer's suggestion to add 1/2 cup of broth at a time, simmer until absorbed, stir and add another 1/2 cup, etc.  Sounds like a lot of trouble, but it wasn't.  I made a salad at the same time and kept an eye on it.  By the time the green salad with broccoli, green onion, and tomato was made, the risotto was about done.  I usually try the recipe as written, but I didn't want to risk this not turning out well and the slow addition of broth sounded more like traditional method of making risotto.
My girls do not like peas, so they'd give this two stars.  The one or two bites without peas got five stars.  Maybe next time I'll only toss in half a cup of peas.  One cup puts several peas in every bite.

This made a delicious lunch for me!  I cut it down in size quite a bit because only two of us were going to eat this, and I did leave out the peas (personal preference).  I did cut the sausage into smaller pieces.  This is an easy way to learn how to use arborio rice, as its consistency is quite different from the other types.  I'd recommend this for anyone who likes sausage in a meal!

This was an alright risotto.  I got a 12 oz package of sweet Italian Chicken Sausage from Trader Joes, and only used 3 of the 5 sausages, and it was a ton.  Other than that I kept the ingredients the same (used about 1/2 cup of parmesan).  The flavors were fine, but nothing too exciting.  This was easy and came together pretty quickly.  I don't think I'd make this one again - I much preferred the bacon risotto recipe from this site or a butternut squash one I also make.

Great recipe. I made it as directed. The dish took more like an hour to reach perfect risotto consistency. I added the three cups chicken broth all at once. I was tempted to do it one cup at a time like other reviewers mentioned is typical for risotto, but this worked like a charm! My family loved it. My daughter asked me to put in more peas next time ;). I served this dish with a fresh garden salad with a light oil and vinegar dressing. Yummy! It's a winner! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I couldn't find the raw Italian chicken sausage, so I used the sundried tomato and basil one. Being that it was already cooked it required less cookin time..so if I make this again and use the same sausage, I would brown and then add it back in the risotto the last 10 minutes. I added a little pepper and italian seasoning, fresh parsley to the risotto at the last. Served wiith parmesan, it was a big hit with my family.

This was Awesome!  I have never had (or made) Risotto before.. but this sounded so good that I thought I'd try it.  I'm glad I did!  It came out perfect (Chef Ramsey would be proud!)  I really was expecting something bland (after all it IS rice) but this actually had a lot of flavor and I was surprised at how good it tasted.  I paired it with some fresh baked warm bread and butter and we had it for dinner.   My husband loved it too. I WILL be making it again!

Pretty good. Used moscato instead of Chardonnay, didn't use thyme (just didn't have any), minute rice, and not as much chicken stock.  It was still very good.

Loved it! I've dabbled with a couple risottos, never quite coming out "right" so to say (especially the Milanese!) and often tasting to much of parmasan. This was absolutely fantastic though! As with many people, I did change a couple ingredients. I couldn't find chicken sausage, so I went with veal (went superbly with the thyme), also, I was never a big fan of onions so I tried a large shallot instead and it was PERFECT! Definitely going to cook this up again!

Delicious recipe.  I used regular long-grain rice and I left out the thyme, but it didn't make a difference.  Great combination of ingredients.  My favorite risotto recipe.

This recipe was a great intro to risotto. I used honey-garlic sausage instead of chicken sausage (couldn't find any), and also used sherry instead of white wine as that was what I had. Great recipe, everyone loves it!

Mixed reviews in our house.  I used the Al Fresco garlic sausages, instead of the Italian ones, and regretted it.  Hubby liked the risotto, but not the rice.  My sister liked the whole thing, especially the sausages.  I disliked the risotto, but thought the sausages were OK.  My son liked it, daughter didn't.  I followed some of the reviews and added the broth slowly, about a cup at a time, and let it simmer until reduced, then added more.  I made my own version of white wine (no alcohol in this house) - mostly chicken broth, a splash of white wine vinegar, and some Worcheshire Sauce.  The only other change I made was that I used broccoli instead of peas, as the peas I bought for this got used.  Hubby was disappointed when I said that I would not be making this recipe again.

Loved this and it was my first risotto. I cooked it in a dutch oven pan and only had canned peas to add at the end but it was plenty flavorful and very creamy.

I thought this tasted good. I cooked it on my burner on 6 the whole time. The onions and sausage took 12 minutes instead of the 3, at the beginning. A pan with 3" sides worked fine for everything. Like other arborio rice recipes, I have tried with wine, the alcohol taste seemed to still linger. However, the sweet chicken Italian sausage kind of cut through that taste some. It was the perfect compliment. Only change I made was adding a pinch or two of garlic and onion powder. This is not a repeat dish, as I just don't care for rice and wine, but it made a descent Friday evening dinner.

This was very easy to prepare. I enjoyed the flavor of it, and using the white wine in addition to chicken stock was really enhancing. I used Orzo on hand and it cooked just the same. I also served it with tomato slices, feeling that a bit more color was needed. LOVE the chicken sausage in it!

Overall good recipe. Told the kids who don't like rice that it was risotto and they ate it all!  I used raw sweet italian sausage but next time I would do 1 pound sweet and 1 pound hot italian sausage and double the recipe.It was really good.  Quick and easy!

This was much better than expected!  Although, I used the Garlic & Herb Chicken Sausage because my husband doesn't care for the Sweet Italian Chicken because of its strong fennel flavor.  I only used half the wine, and used homemade chicken stock instead of commercial broth.  Just a note, this makes good-sized portions.  I made half the recipe with just 2 sausages and we had it as a main dish with green salad, but if you want to make it as a side dish you could stretch the portions perhaps twice as far.

This dish was good,  but not spectacular. The directions were lacking for anyone who may not have made risotto before, but luckily I had so I knew the method and didn't need to worry about the directions. Read the AR recipe for Gourmet Mushroom Risotto for better directions.  I will make this one again but with some tomatoes maybe or asparagus. We just felt something was lacking.

It tastes really good if you use Chicken Turkey sausage flavoured with pineapple and bacon.
You can make a side of grilled zucchini and roasted garlic.

Followed directions, did not use peas, turned out very good. This is my first attempt using chicken sausage .. something mother never ever bought.  Removed the casings before frying, something I always do with any sausage.  Easy to make, one pot and turned out very tasty. You can't go wrong when you add cheese to a dish.  So delish.

This is an easy wonderful recipe!  Especially if you are scared of making risotto.  This is a pretty fool proof recipe.  I had Italian Sausage, so I pulled the casing off and added a tablespoon of sugar.  It was divine!  This would be a great recipe for a football get together or for a cold winter night.  I will definitely be making this one again!

My choice of sausage was not the best.  I could not find the sweet Italian sausage.  I think I prefer risotto without meat.  The cheese and veggies would have been fine with me.  I used a nice Chardonnay that added a nice touch.  Without the sausage would make a nice side to grilled chicken seasoned with some Italian spices.

Very good risotto! I played with it a bit, though: I made it vegetarian by using lentils instead of sausage and using vegetable broth; I used brown rice (which meant longer simmering time, of course) and peas and carrots instead of just peas.

I've seen risotto made on TV many times but had never made it or eaten it.  I love rice.  But this recipe did nothing for me.  I'm not sure what all the excitement is all about.  I won't be making this again.  I did not alter the recipe at all except to cut it in half.

I felt the need to write a review to say that I used other ingredients and this was still a great recipe - hence the five star rating. I doubled the recipe and used what I had on hand (don’t fault me we’re in the middle of a pandemic) which was one mild and one sweet sausage and basmati brown and red rice. I cannot wait to try to real recipe but enjoying my concoction just the same.

Well, none of us were hungry when we were done.  However, no one was jumping for joy over this recipe either.  Maybe it was my handy work, or I just didn't know what to expect, but I found the texture to be too thick and heavy and the flavor was lackluster.

This was delicious - followed several other reviewer's recommendations - replaced wine with low sodium salt.  We also couldn't find the sweet chicken sausage, and replaced with mild Italian.  You actually could easily swap your favorite meat or veggie with this.  This too was my first time to make risoto - followed another reviewer's suggestion to add 1 cup of broth at a time and let it absorb - perfection!

Loved it! This would work with any sausage or even more veggies. I substituted broccoli instead of peas but otherwise made it as directed. Yummy flavors and just enough crunch from the onions. Yummy!
