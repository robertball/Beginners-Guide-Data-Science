5+++ My guests LOVED this!!  I shredded a roasted chicken from the grocery store and mixed it with Balsamic & Basil salad dressing, some baby spinach leaves and sun dried tomatoes.  Spooned it on top of toasted baguette slices and sprinkled it generously with feta cheese.  I am vegetarian and didn't eat it but everyone else gobbled it up, including my hubby who tried to sneak as many as possible before my girlfriends came over!  I will keep this one for sure-almost everyone asked for the recipe!

I debated reviewing this, because I changed the serving method, but it's really good, so I wanted to rate it.  I wanted to make it as a main dish, so i followed the recipe, but instead of serving on toasted bread, I made it into wraps.  Yummy.  My husband twice commented on how good they were.  I actually preferred to place a bit of chicken, tomoatoe, and cheese on a spinach leaf and roll it.  Thanks for a great recipe.  This healthy dish (lite Italian dressing, reduced fat cheese) will become a staple at our house for a quick and easy weeknight meal.

Of all the recipes I've made so far (mostly from Allrecipes.com), this is clearly my dinner guests' favorite.  I tear apart a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken warm from the supermarket instead of preparing the chicken in the way specified in the recipe, but otherwise follow the recipe pretty closely.  Still having trouble with the toast part, though.  Sometimes I just serve it on untoasted bread.

This is WAY yummy!  I thought it would be  good, but it so exceeded my expectations.  I didn't have any italian dressing, so I made some with olive oil, balsamic, and chopped olives and garlic.  Awesome!!

My kids even liked it!! I made it simple by putting all the ingredients on a thin Boboli-type pizza crust. Had enough leftover topping to put on smaller crust, too.

I really enjoyed this for a summer lunch. I used leftover grilled chicken. Drizzled olive oil over the petite french bread loaf slices before toasting. Added crushed walnuts and chopped the spinach into small pieces.

This recipe is great! So versatile. I decided to use roma tomatoes instead of sun-dried and it worked magnificently. It had such a fresh taste! I took the advice of many others and used a rotisserie chicken from the store and diced it up into small pieces. It had many great comments at our New Year's party. I'll definitely be making this again - and maybe I'll even try a few additional ideas to it! :)

This was a great base for a recipe, I didn't follow this recipe to a T because I didn't have focaccia bread on hand. I used four slices of frontier bread (its baked locally from whole foods) another thing I changed was adding only a little bit of the feta to the mix and having slices of melted cheese to the bread while it was on the grill. In the mixture, I added basil and artichoke hearts which I thought completed the bruschetta taste. I will be making this again, just with a few tweaks. Thank you for this recipe!

To make a quick lunch, I used already cooked grilled chicken and added the Italian dressing to the mixture. Great flavors, looks great too.

Great Recipe. I had just baked a Onion/Caroway Rye. I toasted it and used it instead of Focaccia . Great flavor. My wife added cream cheese to hers also. I used leftover smoked chicken from our weekend BBQ This recipe has many varibles and possiblities. this is what cooking is all about.

I love this recipe. I was in a hurry so I threw a cooked chicken breast, olive oil and the rest of the ingredients in a food processer. It turned out great. I added fresh cilantro for garnish.

What a great recipe! I didn't follow the directions exactly, I used precooked, seasoned chicken and I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes without oil, so I drained them well before adding them. I added a little less spinach than was directed, but it was absolutely delicious anyway! These were a hit with my family and co-workers!

This recipe was great, delicious and easy to make! we loved it... as a matter of fact we prepared it about 3 times this weekend!  When we ran out of focaccia we used regular sliced bread and it was still great.... I added some regular tomatoes for added freshness

sooooo delicious and so easy. The only thing I did different was that I cooked the chicken in a wok, it makes it so juicy and grilling in January just isn't very practical. I also used a really yummy sun dried tomato bread. This will definitely be made over and over again.

Excellent recipe!  Will definitely make again.  I baked the chicken for 8 minutes, added the sauce mixture and finished baking until the chicken was cooked completely.  I think baking the sauce into the chicken gave it a richer flavor.  This recipe was enjoyed by my entire family!

This was fantastic!!! My husband and 6 year old daughter loved it! There was never a doubt that I wouldn't like it but when I have my husband and at least one of the kids, its a winner.  I used kraft italian dressing and made the sun-dried tomatoes myself. I can't wait to have a party to try it out on friends!

Really good! I made this at my parents' house. They are really low key when it comes to meals. My dad loved it! My mom took some convincing to make it but ended up liking it a lot. We had it over toast.

This was amazing.  Instead of using this as an appetizer, I made it a main course.  I used Ciabatta bread, and toasted slices of those.  I put the mixture on this, and ate with a fork and knife.  It was amazing and filling.  The chicken really absorbed the dressing.  I also added my own spices to the marinade.  But the best thing about this... leftovers!  It was even better the day after, as the bread did not go soggy, and the flavors mingled even more!

I wasn't too sure by the small number of ingredients, but it really hit the spot!  "Awesome" according to my husband.  I used Ciabatta bread, light Italian dressing, and threw in a chopped tomato also.  Will definitely be making this again!

I substituted grilled portabella mushroom instead of chicken, and used sourdough bread.  It was great.

Such a good combination of ingredients to mix together! We ran out of foccacia bread so people started looking around for other food to top the bruschetta with! Some people even started eating it like a salad! Overall, very satisfying and I will make it many more times.

This was delicious and a big hit at our appetizer party!  I only had sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil so I patted those dry and used that.  It worked just fine.  I also used a rotisserie chicken and skip the marinating step.  We will definitely make this again!

I don't know if this is an "aquired taste" or what but I didn't like it at all.  I did substitue the marinated chicken with the store bought rotisserie chicken so I don't know if that made a difference but I will NOT be making this again.  eek!

Dee-Lish!  Perfect for a filling, but light summer dinner.  My husband and I loved it.  I added a little garlic salt to the toast, but aside from that, I followed the directions.  I hope to make this for my parents when they visit.

This was good, but I must say I wasn’t wild about it.  My only deviation from the recipe was to add a shredded provolone/mozzarella blend to the mix.  I then popped it under the broiler to melt the cheese.  I added the cheese hoping to “glue” the ingredients together, so they wouldn’t fall off as easily when eating it.  It worked for me.  I thought the amount of sun-dried tomatoes in this was a little skimpy (or maybe mine were just small), but  I would add more next time.

I made this dish because I thought it was something different and sounded yummy.  It exceeded my expectations.  It was fabulous and full of flavor!  My husband loved it! The focaccia bread made it all come together.  I'll be cooking this again very soon!

I LOVE this mix!  I made a meal out of this and sliced the foccacia bread lengthwise and threw in the panini maker.  HELLO!  Next time I'll add more cheese, maybe swiss or cheddar.  Great recipe, THANKS!

This was very good! I followed the recipe to the T- marinated and grilled the chicken before I shredded it, and mixed into the topping. I refrigerated it until I needed to serve the next day. I used French sticks which I lightly toasted on one side in the oven before topping off, and then popped back into the oven again for a few more minutes. The feta cheese, sund reid tomatoes, and the Italian dressing add a nice punch to the mix. I laid out two trays of these for my guests and they were all gone by the end of the night. This is a very good appetizer for large crowds- easy to make too!

Super yum - and so simple!  I used goat's cheese instead of feta because it was all i had, and it still turned out great.  I also served it mixed up with pasta instead of on bread.  I wish I had made more, it would make a really good leftover cold pasta salad.

We used a rotisserie chicken and shredded it- also used sun dried tomatoes in oil and just drained them.  Used Newman's light roasted garlic balsamic dressing and crumbled feta on top- these got gobbled up in no time and were a hit!!  Will be using these for every bbq I attend now!!

This was so simple and so delicious!  Nice and light, perfect for a summer lunch or dinner.  It was a huge hit at my card party and I passed the recipe on to several people. I served it with the focaccia bread but it was just as yummy by itself.  All the flavors worked wonderfully together.  I could not find sun dried tomatoes without oil so I used ones packed with oil and it turned out fine.

OMG!!!! This was so good!!!  I actually took the advice of others and turned it into a wrap.  I added sunflower seeds and toasted the wrap in a George Forman Grill for a mintue or so.  Great recipe.  You can't go wrong with sun-dried tomatoes and feta cheese.  Whole family loved it!

All the other reviews are correct.  This is a great recipe.  It travels well too.  I made it in the morning and refrigerated it fora few hours.  We then took it with us out of town (about a 3 hr. drive) and it was still fantastic.  I was afraid it would be too soggy from the dressing, but no problems.  Everyone loved it!

An absolutely wonderful recipe!  My wife and I love to eat this with the grilled focaccia bread!  It always comes out really great!  I always add pine nuts to the salad as well which adds a nice little crunch!

This is fantastic, I've made it several times - always get compliments and requests for the recipe.  After playing around with it a few times, I found a few things works best:  Use sun dried tomatoes that are not in oil, usually come in a bag in the produce section.  I prefer using Wish Bone or Ken's Balsamic Vinaigrette for the marinade and Good Seasons Italian Dressing to pour over the ingredients at the end.  I also think the Sun Dried Tomato Feta cheese is the best to use.  If you are pressed for time and can find Noni's garlic toast, use that instead of toasting the bread.  As another reviewer said, it is not just an appetizer.  I've made this as a wrap or into a panini - thanks for a great recipe!

The meat was so good after the marinade that I just ended up serving it with the salad mix along side of it and the bread with a little Balsamic Vinegar for an amazingly great dinner.  I could have mixed it all together but people were raving about the meat - so I just took the shortcut.  Good stuff!

I made this recipe for a party and WOW! what a hit it was.  I did substitute sundried tomatoes with roasted garlic (found on the olive bar of our local supermarket) and I used peppercorn feta instead of regular.  This recipe went over big-time (even with some picky eaters!)

I planned to make this on the grill tonight, as the recipe states, however Mother Nature had other plans (it's downpouring!).  Instead, I baked the marinated chicken breasts in the oven for 25 minutes and then, topped them with the fresh spinach, feta and sundried tomatoes and drizzled a little more dressing on top of it all.  AWESOME, restaurant quality dish!!  I will definitely try it next time, as the recipe states, but I wouldn't change the way I did it either!

Just made this for a staff Christmas party and served it on warmed ciabatta bread.  I added basil like other reviewers mentioned and that is a MUST, it pops all the other flavors.  I also added 1/4 cp olive oil to blend it all together.  This was a huge hit and the leftovers keep well and are awesome!

Delicious! I followed the recipe and had some left overs which I added miracle whip to and made chicken salad sandwiches. I will make this again but next time double the recipe so I can make the sandwiches again.

Amazing recipe. Made for dinner one night, sandwich style, husband loved it! I did add a handful of chopped basil to this though, because to me basil IS bruschetta. Making tonight for engagement party, doubling recipe.

This was a great and easy recipe!  We served it on sun dried tomato bread and didn't add the additional dressing.  It takes longer to make (including the marinade time) than the recipe says- so be sure you plan plenty of time for it.  We'll definitely make this again, maybe add some fresh basil to it too.

This was spectacular, and can't wait to make again. I didn't have Italian dressing so I used a Greek dressing and marinated the chicken overnight. I made a meal out of these by placing each ingredient in it's own dish, and let everyone make their own wraps. Oh! I also added chopped Kalamata olives. Served with fruit.

I made this bruschetta for a lunch with a friend and we both agreed it was interesting at best. Neither of us cared for the sun dried tomatoes in it and agreed it would be a wonderful recipe with fresh chopped tomatoes in place of the sun dried variety. I will try the recipe again without the sun dried tom's next time.

Gotta give it 5 stars, even though the bread did cut up my mouth! I added walnuts & some garlic to my mixture. We wound up eating it kind of like a salad, with the toasted bread on the side. It was very good, and I will make it again, only next time I will not get my bread so dry--ouch!

This was wonderful!  We had it for dinner on a hot summer day. I used my food processor to get the ingredients 'chopped' and 'shredded' since I was short on time and mommy-ing two kids. It was quick and easy.  I used my indoor grill for the chicken and a toaster oven for the asiago cheese bread.  Long story short, both of the children, 5yr and 12 mo, had seconds and thirds.  Mom, too!

Five stars are not enough for this recipe.  I agree with others that this dish can be many things: appetizer, sandwich or salad.  I just grilled a couple chicken breasts, without marinating and used some spring mix that I had on hand. I cut it finely with my kitchen shears and added the small amount of Italian dressing (1/4 cup) which was just the right amount to moisten all the recommended ingredients. Next time I might use GodivaGirl's suggestion and add chopped walnuts too.  The grilled foccacia bread was out of this world.  We love, love, loved this!  Thank you for a great recipe.

Your recipe inspired me to make this stuffed chicken version and it was amazing!! We're on the 17 day diet and not eating breads, so here's what I did.

I marinaded the chicken in fat free italian dressing for a few hours, then pounded it out to a thin, even thickness (to be stuffed) - discard remaining dressing.

Mix together 1/2 a package of thawed frozen chopped spinach, 1 package feta cheese (I used tomato basil), 2-3 big tablespoons of sun dried tomatoes in olive oil, a little pinch of parmesan and drizzle of fat free italian dressing to coat.

Place in the center of the chicken. Roll up. Secure with toothpicks. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and a little fat free mozzarella.

Bake at 350 for 45 minutes in lightly sprayed 9x13 pan. Baste once with juices and turn to broil the last 5-8 min for color.

F.A.N.T.A.S.T.I.C!!!!!

Thanks for the idea! We will definitely make again!

Yummy!  Make it with left over chicken and use different types of bread, french, italian...   It doesn't matter cause the flavor is in the chicken mixture.   Add other stuff like olives or grape tomatoes, you can't mess up this one.  
I love bread and cheese and olive oil, you don't need anything else.  The added ingredients just makes it a party in your mouth.

Used the mixture to stuff chicken breasts.  Just pounded the chicken breasts out thin, combined the rest of the ingredients (minus bread) and baked.  Delicious!

This is by far one of the best recipes I have found on this site. It was storming so I did not get to grill the chicken and bread. I cooked the chicken on the stove and toasted the bread in the over. Other than the that I followed the recipe as written. It was fantastic! A huge hit! Definitely a keeper. We are going to the beach in May and this will be on our lunch menu.

YUMMMO! I just used a french stick well the thicker kind. Only bread this recipe called for had other ingredients. We thought it worked great. I did much much less for the spinach and honestly it worked just as good. I might have used maybe a cup?? More isnt necessary for smaller pieces of bread. Also we did chopped vine tomatoes. Big hit at party!!!

Made this as part of a Mediterranean themed outdoor party. (Also did the grilled peaches with honey cream cheese from this site, and some grilled figs stuffed with  blue cheese and wrapped in prosciutto, and a caprese salad and some grilled vegies).  I used a garlic infused olive oil to brush the bread, and then rubbed the grilled slices with a cut clove as well. YUM! Everyone loved this.

my modifications: 1. Like others I simply shredded a grocery store rotisserie chicken 2. Added about 1/2 cup of fresh chopped basil 3. Omitted olives (i'm just not a fan) 4. Used a balsamic basil vinaigrette  This was so good and was gone so fast!  Will make again and again

This was AMAZING!!! We had wheat hoagie loafs cut in half and then sliced open made into garlic bread. We ate this as sandwiches and it was phenomenal. We also added a little of the garlic butter to the italian dressing that the chicken was cooked in.

This was so awesome! Even all the kids ate it up. The only problem with it is that I never get to bring any home with me! I have made it twice now and it was really great.

On my favorite list.  I happened to have some Greek grilled chicken, and used French Feta (milder than Greek Feta) and made my own balsamic vinegar dressing.  It was such a hit, my mother-in-law requested I make her some extra to take home!!!  Excellent, next time I'll trying adding fresh basil and kalamata olives.

This turned out to be awesome.  There are very smart cooks reviewing on this website!  :-)  I used a whole wheat baguette, leftover shredded chicken from cinco de mayo (yesterday) and goat cheese instead of feta.  My partner and strongest critic (we both love to cook!) said "SAVE THAT RECIPE!".  We are visiting friends on Friday and will be taking this with us!

The ingredients were a bit intimidating and I wasn't sure if I would like it. But it was really yummy and its sure to impress house guests. We ate it for dinner not as an appetizer but as a main meal and it filled my husband up. I will make this again. The only downside was the sun dried tomotoes are a bit on the expensive side, so it will have to do for special occasions only.

we LOVED these. Very easy to make, and scrumptious! a few notes: i forgot to buy feta at the grocery store, so i just used mozzerella, which worked fine. instead of making bruschetta, we grilled foccacia rolls and made sandwiches for a full meal.

I'll be the critic here.
Feta? Noooooo way...
The overall result is Ok, no complaints. But also NO praises.
Remove feta and add fresh basil, and your bruschetta will be lighter in taste. And WILL earn you some praises.

My husband and I loved this. I had half of a rotisserie chicken leftover, so I used that and mixed it with a Marzetti White Balsamic Dressing. I didn't toast the focaccia bread, but I spread both pieces with Tuscan Cream Cheese Spread(from this site)before adding the sandwich ingredients.  I wrapped the whole thing in foil and warmed it at 350.
I will make this when the college kids are home for break.  Thanks for an easy and different sandwich!

This is so Good! I don't know how to cook very many things, but this is really hard to mess up unless you burn the chicken. I used sourdough like the other user and it was superb.

I introduced this new rexcipe to my friends.   A crowd of about 20.  They all loved it!  I have a station set up with multiple items to use with this recipe.  Chibatta bread toasted, large whole grain crackers, and baguette rounds.  Very very good and fresh tasting!  I put it in a large bowl and everyne fixed it on their choice of bread/crackers.  Will be fixing for the next party too!

Very good ! I served as appetizers . The only change I made was instead of using feta (which I didn't have any on hand)  I used jalapeño cream cheese.. Turned out terrific if u like spicy.

TIP if you are cutting out bread: Make the recipe as is but reserve several chicken breasts. Spread a layer of cream cheese over the breast and place bruschetta on top. Yum!

Serving size:  4  Ken loved it.

Thaw 1/2 frozen chicken breast in cold water.
Once thawed slice in half (the long way).
Pour 1/8 C salad dressing onto chicken (use plate) and cover with saran wrap.  Marinade for 3 hrs in fridge.

Once marinated, place each slice on Foreman Grill until done.  Cool and shred.

OR while waiting for chicken to marinate...

In large bowl mix :
chicken, 
1 1/4 C fresh spinich (torn) - recipe asked for 2C but it seemed like too much, 
cubed mozzarella (by hand), 
10 chopped (by hand) grape tomatoes and 
remainder of dressing.

Slice bread in 1/2 inch thick slices.  Place on Forman Grill for 1 min.  Brush olive oil onto each slice and then add mixture on top.

Serve with a noodle salad.

Our entire family, kids and all, love this recipe. We enjoy it as a main course. There's just something about it that makes this recipe seem like a special weeknight meal. Can also be served as a salad by coarsely chopping the grilled bread and tossing all ingredients in a serving bowl.

This was easy and delicious.  All of my family loved it too.  I put olive oil in the skillet and pan-seared the bread to get it a little brown on the edges, placed the chicken/spinach/cheese/tomato mixture on top.  It was amazing and easy.

Excellent idea!  Added a little fresh basil, cilantro, and used fresh roma tomatoes. Served it on Italian bread that was brushed w/ olive oil and a dash of garlic salt then grilled with the chicken.  To think..... my girlfriend said she was getting tired of grilled food! She loved it.

I am not a huge chicken fan and I LOVED THIS!  Very fresh!  The next day we ate it cold and it was amazing again... we just added in more fresh spinach.  Will make this again and again...

This was amazing.  People asked for the recipe at a cocktail party.  I would eat this for a main course for lunch.  On a side note- I forgot a had another tray in the fridge and found them 2 days later and they were still delicious.  They didn't get soggy.  You could make this the night before and serve the next day.

I made this for dinner as a main course. Instead of Italian dressing, I used Garlic Expressions, (bottled marinade and dressing found in produce) and instead of sun-dried tomatoes I used fresh cherry tomatoes. Ate the leftovers for lunch the next day. I also used a mix baby spinach and arugula.  Yummy, yummy recipe! I'll make again!

It was delicious and easy to make.  Amazing how tender the Italian dressing rendered the chicken.  I didn't add the cheese, only because I'm not a cheese person.  Will definitely make it again.

I brought these appetizers to a party and it was enjoyed by all.  I did make a few minor changes. Instead of bottled Italian dressing, I used a greek marinade for the chicken (olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, paprika), added about 1/4 cup chopped kalamati olives and an organic baguette for the bread.  I also think this would be delicious in a pita as others have suggested!

Every time I make this for a gathering it's the first thing finished and I get so many compliments and requests for the recipe. I can't always find the bread that is recommended in the recipe but any flat bread works great.
