Excellent and perfect for a "fix-it and forget it" recipe! I added a little minced garlic and chopped onion while browning the ground beef and opted for sweet Italian sausage. For the marinara sauce I used "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site (sorry Classico) that I had frozen as it's one of my favorites and is perfect for just this type of recipe. I didn't use cheddar cheese as I really didn't think it paired well so instead I used shredded Parmesan. Wonderful served with a fresh garden salad and warm bread!

If you make it the way I did, I promise you will love it! I used a pound of sausage, ommited the ground beef, and mushrooms. You can use any sgetti sauce you like just add the following: Italian seasonings, minced garlic, a couple bay leaves and onions. Season with salt and pepper to your liking. I also added one extra package of tortellinis. It was a perfect amount. This is super yummy!

This can't be messed up. I had my 12yr old daughter just dump the cans. While I cooked the meat. I have a picky spouse and this even made him smile. We even had left overs with 2 teen in the house :)

This recipe is SO GOOD and SO EASY! I have made it twice and only thing I changed about the recipe was omitting the mushrooms because I don't care for them. I don't really see the need to cook this for a full 7-8 hours in the slow cooker. I cooked it for about 5.5-6 hours and it was just fine. After adding in the tortellini, I sprinkled a pretty generous amount of cheddar and mozzarella cheese covering the top of the mixture and by the time the tortellini was cooked, the cheese was melted just the right amount. No complaints here!

There was no where near enough pasta.  We ended up cooking a box of spaghetti to serve this over.  It tasted fine, nothing out of this world...

Husband was IN LOVE with this (as I made it with modifications) and keeps asking when I will make it again. I used a pound of sausage and skipped the beef. I added a bag of spinach and doubled the tortellini. I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes instead of slow cooking it. I was afraid the tortellini would turn to mush if I cooked it for several hours.

This was good, but not as good as I had hoped I think Ragu would have been more flavorful than the tomato sause mixture. Was much better with a piece of cheese garlic toast to add more flavor. But all in all kids liked it, and so did hubby.

This was good.  It just wasn't great.  I liked the idea of letting the meat slow cook on low with the tomatoes and the pasta sauce, but by 7 hours most of the liquidy sauce had evaporated leaving me with a thick, sticky coating on the tortellini.  It was still a decent meal - just didn't have the "wow" factor I was expecting.

I used this recipe as a base to make a pasta sauce that we could use throughout the week (we eat a LOT of pasta). I tripled the jars of sauce and omitted the mushrooms. I also added three large cloves of fresh garlic and half of a large onion. I had great luck with this recipe and will be using it repeatedly in the future.

I made this recipe just as written, although with out the mushroom soup, and enjoyed it very much. We used Turkey sausage to make the dinner a little healthier and everything tasted wonderfully.

I have made this recipe quite a few times.  It's delicious and tasty.  I use all ground beef.  Sometimes I like to use fresh mushrooms and chopped onions.  Great recipe for the slow cooker.  Finding the recipe again online gave me the idea of making it again, probably next week.  Thanks for the great suggestion.  (:)

Very quick and easy to toss together. I used 1lb of sausage and no hamburg, and a 16 oz package of tortellini. My slow cooker runs hot even only low setting. I only cooked for 4 hours. It was perfect!

I added garlic and onion to the ground beef/sausage mixture. There is not too many ingredients involved in this recipe and it made the prep time quick and easy. Everybody had two helpings!
