I have a similar recipe passed down in my family as well. Ours has only 2 cups of oatmeal. TIP: I find that oat bran works the best. (The original family recipe used scottish oatmeal and is very coarse) Also decrease the sugar to 3/4 of a cup. Increase the water to 1/3 cup. I think you will find the dough easier to work with. Really a wonderful cookie!

I was looking for a cookie recipe that would be similar to a "hobnob". This recipe, while less crunchy, was great. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt, which I believe is very important to the sweetness of any cookie. I used splenda brown sugar, and only used 1/2 cup. I really like oats, and to be able to chew on them, so I used whole oats, but crushed them a bit with my hands before using them so I wouldn't so much like a barnyard animal while eating the cookie! After I incorporated all the ingredients, I made the dough into balls, then pushed them down with the bottom of a glass. I then sprinkled the dough with coarse sugar. After baking for the full 15 minutes, they turned out wonderful!

Very good recipe.  I did add an egg to mine because I do like a nice chewy cookie, and 1 tsp vanilla.  I love vanilla in my oatmeal cookies, and they were great, co-workers at work absolutely loved them.

My eleven yr. old son picked this one because he doesn't like to fuss with a lot of ingredients. They definately taste like shortbread with an oatmeal twist. The only thing he did for the second batch was add a little more butter to keep them from crumbling apart. He generously shares them with his friends who says "they're the BEST"

These were okay, but didn't really taste like a shortbread to me.  I had to increase the water to 1/3 cup like the other reviewer suggested to make the dough workable.  They remind me of a plain oatmeal cookie.

Great, easy cookies, but not exactly what I'd call shortbread.  Taste more like really good granola bars.  They were a big hit with my holiday cookie swap and my second batch was even more delicious when I spread a bit of melted chocolate on top as they cooled.

These tasted good, but I must have missed something.  Mine turned out crumbly, not at all like a cookie.  More like a graham cracker crust.  Still, they are tasty.

Tasty, but a smidgen boring. Mine were crumbly too, they probably do need an egg to hold them together. I wouldn't make them for anyone by following the recipe exactly.

These are great. I must mention that I added one egg, 1 t. vanilla and 1/2 t. salt as others recommended, so I didn't make the "exact" recipe. Still, these were very tasty. A little crispy, a little soft. The vanilla really added a nice flavor. I mixed in some cinnamon to some of the dough before I baked the second tray and the cinnamon was a great addition. These will be nice cookies for the lunchboxes this week. And perhaps they are a teeny bit healthy with the oatmeal. ;-)

Very simple, very nice. A little bit crumbly to be cutting into shapes, although it held together enough to cut into strips. Good for dunking in tea, and I drizzled some with honey before cooking, which worked quite well. Yum!

We also were looking for a HobNobs-type recipe. These aren't exactly the same, but they are quite tasty! I had no trouble working with the dough and only added the 1/2 teaspoon of salt that one reviewer mentioned. I used half quick oats and half old-fashioned since that's what I had on hand. I think all old-fashioned would have been better.

Tastes great, and I was able to cut with cookie cutters, but I did have to add more water. I used a total of 2 Tbsp water...

I partially followed another reviewer of this recipe who  used 2 eggs, 1 tsp of cinnamon & 1 tsp of nutmeg. I added that like she did then followed the rest of the instructions on the actual recipe. I found them to be very easy to make. To me they seem like a cross between oatmeal cookies & shortbread cookies. They taste great! I will be making this again!

My husband is from the UK, so I am always looking for a good "Hobnob" recipe! I tried this one, and it is awesome. I used whole wheat flour instead of regular. Since I made these with wheat flour instead of regular, it is a bit drier. Instead of dissolving the soda in 1/2 teaspoon of water,  I dissolve it in about 1/4 cup of water. It should be a fairly dry dough, but moist enough to make a ball. Then  instead of rolling it out and cutting it with cookie cutters (which is a pain ), I make a small ball for each cookie, then I sort of flatten it out, so it's still thick, but a flattened ball. Bake them until they are a nice brown color, this makes them crispier! Awesome and somewhat healthy! Great with coffee!
