I made it half whole spelt flour and half Non GMO all purpose white flour.... mainly due to I didn't have enough spelt. I also added 2 TBS sugar and a splash of vanilla... I also used Sea Salt in stead of the pink. I used my own eggs from my chickens and since we're not dairy free, I used raw milk instead. My family loved it. We also topped it with home canned peach pie filling the last 5 minutes of cooking.

I liked the taste but was not crazy about the texture. I would make again if I have to please somebody with lactose intolerance. Otherwise, I will stick to my lactose-loaded recipe, which has less calories and nicer texture.
