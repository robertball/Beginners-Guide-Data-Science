Good southern recipe!  Here's a tip I found on another site to avoid the sliminess that okra produces:  Soak your okra in enough cold water to cover it, then squeeze in the juice of one lime and let your okra sit for 10 to 15 minutes before you cook it.  Best tip I've read plus it actually works!

A version of this has long been a family favorite. If you don't have the sausage, brown 1/2 to 1 lb of ground beef and add it along with 1-2 cups of cooked elbow macaroni. It will become an entire dish even without the meat.

I left out the sausage (because I didn't have any) and it came out very good. I can tell the sausage would make it perfect.

Simply SPECTACULAR!! I made it by the recipe to a T only adding a jalapeno because I like them and had some on hand.  Will add some chicken next time.  I seasoned with CREOLE SEASONING BLEND by Joslyn from this site. This is a well-balanced and delicious  combination and a great one-dish meal.

Yumm  A++ This is a great recipe to use up those garden veggies!  I cut the recipe in half because there's only 2 of us.  I added a couple of jalepenos and 1/2 of water plus all listed ingredients in a crockpot and let it simmer for a few hours. Thank you wasabinoir! PS: make some cornbread to go along with it!!

This was great!  We had never tried okra before, but had picked up some fresh ears of corn and okra from the local produce stand.  I only had 1/2 the amount of okra called for, and no sausage, but it was still delicious.  In place of the sausage we just substituted left over steak from last night's dinner.  I'm sure it is fantastic with the sausage, but it was really great with steak.  Husband, kids, and myself all had second helpings!  I'll definitely be making this again, although next time I'll plan ahead and get all the ingredients.

This was really easy to make and very delicious.  We will definitely be having this again.  The flavor was spicy, but not hot for hot's sake.  Cutting the standard recipe in half is enough for two with enough to spare for my lunch tomorrow!

Growing up in Houston, in an historically Acadiana family :-) , this was one of my favorite dishes as a teenager. We ate it without sausage, served over dirty rice. So, now that I'm a grown up living in Austin with easy access to fresh okra, I was so happy to find this recipe, I was prompted to write my first review! This was excellent -- I've made it twice. Both times without the corn (since I've never eaten it that way before). Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the T the first time -- and it was great! I brought it to work and made my fellow South Louisiana-heritage-turned-Texan coworkers jealous. The second time I skipped the celery, added bell pepper, bay leaves, and garlic. Still awesome! This recipe leaves a lot of room for improvisation while still being delicious. The key: okra and tomatoes. The acid from the tomatoes cuts the okra slime. Other than that, experiment!

I made this without the sausage due to allergies. This is a wonderful side dish. Okra, onions, and corn were fresh from my garden! The tomatoes were also homegrown, I canned them whole a few weeks ago, and the fresh flavors were amazing. Thanks for the wonderful fresh recipe!

This was sooo good! I omitted the butter and salt, and kept the andouille sliced instead of diced. I also used a little less corn (I only had canned), since I'm not a huge fan.

I'm a huge okra fan but my husband is not so keen on it but he really liked this recipe, so I'll definitely be making this one again.

My family loved this recipe! It definitely makes a lot though. I halved it the second time around and still had plenty of leftovers.  Used frozen corn and okra since it was out of season the first time and just easier the second.

This was delish!  easy to make and hearty enough for a meal in itself! ... And it freezes great too!(although, it didn't stay long in the freezer before being eaten!)  loved it!  didn't have any issues with slimey okra and I used fresh and frozen.

I made it without using the olive oil and I didn't have andouille but I did have some fresh chicken sausage and I used both frozen corn and okra seasoned with Tony's and a splash of cayenne, perfect!

i used frozen okra and corn, however, so that was probably the big problem with my attempt at this recipe! :(
