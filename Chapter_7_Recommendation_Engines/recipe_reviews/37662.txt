One of my new favorite recipes!  These are delicious!  I didn't have orange zest so I used 1 tsp of lemon juice.  I don't know if that really did anything.  I also added 1 c of semi-sweet chocolate chips because we are chocolate freaks over here :)  Topped with sprinkles to decorate for the holidays.  Thanks for sharing :)

I enjoyed these cookies and even had a request for the recipe.  Chewy and mild flavor.  I might add more orange flavoring next time.

Yum!  These are great cookies.  I can't possible see how the recipe can be tweaked at all.  They're perfect just the way they are!  Thanks for sharing!

They were not bad, but not a lot of flavor and too soft.

I make these every year for the holidays and everyone loves them!! The substitutions I make are using half a cup of butter and half a cup of shortening, this changes the texture and they are PERFECT; also, adding cinnamon and allspice.  Thanks.

Very yummy recipe.  I used orange extract instead of zest and they still taste great!  Love the texture too.

I don’t like sweet cookies so I only used 1 cup sugar but added 1 cup applesauce. I also only used 1/2 cup butter BUT I added about a Tblsp bacon fat —don’t knock it til you’ve tried it! (I only save the grease from uncured Whole30 approved bacon). I also added 1/2 cup Ghirardelli semisweet choc morsels. It’s a great recipe for our household.

These cookies are amazing exactly following the recipe. They are also very forgiving of substitutions and add-ins. as long as you follow the basic cookie recipe you can change your amount of oats, pecans, and coconut to suit what you lik or have on hand. I doubled the oatmeal and added a cup of chocolate chips to one batch and they still came out perfect. Also, these do not require a chilling period before baking- you can go straight from mixing to baking and they come out well. The cookie dough keeps well in my fridge for about four days when I need mix one night and bake on another.

Wanted to get out of my cookie rut rotation (oatmeal, chocolate chip, peanut butter) so I tried  these. Had all ingredients except orange peel so I used 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract. Wow- really, really good cookies but unfortunately the husband doesn't like them. More for me!

This is an excellent recipe. Very buttery and the coconut/vanilla/orange flavors make a wonderful combination. I cant wait to make these again!

I wasn't sure how this recipe was going to turn out since not many people tried it but it tastes great. I didn't have any pecans so I used almonds. It has a nice light orange flavouring but you could add more to make it stronger.

Very delicious. I used Splenda and Splenda Brown Sugar Blend in place of regular sugar, sliced almonds, and a tsp of almond extract. It was hard to tell when they were finished because they stayed soft and didn't brown. They also didn't flatten like the picture. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to flatten them first or not.
