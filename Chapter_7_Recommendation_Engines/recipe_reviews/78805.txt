This sounds wonderful. I'll be taking this to a potluck in a couple of days..... I'll post back later how it all came together and how the PUPU (Hawaiian for appetizer) whet over! I'll rate this at 5 stars to start with just because it sounds so yummy! Well I fixed this for a potluck last night. I found it difficult to clean the pulp out of the cherry tomatoes and very time consuming. I tried to mince the salmon into as small a chunks as possible but it still wasn't fine enough to go through the biggest tip of my pastry bag. I ended up using a plastic bag with a corner cut off. I did use a about 4oz. of salmon as that was what was in the jar and used about 1/4tsp of black pepper. The taste was mild and I think next time I would spice them up a bit with finely chopped olives, jalapeno, and a 1/2tsp of salt. This would be great as a vegetable dip if you didn't want to mess with all those little tomatoes! I'm lowering it to 4 stars because of the prep time.

I gave this 3 stars for the idea, but read the reviews and could tell the mousse would be a little shy on flavor. So I took the tomato idea and ran with it. I have posted what I did as Smoked Salmon mousse tomato tartlet's. Brought them to a party and they were a big hit.

These were fantastic the filling is delicous. yes the gutting of the tomatoes is messy and time consuming but it is well worth it.

I thought they were wonderful. However, I made them for a party and nobody touched them. Maybe if you take them to a baby or bridal shower as opposed to a cook out, they would be more well received. :( Lesson learned....know your audience!

tastes great with an extra helping of  pepper. but beware, your salmon topping will not be orange (like the photoshopped picture), it will be off-white.
