I took this recipe to a graduation party and once I got people to try it...they couldn't stop eating it! I gave out the recipe to several people. This recipe does make quite a bit, but that was a good thing since I came home with almost an empty bowl. There was just enough left for me to enjoy! Try it with triscuits or bagel chips! YUM!

We had movie night last night and my family loved it!  It makes a lot, which is a good thing since there wasnt much left (we are a fammily of six) but I will see tonight how well it keeps. Thanks for the recipe.

Sorry, did not care for this very much. I also took to a party and came home with most of it which I threw away.

Pretty good, simple recipe.  Gotta love corned beef, which my hubby does.  The guys at work ate it and said it was great.  Worth a try, just tweak it to your tastes.  Thanks for sharing.

I am a huge cb fan and this was awesome. I used a can or hormel corned beef hash, half the sour cream and about 1/2 c of mayo. Mixed it, let it sit for an hour and spread it about an inch thick in a glass baking dish and baked until t was bubbly. I sprinkled some cheese on top after pulling it out of the oven. Mighty tasty!

The only thing I would change next time is the amount of the onion soup mix. It was over powering and made the dip very salty, even right out of the fridge before putting in the oven. Otherwise, yuuummmyyyy!

I used the suggestion from another review to use Corn Beef Hash and half sour cream, half mayonnaise. I added the onion soup in smaller amounts but used it all. very good I'll make it again
