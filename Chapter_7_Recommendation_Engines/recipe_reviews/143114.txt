I rated this recipe, but I had to adjust the ingredients according to what I had available.  I also did not measure anything; I just went by how much I thought I wanted of each indredient and 'dumped it'.  I had no mint, I did add red onions and pepper.  Oh my, oh my...what a good dip!  I am sitting here eating it with low-sodium wheat thins even now!  :D

Easy, fresh and delicious. I had to use regular cucumbers as that's what I had and I did add just 1 tsp. fresh minced onion. Very nice with the mint. Thank you.

The only thing I added was a dash of honey.  Probably doesnt make it authentic greek, but it made a great sauce even better!  For me, it was the finishing touch!

Super simple and very yummy. I used fresh mint but only had dried basil. I used greek yogurt to increase the denseness of the sauce.

I wanted a yogurt-cucumber sauce that had minimal ingredients but still tasted like it should. I used what I had on hand, so I didn't add the mint, but that was ok. The cap fell off my dill so there was probably a tablespoons worth in mine, still just as good. I also added 1/2 tbs. of garlic powder and 1tbs. of sour cream just to thicken it up a little. Perfect pairing for my falafel!

It's a great, easy to make, few ingredients sauce ! I didn't like the addition of honey, didn't have dill, so I used 1 chopped green onion. Added some garlic powder, instead of fresh one.
 Note: check first your cucumbers: they could be bitter !  I had to through mine away, and then used some English cucumber, which was good.
  Go thru the precedure with cucumber to the letter of the recipe !

 I fried ground lamb patties and the sauce was a great companion to them. 
Bon Appetit !

I'm not a big cucumber sauce fan but I thought I'd try it.  I think maybe I didn't cut the cucumbers up small enough because it was really thick.  Maybe next time I can use a mixer for just a few seconds thin it out.c

This recipe was great along with the Gyro Burger recipe on this site. I made this with some garlic powder added and it was sooo yummy! I made it around lunch time and place in fridge to eat at dinner, so about 4-5 hours in fridge! :)

Great! Easy! And for those of you who like to experiment, I've also used this sauce for pulled chicken tacos (flour tortillas, mango salsa and this sauce on top -added two tablespoons of sour cream and peppermint instead of mint-)

Very nice!  Skipped the mint (didn't have it).  Added fresh pressed clove of garlic and wedge of lemon juice.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Excellent!

This one is a keeper!  Stuck to the recipe except for the mint, which I didn't have on hand.  Made this as a topping for gyro burgers also from this site.
