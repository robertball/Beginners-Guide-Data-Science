Nothing fancy here, just meatloaf, good old comfort food perfect for a weekday dinner.  I cut back a little on the brown sugar (our personal taste preference), but the ground beef patties with the sauce really do taste like oven-baked meatloaf.  Moving forward, I will add some additional seasonings to the patties.  Since we can grill all year in Florida, I'll grill the patties, and then put them in the sauce to simmer on the stovetop (eliminating the splatter from the stovetop).  Simple to make and quick to get on the dinner table, a winner in this house.  Only one thing that I'lll miss...my leftovers for meatloaf sandwiches. :-)   Thanks for sharing courteneynjones.

This recipe is a good simple dinner. I served them over noodles.  The mustard was a bit strong for our liking. Will adjust next time.

It was easy to make! Kids loved it too! Doubled the recipe, used a cast iron, and it cooked up great. Didnâ€™t have Worcestershire so used Teriyaki instead. Great improve
