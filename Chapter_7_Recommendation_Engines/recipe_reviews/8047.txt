I have one suggestion for all of those taht tried this and it tasted more like lemon than orange. My family has made this cake for years. However, we do not use lemon pudding we use vanilla. I don't understand why lemon would be used at all because it would alter the flavor. If you are looking for ORANGE flavor use vanilla pudding instead and you will be impressed.

I can't believe I'm rating a recipe that begins with a yellow cake mix 5 stars, but I call it as I see it! This was just that good, and with none of that "this is a cake mix" taste. It seems most reviewers put their own spin on this recipe, as did I. I used yellow cake mix because that's what I had on hand, (but I've found French Vanilla makes a much better substitute for yellow cake mix in general), vanilla pudding, 1 tsp. orange extract, 1 tsp. vanilla, fresh orange juice and....one full tablespoon of orange zest! Since there seemed to be a great deal of disappointment with this cake not being very orange tasting, this full-flavored cake, as I made it anyway, is very definitely a prominent, fresh tasting orange. The glaze, too, is orangey, buttery good, and makes the cake all shiny and beautiful. I used a tube pan, but used the "bottom" of the cake for the top as I liked the imperfect and crackly look of it. This is just one outstanding, delicious and beautiful orange--yes ORANGE--cake.

My family enjoyed this easy,tasty,moist cake. My only complaint was that it was more of a "citrus cake" rather than orange. I added orange zest to the batter but it still lacked the orange punch I was looking for. That said I would make it again & enjoy every piece.
I would like to add my way of adding the glaze: After the cake has cooled
I put the cake back into the cake pan & add the glaze to the bottom of the cake first. Glaze soaks into the bottom of the cake which traditionally never gets it. It soaks into the sides too. I then invert the cake onto a cake plate & glaze the top & sides. All the glaze gets used & doesn't run all over making for messy cleanup.

This was a great base recipe, but I could tell from reading it that it wouldn't have the strong orange flavor I was looking for.  First, I used a lemon cake mix instead of a yellow one to increase the citrus taste.  Then I used orange extract instead of lemon.  To really pump up the orange flavor, I added 3/4 of a packet of orange Kool-Ade unsweetened drink mix to the dry ingredients.  I put the other 1/4 packet in the glaze.  After the cake cooled, I put it back in the bundt pan and poked big holes in the bottom of the cake with a chopstick.  Then I poured most of the glaze over the bottom of the cake and let it soak in for about 20 minutes. I then inverted the cake onto a cake plate and drizzled the remainder of the glaze over the top.  This came out great; very orangey and saturated with glaze.  Delicious.

Based on many of the reviews I read, I also thought the cake would taste too lemony.  In order to avoid that, I substituted Orange Supreme cake mix, vanilla pudding mix, and used vanilla extract instead of lemon.  It was awesome!  I also made an icing made with powdered sugar, a little o.j., and a few drops of vanilla extract...the white icing looks really great on the orange cake.

Delicious cake! Made this for a Labor Day party and everyone loved it. I didn't have lemon instant pudding mix, so I used vanilla instant pudding mix instead. I think next time I will use orange extract instead of the lemon for more of an orange flavor. Iam also going to try and make a glaze out of powdered sugar, orange juice and orange extract. The glaze in this recipe was more of a syrup that soaked into the cake instead of a glaze. Delicious none the less, but I will change a few things next time. This cake was moist and yummy!

Fabulous - plus it's so simple to make! You'd really never know it was a boxed cake - it's that good! It's very moist and bursting with orange flavor - what more could you ask for from such a simple recipe! I did use vanilla pudding mix vs. lemon, 1 tsp of vanilla extract vs. lemon and to heighten the orange flavor added a 1 tsp. of orange extract and a Tbsp of orange zest. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing! This cake is perfect when you don't have time to make a scratch cake but want something that tastes like you did! It baked up perfectly and even though the recipe for the glaze could probably be cut in half it really does add to the cake. Once it was cooled, I couldn't resist drizzling some melted white chocolate over it for a bit of contrast and to take it over the top. Great recipe!

Excellent cake.  Rave reviews from family.  I made this twice.  The first time my SIL made the glaze and did not bring it to a complete boil.  The glaze ran all over the place but still tasted good.  The second time when I made the glaze I brought it to a complete boil and then drizzled it over the cake.  This hardened the glaze somewhat, and it was excellent.  You definitely should bring it to a full boil, though, just like you would when making candy.  I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

I have made this cake twice in the last week.  It is so good!  A suggestion for doing the glaze...first poke the cake randomly with a toothpick.  Then place the cake on a wire rack and straddle the rack over a jelly roll pan.  As the un-absorbed glaze drips off, you can then collect it and keep re-drizzling until it is all abrorbed.

I baked this cake again this year for my husband's birthday.  This year I frosted it with chocolate frosting... the flavors blended beautifully!  He loved it...
* 2009 Review   I made this cake for my husband's BD. I used to buy an orange cake mix, but none of the markets, in which I shop, carries it anymore.  This recipe is a Godsend.   I followed other suggestions and used vanilla pudding and I substituted orange extract for the lemon in the recipe.   But I have a suggestion on applying the glaze:   I used a bundt pan to bake my cake.   After turning out the cake and allowing it to cool, I made the glaze and poured it into the empty bundt pan (I washed it and sprayed lightly with Pam).   Then I put the cake back in, pushing it down until the glaze rose up the sides.   In a couple minutes all the glaze was evenly absorbed and I turned the cake back out onto a plate.   There wasn't a drop of glaze left in the pan.   Worked perfectly.  Try it!

This is really good!  I also used vanilla pudding mix and an easier glaze with 2 cups p. sugar and 1/4 c. orange juice.  Great orange flavor!  Took 40 minutes to cook.

The ongoing theme with the comments on this recipe seems to be to change it... I definatly don't think it's a 5 star recipe 'as is'. I did the original first and it was too lemony. Moist, light- but definatly not predominantly orange. I was looking for a very fresh, very obviously orange cake so my next try was to follow the recommendation of all the other bakers who tried it their way. I subbed vanilla pudding for the lemon and orange extract in place of the lemon. I added 3 teaspoons of the orange instead of 1. I also used a french vanilla cake mix with it. NOW it's a 5 star recipe! Very fresh- the orange lingers in your mouth! I didn't do the bundt cake with the glaze. I filled it with a coconut cream and mandarin orange filling and frosted it in almond buttercream. AMAZING! P.S. Add a little orange gel food coloring to it. You wouldn't expect a strawberry cake to be white would you?

Fresh fresh fresh!! This cake is not only extremely easy to make, but tastes out of this world.  I have made this cake with the heated butter glaze listed in the recipe's detail and I have also made it as a three layer round cake with an orange cream cheese frosting. It was the hit of the party and not a drop was left!  The orange cream cheese frosting is as follows:  8 ounces of cream cheese softened, 1/2 cup of unsalted butter softened, 1 tablespoon of fresh orange juice, 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract, 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, 4 cups of confectioners sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of orange food coloring (optional).  Blend the cream cheese and butter in a large bowl using an electric mixer set at medium speed, until smooth.  Turn the mixer down to low and slowly add the orange juice, lemon extract, and vanilla and mix until well incorporated.  Add the sugar and continue to beat until light and creamy -- about 3 more minutes.  Add the food coloring (optional) and gently mix until the color is uniform.  Frost already cooled (I prefer actually chilled) cakes. This frosting compliments the cake beautifully and it is sure to keep them coming back for more. Enjoy!

Great, easy cake! I thought it was more of a lemon cake than an orange cake though.  I didn't use all the glaze, and it was just right.  I think if you do use it all, it makes the cake wet. Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous!! My very picky 14 yr. old son said he doesn't like anything orange except juice. I asked him to just take one bite and that is all it took. He actually used the word DELICIOUS. I used D.Hines french vanilla cake mix, vanilla instant pudding mix, 2tsp. orange extract, and 2 tsp. orange zest.  For the o.j., I used Minute Maid frozen from concentrate (because my kids like it the best).  I put the cooled cake back in the pan and used a meat thermometer to poke holes in the bottom. For the glaze, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/3 cup o.j., 1T water, and 2 tsp. orange zest.  I hope this is helpful to someone.

I made two of these cakes two different ways based on recommendations.  For the one I gave away I substituted yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding and orange extract.  I baked it in a 13x9 pan.  Unfortunately, I didn't taste this one, but it looked good and worked fine in a flat pan.  For the one I kept, I substituted orange cake mix, vanilla pudding and vanilla extract.  I baked this one in a bundt pan.  It was very moist and every bit was eaten by my family. I wish I could say which was better.  For the glaze I mixed 3 cups powdered sugar with 1/2 cup orange juice. This was for two cakes.  I warmed the orange juice before mixing so it would flow easily over the cake.  When glazing the bundt cake I found that it was better to have a cooled cake.  With a warm cake the glaze just slid right off.  With the flat cake it didn't matter.  I will be making this again.

I made this for my mom's birthday...but tweaked it a bit. I did not add any lemon whatsoever. Instead, I added orange pudding mix (by mixing Tang with Vanilla Instant Pudding Mix), orange extract, 2 tsps orange zest, and one small Yoplait "orange creme" yogurt.  Then I made an orange/chocolate icing using dark chocolate, cream cheese, sour cream, orange extract, orange liqueur, and orange zest. And I must say...it was INCREDIBLE. A very moist extremely "orangey" cake and the dark chocolate/orange icing was the perfect compliment to the tang of the  orange.

This recipe lends itself greatly to a roll up recipe.  I spread it out on a cookie sheet lined with parchments and baked for about 22 minutes at 350.  Took it out of the oven and covered it with a towel and rolled it up. Once cooled I unrolled it and filled it with a mixture of 1/3 cup cream cheese, 1 1/2 cuppowdered sugar and 3/4 cup whipped heavy cream and a 1/2 tsp of orange extract.  Roll it back up and chill.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  It was light but decadent and refreshing. Definetly a keeper.

Wonderful cake Angie, Thank You.  I added grated orange rind to the batter and used an Orange cake mix and vanilla pudding.  I also added orange extract.  I painted the glaze on with a pastry brush, which worked great.  Gave it a beautiful glaze.  Then I sprinkled the top with more grated orange rind.  Rave reviews.  Thanks again.

What a great recipe!  It took less than six mins. to get together and get in the oven.  I did sub vanillia pudding and orange extract to get a big orange flavor.  My husband loves those orange Hostess cupcakes, so he loved this.  I misread the glaze and made it with granulated sugar thinking that was "white" sugar.  It was still yummy.  You can stop laughing now.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  Delicious cake without a hint of that came-from-a-box flavor.  I added 2 t. of orange extract, used a butter cake mix and vanilla pudding.  I made it in two 9 inch layers (24 minutes at 350)and frosted it with cream cheese/whipped cream frosting from this site adding 2 t. of orange extract and about 1T of orange zest.  It is out of this world!  YUM and thanks for a truly wonderful super easy recipe!

Mmmm, this cake reminds me of my childhood! Hints of lemon and hints of orange - it's all good! I used a lemon cake mix, not a yellow. You can use whatever extract that you want, lemon, orange or vanilla, it's your cake, the recipe is only a suggestion! I did not have lemon pudding and used vanilla, that worked just fine. For the glaze I put some orange extract in and used confectioners sugar. The glaze was fine this way, and there was plenty of it - so be sure to poke lots of holes in your cake. But...... this cake is so good that it truly doesn't even need the glaze! I used a bundt pan and non-stick spray and the cake came right out and was gorgeous. Considering that the base of this cake is a box mix, this is heavenly! I rate it high for the taste and the ease. Thanks for sharing! *****UPDATE***** My favorite way to make this cake is with an orange supreme cake mix, vanilla pudding and vanilla flavoring. OUT OF THIS WORLD! I have ordered orange flavoring from Watkins and can't wait to try that variation. The Orange Supreme cake mix is awesome! YUM!

Well, I took everyone's advice and used orange extract and I'm not sure if that's what did it but I didn't think this was all that great. It wasn't bad but it is a bit too sweet and has a bitter undertone. Not a 5 star recipe and I won't be making it again.

I followed the recipe, but I did add 1tsp of vanilla-rum extract (homemade from this website).  I've sometimes had trouble getting a bundt cake out of the pan in one piece so followed the advice of reviewer, Grannyloohoo, and greased the bundt pan with Crisco (neither butter nor oil works!).  I then dusted it with sugar rather than flouring it which did give the slight crunch to which Grannyloohoo referred.  This is a very nice cake.  Thank you so much, Angie!

This is a great cake. It is nice to have something different than the usual frosted cake. This has become a Holiday traditional dessert for my family :)   *I do suggest that you let the glaze cool until thicken to allow even coverage when pouring over the cake*

This cake is FANTASTIC!!  I love making it and bringing it to gatherings! It's ALWAYS a hit!  Some of my friends are watching their weight, so for the cake~ I use SUNSWEET LIGHTER BAKE BUTTER AND OIL REPLACEMENT instead of the oil and EGGBEATERS instead of the eggs!! For the sauce topping~ I used SPLENDA GRANULAR BOX for the white sugar and IMPERIAL 1/3 LESS FAT for the regular butter. Still tastes great!. Really, it still taste GREAT!! Remember to completely cool the cake before adding the sauce~ I once made the mistake of adding the sauce too soon....:(

Thanks for an awesome recipe Angie, this one truly is a keeper!

After reading so many reviews saying this cake tasted like lemon, I decided to make some changes.  I used orange extract instead of lemon (1 and 1/2 teas), vanilla pudding mix instead of lemon, and orange juice concentrate reconstitiuted only half way to make it stronger than regular orange juice.  The result?  Wow!!  It was great and everyone raved about the great ORANGE flavor!

Great cake for when company is comming and you have little time. My grandmother has been making this same cake for over twenty years. The only difference is a tbs of orange zest in the cake and instead of oj and extract for the icing we use a basic drip glaze with a few tbs of frozen orange juice concentrate.

Angie, If I were able to give 10 stars  that still wouldn't be enough to tell you how good this cake is and can be.  It has opened up a whole new world of cakes for me and my family!  I first made it as you wrote it.  Absoultly great! Then I made it totally orange with orange cake mix and vanilla pudding, orange juice and extract.  Fabulous!  Third time I made it with lemon cake mix, lemon pudding, lemon juice (realemon) and extract.  My husband was in heaven!  For all of them I doubled the glaze recipe, which is to die for!  I read every review that was given and came up with the best way for me to glaze the cakes.  Did what some did and drizzled more on each piece as it was served and have had nothing but rave reviews for all of the cakes.  We all have our favorite, but all are worth 10 stars!  By the way, I found this in June and can't count the times I have made this since.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!

This cake was out of this world, but I made some modifications. First, I subsutituted the vanilla pudding for the lemon, and the orange extract for the lemon as well. That made all the difference in the world. Also, we wanted a frosting for the cake rather than a glaze, so I made a fabulous, light frosting by mixing 1 container of cool whip, 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream, 1-1/2 tablespoons of orange extract and a 3.4 oz. box of Jello-Instant Vanilla Pudding and whipped it with a hand mixer until thick with peaks, then spread it all over and let it chill in the fridge for a couple of hours. It was out of this world good and complemented the cake perfectly, since the cake is a little dense and the frosting is so creamy and light. All my dinner guests gave it 5 stars!!

Excellent! I try to follow the directions the first time I try a new recipe but after reading the recipe and knowing what I wanted, I did change it up a bit. I wanted an "orange" cake, not citrus, so I used Duncan Heinz Orange Supreme cake mix with vanilla pudding and vanilla extract. After turning out the cake and allowing it to cool, I made the glaze and poured it into the cleaned and sprayed, empty bundt pan. Then I put the cake back in, pushing it down until the glaze rose up the sides. In a couple minutes all the glaze was evenly absorbed into the cake. I turned the cake back out onto a serving plate. This worked perfectly and the cake absorbed all of the glaze. I was ready for a lighter cake, no heavy, sweet frosting, etc. and this was perfect. I considered a bit of white chocolate drizzle and so glad I didn't. It was perfect as is. The fam sort of checked it out and didn't say too much until they tried it, they all loved it, even the younger kids that are always into frosting and sprinkles. It was so shinny and beautiful, moist and orangey. Next time I will add a small bit of drizzle just to make it look a little more appetizing. Thank You!

Love this recipe!  Here are my changes based on other reviews:  used vanilla pudding instead of lemon, used 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. of orange extract.  Used 1/2 tsp. of orange extract in the glaze (which was made with powdered sugar).  I used a meat probe to poke holes in the cake, but first put it back in the pan and spread glaze all over the top (bottom) to let it soak in, then flipped it over, and used a pastry brush to brush on the glaze and guide it toward my probe holes.  I ended up using all the glaze and there really wasn't much on the cake stand because of the pastry brush application.  Delish! Glaze: 2 c. powered  sugar, 1/3 OJ, 1 tsp. orange extract, 1 T. water.

Wonderful, easy cake. I followed earlier suggestions and used orange cake mix and orange pudding mix. I used slightly diluted frozen orange juice concentrate in the cake and the glaze for even more orange flavor. I also doubled the glaze, saving most of it to use as sauce on individual pieces of the cake. A hit at work. Next time I may add semisweet minimorsels, since I love the combination of orange and chocolate.

I took this cake to an office function this summer and it was enjoyed by everyone.  I made a couple of changes based on the reviews, orange cake mix instead of yellow, vanilla pudding instead of lemon, 1/2 cup of sour cream, orange extract instead of lemon, and I added some orange zest, and I made sure that I used 100% orange juice, not concentrate.  This is a great summer cake, wonderful flavor but not heavy.  Thanks Angie.

I decided to try this recipe after reading all the "good" reviews.  The recipe sounded good, but when I took it out of the oven, it was approximately 1 1/2" thick!!!
I followed the directions exactly, other than replacing the lemon pudding with vanilla.  (which should not make any difference) IT JUST DIDN'T RAISE!!!  I was really disappointed, since I took it out of the oven at 9:45 p.m. for a Birthday the following day.  I had to then try to find something else to make!! - Not impressed!

This cake is yummy.  Thanks Angie!  I used 1.5 teaspoons of orange extract instead of lemon and let my glaze cool a while before applying.  I was experimenting to find something inexpensive for my daughter to take to all her school teachers, Sunday School teachers, etc. for Christmas.  Since Betty Crocker cake mixes are 89 cents right now, this is it.  One recipe made five of the 3.5 by 6 inch foil mini loaf pans.  (The cakes puff up and look bigger than the pans appear.)  Spray pans with pan spray and the cakes pop right out immediately after baking.  After filling, I set the 5 foil pans on one very large cookie sheet and baked them about 40 minutes at 350 until a toothpick came out clean.  They were very pretty after glazing.  Let glaze "set" before wrapping in plastic wrap and adding a ribbon.

I think this cake is wonderful and EASY.  It reminds me of a plum cake my mom makes out of baby food.  Her glaze is made with powdered sugar, though, but this is better because when I slice a piece of this I dip both sides of the cake back into the icing, and boy is it good.  I don't know what that other person meant by saying she had a friend that knew how to cook make this and it still didn't come out right.  Are you sure your friend really knows how to cook?  You can't mess this up.  My dog could make it!!

Good but I would have liked a little more orange flavor.  I did substitute oange flavoring for the lemon but it still did not have the orange flavor I was hoping for.

I followed the recommendations, and used vanilla pudding and orange extract. It is exactly what I was craving. I love lemon flavor too, but wanted something strictly orange, and by making these changes, that is what I got. Next time I will try it w/ lemon pudding and extract. Delish!

One of the pastors at my church called me and said he was thinking of the Orange Cake I brought to Bible study Sunday evening...he said it was better than the real whipped cream that I make that he absolutely adores...so I have one cooling on my counter for him...LOL  I grated one Cutie tangerine peel into the cake mix, as well as used orange, instead of lemon, extract...Also, the cake mix had pudding in it, so I added 1 package of white chocolate pudding mix...that made me think I may need a little more orange juice and I used 1 1/3 cups orange juice in the cake mix.  It was perfect!!!!  OH! I also sprayed my bundt cake pan and took white cane sugar and dusted the whole pan with it before I put in the cake mix...it gives such a nice little crunch in the mouth when you bite down on the cake...lovely texture!  Poured part of the hot orange juice mixture over the cake before I removed it from the pan and 10 minutes later, I poured the remaining sauce over the whole cake as it cooled on the rack...Perfect cake for a cake mix...I am a scratch baker, but will come back to this for a quick, easy charming cake. ********** 10 stars!

When I asked my son what he wanted for his 3rd Birthday cake, I'm sure this wasn't what he had in mind when he said "ORANGE ONE!" I wasn't about to skip out and just food color a cake mix, though! I followed the recommendations of others - vanilla pudding, zest, orange extract, vanilla extract. I did cupcakes, so I skipped the glaze. The cake is fantastic! Knowing what he -was- asking for, I did some orange food coloring. I topped them with sugar cookie stars after frosting them. I will definitely try this again in a bundt pan with the glaze soon!

In an effort to find just the right cake for an upcoming event, I tried three different recipes from this site.  I didn't frost or glaze any of the cakes, including this one, since we just wanted to evaluate the cake.  My official taste-tester (Hubby) declared this one the winner!  The only change I made was to use orange extract instead of lemon.  I baked cupcakes, which took 25-30 minutes at 325 F.  I'm looking forward to making this one again!

My husband and I made this cake for his work "Bake Off" and we got voted first place. We used the vanilla pudding and we also added a thicker glaze on top made from orange juice, lemon extract and powdered sugar. It was a thinker icing for the top. It was delicious!!! thanks for a great recipe!!

I have made this cake twice, and each time I get gushing compliments. I use orange extract instead of lemon, and I add a teaspoon of vanilla. I use Crisco to grease the pan, then instead of flour I dust it with granulated sugar--makes a  slightly crunchy crust. This is a favorite of my 94 year-old Mom, but my husband loves it too.

This is a great, refreshing cake!!! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used an orange cake mix, vanilla pudding, and orange zest. Then, for some unknown reason, I had it in my mind that the recipe called for 8 ounces of sour cream. After I dumped it into the batter I gasped!!! I figured I would just let it ride and see how it panned out!!! AWESOME!!! I think the sour cream made the cake denser than it would have turned out. I plan on making it with the sour cream every time now. Sometimes mix ups make for great discoveries,lol!I made glaze using powdered sugar and orange juice, but it truly didn't need it. A dollop of whipped topping is great!!

Wonderful! This is the first bundt cake I have made and I even went out and bought a special pan just to make this cake.  Yes, everyone says it doesn't taste like an orange cake, but maybe you could call it a citrus flavored cake.  I enjoyed it so much that I made two on Sunday to give away to friends.  It's easy to make and a foolproof cake that tastes fantastic, but even better the second day.  I cover a cake pan with foil and place my cooling rack on top with the cake to cool.  When it is completely cool, I use an eyedropper to put the glaze on the cake.  It gives me complete control as to where I want the glaze to go and I can pull up the little run off that collects on the foil with the eyedropper.  Yummy!

Perfect for a summer barbeque - everyone raved about it's refreshing orange/lemon/citrus-y taste and with the leftover glaze on the bottom of the plate, we just scraped it with our forks to add to our slices! Used orange extract, applesauce for oil and eggbeaters. Used thawed orange juice concentrate for the glaze to intensify the orange flavor. Will bake again!

I usually make the recipe as printed to review, however, I needed an orange cake and many of the reviews said that this tasted more like a lemon cake, although everyone seemed to like it a lot.  So, I simply took out all the lemon flavored things and replaced with vanilla pudding mix and orange extract as many other reviewers noted.  The glaze is particularly good, and I plan on using it for other baked goods.  My dinner guests exclaimed over the cake with the 2 changes noted above - it was very well received.  It is quite sweet, so I served it with fresh whipped cream, but did not sweeten the cream.

If you can find it Duncan Hines makes an Orange Cake Supreme cake mix.  I would use vanilla pudding and maybe omit the extract.  This basic list of ingredients can be used for a multitude of cakes.  Pound cake recipe should be on the box.

I chose this to make as a pound cake...Oops, not one but OMG! It was devine. The smell, while baking was fabulous! And was it moist and soft when I cut into it...yes it was. We were digging into it before glazing. And hmmmm!! I used fresh squeezed orange juice for the whole recipe. And I didn't have lemon extract on hand. I actually had orange...so I used it. nummy nummy!!! TY it's a totally keeper. However, the glaze...isn't for me. It really needs confectioner's sugar to glaze it nicely, however it's like a orange simple sryup...and it soaked right in.

Very good!  I used this recipe to make cupcakes, they turned out great!  I just used the temp and cooking time on the yellow cake mix box.  Other then that, I did not change a thing!

This is my favorite cake of all time with a few modifications...I use vanilla pudding, 1 tsp orange and 1 tsp vanilla extract and the zest of one orange.  The other trick is to use concentrated OJ and only dilute with 2 cans of water.  These changes make this cake truly tasting like fresh orange.  Eat with vanilla ice cream for a REAL treat!

I had somewhat mediocre expectations of this cake recipe since it called for a box yellow cake mix to begin with and "box cake" usually ends up tasting "artfifical". Boy, I was wrong with this one. I think a lot had to do with what additions I made to the batter. Instead of lemon, I used 1 tsp of orange extract, fresh squeezed naval orange juice, and 1 T of orange zest. This cake ended up  being very orange-y tasting. I was pleased with the results. Loved the teeny specks of orange zest in the cake and my kitchen filled with a cirtus orange-y aroma-very nice. The glaze is a very nice, orange flavor, not overpowering. I added the glaze to the bottom of the cake first, let it soak up, then I inverted it to a plate to glaze the sides, drizzled the rest of the glaze to the top. let it soak up all the glaze.  The glaze really makes this cake shine adding a nice orangey buttery flavor to the already delicious orange cake!

More of an 'orange bread', but it tastes great. The batter was so delicious that I could hardly wait for the cake to be done. Used three disposable loaf pans and it was ready in 30 minutes. Didn't realize until after that I forgot to add the vegetable oil, but couldn't tell.  I will make this again and I think it could be easy to create variations. Thanks for sharing.

this is hands down the tastiest cake I've ever eaten!  I used french vanilla cake mix and vanilla pudding instead of lemon.  ...I also used orange extract instead of lemon to give it a zesty orange flavor.  I cooked it in a regular cake pan as well. Then I warmed vanilla frosting and added orange extract to taste... this cake was the best I've ever had!!!

I made this for my daughter's 1st birthday on 25th of june and this cake made it a memorable day for all of my family members. This recipe truly makes a lovely dish for special occasions. my family members are already asking me when i am going to make it again :-) I did not add lemon extract. I used duncan hines orange cake mix instead of plain yellow one and also used vanilla pudding mix. i still went and added the 3/4 cup orange juice along with the orange cake mix and it did not turn out to be too much orangy. it's really a delicious recipe.

This cake was great! My whole family loved it~! It was very moist and not too rich~ The glaze was great! I tried CHUBBYCHICK's way of glazing~(I let the cake cool then I popped it out of the pan and turned it in up-side down and poked holes in it with toothpicks then I basted it and let it soak in and basted again until it was gone, baste the top, bottom and sides.)
It was GREAT! I will be making this many times over! Way to Go Angie!

Mmm Delicious! Very decadent. I added orange extract to the glaze and brushed it on. It was a bit runny but still good and a MUST for the cake. I think next time though I will add orange extract to the cake...it didn't have enough orange taste for me..but still good :)

Cake was very good..really easy to make.. used splend instead of sugar for icing.  Found that the icing was very thin and runny at first.. I put the icing back on the stove for a while longer let boil at least 2 minutes and then let it cool a bit before I put it on was much better didn't run right off.  Cake had more flavor the next day.

Super moist, delicious cake! Made the cake in a 13x9" pan and poked holes on top and poured glaze over cake. Also, used powdered sugar for glaze instead of granulated sugar. Will definitely make again.
 
Thank you for the terrific recipe!

An absolute favorite of all my friends and family!! I make it often -- sometimes I substitute orange extract instead of lemon, depending on what I have -- or I try combinations of both extracts.  I find the orange makes it taste the best!

I made this the other night for company and they all raved about it. I didn't have lemon extract so I used vanilla and it did not make a difference. I read one reviewers comment about using vanilla pudding if you want more of an orangy taste to the cake but my Husband likes lemon so I just went with the lemon pudding. This is definitely a keeper Thanks Angie!

Awesome cake!  I made this for Easter dessert.  I did as suggested and used yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding and orange extract.  I grated orange zest in the glaze and sprinkle coconut on top.  Everyone loved it!

Have Made this cake a number of times, and get rave reviews each time!  I use orange extract in place of lemon, and also add orange zest to the cake.  For Easter  I also decorated the top of the cake with orange flavored buttercream frosting. I added some shredded coconut and jelly beans too!!

Oh my gosh!!! This is one awesome recipe! Well after I read others reviews on how using lemon extract makes it seem more of a citrus cake, I changed a few things and I hope this helps someone out there to make a orange delight! First I used butterscotch pudding because I didn't have vanilla, second into the batter I put the zest of two oranges along with their juice which produced 3/4 needed in the recipe, I also made them into cupcakes and baked them only for 27 minutes. They came out so good...I don't even know where to begin. They taste almost like eating a cake form of those orange breakfast cinnamon rolls, except no cinnamon!!! They are delicious...my family who are very picky said...no icing for these they're great just like this and devoured them! It made about 18 cupcakes. ENJOY!!!

I made this cake according to the recipe. It was the best cake ever if you like Lemon. Although  you put orange juice in it. The lemon was very overwhelming. I think I will do what the other reviews suggested and use an orange cake mix and use vanilla pudding. maybe an orange extract also. But over all my family loved it.

My family loved this cake. My husband wasn't very enthusiastic about it at first but he practically inhailed the first piece and asked for a second.  Like other reviewers I made changes (I used orange supreme cake mix, vanilla pudding, orange extract). What a bold, popping orange flavor! The glaze is pretty amazing as well. I doubled it for extra and divided it using half on the whole cake and saved the rest to drizzle over each cake slice with a big dollop of homemade whipped cream. As my son would say, 'knawesome!!  Thank you Angie for a keeper!

A friend gave me this recipe many years ago and it is one of my favorite. For the frosting I use more orange juice so it is more of a liquid. Then I use a syringe and inject is throughout the cake and this makes it very moist. I also make the frosting as it is called for and pour it over the cake.

I made this recipe with two of the recommended adjustments: orange supreme cake mix instead of yellow cake mix, and vanilla instead of lemon extract. I made it as a sheet cake instead of a bunt cake, and it turned out great. I mixed some store-bought butter cream frosting with about a cup of whipped topping and topped the cake. We really liked it. I'll be making it again.

This was pretty good. I agree that it was much more citrus tasting than orange. I would be interested in switching up some of the flavors to make it more of an orange cake. It was nice and most. Thanks!

This was excellent. Made twice, used both yellow cake mix and lemon, added orange zest and orange extract, but the best addition for me was added 1/2 cup of triple sec to the glaze - really added a lot of flavor and warmth! Thanks so much.

Most of my cake are make from scratch, but the  best and most requested dessert is this one.  I add 1 T. orange zestr,  T. orange extract, and use French Vanilla cake and pudding mix. By adding the zest and more orange extract, the orange flavor really comes through. I usually leave out the drizzle step,  and use chocolate frosting which make the cake perfect.

I used van. pudding, orange extract and zest of one orange...1/2 in cake, 1/2 stirred in glaze. Really good, and I hate cake mix taste, but this does not have it. Thanks for a great recipe.

Made the recipe with these tweaks, used french vanilla cake mix, vanilla pudding and orange extract. Comes out delicious and orange flavored. I put some glaze in the pan and put the cake back in there to soak it up, and also some on the bottom. Best orange cake ever.

My son's favorite flavor is orange so I made him this cake for his birthday.  Everyone loved it!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and dusted the pan with sugar, added the zest of 2 oranges to the batter, used French vanilla cake mix and freshly squeezed orange juice.  A delicious cake recipe.

I made this for an orange-lover's birthday. There's a seasonally available boxed orange cake that we usually use, but WOW this was better. I followed the recipe but changed 3 things per reviewers comments to make it truly ORANGE: switched orange extract for lemon, switched vanilla pudding for lemon, and added some orange peel.  The glaze soaked in well.  Some leached back out, but was not a problem at all.  If I could convert this to a layer cake that's more 'decoratable', this would be THE annual birthday cake.  Thanks, Angie!

This cake was so yummy! I made it for a family get-together and it was a big success. I read the other reviews and did change a few things. I used vanilla pudding intead of lemon, and used orange extract instead of lemon extract. Also, I made sure I brought the glaze to a full boil before drizzling over the cake. I left the cake upside down in the bundt pan and poured about half of the glaze over the cake. I let it soak in for about 15 minutes. When I turned it over I added the glaze on the top, and garnished with sliced oranges around the sides & orange zest over the top.

I made this for a family gathering yesterday and it was a huge hit! After reading reviews, I substituted vanilla pudding for the lemon (I would have used orange extract instead of the lemon, but I didn't have any on hand). I squeezed 2 fresh oranges for the juice and used store-bought oj for the remainder needed. I also added orange zest - about 2 teaspoons to the batter and 1 teaspoon to the glaze.  I placed the cooled cake back into the pan and spooned the glaze over the bottom, making sure to let some run down the sides and center of pan to soak the edges of the cake. I let it soak about 30 minutes and turned the cake onto the serving plate. I then drizzled the glaze over the top and used a basting brush to brush more glaze onto the sides.  Nice and moist and delicious!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I love this recipe!  I've made it a few times and usually around spring/Easter time! I use vanilla pudding though, b/c I never can find lemon pudding mix at my store and I also usually substitute orange extract for the lemon extract and I love the way it turns out -- very orangey! I make it this way everytime and am always pleased with the results.  Thanks for posting the recipe - it's a definite keeper!

This is a delicious cake recipe. Because of the comment by others about the lack of orange flavor, I used orange extract rather than lemon and the zest of two oranges in the batter. As for the glaze, I used confectioner's sugar rather than granulated sugar and some sour cream in the mix. The result was a zesty orange glaze rather than orange syrup.

My 12 year old daughter made this for our family.  It was super easy to make and moist with a very fruity flavor.  She commented however (and I agree) that you could definitely tell it was made from a mix; sort of had that artificial flavor taste.  The glaze was yummy though; maybe we'll try it again with the vanilla pudding.

Fabulous recipe Angie!  Moist and delicious.  I tried this recipe twice: once with lemon pudding and once with vanilla pudding.  Both were great, but the  vanilla pudding won hands down.  I used Duncan Hines Butter Cake mix, and fresh OJ (one of the pleasures living in Florida.)  This is definitely a keeper and I will make many times again!  I have been asked to make this for the Superbowl party this Sunday.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy and an absolutely wonderful cake! It is more lemony than orange but for me it made no difference because it is still one of the best cakes I have tasted. I made some extra glaze and cooked it a bit longer until it was syrupy. I poured some of the glaze over it before I turned it onto the cake plate. I then used a pastry brush to keep painting and painting the glaze over and around it. It is well worth taking the time to get all of the glaze soaked in. It was eaten in one day.  YUM!!

This cake LOOKED like it would be delicious while making it.  However, it tasted like a lemon cake mix but with MUCH more work. NO orange flavor hardlya and it was dry and pointless.

Very Good!  It was so easy to make and is very moist and flavorful.  There was a lot of sauce, and it seemed kind of runny, but just keep pouring it on until it's gone, and it will turn out great.

This comment is directed to   the person saying the *Cavity Maker Cake* was  SO much better than this  one........This  is  NOT a chocolate cake, chocolate is  NOWHERE mentioned in this  recipe, it is an ORANGE cake.........anyway  I think it  is  a FANTASTIC cake and  Angie, I agree, I cannot make  this cake  often or  *I* will weigh 500 pounds :)   Thanks  for  sharing  this  awesome  recipe----and  for  what it is  worth, this  cake  beats  the Cavity Maker  cake  hands  down, IMO!

I am sorry to go against the crowd, becaue everyone on here seems to rave about it.  This was just not for me. I will never make it again.  It turned out fine.  Everyone who ate it said it was great.  But it just seemed like 'cake' to me, 'lemon cake'.  I prefer the 'Cavity Maker Chocolate Cake' recipe I found on this site.  Instead of people saying to me, "This is really good, thank you." (lemon cake response), people said, "OMG this is really good, can I have the recipe!"  (Cavity Maker response)  People are still talking about THAT cake.

Great recipe!  If you like lemon cake, you'll love this!  By your suggestions, I substituted orange cake (Duncan Hines) for the yellow cake. I also make a little extra of the glaze which is delicious.  Even my finicky five-year-old daughter likes this cake.  For parties, thin orange slices placed around the bottom of the cake makes a nice garnish.

Wonderful cake...just had this for dessert...loved by all...glaze is thin so I put the cake on top of foil...used fork to punch holes and then slowly poured it on...I then immediately removed the cake and placed it on my serving platter. I served it while the glaze was still warm...absolutely wonderful.

I used concentrated frozen o.j. but only added one can of water when making it. I also omitted the lemon peel and used vanilla pudding. My family loved it.

I made this recipe and it lasted maybe a half of a day! With two hungry men in the house, and them working on the roof, it didn't last long! I'll be making this again and again.

As my kids would say, This cake rocks!  I made it this afternoon and several hours later there are only crumbs left.  It's easy, and the only lengthy part is the baking time.  Well worth the wait though!  The only thing I changed was to use orange extract instead of lemon.  I'll make this cake again and again.

I made this recipe for Easter and it was wonderful!  To add more orange flavor, I added the grated rind from one orange.  I also added a few drops of food coloring to make the color more orange than yellow.  The cake is tangy and moist.  I will be making it for my Mother's Day brunch this year because I know my mother and my mother-in-law would love it.

As with some other reviewers, I was surprised it didn't taste like a box-mix cake. I usually make all cakes, cookies, etc. from scratch, however I couldn't resist the ratings. And what a great cake! My hubby is a fan of this now, and said he'd definitely have it again. Glazing rather than icing the cake was...well, the "icing on the cake"! LOL Much better than a frosting by far.

This was my first attempt, so I stuck to the recipe. It was tasty, but I think I will try the vanilla pudding substitution next time.

Also, the glaze in step 4 didn't really work for me, so my housemate (who has been to culinary school) suggested taking a couple of cups of powdered sugar and mixing it with a few tablespoons of orange juice (you have to kind of "feel it out" as you mix them together) to get a nice glaze which went over the cake and hardened up. It tasted and looked really good, and I definitely recommend going this route.

Very delicious! I took the suggestions and used instant vanilla pudding instead of lemon and orange extract instead of lemon and it came out great! Moist and light. You wouldn't know it is a boxed cake mixture. I will definitely make this again! A++

This cake turned out beautifully.  I used the lemon pudding, but vanilla extract instead of lemon (because that was what I had) and the flavor was great.  My husband literally licked the plate!  It was very moist and the orange flavor was subtle, but overall a nice citrus flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

Wow!  I LOVE this recipe.  So easy and so good.  I cut back on calories a little bit by substituting light margarine (melted) for the butter and sugar-free vanilla pudding mix, and splenda sugar blend and light margarine in the glaze.  It was still fantastic.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this a couple of times before but haven’t reviewed it until now.  This is a delicious and easy cake.  This time I made half the recipe in my 6-cup bundt pan.  My digital kitchen scale is perfect for halving the cake and pudding mixes.  My smaller version was done baking in 40 minutes.  This time instead of using the glaze, which is very delicious, I opted to use Cinnamon Bun Icing, also from this site, to drizzle over the cooled cake.  Either the glaze or the icing are great with this cake.  Very yummy!

Delicious! Shared with co-workers and received raving reviews. Everyone loved it. I did take others advice and used orange extract instead of lemon.  Also used vanilla pudding instead of lemon. I will definately make this again. Thank you for sharing Angie.

This has been a favorite for potlucks, but I do a couple things differently.  I use orange extract, and for an added wow factor, sprinkle a cup of mini chocolate chips on top of the batter just before baking.  I've heard that a trip through a bowl of flour first will keep them from sinking as much, but that's untested at this point.

Unbeatable!!  Delicious!!  There are not enough adjectives to describe how delicious this cake is and so very, very easy!!  This cake will impress your family and friends!  I made it as described and made the mistake of cutting a small sliver of cake to taste; found that I could have eaten the entire cake in one sitting!!  Next time I will try to vanilla pudding instead of lemon but just can't imagine anything better tasting!

Made this the other day, and it was delicious.  I didn't separate anything, all in one bowl, and I beat it with my electric mixer.  I did add the orange flavouring rather than the lemon, and also grated orange rind into it.  Used vanilla pudding mix - not lemon, and in my glaze, just icing sugar, a drop of orange flavouring and a little water, whisked and drizzled over the cake.  Made in a bundt pan.  Very delicious, you can hardly leave it alone.

This cake is a good cake for a cake made with a box mix. I do think it has a "mix " flavor that does come thru and that is why I am giving it four stars instead of five. However, for a quick cake from a storebought mix, I think it is pretty good. My grandaughter said she loved it. Thanks.

Sinfully delicious.  I used vanilla pudding and orange extract as others recommended.  I'm at altitude and should have taken it out of the oven a little earlier than I did - so you might want to watch it as the time gets close.

I thought this cake was moist and flavorful. I could have eaten all of it! I took it to work to share and it did not get devoured. Guess they are not orange cake people. Their loss!

GREAT cake with slight modifications.  In addition to the pudding, I also added a large box of sugar free orange jello mix, and instead of 1 tsp of lemon extract, I added 2 tsp of orange extract.  I also just sprinkled powdered sugar on top and did not glaze it.  YUM!!!!

This is really great! I followed the origional recipe and it was definitely more lemony than orange, but we loved it. I will try using vanilla mix next time instead of lemon. YUM!

This cake is very similar to another one I make. (I call it Peach Schnapps cake.) Try substituting the lemon extract for orange extract. Also, instead of lemon pudding mix, use vanilla. Then, instead of the extra orange juice, use Peach Schnapps. 

To make the cake to die for, pour a glaze on top. Use orange juice, Peach Schnapps, and 10x sugar for the glaze. It's incredible!

This is an awesome orange cake recipe. I did make some changes to fit my needs. Lemon pudding was substituted for vanilla pudding per another reviewer. I left out the extract altogether because I didn't want to buy lemon or orange extract as they are not ones I use often. I also used fresh squeeze OJ mixed with equal parts store-bought juice. I added about 1Tbs grated orange zest. 

Original recipe makes a bundt pan but I made cupcakes with orange-cream cheese frosting instead. I made these for a coworker's BDay & everyone raved about them! Makes about 24 cupcakes.

This cake was Perfect! absolutley Splendiferous! I pretty much followed the exact recipe, lemon pudding and all...i think it might have been a leetle weird with vinilla...but anyway, my whole family LOVED it and gobbled it up!
However i would give the "glaze" about three stars...i boiled it for 2 minutes as a reviewer suggested and let it cool completely but it never really got thick enough to stay on the cake...it just puddled around it. So i poked lots of teeny holes in the top with a toothpick and poured it over it again...The glaze Tasted great...it just made the cake look soggy.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because the recipe as written is not truly an orange cake.  

Alterations:  Use an orange cake mix. (Duncan's Orange Supreme), vanilla pudding, and orange extract.

I added a soft white frosting while warm creating a glaze effect.  (A clear glaze would normally work, but the orange "glaze" included in the recipe I felt wasn't enough.)  When I served the cake, I took the remaining orange glaze and drizzled it lightly on each slice when served.  Perfect orange cake recipe!

I loved the cake but made it in a 9X11 pan, the fabulous glaze went to the bottom and I sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  Boy, the bottom AND the top taste fabulous and of course, the middle is good too.  I used the ingredients someone else added, orange extract & French Vanilla Cake Mix

While this cake was good - I can't say that it will ever be one of my favorites.  It was moist, loved the "syrup" that is poured over it, but for some reason just didn't do anything for me.  I - like other reviewers - used vanilla instant pudding instead of the lemon.  I added grated orange peel and orange extract instead of lemon.  If I ever DO make this again, I'll use an orange cake mix too.

The cake was awesome.  I used Orange Zest and Orange Extract since many said that the cake didn't taste as Orange as they wanted. The cake was really moist and it tasted very good.  A good cake to have with tea or coffee. YUM!

Fabulous! My friends loved it, and it was so moist. I did modify the recipe, though: I didn't have orange juice prepared, so I substituted 1/4 cup orange juice frozen concentrate + 1/2 cup milk in the cake. I only added 1/4 cup of oil and put in 1/4 cup of nonfat plain yogurt (I like to avoid adding so much oil). I also substituted orange extract for the lemon extract.

this was pretty good.  It was moist and flavorful, although I'm not sure it was truly "orange-y."  I followed the recipe exactly (other than changing to vanilla pudding instead of lemon).  I followed others suggestions to poke holes and let the glaze soak thru the cake which I think made it better.  I wanted to add mandarin oranges to the batter but didn't because I like to follow the recipe the first time.  Maybe I will try it again with the oranges.

This gets 5 stars but only by following other reviewer's recommendations: Vanilla cake mix, vanilla pudding, orange extract and traditional glaze of confectioners sugar, milk and vanilla.  To add a little something extra I added a dash of the orange extract to the glaze.  Also, the cake started to dry out a bit after a few days (yes, it was covered, so you can up the veggie oil up a bit.

I love this cake!  I made a couple of changes...I used 1/2 a package of vanilla pudding mix and 1tsp vanilla extract instead of lemon and I added a good amount of orange zest.  Also, I made a different glaze...I used 1 cup powdered sugar, 1-2tsp of orange juice and 1 1/2tsp orange zest.  This cake is amazing!!

I've made this cake twice now and both times it was raved about by all who had some!!  The first time I made it, I used lemon pudding but I used orange extract as well.  The second time, I followed others suggestion of vanilla pudding and again this cake was a winner.  I also followed someone's advice about putting the cake back in the pan and pouring some of the glaze on bottom first- great idea!

I used orange extract instead of vanilla, and vanilla pudding instead of lemon. Great recipe. I also added a half a bag of chocolate chips to the cake batter. DELISH!

I used reduced sugar cake mix, sugar free vanilla pudding. I got great reviews and it was even better the next day. Will make again!

It was alright, not the best.  I did, however, substitute vanilla pudding for the lemon and orange extract for the lemon in hopes to get a more orange flavor.  I had trouble with the glaze even have boiled it, it took me many, many brushed-on applications because if I would've drizzled it the glazed would just be sitting on my cake plate.

The key to making this caking exceptional is using freshly squeezed orange juice.  I also used 3/4c light sour cream instead of oil.  I used orange zest instead of lemon extract and a vanilla pudding instead of lemon.  I took someone's advice put the cooled cake back in pan, poked holes and poured half the glaze over.  Let sit for 15 min.  Turned over, poked more holes and poured the remaining glaze over.  Served with whipped cream. My mix was 515g and the pudding was 102g.  More than called for but it worked fine.

This cake is sooooo good! Friends and family will think you worked hard making it, but it's very easy. 1 change I made was I used only half of all ingredients for the glaze. The full amount seemed to make it soggier. This is my sister-in-law's favorite and I make it for her every year on her birthday, which happens to be on Christams Eve, so it doubles as a yummy dessert when our family is together opening gifts.

OUTSTANDING!!!!  I made this just as listed except I splurged and bought Orange extract to use instead of Vanilla extract.  I had a little trouble with the glaze, it just ran off the sides of the cake instead of soaking in, so I put the cake back in the bundt pan and pored the glaze on the cake, let it soak up the glaze then turned it out on a fancy cake plate. It wasn't fancy enough for my 3 year old (no sprinkles) but my 14 year old, my husband and I loved it!!!  It is very moist and the glaze gives this cake a crunch along the outer edges that is to die for!  I saw orange cake mix at the store and might give that a try next time to see if that might be a yummier alternative but this cake is so good just the way it is that it will be hard to improve upon!  I will be making this cake often!!!

This is one of my favorite orange pound cake recipe. It is wonderful, moist and you just follow the recipe exactly and it will turn out wonderful. I also put a can of drained mandarine oranges in the center of the bundt pound cake for decoration and flavor. That is a nice touch.

I made this cake once years ago and my mom asks for it all the time!  It's just enough orange without being overpowering.  I add a little extra lemon extract & OJ.  The glaze is awesome too and I use it for other recipes.  Thank you for such a great tasting cake.

Everyone loves this cake!  It is so moist.  I use orange extract in place of the lemon extract and I also refrigerate the cake and serve it cold.  I usually put an orange glaze on this cake, but have also just garnished it with a little whipped cream on the side.  Delicous!

I brought this cake to work and everyone raved. i thought it tasted alittle artificial however i used a light orange juice since it was all I had. I got great reviews and used a syringe to pump in some of the glaze into the cake  making it extra moist. Thanks

This was  my grandmothers recipe... We've had it every Thanksgiving and Christmas for the last 34+ yrs....  My mom says grandma made this cake even when they were children.... It's a family tradition that I plan to carry on through the years.... Imagine my surprise to see what I've know to be a secret family cake online LOL

So I wouldn't call this cake an Orange Cake, but it is yummy.  It tastes like a cake I ate as a child called a Lemon Crunch Cake.  I would take the advice from one of the earlier reviews to put the cake back in the pan once cooled and pour half the glaze over it.  Then turn it out on a plate and glaze the top.  If you don't, you will have tons of extra glaze.

This cake tasted good, but it didn't taste like orange cake.  After going to the trouble and expense of adding all the eggs, lemon extract, pudding, orange juice, and butter all I ended up with was a cake that tasted no better than a yellow  boxed cake.  My husband and I have had orange cake that was fabulous and the 5 star rating led me to believe I'd found a good recipe.  We were very disappointed.  Won't be making this on again.

I made this for my husbands Memorial Day cookout at work. He said it disappeared immediately after the first cut. I substituted the yellow cake mix for Duncan Hines Orange Mix, left out the lemon extract and changed the pudding to vanilla. Will definitely make again with my updates.

My husband loved this cake.  I used vanilla pudding and was going to use orange extract when I saw an orange cake mix in the boxed cake aisle and decided to skip a step and use that instead.  It turned out really well, but the glaze didn't soak in.  Next time, I will try some of the other methods of applying the glaze--and I'm thinking about putting a chocolate glaze on the cake.  But there will definitely be a next time!

I made the cake last night as a trial run before giving as a Christmas gift.  The recipe was very easy to follow, but I was disappointed with the taste.  The flavor was subtle but wasn't rich as many described.  For my family, it was barely mediocre.  I will not make this again nor will I recommend it to others.

What a wonderful cake!  So easy to make.  The glaze was runny, but as one person suggested, I used a pastry brush to brush it on...easy to do.  I will bake again. ****Second cake I used vanilla pudding, and orange extract in the cake.  The glaze I used 2 tbsp butter and 1 tsp orange extract.  The second cake had a  much more orangy taste, so this is the way I will make it from now on.

This is a really good cake, nice texture and not too "from a mix" tasting. I had my heart set on making this before I checked to see if I had all the ingredients on hand and, of course, I didn't. I didn't have oranges or orange juice. What I did have was a bottle of Key Lime juice that needed to be used up. So I substituted 1/2 cup lime juice and 1/4 cup water for the 3/4 cup of orange juice and instead of lemon extract I added orange extract. I was a litle concerned the cake would be too tart from all that lime juice. It definitely is tart, but not too much so, especially with the glaze over it. I'll make this again, next time hopefully I'll have orange juice! If you like icing on your cake, don't expectit from this recipe, the one included here is more a syrup intended to soak into the cake.

I made this for my son's birthday. Added blue color icing on top. (Tried a Nemo theme) I also reduced the number of eggs to three, used orange cake mix, vanilla pudding and orange extract instead of lemon extract. It was a big hit. Even my daughter (3 yr old) who doesn't like to eat cake normally, ate 3 pieces (actually I saved a couple of pieces for her and gae t to her the next day when she wanted it soon after breakfast. Will make this again.

This was amazing!  I've made it for family gatherings and for my husband's work and everyone always asks for the recipe.  I omit the lemon extract and add 1 1/4 cups of OJ to the batter instead of the 3/4 cups.  Mmmmmm - very yummie!

I absolutely adore this cake and make it all the time.  The only change I made right from the start was to switch 1 tsp of orange extract for the lemon, just to give it more of an orange taste. Also, I find that I end up with a lot of extra glaze, so if you're worried about not having enough of an ingredient, you can definitely make 1/2 of the glaze and have plenty for the cake.  My friends beg for this cake, and it's really simple to whip up. I love it!

Yum Yum Yummy!  I just made this for a work party.  I thought it sounded refreshing for a summer day.  Everyone loved it and kept asking for the recipe.  Next week I'm going to make it for my Bunco club.  This time I thought I'd top the individual pieces with whipped cream and mandarin oranges.

I made this cake for my daughter's class party.  It was a success! As for the the icing, I followed the directions to make it using unsalted butter and a pinch of salt. Let the cake cool for 10 mintues in the pan, then drizzled some over the top while still in the pan. Invert cake onto plate with sides and spooned rest of sauce slowly over cake. Its very moist this way.

I, too, have made this cake. My husband took some to work for himself and a co-worker! They both agreed that it was a keeper. I found the glaze wasn't a real "glaze" but the cake soaked up the glaze like a sponge, which made it nice and moist. I will definately make this again and recommend it to everyone!

I'm not sure what went wrong with this cake...the cake turned out dry and the glaze was extremely sweet.  Maybe because I baked it in a 9X13 pan?  I will try it again in a bundt pan, but without the glaze.

This cake is WONDERFUL! I actually couldn't get the glaze to properly work. Next time I am just going to make the cake and enjoy it plain. It does make a nice bundt, but I like it in a 13 X 9 pan as well because it takes less time to cook that way. If you are thinking of making this cake, you should try it!

I made this cake for my friend's birthday as a layer cake and it worked out great - I used the glaze over the cakes, let them cool and then used chocolate fudge frosting to frost the whole thing - yum!

I tasted the orange glaze before I put it on, and I didn't like it, so I melted chocolate frosting and poured it over the top.  Everyone raved about the cake!  I will definitely make this again.

Good cake and glaze.  I left the cake on the wire rack, held it over the sink and poured the glaze over slowly which worked great.  I liked the cake better than my husband and children.  I like a previous rater's suggestion about the orange rind and extract, because it tastes more lemon than orange.

Sorry, but this was just OK,It was very LEMON tasting, I used vanilla extract but other than that I followed the recipe, it looked great but probably won't make again. My Mom had a recipe similar to this that was made with jello and it is much better! this was way to lemony, maybe I did something wrong SORRY

I choose this recipe for my mother-in-law's 86th birthday cake and everyone loved it.  It is so simple to make and the glaze is a nice light change from thick sweet frostings. It met with everyone's approval.  Glaze amounts could be cut in half and still have plenty.

This cake was moist and delicious. I used natural orange extract  instead of lemon and also added a teaspoon of grated orange zest. It ended up with a wonderful true fresh orange flavor.

I have an orange tree in my backyard and have been trying to figure out what to do with the 50 oranges that we got this year.  This looked like a good recipe to try because it called for real orange juice.  I made this recipe exactly as described, with the exception of the pudding which was vanilla because that is what I had on hand. I overcooked it a bit and the outside was a bit crisp, but the flavor was amazing!  You could taste the fresh orange flavor.  I had family visiting and everyone loved it.  I would make this again.

This cake is so good! I used vanilla pudding, orange extract and like someone suggested, I made the glaze as written in this recipe after cake was cooled, poured glaze into clean bundt pan and put cake back in pan for a minute or so while cake absorbed all of the glaze. Great tip!

I've made this twice, the first time following the directions minus a minor substitution of lemon pudding for vanilla pudding. I didn't find that it had enough of an orange punch so I added a pack of koolaid orange powder mix in addition to the vanilla pudding. I also made a white cake mix so the cake was much lighter than the yellow cake. They turned out amazing. Great for those with a sweet tooth and looking for the kick of orange :-) I reduced a lot of the lemon additives as I found it made it too sour. Great recipe! -CW

Easy versatile recipe. You can change the flavors by changing the cake mix and pudding and the juices. I have made many different cakes from the basic idea. I put a light powders sugar frosting on these or put on a lift glaze while the cake is hot. Fun recipe.

I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, plus 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract, in place of the lemon.  I also added the zest of one orange.  It was so orangey and delicious.  I didn't even bother with the glaze.

Cake was good.  Didn't taste a thing like orange, though.  Should have used vanilla pudding, and then orange extract (versus lemon), and then throw in about a tablespoon or so of orange zest.  Cake was moist and yummy, but again, if you're looking for an orange cake, look elsewhere or "heavy-tweak" this recipe.

I made this with what I had on hand. Lemon cake mix, vanilla pudding, use just a splurge of lemon juice. I used vegt oil  and applesauce (no butter on hand). Add some orange zest and a little pulp. That is creativity and it worked out just fine!

I made this following some suggestions from other readers.  I used vanilla pudding and orange extract in the cake.  It was light and moist.  I used the glaze recipe as stated except I added about a tsp. of orange extract to that as well, trying to get as much orange flavor as possible.  In the end, it was a nice, light, fluffy cake with a light orange flavor.  We like it but it's not our favorite dessert.

I USED THE VANILLA PUDDING AS PER THE REVIEWERS. IT WAS A NICE, MOIST CAKE. MY FRIENDS ALL LOVED IT. I DID SWITCH SUGAR TO SPLENDA, AS 2 ARE DIABETIC. PERSONALLY, I THINK IT NEEDS A LITTLE ICING OR WHIPPED CREAM ON TOP.  AND I THINK I WOULD GRATE FRESH ORANGE PEEL INTO IT AND/OR THE ICING.  BUT WITH ALL THE GREAT RECIPES, I PROBABLY WON;T MAKE IT AGAIN.

Per other reviews, I used vanilla pudding and orange extract, and I brought the glaze to a boil.  Perfect!

Super easy and delish.  Even stays fresh for a few days if you don't pour the topping on it. (keep that separate)   I used the vanalla pudding as suggested.  Loved it.

Like any I like to tweak recipes. I used an orange cake mix and added a 3 oz. pkg. of instant vanilla pudding mix. In place of orange juice I used orange soda/pop/ soft drink plus about a tsp. of orange extract. After baking for about 30 minutes @325 in a convection oven it was done. I let it cool overnight and then I hand squeezed half an orange overthe cake. Then a dusting of confectioner sugar and watch the grandkids wipe it out. I was able to salvage a piece and can attest to its goodness. Very orange taste and moist. One grandchild asked for it as their next birthday cake rather than my famous " flip over cake" ( pineapple upside down in an old iron skillet)

AWESOME cake, with a couple modifications:  I replaced the lemon pudding with vanilla.  I also used orange extract instead of lemon.  I served this New Year's eve and it was a HUGE hit.  My husband and I generally prefer chocolate over fruit flavored desserts, but we both couldn't get over how great this cake was.  I'll be making it again next weekend.

Perfectly delicious! I made these as cupcakes using orange extract instead of the lemon extract and baking for about 25 minutes at 325. They came out golden brown on top and they were light and fluffy on the inside. Yummo!

This didn't last 2 days with only 3 of us eating it.  Easy to make and moist, I left it in a little longer but my oven is pretty old. I just did the old toothpick test. Sooo good!

this was a really good cake.  I had pretty low expectations since i do not like box cake at all.  however i had box of lying around so i decided to try this cake and you can't even tell it came mostly from a box!  I kept the recipe as is except adding the zest of a whole orange and when it was cool i poke holes in it and poured the glaze in (i made double the glaze).  We thought it tasted like orange and it looks beautiful too. definitely a great cake!

This was amazing!  I took some other commenters' advice and used some orange zest in the cake and also in the glaze, and also used chocolate orange extract instead of lemon (in both cake and glaze).  In addition, I used 1 t vanilla extract in the glaze in addition to the chocolate orange extract.  I poked holes in the bottom of the cake and soaked it really good with the glaze before turning it over and glazing the top.  DELICIOUS!!

Holy cow!  This cake is amazing.  I'm the only one in my family who even likes cake, but that notwithstanding the whole family stood at the counter and ate two thirds of the cake as soon as I poured the orange syrup on it.  The baby was even licking up the syrup.  I made it exactly as written.  Fabulous!

This cake was terrific!  Those who asked for smaller pieces at first came back for seconds and thirds.  I used yellow cake mix, french vanilla pudding, orange extract (instead of lemon), vanilla extract (in addition), orange zest (2 tablespoons).  The drizzle/glaze is also fantastic.  This cake and especially with the drizzle made the cake so moist and delicious.  5 stars.  I will be making this again very soon.

Awesome cake! Made it yesterday and everybody liked it at home. But as mentioned in previous reviews, I did a slight variation by using vanilla pudding instead of lemon pudding mix. But still tasted real good. Thanks a lot for the recipe.

I decided to give this cake a try since we have an orange tree full of oranges and well, this cake is DEEE-licious! I substituted half of the oil with 1 cup of apple sauce,  added frozen whole cranberries (cut in half) coated in powder sugar so they don't sink to the bottom of the pan, and after reading other reviews I used orange extract instead of lemon. Oh and I also added a splash of the orange extract to the glaze. It came out fluffy, moist and just wonderful. This is a keeper!

I made this for a bunch of hungry firemen for my husbands birthday.  It was gone in a flash!!!  I only made one tiny change - 2 tsp of orange extract.  This cake was beautiful - baked up so well, not dry around the edges.  Yummy!  A new favorite in our house!!!

Vey little flavor. I assumed white sugar meant, granulated sugar...it make 10 times more than needed because it just puddled up and ran all over the counter. If I made again, I'd try orange cake mix and powder sugar for the topping.

We loved this one!!  I actually made cupcakes instead and they turned out moist and delicious.  Also used the vanilla pudding and orange extract instead.  Topped it off with drizzles of icing made with powdered sugar, orange juice, and orange extract.  Saw where one person added cranberries and would love to do that when the fresh ones are in season.   YUMMY!!

This was just OK.  I did not care for the taste.  I'm not sure if it was the lemon/orange combination.  I will try again trying some of the suggestions by other reviewers.

Great flavor!  I did use vanilla pudding rather than lemon, and I skipped the lemon extract and used about 1 Tbsp of orange zest instead.  I made mine into mini-cupcakes for the office instead of the cake, and I got about 4 doz out of this recipe using mini-muffin tins.  Very easy to make up fast!!  Good recipe --- thanks for sharing!  I will definitely make this again!

This has quickly become a favorite cake in our house and I make it often. However, for those looking for a more orange flavor, I use VANILLA pudding and ORANGE extract, not lemon. It has a beautiful orange flavor. I don't even bother with icing, I just serve with  whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. It is also very good as a breakfast cake. Yum!

I used orange cake mix and vanilla flavoring.  I added 1 cup of chopped fresh cranberries, which was a great addition.  Next time, I think I may make a glaze using Grand Marnier orange liquer.

Amazing cake!  Very light and not too sweet.  As others did, I used vanilla pudding, vanilla extract and made my own glaze of powdered sugar and orange juice.

This cake is incredibly moist and delicious. I served it as "Lemony Orange Cake" b/c that described it better. The only thing I did different was once the cake was cool, I put it back in the pan and poured the hot glaze over it, making sure the excess ran down the middle & sides and let it soak for 10-15 minutes before removing.  This completely encased the entire cake in glaze and locked in the moisture. It was wonderful!

I used freshly squeezed orange juice and the zest of about 1/2 an orange, yellow cake mix, orange cream flavoring (rather than lemon extract), and lemon pudding, yet the orange flavor in the cake was still very faint. Then, I made the 'glaze,' which totally ruined it because it tastes like a greasy topping. I plan on scraping the 'glaze' off and trying to replace it with the orange glaze used in the 'Poppy Seed Bread with Glaze' recipe. I'd have liked this recipe a bit if I hadn't of made 'Key Lime Cake II' the same day .. that cake put this one to shame!

i made this for my husbands birthday. He loved it, as well as the whole family! I didn't use all of the icing though. I think next time I would only 1/4 of the icing. Great recipe! :-)

Very delicious!  Made my house smell heavenly while it baking! The changes I made were similar to other reviews - I used vanilla pudding and orange extract.  Next time I will use a powdered sugar-type glaze rather than the one listed on this recipe.  It is very delicious however I think I'd prefer the ps glaze on it.  My hubby, kids and I couldn't wait to get it out of the oven and try it.  It really is fantastic!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Angie!

I served this to a college group after church one night and they hung around the serving table until it was completely gone. Two days later, I served it at an executive meeting when my husband asked me to prepare breakfast breads. I made blueberry coffee cake, banana bread, and this orange cake. The orange cake was devoured. I did take the advice of taking the cake out of the budnt pan, putting the glaze in the bundt plan, and then putting the cake back in the pan to soak up the glaze, and it takes very little time for the cake to soak up the glaze. I used the OJ and the Orange flavoring to give it a stronger orange flavor. I used vanilla pudding but would like to try it with the lemon for that tangy bite. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

A good, refreshing cake. I was hoping for a bigger punch of orange flavor. I used vanilla pudding and vanilla extract because I didn't want the lemon flavors. I also added about 1T orange zest. It was good--just not as orange as I wanted. I think a dollop of real whipped cream would go really well with this.

This is definately a great recipe!! I was looking for a definate orange flavor cake and I have made the recipe as posted and I feel that is more of a "citrus" flavor with the combination of the lemon and orange. I have also made it as some reviewers have suggested and changed the yellow cake mix for french vanilla, the pudding to vanilla and used orange zest and orange extract and the result was so fresh and wonderfully delish! Thanks for posting this great recipe.

I also would try a different type of topping - something more of an icing than a syrup.  I didn't have vegetable oil so I used 1/4 c applesauce, 1/4 c olive oil and an extra 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda, which substituted fine.  I also used vanilla and almond extract since I didn't have lemon.

Exceptional cake.  However. I was nervous about the icing being too thin and boiled it too long.  Yes, it does get TOO thick if you boil it longer than 5 minutes.  I dribbled it over the cake and it looked great, but the parts that didn't get icing dried out quickly.  Next time I will watch it and find a happy medium.  I can now see the value in covering the entire cake with the icing to lock in moisture.  Other than that, the cake had a very good orange flavor.  I used not-from concentrate juice and a lemon cake mix because that's what I had on hand.  The family enjoyed it and I will probably  make it again with revised icing.

WOW!! Followed other tips, used DH Orange cake, vanilla pudding, orange extract.  LOVED the tip to put cooled cake back in pan to glaze the bottom, then flip out & glaze top.  One thing:  MAKE THE GLAZE, it's delish.  Think syrup, it's yummy & buttery and gives a crusty bite when cool.  Thanks for a keeper!!

This is very tasty! I used vanilla pudding and orange extract. I tried it the second time with applesauce instead of oil, but it wasn't quite as good. I have an orange cake mix that I'm excited to use next time. I made the glaze and tried the 'poke holes in the bottom of the cake' thing, and it was ok. It's kind of frustrating and messy. I think a little bit more of an icing-type glaze would be best.

I only changed a few things. I used a yellow cake mix and orange extract, and I poked holes in the cake so the glaze saturated it.... IT WAS AWESOME. I got so many compliments on it. I have to admit, it is the best.... You have to try it!

I was not impressed at all with this cake. Sure it was easy to make but it did not have the orange flavor that I was looking for. It didn't really have any flavor at all. I even used an orange cake mix. I did omit the lemon extract thinking the lemon pudding mix would be enough. Maybe I shouldn't have, then at least it would have had a lemon flavor.

I love this recipe!  It is super easy and it tastes great.  The buttery flavor of the glaze is to die for.  For a different twist, I add almond extract to the cake and the glaze.  Great recipe!!

One word: DELICIOUS!!!! I took someone else's advice and used a bundt cake coated with Crisco and it turned out really good. Nice presenation. Used slices in my annual cookie trays. Also, I accidently added the 2/3 cup of sugar to the mix and then I realized that was supposed to be part of the glaze. But it turned out really tasty, and no one complained about it being too sweet. I also used an orange cake mix.

Prepared exactly as directed, except I added 1 teaspoon grated lemon peel (dried) to the dry ingredients.  This cake was amazing!  Very light and moist...will definitely be going into my hall of fame collection!!!!!

Easy AND delicious. Even my husband liked it and he's not a big fan of cake. I lowered the fat & calories by using a low sugar cake mix, fat/sugar free pudding mix, olive oil instead of veggie oil, and Splenda & low-fat butter in the icing. Yum Yum! This recipe is a keeper!

This cake is amazing! The best cake I've ever had. Every time I make it, it's gone in a day or two! The neighboors thought it was made by a bakery! They didnt believe that I made it! I could eat this whole thing to myself!

Yummmm...I just made this recipe and it's still warm.  I did use pineapple cake mix instead of yellow and put a little crushed pineapple in the bottom of the bundt pan before adding the finished batter.  It really came out awesome!  I will definately use this recipe for company or get togethers!!  Outstanding!

We really enjoy the subtle citrus taste of this cake and would never compare it to a plain box cake.  It is pretty, flavorful and always a hit.

I made this for my oldest daughter's birthday and she loved it.  So did the rest of my family.  It wasn't a big hit with the other kids, it was just something different.  It was nice and moist.  I made it with instant vanilla pudding and vanilla extract.

I've made this cake three times since I found the recipe.  It was moist and delicious every time.  Last time, I used fresh squeezed orange juice, and added orange zest to the sauce. That made it EXCELLENT!

Really really good.  I felt a tad guilty with all the butter in the frosting, so I halved it, but I know it would have been better with it all on.

The flavor was very good (I used an orange cake mix) but the glaze made it VERY wet. If I made it again, I would use a different glaze for it.

Pretty good and easy.  I also replaced the lemon pudding with vanilla and the lemon extract with orange.  I didn't make the glaze, but I used a cool whip frosting.

I was looking for a different kind of cake to make, and thought this sounded good.  I made it for a co-worker's birthday, and now when it's time for a birthday cake at work, everyone wants the orange cake!  I did use the butter cake mix and orange extract.  It's wonderful!

Now that I made this cake, I will have to join Weight Watchers!  I would give it 6 stars, very easy to make and sooooo good.  I did use vanilla pudding and orange/tangerine juice which was different than what the recipe called for, but I was looking for a real orange tasting cake, and it turned out great!

NOTHING special. Taste just like it sounds, an orange flavored cake mix. Which I guess some people like. I like more variety/homemade

I thought this was ok. It tasted more like lemon cake. I would make it again, but next time I will use some sort of glaze topping rather than the orange juice topping.

This is an excellent cake.  I made with orange extract as I didn't have lemon.
Cut the butter for the glaze back to 3 T. and glad I did or it would taste more
like butter than orange.

I really love cake like this. Its delicious without box cake taste. And the syrup you add on top is a must! I cut the butter in half and the syrup was delicious....also I added only half the lemon extract and added vanilla for the other half...a dreamy flavor.

This was a very tasty cake - my husband loved it. I do not especially care for yellow cake (I'm very picky about cakes - it has to be excellent for me to eat it, otherwise I'd rather have a candy bar :-)), but this was good. I used vanilla pudding and orange extract because that's what I had on hand. I used an extra 1/2 tsp. of orange extract and Tropicana Orange juice (it's not from concentrate so the OJ has a much better taste). I think it had just the right amount of orange flavor. I made this for a friend's birthday and while my husband loved it, no one else made any comments. I think whether or not you give this an average vs. really good rating depends on how much you like yellow cakes, bundt cakes, etc (my husband loves both, I prefer chocolate). Overall, it was good and I would probably make it for my husband again. I do think you could tell it was a box mix though, and it wasn't as moist as I was expecting. The glaze is runny, so I added just a little cornstarch. Remember - even if the glaze drips off that's fine, it's a GLAZE, not icing. If it's too thick you won't be able to drizzle it.

I am giving it four stars becoz everyone liked it. Personally I could feel that it was made from a cake mix. It didn't have the real orange feel. In the glaze I added some tinned tangerines it made a nice thick glaze.

This is an excellent recipe. I made 8 of these as gifts for Christmas. This was so easy and so tasty. I did make a few changes. I used vanilla pudding. For the extracts I added 1 tsp. of Almond, 1 tsp. of butter flavor, 1 tsp of vanilla. I added the extracts to the cake and to the topping and it really added to depth of flavor. I also think poppy seeds would taste good in this. This is a great recipe to have.

This is the Best Cake. I also used vanilla pudding and orange extract. The second time I made it I cooked the glaze an extra 5 minutes and it came out thicker, but remember there is sugar in this and it can turn hard
and burn ones fingers if spilled on.
The second cake was ever better than the first and my Husband wouldn't let me share with the Girls at work.

I've tried several times.  We use vanilla pudding & orange extract.  Next time I'm going to add some orange zest.  When making the drizzle I make less because you don't need it all.

Excellent, moist cake but the glaze was a runny mess.  I will use others' suggestions to substitute powdered sugar and perhaps cook it a little longer & let it cool slightly before drizzling.  I also agree that orange extract instead of lemon will give it more of an orange flavor.

Very Good and Suuuuper Moist. I tweaked it just a bit. Read all the reviews about it not tasting very "orangy" so I used Lemon Cake Mix, and Orange Extract. As suggested by others I used Powdered Sugar instead of regular and dropped a tad of Orange Extract in the glaze. My only problem with the glaze was that is was VERY  runny and it was too much! So next time I think I would cut the glaze recipe in half. But it was very very good, and I will probably be making it quite often this summer.

This turned out well. It was moist with good taste. I used a lemon cake mix vs. having lemon extract on hand.

Despite my using an orange cake mix, and adding, as suggested, orange extract and lots of it, and zest, I found the flavour mildly orange. A better recipe on this web site is the lemon bundt cake by Phyllis which has an intense lemon flavour

This cake is good, except the icing didn't work for me, and it's too sweet.
But still good!

Still had that "boxed" cake taste but was still very good and EASY.  Made this 2x -- first using yellow cake mix and then lemon cake mix.  Preferred lemon cake mix for more citrus taste.  Also added more lemon extract and orange zest to cake mix and glaze.

My husband loves this cake. It is very moist, sweet and delicious (not for dieters). It is a good idea to poke many holes in cake to absorb orange juice, butter and sugar mixture.

We liked this recipe very much but I would love to develope a good orange icening for it instead of or as well as the glaze. As others said I had somewhat of a hard time tasting the orange flavour. It did not take long to disapear. Will make this again soon.

This is really delicious. I've made it several times and everyone always loves it.  As many people have suggested, I used yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding, and way more orange extract and orange rind than specified. I added both extract and rind to the batter, the icing, and then for garnish sprinkled rind over the top.  I find it's even better the more orange flavor you give it.

This is so good - and super easy too!  When making a bundt cake, I'm always torn by making this one or the Banana Pudding Cake on this site also.  

I did have a little trouble with the glaze.  It came out way too runny and wouldn't stick to the cake.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but I think next time I'll just do a powdered sugar glaze mixed with a little orange juice and not use all that butter.

This cake was just terrific. It was so moist and had a fabulous flavor. It stayed very good for two days - before my family of 3 devoured it. We'll definitely be making this recipe again. It will be a great holiday cake! Thanks so much!

This cake is super easy and super tasting. My husband said it is the best cake he's ever had, beating even his grandma's infamous cakes. The glaze really makes this cake! We loved it!! Even my son, who never likes cake, gobbled his piece and begged for more. Thanks for sharing this!!!

My 6 year old daughter wanted to enter the cake bakeoff at the fair for the very first time.  We picked this recipe because it looked easy.  Imagine our shock when we went to see her cake and couldn't find it.  It had won BEST OF SHOW out of hundreds of cakes (even those by adults!). This cake is 5 STARS if there ever was one!

This does taste more like lemon than orange. I may make it again using orange extract instead of the lemon. Very moist and good, though.

SO moist and delicious!  After reading comments regarding too much of a lemony taste, I used orange extract instead of lemon and added the zest of one orange.  It had a great orange flavor! Served it with a dollop of whipped cream and fresh rasberries. Yum!

this is one of the best cakes I have ever made. I used a white cake mix and vanilla pudding and orange extract for this is all I had.You cant judge it until you have the glaze on the cake sparately the cake and sauce are not that great but once the cake soaks up the sause it is to die for. I will not make it often as my husband and I ate it all in less then a day mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

This is a decent cake, but it's not the eighth wonder of the world.

It is very easy to make, and the texture and flavor are good but not fabulous. 

I doubt I'll make it again.

This cake is excellent! I first baked it a 
couple of months ago, and have been wanting
to bake it again. I haven't because the 
problem is I know I'll eat most of it myself-
just like the first one!

This is a very moist and flavorful cake. I think I cooked the orange glaze too long as it became sugary when it cooled down.  My family thought it was a great cake.  A "keeper" in my books.

This cake is EXCELLENT!  I like icing, so instead of the glaze I use the Lemon Icing recipe on this site but replace the lemon juice with freshly squeezed orange juice.  I've made it as a bundt cake, as cupcakes in gold foil liners, and as mini-cupcakes.  The only complaint I have is that if I bake it, I can't stop EATING IT--it is just so good!!

Not sure what happened, but I followed the recipe pretty closely, incorporating the comments to omit lemon extract and substituted vanilla pudding for lemon. The cake boiled over the pan and fell. Tastes good but looks terrible.

This was awesome! I used orange extract instead because a lot of people commented it didn’t have that orange kick! It’s amazing..  I don’t like using a yellow cake mix because it makes me feel like I’m not baking but it was really delicious and the taste made up for that!

Wonderful, delicious cake—and such a different twist on boring boxed cake mix. I followed the recipe, yet added orange zest, and used Vanilla pudding mix, as a popular reviewer mentioned she did. Excellent addition to a perfect and unique dessert. IMPORTANT: A skewer came out clean at 40 minutes for me. Not sure why, but hey, if you are on the fence on this one, hop down and break out your orange juice. I dare say this will not last long on your cake plate.

This is a great really moist cake. I have made it twice now. The first time I tried it with the vanilla pudding and the second time I used the lemon. I have to say I think I prefer the lemon. Yes it makes it have a more citrus flavor but I think that does more for the cake than the vanilla. However in order to add more orange flavor (which I agree it needs) I increased the orange juice for the coating and I mixed in a little bit of confectioner sugar.

Guests raved about this cake! As the cook, I would give it a “4”, only because I may have dried it out a little by cooking the full 60”. In addition to substituting vanilla pudding for the lemon and orange extract for the flavoring, I used frozen concentrated orange juice (undiluted) for both the cake and the frosting and it was really quite yummy. The glaze was a great consistency if taken to the full boil for 2 minutes as directed. No poking of holes was required. Returning the cake to the pan to soak and drench were great tips. There is some runoff of the glaze before it fully crystallizes, but this can be scooped up and spread on top before serving.

Loved it.  Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used French vanilla cake mix, vanilla pudding, orange zest, orange extract, and vanilla. Also followed chubby chick's suggestion on how to glaze it by poking holes in the cake and then pouring the glaze into the bundt pan, then insert the cake back into it and let it sit awhile. I should have let it sit a little longer because some of the glaze didn't soak in and settled onto the cake plate. That's okay, we dragged our slices through the glaze as we put them on our plates. Would definitely make this again!

I was concerned at first how thick it was after mixing. But, it came out so beautifully formed and that glaze OMG! ..it sure adds extra flavour! This is such a moist and delicious cake, I will make this again and again! I had vanilla instant pudding mix on hand so I used that instead of lemon! This is one of those delightful recipes where you can experiment and have fun with flavours and colours!

Wow...this is so good.  I have never reviewed a recipe before but this cake recipe grabbed my attention.  I made it exactly as written with one exception.  I had some left over candied orange peel from another baking project so I thought this would be a great addition to this cake.  So after mixing everything, I folded into the batter about a half cup of candied orange peel and baked.  Yummm.

I made this cake to take to my Wednesday night bible study class.  It was a hit and everyone enjoyed.  I did also use vanilla pudding mix, lemon and vanilla extract plus I added a little over a tablespoon of orange zest to make it more orange.

Very good cake. Light and a nice blend of lemon and orange tastes. I would use confectioner's sugar for the topping instead of white sugar.  The white sugar produces a runny syrup which saturates the cake.

It was good but next time I'll use a lemon cake mix to start,  and forget the lemon extract. I'll increase the juice to 1 cup and melt some orange marmalade to include.  The other thing I'd be tempted to do is poke holes in the finished cake with a toothpick and then pour on the glaze.  It did seem a lot of glaze.
I came home from a potluck with 1/3 or more of the cake.  Doesn't recommend itself very much.

Great recipe. I did use vanilla pudding and orange extract. The cake was like a dreamcicle. I’m sure the lemon would have been great too. The cake was tender and the glaze was delicious.

I made the recipe exactly as it stated since I love lemon cake and all the reviewers said it taste more like lemon cake than orange cake. I have to agree it does have more of a lemon flavor, but for me that is my preference.

This might be a bad thing. It’s so light, fluffy and delicious you might keep eating. Great recipe!  I did use the vanilla pudding like others have said only because that was all I had on hand.  Yummy!

I added orange zest to the batter. For the glaze I used 1 small can of sweetened condensed milk, juice from 1/2 orange, and 2 Tbl. Grand Marnier and orange zest.  I poked holes in the top of the cake to absorb the glaze.  Delicious!

So good. I didn’t use the lemon extract. Instead I used the rind of the oranges I squeezed for juice in both the cake and the glaze.

the cake came out tasty but it really did not have a strong Orange flavor to it. I think the lemon pudding over powered the orange.

Cake was good.  It lacked the orange flavor.  I used vanilla pudding mix instead of lemon.  I cut  glaze sugar to 1/3 cup instead of 2/3 cup and I felt it was still too sweet.  I only used about 3 tablespoons of the glaze, most of it went to waste.  Good cake with a few tweaks.

This cake is so easy and so good.  Like some other reviewers, I substituted  vanilla pudding and orange extract.  I brought it to a dinner party and it was demolished.  The kids especially seemed to love it.  I added a small amount of orange zest to the glaze, but I am tempted to  add more to give that a more citrus punch.  I only used about 1/2 the glaze b/c it seemed too buttery to me.   In hindsight, a mistake, because once on the cake it blended really well.  Am saving this recipe for another gathering or just a treat for the family.

We loved this very moist and delicious cake.  I did make a couple of small changes.  I used vanilla pudding  and subbed orange extract to keep the same flavor profile.  We had it for Christmas so I put clementine segments on top along with sugared leaves.  It looked beautiful with the shiny glaze.

Good moist cake.  I used vanilla pudding in place of lemon and orange extract in place of lemon.  Next time will add some orange zest to the batter.   Will also cook the glaze a little longer until it reduces.  Glaze tasted great but was very runny.

I thought this was delicious.  I would probably call it citrus cake instead of orange.  Orange does not dominate.  I added both orange and lemon zest to the cake and glaze.  One recommendation - allow both the cake and the glaze to cool before covering.  I would also recommend putting the cake on a wire rack and letting the icing drip through, collect it and then pour back over.  It allows the cake to be fully covered with the glaze.

I made this, Thanksgiving the other half wanted something Orange. I used Orange Cake mix and added in some fresh orange zest ,  other then that  followed the recipe .  I did let the topping over heat it came to a boil , so I did not get the sugar crystallize look on the top, but over all was a big success, very moist and full of flavor , a keeper and will be making again.

Cake flavor and texture is good.  The original recipe doesn't say to bring the glaze ingredients to a boil, so I wasn't sure . . . is it really supposed to be that thin? Oh my goodness - did the author of this recipe mean POWDERED SUGAR????? Please amend the recipe to say POWDERED SUGAR!  I'm not the only one who used white granulated sugar. I didn't realize it until I read through at least 25 reviews.

Very good cake!  I took the suggestions of a few reviewers who didn't think the cake had enough of an orange flavor:  I used French Vanilla pudding instead of lemon, orange extract instead of lemon extract, and also added an entire packet of orange Kool Aid to the batter.  I baked it for 48 minutes, then  made the glaze exactly as written.  Once the cake was cooled I removed it from the bundt pan, poured part the glaze (which I boiled for a couple of minutes) into the pan, then put the cake back in the pan so the glaze would coat the sides of the cake as well as the top.  I poked holes in the bottom of the cake and poured the remaining glaze into the holes.  Let the cake sit in the pan for at least 20 minutes to absorb all the glaze before taking it out.  The cake was shiny and pretty, wonderfully moist with a very orange-y flavor and had absorbed all the yummy glaze.  Will definitely make again.

I’m giving it a four cause I made two changes (do to comments).   I changed to one package of orange jello, and I used real butter melted instead of oil.  This cake came out right on.  My husband who is a cake junkie did not even let it get cold and stated to put this on the keep list.

Add grated orange rind for more orange flavor.  Next time too, I will use orange juice with pulp. Nobody knew it was a basic box mix (and I didn’t tell them)!

Delicious and moist- I substituted orange extract for the lemon, used french vanilla cake mix and added a bit of orange zest. The only problem is that it stuck to my bundt pan. Would definitely make this again!

I altered this recipe a bit. Subbed all lemon ingredients with vanilla flavor, and added a heaping tablespoon of orange zest to the batter. Made it with a bundt pan and as cupcakes with orange cream cheese frosting. Excellent!

I made it with the suggested revisions and every last person raved about it for weeks. French vanilla pudding and orange extract. Also added a few drops of extract in the glaze.

This was an amazing cake! I took the advice of using vanilla pudding, and I also used vanilla extract in place of the lemon. Everyone loved it!

I made it and followed the suggestions to use vanilla pudding and orange extract which was marvelous!
The next time I added dried orange peels and skipped the glaze. It tasted just as terrific as our wedding cake!

I used the suggestions from naples34102 since I wanted more of an orange flavor. I'm glad I did, since, even with those changes, the orange flavor wasn't as strong as I anticipated. I could only find a 15 or so ounce box of french vanilla cake mix, kept the measure of all the other ingredients the same, and baked it only 30 minutes, but I thought the cake was just a teeny bit dry. We had it with sliced strawberries, orange-vanilla swirl ice cream, and some of my family added whipped cream. Sadly, the strawberries were wiped out within hours, but the cake is still 3/4 uneaten. I tend to love simple desserts, but I still thought this needed something to stand out. I envisioned some sweetened cream cheese with a little vanilla in the middle, in case someone wants to try that. So, in short, this was good, but not special enough to make again.

This cake turned out delicious. I followed other reviewers and made the following changes: I used vanilla instant pudding instead of lemon, vanilla extract instead of lemon extract, and I added zest from the orange to the cake and to the glaze. I  also used the juice from the oranges that I zested.  Two large oranges gave me almost enough juice which I topped off with juice from carton.

Like another review said I also use vanilla pudding. In addition I add some sour cream or heavy cream whatever I have to make it more dense and moist as I prefer more European styled cakes.

This is a very moist cake, and like other reviewers, we found this more of a citrus cake rather than an orange cake. However, it was still very tasty!!!

I did not go strictly by the recipe, so I am not really in a position to criticize! I used a carrot cake recipe and was a little disappointed in the outcome. After all the wondetrful reviews, I really expected an "orangy:" cake. The cake was good, but NOT the best I have ever eaten. Next time I will use the yellow cake mix!

Favorite summer cake for my family. Used vanilla & vanilla pudding. For company  slice add small dollop of whipped cream & 3 Mandarin oranges in circle. I can't  keep in my house long enough. Grandchildren love it. Hint, put some glaze on bottom then put back in pan to soak it all up. Finish with the rest on top.Mmmm. I've been making for over a year  now.

My 7 year old daughter and I made this cake together.  My daughter said that it was "amazing".  We skipped the topping and we used vanilla cake mix instead of yellow cake mix as it was suggested by another reviewer.  It turned out well and it will probably end up lasting for only few days.

It was okay, but not enough orange flavor. I even added some orange extract. Cake was moist. If I make it again I would make a confectioners sugar icing instead of the one in this recipe. This glaze did not stick to the cake and I poked holes in the cake first.

I followed some of the reviewers' suggestions and used French vanilla cake mix, vanilla pudding mix, orange extract, and 1T of orange zest. Cake turned out beautifully, but I was confused about cooking instructions for the glaze. It's not clear when to begin the 2 min. of cooking. I had to guess. So I waited until the glaze mixture began to bubble and started the 2 min. at that point, with frequent stirring. That seemed to work well. It also wasn't clear whether to cool the glaze before using or drizzle while hot. It worked better for me to use cooled glaze. I also followed the suggestion of returning the cooled cake to the bundt pan and drizzling some of the glaze over what would be the bottom of the cake, allowing the glaze to run down the sides, then waiting a few minutes for the glaze to soak in, before inverting the cake again onto a platter and drizzling the remainder of the glaze over the top and down the sides. I made the mistake of adding some orange zest to the glaze mixture. I wouldn't recommend that. The zested pieces look like little worms on the surface of the cake, but adding orange zest to the batter is a great idea!

Made this for my bible study group.  Everyone loved it.  Came out of the bundt pan with no problem.  Sprayed it with Bakers Joy.  Instead of glace, I used Cool Whip with mandarin oranges.  Would definitely bake again

Used orange extract, cheesecake flavored pudding and fresh blood orange juice with a couple of tablespoons of bottled key lime juice, no lemon flavors at all. Added couple tablespoons of grated blood orange zest to the batter. Didn't make the glaze. Used a little melted orange marmalade instead. Bake in 2 half-size Bundt pans for 35 mins. Delicious and pretty with the blood oranges. Makes a pink cake!

GOOD EASY  Definitly a cake not a loaf.  I used 2 small loaf pans because I wanted to share. I should have used Bundt pan ,it's a cake. But, still fine. I used yellow cake, and vanilla pudding , 
with Lemoncella Liquor , not extract. Did not do zest . I would next time just for a little more orange flavor. Very moist. Glaze 
very nice, but I think I can 1/2 the next time.  I will make again.
Maybe cupcakes for the kids.

SOOO yummy. I prefer to eat this without the glaze. I also add a little orange zest and use orange extract instead of lemon, but I do use the lemon pudding. It doesn't do much but make the cake more moist. I love to make this at Christmas time. Thanks for sharing!

This is a winner!  I did make a few tweaks, however.  I used an orange cake mix by Duncan Hines, vanilla pudding as was suggested by another reviewer, and orange extract instead of lemon.  For the frosting I made a whipped cream cream cheese frosting (my absolute FAV!) and piped it onto the bundt cake.  It got rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  If you're interested in the frosting recipe it's as follows:  Mix 1 - 8 oz pkg softened cream cheese with 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/8 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp orange extract.  In a separate bowl, whip 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream until it forms peaks. Fold into cream cheese mixture into whipped cream.  I also added some orange zest to the frosting and garnished the completed cake with orange zest as well.  (Would have added some to the cake batter, too, but forgot).  Can't wait to have a reason to make it again.  If I made it for just the hubby and me, I would end up eating it all myself!

I normally hate it when people change a bunch of things and write about it, but I did not have orange juice and wanted to make this cake. So I used what I had in the fridge, raspberry lemonade, along with a vanilla pudding mix and the lemon extract. It is really yummy! I think it would be great with some fresh whipped cream and slightly sweetened strawberries! Maybe next time!

Delicious! I followed another reviewers advice and used vanilla pudding, and I also used Orange extract. The glaze was very thin and excessive, if anyone has tips on that I'd love to hear them!

It was a moist cake and a great cake. On 2nd time baking I used vanilla pudding, did 1 cup orange juice, and before letting the icing drizzle I took knife and slit holes all around.  I think the icing needs to be a bit more carmalized

This is a very good cake, but the cake itself does not really have an orange taste as the name implies. I did not have lemon extract so I had to improvise with some lemon zest and just a touch of lemon juice. The cake did not have an overwhelming lemon taste, but a light citrus taste. I really loved the orange glaze with it. This was a big hit with my family and I will definitely make this again!

Best way to add more orange flavor is to add orange zest and omit the lemon extract.  Very yummy!

This cake is also known as Harvey Wallbanger Cake when made with 1/4 cup of Galiano liquer and 1/4 cup of vodka along with 1/4 cup of orange juice as the liquid in the batter. I agree that the pudding mix should be a white mix. If you use all or part Galiano for the glaze , and don't boil the alcohol off, the cake will have a nice punch. The cake itself will be alcohol free as it will evaporate as the cake bakes, leaving only the flavors.

This is seriously a great cake, and it's easy to make. I read the reviews of others and here are the changes I made: used Duncan Hines Orange Supreme cake mix, vanilla pudding mix (accidentally got cook and serve instead of instant but the cake was delicious), and used vanilla instead of lemon extract. The cake had a great orange flavor, and the glaze added some extra sweetness and orange flavor. I made it for a few friends who came over for dinner, and they all loved it. It is a satisfying dessert, but not overly heavy.

This cake is much better to me using Duncan Hines Orange cake mix and orange jello instead of the vanilla pudding.  Everything else the same.

So I've baked this cake twice now...
The first time, after reading several of the reviews, I used vanilla pudding instead of lemon, orange extract instead of lemon extract, AND I added the orange zest. Oh no, no, no!  That was WAY too "orangy!!"
The second time I made it, I changed only two things from the original - I used vanilla pudding and I changed the name of the recipe on my printed copy to "Citrus Cake"!  That one was good!

I saved this a couple of years ago and have made it often. I use vanilla pudding and no lemon extract as many of the other reviewers. Everyone always loves it and it is so easy to put together.

I have made this a few times and my family loves it. The first time followed the recipe as written and was happy with it.  Since than I have sometime made modifications like using lemon cake or have used orange extract. I have for an adult crowd, substituted half the orange juice for Cointreau--making it into an Orange version of a Rum Cake.

I searched for a recipe to use up some oranges that I had purchased and wanted to use up.  I read the reviews but decided to follow the recipe.  The ONLY thing I did different was to use Splenda in the sauce to pour over the top, so it was not as shiny. The liquid poured over it was also absorbed in the bottom.  Since I used real oranges it had pulp in it.  The results? Awesome!  Yes, it did taste more lemony.  But my husband loves it, as did my daughter.  I will make this again, and again, and again...

This is five star-worthy if you use vanilla pudding (lemon totally alters the flavor and makes it a lemon cake) and add orange extract AND orange zest. I also found that making a glaze of orange juice and powdered sugar worked better than the orange syrup called for here. A great idea and I will make it again, but with the above-mentioned changes.

I haven't tried this recipe but I was searching for a recipe for a cake I made many years ago,
My Dad loved the cake so much that even now when I eat orange cake I am reminded of him (he passed away 10 years ago).
I had purchased an orange a cake mix years ago and I don't recall the brand name but I am certain it was called "Sunkist Orange."
I haven't been able to find an orange cake mix in Canada for several years but I have found them in Niagara Falls New York.
The orange cake mix with the instant vanilla pudding and grated orange rind works great.

One star off because I don't believe it can be made with lemon extract and be called an orange cake. It tastes like a wonderful lemon cake though.
 
My second time around I used Sharree28's most excellent tips [that made great sense!] and made cupcakes. Very moist, very delicious.  Instead of 4 eggs, I used 3 extra large, and I accidently used sugar free jello [all I had in the house] They came out dense, with nice crumb and very moist. They raised wonderfully well.
 
If you want an orange cake, stay away from any lemon extra, use orange and extra orange zest, omit the vanilla and you are good to go. If you want a great lemon cake, then this is for you. :)

Amazing!! I turned this recipe into cupcakes & filled the tins about5/8 full & baked at 300 for about 35 mins!yields about 18 cupcakes that full!  I even put some semi sweet chips in some & that turned out amazing!!! I used the French vanilla cake, orange extract & orange zest that was suggested in another review & just fell in love with this recipe!! Don't even need icing or frosting!!

Everyone like it more than I did. I thought it was more lemon than orange. I also thought it had a little "boxed" flavor.

This was good but still had a "box cake" taste.  The best part is where the topping penetrates the cake.  I don't know if anyone else did it (can't read ALL the reviews" but it might work better as a sheet cake so you get more glaze in every bite.

Absolutely sweet and delicious!   Used vanilla pudding instead of lemon and 1 t orange extract insead of vanilla.   After the cake cooled, I poured 1/2 glaze into bottom of bundt pan.  Put cake into pan to let glaze soak in. Poked holes on bottom of cake (part facing up) and poured rest of glaze over it.  Flipped back onto cooling rack after about 15 minutes.

Total winner. You can't go wrong.  I make it with the vanilla instant and have made it with with the lemon extract, then lemon extract with orange zest and it came out great! I also made it once using vanilla pudding that was NOT instant.  And truthfully it came out a little dry to me so I don't recommend it.  Today I am making it with the orange extract and I am SURE it will be wonderful.  A keeper and will be adopted as a "family" recipe! Thank you for sharing!

Followed the directions except I used vanilla instead of lemon pudding (it's what was available).  The cake was great and my husband asked that I make it for Easter.  The second time I added a cup of sour cream and orange zest to the batter and 1/2 teaspoon of soda to the glaze.  Great Cake.  Thanks for the recipe

I actually didn't have any of this cake but the teachers at my daughter's school raved about it. I made it for teacher apprecitation day.

I didn't have a yellow cake mix on hand, so I used a chocolate mix instead, and it turned out great!  I also  used vanilla pudding mix and vanilla extract per other reviews.  Very moist and yummy!

I agree with most people who rated this previously that this is a delicious moist cake with a few minor changes.  I changed out lemon pudding for vanilla pudding and added fresh orange zest instead of lemon flavoring and this cake was a huge hit at a family gathering!!  Easy to make and glaze was fantastic!!

I loved this cake!  I enjoy cakes that dont need a lot of sugary frosting to taste good. I would rename this citrus cake though so that the name is not too misleading.

This was soooo easy and yummy.  I left the cake in the pan then I poured the glaze on top of it so it will soak through.  I will cut the glaze down a little bit the next time I make it because it was too much.  The middle of the cake was almost soggy.

This was fantastic! I used yellow cake mix (which helps give it a healthy orange color), vanilla pudding, and orange extract. I let the glaze to a boil for a scant three minutes, stirring constantly. I brought it to a work function today and it was gone within the hour. Great recipe.

I LOVED this cake. It tastes just like a cake my grandmother used to make. I added the zest of an orange and used vanilla extract and vanilla pudding. I made a glaze of fresh squeezed OJ, powdered sugar and a dash of butter extract. I poked holes in the cake with a fork when it was still warm and let the glaze seep in. The next morning my coworkers said it was DELICIOUS. Thanks!

The cake was REALLY good and moist at the bottom.  I used a lemon cake mix w/ orange extract and some orange zest.  However, I did not care for the butter flavor in the glaze and would look something else next time.  Otherwise, YUMMY!

Simple but quite yummy! I did not have lemon extract in the house so I used orange zest. The glaze soaking into the bottom of the cake was a surprise...a pleasant one :-)

This cake was ok.  I used French vanilla cake mix, vanilla pudding, and orange extract (instead of lemon).  It still has the taste and density of a box cake though.

I changed mine to a orange rum cake.  I actually used blood orange juice and orange extract instead of the lemon.  I also switched the lemon pudding for vanilla.  I added 1/3 cup rum to the cake recipe and then used a rum cake glaze on the bottom of the cake while it was still hot.  Once cooled I used the glaze from this recipe on top.  OK - this cake was to die for.

This is so good!  The only thing I changed was that I used vanilla pudding instead of lemon.  I think I will halve the glaze for next time because it made a lot.  The cake doesn't need that much because it is so moist to begin with.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I have made this cake twice and although, I am known for my pound cakes, this cake that I made for a family Easter dinner, has put me on the map.  I used the french vanilla cake mix, vanilla pudding, orange extract and orange juice.  I also add 1/4 tsp mace which I add to all cakes and I used almost a tablespoon of the orange extract.  I am interested in knowing if this recipe can be adjusted for various flavors;ie. chocolate, lemon, rum etc. etc.  This cake is a winner!

Everyone loved this cake! I too used orange extract instead of lemon and although it didn't taste like an "orange" cake it was good. I'd call it a Citrus Cake. Used a cream cheese/whipped cream frosting (Called Whipped Cream Frosting on this site) in between the layers as well as on top. Also put some sliced strawberries in between the layers. Will definitely make again.

This was very, very good. It was almost too rich for me, but my boyfriend loved it so I still gave it 5 stars! It smelled delicious while it was cooking. I followed other reviewers in substituting orange extract and vanilla pudding mix.

I had to make something for our family 4th of July cookout. I saw my rarely used bundt pan, and I decided to find a recipe. I am not known for my baking. At all. But I made this, with a few substitutions, and it was DELICIOUS! EVERYONE loved it!! 

I did what was suggested by others and used the vanilla instant pudding. I also made the glaze with powdered sugar, which I think thickened it up a little, and I put it on by poking holes in the top and bottom and drizzling it in. 

We ate it with some whipped cream and strawberries, which was so good. I'm eating a leftover piece today, and I don't have strawberries, but it's almost as good with just the whipped cream. 

I will definitely make this again. I think it's going to be my new thing to take to potlucks and to friends for new house/new baby/etc.

Delicious Recipe but not orange flavored.  The "glaze" was very runny.  I drizzled it on as the recipe said and then had to wait for a while for the next drizzle to prevent pooling.  Besides the decidedly lemon flavor, though, it was quite good.  I made it for my mom's birthday and she loved it.  I think next time I'll follow the other reviews and make it with vanilla pudding and orange extract.

I used orange extract in this one, but it didn't help as much as I thought it would.  I'll probably double the amount, and with the vanilla pudding (versus my lemon jello powder), it will most likely taste much more orange-y.

I made the recipe as is.  It was easy to make and tasted plenty orange to me.  I let the glaze set out for awhile so it wasn't so runny and allowed it to slowly absorb into the cake.  Everyone loved the flavor and how moist it was.

I made this for a crowd & every piece was devoured- tons of compliments!  I followed the original recipe, except with the glaze step.  I put the cooled cake back in the pan and "painted" the glaze on with a basting brush, flipped it back out and "painted" the tops and sides.  I did a thin layer, let that soak in for a few minutes, then repeated until glaze was gone.  If you tried to use all the thin glaze at once, it would just run off.  By allowing it to slowly soak in, I ended up with a deluously moist cake!  (It does taste more like lemon, but I was fine with that!)

Mmmmmm! This was delicious! I would say it is more a lemon cake than orange, but either way, it was really good. It was a hit at my husband's work party. The glaze was very liquidy and not as thick as I would have liked.  But I will definitely make this cake again.

This wasn't that great. I had high hopes, but it fell flat. Probably won't make again.

Great base recipe. I have made this a lemon cake by follwing the instructions as written and adding lemon zest. When I want the orange cake I use orange extract in place of the lemon and vanilla pudding --plus I pureed a can of mandarin oranges and used them in place of the juice. Comes out really good.

This was an AWESOME orange cake...best I ever tasted, too!!  Of course, I made some changes.  Ha.  As suggested, I used vanilla pudding instead of lemon.  And I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  Used orange extract instead of the lemon.  For the glaze, I grated the peel of an orange, and then squeezed the juice from that orange to add as a thickner with the powdered sugar.  It was a nice, thick consistancy and had a very orangey flavor.  Just make sure to strain the seeds from the juice before you add it to the powdered sugar.  I do have a lemon cake recipe that is very similar to this.  But uses lemon jello instead of pudding.  However, I like this variation a lot.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Such an excellent cake recipe and extremely easy when you're not in the mood for a more elaborate and time-intensive recipe. I typically skip the glaze as I find the cake sweet and moist enough to stand alone. Next time I'm tempted to try a crumb or nut topping as it could use a varied texture. Excellent excellent recipe.

I love this cake!  I made it a couple of years ago for a co-workers birthday and it has been a favorite ever since.  My hubby will beg me to make this for him about 3 times a year and always for his birthday.  When I moved from the East Coast to a high-altitude area this is one recipe that I did not have to make changes to for it to stay perfect.

This recipe is a hit - the orange flavor is not overpowering so that it goes well with coffee or other beverages and the glaze is wonderful.

To die for!!! My new favorite cake of all time! I swear that I can eat this cake whole by myself (there's actually some truth to that---I ate almost one all by myself ^-^ )! So addicting too---my co-workers fought over it when I brought some to the office! I'm sorry but I admit that I did change/add some special ingredients to it but I'm sure the cake would've been great as is. Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing your recipe with us!!! I'm afraid of gaining 100 lbs from this cake alone!

OH my! This was awesome! I agree it was more a general citrus flavor rather than orange, but was so good. Added some chocolate chips. Thanks to the previous reviewer who said to have the glaze sit and cool - I am new to glazing and this one came out the best for me. Thanks!!

Not super impressed with this one.  Orange taste was definitely there, but was not strong enough...seemed like a regular pound cake with orange flavoring added. Not one I would make again.

Wonderful moist cake ! Just made with an orange cake mix , sugar free vanilla pudding and added some sugar free orange jello as well. I also added a tsp of orange jello powder and cornstarch to the icing. Orange cake is a treat , not your same old chocolate !

I made this cake for a birthday at work. As it has been 95 degrees outside we wanted something cool and refreshing.  I made the cake using cheesecake sugar free jell-o pudding, added 1 tsp of orange extract, 1 tsp vanilla extract (going for an Orange Dreamsicle taste). I poured the batter into a 9x13" pan and turned it into a Jell-O poke cake. After it baked, I stirred a small pkg orange Jell-o into 1 cup boiling water, stirred to dissolve. Poke warm cake with large for randomly and spoon hot jell-o over it. Refrigerate until chilled and spread 1 8oz tub Cool Whip over the top. Very refreshing.

This is the best cake ever!  I used vanilla pudding mix, omitted the lemon extract and added some orange zest.  Very moist.  I topped with a cream cheese frosting with some orange zest mixed in.  Yum!!!

I made this cake for Easter Sunday.  Not only was it easy to make but it was a wonderfully light desert.  Many comments, and it freezes well.  I will use this recipe again.

This cake wasn't as dense nor as rich as I thought it would be but I added a few dollops of slightly watered-down vanilla yoghurt to each serving of cake and a Danish butter cookie and everyone seemed to be quite please with the light desert after our heavy meal.

I made this for a family get together and everyone loved it!  Trust me, you have to try making this cake -- it was easy and fast and everyone will go crazy for it.  There are so many fancy decorative Bundt bans available these days - try getting one of these for an added effect.

I made this cake because of the reviews.  While it was a very good cake, it was nothing great.  I always try the 5 Star recipes so I thought I'd give this one a try.  I will make it again, it was very good, just not great:)

This cake was pretty good, but tasted more lemon than orange.  Still it was easy and my family enjoyed it.  I used tangerine/orange juice like another reviewer.

Excellent lemon flavor, very moist.  I'll probably try to find a recipe from scratch though, it was a lot of steps to use a boxed cake mix.

Delicious cake and so easy.  For the glaze, I added one teaspoon of orange flavoring and used two tablespoons of margarine instead of four tablespoons of butter.  Patting the glaze on with a pastry brush assures all the glaze  willl be used and absorbed into the cake.  This is what makes it so good.

I thought this cake was good, but not as fabulous as others hyped it up to be.  Oh, and the icing was ridiculous.  If I had drizzled all of it over the top of the cake like the recipe says, it would have run all over my counter and then on to my floor.

My family really enjoyed this cake. It was nice and light in texture (not as "heavy" as other cakes), not too sweet and it had a light mellow orange flavor. I did not use the icing recipe given, instead I combined powdered sugar with orange juice and orange zest and added orange food coloring to the icing. After drizzling the icing on the cake I sprinkled orange and lemon sugar crystals (the sugar crystals were really pretty on the cake). The only reason why I did not give it five stars was that I expected a "stronger" orange flavor. Nonetheless, a wonderful light cake-perfect for summer!

The cake was delicious! However, the topping just didn't cut it. I think some sort of icing would've been better.

WONDERFUL CAKE! Very Easy, and everyone loves it! My husband is normally a chocolate-only dessert guy, and he can't get enough of this cake.

This was wonderful! I made two 9" round cakes and gave one away to neighbors. That was a BIG mistake; I could have eaten both of them! This is now officially my favorite cake.
The glaze is VERY SWEET, but I like sweet things.

Very moist and tasty!  I added 1 teaspoon of orange zest, and used real juice from the orange for 1/2 of the juice required.  I also added 1 teaspoon of zest to the sauce.  Not overly orangy, in fact, my family could not decipher between orange and lemon, but they liked it!

Delicious, but I had to make a few changes to get the orange taste that I wanted.  The first change; I used vanilla pudding instead of lemon.  The second change; I used orange extract instead of lemon with a few extra drops.  The final thing I did is used fresh squeeze orange juice in the glaze and placed the cake on a rack over a pan and painstakingly kept reusing the glaze that rolled off the cake into the pan, until it was all soak in.  With those changes; the family gave it a 5 star rating.

This cake was very tasty and nice and moist, but it really isn't very orange-y.  I used orange extract instead of lemon and it still wasn't terribly orangey.  It's a pretty basic yellow bundt cake.  Good, but not the orange cake I was looking for.

wow, what a great recipe!  the cake turns out beautiful and moist and using fresh squeezed orange juice, gives the cake an aromatic and delicious flavor.  I substituted fresh lime juice instead of the lemon extract and cut down the white sugar in half.  the glaze gives more of a buttery-orange finish than a typical sugar-glaze.  i think it is superb ;)

This was a good cake, but wasn't as 'orange' tasting as I was hoping for, even after adding about 1 tsp orange zest to the batter. Maybe try orange extract instead of lemon next time? And the glaze was runny as others have noted. We improved the orange flavor by drizzling some Grand Marnier over individual slices!!

My aunt gave me this same recipe about 5 years ago, only it calls for vanilla pudding. It has always been one of my favorites and I fix it often. I sometimes add more juice and double the amount of pudding. It makes it really gooey!!

This is the moistest cake I've ever made so far.. it's easy to make...I don't think the glaze is necessary because the cake itself is already sweet enough.. Overall this is a good cake, thanks for sharing the recipe :)

Very Good.  I've made this cake quite a few times and it doesn't stay in the house for long.  I need to get the "drizzle" part (Step 4) down to a scince because the glaze usually falls everywhere except for the cake !!

This was a very good cake.  I gave it four stars because the glaze was very runny and I ended up using a glaze that called for powdered sugar instead.  Overall it has a great flavor, but be sure not to overcook it.  It really comes out of the bundt pan nicely.

cake was excellent, only problem i had was with the baking time - said 50-60 minutes, more likely 1.25 hours, at the very least.

dh thinks glaze unnecessary, however, glaze made this cake go from "amazing" to "are you kidding me?" in two minutes flat (the time it took to boil the glaze...)

This cake was surprisingly good.  It turned out moist and light, and tasted refreshing and tangy.  I used vanilla flavoring instead of lemon, but next time I think I will use orange flavoring.  The only other change I made was to the icing.  I used softened butter, confectioner's sugar and orange juice to make a nice glaze for the cake.  I drizzled it over the cooled cake, and it was great.  I'll be making this one again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I doubted the claims of best tasting cake ever. But, when I took my first bite I am a believer. I didn't have lemon pudding so I used vanilla, like others said, this cake is so moist and tasty. Just fantastic.

This didn't last a day at our house! I made 1/2 the cake and I ate it all myself!  I wished I made more.  I too followed past reviews, and omitted the lemon extract and used vanilla.  I also used freshly squeezed oj and had no veg. oil (I know!) and used melted veg. shortening instead.  I didn't make the frosting, so I just had it plain and it was delicious! (Note: I tasted the cake right out of the oven and thought it was gross and when I tasted it later in the day when it was cooled, it was fantastic!) Thanks!

This cake is very moist and tasty although it didn't really have much of an orange taste to me. It had more of a lemony taste. I think the next time i will use orange extract.  Also I think the glaze would be better if confectioners sugar were used instead of plain white sugar.

I was skeptical at first, but after tasting this cake I'm a believer!  The orange flavor is just enough to make it a little different.  I think the best part is the icing.  To help the icing drip directly into the cake I poked holes all over the top.  This recipe is in my permanent collection, Thanks Angie!

Great cake.  A hit with friends and family.  Have used orange cake mix and substituted orange liquor for some of the juice; turns out well.

I did not make this recipe but read it off to my grandmother over the phone. I'm reviewing this recipe on her behalf since she does not know how to use a computer.  She said it turned out terrific and was has a different but very unique taste.  My mother absolutely loved it and wants it made in a 9x13 inch pan with the glaze doubled and small holes poked all in the cake for the glaze to soak through.  I can't wait to make it myself.  Thanks for sharing Angie.

I made this cake for someone who doesn't like icing. Everyone really enjoyed this cake, including me, but it didn't "wow" me like it seemed to everyone else. It was a good cake, but I probably won't make it again unless someone asks for it. Easy to make.

Delicious and very moist. I made this for my mom's birthday yesterday and she loved it! The glaze tastes much better once it's actually on the cake. Also I should've waited for it to thicken a little before adding it, but it was still great!

This cake was incredible!  Even my husband ate it up and he doesn't care for yellow cakes.  It did taste more like a lemon cake than orange but it was still delicious.  I didn't use the glaze.  Instead, I put vanilla buttercream icing and replaced vanilla extract with lemon extract. GREAT!

I made this cake last week and it went in just a few days... it was excellent!!  My husband absolutely loved it! I didn't have lemon pudding in the house so I used vanilla pudding in the mix and added a little more lemon extract.  It was fabulous.  Thanks for the recipe.

Sorry folks, I just didn't think this cake was all that great.  It was "okay," but I've had much better  orange/lemon cakes.    I don't think I'll make this one again.

I LOVE THIS CAKE!  It is so easy, which is my kind of recipe. I use 1 can of frozen orange juice concentrate, and it is enough for the cake and the glaze.  Also, I "basted" the glaze on the last few times I have made this to get a nice crust on the cake and not waste so much glaze by having it run all over. Will make again and again.

Served it at my last dinner party.  It was a crowd favorite.  Super easy to make.  Most heard comments was how MOIST it tasted.  Citrus lovers will adore the flavor....everyone else will just appreciate it's change of pace from the norm.  Probably not going to make it into Gormet magazine, but certainly worth your time to try.

Yummy!  Can I make one suggestion though?  I think the next time I make it, I will heat up the glaze as directed, but instead of pouring it on a cooled cake, I will pour it INTO the pan as soon as I take it out of the oven.  This way, it can absorb into the cake, making it even moister.  Yummy!

Awsome cake, but I did some changes on it. I used a round pan (for cheesecakes)anstead the bunt pan. And for the orange juice in the cake I used frozen concentrated orange juice to make it even richer. I didn't use the iceing as listed either, used the french butter icing and omitted the butter flavor to exchange it with orange flavor. It was such a rich and great tasting cake. Next time I try the orginal recipe and see if there is a big diffrents for the cake flavor itself.
Great recipe!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I changed the yellow cake mix to orange cake mix, orange extract instead of lemon and added a lot of powdered sugar to the icing to give it a thick consistency.  Wonderful!

Made this for Easter with a Pineapple Glace.  Now, my mom is requesting it as her 55th wedding anniversary dinner.

Imagine my surprise when I tasted lemon as opposed to orange.  Orange extract might help. Probably won't make again.

Cake was good, but not great.  Flavor seemed much more lemon than orange. Probably wouldn't make again.

I wanted to be sure and get an orange flavor, so I used orange extract rather than lemon and increased amount a bit. It surely tasted great to me and my family enjoyed.

I am a "born again baker" and this was my first cake.  You don't know how good I felt when everyone wanted more.  That was 11 months ago and my friends are still requesting this cake.  Thank you Angie!

I was disappointed in this cake.  It wasn't that great, and it tasted more like lemon cake.  Probably won't make this one again.

I served this at a brunch, and it went quick! Got lots of raves and requests for the recipe.
Very easy to prepare, too. My husband is already calling it a family favorite.

The cake tastes great.

The glaze just ran off the sides so if I did it again I would let the glaze thicken before pouring or else just pour it over the cake while the cake was still in the pan.

A good friend with whom I shared this recipe called me today to let me know it was a big hit at her house. She plans to make it again soon to take to the next neighborhood potluck dinner, so she asked me to print extra copies of the recipe she can distribute at the dinner.  Sounds like a winner to me!
