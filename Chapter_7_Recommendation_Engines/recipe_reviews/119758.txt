This would get five stars but for needing a few tweaks. For starters, the extra 1 1/2 cups of mashed potato is totally unnecessary, and just adds a time consuming extra step. The pulp alone is just enough to fill these beautifully. I used a chive cream cheese blend, and to top, I mixed the cheddar with 2 tablespoons each of parmesan and bread crumbs with a drizzle of melted butter. As we had the bbq on anyway, I just put these on the top rack while the meat was grilling, to warm them through and crisp the topping. My hubby said they tasted just like sour cream and chive potato chips and the kids just loved them too. This will be our go to recipe for twice baked potatoes from now on.

I thought this recipe was great! The only thing is the mashed potatoes. After removing the filling from the baked potatoes, I had a ton of filling already. There was no need to add additional mashed potatoes. I left that part out and kept everything else the same. Great flavor and everyone raved!

Oh my.  The ranch did something so wonderful to the flavor of this recipe. This came out so good.....and I didn't even have the cream cheese.  I added a little more milk until it was creamy mashed potatoes and just a little salt and it was perfect!!!!  Didn't even miss the cream cheese but I know if I had it, it would be over the top!!!

Fantastic, tangy potatoes!  After reading the reviews, I opted not to use the extra mashed potatoes, and the previous reviewers were correct, there is no need.  The pulp from the potatoes was more than enough with the added ingredients to fill the skins.  Since I was already baking chicken in the oven, I just put these in along with it, skipping the microwave cooking.  These were creamy, tangy, and delicious!

Such a tasty recipe!  The ranch dressing made all the difference!!  I added green onions to the mixture which also added to the flavor.

Added a little whipping cream bc I had it. Also not quite a pkt of ranch, and they were very ranchy, but yummy! Also only micro'd first round, baked second.

This is a great recipe, but the additional potatoes are not necessary.  I changed it up a bit, I used sour cream, green onion, chopped cooked bacon, cheddar cheese grated, mixed and stuffed - then added more cheese on top..... awesome.

Like many other reviewers, I left out the additional mashed potatoes.  I also added more than a 1/4 cup of cheddar on top of the potatoes.  The recipe calls for one packet of dressing mix and said that it is 1 ounce, but the Hidden Valley packet was only .04 ounces.  I wonder if that is why some are saying they were perfect and others are saying they were too salty.  I found the .04 ounces to be the right amount for the amount of mashed potatoes.  I also finished the potatoes off in the oven and not in the microwave.

ADDING THE RANCH MIX IS A NICE TWIST. DIDN'T USE THE MASHED POTATOES, BECAUSE IT IS NOT NEEDED.  ALSO ADDED CHOPPED BACON DELETED THE CREAM CHEESE, AND ADDED SOUR CREAM AND GREEN ONIONS

These were yummy but I do admit I made several changes based on what I had. Firstly, I oven-baked the potatoes just because I had the time (I do normally microwave-bake). I didn't have the ranch dressing mix powder, so I used prepared dressing, about 1/4 cup (I also made two potatoes, as well).  I used about 2 tbsp of butter instead of cream cheese and omitted milk since I used prepared dressing. There is NO need at all for additional mashed potatoes, the guts of the potates I'd baked was more than enough to stuff into the shells. I do think this would have been even better with the powder dressing mix  instead of dressing, but I loved the idea of ranch twice baked potatoes so wanted to make it work with what I had and it came out well! (Here is where I will also admit I ate both of the potatoes myself.)

I served with steak and Jamies cranberry spinach salad (from this site); what a great dinner.  I did add about 1/4 c sour cream and to the mixture and served with sour cream.  I did not use the extra potatoes as others called for.  Very good alternative to regular potatoes.  Yummy

Like others I didn't need any extra mashed potatoes.  I cooked the baked potatoes in the microwave but reheats on the grill seen as we were grilling pork chops anyway.  A little cooking spray on the potato shells helped to crisp them up.

I have done similar for an appetizer at a restaurant I had worked at, except I didn't include extra mashed potatoes (I used only what was scooped from the baked potatoes).  Also I did not add cream cheese to mine.  The flavor of Ranch potatoes are definitely great.

These had too much salt for me. Too much work for what I could do quicker too. I will pass on these, but thanks!

Made these potatoes for a dinner party the other night.  They were good for a change to the regular twice baked potatoes I make.  I did bake mine in the oven, prepared ahead in the morning and finished baking in the oven just prior to eating dinner.  I used 8 potatoes because of the number of guests, I used chive/onion cream cheese (doubled), 4 T. milk plus, did not use the added mashed potatoes, I agree with other reviews that this step was not necessary and added some cheese to the potatoes mixture prior to topping with the remaining cheese. I did only use 1 package of the ranch salad dressing mix, because I was afraid of making the potatoes too salty.  I may try making this recipe as stated next time.

Very yummy!  You do not need the extra mashed potatoes, just use the potato that you scoop out, you'll have plenty.  Best part, these freeze really well.

I've made this recipe several times and my boyfriend and his son love it! I added an extra ounce of cream cheese and left out the extra mashed potatoes since I felt there was plenty from the baking potatoes. I also threw them in the oven instead of making the whole dish in the microwave and I think it helps it. They are delicious!!

First time I made double-stuffed potatoes. I didn't use the extra mashed potatoes...they were already full enough. Very filling! I had a bigger package of ranch dressing so I didn't add as much but I wish I had have added more. I also added more cream cheese but that's just because my potatos were weird sizes.Good easy recipe.

This is my kind of recipe!  I didn't have to turn on the oven!  I bake my potatoes in the microwave anyway, so putting this one together was a snap - the ranch made a huge difference!

I made this recipe a couple of months ago and it has already become one of my wife's favorites.  I 
add about equal amounts cream cheese & sour cream.  I also add 1 rasher of bacon for each potato, cooked crisp and crumbled, and some finely chopped onion.  YUMMMM.  You don't want to add too many things from the basic recipe, it is scrumptious enough on it's own.

This recipes was very delicious. I DID make some changes. I used 4 large russet potatos. I am not a fan of ANYTHING microwaved so I baked the potatos for about 1.5 hours the night before. I used a full container of fat free cream cheese (8 oz), a full bag of reduced fat cheddar cheese (most of it I mixed right into the potato mix and sprinkled the rest on top). I used one package ranch as called for. ALSO, I had some thick cut bacon and left over steamed broccili that I chopped up and threw in. My boyfried usually doesn't like twice baked very much but when he tried these...instant hit! I did change the recipe alot, however, the ranch packet is what I enjoyed so much about this recipe. Never thought of using that. Hope this helps. Would be 5 stars but the instructions say MICROWAVE...OooOo

We really enjoyed these! I also omitted the extra mashed potatoes, because I felt that there was no need for them, but I did reduce the dry ranch mix since I was using less potaotes (kept everything else the same). I finished these off in the oven because I had it on for something else anyway. This is a definate repeat recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

I would have given five stars, had it not been for this recipe’s need for tweaking. First, I completely agree with the other reviewers: there was no need for the additional mashed potatoes, so those were omitted; and I still had filling to spare. I substituted whipping cream for milk, which was merely a preference. Also, once blended, the potato consistency was a bit mealy, so I had to use more than just the two tablespoonsful. I wasn’t measuring, but would probably guess the final call was close to a half cup (this might have been due in part to the potatoes’ being quite large; then again, I used three potatoes instead of four, so who knows). The only other thing I did differently from there was actually incorporating the cheddar cheese into the potato mixture before filling the shells, then topping them with additional cheddar. All in all, they came out pretty fantastic! Next time I’ll be trying these in the oven.
