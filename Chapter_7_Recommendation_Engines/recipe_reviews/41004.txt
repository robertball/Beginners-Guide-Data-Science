This dressing was quite tasty.  It was a bit runny I thought so I had to add a little extra mayo.  Had great garlic flavor however.  I will make it again, only I'll experiment a little with the seasonings as it was a little too bland for my taste.  Good basic dressing recipe.

This dressing is one of our favorites.  For a southwestern flavor I use cilantro instead of parsley and add red chili pepper to taste.

Mmmmmm!!!!!  This is the first homemade salad dressing I've put together (aside from balsamic vinaigrettes), and I thought it was very good.  I made it this morning so the flavors would be well blended by dinner time.  My mom and I thought it tasted a lot like ranch, but without that... storebought fake flavor!  The only thing I may have changed is I probably put in more green onions and used minced garlic from the jar. And I used reduced fat buttermilk and a mix of regular and fat free mayonnaise (next time I'll do all fat free). Oh and like some others have said, it thinned a bit since this morning, but that's fine with me because super thick store bought dressing kinda grosses me out.  This is definitely a repeat!  Thank you very much for the recipe!
