I made this pasta salad for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit!!  Everyone enjoyed it, including my husband who is not a fan of pasta salad.  I do want to make two suggestions.  First, because I was taking this to a family get together, I felt the 6 servings shown on the original recipe would not be enough so I doubled it to 12 servings.  Don't do that!!  It turned out to be more like 30 servings.  Also, I'm not a chef but I love to cook and the "Prep Time" of 30 minutes turned out to be more like 60 minutes!!  Just something to keep in mind.  Otherwise, thanks for a great recipe, Heather!  This one is a keeper!!!

I tweaked this recipe a little. I added mild banana pepper rings and paprika for a touch of heat and used red bell pepper for sweetness. I also seared boneless breast filets then diced them and finished cooking in a pan bringing 1 cup water 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup soy sauce then adding the chicken and stirring constantly until thoroughly cooked then drained and added to the salad. This keeps the chicken extremely moist. The salad was awesome and disappeared in a flash.

I gave this recipe 5 stars in all categories except kid friendly. I don't have kids but can't imagine they would care for it too much. My husband and I loved it though. I substituted black olives instead of green and cut way back on the corn. Otherwise the recipe was great and works out well for lunches to take to work for a few days. Thanks for the recipe Heather!

What a great summer salad for the whole family. My 23 year old son who is hard to please loved this salad. I added a little more onions to fit our family tastes. This is what is great about this salad. You can adjust it to your own personal tastes.

Pretty good. Left out the olives because husband doesn't like them I also used two baked chicken breasts that I had baked instead of the canned stuff (yuck). Makes a nice lunch of a light supper with a nice dinner roll.

I never write reviews on this site and I had to write about this one! Even my husband and daughter couldn't get enough of this! My husband asked when I was making it again. It's really good and the ingredients work so well together. I used some left over rotisserie chicken that I had instead of the canned kind but other than that followed this recipe exactly. Turned out really YUMMY! Thank you.

Awesome! I left out the olives and the chicken to make a simple plain salad for a BBQ. I left chicken on the side and olives for those who wished to add it. I've never made such a wonderful pasta salad the italian dressing and mayo mix is genius makes flavorful tangy dressing stearing aways from that bland mayo tasting pasta salad I'm used to having. Will make over and over again this one is a keeper.

This isn't anything special but fairly good stuff and fairly easy to make (even though I hate chopping stuff). What I liked was that it was a great thing to take to work that was reasonably filling & didn't have to be microwaved. And the pasta seemed like the right amount for a change. (Although I wouldn't call mixing Italian and mayo "genious" since I've seen plenty of recipes that do this - it's just an easy way to tang up the mayo a bit.)

I make some changes when using this recipe and then it turns out great. I slightly steam some carrot and add then for some added veggies. This would also be good and healthier with wheat pasta.

Yummy yummy yummy! I doubled the recipe and in one half used chicken breast that I pan fried (or sauteed in seasoned salt and garlic powder) and in the other I used the canned chicken breast. Both came out wonderfully. As for the rest I pretty much followed it to the letter. For sliced green olives I bought a jar that had pimento in it. I didn't use chicken broth to boil the pasta (just noticed it in the instructions as I'm typing this). I took this to an event and people were giving me compliments! My 7 year-old son also liked it despite his certainty that he wouldn't like it before he tried it. He rarely asks for seconds but he did ask for more of this. The only thing I could take a star off for would be because I can't stop eating it!

I doubled this recipe and served it for a meeting and also the family at home. Everyone enjoyed it and the kids liked the all the color created by the cheese olives green peppers and corn. I didn't use the chicken broth - but I would recommend it for the boost of added flavor. Laura C.

Very nice salad! I did use grilled chicken rather than canned. Used what pasta I had on hand which ended up being a combo of elbow mac and bow tie! Left out the corn and olives added cucumber. Just goes to show you can really do what you want with it. Loved the mayo in the dressing!

I was short on money time and ingrediants and this fit the bill. I made some minor changes. Used green onions instead of white. Used yellow and red peppers instead of green. Finally I didn't have rotini just elbow so that is what I used. The dressing was great and it made a lot even with 1/2lb of pasta. You could easily sub a can or two of tuna for the chicken. I didn't add any extra salt but added about a teaspoon of pepper. Thanks Heather for sharing I will be making this again.

Really good....reminded me of a cold chicken alfredo. The only thing I did differently is I used both shredded swiss cheese and cheddar cheese. I also used "real" chicken instead of canned.

This is my first time posting a review even though I use the site regularly. My whole family loved this salad. I forgot to add the olives but it wasn't missed. I didn't even remember I had forgotten them until I came to add a review. This was very quick and easy to make I made it after a late night at the ball field. Everything was ready to be mixed together before my noodles were done. I also used spagetti noodles because that is what I had already I also didn't add the chicken broth. Will try that next time. My daughter also loved this. She did pick out the bell pepper and some of the celery but she came back and asked for seconds!

This one was a total hit w/ 3 (THREE) teens!! I adjusted it more for our tastes left out green pepper didn't have cheddar cheese but added minor-ly cooked frozen peas pine nuts and a little olive "juice" to the dressing when mixing. This recipe has enough flexibility for me to use some leftovers to it to save money and food!!

This was fantastic and MY KIDS loved it! The dressing was so easy but a perfect blend of ingredients. We didn't put in mushrooms or corn and changed the green olives to black...but it was a HUGE hit and we will be making it for summer bbq's!

Good salad that is so versatile. I'm giving it 5 stars but it's certainly a recipe that commands changes that suit personal taste. Next time I will use Zero Calorie Russian Dressing instead of Italian and used Lite Mayo to reduce the calories. Also I subbed in a fresh seeded jalapeño pepper for the green pepper and increased the onion. I had Vadalia on hand but next time will definitely use red. Finally replaced the green olives with black olives. Thanks for a great base recipe!!!

Need to grocery shop tomorrow as there's nothing in the house to eat yet I still needed to pack a dinner for DH who works the night shift. This was quick easy and perfect for a warm summer evening. I added more seasonings than called for; my usual onion and garlic powders parsley and dill weed. Red onion added to the nice array of colors. Very nice Heather and thank you!

This was good- I didn't have th chicken so just made it with pasta onion cheddar cheese and the dressing and mayo. I used half an onion and it was still a bit overpowering but would make again w less.

I made this without the mushrooms only because I didn't have any on hand. Next time I will make sure that I have regular shredded cheddar cheese. This time I used fancy shredded cheddar and I don't think it gave the right texture to the salad and the salad didn't give the cheese enough credit. Delicious! I have five children and only one complained. He hates unmelted cheese.

Wonderful - as another reviewer said - it was genius to combine the Italian dressing and the mayo. I poached two chicken breasts and shredded that into large bite size pieces. I ended up having to mix up some more Italian dressing and mayo since I was using more chicken than called for - but that was easy enough. This should sit for a few hours or overnite. It was good when I first made it - but it was outrageous the next day!! I brought it for lunch and I can't wait to go home and dig into it some more.

I made this for my family omitting the mushrooms and using black olives instead of green. Everyone enjoyed it. It is very versatile. It is my go to recipe for pasta salad now. I liked the combination of mayo and Italian dressing. It is more mellow than a straight Italian dressing and has more zip than straight mayo.

Oh so good! Use leftover chicken and leave out the corn because habibi doesn't care for it. Overall it's a super quick and easy not to mention delicious pasta salad. You can change up any of the ingredients you want according to availability and or preference except the dressing. Don't touch it: it's perfect.

I liked the Mayo-Itlaian dressing combo as well. I made the following changes and we were pleased with the results: swapped black olives for the green swapped diced red pepper for the green used purple onion and swapped mozzarella for the cheddar and cooked fresh chicken in place of canned--it made a yummy and very beautiful colorful salad!

I haven't attempted a pasta salad myself since my wife who was a fabulous cook passed away 4 years. She made great summer pasta salads but only used her experience and intuition to determine ingredients. I need recipes and thought this one sounded really good. I used black olives instead of green and used Oscar Mayer ready to eat seasoned breast chunks for the chicken. Canned chicken flakes didn't sound good to me. Since the Rainbow Rotini box was 12 oz. I used it all and increased the Italian dressing to one cup. I'm sure I will get about 6 meals out of this. It tasted fantastic.

I can't stop eating this!! What an awesome lunch salad. I don't like olives so I substituted dill pickle. I used 8 oz corn and 2 oz of peas. For the italian dressing all I had in the house was a packet of good seasons italian and as I was making it I thought this would be good with balsamic vinegar so I did that and it is very good BUT it isn't pretty on the salad. I added more than a cup of chicken. I found it didn't need any salt and pepper. I will definitely make this again and pretty or not I bet I stick with the balsamic.

I followed the recipe pretty closely and think it's delicious. My only feedback would be there is a bit more dressing than I like but next time I will add more veggies or pasta to compensate. I never thought to add fresh mushrooms or corn to a pasta salad before but both were great additions! Since I like mushrooms next time I will add more than the recipe suggests. Like some other reviewers I substituted red pepper for green pepper since we like the taste better. I like green olives but not all of my family members do so I used a little less than called for. It was enough to give me the flavor and they can pick them out if they want to.

This recipe tastes great! I don t think you have to be fussy about what veggies you put in it. I used black olives instead of green as that is what I had available and I added 2 stalks of celery instead of one and also part of a cucumber. Also I used Mexican style blend cheese another available substitute. I m thinking I ll add some Salad Supreme for a bit more zip.

This is amazing. I added a little red wine vinegar to the dressing the first time I made it because I didn't have enough Italian on hand. I have made the dish several times since and I actually prefer to add the red wine vinegar. I also prefer to add a couple of cups of cherry or grape tomatoes cut in half usually yellow and red to mix the colors up. I must say everyone I mean everyone who tries this raves about it and wants the recipe. We can't get enough in our house. So easy fast and delicious.

I liked how easy it was to make. It had good flavor however I felt like it was missing something. I'll make it again but will play around with the ingredients a bit.

Just made it last night and it was a hit. There was nothing left over as everyone went for seconds.i omitted the ingredients I didn't like. I would make this again in a heartbeat. Second time around I would double the recipe again add a red bell pepper for color. Best to cook the pasta a minute before the ready time on the box so it doesn't turn into a soggy salad

I just made this dish and I must admit it's really the first time I made a pasta from scratch it's not really much to it it's just a chicken pasta salad but for my family of 7 I had to double it and make a giant container of it everybody loves it with some crackers

Made this tonight with the leftover hickory rubbed chicken and roasted corn we had for dinner last night. DELICIOUS! I do not eat mushrooms so I left them out. Ohterwise I stuck to the recipe. If you have a vegetarian in your family/friends just leave out a portion before mixing in the chicken. Great combo of ingredients.

Terrific! Used left over chicken thighs. Also made Italian dressing with the powder mix and used the low oil option on the package. Family loved it!

Actually I give it a 3 1/2...which is probably because of my own tweaks. Over-all this is light chilled fresh and easy. I used Red instead of green peppers black instead of green olives "Zesty" Italian (I don't suggest; it's too powerful for the other subtle flavors) and I topped with fresh diced tomato. Would make again.

This is a very easy dish to toss together. Based off of another review I added paprika to the sauce. The dish is quite delicious. I will definitely make it again. This would be a good dish for a potluck get together.

Very forgiving salad with lots of room for your own preferences. The first time I used canned chicken and made as stated but it tasted like tuna so the 2nd time I used rotisserie chicken and it was great. Thanks for the recipe.

Tasty and FAST twist on a pasta salad: I simplified it and added color. Just made pasta al dente put a lot of paprika on shredded chicken breast (from a. Can) added onion a heaping tablespoon of mayo and some Italian dressing. The paprika provided color I desired. Easy and quick this way - ideal for busy morning lunch packing and beach trips!

It was an amazing recipe! I did change it up a bit however. I didn't add onions as my 4 year old does not like onions. I also substituted green olives for black olives. Tastes way better with black than green. I used a whole can of ripe black olives. Our family loves black olives _ also instead of using an Italian dressing we used an Italian vinaigrette. Best pasta salad to date!

The dressing is what really makes this salad. Everyone loved it! I took it to a chicken bbq so I did not add chicken to the pasta; I added chopped bacon and pepperoni for the meat part. I didn t use green pepper but added chopped banana peppers which are milder than jalapeños which are too hot for some people. But it gave it some zip. I added most of the other recommended ingredients. I didn t get to bring any home as others wanted to take home some for themselves. I ll definitely make this again.

This is a good recipe. I had black olives instead of green and dried onion bits. It still needed something more when all was said and done so I added garlic powder to taste.... really pulled it all together.

This was great. I added some red pepper flakes and a sprinkle of cumin since my son is a huge fan. I subbed chopped cucumber for the green pepper which was wonderful and also used green onion instead of regular. I also added broccoli. The kids raved and raved about how cold noodles are so yummy.

I made this early in the day and came home to it half eaten. Kids loved it! and I even forgot to add the cheese. You can switch up the ingredients depending on your taste and what you have on hand. Shredded carrot tomatoes kidney beans green onion just to name a few. I used left over grilled chicken and Miracle Whip with Zesty Italian dressing.
