Total failure and I followed the recipe  exactly.  30 minutes was WAY too long, couldn't get the cookies off the wax paper, even when I used a cooking spray.

This is a really nice cookie. I let them bake for about 12 min. Letting the edges get toasted was really good according to my 5yr.old niece. I didn't pack the brown sugar, and probably added about 2tbs of extra flour and held back a bit (2tbs) on the butter so they spread out what I thought was normal. Enjoy. I know we will be making this cookie again.

I'm sorry, not so impressed with this recipe.  I thought they were too sweet, but before I tasted all that sweetness I tasted . . . nothing.  Bf didn't like the taste at all.  I toasted the sesame seeds, although I didn't use enough--didn't have quite the amount called for then I spilled a lot of them.  But I'm still skeptical.  25-30 minutes--way too long.  I cut it down to 20, and they still came out hard, although with the airbake pans they were okay.  I'll take it to work for others to try, but I don't think I'll try this again.

These are very delicious!

Don't forget to toast the sesame seeds before adding to the batter, it makes a big difference in taste.

These spread a lot while baking; use only a scant teaspoonful, and only put about 12 cookies on a sheet.

I alternated between parchment paper and a Silpat on my baking sheets.

I found that 25-30 minutes is WAY TOO LONG to bake these. The cookies became far too dark and crisp. I baked them for about 12 minutes.  

Also, you will want to definitely leave the cookies on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before attempting to remove them. 

I will be making these again, they were a big hit!

These weren't bad - I actually wasn't so sure about it so I cut the servings down to 12 to make a mini-batch, which yielded about 28 cookies.  They were tasty - something like a light butter cookie, and texture was a perfect blend of slightly crisp, slightly chewy - mine were not overly sweet.  Baking time was more like 15 to 20 minutes.   Taste good, but a real pain to scrape off the paper-lined sheets, so I might make these again, but not on a regular basis.  N*R

The idea seems delightful. Execution is something that is less than pleasing.
