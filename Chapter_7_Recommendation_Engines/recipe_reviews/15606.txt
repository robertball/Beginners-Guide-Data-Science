This is wonderful on baked tortilla chips, too.  This is high in fiber, so it's filling and takes the "edge" off before dinner.

Very simple to make yet tastes great.  Also versatile in nature.  It can be used as sandwhich spread, vegetable dip or sauce for polenta etc.

Good dip! I did change it a little bit by adding 1/2 avocado (for little creamier consistency and it is a healthy type of fat), 1-2 Tbsp lime juice, 1 Tbsp chili powder and cut the cumin to 1 tsp.

Very, very good. Instead of using cooked black beans, I used canned black beans; drained and rinsed. Since I used two cans, I doubled everything else. I blended it all in a food processor, my blender couldn't handle it.

5-star in our opinion. I preferred it room temperature to refrigerator-cold, but husband loved it both ways. I thinned this with Frank's RedHot sauce (in place of the water) to a point where it could be served with tortilla chips. Thanks for the recipe! (P.S. 1 1/2 cups beans is 1 can, and 1/2 cup cottage cheese is one of the 4 oz single serve containers, which come in packs of 4, so you can save the other 3 for other recipes because the expiration dates on the individuals is pretty far out until you open them, or you can buy exactly 1 of the cottage cheese & fruit combos, use the cheese, and eat the fruit yourself :o)

This is such a great recipe!  I am not into "spice" so I use mild salsa and just a little bit of hot sauce.  This makes a great dip with tortilla chips and it's very creamy.  Everyone loves the taste and likes that it's healthy too!

This dip is awesome! So low calorie/healthy and nobody even knew it. My favorite kind of recipe. I used a can of rinsed black beans, a little extra salsa and no fat cottage cheese. I also left out the coriander seed since I don't have any and I didn't miss it at all. The only thing I added was lime juice and I highly recommend doing this. It really adds a tangy flavor that's crucial to bean dip. Thanks for this amazing recipe, I'll make it often. FYI: I served this with tortilla chips, celery and carrots and everyone really enjoyed the vegetables with this dip!

This was really good! I read the review before mine and liked the idea of using hot pepper sauce to thin it down instead of the water and then serve it with tortilla chips. Hubby preferred his room temp but I liked mine zapped in the micro with a little cheddar cheese. Don't let the appearance (real purplish) fool you for this has a really good flavor.

This is amazing!  Very tasty!  I added some leftover spinach I had from dinner and substituted Fat Free Sour Cream for the cottage cheese.  Very Tasty and I will definitely be making this for the holidays to share!  Too good to keep to myself!

The flavor was ok, I felt like it was missing something.. I couldn't figure out what... but I didn't love the texture either.  I guess I'm just used to having black beans in "bean form".  My brother in law really enjoyed it.

Very good; quick and easy.  My can of black beans measured a tad over the 1 1/2 cups required in the recipe.  I also sprinkled some fresh chopped cilantro on the top for visual appeal.  You could also use parsley for the same effect.  If I made this again, I would probably add some lime or lemon juice.

This is delicious, and adapts well to different types of beans if you are out of black beans.  My blender also had a hard time with this, so I think a food processor would be a better choice, if you have one.  Next time I will try doubling the cottage cheese to give it a lighter texture and lower carbs.

I added one extra cup of picante sauce and some shredded cheese also. It was okay, probably would pass on making it again.

Simple, healthy, and liked by the whole family!  I don't use hot sauce, so I added an extra T. of salsa.  I didn't have green onion, so I just omitted it.  Pureed in the bowl with my immersion blender.  Served with tortilla chips.

This is good. I had it with toasted pita bread. My boyfriend didn't care for it, but he isn't a huge bean lover. I didn't have cumin, I put in a 1/4 tsp of curry powder instead. And I used mild salsa, and dumped some extra cottage cheese in the blender to make it a bit thicker.

Wow, I love this stuff. I did change the recipe because I was out of cottage cheese and used cream cheese. It has a great flavor and I have made several times cause it usually only last about a day or two.

This is delicious and so easy to make. We like to use it as a burrito filling with sauted veggies, or as a dip with tortilla chips. The recipe is perfect as-is.

This was very easy and good! I substituted cream cheese for the cottage cheese because I didn't have any. Then I wrapped some of the spread up in a tortilla and browned both sides in canola oil. I added some cheddar cheese and a little sour cream. It was delicious!

I followed the recipe except I used one can of drained and rinsed black beans.  The garlic flavor was overwhelming.  I would consider making this recipe again, but next time make with only one clove of garlic and taste before deciding whether I needed the second garlic clove.

I omitted the green onions (I didn't have any) and the garlic was really strong.  It was still good though.  I will try again with the green onions and see if it changes the flavor.

This recipe is great as is or as a base for other Mexican-style dips. Great way to use up leftover beans. I used a mix of black beans and pinto beans, added extra salsa, grated cheddar and a chipotle seasoning mix.

We love this spread. We use it as a spread for steak sandwiches on ciabatta bread. Really yummy!

This dip was surprisingly flavorful!  The cottage cheese and salsa added great texture and taste.  Used it as a base for tostadas, and it turned out great.  I'm going to make this again as a dip for snacking.

Loved this dip and healthy too! It came out very smooth and creamy and was perfect with tortilla chips and veggies. Instead of using salsa I used chopped jalapeño and I didn't have coriander seed so I used minced cilantro.

This dip is creamy, delicious and soooo easy to make. I did add 2 T lime juice and 1/2 cup chopped cilantro (plus more for garnish) as suggested by other reviewers, and used sour cream because I didn't have cottage cheese on hand. I added herb sea salt (Herbamare brand)and smoked paprika to deepen the flavor and cut down on the garlic as reviewers said it was too much. I was tempted to add Parmesan cheese  and heat it up, but decided not to. No regrets. I served it at room temperature for a NYE party with multi-grain tortilla chips and it got rave reviews. It makes a tasty and healthy snack so I made it again for the weekend. I do agree it's not great with vegetables, but goes well with any type of pita, bread, cracker or chip. I used my blender to avoid the hassle of taking out my food processor.  Worked fine, you just need to do a bit of stirring if you want it all pureed. I didn't mind having it only mostly creamy with the odd mangled bean showing.

Weird flavor...I'm not sure, but I think the tart flavor of cottage cheese kind of makes the dip a bit odd. I tried it with blue corn tortilla chips and didn't really like it.

I'm shocked at how much I like this dip!!  It's a bit too spicy for me so I reduced the hot sauce and noticed it tastes better chilled.  I agree with the reviewer that it doesn't go well with veggies but it does taste great pita chips or tortilla chips.  My husband even liked it which is a huge plus!

I love garlic but this just had way to much.  After thinking about it, it could be the coriander.  It's ok to me but my daughter won't eat it. Best when at room temp.   I gave it 3 stars because I think maybe if I only used 1 garlic clove and a small one at that or maybe if it was roasted or sautéed it would have made the spread better. But, until I know I can't give it more than 3.  Disappointing since every other recipe I've tried on this site has been amazing.

I thought this was very good, and my husband loved it!   He doesn't like onions, so I left them (as well as the coriander seed I did not have) out, and it was still good.  We tried it with baked tortilla chips.
