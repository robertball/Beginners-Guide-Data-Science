I made the Hawaiian option and LOVED it! Delicious! The flattening and slicing is time consuming. You need a very sharp knife!! Worth the effort! Yum!

I used the Mediterranean version, making two slight changes in the ingredients.  I used jarred roasted red peppers because I had some opened in my fridge, and I used farm fresh tomatoes and added a little garlic and Italian seasoning to them.  Otherwise I followed the directions and ingredients--sherry vinegar was my choice.  The chicken I used was Costco's organic, and those two chicken pieces were perfect for the two of us.  I would definitely make these again!  Thanks, Mazola!

Delicious! I opted to use white wine vinegar and marinated everything for a little over 4 hours. Fresh rosemary gave this a nice herb flavor and the chicken came out moist and tender. I made the Mediterranean version and grilled some tomatoes vs. using canned. I also used fresh mozzarella cheese that I shredded over top and fresh basil instead of parsely. Overall, very tasty!

Excellent! Had this for dinner tonight. I made the marinade with cilantro, I didn't have fresh rosemary. I also used olive oil and white vinegar. I grilled my chicken and saut√©ed peppers and onions with olive oil on the stove. I used hunts diced tomatoes with garlic. And served with Pasta Roni angel hair pasta with herbs. My kids ate an entire breast and they NEVER eat all their chicken. Great meal will have again.

I did the Mediterranean version using a red onion, green pepper and a yellow onion. It's what I had on hand.

We did the Mediterranean version, but added in mushrooms. It was delicious. My 13yo son, who doesn't like bell peppers even loved it. He wants to try more stuff with peppers now. We came up with a lot of other ideas for toppings too. I can't wait to try the others. Yummy!
Having been sick a lot this year my hubby, who is an inexperienced cook, made this the second time. I forgot to tell him to marinate the chicken ahead of time. Instead of marinating, he browned the chicken & then removed it from the pan. He lightly sauteed the mushrooms, onions and peppers and added in the marinade ingredients. Then he returned the chicken to the pan and let it all simmer for about 10 minutes. I think I liked it this way even better. Either way, this recipe is a keeper.

A versatile recipe with options to suite your taste. I made the Mexican option with one slight change. I used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned crushed tomatoes. Other than that this is amazingly good.

This was a really good way to make chicken breasts more interesting!  We made the Italian style chicken, except I did not include capers on the chicken, simply because I don't enjoy them.  After melting the cheese, we put some diced fresh tomatoes and basil on top as a garnish, and served with parmesan and butter noodles.  Easy and delicious!
