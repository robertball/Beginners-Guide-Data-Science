I love this dip and make it frequently.  There are a few things I do differently:  I layer the cream cheese then the bleu cheese (I use one jar of bleu cheese - Marie's or Marzetti's) next the chicken/ hot sauce (mixed together) and just a sprinkling of mozzarella cheese on top.  P.S. I grew up in(and still live in) Buffalo, NY - and we DO NOT eat our chicken wings with ranch dressing - BLEU CHEESE and celery or carrot sticks ONLY!!!!

I have made a variation of this recipe for over a year now and have never been disappointed.  I suggest using more chicken and more hot sauce with this recipe. Also, if you use the chedder cheese, don't use the pre-shredded bags from the grocery store.  The cheese in those bags is coated with flour and it seems to make the dip oiler.

I make a similar version of this often for tailgating and it's always a hit. I'm constantly giving out the recipe. I omit cheddar cheese, use only 1 package of cream cheese (for a meatier dip) and do not heat or bake (mix at room temp and and serve chilled). I also shred the chicken instead of cubing it and serve with celery sticks and chips for a little variety.

Very good! I used a packet of dry Ranch dressing mix, instead of the bottled stuff. Turned out great! I thought using more liquid would make it runny, and the dry power really held this dip together great!

*laughs* I'm not even waiting until everyone shows up to see their reactions to this to review it... Utterly, amazingly, unbelievably good!!!  What a perfect idea for football parties!  JustLearning86 - Great tip for Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce!  I used a full 1.5 lb package of chicken breast, chopped finely.  Just over a cup of Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce, Wishbone's Chunky Blue Cheese dressing, and Neufchatel Cream Cheese - didn't use any other cheese.  I do believe this will be alternated with my Chili Cheese dip (My staple)... Wow!  TRY THIS!!! (Kept it in the crock to keep it warm, and served with Scoops and Celery stix)

Very addictive. Always get asked for the recipe. I use Bleu Cheese (personal preference) and reduced fat cream cheese and fresh cooked chicken (makes a world of difference on the taste. I have used fresh and canned both) Have made it 2 different times. I have one suggestion though, after baking, transfer it to a crock pot to keep warm; I learned this lesson after I made the first time and it cooled off so quick. I had to keep reheating in microwave and it doesnt taste good cold!
Great with celery, fritos scoops, chicken in a biscuit crackers or tortilla chips.

The Best!! Never any leftovers.  As a matter of fact, we've had some major fights over people shoveling it on their chips. I'm from Buffalo so we use one jar of Maries Blue Cheese salad dresing instead of the Ranch. Bake for reccomended time but add the cheese topping the last five minutes just to melt it a little or it gets tough and chewy - never use the packaged shredded stuff.Please only use Frank's Hot Sauce if you can get it.

This was one of THE BEST recipes I've gotten from this site!  I used no fat cream cheese; reduced fat Ranch dressing; and reduced fat cheddar cheese (to fit within my Weight Watchers program).  I also chopped up celery and put that right in the mix with everything else.  Also topped the entire dip with the remaining cheese.  Unbelievably delicious!!!

Yum!  I made this for a tailgate and everyone loved it.  Several people asked me for the recipe.  I made no changes, but I did use a rotisserie chicken and my KitchenAid mixer and that made this dip super easy.  I used all the white meat on the chicken and that was enough for the dip, right at two cups, chopped.  I don't think it would hurt to put a little more cheese in the dip.  Next time, I might use a little less Frank's.  Even though my hubby loves wings, he likes them mild.  I served the dip with Frito's and Tostitos Scoops.  I personally like the Frito's best.  I will make this again and again.

Entirely too twangy.  I would cut back on the ranch.  It was just too much when combined with the cream cheese.

This was perfect for a little Super Bowl party!  I cut the recipe in half and I used chicken tenders that I had poached in chicken broth.  Just the right amount of spice.  I baked it as directed and then poured into my small crockpot, keeping it warm all afternoon.  Just perfect.

My family went NUTS for this dip! I used store bought rotisserie chicken and blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. I live in Buffalo, NY and ranch belongs on a salad--NOT a wing :) I used shredded colby-jack cheese and it didn't get as oily as cheddar and stayed smoother. If you can get ahold of Franks Red Hot Sauce, it's the best.

I hate when people review a recipe when they have completely changed it. That being said, I am going to do just that. My husband woke me up this morning as he was leaving for work to inform me that he would be picking me up at 12:30 for a bbq, and that he said I'd bring a dip. I didn't feel like going to the store, so I adapted the recipe using what I had on hand.  I used:  2 cups shredded canned chicken 8 ounces reduced fat cream cheese 4 ounces regular cream cheese 3/4 cup Franks hot sauce--buffalo style 1/2 cup shredded cheddar 1/3 cup blue cheese dressing 2 ounces crumbly blue cheese  It was fantastic! Being from Buffalo, NY, I prefer blue cheese to ranch dressing. I found that using the crumbly blue cheese added more flavor, but without making the dip too runny.   The point of this review is that this is an easy recipe that is adaptable to use what you have on hand. Have fun experimenting!

Great as is..or adjusted to add more franks hot sauce, crumbled blue cheese and maries blue cheese dressing to equal 1 cup, no ranch! Buffalo Gal here, and ranch is never served with wings in the ruff buff! Also, this may sound gross, but I stir in 1 tbls butter for that authentic buffalo wing sauce taste! no cheddar needed!

Whether as a snack when playing board games, watching football or served to hubby's poker buddies, everyone loves this fun dip!  I make 1-1/2 times the recipe, using 2.5 lbs chicken (seasoned with s&p, baked covered til tender, then finely diced).  I also use extra cheddar (probably 3 cups total).  I make my own ranch (3/4 cup each of milk & mayo + 2 TBS ranch dressing mix for 1-1/2 x the original recipe).  We serve this with tortilla chips and celery sticks w/blue cheese dressing.  If you can find it (our Sam's Club has it), Lighthouse Blue Cheese dip/dressing is fabulous!  If you have problems with oiliness, it could be that the mayo in the ranch dressing is being overheated and the oil is separating.  You really only need to warm this through -- once it's hot, you can turn the broiler on for a few seconds to brown the top a little -- this seems to avoid the oiliness issue for me. I find that holds true with other baked dips (esp. artichoke) as well.   Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe! :)

Nothing wrong with the recipe.  The dip turned out fine and tasted very good.  Found that the hot sauce flavor simply overwhelmed the entire dish and the rest of the ingredients were simply for a softened cream cheese texture.  In my opinion, the chicken could be cut in very small pieces and nearly doubled.  Nobody in my home liked it as much as buffalo wings or some of the other dips we have made in the past.  For the true buffalo flavor lover, this is a tasty recipe and could be a hit.

I've been making a version of this recipe for years and every time I make it, people rave. I've even catered with it. So easy. I always add about a cup of chopped up celery in the mixture...a nice crunch. I've used all fat free or low fat ingredients (including the shredded cheese) and never have trouble with consistency. I can't get over the horrible texture of canned chicken, so I just roast chicken breasts in the oven with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Shred it and use it just like the canned. I start the mixture on the stove and then transfer to a crockpot for all day. Great to take to work, meetings, etc. I serve with celery sticks and tortilla chips. Coworkers grab a spoon and dig in! :-)

I make a similar version to this. I don't eat ranch dressing (or bleu cheese) so I use greek yogurt instead, and I do about a 1/2 cup of hot sauce to each 8oz brick of cream cheese, and I don't usually add the cheddar. And I make it in the crockpot! In the crockpot, you just have to stir it every once in awhile to mix things up, but it smoothes out beautifully and is really addicting!

Every time we have a family gathering, I am asked to make this recipe. I have been told by people it is the best buffalo chicken dip they have ever tasted. I use Ken's Ranch dressing and only put in about 3/4 cup, otherwise it gets too soupy. I also used the pre-cooked chicken in the meat department. Usually two bags is plenty chopped up small. I put it all in a mini crock pot so it stays warm and top it with cheese. Yum!

This was an absolute hit. I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and a garlic cream cheese because that's just what I always have in my house. I used a crock pot the first time to keep it warm at a party. People were all over it. I made a lot, so I had leftovers, brought it home and froze it to serve at a smaller family event. Again, people could not stop eating it. Amazing! Thanks!

Like others, I use blue cheese dressing. Closer to the real deal. Big hit. Shred chicken, it takes a bit more time, but hey, this is an easy recipe anyway.

Made this last night for a party. Everyone loved it. I did not add that much hot sauce to the mixture. I probably added 1/4 cup instead of the 3/4 that it asked for. I also used Perdue  Short cuts cooked chicken. It was a great dip and easy to make. I made everything up the night before and put it in the oven right before serving.

Delicious!  I only made a half batch, and I made it exactly according to the recipe, except I used a 5 oz. can of chicken because I didn't have anythying else(grilled chicken would be even better).  Also, I just served it cold(for the most part), because this recipe is similar to a cold version I tried some time ago, and that is what I was looking for.  It has a great consistency, even straight out of the refrigerator.  I will try it baked for a football party when I get a chance.  By the way, there is another way to serve this, which turns out great.  Just spread some on english muffin halves and bake at 400 for 8-10 minutes - they're awesome!  Thanks, ASCBRADY!

This is my favorite chicken wing dip.  I use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch but that's just a personal preference.  I also add some extra crumbled blue cheese as well.  I also layer mine instead of mixing it all together.  I start with the cream cheese, then the hot sauce followed by the blue cheese dressing, crumbled blue cheese then the chicken topped with the cheddar.  I've also added diced celery which gives it a nice crunch.  It's a very versatile dip that you can change to suit your personal taste.

Very good!  After discussing with friends who've made it, this is how we did it:  mixed 2 blocks cream cheese, 2/3 cup blue cheese dressing & spread in 15x10 pan, top with more blue cheese; mix 1 cup red hot with 1/2 stick melted butter, mix with shredded rotissiery chicken (all but one breast), spread on top evenly.  No extra shredded cheese.  YUMMY!!!!!!!!!

Made this so often I was tired of it...made it for the Super Bowl this year and love it all over again!  I have made it in the oven and the crock pot.  I like it best when I bake it in the oven then transfer to the crock pot to keep warm.

This is absolutely the best version of this recipe that I have ever tried.  I'm always dieting and I simply couldn't stop eating this. :)  It was THAT good.  Previous versions I tried were more oily.  Also, I used Swanson canned chicken and it was so easy and frankly made it taste better.  I halved the recipe and I recommend following the allrecipes exact directions.  Ie: use exactly 1/4 cup + 2tablespoons hot sauce etc.

I made this for Christmas this year and it was a huge hit!! We did not use as much hot sauce because we were worried it would be too hot for some of our guests, but turned out great. I thought it was very easy just might take a little bit of time to shred the chicken. I actually prefer using ranch dressing over blue cheese because the last blue cheese recipe did not work out so good. The blue cheese was just a little too overwhelming.

Made a giant batch of this for Super Bowl yesterday... I added more buffalo wing sauce than stated, also added blue cheese crumbles. Served with torilla chips, although I love dipping Wheat Thins in it! Great recipe :)

I make this dip often, but I do have to agree with donnap. I'm from Buffalo, NY and I never, NEVER have ever eaten ranch on my wings. It is ONLY bleu cheese. If you want this to taste like a real buffalo wing dip, you must use bleu cheese instead.

Great recipe!  I looked at several versions and decided on trying this one with a minor change - using blue cheese dressing instead of ranch (I love blue cheese with my wings!).  I was heavy handed with the Frank's hot sauce and even did a generous drizzle on top after baking (like it spicy!) - I liked the way it looked and it gave us the extra hit of Frank's that I like.  I may even try some blue cheese crumbles in or on top next time...   I used Philadelphia cream cheese, Lighthouse blue cheese dressing (or was it Marie's??) and a good quality sharp cheddar. I went a little light on the cheddar as I didn't want to take away anything from the traditional wing flavors in the dish. I think it can be an optional ingredient (of course, who would ever turn down a little extra melted cheese??!!?? This is certainly not a diet food to begin with!).  I'll also probably do it in a crock pot next time to keep it hot, otherwise it cools off pretty quickly.  All in all, the hubby and I both raved about it (it's ADDICTING!) and I'll be making it for Monday night football for the guys in a couple days...

Always a crowd pleaser! I used 3 boneless chicken breasts, boiled & shredded. The best tasting bleu cheese I've come across is Marzetti's  "Ultimate Bleu Cheese" (their Bistro Bleu Cheese is also really good) dressing which is fantastic. I cut the cream cheese to 1-1/2 blocks & used a full cup of Frank's Red Hot. I am originally from Buffalo, and agree 100% with other Buffalo reviewers - if you are aiming for a true hot wing taste - you MUST use bleu cheese over ranch! I did not mix shredded cheese into the dip itself, but rather just put it all on top. I'm taking it to a NY's Eve party tonight & will serve with Tostitos Scoops -  I have found they are best for holding all that chicken! :)

This was fantastic!  I prepared it the night before, and put it in the oven before we tailgated.  There were no leftovers after the game, and there were only four of us!  I boiled, then shredded the chicken.

I wish I found this recipe sooner-  what a hit!  I used fresh chicken and chopped it in my mini chopper to make the best football dip.  I served it with Tostitos Scoops but next time I will try Fritos, too.  You've got to try this!  1/17/10 UPDATE:  Still making this for every event!  Now also serve with celery sticks!

This is really good; however I use Blue Cheese dressing (this is what we serve with wings in Buffalo) and I omit the cheddar cheese. It is easy to make and everyone likes it.  You can use more or less Hot Sauce.  After heating the dip, it will taste hotter than it will when it is cold, so add accordingly.

I am also from Buffalo, NY. And I agree, Franks Red Hot is the only way to go. I followed the recipe with the ranch and it tasted great. (I use low fat everything as well) I will definitely try the bleu cheese dressing but it's just not something I normally have on hand. I serve mine with tortilla chips.

Back when we were dating, my husband told me "You had me at buffalo chicken dip..." As other reviewers have stated, the cheese can easily be left out and its still great. I sometimes use a combination of ranch and blue cheese and I serve with old school Chicken in a Biskit crackers - everyone loves it! (The crackers are always a topic of conversation at whatever event I serve it at)

Great dip - perfect for parties.  I've made it both with canned chicken and chicken cooked in a crockpot, then shredded.  I prefer the latter, although both are great.

This is a party hit.  People always ask me to bring it with me.  I sometimes add chunks of celery and chunks of blue cheese.  Sometimes, I make it as is.  There is never anything left.

A definite favorite in our house and a favorite at every party we bring it to!

I use boneless chicken breasts and shred while cooking - I like the chicken evenly distributed throughout the dip. I think this makes it nice and fluffy, too! I also use chicken wing sauce instead of a hot sauce. Must serve with chips and celery!

Love this Recipe! I make it for all parties i attend and everyone really enjoys it. Too keep it hot instead of cooking my dip in the oven and then transporting it to where ever i am going, i mix all the ingredients into a small/med crock pot and then when i go some wheres i just plug it in and keep it on low. The dip is always hot and bubbly on the spot! Thanks for the great recipe.

I shredded the chicken instead used blue cheese dressing instead of Ranch.  And then mixed everything together and cooked in the crockpot.  What a hit! Everyone was asking what was in it.  So simple yet so delicious! Thanks for the recipe!!

This was so easy and delicious. We used canned chicken and blue cheese dressing, and it was great. It was a bit salty, but tolerable. Not sure how to change that! Overall, a great recipe!

Such an easy dip, no matter what you change it is hard to screw this one up.  I used a packet of powdered ranch mix instead of bottled dressing and left out the cheddar cheese (you don't need it, and it helps cuts down the fat content slightly). I also added more chicken than called for.  I found it much easier just to throw it all in a small crock pot, that way is stays warm (it tastes better when warm) and you don't have to reheat. You may want to make a double batch if you are feeding a large group, it will go fast.

This dip was amazing.  It was my first time making chicken wing dip, and I made it last night for a New Years Eve party along with some cocktail meatballs and a few other things.  I served it with carrots, celery, Club crackers, Ritz crackers, Tostito's and Frito's, and everyone absolutely raved about it.  I did make a few variations to the recipe.  I used the same amount of cream cheese and pepper sauce, but I shredded a rotisserie chicken and used 16 oz sour cream and an envelope of Hidden Valley Ranch dip mix.  I combined the cream cheese and buffalo sauce as the recipe said, then I added the sour cream and ranch powder, then added the chicken and cheese.  I also sprinkled cheese on top.  It turned out awesome.  I put the very last of it in the refrigerator last night and am now enjoying it chilled as I type this.  =]]  If you're looking for a very tasty addition to any gathering or party, this is it!

Everyone that eats this LOVES it!  I have also lately started adding finely diced celery to it since that is in theme with buffalo wings.  I like the added slight crunch of the celery with it.

The Biggest hit at the party.   Someone asked if there was Crack in it 'cause it's so addictive.  I used hot chicken wing sauce, Monteray Jack cheese, and Bleu cheese dressing - kept the amounts the same.  GREAT recipe!

Mmmm! This was great... was a hit with my boyfriend and his buddies. Only thing I did differently was to shred the chicken. I also sprinkled extra cheese on top before baking it. Will definitely make again and again. ***UPDATE*** Frank's Red Hot makes a Buffalo Hot Wing sauce now. It tastes just amazing in this!

This was not what I expected---looked disgusting.  Didn't taste as bad as it looked, but it was not an acceptable dip to take to a party.   Will not try this again.

I liked this, will make again. The ranch flavor got lost, I think I will try blue cheese next time. I put all ingredients into a crock pot, heated and it was done- very easy and it stayed warm. The flavors are even better the next day- when I make again, I will heat all ingredients in the crock pot, refrigerate, then reheat the next day. I served w/ celery and carrot sticks. My only suggestion for improvement upon the recipe is that I think the shredded cheese might be unnecessary- I even used sharp cheddar but could not taste it. I'll probably just leave it out next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This dip is fantastic! I made it for a pot-luck BBQ we had at work, and by the end of the day I had to print up 5 copies of the recipe for my coworkers. Like a lot of reviewers, I substituted Bleu Cheese dressing for the Ranch, plus I used the "Buffalo Wing" flavor of Frank's Red Hot. One tip - make sure your cream cheese is room temp, and use a hand mixer to combine it and the hot sauce. It was a little diffcult to get everything to blend together by just stirring. Hand mixer solved that right away. My fiance suggested the next time I make this, I double or even triple the amount of chicken, shred it instead of chunks, and use it to make hot wing sandwiches. I can't wait to try that!

Made this for a party we attended last night.  VERY intense flavor!  I cooked and shredded a chicken breast and made my own ranch dressing.  Served with a dollop of sour cream, sliced gr onion and had celery sticks to dip with.  Some of us tried this with tortilla chips but made it VERY salty...we liked the celery better...next time I am going to try using blue cheese dressing and less cheddar, will cut back on the cream cheese and maybe stir in some sour cream.  Was a crowd pleaser!

This recipe is one of my daughter's favorites.  The first few times I made this, I followed the given instructions to a "T".  Then, I began to play around with the recipe a bit.  I have modified the recipe several different ways.  I have used Taco cheese.  Also, I have split the salad dressing; sometimes, using Ranch; sometimes, using Bleu Cheese; and sometimes splitting the cup between Bleu Cheese and Ranch.  Very nice recipe.  Awesome!  Thank you for posting this!

I used canned chicken to make things easy.  Also light cream cheese and low fat ranch and it still turned out great.  I'll be maaking this again soon.

Fantastic party dip! Always gets gobbled up! I always use Marie's ranch dressing. Make sure you mix the ranch or blue cheese dressing with the cream cheese and spread it on the bottom of the 9x13 pan then mix the wing sauce with the shredded chicken (not canned) and layer that on top of cream cheese mixture then sprinkle freshly shredded cheese. It's awesome. I serve it with tortilla chips and celery.

This was a very delicious dip!! I told my mom I had to leave out of the kitchen to stop myself from eating it all up from my family. My husband added a little more hot sauce so NEXT WEEK(lol) when I make more I think I may add 1cup hot sauce. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I have been making this for years BUT i change it up.  I use 2 8oz pks cream cheese cubed, 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, 3-4 cooked and shredded chicken breasts, 1 1/2 cups Franks, and 2 1/2 cups Ranch. Then I put it all in my Crock pot and cook for at least 4 hours on low.  MUST stir once in a while.  I have never had anyone not like it.  You can adjust heat just as long as you still have 4 cups of liquid left.

Love, love, love it!  I tried this recipe using Cholula and Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce. Do yourself a favor, use Frank's, it tastes exactly like a wing on a chip.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and sprinkled the cheddar cheese on top for the last 10 minutes of baking and used blue cheese instead of ranch (personal preference). We used tortilla chips for dipping. Awesome!

We used reduced fat cream cheese, 2% shredded cheddar and low fat blue cheese dressing (instead of ranch). We tried a cheap hot sauce, but Frank's Red Hot is the best so far. Everyone who tried it wanted the recipe!

Loved it!  The only change I made was to use blue cheese dressing instead of the ranch.  I like my chicken wings 'medium' hot and the heat with the 3/4 cup of hot sauce was perfect.

LOVE THIS! This is exactly how we have been making this for years, with the exception of putting the cheese on top instead of mixing it in. Sometimes I'll use 1/2 cup of hot sauce instead of 3/4, just to cut down on the heat a bit. This is a great dip that is ALWAYS a crowd pleaser~YUM! :)

I love this! I make it all the time now. It's always requested by friends/family. I don't even need the recipe anymore. I have it memorized. I don't even like hot sauce, but I use Franks Hot sauce and it's absolutely addicting! I serve it with Pita Chip Crackers that I get from Sams Club. Thanks a million for this recipe!

Delish! I threw 2 large frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot with the Franks buffalo wing sauce, and cooked on high for 3 hours, then shredded the chicken and cooked on low for another few hours. I forgot to buy ranch and tried to make some but it didn't taste right so I didn't add any. I added the cream cheese to the mixture about an hour before serving, and stirred in the cheddar a few minutes before serving. This worked great and traveled well.

This is a great dip!  I do a little different and its always a hit.  I layer the cream cheese in the bottom.  Mix the shredded chicken, bleu cheese dip (maries, marzettis, or rudys if you live in buffalo), hot sauce (franks buffalo wing sauce is the best) and finely diced celery then layer that on top of the cream cheese.  Sprinkle cheddar cheese on top and microwave or bake.

GREAT recipe!  Just make sure that you don't have any leftovers (which shouldn't be a problem)... as it doesn't reheat very well.  Otherwise, YUMMY!

I make this all the time. My husband took it for his Thanksgiving potluck at work and they ate it all before 9 a.m.! No matter what type of function, i'm asked to make this and it seriously is the first thing to disappear. I use shredded chicken and cut the cream cheese to one instead of two. There's no difference and it cuts the fat a bit.

I made this and did make just a couple of changes to suite my families taste. I just boiled some chicken up, and shredded it, and only used 1 8z package of cream cheese. I also used a packet of Ranch dip mixed with sour cream, I used Franks Hot sauce, and just mixed everything up and put it in the crock pot. It is so yummy. I did add some cheese to it right before we all dug in, and I used Colby/Pepper Jack. it was so great! Gave it just the perfect kick!! Very yummy, this is now going to be my go to dip instead of my Mexican Queso. Thanks for the recipe!

I had heard this was really good and was anxious to try it out at my work, but I am glad I did.  Everyone loved it.  I had to print the recipe for almost everyone that ate it.  I am giving it 5 stars because I did use all the ingredients, I just changed it to what I thought we would like.  (the original may be just as good).  I think the changes I made did make it better but how do I really know since I didnt do as stated??  I used 4 cups boiled shredded chicken, 1 cup hot sauce (must use Franks), 3/4 cup ranch dressing and no cheese in, only on top. Definately use a mixer for mixing the cream cheese, sauce and dressing.  Then just stir in the chicken.  It was very easy.  I did bake it as stated. I offered both tortilla and corn chips..most liked the corn chips.  A very good recipe!

This has become the dish we are told to bring to every Superbowl Party, birthday gathering and the like. Changes to the sauces used can make it hotter or more mild depending on the desired heat.

This tasted great and is definitely a keeper. Adjust the heat to your liking with more or less hot sauce, which I do depending on whether it will be served to kids or not.  Mine don't like spicy food.  I personally like more heat.

Very good dip. However, instead of Franks, I highly recommend Texas Pete's buffalo wing sauce.  Tastes so much better!

Wow!  Just hand me a spoon!  This dip is awesome!  I made it for our new years eve party tomorrow and tasted it cold.  I will heat it up with more cheese on top, but it is so yummy!

I used 1 1/2 lbs. of fresh boneless skinless chicken breasts and par boiled them for 30 minutes.  Then I chopped the meat into very small pieces and sprinkled with about 1/2 of the bottle of hot sauce just to flavor the meat and stirred the rest of the sauce into the whole dip. I bought a 5 oz. bottle of Hooters Hot Sauce (not the wing sauce that has butter added) and that seemed to be just enough heat. I think it was close to 3/4 cup.

I softened 16 oz. of cream cheese in the microwave, stirred in 1 cup of Ken's Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing, 1 cup of shredded colby-jack cheese and the chicken.  I plan to bake it in a pyrex dish at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes as others have suggested, and will top it with more shredded cheese and bake until it's melted.  I bought Chicken in a Biscuit crackers and have celery sticks to serve with the dip.  I may pour the rest of the blue cheese dressing in a small bowl if people want to dip their celery sticks in that too. This is definitely a keeper!!

if you like buffalo wings you'll love this..I did add more "Franks red hot" and like other reviews used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, and fresh chicken.

This is a great recipe. Do not allow it to boil though after it has baked as it will curdle the cheese and look terrible.

MmmmmmmmmmmMMmmmmmmm.  Easy to go overboard and eat way too much of this!  Used bleu cheese (Ranch is NOT what goes with buffalo wings for me.) and it was super super SUPER yummy.  Needs to be warmed up for me.  Served it with celery sticks.  SO GOOD!

Very easy, quick, and very good. Brought to a football party this wknd. Everyone LOVED. Per earlier reviews, I substituted blue cheese dressing for the ranch, used 1 cup of hot sauce, and most importantly incresed the amount of chicken to about 3 1/2  generous cups (all of the meat from a 3 # rotisserie chicken which I purchased already cooked. The dip was still creamy and cheesy, but not too rich. Served w/ celery sticks and/or fritos. GREAT.

I made this for some friends Saturday, and it was a big hit.  I used blue cheese instead of ranch and also used more chicken than called for, however I think next time I will stick to the 2 cups as this was a little thick with the extra.  I also made in the crockpot because we'd be snacking all evening.  Great recipe!

This dip was wonderful!! It really tastes like a hot wing! There are 2 things I will do next time is 1) Add another cup or so of cooked chicken and 2) add a full cup of hot sauce instad od the listed amount(just because I LOVE the flavor of Franks hot sauce). But other than these 2 personal modifications it was a crowd pleaser!! And I can't wait to be invited to another gathering so I can make this again! :)

Very good! I used three boneless skinless chicken breasts, boiled for about 25 min. then shredded after cooling. Took to a round up party, with whole grain tostidos - went over very well!

This recipe was easy and, according to my husband, tasted better than good!!!  I am not a buffalo wing lover so I am going by his taste.  I used buttermilk ranch dressing and Franks redhot buffalo wing style sauce.

My husband and I tried this, but used Hot Wing Marinade, and blue cheese dressing instead of ranch as suggested by others. Had fantastic taste, just as a real chicken wing!We ate this with tortilla chips.  I would probably try next time without adding the grated cheese as we both felt left way too much grease on top. But its a keeper and would probably be a great hit at a party.

My family fell in LOVE with this recipe! I didn't have cream cheese so I used 8oz sour cream. I also used Marzetti asiego peppercorn instead of ranch. This really kicked up the spice. GREAT!!

This recipe was fantastic!  I took the recommendations of other users and substituted blue cheese for the ranch, used 4 cups of a cooked chicken, 12 oz. of Franks Red Hot Sauce, used and mozarella in place of the cheddar cheese.  I incorporated most of the mozarella into the mix, and sprinkled the remaining cheese on top. It was the first appetizer to disappear!

Awesome! I made a few changes---used an entire bottle of frank's buffalo wing sauce (I think 12 oz), a whole jar of marzetti's chunky blue cheese (12 oz), and 2+ pounds of boiled shredded chicken.  It still needed a little kick since I used so much chicken, so I added three "forkfuls" of asian hot pepper sauce. I mixed, heated, and served it in a crockpot so there was minimal cleanup too----It was THE talk of the party. I've already been asked the recipe 4 times, and was told to make it next time too. One guy said it was so good he'd put it on anything---and he did put it on his sausage sandwich. Another person said it would be great on pizza crust.  It was a huge hit, and I do recommend blue cheese over ranch and also using the crockpot to keep it hot.

I love this dip, but we've had to cut back on the hot sauce a little. Otherwise it is just entirely too hot. I think we used half a cup instead of 3/4ths and it's SO good. It makes a LOT though.

This is so good..and disappears fast at a potluck or gathering!
I took advice from other reviewers-used 1/2 cup ranch, 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing, used colby/jack cheese, and 1 cup of hot sauce.  Also, I cooked 2 large boneless chicken breasts(1.5-2lbs)stove top with a little oil, salt & pepper.  I shredded the chicken instead of dicing it.  We just like it better shredded.  And, more chicken makes for a meatier dip.
Oh, and I just mixed it all ingredients  together in a large bowl, transfered to a crock pot, and heated til  cheese was melted and dip was hot.
I have made it several times, and everyone asks for the recipe!  
I'm really glad I found this one! Thanks!!

Taste's just like buffalo chicken wings! I get asked to bring this to every Sunday football gathering. I left the cheddar cheese out since buffalo wings in the restaurant don't come with it. Big hit! This one's a keeper!

I made this recipe, but changed it up a bit.  I didn't use the cheese at all.  For time, I used two large cans of chicken breast, (I shredded it with a fork), used 2 8 oz. packages of cream cheese, 1 8 oz. bottle blue cheese dressing (didn't care for the ranch) and half cup hot sauce.  Mix all but the chicken w/an electric mixer, stir in chicken.  Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes and serve with crackers.  Was really good.

I made this dip for a Halloween Party and EVERYONE loved it and asked for the recipe.  At first, I thought 3/4 cup of hot sauce was too much, but by baking this in the oven, it kills some of the heat.  I used Tyson cubed chicken found in the refrigerated aisle and it worked great!

This is such an awesome dip.  I made it exactly by the recipe and took it to a superbowl party.  Someone else had made the same dip, but mine was gone within 2 hours and the other was still only half eaten.  Some woman came up and asked me for the recipe because she said her husband had been raving about it all evening.  I served this with tostito scoops...  yum yum!

Always gets rave reviews. I double the cheddar cheese and leave out the ranch dressing. I think it goes best with Tostitos Gold chips - a little more flavor.

This was really good.  I reccomend using shredded chicken over chunks because it gives the dip a more scoopable consistency.  I had no issues with grease but that might have been due to shredding my chicken as well.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe

This was a hit!! I did change it up a tad bit.. After reading reviews, I addded half a pack of dry ranch dressing, I boiled the chicken and I used 4 oz of sour cream in place of some cream cheese. Liked by everyone. The chicken was easy by boiling it. I also used Louisiana hot sauce not Franks. Will def. be making again!!

All the reviews had me sold on this recipe for our holiday party.  However I made it and hardly anyone touched it.  Most of the people just didn't care for it.  It just didn't have quite the flavor I was looking for.  I'll have to try a different recipe next time.

This dip was incredible.  I made it for work for a "fat friday" party and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  The other night, I made pizza dough and used the dip as a topping.  It rocked!!!  (I made it extra spicy since I figured the crust would kinda cool things off)!!  thanks for sharing!

I LOVE this dip! Using reader tips, I decided to warm it in the crockpot versus baking. Also, I halved the recipe, except for the chicken (where I pretty much used a cup and a half to 2 cups). I baked 2 skinless boneless chicken breasts ahead of time and cut/shredded them, keeping them in an airtight container in the fridge until needed. I melted the cream cheese in the crock pot and added the Franks Hot Sauce to mix well before adding the other ingredients. My husband and I are sold on this so it looks like a definite keeper. Thanks so much!

This recipe is awesome.  I have been making it for parties for the past year and always get people asking for the recipe.  I substitute blue cheese dressing for the ranch as others have suggested and I also cut the hot sauce to 1/2 cup as it makes it a little too salty with 3/4 cup.  It my teenage son's favorite dip!

I served it at a party.  The whole crockpot amount finished.  I received lots of compliments on the dish, and 1 person asked for the recipe.  I put everything into the crock pot to cook,  I used a rotessire chicken bought from walmart already cooked and chopped it into small pieces.  I added a lot more chicken.  I would use less creamcheese next time and try putting in some sourcream to substitute.  I used a lot more hot sauce than called for.  It is a unique idea, and other people seemed to like it.  I personally thought it was okay.  I would not make it again for my family.  However, if there is a party.. I might just make it again.

This was amazing!  I made it when some people came over to watch football and everyone raved about it.  I kept it warm in a mini crock pot which worked really well.  Also served it with frito scoops which was perfect, had celery sticks too but they weren't as good as the scoops.

I have made this dip several times and it is always a hit.  I use bluecheese instead of ranch (have to be authentic), a little more chicken, and monterey jack cheese.  This is always the first to go!

This is an absolute wonderful wing dip!!  I made this exactly as the recipe stated, with the exception of shredding the chicken in a chopper instead of cubing it.  Next time I'll dice the chicken.  It's nice to get those chunks of chicken; more like eating wings.  The way mine was shredded, you couldn't even tell it was in there.  I will definitely use blue cheese with this as a change up/alternate.  Thanks for this dip!!

This is sooo addicting!  I used blue cheese dressing instead of the ranch, and used 4 breasts of chicken.  I mixed in a half cup of the cheese during the melting step, baked for 25 min, sprinkled the rest of top, and baked 5 more minutes.  Perfect with tostitos scoops to get all the chicken.

Definitely a great recipe. I mixed in everything except the cheddar before the 30 minute bake time.  I topped it with the cheddar, and threw it back in for another 5-7 minutes. It was much less greasy this way.

This is my favorite dip!!  I make it every time, I have friends over.  Everyone loves it.  I only have made 3 changes.  I add a little extra hot sauce, cook up my own chicken breasts& also make it in my crock pot.  Putting it in the crock pot is a must, I would say.  This is so worth the calories!!!

I made this for the first time just the other day to take into work. (I used a crockpot instead of baking it in the oven) Within a half hour of setting it out, I had nurses actually paging me to get the recipe, and of course there were no leftovers to take home at all. Thanks for a wonderful, easy appetizer!

UNBELIEVABLE! That's what my guests said- this was a HUGE hit! I also used a rotiserrie chicken (no skin) and put hunks of white and dark meat in the dip. I added colby jack cheese as well. When chips ran out people ate in on celery stalks and carrot sticks. Thank you so much- what a GREAT recipe!

I doubled the chicken breast and reduced the cream cheese to one 8 ounce pkg. All remaining ingredients remained the same. The final consistency is exactly what I was looking for.  I could scoop through or spread on the chips and crackers.

Ive been making this dip for years only thing different is I use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. Chicken wings go with blue cheese not ranch. Ranch has no place is this dip sorry.

Spicy hot.  Goes great with celery and/or Tortilla Chips.
The cream cheese didn't melt too well, but that might have been because I chose to use a fat-free one.

Great dip!   Blue cheese is a must.  I substituted Franks Hot Wing Sauce for Franks Hot Sauce.  That gave it a more traditional Buffalo Wing taste.  Will be serving again on St Patrick's Day at our house party.

As others already stated, I substituted Blue Cheese dressing for the Ranch. I also cooked chicken on the George Forman Grill and then used a fork to shred it before I added it to the rest of ingredients. Put all ingredients in crock pot so it kept it warm to eat throughout the party.  Had tostitos and celery sticks for dipping.

This is a very good dip but can come across as somewhat heavy.  Using freshly boiled, unsalted chicken breasts instead of canned or even rotisserie will help.  Adjust the pepper sauce to your liking; it can easily become "too much".  Definitely serve with celery sticks along with your chips/crackers to keep things light!  I sub'd blue cheese for the ranch dressing also and used light cream cheese.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

Definitely shred the chicken and use Bleu cheese instead of ranch. I also used one package of fat free cream cheese and one package regular to cut down on the fat without sacrificing flavor. So many compliments!

Halved the recipe, otherwise made exactly as stated-- had some leftover rotisserie chicken and used Franks Red Hot Wings- Hot Buffalo sauce.  I baked in a 9" round cake pan and set it on the table at the beginning of the Packers game.  With 9 minutes left in the first quarter, my husband and I had polished off the entire thing (allegedly 8 servings).  Awesome.

This is a great recipe, however I would suggest that you start with maybe a third of a cup of pepper sauce and add sauce from there until it gets to the hotness you like.  3/4 cup was a lot to begin with

This is delicious and so easy!  What a hit at my party.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I used 2 cans of chicken, drained and browned with some margarine, onion powder and black pepper.  I will be making this a lot.

This recipe is great.  I use about 1 1/2 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts simmered slowly with onion flakes and garlic powder until cooked thoroughly and tenderThese are then chopped medium fine.  I use 2/3 cup each of ranch and blue cheese dressings.  The rest is just like the recipe.  This just makes about 30% more.

I love this dip.  I have been making it for a few years now and it is definitely 100% better with blue cheese dressing rather than ranch! I use Marzettis or Maries for its flavor and blue cheese chunks..but any brand will do.  I also shred the chicken and add more than called for.  Serve with Tostitos Scoops and you have a great appetizer..or in my daughter's case...meal!  If you are making for a party..double recipe!  It wont last long!

This had a great flavor, just like hot wings. VERY spicy though. Maybe next time I'll cut down on the hot sauce. I also think shredding the chicken might work better for a dip. My guests kept complaining how the chicken would roll off their chip. haha.

VERY GOOD!!! I did Not change the recipe one bit!! ONE thing ALWAYS USE FRANKS HOT SAUCE its the best!  .. as for the review about the ranch dressing and buffalo ny.. I live in NY and I have never heard of using Mozz Cheese! in Chicken wing dip! I have to agree with using the ranch dressing ( I dont like ranch or bleu cheese but I always used ranch)

This was a smash hit served cold (without baking) at Saturday's tailgate. I followed the original recipe but coated the chicken in buffalo wing rub prior to cooking and shredding. My fellow tailgaters all preferred celery to chips for dipping.

Beware this dip is addictive and will get you rave reviews! I have made this subbing powdered ranch packet instead of pre-made ranch. Blue cheese is also good. It's great both ways!

Though I did not try this myself, it went over big at a party we had!  I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8.  I was concerned about the amount of pepper sauce, so I cut it down to 1/4 up, which heat-lovers still reported to be spicy enough.  Canned chicken also works to make this very easy.  Thanks!

I have been making this chicken wing dip for years. The only thing I do differently is to shred the chicken rather than dice. Goes great with tortilla chips or Fritos scoops!

This is ALWAYS a hit, whether it be a BBQ, a girls' night, or a football party.  EVERYONE loves chicken wing dip.    Also--I use lowfat cream cheese, lowfat blue cheese dressing, and 2% cheddar cheese to make a lower fat version of this . It is still fantastic.

My favorite dip.  I used fat free ranch, light cream cheese and low fat cheese and it helps reduce the fat/caloric content.  Still great.

Great starter recipe...used already made Fajita Chicken from Sam's and put in food processor (3 cups)...used 8 oz of cream cheese and 8 oz of Brie (only b/c that's what I had on hand).  In addition to the Ranch I added 1/2 cup of BlueCheese Dressing.  I melted the mix in microwave to soften the cheese, then used mixer, then added shredded cheese and chicken, mixed again and dumped in casserole dish to bake...YUMMY!

This was a perfect hit at the UFC fight night. I made it exactly as described. I used hidden valley ranch dressing, Philadelphia cream cheese and I grated Kraft medium cheddar cheese.  The Dip wasn't oily because, I didn't use pre-shredded cheese. The hot sauce I used was Franks and it was the "buffalo" sauce. I also used scoop chips. I just got a rotisserie lemon pepper chicken from the deli and shredded the whole chicken for the recipe. This is a dish that was easy to make and a total hit at the party. I don't think it lasted 3 minutes. LOL

I think this is fantastic cold, without the shredded cheese added to it. I usually add a ton more hot sauce, because I'm a flavor addict. Also, I have found using blue cheese dressing instead of ranch dressing brings this up another notch. It's a crowd pleaser no matter what, though, so do with it what you like!

This stuff is fantastic! I boiled 4 boneless chicken breasts in chicken broth, and then shredded them.  Threw one package of softened cream cheese, one cup 3 Cheese Ranch, and a little over a half cup of Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce in my crockpot and mixed it together.  Added the shredded chicken, and let it all warm up in the crock.  Served with Tostitos Scoops at Game Night at a friend's house.  It was the only thing everyone kept going back for! Lots of compliments! Thank you for such an awesome, easy, and TASTY recipe! :o)

This is really good and does taste like traditional wings.  This is definitely less messy :)  It is simple to prepare.  I followed the directions but will decrease the Ranch to 1/2 cup next time.

This was really good.  My family stayed hovered over it til it was gone.  I added sliced green onions on top after baking for garnish.  I think some celery sticks on the side would be a great addition as well.  You will not be disapointed with this recipe.  I will be making this a permanent home in my potluck recipe box.

I divided this recipe in half. I used a lot more Cheddar than suggested, because I had 75% of a brick I needed to use up. Instead of Ranch dressing, I used blue cheese dressing. I like it better. I melted all my ingredients in a pot on the stove before transferring it to the crock pot to keep warm. I didn't have any trouble with oil pooling--probably because my cheddar never got hot enough to separate (like it surely will in the oven. Blech.) This was delicious & right up our alley, and I'll make this again for sure. Thanks much!

Made it for a family function and it was a "HIT".  Everyone was saying their eating a hot wing but they have clean hands.  This will be a keeper.  Great taste and easy to make.

I made this exactly as written for a birthday party and it was very good but IMO alittle too thick.  The very next day I made it for sunday football and instead of using 2 packages of cream cheese I used 1 package and 8 ounces of sour cream; perfect texture!  I've also since have been using 1/2 cup ranch dressing along with 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing.  I find that kids don't care much for all blue cheese but without the blue cheese it feels like something is missing.

I have made this dip over and over again!  Every time I make it someone asks for the recipe.  I do make a few changes to it though.  I use 1/2 cup of hot sauce because I think 3/4 is a little too spicy for the crowd I typically make it for.  I also add two cups (or an entire bag) of cheese instead of just one cup.  Also, instead of the tortillas, I cut a loaf or two of french bread and toast it in the oven to use as crackers.  Delish!

AMAZING! My new favorite dip ever! I made this for Superbowl and everyone loved it. I used a small bottle of Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce (maybe 1 1/4 c.) and Marie's Super Blue Cheese dressing instead of ranch. I followed suggestions and omitted the cheddar cheese from the mixture, but sprinkled it on top instead after it baked 10 minutes. Also, another thing I changed that most people wouldn't is I substituted the chicken with diced up Trader Joe's "Chicken-less Chicken Strips" because I'm a vegetarian.  only added 1 cup instead of 2. I was the only veg-head at the party and everyone still loved it (yes even carnivorous football boys!). Serve with Fritos and YUM!!

This recipe has a really good rating so I was very surprised when no one at my party liked this dip.  It was too tangy (maybe less ranch would be better?) and the orange color was scaring people off.

I loved this dip.  It was super simple to make, and it was a huge hit.  This will be one I make often for parties and get togethers!  Next time I make this I am going to substitue the ranch dressing with Bleu Cheese dressing.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  If you like Hot Wings, but don't like the mess, you need to try this recipe!

Awesome! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and made it with Blue Cheese instead of Ranch, but either would have been fine with me. This recipe was phenomonal. I made it for a party and it was a huge hit. I will be making this again and again.

An easy appetizer that goes over very well every time I make it.  I use a little less sauce and dressing (blue cheese dressing usually)--just personal taste.

This was very good, but I did make the following changes: I used only 1 package cream cheese mixed with 1 cup bleu cheese dressing layered on the bottom. Then I diced the chicken very small and mixed with the hot sauce and put on top. (If you have Anchor Bar hot sauce available at a store near you, try it! It tastes great and it is supposedly the original hot wing sauce.) I put my dip in a 9X9 pan because I like a thick dip and it was perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!

I wanted to try this after all the rave reviews that I read. I wasn't impressed! It didn't really taste like a hot wing, to me. And for all the fattening ingredients that it has, I would rather take the time and make wings. Plus, I bake my wings, which makes it a bit healthier then this recipe. And it surpasses it in taste. Sorry!

Yummy! Everyone who tasted this at a recent work party stated "It tastes just like chicken wings!" 

I took the advice of several other reviewers and switched out the ranch for blue cheese dressing and the cheddar for low-fat, part-skim mozzarella. I poached three chicken breasts in chicken broth, then added all of the ingredients to my food processor and pulsed until it was well blended. I increased the hot sauce to 1 cup, but will probably add more the next time. It wasn't hot enough for my personal taste, however was too hot for one of my peers. 

I didn't bake it in the oven as I made this the night before the party. Instead, I just heated it up in the microwave for about 5 minutes, stirring every minute to keep the cheese from burning. I will definitely take the advice of others and get a small crock-pot to keep this warm. I served it with Fritos and Celery sticks and it rocked!!! Thanks for such a great recipe!

I LOVED this dip! I ate it for 3 days for lunch. Sad, I know but it was so addictive. I made it for a "mom's night" and all the mothers loved it too. I am making it for my husbands poker night next week and hopefully I won't eat it all before he takes it. The only thing I changed was I added less cheese. I didn't think it needed it. Great EASY recipe.

This was a very good addition to my poker party.  I used leftover chicken thighs and just shredded them.  I used blue cheese  instead of ranch dressing and I added a whole diced Jalapeno, seeds and all.  Put in in the crock pot and garnished with green onions.  Served with home made corn chips and celery.  AWESOME...everyone loved it!!  I will make this time and time again:>

Loved this dip!!Cut recipe in half and made in a 9" pie pan.  Used 1/2 ranch and 1/2 blue cheese dressing, used colby/jack instead of chedder.  Good consistency, did not separate at all. served with tortillos chips and celery.  Almost better than regular chicken wings!!

O.M.G.!!!!!  This rules!  I made some changes.  I baked 3 very large chicken beasts w/ olive oil and hot sauce.  The next day, I shredded it, placed it in a skillet covered w/ a whole bottle of Frank's hot sauce, and let it simmer for about 10 min.  I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, and instead of hot sauce in the dip, I used 1 C. of hot wing sauce.  I used 3/4 C. of shredded Colby-Jack cheese, and after baking I transferred to a crock pot. I served w/ Fritos and celery sticks.  This was the hit of the party.

This was GREAT! Everyone commented on it being their favorite dish at the party.  Served it with Ritz Chips Crackers... Delish!
Also... I cooked the chicken in broth then shredded... worked like a charm!

I love this stuff!!  It always goes fast, and is so addicting.  I have made it as is, but I prefer it with blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, and I usually leave out the shredded cheese, as I don't really think it's necessary.  Either way, it is always a crowd pleaser!

Very Good Dip! I use low fat (not fat free) ranch and cream cheese. I also use equal parts ranch and hot sauce. Any kind of shredded cheese will work. This recipe is good hot or cold!

I also make a similiar version of this recipe except I layer it in a 9x13 and I use 1(8oz) pkg of cream cream spread on the bottom. Next I use Frank's Hot sauce and one large can of chicken(such as Swansons or Kirklands..don't use cheap store brand it tastes different)I layer that on top of the cream cheese. Next I drizzle ranch dressing over the chicken(Hidden Valley works well)and last I top it will Mozzerella cheese(about 2cups shredded). I bake it at 350 for about 15-20mins until cheese is melted. This is asked for at all social gatherings ENJOY!!

This is a great recipe. My brother-in-law begs me to make it all the time. I use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. It's so easy & delicious. You can use blue cheese or ranch dressing. both are good!

I have made this recipe for years and find it very easy and good !! i just throw it all in the crockpot. Cheddar cheese gives it more of a buffalo wing color than using monterey (as others suggested). I also have found it does not taste as well if u make it with canned chicken or serve it cold !!

My boyfriend loved this dip--and he doesn't even like blue cheese! Of couse he didn't know this while he was eating it.  I told him after he licked the plate clean. Everyone else loved it as well.  An outstanding recipe!

Excellent!  Made this for a New Year's party and everyone loved it.  It was a last minute decision to make it, but it's quick and easy.  I used bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch, it was awesome!  If you like chicken wings, but don't like the mess...this is for you! Also, sprinkle cheese on top, it makes it more attractive!

Can't thank you enough for sharing this recipe.  We absolutely love it as does everyone who has ever tasted it.  We have one friend who requests it every time we get together...I think he and my husband could finish the entire dish themselves.  I usually have to take two dishes to parties because it disappears so quickly.  I like to use refrigerated light ranch dressing and rotisserie chicken.

I made this recently and it was even better than the recipe I had been using.  It turned out so creamy.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing and 1/2 cup ranch dressing.

I only gave this 4 stars because I didn't really care for it (not a big wing person) but everyone at my work absolutely loved it.  They all asked me for the recipe.  I used a jar of chunky blue cheese dressing and only used 1/2 cup of hot sauce.

Great stuff. I use one bar of cream cheese mixed with one jar of MARIE's Blue cheese dressing OR ranch. I layer mine with a mix of the chicken marinated in Franks red hot buffalo sauce then the dressing/cream cheese mixure in a casserole dish, top with shredded chedda and bake 350 for 20-30 minutes. WONDERFUL!!! Frito's scoops and celery go great with it.

Everyone went nuts over this!  I scaled down the recipe - 1 pkg reduced fat cr cheese, 1/2 cup Red Hot, 1/2 cup Lite Ranch, 2 cups shredded chicken. Baked in an 8-inch square dish.  Comes out just as spectacular!

This is the best dip for any party... everytime I serve it people ask for the recipe.  I did make a few changes, like people said below it is better to shred the chicken (just easier to eat).  I do 1/2 a cup of Ranch and 1/2 a cup of Blue Cheese as well as a Monteray Jack/Cheddar Blend (seems to cut down on grease).  My favorite recipe ever for a party and still tastes just as good when re-heated!!

I made this for superbowl. People liked it, but it wasnt the favorite.  This was a unique dip, but be sure to stick to the recipe. I used a ranch w/ bacon receipe, and that may have affected it. Also, try to use ingredients lower in salt, be sure to check your pepper sauce's sodium content! The content of a lot of sodium rich items produced an interesting final product.

I thought it was good served w/ yellow corn tortilla chips, but it didn't disappear at my family's super bowl party and many of the clan like spicy things. I used low fat cream cheese and when I cooked the chicken I added the red hot sauce to give the chicken itself more of a kick too.

Made this recipe for my Superbowl party.  Everyone liked it.  Since there was only my family and I, there's plenty for us to heat up and have tomorrow as a snack.  Thanks,

This was a hit at our college Superbowl party. All the "Buffalo Natives" loved the buffalo wing resemblance.

Thanks!

I love this recipe.  Everytime I make it, I end up giving this recipe away because everyone else wants it too.  I only serve it with celery though.  Crackers are too much.  The celery is good because its cool with the hotness (spicy hot) of the dip.

Great recipe!  I have made a similar recipe but needed something new.  I used blue cheese dressing instead of the ranch, added a little more chicken, and it was great!  It may not look pretty, but everyone dug right in and enjoyed this dip!  Thanks for sharing!

Yum-o!  This is one of the best dips I've made.  I made the chicken first, then threw everything in the crockpot 20 minutues before the party; served with thin slices of french bread.  It was gone in the first half hour and I gave out the recipe to several people.  This one's a keeper!

Tried this twice, first time followed some of the reviews and used bluecheese instead of ranch also added a pack of dry ranch dressing mix. Big screw up, it was way to salty had to through it out.
Tried it again for a Christmas Eve family get together and used the blue cheese instead of ranch but everything else to direction. This was a big hit, I got many requests for the recipe.
Thanks

This is by far the best dip I have ever put in my mouth! Taste just like hot wings! Every time I make this stuff, I end up making 2 batches and a 3rd batch, because so many people want to take some home. Don't even ask how many tomes I have made copies of the recipe!
A real keeper:)

I added extra chicken as 2 cups didn't seem like enough.  Only chicken breast for me.  I also cooked in the crock pot until it looked done.  Brought it to a Holiday Party and EVERYONE raved about it.  Thanks!!

This dip tasted soooo good.  I was forced to make it the night before my party and then the next day put it in the crock pot and then served it from there.  I don't really recommend this method.  Although it tasted awesome, I think some people were afraind of the appearance.  Oh well.  I would totally make it again and I noticed all the ladies appreciated the celery stalks as well as the chips.

This dip is so delicious!  It tastes exactly like hot chicken wings.  I served with celery and chips.  They both was excellent with it!  Will make many times more.

This recipe is OK.  I would have probably liked it better if I did not use canned chicken or blue cheese instead of ranch... in otherwords, I should have kept the recipe as it is!

I just made this for a meeting at my house - all women and they went nuts over it.  Hounded me for the recipe.  They seemed to prefer it with nubs of celery instead of tortilla chips.  Also, I used Tyson grilled precooked chicken strips cut into bites.

Delicious... I used BW3 hot sauce rather than 'Franks'. This is a very rich dip so a little does go a long way. My husband enjoyed this and told me to put it in the rotation.

This is a winner!  I have made this many times and it's always a huge hit.  I substitute blue cheese dressing for the ranch (it's a NY thing) and instead of cooking it in the oven, I use a crock-pot to heat it through - that also helps it stays hot during parties.  Another tip - using celery sticks to dip instead of tortilla chips makes this practically carb-free.

This was excellent. I only used 8 ounces of cream cheese and used mainly low fat ingredients where I could.  I did use ranch dressing this time but I can't wait to try it with the bleu cheese. Oh, I also only used 1/2 cup of hot sauce, my husband doesn't like really spicy food. Thanks for submitting a great appetizer.

I made this for a casual cocktail party. It was a huge hit!  Both men and women loved it.  I did use my own cooked chicken breasts and half of the cheese.  Great with Frito's scoops! So much less mess than traditional hot wings.

Best ever! I had a recipe similar to these and miss placed it, so I searched for a new one.  The Ranch dresssing is key, it's a wonderful dish

It's a hit! I love it, and so did all of my party guests. It's quick and easy, which is good because that means it's hard to mess up!! I served it with regular town house brand crackers, but I've heard that celery sticks and the chik'n'biscuit crackers are great too.

This is a delicious appetizer type dish. Because of the reviews with both types of dressings, I made one batch of each. They were both a big hit!Thanks!

My guests enjoyed this dip very much, and filled up on it to the point where they could barely eat anything else. I didn't eat so much of it. I found it to be a little salty and light on chicken. Next time I will add more chicken (shredded this time) and less cheddar cheese.

I made this for a graduation party. Everybody loved it with Doritos instead of plain tortilla chips. I will most likely add more chicken next time.

Stupid good!  Seriously, I was at a Euchre night tournament and was almost embarrassed how much of this dip I ate.  The only changes I would suggest are blue cheese (for the original wing & sauce flavor) and Monterey Jack cheese.

This dip is delicious.  I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and using Franks hot sauce is a must.  If you like hot wings, you wiil like this dip

I don't know what I did for dip before I found this recipe. It's too perfect. I used bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch because you need bleu cheese with buffalo sauce! It tastes awesome cold too. I know this because I ate a ton of it before I even got it into the oven! Thanks for the recipe.

I guess I expected more from this dip! It was good but not worth 5 stars to me. I took the suggestion and added celery. Maybe next time I will use Blue Cheese dressing instead of Ranch.

I've been making a dip almost exactly like this for 2 years now and still get asked for the recipe!  The only difference is that I add 1/2 cup chopped celery, yum!  I also make it in the crock pot when necessary depending on what we are doing.

Made this New Years Eve.  Liked the fact this recipe uses Ranch instead of blue cheese.  The cream cheese was a bit much, though.  I will definitely use this recipe again, but maybe cut down on the cream cheese.

Excellent dip. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. It is a favorite for watching the Bears game.  Being from NY we don't get alot of chances to watch them but I will be making it tomorrow for the playoffs against the Panthers!  GO BEARS!!!

I love it and so does my family. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe completely. The next time I made it I added sweet green peppers and hotter pepper sauce. My family loved it as well.
Another recipe added to my collection. 
Thank you

I made this recipe with the intentions of bringing it to an office “pot luck”. My husband..., who has never been a fan of chicken wing dip devoured it.  Needless  to say,  it never made it to work with me the next day! Simple and delicious.. next time I am definitely doubling the recipe.. 2 cups of chicken only served a family of 4! ...

I made this recipe as written with the exception of adding more chicken (approx 4 cups).  Next time I would add even more. I thought there was way too much cream cheese to chicken .  I would also increase the amount of chicken wing sauce or hot sauce  and reduce the amount of dressing.  Maybe up the amount of regular cheese if reducing the cream cheese. I am bringing it to work, so I am sure it will go despite what I think :)

I wanted it more like chicken with sauce and not as saucy, so I added a can of cubed chicken I had.  I think I would only use 8 oz  of cream cheese next time.  It is spicy and everyone liked it.  I only did 1/2 cup of ranch - I don't eat blue cheese as some others said to use. And less cheese.  Definitely will make again.

I made this as is and it was good, but it's much better using Marie's extra blue cheese salad dressing instead of ranch.

Being from Buffalo, I know that chicken wings and ranch do not go together, so I substituted blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. Also,  feel free to add crushed red pepper (between a tsp or TBSP for super spicy dip).

If you're a true Buffalo fan, you know you use chunky blue cheese, not ranch. Otherwise no changes.

I gave this recipe a 5-star. I followed the directions exactly. It was quick and easy to make. Tasted perfect. Brought it to a family gathering. It went quickly, nothing left. Next time for fun I will try the Bleu Cheese dressing the others have tried, and shredded Mexican cheese blend and compare.

It was pretty good. The only thing I would change is to reduce the amount of ranch dressing to 3/4 cup. I like that I can use different types of hot sauces to change the flavors though. I used a combination of taco bell sauce, Valentina's, and Frank's Hot Sauce.

I love buffalo chicken dip and take every chance I get to make/eat it! The first time I made it, my cooking partner and I stuck to the recipe exactly as it said, seeing as it was for a cooking demo for class. This time around I still used 3/4 cup of hot sauce, but it was a mixture of Frank's, Cholula, and Tabasco because I love spicy food. I also used a whisk after using a spoon when initially mixing the cream cheese and hot sauce because it helps with all the little clumps. One of my favorite dishes ever!

So good! I used only one pack of cream cheese and added a little more ranch (plus a little  old bay seasoning,  garlic salt,  and celery  salt) . Also added a can of (a tri-blend) beans and one of corn. Half topped with cheese and half with panko bread crumbs for the non cheese eater in my house. turned out great! The kids loved it!!

Amazing - the hit of the party!  I made for Christmas Eve and myself and grocery store were out of Frank's Hot Sauce.  Used an off brand and was still good - but I love Frank's.  My pickiest grandchild  couldn't stop eating it.  I cut back on the cheddar cheese as someone else suggested because I put it in a crock pot.  Used a rotisserie chicken.  Will be making again!

I really like this dip - it's super quick and easy, even if you buy pre-cooked chicken if you are in a hurry.  Otherwise you can cook and shred chicken as well - makes it a little easier when dipping.  
I would suggest pre-warming the cream cheese - I just heat in the microwave on low until it flows.  Otherwise if can clump after it comes out of the oven.  Also - stirring it after it comes out of the oven helps with this.  It does get oily on top, but just like hot wings, I don't mind.

The first time I inadvertently added too much of the Buffalo Wing Sauce, but if you like hotter stuff, that is the way to go! I recommend Sweet Baby Ray's for the Buffalo Wing Sauce, btw. And for the Ranch dressing, I used the Buffalo Ranch... jus' sayin'.. for hot food lovers, that's the stuff.

I made this exactly per the recipe. (I might have added a few more splashes of hot sauce!)  It was excellent. My family loved it. Just make sure you chop your chicken into tiny pieces and I added cheddar cheese to the top.  Will definitely make again.

I know people hate when you review how you've changed a recipe, however, when you make it enough times and tweak it I think you need to note that.  I make this in a crockpot with four chicken breasts -- Precook  chicken breasts parboil, drain and shred.  then throw the rest of the ingredients in a crockpot and let it go on low.  Only other details, full cup of Franks and we use Blue Cheese, preferably Maries chunky.  I lived in Buffalo for 40 years, we know wings, and Blue Cheese is the only way we go :)  Enjoy!!

I have been making a recipe similar to this for years. Instead of mixing all the ingredients together, I make the dip more like a layer dip. First layer in the bottom is the cream cheese, then ranch or blue cheese dressing, next is the chicken mixed with the hot sauce, then I top it with shredded cheese, crumbled blue cheese, chopped celery and chopped green onions. Have had many compliments over the years. I usually bring this to parties. I have even made it in a crockpot for potlucks and just plug it in on low when I get there. Always serve with tortilla chips.

As written this is so greasy! And too much cream cheese. To oily and sour. A nice base but this one is not for me at all. Honestly I don't want a dip I have to dab oil off of while cooking. Thanks though.

My family begs me to make this. If they see the little crockpot out, they assume I am making it and start following me around until I do. 
I never bring back any when I bring a dish to share. 

Goes well with tortilla chips, especially the cupped ones.

Awesome! And everybody that ate it thought it was awesome and they all wanted the recipe. This is now a regular in my snack rotation. As with just about any hot dip, I always make mine in the slow cooker.

SOOOOO in love. My boyfriend and I bought all the ingredients, he made it and we love it. The only thing I will change next time is I won't put the chicken in it. I'm not a big meat eater and even though they weren't diced (we cut them smaller) it was still a hassle to pick up with chips. They're incredible with Sun Chips (Garden Salsa) so please try it if you're reading this! Whether it be with/without the chicken! Thanks much! We love it!

In the interest of time, I used canned white meat chicken. I also had a little cheddar left over, so I added a thin layer on top. It was gone in 20 minutes.

I have made this several times.it's always a hit. I like to make mine cold though..better for picnics and such when you don't have a way to keep it warm,and it goes so fast I don't have to worry about it sitting out too long :-)   I use boneless chicken breasts and shred them, I warm up the cream cheese a little so it mixes better, and I omit the cheddar usually.  I don't bake it, just mix and eat!

Dip was fabulous.  I also cut recipe in half and it was great.

The flavor balance of this dip is wonderful!  I shredded one chicken breast, and think when I make it again, I will use two.  It will certainly become a go-to for parties!

I make a variation of this recipe quite frequently and like some of the other reviews, it never stays around long. I use 1 full cup of the Franks Red Hot Buffalo Sauce and depending on my mood or what I have in the fridge, I use 1 cup of either blue cheese or ranch dressing. I also use 2 large cans of the chicken breasts and it tastes just as good and it is already cooked and ready to go. You can bake it in a pan or recently, I started cooking mine in a crock pot so it was easily portable and remained warm until I served it. Put all the ingredients in a crock pot on high and stir until all cheeses are melted and then on low for another hour. There may be a few small chunks of cream cheese but its very good and everyone loves it! I bring it to all my work functions!

This dip was very good. I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, and mixed the cheddar into the dip instead of putting it on top. We enjoyed this.

This recipe is a must have for football season! I use a jar of Marzetti's® Chunky blue cheese dressing in place of the Ranch and everyone seems to like it better. I have had many, many people ask for the recipe. It reheats well too with just a splash of water.

I discovered this in an old recipe book the other day and loved it. It called for mayo instead of ranch (everyone here prefers ranch over mayo.) Was a hit at the baby shower (we only used 1/8 c hot sauce since the mom to be was eating too.) Some ate it on crackers, others on bread. Definitely preferred it hot over cold!

Amazing chicken wing dip! I've made this so many times and its always a hit. I cheat and use Purdue short cuts- the already cooked chicken strips. And I top it all with mozzarella cheese- serve with tortilla chips, ritz crackers and celery- it will be a favorite dip everyone begs for!

I also make this recipe with just a few twists: I only use one block of cream cheese and blue cheese dressing instead of ranch (depends on what you like better with wings). Then, I add granulated garlic and LOTs of hot sauce to taste. As someone else posted, I just throw it all in a mini crockpot and let it cook itself. It's always a hit.

I think this is a great base recipe for a chicken wing dip that you can vary to what you like.  Like some of the other reviewers, I like bleu cheese instead of ranch.  So, I added 2/3 cup of bleu cheese dressing, and 1/4 cup of bleu cheese crumbles in place of the ranch dressing.  I also used 1 cup of Frank's Red Hot instead of 3/4 cup.  I'm entering this dip in a contest at work tomorrow.  I expect it will do well.

I use fresh  chicken breast that I boil and shred...also I use bleu cheese instead of ranch...and I shred a block of Colby jack or cheddar cheese..the already shredded cheese makes the dip horribly oily. This dip is addictive and delicious.

I like this recipe but prefer, by far, to use blue cheese dressing (T. Marzetti's Ultimate Blue Cheese dressing instead of ranch).  It makes ALL the difference.  Also, add another 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese and then top the dip just before it's finished baking in the oven.  You'll have a yummy topping of melted cheese.

the only thing I do differently is put it in the crock pot instead of baking it... fix and forget and easy to transport if I am going to a get-together.... YUMMY!!!

This was great.  I used the blue cheese dressing  as others had mentioned and shredded the chicken.  Next time I won't shred it, just chop the chicken.  Seemed to taste better when you got a chunk of chicken.  The flavour was amazing.  Will try it with Ranch dressing too, I am sure it will be wonderful too.  Fast and easy.

Like some of the other reviews, we used Franks Wing Sauce. This dip is EXCELLENT! It tastes just like hot wings on a chip. Yumm!

This recipe is delicious, and can easily be "heat" adjusted.  If you want to save a step, You can use the same amount of Velveeta cheese,in lieu of the cream cheese, and shredded cheddar. I have done this, and it's still delicious.

Every time I have made this, it has gotten rave reviews.  I use Perdue short cuts grilled chicken and it turns out perfect.  I've passed this recipe on to a few people who have already passed it on to more.  EVERYONE loves it.

I used my own dry ranch dressing made from dry mix and sour cream. My three boys inhaled this in fifteen minutes. Literally. And one large box of Wheat Thins. Great boy snack food. Next time, I might add more cheese. It seems to be missing something......

Very good.  Nice bite, but not too hot.  I used the blue cheese dressing and layered it, served with chips, celery and carrots.  Very well received at our company tailgate party!

This was great!!  Made it for football for the first time, everyone loved it.  I added a bit more Frank's hot sauce,  shredded the chicken instead, and will cut back on the ranch next time.  Otherwise, recipe was perfect.  Will become a regular for our football games!  I also served with celery sticks along with the chips.

This is incredible.  I used 1/2 Franks Red Hot and 1/2 Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing sauce and I used 1/2 Ranch and 1/2 Blue Cheese dressings.  It was delicious!  One of the guys said it was just as good cold for leftovers at lunch.

This was good, but the shredded cheddar made it really greasy.  Will take others suggestions and omit the shredded cheddar next time and will add more chicken as well.

I used low fat ingredients and no one knew the difference! However, next time I make this recipe, I will only use half  the ranch it calls for!  I served it with celery sticks and tortilla chips and  there was no leftovers!  Very good!

LOVE this recipe! The only change I made was, I heated the hot sauce with about 1/2 cup of butter before assembling. That's how one of my girlfriends makes it, and while it's not healthy, it's AMAZING! :)

you can just make it in a crock pot instead of transferring it. also, used as a filler for soft taco shells then  sprinkled with the shredded cheese takes it from dip to entire dinner :)

This dip was good but several people thought it was too salty.  The Franks Redhot sauce I used already has quite a bit of sodium and then served with salty tortilla chips was a bit much.  Most people were eating it with the celery.  I did make this with low fat ranch and low fat cream cheese, the texture was fine.

This was wonderful!!  I made it the night before and then just put in the oven before the party.  Many, many compliments - especially from the guys.  My only critism was the grease.....I will try omitting the cheddar next time.  thanks

Very Good. My family liked it better cold than just out of the oven. Crackers, celery, peppers, and pretzles were a few of the dippers we used. I made it exactly as recipe states.

I made this for a super bowl party, and it was a hit!  I used light bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch, and omitted the shredded cheddar cheese.  It was delicious!

Yum!!!!  Great for football watching and showers.  I always get asked for the recipe.  I like to use a rotisserie chicken and I add about 1/4 cup more cheese than called for.  I serve with celery sticks and chicken in a biskit crackers.

This recipe has always been a crowd pleaser for me. I like to sprinkle the top with cheddar cheese before putting it in the oven, and adding extra chicken and some garlic and onion salt.

I made this to bring to a party and it was a hit, except that I erroneously bought extra-hot pepper sauce instead of regular. Needless to say it was quite hot. Some people could not eat it. Next time I am going to try using mild chicken wing sauce instead of pepper sauce so that more people can enjoy it.

This is a good dip- and it does give the flavor of buffalo chicken wings. Very fatty, which is not everyone's taste. This could probably serve 32 people instead of 16- because it's very rich.

I've made this twice this week because I brought it to a party and it was requested to be at the next party by everyone. This is relatively quick and easy to prepare and is a huge hit! I used a rotisserie chicken it was a perfect amount. You can even kick up the spiciness by adding some cayenne pepper.

Holy Awesomeness! Made this with the rosisserie chicken and it was SO easy and EVERYONE loved it and wanted the recipe. Will be making this MANY more times and it will for sure be my go to dish whenever I need to bring one! (I used lousina hot sauce, and the guys really dug the fact that it seemed like authentic wings, rather than the "buffalo" style thats out there)

This recipe is great.  If Texas Pete wing sauce is available in your area, it rocks.  I shred the chicken instead of dicing it.  And since cheddar tends to be a little on the greasy side, I use a colby/jack blend instead.  Every time I make it, people RAVE and want the recipe.

I first experienced this dip at a friends' house and loved it but never received the recipe.I lucked up and found this recipe by accident and tried it out to see if it was the dip we  had before. We call the dip buffalo chicken wing dip or "crack dip" because once you get a taste you have to go back for more.I hope you new testers enjoy the recipe as much as my family and I do.

Love this recipes, whenever we go to a party my friends ask me to make this dip and actually it is the first thing to go.  The only thing I don't use is the Ranch, I use Marie's blue cheese instead, it's yummy.

I used 3 blocks of cream cheese, and subsituted blue cheese for ranch. For kicks I added in crumbled blue cheese as well. Huge hit at the bills tailgate- if you are bringing it anywhere cold I would suggest glad's ovenwear containers. Disposable, cheap and kept the dip warm for hours!

AWESOME! I used bleu cheese also and it really did taste better than ranch, and I love ranch. The amount of Franks Red Hot was perfect, not too hot, not too mild.

I used blue cheese dressing vs. ranch - my preference with buffalo wings.  Also substituted buffalo wing sauce instead of tradition hot sauce to bring the true wing flavor forward and doubled the amount.  The dip got rave reviews and we dipped celery sticks and spread it on Club crackers.  Delicious!

This dip is amazing!! It tastes just like wings but is way easier to eat! and has that extra crunch with the chips unlike wings! I brought this to a new years party and everyone there asked for the recipe! I did it exactly as it is, but I added some Franks Buffalo Wing sauce as well.and did add more Reg. Franks sauce because we like things hot!! I will be making this again for sure!

This was eaten within 5 minutes at a football party yesterday.  One note I did not add the ranch dressing to make it more figure friendly.  It was just as good if not better. I have had it both ways and again this was great.

This dip is awesome!  To cut down on prep time I used Perdue chicken short cuts.  I choppped them up and just mixed them in.  So easy and so tasty!  I too used Blue Cheese dressing and it was delicious.

This dip is excellent! It always goes when I bring it to a party or have it out at a get-together at my house. It is also tasty with hot pepper rings and I prefer the blue cheese dressing as opposed to ranch.

This was very good.  I used 1/2 cup ranch and 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing based on the other reviews.  It turned out very good.  I think next time I will use 1 cup of blue cheese dressing just to give it more flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

This was good and easy. I followed the quantities exactly as written. I used blue cheese dressing and added about a 1/4 cup of extra blue cheese. Also used Frank's Redhot Buffalo wing sauce. I'll definitely make this again.

I have made this dip so many times since I got it.  I only use one cream cheese and if I make it for my self I like it hotter so you can play with the ranch and hot sauce amounts.  I have even make it with Tofu for my Vegitarian friends.  They have raved about it too.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't like this at all, and I really don't think my guests did either.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for subbing 2 shredded chicken breasts for the canned chicken).  I thought it was dry and not very tasty.  I was disappointed, because it got such good reviews.

This was very easy to make and was the hit of the family party. Made it as written, with a layer of extra cheese sprinkled over the top, just for the heck of it. Served with Frito Scoops and celery with ranch on the side.

This was great!  Serve with tortilla chips.  I used 2 cans of cooked chicken since I was in a hurry & it worked fine.  Also added some cayenne pepper & garlic powder.

This was a great filler for my game day menu. I used a block of cheese and diced it, then sprinkled it on top along with some left over hot cream cheese mix. AWESOME we will enjoy this again and again!!

Awesome with fritos or tortilla chips! Always requested at parties and 1st to go! It is my go to dip for all football parties and works great in the crockpot too. Just combine all ingredients in slow cooker and cook on low until bubbly then turn to warm! I usually double or triple recipe for larger crowds. Trust me you will want to as well especially in slow cooker. Great for tailgating! Go Gamecocks!

This was FABULOUS!!  It was easy, and tasted great.  The best thing is that you can eat it hot or cold.  Beware, though, cold is somehow spicier.  I can't say enough good things about this.  Thanks for a great recipe--with football season coming up, this will get a lot of use from us!

This was really good and really easy to make...I will take an empty dish as a sign that others agree!  I used Crystal Hot Sauce since we like to use it when making real hot wings.  I was afraid it might be hotter so I used 1/2 C and it seemed to be just the right amount of zing!  I do think that the next time I make it I will either mix the cheddar in or leave it out since as the dip cools it makes it hard to manage.

This dip beats hot wings any day! You get the taste of hot wings without the mess all over your fingers. I also made tiny adjustments... shred chicken instead of cubing, more hot sauce, and use celery instead of chips. I have to give this recipe to anyone that tries it. Its also great heated up in the oven the next day!

I made this for a huge football party and it was the first thing to go. I have been asked to make it next season. It's a winner!

Yahoo what a great dip!!!! I served this for my husbands hockey playoff party.  I used 1/2 the hot sauce and used a whole chicken and shredded it.I also used chunky blue cheese in place of the ranch.  It didn't look all the great after cooking so I blotted the top with a paper towel to remove some of the grease and added some shredded mozza cheese and chopped green onions and broiled it in the oven until the cheese bubbled.  This will now be a staple in my party recipe box!!!!

This was very good... a little too cream-cheesy for my tastes, but I would make again with a slight adjustment. Fun recipe!

Super easy, everyone asked me for recipe and now everyone I know brings it to parties.  Subbed blue cheese dressing for the ranch, and I've used breaded chicken too when I can't find regular pre-cooked chix. Still always comes out great.

I grew up in Buffalo, and served this to my Buffalo-dwelling family, and they couldn't get enough of it!  They said it was the best chicken wing dip they had ever had!  (I served it with scoop-style tortilla chips).

I poached a package of about 4 chicken breasts in salt, pepper, and onion before cooling and dicing for the dip.  Also, I substituted blue cheese dressing for the ranch--very important as far as I'm concerned if you want an authentic spicy twist.

I find that ranch dressing gives it an odd twang that doesn't jive with the hot wings flavor. : )

Will definitely make again!

This dip is very tasty and always a hit at all our potlucks.  You can adjust the heat with additional hot sauce.  It is yummy with tortilla chips.

I make a this dip, but I use Hooters Hot Wing Sauce. I adore this recipe, but I did find it had a lot of oil on the top. I use Pre-Shredded cheese so The tip below helps.

After reading a lot of reviews...Don't use canned chicken! Bake about 4-5 chicken breasts and shred with a fork.  MUCH BETTER.  I like to use half bleu cheese dressing and half ranch.  Either is equally good though!  I'd like to try to layered method.  Bet it's great!  Haven't tried to crockpot method, but it definitely tastes better warm, so I'll do that next time.

TOO GOOD!!  We used Wingers Amazing Sauce (Sweet & Spicey) instead of Hotsauce. My Picky eating 6 year old was eating this like crazy, but it still was spicey so he would chug down milk between bites.  We told him not to eat it if it's too spicey for him, but he said, "It's so good, my mouth won't stop taking bites."  Thanks so much for sharing this keeper of a recipe!

Excellent dip.  I used 4 large frozen chicken breasts, cooked and shredded. (Approx. 3 cups) I kept this warm in a small dip sized crockpot and served it with tortilla chips and crackers.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This recipe is awesome!  Be ready to give everyone the recipe when you take it to a party, it is a party favorite.  I have also substituted Blue Cheese dressing for the Ranch, and it is really good.  We serve with Fritos....makes the dipping easier!

Wow!  I made this for the superbowl and it was gone in a matter fo minutes!  I boiled and shredded the chicken and added hot sauce to the chicken and let it sit while I mixed the other ingredients. I used half ranch and half bleu cheese dressing. I mixed everything in the slow cooker and let it heat through. Definitely tastes best when hot or warm. I was asked for the recipe by people who heard about it fro mso meof my party attendees.  Good stuff!

This is a great dip.  We always make this for any kind of get together, but we use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and we always use Moore's Buffalo Sauce and Colby Jack Cheese.

Hubby and I both loved it however we would change some things.  Like other ppl said, I would change to one pkg of cream cheese to make it more meaty.  Second, I would shred chicken, I just think it would blend in better.  I also made it with Blu Cheese dressing instead of Ranch.  It was so good and can't wait to make it again.  Oh, I would also not use prepackaged cheedar and use mont. jack!

Well the taste was great and everyone at the party LOVED it but it was SO GREASY!!!!  I had to continually sop up grease from the top with a paper towel and that has a huge ICK factor in my book.  I won't make it again because of that.

I made 1/4 of this recipe since it was just for me and my husband to snack on during a football game. So tasty! I poached a chicken breast and shredded it and used Monterey Jack cheese instead of cheddar (just because it is all I had.) Will make this again!

I thought this was very good. Everyone at my party loved it. I took a suggestion and boiled the chicken, which I really did not like. It didn't take long to do it, which was nice - but it made the chicken turn grey, which I thought was really strange. It  still tasted great though. Also it was a little greasy after baking it.

Yum Yum.  I used one cup of the franks red hot to enhance the spicy and marinated the chicken in it before I cooked it.  It doesn't look pretty-but people loved it and wanted the recipe!

This was quite twangy, if that's a word.  It's strong.  I wish I had read the reviews first and maybe tried the blue cheese dressing in it instead of the ranch.  Not bad though, thanks so much for the recipe!

Great recipe! You can make a healthy version if you use fat free cream cheese, shredded cheese & ranch dressing. My husband & I made the original & then made a healthy version & it tastes almost the same. It's great with only celery or even cauliflower and not the chicken flavored crackers. Perfect as a party dip.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was original, and I enjoyed something different from the norm.  However, only about a quarter of it was eaten at a football party.  It just couldn't compete w/ the real thing.  I don't think this recipe "replaces chicken wings," - it's just kind of reminicent (sp?) of a wing - and it's definitely not my fave.  As far as dips go, I prefer the traditional spinach or ranch.  Probably won't try this one again, but it wasn't bad.

Last night I had my annual Christmas/Texas Hold Em' party. I made this dip and put it in a minature crock pot that is perfect for warm dips and kept it on low. I was worried from reading the reviews that it might not look appetizing, but it actually looked beautiful. It didn't really bring raves, and I had a good bit left over, but overall I thought it had a pretty good taste. I would make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I think I would give this a 3.75 if I could. Not quite 4. It was okay, but it was gross to look at.  :-( But it was pretty tasty!

THIS IS SO GOOD! This is the best recipes I have gotten off of this website! The only thing I do differently is use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, and it gives it more pop. If I make this dip for people who may not like as much zing to their food I use ranch- and its delicious both ways!

When I first took this out of the oven I was totally frightened by the way this looked... but don't be scared like me.. its DEEELISH!  I scaled this recipe to 30 servings (made it for a cocktail party this weekend) and that always makes me a little nervous as to how the recipe will hold up, but it really turned out great!  I subbed Blue Cheese Dressing for the ranch... used Crystal's hot sauce.. and light cream cheese!  After baking..you're going to have some oil pooled on the top.. just blot it off with paper towels.  Be sure to really mix this well half way through baking too... i think that helps with the texture of the dip.  I also used fresh chicken breast that I cooked in on the stove and then whizzed it up in the food processor..just enough so that the chicken would blend well throughout the dip.  I served it with Fritos Scoops!!  UPDATE***  I made this last night for a football party at my place and I kept it in a small crock pot.  It tasted so much better that way..its very important to keep it hot!!

It was a really good dip.  I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, because that's what we eat with wings.  I also ommited the cheddar cheese, but added blue cheese crumbles.  It makes a lot of dip, so it was really good for our tailgating party.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves buffalo wings.

Our new favorite tailgating recipe!  This is great just as it is, the "twang" comes from the Hot Sauce which is perfect.  If you love Hot Wings this is your dip!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This dip is awesome!!  It's a little thick and not runny, which is a great change!  I followed recipe to the "T" (I chopped the chicken breast up very fine using my Pampered Chef chopper.)  It reheats very well too if you need to make it ahead of time.  It IS VERY addicting and HARD to STOP EATING! ~ LOL ~ Can't wait to make it again and again!  Thanks for this GREAT new idea!  A welcomed change. :)

This dip is fabulous!  Our oven broke the day I made this so I just heated it over low heat on the stove for 20 minutes or so and it was great.  Everyone loved the dip.  I added some extra hot sauce because we like things spicy.  Will definitely make this again.

This dip became a hit at a party.  I love it.  Me and my husband are trying to eat less fat so we use fat free ranch, fat free cream cheese, and low fat cheese.  It is still yummy with half the fat!!!

I recently made this for our housewarming party and received rave reviews from everyone in attendance!   I love chicken wings (but like most don't like the mess they create).  This was a wonderful way to enjoy the same great flavor.  Like others I used blue cheese and added a bit more hot sauce since I like my wings on the spicy side.

I made a half batch of this recipe but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  The flavor as good, it had just the right amount of spice from the pepper sauce and plenty of creaminess to cool it down.  My only complaint was that it seemed more soupy than some other versions of this that I have tried.  I think next time I will put just a little more chicken in to make it chunkier.  Also, I used canned chicken for convenience.  I don't think it affected the flavor but I just had trouble knowing it was in there.  Next time I will definitely use homemade chicken.

EXCELLENT!  I made this for a get together along with Tiny Chicken Turnovers and Spinach Artichoke Dip. Everyone was RAVING over it.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip (excellent BTW) barely got touched because everyone was eating this one.  It was gone within an hour.  We ran out of chips so I improvised by slicing up Asiago Cheese bread and it was divine with that too!  HIGHLY recommended.  I was scared to use that much hot sauce but it was perfect.  I dabbed off some of the excess oil with a paper towl but my guests were eating it anyway.

What a wonderful recipe!  It really does taste like a chicken wing!  I do not like really spicy food, so I was leary about putting so much hot sauce in it, but I followed the directions and it was great.  The only thing I changed was using 2 cans of chicken instead of fresh chicken.

DELICIOUS!!! Made this for a party and everyone wanted the recipe. A couple of our friends make chicken wings every week and they were crazy about this recipe. It's perfect if you love the taste of chicken wings but don't want to go through the trouble and mess of making them.

This is really good, but it can be a little odd, depending on your taste preference. When I first tried it, I thought it was really strange, but I got used to it, and now I really enjoy it. I do prefer a great bleu cheese dressing in place of the ranch though. Also, you can sub with low-fat cream cheese and reduce lots of calories and fat. Notice that there are over 200 calories per serving with 16 servings in the recipe. Wow! Add tortilla chips to that, and you've really gone overboard. You could use light tortilla chips, celery, or pretzel sticks instead of regular tortilla chips.

My fiancee keeps asking me to make this every time we have a get together.  I reduced the hot sauce by 1/8 to 1/4 of a cup for personal preference.
So so so yummy!!!

Loved it and so did the guests who like spicy food!  I used light cream cheese, light mayo and no fat ranch dressing.  Was awesome!  Thank you for the recipe.

This stuff is very good+ but the texture/looks turns some people off even before they try it.  My wife wouldn't touch it until the kids kept raving about it, then I think she ate more than anyone else. I WILL make this again but probally not for a 1st time get together.

I made this dip for a super bowl party and everyone loved it. I am not a huge fan of chicken wings and I thought it was  ok- which is better than what I would say about chicken wings themselves. Looks like I will be making it again because it is a crowd pleaser!

This dip was a huge hit! I'm not a hot wing girl...but made it for a family get togehter since everyone else loves them! I baked the chicken in hot sauce for a little added flavor and omitted the cheese. Rather than baking, I used the crockpot like other reveiwers suggested. Will make again!!

This dip looks disgusting, but tastes WONDERFUL!  It's very easy to make.  I only had some Louisiana Hot Sauce in the pantry and it worked great in it.  I'll not use cheese in it again, as it doesn't need it.

I mixed this dip up the night before our Superbowl party and put it in the oven the next day ... it was good even before I heated it up!  I did NOT have a problem with it being too greasy or turning into a solid when it cooled off, but maybe it's because I used light cream cheese (which is softer) and light ranch dressing.

Most people at our Superbowl party enjoyed this dip - the only ones that didn't like it were the ones that don't like Buffalo wings (it does turn out very spicy!).  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious!  Made it for just my husband (who is from Buffalo) and myself for superbowl day, so cut it in half.  Left out the cheddar as others had said it made it a bit greasy (hubby commented that it wasn't as greasy as the one his friend makes).  I put the chicken in my mini food chopper/processor to chop up evenly.  This was YUMMY!!  And, so easy--made it early in the day so only had to stick it in the oven.  Served with Tostitos scoops!  Will make again!

This was very tasty, but I guess I was looking for this to be a standout dish b/c it sounded so good to make.  I think that I may substitute blue cheese dressing for ranch dressing next time to give it added tanginess.

Not bad.  I tried it with Blue Cheese dressing, next time I will try the Ranch.  As others recommended, I would suggest making it in a crockpot, out of the oven it cools off and gets pretty solid after about 45 minutes.

This dip is awesome! We tailgate for football games all the time and this is perfect for the occasion. I use the precooked chicken breast that is already diced up and just throw all of the ingredients into a small crockpot. It is eaten up everytime!

I served this on Christmas with crackers and tortilla chips as something to munch on through the day. My entire family loved it! I did substitute blue cheese for the ranch dressing. I used less cream cheese and doubled the chicken for a meatier dip. Next time I will use more Hot Sauce. It was just right for the mild ones in my family, but my newphew and I would have liked it much hotter. Will make this again and again its so easy and tasty!

This dip is GREAT! I don't even like hot wings that much!  The first day we ate it with tortilla chips, which was pretty good, but the next day we ate it with wheat thins! Added a lot and helped control the spice for those that don't like hot stuff.  Also, every ingredient I used was either reduced fat or fat free and it was still phenominal!!! I am looking forward to trying the "tortilla rollup" rendition (details in a review). This is a great one for a last minute, throw it together, everyone loves it, recipe!

This is my favorite dip!! I make it for everything.  I follow the recipe exactly and I use canned chicken (more chicken than recipe calls for) and just shred it with my hands.  For a work luncheon I did do it in the crockpot and it was fabulous!  I doubled the recipe for it and just kept stirring it, starting on high for a couple hours, then turned it to low.  Everyone raves about it and I have given the recipe out many times!

The only problem..I should have doubled the recipe because it disappeared way too quick!

I slightly modified this recipe and made it a low-fat version...i substituted with low fat cream cheese, low fat ranch dressing and fatfree shredded cheese.  I did use 1 cup of franks red hot though, and it came out great!  Everyone loved it!!

This was really good, except for the fact that the chedder flavour was overpowering. Next time I'll admit the chedder cheese, because I think the recipe could stand withoutit.

This was so much better than I even thought it would be!  As soon as people heard what it was, they were diving in with tortilla chips, and not a trace was left in the pan.  I used a package of boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cooked them the night before and then shredded them.  The only change I made, was that I used colby instead of cheddar.  It was decadent and delicious!

I picked up this recipe from a friend at our tailgate spot and made it with fat free ranch and low fat cream cheese to send with my boyfriend on a weekend RV football trip with his friends and it was a HUGE hit!  The fat content with the original recipe was too high for us, but you don't sacrifice the taste at all going low-fat or fat-free.  I used rotisserie chicken that I purchased from Costco for the chicken because it was much easier than cooking it, just cut off the breast meat and chopped it up.  Also served with Scoops.  I think transferring it to a crock pot to keep it warm is a GREAT idea.

I tried this for a small party I had, and it was a hit.  I cooked some chicken things and then shreeded them into the sauce , instead of the canned chicken.  I also kept it warm in a crock pot and it held up well. Simple and good.

I brought this to a singles party and it was a huge hit. It was very easy to assemble and used ordinary ingredients. I served it with tortilla chips. Also, I used light ingredients and it still tasted awesome. I will definitely add this to my list of favorites!

We didn't care for this.  I only made half of the recipe and I used canned chicken, maybe that is why?  I thought it needed more "stuff" in it. It was too cream-cheesy or something.  With all of the great reviews this must be good, I will have to try again and maybe use real chicken and add some other stuff?

I made this with homemade bleu cheese dressing and WOW - this was really good. (I had some left over Stilton cheese). I also took another reviewer's suggestion of serving this dip with both celery sticks and Tostitos Scoops in order to give people a healthier choice.  Like many have said before, it's a great alternative to actual wings because it's not messy.  All the flavor, but no greasy fingers and bones to contend with!

This is totally what I wanted! When it is done cooking, it looks hotter than it actually is, so don't be intimidated!  We ate it with Scoops chips and it was GONE in less than 10 minutes.  I have made it with fat-free cream cheese and cheddar-jack cheese (that's all I had) and halved the recipe, and it was good too!  What a easy winner!!!

I make this all the time. I did change it, I have used rotisserie chicken, left out the dressing and didn't bake it. I just soften the cream cheese in the microwave and stir in the rest of the ingredients. Mine is never greasy and I think it tastes better at room temperature.

This dip was excellent... we've made it several times now, and it's always very popular.  We found that tortilla chips were too salty, so we got a small loaf of french bread and cut it into slices small enough for dipping.  Everyone loved it, and we are always looking for an excuse to make it again!

Made it last night for the first time for a get-together, and EVERYONE loved it!!! I think next time I will use a hand blender to combine the hot sauce and cream cheese, so that it looks a little more appetizing.  Nonetheless, delicious if you enjoy chicken wings as much as my friends and I do!

This tasted really good, but mine turned out super greasy. I only used a handful of cheddar cheese, not a cup, which I mixed into the dip. I don't know why it was so greasy, but if you are eating this dip, you are clearly not worried about calories & fat! 
YUM :o)

Very Good,Quick and Easy. I don't especially like wings but thought this was just the right amount of each flavor. I followed some of the others advice and used rotissere chicken which worked out great.

While I thought this tasted okay, I couldn't get past the texture for some reason.

HOLY COW! This was so good! I am looking forward to making this for friends and family. I cut the fat out as much as I could except for the shredded cheese, everything else was ff. It was so yummy.

This dip was great.  Something different and every body loved it.  The only change I made was to heat it in a small slow cooker instead of the oven.

I always love this recipe. I use blue cheese dressing instead of Ranch which gives it a little tangy bite mixed with that hot sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it!!! Wings are always a mess to serve when entertaining. Now we have the taste without the hassle. To save time, I use either one whole rotisseree chicken or 2 large cans white meat chicken in place ofthe chicken. I had no problem with the oil on top. I used Frank's wing sauce, but I doubt that had anything to do with it. This is my new favorite recipe to impress with. Thanks!

My dip tasted good, but the seperation was bad and no amount of dabbing would help. It made it look very unappetizing and some of my guests were put off. I used blue cheese and a rotisserie chicken and served with tortilla chips and celery.

This dip is great. I did change the ranch to blue cheese but think it would be great either way. If you like hot wings, this is certainly better, since there is no mess. I will be making this at all my get-to-togethers.

This was REALLY good!  I took it to a dinner last night and everyone loved it.  I did use light blue cheese dressing  instead of the ranch and I used Texas Pete's buffalo wing sauce, because I couldn't find Franks.  It was very good and a definite keeper.

Super fast and super good!  We had friends drop by last night and this was soooo quick to pull together.  I used Velveeta in place of the cream cheese and cheddar—it was the only cheese I had in the fridge.  I threw everything into a crock pot to heat through.  My hubby, a huge hot wing fan, thought he was in heaven!  Thanks for sharing.

I'll give this 5 stars even though I didn't try it. Everyone that I served it to loved it. Based on some of the other reviews, I used blue cheese dressing and I agree that Frank's is a must.

This dip was awesome! I used blue cheese instead of the ranch and Frank's buffalo wing sauce instead of the regular flavor. I served it at a party and it was gone within 5 minutes!!! It's also great on pizza!

This dish is quick and easy! I made it on the stove top combining all the ingrediants and added an additional cup of cheddar cheese until all was melted and mixed well. It turned out fantastic! Everyone enjoyed it very much!
