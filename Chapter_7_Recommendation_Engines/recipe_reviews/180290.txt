I used this recipe as a jumping off point, I also added chopped spinach (fresh or frozen (thawed and drained) and instead of canned crab I got the crab from the seafood section of my grocery store, it was only a dollar more and I had plenty of crab. I used half swiss and half parmesan cheese.  I also used mayo because of preference and actually added a tablespoon more.  Finally, I finished it with panko bread crumbs and paprika during the last five minutes of cooking.  With my doctoring this dip was a hit at superbowl.

This is a keeper!  Served it for my company and it was gone in a flash!  Didn't have Miracle Whip on hand so used mayo - turned out fine.  Topped with toasted slivered almonds and served with wheat & water crackers.

This was very simple to make, but needed to be kicked up a notch!  I added about 2 tablespoons of hot sauce because the dip was kind of bland if you stuck to the exact recipe.  I also used the lump crab meat instead of the canned. The lump is much better quality. I will make this again, everyone enjoyed it.

I used imitation crab from the seafood dept and ran it through the food processor.  Honestly, the dip seemed a little bland and too thick.  More onion or perhaps a seasoning would have helped.  Next time I would add a little milk to it and try some Old Bay or other seasonings.

Very easy to make and quite tasty.  Like another reviewer, I used mayo instead of Miracle Whip. Other than that, I followed the recipe.

It is worth it to purchase the "lump crab" instead of plain old crab in a can that you find next to the tuna....much better.

This was very tasty and creamy. I think I added too much cheese though because it was super cheesy. I did add some hot sauce to give it a little kick.

This was awesome! I did tweek it a bit though. I used real lump crab meat, red onions, 2/3 c. Parmesan & Romano cheese blend,  Hellmann's mayo and 1/2 c. of shredded Cheddar cheese. I think the real crab meat makes the difference.

Very good! We loved it! As others recommended I added Old Bay and some garlic powder. I used mayo instead of miracle whip. This was delicious! Very filling! UPDATE: Made again, still very good but want to add that this is so heavy and filling it should not be made as an appetizer - or before dinner. Too filling.

This was very good. Made the following changes: I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese, cheddar cheese instead of swiss cheese and real crab meat instead of can. Served on italian bread. It was a hit w/ the family. Next time I will add old bay.

Good recipe. but thought some seasoning was missing from it...  next time I think I will add a bit of horseradish to zip it up.  Also, limp crab would be better..and chopped spinach sounds good!

I found this recipe to be quite good, but I did changea few things based on other people's reviews.  I used lump, imitation crab.  I also used mayo instead of Miracle Whip.  Because some people said it needed a little something extra, I used pepper jack cheese instead of Swiss.  It really gave it a subtle little kick and made it delicious.  I would defiinately make it again, however!

Made this dip yesterday and it was a big hit.  Followed instructions, but added about 1/2 cup of pepper jack cheese to give it a little kick.
Also baked for about 30 minutes to brown it slightly.

I read all the reviews on this recipe and some ideas. I used lump crabmeat instead of canned & sautéed chopped baby portabella mushrooms and fresh baby spinach chopped horse radish & miracle whip with pepper jack cheese... WOW this dip was delicious and did not last long..

This didn't come out looking very appetizing and although people enjoyed it I thought it could've used more crab meat or perhaps lump crab meat.  Don't think I would make it again

I basically used this recipe as a stepping stone in what I actually created. I used a package of Philidelphia cream cheese. 1/4 cup of Miracle Whip. 1/4 cup of sour cream. Instead of the swiss cheese I ised 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and grated up a few of the mini sized babybel cheese :)  than I sliced up parsley instead of the green onion. a tablespoon of lemon juice. A dash of each onion and garlic powder. a dash of old bay seasoning.I Also opted for fresh crab. So i got 3 medium size (fresh caught and still live) dungeoness crab. I shucked and saved the juices used it all in the dip. Blend all together with a hand mixer. put in glass baking dish. place small layer of panko bread crumbs on the top before baking or half way through. I served mine on mini toasted baguettes.
