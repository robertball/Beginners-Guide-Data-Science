I would have rated this 5 stars except for a couple of small quibbles.  The recipe gives no estimated time as to how long to cook the beets.  5 minutes? 20 minutes? 1 hour?  This may be confusing for novice cooks.  Also 2 tablespoons of caraway seeds is way too much.  I used 2 teaspoons and it was perfect.  Otherwise, these were delicious.  I added some dill and a can of mandarin oranges to the salad as recommened by other reviewers.  Also I added more horseradish because 1 teaspoon didn't give it the kick I was looking for.  My husband and I enjoyed this very much.  Thanks.

This recipe is great! I used only 1 tbsp of Caraway seeds instead of 2 and I added a bit of fresh dill, but mostly I followed the recipe. It was very great the 1st night, but was even better 2 days later! It definately reminds me of the flavors of my German grandmother's cooking.

This started out to be just a way to use up some beets, after finding it I buy them all the time. I add fresh orange segments and it is the greatest thing around.

Hey, all you newcomers to beets. Please consider what you are working with. Beets...misunderstood & underused.  first...I take the time to bake them.  (wash them-just get the dirt off) cut off the greens, then remove the vein with scissors. save for later...delicious.  2nd double wrap in foil, bake in a 300 degree oven for 2 hours. cook slower for a longer time. You want them to develop the & draw out the sugar (Heard of sugar beets?) let them cool. remove foil and rub the skin off..put your hands in a plastic bag, use an old washcloth-(you will discard this cloth). I taste them. if they need sweetness I may add brown sugar, raw sugar or honey.  Once you have baked your beets, you will never boil them again..use the skin in your compost, or worms or dig a small hole and put them in your garden.  The beets at Traider Joes are as awful as December tomatoes.  speaking of which, when I need tomatoes for a sandwich in winter,  I use canned, drained and blotted dry. They slice well. No one will notice if you have added crisp lettuce and some bacon...a BLT... Try the slow, long cooking for sweet potatoes... but those skins go to me, I just love them baked and caramelized. The worms fend for themselves. It's an acquired taste. experiment, explore and have fun.

Nice recipe! I brought this to a german group meeting and one of the members said it tasted just like her german grandmother's beets. I added some larger strips of onion for visual variation because when I was all done making it, it looked like just beets and nothing special.  The onion slices let people know that there's more to it, so that they expect more complex flavor.

Interesting idea for beets..it was decent, but I'd make a few changes next time. I read the previous review that said there was too much caraway and thought "Impossible! I love caraway", but it turns out they were right! There's so much caraway that it crunches when you eat the beets. I wonder if it's supposed to be 2 teaspoons? I'll try that next time, and also cut back or eliminate the oil. I also might try adding orange sections and dill, as suggested by other reviewers.

I'm giving this 4 stars because of all the modifications. I did what others suggested and only used 1/2 the carraway. I also added the dill, a fresh mandarin orange and a little more horseradish. I also used beets that I had bought at Trader Joe's. They come pre-cooked and are found near the salad in plastic with a box around it. I used 1 1/2 packages. So much easier than cooking the beets. I had a couple people comment on the dish that they were surprised that they liked it as well. Not everybody is a beet person.

The simplest way to improve the recipe is to reduce the oil. I only put in a tablespoon or two, and it was fine. And think of the reduction in calories!

This was a great recipe!  Next time I will use less caraway seeds, as they were a little overwhelming.  I couldn't get enough of it even as written.  Thanks for sharing!!

We found this recipe to be surprisingly bland as prepared. I did use raw, grated beets instead of cooked, but that affects  only the texture, not the flavor. Maybe I had bigger bunches of beets, because the dressing didn't give it enough flavor. Next time, I'll double the dressing and use more horseradish. I added blue cheese and raisins to the leftovers, and that turned out delicious.

I gave this four stars because of the caraway seeds. I used only two teaspoons instead of the two tablespoons. I might even cut it down to one teaspoon. But otherwise the flavor is great. I love the touch of cloves. Never would have thought of using them.

I made this salad last weekend and adjusted it the way most reviewers advised; cut back on caraway to 1 tsp, put in thin sliced onion instead of minced, doubled the prepared horseradish and cut way back on the vinegar. we served it with Grilled Italian seasoned Sausages and it was fabulous. I let it set in the refrigerator (the leftovers) for a week (5 days) and we just finished it off! It was incredible today!! I had to share with you! I can't recommend it enough! For those that found it bland, try adjusting the ingredients as advised.

Delightful change of pace. I preferred using 1/2 the amount of caraway.

No flavor after sitting the fridge overnite. The only thing I could taste was the carrawy seeds. I'll look further for another recipe. Had to try it though.

I had 3 good-sized golden beets that needed to be used up, so that was the inspiration for making this recipe today.  The single biggest criticism I have is that 2 Tbsp of caraway seeds is way too much, it simply dominated everything.  Unfortunately, I couldn't even taste the cloves or horseradish because the caraway seeds overpower even those strong flavors.  We ate it chilled and enjoyed it, but would have liked it a lot more with maybe 2 tsp of caraway seeds rather than 2 Tbsp.

This "German-Style Beet Salad" is wonderfully delicious! I have to admit though that beets are one of my favorite foods. This was a good, easy, and convenient way to serve them. I had no idea how much "2 bunches of beets" was supposed to be, so I added the caraway seed slowly as suggested by other reviewers to make sure that I did not have too much for the amount of beets that I was using. The next time that I make this salad I will use a sweet onion (or perhaps leave the onion out), and I will definitely be making this again. Thank you CHRISTYJ for sharing your recipe.

Nothing wrong with this recipe.... just not my cup of tea, I guess.  The beets were beautiful..... My whole family ate them without complaining (though I 'seasoned' them a tad with a sprinkling of sugar).  The thing that surprised me was that they seemed to me to be way more like dilled beet pickles than I'd have ever thought.  I simply couldn't taste any of the other specific flavors - not even the horseradish - certainly not the cloves. Also, I didn't care for eating the caraway seeds when they were soaked.  If I'd grown up with these kinds of foods, or I ate them with a meal that they go well with, I think that perhaps I'd love them, but for me, for now...... I'd have to say.... eh.... okay.....

I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil, and used less of it.  This tasted too much like caraway. We found it over-powering. This wasn't really for us but I was glad to try it. Thanks christyj

Very nice recipe. Based on readers' reviews, I made modifications: I diced and roasted the beets. I mixed them with most of the ingredients listed below BUT instead of white sugar, I used a bit of brown sugar and a tablespoon of a blackberry jam. I did not use any oil and I used 1 teaspoon of  caraway seeds.  My husband and I liked it very much and will definitely make again.
