Great base for a classic Greek dish.  I used chicken breasts instead of legs.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and then seared.  I removed chicken and sauteed my onions and garlic with a little white wine deglaze.  Instead of water, I used chicken broth and also added one can diced tomatoes and one can of tomato paste.  After I returned my chicken to my dutch oven, I finished off the dish in the oven at 325 for about 2 hours (adding 1 cup uncooked orzo during the last 30 minutes).  Plate and top with crumbled feta and some fresh diced basil.  YUM!!!!

I am giving this recipe 4 stars for potential and ease of preparation, and perhaps 3 stars for taste as written. I halved the recipe and used 4 chicken thighs. Having tasted the mixture before serving and finding it pretty bland, I added about 1 tsp dried oregano, about 1/2 tsp dried mint, about 1/2 tsp chili flakes, a good shake of spicy herbamare which is a spicy salt mixture-probably not really needed. I let the dish simmer for a few extra minutes at this point. I also minced 3 more cloves of garlic and added just before serving. I had used one standard (about 375mls) can of plain tomato sauce, about half a can of water, then added about 3/4 cup of long grain rice as I did not have orzo on hand.  Also next time I make this I will certainly take the skin off of the chicken either after browning, or before starting the recipe.  So, I did change the recipe quite a bit and of course this is only due to personal taste but I do appreciate having the chance to try it out. We will be making it again as it is a relatively fast meal.  Thank you for posting this dimitra.

Following some other reviews, I used a little white wine, chicken broth instead of water and I added 1/2 tsp or so of oregano (guessing... I used my hand not an actual tsp)... rave reviews from all sides. Thanks!

This is great!!  I read the reviews and took their advice because I too only use skinless boneless chicken breasts-I brown the chicken first and  saute the onions and garlic in 2 tbs. white wine.  I also use chicken broth (if I have it) in place of the water.   My family loves this recipe!!!

it was a little bland and I didn't have ground cloves so I added Oriental Five Spices and some honey. It turned out really nice.

I agree with Judith a little bland, However My children really liked it.  5 stars for Cost , & time 4 stars for flavor I will certainly make this again. The sauce was great I made it with white rice. My husband hates Orzo.

I really liked this.  The things I did different were to use diced can tomatoes and no cloves.  Also I did deglaze the pan with some white wine before adding in the tomatoes and chicken stock instead of water.   I added some red pepper flakes.  The leftovers were even better!

This recipe works very well with chicken leg quarters as well as drum sticks.

Added a few red pepper flakes and went skinless with the chicken and it turned out pretty well. Not much in the way of leftovers..

Simple ingredients, wonderful flavors!  I used boneless thighs and breasts. My wife was ok with it, but I loved it and will make again. 

Side note, boneless chicken didn't need the 40 minute cooking.

Made many times as is but add a cinnamon stick to the sauce as it braises. Delicious and authentic!! Oh and I use bucatini (thicker spaghetti noodles) vs orzo, and grated mizithra cheese on top!
