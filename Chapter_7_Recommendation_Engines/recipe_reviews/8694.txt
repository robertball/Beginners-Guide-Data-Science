This a good chicken BURRITO recipe. The problem with almost every recipe on this site for chicken enchiladas is that they call for flour tortillas!!  Enchiladas are made with CORN tortillas, not flour.  The corn tortillas also hold up better and have much better flavor.  For chicken enchiladas, in place of flour tortillas, use white corn tortillas, and dip them in to hot oil just for a couple of seconds to make the tortillas flexible and easy to roll.  Try it this way.  It is so much better, though not low in calories, and it is also more authentic.  If you want a lower cal alternative, use olive oil flavored or regular no stick cooking spray.  Spray a skillet with the non stick cooking spray very generously then put in the tortilla for a few seconds on each side. Repeat the process including adding more nonstick cooking spray every time you add another tortilla. Same effect.

I made quite a few changes to the recipe with excellent results. First, I used a store- bought rotisserie chicken. I doubled the sauce and used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of poblano chile soup. I also added a squeeze of lime juice, fresh cilantro, fresh garlic, pinch of oregano and chili powder and some salsa at the end. Those additions really gave it a nice flavor. I also used corn tortillas. I served the dish with homemade avocado salsa, beans & rice.

I would say that this recipe, as published, is an excellent basic one and quite adaptable. It stands on its own and is really yummy though. My husband, however, didn't really care for the flour tortillas and the ultra creaminess. It just didn't "feel" like enchiladas to him. I loved it. I am now cooking for a large group of people (10...sometimes more) including my grandfather who is on a strict renal diet.

After reading some of the reviews here, I decided to give this recipe another try...with modifications. I DOUBLED the recipe as written, EXCEPT for: using 1 can chopped jalapenos (4 oz.), 1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper in place of the green chilies; 4 cups of shredded chicken rather than 3; 2 dozen 6" corn tortillas rather than a dozen 12" flour ones; and a full cup of milk rather than 1/2 cup. I also ADDED to the sauce: 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of chili powder, 1/2 tsp of cumin, and a can of cream of chicken soup (to help extend the sauce and add a little more chicken flavor). For color, I added a few more chopped red and green bell peppers on top of the cheese before baking.

This made 12 servings, and was a major hit. It also fell within the sodium and potassium restrictions of my grandfather's diet. The added spices and the jalapeno added a more adult kick to them, and they "felt" more like enchiladas to everyone. This is a wonderful dish, good enchilada alternative for those who can't or won't eat tomatoes.

This is the best enchilada recipe I've ever tried. I found that the recipe measurements are perfect for twelve 6" sized tortillas. Instead of green onions, which no one in my family really cares for, I used 1 large chopped onion, and also 2 fresh finely chopped jalapeno peppers (in addition to the can of chilis that the recipe calls for) that I sauteed. I used Cream of Chicken soup, not mushroom. I added 1 package of dry taco seasoning to the sauce because the condensed soup and sour cream by itself just didn't feel like Mexican food to me. And to further "up" the Mexican factor, I used 1 can of refried beans -- I smeared the tortilla with approximately 1 tbs of beans (use more with a larger tortilla) before spooning on the chicken filling and wrapping. Instead of cubing, I also shredded the chicken. In addition, I increased the cheese to 2 cups (1 cup of sharp cheddar, 1 cup of Colby cheese). 

Yum! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is for all the people who revise, add, and lterally change a whole reipe to their likings. If you want to submit your own recipe, do it! Dont try to change someone else's recipe. To write a book about how hubby, or 2 yr. olds , teens, or whoever, likes, or dislikes, eats, or doesnt eat, is a bit sensless. Most readers do not care what your family food perferences are, they are interested in hearing about the recipe. I get so tired of reading stories liike some people submit, I dont even want to read them anymore. I want to read how they liked the recipe, and short comments, or tips how to make the recipe easier, or better, not  how to change the whole recipe, and talk about family dislikes. Its a waste of readers time. Or.. do like the website suggests, make your changes to the recipe and save it to your own recipe box.

Revamping this Review...yet again!
Still a Wonderful Recipe!!!!!  
First made this back in 2002 without substituting any ingredients (ok i added a few...but didn't use non or low fat items). I use Extra Soft..Soft Taco Size tortillas..(8" I think).  I get mine at Frys (Fry's/Kroger brand).  They have a little more give to them and don't break as easily.  Made it for a second time a few months after that with non or low fat ingredients. Tasted just as wonderful as with original ingredients.  TRUST ME...NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL!  AND...I know some of you have suggested or stated that enchiladas are made with corn not flour tortillas...This is true.  But, for myself and my family and friends i have made this for...they prefer the flour over the corn.  A lot of people said they didn't like the toughness of the corn and i personally don't like frying anything i don't have to.  The only way to make the corn tortilla pliable is to fry it for a few seconds.  Try tortillas made with organic ingredients.
Ingredients altered or added:
1. 1 can of Ro-Tel tomatoes partially drained
2. 1 can of green enchilada sauce. 
3. A shredded 4 cheese blend we get from Costco consisting of Montery Jack, Medium Cheddar, Queso Quesadilla, Asadero.
4. Low-fat sour cream
5. 1% Milk
6. A baked chicken from my local grocer that i debone and shred
7. Double the Sauce (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. 1 can of cream of mushroom soup (along with cream of chicken)

I have made this recipe several times now and just realized I never rated it.  I'll start by saying every time I feed this to someone new they end up leaving with the recipe.  Really I follow it to a tee with the exception of cooking the chicken in chicken taco seasoning first and then making the recipe.  It gives it a more authentic flavor.  Other than that follow it and you will be very pleased and so will your guests!!!

OHMYGOSH! These were the best enchilada’s I’ve ever made!!! And was told the best others have ever eaten.This is what I did for those who like suggestions and tips:
Taking heed of the advise of other users, I planned on making more sauce from the beginning. So I used a package of boneless/skinless Chicken thighs (dark meat for more flavor) and one large bone-in split chicken breast.  I coated all with Fajita seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Then I browned them along with chopped white onions in a pan in a little bit of olive oil on each side, added some water and chicken bullion to the pan, and cooked them until done. I then cut them up (careful to remove all bones from breast) and used that for the meat filling.  I also added the onions that cooked with the chicken to the mix.  As for the sauce: I dbl'd all ingrediants. I used two cans of soup one was crm chick/crm shroom combined and one was just crm shrooms. I also added 2 cans of mushrooms pieces, and an extra can of chili's. That was about all of the changes I made, except in addition to cheddar cheese, I also added a shredded white cheese on top (Monterey-jack works well, but I used an authentic Mexican variety that can be found in Texas).  The sauce was enough to make about 9-10 enchiladas, each amply stuffed.  EXCELLENT! (I also used fresh made tortilla's that you can find in some grocery stores, but not sure if that had any impact or not.) I cannot wait to make these AGAIN!!!

THE BEST enchilada recipe I’ve ever tried! This was better than the restaurants!! (Okay well, close!!) Everyone I made it for RAVED. The changes I made: I used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store for the chicken filling (a little more expensive, but well worth it), CORN tortillas instead of flour (I think enchiladas are technically supposed to be made with the corn tortillas), and for the sauce, instead of adding the 1/4 cup milk, I substituted a half a can of “Ortega’s” red enchilada sauce. This was key, if you ask me! THIS WAS SOOO GOOD!!!! Thank you, Steph!!

I've made this twice already, adding a few ingredients to the cream mixture to spice it up: 1/4 tsp. cumin; 1/4 tsp. cayanne pepper; 1/4 tsp. salt; 1/2 tsp. black pepper; 1 T. chili powder; 1/2 c. salsa and another 1/2 can of soup (I used cream of chicken). I added 1 1/4 c. of the cream mixture to the cooked chicken and filled 3 tortillas instead of 6. I then added an additional 3/4 c. salsa and only an 1/8 c. milk to the cream mixture before spooning it over the tortillas.  Definitely a keeper!

This was a very easy recipe and a nice change from the Enchiladas I usually fix. I did make some changes to the recipe. I used Cream of Chicken soup instead of mushroom. I added about 1/2 half cup more chicken and 1/2 cup more cheese to the filling. I used 1/2 of the sauce in the filling. To stretch the sauce that was left and to add some zip I added about 3/4 cup of salsa instead of the milk. Really yummy! I served it with homemade guacamole. My family really liked it! Thanks for the great recipe!

I , unlike many others on here will review the recipe as is. I won't try to impress you by I added this or took away that. Kind of pointless to review a recipe when it's not still the same one.

This was very good basic recipe. Not exactly the Chicken Enchilada's I grew up with. Fine alternative. It would be better with corn tortilla's but the flour is quicker.  I made extra sauce as we are sauce people and the leftovers were even better!

NEVER AGAIN!! The last few times I made this for dinner guests (using the corn rather than flour tortilla wraps) the guests not only ATE EVERY MORSEL ... they asked if they could come BACK for ANOTHER dinner, the next time I made this dish. Never again!!
Anyone in need of Dinner Guests - contact me and I'll give you several names... !

As Woodangela says these are technicallly Burritos but a tasty recipe in any case.  To use corn tortillas (which indeed are so much better for enchiladas than flour) you need not dip them in hot oil to make them pliable - I never do - simply wrap two or three at at time in damp paper towels and microwave for appx. 20 seconds - then fill and proceed with the rest of the recipe.

This is a great recipe. Easy and just like enchiladas suiza. I only give it 4 stars, because I would have liked more sauce. That being said... I think it is a shame that people will completely change a recipe then review it. ie: "it was good but I made these changes" It's not the same recipe people and you cannot honestly review a recipe that you haven't even tried. Just saying.

What? I cant give this NO stars? Grrrrr! My word, this was horrible. I couldn't even force myself to eat it. 3/4 of the meal went down the disposal. What a waste of ingredients. It tasted like a can of campbells soup rolled up in a flour tortilla. Bllleeaaachhh!!! The other enchilada recipes on this site are much, much better. I don't know what the fuss is over this one or how it made it into the All Recipe cookbook. I can't even give it some suggestions on how to improve it. I just have a huge "X" through it in my cookbook now. If you like an enchilada with even a small kick to it, do NOT try this one. If you like bland, soupy, cheese and flour pasted together...then by all means, knock yourself out on this one.

Made this for dinner tonight,  used turkey instead of chicken since I had some leftover and omitted onion because family aren't fans of it.  It was a big hit and I have been asked to make it again.  Very easy and quick to throw together.  Thanks for sharing

Steph, this is coming from a true Mexican.  Don't use flour tortillas.  Use fried thick corn tortillas. Also, add a can each cream of chicken and celery.  Also try using muenster and monterrey jack along with cheddar. 120% improvement. Delicious.

This has become a regular in our house.  It is so good, and it is very easy to make it a little lighter by using fat-free sour cream and soup.  We've tried it many different ways, but one of our favorites is to add some frozen spinach that has been cooked and well drained.  I add it right on top of the chicken mixture before I roll them.  Mmmmm!  I think I'll make them tonight:)

This is one of my family's favorite recipes. I think they end up a little dry so i use a full cup of sour cream, 1/2 cup milk and triple the cheese. This is a very basic recipe and i usually add fun things to it. cooked spinach is really good in it, but my family's favorite is a can of rotel. so stinkin good!!!!

A pretty good facsimile of a restaurant enchilada. I admit I was concerned when I saw the cream of mushroom soup plop in the pan. It didn't look very appetizing at all. But it actually tasted pretty good, and I even forgot about the soup. We did add sliced jalapenos and also some canned enchilada sauce (mostly just tomato sauce) over the top because of our soup plop issues.

OMG people...seriously?!  Burrito or enchilada...I could care less.  It's a tasty, easy recipe & my kids wolfed it down, so happy me!  Did use cream of chicken since it was all I had - no complaints.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was really tasty.  The only change I did was shredding the chicken instead of cubing it.

This is a great recipe. For those of us that like corn tortillas instead of flour, steam the corn tortillas. Using a large deep 
pot and a steel colander, add 2 quarts of water bring to a boil and place the colander on top of pot and steam corn tortillas untill pliable. You can add garlic and cilantro to the boiling water to give the tortillas more flavor! This is a good low fat alternative. Hope you find this helpfull.

We have made this recipe numerous times and decided to tweak it a little this time.  

We cooked 2 lbs of chicken in the crockpot.  We cooked the chicken in HT Traders Medium Tomatillo Salsa.  It gave the chicken a wonderful flavor.  We then doubled the rest of the recipe and added some of the left-over tomatillo salsa from the crockpot to the cream of mushroom soup that we reserved to pour over the enchiladas before cooking.  We use a lot more cheese than the recipe calls for.  Wonderful recipe!

I've been making this recipe for a long time now and it's a favorite but... We've been keeping track of carbs lately and there's no way a serving is 72 carbs;it's more like 22. So for those who care, double check your nutrition rating yourself as I've noticed many mistakes.

Wonderful with a few changes: Double the sauce part or it will be a tad bit dry, also instead of cubing the chicken shred it! NO Mushroom soup YUCK, use the Cream of chicken Soup.  Also add 1 teaspoon of Chili powder and 1/4 teaspoon of cumin for that little extra kick. And if you are going to double the sauce part of the recipe you will need to double the chili powder I have suggested and the cumin as well. Will make again and again and again! I got rave reviews from a party I had at my house! Wonderful recipe! Thanks a bunch!

This meal was delicious and it's great when you have all the ingredients on hand. I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce- good decision!! I made it with 1 cream of mush,1 cream of chicken, 1cup sour cream, 2 can green chilis and white onions. I poured 1/3 can green chile enchilada sauce in bottom of 13x9 and added a little to the soup mix (Next time I will put more on the bottom of pan though because the enchiladas did stick in some areas). I cooked 2 big chicken breasts along with cumin/garlic powder/pepper, but next time I will add the taco seasoning to give it a bit more flavor. Rolled chicken up in flour tortillas with cheese and jalepeno sliced olives. Smothered the top with sauce, more cheddar cheese and olives. We loved it!! Excellent the way it was made but I might try to spice it up a bit more next time. Very easy to make and enjoyed by all!

Super easy on a busy night and very good.  The cream sauce and flour tortilla are both pleasant changes from the traditional enchilada.  Definately a keeper!

Ok, you know something that already has 1200 great reviews must be good, but this one is extraordinary!! It's definitely rich, so you can't make it all the time if your watching your weight, but don't skrimp on the ingredients to try making it healthier either--it will take away from the rich flavor. This recipe is certainly worth a few extra calories! I boiled the chicken in chicken broth, cumin and taco seasoning, and then shredded it. It gives it more flavor and a little more authentic feel. Hope you love this recipe like I did!

These were really good with some modifications! I doubled the recipe except for the tortillas. I sprinkled the chicken with southwestern seasoning before sauteeing it, and then shredded the meat. I used one can of cream of mushroom, one can of Campbell's chicken verde, and added a small can of chopped jalapenos to the (doubled) sauce. Before placing the tortillas in the dish, I spread a little of the sauce on the bottom so it wouldn't stick. Last, I used whole wheat tortillas. Delicious and spicy!

I've made this recipe twice now and both times it was a success! Did change some of the ingredients like the other reviewers. To double sauce I used (1) can of cream of mushroom soup & (1) can of cream of chicken. In place of sour cream, I used a half cup of 2% greek yogurt. Added 2 more ounces of green chiles. Also, used rotissire chicken from the grocery store along with Corn tortillas. I found that the white corn handmade tortillas by "la tortilla factory" didn't fall apart when rolling the enchiladas.

Boy, I hate to buck the tide, but I did not like this recipe at all.  I wondered how one stretched 1-1/2 cups chicken into 6 12-inch enchiladas. By adding an additional 1/2 cup chicken, I barely got 8 6-inch enchiladas.  The sauce was very bland, and I just feel the overall this dish was ho-hum.  Sorry.

My family absolutely loves this recipe AS IS!!  Please don't submit a review saying this is a great recipe BUT I basically changed everything and here's what I did.....that is your OWN recipe and insulting to the original poster!  If you used a precooked chicken that's fine, but if you've literally changed EVERYTHING about this recipe don't review it!

This is a easy and great tasting change for a white or green sauce enhilada.  Have been using this re cipe for over 13 years, however it was always made with cream of chicken soup, actually it is a Campbells soup recipe that Pampered chef put out.  To make this not so wet and soupy don't use any milk.  Just mix soup and sour cream and remember to set some aside to use in baking dish before placing enchiladas in pan and having some to put on top.  One can judge the amount of sour cream to soup for your preference in consistency.  I also use a bit of cumin and chili lime seasoning from Cholula seasoning.

Everytime I make this dish my friends and family beg me to make it again. Some of my family are on a gluton free diet. So instead of flour tortillas I used corn. I love the recipie as is, but when I changed it to corn tortillas, I found to love it 10X more! The best thing to do (when working with the corn tortillas) is to place damp papertowels on top, underneath and between the tortillas. I used 3 papertowels total. Then toss them in the microwave for NO MORE than 2 minutes. They're MUCH easier to roll without breaking. If you've tried this recipie and love them with the flour tortillas, you'll fall in love all over again with the corn torillas. Enjoy!

These are very good and turned out super spicy the way I made them!  I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom soup and I used 2 cans of it.  I added 1 tablespoon of cumin and 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper to the soup mixture and I think that made it incredibly spicy!  And I usually can handle anything!  So next time I'll probably use 1/2 a tablespoon of those.  For the chicken I just used 2 chicken breasts and it was perfect.  I only had 8 inch tortillas but in my opinion that was the way to go- they fit perfectly in the 9x13 pan sideways and I used 6 of them.  The filling was the perfect amount too for those.  Other than that the only change I made was adding about a cup of cheese on top instead of a half of a cup.  Next time I might add a can of Rotel tomatoes or salsa or something just to add more depth.  It was very yummy!

My husband loved this one. We shredded the chicken instead of making cubes. We did refried beans as a side. The only thing i didnt like about it was that the bottom of the tortillas were hard to cut i think next time we will put a layer of sauce on the bottom as well as on the top. Other than that it was great

I LOVE this recipe and so does everyone I make it for.  I use fat free sour cream and cream of mushroom and it tastes great.  I also add a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (in addition to the green chiles in the recipe) for a little extra flavor and bite.

These were delicious. I have been searching for a sour cream sauce... using the mushroom soup as a base was perfect. I did alter to taste the following: omitted garlic(my husband is allergic), sub.  drained 10 oz can Rotel tomatoes (split the can- 1/2 went into sauce to cover and 1/2 into chicken filling) for green chiles, covered with mozzarella I had on hand and used 12 6 inch corn tortillas instead of flour. ( I've used flour tortillas in heavily sauced oven baked dishes before and they were gummy and chewy in my experience.) Tomatoes did make sauce a little pink! But still great.

This was my first foray into making chicken enchiladas, so it's a good base recipe.
Second time making it, I used red onion instead of green onions. I also used canned enchilada sauce with the cream of mushroom sauce. This provided a larger quantity of sauce which I found really helped (first time around it wasn't quite enough), and the red onions provided a bit more flavor without scaring off my nitpicky kids.
I serve with white steamed rice and southwestern corn as sides.

I like this recipe and have actually made it, but with corn tortillas.  A healthy way to make corn tortillas more fexible with out oil is to put them in the microwave for 1 minute or more, they are very flexible and roll easy and yes they are hot to the touch, but you don't have to add oil to them and it works.

This recipe is great!  You can sure add your own add'l seasonings, or mix up the creamed soups, etc... I used 98% FF cream of Mushroom, and a can of Golden Mushroom.  (I doubled the sauce ingredients and probably used two cups of chicken and highly recommend you do too).  I bumped up the recipe to 8 servings, instead of 6.  This is a comfort food kind of dish.

This was fantastic! My husband loved it! I shredded the chicken in a food processor rather than cubing it. I also used 9 - 6" corn tortillas and stuffed them full. Next time I will probably double the recipe to fill a 9 x 13 pan.

This is my mans favorite mexican recipe! But i change it and do not do the cream sauce for the top, I dont put any milk or any of that step i only put that sauce inside the enchilada but I also put cheese to go inside. I put red enchilada sauce and cheese on top of them before I bake it and these are PERFECT.

AWESOME!!  Just finished dinner and these were great.  I didn't pre-cook the chicken, so I threw it in a skillet with Olive Oil, green onion and some minced garlic.  Added some Taco Seasoning from this site. Then threw the sauce together in a sauce pan.  Used some flour tortillas from Costco that you cook yourself.  Cooked them right before rolling.  Used the Mexican Cheese mix.  These will be a regular in our rotation for sure.  Thank you for sharing!!

This is THE best chicken enchilada recipe I have ever tasted!  I like this one alot better than the beef/red sauce alternative.  I did double the sauce like other's have suggested, and I also added some cilantro.  This is a keeper!  Thanks!!  *I forgot to add that I used canned chicken.  It works well for a fast easy meal for this on the go mom!*

Delish!!  I made a few changes though. I did not add the green chilies as i wanted my kids to actually eat it. Also, i had less chicken so i used some black beans and kidney beans, garlic, fresh chopped tomatoe, and diced red pepper. I added lots of seasonings, and used the sauce as listed in the recipe. My family enjoyed this so much. I will be making this again.

This recipe is more like chicken casserole in a tortilla than chicken enchilada. I think the title is misleading. It was good, and smelled very good in the oven. It could be a change from regular casserole, but should not be a substitute for enchiladas if you are expecting the mexican flavors.

Yummy, Yummy.  I baked a chicken in my rotisserie, then used the meet from that to go into my enchiladas.  It was nice having the chicken in this "shredded" manner versus the "chopped" manner in which the recipe calls for. I doubled the sauce recipe because had three cups of chicken, not 1 1/2 like the recipe calls for. I also used more cheese.  I just eyed how much cheese.  This recipe gets five stars for great taste!

This is the best Mexican dish I have ever made! I took the advice of others and added extra spices: Jalapeno Juice, Cumin, Paprika, Chili Powder and extra Chiles, it was spicy but not hot. Make sure your tortillas are warm they will fold better that way. Also you can double the recipe and freeze half for the next time you need a quick meal. *****= 5 stars! A MUST TRY!

Excellent!  I'm a coward about trying to cook new things, but this turned out great.  (I didn't have any green chilies on hand, so I used some hot sauce and a little salsa.  It was good.)

If you want bland, casserole-like ickiness make this recipe as soon as possible. Just think about this before making it: cream of mushroom soup and chiles. Enough said.

When I saw this was the featured recipe, I decided it was time to review it.  I discovered this on Allrecipes years ago and it has been a part of my dinner rotation ever since.  It's a great wasy to use up leftover chicken.  It appeals to kids, which is a constant challenge in our house.  I only use 4 tortillas and the sauce is just the right amount.  After making it exactly as written I tried adding a couple of tablespoons of taco seasoning to the sauce and it gives it just enough spice for my husband and me, but not too much for the kids- if you do this, there's no need to add the garlic powder.  It also works with whole wheat, spinach, or sun-dried tomato tortillas and different cheese blends, if you like variety.  Thanks, Debbie, for many quick and yummy dinners, past and future.

I tweeked this recipe a little.  I used sauteed ground beef instead of chicken.  I didn't use any soup or tortillas or milk.  I added chili powder paprika and dried onion flakes  and red pepper.  I left out the butter but added a can of dark red kidney beans and a can of diced tomatoes.  I let it simmer gently for 30 min.  Wonderful!!!

I used Slow Cooker Cilantro Lime Chicken recipe for the chicken. I followed the rest of the recipe except I used corn tortillas instead of flour.  Was very good. Just don't overstuff them.

If you're going to use wheat flour "tortillas" and canned soup, why not go all out and replace the cheese with Velveeta or Cheez Whiz and the chicken with mechanically de-boned luncheon meat?

These are not enchiladas. It's not even a good burrito casserole.

I made these for our Mexican Christmas and they were pretty good. I used a whole chicken that had been cooked in the crockpot the day before and shredded.  I doubled the recipe and used corn tortillas fried in oil for a few seconds. I added black beans and corn to the filling and used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of fiesta nacho soup.  I'm glad I didn't use all cream of mushroom because as it is they were a little bland for my taste.  Thanks

All these reviews stand alone so I want to add one more tip.  The corn tortillas can be made soft and pliable without any oil.  Place 3-4 tortillas  between two damp paper towels and microwave about 2-3 minutes.  They will soften up and roll up without cracking.  This eliminates the oil dilemma.  I live in Texas and corn tortillas are the ONLY way to make really delicious chicken enchiladas.

this is unbelievably inauthentic. like one reviewer said - use corn tortillas. mexicans don't use soup, butter or milk in enchiladas. we also don't cube our chicken, we boil then shred it.

maybe the recipe still tastes good, but they're not enchiladas

This was not my favorite.  Really bland and tasted like cream of mushroom soup.  I know better than to cheat with condensed soup but was short on time so thought I would whip these up.  Sorry but won't be making these again.

Excellent recipe.  I added mushrooms to the green onions and sauted them.  I also added some seasoning to the onions/mushrooms like paprika, pepper, salt and whatever else was handy in my pantry.  IT was delicious!!!

This is a good recipe.  I've made it a few times and the only things I changed were substituting cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom, adding some taco seasoning to the sauce to taste, and topping it with black olives.

Oh, Dear. Here we go again. Bland, bland, bland. I am beginning to not trust the recipes or the reviews on this site. I only try the 5 star recipes and one after another has been disappointing. And, yes, I am an experienced cook. This is a decent base recipe. It needs some real juicing up in the spice department. Next time I would use a much smaller tortilla, chipotles and maybe 2 Tbs. taco seasoning (I used about 2 tsp). Then top it with shredded iceberg lettuce, sour cream and guacamole. The sauce is very thick.  Thin with more milk or better yet low sodium chicken broth.

Even though no tomatoes are in this recipe; you should definitely go ahead and add 1 large tomato (diced) and sprinkle it on top before putting it in the oven. Add a side of sour cream and guacamole, and this will become your favorite!

I've tried several enchilada recipes and this one is by far my favorite!  I try to make this a little healthier by  using whole wheat tortillas.  I see that corn tortillas are traditionally used don't like the toughness.  I also use reduced fat versions of the soup, sour cream, and cheese.  You really can't tell the difference.  I saw a lot of people added an extra can of soup, but I chose to add a can of red enchilada souce instead as 2 cans of condensed soup would be too salty for me.  Yummy!

I have made this recipe more times than I can count. I don't even know how long I have had it, (years?) It is an absolute family favorite. My modifications: I double it, and make it in a 13"X9" pan, use large flour tortillas, (12) I add a can of mild enchilada sauce to the reserved sauce mix, as well as 2 tsp each of cumin, and chili powder. I add a large can of drained black beans to the filling mix, and a can of sliced black olives on top, and serve it with a shovel, Yum!

This is hands down the best enchilada recipe I have ever made.  My boyfriend thought it was better than anything he has ever ordered from a restaurant.  I used leftover Mediterranean Chicken (White and Dark Meat) that had been seasoned in a lime sauce with oregano and white pepper.  I doubled the recipe except for the tortillas; used 2 cloves fresh garlic; SARGENTO Mexican shredded cheese; added 1 jalepeno pepper seeded and diced to the green chilies; 1 teaspoon cumin and 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper to the soup mixture.  THANK YOU SO MUCH! I can't wait to make it for company.

I was brave and made this for the first time on Mothers day for my husbands and my family. It was an absolute SMASH!!! Everyone was raving, and couldn't get enough! I doubled the recipe, but I should have trippled it! Everyone wanted more! I did make a few changes as in previous recipes, I used Cream of Chicken soup instead of Crm of Mushroom. I also used DOUBLE the cheese, (we love cheese). and I topped it as directed, but also used 1/2 can of enchilada sauce from the can before I put on the cheese to back. Thanks so much!!! I've already made this several times!

Really quick and tasty recipe, especially if you have
leftover chicken or turkey to use up.
Try using creamy chicken mushroom soup instead of
the plain mushroom. Yummy.

I found these to be easy to make and very delicious.  It's definitely a recipe you could alter...add whatever you have on hand.  I added fresh mushrooms last time I made them and that was a great touch....definitely a keeper.

I'm not going to lie..this did look yucky, BUT ooh was it good!!  I used cream of chicken to please my picky 12 year old (who ended up picking out the chiles) and it turned out very good.  Next time I'll try using the salsa at the end like a previous reviewer suggested.  Thanks so much Steph!!

I have made this recipe twice now and it turned out great each time. I did adjust the ingredients slightly, I cut up the chicken and added a packet of taco seasoning as I cooked it, I used more chicken than called for, and more cheese (extra sharp cheddar). I used cream of mushroom soup (because it was what I had), and it was great. I think I will try the cream of chicken next time. I know the cream of mushroom soup sounds strange, but the combination of tastes was surprisingly wonderful.

I made a quick version of this using one can of mild green enchilada sauce one cream cheese package cut in cube and 1/2 cup of sour cream and half of cup of milk. Added garlic salt and some pepper and one can of cream of chicken with herbs. Brown  each of the flour shells with butter in pan and then added a slotted spoon full of  cubed chicken in the middle of each tortilla shell and pour a cup of sauce over the chicken and folded the shell over. After making six chicken wraps I pour more of the sauce over the tops of the six wrap flour tortilla put in the a long baking pan sprinkled cheese on top and then put in the oven for 10-12 mins. This was a quick version of this recipe and boy was it good and easy to make! Made six enchilada great for leftovers but I doubt you have any left!  ...Raine

I make this with corn tortillas because that's how enchiladas are traditionally made. I just want to state that contrary to what others have said, you do not have to FRY your corn tortillas. Simply wrap 5-6 tortillas in wet paper towels and microwave them for 45 seconds. They will come out soft and pliable. This will cut your fat and calories considerably.

Every time I make this recipe, my husband and I gorge ourselves. It is soooooo good! Changes i make: no green onions, saute the chicken breast with some cayenne pepper, chili powder, and cumin, double the sauce, and add plenty of those same spices to the sauce and you heat it. So good.

Really not impressed with this recipe. I had been wanting to make it for SO long and was really excited. The filling only filled 4 tortillas, and once they were baked, they weren't very tasty. They were pretty "blah." It needed salsa added, or some sort of spice, or pepper or something. It was just lacking. It wasn't awful, by any means...it just needs to be changed (which I guess would completely defeat the purpose of the recipe).

I absolutely love this recipe! I have made it numerous times, and have added a few variations over time. The one thing I do regularly is double the sauce. We like it to be a little more on the creamy side!

These were really good and very easy to make! I used cream of chicken instead of the mushroom...just personal preference. I also omitted the green chiles because of an allergy, I don't feel this hurt the recipe in anyway! I will definitely make these again!

I haven't tried this particular recipe yet but my mom always made a similar one with corn tortillas.  The trick is to make it the day before and refrigerate.  It softens up the tortillas without having to fry them.

Great, kid friendly meal. The reason for the 3 stars - I followed the recipe to the letter and could barely fill 3 tortillas (and my tortillas were only 10 inch, not 12 inch). It's a good thing I was only feeding my two kids plus hubby and me. I'll make this again but be sure to double the amount of chicken.

Love this recipe. I always get compliments when I serve this and request for the recipe. I cook a large chicken breast in a slow cooker with taco seasoning until it falls apart and then I shred it.  Double the sauce so it does not get dry and always use corn and not flour tortillas. One of our favorite Mexican recipes.

We make these all the time, but with a few changes.  As other reviews have said I use salsa instead of milk and corn tortillas instead of flour.  I used Jack instead of cheddar, just 'caise I like it better.  Also, I shred the chicken with my fingers rather than chopping it.  Super yummy!

These are awesome! Loved them. I doubled the recipe and  followed some suggestions that recommended adding red bell pepper. I only had cream of chicken and cream of celery, so I used those instead of cream of mushroom. I also added some taco seasoning to the chicken, probably not authentic, but cream soup isn't either, is it?
I served with avocado and cilantro. Delicious! So warm and yummy in the middle of winter!

I made this recipe exactly as written except substituted corn tortillas. It is absolutely delicious!!! I could not taste the cream of mushroom which is a huge plus for me, and it really tasted like something I would eat at a restaurant.

Gosh these were delicious.  I doubled the sauce/filling, using one can of cream of chicken and one of mushroom.  I also did not measure the chicken; I just used 6 grilled and shredded chicken breasts in the filling.  I added one minced jalapeno (could have even used more) with the garlic and onions, 2 cloves of minced garlic instead of powder, a pinch of red pepper flakes, and I used corn tortillas.  I topped the enchiladas with chopped green onions, red pepper and sliced black olives for color.  To go with the dinner I made D’s Famous Salsa and Salsa De Tomatillo (both on this site) and they were perfect additions to the meal.  I made the salsa’s one night, the grilled the chicken the next, and assembled the enchiladas the next.  These enchiladas really were wonderful.

We ate this and didn't hate it but we are very confused about why anyone would call this an enchilada. It was an interesting flavor...not great not bad but just weird. I might make this again. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone interested in actual Mexican food.

These enchiladas are amazing!! I of course doctored up the recipe to suit my taste a bit more. I put 2 large chicken breasts in my slow cooker and added some chopped canned jalapeños, 1.5 Tbls of Taco Seasoning I (that recipe is also on this site) and then I added a can of cream of chicken and simmered for about 4-5hours on low. When the chicken was done I removed it from the slow cooker and shredded it, left the sauce in the slow cooker and stirred in the 1/2 cup sour cream and green onion (which I did not saute). I did everything else from here on as the recipe instructed and baked it in my oven on 350 for about 40 mins. Also, try looking for Manny's cafe style tortillas which are made with corn flour (they are a cross between a flour tortilla and a corn tortilla). They held up great in this recipe! This is a must try recipe and would be perfect to serve to guests for a Mexican themed evening.

I buy the biggest foil dish I can find and triple (sometimes quadruple) this recipe and when I'm done just toss the pan. No mess and I have enough meals to keep me out of the kitchen for awhile!

My husband usually dislikes Mexican-type food, and he LOVED these, so that's saying something (which is why I'm giving this 4 stars). I wasn't too impressed, however. They just seemed to be lacking something. I followed the recipe exactly except I coated the chicken with paprika, Cayenne pepper, and Lowery's Seasoning Salt before browning it in olive oil. I think I'll make it again next time I'm craving enchiladas and follow some of the other reviewers' advice and double the sauce and use cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups. I might add tomatoes, white onions, and mushrooms too. That might make it more tasty cuz as is its pretty boring.

This was great. I was really surprised that it tasted so well. By far the best we've had. Recipe needs no altering.*UPDATE* Have made this many more times and always make a double batch. Freeze the second batch before baking; thaw in fridge overnight and then bake as usual. Lifesaver on busy work days or when my 9 yr old begs for these :)

This recipe was great! It was my FIRST TIME ever attempting enchiladas and it worked out so well.  I did alter a couple of things for taste. 1) Boiled 2 large boneless breasts in 2 cups chicken boullion, 1/2 can tomatoes with green chilis, several cloves minced fresh garlic, about 1 cup diced onions, 1 tbs olive oil, dried parsely and some fajita seasoning. Let cook & simmer for a long time (not sure how long), shredded the chicken in the pan and set aside with all but about 1 cup liquid. 2) Added to the liquid in the same pan 2 cans cream of mushroon, 1 cup milk, and about 1 cup sour cream + more pepper. This gave the sauce some of the good flavor of the chicken and doubled the amount. 3) Used flour tortillas (what I had on hand). If you nuke the tortillas for 20-30 seconds they are pliable enough to fold and roll. I was really impressed with the results and my BOYFRIEND HAD 3RDS. Right now he is eating them for lunch leftovers and he says they are BETTER than the chicken enchiladas at our FAVORITE Mexican restaurant here in TX!! Big compliments and thank you for the recipe!!!!

These were the best chicken enchiladas ever!  I followed the directions exactly up until adding the chicken to the 1/4 remaining sauce.  I also added a package of taco mix and a can of crushed tomatoes. Mine made 8 instead of 6.  They tasted exactly like the ones that I get at my favorite Mexican restaurant.  I also used low fat everything and got them down to 5 points each on WW.  Will definately make again.

This recipe is so good and can easily be adapted to your own personal taste.   I've used Rotel tomatoes w/chiles, drained, and this is really good.  To save time, you can also make this "lasagna style".  Cut your tortilla shells to fit the dish.  Layer 1/3 of  shells in the bottom of the dish.  Add a layer of the chicken filling.  Repeat, ending with 3rd layer of shells.  Pour remaining sour cream mixture over this, and top with cheese.  To serve, cut in squares like lasagna.  My kids especially like this recipe!

I threw in Monterey Jack and sharp cheddar into the sauce but thought it still needed something, added a can of chunky rotel tomatoes and it kicked it up a notch!! I also doubled the recipe using a can of mushroom and a can of creme of chicken. Delicious and easy! I agree with other reviewers, GREEN CHILES are mild not hot at all, you must have used the wrong peppers if yours was spicy, this dish is very mild thats why the addition of the rotel for our tastes. It really made the dish much better.

This is the best, easiest chicken enchilada recipe ever! I've used cream cheese as a substitute for sour cream and it's even better! I also use cream of chicken soup instead and it's very satisfying!

I think this is a three to four star recipe as is.  We found it somewhat bland and not much like authentic Mexican.  With some changes made based on other reviewers suggestions though, this is definitely a 5 star dish.  The second time I made this, I poached and shredded the chicken and added about a half a pouch of taco seasoning.  Also, when I mixed the chicken with the 1/4 reserved sauce, it didn't seem moist enough.  Might have been my fault- I may have had too much chicken.  So, I added about a half can of drained petite diced tomatoes with sweet onions.  They gave it just enough moisture and added some nice flavor too.  I substituted fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder and I used Campbells spicy jack soup instead of cream of mushroom.  I also served this with both red and green salsa on the side so people could top their enchilada with the salsa of their choice.  With these substitution, these enchiladas were amazing!! I served it with a side of mexican rice with corn and black beans.  Next time, if I make a rice without beans, I would add black beans to the filling too.

Well after reading the reviews here, this is what I came up with.  I used  shredded chicken and added 1 pkg. of taco seasoning and heated thoroughly.  Instead of using chile peppers, I used 2 (7 oz.) cans of verde sauce (tomatillo & chiles) along with the Mexican cream of chicken soup that was mentioned in several reviews.  I also substituted white onions for the green as I didn't have them on hand and added more cheese.  This turned out wonderful although the sauce was quite spicy and hot. Next time I will cut back to 1 can of Verde sauce.  I served them with a Mexican Rice recipe I found on here, fresh guacamole and some beans.  Everyone was highly impressed and even my picky daughter asked for seconds.

You have got to try this with Campbell's new creamy chicken verde soup! I used 2 cans of it and doubled the sour cream for a moister filling and more sauce to cover it with...mixed x-sharp cheddar with pepper jack for the cheese...If you double the other filling/ sauce ingred. don't double the cheese ..maybe add slightly more. I also used fresh garlic,sweet onion and left out the green chili. Since the chicken breasts I used were large I made 8 enchiladas and could have gotten at least 10 out of it...The famliy ate it all and they loved the filling ! We had spanish rice with it.

I have to echo another reviewer - this recipe is so good, I've stopped looking at other Enchilada recipes.  We make them according to the recipe when we make it for our neighbors who don't like too much spice and add jalapenos when we make it for ourselves.  This is a WONDERFUL recipe.  Everyone we've made it for has raved about it and asked for the recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing Steph.

I made this the other night for my boyfriend and I, following the advice as some of the other posts, i.e. corn tortillas instead of flour, enchilada sauce, etc. He said it was better than any he's ever had in a restaurant! Will definately be making this again...

My husband didn't care much for the cream of mushroom soup in this recipe.  So, now when I make these, I add a little cumin, chili powder, and additional sour cream, and then bake it with my White Cheese Sauce on this site.  If you make these with the White Cheese Sauce, please, only use half the butter in the recipe because after baking the sauce some of the butter will rise to the surface.  Using half the butter works very well.

Excellent.  I have made this delite several times.  I use 1 tbl spoon of minced garlic, and 1 tbl spoon of taco seasoning when I cook the chicken.  It adds a kick to the dish once it is finished.  I also use a little more chicken than what it called for.  I use white onions instead of green onions.  And after this dish comes out of the oven, I throw on some black olives, and some fresh tomatoes.  YUMMY.  I serve with some spanish rice, and we have a meal in less than an hour.  Plus, we have leftovers.  Thank you Steph.

This recipe was an excellent base.  We like to eat light, so I changed some things.  I used fat free cream of mushroom soup, low fat sour cream, fat free cheddar cheese, and I added broccoli (about 1/2 a cup chopped) to the mix too!  I also added some cilantro and paprika to the seasoning about 2 TBS of dried cilantro and about 1 TBS. of Paprika.  It was absolutely delicious!

I made several alterations to make these lowfat, and they turned out great!  Cooking spray to saute the green onions, lowfat soup, fat-free sour cream, fat-free cheese, fat-free tortillas, and skim milk.  I sauteed the chicken in cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper.  Awesome!  Thank you for the recipe!

This is so good and easy and can be made with lefttover pork or poultry but I prefer cream of chicken soup, and if you don't have green onions regular onion, dried onion, or onion powder works-green onion is best though!  I add a little more garlic and onion powder too.

Pretty tasty. My picky 2 year old actually ate this so it gets 5 stars just for that! I did add some green peppers and onions that I sauteed in olive oil and with minced garlic.  I also used more cheese, but we are cheese fanatics in this house.

We really enjoy this recipe!  Used a few tips from other reviewers (added 1/8 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp cumin, increased amount of fat free sour cream and also used fat free cream of mushroom soup).  It is delicious!
I have also put all of the filling into the tortillas (forgot to set some aside to put on top of the finished tortillas) and all of the cheese on top (instead of mixing some with the sauce) and it still tasted great!
thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This was wonderful. Even my 15 year old son who is very picky loved it.  But I have to say It does need more chicken and you need to double the sauce.  I de-boned a 4lb chicken and that was just perfect for filling 8 tortilla's.  I also made it low-fat. Just use 99% fat free low sodium cream of mushroom soup, low-fat cheese and low-fat sour cream. you can't tell the difference in taste.  This is the best chicken enchalada with a cream sauce I have had in a long time, and can be low-fat too. I can't see how anybody can say they were bad.

My boyfriend was the guinea pig for this recipe and after he took two bites he exclaimed, "This one's a keeper!"  This recipe was easy, delicious and had an appealing presentation.  I added chili powder and cumin to spice it up.  A few minutes before the enchiladas were done, I sprinkled the top with sliced green onions.  Serve them with a dollop of sour cream and some salsa on top and it's perfect!

I have been making this for three years. Found it while searching for a recipe to make for a family with a new baby. It is now my go to meal for those I am making a meal for and also for my family. Everyone I have made it for wants the recipe. I make absolutely no tweaks. Delicious just the way the recipe is.

I have a family member who has to watch his potassium intake, so I had to use Cream of Chicken rather than Cream of Mushroom.  This may be why, even after adding a jalapeño,  it was REALLY bland.  Lots of people were adding Cream of Chicken and liking it so I hoped it would work out.  I'm giving it 4 stars cuz I think the original recipe choice of Cream of Mushroom would be better, even if it's not spicy!  If I make it again I'll probably add cayenne like some people suggested.  Keep up the suggestions, people!  I don't mind if you tell me what your family's personal preferences are, why your dog liked it, whatever! :)  People should lighten up and enjoy cooking, that's the point.

Good, but needs more flavor. I used a yellow onion instead of green onion, added cooked rice in with the chicken and doubled the sauce as others suggested. I think adding some red or green peppers in with the onion would be good and maybe topping with some enchilada sauce.

I didn't have green onions so I used a small yellow onion. I also thought that it could have used more chicken, but it was still delicious.

I tried it as is. Always rate a recipe as it is written.  Easily 5 stars. That being said, every cook adds or changes things to meet their own tastes.  I prefer to try the recipes on this site as they are written, and the next time make it mine.  This recipe is Great as it is,  but now I add my own touches. Instead of green chilies I add chopped jalapenos. I also add a can of diced tomatoes with chilies to the filling for a bit more flavor. We like the flour tortillas but prefer the corn. I add some cumin, cilantro, and Mexican cheese.  Always double it because it is always a hit. Making it today!! 

Update April 24, 2016--I still make it and enjoy it.  Due to health style changes I use Campbells fat free soups and non-fat  Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  It is still wonderful

Just made this for the second time in two weeks.  No leftovers, my kids love it!  The first time I made it exactly as the recipe called for, except I substituted a can of green enchilada sauce for the green chiles, as my children do not like them.  Our only complaint then was that there wasn't more of it.  Tonight, I used more green enchilada sauce... both in the internal sauce, and then drizzled over the whole pan before popping in the oven.  Fabulous.  I realize this is not a traditional enchilada dish, but it's divine.  Even better, it's EASY.  Will be making this regularly.

Not my favorite. The overall flavor was good, but the flour tortillas made it pretty gummy and doughy tasting.  Probably would be better with corn tortillas.  I substituted cream of chicken for the mushroom because it sounded better.  Also, I used the green onions for garnish instead of cooking in butter, along with sliced olives.  The taste was very good, but next time I will use corn tortillas.

This recipe was a hit in my house! The sauce turnen out really well and kept the enchiladas from being dry. I used chicken breast despite anyone in my house liking white meat so next time i will try it with both white & dark meat. I did double all ingredients and added a can of rotel and can of crm of chicken. I will definitely keep this recipe in rotation.

I followed the recipe, as I normally do when I try a recipe for the first time and rate them. They were okay. It seemed salty and not any big flavor stood out. I would try it again with some of the suggestions made on other reviews, but definitely not a 4.5 star rating as is.

Yummy,but as a mexican i need to say this is not chicken enchiladas, you can describe it as inspired by chicken enchiladas, or your version of. Enchiladas, come from mole( which is like a sauce made of various ingredients, such chocolate, different species of dried chiles, cookies, plantin, peanuts, etc).But confort food is always tasty=0)

Spread a little sauce in the bottom of your dish before you put your rolled up enchiladas in. I didn't think of it and I didn't see anyone suggest it but I sure wish I had. I crammed them in there pretty tight and none of the sauce got to the bottom which made the tortillas kind of dry and tough. I knew I would like it spicier and saucier so I added some red pepper flakes and a 4oz can of chopped jalapenos to the mix and doubled the sauce recipe. It was good! but that no sauce in the bottom was annoying! I hope this will keep you from making the same mistake! Topped them with salsa, shredded lettuce and a sprinkling of fresh chopped green onions, mexi rice, and a can of spicy refried beans warmed up. Very satisfying indeed.

I thought that this recipe was delicious and very easy to make.  I made a few changes only because I didn't feel like running out to the store so I used what I had on hand.  The changes that I made were the following - I used finely chopped white onions because I didn't have green onions, I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom, in the green chiles I added a few jalapenos and I chopped them up very fine in my food processor.  I cooked my chicken breasts in chicken broth with a half of an onion and a few whole garlic cloves and then chopped it in my food processor.  In the sauce mixture of cream of chicken soup, I added some jalapeno juice, chili powder, onion powder, garlic salt, cumin, and paprika.  When I stuffed the shells with the chicken I also added some shredded cheddar on top of the chicken before rolling them.  Other than these changes I made the recipe exactly as directed.  It was very delicious and I will make it again.

Didn't change a thing except for the soup.  I used low fat cream of chicken instead of mushroom.  Personal preference.  This was enjoyed by everyone in my family.  An easy put together for weeknight meal.  I served with sour cream and guacamole on the side with some chili powder for an extra kick.  Delicious!

This is 5 star or better combining some of the suggestions others made. I used all the original ingredients but added a few dashes of cayenne, salt and pepper, cumin and garlic powder. Used yellow onion instead, 1/2 cup of salsa, and added the cream of mushroom and sour cream all to the skillet. Meanwhile I made a quick chicken-flavored rice and added that. I layered soft large torillas 2 at a time and poured the ingredients in-between. I ended up with four layers including top and bottom. Sprinkled extra cheese and chicken mixture on top and baked for 20 minutes at 350. It was incredible!

The recipe was good...I doubled the recipe and with the 12" tortillas I was only able to fill 8 tortillas.  I didn't have green onions so used a sweet onion diced, and also used one COM soup and the other Cream of Chicken.  I also added about half of a package of taco seasoning.  Delicious! :)

I made this with leftover chicken, but without green chilies and mushroom soup, which I can't get here in Germany. Instead I  used real cream and lots of garlic powder. My guest and I liked it anyway. She often commented on how good it was. A definite remake.

I had been craving chicken enchiladas for over a week and finally found this recipe! I made some changes, including using low-fat/light & low sodium versions of everything. My picky family absolutely loved it and each of them went back for seconds! I boiled my chicken with chopped onion and garlic before shredding it. I used both cream of chicken and cream of mushroom in the sauce along with the onion, garlic, chiles and sour cream. I also added a half of a packet of taco seasoning. Before filling the tortillas with the chicken mixture, I spread refried beans on each of them. They turned out amazing! I served with sweet corn and rice. Will definitely add to the rotation.

Great recipe! I had already bought the ingredients before thinking that, yes, corn tortillas would be better. Still the enchiladas were flavorful and even held up the next day for lunch. I didn't find them spicy enough so next time I will add a freshly minced jalapeno to the sauce/filling. Thanks!

This has to got to be the best chicken enchiladas I've made!! And believe me, I've all tried all kinds of recipes off this site and others that called for taco salsa, some called to make your own salsa, well you get the picture.  But I have to say this recipe was easy to follow and came out so tasty in the end.  I will say that the sauce could easily be doubled since most of it seems to evaporate in the oven.  My husband likes his food crispy so I kept it inside the oven for the full 35 minutes...Oh, and yes, this recipe may not be 100% authentic but so aren't many, many others on the Internet.  They are chicken enchiladas, every cook has a different take on them!! I prefer these because they are lower cal considering you don't have to dip the tortilla in oil and you can even substitute it with whole wheat flour tortillas! Give this recipe a try and you'll see what I'm talking about!

These were absolutely delicious. I love mushrooms so I decided to add a cup of sautéed (and drained) mushrooms when I added the cream of mushroom soup. I also like a little more spice so I added about 2tsp of freshly chopped jalapenos. Beside those two minor additions I did not change anything else in this great recipe. A little time consuming (about 1 hour to prepare and cook) but definitely a wonderful recipe. Will make again!

This was incredible!  My husband took one bite and said it was the best enchiladas he's ever had in his life.  I took chicken tenders and seasoned them with chili powder, garlic, cayenne, salt and pepper.  Then I browned them with some olive oil.  I sauteed a diced red onion and diced fresh jalapeno with the can of chiles.  Then I followed the rest of the directions, except I used corn tortillas instead of flour.  It turned out spectacular!!!

These chicken enchiladas are very good and full of flavor. I did make a few changes. I used cream of chicken soup (large can) more chicken and cheese. It was a big hit in my family, and I plan on making this recipe again.

There are without a doubt the best enchiladas I've ever had. The sauce is so delicious and creamy this recipe could truly be served in a restaurant. The only change I made was that I added pepper in the sauce and on top of the enchiladas and increased the amount of cheese. Amazing recipe!

These were great!  I think I almost came up with my own recipe with all the changes I made though!  I substituted cream of chicken soup and added a can of drained tomatoes with green chiles (along with the can of regular green chiles) and a can of drained black beans.  I used a minced garlic clove instead of garlic powder too.  I omitted the milk (seems like it would make it soggy) and used leftover Thanksgiving turkey breast, cubed, instead of the chicken.  They were a little spicy (not for me, but if you have kids who don't like spicy you might want to cut back on the chiles).  These were easy to make and I like that they don't require enchilada sauce, which I don't always have on hand.

Very cheesy and good!  Followed the recipe exactly but only made four tortillas (my dish wouldn't fit 6 nicely). Attempted to make it healthier since it's a pretty fatty recipe by using Healthy Choice soup, light sour cream, low fat cheeses and I omitted the milk. It didn't seem to need it and I was hoping for more gooey than runny and it was a perfect consistency. Will probably be making this again as the hubby really enjoyed this dish. Served it alongside yellow rice.  An easy and plentiful meal.

love this recipe!  I changed a little, but do have to say one of the things I like about it are the flour tortillas, I think the corn ones are good for a red sauce enchiladas but prefer flour for this one.  I agree with others that the corn ones are very tough.  I added a can of rotel tomatoes and added some extra cheese...awesome recipe my family loves!

Love these, but next time I have to double the sauce, it was dry.  Probably because I used too much chicken.  Oh and I used regular onion, a nice sweetness!  Thanks MIL for turning me on to these!

this recipe is pretty good. i did make a few changes by adding more spices like cumin,a little salt and pepper. also instead of using cream of mushroom soup i used cream of chicken soup and used white corn tortillas instead of flour. also added 1 cup of shredded jalapenos cheese,halfed it for sauce and topped the rest. family loved the revised version. give it a try

Great recipe. Just made it for my Bunco group, and they loved it.

I did make a few alterations based on previous reviewers:

- I used Campbell's Fiesta Nacho Cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom

- I used corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas

- I poached the chicken, shredded it, and seasoned it with Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime seasoning.

I served it with homemade Spanish rice and margaritas, and it was a hit! Enjoy!

This recipe is a keeper!  I did alter it a bit.  I used a can of rotel tomatoes instead of the diced chiles just for a little more flavor and used red onions instead of green because that's what I had!  It was so good, my husband and I both were sad that I was only able to get four enchiladas out of it!  Next time I will double the recipe and probably shred the chicken instead of cube it so that the sauce and chicken blend together better.  Will definitely be making this many more times!

My husband loves these and his complaint is always that there just aren't enough!  I use chopped red onions just because I always seem to have that instead of green.  While the onions are cooking I add the garlic and also Adobo seasoning.   I don't use diced green chilies but rather the green Chile enchilada sauce because I definitely agree that you need to add more sauce.

This was amazing! My husband called me at work to tell me it was the best lunch he had ever had...and I cook him lunch every day. This will become a staple in my arsenal. Most importantly, it was SO easy. The only tweak was to cook the chicken with low fat/sodium broth on low for 4hrs in a crock pot. It made the shredding of the chicken a snap.  Love this recipe!

Not much flavor, very bland. Should have known when it called for cream of mushroom soup. My kids liked it because it wasn't spicy. That was a plus. Won't make this again.

Delicious! I know this recipe probably gets a lot of flack for not being "authentic" because of the cream of mushroom soup. But when something is this easy and tasty, who cares? I used Amy's Organic Cream of Mushroom Soup, which is only semi-condensed, so you don't need to add the milk. When using this soup you might want to also add some salt to taste. I think my hubby will be asking me to make this one again!

I gave it 3 stars only because my husband liked it and he is a very picky eater. I on the other hand thought it was very bland. I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom.

I get frustrated when someone rates a recipe as 5 stars - BUT - then they tell you about the 10 changes they made...
Guess what?!?!?!  This recipe is terrific just the way it is!!  Would be great paired with a green salad and/or a rice side dish.

Have made this dish a dozen times or more and it turns out great every time.  The only thing that I do different is add more mushroom soup to the top.  I have also added jalapeños to this recipe before for a little spice and it turned out awesome!  Great recipe - turns out great every time!

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe, used a packet of taco seasoning, cream of chicken instead of mushroom soup, plus white corn tortillas instead of flour.  So that's one packet of seasoning per DOUBLED recipe.  About 16 tortillas fit in a LARGE oblong Pyrex.  Very nice results and quite filling so watch your serving size.

I have made a variation of this recipe for many years, the basic idea was given me by a friend whose family owned a restaurant in Arizona. I've always cooked a whole chicken and shredded the meat, which gives a more flavorful taste using white and brown meat. This also gives me the stock to use in diluting either cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup [sometimes a combination of both], then I mix in the sour cream. I then tear flour tortillas in small bits and place a layer on the bottom of a 9x13 pan. I continue layering all the other ingredients until the pan is about 3/4 full. The cream sauce is then added with a final layer of cheese. This recipe allows as many variations as you choose. We always have called this our "Sour Cream Enchilada Casserole".

Delicious, low-acid way to make chicken enchiladas. As much as I love tomatoes, I should not be eating them (acid reflux) and always regret it later. I love that there are no tomatoes and also omitted the chiles. It was great even without these "key" ingredients.

It's a good Americanized enchildada, my mom even made one similar growning up. I did not use flour tortillas though. I could never have a non corn enchilada.

As is this would be a little bland for our house, but it is a great base. I added a few of my own touches and it was a hit at my father-in-law's house.  First of all, I wanted to use corn tortillas and couldn't find any at my local (very rural) grocery store, so I made my own. I used corn flour, water, lime juice and salt for those. Then to the actual recipe I shredded the chicken (some left over rotisserie and some additional chicken tenders boiled in water to supplement). Then I added a bit of oregano, cheddar cheese soup and cream of chicken soup. Added as well was chili pepper, fresh cilantro, fresh garlic, and since I didn't have enough green onions-some white onions. Sorry I don't have measurements for you, I tend to cook on the fly and just add things until it suits my taste. Cheers! Thanks for the base recipe.

This was easy and everyone loved it. I used flour tortillas to keep it easy and I also prefer the texture. Will make again. Great use of leftover chicken.

These were very good- my husband says to add them to the rotation. The reason for 4 stars? For a working mom of 2 it is a little time intensive for the result. I had to cook and dice the chicken one day, make the sauce and assemble the dish during a nap time, and then finally bake it the evening that it was to be served. The flavor was quite good and we enjoyed the dish, I just don't know if I will make the time investment again for this.

When this dish is made the way it is written it is the best chicken enchiladas ever. I think it has to do with sauteeing the green onions in butter. Yummy!

A great chicken and flour tortilla enchilada recipe.   If you don't like mushroom soup, you can substitute cream of chicken.

I made this recipe as I had left over chicken to use up.  I certainly thought there was no wow factor, if I am honest they were so bland.  I followed the recipe exactly, so I guess for my family it needs changes to make it work.  Glad I made it but its not a recipe I will be using again.

Delish! I was worried the flour tortillas would be too gooey, but they came out perfect. I doubled the ingredients and filled 8 tortillas in one 9x13" pan. My husband hates veggies of all kinds including chiles and green onions, but he ate these up and asked me to make them again!! and I definitely will :)

Yummy! It needs a bit more enchilada sauce, as others mentioned, as well as some chopped up tomatoes (within or on top). Flavor was yummy!

EDIT:  I made this recipe again (actually, I forgot that I made it the first time until I went to review it.)  My original comments stand:  double the filling, use smaller tortillas, and add oregano and taco seasoning to the sauce.  Original review:  This recipe was somewhat frustrating.  Because my family loves extra sauce, I doubled the sauce & chicken.  Yet, as I was filling the tortillas, I quickly realized that I did not have nearly enough filling to complete 6 large enchiladas.  I was skeptical that there would be enough chicken when reading the recipe, and I was right.  I think if you use smaller tortillas, this might work out ok, but not with the size suggested.  We loved the flavor, but I marked it way down because the measurements were way off.  Also, I cooked my chicken in taco seasoning, as suggested in other reviews, which added a nice flavor.

Very good recipe!  I was hesitant, when I saw the cream of mushroom soup in the ingredients.  However, I can say this was a delicious recipe.  I did make a few changes: I used corn tortillas instead, and used another reviewer's suggestion of briefly warming them in a saute pan sprayed with olive oil, before filling them with the chicken mixture.   I added some chopped yellow onions to the butter and sauteed them for 3-4 minutes, then added the green onions near the end.  I used a cheddar/jack cheese mixture, and I used low-fat milk.  Husband says he likes this recipe better than the one I have been using for 25 years!!!

This was great for a big group dinner.  I started wtih 2 lbs chicken.  I used onion instead of green onion, added a can of Rotel to the sauce as well as an extra 12 cup sour cream and a can of cream of chicken as others had recommended.  It made nine 12 inch enchiladas in 1 large (13x9) pan and one smaller pan and was a big hit!

Fantastic with no left overs.  As a time saver, I used a rotisserie chicken.  Definitely a favorite and will make again and again.

A very good recipe. I would suggest using cream of chicken rather than cream of mushroom. It had too much of a mushroom taste to it.

This came out fantastic! As my husband was eating it he told me to go online later and give it 5 stars! I did make some modifications.  I doubled the recipe and used chicken tenderloins.  I cooked the chicken in oil a few hours before and set it aside.  For the soup mixture I used one can of condensed mushroom soup and one of condensed chicken soup, and the sour cream.  I used a white onion, and 6 oz chile peppers.  When I mixed in the chicken,  I also put in taco seasoning mix which gave it a really good kick.  With the remaining 3/4 of the liquid mix, I added 1/4 cup enchilada sauce instead of milk.  I served it with sour cream, hot sauce for an optional topping, and refried beans on the side.  I will defnitley be making this again!

We love these enchiladas at our house. Some changes that i make are to double the sauce, and add cumin and chili powder to the chicken mixture. I also make Mexican rice from this website and spread it in the bottom of my baking dish, i then top the rice with a southwest blend of frozen vegetables (corn, black beans, red/green peppers and onion), i then assemble enchiladas as directed in the recipe and put them on top of the rice/veggie mixture and cover with sauce. It is SO yummy this way. Also, i always buy the uncooked flour tortillas and cook them on the stove before filling. If you've never tried them, most stores carry them now, you will never be able to go back to regular tortillas!

I loved it. I cut out alot of fat by using fat free sour cream and reduced fat/lower sodium soup. Could not tell the difference! (I would add some extra soup next time though) Will make this again.

This was a great recipe.  I agree with others that corn tortillas are a more authentic way to make enchiladas.  If you want to use a corn tortilla without the extra oil, wet the corn tortillas and place them inside two wet paper towels.  Heat in microwave for 20-30 seconds.  This will make them easier to roll.

Loved this recipe! I changed it a bit just to make it a little more healthy. Used fat free sour cream, reduced fat cheese, 98% fat free soup and skim milk. I might add some onions & diced tomatoes next time but was delish just as is!

Some prior reviewers confuse me about recipes being boring or lacking flavor.  When I cook, I tailor all recipes to suit my family, so I rarely make something as-is as far as spices are concerned.  Regardless, this recipe was fabulous and the flavor was great.  Per other recommendations, I used 1/2 mushroom soup and half chick soup.  They sell it in one can.  I also used ground chicken and added extra (1 1/2 pounds) so there was enough filling. Other than adding a little more salt and garlic and other standard staples, I used all other ingredients.  My husband and kids loved it and want me to make again.  It is very filling and somewhat heavy, but man was it good! Thanks for the recipe!!

My husband and I love, love, love these enchiladas! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I used cream of mushroom "and" chicken instead of just cream of mushroom, and I added some cilantro for more flavor. Yum! :)

Yeah..so good..I used the Mexican 4-cheese blend (not the taco cheese-gross) and I used extra in the filling and on top-love cheese! Also, used minced garlic with the onions instead of garlic powder and I shredded the chicken instead of chopping it. It was yum!

Very good, simple enchiladas! The first time I tried adding stuff to make it better - the second time I just followed the recipe and they were fantastic! Not to spicy, just good simple enchiladas with great flavor. Easy to make and good as leftovers.

I made this recipe as is, but left out the green onion and used shredded rotisserie chicken.  My only complaint was I only ended up with 4 enchiladas.  Next time I will use smaller tortillas or double the filling.  Delicious!

What a great recipe!  I as well made some modifications that I hope will help you.  First of all, I cooked chicken breasts in my crockpot with a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, a small can of diced jalapenos, some seasoning (chili powder, cayenne, etc), thinly sliced onions and topped it off with a little chicken broth so the chicken had enough liquid to cook in.  The finished chicken shredded perfectly and had the EXACT taste and look I was hoping for!  I replaced the flour tortillas for corn (never use flour for enchiladas!), fried them in oil for a few seconds for flexibility, and used a slotted spoon to fill the tortillas with my own mixture (plus add shredded cheese).  This is also important:  the sauce is not enough!  So to the can of soup mixture, I added one can of green chile enchilada sauce.  This recipe makes a great starting point.  My boyfriend LOVED it, and it's definitely going in my permanent recipe book.  Hope my suggestions helped you!

My family LOVES this recipe! It's very, very good. My son isn't too thrilled with chiles, so instead of those, I added a tablespoon of chicken taco seasoning. I also used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. It turned out delicious.

Dee-lish!! I did add a few other things to spice it up as others suggested. Alternative for frying the corn tortillas...lightly spray both sides of the tortillas with cooking spray or brush a little vegetable oil and place on a baking sheet at 350 for about 2-3 minutes or until soft & warm. Less fat & mess!

This is one of the best recipes I have found. This was the first chicken enchilada recipe I made. It turned out extremely well. The only thing I did different was used cream of chicken and mushroom, one whole containter of sour cream, 7oz diced green chiles, I also added some salsa verde to the mix, placed cheese in the tortillas when I rolled them and placed cheese on the finished product. Best recipe ever. Thanks!

I made this for a group of friends last night and they all really liked it (at least I think so...haha) and asked for the recipe. We are from New Mexico and feel like we really know our enchiladas, so these are fairly easy to make from home, but not the "authentic" enchiladas you find in Mexican restaurants here. After reading the other reviews though I did made a couple changes - added another whole can of HOT Green Chile Enchilada sauce and a bit more sour cream and garlic powder. I used regular onions instead of green onions and more cheese in the end.  I used soft flour tortillas and they were good, not too soggy.  I think that corn tortillas would be good too. Otherwise great easy recipe! The leftovers were good too.

Really good but I made a mistake and added all the cooked chicken to the sauce and was stuck as to what to do. As we love the Burrito Pie Recipe I decided as it is too hard to take the chicken out we should make it into a "Chicken Enchilada Pie". As I said it was excellent and a little bit easier to make as I used 5 layers of flat bread with sauce in-between and toped of with cheese, Baked at 350 for 15- 20 Minutes. I would like to try this recipe properly but my mistake was delicious, and knows I can have two options for dinner: Burrito and/or Enchilada Pie.

Wonderful! Because I like my food a little spicy, I added jalepenos, and red and green bell peppers to the mix.  I also used Campbells Southwest Style Pepperjack Condensed Soup instead of cream of mushroom...made ALL the difference in the world! Absolutely will make again! This is an instant family favorite. I ran out in minutes!

here's my two cents for a low-fat alternative: saute chicken w/ 3/4 cup minced onion & pan drizzle of olive oil.  i sprinkled each side of chix with garlic powder, salt, pepper & fajita seasoning (penzey's.  best seasonings anywhere & online!!)  once just cooked, i removed chicken but added pan remnants to the remaining sauce ingredients. for that i used a can each of cream of mushroom & chicken (healthy request for each) & about 3/4 cup lite sour cream.  as well, i used two 4 oz cans of green chili's AND a can of jalapeno salsa (so sorry, can't remember the brand but its a mexican brand in a 4 oz. green can, el patio or close).  i also used whole wheat tortillas and 2% mexican cheese mix.  MY FAMILY LOVED IT!!!  absolutely loved it.  fiance said it was the best meal i've prepared yet (whatever!)  we love shredded lettuce & diced tomates on enchiladas so that was the finishing touch.  i flavored some left over basmati rice with lime juice and chopped fresh cilantro.  muy delicioso!! now that i've made it once it will be easy to make again w/o following the recipe.  solid good meal.

These were very good.  Would definitely eat these again.  I think I will make more sauce next time as I was only able to fill 5 tortillas and I was being frugal with those.  I did add diced mushrooms when I sauteed the onions and it was very good.  Other than that, I didn't change any ingredients.  Also, I cooked them for 25 minutes without the cheese on top and added that the last 6-8 minutes.  I find the cheese gets a little tough if I cook it from the beginning.

These have become a real favorite at my house.  I have found that they work especially well with people who hate spicy foods because you can easily remove the green chiles and it will still taste delish!

I actually made this for the first time last week for two of my girlfriends - one who has a brand new baby and the other who's on bed rest @ 32 weeks pregnant.  I didn't make extra for us.  Not sure why?!  Both of my friends raved about them and asked for the recipe.  I just had to try it.  I made them for dinner last and we all loved it!  This is a keeper!  YUMMY!!

My guests loved these, but they were a little mushroomy for me.  I'll try the "cream of chicken and mushroom" soup next time.  Used pre-cooked Tyson fajita chicken strips and this gave it an awesome flavor.  Will make again.  **UPDATE**  Made again using the ckn/shroom soup and they were perfect!  No need to add any other spices; they were flavorful and yummy.  I used eight 8" tortillas and they fit perfectly in a 9x13" pan.

I don't know how the original recipe would rate, but the version I made was fabulous!  It all looked a little bland to me so I made the following revisions:
I sauteed the chicken in oil and butter with onion, garlic, diced red pepper, and minced fresh cilantro.  After it had cooked I took it out of the skillet and shredded it. Then I simmered it in chicken broth and fajita seasoning for about 15 minutes.  It smelled awesome!  
For the sauce, I doubled the amount after reading some others' reviews.  I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken.  2 cans of diced green chilies, 1 cup of sour cream, and a teaspoon each of garlic powder, cumin, and chili powder.  I used a mix of Monterrey Jack and cheddar for the cheese.  Great reviews at this house!

This is more of a burrito with a creamy cheese sauce... rather bland at that.  Would be better if the chicken had some spice.. besides garlic powder and absolutely no packaged taco seasoning as other reviwers suggested. lol  Perhaps sautee chicken with fresh garlic, comino and cilantro to start and corn tortillas.. slightly cooked in hot oil before rolling.  I love to try new things.. but really had to almost completely change this recipe before serving!

I loved these enchiladas & I usually don't care for too many enchiladas.  They are the perfect consistancy.  The only thing I would add would be spices to the chicken (cayenne pepper, southwest seas, etc.) to make them have a little more flavor.  Other than that GREAT!!

YUM :) I will be making this often.  Although it did take some time to prepare (probably because I had to cook & shred the chicken) it was worth the wait.  Only made a few changes (per other reviews): I used 98% fat free cream of chicken (I like mushrooms but hubby doesn't), one clove fresh garlic, and regular onion instead of green onion.  I can't say I would make it any different next time!  I served with sour cream & salsa on the side.  Not very good as left overs...

This was a hit at our house! 
Our variations - cooked 3lbs of chicken in skillet w/Adobo seasoning and Southwestern seasonings.  For the sauce we used cream of chicken soup and the rest of the listed ingredients with the addition of 1 can of Ortega (hot) red enchilada sauce. Served w/spanish rice and corn - YUMMY!

I liked this recipe, it was a lot simpler than I at first anticipated.  I only cooked the enchiladas till the cheese was done and the tortillas slightly browned.  About 20 minutes.

Great! I made a couple of minor changes - no green onions or chilies, cream of chicken instead of mushroom, and added El Pato sauce to the chicken while cooking. Perfect for my picky eater!

I used the large burrito tortillas, and doubled everything else.  This makes fantastic leftovers!  This is one of our favorites meals. Great to serve with white corn tortillas chips.

Wow! The variation I tried was very flavorful! I doubled the sauce(1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can fiesta nacho cheese soup, 12 oz. sour cream with chives,  2 divided cups of cheddar jack cheese with jalapeno peppers, 1/2 cup milk). I used multigrain tortillas (they come in a pack of 10 so there's less waste).
It turned out so well that I'm done experimenting with the recipe and will make it this way  for my family often. Thanks Steph!

I really enjoy this recipe as a base to enhance the flavor.  I use a precooked chicken as others suggested that my husband enjoys taking apart, put all the ingredients  (except chicken and tortilla!) in a pot and simmer to a creamy consistancy.  I omit the butter, I use real garlic and 1 can of the mild enchilada sauce as others recommended!  And lots of old chedder cheese!  We love cheese!  As well as in the sauce I put cheese inside the wrap and as directed sprinkled over the top!!  We enjoy this served with rice or alone!  Makes a yummy leftover!! And I agree with spraying the pan with cooking spray ....makes the clean up very easy!

Very good, didn't change a thing.  We're usually not that crazy about cream soup based recipes as they can often be fairly bland, but this was actually quite flavorful.

This was great. I made this for my boys (age 4, 2, &1) so I made a few changes. I used their favorite chicken nuggets diced, and I omited the chiles. I used Vidalia onions instead of green and added extra cheese to the soup mixture. My 4 year old is SUPER picky, and he  cleaned his plate. My one year old fussed when the enchiladas were gone. I will make this again and again.

I was expecting a flavor similar to Enchilada Suiza.    Luckily, I tasted the sauce before I mixed my chicken with it and it tasted like plain old canned cream of mushroom soup.I am from Southern Calif and my husband is from South Texas and this is not a flavor we like for our enchiladas.  Sorry.  Looks like I will just make my standard green sauce for chicken enchiladas.  Oh well.  Thanks anyway.

delicious, different take on enchiladas. I agree that there seemed to be a lot of sauce, and not enough mixture altogether for 6 12" tortillas. I only got four out of the mixture, and they were scarcely filled. I'd recommend reserving LESS than 3/4 sauce for the topping and using MORE sauce for the chicken filling (to go INSIDE the enchiladas) so that there is more of a filling. Also, ten inch tortillas would probably work better. However, can't argue with the delicious taste. Still looking for the perfect Mexican rice to accompany this...

This was a really good recipe.  I brought it to a pot luck party and everyone loved it.  I took the advice of other reviewer and made these changes to the recipe: I used a rotiserre chicken and shredded the meat instead of cuting in cubes.  (1 chicken was enough to double the recipe).  I also used mexican cheese (pre-shredded kraft) and I used campbell's cream of mushroom & Chicken soup.  I also used those homemade tortillas that you just have to cook.  I also broiled the enchilada for about 3 minutes to give them a crispy appearance.  The only thing that I would recommend for people that plan to double the recipe is to use a seperate pan for each 6 enchiladas.  I sort of stacked the top row of 6 onto the bottom row of six and the bottom row tasted fine but didn't look very nice they were all goopy.

AWESOME!!! I mean, really, this recipe didn't need another 5 star rating, but I couldn't resist. I made only a few changes to this recipe: I used EVOO instead of butter, forgot the milk by accident, and used a can of tomatoes/chiles since I couldn't find a can of chiles only. I also cooked the chicken with some taco seasoning instead of just plain. I have to agree with another reviewer on the fact that we thought there was too much sauce.  I used a little extra chicken than called for and mixed it with about half the sauce and double (or triple, who knows!) the cheese. Then, I simply baked the enchiladas for about 10 minutes (the sauce was still hot), and topped with TONS of cheddar and baked em for about another 10. Served this with Mexican Rice by Steph...YUMMY!!! As always, I used mostly organic ingredients and these were WONDERFUL! Thanks so much for sharing.

These are a hit!!   I used cream of celery soup, white onions, fresh garlic and garlic powder in the sauce.  And I increased the sour cream to 1 cup.  I would suggest after making sauce, then salt and pepper to taste.  I also added a dash of ground cayenne.  

After reading reviews about 'bland' problems, I added a couple of tablespoons of Lawry's powdered taco spices to the chicken for extra flavor.  You could just add cumin and chili powder.  And, because my husband likes onions in his enchiladas, I added 1/2 - 3/4 chopped white onions to the chicken.  Made these with corn tortillas.  (I also have never really liked recipes based on canned soup, but you really can't tell that there is soup in this.)  I don't have to look any further for a great sour cream chicken enchilada dish, I've found it!

This was pretty good.  I followed other readers' advice and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, cumin, and lemon juice.

Next time I will add tomatoes.

These came out pretty well & tasted even better the next day.  I would, however, recommend using more than 1.5 cups of chicken.  It's not very much per enchillada.  Also, the bottoms were dry, making each one a little hard to cut.  Next time I will spread a little bit of the sauce at the bottom of the baking dish before laying the enchilladas down.

I just followed the recipie as a guideline only, as I didn't think the soup mixture would be something my family would enjoy, but this is what I did to tailor the recipie to suit our tastes, and it's this version that I rated.
I bought one can of red enchilada sauce, and I sauteed a small onion and cooked chicken in about 3/4 of the can of sauce.  I then added about 2 heaping TBS of sour cream to the mixture along with Mexican shredded cheese and 1/2 4 oz can of green chilies, and cooked until smooth.  For the sauce over the enchiladas, I cooked the remaining sauce, 2 more TBS sour cream, cheese and the rest of the chilies until smooth and poured over the enchiladas.  I topped with more cheese and baked as per original recipie until cheese is melted.  My family loved this version, and it was fairly quick to prepare.

My family (including college aged) sons immediately loved this.  I doubled the sauce, cheese,chicken and used white onion and 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I was a little skeptical and very pleasantly surprised!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  Also thanks to other reviewers for ideas using other meat or seafood.

This is one of my very favorite recipes.  We LOVE it at my house.  I am big on cutting out time, and I used pre-cooked Southwestern chicken, which gives it a nice taste.  I like to double the recipe.  For some reason I love to eat it in the morning too.  Everyone in my family loves it.  I made it at work, and one of my clients said it was the yummiest thing he had ever eaten!!!!

I will make these again! Like the others I made more sauce, mixed some salsa in with the sauce that went over the top and added a little chili powder for extra zip. I used white corn tortillas (spray a pan then heat a few seconds on either side to soften so they roll up easy). I think this really made them yummy. White corn tortillas are small - like if you unfolded a taco, maybe others had problems with too little filling because they used a larger size? I made double the filling but wont next time because I ended up with a dozen of them. They were just as good the second day though!

These are great and I have shared this recipe with friends who loved it also. I have made them with ground beef as well. Once with just plain old ground beef and the next with a can of spicy chili beans in the meat. Omit the green onion and use white onion when browning the beef. I think next time I will make them with imitation crab meat and a can tiny shrimp. MMMMMMMMM sounds good , huh????? oh, i forgot that I have also used a can of enchilada sauce before putting the sour cream mixture on.  EVEN BETTER!!!!!!!

Good recipe.  I increased everything based on past reviews so I had 6 fat and saucy enchiladas.  To make more sauce I added another half-can of cheddar cheese soup to the cream of shroom.  Sounds weird, but there was lots of real cheddar cheese and it made a tasty combination.  I also used leftover chicken that had been marinated - it had lots of flavor so I had no blandness issues.

Everyone loved it! Very simple to make. I had to double the recipe to be able to feed 4 adults and was able to get 10 enchiladas using large tortillas. I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken also used taco blend cheese instead of regular cheddar.

wonderful and tasty!  i rubbed 2 chicken breasts with the 'taco seasoning' recipe also from this site and then after that was cooked used the same pan to make the sauce.  i threw in some fresh minced garlic with the green onions, and sauteed this with extra taco seasoning before adding everything else.  i also shredded the chicken and used 6 8" taco-size flour tortillas.  they fit perfectly into a 9x13 pan and the filling was the perfect amount.  served with salsa and extra sour cream on top and it was absolutely delicious!!

Loved it.  This recipe really worked for us.. and we've made it often.
I found that the recipe didn't fill the tortillas, so I've doubled mixture without doubling the tortillas.
When cooking the chicken, I add taco seasoning for more flavor.  We always use non-fat or less fat, depending on product, it's a matter of personal taste.
Perfect for a quick meal, unexpected company and leftovers.  It's a good one.

This was just an "okay" recipe.  Out of the 6 of us eating it, 2 wouldn't finish, 1 was "don't really like the mushrooms" and the other 3 of us were just blah about it.  The concept is okay, but the cream of mushroom soup needs to be revamped with something else more suited to chicken enchiladas.

Great Recipe!  I used reduced fat sour cream, low-fat cheddar and 1 tsp. of butter because YIKES on the fat & calories.  I also seasoned my chicken breast with poultry seasoning and grilled it on my George Foreman.  We will make this often.

I love this recipe!  The only thing that I added along with some of the other suggestions is...cottage cheese to the chicken and sour cream and brown onions or frozen & chopped, pitted and sliced olives.  Then I make a sauce...I take one can of green enchilada sauce , empty it in a skillet and heat over medium.Then I add water to the empty can about 1/2 water...then I add to the water, 2-3 Tbsp of flour and salt to taste.  I stir it til all lumps are gone.  Add it to the green sauce and mix.  When its hot ...pour it over the Enchiladas!  Thanks Steph!

This enchilada recipe is really good. I made minor changes like boiling and shredding the chicken and added a bit more spice like cayenne pepper. I also doubled the recipe because I had way more chicken to work with. Overall this is a very tasty recipe that I will be making again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

First time I tried this it was a bit bland, but it's very easy to add some extra flavor.  Instead of the can of green chiles, try chopping up one or two fresh red chiles and adding those to the butter instead.  They add a slight bit of heat and some much needed color to the dish.  I didn't have sour cream on hand, so instead of 1/4 cup of milk, I just used 1/2 cup of milk... turned out just fine, and cut on the richness a bit.  Also, if you have a packet of taco seasoning on hand, throw a teaspoon or so into the sauce to add a bit of color.  I also added some tabasco into the sauce.  After it came out of the oven, I topped it with some chopped up tomatoes and served it with green taco sauce.  Yummy!  I usually hate leftovers, but I look forward to eating this the next day.  A definite crowd pleaser.

Ok, to start out, do not think that this is anything close to real Mexican food, or even something you'll find in many Mexican resutrants (Americanized or otherwise). I have been trying to get this receipe for a long time because I like it, and its a nice alternative (not replacement) to the traditional enchilada recipe that I have. I did, of course, make some changes. I shredded the chicken, well actually boiled it until it fell apart esentially (getting closer to authentic). Then I also used corn tortillas for my boyfriend (born and raised in Jalisco, Meixco) and flour for myself. I liked the flour better, but corn is traditionally used. I make mine seperatley, more like in a resurant (not all toughter in a big dish), by filling three or four enchiladas on a plate, pouring some of the sauce on top, covering with cheese and putting them in the oven, much quicker, and no leftovers for days, as sauce can be frozen. Also, a must to keep it all from turning into a sloppy mess, or the tortillas from breaking when being rolled, each one needs to be fried on each side just long enough to make it pliable, but not crispy, and then rolled quickly, you can't fry all the tortillas and then fill them. It has to be one at a time, and it usually helps to have someone frying and someone filling, if possible. I made the sacue alot thinner with milk so I would have enough to go on top (think Mexican resturant, usually alot of sauce over the top too), and it does dry out a bit in the oven. All

These were very good...husband loved them.  Because I have kids who think onions are, "bad for you" in many recipes including this one, I only add onion and in this case, the green chilies, to half.  Keeps everybody happy without compromising taste!  Enjoy this one..it's a keeper.

I was a bit disappointed in these.  I got complaints that they were mushy and tasted more like a casserole than regular enchiladas.  Also, the flour tortillas got soggy.  I don't know if I'll be making these again.

This was pretty good. My husband said it was bland, but I enjoyed it and my picky 2 year old gobbled it up. I used Monteray Jack cheese instead of Chedar and doubled up on the cheese. I think next time I make it, I will try it with mock crab meat instead of chicken.

This recipe is excellent.  After making this, my husband told me my chicken enchiladas were better than granny's and my mom said I was the best cook in the family.  I always double the recipe and add extra chicken and extra cheese.  Instead of buying cooked chicken, I buy 1.5 lb. of chick breast strips, bake or grill them and then cube the meat.  It gives the dish more texture and it's so easy.  I also used 1 can of crm of mushroom and 1 can crm of chick soup, a pinch of cumin and a dash of chili powder.  A definite winner...YUM YUM!!

I made this in advance with no problems. The tortillas are not mushy and it held up very well. However, I was not extremely pleased with the taste--but I think that was my fault. Instead of cutting up and seasoning my own chicken breast, I used a box of fully cooked diced chicken (Tyson's, I think). I neglected to season it so when you actually bit into the enchilada, it was a tad bland. The sauce was magnificent and had I seasoned the chicken, the whole meal would have been superb.
I will probaly make this again, next time using my own chicken.

My family and I thought this was a great recipe.  The only thing I changed was that I used fresh garlic and instead of using the milk at the end I used salsa. It turned out wonderfully! This is a recipe that I will use again for sure. Thanks!

Outstanding.
I used corn tortillas (fried for 3 seconds on each side in vegetable oil, then patted dry in paper towels)instead of flour, Mrs. Renfros Green Salsa (hot) instead of diced green chili peppers.

This was excellent--I also used a little cumin and chili powder in the sauce.  I found, too, that the amount of filling is inadequate for 6 enchiladas--I like mine overstuffed, I guess.  I should also say that I normally steer clear of recipes that have ingredients like canned soup, etc. because I like making things from scratch.  In the past, these types of recipes have often tasted like a step above frozen dinners.  But this one is different.  I made these last night for a casual dinner party and everyone loved them!  I will definitely make these again!

I just took mine out of the oven. I also used cream of chicken instead of mushroom. They are delicious. I did add the 1/4 teas. of cumin, 1/2 teas. of onion powder and 1/8 teas. of chili powder. I also added more cheese on the top. Thanks, Joyln

Sweet Jesus, this is not only the best recipie so far on the site, but probably the best dish I've ever made.  As suggested, I used enchilada sauce in place of the milk, cream of chicken in place of cream of mushroom, and added 1/8 tsp. each of cumin and chili powder to sauce to kick it up a notch.  This was awesome - I loved it, my husband loved it - I was afraid to feed it to my 13 month old, though - too spicy?  My hubby wanted to take the leftovers to work the next day to impress his buddies - what a compliment!  I couldn't get over how EASY it was - will serve for company right away.  Thanks so much for this recipie.  Delicious!

What a great recipe.  My husband raved to everyone about it.  I substituted low fat cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom and it still tasted rich & creamy. I served it with a tossed salad with tortilla chip pieces in it and added a little salsa to some ranch dressing. A great & quick meal.

My sister, her 4 year old grandson, my daughter and her friend from college, and my son who is a HS senior were all here for dinner last night.  This was fabulous and all commented it should be a "keeper".  I used frozen chicken meat which made it even easier.  Luckily I had doubled the recipe so even have leftovers!!!!

This is an excellent recipe. Since several of us have to be gluten-free, I had to modify the recipe a bit. I used corn tortillas and made my own gluten-free cream of celery soup (I was out of mushrooms). I loved the way it turned out! Even my picky eater wanted seconds! I highly recommend trying it with Cream of Celery. It made a great twist to it.

I followed the recipe closely - the only change was chicken soup instead of mushroom because that's all I had. I also skipped the milk, replacing it with salsa as others recommended.  Even at that, we found it still lacked some oomph so I served it with good dollops of more salsa on top and that made it really really good.  I'd make this again with these changes.

Excellent.  Got 4 enchiladas out of this while using 8" tortillas and a single, mutantly-large chicken breast.  Substituted a couple of chipotles in adobo sauce for the green chiles, added a couple of shakes of generic red pepper flakes while cooking the chicken, and added a couple of sliced white mushrooms to the sauce while cooking that.  Definitely going to be making this one again.

I have made this recipe a number of times and my husband and I love it! Since I've made it so often, I've changed a few things - but even the basic recipe is great.

I've added seasoning to the chicken, such as red pepper flakes, garlic salt, or some other spices. I've also substituted lighter ingredients, such as 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, fat free sour cream, and cheese made from 2% milk. They still taste great!

I have now made this recipe twice. The first time all I added was some cream cheese and I served just the chicken base over baked potatoes at a camping event. The hungry campers were very happy! The second I had to take more liberties due to a lack of ingredients. I added salsa instead of chilis, chili powder, oregano, and cream of chicken. I plan to serve it over mashed potatoes again. Very yummy!

This recipe is great as is.  I almost never have canned green chiles on hand however, so I'll add a can of Rotel or some salsa to spice it up instead.  It's my favorite go to recipe for leftover chicken . . . and my chicken hating husband never complains about having chicken two nights in a row!!!

They were alright.  Certainly not anywhere near the best.  It's an easy recipe to throw together, but I was not wowed.

Great EASY recipe.  Always looking for ideas for work-night recipes.  Something that can be thrown together quickly or ahead of time.  I make this recipe whenever a friend or neighbor needs a little help.  I have gotten rave reviews every time.  My only tip is TRIPLE up on the cheese; DOUBLE up on everything else.  This recipe (as it's listed above) makes a relatively small amount, at least for my family.  I also do 1/2 SHARP cheddar, 1/2 white cheese (Montery, Queso Blanco, Farmers, etc).  Enjoy!!

I made this recipe as written and it turned out great!  It was quick, easy and a great way to use leftover chicken!  I am going to take a risk and try it with seasoned ground turkey.  Wish me luck! :)

Made this for the first time tonight for my fiance and I! Added black beans on the side.
Recipe is absolutely easy, and yummy!  It took me about an hour to make. I didn't see anywhere mentioned that your chicken should be precooked... I wish that woud have been mentioned. Other than so, it is super easy and convinient. Love it!

Delish. I made many of the adjustments as others did....added cumin, and chili powder.  replaced the milk with medium enchilada sauce.  My husband loved them.  Definitely a keeper.

Made this for dinner last night and it was a HUGE hit! Added it to my families recipe book for future fixin's ;)

I made a few adjustments, I doubled the recipe for one and used boneless chicken thighs, boiled, cooled and then shredded the meat, added another 4 ounce can of diced chilies. I also made it more like a casserole instead of rolling them like enchiladas... first I tore up some tortillas in big strips and put a layer on the bottom then a layer of the chicken mixture, another layer of tortillas and then topped them with the prepared sauce and covered with shredded colby cheese and black olives.

Next time I plan to fix the recipe I am going to do at least another layer of each meaning I'd need to times the recipe by at least 4. 

Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe! 
God bless!

My family doesn't like onions or green chilis so I made this without them and my family still loved it. My 15 yr old son almost ate himself sick on these. Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely be making these again.

This is the best go to recipe.  I buy a rotisserie chicken and save time and add flavor but other than that I don't change a thing.  It really easy and delicious! Probably my favorite recipe on this site.

Followed the directions exactly except I added a chopped fresh jalapeno (I sauteed it with the onion). Used frozen, leftover chicken from leg quarters. So good, family ate it all up.

I thought it sounded odd to use cream of mushroom for enchiladas but figured I'd give the recipe a chance and make it as directed since it has so many high reviews. It really is delicious!

This was pretty easy to make, but the flavor was definitely a disappointment. I followed the instructions other than using corn tortillas instead of flour (which I think improves the final product). Everything came out moist and creamy, but just had surprisingly little flavor. If I can figure out what it's missing I'll try it again, as the ease of preparation and the final texture were both satisfactory.

There was way too much sauce for this recipe. I would have cut the sauce in half, and probably added a little more cheese.

I made this recipe just as it called for and they were great! My husband and I loved the green chilies and creaminess of the sauce. And they flour tortillas has a great taste and held together really well. Will be making these again.

YUMMY. I thought this recipe was great for an Americanized chicken enchilada. I gave it more of an authentic taste by swapping out the milk for a can of enchilada sauce! I think this dish would of been way to creamy with the milk seeing that it uses a whole can of cream of mushroom. I also added some grounded cayenne pepper to the sauce. And also the way I cooked the chicken added to the dish. I quickly seared boneless chicken breast tenders on a skillet using about a tablespoon of coconut oil.  And then pull the chicken when it's finished cooking.

This recipe is fab.  The name is a bit misleading because it's not really enchiladas but more like a wet burrito.  But - who cares?  You can call it monkey face rodeo clown stuff and that's okay with me - it's still delish.  Yum-O.

I made this recipe exactly as it says except I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom.  I also used yellow onion instead of green.  It turned out amazing!  My boyfriend said that the enchiladas tasted better than most restaurant enchiladas!  I will definitely make this again!

Love this recipe and have made it several times. I used to look for the "burrito" comment to find it before creating an account so I could save it. Regardless how you classify it, these are good!  My oldest son's favorite, as a matter of fact. As others have noted, double the sauce and you won't be disappointed.

I have made this recipe many times also. The changes I have made are: adding fajita seasoning to the chicken while cooking, and adding oregano and parsley to the sauce. I also used cream instead of milk  for a richer taste but did add a small amount of milk also. About 5-10 min before the dish is done, I top with salsa and cheese. Tastes delicious!!

Excellent recipe. I have a 2 yr old and one yr old that are incredibly picky so recipes like this w a robust sauce are great for hiding healthy things in - I spread the tortillas w refried beans (search all recipes for Refried Beans Without the Refry) and puréed kale (adds some color, but the taste disappears in the flavor of the sauce). I shredded a zucchini and mixed it in w the chicken filling (be sure to squeeze the excess water out first). I doubled the recipe and added a packet of taco mix. AWESOME!  Freezes well.

Very good for comfort food enchiladas! I sauteed onion in olive oil, added garlic powder, chili powder and cumin. Added 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken. Then added shredded chicken (rotisserie), bell pepper, 1 can diced tomatoes, sour cream, and half of the grated cheese. 
Rolled it up in flour tortillas and topped with a can of green enchilada sauce and the remainder grated cheese. Phenomenal!

Okay, yes, this technically really is "smothered chicken burritos" but who cares! My husband, who is the pickiest eater I have ever met, LOVED IT! Like others, I doubled the sauce and it was perfect! Some people suggested seasoning the chicken with taco seasoning. I considered this but thought it would be too salty...so I just seasoned the chicken with a little salt, pepper, jamaican jerk seasoning, and some Mrs. Dash Herb and Garlic. I'll DEFINITELY will be making this recipe again. Very easy and very good!

This is sooo yummy!  I did do a little revamping along the way because I thought for sure it would be a little bland.  Boy was I wrong.  I did double the sauce recipe and added about 1/4 cup tace sauce and cooked my chicken breast with a little fajita season ,cumin and garlic powder as one other member did to just give it a little added flavor, and topped with black olive slices along with the cheese and green onion.  
 My family loved it.  I now have a little something different as a quick easy go to recipe.

Prepared this tonight. I used Fat Free sour cream. Also used low carb tortillas to lighten things up. This was delicious. My wife thinks I'm 'the bomb' now.

This was the most flavorful enchilada recipe I have EVER made.   I didn't change a thing about the ingredients and I'm so happy I didn't!  I also Loved that it was a "white" sauce instead of red and I plan to make this over and over again.  Thanks so much for sharing!

The cottage cheese part intriqued me so that is why I tried this recipe.  I did not use the soup, used rotissere chicken, and my own spice mix. The taste was spot on - the texture of the cheese sauce was not what I expected.  If I try this again, I would use cream of chicken as others have suggested.

A wonderful recipe and one of my families favorites.  I have been making a similar recipe for years using browned ground beef instead of chicken.  Instead of green onions, I saute chopped onions in butter along with a teaspoon of chile powder.  I then add the rest of the sauce ingredients.  I top the enchiladas with chopped black olives and bake in the microwave (especially in the summer).  Next time I make this, it will be with chicken!

Needed more flavor. I think I will try using cream of chicken instead of the mushroom and add a few more spices. Worth another try.

These were quick, easy, and tasty!

I followed the recipe except subbed fat free or low fat items (margarine instead of butter, ff sour cream, low fat chedar cheese, ff milk, healthy request cream of mushroom soup) and it was still excellent.  

My local grocery store had a deal last week and I ended up with a free package of cooked, seasoned, shredded chicken, knowing I could find SOMETHING to do with it...this was it!

I took a reviewers advice and used corn instead of flour tortillas...I thought the flour ones would turn to mush.  Unfortunately, I did not follow the advice about dipping them in warm oil (I think that's what it was) to make them more flexible...if you're using corn tortillas and don't want this to end up like a casserole, then don't skip that step.  If you DO skip that step (or just don't have time, like me) I would suggest layering the tortillas and chicken mixture almost like a lasagna.  That's not how I started mine out, but with all the tortilla's breaking (corn tortillas just don't bend very well when you roll them), I had to lay some down flat over the top before dumping the sauce over it.  It was completely fine, but overall probably not as pretty as it could have been...but once the sauce covers it, you can't really see it anyway.

Inexpensive, quick, tasty, and totally modifiable to be a little more low-cal.  Perfect.  And if you don't 'do' cream of mushroom soup, I'm betting cream of chicken would work almost as well.

I made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe to the T and it was just ok. Not enough flavor or sauce. The second time I doubled the sauce and I cooked the cubed chicken in chili verde sauce before adding it to the sauce. AMAZING. Got so many compliments. I've been looking for the perfect white chicken enchiladas and this is my 5th recipe and I finally got it!!! Thanks so much

I have made this recipe a few times and it is delicious. I do the following:
1.) use corn tortillas, spray Pam on them, put them on very hot skillet for 10 secs on each side, then fill with the filling. 2.) VITAL: cover the bottom of the casserole dish with a tiny layer of the sauce mixture (used for topping the enchiladas) before laying them down..otherwise the tortillas dont get sauce on them on the bottom and they become chewy/weird texture!

What a great recipe!  I read a few reviews and decided to use Red Enchilada Sauce instead of milk.  I have a family member who doesn't like cheese, so I only added cheese to top off a few of the enchiladas.  It was so good, I didn't even care about not having cheese inside.  Thank you for this recipe!!!  Easy and fun to make!

I replace the cream of mushroom with extra sour cream, green chile salsa, and some cream cheese, then add about 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro. Top with tomatoes, avocados, and left over cilantro - delicious!

better than I expected.  thought cr of mushroom soup was a weird ingredient but it worked.  added some taco seasoning to the chicken and let it slow cook in the crock pot until it could be shredded and it was a wonderful filling.  Will make again.

I will highly recommend this recipe!  Making chicken enchiladas with white sauce and with flour tortillas seems to be traditional in the Mexican restaurants in San Antonio, TX. where I eat as often as I can.

This was very very tasty and I will make it again! I accidentally grabbed cream of mushroom with roasted garlic in it at the store, but I think the extra garlic made this tastier than it would have been without it. Next time I will be adding more cheese and using 6 inch tortillas.

Thank you for a great recipe! Who cares about how authentic it is ... this is really good! The first time I made it as stated by the submitter and the second time I jazzed it up with more seasonings and a little red and green pepper for a little crunch. Either way it's really good, so thank you very much!

Very good. Family loves it.  I added boiled potatoes to make it a little more authentic.  I also boiled 6 chicken breasts in sea salt, garlic, cummin, red pepper flakes and onion flakes.  Used some of the juice from the chicken to add flavor after chicken is shredded.  Add small cube shaped potatoes to shredded chicken.  Added taco seasoning to meat and potatoes then added half of the soups, sour cream, some of the cheese and milk until all coated and heated.  Used flour shells (they do roll easier) I have also used corn (my favorite) but corn is to be used when I have more time.  Filled shells then poored rest of soup mixture and layered it with lots of lots of cheese.
Very very good.  I have never had left overs.

My family loves this recipe. I just thought I would add that i use corn tortilla and I never use oil to make them pliable.  I just use a nonstick skillet and heat it just like you would with oil but I do not put in the oil. I heat it on high for a few seconds then flip it over and heat it a couple of seconds on the other side-- just heating them up makes them pliable.

This was soooo yummy. I used whole wheat/low fat ingredients where necessary (still came out fantastic!), and I also used "Slow Cooker Cilantro Lime Chicken" (recipe on this site) for the filling. Everything cooked up bubbly, creamy, and delicious. And, relatively guilt-free thanks to my smart substitutions. 

However, next time, I think I would leave out the cream mixture from the filling--while it was tasty, I felt it detracted from the already yummy chicken I was using. But, if you're using plain old rotisserie or baked chicken as your filling, definitely keep the cream mixture in the filling for some taste, and maybe add some taco seasoning for a little kick. Otherwise, the overwhelming taste will be "cream" and not "Mexican spice." 

Will definitely make this again, and soon!

I would only give 3 stars, but my husband and son thought it was 5.  I thought it was a bit bland, but still very good with a little salt and pepper.  I think next time I would double the sauce and cheese.

I follow this recipe pretty closely, only I add a can of either red enchilada sauce or rotel the bottom of the baking dish.  The sauce adds a really nice punch to the enchiladas.  One of our favorites that I’ve made for a few years now.  It’s a great dinner anytime of the year, even around the pool in the summer!

Our family made multiple batches of this for my brother's rehearsal dinner (Fiesta Themed).  It was delicious.  We heard rave reviews all night.  I continue to make this for my family and couldn't be happier.  My husband likes a "crunch" on his, so tops it with crushed tortilla chips.

Whenever my extended family comes they request these. Or if I go home and visit my parents, they request these. Just can't get enough. I've tried modifying in several ways: adding beans, topping with green sauce, but the recipe as-is is always the best.

These were pretty good even though I was worried about the richness of the cheese sause. I thought that it would be too overpowering. The only thing I might rethink next time is cooking the chicken/spices/onion/garlic/peppers together alone. Then drizzle the cheese sauce in the tortillas on the chicken mix. This way I can control the sodium/chicken/cheese ratio better. You can't tast the other flavors that well if there is too much sauce. I was in a hurry and used a store bought roasted chicken, but they still took a while to assemble. Pair these with some good home made salsa since I still wanted some sort of tomato flavor.

It is a great recipe. I did modify some based on other reviews. For example I added some chili powder, cumin, and cayenne (for an extra kick) plus I added salsa to the second portion of the sauce. They turned out awesome. I will be making these again for sure!

This filling was barely enough for 4 tortillas.  Otherwise, this was a flavorful and different way for us to do enchiladas.

This was an amazing recipe to make so easy but came out just like restaurant stile.  My husband loved it.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was adding a small green bell pepper to the mix.  I sauteed it with the onion. It was amazing.  will do again.  Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed these enchiladas, as did my picky husband!  Only change is that I used cream of golden mushroom because it's all I had, but it was delish.  The tortillas were a bit chewy the first day (probably why you're supposed to use corn), but heated up well in the skillet for left-overs.

Ohhhh myyyy goodness. These are AMAZING! Every single person that I have ever made these for BEGS for the recipe. I add more diced green chiles just cause I like them a lot, but other than that I follow the recipe. YUM. Just thinking about this makes me want to make them tonight!! Try them out! You have nothing to lose!

My whole family loved this! I made some of the modifications suggested in earlier reviews as well as a few of my own. I boiled the chicken breasts (5) with taco seasoning and cilantro then shredded it, doubled  all the other ingredients. Used Hot chiles, 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of chicken/mushroom. Used Chipotle sour cream, used authentic Mexican cheese mix by (I used 1 full cup of cheese in my chicken mix--I also used fresh garlic that I sauteed with the green onions and mixed in additional cilantro and taco seasoning into the enchilada filling. I used 1/4 salsa and 1/4 cup of milk in the sauce. I also used corn tortillas and added another full cup of cheese on top. This made about 15 enchiladas. This recipe is a new addition to my monthly rotation! Superb!

Delicious!!  I substituted sweet onion for the green onion and added extra cheese and topped with black olives.  I also forgot to by the soup but had Nacho Cheese Soup on hand so I used it instead and it was equally delicious.  This is a regular addition to my weekly menus.  We serve it with corn and Spanish Rice.  I'm going to try the Black Bean Corn Salsa from this site which I'm sure will be fantastic.

I just made these enchiladas for dinner and did not change a thing.  I doubled the recipe but wished I only add one can of diced peppers as it was too spicy for the kids (6 & 10).  However, DH and I loved them and we will fight for leftovers tomorrow.

I'm giving this 5 stars only because the hubby and kids loved this recipe. It also was so simple and quick to put together.   Me not so much....I prefer a red sauce and not a fan of 'can of anything' soups.  Made the dish up and left the house for a meeting and 3 people ate the whole 9 x 13 pan...leaving me only a quarter of an enchilada....guess they really liked them!

Thought this recipe was very good!!!  4star based on recipe as is.  I hate when people make a ton of changes and then rate it based on what they have done.  The only changes that I made (just personal preference) was I used cream of chicken, a small amount of sour cream and philadelphia sante fe cooking cream mixed together.  I thought this was a great flavor combo!!!

Huge favorite with my family. Moved away from home without mom's recipe for "white enchiladas". This was the perfect substitute. I always make extra sauce because it is never enough to cover the whole pan. If I don't, I end up with crispy/burnt tortillas on the edges. Enjoy!

My husband and I love these! I mix mild green enchilada sauce with golden mushroom soup and cheese soup and it makes a really rich sauce! I haven't added sour cream or the diced chiles the past few times I've made this, but only because I didn't have any. We also use corn tortillas instead of flour because it's waaaay better that way, the corn really sets off the flavors! Will make again and again! =)

I've made this several times now for my boyfriend and I and we both love it!  The only changes I made to the recipe were using diced fresh jalapeños and green bell pepper (I threw them in with some diced sweet onion garlic and butter for sautéing together) Instead of garlic powder i used minced and I use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom.  Yum!

These were great, my whole family loved them!  I did cut the chiles down a bit and I added some green enchilada sauce.  I seasoned the chicken with half a packet of chicken taco seasoning.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I grew up having these enchiladas this way and have always LOVED them. I can't believe how many people are making so many changes and complaining about them. I don't like corn tortillas so I love these this way. Creamy, flour tortillas and all. Enchilada/burrito whatever you want to call them they are tasty.

I used small corn tortillas to make these enchiladas. But no one in the house cared for the texture. I also used cream of chicken, as most in house house do not like mushroom flavors. The filling was a little bland so next time we will add more spices to it. Overall, it was a good base recipe. We will try this again. Thanks.

Wonderful and very filling!  Whole family liked it.  I did tweak it a bit by adding some taco seasoning to the sauce to give it a bit more kick.  I didn't have green onion or green chilies but found that diced onion and pureed green pepper worked as good substitutes.

This is the first time that my husband had not only seconds, but asked if I would be mad if he finished them off.  I was shocked, it was something I wasn't sure he'd eat.  the kids loved it too.  i made it as directed.  It was great.  I will definately make this again.

Really good! I used 7 inch low-carb tortillas (saving a BUNCH of calories) and Jack cheese instead of Cheddar. Everything else I kept the same. Lots of yummy gooey filling, this will go in my monthly rotation. Served with Mexican rice.

This recipe was pretty good. I didn't have any sour cream so I added a little bit of lowfat plain Greek yogurt. This added great flavor and it tasted just like sour cream.  I did follow the advice from a reviewer by adding taco seasoning to the chicken.  This gave it that Mexican taste, I cant imagine how it would taste without the seasoning. I used corn tortillas instead of flour. I also added some chopped tomatoes and salsa on top when it was done baking.

With a few little changes for my picky family this is a keeper! I used cream of chicken soup, and cut out the can of chiles. I also used corn tortilas. And 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the sauce. Next time I will do a whole cup. Turned out great!

Really Good :) The only thing Id change is, since I prefer things on the spicier side, I think it'd be good to marinate the chicken in hot sauce and bake it in the oven, and then add it to the sauce mix. It'd give it a nice bite, otherwise I find this recipe a bit on the bland side.

YUMMY!  Really easy and delicious.  Basically followed the directions but added more cheese on top and a little crushed red pepper in the chicken mix for a little extra heat. Fresh salsa on the side is a plus. Will definately make this again. Both kids and hubby loved it!

this wasnt very good at all.  i dont usually like to use any kind of canned soups in recipes but they do tend to be the cheaper and easy, but these were too mushy not authentic tasting at all, not worth the waste of other ingredients it called for. i wouldnt recommend this to anyone. will not make again.

These are AMAZING, and I rarely say that when rating recipes.  The only thing I did different was I added one diced roma tomato to the chicken mixture.  I also used all low-fat ingredients when making the recipe.  For the chicken, I took one large breast and cubed it and then sauteed it in olive oil spray with garlic powder, a dash of cumin, and crazy salt.  I plan to make these many more times!

There are many varieties of enchiladas; these are probably closest to an Enchilada Suiza. The word "enchilada" (from "enchilar") has more to do with the chili sauce, not the type of tortilla used. Corn tortillas are preferable and more traditional, but not required. I made these with whole wheat tortillas, because I'm watching my diet. Heating the tortillas will make them more malleable; that's what I'm accustomed to doing with my tortillas, when I have to roll them. You can also put them in the oven, wrapped in tin foil, for a few minutes to warm them up (as a last resort, use the microwave). I whisked the cheese into the 1/4 sauce before adding the chicken so it was smooth, used jalapenos instead of green chilies, used minced garlic instead of powdered, pulled my chicken instead of cubing it (I like the texture better), and used reduced fat mexican cheese as well as low fat sour cream. Turned out just fine. Thanks for the recipe!

These might have been better if I used Cream of Chicken soup. They were a bit bland... needed some salt or something. Did not really taste like chicken enchiladas. Surprised at the ratings, but I am also used to real TexMex... and for anyone looking for anything like that, this isn't the recipe.

LOVED this recipe! Quick to prepare. My boyfriend likes things spicey so I added canned chipoltle peppers to half of them (too hot for me!). I also sprinkled with black beans that I cooked from the dried form (gave them a little interest). I think I ended up using twice as much cheese that it called for, but the recipe is fine the way it is. Yummy!

First off i do not think that people should rate a recipe because of authenticity. You rate on how well you think the taste is! This is a wonderful recipe that you can use as is or add as much or as little spice/filling as you want. I added real garlic and seasoned some chicken breast that i baked before shredding which gave it added flavor! Thank you for a wonderful starter recipe .

I made the recipe exactly as is, and it turned out pretty good. If I decide to make these again, I will make some changes - like adding salt and pepper to the soup/sour cream mixture, and using corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. I would also bake for 25 minutes, THEN put the cheese on top and bake for 10 more minutes.

Excellent recipe! Not too spicy, is flavorful and creamy. I would use smaller tortilla shells as there didn't seem to be enough filling for 6 large ones. We ended up with 4. I substituted Cream of Chicken and added just a little fresh chopped tomato to the filling. I like the suggestion to add red peppers so will try that next time.

Pretty good with enchilada sauce.  Without the sauce, it's very bland.  I wish that I had salted my chicken before I cooked it.  I think that would have helped a lot.  I also found a different recipe where you make a roux out of butter, flour, sour cream, and green chilies.  I threw this recipe out of my box.  The recipe that uses a roux sour cream sauce is soooooo much better.  It taste authenic.  Google simply sour cream enchilada and it pops right up first thing.  I also used McCormick's enchilada sauce mix and added 1/2 tsp coco powder. Yum!

We thought these were surprisingly good. I made half of the enchiladas with canned white beans and the other half with canned chicken. Since I used beans, I subbed cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom soup in order to get more chicken flavor. They were pretty good on their own, but the addition of taco sauce and sour cream made them more flavorful.

Great recipe.  I forgot to put the milk in the sauce but I doubled it so I had more than enough.  I used Authentic Mexican cheese by craft and it came out super creamy (I'm not sure if that had an affect on the creaminess or not).

These are excellent! I actually put the green chilis in a food proccesor so they were more of a sauce than chunks. This is a keeper! Very flavorful and tasty. I doubled the recipe, followed it exactly, and I wouldn't change anything.

After the adjustments I made, I gave a five star rating. Here's what I did. For the chicken, I marinated it in lime juice and garlic/onion powder, then grilled it. Instead of the cream of mushroom soup I opted for half a can of cheddar cheese soup mix, half a can of cream of chicken soup, and a can of Rotel ( which took care of the green chiles, tomato, and peppers). I kept the sour cream, omitted the milk. Topped them off with the cheese sauce mixture and cheddar cheese. They turned out heavenly! My family loved them and the hubby says it's his new Fav! We finished this meal off with a black bean, corn, and rotel mixture and mexican rice! Deliciouso*

A keeper! I couldn't rate it 5 stars because I couldn't follow recipe exactly (I didn't have all the ingredients and didn't realize until I was already started), but hubby liked it as I made it. No green onions, no garlic powder, I used corn instead of flour tortillas and I doubled the sauce recipe. I also used the mexican blend of shredded cheese (all I had). I can't wait to try this recipe as written, but either way, it's a keeper!

I added some jalapenos to spice them up; they aren't spicy as written. I also seasoned my chicken with 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning, which made all the difference.

Great recipe as is (definitely worthy of 5 stars), but I think it's even better if you make the following changes... First, sautee a finely chopped jalapeno with the onion. Second,use the larger (7 oz) can of green chiles. Third, use 2C of chicken and half of the sauce with it. Fourth, if you don't want the dish to be soggy use CORN tortillas. Finally, add a can of green enchilada sauce with the other half of the sauce and use this to top the enchiladas. YUM!

Excellent family meal! I did adjust some: I substituted with yellow onions; Used 2 cans of the chicken breast meat from Costco (well drained); Mexican blend shredded cheese; White corn tortillas (10), heated for a few seconds in a lightly oiled pan to soften; Enchilada sauce instead of milk. Made "Best Spanish Rice" on the side. Hubby was raving about it and went in for seconds! DELISH!

Yummy.  I used the Canasta uncooked flour tortillas and warmed them before stuffing.  I also needed to add a little spice to the chicken mixture, but I rate as 5 star because the recipe is delicious!  And the hubby loved it, too! ... and that is really saying something!

This is a great recipe. I've made a similar recipe before using the soup mixture inside only and putting a red sauce on the outside, also very good. I will say not using the red sauce and using non-stick spray in the dish seemed to cut down on the leftover next day soggy tortillas.

I did a few things differently. I cooked the chicken with 1/2 pack of taco mix. I used a can of enchiladas sauce in place of the sour cream, and I added some salsa. With a recipe like this, your measurements don't have to be exact, just taste as you go. I also used cream of chicken instead of mushroom. Next time I will add some onion and red and green peppers for a little more flavour and colour.

Turned out great! I used corn tortillas and I made it more kid friendly so no green chiles or green onions. Cooked white onions with the chicken and added 1/2 package of taco seasoning. I thought the sauce was a little bland so I added 1/4 can of enchilada sauce instead of milk and 1 teaspoon garlic. Toped our side of the pan with mushrooms & olives and the kids side I kept plain! The sauce was creamy & zesty! Served with homemade Guac & chips! Its a keeper!

This was great! I love to read what others change about it, so it made it better!  I like others used CORN tortillas, It gives it a better texture, in my opinion.  I also used a yellow onion instead of the green. I used fresh chopped garlic instead of powder. I also added one can of Creme of chicken soup, and it made a lot creamier!  I shredded the chicken instead of cutting it in cubes. It turned out great!  everyone in my family LOVED it!

Amazing, enough said. Just a suggestion, if you can find them use Tortilla Land uncooked tortilla's. We find them at Costco and they are the best! We also found that if you use the stuffing mixture top with a mexican cheese blend heat in the oven it makes a great chip dip for parties!

Great recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I now cook my chicken in the slow cooker with 1 can of tomato sauce & 2 cups of water w/seasonings added.  After about 3 hours chicken is very tender and I then shred.  After rolling the enchiladas I use the left over sauce from the slow cooker and pour over enchiladas.  Depending on how chicken is, I may pour some on after shredding.  Always comes out tender, juicy, and with lots less heartburn.

Very easy and fast.  Kinda bland, but with your own tweaking, it can be very good!  I will make again because its a great way to use up leftover chicken (which I always have a lot of).

I made this recipe exactly as stated with the exception of using corn tortillas instead of flour because I'm not that fond of flour tortillas.  This is DEFINITELY a keeper!  Delicious!  The only thing I might change for the next time is adding two cans of green chilies instead of one.  I might also add some enchilada sauce too, but it is FABULOUS as posted.

These were an instant hit with my family. They have moved to the list of favorite meals. I didn't measure out my chicken very well and I think I ended up with about 1 1/2 times the chicken I should have..but everything mixed together fine and they turned out WONDERFUL. I have to make a double batch next time. We fought over the last one.

Family favorite. I put the glass dish in the oven for a minuted while it's heating up and grease the dish with butter first. I also used cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom soup. Also for the sauce I use a bit more milk to ensure there's plenty of sauce. MMMM good!

Just made for dinner, and it's yummy! I used more chicken, cheese, green onion, and sour cream, but kept everything else the same. When making it, it  didn't seem like there would be enough filling or sauce, but after baking it turned out great and wasn't soggy at all. Used burrito size flour tortillas. I think it would be good with sliced black olives, sliced fresh tomato, and green onion on top of the cheese, which we'll try next time.  We all agreed to add more seasonings next time, because we like our food a bit more spicy. I cooked it for 40 minutes. Definitely make again! Obviously with all the changes people made it's a recipe that can be suited to your own tastes or what you have on hand. It's the best chicken enchilada recipe I've ever made.

I'v been making these for years and not only does my family love them, but everyone we've made them for. I usually just buy a rotisserie chicken and cut it up, and occasionally saute mushrooms along with the green onions. . .also I substitute cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom.

Instead of using green onions and green chilies, I used a green bell pepper and sweet onion.  It came out great and the balance of flavors was awesome!  This is a favorite!

I have made this recipe several times. It tastes wonderful and I usually do not like chicken enchiladas. I have made a couple of changes only because I like lots of topping on my enchiladas. I make sure they are well covered.

This was a great recipe, however it was not spicy enough for me, so I added some jalapenos and half of a white onion. I also like tomatos so I added that as well...

Loved it!!  I love mexican food and I thought this was great. Took a few suggestions of others and used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, used corn tortillas, and omitted the milk and used salsa.  Great!! Thanks

Very good as is, but great with changes from other users. I made more of the "sauce," using 3/4 can of cream of chicken and 3/4 can of nacho cheese soup. I used green salsa (Salsa Lisa brand with tomatillo and green chiles) so it wouldn't be too hot. It ended up being on the mild side, but very very good. I also like the texture of shredded chicken instead of cubed. 2 breasts were perfect for 6 enchiladas.

So good! Not very spicy so increase the chiles if you want more spice. Really really good though.

I didn't care for this recipe much.  It is a Mexican dish with no distinctive seasoning.  I added chicken taco seasoning to the sauce and it was better, but still just okay.

Great recipe! My whole family loved this dish. I used american cheese, minced garlic, and canned chicken because that is what I had. Everything else was according to the original recipe. It turned out delicious! Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will be making this often.

My family LOVES these! I followed some of the suggestion of "Bethyesque" and the results are great. I use 1/3 c. green bell pepper, 2 oz. green chiles, 2 oz. diced jalapenos, and the recommended amt. of green onions. Also added 1/4 can of condensed chicken soup to the original recipe, and used Mexican 4 cheese blend in place of the cheddar. 

It doesn't hurt to season this up a bit with cumin, chile powder, a little extra garlic powder, etc., but that's the best part, this can be adapted to suit any tastes. We like ours spicy!!!!

Were very easy to make. I took the advise of others and doubled the sauce. I had way to much. I will stick to recipe next time. I may add some queso over the top the next time.

I have used this recipe twice for catering luncheons, and it is a customer favorite. I make my own cream soup using a friend's recipe; and I quadruple the recipe to serve 10, which provides plenty of leftovers. I think this would be a great use of leftover turkey for the holidays.

Great recipe. I shredded up a whole roasted chicken (both white and dark meat) & used 8oz of sour cream. Wound of using 2 cups of cheese =) I seasoned the chicken with some fajita seasoning i bought at World Market--but I think taco seasoning would taste good too. Thanks for the recipe!

I was really disappointed in this recipe. I thought for a recipe with such a high rating it would be fantastic. It tastes nothing like a Enchiladas, and has absolutely no flavor. I even tried all the suggestions that others left, and still I was very unhappy. DO NOT MAKE THIS.

This is a great recipe however I used corn tortillas instead of flour. I sprayed each with non stick spray then stacked them on a plate and microwaved them for a few seconds so they would be easier to roll. I also chose to use a whole chicken (which I shredded), purchased at the store already roasted to save on time.

My husband loved this from the first time I made it!  I've tweaked it to be more to his taste (using cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, using canned chipotles instead of green chiles) and I swear it gets better every time we make it.

My husband and I fell in love with this recipe. I've used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom or celery soup together when I double the sauce if I don't have 2 cans of C of Chicken on hand. I also use two large cans of canned chicken, add Rotel if I have it, and a pack of taco seasoning. This recipe is foolproof. You can alter types of chicken, and add more seasonings to taste -- it is so delicious! I serve it with the Fiesta Cheese Rice recipe from this site. Super easy spanish rice done in the microwave in minutes! Both of these recipes I highly recommend!

These were amazing. I hesitated b/c I don't like to use processed canned food. But I was not sorry! My husband said these are the only enchiladas I should ever make. And he loved the ones I used to make! My friends loved it too. Next time I make it, I will make my own cream of chicken soup. I can't wait!!

Yummy!  Cook the chicken in chicken broth and taco seasoning in the crock pot first for really tender, moist chicken.  I also used Cream of Chicken soup instead of mushroom.

Great Recipe!  Double recipe, use lasagne dish and use enchilda sauce instead of milk.  I PREFER cream of chicken soup (healthy choice), 2 4-oz cans of mild green chiles, some cumin and nonfat sour cream but extra cheese  :o)   Serve with spanish rice and you're set.  Make ahead or freeze - all have worked for me.  Enjoy!

I used the corn tortillas and exchanged the milk for enchilada sauce as another reviewer suggested.  My husband said they were the best enchiladas ever!  I couldn't have done it without the original recipe to start from.  I think I can safely remove any other versions from my recipe box.

I give this a 4 because my husband loved it(would give a 5)! I wasn't too impressed- Maybe I like a red enchilada sauce?  It didn't seem to have much flavor, but I will see how it does the next day!

This is sooo good! I double the sauce using one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken. I make a double batch so i can take leftovers to work for lunch. I have to fight my 4 year old for the last one everytime! Definatley a staple at my house!!

These were amazing!  I was hesitant to use an enchilada recipe that includes cream of mushroom soup.  But somehow it worked very well, it was a smooth and creamy sauce.  I used fresh green chilies, I prefer the fresher taste, but it adds a lot more heat.  Possibly a bit too much for my husband:)  Thanks for sharing this recipe, my new enchilada recipe.  I'm finally done searching!!!

really loved this, so did my husband.  pretty easy to make, i substituted a white onion for the green one, only because i forgot to get that at the store.  i also added a halapeno pepper we already had to the sauce.  took one of the other suggestions and put some green chili enchilada sauce (old el paso brand?)under the enchiladas.  we will be making this again, thank you : )

Excellent! I will be making these often, especially since the ingredients are usually found in my kitchen. No extra trip to the grocery store!! I do highly recommend doubling the recipe because if you don’t, you won’t fill the entire baking dish. Plus enchiladas are always a great left over!! If you are worried about this dish being too bland, use two packages of Foster Farm's "southwestern" seasoned chicken breast strips. You can find this in the fresh (not frozen) meat section of your grocery store. Thanks for a simple and tasty recipe.

This was an incredibly easy recipe and frankly, better than I expected it would! I used low fat sour cream, but other than that, prepared exactly as the recipe instructed.  Next time I will also use fat free soup to save a few more calories.  My seven and fourteen year old sons enjoyed this dish, as did I.  Great recipe!

I didn't have leftovers, I just really wanted to try this recipe for lunch today. It was awesome! It took me 5 - 10 minutes to cook the chicken breasts on the George Foreman grill while I prepped the sauce.

The first time I made these they were a bit bland.  The second time I maded a few changes.  I doubled the sauce, added a 1/4 cup of cooking Sherry, 2 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of chili powder.  I also used a chopped white onion instead of the green onion. I also added more cheese. We thought it was fantastic!  Next time I am going to try adding a can of chopped tomatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been looking for this recipe!!  I had a friend years ago that made chicken enchiladas just like these - I had the recipe and lost it.  This recipe tastes identical!!  I added a bit of cumin to the sauce, that's the only change.  I told my boyfriend LOVED these.  He's not normally a big enchilada fan, but went back for seconds.  These are super yummy!!

I use all the filling in the tortillas and a can of red enchilada sauce on the top.  Instead of cooking it, I put 2 in a tupperware container and freeze it.  Then dethaw a night before and my husband microwaves it at work - he loves it!

These were absolutely wonderful, definitely the best chicken enchiladas I've ever had. I only used to eat cheese and beef enchiladas until my brother came to visit and requested them. Since then none of us can seem to get enough! I got more compiments on this meal than I have on any other. Also, I left out the green onions and it still turned out great :)

UPDATE: This is a fantastic recipe. I always use more cream of chicken soup and make extra sauce. I also always put some of the sauce in the bottom of the pan so the enchiladas don't get crunchy on the bottom. Made this for my picky parents and brother and they loved it. Made it for my picky 5 year old (who until last month had never even eaten a hamburger) and he loves it! Spice it up a bit more than the recipe calls for though and make extra sauce to put on top.  : )

This was excellent. I used 98% fat-free soup, fat free sour cream, low fat cheese and skim milk. It was so creamy and delicious! I didn't cook the green onions first and I didn't have chiles, so I added 2 Tbls. of HOT salsa to the chicken mixture. I just made this yesterday and my husband is already asking when we can have it again.

I used corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas and microwaved them for 30 seconds to make them more pliable. If you do no heat them before rolling, they will fall apart. I served these with black beans and traditional Spanish rice.

This recipie was awesome but I also made a few changes/additions.  I doubled the recipe also.  I added white onion instead of green.  I also added cilantro & 3 cloves of garlic, which really gave this recipe a restaurant flavor!  I used a rotisserie chicken too from Target and shredded the chicken meat.  I used the entire chicken which was about 4 cups of chicken instead of what the recipe called for.  I used a whole 8 oz. container of sour cream.  I used two cans of cream of chicken soup.  It left plenty to stuff the enchiladas as well as pour over the top.  My recipe made about 8 enchiladas and were plenty filling to leave leftovers.  The two kids had one and we each had 2.  YUMMY!  I will definitely make this again.

This dish was awesome!! The only change I made was instead of just adding the green chilis, I added a can of ro-tel with chilis, and used the rotisserie chicken from HEB. This is one of my favorite recipes I've tried on this website and will defiantly make again. Thanks so much!!

I don't know about the original recipe, but I made some changes and they turned out GREAT!  Even my picky 4 year nephew liked them and didn't even sit there and pick out the veggies :).  The changes I took from other reviews were: I added onion powder, garlic powder, and taco seasoning to the chicken before cooking it..I shredded the chicken instead of cutting it into cubes. Definitely DOUBLE THE SAUCE.. I doubled it and it came out the PERFECT amount! But use less milk or it will be too runny..I used green peppers instead of the chili peppers, added red peppers, 1 can of "cream of mushroom & chicken", and another can of just "cream of chicken" (2 in all) Used Monterrey Jack cheese instead of Cheddar Used corn tortillas instead of flour.  I dipped in hot old to make them softer too...I served my enchiladas with Spanish rice and refried beans..I was also going to add jalapeños since I think it would add a nice little KICK to them... but my sister said she had a sensitive stomach so I will have to wait until the next time to try that..

Excellent recipe. I would next time, add a little sauce to the lightly greased pans. Because, the tortillas baked a little hard on the bottom. Also, next time, I will place foil on top and bake for 20 minutes, and take it off during the last 10 minutes. A little of the cheese became hard, not bubbly. Thank you, for sharing.

These were GREAT! I used frozen chicken fajita meat in the filling and it added a good amount of flavor, but next time I will try the rotisserie chicken as the frozen kind lacks texture. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is. My husband doesn't like regular enchilada sauce, so this was perfect for him. I loved it as well. Thanks for the quick, tasty and easy recipe!

this really doesn't seem like a five-star recipe.  the basics are there, but I had to add lots of chopped fresh cilantro, fresh garlic and fresh lime juice to the sauce.  I also added chili powder and cilantro to the filling.

These enchiladas were DELICIOUS and very easy to make.  I substituted corn tortillas for the flour; softening them up in the microwave and then a little heated oil before rolling.  My family does like onions so I sauted 1 large clove garlic instead of using green onions.  I also added adobo seasoning and cilantro to the chicken mixture.  I cooked the enchiladas for 15 minutes, then added the cheese to the top along with drizzling some Mexican sour cream and continued cooking 15 more minutes.  I will make this recipe again and again!

I've tried other chicken enchilada recipes, but they were often too bland or too runny.  This is nice and creamy, with great flavor.  I am still looking for a recipe that does NOT use canned soup (too much sodium and preservatives), but in the meantime, this recipe trumps all others!

Pretty good! I used fresh garlic and a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom. Also, I added some fresh ground pepper and cumin to add a little more zip.

Very rich and creamy! Has great flavor but not too spicy. I used three chicken breast cup up and then seasoned them with lots of cumin, some chili powder and a little garlic. These turned out awesome my hubby loved them also a winner with my four year old!

Delicious recipe. The only change that I made is I added two cans of green chilies, because  I love them so much. This was a great recipe. Thanks!!!

This recipe is awesome!!! I made it for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loved it too!! The only suggestion is to make sure you put some sauce on the bottom of the dish before putting the enchiladas in... otherwise I would suggest this to anyone!! :)

I use a pressure cooker for shredded chicken which I add cayenne pepper and garlic salt to before cooking. Also, I double the sauce and add extra cheese to the filling.  Have had many people ask me to make these over and over again - especially my husband.  I'd make them weekly if our waistlines could handle it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was a nice change from the usual red sauce enchiladas.  Don't leave out the green onions, garlic powder, or green chiles.  They really give the dish a lot of flavor.  Otherwise, the enchiladas would probably just taste like soup in tortillas.

I tried this recipe quite a while ago and we love it. There are no changes, except I use freshly minced garlic. It's fabulous, everyone loves it and it has become an easy staple to my menu.

GREAT!  because it tasted good and was SO easy!  I used leftover chicken (definitely shred it next time).  Added 1/2 bag of taco seasoning to the mix (i'll try enchilada seasoning next time), poured taco sauce on top (I'll use enchilada sauce next time).  I used lowfat sour cream.  I was scared w/ soup as the main ingredient but it just made the recipe creamy. Can't wait to make again! also used the 6" size flour tortillas - perfect amount for our family.  made 8.  served w/ refried black beans- the kids devoured it!

I made this dish for the second time tonight, and it is incredible!  I added chopped cilantro (also called Chinese parsley or coriander) to the mix, and a can of Wolf brand chili with no beans spread on top, under the cheese.  It was really good!

These are not your average enchiladas.  If you prefer the tomato based ones & don't care for creamed soups, this is not the recipe for you. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the recipe.  I used whole wheat tortillas and also added fresh mushrooms.  I felt the mixture wasn't enough for 6 tortillas & ended up doubling the filling.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup.  I used cream of chicken soup, and it was great too.  I will add this recipe to my collection.

OK I was making red the enchilada Verdes from this site for the grown ups and I wanted something good for the kids so I tried your dish. Instead of the diced green chile I added Red Las Palmas just to make the reddish so the kids would think they were having just another red enchilada. I was told by my HAPPY BELLY children not to make my "plain" enchiladas anymore from now on I'm making these! I was so happy. Now I know why you have been rated so well by over 1000 members. Thanks for sharing such an awesome dish!

I used 98% fat free Cream of Mushroom Soup and a mix of Cheddar and Jack cheese.  I also used pre-cooked Fajita seasoned chicken (it was all I could find and I was in a pinch).  It was excellent!

These were really good!  I did change the recipe up as others mentioned using cream of chicken soup and adding chicken taco seasoning.  I also have to agree with another reviewer that this fills 6 - 6" tortillas, not the 12" tortillas.  I made this with the Mexican Rice I recipe and it was a great meal!

I've made the recipe many times and everyone always raves about it!  The last time I made it I subbed cream of celery cause I didn't have mushroom and it still came out great!  I make it as a casserole, laying the tortillas and chicken mixture.  I also think this mixture would make a great hot dip for chips!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious!  I made two batches of the sauce.  One for my daughter without the chiles and onion.  The other for the adults with all the ingredients.  The whole family was pleased.

This is NOT an enchilada, but boy is it ever GOOD!  It's more like a pollo fundido.  Just excellent--everyone loves it!  Be careful with the sauce amounts--I find I tend to -almost- run out before they're all covered just before baking.  MMM MMMM GOOD!

These are *THE BEST* enchiladas I've ever had. The only things I had to do different were 1)Use cream of chicken soup instead because I'm not a fan of mushroom and 2)Use a little can of Rotel instead of green chilies because they don't carry them at my local (only lol) grocer. Very, VERY good, thanks so much!

My husband & I really enjoyed this recipe.  He like his dish extra spicy so I added 1/2 a can of green enchilada sauce & it was perfect and stretched the sauce out.  Will definitely make again.

Pretty good.  I used lowfat sourcream for the sauce, it was great.  Also, I used a colby jack mix and it was perfect. I cut the bake time down to about 20 minutes.  This was a great meal, and I plan on using it again.

This is one of the few "canned cream of..." recipes that I enjoy making. Most of the time I'm just not fond of adding stuff to mushroom soup and calling it a recipe because it;s always so salty. But I really like this and it is easy to make (big bonus!).

I found this dish to be pretty flavorless, not spicy as was expected. If I were to make this again, I would use enchilada sauce instead of mushroom soup.

AWESOME!!!!!  I don't know what else to say.  I even screwed up the directions and they were so good.  I was distracted and mixed all the sauce ingredients along with the chicken (which I had shredded) before setting the 1/4 aside.  So we had shredded chicken in the sauce on top too. Oh well, we loved them and will do it right next time! :)

Thanks for sharing ... great recipe.  I've made this several times and tweaked it a bit each time.  I used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken soup.  I also added 1/2 tsp paprika to give it a little more flavor, AND I used 1 chicken boulion cube in 1/4 cup of water (instead of milk) and added that to the soup mixture for my topping.  I found these changes gave it lots of flavor!

Awesome recipe!! I could make this several times a week! I made it for my whole family (some picky eaters...) and they all loved it! I would like to point out that green chilies are not hot, if any cooks found this recipe to be too spicy, they used the wrong ingredient.

These were good. I didn't have a can of green chile's so diced a green bell pepper and sauteed with the onions. Also made a couple with fake chicken for my vegetarian daughter she loved it too. Youngest daughter cleared her plate always a plus. Thanks.

Excellent.  I would recommend boiling the chicken, shredding it and adding chili powder and cumin to it for more flavor.  Very tasty!

This was excellent.  Three or four years ago my former sister-in-law made these chicken enchilada's there were excellent.  I asked her for the recipe and she said no.  So I am very gratedful I found this one.  It it pretty darn close to hers.  Very Very good.  Even my picky husband and daughter liked it.  my very picky daughter asked for seconds.  wow.

These were good enchiladas.  Not shockingly good, but good.  I had frozen chicken breasts, so I threw them in the slow cooker in the morning with a can of cream of mushroom soup and some chicken broth.  The chicken came out perfectly for shredding.  I made the sauce separately since I wanted to follow this recipe, but I think next time I'll just throw all the ingredients in the slow cooker with the chicken, stir in the sour cream at the very end, and use that as the sauce.  Then at dinner time I'll just have to assemble the enchiladas and bake and they'll be ready.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night for my shift (I'm a fireman). I upscaled this recipe to feed 12 and actually made 16 enchiladas with it (which fed 7 people, could have fed 8). Some other reviewers said that this might be a bit bland, so when I was cooking the chicken in the pan, I seasoned the heck out of it with a touch of salt, a lot of garlic pepper, cumin, chili powder, paprika, parsley, basil and pretty much everything else i thought would taste good. But everyone on my shift LOVED these. My captain said I need to make them more often.

Ok, Ok, I made some changes..  I doubled the sauce recipe so that I could spread more on the top and also put some in the bottom of the baking dish before the enchildas.  I used cream of CHICKEN soup instead,  I used way more cheese, I added one can of black olives and sliced them, 2 tblsp of chopped jalapenos, NO garlic powder, and NO milk and NO butter.  I didn't saute the onions, just put them right into the mixture.  I LOVE this recipe!!. My company raved!  I served with a green salad and refried beans, covered with cheese.  And wine.  Don't forget the wine.

The whole family loved it, even picky kids (ages 8 & 4).  The 4-year old even said it is her new favorite food.  (It's a miracle!)  The only change I made was to use cream of chicken soup because my husband is iffy on mushrooms. It turned out perfectly.  Great recipe!  Thanks, Steph!

I agree with other reviewers - use cream of chicken soup.  Also, I add vegetables versus green chiles depending on what I have on hand and found it's good with some mushrooms and green peppers.  Also, give it some kick with chile powder & cumin.

These are easy to make and a big hit with guys.  I agree with other reviews that there wasn't enough filling... next time I will make more or use 10" tortillas instead of 12".

I love this recipe!  No matter how many times I make it, it always turns out perfect!!!  The one thing that I do differently is I boil my chicken until it is starting to peel away and then I shred it, instead of chicken strips.  You will absolutely love this recipe!!

I made these last night and they were great! I did take some suggestions that were helpful. Cooked chicken with taco seasoning (about half a pouch). Used 1 can cream of chicken + 1/2 can cream of mushroom. Doubled the sour cream. Used a Mexican blend pre-shred cheese (and didn't measure it - just added as much as I wanted), small tortillas (made 8)and chopped up a small jalapeno and sprinkled it on top before baking. My boyfriend ate seconds and we both took some for lunch today! Delish!

These are very good.  Be sure to use smaller tortilla shells - I used the larger ones and it was a little tough to get them out of the baking dish.

This recipe was awesome. Thank you for submiting it.  I did however make a few changes.  I added some taco seasoning like others suggested, and used the mexican cheeese mix instead of just plain cheddar.  I also shredded chicken instead of using cubed chicken.

This recipe is Awesome. I did not have green onions so I used what I had on hand (Vidalia). I also was out of Garlic powder so I used fresh minced garlic. I doubled the sauce and divided it in half. This was so YUMMY. I had saved another recipe to try, But after making this I do not need another.Also I used 8 inch Flour tortillas Because it fit in my pan easier. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe- It was Excellent!

This recipe is fantastic!  I followed the advice of many and made a few changes.   I sauteed the chicken with cumin, garlic, salt & pepper in olive oil, used regular onions and a can of Mexican Rotel in place of the green onions and chili peppers.  I also doubled the sauce mix using cream of chicken instead of mushroom.  My husband loved them.  Very rich.  Would suggest rice and a salad as sides.

I made this recipe last night for my boyfriend and I. I thought it was really really great. I actually just ate some leftovers for lunch, they are even great cold...but I might just be wierd like that. I used half cream of chicken and half cream of mushroom and twice as much cheese and twice as much chicken. This recipe is a definite keeper!

I served these to company lastnite, and they were a big hit!!  It a nice change from the red enchilada sauces that I usually use for Mexican food. Very easy to make. I substituted the cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken soup and seasoned the chicken breast before frying in 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  I would prefer more sauce, so next time I will be doubling the recipe for the sauce, and spooning sauce in the bottom of the dish before adding the enchilada's. I would suggest not adding the cheese on top until the last l5 minutes of baking time,  baking just until melted.  I can't wait to make these again.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!!

This recipe tasted good and was very filling.  I did make a few changes.  I used 3 full chicken breasts, and instead of adding the chiles, I used a 1/2 cup of fresh salsa.  It came out great!

Excellent for a filling, casual, yummy meal.  Definitely go with cream of chicken soup and double both the sour cream & cheese---even doing that, however, the recipe yields more like 3, not 6. Yum!

Recipe is great! I added 1/2 a purple onion and 1/2 yellow onion to the mix.Did not have green onion.Also cooked chicken breast in a skillet beforehand with a little cumin,garlic salt,and fresh ground pepper.Added great seasoning to the chicken itself.(Advice from other review, said chicken was a little bland) Recipe itself is wonderful!!!Will definitly keep this recipe to use again & again.

Very good. I doubled the recipe and had to use one can of cream of chicken soup because I only had one can of mushroom. I also seasoned the chicken (three large boneless brest halves) with chili lemon salt and garlic and cooked it in olive oil. Eveyone, except for my two year old son, loved it.

This recipe never fails. I added a can of creamed corn to the chicken mixture as well as a tsp. of cayenne pepper for extra hotness....so yummy. I often use store bought rotissere chicken that makes shredding it very easy.

Exellent recipe! I did make a few changes though: I added the green chillie to the chicken mixture, used corn tortillas & Cream of Chicken soup. Instead of milk, I added a 4oz can of Herdez Salsa Verde to the souce mix. I used a mixture of Cheddar & Mozzerella. After pouring mixture over enchiladas, I topped with the cheese mixture, then sprinkled the chopped green onions and some sliced black olives on top. I baked covered for 30 mins, then uncoverd for another 15. My husband and I LOVED it! And the leftovers were also great! The addition of the Salsa Verde to the sauce gave it just the right kick.

I have been using almost this exact same recipe for years, and it is just a wonderful, no fail recipe.  
Try spreading some of the sauce on the bottom of the pan so that the bottoms of the tortillas dont get hard. Yummy!!

I substituted a crushed garlic clove for the garlic powder and added 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp cumin.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Even picky DS liked it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a huge hit, can't wait to make it again.  Made a few changes, used corn tortillas, cream of chicken soup, and added chili powder and cumin.  Also I used monteray jack cheese with jalapenos.  This is a great recipe to double, I just added an extra can of cream of chicken to the reserve sauce.  I also used thighs that I boiled a day a head of time, and made stock for later.

This is a great basic recipe.  I added cayenne, chili powder, and cumin with the garlic pwder.  I also added a can of black beans and 1 cup of frozen corn along with a jar of salsa to the chicken to liven it up.  I sauted the corn and beans first.  As the others have suggested, I used corn tortillas and they were perfect!
Enjoy this family classic!!

I've made these a few times now.  The only changes I made were using corn tortillas and the low-fat condensed soup instead.  Super yum!

This recipe is AMAZING! My entire family loved it, even my three year old. I will certainly be making this next time we have company. I did use a can of tomatoes w/green chiles instead of a whole can of green chiles, and a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup instead of just cream of mushroom but only b/c that is what I had on hand. But I don't think that made much of a difference, they were great. I read the negative reviews, and could not believe that anyone could have anything bad to say about these. I am convinced that it must have been operator error!!

This recipe was great, but I made a couple of changes.  I used corn tortillas instead of flour (I don't care for flour tortillas.) I added cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup.  I also added some red oil hot sauce.  It was yummy.

These enchiladas are the BEST! My picky husband and kids (4 & 5) loved them. As suggested in earlier reviews, I doubled the entire recipe except for the tortillas (otherwise there wouldn't be enough filling). I cooked the chicken in taco seasoning and used a prepackaged "Mexican Taco Cheese" (cheddar, monterey jack, taco season). Without these there is not enough spice and these could be a little bland. I also added sliced olives. The leftover enchiladas are just as good. I will be making these relatively easy and tasty enchiladas again!

This was wonderful...The grocery store I went to only had mild chiles, so I had to add some southwest seasoning (the only spicy thing I had in the pantry) to give it a little kick. My husband devoured it. This will be my regular chicken enchilada recipe from now on!

These were good... not exceptional, but good.  My boyfriend thought they were great, but I thought they were perhaps a little rich.  Extremely filling... one enchilada/burrito with some spanish rice on the side is plenty for dinner for just about anyone.

These were excellent. It was my first time making enchiladas and it was very quick and easy. It has a very mild flavor and needs to be spiced up though. Next time I'll add a jalapeno pepper and some more green chiles. I'll be making it again very soon. I would double the sauce.

I wasn't sure how well this dish would be considering the lack of traditional enchilada sauce and the level of ease.  Boy was I wrong, my family loved it and asked me to add it to my recipe file. 5 fully deserved stars.

There is nothing wrong with these and aside from pulling the chicken off the bone it was fairly easy.  I guess I just prefer a spicier more traditional version of enchiladas.

Enchiladas taste was bland.  Also, if you make mix ahead of time and put in refrigerator...then double the time to cook.  I did not do this and when I server the enchiladas they were cold.  Also, increase the sauce by 50%..rather dry.  Not a keeper.

I thought it was interesting but my husband wasn't crazy about it.  For my taste, it needs a DASH of some spice(s) like chili powder, cumin, and/or cayenne.

This was excellent.  I've never made enchiladas before so I was a little worried.  They were so easy and yummy.  My boyfriend said they were the best he'd ever had.  He raved about them all night.  I followed another review and used shredded chicken, and replaced the milk for 1/2 of a can of enchilada red sauce and used a 7 oz can of chiles.  I think the red sauce made a huge difference.  Thank you for this awesome recipe.

I doubled the recipe and used about 10 soft shells in a 9x13 pan. I added 1 can of each-cream of mushroom and cream of chicken, 1 cup fresh salsa instead of green chilies and added some chopped black olives to it. My family loved it!

This is one of my FAVORITE recipes!  The flavor is fabulous!  The enchiladas can easily be prepared in advance and they reheat well too!  Like other reviewers, I suggest increasing the amount of sauce or pouring prepared enchilada sauce over the enchiladas.

My wife and I just adore this recipe.  It's true, it's not your usual enchilada, and you DO need more than 1.5 cups of chicken to make 6 enchiladas(we use more like 3 cups to get some big enchiladas).  But when you taste that sauce in your mouth, you're gonna wish every meal tasted like this!

Wow!  My husband and I have been searching for an enchilada recipe with a white sauce instead of the traditional red sauce and this one is a winner!  We were a bit skeptical at first but after the first bite, any doubts we had vanished as we devoured our plates.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Unbelievably delicious!  My hubby also chose to marinate the chicken in tequilla, lime and white wine.  He grilled it and added cilantro from our garden.  It was so wonderful!  Thank you!!!

I make this anytime I'm having company and I want to WOW them! I double the mixture, use cream of chicken soup, add some extra spice, shred the chicken, and use enchilada sauce instead of milk. I make the mixture the night before and the flavors blend wonderfully! (I roll and cook right before serving.) Everybody LOVES these and always wants the recipe!!!

Hands down the best I have ever tried!  May I suggest using 2 of the larger cans of chicken breast instead of shredding your own cooked breasts... it takes about 20 min off the prep time.  I even screwed up on the recipe twice the 1st time around, and it was still awesome!  Have made it several times since.  Also, since it's so easy with the canned chicken, it is so very worth it to double the recipe and have enough to freeze for another day.  Freezes beautifully!

Yummy!!!  Easy to make and delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  I used already cooked purchased chicken instead of cooking my own...time saver. Will make again and again...husband loved it....might add jalepeno peppers next time for a little extra heat....otherwise, a sure keeper!!

Oh My GOSH!  When I was a newlywed (back in '92!) I purchased a Campbell's cookbook and this was one of the first recipes I managed to make succesfully!  My Ultra-super-duper picky Husband and kids have loved it all along....i'm glad to see it's being passed along,and I loved seeing others' suggested additions to the recipe! I plan to add a little cumin and jalapeno to the recipe when I make this for tomorrow's supper.  My Family is absolutely happy with the original 10+ year old recipe, but i'd love to throw in a little zip now that I don't have toddlers to wrry about! I have always used Cream of Chicken soup *only*, MORE sour cream too, it definately adds a special tanginess to the sauce and for heaven's sake DON'T skimp on the green chile's, chili powder or SHARP cheddar cheese...NO it's not diet friendly but it's so yummy who cares?! We usually top this (well the grownups do!) with my special home made salsa, extra grated cheddar, and black olives...I have to go i'm getting hungry!

I have been making different kinds of enchiladas for over 40 years.  My husband said these are the best enchiladas he has ever eaten of any type. I added a little cilantro, cumin and chili powder to the cooked chicken ( which I boiled and shredded) and a few drops of green habanero hot sauce to the sauce.  They were perfect...not too hot or too mild. This recipe made 4 fat enchiladas I would say it served 3 or 4 with rice and beans  on the side....

Great flavor!  I will make it again.  The only thing I had to do differently was dip the tortillas into liquid to keep them from cracking when rolled.  I used hot chicken broth.

From what I read of the other reviews, this recipe needed some SPICE so I added some cumin, chili powder and tabasco. I also added some of my homemade salsa  and a little bit more milk than the recipe called for. It gave it the right Mexican flavor it needed. I also took the advice of others and used the Chicken soup. It was fabulous and I will be making it regularly. Even the kids liked it. This would be great fun made in Mini-tortillas for a party or family potluck!

This did not go over well with the family. I was looking for a simple enchilada recipe, which this is. However, I never use cream of mushroom soup and based on that I should have known this wouldn't have been popular in my house. It reminded me of something served at IHOP or Denny's.

I added chopped orange peppers, onion and fresh garlic to the chicken mixture, used cream of chicken soup and as suggested by another reviewer I spread the warmed tortillas with refried beans then filled and rolled them.   This was delicious and I will definitely make again.

We LOVED it!  I cut the recipe in half because there's only two of us.  I also skipped the green chilis because I forgot to buy them.. Ops! But the recipe was still really good!  My boyfriend said it was 7.5 (which is really good for him as he expects Gordon Ramsay quality food when both of us have the skill to burn water) but I say it was a solid 9!  We will definitely make it again!

Followed the tips from other cooks and doubled the sauce.
Added a pinch of cayenne pepper and did stir about 1/4 of 
a package of taco seasoning into the cooked chicken.
I also flash  cooked the large size corn tortillas in oil before filling.  Otherwise the tortillas are too stiff. 
Also prepared the cooking dish with a little oil and a sprinkle of water.  The water helps to soften the tortillas.
Delicious.

Yeah... I altered it!    Because I ad chick wings that were not cooked all the way! So i fried those, after I deboned the m.  I added a touch of cumin and chili powder to the sauce.  Added real garlic w/onion.   When done, I then added mozzarella and homemade salsa! Broilid for five minutes. Ridiculous!!!

Followed recipe exactly. Tastes like what you get in the restaurants. The color of the sauce is not that appealing (a little gray) bc of the mushroom soup so I may try cream of  chicken soup next time. But I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I usually don't rate recipes if I change anything but since I only substituted for fat free soup, sour cream, Xtreme tortillas, skim milk, and cheese it should still count. I thought even though much healthier this was a very good casserole. Definitely be on regular menu.

This is awesome!  I have made it with flour and whole wheat tortillas.  I tend to add more chicken.  My kids love it which is all that really matters at dinner time.  It's quick, easy and a pleaser!  I always keep green chilies and the soup on hand just in case.  This is a go to recipe for sure!

I have made this recipe SO many times! It is probably our favorite meal. My sons and husband all love it. I always have to 4X the recipe because we eat so much. Lol! I have added  rice, increased the amount of soup, sometimes mixed cream of chicken and cream of mushroom,  increased the amount of chiles, etc. It is easily adaptable to your personal preferences. Tonight I will be trying something new. It always takes me a long time to make this because I usually make 24 enchiladas at a time and the filling and rolling takes me forever. So tonight I will try making it as a casserole and layering the ingredients while using the tortillas like lasagna noodles. I'm hoping it will save some time. :) LOVE this recipe!!

I made this for dinner and truly enjoyed it. The only thing I would change in the next go round is the green chiles. I used mild chile's because I was afraid of the heat but the sour cream really tones it down so I can't wait to try the spicy peppers.Oh and one other thing, I used corn tortillas because that's what real enchiladas are made with.

Great basic recipe, but needed changes.  I used corn tortillas, cream of chicken soup, and replaced the milk with enchilada sauce.  I used quite a bit more cheese than called for in the recipe too.  They came out very good!

Made this for a girl's night and they loved it! Only problem is I don't think it serves 6... If you serve 2 per person, it serves 3. I was able to stretch it to 8 enchiladas, but they were kind of skimpy. Next time I'll double the recipe and get HUGE enchiladas!

Followed the recipe as written except used corn tortillas. Very bland flavor, but presentation was nice and it is a great way to get rid of leftover chicken.  I am going to try this again, but add taco seasoning, cumin, salsa or enchilada sauce...needs to be tweaked for my family's tastes.  I don't think the sauce should be doubled, as it was almost too creamy as is...I say this because a lot of people recommended doubling the sauce, which I think would make it too soupy.  Three stars as written, but could be a four or five with modifications...I'm not giving up on this one!

I thought these were good but a little bland.  If I make them again, I will probably add some cumin or jalapeno, perhaps a little more garlic, sprinkle more green onion on the top and use a red enchilada sauce on top instead of the soup mixture.  All in all a good recipe, easy and fast to put together.  I would think these would be a hit with young children who don't like spicy food.

This was delish! My hubby doesn't like tomatoes so this worked very well. Couple of mods I made: used evaporated milk vice regular milk, no cream of mushroom soup instead added alittle more evaporated milk and jalapeños vice green chiles and regular onion. Agree with other person that corn holds up better than flour tortillas. Flour tortillas get gummy but with this recipe, it is not too noticeable because of the cream sauce on top. Definitely will do this one again! Next time I will try with corn tortillas. yummy recipe!

As written, this is a good starting point. I added cumin (the Mexican flavor) and used Nacho Cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom. Because of this, I only added shredded sharp cheddar on top. I also stirred in a bit of leftover salsa. The quantity of chicken was also doubled. Wonderfully flavorful dish!

I made some changes by using rotisserie chicken, exchanging the sour cream for Greek yogurt and doubling the amount, and doubling the amount of cheese. It is a great, easy recipe that is a hit each time.

So Yummy>  I have made this about 4 times in the last month, serving to different eaters, and it was a hit.  First made it for picky husband (he now begs for these), next a ladies lunch (yep, it was a huge hit), then 4 college students who live with my son (they sent me snapchats of themselves enjoying this dish) and lastly,  a few girls from the neightborhood.  

Tweak it if you like but be confident if you follow the recipe, you'll have happy eaters.  I added some chopped spinach when I did the onions once when I made it.  Just wanted to use that fresh spinach so I threw in a few handfuls roughly chopped.

Double the recipe-your family and friends will want more.  Happy munching!

I fixed this yesterday using a rotisserie chicken. Also I did three flour tortillas and five corn tortillas. I wasn't sure which would be better. My husband said the flour tortillas are good when you're eating those. The corn tortillas are good when eating those. To go back-and-forth between the two was not good. This is a very good chicken enchilada recipe.

I have made this recipe as is, and it was a definite keeper, 4-1/2 stars.  My 5th star is for the changes I've made per other reviews.  I use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, I add a tablespoon of taco seasoning at the same time as the sour cream, etc., and I use Mexican 4-cheese mix instead of plain Cheddar.  For me that ramps it up to 5 stars and one of the recipes I always think of first with leftover chicken.

Don't restrict yourself to using only Chicken. This recipe is a great way to use up extra turkey, beef or pork roast. I have tried all and they are equally delicious. 

I have made this recipe many times over the past few years since I discovered it here. My only tweaks are using extra meat and  if I'm preparing chicken solely to use in this recipe I will cook it up with some Mexican seasonings, onions and/or celery.

I loved these enchiladas.  Because the sauce is weak, the flavor of the onions and peppers really stood out.

I am from Arizona so I am used to Red sauce enchiladas. These are not hot or spicy at all (at least to me) they were so good though! I loved this recipe. Only thing different was I used some chopped onion, garlic and salt when boiling my chicken. Then I put some Cracker Barrel shredded sharp cheese on top. So good!

I followed the recipe as written except I substituted Cream of Mushroom with Cream of Chicken, since my kids hate mushrooms. Everyone in my house loved this recipe! The kids even asked me to send the leftovers for lunch.

Can you say yum? These were really good. I sauteed yellow onion at the start, but before serving sprinkled with green onion. Went extra on the garlic powder and added about a tsp of homemade taco seasoning mix, to bump up the flavor a bit. I put two enchiladas  on my plate, but one was plenty...they're very filling! Had it with refried beans and sour cream on the side. Just add a brewski, and life is good! Thanks for a great recipe teppij!

Thank you! Loved it! Used a few of your modifications In addition to can of Rotel.  Was a nice visual and taste addition! Definitely preferred in my house to the tomato base enchiladas I have made in the past! It disappeared at my dinner table and is definitely a keeper!

My kids love enchiladas and request them for every birthday dinner. I use a clove of garlic instead of powder. I don't reserve any of the mixture. I fold it into the chicken and put a small amount along the bottomish of the tortilla, sprinkle with cheese and roll it up. Before I place them in a casserole dish, I coat the dish with green enchilada sauce. Once the dish is full, I cover with more sauce and cheese. I bake it off & garnish with green onion and serve them with a little sour cream. I cut fat and calories when I can, too. This makes one 11x13 dish & one 8x8, which I reserve for dinner the following day.

As written I can't rate it very high.  The sauce just tastes like a  canned soup casserole. (We've all been there.)  But I added a medium size jar (about 24 oz - maybe a bit less) of Salsa Verde to the soup mixture.  (Medium spiciness for me.)  And that really makes for a yummy sauce.  I also changed to corn tortillas and threw in some sauteed zucchini and corn, but the main thing is tweaking that sauce.

Absolutely delicious!!! I saw this recipe and had to try it because I love enchiladas and this seemed like a healthier version, although I did use heavy whipping cream that I had to use up from another recipe, but stuck to the exact measurements and it was fabulous!I topped it off with a drizzle of taco sauce, shredded cheese and cilantro:)

This recipe is a nice alternative to the traditional red sauce enchiladas.  Although I do like the traditional red sauce, I have to limit my intake of tomato sauces due to heartburn.  The only changes I made was to double the sauce and substitute yellow onions for the green onions.  I also used fresh minced garlic instead of powder.  These substitutions helped to give the sauce more flavor.  I used 8" flour tortillas and it made 12 enchiladas with plenty of filling and topping!  The 12 enchiladas fit nicely into a 9 x 13 glass baking dish.  My husband and 10 year old son LOVED it!  We almost ate the whole thing ;).

Very bland. I added another can of green chilies and a jalapeno to add a pit more to it, but it was still bland. It wasn't bad, just not worth all the great ratings this has received.

Whole family voted 'Yes!' to keeping this recipe on file!  I did add 1 tsp each of chili powder and cumin to increase the flavor and I used Cream of Celery instead of mushroom (because that's all I had).  They turned out wonderfully.  Only change I'll make on the next batch is to double the sauce and chicken to make my tortillas fuller.

I made as directed. Which is why I can rate this recipe because I didn't change it. This recipe was disappointing. This was very rich and in my opinion not worth the massive amount of calories. And I normally love rich foods. I will eat all of it, but not make again. Don't know what would have made it better so won't even be adjusting the recipe.
----
Now that it is the next day I am downgrading this to one star. I was trying to talk myself into eating the leftovers and felt sick at the thought. Not a good sign. I threw the leftovers away - and I normally love leftovers.

Made this tonight & it was a big hit!! I thought i messed it up because I forgot to add the sour cream, but I went back and added it and it turns out really good. I doubled the recipe & realized I only had 8 of the 6" or 8" tortillas (flour). But it still was really good! Also, I added about 1 cup extra cheese because we love cheesy food!! Overall, great dinner and will make again.

BOOM! These are so tasty! I added a little fresh cilantro to the mixture that goes in the tortillas. I used enchilada sauce instead of milk. Also, when I cooked the chicken I added a touch of taco seasoning. I've only tried making enchiladas once before and I majorly failed. These were so good I called my Mexican friend over to taste it and she loved them too!!!

I made this tonight and everyone thought it was amazing. I followed the recipe exactly, as I do all recipes for the first time. We discussed it at dinner and decided it needed no changes or additions.  Perfect as it is. Thank you! This one is now a favorite.

So yummy.  I always eat too much! :) I wrote  this recipe down and put it in my recipe box.  I will make this recipe again and again.  The only modifications I made were to use chicken thigh meat instead of breasts (moister) and I use fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Yum, yum!  Thank you for sharing.

Awesome family favorite-Doubled the cheese (1 cup stirred with the chicken and 1 cup on top) and  then I used dehydrated chopped onions since my family doesn't like onions too much.

Best I've found.  We aren't crazy about tomatoes, so this recipe is perfect!  I use corn/flour tortillas.  They have great flavor, and don't get as soggy as plain flour tortillas.

Made this recipe tonight. Used what I had available for the recipe. So I had 2 cans of chicken breast and this worked quite well. I saw some of the adaptions after I made the enchiladas so for someone like me who does not eat real hot and spicy food this recipe is good and would do well if having guests over. Can serve spicy salsa for those who want heat.

Made as directions called for.  They were good, but definitely nothing too special.  Maybe I prefer the red enchilada sauce out of a can - Not sure.

This recipe was fabulous! I invited my parents and brother over for dinner and they went crazy for it and want me to make it again for them soon!

I made some modifications: I swapped flour tortillas for 12 small white corn tortillas. NOTE: You must fry the corn tortillas in vegetable oil so that they won't fall apart when you roll them. Also, I used 1% milk,  light sour cream, and a tri-cheddar blend rather than one variety of cheddar. Lastly, I used shredded chicken instead of cubed. (I had about half of a chicken I had roasted the night before leftover and just used that.) 

For those commentators saying they doubled the sauce recipe, I found the amount of sauce to be just right, so long as you spread it with a spatula over the enchiladas and make sure to not to overcook the sauce. Then again, I don't typically like my food swimming in sauce, so it's really a matter of taste.

I might try this recipe with jalapeños next time for a bit of an even spicier kick.

This recipe was a hit!  Tasty, simple and unique. I BBQ'd my chicken on the grill first with some taco seasoning and I added diced up potatoes to my sauce as it was cooking and they finished cooking in the oven with the enchiladas.  The potatoes were a great addition!  I also added a bit of chili powder to the sauce and took the advice of another review and added a can of cream of chicken soup and more mushrooms.  This one was so good, I had to leave a review for the first time.

Fabulous! I shredded cooked chicken breasts and sauteed them with butter and chili powder before adding it to the sauce. I also added a can of Rotel to the one can of soup and the green chilies, and I had plenty of sauce to spoon over the enchiladas. This was easy, quick and absolutely delicious!

I have made this recipe as is every single time and I'm never displeased with the outcome. At first I was apprehensive about the cream of mushroom soup ruining the flavor, but that is far from the case. This recipe has been in my box for 2 years now. It will stay there for many to come.

Since I bought one whole roasted Costco chicken, I used the chicken for this recipe. I shredded the chicken and used about a cup and a half for all six wraps of enchiladas. I enjoyed cooking this dish and mine turned out looking good and very delicious. I am definitely going to make this again someday.

These turned out so awesome. The best part is this recipe is one of those that you don't have to measure anything perfectly. My family gobbled them up. I followed other advise and doubled the sauce just to be sure to have enough. I added chicken taco seasoning on the chicken, jalapenos, fresh tomatoes, and green onions on the top. Yum!

As written very bland needing more flavor. Had to add a lot to it to pull it out. I noticed several people changed the recipe to make it more likeable. I feel corn tortillas is better for this (like others), any way about it.

I was looking for something mild, cheesy, and quick - and this recipe fit the bill.  It was a definite crowd pleaser as written, but we do prefer it with cream of chicken soup and a full cup of sour cream without any milk.

This is an excellent recipe... just as it is.  We all know that enchiladas are made with corn tortillas, however these are excellent with flour tortillas (especially since some folks do not like the corn tortillas) the only thing I added was cumin.  LOVE IT!

Very yummy recipe!  I did modify it some to fit what I had on hand, and learned a few silly lessons in the process.  1) Instead of canned green chiles (couldn't find any), I minced up a fresh jalapeno.  Word to the wise--don't taste the seeds!  Yeah, I did that.  Ouch.  2) I made BBQ Pork for Sandwiches from this site the night before, and reserved some of the pork before putting the BBQ sauce on.  Used it for the enchiladas.  Worked out great!  3) I bought burrito-sized flour tortilla shells--probably about a foot in diameter!  Much too large--I put 1/6 of the filling in one, and realized I wouldn't be able to make six of them.  So I made four instead, and cut them in half when I served them.  Overall, very yummy!

This was good, but I would recommend using smaller tortillas than 12 inches. They were a bit too big for the amount of chicken this recipe describes. Use smaller ones for fuller, more satisfying bites.

This recipe is fool proof.  I bought rotisserie chicken from Sam's Club and shredded it and used the refried beans, taco seasoning and additional cheese like another reviewer (ivyguppy) had posted.  Came out mouth watering good.  I loved that it omitted any tomato sauce...came out creamy and melt in your mouth good. And the clean up was a breeze!

These were FANTASTIC! I cooked a whole chicken the day before and had a ton of leftovers so I was looking for a recipe to use them up. Now, I hate mushrooms but I took a chance with the soup and I have to say I'm glad I did! Definitely a go to recipe for chicken! It also didn't cause a huge mess like I thought it was going to. I can't wait to make these again! And clean up was a breeze.

I made some changes to the recipe to give it more flavor, since my family found them to be pretty bland.  I tripled the onions and sauteed a couple of cloves of minced garlic.  I added a cup of salsa to the sauce as well.  I plan on baking the chicken with some taco seasoning or chili powder to add some intensity to the flavor.  The are more like burritos than enchiladas, but they are a good start for a basic recipe.

Very delicious!  I saute'd some frozen grilled fajita chicken strips in a little bit of oil and sprinkled them with southwest spices ( I used Tastefully Simple's Fiesta Dip spice).  I definitely used corn tortillas (enchiladas are made with corn and burritos are made with flour) and softened them by dipping them in a little heated oil.  I doubled the sauce.   I was out of green chiles and onions, so instead I saute'd minced fresh garlic and minced dried onions in the butter and I added at least a teaspoon, maybe more, of chile powder and ground cumin to the sauce.  I used high grade white Wisconsin Cheddar (from Costco) for the cheese and it was insanely flavorful!  After assembling I sprinkled the enchiladas with paprika which added another flavor and some kick.  My kids and husband raved about them!

So I forgot to add the sour cream into the Chicken mixture, so I added it into the sauce, still good stuff, will be making this again...its pretty hard to find this type a recipe without tomatoes (love them, but they don't like me much).

As written this recipe is not that good.  I followed it 90% (used regular onions instead of green, and cream of chicken soup).  It was boring, I expect a bit of spice with my 'mexican' food, and this was designed for little kids, its just chicken, cheese, and tortillas.  Won't be making again.

This is an excellent recipe and became an instant hit with the family. Reading through some of the other reviews I did increase the sauce between 1/4 and 1/2. The chicken should be increased to 2 cups and the cheese should be increased as well.  After doing these increases I was still only able to fill 5 ten inch shells instead of the 6 twelve inch shells it calls for. Guess you could use smaller shells and just have more of them.  Really, really good though.  You won't be disappointed

These are delicious and simple to make!  I couldn't find diced green chiles, so I just put salsa verde instead, and it's great.  Also, the KEY to me for any enchiladas is using CORN TORTILLAS.  It adds so much more flavor.  I also use much more shredded cheese (I'm from WI...we love cheese!)

I've been grilling for a couple years now, but I recently decided to occasionally relieve my wife of some of her indoor cooking duties. I'm a complete novice, as in I often have to ask her what pans to use. This is the first recipe I tried, and as God is my witness, she asked my why her food didn't smell this good. I used regular onions instead of green and a larger can of chilies, but I basically followed the recipe verbatim. Yum.

This recipe is great jumping off point for whatever you like. I used corn tortillas. I also used the Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup...yum! and I added fresh diced mushrooms, cumin and a splash of hot sauce-Cholula of course. I wanted to lick the bowl after filling up my tortillas. Loved by all and super quick to get it in the oven.

This was alright. My brother-in-law really enjoyed them but I thought they we're too salty. Might try them again but make some alterations. Left out the chili's.

I followed this recipe exactly. My husband thought it was ok, I thought it presented well, had good texture and was filling but was very bland. It needs to be kicked up with seasoning.

Good recipe! Not too spicy to serve to my little girls(five and 2) but enough flavor for my thirteen year old son. I used leftover roasted chicken which had McCormicks Herbs de Provence on them, but not an overpowering taste. I mixed in cooked Vidalia onion(half a small one), 4 garlic cloves minced and sauteed with onion, and a can of rinsed black beans to the sauce and spread half in my Crockpot. I filled the burritos(small taco size) with chicken mixed with a Mexican blend(had yellow cheddar in it) and slightly thawed frozen yellow corn. After rolling all of the burritos up and lining them up in the Crockpot, I covered with more sauce and Kraft's blend of Mexican all white cheese. Also I had used a larger(35%) can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom in the sauce so they wouldn't dry out in Crockpot. I cooked on high for two hours and served with sour cream and chopped black olives. Before serving, I mixed some McCormicks ground chipotle pepper into the sauce that i put over my son's, husband's, and mine but not for the girls, because as my two year old would say, "It's too bicy!"(spicy).

I've never made chicken enchiladas, but I wanted to try it. I ended up shredding my chicken instead of cubing as I love the shredded texture. I would add more sauce, but in the end, my family couldn't stop eating and eating. So this was definitely a winnder!!!

Very good! My husband doesn't like the traditional red sauce.  I use both flour and corn because it's different texture. Instead of lightly frying the corn tortillas, I wrap them in a wet towel and microwave them for a minute or so. This makes them easier to roll. If I need to stretch the recipe I add rice to the mixture. And I love the cumin!!!

Mm, so good! I've made these three times now and they don't get old. I double the green chiles because otherwise you hardly know they're there, and I use cream of chicken instead of mushroom, and I add extra chicken because 1 and 1/2 cups is not very much for a whole pan. But the bottom line is this is a good recipe that only needs minor tweaking.

I have to give this 4 stars instead of 5 as I altered the recipe by adding a teaspoon of Taco seasoning ( recipe on this site) to the chicken . I felt it needed something. This is a good 'basic' recipe that can be modified to suit your family's preferences. My husband and I as well as our 18m old, enjoyed our dinner! I won't be ordering this at a Mexican restaurant again! Thanks for the recipe.

I enjoyed this particular dish.  I used corn tortillas instead of flour, and left out the green chiles (personal preference).  It was bland, but that's because I didn't use any other spice.  That was my fault!  But overall, I thought this was a good dish.

Fabulous enchiladas.  I prepare it all in the morning and put it in oven when come home from work.
Changes I made:  saute cubed chicken breast in olive oil and added chopped yellow onion.  Lastly, I at least double the cheese using Mexican cheese mix.

Scaled this for 8 enchiladas, using 2 cans green chiles, 1/2 large onion (sauteed), a cup and a half of sour cream, 1 can of condensed cream of chicken and a can and a half of milk to thin it as the tortillas absorb a lot of liquid when cooking. This recipe is very flexible, flavorful and a family favorite. I can stretch the chicken with leftover rice, corn and/or beans and its still a delicious and fairly fast dinner that my family loves.

Very tasty. I used left over chicken and used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom soup.  I like mine with a little more zip, so I just added salsa on top at the table. Will make again. Thanks for sharing this delicious simple recipe!

Great quick recipe. I jazzed it up a little with some chopped fresh cilantro. The sauce was a little thick for me so I added some chicken stock to the sauce after it was divided. I also opted for corn tortillas. Will have to double the recipe next time, didn't have any leftovers.

We are fans! Delicious and easy to modify. I made one batch like the recipe but left the chilies out (I'm not really into the texture chilis) but added chilli powder and some cajun seasoning to give it some kick (because I love the flavor). The other half of the batch I put in green chilis for my boyfriend, and topped with enchilada sauce just to have some options. Both came out great!

I'm giving this 3 stars based on the way the recipe is written. 4 stars with my adjustments.  I took other reviewers suggestions and made some changes.  I doubled the sauce but kept the chicken the same amount.  I added a can of corn (drained and rinsed) and a can of black beans (drain and rinsed).  In an attempt to feed a family of 6 on a budget I always try and stretch our dollar !  I added some taco seasoning to the filling and to the sauce I added 1 19 ounce can of red enchilada sauce.  Again trying to streeeetch the dollar !  I did find the cream of mushroom soup taste a bit off putting but it wasn't terrible.  Next time I might use cream of chicken like others had suggested.  This is an excellent dish to put together quickly and store in fridge or freezer for later on in the week.  Thanks teppij !!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it's so easy and inexpensive.  I made it exactly as written (I used flour tortillas but I understand from other reviewers that enchiladas should be made with corn tortillas)  Next time I'll try the corn ones.  The green chilies really make these good - don't omit them!

This was actually a fun recipes to make and very easy. I added a small can of mushrooms, but it could use more spices for flavor. There was no way this mixture would fill up 6 12" flour tortillas. I only was able to fill 6 6". I will be making again!

Pretty easy recipe. Not to spicy. Green chiles are mild. I do take it easy with the green onion. :) I make this with Spanish or Mexican rice as a side.

Just delicious and I also made them with the corn instead of flour and tasted very good.  The meat ws juicey because I put it in the oven with tin foil over it and cooked it low for about a hour.  Great recipe family loved it.  Will make it again soon!!!

I made this as written, just doubling the recipe.  It's very good, although I think the next time I might add some jalepenos for a little more spice.  This recipe is a keeper!

These are pretty good!  I switched the cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken and did half flour tortilla and half corn.  I prefer the corn.

YUM! Next time, double the filling recipe. We also added 1/2 can of diced jalapenos...that amount will be okay if we double the filling. Definitely made it spicy! Also added chili powder to filling. Used 1/2 cup milk. That was good.

This was definitely a good recipe, I found it to be a bit bland. I had even added 2 jalapenos. I would suggest adding a spice or two. Still a great recipe.

Very quick and easy to make, yet breaks you out of the same old enchilada mold. Easy to alter according to your tastes as well. Will be making this again and again :) Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This is just okay. I added cayenne and cumin as suggested and used 6 inch flour tortillas (all that was available). Followed everything else exactly and only had enough chicken mixture to fill 5 tortillas and they were swimming in the sauce. Don't think I'll make this again.

I thought this was really good overall. I substituted cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. It needed a little salt. So perhaps garlic salt instead of garlic powder. I made two batches one for my parents who had company coming over. They both wanted the recipe!

This didn't taste BAD, but I really wish I had read the reviews before making. The sauce needs to be doubled & thinned with more milk or stock/broth, more chicken needs to be added (or some other filler; corn, beans, bell peppers, etc), and I would definitely recommend smaller tortillas. I added extra chicken, and still barely had enough filling for 4 tortillas. I doubled the milk, and still didn't quite have enough sauce to cover the enchiladas. Sauce should be put under the enchiladas; the tortillas were very tough on the bottom. The mushroom flavour was almost overpowering. To compensate, we added fresh cilantro to the sauce, and topped with fresh avocado, & salsa. It was alright. I could see this being a good dish to cook for picky kids. Fairly mild as written.

This was a great recipe, and didnt take long at all.
I did revamp it a bit to make it health friendly.
I used fat free- sour cream, chedder cheese, and lowfat cream of mushroom and NO butter. No milk. Also added some cummin for flavor to the mix.. The consistancy was perfect!
Oh! and whole wheat, low carb, tortillas.
Gonna dig in.
Ciao.

i have made this dish a few times with some adjustments. 

My favorite variant is leaving out the green chiles and using cream of chicken rather than mushroom.

I had to change this up to suit our picky needs. I cooked chicken in crock pot all day with some beef broth, onion pdr, garlic, pdr, chili pdr, salt and pepper. Turned out delicious and super moist. I made Cream Soup Base from this site and added in 1/2 cup cream cheese along with more chili pdr, salt and pepper. Thinned out with a touch of milk. I also layed down a thin layer of taco sauce before putting the enchiladas in the pan. Awesome!!!

Really good.  I didn't have sour cream so I used cottage cheese- tasted the same.  also, I added the green (green chili) enchilada sauce to the topping.  For the soup I didn't have cream of mushroom so used cream of celery---it worked!  I also added sauteed onions to the filling.  It turned our great

Great base recipe. I seasoned the chicken with a chipoltle seasoning I had. I also used mexican cheese rather than the cheddar and melted it right into the sauce and put some inside of the enchiladas also. very tasty. I will use this recipe for a lot of experimenting.

This was a great hit at my house.  My dad even loved it and he's not a chicken fan at all.  The only thing I would do differently is add another can of cream of chicken soup to make more sauce, but if you're one who doesn't like a ton of sauce then the original amount should be fine.

A friend shared this recipe with me a few years ago and I've served it many times, always with great compliments.  Made it once for an office potluck and the (Hispanic) receptionist stated, "These are REALLY good! and that's from your resident Mexican."

I served this at my daughter's graduation party and everyone loved it. My friend's four year old asked me to give his mommy the recipe. :)  I used the cream of mushroom soup and instead of mixing milk in with the reserved sauce I used green enchilada sauce.

Mmm I absolutely adore mexican food, and this recipe hits the spot... my Nana has a authentic enchilada recipe from a old lady in mexico that she brought back to Canada after one of her many travels, and it tastes *exactly* like this...
I fry the tortillas, double the sauce, and use cream of chicken soup!

Great recipe. For the chicken, however, I put two chicken breasts in a crock pot with a bottle of salsa the day before so I would have shredded spicy chicken on hand. Other than that...delish!

GREAT, thanks for sharing. This is what I did different. I used corn tortillas microwaved under a damp paper towel for 30 sec, used minced garlic in place of the powder. Used cream of chicken (all that I had on hand). Used chopped jalapenos about a 1/3d cup. Had about a cup or so of store bought hot salsa, added that.

The meal was a hit. The wife and kid even did the clean up for me if I make it again this weekend.

Easy to make. Tastes great = 5 stars

Made this last night and was very pleased.  Made a few changes that others might find useful.  I used fresh chopped garlic instead of garlic powder and sauteed them with the onions.  Like many other reviewers I went with corn instead of flour totillas, just seem to make more sense.  Since I like spicier dishes I used (2) 4 oz. cans of Ortega 'Hot' diced chilies (they really arn't that hot).  Also used 1 cup of caned sweet kernal corn, this added a very nice texture and the flavor blended well with the chilies.  Instead of milk I substituted heavy cream, what can I say I cook for flavor and not for my health.  I would definitely make this again.

Yummy.  I agree with previous reviews that the sauce should be doubled and some spices added (oregano, cilantro, etc).  Regarding the tortillas, I too prefer the corn, and there's an even simpler way around the problem of making them pliable.  I make *layered* enchiladas, building them like lasagna.  I do spray the corn tortillas with nonstick cooking spray or brush them with a little olive oil, because they taste better that way.  Then layer in the baking pan as follows:  enough sauce to just cover the bottom, then the flat tortillas, sauce, cheese, repeat.

Not overly tasty. Almost bland. I should have spiced it up some and added some jalapeno's and maybe some red pepper. I won't be making it again though so it doesn't matter. The flour tortillas didn't help this recipe. Should have used corn.

This beats out my mom's recipe!  She always used regular onions, which usually makes kids shy away.  The green onions give it some colour, and a milder flavour.  
Couldn't stop smiling when we were eating this.

love it love it. The only thing I have to change is to not had so many chillies, my poor girls thought it was too spicy. My husband and I on the other hand loved it! Thanks so muc for taking a boring work night dinner and turning it into something kinda special. :)

Yum! But I will admit that I change several ingredients...I substitute a few cloves of garlic for the onions (my pregnant tummy can't stand onions!), and heat chili powder and cumin with them in the oil (per another reviewer's recommendation). I also substitute a chicken stock roux for the cream of mushroom soup (that stuff is pretty bad for you). I also substitute canned beans (black or kidney) for some of the chicken, to save money. But I love the method for this recipe and always use it to help me put together my enchiladas!

Following some of the review information I made this recipe the first time with corn tortillas instead of flour, added no milk and used 1 can each of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken ..per recipe.  My family flipped over them...thinking they were the best they had ever eaten.  The second time I used flour tortillas... practically no flavor.  my husband said why did I have to ruin a good thing! ...so only corn tortillas from now on....and a happy hubby

Followed the recipe exactly.  It wasn't inedible, but I will not be making again.  I had doubts when I reviewed the recipe (cream of mushroom soup in enchiladas?) but was intrigued by the ratings/reviews and decided to make anyway.  My husband and I agree that this is not a keeper.

Even though I agree that it didn't quite strike me as being like any enchilada I've ever had, I really liked the flavor. It was a bit too creamy but that is probably my fault since I just cooked a pound of chicken instead of measuring 1 1/2 cups. we'll make this again!

These are addicting.  I don't care if you call it enchilada, burrito, taco, or just dinner - very good recipe and you will be glad you made it!  I follow the recipe exactly, except for doubling it to make more, and every time they are a hit. My husband even requested them as his birthday dinner!

This is a definite keeper!  We've made it four times, for four different people, and everyone always raves about it.  We like the corn tortillas instead of flour...just make sure to warm them before stuffing with the filling, otherwise they'll crack.

Everyone in my house ate some, which is no small feat.  To save time, I used a can of white meat chicken breast from Sam's Club.  This only filled 5 large tortillas, but was plenty for two adults and two small children.  I also substituted Cream of Chicken for the Cream of Mushroom.  I will definitely make this again!

Forgot the milk but it turned out really nice.  Used about two cups chopped chicken because after I sautéed two breasts that's how much I had.

I made these and tried half flour tortillas and half corn tortillas to see what we liked best.  Everyone at our table voted for the corn tortillas and we wished we would have had more of the corn! The corn tortillas are a must!! I will never return to flour tortillas for enchiladas.  It changes the whole experience. Go corn tortillas!

This was quite good!  I've never made chicken enchiladas and I was impressed with the results.  I omitted the green chiles (not a fan of spicy food and had none on hand either).  I doubled the ingredients at the suggestion of other reviewers.  I sauteed the green onions in butter as directed and simultaneously browned my chicken in the butter as well.  I seasoned the chicken with paprika, onion and garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken with my cup of sour cream.  I also added a splash of chicken broth and a can of rotel to the sauce.  I browned my white corn tortillas in extra virgin olive oil before assembling my enchiladas.  All in all, the dish came out out very good.  Will definitely make again! :-D

These enchiladas were ok...I prefer red sauce, so that's probably why I didn't enjoy them as much as everyone else.  (too creamy for my taste)  I didn't have the green chiles, so used diced japs instead, giving the perfect amount of heat.  Would have been way too bland without them.  I'm unsure if I liked the cream of mushroom soup or not.  Will prob use all sour cream next time and add cilantro because they were missing a little "flavor."  Perfect for people that like milder dishes.

OMG!  This was soo good!  I am not a huge fan of tomatoes, so this recipe was great.  Of course made a few changes...Added cumin, chili powder and taco seasoning to the chicken to give it flavor.  We like sauce, so I used 2 cans of soup and added more sour cream to taste as well as green chilis.  Lastly, I used EVOO instead of butter and corn tortillas.  Definitely will make again.

I can't eat tomatoes or many of the spices that are in traditional Mexican food.  These enchiladas hit the spot when I am craving something a little Mexican.  I leave out the green chilis and substitute a couple dashes of cayenne pepper for heat.  They are so good - even my picky husband likes them!  If you like, for extra flavor you could add a packet of taco seasoning to the chicken.

Pretty good as is, I think next time I'll add a little bit more of the diced green chiles, to make it a little spicier (just a personal preference)

Wow, I am a little disappointed, followed the recipe exactly and it was not the 4 1/2 stars I expected.  I should have went with my gut and used corn tortillas.

This is my third review ever! Highly worth trying at least and recipe could stand on it's own without adjustments IMO. I have ate MANY forms of enchiladas in my life, being from just North of the Mexican border. I typically make enchiladas with corn tortillas like others have mentioned but there is a trick to making these enchiladas less "soft" or 'burrito like' without the hassle of frying corn tortillas. Lightly brush the rolled  flour enchiladas with some olive oil before pouring mixture on them. Bake for 7ish minutes, remove and then pour mixture over it with added cheese and bake for remaining time. Gives it more hardness without overdoing it. I doubled this recipe and was able to make 20 no problem using soft taco shells. I also used chicken breast slow cooked for 2 hours in a mixture of adobo seasoning and a packet of 'white chicken chili' seasoning with 1.5 cups of water covered with foil in the oven at 355. I would definitely make this again, this has become my new favorite enchilada recipe!!!

It was very good. I put chicken breast in the crock pot with mexican seasoning for high 4hours and shreded it insted of cubed chicken. also saute chopped mushroom and green onions. I also used Mild Enchilada source to pour over the enchilada, then sprinkle cheese.

Pretty good.  I used corn tortillas instead of flour.  I think there is too much sour cream in the sauce though.  I'll probably cut it by a 1/3 or so..  Oh, I also added a can of hot rotel to the sauce and would do so again.

My family and I love this recipe.  I did make some changes though and we typically double the recipe because everyone loves the leftovers.  We use 1 can FF cream of mushroom soup and 1 can FF cream of chicken soup.  We also use light sour cream and 2% chedder cheese.  In my opinion, you can't tell the difference when using the lighter ingrediants and it saves so many calories and fat. Sometimes to spice it up a little I will add 1 can drained rotel to the chicken mix.  We serve with rice and it makes an excellent meal!

The amount of chicken recommended in this recipe seems to be way too little... I could hardly do 2 full-size burritos with it. I would recommend at least doubling it for the same serving size.

Thought these were quite good. I just threw in half a jalapeno instead of the chilis which was a little over kill, but still tasty.  The filling seemed a little scanty, however.  Per other reviewer suggestions, added extra garlic and chili powder to enhance the flavors.  Also added a little olive oil when sauteeing the onions as there really wasn't enough butter to keep from burning while they cooked.

I was very skeptical of the high rating on this recipe.  I'm used to tomato-based enchiladas, so the ingedients seemed a little weird to me.  Boy was I ever wrong, these are the most delicious enchiladas ever, the diced green chiles really pull the flavors together.  I followed the recipe exactly and the smell as it was baking was wonderful, my next door neighbor asked if she could come over for dinner.  And this recipe makes wonderful leftovers, as with a lot of dishes, the flavors just get better when they are allowed to set overnight in your refrigerator.  Take them to lunch the next day, you'll be the envy of your coworkers.

I've made these several times for my family and we all love them.  Obviously, this is not an "authentic" enchilada recipe but really who cares when it tastes this good?!

*****UPDATE*****

I made these last night with a half a packet of taco seasoning and some water mixed in with the chicken... A-Mazing!  Added a ton of flavor and a little spicy kick but the creaminess still made it mild enough for the rugrats.  So good!

This is a great recipe. The only change I made was that I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic, corn tortillas and mexican blend cheese. It is still in the oven but I sampled it and its awesome. I thought maybe the chiles would be too hot, but honestly they just add flavor not heat, my kids really like the sample of the sauce. Great recipe! Thanks!

Very good recipe! Made it for 10 but could've used another can of Chilis. It would've made it a little more Mexican flavored.

These were amazing.  It made only about 4 small enchiladas and I followed the recipe exact.  It could use just a tad more spicy, but I like my food really spicy.  I loved these.  Thanks so much.

Very tasty! I don't like spicy so these mild enchiladas were perfect. Of course you can always add more spice if that's your thing.  My only complaint is that there wasn't enough sauce adequately stuff and cover the enchiladas so I would maybe add a bit more of the ingredients in the future as they came out a bit dry on top.  I will definitely be making this again!

Love this recipe! It's very versatile and I have made it without some of the ingredients, or with extra too. Extremely tasty, pretty quick, and filling. My husband and brother love this dish and always want me to make it! We have our own special name for it and change it up quite often.

Super easy, quick, dinner option! I exchanged the green onions for sauteed sweet onion, I ommited the green chillies (I have young kiddos), but added corn and topped with a small bit of fresh cilantro! Oh, and used corn tortillas.... much more traditional mexican dish! It was a hit!! Yum!

I've made these twice now and they are a hit in my household.  Easy to make, creamy and delish.  The only thing I did differently was use a whole chicken that I boiled and separated the meat from the bones.

These were just okay for us. Not a lot of flavor. I thought it was a bit wierd to use soup in an enchilada recipe but I was on a time restraint and this recipe seemed quick, so I gave it a whirl. I used cream of chicken soup. Cream of mushroom just doesn't sound right. I also used jack cheese instead of cheddar and added some cumin and coriander. They were pretty good but not outstanding. Don't know if I would make again.

I followed this recipe and loved it.  I think next time I will make the following few changes: use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, add a can of black beans to the mixture, and use a white cheese sause instead of of chedder cheese.

I used smaller corn tortillas, and was only able to make 7 in total.  Next time I will double the recipe.  I also used only half of the green chiles - the flavor was present, but not overpowering.  Turned out great!

I've been making this for the past few years and always found them to be a hit.  I don't saute the green onions-- just dump them in;  and often will add cilantro.  Sometimes I omit the green chiles and instead add a 1/2 cup of salsa for spice.  I usually end up making more of the sauce than is called for in order to get large-sized enchiladas.

I make these all the time using low fat sour cream, whole wheat tortillas, rotisserie chicken and always add a can of black beans into the filling. Even with these changes they are very rich and satisfying!

Very good I used rotisserie ckn. Always more flavor. Also refried beans on the bottom of the tortilla. I'm not crazy about the bits of mushroom in the soup so I put in the blender first.  Another great way to use up leftover ckn.  Next time I think I'll try it with cream of chicken soup.

I have made a dish simular to this one. I used ground beef and after I was done browning the beef I mixed Salsa in with the beef. I then rolled the beef mixture into flour tortillas and placed them in a cassarole dish. I mixed cream of chicken soup with sour cream and green chilis and poured it over top of the tortillas. I then baked it for 30 mins and then added cheese on top and baked it until the cheese was warm and bubbly. this is a very good recipe and its not too spicy. Perfect when you have little kids who will be eating it also like I do!!

This is a great alternative. I'm not really a fan of the red sauce that's why I never attempted to make enchiladas. I didn't use green chile because my daughter wouldn't like it and I think next time I will use fresh garlic and italian ground turkey and corn tortillas. We thought that the chicken was a little bland.

These enchiladas have very good flavor.  I did not fry my tortillas shells, I think I will brown them next time.  I also didn't tuck in the ends, which would have made them easier to handle!!  I will definately make again.  (I used a rotesserie chicken from the grocery store)

These are a winner!  I do use cream of chicken soup, a de-boned rotisserie chicken, corn tortillas, I have used no fat cream cheese in place of the sour cream or low fat sour cream, no fat cheese is easy to use also....YUMMY!

This was delicious, definitely a dish I will make again.  Based on the many reviews of it, I did make some changes to the recipe.  For the chicken, once it was cooked, I added chicken taco seasoning to spice it up.  I doubled the sauce and used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.  Then, instead of adding milk to the sauce I added 3/4 C salsa.  I covered the pan while cooking for the first 30 minutes then uncovered for the last five.  It was great to serve along with my beef enchiladas so our guest had a choice of chicken or beef.

Definitely a favorite. I cheated big time, and made modifications as well based on the reviews. We hate corn tortillas so flour tortilla enchilada/burritos were fabulous. Plus, I cheated on the prep and used my crock pot. I used 1 can of cream of mushroom (98% reduced fat), 1 can of cream of chicken (98% reduced fat), 1 can of green chiles, and 1/2 packet of fajita seasoning, 1/2 cup of Light sour cream, 1/3 cup of diced onion, 1/2 cup of non-fat milk, mixed all together thrown in crock pot. I used 2 large boneless/skinless chicken breast halves, threw them in the crockpot frozen. Cooked on HIGH for 3.5 hours, stirring occasionally. Added 1 cup of mexican flavored shredded cheese variety to the soup mixture, removed chicken and shredded it with 2 forks then returned to the crockpot for 30 minutes while I prepped the tortillas (microwaved for 1 minute with water spritzed on them). I sprayed(with non-stick spray) a casserole dish, poured some chicken flavored spicy rice on the bottom of the dish, and then rolled the chicken/soup mixture in 6 /8inch flour tortillas. Placed them seam side down, then covered with remaining soup mixture, and chunked cheddar and mozzarella cheese. Placed in the over for 15 minutes. VIOLA a family favorite. Even my picky, won't eat any type of mexican food husband loved these. He's happy to take them to work tomorrow for leftovers. Served with a little salsa, and sour cream.

So Delicious!  I doubled the recipe so we'd have leftovers during the week, just bought two rotisserie chickens and pulled all the meat off.  Also subed half the sour cream with plain yogurt for less calories.  Added a can of diced tomatoes w/green chilis (drained).  Took other recommendations and used corn tortillas instead of flour, which was definitely a good change and added more flavor.  Totally recommend this recipe!

Woodangela.  Flour tortillas are perfect for enchiladas and I prefer them.  The only problem with this recipe is theat is uses canned  soup.  Say what?

This was very good...I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper,cumin, and chilli powder before cooking for some extra flavor and also used motz. cheese instead of ched.

I really like this recipe. Everything comes together really well. I made a few changes. The first change was with the tortillas. Enchiladas are made with corn tortillas not flour. The first time I used flour just to see how it tasted and I did not like it at all. Second, I use red onions rather than green. Last, I put cheese in the enchiladas and on top. Thanks for sharing this. This has become one of my family's favorites!

These are the best enchiladas I've ever had. The sour cream based cheese sauce is to die for! I make two changes: 1) I double the sauce so there is plenty to cover the enchiladas with, and 2) I add some taco seasoning to the shredded chicken for a little kick.

My Family loves this recipe! I did change the soup to cream of Chicken and used enchilade sauce instead of milk. Also add 1/2 teaspoon of cumin. My son ask for this every time he comes home from college. It's his favorite.

Awesome and easy.  Made a few changes per other users suggestions.  I didn't have green onions so i used regular, used cream of chicken instead of mushroom, and i mixed in 1 pack of cheesy taco seasoning mix.  After i put everything together i also added 1 cup of enchilada sauce on top.  Tasted great!

This recipe was great... I made it with one diced jalapeno (could have added one more and would have been fine) other than that it was too the book. Next time however, I am going to add more cream soup so there is more sauce on the inside of the tortilla.

These are the BOMB!!!  I have made them 4-5 times now.  They are a favorite of my friends and family now.  I added some canned jalapenos and crushed red pepper when I wanted a bit of heat.  I have made it with cream of chicken and cream of mushroom.  It's good both ways. For a party I doubled the recipe and used a can of each...best of both worlds.  I had some plain yogurt to use up and used that instead of sour cream.  Tasted great.  ENJOY!

All I can say is YUM!. I added a few more spices as we like it spicier, red peppers etc.. Great taste! The only thing I thought it was a little soupy. Maybe next time I will cut the soup part down to a half of a cup. Ohterwise Very tasty!

Doubled the recipe, filled 10 tortilla's, followed the recipe exactly, and these were great!  O.K., so I might have added a bit extra cheese on the top, but other then that small change, this recipe rocks as-is!  Will make again, in fact, already did!

Oh, wow!  This recipe rocks!!!  I use the rotisserie chicken from Sams and I also use white corn tortillas dipped in hot oil. As suggested by other reviewers, we added taco seasoning however my husband accidentally bought cheesy or cheddar taco seasoning (never even heard of it), so I didn't add any shredded cheese to the mix, just on top of the casserole.  My family loves this and my picky 11yr old thought this was amazing! Thank you, thank you!

I love these!! The first try, my husband made a comment saying they werent real enchiladas.  Then he tried it and wouldnt stop saying how great it is.  He then even went to work and talked about how delish it is.  The only changes I use - I use taco seasoning on the chicken and then I add a little extra to the sauce.  And I use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom.  Its absolutely delicious!  We eat this meal once a week.

These are a hit every single time I make them.  I sub a mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar and mince fresh garlic.  I also add more jalapenos for extra kick.

This was absolutely delicious!  I did add some diced red peppers and half of a jalapeno.  I used cheddar and pepper jack cheese too.  I also used light Sour Cream and 2% milk.  My husband is a fairly picky and honest eater.  HE ATE IT UP!  No leftovers here and I can't wait to make it again.

I thought they were wonderful!  I boiled the chicken in broth for over an hour before shredding it, and added a little minced garlic in while it boiled.  This gave it a little more flavor.  Everyone loved these- and they were easy to make!  I might try corn tortillas next time- just based on some other reviews!

Good recipe- Used a couple fresh garlic cloves, can of Rotel (instead of the green chiles), yellow & green onion, extra sour cream & a SMALL amount of cumin.  Also added some of the Rotel juice and left out the milk.

Really good.  Even the kids love this.  I did use cream of chicken soup & more cheese on top.

Yummy, easy, creamy enchiladas! We're not fans of spicy food, so this mild version is great comfort food. I usually use leftover rotisserie chicken, which makes it a snap to put together.

Awesome! My Mom is a huge fan of mexican food so I made this for her birthday. I used fajita seasoning instead of those listed and I used green chilies enchilada sauce instead of the diced green chilies. I also added a can of cream of chicken soup. I used Tyson fajita chicken strips to make it quickly. My mom loved it and said it tasted better than at restaurants. Great recipe!!!

Fantastic recipe, although not perfectly authentic (corn tortilla=enchilada, flour=burrito). I used leftovers from a rotisserie chicken and it turned out great!  A few adjustments based off taste and what was on hand:  We like it spicy, so for a doubled recipe, I used the 2 cans chiles plus 1/4 cup of Red Devil sauce, 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of cheese, cut the cheddar cheese down to 1.5 cups, and did everything else as written.  12 enchiladas and 5 people, but they all went!  Many hands make filling and rolling easier.  Also, be sure to heat the tortillas so they don't crack--toss them in the microwave with a wet paper towel for 30 seconds, or heat with a little oil in a cast iron skillet.  Buen provecho!

We make enchiladas pretty often and this recipe was so good...just the change we needed from our boring recipe.  :)  We used flour tortillas because they're easier to fold and they turned out great!

I followed the recipe as written, and it was delicious. We had avocado and tomato slices, salsa, sour cream, and refried beans with the enchilladas . . . yummy! I only managed to get 5 enchilladas (rather than 6) from the recipe, but perhaps I just like mine a bit bigger than is really necessary. I will definitely make this again, and when I do, I might also try adding a few more green chilies.

This was delicious!!  I used leftover chicken and made a 5 star meal.  I didn't have any green onions so I used reg onion, but only to taste.  And this meal was good for lunch the next day.

I have made these several times - the kids love them! They are a regular part of my OAMC rotation. I assemble the burritos, put about six to a gallon freezer bag, and freeze the extra sauce in a smaller bag. I've also cooked them completely with the sauce!

This is my first time making enchiladas and I was a bit unimpressed by the cream of mushroom soup flavour, but that was probably my fault for choosing a recipe that included cream of mushroom soup and not something a bit more authentic.

Great recipe. Will make again, though I didn't use the green chiles (unfortunately my husband got the wrong thing), it still came out quite tasty. I went out of town for the weekend and dh had some friends over, and they literally scarfed down all the left overs and said it was AMAZING. They even begged him to ask for the recipe.

This was too runny. I didn't like tasting sour cream as the main ingredient. I should have used refried beans instead.

I was my first time making Enchiladas as my husband is not a big fan of Mexican food.  I tweaked the recipe a bit as I found that the filling is not enough for 6 pieces of tortillas. First for health reasons, I substituted the butter with olive oil.  Upped to 2 cups of shredded chicken breast meat and 2 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder.  Also added a cup of diced sweet onion.  When I realised that the filling was not enough for even 4 pieces of tortillas, I added a cup of mixed peas and corn to the filling at the last minute.  Delicious! Sorry tyeppij, I also had to up the baking time to an hour as 35 minutes was way too short for the sauce to thicken.  My husband gives this recipe a 5* (I have yet to tell him what exactly this recipe is, for right now, he has been told it's called "Chicken Wrap"!)

I found this to be a very easy and tasty meal.  I added 1/2 cup of salsa to the sauce mixture.  I also substituted chopped green bell pepper for the green chiles just because it was what I had.  My husband LOVED this dish, and finished off all of the leftovers for lunch the next day!!

Read the reviews before I made this and saw that several people didn't have enough filling so I went very sparingly on how much I put in each tortilla wrap thinking I could stretch it and I was only able to come out with five.  The taste is very good but every bite had too much tortilla and hardly no filling.  Next time I make it I think I will have to triple the filling to fill them the way an enchilada should be or use the smaller tortilla wraps not sure which.

I would agree with doubling the sauce, I did and still only filled 6 tortillas. Also I can’t help but to top it up with one small can of enchilada sauce… it just adds that little bit more. Love the recipe though.

Excellent! Exactly what my husband and I were looking for in a chicken enchilada recipe!  And I'm not sure what other reviewers were thinking, but we loved the flour tortillas- definitely wouldn't change that.  We added a can of enchilada sauce instead of milk because it gave it a richer flavor.  That's all we changed and it was wonderful!

I made a few changes and it came out really good! My husband who is hard to please told me it tasted like restaraunt style enchiladas!    I added 3/4 cup chopped green bell peppers and sauted that with the green onion for about 4-5 minutes until the bell peppers were tender. Instead of using cream of mushroom soup I used one 24 oz can of green enchilada sauce.  In the sauce mixture I added the 10 oz of the enchilada sauce and also put 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese into that and (and also what the recipe alls for).  The rest of it I pourd over the top of the enchiladas when they were rolled up and placed in the pan.  Then I used 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese and mozerella cheese and sprinkled that ontop of the enchiladas and baked for 25 minutes!    Yum!  I hope this helps anyone! I will definitely make this one again!

Made this for dinner tonight with changes recommended by 79SHALE97, and they were the  best homemade enchiladas I've ever tasted. They tasted like restaurant quality. My mother-in-law said they were the best enchiladas she's ever had. I'll definitely be making this again.

FABULOUS! My husband is the pickiest eater, especially when it comes to enchiladas. He agrees with me...these are the best enchiladas we've had! However, there was not enough filling to fill 6 12" tortillas. I will do as other reviews have suggested and double the filling. Thanks so much!

These were very good! A very different twist on enchiladas, but we enjoyed them. I did fry my tortillas in vegetable oil before assembling the enchiladas because I just can't get enough of that fried, crispy tortilla taste. I can watch calories some other day. I used fresh garlic and added a generous amount of cumin.  Instead of only using 1/4 of the sauce in the tortillas, I combined the chicken and cheese with all the sauce and used ALL of it inside them. I poured green enchilada sauce on top of the rolled tortillas, then added the shredded cheese. Very good. Thank you :)

this is great version of chicken enchilada's. it is a wonderful "left-over" chicken recipe too. i almost prefer the chicken to be shredded, like from your left over rotisserie, or bone in chicken. not the usual enchilada's i'm used to, but i really enjoyed the creamy mushroom sauce. will definitely be making this one again.

These were the BEST homemade enchiladas we've had yet!! A+! The only difference i made was that i sauted the cubed chicken with the onions, peppers, and butter. It makes the chicken taste amazing!

Love this recipe! I cannot eat Enchiladas in Mexican Restaurants anymore. I have tried with both the flour tortillas and the white corn tortillas. Either way it is fabulous. The flour is a little bit creamier and blends in with the sauce. While the corn stands out. When I used the corn I warmed them in a pan until the bubbled and then dipped them in heavy whipping cream. I did not have a can of green chilies so I went ahead and chopped up some pickled peppercinies, yellow banana peppers. and sweet cherry peppers. The cherry peppers added a nice splash of red. I also added some Monterey Jack cheese to the top and pepper jack cheese to the filling.

these were amazing. me and my boyfriend cooked them and they were delish! we used basic chicken breasts (2-4oz) that he pan cooked and then cut up to smaller pieces. i've shredded chicken before to make enchiladas, but to me its a little more work. If you have chicken breasts on hand I'd say there is no need for a rotisserie chicken like some of the reviewers suggest.   maybe the only thing I would do differently is make more of the sour cream sauce.   no need for all the frills this recipe is perfect as is.

This is one of the easiest meals to prepare. It is delicious and comforting.  Sometimes I vary the cheeses or add in mixed veggies.  Once I even added some fresh tomatoes in.  Whatever I do to this recipe it always comes out really good!

WOW, these were delicious!  I think this is the best tasting enchiladas and for me, I prefer the flour tortilla over corn. However, I did add half of envelope of taco seasoning to my chicken mixture and omitting green chiles.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I took this to a Mexican themed potluck at church and the dish was completely cleaned out!  I added a can of diced tomatoes with chiles, but for the most part left the rest alone.  I fiddled with the filling to get more out of it, so I'm sure it wasn't exact.  Definitely a keeper though!

Pretty tasty, although the creaminess can be overwhelmingly rich.  I think that part of my problem was that I did a poor job of dividing the filling evenly, and so some of the enchiladas were quite large--by the time you try to plow through one of those, it is a bit much!

This recipe was amazing! But of course, I made a few of my own changes. To start off with, I used white corn torillas. I heated a bit of olive oil in a pan, and cooked each side of the tortilla for just a few seconds to soften them. In place of the green onions, I used mushrooms to taste. For the sauce I used half cream of muchroom soup and a half can of cream of chicken. When adding the sour cream, I used half sour cream, half cream cheese (that turned out much better than you'd think)! When adding cheese, I added it throughout the cooking process, to taste. I topped the enchiladas with half cheddar and half pepper jack. I only had to bake mine at 350º for maybe 10 - 15 minutes, and cranked the oven to about 400º and cooked for another 5 minutes or so. Thanks for a good recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly, thought it was fantastic and easy.  I made a more complicated recipe similar to this one (had to roast the peppers on an open flame and hand peel them etc).  This one tasted just as good with half the effort.  This one is a keeper.

Very very good. I used 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup along with a whole can of cream of chicken soup. This was just enough to have enough sauce. Sprinkled red pepper flakes on top for some spice. Next time I would take the advice of others and add some taco seasoning for a little more flavor along with maybe refried beans. Yum.

I found this recipe to be tasty enough but not 5 star - which was disappointing because I was really looking forward to it.  I poached and shredded 2 chicken breasts and used cream of chicken because my husband doesn't like mushrooms and a shredded mexican cheese blend because I had it on hand - it made 5 large enchiladas which was more than enough, but the recipe is missing something. I might try taco seasoning in the sauce.

These enchiladas are amazing!  I've tried other chicken enchilada recipes and this was definetely the best. I didn't use the cream of mushroom soup, and instead used cream of chicken.  The result was still very good!

Ok so I know that you aren't supposed to change the recipe, but this is a great recipe to not rate! All I do is double the sauce and throw in a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes. If you want it spicier, add cayenne pepper/red pepper flakes to the sauce. That's it... other than that it's an awesome recipe that we've used many many times.

This is a family favourite in our house!
I give it 5 stars based on the original recipe but after reading hundreds of reviews I have tweaked it a little bit since I first made it.
I use rotisserie chicken to save time, I add fresh tomato salsa to the sauce, 1/3 package of taco seasoning and I use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom.  Delicious :)

Made this for a group of friends, and it was so easy and good.  The only thing I changed was doubling the sauce.  I added one can of cream of chicken which I would recommend so there's more sauce to the enchilada.

SOOOOO GOOD!!!!!  I did make a few changes and it was absolutely perfect and packed with flavor!!  This is officially in my rotation of favorite meals.  

My changes:  I cooked the chicken with some taco seasoning, I added a half can of enchilada sauce instead of the milk, I used jalepenos instead of chiles for more spice, and I doubled all of the sauce (except for the jalepenos) and used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken.  If you have not yet, you must try this recipe!!

This is a great and simple recipe.  I did make a couple of adjustments.  I used about 2 tsp minced garlic instead of powder and swapped corn tortillas out for the flour tortillas.  My family was impressed.

WOW! These enchiladas were cheesy and DELICIOUS. The only change I made was to add homemade salsa to the chicken mixture instead of the green onions and green chilies. I even made a batch of vegetarian with green peppers, onions, and mushrooms and the same cooking instructions - AWESOME!

Love this recipe!!  I did change it up a bit though, that is why I gave it only 4 stars.  I did as other reviews said and added taco seasoning instead of the seasonings in the recipe.  Omitted the green onions and just added the green chilies.  I also used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom and used mexican cheese instead of cheddar.  Great concept recipe.

Enchiladas were good, I made recipe as written. The tortillas were way too big, only made 3 (very large enchiladas).
Next time I will use corn tortillas and throw some black beans in the chicken mixture.

This was very disappointing.  It tasted like a big, creamy mush of pretty much nothing.  I even bought a whole chicken, cut it up and added taco seasoning.  I also added cilantro.  I gave it two stars instead of one because it was still very edible with lots of extra sour cream and salsa.

I really like this recipe! =) Although, I did make some changes according to others' suggestions. I used one can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom. I added A LOT more cheese than the recipe stated, and used just regular flour tortillas and rottiserie chicken breasts. Very yummy and will definitely make again soon! =)

I give it 4 1/2 stars.  It was a pretty simple recipe that my whole family loved.  I cut up a whole chicken, rubbed with taco seasoning, baked with a bit of chicken broth at 350 degrees for 1 hour and shredded it.  This gave it more flavor than plain chicken would have had.  The only other change was to use cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom.  Served with corn and a salad.  It's still not overwhelming in the flavor department, but it is very satisfying.  There were barely any leftovers.

Wow - one of my top ten recipes ever. A few things: (1) this isn't really an enchilada recipe, more like a cream sauce burrito. (2) I have no idea how this could be six servings - I had exactly enough for four normal-sized enchiladas. (3) I essentially made no changes to this recipe, and it turned out flawless. These are NOT messy, NOT complicated, NOT hard to eat... I actually made them ahead of time, too, so it would be a good recipe for guests. I served with black beans and homeade tomato salsa, to balance out the creaminess of the enchiladas. This recipe rocks.

I would feel like I 'robbed' you of this recipe if I didn't post a comment, it's that good.  I served this to friends a couple of months ago and they couldn't stop talking about it.  It's the best!  Thanks so much.

With a few changes this is a five star recipe. I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom, added 1 Tablespoon of chili powder, pinch of cayenne, 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 cup of salsa to the filling and 3/4 cup of salsa to the topping. Rotisserie chicken would be great, shredded up in the filling, or I just cooked 3 breasts in some oil and sprinkled them with garlic powder, chili powder, salt, and pepper. This made 8, filled, 6 inch tortillas. I used the salsa instead of the steps with the green onions and can of green chilis.

Needs more spice but was very good. Kids loved it though!  I will change it up a bit next time.  As a few others suggested using taco seasoning and maybe spicy green enchilada sauce added to the soup mixture.

Tastes very good and is easy.  Recipe needs to be adjusted a little bit, however.  If using a 13 x 9 dish, you need to use no more than a 10 inch tortilla, the 12 inch called for by the recipe will not fit in the dish.  I used seven 8 inch tortillas, which filled the 13 X 9 perfectly, with maybe room for one more if I would have proportioned the filling a little bit better.  My 12 year old daughter made this and did an excellent job.  This is a good recipe for someone just starting to cook.

These are AWESOME!  I used chicken taco seasoning on the chicken - I think it is a must!  I always use extra cream of mushroom and fat-free sour cream to make extra sauce as well.  I use extra cheese too!  My boyfriend is a big fan. I love them too!  :)

I use this recipe pretty frequently and never get any complaints from the family.  I have learned not to use left over smoked chicken in them, as there just aren't enough robust flavors in this recipe to stand up to the smoky flavor.  I always use about 1/2 c more cheese than the recipe calls for.  These enchiladas seem to be better the next day.

These were lovely and both the Mr and miss 8 raved about them and asked if we could have them again.  I made a few changes based on what we had in the pantry and our tastes - replaced the green onion with a small brown onion, replaced the mushroom soup with chicken soup, replaced the green chili with a tsp of red chili and I added half a packet of fajita seasoning while browning the chicken.

My family loved this recipe, although I made several changes, some following others' directions.  I used shredded chicken and seasoned it with taco seasoning.  Then I used 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1/2 can cream of celery soup and more cheese than suggested as I like cheese.  Also, to make this mild enough for my small children, I left out the onions and peppers and instead used 1 tbsp each of sage, crushed red pepper, chili powder and garlic powder, all mixed in with the sauce.  My husband said it tasted just like the enchiladas at our favorite mexican restaurant.  Also, we served with salsa and sour cream on top.

Great recipe!! I followed everything except that I substituted green bell pepper for the chilies.. I paired it with Mexican Rice II recipe from this site.. plus had Nachos with it.. a complete Mexican Dinner!! Yum!  My husband had 2 rolls of these.. this is a keeper though will probably do this only once a month as it is so high in calories.. Thanks!

Hi ...
Okay ... my Enchiladas turned out absolutely fab fab fab ... BUT, I made definite changes ... otherwise, I feel that the recipe would have been too boring ... here's what I did ...
firstly, I used Amy's Mushroom soup ... it is semi-condensed ... I purchased it at Whole Foods ... I used an entire can of chopped green peppers ... along with the 'juice' ... I used a small can of sliced olives ... I simply included in with sauce ... I poached the chicken in chicken broth with bay leaves and other spices according to taste ... I sauteed fresh garlic with the green onions ...I added lots of red pepper flakes, and HOT salsa to the sauce ... I used CORN TORTILLAS not flour tortillas (yuck) ... I simply sprayed the bottom of the dish with non-stick spray which worked beautifully ... the corn tortillas turned out soft and fab ... otherwise, I followed the recipe to a tee ... oh ... I didn't add milk at the end because the sauce was thin enough since Amy's mushroom soup is semi-concentrated and more watery than the fully concentrated kind ... otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe to a tee ... I must tell you, the enchiladas were absolutely fab fab fab ... OH ... I forgot, at the end ... after rolling my enchildas and etc., putting on the cheese topping, I put a little hot sauce on the top of the dish ... I know, it sounds like too much hot stuff ... but, trust me, it isn't !!!  We had glasses of fab chardonnay (chilled) and toped the enchiladas with fresh green onions and t

Very tasty.  Using a rotisserie chicken made this dish a snap to put together.  This dish is versatile - one can add their own special touches.  I made extra sauce and used only about 1/2 of the green chilis.  I added salsa for extra flavor and color.  Served with the usual condiments - sour cream, salsa, chopped green onions, tomatoes and olives, etc.  Next time, I may add a little mexicorn and/or rinsed black beans to the filling.  The only drawback was that the enchiladas were soggy the next day :((. Delicious and easy to make - what more could you ask for?

I really liked these because this recipe does not call for the usual enchilada sauce.

This was yummy!  I used one cup of sour cream (instead of 1/2) and kept the soup measurement the same.  I added a few tablespoons of hot salsa to the cream mixture (instead of green chiles) - it was awesome! - I think it would have been bland without it.  I added a little sprinkle of cheese inside each tortilla as well.

This is EXCELLENT. I made it as is and was worried there wouldn't be enough sauce, but there was. I normally make another recipe and hubby said this was better. Next time I think I will put a can of green chile sauce on the bottom of my 9x13 pan so the bottom of the tortillas aren't hard like they were. Other than that they were GREAT. I served it with cheesy green chili rice, not the healthiest meal, but tasted great none the less! :)

This was outstanding!!! I doubled the recipe thinking they would wouldn't be enough to feed my family of 6 but they were each so big that I ended up with plenty for leftovers. Great recipe and now a favorite for the kids and adults alike.

DOUBLE THE SAUCE!!  So glad I read the reviews to double the sauce.  I added a can of Rotel to the sauce. Seasoned chicken with garlic powder, cumin, sea salt, and black pepper before cooking in skillet.  Used the large tortillas.  Husband and I both loved this recipe.  Our little girls were not so fond of it.    I'll still make this for our family regularly and if we're having casual company.

Well I made some major changes to this and it was excellent. I have to say, though, that there is no way there is enough filling for the amount of tortillas, so 1 1/2 times the mixture stuff. I used ground turkey, added cumin, used yogurt instead of sour cream, used some fresh cilantro, and put a little salsa in the mixture. Also used green spinach torillas. It was excellent.

I added fewer green chiles, and it was still rather spicy, I also added more cheese. This recipe was really great for a change of pace.

This was really good. I did have a few modifications. I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce and glad that I did! I used regular onion instead of green because that is what I had on hand. I used a 10oz can of diced tomatoes with green chiles,whole wheat tortillas,fat free sour cream and 2%sharp Cheddar cheese. It was wonderful and my husband loved it. I served it with white rice and broccoli! Can't wait to eat leftovers tonight!

This was the first recipe I used from this site 6 years ago. It is still a fmily favorite. I don't like enchiladas served any other way any more. Thank you for this recipe, this is my go to meal when I need a crowd pleaser without to much hassle. The only variation I ever make from the original recipe is the campells roast garlic cream of mushroom. Yummy....

These were FANTASTIC! We cooked the chicken on the George Foreman grill and shredded it instead of using cubed chicken. I also substituted 12 corn tortillas because they have a better taste and because I am not a fan of the flour ones. (I lived in Mexico during college and never ate a flour tortilla!) I poured a can of enchilada sauce over the white sauce, which made for a nice mix. They only took about 1

This recipe is great! I did switch out the Mushroom soup for cream of chicken soup. I also added some cajun seasoning to spice it up a bit. Instead of Cheddar cheese I used a pepper jack cheese to make them a little bit more spicy. I loved them and will be sure to make it again. p.s I also used leftover chicken from the night before. It is a great recipe to use if you have any chicken leftovers!

This was really good, I did do a few changes based on other's reviews.  I first sauted the chicken in onions and garlic, I then added Taco Seasoning, and shredded the chicken and added water, covered it and let simmer for 25 minutes.  I added cilantro and green pepper to the butter/green onion mixture.  I doubled the sauce recipe, and used 1 cream of chicken soup and 1 cream of mushroom soup.  In the filling mixture, I added white long grain rice along with a diced tomato.  Instead of 1/4 cup milk I added 1/8 milk and 1/4 of the seasoned water that the chicken was cooked in.  Turned out great, just the kick it needed.

Whenever I make these enchiladas, I add a can of cream of chicken soup.  Also, I add an extra can of green chiles and about 1/4 tsp of cumin.  This helps make it go a little farther and a little more favorable.  I use whatever filling I have leftover in the bowl to top the tortillas with before I bake them.  Then, I had the Cheddar cheese to melt for about 5 minutes before they are finished.

Delish! I made this recipe for a few of my girlfriends last night. I used half cream of mushroom and half cream of chicken soup as suggested by other reviews.  I also added some hot sauce to kick it up a notch. My girlfriends raved about it, it's a keeper.

Absolutely love these chicken enchiladas. WONDERFUL!!! I have made this several times and each time I make it, it taste better and better.....and it's already amazing. It's a must try dish!!!! I also make them with corn tortilla's you don't even need to fry them. Just put them in a stack and wrap two damp paper towels around them heat 12 for about 30 seconds. Spray foil with cooking spray and cover the baking dish so they don't dry out. Turns out great!!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe as written and gave the recipe three stars. I have made it again with my changes and it's now a 5 star recipe.  In fact my husband said it's the BEST enchilada he has ever had.  The changes I made:  I added diced jalapenos, cumin, cayenne, and a can of original rotel to the sauce mixture. (omitted the chiles) I added the milk to 3/4 the sauce, but I don't think that was necessary.  These enchiladas now have a wonderful flavorful real Mexican kick!

No disappointment here. It was a very delicious dish. I added Med Chunky Pace Salsa because we like tomatoes. Other than that, I didn't change anything at all.

We love these in our house!  I have made them several times, and my husband thinks they are the greatest things in the world (and he doesn't even really like Mexican food).  Chef's note:  Make sure you buy the good cream of mushroom soup... I bought the store brand once, and the large chunks of mushrooms are kind of funky in this recipe.  Stick with Campbell's (or similar) because theirs does not have this problem.

Very yummy!  I used jalepenos instead of green chillies and onions instead of green onions.  I didn't get 6 enchiladas out of this recipe, though, it was only about 3 bigger ones.  But I will definitely make this again.

As others have advised, this is a spectacular base when the sauce portion of the recipe is doubled. I have been cultivating this recipe for about three years now and have found it best with twice the green chillis, fresh garlic to taste (I prefer quite a bit) a blend of fontina and asiago cheeses lightly sprinkled inside of the tortilla (corn or flour depending on prefernce) and half of the mexican blend cheese on top. Cilantro adds incredible flavor to this dish as does a handmade tomatillo sauce I often create for mexican dishes. You can buy these at the store. Utilizing a rotiserrie chicken is a fantastic way to time save, in my experience. Remember when making this recipe that it is a fantastic foundation for your creativity. Tweak it to your taste and enjoy. I believe whole heartedly that is predominantly the reason it has received the reviews that it has.  When cooked according to recipe I find the enchiladas to be on the bland side. Again, do not be afraid to spice it up.

EXCELLENT! You can improvise the green onion and chilie peppers with just about anything. As long as you stick with the rest of the recipe it will turn out yummy. I recommend using corn torrtillas.

This is awesome, as-is, but having made it so many times, I've added a few things to it.  I've begun doubling the recipe (for leftovers :), at least doubling if not tripling the amount of green chilies for more tang, adding a can of black beans and, if available, fresh tomatoes from our garden.

Wow...these are great!  I never crave left over dinner, but I couldn't wait to eat some more of this the next day.  The sauce has a great flavor.  The only changes I made were that I used mushroom soup with roasted garlic and I added olives to the sauce.  I will make these again and again, but maybe try to cut back on the fat a bit next time.

I have used this recipe before and it was a big hit, but I made it last night with cream of chicken instead and it was sooo good! I doubled the recipe because it makes great leftovers and used a whole 16 oz. container of sour cream and a 2cup bag of shredded cheese in ours. The whole family agreed these were the best chicken enchiladas I ever made!!

Just for a quick note.  The recipe has you preserving 3/4 of the sauce and adding milk.  First of all I am a big fan of cheese, and not crazy about browned/blackened sauce all over the top of these beautiful enchiladas.  I often reserve only 1/8 of the sauce and cut the amount of milk in half (use whole milk) then coat every inch of the pan w/cheese.  Bake it the same until bubbly like the recipe says, and you can make more enchiladas and waste less sauce.  I also subsitute 2/3 a can of Rotel Hot Green Chiles/Tomatoes and it reall "kicks it up a couple notches!" :-)

This was good, I slow cooked my chicken in
broth, onion, garlic and cheesy taco seasoning and chile's in the Crockpot I prefer shredded meat. Other then doubling the sauce and adding extra cheese I liked this recipe. A quick and easy dinner!

This was really good. The husband and kids enjoyed it. Next time I might try it with cream of chicken soup or cheese sauce instead as suggested by other reviewers. The cream of mushroom just did not seem to fit as well with the recipe.

These were delicious! Hubby couldn't stop eating them. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce and they came out perfect. I didn't have any green onions, so I substituted regular onions (cooked them in the butter till translucent)and I added sliced black olives and chopped tomatoes. This dish was so good!

I made a few changes, but this was delicious.  Instead of adding the first 4 ingredients, I used 1/2 package of taco seasoning mix and cooked with the meat per package directions. I added the sour cream to the soup, however I also put a strip of sour cream on each tortilla. I did not add the cheese to the saucepan; I sprinkled it directly into each tortilla on top of the sour cream. I then added a small amount of soup mixture (soup, milk and sour cream) to the chicken and placed the chicken mixture on top of the cheese in each tortilla. I then finished as stated in the directions. Very creamy with just a touch of Mexican flair.

These are some family pleasing enchiladas! I poached 5 frozen chicken breasts then shredded the meat.  I used 2 cans of cream soup and 1c sour cream to almost double the sauce.  Added a bit of sauce to the dish prior to putting in the filled tortillas.  By the way, the green chillies are flavorful but not spicy.  I got 10 plump enchiladas out of this recipe.  I would highly recommend this flavorful recipe!

This is so good. I've added it to my recipe box and get asked to make it all the time from my husband and four boys. I do double the sauce because we like the tortillas soft and I put some sauce on bottom to keep them from getting too hard. I also add some Zatarans blackened seasoning to the chicken to give it a kick.

My whole family loves this recipe.  The last time I made it I was a little lazy so I layered the tortilla shells with the filling in the middle and the sauce and cheese on the top, almost like a lasagna.  It still tasted fantastic and was easier!

I thought this recipe was good. I added some jalapenos to the sauce to kick it up a notch and used fat free mushroom soup and fat free sour cream. It was really easy too. This is definitely a "make again".

Fantastic! My changes: sauteed 1 chopped poblano pepper and chopped cilantro with the onion. Since I doubled the recipe I substituted 1 cup of muenster cheese for the cheddar. I also used corn tortillas crisped in oil. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

I thought this was fabulous. I don't like mushrooms, so I used cream of chicken and cream of onion (I doubled the sauce, which most on here recommend). My husband loved it and he is usually a corn torilla guy. I don't like corn torillas, so it was great to have an enchilada made with flour ones that we both like. Definate keeper and easy to tweak and play around with.

I have to admit I'm not a big fan of Mexican food but cause my fiancee loves it I decided to give this a try and to my surprise I really liked it.  The best Enchilada I've tried.  Even my extremely picky daughter loved it too...she kept asking for more.  Thanks for the reicpe.

These turned out great!  I used (8) corn tortillas, store bought chicken, cream of chicken soup and some chipotle hot sauce for a little extra kick.  I will definitely make these again, they were a big hit!

Best recipe ever! I doubled the recipe and used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of chicken/mushroom mix. Also added about 1/4 cup of red enchilada sauce. Can't wait to make this again!!!

Used leftover beer butt chicken from this website and cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. No other changes. Surprisingly the green onion added great flavor vs. yellow or white onion.  I make home made green chile and use it when making my burritos but this recipe was so easy and seriously tasted like restaurant quality. (I used to work in a Mexican restaurant in the SW too!) For some reason I folded in the sides when rolling - don't.  Too much tortilla on ends this way.  Thanks!!!

These are great chicken enchiladas!! I followed the recipe mostly but I did add extra condensed soup.  I used almost both cans of cream of mushroom and a cream of chicken. I also used smaller tortillas.  My only suggestion would be to make extra sauce and to play around with some extra fresh ingredients and maybe some more heat - but these are good as is!!

This is superb. I made it for the first time and it did take a little longer to prepare and to make the sauce but i am sure i will be faster next time. 

substitions:
I couldn't find canned chillis, i wasn't keen on chopping my own either so i used jalapenos - 2 tbsp. just 2 tbsp made it quite spicy already.

i added in fresh sliced mushrooms. i added it in together with the chicken and  let it simmer for a while until it starts to soften. i didn't let it soften entirely because i knew i would be placing it in the oven.

i added more milk to this because it didn't seem like i had enough sauce for 6 tortillas.

i think adding herbs gives it a good twist. i added chopped, basil, parsley and coriander and when i served i dribbled some chopped spring onions.

everyone at the table loved this. it came out nice and moist - most importantly full of flavour even though i added about 1 cup of milk to it.

definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe.  I did as some have done and added a can of cream of chicken with the cream of mushroom. The rest I left the same. Next time I will double the recipe, it was barely enough for my hungry brood!!

These were so good.  I was looking for a yummy recipe to use up some leftover roasted chicken.  This was it.  I made it a bit lighter by using reduced-fat soup & cheese, and fat-free sour cream -- and it was still amazing!  The green chilies gave it a great flavor.  They were rich and creamy and oh so good!!

My husband is the pickiest eater, and he is very skeptical of homemade enchiladas.  I made these last night and he devoured them and asked me when I would make them again.  We absolutely LOVED this recipe!!  Thanks so much for helping me find a dish my picky eater would love!!  EDIT:  My husband still prefers the original written recipe but I prefer a little extra ingredients.  I always add fresh chopped cilantro and jalepenos.  For a more aunthentic sauce I still reserve 1/2 of the sauce like it says to do before you add the chicken and cheese.  But I combine it with a sauce I made in the blender.  Here it is.. to a blender or food proccessor add: *1/2 red bell pepper *1/2 can of diced green chilies *1/2 jalepeno, chooped *1/2 tomato, chopped *3 cloves of garlic *3 TBS fresh chopped cilantro *Squeeze of fresh lime juice *1 TBS cumin *1 tsp corriander *Drizzle of olive oil  blend it up and then mix it in with the reserved sauce.  Pour over enchiladas and then use 1 cup FRESH grated cheddar cheese + montery jack cheese

This was a very good recipe!  Made it for my boyfriend and we both liked it alot.  I really would give it just 4 1/2 stars since it was tweaked a bit, and without the jalapenos it seemed like it'd be bland. Like others have suggested, I doubled the sauce recipe.  Used one can of low-fat Cream of Mushroom, one of low-fat Cream of Chicken, since that's what I had.  I couldn't get the green chiles, so I subbed 3 jalapenos, finely chopped (I do love spicy!) but next time I'll just use 2. I also forgot the milk but didn't really miss it.

I covered half the enchiladas with the traditional red enchilada sauce and the other half with the sauce from this recipe.  Both were delicious, but I think I prefer the red a bit more.  All in all, a very tasty and interesting recipe.  Careful, though--very rich and very filling.

This is delicious. Tastes like a restaurant dish. Only change I made was to add 50% more green chilis, a tablespoon of chopped garlic, and some garlic salt. The 12" tortillas were too big for my taste -- will use the soft taco size nest, and MAKE SURE TO PUT SOME SAUCE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN BEFORE BAKING. AWESOME RECIPE!!!!!

This recipe was OK. I agree with oters - the sauce was too heavy, but being me I tweaked the recipe some. I added a box of thawed frozen spinach to the chicken and some cumin. The heavy sauce could have been partly my fault - I added cream cheese and milk. Recipe only made three good-sized enchiladas whick was enough for my husband & myself. If I make it again I'll try to make a lighter sauce.

Very good.  I was looking for a white sauce recipe since my husband likes white better than red.  Used onion powder instead of onions and low-fat cream of chicken soup with low fat sour cream for the sauce.  Also doubled the sauce.  Turned out great!!!

Awsome. Ive been looking for an enchilada recipe with white sauce and this is a keeper. I had to double this as I make mine pretty thick. I only got 8 out of a doubled recipe. you wont be disapointed.

This was just o.k.  I practically tripled the ingredients because there just isn't enough sauce.  It was lacking in flavor.  It needed a lot more onions and spices because it tasted like tortillas with chicken rolled in them and then topped with soup.  So....I think it's a good base but they could be a lot better.

I'm on the fence...I used cream of chicken and a nacho cheese cream soup instead of mushroom (which I hate), and omitted the diced can of chilies. My extremely picky 5 yo loved it and said we should have it every night - a HUGE accomplishment. Half of the rest liked, the other half wouldn't try (guess they are used to the "regular" red enchiladas). I just couldn't bring myself to eat because it was so loaded with fattening things...I'd have to tweak to make it more healthy if I was going to make again. Thanks for the recipe though.

This had to be one of the worst recipes that i got off of this site. maybe it was because when i added the garlic is seemed to burn..i would suggest putting in the garlic powder AFTER you put the soup in. Also, i found that adding cilantro and salsa made it taste better.

I use this recipe ALL the time, I have thrown out my "ordinary" enchilada recipe. The only change I made was using corn torillas, personal preference. Thanks for sharing!

Sorry, but we will not be making this again. It reminded us more of a tuna casserole taste. Maybe part of the problem was that I only had Golden Mushroom Soup. We embellished it with  sides of cilantro,lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, green onions, black olives and sour cream. We resorted to using Tabasco.

Very Good. I used corn tortillas because the flour ones seem to get doughy when a sauce is put on it .

Great recipe.  I usually make it as is or make some changes - boil and shred the chicken and then simmer in taco seasoning; use whole wheat tortillas, fat free sour cream, reduced fat cheese, and reduced fat soup.  Definitly a crowd pleaser.

This turned out to be a hit. Using the taco seasoning for the chicken made for some great flavor. I warmed the corn tortillas so i could wrap them properly without having them crack or break. i used Sargento's mexican 4 cheeses (shredded, comes in one pack) and also added some salsa verde. and made some other minor changes to make according to taste.

I always double this recipe, otherwise it's just not enough! I also find that there's not enough filling to make the amount of servings listed, so I get fewer. I use shredded rotisserie chicken instead of cubed, I think it's easier to eat that way. Fantastic, a hit at my house!

I used whole wheat tortillas for a healthier choice, and actually made a mistake by adding the full cup of cheese into the tortilla mixture,and it was still yummy.  I only had enough mixture to stuff 2 12" tortillas.

I made these tonight and thought they were good, but my husband didn't like the sauce.  I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom and used leftover turkey instead of chicken.  I also added some diced red onions for flavor.

These were wonderful.  I added 2T of chili powder and 2T of cream cheese.  Next time I will make a double batch of everything.  I served it with "mexican rice I" from this site.  Perfect.

My husband and I thought these enchiladas were pretty good. However they are nowhere near as delicious as the "Chicken Enchiladas I" recipe on this website. They tasted a bit bland, I would recommend these to somebody who is looking for a mild tasting enchilada. Somebody who is looking for the real thing try the "Chicken Enchiladas I" recipe. We are going to stick with that one in the future.

Absolutely scrumptious!  I added about 1/2 cup salsa to the sauce and used tex-mex cheese blend in place of the cheddar but followed the rest exactly.  It's also extremely filling,  I could only eat 1/2 of one!  Will definately be making again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I rated this a 3 because I felt it was an average meal.  Unlike other reviews I didn't have a problem with dryness but that is probably because I kept an eye on it.  However, I did feel it was a little bland.

This was delicious! I added 1/2 can of green chile enchilada sauce and a little extra cheese, and it turned out great. However, if you use the large tortillas recommended in the recipe, it only makes 3 of them (still 6 servings). I will use the smaller tortillas next time just for appearances.

Great recipe- easy to pull together and very filling. Followed exactly except for using cream of chicken and wheat tortillas. Recommend using low sodium cream of soup- it is very salty.

Since making this dish for my fairly picky husband 4 weeks ago, he has requested a replay 3 times. He actually gets excited when I make it for him. This is the only recipe for chicken enchilada recipe that leaves no left-overs. Even the kids loved it.

These were really good.  If you like creamy enchiladas, you will love this recipe! I doubled all of the ingredients except for the tortillas and it made enough for probably 5-8 people depending on how many sides you offer with the meal.  I added one can of the chicken verde along with the cream of mushroom soup and it turned out wonderful.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is the best chicken enchiladas I have ever had.  I goofed a little and added all of the ingredients together before separating to add milk and pour over the top: so I just saved some with the chicken already added and added a little milk to thin it out and poured that over the top with shredded cheese. Very delicious!! I will make this again and again.

I was nervous making these for the first time as I had never made enchiladas before.  These were so simple to put together and everyone loved them.  I doubled the recipe using 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can cream of chicken and shredded rotisserie chicken.  I will definitely be making these again... and again... and again!

a few summers ago I had a broken leg, 2 kids under 10 at home and a husband that worked all day.  Lets just say dinner was not so good for a few weeks.  My friend had just made this only with beef so over the phone she told me how to make it and I helped my kids the best I could, it was great.  I just found the chicken version-can't wait to make it.  With out any body casts!

I made this recipe last night and thought it was going to be the best recipe ever! Well, it was just ok.  Something about it?  My boyfriend didn't care for it really.  I asked him if he wanted to take the leftovers for lunch and he said you can eat it.  I will eat the leftovers. I will try this recipe again. I did change it up because it needed more flavor.  I cooked the chicken in fajita mix and that gave it a lot more flavor.  Also added more cheese but other then that I followed the recipe.  I might even change it up more the next time I try this recipe.

My husband and I thought these were great!  I doubled everything except the tortillas, as others had recommended.  I left out the green chiles (I'm not a fan of them), and added chili powder and cumin.  Also, I sprinkled some taco seasoning on the chicken before cooking it and then shredded the chicken instead of cutting it into cubes.  I also wanted to use up some leftover tomato I had, so I added a little bit to the inside of each enchilada.  I'll definitely make these again!

I was surprised on how good this was.  I'm not a fan of soup recipes, but this recipe turned out pretty good.  I doubled everything except for the tortillas like others suggested.  I used chicken verde soup and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also used fresh garlic instead of powder and added a packet of fajita seasoning mix to spice it up a bit.  My family thought the enchiladas were delicious, and I thought they were pretty easy to prepare.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  We will be making these again.

I have made these a couple dozen times in the last few years.  One thing I've learned is that it's better if you double all ingredients for filling and sauce.  When I haven't doubled the recipe (except for the tortillas), there just doesn't seem to be enough filling or sauce and the enchiladas can end up kind of dry.  If you like your food spicier, I would add a can of diced jalepenos to the filling. This recipe is a great base to experiment with according to your family's tastes.  I've also made this with low-fat sour cream, soups and cheese, and it came out great.  Thanks for a family favorite!

This is our new favorite meal! I made it for Cinco de Mayo, and my husband was craving them again 2 days later. We have eaten them 3 times in the first week! I recommend subsituting  Campbell's "Chicken Verde" soup, or maybe another cheese or Mexican variety- it really adds to the flavor.

Awesome recipe!  Very easy to make and delicious.  My only suggestions...  I would first spray the bottom of the pan so the tortillas don't stick after they bake.  I also added about 2 Tablespoons of black beans on top of the mixture in the tortilla before I folded them.  Serve with some salsa and voila!  Delicous!

My family loves this recipe.  I usually double the sauce and mix more sauce in with the chicken, rather than pouring so much over the top.  The kids really love this dish.  I serve with spanish rice.

this tasted pretty good.
i fried my chicken with chili powder, cumin, pepper, garilic powder and paprika (as suggested by another reviewer).
i also doubled the sauce as per others suggestions. but it turned out to be a bit too much for our liking. we would actually prefer not having any sauce on top at all, the sauce makes the tortillas soggy and we liked the ends that were more "crisp". so if i make this again i won't double the sauce and just put all the sauce in with the chicken and sprinkle the tops of the tortillas with some of the cheese. but that's just my preference.

I didn't have cooked chicken, so I sauteed the chopped chicken in the butter and garlic before cooking the onions.  Very good recipe.

This was absolutely delicious!  I added 1/2 of a package of Ortega Smoky Chipotle seasoning to the soup mixture.    I highly suggest doubling soup mixture and chicken.  I made recipe as is and it only filled 4 tortillas.  I also used 2% Mexican cheese and fate free soup, sour cream and milk! Absolutley recommend this recipe!!!

These were fantastic!  I used cream of chicken soup and canned chicken because that is what I had on hand and they turned out great.  I was also able to make 8 enchiladas as that's how many tortillas there were in a package.  Next time I might try flavored tortillas like sun dried tomato or jalapeno.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous.  My husband went crazy over this meal.  My only suggestion is to double the ingredients for a family.  I served this with salsa over the top, which really made the meal, and served with a crisp iceberg salad and ranch dressing.  Living in Germany, we get cravings for Mexican, and I was able to find all of these simple and wonderful ingredients.  Even my picky 11 year old daughter loved it!

I've made this recipe twice this week because it was so good.  The first time, I bought a piece of grilled chicken breast at the prepared foods counter at my local grocer, and it was super easy.  Today, I just grilled up some chicken breast that I had in the freezer and although it required one more pan, it was still a relatively quick and easy meal with a fabulous result.  The store was out of diced green chiles in a can so I bought a couple of fresh jalapeno peppers and used those.  Also, DH thought it would be a great idea to get habanero cheddar instead of regular cheddar so they were scorchingly spicy.  I bought an organic, relatively healthy cream of mushroom soup and used this instead of the Campbell's standby and it made a big difference.  Overall this is a great recipe and I will certainly be adding this into my regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

This was so easy to make and delicious.  My husband loves Mexican food and said this was awesome.  Didn't change a thing.  It even sat in the warming drawer for 30 minutes while we were waiting for a construction worker to leave and still was fantastic.  Thanks

our family makes this all the time!  We dont change it a bit either, its excellent just the way it is. Nice thing, you can make the sauce ahead of time if you wish and stuff the shells when your ready to bake.  Always a hit!

Awesome recipe!  My husband even said it was good and he is a total beef man!  I am replacing my old chicken enchilada recipe with this one!  However, I only had enough of the mixture to fill five tortillas...enough for my husband and I but definitely not enough for 6 servings as shown.  I used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup in place of the cream of mushroom.  Perfect!  I made this recipe again and used half of the sauce to mix with the chicken for the filling and poured the other half over the top.  It made six and worked out better.

I love these Chicken Enchiladas, They are my new favorite. The preparation is so easy! It’s unbelievably easy. I did however add my own touches to it; I use diced green bell peppers to substitute the green chiles. And I use Cream of Chicken to substitute the Cream of Mushroom. I also double up on the chicken. 
My husband loved them so much. I now use “Chicken Enchiladas” as my negotiating/bargaining tool to get what I want!

Oh my goodness, was this wonderful!  I've always made enchiladas with ground beef and taco seasoning, and this was such a great change, very easy to make and so so good!  I used about 1/2 of a rotisserie chicken from the store and shredded it and used a can of Rotel.  And I ended up putting 3/4 of the sauce INTO the enchiladas and 1/4 for the outside.  I used the other 1/2 of the chicken in my Zattaran's jumbalaya rice mix.  Perfect dinner. No complaints whatsoever!  Thanks!

Even my arch-conservative nine year old liked this one.
I poached and hand-shredded two large chicken breast fillets, used fresh chilli and garlic and threw in a little cilantro (since I was chopping some anyway for salsa on the side). I also used I can each of cream of chicken and mushroom soups (you really do need the extra sauce). The result was really yummy and, surprisingly, didn't have a "canned soup" taste.

I followed the recipe, except that I used 2 chicken breasts and used smaller tortillas (8 inches?).  They were good, but rather on the bland side.  Next time I think I'll add some fresh garlic and some cumin and salt.

Really good.  I used 5 chicken breasts, boiled and chopped, 1 1/2 cans of cream of chicken soup, 3/4 c. sour cream, yellow onion, and 3/4 tsp. garlic powder.  I divided the sauce in half and the proportions were perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome -- I used ground turkey instead of chicken and added some onion and taco seasoning to the turkey when I browned it.  I even used fat-free sour cream and low-fat cheese and it still tasted great!

I was so apprehensive on trying this because last meal I fixed hubby wasnt really impressed with but I have been wanting some new recipes to add to my box and let me tell you this one is a KEEPER!  I followed recipe to a T , next time I may try the taco seasoning like some had mentioned and I will broil the tops a wee bit for hubby since he likes things a bit crunchy :)

Wonderful Recipe if you like creamy, moist chicken enchiladas! I don't add the onion or the chiles and they turn out just fine! A favorite in my recipe box that I have made over and over! Highly Recommend these!

How can you go wrong? This is a great base recipe with lots of room for individuality. With the green onions and chilis I added chopped roasted red peppers, and I added some leftover black beans to the enchiladas. To the sauce I added some cumin and chili powder. Yum,yum!!

I made these enchiladas last night. I made some changes after reading some of the other reviews. I used 8" tortillas and I used Campbell's Chicken Verde Soup instead of Cream of Mushroom. I also used two bought rotiserie chickens shredded up instead of cooking my own chicken. It was a lot easier and the chicken was so much juicier. I doubled up on the ingredients because I wanted to make a lot. I made 14 enciladas and still had meat left over for tacos the next day. Everyone loved them including daughter. These are now on my list of monthly meals to make. ENJOY!!! Simple and delicious!

Would love to give a five star, but I thought it was a bit too much sauce and my kids surprisingly thought so too.  Overall the item was good, next time I will cut back on the sauce mix...

This was a very good recipe and I got no complaints from guests.  But personally, I agree with another reviewer.  It was very rich and a little bland.  The richness would be okay if it had a little more flavor that you'd expect from an enchilada dish.  I dashed some chili powder over mine which was a great improvement.  I definately suggest spunking this up with a little taco seasoning or chili powder.  I served this with peas & rice I seasoned with a chicken bullion granules and spicy black bean dip.

This recipe is one of the main reasons I continue to use this website as my cookbook.  I first made this back when (years ago!) there were only about a couple of reviews.  But, this continues to be one of my favorites.  It's great for potlucks and dinner parties.  It doesn't have a lot of the ingredients that people pick out, which I love.  This is my boyfriends favorite- he says some nights he dreams of them.  = )  Enjoy!  No changes needed!

Since there was only my daughter and I and she's only 2 I used 2 chicken breasts to make this dish.  I didn't want too many leftovers because i didn't think this would keep real well.
I used the full can of soup and made the sauce the way the recipe called for.  The only thing I did was cut back on the chilis a bit so my daughter would actually eat it.  It was actually quite a good recipe.  I think next time I'd use fresh garlic sauteed with the onion and more cheese.  I didn't find it was cheesy enough as is.  Even so I gave it 5 stars because it has a good flavour and is pretty easy.  Its even easier if you don't have to make the chicken first.  BTW...I fried the chicken with some homemade taco seasoning.  I liked the fact the chicken had some extra flavour to it.

My husband, who is very picky, told me to keep this one in rotation.  Didn't use the green onions or chiles (like I said-picky) so I added other seasonings to perk up the chicken a bit.  Served it with the sweet corn cake, also on this site.  He loved that too.  Will definitely make again.

This was excellent!  I was afraid my family wouldn't like it because they are used to red, tomato-based sauce on  their enchiladas, but they loved this!  I made the following changes:  Only used 1/4 cup minced green onion.  Used 98% fat free soup and fat free sour cream.  Added 1/2 tsp chicken fajita seasoning.  Also added 8 minced chilipiquin peppers that grow in my yard instead of green chilies.  Used nine 6" tortillas.  Topped with cheddar and monterey jack cheese.  Used foil to keep tort edges from getting crunchy about halfway through baking time.  Thanks for a new favorite to add to our menu!!!!

With all the reviews and suggestions I really expected a lot from this dish.  I added cumin, curry, taco seasoning, substituted enchilada sauce for the milk, doubled the cheese, then added black olives on top.  These enchiladas were still bland.  It was a good starting point I suppose.  It needed some salt and maybe more of everything I mentioned above.

Excellente!  I've finally found the perfect chicken enchilada recipe...and doubt if I'll ever try another one!  Anxious to try them with corn tortillas next time!

My family loved it!  Doubled sauce and used pre-cooked chicken as others suggested.  I also shredded the chicken and cooked it in a little taco seasoning to give it a more "mexican" taste.  Yummy!

This was O.K. I didn't like the soggy bottoms of the flour tortillas and the mushroom soup flavor was odd in this dish. I'm sorry :(

This is a wonderful recipe!  My family thought they were the best enchiladas they had ever had.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 can soup and 1/2 can green enchilada sauce.  I also used jack cheese combined with cheddar. Wonderful way to use left-over chicken, too.

I think it's a 3 star, but hubby stated it was a 5 star, so I gave it 4. It was ok.  I added salsa in the sauce...used flour AND corn tortillas to see which was better.  They both tasted the same to me.  I added enchilada red sauce and black beans on top.  I also followed the advice of others and used a rotisserie chicken from the local Walmart (which is actually cheaper than buying uncooked chicken breasts these days!) I mean, the stuff was ok, but not great. Like others have said, don't expect much Mexican taste to this dish.  There are tons of better Mexican recipes. I'll likely stick with those. Sorry! Ally

I followed the recipe, but I did add a jalapeno pepper for a little extra kick.   I made it for a church pot-luck (tripled the recipe) and it was the first thing gone.   My husband and kids loved it and we'll be having it again tomorrow night for dinner.   I also had to stop on my way out to give the recipe to a couple of folks before we could leave.   Good stuff this!

Excellent dish!  I made a couple modifications:  doubled the mixture recipe, used (9) 12 inch tortillas to make a full 9X13 pan.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom and shredded the chicken in the food processor first (ended up using 4 c. of shredded chicken).  Would definately make again!

my fiance went insane over these.  i altered the recipe by adding twice as much sour cream and cheese, and added chili powder (for color if not flavor) and i would recommend using smaller tortillas than 12 inch.  they were good, not my favorite. i am a bit more critical about mexican food since i am from a mexican family and i'm pretty picky.  i would totally recommend this recipe to anyone.

Used suggestions from other reviews: 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 C. sour cream, 4 C. chicken, 1 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. canynne, substitued 1/2 C. enchilada sauce for 1/2 cup milk (after setting aside filling portion), doubled the cheese.  We ate it all up, but most of us added green or red tabasco at the table to punch up the flavor.  Can't really call this enchiladas, or even a Mexican dish.  But as a flour tortilla casserole it just a little too rich and gummy for us.  Would eat it again if someone else made it but I'll probably put my own efforts elsewhere.  I'm still searching for a great chicken enchilada recipe.

These were great!  I didn't change too much, except to skip the garlic powder and instead add 4-5 cloves garlic and cilantro & lime juice.  I didn't have green chilis so I added so jalopenos instead, which gave it some kick but it wasn't too spicy. I agree that more chicken and cheese was needed so I added that too. I also forgot to add the milk at the end but it was still great.  This recipe made 4 10" tortillas for me, and they weren't overstuffed.  I'm not sure how this recipe could stretch to more than that without doubling or tripling it.  But this amount was perfect for my hubby and I, with leftovers for lunch.  I served these with the red enchilada sauce from this site and I think that really made these something special.  A very easy and delicious recipe.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would! You definately need to double the recipe if you are using the 12" tortillas. I was only able to make 4 (which was really all I needed). I did as others suggested and sauted the chicken for a few minutes in olive oil with cumin, garlic powder, salt and pepper prior to adding to the sauce. I was easy to make and everyone LOVED it...I will be making this often!

This was great.  My dh who lived in Mexico said they tasted like the ones his Mexican maid used to fix.  I took the advice of others and doubled the sour cream, added one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken soup, and I added extra cheese.  I also doubled the meat.  I added 1 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp garlic powder.  It was awesome.  Oh, this easily filled 7 8-inch tortillas, but no more (and that was because I only mixed 1/4 of the sauce with milk).

My family loved this!  I doubled everything, maybe even more so with the sour cream, cheese and chicken.  I cooked the chicken up in olive oil with salt, pepper, cumin, garlic power and lime juice (as another advised) to give it more flavor.  Also I used 12 of the smaller tortillas instead of the bigger ones.  Will be making this many times in the future.

My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe.  My husband likes spicy so I may add a little bit of Rotel to it but it's probably the best enchilda recipe I've tried thus far.

I am loving this recipe!  I like it much better than the traditional red sauce/corn tortilla enchiladas.  The sour cream sauce  is a delicious idea.  I will definitely make it again.

This was a definite 5 for my family.  We loved it.  I served it with Mexican Rice (also on this site) and they both got the big rating from the hubby and the kids!  If I make it again I will double the recipe and make about 9 tortillas leaving me bigger fillings and more sauce.  The sauce was a bit sparce.

I've made this recipe many times and my family loves it.  I considered the "3/4" a mistake. Instead of combining "3/4" of the mixture, I only combine 1/4 of the mixture with milk and use the rest for filling the tortillas.  I also like it better with whole wheat tortillas.

A great way to use leftover chicken and the other ingredients are usually on hand. I substituted 1/2 can of mild, diced jalapenos, increased the sour cream and added cumin. I also added canned black beans as a filler to stretch the recipe.

I used hot taco sauce in place of the milk and corn tortillas.  Good flavor but too creamy and salty and not enough spice (even with the taco sauce).

Very tasty dish that my family loved. I added Queso Quesadilla cheese (in addition to the cheddar), and it gave it a creamier taste that went over well. I also added diced Mayan sweet onions to the mix for an extra kick. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

I used cream of chicken. I made the mistake of not draining completely the juice from the green chiles and it made the dish a bit salty. But the sauce is def. a keeper.

Wonderful! I used jalapeños diced instead of green chiles (due to an error while shopping), cream of chicken soup, 2 cans of canned chicken, and corn tortillas (first fried a bit for easy rolling). My husband keeps asking for this again!

This is a DELICIOUS recipe!  I also used a can of Rotel instead of the green chilies which gave it such great flavor.  I doubled the recipe to feed guests and everyone loved it!!  I will definitely prepare this recipe again.

I use cream of chicken soup as well, and both my husband and I LOVE this recipe. I like to buy the tomatoes with the green chili's already in them and skip a step.  This dish is always an absolute hit.

These are really tasty. I, too, use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom (don't like mushrooms). I've even messed up the recipe and had to make it into sort of a lasagna type dish, and it still baked up well.

This dish was OK. The tortillas came out kinda chewy and it wasn't "mexican" enough for us. Probably will not make again, there's just much better ckn enchilada recipes out there, sorry ):

This was very easy to make and tasted good.  I left the chiles out of the sauce because they are too spicy for the kids and I, but I added them to the top (over the cheese)of several enchiladas for my husband.  I also used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom because I thought it sounded more appealing.

Great stuff. I too doubled the recipe (except for the jalapenos) and made the following suggested changes: I used two cans of water-packed chicken, hand flaked and mixed with 1/2 packet of taco seasoning before adding it to the sauce. I also added cayenne and 1/2 cup of red enchilada sauce to the sauce and topped the enchiladas with sliced black olives. Will definitely make again.

I made a few changes to this recipe that others suggested and served it to friends at a potluck. Everyone loved them and were quite surprised to find there was soup in the sauce. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing.

I've been using this recipe for a while now. I've tried others, but keep coming back to this one. I do double the recipe and use one can of Cream of Chicken and one can of Cream of Mushroom. I also top it with some slice jalapeno peppers before baking. This is a favorite at our house. Thanks for a great recipe!

Well, personally, I really enjoyed this dish!  I did not get the same response from my husband.  I was really surprised at that.  He had an "issue" with there being Cream of Mushroom soup in an enchilada recipe.  I thought it was great!  My 11 and 5 year olds both ate it without question, but neither exclaimed how much they enjoyed it.  So, I'm mystified.  If were to make it again, I'd probably use Cream of Chicken rather than mushroom, as even I think it might compliment the dish a little better.  I did use Campbells 98% fat free soup, low fat cheddar, and 1% milk.  I don't think these substitutions took anything away from the recipe though, and I felt better about serving this up to the family.  I didn't have green onions on hand, so I used diced sweet onions.  I sprinkled sliced olives over the top before baking, and sprinkled a small amount of Wildtree Herbs' Taco Seasoning over all for a more authentic "Cinco de Mayo" flavor. My son loved adding more low fat Sour Cream atop his.  I'd recommend this recipe.

UPDATE (2/2/05)...Made this again exactly as above, and apparently my husband didn't remember having it before (this time I didn't mention anything about the cream of mushroom soup being in the mix), and my husband commented on how good this was!??!  Again, both kids ate it without comment. I loved it!

Just like everyone claims...these were yummy!  I used the meat from a rotisserie chicken and used cream of chicken soup rather than mushroom.  I also topped these with red enchilada sauce (my favorite).  Would make these again.  Thanks for sharing this one Steph.

Great recipe!  I made two alterations though, instead of butter, green onions and chiles I used one can of drained Ro-Tel (hot!) because we like a little extra kick.  I also used a Mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar.  Thanks!

Very good, with a couple of minor modifications.  My husband and I like a little "zip" in our enchiladas, so I added 1 tb dried parsley, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp ground black pepper, 1 tsp chile powder, and 3 small ground super chile peppers.  Probably any type of ground chile would work, chipotles would be especially nice.  I also used fat free sour cream, you'll never be able to tell the difference with all the other ingrediants.  I will definitely make this again.

This is sooooo good!!  Made it for the first time tonight for company--who is a picky eater.  She LOVED it--told me so about 10 times.  I did sub the mushroom soup with cream of chicken (my husband is not a mushroom fan).  I think it would prob be better with the chicken vs. the mushroom anyway.  I also did use low fat sour cream and skim milk and the sauce was still very good.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I'll be making this often.

These were a really good quick fix.  The only thing I added was jalopeno peppers because we like things spicey.

Wonderful! My family loves these, my 7 yr. old asks for them all the time. You have to watch these so the bottoms dont burn. When I pour the sauce over them all-- I heat it first to get it hot allready. Its a keeper!!!

Everyone loved it!  I went on Allrecipes in hopes of finding something yummy to make with leftover turkey breast and this recipe was perfect.  Another plus was it was very simple and quick to make.  I made a couple of minor changes and  used reduced fat sour cream and cream of chicken in place of the mushroom. A winner and a recipe I will use often. Thanks!

To lighten it up I used low fat and low sodium soups, fat free sour cream, whole wheat tortillas and low fat cheese and it came out delicious. I shredded the chicken and added a can of green chilies sprinkled over the top.  It's delicious!

We doubled this and made a cassarole instead of rolled enchiladas, with layers of corn tortillas, filling, corn tortillas, filling, corn tortillas, sauce and cheese. (I used half cheddar and half jack cheese)  Served salsa, sour cream and jalapenos on the side.  It was awesome.  Thanks Steph!

This dish was terrific---followed the recipe to a "t"--the cream of mushroom soup makes it so creamy--you can't even taste it once the enchiladas are made--don't let that ingredient scare you off---great taste---would highly recommend!!!

This was a good recipe for my leftover roasted chicken.  It tasted great!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used cream of chicken soup instead.

It was a good variation of Chicken Enchiladas, but I have had better.  Seems like the chicken mixture didn't quite stretch to six tortillas, probably should have only used four tortillias instead of six.  Tasted fine though.

Very yummy! I substituted low fat sour cream, low fat cheese, low fat cream of mushroom soup, and used non-stick spray instead of butter. They turned out great, with less fat and calories!

Wow!  This was delicious.  I have made enchiladas before and was disappointed, but these were phenominal and my husband LOVED them.  I made a few changes; I didn't have sour cream, chilies, or garlic powder (imagine!) so I left them out and it was fine.  I also found the filling to be too little for 6, so I made 5 enchiladas.  I sautéed some chicken strips with spices (chili powder, Mrs. Dash!) and also added extra seasoning to the sauce.  I baked the enchiladas for about 25 minutes and they were not soggy at all.  Great meal with a green salad.  Yum!

OK but not great had to use lots of salsa and a little sour cream to get them down.  My husband and I neither one cared much for them.

I really enjoyed this as well.  I made a few changed, combining changes suggested by other reviewers.  I also doubled the recipie, and it was perfect for 10 little tortillas.  I cooked fresh chicken in Taco seasoning, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and a little over 1 cup of chicken brother instead of doubling on the cream soup.  I used salsa instead of milk for the sauce to put on top, and instead of regular chedder cheese, I used store bought "tex-mex" variety.  My family adored these...and they are a pretty tough crowd.  All my changes made it pretty spicy which is perfect for me.

These enchiladas turned out great!  I made a large batch and froze half of the enchiladas in a baking tin, complete with toppings, ready to thaw and pop in the oven for a future meal.  These also came out great.  You can cut way down on the fat by using fat free CM soup, sour cream, cheese, and milk.  Tastes just as good!!!

Excellent!  I get requests for this dish all the time!  Sometimes I leave out the chilis, or I'll put Jalepeno's in it instead - depends on my guests' tastes.  I use cream of chicken soup instead too.

I've made this recipe about 25 times now and every time is has been delicious.  I absolutely love it!  I make a few changes, like adding more cheese, topping with crispy fried onions 5 minutes before finished baking.  This recipe is awesome and easy and fun to make.  Leftovers are great also.  Thanks!

This is incredible.  I am not into hot spicy food so the chiles were just enough for me and my family.  I used fresh garlic like so many others and also boil the chicken (either a small whole chicken or Perdue large Roaster Breast) in water with onions and celery the night before and shred it and store it in the fridge in its broth to be put together the next day.  Also, I use more cheese all around.  This is awesome.  Even my 1-year-old loves it.  This is going to be a weekly staple in my house.  Also even better heated in the microwave the next day!!

This recipe is great. I doubled the sauce as many recomended. I did find it a little bland, and next time I would kick it up a bit. But as is it would be great for the whole family. My 18 month old ate it up.

I made this for my kids, a friend, and her kids, and it was a hit all around!  I sauteed the chicken in olive oil with garlic and cumin, and we topped our enchiladas with chopped tomato and cilantro before serving, and it was absolutely delicious!  This will definately go in my recipe box of family staples!

Updated review: I made these again tonight with a couple minor adjustments. Instead of the chiles I used 1/2 cup of mild Salsa, cream of chicken soup and canned chicken breast chunks. I also added a few tablespoons of taco sauce. My family loved it!

I thought these were a little bland. Not bad, but a lot of work for a so-so recipe. I added some cumin and cilantro to the chicken filling, and topped the whole thing with sliced olives, but still thought the recipe needed some stronger Mexican flavors. Also, using big (12-inch) tortillas, as directed, I only had enough filling to make four enchiladas.

This is an easy recipe that my family loves!  I bring this dish to all the potlucks, picnics and parties that my family goes to and we always end up bring home empty pans.  I add more of the sauce on the top and an extra side just for those who like extra sauce.  I love this dish!

Excellent! I only had 4 large tortillas on hand so used those instead of 6. I am very glad I did as I don't think they would have been as satisfying if I had used 6 and the sauce would not have been sufficent for 6. 
Next time I make this I will substitue 4 fresh jalapeno peppers for the canned as it was a little on the salty side with the mushroom soup, cheese and canned peppers. Also I found the canned peppers weren't spicey at all. 
Thanks so much for sharing!

These were very good, but they needed more ZIP!  I ended up putting salsa on top b/f serving.  Next time I will use grated pepperjack cheese instead of the plain cheddar.  I would make again. Forgot to add....I doubled this recipe.

This was tasty, but I couldn't get the filling to stretch to fill 6 tortillas, and I was using ten inch, not twelve inch like the recipe calls for!  I reread it and checked it but hadn't left anything out so I'm not sure what was up with that.  Nobody else seems to have had a problem.  I ended up adding a cup of corn and an extra half breast to bulk it out a bit.  Everyone loved eating it, at least!

Everyone loved this- even my Mom who hates Mexican food.  I did add some chili powder to the chicken as well as extra cheese.  It was great served with sour cream, tomatoes and salsa on the side.

I have been looking for a good chicken enchilada white sauce ever since I had it in San Antinio.  I really enjoy this, granted I agree with doubling the sauce.  I also like more stuff in my enchilada, like mexican rice.

These were excellent enchiladas.  They were very mild on the palette.  I added extra green chilies cause I only had a large can and it was fine.  If your looking for spicy, you wont find it here.  I like this in addition to my spicy red recipe.  Thanks for this!!!

We just had these for dinner, and they were fantastic! Cheesy, creamy, and hot without being overwhelming. My 2-year-old wouldn't touch them, but my husband and I thought they were DELICIOSO! Thanks, Steph! We'll be having these again!

These are the best!  I used jalapenos and taco seasoning to the mix and the taste was great!  I also used low-fat cheese and sour cream, as well as 98% fat free cream of chicken soup.  The taste was still wonderful!!!!  Thank you Steph!

This is Superb!!! Great recipie! However, while I was making this, it was suprise how little filling was put in each tortilla, next time I might try doubling the filling recipie. The taste is great, be prepared to use more cheese then it calls for. Yummy!

EXCELLENT!  Used whole wheat flour tortillas, enchilada sauce in lieu of the milk, and little bit more shredded chicken and cheese.  Served with Linnie's Spanish Rice (recipe also on this webiste).  My 13 month old son loved it!

I was in a big hurry to make this last night. I mixed up the soup stuff with frozen chopped onions and added a can of Rotel. Followed the directions and filled tortillas. Topped with the sauce and chopped black and green olives with the cheese.  Very nice presentation.

Awesome recipe! Mild but flavorful comfort food! Don't ask my 10-year-old son about it though.  He "licked" it and didn't like it.  But he doesn't count!  Will make regularly!!

These are really bland and just don't satisfy my cravings for Mexican food. Kids who are picky eaters and don't like tomatoes might go for them, but my husband and I were unimpressed. I won't make these again.

I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I had to change it a bit to make it work for my family - but it was a smashing success!  I added a can of creamed chicken with herbs and some cumin and cayanne.  I also used corn tortillas instead of flour - but how do you keep them from ripping?  I also used more cheese than it called for and put a few chopped green onions on top for color.  My husband loved it.  He would have liked me to add jalapenos however!

Made this for my in-laws and they said it was the best enchiladas that they've ever had - and they love mexican food.  I added some jalapenos, chili powder, cumin, & paprika, as suggested in past reviews to give it an extra kick, served with mexican rice and it was a hit!!  Thanks.

I used chicken breast cut into strips and cooked them using Fajita spice to add flavor to the chicken.
Instead of rolling the enchiladas I cut the tortillas into strips and covered the bottom of a greased cassarole dish. I added the mix topped with more tortilla strips then added the remaining sauce and cheese.

I also tried using the frozen Tyson chicken fajita strips but they were no where near as good as using your own chicken and fajita seasoning.

This recipe was delicious.  To make it a little spicier for my taste, I added ground achiote and extra ground cumin.

Excellent!  I took suggestions from earlier reviews -- added 1/2 tsp cumin & 1/4 tsp oregano to the sauce to liven it up and topped it all off with taco sauce (and extra cheese).  In place of pre-cooked chicken, I sautéed 3 chicken breasts (cubed). Couldn't get any better - my family loved it!

Delicious!  I have made this recipe for guests more than once and have always received great feedback.  My only complaint is that the recipe doesn't make much sauce.   I have never been able to get more than five enchiladas out of this recipe.  In the future, I may double the sauce portion.  Other than that, excellent!

This is a perfect make ahead meal.  I thought that the sauce would make the tortillas mushy, but baking it 2 days after I assembled it turned out perfect.  My picky kids loved it.

These are the BEST enchiladas I have ever made!  My husband likes cheese enchiladas so I left the chicken out of his.  My teenage daughter and I love black olives, so I added them to ours.  Even my picky 6 year old liked this.  A definite keeper!!

I have made this twice now and we love it! This last time I used corn tortillas. Just put them in the microwave wrapped in dampened paper towels just long enough to heat and soften them. Then add the chicken mixture and roll up the same way as the flour tortillas. I am use to corn for enchiladas and flour for burritos. Works wonderfully. Even though you are using green chiles this recipe is not too spicy for anyone. Thanks

Very good & very easy! Tastes great with salsa, or 1/2 ranch dressing 1/2 salsa mixed together. Really good. I will add this to my file of favorites.

I couldn't find the green chiles when I was making this recipe, so I used a can of Rotel instead.  The enchiladas were great--they had a lot of flavor, but they weren't too strong for my family.

I made serious adaptations to this recipe because I didn't want to want for a trip to the store!!.  I was trying to use some leftover grilled chicken (mine was marinated in Adolphs for the Grill Garlic) so I found this recipe which called for garlic.  I omitted the garlic, since my chicken was garlic.  I used Cream of Chicken Soup. In addition to the ingredients listed I used 3 tablespoons red pepper and sauted it with the green onions.  I used "marble cheddar" I'm sorry I'm unsure of exactly what that is, but it's cheddar yellow and white marble.I used a bit more sour cream and cheese(simply because we like it) and about 1/3 to 1/2 cup milk to get what I considered to be the optimal consistency. I combined all the ingredients except the sour cream in a microwave dish and heated until bubbly. Then I stirred in the sour cream. I buttered the bottom of a large square micro dish, heated the tortillas, laid them on the buttered bottom and filled and rolled (an old trick I picked up in Mexico)  I only used 4 because they were so large and filled the dish.  I had just enough "filling" left over to wet the tops of the tortillas, then I completely covered them with the shredded marbled cheddar cheese.  I put the lid on, stuck it in the microwave and cooked on high for 6 minutes.  The result? Heaven!!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe

Very good. Easy to make. Used low-fat cr. of chicken soup, lite sour cream, and leftover baked chicken. Made 4 well-filled tortillas. Rich, saucy, flavorful, spicy (not hot). Sauce was not thin and tortillas were not dry (as I had read in other reviews.) One to try and pass on  :)

Great recipe for finiky eaters. I use cream of chicken for a little more chicken flavor--makes my picky eaters happier too. I also reserve less of the sauce and include more of it into the tortillas. It seemed like too much of the sauce was being wasted in the bottom of the baking pan. A regular at our table!

Probably the best chicken enchilada recipe I have ever had, and very easy.  I used chicken instead of mushroom soup and added more spices to mixure, and used half pepper jack cheese with half cheddar cheese.  So good, and filling.  Easy recipe to double of save one batch for later.  Also makes delicious leftovers.  Will definately make again soon.

Surprisingly good! I added a taco seasoning packet to the chicken to add spice. I only made 5 of them and had plenty of sauce the tortillas did not dry out like some others said, but if you want to feed more than 2 or 3 people, you will have to double.

I made this recipe in 2002 for the first time and made a review.  I had to review this again.  It is just to wonderful.  I make this every year for my husband for his birthday.  It is such an excellent recipe.  I do add a can of jalepeno for an added zip.  Great recipe.

I'm reviewing this recipe for the second time.  The first review was based on following the recipe exactly.  This time I changed the recipe by using fish (any white fish) and shrimp.  I   first lightly seasoned and sauteed the fish and shrimp in a little butter.  Then, following the recipe going forward.  Oh my God!! you talking about GOOD!! I served this version at my husbands b-say party and the guest were beside themselves.  You gotta try it!

I made this for the superbowl - everyone loved it.  I did make some changes.  Definately use the flour tortilla - not corn (they break). I doubled the recipie and used only 1 and 1/8's of a can of cream of "Chicken" soup.  Add cumin and garlic salt.  When I cooked the chicken, I seasoned it with a taco seasoning packet.

I have a sour cream enchilada recipe that I normally stick with, but wanted to try something new.  These were great, boyfriend loved them.  I would of liked a little more sauce, just because the left overs were a bit dry.  I used 8 "soft taco" size tortillas instead of the 12" which I find to be somewhat difficult to fill/roll.  Will try the cream of chicken substitution next time.  Great overall.

My husband and I LOVED this.  I took the advice from other reviewers and substituted cream of chicken soup
for the cream of mushroom.  Also, be sure to use a *sharp* cheddar cheese (Cracker Barrel 
makes a good one) which I think adds a lot of flavor.  Aside from that, I didn't think it needed any other 
spices, and I love highly-seasoned dishes.  If you're expecting a traditional red-sauce/corn 
tortilla enchildada, you will be disappointed.  But if you're a fan of creamy sauces
you should really enjoy this.  We will definitely make it again soon.

Really good!  A nice change especially for those who prefer creamy, non-spicy courses.  More like a creamed chicken entree.

My husband hates onions and peppers, however he really liked this dish.  I did make a few revisions: I used minced onion in place of the green onions and I pureed the green chilies so there wasn't large pieces in the sauce.  I also added chili powder, garlic salt, paprika and a little poulty seasoning otherwise I think it would be to bland.  I used 2 cups of cheese instead of 1 cup and I put an additional 1/2 cup chopped chicken on top of the enchiladas.  Will make again. Thanks

This recipe is fantastic.  My husband and I now have no reason to go out for Mexican food.  I also used Cream of Chicken soup, and enchilada sauce instead of milk.  I serve it with mexican rice and we stuff ourselves silly.  Thanks for a great one.

I used this recipe to use up some of the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  The enchiladas were delicious and quite a hit.  A little too heavy for every-day eating, but definitely worth an occasional indulgence.

Let the tortillas sit out to room temperature, otherwise they crack when you try to fill and roll.

I used fresh garlic,a yellow onion and a jalepeno. With the topping sauce I pureed in a blender. Also I strained the cream of mushroom soup. Just didn't want mushrooms in enchiladas.My wife and friends loved it.

My family adored this dish.  I used the 99% Fat Free Cream of Chicken instead of Cream of Mushroom, Fat Free Tortillas, Reduced Fat Margarine, and Reduced Fat cheese.  The lower fat items did nothing to lower the taste of this great dish.  Chicken Enchiladas will be a monthly dinner at my house!

WONDERFUL!!! I sauteed chopped onion, when I sauteed the green onion - great flavor! I also made some of the suggested substitutions/additions - 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, and cream of chicken soup. They were definitely restaurant quality.

Fabulous recipe!  I read the suggestions and used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom.  I also used a colby/jack cheese blend, added drained rotel tomatoes to the chicken mixture to spice it up, and used regular onion instead of green onion.  This recipe worked well with reduced fat sour cream & 98% fat-free cream of chicken soup. I also tried using the Louis Rich Southwestern chicken strips to save time.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I took the advice of others and made a few changes:  substituted cream of chicken soup for cream of mushroom, added a few jalapenos peppers (used Ortega sliced jalapenos and diced them), added 1/8 tsp. of Cumin, added 1/4 cup extra of sour cream to the mix.  I topped the final product with a bit of sour cream and some black olives, and served with Cheesy Mexican rice.  My family loved.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe and for all of the great advice!

Que Bueno! These were the best enchiladas I ever made. I doubled the recipe and added some chopped jalapenos (a must in all my mex recipes). The second time, I made it with shrimp and added campbell's cream of tomato soup (in place of the mushroom/chicken)soup and it was AWESOME!!  My 18 yr.old ate half the pan!!  Gotta go for this one

Amazing!!!! Rich, delicious, maybe a little bit on the salty side, but OH SO GOOOOOOOOD!!! I used Campbell´s Cheddar Cheese Cream instead of the soup called for and turned out JUST GREAT. I also omitted the onions on half of the recipe because my picky husband wont eat them. Will definitely make these again and again and again, only variation will be that next time I will use twice the milk the recipe called for. THANKS for the awesome recipe...... Moshi

This was a really yummy dinner - super quick and pretty inexpensive.  However...don't know about you, but even with a side dish this wouldn't serve 6 people to anyone I know.  One not-so-stuffed enchilada just doesn't cut it.  I would suggest using the six people recipe for three people at the very most -- two people if your hungry.

I cooked the chicken in a dry white wine, with about a tablespoon of onion and garlic powder.  By doing this the chicken had flavor and the enchiladas did not have to be smothered with sauce.  Excellent dish, and even better as leftovers!!

These are delicious. A nice change from the red-sauce enchiladas. I used non-fat sour cream and reduced-fat soup and it turned out great.

When I first read this recipe I thought it sounded strange and would turn out soggy, but everyone said it was great so I gave it a shot. YUMMM! This was sooo good. And wasnt soggy at all. The tortillas turn out almost pastry like.. the filling is to die for. Im going to make it for dinner again tonight! :)

I made this the first time for my husband and he loved it!  The second time I made this for a church pot-luck and they raved about it.  I used a 7 ounce can of the chopped green chiles and about 1 cup more cheese.  This is a simple and quick dish, bursting with flavor!  This is well worth keeping in your recipe box for quick meals ideals!

Made this as a "low cal" version (with low fat and low cal ingredients) with leftover roast chicken and it was absolutetly delicious!  My 12 month old even liked it!  To decrease the amount of cal/serving even more, I added 1/2 pound chopped mushrooms (in food processor) to the chicken, put the mixture in 8 6" tortillas (making 8 instead of 6 servings).  Baked it on the BBQ at minimum for 25 minutes.  This was the second time we made this, and it is now part of our recipe rotations!  I'm on weight watchers, and one serving is equivalent to 5 points, just for your info!

Great recipe.  I made it for my parents last night and they loved it.  I didn't have Cream of Mushroom soup so substituted Golden Mushroom Soup and it turned out fine. I will try it again with the Cream of Chicken soup (since it's been so highly recommended by the reviewers) and will add sliced black olives.

Great recipe. I'm sure it'll be even better next time when I remember to put cheese on both the outside AND inside of the tortilla.

This was excellent!  I made it for dinner for myself, my boyfriend and his parents and they absolutely raved about it!  The sauce is very tasty and the ingredients really compliment each other.  I will be printing this one out for sure!!!

This was really good!  My husband liked it and my picky 14 yr. old even ate it.  My Mother who is 80 yrs. old even liked this.  This was really easy to make after work.  I used a garlic clove minced instead of the garlic powder and I used enchilada sauce instead of the milk as another reviewer mentioned.  It was delicious!!!  I have never made enchiladas and I will definately be making this again!

Quite good and would definitely make again. Only mods were:

* Used ~3/4 cup green onion (3 green onions)
* Used shredded chicken from Instant pot (1.2 pounds - ~2 cups)
* Used small corn tortillas (6 inch) and yielded 13 enchiladas

Thoughts on future mods would be to sub the can of green chiles with fresh chopped jalapeno and/or red/green peppers.

My family is pretty picky, so we ate around the mushrooms and green chiles. Didn't have any green onion, but like I said--picky. It didn't really make more than 4 enchiladas though, and I had smaller tortillas. Still delicious!

Im just really confused on the number of ratings ranking this dish so highly. I do not like leaving a bad review, but good or bad it can maybe give others insight. When I started making this I was feeling proud that I was preparing a new well reviewed meal for my family, even the “sauce” seemed to be creamy and a delicious starting point...however when it came down to the filling there was not enough to properly fill the tortillas. The sauce was super salty and tasted very canned and you might as well eat cream of mushroom straight from the can that’s your thing or dip a warm tortilla in a can of cream of mushroom and eat it that way. I cook prep-heavy meals almost every day and am big into cooking. This was terrible and I will not be making it again.

This is great comfort food.  Easy to prepare.  I chose to try to lessen the amount of fat in the recipe by using fat free sour cream and low fat cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom.  Tasted great, nothing was missing.  I paired it with some spanish rice and refried beans as side dishes.

Our dinner guests all loved it. I followed the recipe except that I doubled everything for a party of 10. 

Also, I used homemade plain greek yogurt in place of sour cream. I pressure cooked boneless, skinless chicken breast and shredded it instead of cubes and I used the popular suggestion of white corn tortillas. I will make this again!

We made this tonight for dinner.  I used shredded chicken that I made in a slow cooker but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I'm honestly surprised at how good it is using canned cream of mushroom soup.   In the past I've made the sauce from scratch but I wanted a shortcut this time.  Next time we might use a 7oz can of green chiles  but the recipe is really good as written.

I have made this recipe several times and we absolutely love it. Today, however, when I reached into my freezer for what I thought was chicken breast, what I came out with was ground turkey breast. Not being one to back down from a challenge, I sautéed the turkey with a little bit of taco seasoning. This was unbelievably good. La familia says they want me to make it this way always. And I will.

I did make a few changes.  Like everyone seemed to be suggesting,  I doubled the sauce,  and I'm glad that I did.  
I didn't have enough cheddar,  but used the Walmart brand Fiesta Blend.  
I used 2 cans (10oz each) of Rotel Original,  tomatoes and green chilies.  
And I added some Herdez Salsa Verde to the mix.  
And I used shredded chicken,  instead of cubed. 
Turned out great.  Would definitely make again.

Best I’ve ever made. One thing I would change would be to use “low sodium” soup. They came out a little salty.

Great recipe.  I made only a couple small changes. I used corn tortillas instead of flour. I cut up two large chicken breasts into small pieces, seasoned them with salt,  garlic and cayenne pepper and fried them in the pan with a bit of olive oil. Then put the chicken aside, drained the oil and added the butter. I used less green chilles than called for because I just didn't care for the taste. The rest of the recipe I followed however,  and they turned out great. My family ate the entire dish!! Including my very PICKY 7 year old who loved it. And my 6 year old said, "I wish this was the only food there was in the whole world."

1.5 cups of chicken is not enough.  It should be at least 3 cups for 6 enchiladas.  Other than that it is very good.

Tried with both flour tortillas and corn tortillas.  The corn do not seem to get soggy like the flour did.  Excellent flavor.

My family loved this.  These were delicious and I will definitely make these again.  I used a store bought rotisserie chicken for added flavor and it was worth it!  So good!  I served this with Spanish rice on the side and guacamole and it was the perfect meal.  Also tasted great as leftovers.

I made this today and my husband and son liked it just the way it was! I can see changing a few things but they told me absolutely not LOL! I did add twice the green chilies and told them afterward. I topped them with chives after cooking and that added a great freshness. It was very easy to make and I will be adding it To my dinner repertoire.

RAVE reviews from my family! We’ve wanted to eat these every single night since since I first tried the recipe last week. I have celiac disease so used corn tortillas. Also followed the suggestions of salsa instead of milk, and cumin in the chicken (I used shredded not cubed). My family asked to try this recipe using shredded beef, so that’s on the menu this week! Thank you for the keeper!

First time making and I don't make Chicken  Enchiladas  but read the reviews and decided to do this one as it was quite a simple recipe. I had flour tortillas and wanted to use some of them up and try them in this. I lightly toasted the tortillas in a cast iron pan first then added the mixture before rolling up. I used 5 12 inch ones. I added about 1/4c of yellow pepper and 1/4 cup of green pepper and used diced yellow onion rather than green. I sauted all that in the butter first. Did everything else the same but I guess I added more garlic to taste used 11/2 cup of rottisare chicken and I added a 1/2 tsp paprika. these turned out yummy! Served with a spinach salad that had avocaodo and dried cranberries and silvers of pepper with a balsamic dressing. Would make these again!  My man ate 2 and I ate one so we have 2 leftover for lunches.

It was good! I added the can of tomatoes with the green chilis  mixed in to the recipe vs the green chilis alone. Also I didn't have any green onions so I used a regular small onion. I really liked it! BUT double the meat recipe part. 2 teen boys could devour the entire pan.

This is a good enough recipe as is. The next time I made it I made "Caseydilla's"...having to modify it a little. No soup, added red pepper, green pepper and some Anaheim pepper(good way to use them up), Mexican spices and used the cheddar and Mozz I had. It was a great way to use some Rotisserie chicken and finish up the veggies and Mozz. It's pretty good either way. I had left over peppers from fixing Seafood Enchilada's from A/R.

Even though it’s technically considered a burrito, it’s by far the best enchilada recipe I have made to date! I love the white sauce. Definitely reminds me of the Chicken De Monterrey from Carlos O Kelly’s which is the only thing I order there!!

This is an excellent recipe.  I always double the ingredients to make 12 total -- my hungry family of 5 needs at least 2 enchiladas each. The first time, I made the recipe exactly as written except I used salsa verde instead of chiles. Came out wonderfully. The second and subsequent times, I used a nacho/taco blend shredded cheese instead of just plain cheddar. Since I can get it prepackaged, why not? I also smeared a little refried beans across the tortilla first before the filling.  This is a very adaptable recipe and nice to have in my favorites folder.

This is DELICIOUS!  Only difference I made is with how I prepared the chicken. I have no patience with cutting up the chicken. Upon purchasing boneless chicken breast, I asked the meat department to “cube” the chicken on their meat grinder (similar to cubes steaks). The meat department sliced the chicken breast in half and cubed it running it through their meat grinder 2 or 3 times.  From there, I followed the recipe. I simmered the grind chicken as a whole after it boiled, as instructed. Then placed it in the skillet after the onions mixed with butter caramelized, and cut it up with a good spatula directly in the pan.  As I added the rest of the ingredients it called for, I continued cutting up the chicken til it looked shredded as it simmered. Viola!  It worked great, and the chicken was so juicy and tender!  I continued to follow the rest of the recipe exactly as written. This is a KEEPER!  Thank you for making this recipe available on AllRecipes!

I love this recipe! I leave out the green onions (kids don’t like) and substituted cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom (husband hates mushrooms). This has become a family favorite. I can make ahead and keep in the refrigerator until I’m ready to cook. Sometimes prepare it on Sunday and place in oven Tuesday for our ‘taco Tuesday’ night. *kids love theme nights. This certainly isn’t traditional enchiladas- but, perfect burrito casserole.

Very Good.  The wife LOVED it.  I added a little bit of cilantro and some tomatillo salsa in the mix to spice it up a bit.  Will certainly make again - Did substitute corn for the flour tortillas however.

I added fresh green chilis from Pueblo Colorado, and I used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar cheese. I also used corn tortillas and layered the ingredients instead of making traditional enchiladas. I will ABSOLUTELY make this again. It was one of the best dishes I and my fiancé have EVER had!

Delicious! My kiddos gobbled it up - and they're not big Mexican food fans. We didn't have green onions so I subbed 1/2 a medium yellow onion. I also added spinach. Those are the only two adjustments I made and it was great!

Delicious! If you don't want to roll the tortillas up, you can just lay them in the pan and pour the sauce over each layer.

Made a whole beer can chicken the night before and picked clean and shredded meat and seasoned the night before. Amazing sauce. Will be a staple in our household from now on. Even was good as leftovers the next day. Yum

Was easy to make and came out very good. I would only change or add a couple of things. 
1- add some other seasonings for more flavor, I added a little salt, pepper, and some cumin.
2- I would put a slight amount of the sauce in the baking pan after it is sprayed. Without some sauce on the bottom the tortilla gets a little hard.

But again, very easy to make.

I've made these numerous times and would highly suggest using smoked chicken or turkey.   The smokiness from the meat takes this to another level.  I also make more filling then suggested as I always run out of filling.

This is a great recipe.  Different from the same old beef enchiladas I usually make at home.  I followed the recommendations of several other reviews and added some fresh ingredients to bump up the flavor-fantastic results!  I couldn’t find the larger corn tortillas so ended up using the small ones-yielded 10 total.  Highly recommend this recipe and I will definitely be on our family repeat list.

This dish turned out to be really tasty! I only had Monterey Jack cheese so that’s that I used. Next time I make this, I think I’ll use Pepper Jack cheese. I tasted the chicken mixture before assembling the enchiladas and found it to be way too mild for our taste so I jazzed it up with couple of dashes of Cayenne Pepper.  This was the “missing ingredient” that made a world of difference.  I also added it to the sauce for the topping.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I set the recipe to 6 servings and it was not enough to fill 6 tortillas. The chilies gave it a weird taste. I followed the recipe - didn't make any changes to it.

This was my first time making  enchiladas,  and I didn't want a recipe with red sauce.  I used a hybrid flour corn 8 inch tortillas. I brushed each tortilla with olive oil and then fried each one for a minute or so, to soften the tortilla and prevent it from cracking when rolling. I also used a mix of cheddar and jack cheese. I poached and shredded the chicken. And finally (if you are still reading) I used a mix of jalapeno and red chilli peppers. 
They were awesome.. I will definitely make these again and wouldn't change a thing.

i started w/ 3 raw boneless skinless chick breasts & used lots of spices to cook 7 min on low boil & 7 min resting in the hot broth.  i cut up the chick before poaching for ease of use. since we don't eat salt do to high B/P i use gobs of herbs & spices & i used cream of mushroom soup w/ roasted garlic. i only got 4 enchiladas using 8" tortillas out of the recipe & i used low sodium chili w/out beans on 1/3 of the enchiladas prior to baking. we have decided this is one of the best meals i've ever made!  i highly recommend! i also managed to cook the whold thing from start to finish in one stove pan & 1 glass casserole dish so easy clean up!

I loved it...although, I didn't have the right ingredients so I loved the "idea of it!" I only had 4 tortillas, no sour cream and no green chilies. I poured in Salsa Verde instead and skipped the sour cream. Of course, the enchiladas were rather soupy with too much sauce, but the flavor was definitely worth it and I'll try it again with the correct ingredients. I will probably always leave out the sour cream because I didn't miss it or the calories it would have added.

I didn’t have any green chili peppers. I also bought some green enchilada sauce to put on top. Was a little bland, probably would have been better if I had used the chili peppers.

My whole family thoroughly enjoyed it.  I would suggest maybe doubling the recipe at least for the filling especially if you have larger tortillas :).

Loved this!  Even our picky kids ate it all up.  The only change I made was to shred the chicken (instead of cubed) and I used corn tortillas instead of flour ones.  We will definitely make again!

My family loves these and my daughter is super-picky...super...We often dry poach B/S chicken breasts, shred and then freeze in "meal" sized bags. When we are making a quick soup or a meal like these enchiladas, we pull one out and use it. These enchiladas are quick, easy, and delicious.

Shredded the chicken.  That was the  only thing different.  It was tasty and easy.  Would like more “heat” the next time with some cumin and or chili powder.

This was easy and very good.  I made 1 1/2 x the recipe and was glad I did. It make 1 full pan with large tortillas. I did take suggestions and shredded and doubled the chicken.  I also substituted the cream of mushroom for cream of chicken.  Lastly, I add  1/2 tsp. of cumin.

These chicken enchiladas were pretty tasty (with seasoned meat). I used corn tortillas instead (because enchiladas are normally made with corn) but that’s where I messed up. I should’ve used flour OR I should have First figured out how to stop them from cracking once rolled...the end result wasn’t as neat as I would have liked them to be but that didn’t compromise the taste at all....oh I also doubled the recipe to have enough for my family....found that doubling the sauce was absolutely unnecessary....the suggested amount would have been enough even for a double serving....overall, this one is a winner and I will use it again.

This is a really good recipe, yummy and filling. And if you make a double batch you can freeze it. My family loved it and are already asking for it again. Thanks this is a keeper... Oh I used yogurt instead of the sour cream and you'd never know it... YUMMY!

With 12 inch tortillas the chicken mix sauce was too little, barely enough for 5 tortillas, and using a 13 by 9 glass baking dish was a little skimpy. I eyeballed the pan and decided to add some green enchilada sauce on hand to fill it a bit more and topped with a 4 cheese Mexican shred mix and this salvaged it. The finished product was o.k. but could have also used some salt and pepper in the mix to season it a bit better.

This is good basic recipe.  I was skeptical about using the cream of mushroom soup, but it works!
I know the tortilla police are out there, but my family actually prefers the flour tortillas, so that is what I used.  Yes, I know that authentic enchiladas use corn tortillas.

The base recipe needs more spice for our tastes.  I used a 7 oz can of green chiles, added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, and 1/2 tsp of cumin.  Still could have used more.  I also increased the amount of cheese for the filling and for the topping---added some cilantro and a few sliced jalapenos on top so that anyone who doesn't like them could pick them off.  I will definitely make these again and I appreciate the base recipe very much!

Have to agree with WoodAngela. Enchiladas are made with CORN tortillas...... Not flour. I live in Arizona. Can't get much closer to Mexico where the authentic enchiladas are made with corn tortillas. A flour tortilla makes it a burrito, which is fine, just call it a burrito. Try this with CORN tortillas and see what you think

Made and reviewed EXACTLY as written. ( Please do not rate a recipe based on your revisions.!!)   I found this very bland and not typical Mexican flavor.  You could add anything to suite your taste; con, black beans, diced tomatoes, cilantro, etc. 
I would personally prefer a corn shell (it is an enchilada after all), less cream texture especially in filling.  A thinner , cilantro based cream sauce for the top would be nice.

Perfect!  Made it as written and one of my kids favorite meals.  I make this about weekly.  When I’m in a hurry I used a sour cream based onion dip in place of the sour cream and cooking the onions in butter.  I also slow cook the chicken so it’s ready when I get home from work to throw together and bake.  My family also likes black beans so I throw a can of rinsed black beans in there sometimes also.  Colby jack cheese also goes well with the dish if you’re out of cheddar.

Made this twice and the second time I didn’t have green chilis. I will make sure I have them in the pantry from now on. The chilis made them taste even better. This was a great way to use up the leftover rotisserie chicken I had. Easy and quick to put together too.

This is a nice base recipe, I followed the recipe but my measurements weren’t rigid. I added some portobellos when cooking the chicken and that added a nice layer of flavor. I’ll make this again. The portion size was perfect, no left overs and everyone had enough. Next time I make it I’ll play a little more. Yummy and thanks for sharing!

I tried this recipe because I’m looking for make-ahead meals that freeze well and can be baked as needed. This recipe did freeze exceptionally well and baked up beautifully. I Followed the recipe other than substituting Colby jack cheese for cheddar because I realized too late that I didn’t have cheddar. We will make this recipe again because it was a great make-ahead meal, but I’m giving it 3 stars because for me, I could taste a lot of cream of mushroom.

This isn't authentic but doesn't claim to be. But I'll to you what it is, it's flippin' excellent. 
3 generations of my family were all members of the clean plate club and that doesn't happen often. 
Two mods I made were to add one finely chopped fresh jalapeno to the mixture to give it a little more kick and to generously oil the pan.

Good recipe! Will make again for sure. 

By the way, I ENJOY what people do to make the dishes fit the family taste bud's. I think about the options and would find the reviews boring and pointless without the "tweaks". Goodness gracious! That is one way to learn and gain confidence in one's own choices and tweaks. It is great to hear about alternative taste combinations! Thank you.     Judi David

I swapped the white sauce on top for the 10 minute enchilada sauce from this site.  So, if you do it my way you won't be needing the milk.  Also, instead of flour tortillas I used double corn tortillas. Way good!

Really easy, really quick, really good! It didn’t have a lot of depth to the flavor, so I added extra spices to it, and next time will add a bit of spice, too. Although, I made it for our family last night and it was a huge hit (and mind you, there are many lucky eaters in our family!!)

Unlike most, I didn't double the sauce. I really don't think it's necessary. But, I just don't want an overwhelming cream of mushroom taste in there. Next time I will definitely change the soup and use corn tortillas.

I did not have sour cream,  but it was plenty creamy just with soup.  I microwaved the onion for a minute.  I like mixing everything in a bowl.  It is much faster than the traditional method.  We like corn tortillas better than flour.

We made this recipe exactly as written, and it was fantastic. Made it into our regular rotation. My husband adds Tapitio at the table for a spicier version unless I blister and dice fresh pasilla chilies to replace the canned diced chiles.

First to whoever condemning changes...to acknowledge a good basic recipe and flatter it by adding, changing, etc. is a compliment to the cook.  RECIPE great, lowered chilies due to family preferences, added fresh spinach leaves and fresh chicken in various seasonings before cutting up. Thank you!!

I made a couple changes:  I used a Rotisserie Chicken, substituted the cream of mushroom soup with FF Cream of Chicken, used low fat sour cream, add 1/2 t. of chili powder; 1/4 t. of cumin and used the juices from the bottom of the Rotisserie chicken in place of the milk.  I also topped off with Cotija cheese when I  severed each piece.  Oh my Goodness!  My said I won the "throw down" at the factory he works at.

Tasted much better than I thought it would, not as creamy as I had feared it would be while I was making it. For me, it made four large enchiladas, but I also added beans. Will add this to my list for sure.

I loved this recipe but I tweaked it a little bit. Instead of mushroom soup I used 2 chicken soups because it needed more sauce. I also added bell peppers into it and IT'S SO GOOD. I also added some spices (garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, & oregano)  into the onions. It fed the family of 4. This might become a regular meal.

I LOVE this ... more importantly, my Picky Teenager loved this!!   I have to admit, I was a bit leery of making this - being "too exotic" for his very limited palate ... but, I am SO glad I did!  This was so easy to prepare and the taste was fantastic!  I've added this to my Must Make Weekly List!

Delicious flavor. Would suggest doubling the recipe as I like thicker enchiladas so I was only able to make 3. This was just enough to fill 2 people. Will definitely make again but I'll double the ingredients if I'm serving more than 2 people.

Simple and tasty!  I added a bit more chicken and juice from half a lime for a bit of acidity.  Served it with Mexican rice; refried beans and a spicy salsa. The whole family loves it!

I grilled my chicken and used low sodium soup. For an added bonus I used hot green chiles and garnished with cilantro. Be careful the tortilla police are out and about.

Excellent and easy. Only change I made was to replace green chilies (we don't eat those) with chopped cabbage. I may increase the garlic powder a little. I also  liked the idea someone gave about dipping the tortillas in hot broth. Kept them moist.        A definite make again.

I made this followed recipe as written but I don’t like the mushy flour tortilla I’m guessing the texture is what grossed me out. I should have used corn tortillas. The flavor was good though I doubt I’ll make it again.

Soooo easy to make and clean up is easy as there never is any left over. chopped jalopenos also make it hotter if you like heat. i served this with salsa verde in it and extra for people to put on top to their liking. Great when you do not have much time to make a big meal.

I will answer the first 2 questions in this box first.  It says "Did you make any changes?".  Yes.  "Will you make it again?".  Absolutely!
 I am rating this 5 stars with the small changes I made to the original recipe.  Firstly, I used corn tortillas that I had VERY lightly fried in veggie oil then drained on paper towels.  There were enough innards to make 9 enchiladas (I used 2 chicken breasts and it came out to 2 cups - shredded) -  rather than the 1.5 the recipe called for).  To the innards, I made the following changes:  I added about 1 1/2 Tbsp taco seasoning to the mixture.  I added 1 small can of sliced black olives.  For the sauce that you dump on at the end, I only added about 1/3 of cup of milk, not a 1/4.  Lastly, I used Campbell's Cream of Chicken with herbs that I grabbed by mistake instead of mushroom soup.  I used more cheese on top than it called for. 
After all is said and done, I didn't follow the original recipe to the T, but with the changes I made it was EXCELLENT!  It will definitely be added to our regular line up.  I didn't want to fill up with side dishes so I just opened a can of corn for the side.  They're SO good that you won't want a bunch of other stuff on the side.  Save room for this delicious dish.  
PS.  Some reviewers said it was dry and they'd recommend doubling the sauce portion.  I didn't think they were dry at all and I only used one serving of sauce on 9 corn enchiladas.  Maybe it's because I used corn torts and fried them a tiny bit

I would definitely make this recipe again, BUT I would put more sauce inside each enchilada and less on top.  I think a 50/50 division is more realistic for my family's taste.  They were quite tasty and enjoyed by all.

I’ve been using this recipe for about a decade when I found it on AllRecipes. Making it again today. It’s my go-to recipe! I mix it up and use flour and corn. Depends on my mood. ;)

This was so dry and bland and gross. I followed the recipe exactly. If you drastically changed the recipe don't give it a high rating because at that point it's not even the same recipe.

Easy, simple, and successful! I have a son who dislikes tomato products, although the rest of our family loves Mexican food; this recipe is one we can all agree on.

The kids loved it even thought I screwed it up a bit.  I forgot to split the sauce before adding the chicken so I just made more tortilla's. After baking I added cheese on the top and put it back in the oven for 5 minutes to melt.   I also made a few changes to the sauce based on what I had on hand and what other reviewers said. I doubled the sauce and used extra chicken too.  I used one large regular onion.   I added about 2 TBS lime juice and a bunch of shakes of oregano to the sauce at the end. I also only had one can of green chili's so I opened a can of rotel and took all the chili's out as well as a few tomato's. The kids didn't even notice the tomato's. When I ask the kids to rate my meals, I often get a 7. This one got an 8 and 9 which is AWESOME.

I went back and re-read the recipe thinking I had done something wrong, but I hadn't.   My husband's comment was that it wasn't inedible.   But he also asked me to throw out the leftovers.

These were pretty amazing! I would consider them more of a burrito but they were a hit! I used 2 cans of chiles instead of 1. Also, I put some chicken breasts in the crock pot in the morning with chicken broth and a bit of taco seasoning and then shredded it before adding to the mix.  Much better than cubed bland chicken in my opinion! Would make again for sure.

WOW! This is THE best recipe I have found on here! A real hidden gem! The only change that I made was instead of the 1 can of condensed Cream of Mushroom soup I used 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup and seriously this is a 5 star recipe! Loads of flavor and just the right heat!

I felt that the sauce was somewhat bland. I'm not sure if I need to add more green chili or green chili powder. I'm somewhat disappointed with the taste otherwise it is an easy recipe and easy to follow.

A little too salty for me, but otherwise great recipe.  Next time I will buy lower sodium soup. I also sprinkled with fresh scallions and cilantro and served with black beans.

This is the BEST chicken enchilada recipe I've ever tried!  Good flavor but not spicy-would definitely make again, we all loved it.  Except for adding sliced olives, I made it just as written.  This will be my go-to recipe when I'm craving chicken enchiladas!

You must double the filling. I barely got five and they were pretty empty.

Delicious!  I added some Mexican seasonings to the chicken and I doubled the sauce using a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken. Used Monterey Jack cheese and Colby jack since that's all I had on hand. Will make again. Quick and easy!

Rotisserie chicken was a great suggestion from a prior review.  Salsa added a nice flavor.

I doubled the recipe. I used cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom, and used corn tortillas. The tortillas split so it ended up being more of a casserole than individual enchiladas, but the taste was GREAT!! Very good!!

The sauce is very tasty, but I made a mess of this recipe by trying to incorporate too many suggestions...I got lost in the process and while it was ok -it was pretty goopy and not at all what I expected, I think next time I'll try corn tortillas and the shredded chicken but otherwise follow the recipe!

Awesome, simple and quick recipe. Could not find canned Chiles so I used Tamed Jalapenos (Milder version). We really love it.

Easy to make and delicious! Subbed out cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom as we don't care for that. Also used Mexican cheese since that's what we had on hand. Will definitely make again! Used both corn and flour tortillas.

I followed  the recipe exactly  and it tasted  great. However, when I remake it, I won't use flour tortilla. I'll  try corn tortillas  or doritos chips, turn into a casserole.

12 16 16  .... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/8694/chicken-enchiladas-ii/  ....  I had 3c chix to use (doubled the recipe) & was hoping this would be a hit  - meaning leftovers would be eaten.  Done!  :D  An almost Christmas miracle happened "I like this" from E, 19.  Wow!  I changed just a  bit, but not enough to influence the base recipe.  'Subbed 1c diced onion with 3-4cl garlic;  8oz green chiles (undrained); cream of mushroom & cream of chicken, 1c sour cream; added 2T taco sauce.  Removed 3c sauce for topping.  To remaining in pan, added 3c chix & 1 1/2c Mexican cheese blend.  To a can of refried beans, added 2T taco sauce.  Spread about 2T bean mixture in each of 12 (10"?) flour tortillas, then chix mixture.  Put a little of the sauce in the oiled dish, then rolled tortillas.  It was snug in a 9x13.  'Thought there was too much sauce before baking, but not after.  :D  Topped with the sauce then 1 1/2c  Mexican cheese blend.  Baked uncovered till bubbly.  This is mild, as most Mexican food is , until you add spicy ingredients.  Jalapenos, black olives, tomatoes, etc  on top would be good.  Sprinkled lightly with Cajun seasoning for flavor & paprika & a little parsley for color.  :)  Thumbs up!

Love this recipe. Made it a few times already and it always goes over well. I made a couple changes for convenience. I have used regular onions instead of green because I was out and it worked fine. Plus I usually use canned tomatoes with green chilies instead of just chilies because that's what I normally have on hand. Both work great. I also go heavy on the sour cream and a little extra milk so I can stretch the sauce to make more filling. Overall this recipe is EXCELLENT

I've made this a few times & never reviewed. This is the only enchilada recipe the my DH will tolerate. He is not a big fan of enchilada's. 
It also fits within the budget for chicken. EXCELLENT!!
Thank You!!

Left out the green onion, just because I didn't have any. Used shredded chicken from the crockpot. Substituted cream of chicken for cream of mushroom soups. These were delicious! Next time I will double the sauce!

Pretty good - I think the amount of sauce that the recipe calls for is plenty.  I do think it could use a little more spice in the sauce -- I know some reviewers mentioned adding a can of enchilada sauce.  I might try that next time.  I sprinkled a little chili powder and cumin in the olive oil I used to cook the chicken, but it still could have used more.

This came out really good despite the fact that i had no cream soups of any kind in the house.  
I just used some additional milk (10+ oz) instead and slowly cooked it down.

This was great!!  My only substitution was that I used a store-made rotisserie chicken.  (Actually, I sprinkled a little Ortega taco sauce on top before the cheese too which was great!)

As other reviewers suggested, I added 1/4 teaspoon cumin, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon chili powder and 1/2 cup of salsa.  To kick up the spice, I added half a can of jalapeno and half a can of green chilies.  I also added a can of black beans (rinsed and drained) with the chicken.  It was medium spicy with all these ingredients (I had to get an extra glass of water!), but very tasty and delicious.

Instead of using flour tortillas I heated up some corn tortillas. I then finely sprinkled some sun-dried tomato & basil parmesan cheese on top. Next time I'm making more of the sauce since mine came out a little dry.

This is my go-to enchilada recipe! The only thing I change is I add half a diced yellow onion, and occasionally add some diced jalapeno.

I used an entire bulb of fresh, crushed garlic. The fresh garlic was good, but an entire bulb was too much.  I cooked it in my solar oven, and it came out  beautiful.  The corn tortillas I used started to come apart when I put them in the pan---but not too worry.  After putting sauce and cheese on top and baking, it came out wonderful.

Excellent recipe. the only thing I changed was adding some Swai white fish, and a dash of smoked paprika . I live in the Gulf area and get fresh seafood witch makes the dish even better.

This was really great. All I did differently was that I added black beans and used a Mexican blend cheese instead of cheddar. I'll definitely be making this again.

I love these enchiladas and so does my whole family. I do not make them very often because for me they are a little time consuming to make. I do double the sauce and I use a small can of diced jalapenos instead of the green chili's but only one can for the double sauce.

Came out great!  Only thing I may try next time is using five 10-inch tortillas and bake in an 8x11.  Just wasn't enough filling for six 12-inch tortillas per recipe.

I've made these a dozen times and everyone always loves them. My mom had me make extra and put them in her freezer last time I was there. Sometimes I'll use cream of chicken instead or combo of the two. I like to use a store bought rotesserie chicken for convenience, and flavor! I also rarely measure the cheese I just add it by handfuls to my liking.

These look good, but taste like chicken mushroom soup and dough. I do not normally use flour tortillas...corn is so much better, but I thought I would give it a try because I can't find corn tortillas in the 12" size. Never again! I will probably rinse off the chicken, feed it to the dogs, and throw out the rest. Very disappointed.

I made some additions to spice it up for my husband's taste. I used Rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, regular onion, green chilies, cream of chicken soup, taco seasoning, sour cream & red enchilada sauce. Also doubled amount of cheese. Total winner! Thank you for the inspiration!

Some folks are saying corn tortillas are traditional with Chicken Enchiladas...well make 'em with corn then but you are really missing out on the textured of the  flour tortillas (I used whole wheat) and the crispy edges. The recipe is great as is

Very very good. Followed the directions completely but doubled the onion just b/c we love them. We also didn't have chiles. Dip these in some hot sauce and wow good. Will try again with a little lime juice and a bit of cilantro.

This was easy and tasty and I will most definitely make this over and over again.  I made it just like the recipe said except I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, but I did have cream of chicken soup.  I am going to stick with the cream of chicken soup.  I had planned on freezing half and having it another day, but my hubby kept going back and then there wasn't enough to freeze!!  A keeper for sure!

Needs about double the internal stuffing. Added chilli pepper and oregano, it is a fairly plain base recipe.

This recipe is divine as is. Living in the Southwest we like it spicy too. I added two jalepenos, cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom soup and 1 tablespoon Taco Seasoning 1 by Bill Echols found here at AR. Love this recipe and thank you for posting it!

I will no longer go out and order enchiladas!!!
This is so easy to make and you can tweek it to suit your taste,  I only made a couple changes because I absolutely love these enchiladas, I used ( Don Poncho) Golden Blend tortillas! They taste like corn but roll like flour. I love mushrooms so I added fresh to the mix and also added green chili enchilada sauce to the mixture.

For the ease and flavor. I give this 5 stars.  You could add more seasoning to give it more of a "kick"or adjust the other ingredients, but then it would really be a different recipe.  I live in New Mexico and believe me in our definition, these are not enchiladas!  However for flavor, ease and benality, these are great!

Yummy, followed receipt except used 'healthier' corn tortillas.  My picky teenager had seconds.

I would use more chicken than the recipe suggests, because when I made it the tortilla was too much in comparison. I really liked that it wasn't soggy, though (too many enchilada recipes are soggy).

If you have kids who refuse to eat green "chunks," but don't mind a green sauce, I would recommend blending the sauce with the onions and chiles. My kids loved it.

We made these one night prep and cooking not to long about 40 minutes not bad for a busy week night. We changed the flour tortillas with corn on the account my wife is gluten intolerant. The enchiladas were delicious. My daughter dropped by about the time we sat down to eat, of course she was welcome to join us. She said no thanks she was on a diet but would have a bite. One bite led to another which led to another she even ended up taking leftovers. Will definitely be fixing these again

I will make it again but I will leave out the salt and let someone add their own if they need it. I cut the recipe in half, used rounded measurements and ended up with 4 enchiladas. Thought it was really good. Used medium heat Chi-Chi's sauce,  left over chicken and 1% cottage cheese.

This was a nice change from our typical ground turkey burritos.  I didn't have cooked chicken on hand, so cubed 2 chicken breasts, tossed them with some taco seasoning, then cooked it on the stove-top.  When almost done, I added the green onions and some fresh garlic.  My 13X9 baking pan was just the right size to hold these.  I thought the amount of sauce was perfect as written.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe - I doubled the recipe - used one can cream of chicken, one can cheddar cheese soup.  Green chilies are key.  I added chopped jalapenos and a lot of chili powder and cumin for flavor.  Used a rotisserie chicken - this was super delicious!

I made it exactly as written but would make some changes if I make it again.  The sauce tasted too much like mushroom soup for our tastes.  I would try cream of chicken soup  and use equal amounts of soup and sour cream.

I have never made enchiladas of any kind before (and okay, if I'm being honest...I've never even eaten enchiladas before).  But this looked good.  I wanted to try it, but I'm a very picky eater...so yes, I made a few changes and made it my way.  I did use this as a base though and I loved it!  My husband loved it too!

The first thing I changed was that I left out onion (both my husband and I hate onion).  Next, instead of putting green chiles in, I diced up green, red, and jalapeño peppers because that is what I had on hand.  I melted the butter, added the garlic powder and then tired in the peppers.

Instead of cream of mushroom, I used cream of chicken.  I'm not a huge mushroom fan myself and so we usually only keep stock of cream of chicken.

I also forgot to add milk to the mix before I spread it on top...so I just dumped a bit of milk over the top before adding cheese.

The biggest thing I did different was to add a lot of cumin.  Cumin is the basis of taco seasoning, so I thought it would be a good idea.  I didn't have any leftover chicken, so I cooked some up tonight and I seasoned them with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cumin.  Then I also added cumin into the sauce.

We'll definitely make it again.

This was a pleasant surprise.  I was worried if the chilies would be too spicy for my kids even though I got the mild ones.  It is one of the few home made meals that me, my wife, and all four of my kids ate without any modifications!  It's impossible to find a meal that all 6 of us think is perfect, but this we all liked.  We will make it again

Good dish. Easy prep. Followed directions and ingredients ,  except used 4 oz of frozen fresh roasted Hatch Green Chilies instead of canned. Very similar to a dish at a local Mexican Restaurant called Chicken Yolandas.  Will make again!

My husband's favorite but there isn't a lot of filling. It's not my favorite tortilla to filling ratio.  So, when I'm making the filling, I add random stuff - colorful bell peppers, black beans, rice, etc. More filling = more flavor needed so I add another can of green chilis.  Great cheat to make adding extra stuff easier - use 90 second rice (I use 2 pouches) so you can nuke it and toss it in without making more dishes.

I did use 2 cans chic soup. Added taco seasoning to the chicken. Cumin,garlic powder, mild green chilis in a can, red peppers, and shallots. 1 cup milk to sauce on top. Use large corn tortillas next time.

I have made this many times.  It's perfect.  The only time I make changes to this recipe is when I am out of something.  I have used yellow onions, Cream of Chicken soup and minced garlic and I usually have the smaller tortillas.  A great use of left over chicken.  I will make it again.

A great way to use leftover roasted or rotisserie chicken!!  These were good but something was missing/off. The sauce needed more seasoning. When I make these again I'm going to add some cilantro, salt & pepper and not add the sauce on top. Instead topping them with the cheese the last 5 minutes of baking then serving them with fresh salsa.

Overall a good recipe.  I agree that this is more of a wet burrito than an enchilada.  I always have to double the recipe to have enough for my family - and find it works perfectly.  A little on the dryer side, try to make a smidge more sauce is you want it more of an enchilada consistency.  
Anyway - My family loves it. Taste is good. Flavors work well together.

My hubby loves the dish! We made 2 tiny adjustments to avoid a trip to the store- we didn't have sour cream but replaced with plain greek yogurt and didn't have canned green chilis but replaced with pickled jalapeños that I minced. It turned out perfectly, we will make again, no doubt.

We made this - we poached the chicken so we could shred instead of doing cubes though. Could use a little heat, but over all great dish.

I made this tonight and it was very good. I made a few changes such as I used half and half instead of milk and I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. I used leftover salsa  chicken from a recipe on here, I omitted the green chili's because I had previously made the salsa chicken with Rotel instead of salsa. It turned out similar to a casserole and was very good. I'll make it again!

This was pretty good. A bit too creamy for my taste. I used corn tortillas, and I think that was a positive change.

I also made burritos with this recipe. Rather than using a whole can of soup I used half because I don't care to have the taste of the condensed soup overpower everything. I added chicken broth about a cup and a half. Oh and I didn't have. green onion so I chopped up very fine half a Mayan onion and cooked it in the butter on low for 15 mins until it started to carmelize. then added all the other ingredients. delicious!

I also made a few changes here and there. It was too creamy for me but aside from that, others have told me those were the best enchiladas they've ever had (Surprisingly!). I was even more surprised when my mother said that even though she's not even an enchilada fan, she absolutely loved it.

I've always been leary of homemade enchiladas because they get so soggy. However, this recipe came out at just the right consistency. Although it only makes 6, it was more than enough to feed 4 adults and 2 kids. Great flavor! It paired great with refried beans and taco rice.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! I made this for our family of 6, so I made this as directed for 12 servings (thinking that everyone could have 2 each) but one each was plenty. I set out shredded lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese, salsa, ect. for topping options for everyone, and we didn't even use them! We just warmed up the leftovers and they were just as good as the first batch. I'll def be making this again! Thank you!

This was a simple green chile chicken enchilada recipe that is relatively mild but still delicious.  It was just what I was looking for.  I have only minor complaints.  First, this does not serve 6, unless you mean six little ones or you have a lot of side dishes.  I doubled the recipe for my family of 7, and even at 12 servings, it was sadly not enough for teenagers.   Also, the tortillas are very lightly stuffed and I prefer much more chicken in the middle of mine so it doesn't seem like just tortilla and sauce.  With a few modifications, it will likely be a family favorite!

We've never had enchiladas before, and we both enjoyed this dish immensely! I followed the recipe except I used Monterey Jack cheese because I didn't have cheddar, and I only had the smaller 8-inch tortillas on hand. I managed to fill eight of them and had plenty of sauce as written. I do like the idea of jazzing it up with taco seasoning or refried beans as other reviewers have suggested, but we liked it just as it was. It was very easy to put together. Thanks for the recipe and the inspiration for our first introduction to enchiladas!

Made it a bit lower fat (light sour cream, much less butter, less cheese). A little bland, but a HUGE hit with the kids, and I could pump up the spices with some jalepenos or more seasonings if I chose. I will make again. SUPER easy, great use for leftover chicken.
5/10/17- made it again, added cumin, chili powder, adobe seasoning (a lot) and when serving, served with jalapeños & chipotle hot sauce. Huge hit with adults & kids again.

Subbed Rotel as I didn't have green chilies and cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.  Added a can of black beans, cumin and chili powder.

They were the best Enchiladas I have ever had! The only thing I changed was that Instead of using 1/4 of the sauce for the filling I used 1/2. It turned out perfect! We are going to make this again for sure!

I have been making this for years! It is a family favorite.  My husband loves to smoke meat.  When he does a brisket, or a pork butt, I always have him smoke a roasting hen as well.  I use smoked chicken to make this dish.  It has become my signature go to for visiting family or friends.  They all love it.

This recipe is wonderful!  The only change was to use 2 cups of cooked chicken ( from a pre-cooked Deli Chicken) and I didn't have diced green chilies so used a 7 ounce can of Herdez Salsa Verde.  I will use this next time I make this recipe.  It added great flavor.  I will be making this delicious recipe often...

Yummy! I modified recipe a little. I added 1 can cream of mushroom, one can cream of chicken and extra sour cream and then added a little cayenne pepper to the sauce to make it more spicy but red pepper flakes would work too. 

They were tasty and heated up well the next day for leftovers. Will make again!

Great recipe! My kids made it with us as a family. we changed the green onions to half a regular onion caramelized in butter. we also left out the green chili's. we used a whole 16oz bag of cheddar cheese on top which made it yummy good. the kids had seconds which means it was great! It was so good we mage it 2 nights, back to back.

I really like like this recipes as is. The flavors were pretty good and my only annoyance was that in the given recipe I don't feel it allowed nearly enough filling or sauce, so plan on doubling this. I have read many of the other reviews and to be honest if I wanted an authentic real Mexican chicken enchilada I would go out and eat at an authentic restaurant and get one there. I think this is simple, quick and easy for a fast meal at home. Obviously if you have a lot more time you could add a whole lot to this recipe and make a whole bunch of substitutions, but as a mom I just don't have the time. It is a great base recipe and my family enjoyed it immensely.

I usually don't even like enchiladas, but these were amazing. My boyfriend and I demolished them. I used diced jalapenos instead of the green chiles for an extra kick.

This was a really easy and fast recipe to follow! Because I live in an area where some ingredients are harder to come by I changed the recipe a bit but still got great results. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, powdered mushroom soup mix (cooked with less water to keep the soup thick) instead of condensed mushroom soup, and shredded mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. I found that the soup and yogurt sauce was a little more watery, but that really didn't bother me or sacrifice flavor.The sauce soaked in right the tortilla shell really well in the oven. I added the rest of my cheese in the last 5 minutes of baking as I found it only took about 15 minutes to cook.

The recipe itself is good and real quick to make. My only beef with it is the servings are way too small. I'm not a glutton but I can only fill three tortillas with the allotted amount. Next time I'm going to double the filling so maybe I'll actually use all six tortillas. Again the recipe itself is awesome and my wife (whom is a picky eater) LOVES this dish out of all the ones I have found on here.

Really tasty!  Next time I will set aside more sauce and add more chicken because I like my enchiladas a bit more plump.  But that's just a personal preference.  I will make this again!

This was good and easy. I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom and added a little taco seasoning to the chicken mixture. I think some cilantro would be really good in the mix too. This will def stay in our rotation for dinner.

Let me try this again. My initial review was edited and not by me.  I have made these enchiladas several times and only recently reviewed it. This recipe uses a can of condensed soup.  If you are like me, you avoid using the gloopy-gloppy cans of condensed soup. It is very easy to make your own cream soup base and it takes less than 5 minutes.  You can find a recipe for "cream soup base" on this site and several on other sites. It really is worth the few extra minutes and is so simple and a good sub for any recipe that calls for a can of condensed soup. This enchilada recipe goes together easily and is very tasty. It has a good, chewy consistency with pleasant flavors. The flour tortillas reminded me a bit of "dumplings".  I have seen recipes for chicken-n-dumplings where torn-up flour tortillas are added to the chicken stock. Maybe that's what this reminds me of. The green chili's are subtle, and do not make this dish spicy at all. If you're looking for spicy, you may want to add hot peppers or pepper flakes. I think you could easily adapt or add flavors you and your family likes. Thanks for submitting. This is a keeper!

We love this recipe, and have been making it for years!  Along the way I’ve made a few tweaks that are even more yummy:

I use cream of ONION soup, not it’s not overly onion flavored.
I add 1/2 cup water to the sauce BEFORE dividing, and no milk at the end
I double the garlic powder, and add 1 1/2 tsp cumin
I use 2 1/4 cups chicken
I use Monteray Jack cheese instead of cheddar.

Love these. The only thing we did different was we use the Fiesta Nacho Cheese soup in place of the cream of mushroom because hubby doesn't like mushrooms, we also added a little more cheese on top.

I love these. They aren't super "traditional" but they are rich & yummy. I substitute plain (NOT vanilla) yogurt for sour cream & can't taste a difference! Also add squash & broccoli. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

Have made this recipe a few times and a good recipe for white chicken enchiladas. I do substitutions as well: substitute flour for corn tortillas and cream of mushroom for cream of chicken. Also add a little cumin, and make my own pico to add to top when serving.

My kiddos even ate it! I only did two things differently. I eliminated the green onions because the hubby wont eat them. I also added finely chopped frozen spinach to it. Didnt even taste it and just added our veggie!

I think this would be a good base but it lacks in flavor and the soup was overpowering. I might try again but I would definitely make several changes.

Pretty good! I made this exactly as written (except I chopped up 1/3 of an onion instead of using green onions) and I used corn tortillas instead as well. I felt in the end that this could use another can of the green chilies. I also finely chopped an onion over each serving, and found myself reaching for the Louisiana sauce. Because I thought it was just a little bit bland for my southwestern taste. Good recipe though!

Followed the exact recipe. The recipe didn't say how to cook the chicken...so I sliced the chicken into thin stripes, seasoned it with garlic powder, salt and pepper and sauteed it in Butter/oil with garlic. Good recipe, will make again.

The kids like it more than the adults. It is quick and easy. More of a baked burrito with a cream sauce than an enchilada but the flavor was ok for picky kids.

I made this recipe as written but substituted ingredients to make it gluten free for my kid with celiac. I used GF cream of mushroom soup and corn tortillas. I left the pan of enchiladas cooking in the oven with instructions for my teenage son to pull out when ready, and I headed out to a meeting. I returned to an empty casserole dish. Not a crumb left! This recipe got rave reviews and will be enjoyed again in our house. I think it's easy enough to teach my teenagers to prepare too. Regarding the corn tortillas, there is no need to fry them in oil. Just pop a couple at a time in to the microwave for 20 - 30 seconds to warm them. Then quickly fill each tortilla before they cool. Super easy and scrumptious!

Wow. I wanted something a little different so I figured I'd give this a shot! I'm so glad we did. These are mouth watering. My husband absolutely loved these too. The ONLY thing I did different was took out the gluten. I used corn tortillas instead and also made my own cream of chicken instead of mushroom. Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe is great but in the future I would but more stuffing ingredients.  I only filled up 3 10 inch tortillas with the ingredient measurements provided, and it didn't even fill them fully.  A very tasty recipe.

I made this and didn't have the green onions but used cooking onions instead and it was still delicious!  I also added Monterey Jack cheese to the top.  I think you can tweak this recipe by adding or subtracting a couple of ingredients and it is still good either way!  I will try cream of chicken soup sometime and see if that changes the flavor.  The cream of mushroom soup was awesome with it too!

Taste=3 1/2 stars, easiness=4 stars. I cooked and cut the chicken the night before, to save time. These are pretty good and perfect for a busy night. Tip: use whole wheat tortillas and "healthy request" or "low sodium" Campbell's cream of mushroom soup.

Love the spicy creaminess. How can you go wrong, eh. Next time I'll use fire roasted chiles and more chili powder to spice it up Southwestern style. In addition to sliced black olives, I'll add a bit of fresh corn. I also made half with flour and half with corn tortillas. Heat them with olive oil spray in a medium hot pan so they roll easily. Enchiladas are all about the cheeses you use and the spices in the sauce.

Very tasty.  Topped with guacamole, salsa, and sour cream.  Flour tortillas worked well.  I used 4-10" tortillas lined vertically in a greased 9x13.  Cut them in half to serve and thus we had about 8 servings which filled us up.

Delicious!  I substituted cream of chicken soup for the mushroom soup and omitted the butter and green onions.  I also added a little bit of ground cumin to the mix.  Instead of using the mixture to coat the pan, I greased my glass baking dish with a thin coating of vegetable oil so I could use most of the mix inside the enchiladas and put a thin coating on top.  I covered the pan with aluminum foil while it baked and served it with salsa and sour cream.  Can't wait to make them again!

This was a great recipe! I made a few changes, first by ignoring the call for pre-cooked, cubed chicken (ew) and instead making my own pan-fried (no breading) chicken breasts. They were marinated southwest style. After cooking them I chopped them into small, thin pieces. I the immediately made the sauce, ignoring the call for onions and using Cream of Chicken soup instead. Instead of adding the cheese to the chicken, I added it right into the sauce to let it melt. I also used salt, garlic salt, black pepper, and hot sauce to give the sauce more dimension. I mixed 1/4 of the sauce with my chicken, loaded and rolled my enchiladas, smothered them with the rest of the sauce and cheese, and baked until the sauce bubbled. It was a huge success! Would definitely make this again, tweaking the recipe further to change it up. Delicious and simple!

This recipe was very easy to make, but the chicken was too bland. The sauce was delicious, but the chicken really ruined it for me. Next time I will add some spices to help.

I like heat and there isn't any in the original recipe.  The basic recipe is great, but we'll be adding fresh poblanos instead of the green chilies next time.  And Cholula sauce to the sauce. Just for some bite.

These enchiladas were great! Pretty quick and easy to make too, which is always a plus. I mixed up the filling and sauce, filled the enchiladas, and then put them and the sauce in the refrigerator while I was at work. When my husband came home from work he put them in the oven to bake until I got home. It worked out perfectly for us on busy days like this! Both of my boys ate this really well, and my two year old LOVED it. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!

We always used a different enchilada recipe and were looking for a change of pace. This didn't disappoint. Took a bit longer but worth it

I followed the recipe as described and it tasted a bit bland. Topping it off with some hot salsa made the dish better.

Yes!  A new family favorite!  I took another reviewer's advice and used a little fresh lime juice, a lemon pepper rotisserie chicken, chopped fresh cilantro on top before covering with cheese for extra flavor.  Easy to make a lower fat version if you want.

It was very good. My daughter who tries everything wouldn't eat much of it because if all the chunks (mushroom and chiles). It could use a few jalapeños.

I made this recipe exactly except an addition of oregano 
(1.5 tsp in the oil)and chile sauce to taste. These additions made the dish 5x better and even then it was just 'okay.' It's not terrible by any means, there's just not a real wow factor. I will only keep it around because of its easy factor... It took me about 25 minutes of prep.

Great recipe.  I didn't have green chiles, so substituted green bell pepper.  Also, used fresh garlic.  I was afraid it wouldn't taste authentic without the chiles, but it was quite good even without them.  I'll make this one again.

Since I tend to have the ingredients always on hand, I like to make these with leftover chicken.  It's a great enchilada casserole that family and friends love.  However, if you're wanting "authentic", look elsewhere.

This is REALLY bland. I exchanged the cream of mushroom sauce for cream of chicken.  Then, I seasoned the sauce/chicken mixture with a ton of Southwest flavor Mrs. Dash, Tabasco sauce, and a little salt and pepper to taste.  The extra spices (mainly the Mrs. Dash) made all the difference.  In fact, with my changes this was REALLY good; creamy and spicy.  I will keep the recipe only because of my changes.  However, I don't think I should have to do all the extra work for a recipe that rates this high.  Very disappointing.

I loved the flavor of the sauce and cheese and will definately make it again.  That said, I will not use flour tortillas again.  These should be made with corn tortillas.  The flour tortillas end up slimy and mushy.

These were absolutely YUMMY! Wanting to try something a little different than the typical Enchilada, this creamy chicken sauce was a BIG hit in our family! I used half of a rotisserie chicken for my convenience and only made 4 (as we like our tortillas a bit more "plump") but followed everything else as directed.  Thank you!

This is super good - and I like the flour tortillas.  I only substituted cream of chicken soup for the mushroom and chili powder for the garlic powder simply because I had a garlic allergy to contend with.  But I'm sure it would have been just as good either way.  I will definitely do this one again...and again...and again.

Great.  Entire family liked it.  I felt that it could have had a little more sauce.  But really good overall.

Yummy yum yum yum! I did an ingredient search and found this recipe and have already made it twice in the past 2 weeks. Seem to always have frozen chicken and cream of mushroom soup available so this was perfect!

These were really good!!!  I used a left over slow cooker chicken and instead of regular flour tortillas I used whole wheat tortillas.  I also used a large can of cream of mushroom and I used more than suggested for the filling.  It turned out great.  It was very heavy, so maybe next time I might use enchilada sauce to top it off.

Yummy Yum Yum!
Was awesome!  I doubled the sauce so instead of cream of mushroom I used a can of light cream of celery and light cream chicken.  I used a bit of enchilada sauce on top too.  Easy and delish.

This recipe doesn't have the wow factor, but it isn't bad either. It's a quick weekday meal that everyone can fill up on and enjoy. No hot spicy flavors here, which is good for families with younger children who prefer more mild tastes. I used whole wheat flour tortillas and spread a little sauce on the bottom of the pan to keep the tortillas from drying out and toughening up during baking. A good basic recipe to add variety to the weekly dinner menu.

I thought this recipe was just okay.  I looked at some of the other reviews and added a few things to spice it up..more garlic, added aboaut half a packet of taco seasoning, cayenne pepper and I did double the sauce.  I still found it a bit bland.  The kids ate it up and thought it was great.  I just didn't really care too much for it.  I'm still on the search for that perfect chicken enchilada recipe.

This was a great recipe.  Followed advice and added chili powder, garlic, and cumin to sauce for flavor.  I ended up using low carb wraps as they had more of a flavor of a torn tortilla then a flour tortilla, plus it was healthier!  With salsa, guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes,this was delicious!

Great fast recipe! Even better with leftover chicken but you can use boneless chick breast-I added 1/2 pkt of Taco seasoning to the chicken and about 1/2 of a 12oz can of corn and served with yellow rice and is a family pleaser

These were awesome! I substituted regular onion because that's what I had on hand. I also used leftover rotisserie chicken. The chicken was so moist. So easy. The leftovers reheat easily in the microwave too. I'll definitely make these again.

I found the basics for this recipe to be a good start.  I agree with previous comments that it is a little bland.  I made the following changes which worked out very nice.  I will make this again and again.  I stuck with the flour tortillas for this recipe.
4-5 Chicken breast coated in Taco Seasoning and cooked till done in olive oil and garlic; then shredded.  I did not add sauce to the chicken while cooking.
Sauce:
1 can cream of chicken and mushroom soup (this is a combo can).  
2/3 cup sour cream
1/3 cup milk
7 oz chopped green chilies
2 tbsp Taco Seasoning
1 tsp Cumin
1 tsp Chili Powder
1 tbsp Cilantro
Use 2 heaping tbsp of sauce per enchilada
Add additional milk to remaining sauce before pouring over chicken.
Use whatever cheese you like.  I used a Mexican blend and added it as layer when filling the enchiladas instead of putting it in the sauce.
This makes 6 large (burritos), lol... er enchiladas.
Cook at 350 for 35-40 min.  Suggest to top with cheese last 15 min.
Next time I might try to incorporate some cream cheese into this in place of the sour cream, or use both.

I am not a Latina, and don't hold to the "you have to use this kind of tortilla" school.  I absolutely admire anyone who argues for ethnic correctness.  But, I absolutely cannot STAND corn tortillas, so I would have made this with flour anyway.  This was fairly easy, and when I licked the spoon, it tasted wonderful.  I did follow the advice of others and do one can of cr. of mush, and one cr. of chix.  Delightful.  I am a sauce person, and this worked for me.  Oh, I also used rotissierie chix- good comment there.  Better than I could have made it.  Thank you.

I, like others changed a few things for the taste of my family, but the basic recipe is the base, and I will be making these over and over again.  Corn tortillas, som enchilada sauce, and some red pepper  and cumin were my basic changes.  thanks so much for a keeper.

This is a great recipe! I had my doubts from the ingredients, but it had such high reviews that I gave it a try.  I followed suggestions made by other reviews: added taco seasoning to my chicken, doubled the sauce by using 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken.  Awesome!

This recipe is awesome!!! The only thing about it is that the filling for the tortillas is too much of a small amount. I'm a person who likes their burritos, tacos, and enchiladas full. If you are serving 6 people or an amount that will eat all of this or not I would definitely double everything besides the tortillas!

Very good!  I made it with corn and flour tortillas.  The corn tasted much better, the flour was really mushy the next day.  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup.  Very good!

I made this and my daughter and I loved it! the only thing different that I did was instead of using green onions, I used sweet yellow onions and it turned out great!

Excellent flavor!  I put three in one pan and baked for supper, and froze another small pan with 3 for another quick meal down the road.  We loved this!

This is the second time I have made these.  Learning from the first time around, instead of canned cream of mushroom soup, which contains MSG (most of them anyway), I found a recipe on this site for "Cream Soup Base," then halved it for the correct amount, and used that instead.  I also added sliced black olives, used brown onion instead of green (for more flavor), used shredded chicken instead of cubed (from a $4.00 rotisserie chicken at Costco - what a deal and how convenient!), and added a small can of green enchilada sauce in place of the milk (because I thought the original recipe was a bit bland) and coated the bottom of the pan with a layer of sauce (so the tortillas didn't come out dry).  I plan to make it a third time, however, and I am going to add cumin and maybe some cayanne to the "Cream Soup Base" and double the chicken mixture (it just didn't seem like enough filling).  Also, I may try corn tortillas, as others have suggested. So... the original recipe gets a "3," my second attempt gets a "4," and I'm hoping my third will be a "fiver." We'll see!

Very quick and easy and delicious. I didn't have green onions so used a quarter cup of chopped regular onions. I also added half a package of drained frozen spinach and a handful of canned corn, to use up leftovers. I also added a chopped jalopeno pepper to add some spice. Instead of setting aside 3/4 of the sauce, I set aside half to avoid a dry filling because of the added veggies. No matter what you add to it, it is a great base for enchiladas.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made it for a gathering, and there was nothing left.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the fact that I made some changes and to me, a perfect five-star rating means it doesn't require changes.  These were personal preferences, and others may feel they're not needed.  To me, how the chicken is cooked is as important as anything else.   I oven-roasted the chicken, rubbed with vegetable oil, salted (both sides), pepper, ground Bay seasoning, garlic powder, three splashes of liquid smoke, topped with ten thin pats of butter (quadrupled recipe).  Cover. Oven 325 1.5 hours.  I adapted this to my taste first by following others' suggestions to use cream of chicken soup, only that's the only kind I used...no cream of mushroom.  Since I quadrupled the recipe, I halved the amount of green chilies, and then oven-roasted four poblano peppers rubbed with vegetable oil on 300 for an hour-and-a-half, cut off the tops, removed the seeds and skin, then blended them to a puree with an immersion blender.  From that puree, I took about four tablespoons and added it to the soup mixture in the pan.   Since the poblanos were a tad bitter, I added a tablespoon of sugar to the soup mixture.  Another change:  instead of cheddar, I used Monterrey Jack.  I then followed a reviewer's suggestion to use white corn tortillas and heat them in hot oil. These were a HUGE HIT.  My husband loved them as well.  I'll continue to make this in this way in the future.

I tried these just as the recipe states and they were very good; however, I like more heat so I added about 1/8 cup of canned sliced jalapenos...DELICIOUS! I make them all the time now!

Quick and Easy recipe.  I took the time to shred the chicken and it was worth it.  I used corn tortillas because we prefer corn for enchiladas. Also used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom and yellow onion instead of green.  Turned out great!

This is a super easy kid friendly dish that you can make with different meat - I've used canned chicken, deli sliced turkey chopped up, rotisserie chicken...  I left out the green chiles when the kids were little.

This was delicious. Better than anything you can get at a restaurant!  Here's a tip...this is way better with corn tortillas. Just warm in mircowave until soft and then roll chicken mixture up inside.
I also love Taco Bell taco seasoning, so I added it to the chicken when I was cooking it. Shred the chicken instead of chopping. Yum!

I was skeptical about this recipe but it turned out absolutely wonderful. I cooked my chicken with some garlic salt and pepper and shredded it when it was cool enough to handle. I did use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom just because its what I had and it was very yummy. I think I also forgot to add the milk but it still worked great.  Have made it twice so far and see myself making it a regular meal in my house.

This was excellent. It might not be authentic with flour tortillas but it's still very good which is what counts. I also used a few cloves of sliced garlic instead of garlic powder. Since I needed to serve 8 I used 2 cans of cream of chicken ( instead of mushroom) soup and upped the chicken to 2 cups and the cheddar also to two cups.
        I used a large sheet pan.

A very good recipe; the kids loved it. I added a little extra cheese used a chicken breast that was cooked in chicken broth seasoned with cumin and garlic. Instead of canned soup I used home-made cremini mushroom soup. The extra step added 15 to 20 minutes overall.  My reward for the extra work, I didn’t have any left-overs to put away.

Great recipe, however, ENCHILADAS ARE MADE WITH CORN TORTILLAS!!! I swear every recipe I have ever found for enchiladas uses flour tortillas. I don't understand why because enchiladas taste sooo much better with corn tortillas and that is the way they are supposed to be made, no matter what you put in/on them! Corn tortillas are a lot healthier for you then flour tortillas as well.

I don't know where you are all from but this is NOT an enchilada! You do not use flour tortillas for one. This is some sort of burrito.

Delicious! First thought that came to my mind: this tastes EXACTLY like the Safeway brand enchiladas and my whole family agreed. Made recipe as stated except I used corn tortillas, but I'm sure it would have been tasty with flour tortillas. Be sure to make 2 batches so everyone can share in the yumminess.

Love this!  I used corn tortillas instead of flour (more traditional for enchiladas) and used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom.  Piece of cake to make, and even my two year old ate it and said it was "tasty!"

I am a very picky eater and I was able to enjoy these. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because with the flour tortillas the enchiladas came out a bit soggy. Next time I am going to try corn tortillas and serve them over some rice.

Absolutely awesome. These are my husband and I's favorite enchiladas (although, I agree, they're more like burritos). We always add tomatoes to ours, and two cans of diced chiles, but other than that I keep the recipe the same. A little time consuming, but DEFINITELY worth it.

Great base recipe. Following the suggestion of others, I added a few more spices: cumin, smoked paprika, and a dash of cayenne. I also didn't have any green chiles on hand, so I used half a can of chipotle peppers instead, which made it VERY spicy. Yum!

Pretty good. I have tried another recipe that was comparable to this one but instead of using so much condensed soup it called for about a half cup of cream cheese. really good

These enchiladas were good. My husband liked them a lot. I will make them again, but I will add more spices such as chili powder and coriander. They just needed a little extra "kick" for me.

My daughter and I loved them.  My husband felt 4 stars were appropriate.  I added taco seasoning to the meat (used pork but would prefer chicken).  Added taco seasoning and salsa to the sauce to taste.  Used homemade tortillas.  Made them the way I usually do with all the sauce on the outside of the tortilla.

THE BEST CHICKEN ENCHILADA RECIPE I HAVE FOUND. LOVED THEM! I SKIPPED OUT ON THE ONIONS AND USED COSTCO'S PRE-COOKED CHICKEN STRIPS. WONDERFUL! I INVITED COMPANY OVER AND MADE THESE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THEY WERE A HIT. DEF. A KEEPER! THANKS FOR POSTING :) I WANT TO MAKE LOW CARB ONES FOR MY MOM, SO JUST SUBSTITUTE LOW CARB TORTILLAS.

I agree that corn tortillas are the only way to go.  I have been making a similar recipe for years and simply boil water in a small pot with a small rack over the top, and steam the corn  tortillas prior to filling. They become pliable within seconds. and it saves on fat and calories.

I have never left a review before, but these were by far the best enchiladas I have ever had!  I picked hot green chile's instead of the mild, and gave it an extra zing that was amazing!

These are by far the best chicken enchilada recipe I have found! The only change that I make is to use yellow corn tortillas as that is what really makes them "enchiladas" and not "burritos".  I have added a can of drained tomatoes and green chilis for a variation.  We serve with homemade spanish rice and black beans.  My entire family raves about this recipe.  I like to buy a roasted chicken from my local grocery store to help impart some flavor, or even use fajita chicken breasts which you cook ahead of time.  Awesome!

Like other reviewers this is a good base recipe. To keep it simple I made the sauce without the milk and doubled the cheese. Once the tortillas are stuffed and in the dish I had no sauce left. (4 enchiladas) So I poured enchilada sauce around the enchiladas and a bit over and cooked. Turned out wonderful and gave them that bit of bite that these need. Other wise it would be a bit bland.

I really want to give this recipe more stars.  However I just can't.  I doubled the sauce like other suggested and it was better, however it does not make enough filling to fill all 6 tacos, I could only get 4 and they were not very full, a small line of filling.  Also there is too much sour cream, I will use half next time.  It was too bland, it is a great recipe otherwise and very easy to do.  I am glad that I finally found a good non tomato enchilada recipe that I can change up to make better.  I would definitely make again but I will be changing and adding stuff.

I loved the chicken enchiladas and my family did too! The only thing that threw me off is that I should have used corn tortillas instead of flour because the flour was just too much... flour lol The next time I make these, I'll be using corn! Other than that, everything came out great. :)

Even my husband, who does not like sour cream or enchiladas in sour cream sauce, thought this was good!  He did suggest adding red enchilada sauce to it next time and I will try that since it was even better with salsa on the side.  I premixed the filling and left in the fridge 2 days to marry the flavors.  I did the same with the sauce for the top.  I used 6 smaller tortillas and the filling was perfect.

This is SO easy and delicious...and filling.  I didn't get 6 servings;  I only got 4.  I thought it made more sauce than needed so you could just cook a little extra chicken and make an additional 1 or 2 enchiladas.

Did not like at all.  I felt there was not enough flavor.  Maybe chicken was done too much.  The skillet enchiladas on this site, was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  But this recipe did not cut it.

BEST enchiladas I have ever made! I love that the inside sauce mixture is also spread over the outside. It made the flavors consistent and I added a lot more green chilies to our batch. I also only had it in the over for 20 minutes as that is what works best at a higher elevation.

This recipe was great for my family of 5 and a little one. with plenty leftover for the next day. I did use white onion, and 3 garlic cloves, with rotisseri chicken, and a few dashes of chilli powder, instead of the green onion and garlic powder. mmm mmm so delicioso!!

This was just okay. A little bland. I added taco seasoning and used rotel as other reviewers suggested. Not sure what it needs to kick up the flavor.

Delicious!  Roll enchiladas thin or else you only get 3 fat ones (burrito size).  Goes great with a side of refried beans and spanish rice.

I just made them and I only got 3 tortillas rolled (not overly filled either) and was out of filling!?  I had to quickly make up a second batch to make 6 flour tortillas.

Great recipe! The only thing I added, was 1/4 pkg of chicken taco seasoning to the water I used to boil the chicken, and some minced onion to give the chicken a little extra flavor. With the remaining 3/4 pkg of the seaoning, i added it to the sauce. YUMMY!

These turned out great! The only problem I has was the tortillas I bought from the store were so old they didn't roll properly without disentegrating - I ended up having to make an echilada layered pie instead! I made them spicy by adding jalapeno, too.

Absolutely delicious! My only complaint was the listed proportions. I tripled the recipe to make 10 medium enchiladas with plenty of extra sauce on top. If you like your enchiladas saucy, just make extra.

I used this recipe as a base. I live in a country where I cannot find many canned items, so I had to make them from scratch. I made a cream of chicken substitute and used that instead of the Campbell's soup can. I also made an enchilada sauce from scratch and included that inside and on top of the tortillas. On top I put some cilantro, olives, and tomatoes. This recipe is a nice base, but I fear it would have been bland if I had not included the enchilada sauce.

There wasn't anything special about this to us.  It was fine, but not worthy of 4 or 5 stars.  I did have to use 1/4 cup plain yogurt instead of all sour cream because I didn't have enough...maybe that hurt it.

Excellent!  There were only two things that I had to change, the mushroom soup had to be changed to cream of chicken (husband doesn't like mushrooms) and the cheddar cheese was shredded mexican, which was all I had on hand.  It was PERFECT.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I liked the fact that this chicken enchilada recipe was quick and easy especially for busy people.  However, this recipe needed something extra to give it a "kick".  I will use this recipe again, but I will experiment more.

This was sooo good!!  I layered it instead of rolling the tortillas.  I didn't have any green chilies but will definitely make again with it.  I added a can of cream of chicken so that I had more sauce.  I also used leftover pollo asada chicken I had bought at costco.  It was GREAT!!

Whoa golly - these are so good and creamy and delicious...  The recipe was supposed to make 6, but I ended up making only 3.  Next time I'll increase the recipe to make a few more.

Cooked frozen chicken in slow cooker for about 4 hours on high, then shredded with a fork. Then followed the rest of the recipe...they were amazing!

This was AMAZING!  I thought the cream soup was a little weird when I read it, but now I'm convinced that restaurants use it in their enchilada sauce.  I added black beans to the filling, used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom, and added a little salsa to the sauce that went over the enchiladas.  It was SO good!  My husband said that it was better than a restaurant.  I served with Mexican Rice II, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, and guacamole.  YUM!

This is a good version, but it's definitely not authentic. My husband hates chicken, but LOVES this recipe. Whenever I mention I am making chicken enchiladas, he wants this one. I add low-sodium cream of chicken and cream of mushroom. Instead of green onions, I use green chiles. I don't add milk to my recipe and I usually use leftover chicken to save on time. I recommend this recipe to those who don't like traditional enchilada's...although my personal favorite is the corn tortilla. I also use chili powder on my chicken and in my sauce along with the garlic powder, it's not spicy, but it gives it excellent flavor.

Great recipe! I tried spraying the corn tortillas to make them more pliable (as suggested by another reviewer) but they broke a bit anyway. This hardly mattered though - it was still delicious!

I made a few adjustments. I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken.  I also used corn tortillas instead of flour. To soften them a little I fried the tortillas for merely a few seconds then rolled them.

Yum!  This is one of those meals that is so good you can eat it for days without getting sick of it.  I haven't had green onions, so I have just used powdered onion and it is so good.  We have added this into our normal menu.

OK, I had to make a couple of changes because I really wanted to try this recipe, but I didn't have any "leftover" chicken.  So, I threw some chicken breasts in the slow cooker with some enchilada sauce.  And, because it was 2 lbs of chicken, I doubled the sauce.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious!  I absolutely loved it, and I can't wait to dig in to the leftovers.

These were SO good. I spread refried beans on the tortilla before adding the chicken mixture and it made them very easy to keep together. I also used mexican cheese mix instead of the cheddar. I will definately make these again.

This was okay, but I prefer red sauce for my enchiladas. This was way too soupy. I might try again using cream of chicken instead. Cream of mushroom was a bit weird.

I used this recipe, but made a few changes.  I used green enchilada sauce instead of the soup. I used mozzarella cheese. I used my bullet to chop/shred the chicken. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. I did not use milk. I put a dab of sour cream and enchilada sauce inside the tortillas. I put sliced olives and green onions on top.

very good. i did like others and in lieu of milk i used 1/4 cup enchilada sauce. The only think i will do differently next time is omit the green chilies, did not like that taste but over all very good.

Extremely easy, fast and tasty! My only complaint is that there is no heat to it... next time I will add some jalapenos to the mix. Also I diced up some mushrooms and sauteed with the green onion to give it a bit more depth and it turned out great. I will definitely be making this again.

I love this recipe! I make it exactly as written. They heat up beautifully and it's a great way to use up any leftover chicken. Try shredding your chicken instead of cubing, it gives a great texture!

These were so good! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I did make some changes based off other reviews. To save time I got a rotisserie chicken and shredded the meat instead of cubed. Also the reserved sauce for the top, instead of adding milk, I added enchilada sauce. Served with sour cream and green onions, yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly as stated and these were kind of bland.  I normally find recipes on here to be 5 stars in tastiness, but these weren't.  They looked pretty because the green onions gave the sauce some color, but they didn't taste very good.  If I make them again, I would probably tinker with the ingredients so that they would be more flavorful.

This came out so awesome I have been asked for the recipe by one of my friends who doesn't even like to cook! The boyfriend is asking for it again soon and we just had it not too long ago! The only thing I did different is instead of cooking chicken or buying chicken in a can (eww) I went to the grocery store and bought a rotisserie chicken and shredded it. The smokey flavor really added a nice touch to the recipe.

This has become a family favorite! I changed a few things from the original recipe too. I use the Perdue southwestern chicken strips to make it even easier, and add more flavor. And since my husband likes sauce, I doubled the sauce recipe by using 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup of sour cream. I also cover the dish with aluminum foil for the first 15 minutes of baking. I think having more sauce and covering the dish also helps with preventing the ends of the tortillas from becoming dry. YUMMY!

This was delicious. I was a little leery about the whole soup thing but it turned out great. I used a couple of suggestions from previous reviews: Cream of chicken soup, taco seasoning in with the chicken and doubled the sauce recipe. They turned out great and my guests couldn't get over how good they were. I couldn't find corn tortilla's in the size I wanted so I went with flour and they still turned out great! This one is a keeper.

This was delicious!  My husband, 6 year old and super picky 2 year old loved it.  I made it just as the recipe calls for and thought it was great.  It reminded me a little of the chicken enchilada suprema from Chi Chi's which I loved.

I have never made or eaten Enchiladas before, for that matter, so I have nothing to compare this to, but it was YUMMY! And personally I like the flour tortillas over the corn. All I did different was added taco seasoning to the chicken after I cooked it to give it more flavor.  The sauce was really good and I wished I had made more as suggested by others. Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe. P.S. My kids were a little turned off by the look of the cheese smothered tortillas, so I served just the chicken mixture over rice to them and they gobbled it up.

Love this recipe!  I recommend doubling the sauce to really fill the tortillas up and piling a ton of cheese on before putting it in the oven.  :)  Delicious!

Tried this recipe the other night and the family absolutely loved it! I was forced to use instant mushroom soup cooked in milk instead of water, but the enchiladas still came out great.

My husband loves this recipe. I personally love flour tortillas and I love how they get extra soft in the sauce. I double the sauce and use cream of chicken in place of the mushroom. The sauce is a little bland so next time I'm going to try putting some salsa in to give it some extra flavor.

Very good recipe, although it took a bit longer because I didn't have cooked chicken. I sauted fresh sliced mushrooms with the filling and it went well with the topping. I was always skeptical about enchiladas with cream soup in them, but my husband doesn't seem to like any of the red enchilada sauces I've made, and he said these were his favorite enchiladas I've made. I used 1 clove fresh garlic, low fat sour cream, and seasoned the chicken with chili powder and a little cumin and crushed red pepper.

Delicious and Easy! I used ready-to-use frozen Tyson Fully Cooked Oven Roasted Diced Chicken Breast (thawed prior to mixing)and followed the recipe as written. My husband and son argued over who would get the one enchilada that was left over!

I love this recipe! I mixed some of the previous advice. For example, I make double the sauce and I add a little chili powder as well. Also, I tend to mix up what kind of soup I use. I'll use Cream of Chicken, Cream of Mushroom, or Cream of Celery. My husband prefers simply the Cream of Chicken. Enjoy!

I am always afraid to try a new recipe in my house, but this recipe went over well!  The kids weren't so sure about it at first, but they ended up really liking it!  It was really good, but I gave it 4 stars because I didn't feel that it tasted very Mexican.  Next time I will add a few more spices and wait to add the cheese topping until a few minutes before taking it out of the oven (It was a bit overcooked).  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used my Thanksgiving leftover turkey in this recipe.  I also added some red and yellow bell peppers that I had already diced.  It was delicious.  I will use this recipe for my enchiladas often.  I think it would even be good with ground beef too.

This was a good base recipe as most have said, not "authentic", but a good Americanized version, especially if you like mild, creamy, cheesy enchiladas, which my family does. I doubled the recipe, added extra seasonings as suggested and to taste, used boiled legs, thighs and breast for meat variety, and then added an extra can of crm chicken and milk to stretch the sauce. Adults liked it, could build up the spicy with other toppings, kids liked it because it was mild enough and easy to eat. Served with spanish rice and sweet corn cake  and it was a real hit.

My family loved this recipe! The only thing I changed was for the sauce that was poured over the enchiladas, I added some velveeta cheese. One thing that  I would like to change would be to give them a little bit more spice, but for kids this recipe is perfect.

Delicious!  My husband made these for me for my birthday dinner a few days ago, and they were SO GOOD.  Despite the reviews that corn tortillas are more authentic, these are very tasty with flour.  My husband made a double batch with no adjustments besides using twice as much of everything, and these were the best I've ever had.  Better than my mother's ... don't tell her I told you.

Wow! I was quite surprised this turned out really really good, despite forgetting to grease the baking dish. This was way better than all the enchiladas I had in different Mexican joints. I didn't change any part of the recipe. Just topped it with cilantro and red pepper flakes after baking and had jalapenos as a side dish.

These are yummy.  The white sauce adds a lot of flavor and moisture to the chicken.  I've tried it both with and without sour cream, both are great, but it's better with the sour cream I think.

I thought this was a great mix of flavor.  I didn't have very many green onions but it didn't seem to affect the flavor too much.  I did use corn tortillas because I can't imagine using flour for enchiladas.  I lightly fried them until they were pliable.  With the measurements of this recipe I was able to make 13 corn tortilla enchiladas.  I would definitely use more chicken and green onions next time.

This is one of our family favorites and my husband, who's from New Mexico, loves it! My only problem is that there never seems to be enough filling for the tortillas and I have to lightly fill them to make as many as I want. Doubling the recipe is a must.

This is an awesome recipe!  I make this at least twice a month.  I add chopped jalapeno on top before popping into the oven.  Thank you for such a great enchilada.

This is a new family favorite.  I only gave four stars because I changed a few things.  I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom, I added more chicken (total of about 2 cups, instead of using all cheddar I used some pepper jack cheese and a few splashes of our favorite hot sauce to give it more of a kick.  I also used a little more milk then the recipes calls for to thin out the sauce.  Plates were cleaned, whole family raved and there were no leftovers.

It's too creamy for my taste. It tastes good though and super easy. But it inspires me to make another one without using the can soup. I will make the cream soup from scratch for  more fresh flavor.

These are getting 4 stars only because of the taste! They are nothing like authentic enchiladas. I've never had enchiladas like this before. That being said, they tasted quite good! Everyone here, including my husband, my 2 y/o daughter, my brother and his girlfriend, and I enjoyed them very much.

An excellent recipe. Everyone loved it, I followed the recipe exactly. Next time though, instead of flour tortillas I am going to try corn tortillas. I thought that the flour tortillas got a little soggy from the creamy sauce. Otherwise, I definitely consider this a keeper!

My family loved these - better than my other enchilada recipe. We prefer the taste of flour tortillas, so no complaints there. I didn't have a can of green chilies - so used a half of a can of diced tomatoes with hot chilies with the juice and omitted the milk. Also used a rotisserie chicken and a added some cooked brown rice to each enchilada. This is my new chicken enchilada!

Still like corn tortillas for the flavor, but this is very simple and easy. Not bad for flour tortillas. Used white onions, added some Mexican chicken seasoning, and some black olives. This is definitely a recipe you can "play" with.

Very good recipe. I did, however, make a few changes. Instead of using cream of mushroom I used cream of chicken. I added half of a green bell pepper and chopped it up with the green onions and sauted them together. I added a tsp of cayenne to give it a bit of a bite and then I doubled the cheese. As an added bonus I put some sliced avocado on top before serving. I'm definately going to make this again.

Excellent! We decided to add traditional enchilada sauce on top and keep the "reserved sauce" for more enchiladas. Either way is scrumptious.

Delicious!  My two changes: to substitute homemade sour cream sauce for the condensed soup/sour-cream combo and to season the chicken before I cooked it...but I'm certain this recipe would be just as good as written.

I did change it a little- I added an extra can of chilis- and a packet of taco seasoning (which was suggested in many reviews). I also used cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom soup because it is all I had. But it was delicious! Even my VERY picky 4 year old gobbled it up! I will be making this often.

AMAZING JUST AS IS!!! This was delish. only additions were extra green onions and black sliced olives on top prior to baking. this was enough for 5 enchiladas (used 2 cups cooked ckn) but plenty for 6 people as it is extremely filling. Spanish rice (zatarains) on the side.....my fav dinner. thanks so much

This recipe was so good!!  My husband does not like onions in any form so I had to leave that off.  I also defrosted/marinated one pound of chicken in Fajita mix all day while I was at work cutting up the raw chicken when I got home and letting it sit for an additional hour before cooking.   It turned out SO go!!!

This recipe was delicious!  I followed the recipe to the T, minus the chilis, which I didn't have on hand.  I actually only used 4 tortillas and stuffed them so that some of the filling oozed out.  I served it with the Mexican Rice II recipe on this site and my husband gave it a 9/10, which he rarely does! I can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow!  Next time, I'm making extras and freezing some.

These are AWESOME!  Made them for the first time yesterday-super easy, quick, & delicious!  My husband loved it, and they were still yummy when re-heated!

These are very good. The only change I make is I add some picante sauce to spice it up just a bit.

I could not believe it when my 10 year old step son said "Wow this is great".  I did a few things different but used this recipe as a guide.  Instead of a green onion I used a Vidalia Onion and added the garlic powder plus some onion powder.  I also added a can of enchilada sauce to the mixture plus the other ingredients.  Next time I am going to try adding some chili powder.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe got such great reviews that I was pretty excited about making it.  In my opinion, it's not that great.  I thought the whole thing tasted like cream of mushroom soup.  Even though I did spice it up for my own tastes, it wasn't enough.

This is a reliable crowd pleaser!  Initially I was uncertain about these enchiladas since usually I think of enchiladas as having a tomato sauce.  Not to worry, excellent flavors.

This is a great all-around recipe. It's fast, easy, and tastes so good. I normally will add some mushrooms, finely chopped onions and green peppers to the sauce mixture, and use the 2% milk and lowfat Sour Cream, and it always comes out great.

1.5 cups of chicken is not enough to fill 6 tortillas. I had to double the amount of chicken AND left out adding the milk and it still wasn't right. It came out a soupy mess without enough substance to it. I also had to add a bunch of spices because otherwise it just tasted like salty condensed soup. I'm not sure how it got so many good reviews.

Very delicious but for some reason, the amount of mixture I had for the tortillas was not nearly enough to make 6 servings. I made sure I read the recipe correctly and I did so I suggest using smaller tortillas to stretch into more servings.

Easy and tasty.  I read several modifications. 1. Added diced pepper(1) and onion(1) 2. Used 'mexican blend' cheese instead and 3. Cooked chicken, onions and peppers with a low sodium taco mix 4. Removed garlic powder 5. I also remembered a trick from America's test kitchen.  Use corn tortillas (I used small ones as I think they are better.  8"?)  Spray both sides lightly with a vegetable spray and bake in oven for 4 minutes in the same tray you use.  No mess and hardly any additional work.  If you are picky, use a baking sheet or foil. 6. When spraying, open the dishwasher and spray your tortillas above it.  Anything that goes over will be cleaned in the next wash.  :)

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I would suggest choosing the low sodium options when available, we found it salty.  Then again we did probably double the cheese.

I did make a few changes, I used corn tortillas and layered them in a pan using the ingredients just to save time. I also used a rotisserie chicken that I bought at the grocery store rather than cooking my own. I also added canned tomatoes with chilies. It turned out great, will use again. Quick and yummy!!

This wasn't bad. I used a rotisserie chicken that I shredded and cream of chicken and mushroom soup because that's all I could find. I also used a cheddar/jack cheese blend. I thought it tasted a little off although my husband really liked it. I would make it again but I would make a few changes. I think I would use fresh roasted garlic instead of garlic powder. I would also decrease the green onions;  I thought 1/2 cup was way too much, and I like green onions. I also think a can of Rotel instead of the green chilies may be good.

This is great and easy recipe that easily appeals to crowds! I struggled with whether or not to make this becuase everyone was making so many additions and changes but I gave it a whirl anyway. I prepared this recipe AS IS, using fat free sour cream, and it is so delicious! It didnt say how to prepare the chicken so I grilled mine wiht a little garlic salt and pepper, then cubed. Definitely a keeper! Will try this with corn toritallas next time it was so good!

I just made this for the second time and with a few extra spices I'm giving it 5 stars!  All I did was add a 1/4 tsp of chipotle chile powder and a 1/2 tsp of cumin to the chicken mixture.  then I sprinkled some chili powder on top of the cheese - the first time I made is as the recipe is listed, my husband thought it was ok....this time he went back for seconds (that means he really liked it!)!!

We loved these. My son was upset that there were no leftovers the next day when he got home from school.  I followed the recipe except that we used a mexican cheese blend.  These were fairly quick to make probably because I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. Going to try making the filling the night before so things can be even quicker on a busy weekday.

Very bland if you ask me. I'm not sure why these are called Enchiladas as they taste nothing of them. Didn't make enough sauce - I wound up using 2 cups of chicken along with doubling the sauce to have enough. I wish I hadn't as it was lacking in taste a lot. Only saving grace was putting salsa on top of it. Sorry!

the recipe was okay, nothing amazing tho - it needs some more spice, more flavor, and was a bit too creamy for my taste, but like I said, wasn't bad

This is good and fairly easy to make. But, I would consider the quality for pot luck, or "home" food. I can not say it is 5 stars. I think it was okay.

Made it just as directed. My advice would be to double the sauce, add 1/2 to the chicken and 1/2 to cover the enchiladas. That would give it the perfect flavor. Otherwise these are a little dry and bland.

These enchiladas were too soggy for my taste.  Definetly would use corn tortillas instead of flour.  I don't thing I was a fan of all the "sauce" in it.

Definitely 4 stars as is.  Nice way to use up left over chicken.  Next time I would add some taco seasoning for additional flavor.

Very good basic recipe. I made the recipe as is for lunch and thought that it was missing something. So I made it for dinner for my family and add some chili powder, red and green peppers, seasoning salt, pepper and more garlic powder and it was much more flavourful. I will make again.

This is really good.  I added a packet of taco seasoning and some jalepenos because we like that Mexican taste.  Wonderful!  Even my son and husband commented on how good it was.

This recipe is awesome!  I didn't use roasted chicken from the deli, because they were out.  I seasoned and boiled some frozen chicken breast tenderloins and added about 3/4 cup of diced onion.  I then shredded the chicken.  I also mixed about a cup of chunky spicy salsa to the reserve sauce that I topped the enchiladas with.  My husband LOVED this dish and raved about how good it was.  This is definitely a keeper... Thanks Steph!

This is a regular.  I use an rotisserie chicken and add Rotel with green chilies for the color. I double the sauce as well.  Kids love the sauce... still can't get it past the 5 year old, but hardely anything gets past her.

I have been making this recipe for years and everytime I make it more compliments roll in.  It is easy and delicious.  Great for leftovers.  There are only 2 things that I sometimes change.  I grill the chicken instead of boil and I find it gives it a great flavor.  I also substitute cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom if I only have 1 or the other or if someone combing to dinner does not like mushrooms.  It is awesome either way.

I was lazy so I used chicken out of a can. I reserved the chicken juice for "Spanish Rice II". For the sauce I added 1/4 cup more sour cream for personal taste. Also, I did a mixture of 1 1/2 cups of Mild Cheddar Cheese, 1/4 cup Mammoth Cheddar, and 1/4 cup Wildflowe Cheddar. Pretty darn tasty!

Wow!  This recipe was excellent!  I had put off trying the recipe because I was skeptical, but I have to say it was delicious and will be a regular dish in my house.  My boyfriend hates to eat chicken, but he gobbled this up!  I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, and added a few tomatoes and mushrooms just because I was looking to get rid of them.  I didn't have the green chiles, but I had jalepenos so I added a few of those, which gave it a nice kick.  I also used some adobo seasoning.  Next time I am definitely going to add some black beans.   Loved this dish!!!

Just to respond to the last reviewer:  This is NOT an authentic Mexican enchilada recipe.  This is an *American-ized* version of a Mexican dish, therefore flour tortillas are perfectly acceptable.  In fact, ALL white chicken enchilada recipes use white cream sauces and flour tortillas...it's not meant to be "authentic."  Authentic recipes use corn tortillas and red or green sauces.  BTW, this is a great recipe!  Wonderful base to add other ingredients too as well!

These are simple and pretty tasty (although naughty). Only gripe i have is that I follow the recipe exactly save for using 6 inch tortillas instead of 12, and I only get about 4 "enchiladas" tops.

This recipe tastes amazing and is so easy to make! I only did slight alterations to it. Instead of 6 tortillas I only used 4. I cubed the meat of two chicken leg quarters and browned them in the skilled together with the onions to reduce the baking time. Also I mixed a hand full of grated cheese into the remaining sauce mixture.

Great recipe!  I have a tomato allergy so I'm always on the lookout for good recipes sans tomatoes (they're harder to find than you think, since lots of products have a tomato paste base), and this is a good one for enchiladas.  Even my picky 2 year old liked them!

My boyfriend and I really liked this dish! I made a few changes though like a few others.  I used can of mushroom and chicken soup and half a can of chicken soup. I also used a drained can of rotel, 1/4 tsp of chili powder. Instead of using shredded cheddar, I used a mexican mixed cheese.

Great recipe - didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I made up my own version using 3 T butter and 3 T flour mixed with about 1 & 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 C of chicken broth.  If you want extra chicken flavor/salt, add bouillon.  My 5 and 4 yr old loved it.

My hubby and I love this dish! The only thing I do different is I make taco seasoning(BILL ECHOLS from this site) and add it to the sauce. Also, use a smaller baking dish with about 5 tortillas. Great recipe!

I really liked these a lot!  I pretty much followed the recipe the first time.  Next time I will add more seasoning and jalepenos or something to add spice.  I agree that enchiladas are made with corn tortillas, but I would just ignore the name and stick with the flour tortillas because it works.  I would also make more filling (add more chicken or maybe beans).  I was only able to fill 4 12-inch tortillas.

This was a nice change from traditional enchiladas with red sauce, though I will admit that those are my favorite.  When I grow tired of the same recipes a few times in a row, it's nice to throw in something a little different like this.

Made this with no changes to the recipe. We thought these could be a little more Mexican tasting, but they were still good.  I added more chicken and Mexican seasoning to half of them and we liked them better like that.

I took the advice from others and used corn tortillas instead of flour. I am pretty sure I used more cheese than called for but I LOVE cheese. These came out wonderfully. I will be making these again.

I just made this recipe tonight for dinner. It was GREAT! I used a can of cream of chicken as well as a half can of cream of mushroom. It kept the enchiladas very moist. I also boiled my chicken breasts in water and taco seasoning mix before shredding it. I added some of the taco seasoning/water mixture to my enchilada creme sauce to add some more flavor. I also added a whole large white onion and softened them when I cooked 1/2 the amount of green onions. (i hope that makes sense haha) Over all this was an instant hit and will be seen on our dinner table again and again.

These were AMAZING. I followed the recipe almost exactly. Some reviews suggested that the flour tortillas wouldnt hold up well, mine were great. I also found that the amount of sauce was perfect, not runny at all. I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom, added extra cheese, and threw in some jalopenos. My Husband said they were the best he has ever had!

I accidently added a can of diced jalapenos instead of the diced green chiles. Oops. I pulled about half out but just went with it. I, of course, also double the sauce, PERFECT, and the half can of jalapenos made it the right amount of spice for my guests and family. LOVED this and will for sure use it again. Also, doubling the amt of cheese made it especially cheesy and de-lish!

I completely changed this recipe. I changed the flour tortillas for corn. I also used about 3 cups of cheese instead of the 1. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom and chicken. With the extra sauce I added a can of the enchilada sauce that you can buy at the store. I also only used about 1 1/2 cups of milk. This turned out very well, with plenty of leftovers!

This is a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas.  I do have a hint to share, that I discovered out of desperation when I had everything all mixed and found there were no tortillas in the house.  Rather than wrapping the filling in corn or flour tortillas, put in a hard taco shell.  Line the shells in your pan, fitting in as many as you wish.  Even if they stand straight up, that's fine.  Cover the entire top with the sauce, making sure that all of the crunchy shells have topping on them.  In the course of baking they will soften perfectly, and are much easier to fill that regular corn tortillas.  We vary the recipe by using whatever meat on hand, and substituting cream of chicken for cream of mushroom.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first time ever making enchiladas at home.  I used corn tortillas in place of flour, used a store-bought rotisserie chicken in the filling, and replaced the milk with a can of the green enchilada sauce.  It came out absolutely fabulous!  I made it twice within the first week.

These were very tasty.  I followed the directions exactly as printed and they turned out great.  Once I pulled them out of the oven, I added black olives, sour cream and chunky salsa and then served them.  They were a huge hit!

I have made this several times.  I have changed the chicken, sometimes I use shredded chicken.  I have changed the cheese, sometimes I use Mexican fiesta cheeses.  Any which way it is always a great recipe.

These are awesome, especially if you love cheese as much as I do.  I didn't have any green onion so I used white, and I used bigger tortillas.  These also reheat really well.  I will make these again and again! Thanks!

Pretty good! My kids wanted seconds and my husband actually liked it. I really wouldn't call it enchiladas, though. Maybe a casserole?

My husband, 2-yr old, and I really enjoyed these.  I couldn't get my 6-yr old to take a bite, but that's not the recipes fault.  I did sub cream of chicken soup because that was what I had on hand and I added some cumin and chili powder. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was great.  I served it with Mexican rice II from this site.

Very Good. My family loved this. Since we love tomatoes and salsa I substituted the plain green chiles for a can of diced tomatoes w/ green chiles; I also added diced onions, and topped off the finished product w/ salsa and sour cream. A winning recipe indeed!

I like the idea.  I wanted the dish to be awesome.  It fell a little short.  I'm definitely going to try again because I really, really want this to be something that I can make often.  It was really rather bland.  That's what I'll have to oomph up the next time.  I love the reviews and I get many ideas from the reviews, but on this one, I doubled the sauce like some reviews mentioned and I think that was a mistake.  Next time, I won't double the sauce and I will definitely add more to the chicken mixture and probably the sauce, as well.  This has GREAT potential.  It just needs a little work!

This dish was amazing!  My Mom use to make these when I was growing up but she used corn tortillas.  I love it both ways but when you use corn tortillas it tends to get a little soggy.  Thanks again for the great recipe!

I loved this recipe!  I made it for a big family gathering & everybody loved it.  I too made a few changes but nothing too major.  I also doubled the sauce & added a bit more chicken then called for.  I also added more green chiles & some store bought green enchilada sauce just to beef it up a little quantity wise.  It was wonderful & very easy!

Awesome recipe!  My entire family liked it. I did add about a cup of cheese to the topping - it was a little too skimpy with only 1/2 cup on top.

My husband loved it, my daughter wouldn't touch it. I didnt think the cheddar cheese was all that great, so I used montery jack. I also used corn tortillas instead of the flour. I am rating 3 stars on account of the things I had to change. Otherwise, it's a good base recipe.

I've made this recipe over and over and I absolutely love it. I usually wish that it made more of the sauce, but that's only because I always want extra. It makes just enough, actually.

Use cream of chicken instead; and a can of green enchilada sauce; no milk; some fresh cilantro.  Good with either the flour tortillas as written OR white corn.  We like a cheddar/jack blend -- heavier on the jack in this.  Very rich; very good.

These are very yummy, but very rich. We can only have these once in a long while and can't really eat leftovers, because it feels so heavy. But it IS tasty!

It is great, but I do modify it. I use condensed cheese soup instead of the mushroom, probably do about 1 and 1/2 the cheese, and sometimes throw in some jalepenos...then it's my husband's favorite recipe.

This recipe was excellent! There is no other way to describe it! I didn't make any changes but I added salsa under the topping. I also used corn tortillas. These enchiladas were so good they did not last. I can't wait to make these again!

Very good recipe. I've made it several times and it works out great each time. The real key here is the enchilada sauce. For me the canned variety in HOT works fine, but the Quick Enchilada Sauce on this website makes it even better. I use the packaged Mexican Cheese from Kraft and I like it !!!

I've made this recipe twice in the last 3 days (once two days ago as a test, then again tonight for 15 people). Both times, the only substitutions I made were: 1) corn tortillas instead of flour; 2) Jalepeno Tabasco sauce instead of chiles. They turned out DELICIOUS. I did half with chicken and half with just cheese. My guests loved them. A fantastic no-tomato Enchilada recipe.

Excellent!  My children are young and spicy food is too much for them so I left out the chiles, but it is such a good recipe that it was still flavorful and tasty.  I can't wait until they are able to eat a little more spicier food so I can try this one as the recipe states (I love spicy!)

I had to rate this a 4* as I made an error. I used fresh garlic instead of powdered, and because I was running between my computer and my kitchen, I misread the cheese amount and added 1 1/2 cups of TexMex cheese (not divided) to the chicken.  So, these were good, VERY cheesy, and my company loved them.  I would like to try these again, but maybe use the correct amount of cheese next time!

I would give four stars for the taste, but I remove one more star because  there was not enough filling with 1 1/2 cup chicken for 6 tortillas and therefore get six servings. I am surprised to see that very few reviews mention this.

These were delicious.  Everyone in the family was pleased.  Since I was making a bigger portion I used a can each of CO Mush and CO Chix.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes with chilies (along with the 4 oz can of chilies).  To save time I boiled my chicken breasts earlier in the day and diced them up just before making supper.  I served these along with Mexican Rice II from this site and some heated chili beans.  Thank you for an excellent, affordable meal!  :-)

This was good...but a bit salty for some reason.  The only thing I can think of that would have made it too salty is the cream of mushroom soup...I think I'll try cream cheese next time instead.

This was AMAZING!! I did make the enchiladas the REAL way (light frying corn tortillas - accept no substitutes!), but I kept just about everything else the same. My husband asked if he could rate this a 6! And it was pretty easy to make too. I'll definitely be making these again!

As long as you go into this knowing that it won't be like Mexican food, you won't be disappointed. My fiancee raved over these and guess what, he's not too crazy about Mexican food. I used corn tortillas and a larger can of diced green chilies which made it a bit spicey, but my picky girls still ate it.

Very good. I added some black beans for texture and to up the nutrition. I'll make this again, though I may add a little more cheese next time.

Very good, I used green enchilada sauce to cover the enchiladas instead of more sauce. Next time, I think I will use a cheese blend instead of straight cheddar.

My boyfriend is the pickiest person on the planet. I couldn't mix the peppers or chives in with everything.

Other that that, I followed the reciped pretty close. I sauted the chicken with some taco seasoning.  i also added chille powder and oregano to the sauce.
I also spread some refried beans on the tortillas before I filled them.

Since I do like pretty much everything, I sauted some onion, black olives and peppers in some butter and sprikled them on top of my enchilladas.

My boyfriend was happy, and I was happy.
I got my yucky vegtables, and he got his meat and cheese. 

This will definately be added to the small list of recipes we can both enjoy!
Thank you!

Oooh so good!  My little picky eaters loved it.  I am making this again tonite, but will double up on the sauce and chicken and instead of stuffing the burritos, layer it kind of like a Enchilada lasagna.  When I raved about this recipe with friends, I was told to try it this way too.  Enjoy!

These were awesome!!! I baked them in an 8x8 pan so I only need one can of sauce (which covered the enchiladas completely). I also shredded rotissiere chicken which added a lot of flavor, everyone loved it!

I made these last night and both my boyfriend and I loved them.  I did double the sauce recipe and used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can mushroom - I think this was a little too much sauce, but I think just 1 can would be too little.  I used regular onion because the store was out of green - tasted great.  And I added a little taco seasoning to the sauce which was really good.  For the chicken, I just shredded one whole rotisserie chicken.  I also used corn tortillas.  They came out great, although a little messy getting them out of the pan - I don't think I let them sit long enough after coming out of the oven.  I'm giving this 5 stars because it was a cheaper, healthier way to make our favorite dish Enchilada Suizas from "On the Border"!!

We had some guests over when I made this, it was awesome and I had to give them the recipe. The only thing I changed was I used cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of mushroom. We also put a spoonful of sourcream on top. Thank you for this recipe!

I have made this twice The first time I followed the recipe exactly. This time I changed it using other reviewers suggestions. I doubled the recipe using 1 can of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken soup. I used a cooked rotisserie chicken from the store to save time. And I added a can of rotel and mexican shredded cheese. It was so good! My husband loved it. Even my picky 4 year old said " Mommy this is so good" Definetly a keeper!

I make this often - I use the Pepperjack Cheese soup (2 cans) and combine it with about 1 cup of sour cream.  I put a little of this into the chicken mixture and some cheese into the tortillas before rolling.  Pour the rest of the sauce over and put cheese on top.  The spicy soup makes the difference!

This was great, rich, but great.  I made in the afternoon and refrigerated until that evening for dinner.  I used three diced chicken breasts and ended up being able to make 5 enchiladas total, which was way more than enough for hubby and I,  they were very filling.  I made rice and corn for sides.

Great alternative to red sauce enchiladas, i used corn tortillas, just a personal preference, but i will make again. Probably use cream of chicken instead, i normally make a casserole from this site, but this will be nice to switch it up here and there.

great! i would recommend following the recipe exactly. i deviated somewhat based on some of the reviews(i added cream of chicken soup) and i thought it would have been better without it. also i forgot to spray the pan and some of the tortillas stuck. 

i will definitely make this again and this time i'll leave it alone.

This was pretty good, but not fantastic. I took reviewers advice and doubled the sauce and cheese, but it really was too thick and creamy for my husband and I. I also sauted the (white) onions and chicken in taco seasoning, which I really liked. It only made 5 enchiladas, but they were big enough, esp. since it's just my husband and I. I'll make this again, but I'll probably do less sauce and more chicken, and try to make it less rich and creamy. Oh, and I'll probably add more green peppers next time too.

WOW! I used beef, leftover from tacos... and used one crm of mush soup, with one can of beef broth added 2 TBSP butter to sautee the green onions, and 3 TBSP flour. Made a roux and the sauce was AWESOME! Next time I will use 7 oz of green chilis. I used white american and cheddar cheese. Made rice cooker mexican rice. This was an easy meal and wonderful - kids ate it up! Sprinkled cliantro over all!

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  Don't listen to the haters that didn't like it.  I made these last night because I had some chicken I needed to use up.  The only thing I changed up was that I used 1/2 can cream of chicken soup and 1/2 can of Nacho Cheese soup.  Other than that, it was the same recipe.  I think next time I'll add a little chili powder and maybe some cumin.  However, it's great the way it is!  My husband and son loved this...they ate later than I did so when I came into the kitchen this morning, all that was left was the dirty pan..they ate all of the rest of it!

Yummmm!  This is such an easy, no-fail recipe that tastes delicious!  I bought burrito-sized tortillas and ended up only getting 5 enchiladas out of my chicken/sauce mixture and the enchiladas barely fit in the baking dish, but that was fine with me!  Next time, I will buy smaller tortillas so they fit better in the dish and so we have more leftovers.  My husband thought they tasted even better when reheated in the microwave the next day!

Wow, my super-picky 6 year old even liked these, despite the "green things" in it!  I did add cumin, garlic, pepper, and a dash of chili powder to the sauce, and they were EXCELLENT! Great recipe, thanks!!

Very very good! Alter it a bit here and there. Added some mexican seasoning, minched garlic, garlic powder, cumin powder and cilantro to the white "sauce". Sprinkle more cilantro on top of the cheese. Next time need to double it, since the BF eat them faster than I make them :) Serve with Spanish rice and homemade Guac. Thank you for the recipe!!

I served these for a Mexican themed potluck I was having and everyone loved them. I on the other hand felt it was missing something. I did however use cream of chicken instead of mushroom as others suggested. But it was well received by by guests so it did the trick.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I think it should be much better given the ratings other people have given it.  It should be practically perfect as written and it needs a lot of work.  You do not need 6 12-inch tortillas; I used 5 10-inch tortillas and there wasn't enough filling, as the recipe stands for that - I had to add a can of black beans to increase the filling amount.  The sauce and filling had a taste reminiscent of the condensed soup used which I found unappealing.  I would have rather spent extra time to make a white sauce first.  If you could get over the soup taste, there wasn't much more to taste; very bland.  I used olive oil instead of butter and other than my can of black beans I kept to the recipe.  I'm sure there are better recipes for enchiladas, please try to find one instead of making this.

Thought these were really yummy, but didn't feel like they had quite enough chicken, and only filled 5 tortillas instead of 6.  Would use at least 2 cups of chicken next time (or maybe more).

I've made this recipe several times and it always turns out great. I've brought it to work functions and made it for home parties and it is always praised. To save time, I buy rotisserre chickens and pull the meat off for the enchiladas. This gives them a good blend of light and dark meat.

This is a regular meal for my husband and I.  We love it.  The only thing I change about the recipe is to add more cheese on top.  I cook the chicken in a little oil and season it with garlic salt and pepper- the flavor is great with the sauce.

Pretty good. I liked the cheesiness. Thought it could use a little more flavour- garlic, onion, etc. I also think the 10" tortillas were too big in proportion to the filling. Next time I will play with the spices and use smaller tortillas.

OMG! This was in fact the best chicken enchilada recipe (except for my mom's) but it was only the best because of everyone's suggestion.  I'm sure if I made it exactly like the recipe it would have been BAD.  Thanks to those who offered their 2 cents in making this recipe fantastic.  My boyfriend LOVED it. I will definitely keep this one hand for next time!  Thank you reviewers!

These were SO good and easy to make! Other reviews said corn tortillas are how you make enchiladas and I have to agree to a certain extent. Corn tortillas are hard to work with and I think are better with cheese or beef enchiladas. I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom and also added a little bit of the can green enchilada sauce, another thing i did was cut tiny pieces of chicken to the mixture for the topping it was wonderful! One more thing I added different was cilantro, DELISH

This was great!  I used cream of chicken soup as my family doesn't like mushrooms.  I prefer the flour tortillas even though its not "authentic".  I will make this again!

My family loved this recipe!  Made a few changes:  used a rotisserie chicken and  cream of chicken soup, omitted green onion, and used fresh garlic in place of garlic powder.  I'm planning to try corn tortillas next time instead of the flour ones, which got a bit gummy when I cooked them.  But overall, a delicious and easy recipe.  Definitely one to add to the recipe box!

Oh my gosh these were the best. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I cooked them in the pan with half regular taco seasoning and half hot & spicy taco seasoning. I doubled the sauce and used two cans of cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom. I also used the refridgerated tortilla's that you cook yourself as my tortilla's. These were awesome, this is now one of my family's favorites. Thanks for the great recipe.

My boyfriend and I really liked these. I made them spicier, and added enchilada sauce. I also finished them off with homemade guacamole and homemade salsa (that other people made, not me- I'm not that good!). I also think that next time, I'll double the sauce because it didn't make quite enough sauce for my taste. I think also it's good to use a different cheese rather than cheddar. This recipe is so wonderful though, because you can substitute a lot of the ingredients to suit your taste. Thanks again, we LOVED this!

This was pretty good, but I see why a lot of people called it a base. It definitely needs a little something more. Not necessarily flavor/spice wise, but it needs some weight. I was thinking of adding rice into the enchilada. My other issue was that it definitely needs to be doubled. We only got 3 out of it, using 12" tortillas. Maybe rice will fix that as well?

These were awesome! I used cream of chicken instead of cream of "square rubber" mushroom. My husband loved them.

Wonderful recipe!  Added the taco seasoning to the chicken as other people suggested and put some jalepenos on top before baking.  It was great!

We loved this recipe!! It was a nice change up from the red sauce. I added one can of drained black beans into the chicken mix. It was very easy and very delicious. The days have been hot and wanting to try this for several day....I used my electric fry pan instead of the oven. It worked great. The temperature I set it at was more like 225 - 250, watching it and only for about 20 mins.

Not sure how authentic this is but it tastes amazing so oh well!! I prefer to use ground chicken instead of cubed chicken breast, as it gives a more uniform texture, is easier to roll the enchiladas, and faster to prepare. I think someone else suggested using corn tortillas, which I did and feel it gave it a better taste and were maybe easier to work with. I ended up needing two packages of corn tortillas, as this made a lot of filling. Really really good, and easy.

I'm generally a recipe snob (about stuff like canned chiles and mushroom soup -- you know someone like me) but this recipe is utterly delicious. I served it with saffron rice,fresh corn on the cob and sliced garden tomatoes and the crowd went wild. Definitely making it again...soon.

Pretty good.  I might make a few adjustments of my own that appeal to my taste.  Not a huge fan of cream of mushroom soup or mushrooms at all for that matter.

This is a good basic recipe.  I didn't have any complaints.  I added taco seasoning to my chicken (shredded) like others mentioned and wished I had added more!  It really adds a lot of flavor and gives this recipe a big boost. The flavors go well together so don't worry about that.  Enjoy!

So good! I did as someone suggested, adding taco seasoning to the chicken after I boiled it though. THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE, that's what makes it the BEST! And I add 1 can cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom, oh and I forgot to add the milk but I liked it, it wasn't runny, I think it could have been because I added more soup than called for. All 4 of my guest were raving about how GOOD it was!! Delish! I will make this again and again. Thank you!

We're vegetarians, so I substituted chicken with the "morningstar farms 'chickn' strips" and these were seriously the best enchiladas i've ever made! My 3 year old inhaled his, too. I'll definately be making these on a regular basiss. thanks so much! Oh yes, and I couldn't find "canned chiles", so I just used 1/2 can Rotel. Added a good spice to them.

I made this for company and was pleased to serve it. I left out the green chiles only because I didn't have them but I think they would have been good. This is a very simple and satisfying recipe.

This is awesome!!!!  I've made these several times, and everyone loves them.  All of my family members have asked for the recipe.  The great thing is that ALL the kids love them!!!!  The only thing I do differently is double the recipe with the exception of the green chilis.  It is a little spicy for the kids.  It makes 12 enchiladas and my family of 6 goes crazy when I make them.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I had leftover BBQ chichen that I wanted to use up so I use it in this recipe and it came out very good.  I think the BBQ chicken really added flavor.  I would make this again but next time I might make a few changes.

This was a really great, simple recipe.  It's different than my more complicated one I usually make with many more ingredients.  Campbell's has a very similar recipe.  I added Chili Powder to the onions as well as Southwest Seasoning.  I also added SW Seasoning to the chicken.  I also used REAL minced garlic and added more cheese.  It was great to use up some leftover chicken that I already had cooked.  I 1/2'd it, but I wish I would have made the entire thing b/c it was really yummy :)  Thank you ~ I will make this again!

I really liked these!  My husband REALLY liked them, too. I'm more of a traditional chili sauce, cheese, onion, & pork girl with corn tortillas.  However, these had a satisfying and sinfully creamy texture and taste.

These Enchiladas are so easy to make and were very good.  Like other reviewers, I doubled the sauce by using one can of 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and one can of 98% fat free cream of chicken soup (this also helpd reduce the fat content in them).  They turned out great.  Will certainly make them again.

Great recipe.  I had left over cheese sauce from a Mexican restaurant, so I topped it with that instead of adding the cheddar.  It was really good.  Refried beans on the side made it even better.

This was really yummy.  I switched cream of mushroom for cream of chicken and used a can of diced green chiles since that's what I had in the house already; it came out great!  I'll definitely make this one again.

I loved this dish. It's so hard to get my children to eat any mexican dishes but this one was a real hit with them and my husband!!! I will make this over and over again. I'm actually making it tonight. Thank you.

I love this recipe! So easy and it tastes just as great with lowfat mushroom soup, sour cream and 2%milk. I added a little cumin too. Even better as leftovers!

I followed this recipe as is. I thought it tasted a bit 'cream-of-mushroom soupy'. I think the addition of some garlic and for sure some cumin could help that out. They were good and I will make these again with a few tweaks. Its a nice change from the traditional red sauce! UPDATE: I have made these many times over. I add chili powder and some cumin and garlic powder (and once used a packet of taco seasoning). It adds a lot more flavor and makes these more enjoyable. My husband LOVES these!

A really nice enchilada recipe.  Followed directions exactly and husband raved about how good they were.  Said they were better than anything we've eaten at our favorite Mexican restaurant. Gave it 4 stars because leftovers did not reheat well. The flour tortilla got very soggy.

This is a really great twist to enchiladas!  I'm not a fan of enchilada sauce so this creamy version is ten times better than a red/green sauce. I omitted the green chile's and added olives and mushrooms. Very good!!!

This turned out pretty good, but would have been better if I had not added sour cream and salsa to the sauce. It was really too sweet and I will add more cayenne next time.  As mentioned by another reviewer, I added cilantro, lime, pepper, salt, and chili powder, along with a liberal dash of fajita seasoning into the creamy chicken mixture. I would also spray the baking dish with PAM since the flour tortillas stuck to the bottom. The extra sauce was really yummy with rice! This is a keeper, but I'll do it up spicy next time!

This dish was delicious and easy.  I added all of the shredded cheddar cheese with the soup and sour cream mixture, but sprinkled pepper jack cheese on top for extra zing.  It is a wonderful recipe to experiment with and I will definitely add it to my favorite list!

A wonderful recipe for my family. Easy to make and very tasty. Instead of adding milk I added 1/2 cup of Olde Elpaso Enchilada sauce as another suggested. Will definitely be making again.

Followed directions withOUT frying green onions.  As another cook suggested, added cumin and chopped bell pepper, used unfried corn tortillas.  Sauce covered up the cracked tortillas.  Very, very good and quick.  Used leftover crock pot cooked chicken thighs that had been cooked in onion soup mix and tomatoe paste.  I left chicken in bite sized chunks.  Sauce was very good.

I've made this recipe many times, and it's wonderful.

As to a recipe without cream of soup, I can't answer to that, but I do make my own replacement that might work for Miss Snoop.  It is very similar to the Homemade-Cream-Style-Soup-Mix that can be found here.  Mine doesn't include potato flakes, but that's about the only difference.  This is quick to make and you could control the ingredients going in.

This recipe was ok as is,but I found it a little bland for my tastes. Once I added some things it was great! I put some rinsed black beans and corn in the chicken filling,and doubled the chilies. I cooked my chicken breasts in broth with seasonings and cubed them. I also added some of the broth from the chicken and a 1/4 cup more sourcream the remaining sauce for the top. After that it was perfect for our family. A good base recipe for making your own twist to it.

So easy and so good!  I love that it's simple and basic, yet still packed full of flavor!  It also works well with beef (have you ever been in the middle of cooking dinner and realize you are missing something so integral as chicken!?!  It's never a good feeling!  Luckily, beef substituted well!)

Awesome! I doubled the sauce as recommended. I used one cream of mushroom & one cream of chicken to balance the flavors. I accidentally added all of the cheese into the chicken mixture instead of diving it in half, but my husband couldn't tell anything was wrong. I still sprinkled some cheese on top after the baking was done to avoid burning the cheese. Very, very good!

this recipe is very good the flavor of the basic recipe is excellent.  it is a littl emild for my tastes but this is a versatile recipe and you can add a little more kick to it by the way of extra chilis or chili powder.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce and it was just perfect.  i double the recipe and it doesn't last more than 2 days in my house!

EXCELLENT restraunt quality!!!  My family loved these.  I did double the suace, I cook 6 frozen boneless chicken breast in the crockpot on low during the day and I season them with cumin, fresh cilantro, and pepper, a little chicken broth in bottom of crock to keep them moist.  I use cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup one of each and double everything else including the green chilies.  I have made it several times always a big hit. Thank you for the recipe

I really liked these. A bit spicy for my taste, but my husband and his guy friends finished them off in one setting. I made a little extra sauce like most reviewers suggested and they turned out great. I will be making this dish again!

I just made this for lunch.  It turned out really good.  I was surprised.  I don't think I've ever made enchiladas in my life and I did it.  I used more chicken because I have a big family.  I added almost a can of cream of chicken to the sauce also to make it stretch.  I forgot to add the milk at the end but I had enough sauce to cover and it turned out great!

Very good. Liked it best with Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup. And agree that you should maybe double the sauce. I used fresh garlic and sauted it with the chicken and green onion. Also added some green onion into the sauce. My family really liked this dish.

I was only able to fill 5 tortillas, but I'm still giving it five stars because it tasted so good.  I used fat free soup, sour cream, and cheese and it still had a lot of flavor.  I also increased the cheese by 1/2 cup.

These are the best enchiladas ever! I love the creaminess. I also thought that the recipe was pretty quick and easy, which is good. I serve it with Spanish rice. Thanks for a good recipe!

I thought this was very good.  I used 2 Tbsp. butter and some onion flakes b/c I didn't have green onions.  I also used cream of chicken soup b/c I didn't have mushroom.  I used a lot more cheese.  Very good!!  Will definitely make again!  Even my 1 and 2 yr. olds ate it up!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I altered the recipe a bit.  Used red onion since I didn't have green onions, also tossed in a partial can of rotel(with cilantro & lime) I had in the fridge, then used a can of store bought green enchilada sauce and poured on top of the cheese mixture on the enchildas during baking. These were excellent. This was my second time to make these and I think they were better this time with the alterations.

My family wanted to rate this 4 stars.  I would have given it a 3 at the most.  It just didn't have anything special. The taste was mediocre at best.  I love Mexican food and cook it a lot.  I don't think this tasted very authentic at all.  There was not much I liked about it.  My family actually didn't eat very much of it.  I won't make it again.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe as I have never made enchiladas before. I was a little scared by the 2 cans of green chiles in terms of heat, so I used one can of mild enchilada sauce instead. I also used 2 cups of sharp Cheddar. They turned out great, my whole family really enjoyed them. Thanks for the recipe!

It is weird seeing this recipe since my mom has been making them this exact way for over 30 years, its my favorite. except I would change the garlic powder for garlic salt or crushed garlic it will give it more flavor and I think it tastes best with one can cream mushroom with one can cream chicken also with 2 cans it wont be dry.

Pretty good recipe. I always love to throw in a can of dark red kidney beans as well just to add some bulk and flavor. Also, I like to add just a touch of tomato sauce (like prego or some spaghetti sauce) to add a little extra flavor and color.

Love them! The only thing I would add is chopped tomatoes on top to give it a more fresh taste or slices of avocados. Very good. Next time I will double the recipe, I didn't get to many out of them. Thanks for sharing.

OH yeah!! These were so good. I used a 6 oz can of diced jalapenos, and the big tortillas. I would call them chicken burritos. But no matter what you call them, they are definetly delicious!!!

I'm only giving this 4 stars because, even though I love it, the rest of my family thinks it's just ok. I always use cream of chicken soup because we don't like mushrooms. I'm making this again this week and will be trying a lower fat version.

Our family really enjoys this recipe. I have found that they also like it when I add some salsa to the inside of the enchilada along with the chicken mixture. This has become a family favorite.

Not really enchiladas....a creamy chicken sauce in a tortilla, which was tasty...but not much spice to it.  We ended up putting a fresh pico/salsa on top to give it a little more flare.

GREAT! We used half a can of cream of mushroom and half a can of cream of chkn. I added some extra hot sauce and jalapeños because we like it spicy. I added half a can of drained black beans as well as some sliced black olives. Turned out great! And even better the second day!

This is really great! For some reason it only made four and I used an 8 x 8 pan. Good thing it was just the two of us!! I'll definitely make this again!

This was just okay.  It was missing something.  Cumin, cilantro,...something!  If I were to make it again I would play with the recipe instead following the directions.  I add to it.

These are the best Enchiladas ever!  I served them at a birthday party for 17 adults and 13 children.  Everyone loved them.... even the kids!  All the adults said they were the best Chicken Enchiladas they've ever had!

I thought these were very tasty, but my husband and daughter didn't. I used cream of chicken soup cuz' that's what I had on hand, and my husband and daughter don't like mushrooms. I probably won't make it again, but it's a good recipe.

I never have the chiles on hand so left them out.  Used leftover cooked chicken from making stock, a great way to use this up.  A real simple family meal that is a hit with all ages.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good. I added fajita seasoning to the chicken while it was cooking. A little too "mushroomy" for me so next time I'll use half cream of chicken and half mushroom. Will definitely make this again.

This is pretty good. I didn't give it 5 stars just because it's not the best chicken enchiladas that I've ever had but, they are still pretty tasty. I added a can of green chile enchilada sauce and a can of cream of chicken soup to the sauce.Followed the rest of the recipe exact. Not bad enchiladas.

I really liked this recipe. It was easy to make and very tasty. One change I might make next time is to not put  a whole can of cream of mushroom soup in, but maybe mix it half and half with sour cream. They were great leftover for lunch the next day. I tried using 12 inch tortillas but I will try 6 inch next time.

I had to give this a three because the original recipe was good but for my family I would have to change many things before serving it again.  What I mean to say is what the other reviews said, "use as a base and be creative".  For instance, the mushroom soup flavor really dominants so I will use cream of chicken next time.  Also would double the recipe only because we like to have some left over, this only served one enchilada for almost 5 (had to skimp a little on one of the last tortilla fillings).  If made with rice on the side one enchilada should be sufficient per person.  Next time I will try adding black beans, fresh garlic, maybe a corn salsa.  I guess the skys the limit, again use as a base and be creative to your own tastes.

My family LOVED these. Even my 2 year old cleaned her plate! I would have doubled the sauce per reviews but I only had one can of soup. I added some salsa and taco seasoning and I thought the amount of sauce was just right. Delicious heated up the next day too. I'm sure this will find its way to our dinner table again soon.

Great base recipe. Really easy. We enjoy spicier food so I added red and green pepper. I also used and Old El Paso Chicken Enchalida soup once and was also very tasty. Double the recipe, barely feeds a family of four!!

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. I really didn't care for it, and found it quite bland, but my family absolutely loved it -- they gave it five stars.  Tomato-based enchiladas are much more to my taste. However, these reminded me of the white chicken enchiladas they used to serve at Luby's Cafeteria (I never liked those either, but my hubby loved them, go figure).  They were really easy to make. I didn't have any canned peppers -- maybe it would be better with them, if I make these again. I might leave out the cream soup next time and opt for more sour cream and cheese. Thanks so much for this crowd-pleasing recipe.

Great recipe.  Easy to make and delicious flavor.  If you're looking for a cream sauce enchilada recipe, this is it!  The green chilis are very mild and this dish isn't spicy at all.

I really like these. I add a bit of cholula hot sauce to the sauce mixture to give it a bit more of a kick to the taste. It also adds a bit of color to the otherwise boring looking sauce.

My whole family loves these and the only changes I make are omitting the onions, using fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and using chopped jalepenos instead of the green chiles. I served these one night to a friend who does not like spicy food and he loved them so much he had his wife call me for the recipe. Great tasting and easy.

These were WONDERFUL!  Hub couldn't say enough about them.  The only change I made from reading the reviews was that since we like a lot of flavor, I added 1/2 t. cayenne pepper and 1/2 t. cumin to the sauce before dividing it.  No more/no less for our tastes.  I did only make 3 enchiladas.  As others suggested, to make 6, double the filling.  This is one of those forever keepers.  These are better than any restaurant we've gone to and we've been to some truly fantastic ones ($$$).  Thanks so much!

Was missing something, spice, my kids loved it though. The grown up's would have liked to have some more spice to it. Will make it again and add some stuff.

I've made this recipe several times now and it always turns out great!  I double the sauce and use taco seasoning when cooking my chicken for extra flavor.  My dad said that it reminded him of something he used to eat in New Mexico.  This recipe is a keeper!

I was looking for something other than a red-sauced enchilada recipe. These are great! In the future, I will double the filling. I served this with Spanish rice and a mexicali salad. This is a new family favorite!

I decided to try these because I had everything on hand and they looked easy. OMG, my picky 7 year old said this was her new favorite dish, which is huge for me! My husband said this recipe was a definite keeper and my 4 year old even ate them. I made these with corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas and will make them that way again, most likely. I used only half of the green chilis that the recipe called for and used garlic salt instead of garlic powder. They had just the right seasoning and flavor, I thought. I added chicken to the sauce that goes on top because I had some extra and it made these a little heartier that way. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful!  I added a layer of stove top made spanish rice which added a twist to the flavor. Also, I shredded my chicken after boiling it.  Will add this to my favorites  : )

One of my all time favorite recipes.  I handed this recipe out at work, and everyone agrees.  The only change/addition I make is to add black olives and a cup of salsa.  I'd make this every week!

This was wonderful!!  I did change a few things, however. I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of celery - it's what I had on hand. I added a 16oz container of sour cream with peppers, onions, garlic, and green chilis. This was excellent. Easily adaptable to your families tastes. Thanks for sharing!

Good recipe, both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. It wasn't the traditional enchilada I was used to, but who cares? The sauce could have used a bit more flavor.. not sure what to add though. Overall, a good enchilada to serve with some Mexican rice! Thanks!

Good! I would recommend not using the whole can of soup - anywhere from 1/2 to 2/3 works good. With the whole can, it seemed to have too much of a soupy flavor. I like my food spicier, so I would also add cumin and chili powder.

Great!! My kids love this (which is saying a lot); My husband told me I could make this again, which means he loves it. The only change I made was using cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom, just didn't like the idea of mushrooms in my enchiladas!  I will definatley make this again.

Great recipe for our family. I have to double it next time. We thought it needed more kick. Maybe adding more green chiles, onions, or garlic powder would do the trick. We will definitely mess with the ingredients to make it more to our liking. Overall, above average recipe that we will make again.

This is a quick, easy, basic recipe.  It whipped up FAST and the only changes I made was chopped white onion in place of the green onions (I didn't have any green onions,) and I used turkey instead of chicken (I have a ton of turkey leftover from Thanksgiving!)  While this was a nice, quick recipe, I am going to keep looking for the "perfect" chicken enchilada recipe, because I would like something with a little more spice, but my husband, who likes things on the mild side, said I could definitely make these again.

Awesome recipe!  Made it exactly as instructed.  Didn't have enough filling for 6 tortilla shells, though.  Next time, I'll shred the chicken and double the sauce.  Definitely give this tasty recipe a try!

This was very good, however, I felt the ingredient amounts were way off. The only things I didn't double were the can of soup and tortilla wraps. 1 1/2 cups of chicken for 6 wraps was definitely not enough. Also, next time I think I would add some red peppers with the onion and use fresh garlic. Maybe a bit of cumin too. Everyone loved it!

I didnt find this to be very good at all. It was creamy and bland and heavy.  I did smother it in hot sauce and that seemed to make it a little better but it really wasnt good for an enchilada.  I think its name is misleading.

Just Okay.  Won't make again.  I would use regular onion instead of green onion.  Just use green onion as a garnish.  I like the Betty Crocker Version of this recipe better.

I love this recipe, mainly because I love the green chiles.  I usually double the recipe and it's so exciting to have it for lunch the next day.

These were very good.  I substituted half pepperjack cheese for the Cheddar since I had some to use up.  It gave it a little extra kick which was very tasty.  The only thing I found was that it did not make enough filling for 6 large tortillas.  I was only able to fill 3. The next time I will make this using smaller tortillas.

Very good. I had some Southwest chicken strips and used cream of chicken soup since my kids don't like mushrooms. I did take the advice of others and increased the sour cream. Will definitely make again!

I can honestly say these were the best enchiladas I have ever had, they even beat some of the best Mexican restaurants.  It was very easy to make and a lot of fun to eat.  When cooking the chicken I did cut them into cubes and cooked them in taco seasoning.  It was yummy.

I finally decided to make this. I didn't think this was the best thing I've ever tasted but everyone else did.  I should have made more. Unfortunately loaded with calories, it's hard to eat just one. After everybody was done eating they asked when we were having them again. I followed exact but next time will make more.

My family really likes this dish. But we like it really creamy so we double the mixture for the same amount of tortillas the recipe calls for. it is so much better that way.

This is delicious.  I had a large portin of leftover turkey.  I made this recipe.  I and my family just loved it.  In fact two weeks later, I purchased a turkey breast just to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe!  I don't care for tomatoes, chiles, or onions, but I did decide to add half a can of Mexican style Rotel (drained).  I only added this because I thought my husband would think there wasn't enough flavor to it.  I plan on making this recipe all the time.  Thank you for a great meal!

This is okay. Of course I tweaked the recipe a little. I used 1 cup of sour cream and 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom. I added about 1 1/2 cups of prepared rice to the enchiladas because I really like rice. I didnt have any green onions on hand, so I replaced it with onions and green peppers. I also added some hot sauce to the sauce mixture and chopped jalepenos to the top. Also I added an envelope of taco seasoning to the soup/sour cream mixture instead of the chili powder (what ever the spice was). Not too bad, probably will make again.

The sauce makes this meal!!!!  My husband loved it.
I used white onion instead of green onions due to preference and based on the recommendations of others used fajita seasoning for the chicken.  I thought the fajita seasoning was a bit strong, so next time I would not use the whole package.

Very good recipe.  I like the change from the usual tomato based sauce.  I used fat free cream of mushroom, light sour cream, and reduced fat cheese and they still tasted great.

This recipe came out well for me.  I may have overfilled my enchiladas a bit - the filling only made 5 for me. I followed the recipe exactly.  I think perhaps it could have used a bit more flavor as other reviews mentioned. I would have liked to add some jalapenos for some heat.  Very rich and creamy, but I almost missed the milk in the recipe (it seemed easily missable) and I think the milk (which I didn't measure) made the sauce for the topping just right.  I will make this again on a night when I have left over chicken (I used 4 half breasts and grilled them) just to make it a little quicker to assemble.

Delicious!  My whole family loved it.  I used some leftover shredded chicken that I had and simmered it in chicken broth and fajita seasoning for about 10 minutes or so.  I followed the advice below about doubling the sauce, but I found that I had a lot left over.  But I would rather have too much than too little.  I will definitely be making this again!

I've been making a recipe similar to this one for years now.  It is a hit at every potluck, however, instead of using cream of mushroom, use cream of chicken, and about 1 cup more mexican blend cheese.  It is wonderful served with avacado and sliced black olives as  a  garnish!!!!

Ooooooh, this was soooooo good, I made it with spanish rice.  My husband and I loved it, the kids thought it was ok a little too much zip for them from the green chilis.  Oh well, they can have the rice and a hot dog next time, hubby and I will eat the enchiladas, they are yummy.

Soooo good. The only change I make is to use Campbell's Creamy Chicken Verde soup instead of Cream of Mushroom. It gives it the BEST flavor. I like to serve with black beans and pico de gallo.

My husband loves these and says they are better than any restaurant enchilada he's had. Not too shabby!

This recipe is awesome!  I followed parts of the original and modified it according to what others suggested. Adding the chicken taco seasoning to the meat after it is cubed makes ALL the difference. My office said they could have eaten the chicken just by itself! I also used regular onion instead of green onion because it is what I had on hand. The flavor was fine.  The only other thing I did differently is used fiesta blend cheese and instead of chilis, I used salsa verde. Using the can of salsa verde made this dish even more delicious. If you add more salsa verde, it will be spicier. Great recipe!!!!!

Very good!  We did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and added a packet of taco seasoning to the chicken.  To be honest, I almost wish I had kept to the original recipe.  The taco seasoning did add to the flavor, but almost too much.  I think next time that I will limit it to half a packet of seasoning.  Still, the recipe is very good overall.

Awesome! I didn't have garlic powder, so I used fresh garlic.   This dish doesn't taste too Tex Mex - it's got a more subtle flavor.  I would love to try it with crepes instead of tostitos.

this is a good basic recipe, but lacking a little in the flavor department...I made the following changes and that brought it up to a five -1 can of green chiles and one can of sliced jalepenos chopped up + about half the water that they are packed in
-1c. sour cream - a little less than double the cheese -1tsp chile powder -added a little more milk to the reserved sauce

Very yummy and easy.  I cook up chicken breasts periodically in the crock pot, shred, and freeze in vaccum bags, so this is a great recipe to use with that.  I substituted 1/2 an onion, 1 can verde enchilada sauce, and crm of chicken soup.  I also added 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning to the chicken.  Even my picky 6-yr-old wanted leftovers the next day.

cooked it up and served it to 2 14 yr olds - they AND I - loved it. Bought 12" tortillas - only good for 4 servings not 6. Barely could fit in my largest casserole. Make sure you liberally grease it as they tend to cook onto the casserole surface. I served it up with mexican rice with canned corn nibelets mixed in. 
FANTASTIC dish - highly recommended!

This is a very good recipe.  I made these as instructed and they are easy and foolproof.  However, my family prefers the corn tortilla and beef variety.  They would be a good addition to a mexican buffet where you had a little of everything.  I will say this, it makes about 6 giant enchiladas.

This recipe is fantastic! I don't like tomatos and so most enchilada recipes are immediately out in my book. But this one was incredible and quests liked better than their more familiar enchiladas!! I get requests for it all the time! On top of all that, it is super easy to make!

These were awesome!  I doubled the sauce - which is AMAZING - & used a little more chicken (I just used the pre-cooked chicken fajita meat from the refeigerated section to save time) than the recipe called for.. We still only got 5 enchiladas out of it, but they are really filling!!  I can't wait to make this again, and might even try corn tortillas next time..

This was fantastic.  My friends inhaled it.  I used only about a third of the chiles, substituted cream of chicken for the mushroom and I increased the amount of the sauce.  We loved it!  Will make again and again.

Very tasty!  I made quite a few substitutions, as I did not have certain things on hand or family preferences were taken into consideration.  Also didn't do exact measurements; never do!  I sauted a green bell pepper with 3/4 of a red one 1/2 of a large onion (all sliced), and a couple cloves of fresh garlic (roasted it in olive oil vs butter before adding veggies).  Didn't use green onion or garlic powder or green chiles.  Also used cream of chicken, not mushroom.  Didn't use milk & forgot to reserve sauce before adding chicken & (unmeasured) cheddar.  Served with fresh lettuce & tomato atop!  Turned out great!  Ate as leftovers for a couple days... Enjoy!

We loved this recipe.  It was as good as I had hoped and then some.  I followed it exactly and it only filled a 9x9 pan with 4 enchiladas, which was fine for us.  When I cooked the chicken, I did so on the George Foreman grill after sprinkling Garlic and onion powder and a bit of cayene pepper on each side.  It was great... I will add some rice to the bottom next time.  Thanks!

This was a hit, especially with the young children.  I increased the amount of chicken and doubled the sauce.  Wonderful! It even tasted good reheated the next day.

I was not that impressed with this recipe.  I thought the sauce was very heavy and filling.  I shredded my chicken and simmered it in taco seasoning, which gave more flavor.  I can't put my finger on it, but I personally just did not like this version - I guess I just prefer lighter sauces. My boyfriend did enjoy this, though.  On a positive note, it was very easy to prepare.

Easy, good, fast to prepare.  Added a few things to tweak this like a bit of oregano and garlic cloves some jalapeno salt and a few fresh mushrooms sauteed with the green onion.

I love this recipe.  I add a little chicken fajita seasoning to the chicken before micing into the sauce.  This is one way I can get my husband to eat Mexican food.  Will use this recipe often

Better than most restaurants. I used the meat from a rotisserie chicken I bought from the grocery store and roughly chopped. I also used flour tortillas.  It was awesome.

These were really yummy, but very, very rich.  When I opened my package of tortillas, I realized they were all cracked in half.  So, I doubled the sauce, used the dish like a lasagna.  I layered 6 tortillas on the bottom, then half the sauce/chicken mixture, 6 more tortillas and the remaining mixture.  Sprinkled the top with cheese and baked for 25 minutes.  I'd make it again, but not too often because of fat content.

I substituted cream of chicken instead of using the mushroom soup and it turned out perfectly!  (Although I think the mushroom soup would have tasted good as well)  These are fairly mild which is what my husband and I both like, but you could add some heat by adding hotter chiles or jalepenos.  I also made these in the crockpot which was an easy premade dinner, along with some spanish rice and salad and it was a great meal!

We love this at our house!  My family prefers cream of chicken soup to mushroom, but they'll eat whatever I use.  I sometimes also saute some chopped onion and green bell pepper with the chicken before filling the tortillas.  We've used beef and it is just as good.  As a previous reviewer said, I also use 12 tortillas in this recipe with plenty of sauce to spare.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

With a few personal additions, this was the best dish I think I've made. My girlfriend loved it. Took the leftovers to work for my Dad and a co-worker, and they both thought it was fantastic. The cream of chicken instead of mushroom was preferred by all. Using a rotisserie chicken instead made it a lot faster, and definitely shred it instead of cubes. Add chili powder or Taco seasoning. It's absolutely fantastice. Thank you.

Great recipe-  easy! I left out the chiles for 3 and 4 year old - shredded a whole roasted chicken from the grocery store - was the perfect amount of Chicken. Everyone LOVED it! Thanks! Will make again for sure.

Very easy and a delicious recipe. This was my first "white" cream sauce enchiladas, always did red sauce. I took other's advice and used cream of chicken soup and corn tortillas. I don't like soggy flour tortillas. Will make these again and try them on my kids who are very picky!

These were okay.  My kids really liked them, but my husband and I both thought they could use more chicken and less cheese.  They were very heavy.  My husband actually said you could take a container of nacho cheese sauce, mix it with chicken and get pretty much the same flavor.  Anyway, the only changes I made were to change the cream of mushroom soup to cream of chicken and I added a taco seasoning packet to the sauce.  I think next time I will use this recipe for the filling, but maybe use a green sauce for the topping to make it less heavy.

I make this recipe often for dinner and my boyfriend and I love it.  I serve it with mexican rice or ranch style beans and chips.  I like a red sauce on my enchiladas so I add red sauce to half for me and leave the other half plain for him.  Delicious both ways!

Delicious!  I added taco seasoning and bit of extra cheese to the mix, as suggested by others. I served them with a bit of salsa on top, which was a nice addition. Next time I'll stuff each one with more of the mix since they came out a bit on the flat side. Overall, very good!

These were delicious! I didn't have green chilies, so used hot salsa instead. I also used salsa jack cheese, instead of cheddar. Yummy!!

This was pretty darn good. I need to work on my enchilada roling technique, but otherwise it was fairly easy to make.  I used the tex-mex shredded cheese and doubled the recipe. It still only filled eight wraps, but maybe I overfilled them...like I said I'm no pro at rolling. Otherwise a good recipe that I will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  Instead of using cream of mushroom, I used cream of chicken soup and following another reviewer's suggestion, I also added a package of taco seasoning to the sauce.  Will definitely make again!

I made these when I had surpise guests the day after Thanksgiving.  I doubled the recipe and had enough to make 7 12-inch tortillas, although they were stuffed pretty full and most people could only eat a half of an enchillada.  My family raved about them and I had to give the recipe to three different people.  Will definitely make again.

Pretty good recipe. Doesn't taste so like authentic mexican food although. I didn't use the butter, and added taco seasoning as well as more spice. I think it tastes much better when you cut the chicken into smaller pieces. Overall, pretty good.

This was really good and easy.  I used a whole chicken that I had cooked in the crock pot and deboned.  I added a small, finely chopped tomato to the chicken mixture, as I had to use it up.  Everything else stayed the same.  Nice flavor, served with Mexican Rice.

This was great!  I only changed it a little - I used half of a shallot instead of green onions and added 2 TBSPs of spicey salsa to the shallots one minute before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients.  Also, instead of cheddar cheese, I used a mexican blend of cheeses.  Both the sour cream and cream of mushroom soup were reduced fat and everything was GREAT!  Thanks for a real keeper!

I'm from the Southwest..and I have to admit that at first I was a tad aprehensive with this recipe. But my yankee DH is not keen on corn tortilla enchiladas so I tried this one for him. He said it was a MUST have in our menu.  I think it was pretty awesome myself..and I'm a fan of corn tortilla recipes..... thanx for this one

I didn't have any green chiles, so I used a salsa with a lot of green chiles in it. And I probably added an extra half cup of cheese to the top.

Yep, next time I'll double it so we can enjoy left overs too.

Very tasty.  I used salsa instead of green chiles and I added diced onion, red pepper and a bit of taco seasoning to the filling/topping mixture.  I also topped the finished dish w/ fresh tomatoes & green onions, which I definitely recomend doing.  It adds some needed fresh flavor.  Over all, a very good starter recipe for enchiladas!  Thanks.

Had lot of hope for this one, but as a few reviewers said, it was so very bland.  There were many excellent suggestions from other reviewers but I fear this one was terminal.  My own recipe is still by far one of the best (I take bribes...)

This is probably not close to real enchiladas but they are yummy. They are probably delicious if the recipe was followed exactly but I did make some changes based on our preferences. I used  fat free sour cream and 98% fat free cream of chicken soup. I used regular onions instead of green onions. I added some taco seasoning to the chicken when I sauteed it. I added black pepper to the mixture. I'm not a big fan of leftovers but this heats up great. This is a great dish to make on a Sunday and eat throughout the week, or make ahead for a potluck. I've recently added a can each of black beans and corn to the mixture which was a nice addition. I don't like peppers but I bet finely diced red, green or yellow peppers, finely diced, would add some nice color.

I can't imagine what I would do improve this recipe.  It makes me pickier now when we order enchiladas in a restaurant.  Great reviews from my husband and we had enough for a couple of meals.

This was a great recipe!  I made a double batch and my husband only got a small piece when he got home from work! I only have two teenagers! We don't like green onions, so I carmelized a small chopped onion and added it to the mixture.  I also shredded the chicken instead of chopping it. Next time I make it I will add another can of soup as we like it with more "sauce".  A definite winner!

...This is a good recipe to use during the week for leftover chicken...Quick fix and filling if you double the recipe.  I roasted 2 chickens Sunday and used the dark meat of 1 for these enchiladas...My family prefers my standard recipe as these were very mild.  Was good served with spanish rice and my spicy guac with chips and salsa... Thanks.

LOVED this recipe, even though I changed it to use corn tortillas which I first softened in the skillet used to saute the onions.  Can't wait to try this again.

While we like our usual red sauce enchiladas better, this was a nice change of pace. This was a good recipe, although my only complaint was that the sauce filling was a little runny after they cooked. But, we did like them and will be making again.

A favorite in our house. I usually omit the chiles and sometimes the onions as well (use a little onion powder). I almost always add more cheese, I just can't resist. I LOVE these and I don't like mexican food.

This was very good! I used chicken quarters and boiled them for an hour before adding to the sauce. The gravy tasted a little salty but overall a very tasty meal.

I was suprised at how much flavor these had!  I cooked my chicken in the oven with some mexican seasoning which made it even more tasty!  This one doesn't cost a lot either!

Love this recipe! As I added the ingredients I kept thinking, there's no way this will be good - alas! I was wrong - simply excellent!

The night I made this it was a bit bland.  My husband and I added salsa on top to help.  This was much better the next day, perhaps it had time to soak up the juices.  The next time I would add cilantro and more onion.

Didn't make very much and what it did make wasn't very impressive. Tasted more like a casserole than an enchilada.

Some of the reviewers suggested adding a can of enchilada sauce so that it wouldn't be so dry. As I was making this it appeared dry, so I added half a can to the filling and then the other half I drizzled over the top over the creamy sauce and then sprnkled with cheese. The enchilada sauce also added some needed color. My husband thought this would look good on a buffet table and I agree.

This has become such a hit at my house!  Everything about it is delicious, left overs too. The only change is to use smaller tortillas.  I may also try corn tortillas sometime too.  It's so good as listed, I don't know if I should change a thing.

I made these last night but was forced to make a few changes. First, I used cream of chicken soup(I don't happen to like cream of mushroom) and then I realized I had no sour cream on hand, so thinking of an alternative, I used about a 1/4 cup of ranch dressing. I think they came out pretty good. My family loved them. I also used green chile sauce over the top as the soup mixture didn't seem to make enough sauce to cover. Any way, we were pleased with the outcome, and I may just experiment a bit more trying different ways.=)

Made this for work.  Doubled the reciped by using one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken soup.  Doubled all the other ingredients.  It was gone in no time.  Don't see a reason to saute the green onion in butter.  Just threw them into the sauce.  By skipping it you cut down on fat and time.

If I could give this more stars, I would. It is a family favorite! You can add steamed zucchini to the sauce. I also chopped about a tablespoon of jarred jalepeno peppers which gave it that extra zing. I also topped with chopped tomato and sour cream. This is a fantastic recipe!

really tasty twist and easy to make.  We loved the creaminess in contrast to my traditional red echilada sauce from a can.  I did a side sauce of green salsa verde and it was over the top!

I love this recipe.  While living in Australia we couldn't get green chiles, so had to use jalepenos instead.  Didn't use too many, just enough to give it a bit of flavor.  Yummy!

I made these for company last night and they all loved it. my husband liked it as well, however i though this was a little too creamy. I doubled the sauce like some reviews had suggested and that was way too creamy for my liking. This dish is simple to prepare and has good flavor. Next time I will not use so much sauce. I used a chicken that was already made from a local market and just shredded the meat of it to save time. The chicken tasted great and it made this dish that much easier to prepare.

I used twice as much sauce and cheese as the recipe called for and shredded the chicken.  It was a huge hit!  Even my picky 3-year-old loved it... next time I will double the recipe.

These were very yummy - I sprinkled extra green onions on the top and marinated the chicken in a spicy taco sauce to give it a kick.

I have made this dish 3 times now, all three of my children love this dish, even my 2 year old.
I use a supermarket chicken already cooked and use cream of chicken soup with the sour cream. I omit the chile (because of the kids) and top with whatever cheese I have in the fridge. It is absoutely delicious. (i use whole wheat tortillas)

Mmmmm.... really really tasty. I put some fajita mix in with the chicken/mushroom and that was delicious. It was super simple to prepare and the flavours worked great together. I only give it 4 stars due to the richness with all the cheese and the lack of veggies. Next time I will put some greens into the mix as well. But over all, two thumbs up! Thanks

This was very very good. I also doubled the recipe...thank God! That is a must. Though, even though I doubled it I only got 4 tortillas out of it. I also boiled the chicken and then shredded it and mixed it with Taco Seasoning. For the sauce, I added real garlic instead of powdered and some cayanne, salt and hot sauce for some spice. Lastly, I made mexican rice to go along side and decided to put a spoonful of the rice into each tortilla. That was great!

The whole family loved it.  I did double the recipe except for the tortillas.  I accidently grabbed one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken, but it still turned out great.

Not that impressed.  I think they need more filling, so I would double the recipe.  Flavor was OK.

Yum!  I think next time, I might omit the Cream of Mushroom and use queso blanco or queso fresco cheese instead.  ...make more of a cheese sauce.  My husband is not a cream of mushroom fan but I didn't tell him it was in there and he never noticed.  He loved these un-traditional enchiladas.

I double the recipe (with a large family) but only use 1 can of mushroom soup and eliminate the milk.  I substitute minced garlic and also add 1-2 t. cumin and 2-3T. fresh chopped cilantro.  The recipe has great mexican flavor without the overwhelming canned soup taste and consistency. Thanks for a great recipe!

I love enchiladas and these were very good.  I did find them a little salty (probably the soup) and a little bland so I opened a bottle of salsa and poured it over top.  I have to admit that I probably will stick with the Enchiladas IV from this site as my enchiladas of choice.

This recipe is really yummy! I made it last night as a casserole, just layering the tortillas instead of rolling them up and it was delicious!
Added a little Tabasco to the sauce.
Will definitely make again!

YUMMY! This recipe is a keeper. My husband is not fond of chicken but he had seconds of this, so I know it was good. I did add some cumin and a few dashes of cayenne pepper. I am all for recipes that don't take a lot of work but taste really good, this is one of them.

Delicious recipe. Got Monday morning raves after a Sunday evening dinner even -- and better yet, the raves came from my father in law. I doubled the recipe more or less -- used a Family Size can of cream of chicken instead of mushroom and used half corn and half flour tortillas to suit our combined tastes in the family. Used 6-8" tortillas and it worked well. Added a dash of cumin to the cream sauce and two cans of chiles (one hot, one medium). Don't let the blandness of the sauce from the pan fool you. If you let it sit/simmer a bit, the flavors of the chiles start to show some heat. I garnished with green onions and cheddar cheese. Served with sides of spanish/mexican quinoa and a spicy cole slaw, which was a perfect combination. Highly recommend this recipe. Next steps will be tweaking it over time to be equally delcious, but more nutritious -- the creams and lard-based tortillas are way too heavy to make this dish a regular staple, but for a special occassion it is ideal. I'm always looking for recipes for dinner parties that I can prepare in advance and just casually put in the oven as everyone is chatting over appetizers. This dish definitely fit the bill.

AWESOME! If I could give this 10 stars, I would. My sister introduced me to this recipe years ago and this became my signature enchilada dish. I haven't made these since I cooked for my in-laws and used habenero sauce (not a good idea)We do 1 can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery, everything else is about the same. Thanks so much for posting Steph.

Just didn't care for these ~ I was disappointed after seeing how many stars this recipe got! Just not enough flavor for me...missing the tomatoes! Won't make this again. Sorry.

Excellent!  The leftovers where just as good as the main meal.  These can be easily frozen into individual dinners for times when your on the go.

Although these were good, I found they were a little salty even though I used low sodium soup.  I did cook the chicken with some fajita seasoning like another reviewer suggested, maybe that was the cuase of the salty flavor. And, although I liked the recipe, it seemed more like a chicken casserole rather than what I think of as enchiladas.

I loved it, but my husband wasn't blown away.  Nothing absolutely amazing, but given how easy and cheap it was, definitely 5-star!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it only turned out to be about 3 servings though.  Will definitely make again.

Yummy! Very rich though, especially since I doubled the sauce per other reviewers. I also used yellow onions because it was what I had, and one can of cr. of mush. and one cr. of chicken. It was still great. It is very versitale and would still be great any way you change it up. Will be a regular!

My hubby is a selective eater and doesn't go for vegetables so this is perfect.  He really liked it and I've made this for guys at work before and they were gone in a flash.  I use the green onions as a garnish (makes my hubby happy) and also offer either green or red enchilada sauce to put on each individual serving. Great recipe.

This is a great recipe!  Very quick and delicious!  For a "kid friendly"  version I make it without the chiles and have even used cubed Banquet brand chicken tenders instead of the chicken breast meat.  Always turns out great either way :)

I am a bartender, and so is my husband, when he brings these leftovers, complete with my homemade salsa, and Guacamole, well it's a big fork fight! O.K., #1 you HAVE to shred your chicken, no chopping allowed. #2 mushrooms. #3 good salsa.#4 good guacamole #5 top with sour cream and eat!

I followed it exactly except I used fresh minced garlic.It tasted like canned green chiles and canned mushroom soup.I should have known,but lots of people liked it,so I thought maybe the flavors mixed together would make this good.

Quick, easy, tasty.  My husband enjoyed this and he's a picky eater!  I added chopped white onions with the green onions and added sliced black olives with the chicken.  Would definitely make again.

I doubled this recipe for my sons birthday with a few changes. Only used 1 teaspoon of butter. Regular chopped onion, not green.  Added a can of cream of chicken soup along with mushroom. One can chlies and one can of diced tomatoes & green chilies drained.  Boiled 4 large chicken breasts.  Added a teaspoon each of cumin, chili powder and cayenne pepper.  We like things hot. Even better left over the next day!

These were great! I used the chicken verde soup and added black beans to the chicken mix. I had leftover chicken, so I put that in the steamer for 15 minutes and sprinkled 1/2 packg of taco seasoning on it. This ones a keeper!

Excellent! Easy to make and tasty. These enchiladas are a nice change from the traditional ones smothered in tomato sauce. I used leftover roasted chicken (from the supermarket) and burrito-size tortillas and it yielded four large enchiladas. Serve with spanish-style rice. Use the remaining sour cream to make a coffee cake.

Very good! I made with white onions & taco seasoning after reading the recommendations. But used cream of chicken instead of mushroom which was great! Added xtra cheese and jalepenos on top. I used Swanson canned white chicken, which was good and easy!

I used spicy jack cambels soups instead of cream of mushroom, and white onions instead of green. I thought it was pretty good, my husband said it wasnt his favorite, my daughter wouldnt eat it (then again she doesnt eat much of anything other than grilled cheese!)

Sooo delicious!  I'm a total beginner cook, but even with this dish it turned out like a professional did it!  I took a risk and made it for the first time for a bunch of friends, not knowing how it would turn out.  Needless to say, I got oozing compliments and my picky sister said it was the best dish she ever tasted!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for my parents anniversery and they loved it, my father had seconds!  I used a smaller baking dish and made three layers (one tortia on top of another and so on)  This served 3 (or 2 if someone has seconds)
I added chili seasoning to the sauce and used white onion instead.  I also added precooked southwestern chicken strips and cut them into chunks.  I taste tested it and it didn't taste bland at all!

I have never made Chicken Enchiladas before and boy are these great.  I was so proud of myself.  I kept telling family and friends to come over and I would make them for dinner.  I used to have to read it word for word now I know it by heart.  The only thing I do different is use HOT Jalepeno's to spice it up as we like spicy foods.   THANKS for the recipe.

I made these last night. It was great for leftover chicken, and very easy to make. Not exactly sure they tasted like enchilladas though. I added about 1/2 cup of taco sauce to the reserve and that added some spice, which I like. Thanks for a very easy, inexpensive, tasty recipe to use up leftover chicken.

I guess I just expected a lot more from this recipe.  It seemed a bit rich, but not flavorful.  My husband asked me to never make it again.  I think it was just average.

Good but not great.  As is, this recipe is a little bland.  The chicken definately needs some taco seasoning.  I would suggest some sauted onions, and maybe putting some green onions on top for garnish, more cheese (I am a cheese-aholic), and less sauce.  I think that the soup over-powered everything in the dish.  I will probably make this again, just with some customized changes.

The best enchiladas ever!!!  I added fresh mushrooms and sauted with green onions.  I also added some chicken base and a little extra sour cream ( I used light sour cream)  It came out extra creamy and fabulous.  Great recipe!

Very good recipe. I used 2 cups of chicken, and I still only got 2 12" tortillas worth. Also, I used 3 hot serrano peppers instead of milder chilis, and this gave it some kick it might otherwise have been lacking.  I used white onion instead of green (I think green tends to overpower things) and sauteed the peppers along with the onion. If you're like me and don't like mushrooms then don't worry, you can't even tell theres mushrooms in this. Very tasty.

These are great...the onion was a little overpowering. That is the only thing I will do differently next time, less onion.  Very good.

This was very tasty.  I think you can add more or less of any
ingredient and it would still come out just as tasty.
My husband loved it but he hates cream of mushroom soup but
I didn't tell him what kind of soup it was so I can make it again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this enchilada recipe! I've used it at least six times and the only change I've made is to add about 1/2 C more chicken. I even made these for my Spanish class and everyone really enjoyed them. EDIT: Since writing this review a few years ago, I've gone on a low-carb diet due to diabetes and it was even great when using flat out bread. I love this recipe :*

This recipe was soooo goood, and so easy!  I used the chicken I had left over from Busy Day chicken (which I make with chicken thighs and legs), so I don't know how affected the flavor was, but it was delicious!  I only ended up with three large enchiladas (which completely filled my baking dish), and I used a ton of cheese on top.

I made this recipe using ground beef instead of chicken. I just browned a pound and a half of beef with half a chopped onion and followed the rest of the recipe. I did use extra cheese on top, and used half medium cheddar and half monterey jack. This is delicious!

Yummy.    This was so good.   My kids (2 teens, 1 preteen) actually argued over who got the last 2 as leftovers the next day.   I followed the recipe almost exactly.    My only substitutions were cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom and 8" tortillas instead of 12".    I served them with pintos & cheese, corn cakes and spanish rice.    Everyone thought it was better than eating out.

When it comes to enchilada recipes, this one takes the cake for sure! I used regular onion in place of green onion, and green bell pepper in place of chiles since that was all I had. What a delicious meal!

I have added this recipe into my monthly rotation of recipes. This isn't the most outstanding mexican food, but it suits everyone's palates who eat at my table... esp my son. It is also super easy to make. Thank you!

My boyfriend put it well: "Good, but it didn't blow my socks off".  Very easy to make, and I followed some of the other advice; didn't use the entire can of soup and we used rotel instead of green chiles.  It was ggod, but still lacking something.  I will try it again and experiment.  Also, we only cooked it for about 25 minutes.

This was a great starter recipe for me. I added chopped green, yellow and red bellpeppers in addition to the green chilis. Once I had everything mixed up, I thought the taste was a ilttle bland. We like things spicy, so I added green enchilada sauce and some chili powder. Turned out great!

When i read cream of mushroom soup i almost didn't make it since there aren't mushroom lovers in my party. Made it anyway and it was Teriffic! the green chiles didn't make it very spicy at all. I used Kraft "Mexican" blend cheese and it worked fine as a sub for chedder. Also adding a little of the remaining cream of mushroom soup while cooking the chicken (which is not mentioned in the recipe) turned out pretty tender. I will definitely make this again. (oh by the way, the prep time is wrong if you factor in pre-cooking the chicken.)

This was a little too creamy/ milky with the soup.  But a good meal every once in a while.  Partner's immediate reaction was to approve, but changed his mind later after eating a meal of it.  he voted it a 3 too.

Awesome Enchiladas!!!  I used a 9X13 glass dish, roll the tortillas (didn't fold them under) and the edges come out crispy.  YUM! YUM!  Prep time is probably more like 30 minutes though. Love this recipe!  Thanks!

This was the best, I made it for a large group, everyone raved about it.  I did add some peppers (red/yellow) for color, onions, and extra chicken to fill up the tortillas.  I will be making this again soon.

GREAT RECIPE. ONLY THING DIFFERENT I DO IS ADD A CAN OF ROTEL CHILI MIX INSTEAD OF THE GREEN CHILI. I THINK IT GIVES IT MORE OF A KICK.

Wonderful!  I seasoned chicken tenders with cajun seasoning and then fried with a bit of oil, then cut it in cubes.  Used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar.  Absolutely fantastic recipe, and now my staple if I ever need to make a meal for a sick friend/neighbor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love these enchiladas!  I followed the recipe as written and it came out perfect.  For my husband who likes things spicy, I sprinkled diced jalapenos on top prior to baking.  Served with Mexican rice and black bean salad.  My husband raved over it and believe it or not, he actually got a little angry at me for not making this sooner!  : )  Thank you for the great recipe!

The whole family loved this!  I did use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I sauted it with the green onions.  I also, used corn tortillas instead of flour.  I dipped each tortilla in the sause that was set aside before rolling the filling inside.  It was great!

Eliminated butter, replaced garlic powder for real garlic.  Added precooked carrots, onion, garlic, celery, zucchini and rice.  Used quite a bit more chicken and nonfat sour cream as others suggested.  Used all of cream mixture with chicken filling.  Made extra sauce with soup and taco seasoning to use over dish.  Added cheese last 15 minutes.  Very good.

My husband is the big mexican cook in our house.. so I thought I'd give him a run for his money by making this dish. It was delicious!! We both loved them. They were not spicy enough for us so I served these with a side of spicy spanish rice. Thanks!

These are good if you are looking for a creamy style enchilada.  When I was preparing the sauce, I was hesitant about the "soupy" taste, but after baking, the flavors blended better.  I still prefer a traditional red sauce enchilada, but my husband liked these better.

AMAZING - topped it off with homemade enchilada sauce.  Did not require the milk.  The enchilada sauce gave it the boost I like (just slight kick) serve with mexican rice, salad and guacamole, yum!

Delish!! Slight change was that I cooked the chicken slowly with cumin, stock, and a  dash of red wine vinegar then shred it. I also used cream of chicken soup rather than the mushroom, and I added some salsa on the top with the cheese.   Just beautiful!!!

This was just OK.  It was quick and easy as well as creamy, but it just seemed something was missing.  I doubled the sauce batch as well, and was able to get about 10.

These tasted great.  The only thing that I didn't like was that they were pretty runny.  The leftovers were great, though!!  I did what others said and doubled the sauce and it made 10 enchiladas.  I'm sure I'll make this one again.

Only complaint is that it did not yield 6 servings. I only got three out of it, but I used big tortillas. Perhaps I was supposed to use the small ones?

This was my first time ever to make Enchiladas myself; this was very tasty! I took the advice of others and doubled the sour cream and cheese. I used one 12 oz and one 8 oz can of cooked, cubed chicken (drained). I added spices of salt, pepper, garlic powder, dried cilantro, chili powder. I used white onions since I was out of green. I really appreciating the posting, I would recommend that you try this.

This is a great recipe.  My husband, they stereotypical "meat and potatoes man" absolutely loves them too.  I made a couple of small modifications.  First, I double the recipe so we can have some left overs for lunches, also, I add some chopped cilantro (1-2 T, depending on your taste)as well as some fresh squeezed lime juice both in the filling, and in the sauce.  It's a HIT!

This is very good.  Most of the reviews with recommendations to add more sour cream, cheese and soup mix are correct.  I basically tripled the cheese, cream of chicken, sour cream  and added a can of cream of mushroom.  Thanks for the great recipe.  The family loved it.

My boyfriend and I loved these.  I realized after I had started making them that I was out of green onion, so I used green pepper instead.  I also used cream of chicken soup, and salsa instead of the chiles.  They are very filling!

These are good when you need a quick meal!  I use cream of chicken soup in place of the mushroom, used minced garlic instead of powder, and skip the chiles.  I mix all the ingrediants together and roll it up in the tortillas.  I then top the dish with enchilada sauce (canned or homemade) and a little more cheese.  They even reheat pretty well for lunch the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used Cambells soup new pepper jack cheese instead of mushroom and mexican style cheese instead of cheddar.  I also omitted the chili because the soup I used had a nice kick to it already.  Thanks for sharing Steph.

What a unique twist on regular enchiladas. My husband and I really liked these - the kids were not as impressed, but they are very picky lately. I used regular onions instead of green onions and used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom soup (what I had on hand).  Good!

This was delicious and a nice change from the tomato and cheese kind of enchiladas.  I subbed sweet yellow onion for the green, and diced left-over pork sirloin roast from "ROAST PORK LOIN AND POTATOES"
(www.epicurious.com) for the chicken.  GREAT with a green salad.

Eventhough this is a tasty dish I'm only giving it 3 stars.  5 stars to me is OUTSTANDING, and this wasn't.  It was just good.  Also I had to modify the recipe for MY TASTE.  The original recipe for me & hubby was too bland.  To give it more flavor I added tapatio sauce, salsa, cumin, cayenne, etc.  It needed alot of help to taste like it didn't come from a can.  I also doubled the amount of sauce, and used 3 chicken breasts.  My advice is to taste the sauce before mixing in the chicken so you can season it to your liking.  If you do that you wont be disappointed.

This was a big hit with my husband. The green chiles gave the dish some real zip. I subbed the canned chiles with 3 "fresh" frozen, roasted, skinned and diced big jim chiles.

Just what I was looking for. Very mild for picky husband and toddler, but nice cheesy flavor. I used cream of chicken because it's what I prefer, and regular onion because it's what I had. I also made my own tortillas from a recipe on this site. This is a keeper!

I couldn't wait to try this recipe... but after the first bite I knew that I'd made a mistake.  Tortillas were chewy, not enough sauce.  I'll stick to my shrimp enchilladas next time.

Sorry, these didn't really do it for us. My twins ate it (they eat pretty much anything, though) but my 8 and 3 year old took one bite. I thought it was too creamy, had that "processed food" aftertaste and the texture was off. I'll keep looking for that ultimate chicken enchilada recipe.

My hisband loved this dish.  He is usually not a fan of mexican food but he raved about this dish and ate the leftovers the next day!  I did make a few changes to the recipe.  I used cream of chicken soup (that was all I had, added spinach, and a can of mushrooms.  This dish was delicious and a nice change.  Thank you.

This recipe is very simple, but has no authenticity to a traditional Mexican enchilada dish.  I decided to purchase pre-shredded Mexican cheese mix for authenticity.  Also, the portioning is way off.  I adjusted the recipe to 18, and it barely served 10.

This was pretty good and realtively quick and easy. The only change I made was that I used whole wheat tortillas, since that's what we prefer. Boyfriend said that it could have been spicier (but then, he puts hot sauce on everything), so I might use jalapenos in place of the green chiles next time.

IT'S A HIT! If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would. This is the best thing I've made with chicken that the kids like, too. It's easy to make but tastes like you spent all day in the kitchen. I usually make a few enchiladas with the stuffing as is for the kids, then I add some chopped jalapenos to the rest for me and Mr. Imladrischef. :)

This recipe is easy to add or modify to change it up. The first time I made this the bottom of the enchiladas was too dry, so to compensate add some sauce to the bottom of the pan before you add the tortillas.

Really quick and easy. Boyfriends have all loved it. I usually add more cheese and onions.

I cooked the chicken w/ cumin, garlic salt, and pepper, used low fat sour cream, and used monteray jack cheese. VERY YUMMY. I also used a can of jalepenos instead of chiles, which I will not do again because my face was sweating after one bite!! Will definitely make again. Perfect for 2.

YUMMY! I used several ideas from others. I used cream of chicken instead of the mushroom, and cooked the chicked with olive oil and cummin. I also used light sour cream and skim milk. Dish was wonderful, only complaint was that it did not make much. tTe serving for 6 did not feed four. I will defintely double the recipe next time. This dish is a keeper. Thanks!

I made this using fat free sour cream, low fat mushroom soup, and skim milk.  It was very good but a little bland for my taste.  I'll make it again but will add the spices others have recommended.

This was good in a pinch.  I had cooked chicken in the freezer and everything else in the pantry.  Made a quick meal.  Would be good with black beans and rice.

This dish was good, however, I don't think i'd call it enchiladas.  I think i'd name it creamy chicken burritos. Only because it's missing the traditional sauce, and uses flour tortillas.  It's still very good though.  I would be lying if I said I was rating this recipe 5 stars, but rather, i'm rating my own modification of this, as it is no longer this recipe when you modify it.  I didn't make any drastic changes.  I used cream of chicken soup, jarred pickeled jalapenos instead of chilis, and monterey jack cheese.  For an extra something I threw in some revived dry morels I had laying around.  The dish was very creamy, and had a nice kick to it from the jalapenos.  I prefer flour tortillas to corn, so that didn't bother me at all, and I like the chewy consistency it has.  All in all it was a great dish. *****

This is great, but I did modify it some according to other suggestions.  Seasoned chicken with cumin, salt & pepper, then doubled sour cream, chopped up a few canned jalapenos and added to sauce, and nearly tripled the amount of green chiles since we like a lil' more kick.  Also ended up using a LOT more cheese.  These were fabulous!

This was okay but it doesn't taste like enchiladas at all.  I made this for some friends who were expecting a Mexican dinner, and it tasted like chicken pot pie.  No one finished their small portions and ended up eating chips and salsa for dinner instead.

I make these a lot and I don't know how they come up with 6 12 inch tortillas. I'm lucky if I can fill 5 smaller tortillas. BUT they taste wonderful and my family LOVES them! I don't change a thing (besides the tortialla size).

This was a great recipe, I'm not a fan of the tomato/enchiladas sauce that are on a traditional enchilada so these were yummy and very easy to make for someone who is relatively new to cooking like me!

This was very creamy and good.  I didn't change a thing.  My husband loved it!  Next time I would like it be a bit more spicier - so will do a mix of jalepenos and green chiles.
Thank you Steph!!!

I used this recipe as a guideline only and it turned out decent.  Made quite a number of changes:  For starters, I put the chicken in the crockpot with red enchilada sauce on high for about 5 hours and shredded it.  For the last hour, I tossed in some cumin, parsley, chili pepper, and a bay leaf.  As others suggested, I used cream of chicken soup.  I think next time, I would just mix in some sour cream with the chicken and use queso blanco on top.  We have this in the dairy section at my local grocery store and this is what I've had at Mexican restaurants.  I drizzled some of the leftover red enchilada sauce on top before adding the cheese.

Excellent! very yummy recipe. I substituted corn tortillas in place of the flour tortillas, just to make it seem more authentic and came out very yummy. I also added a can of cream of chicken soup just to add more flavor & stretch the sauce out further. I added a little chopped cilantro to the sauce mixture and came out great. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will be making this in the future at least once a month! THANKS AGAIN!!

My husband would eat this everyday if I would let him. It is so wonderful with the partially drained Rotel added to the mixure right before pouring over the enchiladas. Goya mexican rice is a great compliment. YUM!

The flavor in these was great!  I sprayed my pan with cooking spray instead of greasing it and my tortillas were a little too tough on the bottom.  Next time I think I will make more of the sauce since I felt like I didn't have enough.

These were delicious!  The best enchiladas I've had; we just loved the creamy sauce. They were really good warmed up, too, so they are good to have for the lunch the following day.  I will double the recipe next time just for this reason!  A hit with the entire family.  Thanks, Steph!

This Is an absolutely fabulous recipe...the only change I made was using corn tortillas...use some oil in a pan and bring it to just a boil and only dip the tortillas in for a few seconds so they become bendable...made this many times and always get asked for the recipe...but I'm not gonna share it, it's my little secret...Is a favorite of ours and will make all the time..Thanks Steph..

When I cook chicken now, I make enough extra so that I can make this recipe- it's one my husband always tells me that I can make again!!!

I liked this recipe, but used corn tortillas and cream of chicken soup as others suggested.  My husband, however, just ate and didnt say a word... not a good sign!

These were just okay. I doubled the recipe and used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom, as suggested by some. I think I might like it better with only cream of mushroom, and if I make it again I will follow the recipe exactly. The leftovers were not very appealing the next day, since it was just okay when we ate them the first time. After some tweaking this might be better.

It does not get better than this!!  I was very impressed.  If you like the creamy taste and texture this is a sure hit!  I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom and it was fantastic!!  Very easy to make and flavorful!  I will be making this one many times in the future!

I thought these were oh so yummy but alas my usually non-picky 8 yr old did not. Since I thought they were a 5 and he wouldn't eat more than one bite I went for the middle ground and gave them a 3.  Unfortunately, it is just the two of us so I unless I have dinner guests I will not be making this again.

Very good recipe - I took the advice of others & added 1 can of Rotel partially drained to the sauce at the end...  Also, doubled the sauce.  I just boiled three large chicken breasts and it worked well - made ~12 10" enchiladas.

This is my favorite recipe I have made from this website. If you like Mexican food, you must try this recipe. I left out the green chilies because I did not have any, however, they were still wonderful. I served it with mexican rice, chips and salsa. I served bananas foster for dessert. Wonderful recipe!!!

I made this tonite for my husband and grown son...they were excellent!  I added a little for cheese to the filling and used 98% fat free cream of chickend soup and lo fat sour cream.  Also added some hot picante sauce and sliced black olives to the top before baking.  Served it with Spanish Rice and a salad..will definitely make this again.

Easy to make and great to eat.
To make the tortillas easier to roll, I microwaved them for 11 seconds prior to filling.  Will be making these again.

I normally prefer red enchilada sauce, but I may be making this version more often! Very good! I added a little extra diced chilies, but other than that, this is perfect!

I thought is was good, a nice change from beef.  But the second time around I did increase the amount of sauce for the outside of the enchiladas and made sure I covered the bottom of the pan with sauce also before I placed the enchiladas in the pan to prevent *any* sticking.  I also increased the amount of chicken.  Because I thought the green chilis left it too mild, I replaced them chopped jalapenos. Thanks!

Definitely a very different version of enchiladas.  I prefer a little more kick, so I added some salsa.  Will probably make again but it isn't my favorite.

I enjoyed this recipe. I will try a mexican cheese next time instead of cheddar, just personal preference. Very easy and tasty. I only used half a can of chiles, which was enough spice for us.

My husband thought they were pretty good but I thought they needed some more spice. Perhaps substituting jalapenos for the chiles. As is, the recipe needs a little more heat. Not bad though.

WOW!! These were great.  I only used four tortillas, and this meal was fantastic! The creamy sauce was succulent- I served this with Spanish rice (from this site, and not from a mix!-go me!) and Mexi-corn.  The man of the house was quite pleased. Thanks for a greeeeaaat recipe! It's a keeper :o)

This is my favorite chicken enchilada recipe!  The only changes I made were I used white onion instead of green, used less cream of mushroom soup and more sour cream, shredded the chicken up a bit, and used 12 small corn tortillas rather than flour.  Excellent dish - thanks for sharing, Steph!

This recipe was alright, but it was alot of work since I didn't already have the chicken meat ready.  My husband liked it, but said it needed more "flavor".  Ok, but I don't think I'd make this one again.

This recipe was a refreshing change to the ususal red sauce.  I added a small can of black olives and it was really good.  I made traditional side items such as rice and beans with this but they did not compliment each other well.  Great recipe but it didn't taste like a mexican dish.

i was skeptical because I don't like cream of mushroom soup, but I ended up using it (my husband loves it) and it tasted great.  Only had jack cheese (yum!) and added chopped olives (yumyum!)

This was a pretty good and easy recipe. I suggest you double the sauce, though. It just didn't make as much as I would have liked. The bottoms of the enchiladas hardened really easily and I think that was due to lack of extra sauces. :o)

Loved this recipe! Used corn tortillas, low fat cream of chicken soup, and white instead of green onions. I topped with a little hot sauce after baking. On the next round, I added a 4oz can of diced jalepanos in addition... this was delicious, but only add this if you like very spicy foods!

From the reviews I thought these would be awesome but we thought they were very bland and lifeless.  We didn't even finish the pan.  I have a similar recipe that is made with cream of chicken soup and that adds a lot more flavor.

I liked these a lot.  They are kind of like Texas King Ranch Casserole except for they use flour instead of corn tortillas and the tortillas are rolled instead of cut into pieces.  I might add just a touch more milk on the final step to make them more saucy.

We really liked these.  The creamy sauce (vs classic tomato-y enchilada sauce) was a nice change.  My tortillas were smaller, so I was able to make 8 enchiladas.

This was pretty bland, but had a nice flavor.  I used Golden Mushroom Soup with Garlic, and that was basically what I tasted.  I also thought it was kind of dry.

this dish is wonderful, I do add a 1/2c of salsa over the top then add shredded cheese to make it pretty.  I've forgotten the milk and added extra fat free sour cream.. and I use the low fat cheese and  low fat creme of mush soup. saves calories and missing no taste...

Awesome.  I cooked the chicken and then put some taco season on the meat.  It was soo good! And it gave it a little more of a punch. I will keep this recipe handy.

Really good.  I doubled the recipe and it was just perfect for 10 smaller enchiladas.  I also added about 3/4 cup of tomato sauce and some spices to the recipe.  It was really good.  My picky kids ate it!

We liked these overall but found them to be a bit too bland for our tastes.  Next time I will definitely add chili powder and use jalapenos instead of the green chilis.  Loved that they went together so quickly.  Thanks Steph!

Delicious!  I was in a hurry to get these done so I did some pretty strange things.  I only had uncooked chicken breasts so I cut them into cubes and browned them.  Then I threw in a packet of taco seasoning, some hot salsa, and water and let it simmer for a few minutes until I thought they were cooked.  I scooped out the chicken with a little bit of the sauce and proceeded with the recipe as printed.  I loved it -- spicy, creamy, yummy.  Probably too spicy for non-spice lovers but it suited me (an avowed enchilada hater) just fine.

I made this as a last minute dinner. I was going to order out, but realized I didn't stop at an ATM machine. So I logged on to this site, and found this recipe. When I saw that I had all the ingredients, I quickly through it together, and within 45 minutes, it was completely done. My 13yr old daughter and 10 yr old son loved it! I served it with homemade chicken soup that I had left in the refridgerator from a previous dinner, and a quick salad. I was very impressed, because I didn't have to spend a dime, and it was done within the same time I could've had a pizza delivered! But it was a healthier meal, and my kids liked it better then pizza!

This was ok but I doctored it up quite a bit.  I cooked the chicken in taco seasoning, used salsa instead of milk and added a couple jalopenos to it.  Still it was rather bland so we topped it with more salsa.  I also doubled the recipe as many have said to do, and still only had enough filling to make 6 decent sized enchiladas.  As i said we liked what I ended up with but then again, it was quite different than the recipe I started with.

This recipe is fantastic!  I add onions and bell peppers and I usually make a little more of the sauce.  Everyone I have made this for loves it.  Thanks!

Great recipe!!  I used the flour tortillas, which ended up having a super soft (almost) soggy texture(was still very yummy)...maybe corn tortillas don't have that?  I didnt shred the chicken, merely cut it up into very small pieces and that worked well. I used half milk, half enchilada sauce, cream of chicken soup.... instead of canned chilies used 2 fresh chilies, one half fresh jalepeno and WOW.  Even my extremely picky nearly nine year old niece loved it.  This dish freezes well, too.  Will certainly use this recipe again.  Thank you so much!!!

Sooooo good!!  I left out the green onions because I don't like them, and like some other reviewers I substituted cream of chicken soup.  My brother looked at them very warily because of the green chilis, but the whole family ended up loving them!!  I would definitely recommend these!!

This was quite tastey. The only thing I changed was I added a little green chile salsa and a tad more garlic. My family gobbled it up. My husband said it didn't taste authentic, but he ate two helpings and all leftovers-- so I guess he liked it too. I'll make this one again.

Quick and easy chicken enchiladas!  I used low or non-fat sour cream, soup, and cheese with whole wheat tortillas.  It was still very good!  Not quite as good as the "take the whole day, make a big mess enchiladas" BUT great for a quick dinner!

This dish was absolutely delicious! I used ground chicken since I had some on hand and added 2 teaspoons of cumin and fresh garlic to the ground meat mixture. My family ate the entire pan.  I will be making these on a weekly basis.

I had to make a number of substitutions in this recipe -- cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, garlic salt instead of powder, and chives instead of onions and chiles.  It was a very tasty recipe, and I will make it again.

This was perfect.  I was just what I was looking for. I just made these for a Tex-Mex dinner party for 12.  Everyone loved them.  I would add a little more garlic to the white sauce though.  I purchased a couple of already roasted chickens from the store to shred, as they are already brined (and tasty!). Delicious!

Excellent! The kids loved them just the way the recipe read.  For the grownups we spiced them up a bit with jalapenos. Oh, we did add more cheese.

Yummy! I added more cheese like suggested from others, and I thought they were great. I omitted the green onion but we didn’t miss it. I would call these baked chicken burritos rather than enchiladas though, and for a burrito these are wonderful! I will defiantly make again, super easy.

I have made this a few times now and just got to posting. Its a yummy and easy meal. Based upon some suggestions that have been posted, I added a touch of hot sauce to the chicken. I have also used can chicken before when in a pinch and they turned out great. My husband likes...so I like. Thank you for the recipe

I made this for my boyfriend and he just raved over it! I ended up not having cream of mushroom and substituted cream of chicken instead and it turned out great. I warmed some refried beans and whipped up some mexican rice and whoa what a meal!! He thought he was at the local cantina!!

This recipe is fabulous. We changed the cream of mushroom to chicken, but have made it both ways and both are great. Also, it would be easy to lower the fat in this recipe-- we just haven't bothered to yet! Thanks, Steph, for a popular and delicious dinner.

Great/delicious, very tasty and flavorful. Simple ingredients and quick to put on the table. I made this last night and we loved it. The sauce was made differently than I've made before, without tomatoes or salsa. My kids don't like chili peppers so I used banana peppers instead and the flavor was not as hot as my husband and I like but it was VERY good. I especially like that it was simple and quick to prepare. The only problem was it didn't make enough for seconds, so next time I'll double. I'm sure there won't be any left overs.

It was OK, did not all get eaten.  A little bland, maybe if you had just one more taste to liven it up it could be REALLY good.  Maybe fresh cut tomatoes served on top like a garnish?  I probably won't make it again.

This is so yummy and very easy! I use Velveeta instead of Cheddar and cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom. It is just spicy enough for adults, but not too spicy for my kids. Definitely a winner!

My whole family loved this recipe, simple, not too spicy for kids, and a lot of fun. It didn't really take very long either. I make the cooked chicken part simple, by cooking a whole chicken in my crock pot, and then bagging up the cooked chicken, and having homemade stock too. THis recipe, the first time I made it, was using leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. It was a nice change from rehashing the main meal again and again.

Very good! Don't forget to add the milk to the top mixture, like I did.  I served them with black beans and of course chips & salsa. Excelente!

Not what I was looking for but not bad.  I agree with another poster that this is more
like Enchilada Cassorole in a tortilla.  I wanted a more Mexican restaurant style
chicken enchilada.  I found that it was better the second day around.

I have been using the same enchilada recipe for years so I decided to try this one for a change.  This was a good recipe.  My family enjoyed it.  I will probably make it again even though I prefer my other to this one.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent! I should have known a Hall of fame recipe wouldn't let us down. I used leftover turkey and regular onion instead of green. It was easy and very good. Even my picky daughter ate some.

This is by far one of the best enchilada recipes ever!  It is quick & easy.  I serve it with refried (vegetarian) beans on the side for a meal.  Everyone I make this for asks for the recipe!

It was ok, but too rich for our taste.  We followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added more peppers and red enchilada sauce instead of milk,  which I think helped the recipe, but we still probably wouldn't make it again.

Aside from the tortilla wrap and minced green chilies, there isn't anything remotely Mexican about this dish.  A nice change, however, that tasted o.k., but for convenience sake I used a can of chicken instead of fresh chicken that I cooked myself.  That may have affected the overall taste since the canned chicken is simply too salty.

This was very easy to make - it did take a little longer than the approx. prep time. It was worth it though. My husband loved it. It was not as spicy as he likes. next time I may add some jalepenjos.  i will definately make it again!!

I made this when my daughter and her husband came over.  Her husband said it tasted like authentic Mexican food, and he is a very picky eater.  I like the idea it does not have tomatoes. It was excellent and easy to make.

These were very disappointing.  The flavor was nothing special.  There didn't seem to be enough sauce so they turned out kind of dry.  I have a chicken enchilada recipe I made up myself that's 50 times better than these. I seriously doubt I will make this again.

My 10 year old had a very easy time with this recipe and we both liked it very much.  I would prefer it a little spicier myself so if you are just serving adults you may want to add a little bit more kick to it!!

Great recipe, easy to make right, but uses a LOT of dishware...a nightmare if you don't have a dishwasher, but worth it.  My boyfriend loved it, and he's 100% mexican! Thanks, you made an Asian trying to cook for a mexican successful!

These are the BEST enchiladas!! My hubby requests these on a weekly basis--which is unusual for him! I did use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. The mushroom soup just didn't sound appealling to me with chicken. This is an awesome recipe with the cream of chicken soup. We've already had these many times and will continue to! :)

This was my first shot at making enchiladas, and I'm so impressed! Per other reviewers' suggestions, I doubled the recipe and had enough for 8 enchiladas/servings. I used one can of crm of mushroom, and 1 of crm of chicken. I also added a can of Rotel diced tomatoes, and threw in some cumin and chili powder as well.

Excellent!  Quick, easy, and a big hit with all seven of us!  I substituted cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of mushroom soup for a little more chicken taste.  Great recipe!

I doubled batch using leftover rotisserie chicken. Used 1 can each of Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Chicken, used a misture of cheddar and jack cheese and used 1/2 milk and 1/2 enchilada sauce. This is an incredible dish, and oh-so-fattening! Now if someone would just post a recipe for pork Carnitas!

This is a great receipe! I like most used cream of chicken.  Then I added lots of extras-we like vegies. I added mushrooms, green onions, two different kinds of peppers.  I also used enchilada sauce, salsa that I added into the sauce and hot sauce along wirh some cumin that I had on hand.  I made some vegi and some chicken.  They were outstanding.  I also used a package of taco seasoning with the chicken-sorta changed things a bit but we like things a bit spicey around here!  My family loved it.

I thought these were pretty good.  I think it's a little redundant to have the sauce both inside and outside the enchiladas, so I'd recommend doing something different on top--salsa, perhaps, or enchilada sauce.  Good as is, though.

I didn't like this recipe as much as I thought I would.  I made it exactly the way the recipe instructed, and it just seemed sort of bland to me.  My husband and son thought it was okay, but I don't think I'll be making it again.

I too substituted cream of chicken soup for the mushroom.  I also used very little of the green chilis (maybe 2 tsp) and lots more cheese.  Very quick & good.

After reading all the rave reviews I decided to try this.  I made my chicken the night before by using one lemon and one lime and seasoning lightly with chili powder and ground cumin.

It did not taste quite how I expected but I suspect it was because I used Mozz. and Chedd. cheese combinbed.  Next time I will use only cheddar.  

Also, I added a light drizzle of red enchilada sauce and used half the amount of chilies because one of our little ones is sensitive to spicy food.  The recipe was a real winner in our house!  The youngest seemed to enjoy it most of all.  We also have an elderly relative and it was great for her because she has problems with her dentures so I like to cook soft things that are tasty.

My only comment would be I had a hard time stretching the filling to fill all the shells.  Next time, I will use more chicken.

Really yummy!  I used the semi-drained can of Rotel and a half a can of green enchilada sauce in the sauce like someone else below.  My boyfriend really liked the enchiladas.  I served them with freshly made guacamole and salsa.  Yum!

This is a keeper. I've tried lots of creamy enchilladas and this is the best. My husband who isn't a fan of mexican food loved this and keeps asking me to make this over and over again. We had this 3 times in a row. I have to mention that the first batch I made was a little to dry and too tasty so I had to add more milk for the second batch and it turn out to perfect.

Enjoy,
shan

This was great! I added 1 tsp. of chili powder to the mix. I only reserved a small bit of the sauce for the top of the enchiladas after reading the reviews. I topped it off with part of a can of La Victoria enchilada sauce for more zest. Muy deliciosa!

I was more than a little disappointed after reading the reviews.  In all fairness, I omitted the green chiles, but this wasn't like enchiladas to me at all.  I could use more flavor and less richness (sour cream).  It wasn't bad, just a let down to those of us expecting something more flavorful.

These were great.  I agree with some of the other raters...they need a little more sauce on top.  But they were still delicious.

We really liked this a lot. I will definetely make it again although I did find it to be a bit time consuming. I added a can of Old El Paso Enchilada Sauce to the top of it before putting on the cheddar cheese and it made it VERY TASTY.

I made this recipe for the first time the other night, I was questioning how good this was going to be, boy was I surprised!  Loved this! Followed the recipe to a "T" and it was wonderful. Even my husband who does not like new dishes, ate two plates and requested the rest for dinner the next night.  Thank you.

Yummy!!  Next time I will double it though, because there was nothing left for lunch the next day!  My 14 year old son and nephew said that they were better than my red sauce enchiladas.

Tastes too much like canned soup - not Mexican enough. Would only make again if I had leftover chicken to use up. It was easy and quick.

I loved this recipe. I used cream of chicken instead of the mushroom soup.I also added a tsp of each, cumin & chili powder. I will make it again. I used canned chicken from Sam's. Next time I will double the recipe so there will be leftovers.

The recipe was pretty good, but kind of blah.  Definitely use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom.  Also, it needs a bit of a kick it you truly enjoy Mexican food.

These enchiladas are simply wonderful! So easy to make and my picky boyfriend (who hates anything with mushroom anything in it) absolutely loved it! We ended up making this twice in the same week because everyone loved it so much! If you have a big family to feed, you might want to double this, everyone comes back for seconds!

I finally found a recipe that lives up to all its great reviews!!  It was so good that I made it at home and 2 days later made it for my parents, sister and nieces.  They ALL loved it.  I personally would like a bit more spice, but with a 1 year old it's perfect just the way it is.  I sauteed some red pepper with the greend onion and butter for extra flavor and color.  I also added some cumin and green taco sauce.  This will be a regular dish in our household.

This was great, the whole family liked it.  The only thing I would change next time is try some sodium-reduced ingredients or maybe fresh garlic instead of garlic salt as I found it a bit too salty for my taste.

Overall, very good!  I think a little less of the sauce over the top would have been better - then the cheddar cheese would have been able to "crisp" over the enchiladas for a little more texture.  I'll make it again!

Thankyou for this recipe.  I have made this several times now and my husband and daughter love it.  I always use cream of chicken soup and usually add a can of green salsa and half of a hot pepper, which gives it some kick but my daughter can still eat it.  Thankyou!!

I also used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom. I used shredded thigh meat for the chicken. In addition, I added more cheese (at my husband's request) and eliminated--okay, FORGOT-- the milk. And they were GREAT!! Yum!

This was excellent! I made it for the first time for company and received rave reviews. I used cream of chicken soup rather than cream of mushroom.

I loved this recipe. I doubled it using 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken. I also used pepperjack cheese for a little more zing. I most definitely will make it again.

My family loved it.  But don't expect it to serve 6.  It tastes so good that you may only get 2 or 3 servings out of this recipe.

This is one of our favorite dishes - for just the two of us, or company. I use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, increase the cheese, and substitute plain yugurt for sour cream. What a hit. If you like black olives it is also tasty to add some to the sauce or serve them on top. Yummy!

Our kids love this as is. For the adults, I precook and shred the chicken, then cook with seasonings and a variety of chiles. I always use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. A great recipe!

Excellent recipe!! My folks loved it even my picky dad. my toddler ate some of the chicken which is better than nothing. I followed advice too and used low fat cream of chicken soup. but I also used non fat sour cream, nonfat sharp cheese n the middle and low fat shredded cheddar on the top. skim milk and low fat margarine too and you really cut the fat without losing taste! I added diced tomatoes with green chilies too. VERY yummy!!!

This is a great recipe that I have been making for years. I make it for my family and I have also made it for friends. Never any leftovers. The only changes I made was that I doubled the sauce.

Awesome! Like some people, I did add cumin, chile powder, garlic powder, one jalapeno, and a can of diced tomatoes with chilies.  I also recommend adding a little bit more milk to the sauce so that all tortillas get covered and don't dry out in the oven.

This recipe is awesome! Definitely substitute Cream of Chicken soup for the mushroom soup (I'm pretty sure thats what the original version of this recipe called for anyway).  The people who didn't like this probably used Cream of Mushroom or did something wrong because its a keeper!

I had never made enchiladas before and I tried this recipe.  This was an enormous hit at our house!!  I have made it twice so far.  I substituted colby/jack cheese instead of the cheddar and it added a little more zip to it.  I have shared this recipe to friends and they have made it and thought that it was fantastic too!

This is definitely our favorite recipe now!! The best part is that you don't need to run to the store for all the ingredients! Try shredding the chicken to give it a little different texture. Thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe!!!  :)

This was very good and very easy. I made some spicy for my husband and I and some more plain for the kids. They were a big hit and will definitely be a repeat.

I must be missing something.  I thought this was kind of mushy and gross.  And I always thought chicken enchiladas were made with corn tortillas and enchilada (red) sauce.  Anyway, I made this a while back but had to warn everyone after seeing the recipe again...  Not very good!

a mix with the flour tortillas.

Is missing some zest but is kid friendly.  A little more spice would be helpful or maybe a red sauce?!

More kid friendly without the green chiles. Don't forget to soften the tortillas in a pan before you fill them. Mushroom soup and sour cream can be substituted with enchilada sauce and sliced black olives can be added.

Our hats are off to you!  This was an absolutely amazing dish.  I have made this several times and my family can never get enough!  The only thing I changed was corn tortillas for flour and added a few more chilles.  But again it is delicious dish and I will make time and time again!

I've made this three times now!  I had always thought making enchiladas was hard so I never tried it until I found this recipe!  My husband and I do not like mushrooms so I substitued cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom and it was great!

This was absolutely FABULOUS!  Husband doesn't like enchiladas, but gobbled these up.  I used cream of chicken soup also, and added fresh sauted mushrooms as a topper.  Great recipe for left over roasted chicken.  Thanks so much!

These enchiladas were awesome! I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom and used half jalapenos and half green chiles for extra kick. I also added 1/4 tsp. each of cumin, cilantro and chili powder as suggested in earlier reviews. It was just great! My boyfriend just loved them. We had cheesy mexican rice on the side and it made a great meal. I only rolled 4 tortillas instead of 6 and they came out perfect!...Thanks for the great recipe.

As per other reviews, I added ground cumin and chili powder to kick it up a notch.  I also used enchilada sauce in place of the milk.  I recommend shredding the chicken as well.  Fabulous recipe.  Very rich and filling!  My husband liked this recipe much better than the famous Betty Crocker recipe!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!!!  I used cream of chicken instead of the mushroom soup, and next time will only modify the recipe slightly by adding some jalepenos for some added kick.  My husband said they were "the bomb".  The only bad thing about this recipe is no leftovers.

Pretty darn rich, but a nice recipe. Definately a repeater! Suggest thinning out with more milk or cream?  Worth trying! Tear the chicken, don't cut it, worth the added effort!

For my 7 yo who doesn't like onions, green chiles and cooked mushrooms, she really enjoyed this dish.  I was surprised at how good it really was with such unusal ingredients for enchiladas!  Thank you Steph

Fantastic recipe! I made these for my teens and their friends and doubled the recipe. The enchiladas were gone in a matter of minutes. They are so easy and so flavorful. I'm going to try and triple the next batch and see how they hold up to freezing. I preferred the mushroom soup. This recipe has added zest to my bland Maine cooking for my Texas husband. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful!!  These enchiladas easily passed the picky 2 year old test!  My little boy ate as much as I did.  I subsituted cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom soup and was very happy with the end result.  I will definatley make these again.

I hardly ever cook anything but this recipe sounded really good so I made it for a friend and myself. I used cream of chix soup and thought the original recipe should have called for it. We both love cheese, so I put 1/2 cup in the sauce mixture in addition to the cheese sprinkled on top. I also added 1/4 cup extra milk to the sauce since I added the extra cheese. Shredded chicken was important to me.

This a new family favorite . If you need to get a serving of vegetables in .... add a few handfulls of pre-washed chopped spinach .  I added spinach once as a way to used my leftover spinach ... but now my husband likes it better that way.  Yum !!

I'm generally not an enchilada person but decided to try these.  They were the best I've ever had!  I recommend to everyone to try these.  I took some of the others suggestions and used cream of chicken soup and added some cumin, chile powder and pepper.  This recipe is a keeper.

Very good, will make again.  My only complaint is that it wasn't spicy enough even with the green chiles in it.  Maybe I will add jalepeno's minced next time.

Easy and outstanding recipe! Great way to use leftover chicken. I also would advise to double this recipe to make the amount that is shown on the recipe. This will become a regular meal in our house. Tastes better then in the resturants. Thanx Steph!

My whole family loved it. My husband thought it was to die for. I think what made it extra good was the green onions and chiles. I thought it was very easy to make. We will be having this again soon!

Mmmmmmm... is all I can say.  My husband and I loved this recipe!  Great taste -- but not toooo hot!  I substituted regular onions for the green onions, sliced jalapenos for the green chiles, and added a tsp of chili powder -- still GREAT!  I could eat this every week!

This recipe was incredible!!!  I made it for a dinner party of nine people and they all requested the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was replace trhe mushroom soup with chicken and use half enchilada sauce for the soup so there was some tomato flavor.  I also added tomatoes to the chicken mixture and used sundried tomato tortillas!  Excellent!

This is a great recipe, I made it just the way Steph submitted it. Everyone loved it. But I see from the many reviews that you can make it with any number of variations and it still will be delicious. Thats what makes it such a special recipe to have. Thanks Steph!

I probably won't make this again.  Being from Texas, we have high standards for enchiladas...although, my husband did love them and wants them again...it just wasn't quite the flavor I was looking for.  But still very yummy!

Very tasty because of the mushroom soup and cheese mixture.  I prefer extra old cheddar so this is what I used in the recipe.  I will definetely  make this recipe again even for company. When served with all the trimmings..red rice..refried beans and cheese, jalapeno poppers as a appetizer...nachos and sangria...it will be a Mexican Fiesta supper for my guests.

This is a keeper!!  I did add 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and substituted cream of chicken for mushroom soup.  I bought an already cooked
grilled chicken and used the white meat (very easy)  I made it with Mexican rice and a basic salad.  Great dinner.

This recipe was great!! I read about 10 of the reviews and took some of their advice, doubled the recipe to fill the tortillas more and used 1/2 cream of mushroom and 1/2 cream of chicken. I used milk and not enchilada sauce and added the cumin, cayanne pepper and chili powder. It was EXCELLENT!! Brought them to a potluck at work and everyone loved them! You gotta try this recipe!

Everytime I make this recipe for my family, it gets RAVE reviews (including from my Aunt, who is Spanish). The only thing that I changed about the recipe to give it extra kick, was that I used half chedder and half swiss cheese.

I made this for company and everyone loved it. Even my picky kids enjoyed it. This is definitely a keeper. It's nice to have the creamy sauce as a change from what one might traditionally think of when preparing enchiladas. Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful flavor. We did all the substitutions suggested below, and were very happy with the result. I agree that the servings are off, this is a meal for 4 at most. And you will want the leftovers!

i have never used flour tortillas for enchiladas, and the "hispanic" in me was pleasantly surprised how tasty these were...must use this recipe over and over, but next time will add more "kick", and i also added all the cumin, chile powder, etc. delicioso!!!

Let me start off by saying that I am a 23 year old bachelor who usually sticks to cooking frozen pizzas and microwave dinners.  I brought this in the office for a Mexican potluck we were having and people went nuts over this.  Everyone wanted the recipe!!  This recipe is simple, quick, and absolutely tasty!!  I suggest that everyone try it.  I did spice up half of the dish with some jalapeno's and the sweetest of jalapeno really came through.

This recipe is great!  These are better than any enchiladas I've ever had in a resteraunt.
Do yourself a favor and add a tsp. of cumin and chile powder and substitute a can of enchilada
sauce for the milk.  I can not image enchiladas without enchilada sauce.  I also used a regular onion
instead of green onion and added some bell pepper. I used cream of chicken soup.  This will
definately become a family favorite.

Very rich recipe. Not for people who have problems with dairy. The bottoms of the tortilla shells became very hard and tough to cut through. We used a non-stick 9X11 cake type pan. Not a very traditional mexican flavor.

Awesome recipe.  I took the advice of some of the other reviews and used cream of chicken soup.  Superb!!!  I also substituted enchilada sauce for milk and it was still extemely creamy.  I still thinks it needs more kick so I will be adding more spices next time.  My husband has been talking about it for two weeks.  I will definately make this again.

My picky nonliking chicken husband really enjoyed this recipe and so did my 2 year old.  It was really easy to make and not time consuming. For something simple it tasted really good although I did not add the green onions or the green chiles.

I really liked the basis of this recipe.  However, I am a veggitarian so I used firm, baked Tofu instead of chicken.  I also added some "extras" of my own.  I added a bit of Cumin, chili powder and additional sour cream.  I think I would like to try using corn tortillas as well.  My husband said they were good enough to serve in a restaurant!  YUMMY!!!!!!

Please! With 80+ reviews, why wouldn't you try this recipe?  It is DELICIOUS!  I added some cumin and cayenne pepper to the sauce to spice it up a bit. Wonderful! I was asked for the recipe, and my husband said "Keep that one!"

This is a super recipe, quick and easy. A little blander that I expected, but very, very good. I will definately make this again adding a little salt and more garlic to the chicken. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

The whole family loved this.  I used Cream of Chicken soup, lowfat cheese and lite sour cream.  It was excellent with those changes.

0h my!  I love these.   My husband (who hates chicken) ate half the pan.   I have used both cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups.  Personally, I like cream of mushroom better.  It gives the cheese a wonderful flavor.  
This is on my meal rotation for good!

I used canned chix, cream of chix soup (as some of the reviewers suggested) and moistened my tortillas w/water before stuffing.  Was very tasty - even to the picky husband!  Thanks!!

I substituted cream of broccoli soup, worked out pretty good.  I also added some corn.  It needed more milk was a little dry.

AWSOME!  Very easy and even better as a leftover the next day.  I love cheese, so when we reheated it for leftovers I added alot more cheese.  Everyone loved it and it was so easy.  Thank You.

These were so easy to make.  It was not time consuming or complicated.  This is my new enchilada recipe.  I will never search for a chicken enchilada recipe again.

Great recipe! I made a few changes to suit our tastes--I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom, and added 1 can of enchilada sauce to the reserved sauce mixture instead of milk for a more hot and spicy sauce. These changes made these just right for us! The leftovers were excellent the next day too! I will definitely make these again!

My husband and I loved this.  I couldn't believe how tasty it was.  I will definitely make it again, but will probably try cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom next time.

I thought it tasted really good.  For the chicken, I used leftover Rotisserie Chicken that we had for dinner the night before from Safeway. Next time I will use less sour cream.

Good taste and easy to make.  Kids are really resistant to try new things so they were not crazy about them.  I would add a little more flavor and I feel like they need some enchilada sauce for that.

I didn't seem to have enough sauce to cover the enchiladas well so they kind of turned out dry.  I think I would like to add salsa.  They were pretty tasty though.

My family loves this one!  I have made it with canned chicken if I didn't have leftover, I have substituted a 10 oz. can of Ro-tel tomatoes with green chilies drained for the 4 oz. can of green chilies & used cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom soup...it still tasted great!  I have given the recipe to family & friends...all have loved it.

This was excellent.  We substituted fresh garlic for the garlic powder and added a dash of cayenne pepper to the sauce (for my husband) and a can of chopped black olives.  Delicious.
