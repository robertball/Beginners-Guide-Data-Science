I must add that cleaning chitterlings is a little more involved than removing specks, etc.  There is an inner lining that is translucent and must be removed prior to cooking, resulting in an end product has never been touched by the waste material that passed through the intestines.  Otherwise you cannot call them clean.

In regards to removing the lining, the submitter did not include that because you are starting with frozen "cleaned" chitterlings.  (See recipe above). The main lining (the most rubbery fatty layer) has already been removed. There are a few good brands.  But even though they have been "cleaned" I still go through every inch and remove any specks.  I also double check the lining just to make sure. A key step is to boil them after cleaning (I would boil at least 5 minutes) and then drain and start with fresh water. This will keep you from having to continuously skim the water (spooning and dumping any foamy grayish looking stuff that rises to the top of the boiling water), though there may still be a little skimming to do. Incidentally there is still another layer of lining that can be further separated leaving the chitterlings almost paper thin.  However I find that the final result is while tender, much too thin. You want them tender, but you want a feel like you are eating something. One more thing. Contamination/Illness can happen. Keep kids/babies out of the kitchen and wash hands/nails, counters, etc. thoroughly after handling (use bleach). The USDA even suggest boiling for 5 minutes before cleaning, to kill bacteria (will not change flavor). It also may help the cleaning go easier.

This is the way we've been cooking chitlins for years up North.  I didn't know we had a little Creole running through us!  This is a very tasty recipe. 
I'll add, keep rinsing the chits until the water is as clear as you can get it.

Basically, I like my chitlins plain...leave out the vinegar and extra spices...regular seasoning as long as they are clean is fine with me...touch not my chitlins and do my pork no harm--the Word.

I don't eat chitlins, but my daughter made these one year and everyone in the neighborhood raved about them. Said they were the best they ever had. And I guess cooking them this way reduced the smell in the house. Wich was a plus for me.

Chitlins are the best!! thanks for this recipe. In my family we only eat chitlins during the holidays and this is a great way to cook them with some added spice. Serve over some white rice and enjoy.

If you have not tried this recipe, then what are you waiting for?  Easy to follow...deelishus. This recipe is good, but my favorite is Down Home Chitterlings with a few revisions. See my review on Down Home Chitterlings.

I learned to clean chittlins from my grandmother she always chose the brand in the large red bucket and it took hours to clean them now that I prepare them in my own household I prefer to use Uncle Lou's brand super cleaned frozen chitterlings and this makes your preference of cleaning easier also I would like to add that there is less of a smell and more flavor when you add a touch of Allspice seasoning.

OMG! These were the best chitlins ever! This was my first time attempting them for our traditional New Years dinner. Since I come from a long line of excellant soul food cooks and want to pass along the tradition to my daughter, I wanted to put my best foot forward. I only cooked 10lbs. of chitlins, which is 1/2 of the recipe, but did not use bell pepper or bay leaf, but the chitlin turned out great. However, I cooked them for 7-8 hours -- I like them very tender -- and did not eat them until the next day, which I think played a big part in developing the flavor. This recipe is simple and will be added to my recipe collection for the upcoming New Years I am blessed to see!

I agree that simply removing a little fat with with specks does not equal clean chitlins....inner membrane must be removed...which is why they are considered a delicacy...cleaning them is time consuming .

This is my 2nd time in life making these.  Followed the recipe, didnt have a bay leaf.  Added 1 red pepper.  I must say that the prep time is definitely over 20 mins.  More like an hour.  I only did 5lbs.  Went grocery shopping yesterday, saw the chitterlings in the freezer section and decided to give it a try.  Initially I was going to give them to my mother to cook, but after finding this recipe, I decided to try it myself.  Now if I had to clean these back in the day when they weren't pre-cleaned???  We would NEVER have these.  Its alot of work! (Kudo's to mom)  Anyways,thanks for the recipe.  It was simple and straight to the point.  The hard work paid off.  Everyone enjoyed them.

I'm cooking this recipe now and OMG!!! the aroma alone has friends and family standing near the stove fanning the steam towards their face.  If daddy were alive I know he would wonder how did I get rid of the odor chitterlings are famous for, and second where did I get the recipe. This is gourmet!!!

Hi Nyghtsong.  New Year's Day my mother always prepared Chittlins as one of the meat dishes.  She went home to be with the Lord 4 years ago.   I want to feel close to her and will try this recipe and let you know.  Thanks for sharing as you never know who you are blessing!

I made these for the hubby this weekend (he hadn't had any in 10 years!). He could not stop eating them! I thought I had Creole seasoning but didn't, so I used seasoning salt and pepper instead. Fantastic! However, cleaning chitlins is not fun, lol Btw, I don't even eat chitilins and still managed to smoke this recipe! lol

This will be the 2nd time making chitterlings with the potatoe,and it actually cuts down on the smell,and doing a second or maybe third boil helps,adding the onion and bell pepper last prevents them from becoming too soft,and chili flakes make a huge difference...Thanks going to make a batch for Christmas...

I made chittlins for the first time New Year 2018 and will be making them the New Year. I can’t believe how good they were. The best I’ve ever had and I’ve had quite a bit lol! The only thing I did differently is I cooked them with chicken broth but followed the rest of the recipe.

I always like plain and simple recipes. I had an idea on how to make them just wasn't sure exactly how but this was the first and only recipe that caught my attention. I've never made them before because I don't like them but my husband loves them, so for my love for him I went in with love with these chitterlings. I always use vinegar in my cooking, I buy it by the gallons and that's what caught my eye was the process of the cleaning in the chitterlings so the smell doesn't whisp you away for air, well long story short he loved them and he said he was proud of me, so thank you for sharing your recipe, I love it! This is a keeper for me but now I don't need to look at the recipe because it's sooo easy to make. I didn't have  a potato at the time so that was the only thing I did not add to the recipe only because I didn't have it on hand but next time I will make it with the potato.

My family loved the dish. I made one alteration and that is after I parboiled the Chitterlings in water twice, I replaced the water with chicken broth to cook. Wow, A M A Z I N G!!!!!

Nice recipe only I boiled for two changes of water and then seasoned as I don't discard the trinity. I add a potato diced when just about done personal preference.

This was my first time making chitterlings, I don’t eat them...but my husband loved them. I’m definitely saving this as a favorite.

I've been making "chitlins" for years and never realized how bland my old recipe was until I tried this one. The highlight of my old "recipe" was the hot sauce that I drowned them in afterwards. While I still loves me some hot sauce, it is only optional with this recipe. I've made it twice, both times exactly as written except that I didn't actually measure any of the spices the 2nd time around and I left out the red pepper flakes because seeing them reminds me of some of the bits and pieces found in unclean chitterlings. I prefer offering it as a condiment.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!
