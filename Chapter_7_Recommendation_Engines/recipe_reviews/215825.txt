I am greek and this is the way to make spinach pie. however, sometimes the mix 1-2 eggs with spinach and cheese and it makes a difference. Other times, I saute dried onion and add anise or fennel and I add them to the mixture. Many times i do both,,,, Only reason i dont put 5 stars is because with home made fyllo is superb,,,,

I am also Greek and agree with the previous reviewer that adding eggs makes a difference. I usually dry the spinach by sauteing it slightly with onion and dill. Additionally I use much more feta as it adds a tangy flavor. If you are short on time, you can make the spinach mixture the day before and refrigerate it.

This recipe is delicious and you can make a double-batch and freeze it, and it's just as delicious from the freezer. I followed the Cooks Notes to make a double batch to freeze and it has saved me more than once when I needed a last-minute appetizer. The kiddos love it too!

After years of using recipes on here, I created an account just to review this! These were DELICIOUS. I made them for my sister who just had a baby and froze a batch for myself. They froze well and re-heated great. They were SO moist. The mozzarella cheese is a fantastic addition. 

It was my first time working with phyllo dough, so it took a little getting used to, but just follow the package directions. You have to keep the sheets moist that you aren't working with at the moment, but not too moist or they get gummy and unusable. 

2 things to note:  We cut the sheets of phyllo into 3 strips instead of 4. Found they were too small when we cut it into 4 and difficult to fold. The other thing is this recipe says to use unsalted butter between the sheets, but we didn't have any so we used salted. The phyllo dough package didn't specify so I think you would be fine with either.

DELICIOUS recipe, thanks for sharing!!!

Great recipe! I added about 1/4 cup extra feta, a little bit of hot pepper flake and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I omitted the salt because feta is already pretty salty. All my non-Greek friends couldn't get enough!! I was afraid they wouldn't like it, but they LOVED them!! Thanks!

I won't add my pic to this one since I didn't follow the directions very well and they turned out ugly ;)  Tasted so good though!!!  I forgot to take the pastry out of the freezer to thaw...and already had the cheese mix ready to go...so I let it thaw until it was somewhat workable...but it did keep breaking.  Anyway...they tasted great but didn't look great....next time I'll defrost the pastry!

AWESOME! The only problem was that it was too salty (I think because the feta is already pretty salty) so next time I won't add much. I went on Youtube to find a good video of how to fold them because it was my first time. After a few tries I got it figured out and they turned out perfectly. Everyone loved them and I'll make them again soon!

Do not change a thing! This recipe is perfect as is. Flaky, buttery.... just so very tasty. I want some right now. One thing though, make sure your phyllo is completely thawed before using it or it will crack and it's very difficult folding up cracked pieces of phyllo.

OK, I knew that phyllo can be a little tricky but once I got the hang of it, it was easy. Thought it was alittle too garlicy, even with just the one clove. I would definatley try it w/o the other cheeses and just stick to the tradition greek way of just feta.  Overall this was a success! Can't wait to make them for the holidays!

Fantastic recipe! I too added an egg and a few more seasonings. I've done this making the triangles but when in a hurry, rolling the phyllo up strudel style saves time. Bake it whole and slice when slightly cooled. Thank you!

Aside from the fact that it looked like a phyllo dough factory exploded in my kitchen, these were great! I did modify a little.. I used freh baby spinach instead of frozen. I chopped and sauteed them with garlic and onion until wilted. Once it cooled I drained it really well, added two eggs to the mix and then followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. Yes, it takes a little longer to make this my way but to me the flavor was totally worth it! This recipes is going to be one of my "go to's" from now on. A suggestion though... it's soooo much easier if you have two people doing this especially if you've never done it before. Otherwise, thanks for sharing such a GREAT recipe! Happy eating everyone :)

I love these, easy to make and tasty treats! I followed the advice of the Greek ladies and added egg to the mixture. The spanikopita was exactly as I remembered tasting before.

Good recipe, but I have some revisions. I've been making this for years, and I highly recommend using fresh spinach. I also only use feta cheese, about 2 cups. I believe people starting using other cheeses is to keep costs down. The only other things I put into my mix are 2 eggs, which as other users have attested really makes a difference, and a bundle of chopped scallions.

If you are in a hurry, or simply don't feel like making the traditional triangular pieces. you can cook in a 9X13 baking dish. The filo dough should fit without any cutting. Layer the dough, buttering between each. I do 20 layers, then filling, then 20 more, buttering between again. Baking time and temperature remain the same. Hope this helps!

This was fabulous. I added some additions as per readers advice. Sauteed onions and garlic in oilve oil. In same pan I added the two packages of defrosted spinach after I squeezed out the excess liquid.Then added 1/4 teaspoon of fresh nutmeg.
This recipe made 40 pices. Very time consuming to assemble so make before hand if you plan on this for company. Freezes terrrific.

My 12 year-old daughter made these herself and they were spectacular.  I didn't have unsalted butter, so she used salted, which made it a bit too salty.  Next time we'll follow the recipe exactly.

I added 2 eggs & put in about 1.5 c feta (no mozz or parm), and threw in some extra seasoning -- a little nutmeg, some dried onion, oregano, etc.  And I rolled them up into little "cigars".  Very yummy!

My Mom always finds making Spamikopita very tedious. She asked me for this recipe since it was so easy!  I took them to a potluck and have no clue where they went!

Delicious; does take some time to prepare though.  I used frozen chopped creamed spinach and also added some bits of bacon to the mixture; bacon was cooked, drained and then added.

These were unbelievable.  I followed the recipe as written and the suggestions of other reviewers and added 2 large eggs and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the mixture.  It was my first time working with phyllo dough.  Not the easiest thing in the world but definitely worth it.  I agree with another reviewer who said the process is much easier with 2 people.  Everyone loved these.  I also just used garlic powder instead of minced garlic and left out the salt because feta is plenty salty on its own and the flavor was amazing.

5 with pretty much the same changes everyone else made: I made half a batch so added 1 egg. Doubled the feta and added onion.I was lazy and did not make triangles....for a small family for dinner I made half the filling and just layered the phyllo and spinach in 4 layers in a small casserole dish. Family loved it.

Excellent.  They take about 40 minutes to cook when frozen.

I used fresh mixed greens (chard, kale, spinach) sauteed lightly with onion.  I also added more feta and left out the salt as per a previous review.

Tastes great, but I'm unable to do a decent job rolling out the dough.

This is ok.  Next time I will use cooked fresh spinach- it would make a huge improvement in taste.  Tip: Don't try to make a full proper triangle on your first "turn" of the phyllo dough; you can add much more filling if you make a psuedo pita pocket the first turn.  Subsequent turns will create a full triangle so no filling falls out.  

The best thing about this recipe is SnappySpoons' process - you can put any filling into this and have it turn out good.  For example, at the end, I ran out of the spinach mixture I halved the recipe and did not have feta so increased the amount of the other cheeses.  The filling needed some zip and was dryer than expected.  I sauteed the garlic prior to using.

These are amazing! I omitted the salt and added one egg, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.   So flaky and delicious!

This is a delicious recipe as is. It is very simple, and you could even make it simpler by only doing feta cheese. You can't go wrong with spinach, phyllo, feta, and butter. Done deal.

Adding in the parm/mozz adds dimension, which is nice. As other reviewers have said, adding an egg would help with binding and creaminess. You could sautee the garlic before hand with onions before adding to the mixture. Definitely don't skip the step of thoroughly draining your spinach (I like to put in flour sack towel and twist until you can't get any more liquid to come out). It makes a HUGE difference in the end result.

I also don't know how you get by with just 1/2 cup butter. You need to put a lot of butter. I ended up using 2 sticks+ by the end of it, and it made 20 triangles. I also stuffed a bit more spinach mixture in each to make them fatter (2 tbsp instead of 1). The phyllo can handle it if it's well buttered.

But it's delish plain and simple too. You don't always need elaborate recipes, so this one is great as is.

I made this and followed the recipe for once in my life.  They were really good but I felt like it needed a little something.  Not sure what, but something.  I will read through the comments and see if I can get some ideas.  I did see where some were saying they were difficult but I didn't find them to be that hard. I made them while I waited for the Moussaka to bake.  I will be making them again but I'm sure I will be tweaking things next time.

Wonderful recipe.  I have made this several times, the last several changing it a little solely due to my daughter's dietary restrictions.  Rather than using butter I substituted olive oil, using a dispenser so I didn't have to use a brush between the layers.  I also reduced the amount of cheese a bit and increased the spinach.  My entire family LOVED it!!  They have asked me to keep making it that way.

I'm Serbian and this is one of the main foods we make several times a month. I followed this recipe with a difference of adding one or two eggs in the spinach mixture. When time permits I make my own Philo dough.

Made this last night, did not use the Parmesan or the mozzarella but used more feta, and grated some nutmeg in as well. No need for the salt with the salty feta. I used fresh spinach chopped finely to which I added the egg, minced garlic and onion. Used a couple phyllo sheets laid flat, more filling, folding the sides up and fold like a nice present brushed with butter. Cook on parchment paper, ready in 20 minutes....was AWESOME with a greek salad on the side.
** make sure your phyllo is thawed prior, is already finicky to work with.

I consider myself a novice cook, but  I had to try it because Chicago is 2 hrs away.   It came out wonderful. As with other comments add eggs in the mix ,  saute onion and had to have fresh Dill.  Loved it and I normally hate cooked spinach.  Its a nice treat for my whole family .  Everyone wants some.

It was really good! I ended up only needing 1/2 of the package of phyllo. Not sure why that is, maybe I stuffed them too full? Regardless, it was very good.

Great recipe, my first time making spanikopita and a huge success!  Delicious, easy to assemble and look fantastic to serve!  The phyllo dough is a little tricky to work with, especially after you brush it with the butter but the results are more than worth the time and attention!

Awesome recipe!  The mixture for the filling is fantastic!  Very tasty and not too salty or greasy.  

I used an easier method (see below) by using full phyllo sheets:

Variation: Butter a 9 by 13 inch baking pan, and spread 6 sheets of filo, brushing each with butter, on the bottom. Spoon the spinach filling over the filo, then cover with 6 more sheets of filo, buttering each sheet. Score the top 3 sheets with a sharp knife. Bake 40 to 45 minutes, or until top is golden, let stand 15 minutes, then cut into squares and serve warm.

I LOVE this recipe!  I added one egg to the filling, just like alot of people mentioned.  I also cut the feta down a bit since my mother doesn't care for very salty foods.  They are labor-intensive, but absolutely amazing!  They even seem to stay crispy after re-heating.

This was amazing and easy. I did add an egg to the mixture as other suggested. I think it helped. I also did not fold them into rectangles but just rolled them like egg rolls. It was much easier and they still turned out great.

Ok, I've made this recipe about 5 times so far and it's been a hit every single time! I make it pretty much as written with one small adjustment. I add more garlic than it calls for, about 5 cloves, as pretty much everyone I serve them to loves garlic. The phyllo dough is, of course, a pain to work with, but the delicious, buttery reward is definitly worth the frustration you might feel.

Soooo yummy.  Made it with salted butter and fresh spinach (cooked it) because that's all we had.  Salty, buttery, and crunchy - I'd make it again, even for my Greek relatives.  None left!

I used regular phyllo dough from the frozen section and two packages of fresh spinach (boiled down and drained).  The recipe was delicious as is but next time I will try adding half of a cooked, chopped onion.  I used to add onion to my Spanikopita recipe and it was delicous. Overall, very simple and a delicious side dish or appetizer!

I couldn't find a spanakopita I really liked but this was great - I think it was the mozzarella and parmesan. The extra cheese gave it a well rounded flavor that even the kids enjoyed who don't really like spinach.
