This recipe is really over powered by the dill but I added salt and pepper to taste and it made the dish a lot better.

I found this dish confusing.  The directions are fine, but the ingredients seem to be fighting each other.  For my taste the raisin and walnut flavors are too sweet to work with the dill and cucumber.  Then what does one do with it.  Is it a sauce?  A solo dish? A dipping sauce?  I finally picked the raisins and nuts out and used the rest in mashed potatoes.  That was quite good.

This "Iranian Yogurt Dish" is a regional variation of "mast-o-khiar."  For those who don't know, a yoghurt dish like this is typically served on top of steamed basmati rice along side of grilled kebabs, although this particular recipe is not common. It is far more usual to make a yoghurt sauce with yogurt and wild garlic (mast-o-moosir), or yogurt, cucumbers, and mint (mast-o-khiar), or most commonly to serve plain yoghurt as an accompaniment to rice. Each person gets their own 3-ounce cup of yoghurt, and some people eat it directly out of the cup. Also, it is very usual for Iranians to cook with very large quantities of herbs, so you may need to adjust this recipe to your own taste (there is nothing wrong with the quantities of herbs stated in the recipe). You could make this recipe with Greek yoghurt which is closer to the 13% fat yoghurt sold in Iran (instead of using sour cream, as used in this recipe, as they don't actually have sour cream in Iran). Thank you for sharing your recipe.
