I have quite a bit to say about these...they are excellent, my husband and I couldn't stop eating them, both the dough and the cooked cookies. They are tender, just the right amount of sweet flavor, and are buttery, even though I didn't use real butter, but instead used margarine, like the recipe called for.Don't soften the margarine before you make them (the recipe DOES NOT say to, but a lot of cookie recipes do, so I just wanted to note that).  Also, to cut down on the stickiness of the dough, I recommend chilling the dough a bit, but not too long (just until it is no longer extremely sticky).  I made one batch before I chilled it, and more after and the batch before the chilling spread out more and were a little flatter and maintained their chewy centers better.  I would not recommend cooking them for 15 minutes; they will be WAY over done.  I cooked mine for 9-10 min and did not allow them to brown at all.  Then I left them on the cookie sheet before taking them off to finish cooking a little more. I recommend these highly and will make them again!  I especially liked that they did not need to be rolled...who has time for that?

I have a small dessert business & frequently make sugar cookies (plain, frosted, etc.).  This recipe is always a hit with clients who want a true chewy sugar cookie.  I always use soften butter to make the cookies-the taste is incredible.  When I double the recipe, I usually add 1-2 extra tbsp of flour (depending on the humidity). Also, I have found that chilling the dough for 1-2 hours, or even overnight, prevents the cookies from flattening out.  Clients really like when the cookies are rolled in a sugar/cinnamon combo--very yummmy.

Excellent and easy cookie recipe.  I was curious to see how this cookie would be because of the range of ratings from one star to five.  As promised, the cookies turned out crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside.  If you are looking for a "all-over" chewy cookie (not crisp at all and more soft) then this recipe is NOT for you.  Also, if you are looking for a sugar cookie to roll and cut-out, this may not be the recipe.  The dough is awfully sticky.

I did change a couple of things:  I used butter instead of margarine and after the first batch I quit rolling them in the sugar (it was too sweet for me!)  Otherwise, the cookies turned out deliciously buttery and the texture is still the same on the second day.  Good tips from others:  if the dough is too sticky to handle, refrigerate it.  My only beef is that the cookies are fairly thin; this recipe would be even better with if it produced a super thick chewy, crispy sugar cookie.

These cookies are wonderful and very tasty. Please take my advise however. First, try to use butter instead of margarine.  The second is that these cookies need about 1/2 cup extra of flour. That will give you a total of 3 1/4 cups of flour. The first time I made them, they came out flat. I was very surprised that more people didn't comment on this issue, but I promise that my advise will give you the best cookie. :)

ok, somehow I deleted my first review for these cookies...
basically all I said was that these are really good, I have tried a lot of sugar cookie recipes and these are among the top two, the other one being Cracked Sugar Cookies I. These are nice and soft. Make sure you don't cook them too long, they are done when you just start to see a little color, kind of a yellowish color, but very slight, don't worry they will harden! The dough and the cookies themselves taste kind of like the Break 'n Bake that you can buy in the grocery stores! So, thanks so much, Cindy!
It's been a couple of weeks since I posted the above statements--I made both this recipe and Cracked sugar cookies I and compared them. I took one bite of one and then one bite of the other--this is definently the best sugar cookie recipe I have EVER tasted. There is no lack of flavor, these are so awesome! They look good, taste good. You don't even need frosting. They kind of remind me of Sugar Cookies that you can buy at Subway. I just want to encourage anyone looking for a chewy, soft, yummy sugar cookie to TRY THIS RECIPE!!!!! 
I give these ************************* 25 stars!!!! I wonder what they would be like with white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts???? I might try that...if I do, I'll let you know...

THESE WERE THE BEST SUGAR COOKIES EVER!!!!!!! I think they taste the BEST when JUST baked... so I keep the dough in a container and everytime I make them I just use the dough.. itz REALLY easy too. Also.. I added 1 teaspoon of corn starch. I do this to my chocolate chip cookies too.. it makes the cookies more crunchy on the outside and chewy in the inside. :)

This was exactly what I was looking for!  They were perfectly brown around the edges and soft and chewy in the middle.  I could have eaten the whole batch if everyone else didn't chow on them!  I froze a dozen balls and baked them a week later straight from the freezer into the oven.  They were even better!!  Great recipe!  Will become one of my standbys!

Followed receipe exactly, ended up with runny batter that turned into extremely thin, stuck to the pan mess.  I followed ingredients and instruction list exactly.

Yummy!  Great recipe.  I made them with slightly less sugar and then my mother, my sister, and I frosted them with storebought icing for Halloween.  They had a great flavor.

Oh yeah, I made them with butter instead of margarine and here's why: There's no use pretending that using margarine instead of butter will provide more than a negligible difference in nutrition.  In fact, there's no use in pretending that cookies with as much sugar as these have are at all nutritious.  No, they're a treat.  A fattening, bad for you treat, but a great-tasting one.  And butter just tastes better!  :&)

I'm sorry, but I agree with the negative comments.  These were awful, and I mean awful.  Nothing was good about them.  The batter was thin, like cake batter, and chilling didn't help a bit.  I finally spooned it onto the cookie sheet.  Baked the recommended amount of time.  They came out perfectly flat, stuck to the cookie sheet, and the taste was awful.  Just so you'll know, I've been baking since I was 6, some 38 years now, so it's not as if I were a novice baker and did something wrong.  At the same time, I made another recipe from this board which professed to be chewy sugar cookies, and they were all I could have hoped for.  I'd be interested to see if anyone has any idea about why these have turned out so dreadfully for some of us.

These were the absolute best sugar cookies I've ever eaten.  I doubt I'll be convinced to even try another recipe again!  On my air-bake pan, they looked professional,thin, perfectly round and beautiful.  On an older, darker cookie sheet, they were a little thicker and they browned around the edges, but even after we'd eaten all of them, we still couldn't decide which were better.  Definitely try this one!

I have tried this recipe for the second time and I followed it to the T. I made the mistake at first of not using all purpose flour and they came out really flat. I have found out also that it is better to use hand blend the dry ingredients in with the margarine. The recipe says "gradually stir in the dry ingredients until just blended". You must follow that direction. The first time I blended it electrically and I believe that was also a mistake. I just tried this recipe today and WOW! What a difference. They came out perfect and tasted great. Hands down 5 stars and I hope my mistakes was helpful to you because this recipe makes some good addicting cookies

The days of rolling and cutting sugar cookies are over! These are the PERFECT cookie. Just as described....golden crispy edges with soft chewy centers. My kids (9,6,3) helped make them...They are child-proof as well. I think next time I might try adding the almond extract or lemon and some vanilla frosting or glaze. You cant go wrong with these.

This is now my favorite cookie recipe. I am living overseas right now and made these cookies as an example of something sweet we eat in America and everyone just loved them! The only thing I did differently was to add an additional 1\4 cup of flour.

Great tasting cookies! The only adjustment that, in my opinion, is absolutly necessary for this recipe is to add almost 1 cup more flour than it calls for. I made the recipe to the "T", and the first batch spread like crazy! So I added about another cup of flour, and PERFECTION!  =)

I didn't care for these so much because they were a little on the flat and greasy side. But I would have bet my life that Hubs would love them, because they were a little on the flat and greasy side. (And because I frosted them generously with Sugar Cookie Frosting, also from this site, even tho' in my mind they didn't need any frosting at all - yes, because they were a little on the flat and greasy side). So I held off on my review until he tried one.  He instantly remarked that they were chewier than usual, so the cookie definitely lives up to its name.  I thought they were a little on the sweet side, but Hubs said these were the kind of cookie he could eat until he got sick, his highest form of compliment.

If you want the cookie to turn out perfectly crispy on the outside, perfectly chewy on the inside, that don't flatten out and have that pretty cookie "crackle" on top, then bake at 375 deg. for 10 min. I found out by accident... I only had enough dough for 5 cookies, and baked them with my chocolate chip cookies. Perfect! Other than the temp and time, and use butter instead of margarine, I wouldn't change a thing!

These cookies did spread a lot, but were chewy and delicious.  I made mine into two logs that I refrigerated and cut into 1/2-inch slices and froze so I could bake a few at a time as desired.

i just made a batch of these, and they are the best sugar cookies ive ever had from anywhere! im a very harsh critic when it comes to cookies, and these really are amazing. the only thing i did differently was omit the baking soda because i am at a high altitude (just an fyi for fellow high altitude bakers, i do this with every cake or cookie recipe since we are up so high and i always get perfect results).  thank you for such a great recipe!

This was my first time making sugar cookies from scratch and OMG! they are so delicious. I did substitute the flour with whole wheat all purpose flour and used 1 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also ran out of margarine so i only used 1/2 cup and the rest was unsalted butter. The dough was more moist and sticky than i thought it would be so it was hard to roll at first but after being in the refrigerator a little while it was much easier. Also it made A LOT of cookies. the recipe says it makes 30 but i got about 50 out of it so if you arent making them for a crowd you may want to cut it in half.

I followed the recipe as is. I wouldn't change a single thing. They turned out exactly the way I wanted them -- crisp along the edges and chewy in the middle. This is the perfect sugar cookie recipe.

Wow!!!  I have been searching for a fantastic sugar cookie recipe for two years.  Everything I've tried has been just OK, including several of the other sugar cookie recipes from this sight.  Delicious and SO easy to make!  I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening.  These are sooo good you don't even need frosting.  If you have been looking for a great sugar cookie recipe but are always disappointed, try this one!

Absolutely awesome taste. However, don't even try to roll out the dough and use cookie cutters.  The dough is way too sticky for that. Once I managed to get some cut out, they all lost their shape upon baking anyway.  So, I stuck to rolling them in balls.  I added the sugar cookie frosting from this site and sprinkles and they were a huge hit at a holiday church party.

These were amazing! Small changes: 1) I used 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp of real almond extract. The almond extract was a GREAT addition, but not necessary. 2) I rolled them in vanilla sugar after  making my first batch. Vanilla sugar can be made by placing dry vanilla beans (new or used) in a canister of sugar and allowing to sit at least a week. 3) I used real butter (half salted, and half unsalted because it was what I had). 4) I softened my butter, and apparently that is not necessary. The dough was almost too fragile to handle, but became easier to handle as it sat/cooled. 5) My balls were about the size of small limes, or donut holes - not walnuts. I could fit up to 7 balls on my round ceramic cookie/pizza stone. The cookies turned out BIG like at the fancy bakeries (made 28 BIG cookies). I baked them for about 12 minutes but began to watch them closely after 10 minutes. By far the BEST sugar cookies I have had - ever. I am sure they would be good w/ no changes at all to the recipe.

I love this cookie.  It turns out great every time.  This recipe has so many possibilities, I added lemon zest and substituted vanilla extract with lemon extract and it made a great lemon cookie.

This is a very good cookie! I tried it plain, with cinnamon sugar, with lemon peel and with orange peel and they were all wonderful. They are true to word, crispy and chewy. It made about 40 for me. They do get a little crumbly, but overall a delicious cookie! Recommended!

I made these for a coworker of my husband's and am embarrassed to give them to her.  Did everything as directed, with the exception of adding 1/2 tsp of almond extract in addition to the vanilla.  Oh, and I baked them at 400 for a more pleasant presentation.  Otherwise they spread out SO far and had no texture to look at. sorry

I MUST SAY AFTER TRYING OTHER SUGAR COOKIE RECIPES, THAT ALL CAME OUT TOO FLOURY, THIS ONE WAS THE ONE! GREAT CHEWY COOKIES! I DID USE BUTTER INSTEAD OF MARGERINE, AND I ADDED ABOUT 1/2C MORE SUGAR TO MAKE SURE IT WASNT TO FLOURY TASTING, PERFECT! THEY DID LOOK UNCOOKED AT THE 10MIN MARK BUT LEAVE ON THE PAN FOR 5MIN AS SAID AND THEY LOOK BEAUTIFULL! THE DOUGH WAS NOT STICKY AND AND THE COOKIES DID NOT STICK TO THE PAN AS SOME SAY. THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!

These cookies are GREAT!!  You need to be sure and follow the recipe exactly.  Originally, the recipe posted called for baking POWDER and that's all I've ever used and they've been GREAT! I've tried the "ammended" version using baking SODA instead, but we like it much better with baking POWDER. Thanks for the "mistake"!! :) Here are a few tips that I've found make a huge difference in the way they turn out.  USE ONLY UNSALTED BUTTER (not margarine) and WHITE LILY FLOUR.  If they don't have White Lily flour where you are then use the best top quality brand flour you can find. Believe me, these two tips make the difference in a GREAT cookie and a good cookie!  Refrigerate the dough for 30 mins. or more before you make them for ease in handling and to keep them from spreading too thin.  Place the balls about 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart also helps to keep them from spreading too thin.  Don't overcook them.  Bake ONLY 8-10 mins. until SOME EDGES start to get slightly golden and center no longer appears "raw".  They will be pale in color if you don't use any baking soda.  Also don't overcrowd your oven when baking - be sure there is a little space between and around your cookie sheets if you put in more than one at a time or the bottoms will burn. I learned that from experience! Thanks again for the great recipe!

This was a good cookie.   I always do a test cookie to see if they are going to spread too much, and they did a bit.  I added about 1/2 cup more flour and they were just right.  Nice flavor, good chew.  I used the dough to make 8 inch "pizza"cookies for my daughter's birthday party.  They were well enjoyed.

I was looking for a chewy sugar cookie recipe that I could use with cookie cutters, to make chewy heart-shaped cookies for Valentine’s Day. (Most recipes that can be used with cookie cutters are for harder, crispy cookies.) To make the dough less gooey and easier to work with, I made the following changes: I added a half-cup of flour, and reduced the amounts of fat and sugar, meaning I used a total of 3 1/4 cup of flour, 3/4 cup butter (I didn’t have any margarine) and 1 3/4 cup sugar. I then refrigerated the dough for three hours. When I took it out, it was actually too firm for me to roll, but after a few minutes at room temperature, it was fine. I rolled the dough to 1/3 inch thick and used my cookie cutter (if you roll it until it is thinner than 1/3 inch, the cookies will be crispy - the thicker, the chewier). I did grease my cookie sheet, even though the recipe says not to, and baked them for 9 minutes. What I got were chewy, slightly puffy cookies that were definitely heart-shaped. The cookies did expand a little, but they mostly kept their shape, looked great, and tasted even better! They were definitely sweet and buttery enough. Will do again!

These cookies were really FLAT. The dough was good but the cookies were not that great. I do not think there was nearly enogh flower and there was way to much sugar. I will try these again and increase the flour and decrease the sugar. Thanks for the recipe.

Not only was this a quick and very easy recipe, the cookies are absolutely delicious! Bet you can't eat just one. I did, however, substitute butter for the margarine.  Butter makes things taste so much better. This one is definately a keeper! It's nice to be able to roll the cookies in different colors of sugar for the holidays. My friends and family couldn't get enough of them.  Thank you for sharing!!

for the folks with runny thin dough: if you use a tub margarine remember it has lots and lots of water in it. try using a stick margarine or just use real butter. that should take care of the messy thin dough and leave ya with a great cookie.

These are VERY good. Crispy outside.. soft inside. Instead of rolling them in sugar, I sprinkled a little cinnamon on them before baking. Love the chewy softness of the inside. =)

Awesome cross between a sugar cookie and a snickerdoodle (if you add cinnamon to the rolling sugar like the poster suggested).  Followed the recipe but with butter instead of margarine.  Crisp edges and chewy middle.  I don't know what they'll be like the next day...if any make to see another day..but the texture is fantastic right off the cooling rack.

This is my go-to recipe from this point on. I made a couple of changes for my taste: I used 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp lemon extract, and softened butter in lieu of margarine. Excellent cookies and exactly what I was after.

so yummmy!! perfect chewy, flat cookie. I used butter and they flattened out quite a bit, but that's how I like my cookies. My bf likes chocolate, so on a few of them, I put some milk chocolate chips on top of the cookie when they came out of the oven. These were really good too. I'll definitely make these again!

These cookies taste great! I made them as snickerdoodles and rolled them in cinnamon and sugar.
I made a few modifications to my second batch because the first was too flat and hard to get off my air bake sheets.
I added an extra 1/2 cup flour and chilled the dough fully before baking. Also I removed the cookies from the sheet right away and had a much easier time. They also needed 15 minutes to bake. The cookies came out a tad thicker but I still would like them to be thicker still. The search continues for the perfect sugar cookie!

Oh my, I ate 3 of these shortly after they came out of the oven!  I think I like them better than the Blue Ribbon recipe also from this site.  I ran out of regular flour and used self-rising flour, so I reduced the baking powder by half.  Great recipe.

Very good. I decreased the Qty to make sure this is what I was looking for. I added a little more sugar & used Criso butter flavored shortening instead of margarine. Next time I'll use self rising flour maybe.

I made these twice just in case I did something wrong the first time. The batter was very watery. There is an aftertaste with these cookies that's hard to put your finger on. Even my daughter didn't like them, and she loves all cookies.

These were great!  I had to add more flour because the dough consistency was off. (might have been how I measured the flour... I always seem to have a hard time with that.) They turned out great!  I rolled them in colored sugar (red & green) because they were for a Christmas party.  A very easy way to make them look festive.  I see great potential for other holidays.  Red & Pink Valentines day, Pastels for Easter and so on.

These are delicious!  After my cookies cooled, I drizzled melted dark chocolate candy melt across the top of each one and placed them in the fridge until the chocolate hardened.  Yummy!

Amazing cookies that I've made time and time again. My friends are always asking for me to make cookies and this is one of the favorites. I've had kids stop me in the hall asking, "When are you going to make more cookies, Kenzie?" Thanks so much, they're a hit and so am I!

I had the same problem many of the one-star reviewers had: flat, runny cookies that didn't resemble cookies at all once baked. I had even refrigerated it for an hour. I added a cup of flour after the first batch tanked and they ended up being okay (though they had a heavy egg taste). I have to wonder if the runny cookies are a result of high altitude, using a hand mixer or possibly having the margarine too soft.

I was very dissatisfied with this recipe. My cookies turned out flat and gooey in the middle. I would never use this recipe again and I would NEVER recommend it to anyone else. I wasted a lot of time and a lot of ingredient.

Perfect recipe for people who forget they have stuff in the oven!  I had three pans of cookies, and popped the first two in, then left to do a "quick" e-mail check.  FORTY MINUTES LATER, I remembered I had cookies in the oven!  I pulled them out, and they were rock hard.  I figured I would crumble them later.  The next day, they were PERFECT.  Soft in the middle and crispy on the outside.  The third pan, which I watched, tasted every bit as delicious as the one I forgot, but of course I didn't have to wait a day to eat it.  This is my new fave sugar cookie recipe!  Thanks so much for this fool-proof cookie!

These were delicious! I used real butter instead of margarine, but they were still sooo good. Just make sure they don't brown, and they'll stay nice and chewy.

I would give this a 10 for the flavor, but two things: 1)way too much margarine! I would call them butter cookies instead of sugar cookies! I was really doubting when I saw the recipe called for that much margarine.I could feel my hands oily as I ate them, if you suffer from high choloesterol stay away!
2) my first batch came as others, paper thin flat. I fixed this by adding lots of flour until they felt just right to roll between my hands. The solution to thin flat cookies is therefore more flour! Do not bake your cookies if they dough feels too sticky, it's a recipe for disaster!

Followed recipe exactly- cookies ended up very flat and stuck to the pan.  I had to scrape it off of the pan and eat the small pieces.  The dough was yummy though.  I had high hopes for these cookies. . .I may try again with a few modications.

Yummm!!! Was in the mood for something sweet and had all the ingredients to make these... so easy! Brought the extras in to work and they were gone instantly! Some reviewers complained that the cookies came out flat...this didn't happen to mine, but can sometimes happen if you microwave the butter before mixing.

These cookies are simply fantastic! My family loves them! I did tweak the recipe a little though. I used 2 cups all-purpose and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour- the wheat flour gave it an extra sweet flavor. Reduced sugar to 1 1/3 cup and used real butter. Also, used brown sugar instead of white for the decoration and baked for 10min; I like a little crunch with some chewiness. These cookies came out wonderful!

This recipe was awesome, and fortunately it worked out really well for me with a few slight modifications. I used 3 full cups of flour instead of 2 and 3/4, and I used butter instead of margarine. I baked the cookies for 11-12 minutes instead of 8-10, and I added 3/4 of a bag of M&M baking bits. They turned out crispy around the edges and chewy in the center. No problems with runny batter or cookies running into each other on the sheet. My dough scoops were about half a large spoonful, and I got 70 cookies out of it.

These are the best sugar cookies I have ever tasted! I did decrease the butter to 1 cup and they were still fairly greasy, and could have maybe used a little less butter even. But really yummy. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside! Santa's gonna love these!

The dough was delicious but they turned out terrible for me. As some said earlier, the dough was so terribly sticky we could barely roll it out. We had to refigerate it first and then pour flour in our hands. Even then it was impossible. They came out cakey and bland. I don't think we will use this recipe again. Maybe it's personal preference? It could be that I used margarine instead of butter. Who knows... I am glad some people liked it.

These cookies were a hit at my office's monthly birthday celebration.  I changed the recipe though. Instead of margarine, i used shortening.  For the sugar, I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  And I rolled the balls of dough in cinnamon and sugar.  I never knew thin sugar cookies could be so good!!

Finally! A cookie with the perfect texture -- crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle.  I used real butter instead of margarine and substituted a 1/2 teaspoon almond extract for some of the vanilla.

These cookies are really good.  I like the fact that there are no odd ingredients in the receipe.  I also like the fact that you can make a homemade sugar cookie without rolling and cutting.  I used butter flavor Crisco instead of margarine and the dough was nice and firm.  I didn't have to chill it prior to working with it like other users stated.  The 15 minute baking time was right on the money.  Very easy and very good!

Absolutely, hands down, the most delicious, totally fool proof cookie recipe I've ever used. I use this recipe for snickerdoodles and they're just delicious. All you do is roll the dough balls in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar and wala! I tried making regular sugar cookies with this recipe (without the cinnamon and sugar) and they were still a hit but not nearly as big as the snickerdoodle version. They're our favorite cookie!

My family loves these. The only change in the recipe I made was using butter instead of margarine, which I always swap it with any recipe I make. I also refrigerated the dough a few hours to let the dough harden, I tried it without refrigerating and while they tasted good they spread too much and weren't chewy. Refrigerating them helps them not spread. They are a bit crispy on the  edges and perfectly chewy on the inside. A lot of people talking about how bad the dough was some even saying runny, I don't know if the difference is margarine but even when I made the dough and didn't chill it, it wasn't a problem at all.

These are truly the best sugar cookie I have ever eaten.. that crispy edge with the chewy center are heavenly... 80 calories per cookie but worth the price for such a great cookie.. I would rate higher if I could.. This is a simple recipe and yields 5 dozen cookies.  You most likely have all the ingredients on hand.. and I will make again and try that suggestion to use almond extract..

The flavor was great and it was chewy, but super flat. The problem that I had was the dough was goey and sticky. I followed the recipe. This is the 2nd time I make it and it comes out goey and sticky again. I think it might of been that I beat it to long. Another thing is I put the dough on a non-stick tray it burned, and it got stuck. The 2nd time I put Pam(which is the butter spray, prevents from food sticking to the pan) on the non stick tray and dusted it off with flour and it didn't stick nor it burned. My 2 year old daughter loves to bake and she wanted to make sugar cookies. The 1st batch we did, she said it was too sweet, because we rolled it into a 1/4 cup of sugar. 2nd batch we did was awesome in flavor. We left out the 1/4 cup of sugar. Instead, we sprinkled it on top of the cookie. I am going to try again and hopefully it does not come out goey, sticking to my fingers. Going to beat it less this time. Thanks for this recipe.

I think the recipe should read 1 1/4 sticks of margarine not cups.  My cookies ran all together and off the pan.  Tried next pan with smaller blobs of dough further apart.  Same thing happened. One and a quarter cups of butter is 2 and a half sticks.  I had to throw everything away.  Such a waste of butter.

This is my go-to recipe for sugar cookies! Although I always have to add a lot more flour to the dough to be able to roll it into balls and prevent it from sticking to my hands and the pan. You can't beat this recipe though for flavor and texture (once you get the flour ratio right). I usually add about an extra half cup of flour.

These are my great grandma's recipe for sugar cookies, although she used a combination of crisco and butter. They are chewy on the inside, just as promised, and crispy on the outside. They literally melt in your mouth. Add some butter frosting, and you are in heaven! I love to freeze them and they taste great just out of the freezer too. Crispy and delicious. Thank you!

This an awesome cookie recipe...I made some changes...I added 1/4 cup flour...I replaced some on the vanilla with 1/4 teaspoon almond extract..baked for ten minutes @ 380 degrees..the most important part of this recipe is do not over mix the dough..I added the flour mixture gradually and mixed with a fork...I refrigerated the dough for about a hour...I have been looking for the ultimate cookie recipe for the holidays this one is on my list

good recipe. the only thing that upset me was the lack of chewiness that was stated in the recipe. i also think it could have used a tad bit more of sugar. however, with some frosting on top, it was very tasty.

When I baked these, they literally spilled over each other into a solid, liquidlike mass and spilled over the edge of the baking sheet. Judging by the other reviews, however, I must have done something wrong? I'm not sure - I followed the recipe exactly (other than substituting butter for margarine, but that's never made a difference in the cooking I've done so far). Any suggestions?

These TASTE delicious. I'm giving them a 4 because had I not added 1/4 cup of flour (3 cups total) they definitely would have been too thin. As others suggested, refrigerate the dough first to help them not get to flat. OH, and I used real butter, of course! :) I would make them again.

Made these as macaroons and they were a hit. Used splenda for baking to lower the calorie content.

I have to agree that this batter came out to the consistency of cake batter. I had to do some tweaking and add at least an additional cup of flower and another quarter cup sugar as well as almond extract to adjust the flavor.

Delicous. I recently tried the no- roll sugar cookies and they just didnt turn out for me. So tonight I tried these and they were awesome. And heres the catch. After I had already started making these I discoverd that I had no eggs. I didnt want to waste my stuff so I just threw them in the oven any way. I suprised they came out. Im keeping this one.

Wonderful cookies. I didn't know margarine and butter were 2 different things :/ I just used melted better. Turned out PERFECT. It made so many cookies, probably more than 30, and there's only 5 left now! Beware of the expansion of the cookies after you put them in the oven though...It expands way more than you'd think.

First of all, I must admit that I didn’t follow the recipe.  I used butter instead of margarine.  I just love a buttery cookie.  However, these cookies came out totally flat.  I loved the taste.  But, I got little pancakes.  What can I do to keep these cookies from going flat?  HELP!!!

These are super yummy, but a warning! You have to wait until they cool otherwise they have a tendensy to fall in the middle, or rip and then they're no longer pretty! Make sure to cooke them well enough too! Don't Burn the cookies, but they need to be cooked enough or they rip apart. Also, when I made them they spreaded out quite a bit, so make sure you give them enough room to move around! They go well with frosting, but make sure that it's not too sweet of a frosting, otherwise the sweetness over shadows the butteryness of the cookie! Sprinkles too :3 Good Luck!

easy  tasty recipe...I did not roll the dough in the sugar, I sprinkled on top.  Placed cookie dough in the refrigerator for aprox 30 min and it was easier to work with.

Second sugar cookie recipe I have tried using margarine.....both were a complete failure! This turns out a mix that is far too runny to form any type of ball out of. After modifying (quite a bit) with flour and sugar I was able to get something that "was almost" a cookie. Waste of flour, sugar, time...etc. Sorry but it is just not good if followed by the numbers.

I could not get enough of these.   They were so delicious.  Made several batches including one with wheat flour.  Those had an even better crispy texture.  I also used real butter.

I used butter, not margarine and they turned out great. Margarine has a lot of water in it and would probably make them more "cakey". These turned out just like the Sugar Butter Cookies I used to get at Original Cookie Co. I've been wanting that recipe for years. Definitely one of my favorite cookie recipes.

I'm assuming that I should have used sticks of margarine instead of margarine from a tub.  The dough was too sticky to roll.  I dropped by spoonful and baked and they stuck horribly to the pan.  The ones I could get off the pan had the consistency of cake, not cookie.  I will try this recipe again using butter instead.

My first attempt at this was a total failure and I read through and saw that I was not the only one to end up with cake batter instead of cookie dough.  However... I made a small change and tried again and they turned out perfect!  The change?  The first time I used margarine from a tub, the second time I used sticks just barely softened!

My favorite cookies!  Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I always use butter, I love the flavor.  I make the dough ahead of time, roll the dough into a tube, wrap in plastic wrap and leave in the fridge.  When I'm ready to bake I just slice the dough and bake.  I think the two most important things to remember are to chill the dough for at least and hour or two and not to bake too long.   You really have to take them out before you think they are done.  This keeps the dough from spreading too much and gives you a soft, moist cookie.

I had such high hopes for these cookies after seeing so many positive reviews. The dough was more like batter and was so so sticky, there was no way I would roll it into anything let alone a ball, even after letting it cool in the fridge. The first batch just ran all together, stuck horribly to the pan, and burnt on the bottom before the top was done...although I think that has more to do with my crappy oven than anything else.  The second batch turned out a little better...I put the dough in the freezer to try and harden and used parchment paper. The taste wasn't bad, although I tasted more egg than anything else. I don't think I will be making these again  :(

What a great, basic recipe.  Although I added a bit of coffee, they weren't this exact recipe but it was PERFECT.  You can eat these plain, or add your favorite cookie ingredients...  Chewy yet fluffy.  Yummy in the tummy.

Used this recipe to make a "giant" cookie (14 inches) for a birthday party.  It turned out great and everyone loved it!  It was crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and tasted delicious.  I used all butter and baked it on a pizza pan for 40 minutes.  I also used pure vanilla extract and almond extract (50/50).  It's the sugar cookie recipe I will use from now on.  Thanks CindyAnn for sharing it.

I cut out 1/4 cup of flour because I seem to be cursed with dry, crumbly sugar cookies -- otherwise I did everything the same. I did not roll them in sugar or frost them, I think they'd be too sweet if I had.  I am happy to say that for once they turned out delicious! They taste similar to the break-and-bake cookies. I made them into giant cookies and my roommates and I cannot stop going to the cookie jar.   My only complaint is they are kind of extremely flat but this could be due both to my cutting down the amount of flour and melting to the butter which is never a good idea unless it's called for!

I just finished baking these.  This is the first time I've ever made sugar cookies and they turned out well.  I did add an extra 1/2 cup flour to the recipe and refrigerated the dough for about 3 hours.  I had no problems with the dough being too sticky.  I had to bake them for 12 minutes though since I have to adjust my oven temperature down all the time.  They did spread out but weren't too thin.  I had no problems getting them off the cookie sheet even though I didn't let them sit 5 more minutes.  My husband says he's normally not big on sugar cookies but that he could eat a lot of these!

OK. I gave this 4 stars because I tweaked it a bit. I didn't have enough butter so I only used 1/2 cup of butter (softened) and I added an extra egg and OMG these were amazing.. They tasted just like Ms. Fields sugar cookies but better!! So so good. I loved them! I will make again but I think I will stick with my altered version!!! Thank you!

I have tried this recipe and I found that the Margarine will make the dough flat and really oily. Plus the dough is too soft to work with. I had to put mine in the fridge for the whole day before I can use it. I would probably recommend that you use butter instead of margarine. It is way firmer and easier to form the walnut shape.

These cookies are soooo yummy.... I started out baking them for 8 minutes, but they were way too chewy (falling apart) So I ended up baking for 10 minutes. (We are in Colorado, so that might make a differance with the altitude) I I also frosted these for an extra Halloween touch! The kids loved them.....

Haha wow my cookies are big (a little to much dough)! Anyway, wow what a great sugar cookie! I thought it was just me at first when my dough was very sticky but after I added a little more flour and cooled it in the fridge it was much better to handle! But if you don't mind getting your hands sticky, "stick with the sticky dough", they bake just as well!

I've made this recipe a few times now, with different variations. The first time was a complete disaster and they came out like little cakes. They didn't spread at ALL. But I realised I must have put too much flour in by mistake. The second time was perfection! I usually do one of two variations: 1. maple extract instead of vanilla and add white chocolate chips just before the flour. 2. Sprinkle nutmeg on the top. I've never rolled them in sugar. I think that'd be too sweet.

I love these.  This is the kind of sugar cookie I like--buttery and chewy.  Even better with an almond icing on them.

Thanks for the recipe.

BEST sugar cookies I have ever made! I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for Cream of Tartar because I didn't have any, and I found this one.

I baked the cookies 9 minutes (pay close attention to the time so they don't get overdone) and I used butter instead of margarine, since that was all I had. 

I rolled the cookies into tight balls and pressed down on them gently when I put them on the cookie sheet.

They came out PERFECTLY! Round, thick and golden. Everyone loved them - They were the best sugar cookies I have ever made! :-)

Delicious... I made them just as the recipe said.  I'm still a beginner so I didn't change anything.  They were still chewy even a few days later.  I baked them for my 2nd grade class and they LOVED them.  Kid and husband pleasers :)

I made a batch of these cookies to take to my in-laws house.  I made half of the batch with vanilla extract as written, the other half with lemon and vanilla extract.  The flavor and chewiness was excellent on both batches, but they flattened out and ran together and didn't look good enough to bring along. I gave them to my roommate and he ate them up at least.  I might try to make them again just because they were so chewy.

These cookies are delicious! I was craving something sweet and had all the ingredients in my kitchen. I halved the recipe, and they're perfect. Not too sweet, just sweet enough. And they're so nice and crispy on the outside and chewy inside. I baked them for just 8 minutes. They didn't look done, but the edges were slightly brown. Definitely a keeper. Thank you!

i used butter (hate margarine) and added in a bit of almond extract. they. were. PERFECT. i've stopped looking for my perfect base cookie--and look forward to dressing this one up! (2009)
********
I've apparently been making this cookie for nine years, and I still love it. Really good rolled in whatever spices you like best (cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom..) and if you melt the butter even partially they're extra-chewy. (2015)

The dough and cookies tasted good, but the fat (I used butter) in the recipe is too much.  It was crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  These cookies come out really flat, and instead of rolling I dropped them by using a cookie scoop. Overall it was good, but I'll lower the fat content to 1 cup.

I made these for Christmas.  My husband loved them and could not get enough of them.  We added colored sugar to the tops.  We also tried rolling them in cinnamon sugar.  I would refrigerate them before rolling out, just to give the dough a firmer consistency.

These were all right, but they didn't have that store bought (ie, Soft Batch Sugar Cookies) flavor I was looking for.  I have looked and looked for a recipe that imitates those, but everyone so far I have found comes up way short. In comparison of other recipes for sugar cookies this one is easy, and doesn't give you bricks.  I probably won't make them again anytime soon as I will continue my hunt for Soft Batch Sugar Cookies.  I can't even find them in the store anymore.  What's up with that?

This recipes was yummy, I added 1 tsp, cinnamon to the flour mixture, and rolled the cookies in sugar and cinnamon before baking. *I love Snickerdoodles* the cookies turned out yummy, but a little thick and cakey. Still delicious though, I had to cook them a couple extra minutes, I would recommend these to a cakey cookie lover!

These cookies had a yummy flavor and were soft and moist. My only complaint is that when you're done mixing the ingredients, chill for an hour. Otherwise it runs flat. Also grease your cookie sheet really good because they do stick to your sheet.

Yes, it was easy, but my cookies turned out awful and i followed the recipe perfectly.  They were flat and not tasty.  I dont know what happened, but after reading the recipes I was very disappointed in how they turned out.  There is NO WAY i could have rolled that dough... I added flour, refrigerated... nothing thickened them.  They stuck to the pan VERY badly as well.

I made these cookies a couple of days ago, and at first, I thought they were marvelous! Unfortunately, after two days they became very crumbly and not very chewy at all. I stored them in an airtight container, so I'm not sure what caused them to fall apart when you bite into them. They still taste wonderfully, but you have to eat them over a napkin!

These are the best sugar cookies ever!!! I followed the recipe exactly except I added some almond extract and I doubled the recipe. I don't know what the person did below my review because mine were extraordinary!! My family and friends all agree. These will disappear in no time. I did use stick margarine and not the stuff from the tub. Definitely try this one.

I followed this recipe exactly, and they did not turn out right for me.  The cookies got very flat and spread while baking.  They also left a very weird feeling in my mouth after eating.  The flavor was ok, but I wouldn't make them again.

The dough was sticky.  I had to refrigerate for 30 min. to get it firm and I still wasn't able to roll it into sugar.  It took about 15 min to bake too.  I substituted 3/4 whole wheat flour and they tasted great.  If you like them a little cripy on the outside then don't store in plastic bags, it makes them chewy.

This recipe did work well for snickerdoodles. (All of the other snickerdoodles
recipes called for cream of tartar. Like I have that in my pantry!) If I can make
it, it must be easy! One mistake that turned out well - if you make the dough
balls larger than described, you'll get big (but flat), soft, chewy cookies.

OMG GREAT! I only had 1 egg so I split the recipe in half. I was just experimenting. Substituted  unsalted Kerrygold butter (don't like margerine) and it was smooth perfect light butter taste. I will be making these for the holidays and instead of half will doulble the recipe. My grandkids will love this!

I'm sorry but this was bad, I had to add more then 2 cups more flour to get even close to a cookie dough and by that time it was just a bunch of sticky flour.

These cookies are pretty good. Simple, soft, and super chewy. If you are going for a crispy outside and soft inside I would leave the cookies in the oven longer than the suggested time. I will agree the batter is a bit "runny'er" than normal, however it did not take away from the overall taste of the cookies. I used a generous ammount of flower at the bottom of the baking sheet to prevent them from sticking too bad, that seemed to work well. 

*SIDE NOTE: I made a delicious mistake by accidently adding 1 tsp of bannan extract (I thought it was the vanilla extract at first), I realized it was the wrong extract and then added 1 1/2 tsps of vanilla extract (instead of 2 tsp). I also used a white sugar and cinnamon mixture for the cookie toppings at the end. They turned out amaaazing. My husband said they tasted like bannana pudding snickerdoodle cookies. Give it a try :) *

I LOVE this recipe. It was the first one I've ever tried and it will definitely be the last. This is my go to recipe for moist, chewy, buttery sugar cookies with a slight crunch on the outside. I've never made sugar cookies before and I was feeling a little adventurous...especially since I didn't have any butter or margarine. I made the following changes: 1. Instead of margarine, I used shortening. 2. Instead of 2 cups of sugar, I used 
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. 3. Instead of 2 tsp vanilla , I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp almond extract. 4. I added 1 tsp of butter extract to get the butter flavor and lastly, I lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper. I used a hand mixer and the dough came out perfectly. I used a small dough scoop to measure out 30 amazing cookies. No problems with runny or sticky dough and the cookies did not stick to the parchment. Rolled the dough balls in the large sugar granules (like you see in bakeries), and barely pressed them down so they stayed the perfect chewy thickness. Cooked them for 10 minutes and took them out BEFORE they browned, yet passed the toothpick test. These are better than Lofthouse. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe that made me feel so proud when my experimentation actually turned out deliciously divine. I will definitely make these again! This recipe is a keeper! It will now be the family recipe to be shared and passed down to future generations.

This is a great cookie recipe!  I substituted non salted butter for the margarine and took the advise of one of the reviews and added an additional 1/2 cup of flour.  I chilled the dough and used an ice cream scoop (small) to make the cookies, flatten the center and rolled in the sugar.  Excellent, excellent, excellent!  This is now a part of my holiday cookie rotation!

I was looking for a quick but yummy sugar cookie to make for my son who requested them.  We were so happy with the results.  These cookies are perfect in every way.  Simple, delicious, chewy and crispy. My teenage son, husband and his friend all raved about them!  Beat any store cookie they were asking for earlier in the day when I offered to bake some. :)   5 stars for sure!  I did make a quick small change since I had limited time:  I used a cookie scoop to shape dough straight onto baking sheet, then simply sprinkled on a cinnamon sugar blend to each cookie drop.  It turned out beautifully.  Thanks again for this wonderful recipe!!  Just exactly what I was looking for!

These are the best non-cutout  sugar cookies. My sister thought they were store bought because of the perfect shape. They do taste like the Subway sugar cookies as one of the other reviews suggested. I rolled in colored sugar and added sprinkles to some. I could not stop eating these cookie.  You won't be disappointed.

i followed the recipe exactly, except i used butter and since it was salted butter, i only put a tiny bit of salt in them.also, i soften the butter a lot before i mix it with the sugar. they're fantastic sugar cookies and they make 36 when i do them, and i make them sorta big. i don't know how peoples cookies are coming out really flat? i don't flatten them a ton when i put them on the pan. maybe try putting a little more flour in them, they do come out thin but i like them that was lol.

I made these cookies for the 4th of July! I'm a nanny and it was a fun and easy activity to do with the little girl I watch. Some of the cookies came out raw so I had to keep putting them back in. I rolled them in red, white, and blue sugar that I bought from the store that day. I cut the ingredients in half because 30 cookies were not necessary.

These cookies have WAY too much butter in them. I could literally taste and smell the butter!!! The dough was hard to work with and the cookies needed hours to harden up after coming out of the oven, at first they were soft and falling apart.  Apart from that they had an OK flavor

I made this recipe and absolutely loved it! The cookies were crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. So happy with the result. My fellow co-workers just ate them up at the company pot luck. I do have a question though...is there a way to substitute coconut oil for the butter/margarine? If so what would the ratio be? I have a friend who can't have dairy at all...even a small amount could make her super ill. Suggestions would be awesome!! Thank you again for a great recipe.

I tried these for the first time tonight. Apart from running into issues with my measuring cups not being washed properly (facepalm) these were relatively simple. I added some extra vanilla, because my family like it that way, but even that was not enough moisture to make the dough as sticky as it was. I had to add an extra scoop of flour and then I still could have added another one but I got bored and instead of rolling into balls I scooped with a teaspoon and plopped onto the baking tray. (I also greased the baking tray with Spray and Cook so they didn't stick). My only issue, besides sticky dough, was that I placed the balls too close together so when they expanded they expanded into each other and cooked as a 'mush' with indentations where they should be cut into circles. This meant that the edges of the cookies in the middle weren't crispy, but everything was cook perfectly. This recipe was very easy to follow and I am glad I found it.

I love this variety of sugar cookie. I had to use butter flavored Crisco cuz i didn't have butter, and i added the 7.5 tsp of water recommended with that substitution. I chilled the dough for easy handling,  and rolled the balls in cinnamon sugar. Much better than my   old snickerdoodle recipe. I highly   recommend these chewy little gems!

These are great and my parents love them.  Only thing to add is that my city is at 3,800 ft and so it takes my cookies about 30 minutes in the oven before they get crispy on the edges and soft and thoroughly cooked on the inside.  But great recipe!

These cookies are AMAZING. We almost ate all the dough, but they were absolutely gone the night I made them. The dough is sticky, but let it sit in the fridge before you roll it and between batches and you shouldn't have a problem.

A five star keeper recipe for me! My favorite part is that I always have all ingredients on hand. I use cold butter (rather than margerine) straight from the refrigerator- I love that I don't have to plan ahead & put butter out to soften!  My first batch came out of the oven totally flattened & smashed up against each other, and that was with the recommended 2" spacing.  I had to cut them apart, but the kids didn't mind, because the cookies were huge!  After that I sized the dough ball down- more hard boiled egg yolk sized- and I left even more space between each ball on the cookie sheet. These were a better size cookie for us, but were still fairly flat. Flat, but picture perfect and excellent texture. I may try adding an extra TBS of flour or two the next time I make them, and I will make them again- Yum! Easy! Great flavor! I found that 11 minutes was perfect in my oven.  For those of you who had trouble with the cookies sticking to the pan, you MUST remove them when they are still warm. Use a thin metal spatula and transfer them to a wire rack about 3 minutes after they come out of the oven.  If they cool on the cookie sheet, they will crumble and break when you try to transfer them. (For one of the pans I got distracted and let them sit too long...The crumbs still taste great though!) Try these!  You will love them!

I used this recipe for my son's bake sale at school.  Used shortening instead of butter, and they tasted great. Making another batch today with pumpkin spice mixed with sugar, for a kicked up snickerdoodle.

Great recipe! It's not the type of sugar cookies you can cut into different shapes, however it has the same flavour with extra chewiness. These stayed soft and delicious for days, and I made some snicker doodles out of them that are just as tasty!

My family LOVED em! I used butter instead. And like a dummy I put the full 2 1/4 cup of sugar and they turned out perfect! Didn't even have to chill the dough. And they weren't sticky at all. And also didn't soften the butter. So if u had an issue with super sticky dough, just throw in that extra 1/4 cup of sugar!??

The cookies melted out to almost paper thin when baking. I even followed the reviews already posted and used chilled margarine and when the batter was mixed I chilled for 5 hours. Baked at 350 and the cookies baked terribly. The taste was more like a butter cookie and they were very dense. Not chewy and fluffy like a good sugar cookie is! Looking for another recipe for future baking.

The dough was  not thick enough to roll with my hand it was more like frosting texture. They did work out well thou just dropping them onto the cookie sheet. I used about half a cup less sugar than what the recipe called for and added none on the cookies, I prefer my sweets not so sweet. The did turn out a bit thin but I wouldn't say flat. Overall we all enjoyed them. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I will use this recipe again. Oh and I baked them on parchment paper which I'm glad if not I think they may have stuck a bit.

I have tried MANY sugar cookie recipes and this is BY FAR the best I have ever had in regards to texture and taste. When I bring them any type of party or gathering, they fly off the tray. The only thing I've decided not to do is to roll the dough balls in the sugar before baking (personally it's too sweet). Thank you x 1384589734 for posting this recipe!

This recipe was AMAZING! The cookies came out perfect and they tasted great. The little bit of a crunch but a chewy inside gave it the perfect taste. The time was a little off for the cooking it is more like 10 to 12 minutes, not 8 to 10. It may have been my oven, but they came out with the perfect sugar cookie taste.

I did exactly what it said and couldn't be able to roll the dough at all. It was way to runny that I ended up adding more flour.  Will try to look for another recipe.

This recipe rocks. I put the extra sugar for decoration in a tupperware bowl, add a couple of drops of food color (shake it up to distribute evenly), drop the balls of dough in the sugar and coat all over before baking. That little extra bit of sugar caramelization on the bottoms really add to the depth of flavor and the colors are fun to coordinate with events. You will need an extra 1/4 cup of sugar for decoration though. If you use organic vanilla extract like I do, you already know how much better they taste; if not, get yourself the real deal, organically grown extracts. When I use lemon, I split the 2 teaspoons with the vanilla, so 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp lemon; same goes for almond but I've not tried others.

I used a toaster oven for this and the recipe was great. I thought it was too sweet and my mom did also so I had to add more salt then needed... Tbh the eggs, I thought was I little too much so I had to add more flour :/

OMG, I added crushed up candy canes to mine for Christmas cookies, and they are soooooo good!!! You just mix them in at the end when you are adding the flour mixture.  My boyfriend says he has to wonder if there is a better cookie!!! (and he LOVES cookies).  Even I, who typically hate peppermint, loved these!!! You can't eat just one!

Excellent sugar cookies.  A couple of things I would note.   I added vanilla for a bit more flavor and used real butter (softened) not margarine.  I also used Hudson Cream Flour which I swear by for baked goods because it's milled finer.  You can find it at any Walmart.  I would also recommend using a stand mixer to beat your eggs, butter and sugar really light and fluffy before adding flour.  I made the dough beforehand and refrigerated it overnight.  The dough was stiff, but I formed it in a ball and then flattened it out a bit on the cookie sheet.  I love to sprinkle them with Penzey's Vietnamese Extra Fancy cinnamon before baking.  If you haven't discovered Penzey's spices yet, www.penzeys.com, you're in for a treat.  You'll never go back to store bought cinnamon again.

For taste, I give these 5 stars. For presentation, I'd say they're a 3 star cookie. I used butter instead of margarine. I also used 1 tsp almond extract and 1 tsp vanilla extract. My biggest complaint is that the cookies came out extremely flat. I think they'd have been thicker had i added more flour. I saw someone else suggested refrigerating the dough. Maybe that would help? I'm not sure. Either way, if you're looking for cookies that taste good, these are them. If you're looking for something to take to a cookie exchange, I'd pass. :)

If you actually know what you are doing in the kitchen then these should come out great, these sugar cookies are defiantly the best sugar cookie recipe I've tried and I experiment with cookies a lot. They are the perfect combo between chewy and crispy thanks for the recipe

To make these perfect, use 1 cup margarine.

Also, when mixing the wet ingredients, beat them with a beater for about 5 minutes, but when mixing the wet and dry, mix by hand until it is just mixed. Make sure you don't have liquidy batter left on the bottom.

If you did it properly, the finished batter should taste a lot like vanilla icing.

If you cook them until they are just barely turning brown on the edges, they will be soft and chewy on the inside(not under cooked), and slightly crispy on the outside.

I made this as directed,(except rolling in the sugar, they were sweet enough) but honestly I wished I would have taken the advise of the other posters and added more flour. What I got was a cookie that spread out and was so thin you could practically see through it. For that I give it 3 stars. But the taste......totally gets a 5. Really a tasty and true to its name cookie. 4 days after making them and they are still chewy and just as fresh tasting. 4 stars overall. I will make them again.

I was having the same problem with the cookies going flat so I changed it a little bit. Increased the flour to three cups, used two sticks of butter instead of margarine, and added a teaspoon of baking powder. Also, I keep the dough chilled in the fridge in between batches. They tasted too good to give up on this recipe! They are still a thinner cookie but now that puffed them a little more which is all I was looking to do and everyone loves it when I make them :)

Save a step and eat the dough. I couldn't have rolled them if my life depended on it. So I used a melon baller to scoop the drippy mix onto a cookie sheet. Baked for 12-14 minutes. Would classify them as somewhat of a solid with a borderline thick liquid middle. I am thinking Santa's cookies won't even be able to hold frosting tonight

These are excellent!  I can't stand hard cookies and these are nice and chewy!  I used butter instead of margarine as that's what I had on hand.  I stuck M & M's in some and made some plain (did not roll in extra sugar).  I actually liked the plain ones better! I have been searching for a yummy, chewy sugar cookie that tastes like the refrigerated dough roll at the supermarket, but is homemade. They do flatten out A LOT and next time, I will try chilling the dough to see if that helps. Despite this, I will definitely make these again and again. They stayed chewy the next day and did not harden up.

I wish I could give this recipe 100 stars.  This is the best sugar cookie I have ever had in my life.  I will NEVER use another recipe for sugar cookies ever again.  I made just one small change.  Instead of 2 tsp vanilla extract, I used 1 and added 1 tsp lemon extract.  It gave it just the right hint of lemon.  I also did not roll in extra sugar.  I used butter, not margarine (guess I made more than 1 change :/.  The butter should be at ROOM TEMP for the best mixture and I let the eggs get to room temp too.   I made sure to leave the cookies on the cookie sheet when they came out of the oven for 5 minutes and it does make a difference.  Throw away all of your sugar cookie recipes - this is the best one you will ever find!

Best cookie I ever made. It was so easy and came out yummy! My kids loved them! I was a little worried because the dough came out more like batter and was really runny. But I think that was my fault because I creamed the sugar and butter too long! I will defintly keep this recipe for later use! Thank you!

Good flavor but they were not chewy! I did not over cook them.  I baked them till they were barely tan on the bottom. However, they were crunchy. will not bake again.

AWESOME!! Made as directed. I just had to bake them longer then called for in the recipe. Thanks for sharing. This is a keeper. You can make these cookies thick and chewy by placing them closer together. They come out kinda square because the come together while baking,but yummy. Just cut along the lines to separate the cookies.If you bake them far a part and kinda flatten them they come out thin and crisp.

Awesome Recipe! I have tried several sugar cookie recipes over the years & this is by far my favorite. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe. The only thing I did different was adding icing on top. Very good, chewy, moist recipe!

Made these for the coming Valentines Day to give as gifts. They turned out perfect! I added an extra 1/2 c flour, as I wanted to roll and cut the dough. Refrigerated overnight. The dough was a dream to work with. It does spread a little so probably not the greatest dough for intricate cookie cutters. (I used hearts!) Or try adding more flour than an extra 1/2 c. This dough can be versatile. Roll thicker for softer cookies and thinner for crispy ones. They taste really good "plain", but some icing or sugar on top sure doesnt hurt! Would definately make again!

I added an extra 3/4 cup of flour and rolled my cookies in cinnamon sugar. OH MY GOSH, THESE ARE THE MOST DELICIOUS COOKIES EVER! Very chewy with a slightly crisp outside :)

Fabulous recipe - especially for a sugar cookie-first timer! Followed it to the point and it turned out fantastic! The dough from the first batch I made turned out as a little bit drier, likely because the butter had not yet reached room temperature before blending. At the butter got warmer, the batches got better and better! To keep in the Christmas mood, I dipped the top of the dough balls in red/green sugars before baking and it turned out PERFECTLY! A big hit among my friends, family and coworkers!

OMGosh! Best recipe ever. I've tried many other recipes claiming that there soft and chewy and nothing. Decided to make these yesterday but rolled them in cinnamon sugar and they were to die for. My hubby loves them. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe. ;o)

Wow. It's Christmas Eve and I just made these with my kids. They were easy and delicious. We had a wonderful time together, too. I substituted softened butter for the margarine, and only used 2 sticks instead of 2 1/2 and that was plenty. We also added some sprinkles to the sugar we rolled them in, and they look beautiful. Mmmmm!!! My daughter says they are the yummiest cookies ever.

Okay... as someone who normally isn't very good at making anything truly delicious in the kitchen, this recipe turned out amazing! I followed it to a "tee" and read a few of the suggestions of others below and it turned out so great. Here are the tips I took from others and put into practice: 

1. Don't melt the margarine or leave it out to room temperature. I went with a very basic, inexpensive soft margarine and it worked perfectly. I made sure it was refrigerated before use. 
2. Chill the dough before cooking. I stuck it in the freezer for about 20-30 minutes before using it. It helped it come out a little plumper. I imagine that refrigerating it overnight may be even better, but I didn't have the time. 
3. Don't overcook them. I cooked mine a total of about 13 minutes, or until it was a light golden brown on the edges. If you wait too long, they turn out very crunchy and don't have the chewy center and savory taste that we all love.
TIP: I rolled the dough in cinnamon sugar and then sprinkled a little bit more on the top when I took them out of the oven. They were a huge success!

One of my favorite (well actually my favorite) sugar cookie recipes of all time. It comes out sooo chewy and moist. I made mine with 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup grapefruit/basil curd. Delish!

All I can say is....OMG!!  These were so awesome and way better than the ones in the store that you cut off the log!!!  The only thing I changed was that I used real butter, and boy, did that make such a difference.  They were crisp around the edge with a chewy center, just totally awesome!!   Congrats to CindyAnn.

This is an excellent recipe.  The first time I made this recipe, I struggled.  The batter was tough to deal with because my beat was not up to par, it even died after finished mixing all of the ingredients.  The cookies did not spread they stayed in balls.  It was a disaster.So, my husband got me a great Kitchen Aide mixing system. Then, I tried the cookies again, they came out great.  Chewy mad perfect.  I followed the recipe to the tee.  I did not freeze my dough.  I dropped my cookies with a baby scooper so the would all be the same size. Also, I followed a Martha Stewart tip by taking a drinking glass and dipping the bottom in water and pressing on the dropped cookies.  I am ecstatic about the results.

These turned out wonderful!  I rolled them in cinnamon sugar and they baked up very nicely. They are great warm with a cold glass of milk! I will definitely be making this recipe again. I am going to try frosting them and will see how they turn out that way as well!

Not good!  I will just start off by being honest and telling you I'm not an expert cook/baker by any means.  Definitely a beginner.  But I thought - how hard could sugar cookies possibly be?  Well, apparently pretty darn hard.  OMG - this recipe did not make anything resembling dough.  It was a runny, sticky, mess.   I kept looking at the recipe over and over thinking "I MUST have missed something" but - no - I followed it to a T.  No way to roll these into little balls, so I just plopped the goo onto a baking sheet and sprinkled some sugar on top.  The cookies came out flat and stuck to the sheet.  The flavor of the cookies was OKAY - not great.  I will be searching out a different recipe.

Tastewise, they're good. But the recipe is off. I followed it exactly and there was no way they could be rolled into balls then sugar before putting onto the cookie sheets. It's way too soft; almost like whipped cream. And they spread out immensely. They stuck together, to the sides of the pan and the bottom. I had to spray the cookie sheet that was supposed to be ungreased. If it weren't for a nice taste, I would have rated this recipe even lower. Definitely won't make these again.

These cookies taste perfect!  I would recommend putting the dough in the refrigerator for at least an hour to prevent them from flattening.  But either way, I'll eat them all up!

I made these and they turned out really hard! I was surprised to see that they flattened out because the dough was so thick and dry, but they turned out okay. I made them to enter into the fair, but I think they're just going to be to crispy.

This is the best cookie recipe I've ever tried!  Perfectly crisp on the outside and wonderfully chew inside.  So easy to make and seems great to experiment with for variation.  I made a half batch and it was gone the next morning.

This is a wonderful cookie that is a little crisp on the outside and soft on the inside! The only adjustment I made was to the sugar..... I did 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of light brown sugar...

Wow!  Best sugar cookies I have ever ate. Used butter instead of margarine.  Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The cookie saturates your mouth with its butter flavor and the vanilla is prominent as well.  This recipe is a keeper!

I would give this a good 4.5 stars. The taste is really good (especially the dough) but for some reason each of my 3 batches came out with different thickness. I rolled equal balls cooked for same time.. Couldn't figure it out. Overall yummy though, my bf and his worker friends devoured them.

Tasted great, but baking them was hard. I made them the size she suggested (size of a walnut) and put them a 1/2 inch apart and they expanded so much! My cookie sheets only have edges on two of the sides and the cookie spilled over the side that doesn't have edges! The cookie was great, and I would make it again but my tip is to make them very small and put lots of space between them!

Excellent easy recipe.  I used a small ice cream scooper to make the dough into balls to put in the sugar for coating.  I would not change a thing about this recipe.  They turned out soft with a little crispness to the outside.  Just perfect!!!

I did everything right, measured everything perfectly, yet it turned out, well, let's just say it was OKAY. They ended up much like pancakes and I don't think there was enough flour. It tasted like flour and only flour, it was very bland. It was SORT of chewy, more just soft with a consistency of a thick pancake. I cooked them fully, added white sugar at the top for taste, yet it still didn't help. If you're looking for a TASTY sugar cookie, please, I beg you not to use this recipe. I'm just a teenager, and I really wanted to wow my family. :( Oh well...

SUGAR COOKIE HEAVEN!!  These are amazing.  I followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of rolling them in sugar, because I was in a hurry.  I baked them until slightly golden on the outside, and light and puffy in the middle.  Because they were puffy when I first took them out, I was worried that they would be more cake-like, but they fell as they cooled into chewy, melt in your mouth perfection.  I love that this recipe stands on it's own, without needing any changes at all.  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful cookie!

These are the best sugar cookies. I kept the recipe the same except I used Mrs. Buttersworth syrup in place of the vanilla extract. I was dying to make these cookies but I was out of vanilla. I found out you can use syrup in it's place and now I'll always make them with the syrup. I think it gave it the perfect buttery sugar flavor. My husband said they were the best sugar cookie he had ever eaten and downed 5 in one sitting.

I made half of this recipe to try it and after I mixed everything together, the dough was too sticky to actually roll and put into balls so I just plopped them onto the cookie sheets instead. It wasn't done in 9-10 minutes so I left it in the oven for a few minutes longer. When I took it out and tried it, it was a bit crunchy on the edges and soft in the inside, which was good. But it tasted a little too much like egg. It was probably because I used a large egg. I think overall, it was good.

my whole family loved these cookies. they cameout nice and fluffy and perfect. i personally don't like cookies that are crunchy on the outside and these actually were'nt. I was running low on all-purpose flour so i used 2 cups of all-purpose and 1 cup of cake flour. the batter is very sticky so i did use extra flour. i got 4 dozen nice sized cookies. they only lasted 2 daysin my house and my family keeps asking for more. i will definently make these again

These are the best sugar cookies I've made.  Though I had to use 3.5 cups of flour for it to actually form into dough, still by far the best.  I also used colored sugar for the holidays and made some plain without the sugar coating.  My family says they're delicious.  Great recipe - thanks.

My husband, son and I all loved this cookie!!!  This was my first attempt at making sugar cookies with my 3 year old son and I'll tell you what....I screwed the order of the instructions up and the cookies were still amazing.  I don't really think there is a way to mess these up.  I added flour first then eggs....totally off from what the instructions say!  Anyhow, great cookies and like someone else said, if you are familiar with Subway sugar cookies, these are really close.  Thanks for the super easy and delicious chewy sugar cookie recipe!

Followed this recipe to the LETTER.   Batter was runny.  Could not form dough. I suspect the mix had too much liquid from 1 1/4 cups of margarine, 2 eggs, and 2 tsp of vanilla as noted in the recipe.  Caution following the ingredient list.  Attempted to fix liquid proportions by adding 1 cup of flour.  Mix was still too liquid like.    Avoid this recipe unless your a veteran baker who can adjust the proportions.

I tried this cookie recipe and it was truly the best sugar cookie recipe that I have come across.  I tend to bake more in the fall, I guess because of the upcoming holidays and new recipes that I want to try out on family.  This cookie is delicious.  I followed the exact recipe with no changes of my own.    WOW

I was thoroughly impressed with this recipe. The only thing I did different really wasn't much at all, was make the size cookie dough balls bigger. And used parchment paper to bake on. My oven was totally off today..Not sure what happened there but it took longer to bake then anything...But given the fact that it needs to be calibrated, the temp was 100 degrees less then it should have been and my cookies slow baked...to prefection. With a nice soft crisp outside and a soft chew in the center, it was hard to not gooble up the cookies before the completely cooled. I love this recipe. I will try the almond extract variation and snickerdoodle type next go around like author says. Thanks very much it's a keeper.

These cookies turned out fabulous and were really quick and easy. They are really chewy, yet slightly crispy on the edges - a perfect cookie. Also have a great buttery taste.

By: Darcie's daughter This recipe is okay. I tried to bake it three times and every time I had to scrape the cookies off the pan and throw them away because they burnt. I recommend cooking these cookies for 8-10 minutes if you do not want them to burn. Also, these need to be chilled so they are not too sticky to roll, and add some extra flour.  (If you burn these by accident, they are good in coffee.) I will try this recipe again, and let you know how it is!

Love this recipe! It was very simple to make, nice and tasty. The only thing I changed was that i rolled the dough in dark brown sugar. I also added a sugar glaze which i dribbled on the finished cookies!

This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have tried.  I had no problem with the dough, it wasn't sticky at all.  Secret is to cut the cold butter into the sugar. I agree they flattened out significantly but that's what sugar cookies do.

The dough was sticky, so I dropped the balls on the cookie sheet via spoon.  Time was about 18 minutes before the edges started to change colour,  and the cookie flattened out much more than I expected/hoped.  Entirely crispy, but the flavour is there.  Will try this recipe again some day, but for now, I'm moving on to the next one.

I literally just finished making this recipe and had to rate it. I wanted to make a simple kind of cookie for the office and chose this recipe based on the reviews and am so glad I did! This is by far the best recipe I have found. I did change one little detail. I used a 1/4 cup of applesauce in place of the 1/4 cup butter. It wasn't a huge change but it does help my "guilt factor" of eating so many! I would have substituted more but that was all I had. I also had to bake for almost 15 minutes. 9-10 were still pretty raw. Thanks for this recipe!

The cookies were tasty, but they were very flat, and the dough was very hard to handle.

Me and my family really didnt care for this recipe.The dough taste was exelent but the dough itself turned all mushy and gooey when i took them out of the refridgerator. They were GIANT as cooking in the oven.The taste was awsome! But not the dough. I mean the cookies werent even fluffy they were flat. If you want to use cookie cutters on these cookies this is not the recipe for you.

I've never been a fan of sugar cookies.  My husband asks for them every Christmas though.  So I searched through the recipes on this site and discovered this one.  This is now our family's favorite cookie, even mine!

I don't know what I did but the cookie dough was the stickiest, gooey-est, cookie dough ever.  I tried rolling it in a ball like the recipe said.  I used an air-bake cookie sheet with holes on the bottom and most of the cookie dripped out.  Not a fan.

These are just the way you want a sugar cookie to be, but perfection because you get to inhale them straight out of the oven. Buttery, chewy with a little crisp on the edges.  Followed recipe exactly except for using butter in lieu of margerine.

Great cookies!  Pretty much exactly what I was looking for.  The only changes I made was to use butter, being as I don't use margarine, and also to add the seeds of one vanilla bean along with the 2 tsp of vanilla extract.  It gave the cookies great flavor!  I was a little worried about the large amount of butter/margarine in the cookies, especially being as I only had salted butter, but they still came out great.  I chilled the dough overnight and the cookies had nice, crispy brown edges and soft centers.  Definitely a keeper!

No sense really, in rating this recipe since it has so many reviews already, but I've got to. Thank you for an amazing sugar cookie recipe. It's amazing how many variations of sugar cookies there are, but this is my absolute favorite. A little thin, very chewy, crisp around the edges...perfect!  We've almost made ourselves sick from them! The ONLY thing I did different was to add 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I rolled half in sugar and the other half in cinnamon sugar. Both were delicious, the cinnamon ones were ridiculously good.  Thanks again!

Dec 2009 update, I tried this will all margarine, against my better judgment. Bad idea. They spread sooo thin, I had to throw half of them out. I'm so mad at myself. Stick with all butter, or if you want to use margarine, make 1/2 of it shortening. 


YUM. I tested this recipe versus "Cracked Sugar Cookies I" from this site in a sugar cookie challenge. This recipe won. Everybody said it was the more 'traditional' sugar cookie, like you'd get at a bakery. I must say that I used all butter in place of margarine (still delicious), but next time I'll use the margarine.

These were great cookies! I went on a trip out of the country and used it there. Everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe! It is very easy to make. the only thing is that it is very sticky, but if you chill it for a short bit, it's easier.

For some reason my cookies spread out a looot and they ended up extremely flat... Which I do not find appealing in a cookie at all. The texture is great, I give it stars for that, but  honestly I thought the taste was just alright. I'm a cookie connoisseur and I found these to be above average, not the best tasting. I'll keep looking for another cookie recipe oh well!

I usually don't like sugar cookies, but I loveddd these ones! They're definitely great with a cinnamon-sugar coating.  Make sure to space them the full 2 inches on the pan though, otherwise they might spread and stick to each other!

This is a good recipe if you want a more cake like cookie..my hubby said it tasted like the teacakes his grandmother used to make.  I was looking for a more sweeter, chewy cookie and found it with "cracked sugar cookies I" (with a little more addition of sugar)

The dough was too sticky to roll into balls.  I dropped the dough into sugar and once coated, they could be rolled into balls.  They took much longer to bake then the recipe calls for.  It took 12-14 mins to bake.  The flavor is dull and just tastes like dough.  I like the simplicity of the recipe, but will not make these again.

OMG!!! let me just say, easiest sugar cookie recipe i have ever tried! as far as taste...just wow! i couldnt stop myself from eating some of the dough! its just delicious! some of the others talked about how sticky the dough was & that refrigeration helped & it does, but i also found something else that helps i think. the recipe calls for 1 1/4 cups butter, but i didnt have that much on hand, so i jsut used 1 cup instead, and i added an extra tea. of vanilla extract, i love the vanilla taste, after cooling them for about 15-20 min. the dough was ready, however, i recommend coating your hands lightly in flour, it helps ALOT, the dough didnt stick to my hands at all! i baked one batch & pulled them out after about 8 minutes, my oven runs hot, so i usually go with the lowest time, they were great, but a little doughy, even for me. i put the rest of the dough in the fridge & covered it, it was late & i wanted to go to bed, but i just finished baking another batch & they came out even better this time! the dough was alot less sticky, but i still recommend coating your hands & i left them in for 10 minutes, since they were colder, they were perfect! they were less doughy & the color is just right! they taste amazing! i didnt roll them in sugar, but i did put sprinkles on both batches right after they came out. my little cookie monster cant get enough of them! this recipe is a hit! i will use this forever!

My family loved these cookies and thought they were delicious. Like some other reviewers I added a half of cup more flour which helped with the stickiness. I also chilled the dough and used a medium cookie scoop dipped in flour which made cookie placement very easy, at which point they were sprinkled with colored sugar. They took about 13 minutes to bake and came out perfectly.

I really liked these cookies. It was a bit too sweet for my taste but it was very good. I put a tablespoon of cinnamon (instead of rolling them into cinnamin sugar) and a handful of crushed pecans. It tasted much, much better in my way. This cookie recipe will stay in my all time favorites cookie list that I make personally. Very yummy!

I baked a small batch right after I combined the ingredients and they ended up tasting like flour and butter. Somewhat disappointed, I stuck the rest of the dough in the refrigerator to sit over night and they were delicious they next day!! 
I'll definitely make this again!

I thought these were pretty good. I forgot 1/4 cup of margarine. Who knows how!!! But they still turned out okay. I would try again. Maybe adding a little more flour as the dough was pretty sticky. But 4 stars still.

yummy.
I used the amount of ingredients specified, used 2 teaspoons to 'mold' it to almost a ball (so my hands won't get sticky), press it down with the teaspoon and top it off with sugar and cinnamon. 
Great when they are baked about 9 min -- chewy and yummy.
also great when baked longer -- crispy and YUMMY.

Im not a very good cook but these were easy to make and came out perfect. I just spooned them onto the cookie sheet, didnt have any problems with them coming out flat. I did have to bake them for about 15min and the edges were barley golden. Nice and soft and chewey thou. The only thing is they werent quite sweet enough. Next time Im going to try extra sugar. I made icing for them and that sweetened them up perfectly. Great recipe if you are using icing, that way it dosent end up too sweet.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I was looking for a new sugar recipe because the one I tried prior was too floury tasting for me. This was perfect for a good chewy texture but, crisp outside. I added coconut flakes on top before baking just because I had extra to use and it was delicous!

I was looking for a quick recipe that called for the ingredients I have on hand (I am missing the tartar that other recipes call for) and found this one. I followed the recipe to the T and my dough also came out as batter. I added 1 more cup of flour at the suggestion of another reviewer on here and the batter thickened to a very sticky dough. I also extended the baking time by about 5 minutes and had to sprinkle the sugar on since I couldn't roll the dough into balls. They came out chewy like they were supposed to, but tasted like butter and eggs. Not too bad, but I'll keep looking.

This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have found! For thinner, extremely flavorful cookies do not refrigerate for more than 15 minutes. For puffier - still extremely tasty - cookies, refrigerate over night. I have made these both ways and cannot decide which I enjoy more :)

Very tasty cookies!  I used real butter, but next time will try margarine just to compare.  I rolled them out for Halloween cookies after chilling in the freezer for 45 mins.  I used flour and powdered sugar to roll them out.  They came out good, but I am not sure I would use this again for rolled cookies.  I do have to say they tasted wonderful right out of the oven and with no frosting.  I think I even prefer them plain with just a little sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

my family, friends, coworkers, everyone absolutely loves this recipe!!! I'm a culinary student, and i swear by this recipe they work out perfectly everytime, and you can add extras (espresso, chocolate, almond extract) to make them work with however you need them to taste. I've even added peanut butter...once you learn the consistency, they easy to experiment with. I'll never need another sugar cookie recipe again!! Thank you!! :)

I have been searching for a sugar cookie recipe that tastes good without topping with frosting.  THIS IS IT!!! The kids love them! I added more flour than the recipe calls for to make the dough less sticky and they were excellent.

I used Country Crock and followed the recipe exactly, the dough was more like a very thick batter so I ended up adding an extra cup of flour. It was never firm enough to ball up even after an hour in the fridge so I just plopped tablespoonfuls on the pan and sprinkled with sugar. I had to cook each batch five minutes longer than suggested or they wouldn't crisp up. Came out okay, kind of plain and cakey but chewy as promised.

I read the reviews for this recipe before I even tried it and was a little nervous.  I shouldn't have been.  It turned out great!  I didn't have any of the problems that some of the other reviewers had.  

I think one of the reasons they had problems was because they over-mixed the dough.  You're really only supposed to mix it until it's just incorporated.  It doesn't have to be perfect.  And don't add extra flour to firm up the dough.  It will make the cookies tough.  

The dough is very sticky but it will firm up if you put it in the refrigerator for an hour before you roll it into balls.

I rolled the entire batch first, then rolled the balls in sugar as I put them on the cookie sheets.  And make sure they're relatively chilled or they'll melt before they have a chance to cook.  

I experimented a little with the time since I wanted a chewy cookie, not a crunchy one.  The ones that were cooked for 8 minutes were a lot chewier but also very pale.  The ones cooked for 10 minutes were a little nicer looking but more on the crunchy side (although they were still chewy inside).  That would probably depend on the individual oven, anyway, so I would suggest doing a little experimenting of your own. 

And I just don't understand the issue some people had with the taste.  Mine taste just like sugar cookies should.  Sweet, buttery, rich.

I ended up with 54 cookies and everyone seems to like them.  I made them last night and they're still chewy.

I made these tonight and they're awesome!! The mix is easy, but the batter is tempermental. After many bad reviews here, I wanted to share how I got mine right:
1. Don't oversoften your butter or margarine  (I used all butter) or the batter will be too runny and make super flat cookies. 
2. I used 3 cups of flour.
3. Don't grease (or Pam) the cookie sheets. Baking them w/out the Pam helps them stick in one place as they bake (and not overspread).
4. Don't refrigerate the batter. I did it both ways, and the refrigerated dough made flatter cookies - guessing b/c the dough at a cooler temp really melts more than bakes right away. (?)
5. Let your cookie sheets fully cool before each re-use. 
6. I made bigger cookies (as I'm guessing most of us do) - used about a tBspn of dough on each one. So I made sure the cookies had room to bake... I used large sheets and cooked just 8 at a time - cookies came out almost palm-sized.
7. My cookies had to bake for 14 mins. They were crispy on the edges, and chewy in the middle - yum! I made snickerdoodles with half of them, just rolling them in cinnamon and sugar. (When you 'roll' them, it's more of a flop-around, because of the consistency of the dough.) Delicious!!

This cookie is good if you love the taste of margarine.  I prefer the flavor of a good cookie not just one ingredient.  The texture and consistency of this cookie is perfect though so I will make this again but I will only add 1 tsp of vanilla and will also add 1 tsp of almond extract.  I am also going to add a tsp of cinnamon and cut the margarine to just 1 cup.  Thanks for a good starter recipe!

These turned out excellent!! They melt in your mouth. I used margarine from the tub and I think that is why they were not able to be rolled into balls though. So I just used my cookie scoop to put them on the pan. They baked perfectly.

My 9 year old thought the cookies were great, but she used Splenda instead of regular sugar. She also used tub margarine instead of butter. Even with all her unusual changes, they were fairly good.

wonderful, exactly the recipe I was looking for, when I needed a cookie to put some M&M's in.  The flavor is really nice, I did the recipe as written, except added @ 1 cup of plain M&M's to the batter before scooping them on the baking sheet.  I baked them for 12 minutes as the 10 minute mark produced cookies that were a teensy bit on the raw side.  This recipe was immediately printed and added to my recipe box, thank-you!!

I just made this recipe today.  I altered the flavoring - I used 1 tsp almond extract and 1 tsp vanilla.  I did use margarine, even though I usually use butter for cookies.  I also used superfine sugar, which I always use for cookies.  It's also called "Baker's Sugar", and in my opinion, makes a better cookie no matter what kind you're making.  Anyway, my son, who only loves snickerdoodles and plain sugar cookies, said these were the best cookies I've ever made.  They were awesome.

These were just Ok, nothing special...still looking for the perfect sugar cookie recipe.  I did shape the dough into a log with plastic wrap, and then sliced them into perfectly shaped little round cookies, and deorated them with colored sugar.

I used this for fruit pizza so I didn't make cookies but nonetheless, it was a great recipe.  I will be using it from now on for sugar cookies.  The dough was a little sticky for rolling out but a little extra flour solved that.

Ughh. I just made these and they didn't come out well for me. I used that new spreadable butter because that was all I had. Which made them taste slightly greasy. Granted they were crispy and chewy in the middle. I made 2 dozen with half of the dough. They were done in 5 mins. More done than I'd like even. I let them cool for 5 mins. Which was a huge mistake. They stuck to the pan and it took forever to get them off. I'm newly pregnant and I got too tired trying to get the first batch of cookies off the pan to make the second batch. So the rest of the dough is sitting the fridge. For the effort I made to get them off the cookie sheet it wasn't worth it. Maybe I'll get brand new non-stick cookie sheets, margarine and try this recipe again.

I have to say again...these are great!! Try these! They are just as soft the second day as theya are the first! Be careful, or else you will find yourself eating the whole batch by yourself! They really taste like the storebought dough that you bake, which is exactly what I wanted. I just can't decide whether I like this recipe better or Cracked Sugar Cookies I.....try both! I have no idea why these didn't turn out for some of you...my suggestion is to try again and/or try Cracked Sugar cookies I by Pam. Did you follow the directions to the letter? Was your margarine too soft, perhaps? I did refrigerate the dough for a couple minutes before putting on the pan...

I made them for my opera cast, and I didn't bring a single cookie home! They LOVED them, and I must say, they are very addictive. Soft, chewy, incredibly sweet! Definitely a keeper!

GREAT! I baked for exactly 10 minutes and they were crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I put my dough in the refrigerator for about 45 minutes before I rolled.  I used the smallest pampered chef cookie scoop.  I rolled 1/2 in cinnamon and sugar and 1/2 in colored sugar.  A great cookie.

very good recipe - it was quite buttery and chewy. i prefer them with almond extract  so that they stand out more from other sugar cookies. however, i found their texture does not remain chewy the day after. what i do in this case is put them in an airtight container with a piece of bread and their texture won't change as much . . . enjoy!

These cookies are amazing! I read the reviews and used all butter and rolled them in cinnamon sugar-WOW!  The flavor is better than a bakery.  I did have to cook them for 15 minutes, after 10 they were still raw, but that could just be my oven. My Mom always said everyones oven was different. Thanks for a GREAT recipe I will use again and again.

I'm not a huge fan of sugar cookies -- my husband is -- but these were really good.  I halved the recipe and ended up with two dozen nice sized cookies.  Texture is as stated, crispy outside, chewy inside.  First batch was more chewy because I let cook for only 10 minutes.  I forgot the second batch was in the oven and they ended up cooking for 20 minutes total.  Believe it or not, that batch was still really good, just a bit more crispy but still with a chewy center.  I liked the second batch best, so next time I'll cook them for about 15 minutes for a happy medium.  
Batter was too sticky to roll balls at first, so I put it in the fridge for a few minutes and then it was perfect.  Also, to keep cookies from running together while baking, after placing them on the cookie sheet, I put the whole sheet in the freezer for ~2 minutes before putting them in the oven.  They spread perfectly!

I've been on a sugar cookie kick the past few days and the fresh store bought ones were too expensive, so I turned to this recipe.  I was a little nervous when I took them out of the oven.  They were as white as snow and flat.  BUT, after I let them cool, they were fine.  I used the Decorator's Frosting (also on this site) to spread on top.  I think I've finally got my craving under control!

This recipe is delicious.  I used colored sugar but flattened the cookie into the sugar so the sugar was only on the top.  Also - previous notes about the cookies getting hard quickly - if you store cookies in an air tight container with a piece of white bread the cookies will stay soft longer.

I just got done making these cookies with my 2 girls. I enjoyed the time making the dough it with my children then the cookie itself. They tasted wonderful right straight out of the oven,but I noticed as soon as they cooled they harden very quickly and crumbled. Maybe I did something wrong....Does anyone have any insite to make the recipe better or recommend a different recipe all together.

I LOVE this cookie. I have a habit of reading the reviews first before making the recipes. This is my second time making this one and I still love it. I don't understand why people say the cookies are crispy and crumbly the next day. Mine are still soft and chewy and very yummy. I followed the recipe exactly. I used real butter straight from the fridge. I did chill my dough for about 30 min. before baking to make it less sticky when forming the balls. No complaints here! Thanks again Cindy.

These didn't stay chewy very long and made many more than the recipe promised.  They came out pretty though and were perfectly round.  Still, I would try a different recipe next time.

These are yummy, I didn't add any extra flour or add anything different to thicken up the recipe. because for anyone who is like me who doesn't want to waste time rolling dough into a ball, I just dropped them on a pan with a teaspoon and sprinkled a little sugar on top. So I didn't need anything extra and they turned out great. Oh I did make sure that the teaspoon had about a walnut size amount on it, if that helps any

The first cookie recipe I made on my own that came out wonderful. The only problem is I can't stop eating them. We rolled them in blue sprinkles for Hanukkah and if I can figure out how to pack them, they're going as gifts! Thanks!

I never thought that I would find something that I liked to eat straight out of the oven more than chocolate chip cookies, but then I tried this recipe.  They're great--and amazing while still hot! :-)

This made closer to 40 than 30 cookies, but that's hardly a problem when they are so delicious.
They vanished very, very quickly!

I'm very impressed with these. Mine turned out a bit salty (due to my measuring technique) and chilling the balls before baking definitely helped eliminate excess spreading from a hot kitchen.  These are flat and very delicious, I was most pleased that there exists a recipie online that both makes a claim and holds itself to it. Congratulations, these are a keeper! 
... oh, and they made more than 30 cookies at my house. Yum!

This recipe is fantastic! I used butter instead of margarine and used half vanilla and half almond flavorings. The dough was pleasant to work with, not too sticky, and fast to put together. My husband declared them the best sugar cookies ever, and finished them off in two days. I will be making these again soon.

This is a great cookie.  It was exactly like the recipe said - chewy inside and crispy outside.  It was quick, simple, and used all common ingredients - a very good recipe to keep on hand, which I will do.  My family loved them, especially the cinnamon/sugar ones.  I didn't have any of the possible problems I read in some other reviews, however, my idea of the size of a walnut must be way off because I ended up with way more than 30 cookies!!

I loved these cookies! My 2 1/2 year old daughter helped me make them for Imbolc this year. We used this recipe to make Sun cookies. We substituted 3/4 C. of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour and used butter instead of margarine. Then we made them yellow by glazing/icing them with yellow lemon icing/glaze...YUMMY! I will definitly keep this recipe for years to come :)

I came online looking for a sugar cookie recipe without cream of tarter..and found this one. These cookies are wonderful!! My daughter and I had a great time making them and you don't have to refrigerate the dough overnight. Instead of butter or margarine we used butter flavored Crisco and they were great. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe

Oh my! This has got to be the BEST cookie recipe I have EVER tried. It is incredible, the best cookies ever. The snickerdoodles (cinnamon and sugar) are even better then the normal sugar cookies. My entire family devours these in half a day, and I just made another batch to bring to a cousin of mine who's fiance just got sent to the mid-east. Great comfort food. Thank you so much for posting this recipe, it's really great. P.S. It's really easy, I am 15 and make it NO PROBLEM!

These were great! I rolled them in a blend of sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon, and then sprinkled a little more on top before baking to make snickerdoodles - what a hit!

I made it but the cookies barely spread out. I used everything exactly. I had to press them myself for them to be flat otherwise they come out like balls. It tasted good but something is wrong when i made it.

I made two batches. One with lemon flavoring/yellow sugar and the other with orange flavoring and sugar.  My grandkids loved them. We're planning to make more  with cherry or strawberry  flavor and red or pink sugar for Valentine's Day.  I saw some bad reviews but tried this recipe anyway. I'm so glad I did. They were just like the ones my grandmother made. Thanks

We loved these.  They turned out to be a thinner cookie with a softer inside and a slightly crunchier exterior making them the perfect cookie.

These cookies were perfect in flavor, consistency and looks. I'm sure this recipe works perfectly as written but I did make a couple minor changes based on other reviews: increased flour by 1/4 C and chilled the dough for 2 hours to prevent too much flattening, and found baking them 12 mins. (instead of 8-10 mins) in 350 oven insured that perfect crunchy edge and chewy center. This recipe will become my "go to" for chewy sugar cookies.

Horrible. This resulted in a terrible "cookie". The dough had WAY too much baking powder in it, and no where near enough flour. The "dough" was more like a tacky batter that would not scoop, roll, or rest correctly, and would stick to everything. Would not come off pan.

Cookies came out resembling muffin tops rather then cookies. They had the texture of bread, had a smooth surface, like a crust, and wasn't even fully cooked through. Mind you, this is no fault of the equipment I have, as it is top of the line, and I'm very experienced with using it. 

If you want a correct cookie, you need to reduce the baking powder, and almost triple the amount of flour for the dough to even look like dough and roll properly. Do not follow this recipe if you actually want a cookie.

This is a pretty good recipe. I did find the dough easier to work with by putting it in the fridge wrapped tightly for 30 mins.

I made it exactly as the recipe said, and my cookies turned out very... weird. The tase was fine. Let's be honest, it's pretty hard to mess up the taste of a sugar cookie as long as there is sugar and vanilla in there somewhere.
The problem I ran into was with the texture. The baking time said 8 - 10 minutes. I checked them at 8, still super gooey. I took them out at 10 minutes, still pretty mushy, but I thought as they cooled they might harden to be the nice soft i had hoped for. Nope, still mushy, even sitting overnight they were still squishy like they were only half baked.
So, I made a second batch. I let these bake for around 12 - 15 minutes. They were still just as squishy, except these also would just fall apart whenever you tried to pick them up.
We ate them anyway, quite frankly we're pretty happy eating raw cookie dough even. I mixed up some buttercream frosting, and we enjoyed our plates of sugary mush. I definitely will not be using this recipe again though.

Excellent recipe.  A little sweet for my taste so I will decrease the sugar but will definitely be making these again.

Amazing cookies!!!   It reminds me of Pillsbury Sugar Cookies, but better.  I added almond extract to the recipe.  This one is a winner.

They were perfect I had to make another batch.  For you guys that are saying there not good it has to be the flour your using is old are trying to rush it. They are also great using almond extract in place of the vanilla. Yummy.  That's so much for the recipe...?

The taste was awesome.  However, mine were very sticky even after chilling overnight.  They spread very thin in the oven which made them quite crisp.  Again, they tasted awesome but were not chewy.  I did soften the margarine, but one would think that afte refrigeration they would have been firm.  Not so.  Not sure what the problem was.

These are AMAZING!!! Mine all came out  very ugly lol. I know I made the majority too big and didn’t let them cool before I transferred. They ended up being mush so I rolled them into what I called “ cookie balls” and the goal was to dip them (like cake pops) but ended up eating and they were great. Thanks for the recipe.

The flavor of these is excellent! However, the texture can be tricky. I’ve made them three times with different outcomes. If you’re using non-dairy fat, then go for margarine in sticks or plant butter in sticks. When I made these with margarine from a tub the batter was too runny (like many of the negative reviews). I’ve also made these with a mix of margarine and shortening, which helped make the cookies a bit thicker than using margarine alone.

I didn't roll them in sugar, in part as I mixed the batter just a bit too long and was unable to do so.  I dropped spoonfuls, in the size of walnuts. I will make these again, maybe try to roll them but they've come out super fluffy this way so maybe not... Thanks for the recipe!

Best sugar cookies ever.  Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  The only change I made is that I did not roll them in sugar before I baked them.  Family loved them.

I made this two ways because I was curious about the difference when it came to baking powder vs baking soda since the recipe author originally had baking powder listed and then changed it to baking soda. Maybe a skilled baker wouldn't need to test both to know how they'd be different, but I'm not a skilled baker, so I wanted to test it out. 

So in the first batch, I used baking soda and the cookies were thin (almost no rise), nicely soft in the middle with a crispier (but not hard) bite on the edge.

In the second batch, I used baking powder. These had a much higher rise and they didn't spread on the baking sheet the way the baking soda cookies did. They're thicker cookies, but they also came out much crunchier than the baking soda cookies. But honestly, that's probably because I left them in until the edges started browning the way I did with the baking soda batch.

My sister and I LOVED the baking soda cookies. My mother didn't care for them and instead preferred the baking powder cookies.

Key differences: The baking soda set are much thinner, softer, and have a bit of a bite to them at the edge before you get into the chewiness of the middle of the cookie.

The baking powder cookies are thicker and I would suggest taking them out before the edges brown so that they remain soft, otherwise they'll be mostly crunchy with little hints of softness here and there.

So if you want the thin crispy edges, chewy center cookies I suggest you use baking soda. Leave them in until th

This is, by far, the best and easiest sugar cookie I've ever made. Definitely lives up to its name. As adjustments go I used lemon flavoring instead of the vanilla since I'm using it as a dessert w/fruit. Also, chilled the dough and scooped w/a cookie scooper.  That made it so easy. Thanks for posting!

It is absolutely awful, the dough is way too runny to roll into balls so I had to spoon them onto a cookie sheet. When they came out they tasted like straight flour. these are some of the worst cookies I have ever had the displeasure to make in my life.

I substituted one cup of melted butter for the margarine and they turned out great. i love a good soft chewy sugar cookie and these are perfect. i did also chill the dough for about 10 minutes or so, and cooked them a little longer than ten minutes just to make the edges nice and crispy.

My fist time baking cookies from scratch by myself! I used the same amount of butter instead of margarine, and sadly had no vanilla extract, but they still turned out crispy outside, tender inside, and delicious.

I flattened a few of them a little more than necessary before baking, so those were crispy throughout, but YES if you follow the directions exactly and just plop slightly squished walnut-sized dough balls, you WILL get a perfect crunchy outside and a chewy inside.

Also, coating the dough balls in sugar was perfect to keep them from sticking on hands/utensils/etc. while arranging on the sheet. I recommend using an ice cream scoop to drop dough balls into a bowl of sugar and then shaking/rolling the sugar over them. Gently shake the excess off like it's a glitter-and-glue craft.

Thank you Cindy for this recipe!

They came out tasty enough, but very thin and relatively flat, despite whipping the butter to a froth. I had to refrigerate the dough before I could form the balls because, as I later saw in other reviews while doing a post-mortem, the recipe didn't call for enough flour. In addition, it would work much better with baking powder instead of baking soda because there's no acid in this recipe that baking soda can react with. Baking powder contains baking soda as well as acid like cream of tartar to make the dough rise. I'm going to use a friend's recipe that corrects those problems and yields fantastic cookies.

I made it and I'm happy to say it worked!!!I only did a few things different but they came out great!! I worked the butter until soft and when making the dough I didn't scooped it out since it wasn't soft enough to do so. But since I watch a lot of baking videos I figured that I had to pull knead the cookies. I pulled out some plastic wrap and set it flat, grabbed some flour and spread it across the plastic As well as my hands and began kneading it till it combined nicely. I wanted to something special so I molded the dough into a square and split the dough in half saving one half for sugar cookies and the other half for snickerdoodles.(all I did was add a small batch of my cinnamon sugar mix and kneaded it into the dough till it was combined nicely as well)  At that point you can do two things, shape the dough and put it in the fridge for two hours until it hardens cut them and make shaped cookies or you can you can split pieces of the dough roll it out into cookie size and cook them immediately. (Like I did) I forgot to sprinkle sugar on to my cookies but the still came out well! I'm really happy!??

The dough tastes really good, I'll give it that. The batter was so thin that the cookies wouldn't roll at all, even after adding extra flour. I did have to substitute the baking soda with baking powder but seeing as how that was just more dry ingredients I don't think that's why they were so runny. The cookies themselves fell apart because they were stuck to the pan, and they tasted more like vanilla wafers than sugar cookies. I've had worse, but I've definitely had better, too.

Accidentally mixed the sugar in with the dry ingredients, and made the scoops of dough too big on the tray. They stuck together, and now they're squares, but they are DELICIOUS!

The cookies turned out fine,  but the flavor is not quite what I’m looking for. I think I’m looking for sugar cookies that are taller, pillowy in the middle, still with browned edges but the rest of the cookie looks lighter in color. So if you like extra buttery flat sugar cookies, these are for you.

I’ve made this recipe more than half a dozen times. The very first time I made it I made it exactly as specified. Although I had read other reviews that said they used butter instead of the margarine and due to the fact that the food police on AR have a whole full blown heart attack for reviewing the recipe if you’ve altered it based on others  recommendations. HOWEVER, every time since I’ve made the recipe as specified with the exception of using butter instead of margarine. I love the depth and richness the butter adds as opposed to the slightly artificially aftertaste that the margarine left in my mouth. I refrigerate the freshly blended cookie dough for 20 minutes and then bake 2” cookie dough mounds for 8-9 minutes at 335/340 degrees and they come out perfect every time!

These cookies are so crisp and crunchy on the outside and deliciously chewy on the inside. As they are they are scrumptious, but rolling them in cinnamon sugar instead of plain sugar makes them CRIMINALLY good. Try both!

These cookies turned out great... The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because the recipe says to roll them in to balls, and the dough is way to sticky for that, so I really questioned if they where gonna turn out right, but they did... I used parchment paper under mine and I had to cook them for 13 mins, and I really let my margarine set out and get soft, but they really did turn out great...I will definitely make these again...

Made these today and they are very tasty. Would suggest that dough by chilled in fridge for approximately 15 minutes, making it easier to handle. Also used teaspoon scoop to drop dough onto plate with sugar, this makes it easier to roll. Return dough to fridge while batches are baking until entirely used.  Increased oven temperature to 365° and baked for 18 minutes until thin brown edge formed around the cookies.

Very chewy and delicious. Had a hard time rolling them into little balls, but I just used an ice cream scoop and topped them off with some sugar.

They taste SUPER good. They are sweet and chewy like they were supposed to be. The only bad thing was that i couldn't make them into balls. They were a little too crumbly to make into balls. But really really delish????????????????

they turned out really good! kinda made them on a whim cause i just was in the mood and had time. didn’t expect them to spread out a ton so the first batch was gigantic so i ended up portioning them different. this recipe made me about 32 bigger than average cookies so it was good, didn’t take me long either. also, DELICIOUS!

I used only butter instead of margarine. I rolled the first batch into large walnut sized balls, and had to break them apart. The best batch was rolled like a large grape.

Delicious sugar cookie recipe!  My mom asked when was I making these again!?!  I did half without the sugar coating and the other half coated in sugar and cinnamon (my version of a snickerdoodle ;-). My son and husband loved them as well.

I usually use another sugar cookie recipe that turns out great for cookie cutting but I thought I'd try a new recipe. Ours spread out too much and are super thin and my fingers were coated in butter when I ate one. Maybe we did something wrong??? But I'm going to have to make another batch now with my old recipe so my boys can cut them out.

I absolutely will make this my go to sugar cookie recipe. It's actually very easy, although I did tweak it just a bit. 
1. I added 2 Tbs of extra butter
2. After I had blended the wet & dry mixture together I thought if I had added a bit of lemon juice it would give it a bit more flavor, so I did add about 1/3 of a cup fresh lemon juice. It did make it a bit too moist, so I added about 1/3 cup more flour.
      I have to say I'm so glad I tweaked it just enough to give it a very light lemon flavor.  These cookies taste like they're from a bakery. Just enough of a light crisp to the outside,  and perfectly chewy on the inside (not a bit of raw dough on the inside)! Please note, don't put too much dough on the cookie sheets like I did with my first batch..they were ginormous!! LoL   When I decreased their size  to a small walnut they were perfect size.  I baked them at 350 for just 8 minutes.
     These are for my Grandsons & family on Christmas. Now I must get to frosting these...Although plain is perfect!

I liked the way this recipe was written and directed fully. My oven always acts like it is on speed or something! Knowing this, I had to bake the recipe for a shorter amount  of time and then and then keep an eye on it while it is baking. The time that I used was 5 minutes for the first batch and 5 min. and 30 seconds to cook. Also, the cookies did not come out as soft, It was chewy before I put it on the rack to cool, but the tremendous flavor and other factors made this cookie in all the same size (I used a scoop) and with and overall quite good end result, I am making an other recipe with these cookies, so I have that on my plate for today.

These are excellent!  Light and delicious! Love them!  Really easy to make - the light fluffiness of the sugar and butter mix is the secret.  Even taste great with adding nuts (which I did with a second batch).

Followed the recipe as stated. Dough was really runny. Left it in the fridge overnight hoping it would firm up. I wasn’t able to roll the dough into balls so I used a cookie scoop. Baked for 8 mins and they came out super flat and fell apart when taking them off the cookie sheet. Left them overnight hoping they’d harden but they only got softer. Dough and cookie tasted good but I made them for a pot luck and was very disappointed with the outcome.

Excellent flavor. Dough is very soft so I used
a cookie scoop and dropped dough into a bowl of sugar. I was then able to move dough to pan. I had to use almost a cup of sugar when rolling the dough into balls. I also had to increase the baking time so that cookies were not raw.

I made an all recipes account just so I could warn people to stay away from this terrible recipe. These cookies were disgusting. The batter was way too dry - the high flour content and low liquid content made it basically the texture of parmesan cheese. After I doctored it up a bit (let it rest, added a little more shortening), it was workable, but the cookies are dry, not chewy at all. Only try this one out if you want a cookie that will suck all the moisture out of your mouth. Not worth the calories. Just stay away.

I substituted 1C white sugar for dark brown,  and replaced half the butter with cream cheese.  The cookies were very chewy,  almost like bread.

Super Delicious, I used Country Crock Sticks and made them in my Kitchenaid stand mixer. Dough is sticky, I did roll it and put it in the freezer for an hour! I made big cookies and also cooked them on Parchment paper using my air bake Cookie sheets. Batter does spread, I cooked them a little longer just until light brown. LET THEM REST, these are so chewy and yummy.

DONT MAKE THESE!!!!! i honestly don’t know how this recipe has so many good reviews. the batter does not get thick enough to roll into balls! we kept adding more and more flour and still not good enough! i would suggest keep looking for another recipe.

My daughter frowned when she discovered I was making sugar cookies instead of her usual favorite, chocolate chip.  I added the zest of a fresh lime to this recipe for something new and fresh.  I could not keep them in the house more than about 12 hours and they all disappeared.  Delicious.

Great Recipe!
I made this in a total of about 40 minutes including cooling time. This recipe is EXACTLY what I wanted. Someone even told me: "Now that's a true Sugar Cookie!" 
I definitely be making these again! The only thing you should know is that this recipe does make alot of cookies.
So you could maybe split the recipe. ??

For the most part I agree with some of the negative reviews. I followed the recipe to a T and the cookies spread A LOT and are extremely thin. With that being said I think the flavor is good! I think the recipe may be off on some portions. The batter for me was almost closer to a cake batter. I may take some other people’s advice on here and try adding a cup of extra flour next time. So this batch doesn’t go to waste I’m putting the dough in the fridge for a night to see if it helps a little. Again, I liked the taste (I did a cinnamon sugar coating) but the consistency wasn’t good for me.

They are a little things, but they tasted so good that I am willing to try the recipe again with some of the modifications in the comments. These were so delicious. I couldn't stop eating the batter, and I ate half the cookies before I could frost them.

So delicious.  Soft and chewy with slightly crispy edges. Not heavy but still satisying. 

(Mine did come out flatter than those in the pic, even though I used room temperature butter and chilled the dough for 24 hours...it might have been my using butter instead of margarine.  I can just add a pinch of baking powder next time anyway.). 

I did follow original recipe baking instructions and did bake them almost 15 minutes to get a slightly browned edge and they still had soft chewy centers. Perfect consistency for my family's tastes.  (I had also tried pulling them out right when the edges were cooked but not quite browned yet and let them rest many minutes on their insulated cookie sheet.  For my tastes, they were too gooey, almost dough-like, in the middle.)

For the 2 tsp vanilla, I used 1/8 tsp almond extract and the rest vanilla (so all but 1/8 tsp of the 2 tsp was vanilla).  It was somewhere between an almond cookie and a sugar cookie, closer to sugar cookie.(I usually add just a touch of another flavor to sugar cookies, as I find them bland.). But I'm sure any sugar cookie fan would love these with just the vanilla.

Thanks to the original poster for this great recipe!

I've been using this recipe for years and it has never let me down. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. It makes a good snickerdoodle too. Just roll them in a cinnamon sugar mixture.

This is the base recipe I use for sugar cookies--like the author, I like mine chewy, and this works well for that. One of my favorite variations is to add orange oil to the recipe, to make orange vanilla sugar cookies. I use ~1 tsp or to taste of food grade orange oil. I also usually make these using whole wheat flour and brown sugar, because that's usually all I have on hand, and they turn out fine.

I loved them the time are sweet (with almond oil and vanilla extract ) but not to sweet and I was not suppose to do the whole recipe but I did it any way and it worked out because it lasted almost a week (I froze the rest) I it works well with a silicone baking mat even though that's all I use when I do cookies

Just the recipe I was looking for.  The dog loves them too. If you live in a hot climate, put them in the fridge before baking.

I have made this recipe many times, and they are a hit!  I have put them in cute bags and given them to people as get well presents and they loved them.
They are very simple to make and don't take a long time. The only change I made was I substituted the margarine for softened butter, so it was less sticky.

Really great cookies! Crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, just what I was looking for.  I did a couple of changes that were recommended.  I used butter, which I would have used anyway IF I had remembered haha,  and I added 1 tsp of corn starch as recommended and they came out just great.  I didn't see how many it makes, but I ended up with appx 4 dozen and I made 1/2  sugar, and 1/2 cinnamon/sugar.  Family loved both.  I sent half of these to my Grandson who is in the Air Force for some taste of home.

I make these all the time!  They're great as is but I love changing them up also.  My favorite so far is to add orange zest, ginger and cardamom and to use browned butter, and mix allspice into the rolling sugar.  Today I made them with rose butter and almond paste.

These impressed everyone - even those who don't have much of a sweet tooth! Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside - perfect! I found myself in Europe over the holidays without a rolling pin, the space to roll, or cookie cutters to make my normal sugar cookies...and these were easy to prepare. I rolled half the batch in cinnamon sugar and half in plain sugar - and all in sprinkles of course! Thank you for the recipe!

If I could make any changes, I would include childproofing within the recipe instructions. My son made these while I was at work, and put a metal bowl into the microwave to soften the butter. He was so excited to share homemade cookies he wasn't thinking the entire instructions through properly.

lovely cookie. I made it with margarine instead of butter and the texture and taste were amazing. I had to cook it more than 10 minutes though, somewhere are 13 to get them done, but i didn't mind.  Next time i think i'll try half butter and half margine to see if i get it to taste a bit more buttery.

Our family LOVED these! I used 1C margarine and 1/4C of Crisco, and I rolled the chilled balls into sugar crystals (1/2 white sugar and 1/2 colored crystals) and made 4 colors of amazingness! A repeat recipe for life!

The butter to flour ratio is too high.  Also, fell flat, so there is some problems with the baking soda amount.   Tastes over buttery, and looks not appealing.

Needed to adjust +25% flour and cook 12 minutes for Colorado 6000 ft. altitude. Without adjusting, they were flattened and crunchy. With adjustment, rounded, uniform, and oh, so delicious.

I've tried this recipe twice, and out just doesn't come out to my liking. The cookies taste more doughy than sweet, and the texture comes out like storebought sugar cookies. If that's what you're looking for, give it a try.

These flatten out even when adding more flour and don’t have a great taste. I wouldn’t make them again. I make a lot of cookies and these just aren’t worth it.

I've made this recipe many times, and every time they turn out the same- thin, flat, and crispy. I definitely prefer the cracked sugar cookies I recipe on this site! But I must give this recipe credit for staying consistent! It may be just a matter of preferences, but I wouldn't suggest this particular recipe unless you like especially chewy cookies!

I made two batches with cinnamon and sugar and they turned out great. For the second batch, I added M&Ms I had left over from Halloween.

Excellent! I only added 1 cup of butter and it turned out incredible (just because I forgot to add the remaining 1/4 cup.) Chewy, yet crisp on the outside. I made them about the walnut size that was recommended and baked for about 15 minutes. It had the right amount of sweetness with a touch of salty after each bite. Delicious. I'm going to try rolling out and use cut outs next time.

Do not follow written directions as they are severely  incorrect. The video(seen after the fact) shows completely different directions. Example cream together sugar and margarine until light and fluffy that was definitely not done in the video which results in runny cake like batter. Nor does the written directions say to wrap it in plastic wrap, which is done in the video which I can only assume it to chill the dough. I gave this recipe a 2 star as the taste of the cook was still that of a sugar cookie but I did have to extend the cook time(15minuted @350) and spoon it out on to parchment paper.

Not only was the batter liquidly to the point where I could have made a cake instead, they also were dry and bland when they were done. I had to add almost two more cups of flour just so I could bake these. Wasn't worth my time.

My go to sugar cookie recipe. I use butter instead of margarine. Just can't stomach something that is only a few molecules away from being plastic. Using the butter makes no difference. I soften it and it works great. I use Zulka Morena Pure Cane Sugar is an all-natural, unrefined and non-GMO pure cane sugar and you get great results.

I will definitely make these again. They are delicious and chewy. I followed the recipe and they turned out perfect. The only thing I did different was let the mix cool like one of the reviews recommended but not to long about half hour.

I always cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup, but that's just because I like less sugar.  These are the best.  I always make a double batch and keep some dough in the freezer.  They're great when company comes over unexpectedly.  The kids love them rolled in colored sugar.  I like to add a little cinnamon and roll them in cinnamon sugar to make the snickerdoodles.

I have made this and it is amazing!!! Actually I have made this more than once (a dozen times!). They are chewy and delicious. They are good with frosting but I eat them plain. Whenever I make them people want more! 
I recommend this! :)

I really love these cookies for homemade... They are almost cake-like with a chewy middle and crispy ends . The dough was even good, since the batter is sticky I first used flour on my hands to roll dough balls but it was time consuming so I just spooned it on leaving an inch or so in between. 
The one thing I did change is on my recipe I added cinnamon and little pinch of sugar to each individual cookie and it gave it so much more flavor. The second time around when I made these I used almond extract and it was really delicious. You only 10 min on 350 degrees in the oven. Next time I'm going to try different extracts.  Hoppy cooking!:)

Very easy to follow and they came out delicious. I tweaked the recipe to 1 1/3c of sugar and finished off with some powdered sugar. Not too sweet yet very tasty!

Here is my experience.  Yes, the batter was soft and sticky, so, rather than adding flour or chilling in the refrigerator, I simply spooned the batter into a 9 x 13 glass baking dish and baked it like a brownie.  I sprinkled the top with course sugar.  They turned out just fine and can be served as is or with ice cream or maybe even a spreadable fruit topping.  It's a decent base recipe for a pan dessert, but not suitable for a rolled dough cookie, unless you add 1/2 cup of flour.

That's my two cents.

Amazing! I had to make two batches due to a small oven. For the fist batch I accidentally put the temperature at 350. My little oven gets very hot and cooks fast so I have to change the temperature. The cookies were a little hard but still very yummy!! By the second batch I realized the temperature was wrong so I changed it to 300. The were so good! They had a nice crunchy outside and a wonderful chewy inside! I have a lot of extra dough and will be making more tomorrow and I'm sure again in the future!!!

To all negative reviewers:  The key step that I believe you guys are missing, (because I did it myself!) is that you HAVE to CREAM the sugar and butter. Creaming can take up to 5 minutes with a hand blender. 

Creaming butter is an important step in the process of baking. It gives your sugar lift and spreads out all the little granules and adds some air to your mixture. In the end, this hard work is rewarded with tender cookies that bake evenly without pooling or burning.

Google the process, try this recipe again. Don't give up! Life is good!

I make cookies about every other week, and normally I use a recipe with brown sugar. We were out of brown sugar, so I tried to find a recipe without it.I found this recipe, and these are the worst cookies over, they were way too buttery and were extremely sticky, I added more flour but he just made them bland. DO NOT make this recipe unless by you want to be severely disappointed.

The cookies themselves were good, however, the dough was more of a batter, as I added about a fourth of a cup of milk. I believe this was on me, so that is not why I gave this three stars. Despite coating the cookie sheet in non stick spray, the cookies still stuck to the metal. It was very difficult to remove, and hard to wash afterwards.

I softened my butter before adding it (I didn't see the previous reviews that warned against softening). Dough was super sticky and unusable...
So I tweaked it a little. Added a few drops of olive oil and 1/4 cup more flour. Then I chilled it for 30 minutes. Came out great!

Need to be sure to put in directions that you only mix ingredients to where they're clumpy still, and you can still see flour then to start mixing with your hands or it will my work right

This recipe came out ATROCIOUS. The dough was in NO WAY dense enough to make balls out of it, so I tried placing them on the cookie sheet like drop cookies. Once it went in the oven, they all flattened out and conjoined into one huge, flat cookie. Also, they were NOT ready by 10 minutes. This was bad. So, so bad.

These were the best.  Turned out exactly as described.  Very important to press each cookie ball down slightly to reduce the random spread.  The cookies  turn out perfectly round, thin, crispy on the edges and chewy centers.  Bake slightly longer for more crunch but it will still be chewy.

WOW!  I am really picky about my cookies, and these definitely made the grade.  They are now one of my very few go-to cookie recipes.  I made them exactly per recipe, rolling half in white sugar and half in cinnamon sugar.  They were all perfect.  I will try adding almond extract next time.  I highly recommend these wonderful sugar cookies!  WOW!

Followed recipe exactly with cookies baking for 9 minutes. Cookies turned out extremely flat. They are chewy and have a good flavor, but are really thin.

I would make these again. Very good!! Just want to add though that if you roll these in cinnamon sugar they aren't snickerdoodles. They get their unique flavor and texture from their recipe using cream of tartar. Otherwise it's not a doodle. ??

So, I'm curious about the discrepancy between the reviews on this recipe, and I'm sorry I didn't read reviews first and look for a different one. How did you roll out this dough? Mine was very soft, almost like cake batter, and I did follow the directions exactly. I thought about adding a little more flour, then  I opted to spoon it onto the cookie sheets (with difficulty and lots of finger licking). They were flatter than a pancake coming out of the oven and stuck to my cookie sheet.  Waste of ingredients and time.

Ok for kids, but too sweet.   It was easy to make and fun for my kids to help with.  However, the finished product just isn't very good and, again, too sweet.  I used real butter.

These get rave reviews from all that enjoy! I always make these as Snickerdoodles. Perfect chewy and crunchy. I wonder if anyone has a type of Gluten Free flour option they like most?! I tried to make them Gluten Free for the first time today and although I am waiting for the first batch out of the oven, I feel they will not taste good. Please let me know!

Very nice! I followed the recipe exactly except for using butter instead of margarine. I experimented with different "batches" - the first was "as is" and probably my favorite, the rest "snickerdoodle"-style and they were almost TOO sweet for me, but I've been living in Mexico where they have a decidedly lesser sweet tooth and am pretty sure I've just acclimated to that. (I made these at 5000 feet above sea level, very humid environment, and didn't have any issues). Thanks for the recipe! :-)

These were perfect. Another reviewer had commented to adjust the flour to 3 1/4 C. This was excellent advice. I needed a recipe that didn't have chocolate in it and tried this one on a whim. Also, because the dough is sticky and I didn't have time to pop it in the fridge, I used my cookie scoop. It worked just fine. I added an 1/8 C fresh squeezed orange juice as well. Which helped the sticky factor. I was out of extract, or I would have chosen that instead of the juice. They spread into almost perfect circles. I flattened with a cup lined with maple granulated sugar. Overall, amazing. I bring cookies into work work every Monday. These are disappearing quicker than usual.

Delicious!  I've made a lot of sugar cookies in my life but I do believe these are the best.  Followed the directions as written with the exception of adding about 1/3 c. additional flour.  Crisp outside, chewy inside.  I will make these again and again!

Honestly,  nothing better than following a recipe and getting results.  

Perfect  crisp edges & soft chewy centers.  All uniform and evenly baked. I used those double layer insulated cookie sheets so baking took 13 min in oven.

The cookies are the best sugar cookies we have ever tasted. We followed the recipe exactly, but we refrigerated the dough like many people said. The only thing we thought was a little weird was that we had to bake them for about 23 minutes. I made it with my kids of 9 and 12. Also instead of margarine we used butter.

I made these exactly by your recipe & they were chewy & deliscious as promised. I will definitely make them again. I may add 1/4 cup more flour as they were a titch flatter than desired. I sifted flour so maybe my volume of flour was off a titch. A full recipe disappeared in 4 days, with 5 adults & 2 tweens in house. ??

I'm not sure how to contact & leave a msg directly for the person who posted the recipe except for leaving one on here so i am hoping to do just that... i have a question for the person who posted it, which is this:
I had printed off a recipe a few years ago for the perfect sugar cookie and i had it memorized for the longest time and so i just realized today, when i pulled the recipe out of my book that i only printed out part of the card and so i don't have the whole thing any more. The name it gives for the person who submitted it is CindyAnn and so i was hoping, since the name is so close, that this recipe is the same recipe and that you are the same person. i suppose it isn't important....I'm going to make this one in a minute because i think it's the same & so I'll find out one way or another here in a minute. if you are, in fact, the same person, than i would like to 'subscribe', as it were, to your links so I'll remember to try some of the others. i have the perfect recipe for cutout sugar cookies to decorate but I loved other recipe because they are phenomenal and incredibly easy to make. No hassle and no waiting to chilll! Anyway, That's all i needed. I'll check back for an answer periodically. Thank you!

Good straight forward recipe and fairly easy to do
The cookies came out light and slightly chewy. The dough was easy to cut with our metal cookie cutters, and held together well.

I made these cookies recently because I had never made cookies from scratch. I searched and searched and stumbled upon this recipe. I gave it a try and they turned out really good even though the dough was bit wet for my liking. I placed the dough in the freezer for awhile with it being  wrapped in plastic wrap. Upon taking the semi-harden cookie dough out I was able to form balls of dough to place in the oven.  My husband and I really loved this recipe and will be using it again in the future.  The only thing i would do different is mix everything  with spatula instead of using the hand mixer which I think is what could have caused my dough to be wet from the over mixing being that my mixer in a heavy duty stand mixer that was used on its lowest setting. Awesome , Easy and Delicious Recipe for simple sugar cookies.

Simple recipe. Great cookie, but I agree with another reviewer that the dough is too sticky. I've made it twice now and added 1/4-1/2c flour each time and it was perfect. Maybe my climate? Anyway, two thumbs up for a delicious chewy sugar cookie.

Made these today and family loved them. I used 2 sticks softened butter and cut sugar to 1 3/4 cups. I also, chilled dough for couple hours and added finely chopped pecans to balls of dough before pressing onto cookie sheet. They were soft and chewy with right amount of crunch. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

The batter was definitely thick enough. The only critique I have is that it needed more sugar and needed to stay in the oven just a few minutes longer. But other than that it was great!

I set out to make chewy sugar cookies -- chewy was a requirement. This recipe delivered! Excellent texture, flavor, and the chew is undeniable. My granddaughter wanted to put some sugar designs on the cookies for Christmas. So we broke from the recipe and rolled a small portion of the dough out about 1/4" thick, cut some cookies from the dough, put sugar designs on them, and baked them as the recipe is written. Don't do this! With this recipe, the cookies spread out way too much! They got HUGE! And thin. And lost a lot of their chewy-ness. The rest of the dough, we returned to the recipe which says to create dough balls, roll them in the sugar, and bake. When we followed the instructions, the cookies came out thick and chewy and delicious! I wanted to mention this because if you try to roll the dough, the cookies come out much different than promised. Otherwise, these are a winner! I will definitely make these again. Oh, and we made some snickerdoodles from some of the dough as well and they turned out perfectly! Great recipe.

These are the perfect sugar cookie for me. I always use butter and they just melt in your mouth. I like to add fun colored sugar sprinkles after they come out of the oven.

The recipe was a success, and it turned out crispy. I did change the recipe a bit, adding butter instead of margarine, and adding less sugar. The cookies then turned into scone-shaped instead of cookie-like. Even though mine looked nothing like the ones in the picture, they still had a great texture and were a bit crispy. Good recipe!

Maybe I did something wrong because the cookies came out flat and too chewy. I could not get them off the cookie sheet!  I may try it again once I buy another mixer. My boys were very disappointed:(

This recipe is tastes just like the sugar cookies at Subway!  I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and chilled in the fridge overnight, wrapped in plastic like the video recommends.  Keeping it cool helps you to work with the dough.  Just make sure you put the dough back into the fridge between batches and work fast, LOL!

I also cooked them at 375 degrees for 12 minutes.  Yes, they're sticky.  I used a tablespoon (that makes them the perfect size) to form the balls, dropping it into the sugar before trying to make a ball out of them.  Otherwise, I would have had a sticky mess.  They make nice round balls once coated in sugar.  Once in the oven, they fatten out nicely to become the picture perfect holiday cookie!  Enjoy!

This came out like a batter.  No way it could be rolled into balls.  Added more flour to see if that would help and it didn't.  Threw it all away and not trying again.

I sifted the flour, used softened butter and room temperature eggs, then chilled the dough un the fridge for 3 hours before rolling it into balls, rolling them in sugar and then baking them. My boyfriend and i LOVED them. His co-workers even asked if they could pay me to make batches for them.

These are so yummy! I added a half cup more of flour and left the batter in the fridge over night. I used an ice cream scooper since I wanted them to be a good size and baked them for about 18 minutes. Will use this recipe from now on- thanks!!

No changes from recipe.  They fell apart when trying to remove them from my baking sheet.  They taste good I might add.  Just don't like the consistency.

While a nice touch to the  traditional sugar cookie, it wasn't overly impressive.  IT was hard within minutes and had a rather bland taste.

Gave as Christmas Gifts and all said they were delicious and wanted more.  Just the right crunch outside, yet soft and chewy on the inside.

A  little difficult at first, I had to mix in an extra cup of flour, but at the end  they were tasty and cute cookies. I decided to put a kick of holiday in it, so I added red  and green sand sprinkles.

Just a tip. Instead of following the written recipe, watch the video. The video gives you the knowledge on everything you need to know about the cookies. I gave it four stars because at first I didn't know that the video would be a better tool, and based of the written recipe, the cookies were alright. After I watched the video, the errors from the previous batch were fixed in the new one. So always watch the video recipe on any recipe on this site, its usually better and more helpful.

The 2nd recipe of sugar cookies, I try in the same week and definitely the favorite one. The only change I made was using butter instead of margarine. 
These spread alot during baking, so make sure you don't flatten the dough balls too much, just a little " pat ", to keep the balls still when moving the cookie sheet to the oven.
For my 1st batch, I rolled the cookie balls in white decorating sugar. That made the cookies too crunchy on the outside. The 2nd batch, I rolled them  in regular granulated sugar and that was better.

These are really yummy (the snickerdoodle option as well). Only caveat is you need an additional half cup of flour to prevent flattening. Otherwise perfect

Super good! It was my first time making them and they came out perfect! I used my hands to mix everything together and obviously, my hands were well washed and clean. Best way to not have your hands super sticky is to spray cooking oil over them so when you roll them into a ball, they don't stick!

Really really easy to make. Great little cookies to make and have for a little treat. Not sure why so many 1 star reviews but this was a simple cookie recipe to make. My only comment is my cool time was about 15min at 350 but not a big deal.

Super yummy and super quick to make.  Made 2 dozen with my kitchen aid and cleaned everything up in like an hour. I have made these for pot lucks, always a hit. I use softened butter and a cookie scoop strait on to the sheet.  They come out flat, but stay soft for days. I sprinkle colored sugar on them for the holidays. I could eat the whole batch of dough. I usually hate when people ruin cookie dough by cooking it, but the cookies come out as good as the dough,so they rock!

I have gone through several sugar cookie recipes and this is by far the best.  The only thing I did different was add 1/2 cup more of sugar. The dough was too wet to roll so I spooned it on my cookie sheet.  I baked them a little longer because I like crunchy cookies and they were perfect when they were done.  They were sweet and crunchy.  This is definitely my new recipe for cookies.  I love them!!

Wonderful recipe.  Makes up easy and rolls into nice balls after being in the fridge over night.  I rolled the balls in a cinnamon/sugar mixture and also I rolled them in edible gold glitter as well as multi color balls.  Smiles.  Making again today.

This recipe makes the best chewy, yet crunchy (outside) cookies!! My only issue with it, is that following the recipe, the batter is not firm enough to roll into balls. I usually stick it in the freezer for an hout or so. You could also gradually add a bit more flour until you reach the desired consistency.

Made exactly as per recipe, using parchment paper over a cookie sheet - tried rolling into balls, gave up and used teaspoon to ladle out small chunks and dusted with colorful sugar. Pulled a flat sheet of warm sugar bread from the oven 11 minutes later. These cookies will never be round. You can use a cookie cutter on them AFTER you bake them. A trend in the five star reviews seems to always be replacing margarine with butter, maybe that fixes it, who knows. I took the other half of the "cookie batter" and added maybe 2 1/2 more cups of flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder until it became dough, some almond extract and two capfuls of black spiced rum to fix the flavor, and a dusting more of flour to aid in making walnut shaped balls like the original recipe. Proceeded to flatten slightly and dust with red and green sugar crystals and cane sugar. Baked this new recipe for thirteen minutes at 350, they never browned up, but became real cookies and lost the ridiculous sweetness. Really, you could have just said "The true recipe was inside you the whole time, all you had to do was believe! (and combine flour, eggs, sugar, margarine, baking powder, and aim for a dough-like consistency)"

Hey! This stuff is tasty! Add yourself a 1/4 cup of flour, up to a 1/4 cup if you still find it runny. Don't roll the ball, shape it, and then drop it in the sugar.  Baking for 12-14 works perfectly. Take them out when you think they might be done- 'cause they are donnnnee! I recommend a thin layer of pam-coconut oil spray if you encounter sticking. That will guarantee a slippery surface and a barely browned cookie.

Very nice cookie! I had to add almost double the four though, otherwise it was too sticky. I operate a home catering business, so I weight out my flour, and I had to use 1.5 lbs of flour (about 4 cups) to get a nice dough. It was easy to roll into balls and tastes great!

The first time that I made this recipe, it came out, well... not the best. After trying this recipe again a few times(and tweaking it to my preferences,) it has come to be my most favorite dessert recipe! I love these cookies, as they are soft and chewy on the inside, and crispy on the edges. I'm only 12, and these cookies have shown to be extremely easy and fun to make, as well as delicious! All my friends and family love these, and I definitely recommend that you give them a try!

SO simple--way faster than rolling cookie dough! I use a cookie scoop for these instead of rolling into balls, and that works well if you've refrigerated the dough for an hour or so. However, as many other reviews have said, you will most likely need to ADD EXTRA FLOUR. That is the only reason that I am deducting a star, because they really are great cookies, but I can't make them work without adding at least another 1/2 c. of flour. Hope that helps!

I made these and yes, they were a little sticky and unable to roll into balls; who cares? I just patted them into little circles and put white sugar on top. . I have to say that i have tryed many sugar cookie recipes in the past and this is by far the best ever...I didnt have any type of flavoring to use so i added real lemon juice a.k.a the kind in the green bottle about 2tbsp to the mixture and it gives it just a hint of lemon. The cookies were huge sized and tasted even better the next day; also this recipe makes quite a few cookies and we were still eating and enjoying them 7 days later and they were still a hit; just a hint of crispiness and chewy goodness. yes, i will be adding this to my list of fave easy sugar cookies to make......try them you wont be disappointed.

AWESOME COOKIES! Made with my 3 year old and as someone else stated "this recipe is kid proof". I tweaked the recipe and they came out perfect. We used butter instead of margarine, and we added 1/2 cup more of flour (or maybe 3/4 cup,  I had a 3 year old helper). I did not chill the dough before we cooked at 375 for 10-12 minutes. The sides did not brown,  but the bottom did. We rolled the dough in sprinkles instead of sugar. The cookies were crunchy around the edges with a soft chewy center. This will be my go to recipe from now on.

I have made this recipe over 20 TIMES!!! Family and friends request these cookies on a regular basis. Make sure to roll the cookie dough balls in sugar before baking. It's very important for a good texture.

These  came out fantastic!  I made them a little bit larger for the kids. I just baked them for a few more minutes. It's the perfect combination of chewy and crunchy. They were easy to make and even the kids enjoyed making them.

Fantastic recipe. 

I've occasionally had to add a few extra tablespoons of flour (and that was my bad for using slightly melted butter) but other than that the cookies turn out exactly as expected - flat, chewy, with a crisp edge and softer center. 

I'm not in love with the video, those cookies are ugly and a bad representation in my opinion, all mine have turned out like the recipes main picture. I always roll mine into balls, drop them in sugar, and use a glass, never fingers, to flatten them on the pan and they come out in perfect circles. 

As for the people who rated low saying it was like cake batter....what did you use? Butter or margarine? You've GOT to use butter, margarine is far to loose for a good cookie but i'm seriously perplexed as to how anyone ended up with cake batter unless they added more liquids to it that aren't in the recipe.

** Fun tip, omit rolling them in sugar and they are a great cookie for frosting as well :) (too sweet if rolled in sugar and too plain if not rolled in the sugar OR frosted)

These ended up super thin and a little too sweet.  My sound loved them but they're not what I expected.  I made them with butter since I don't use margarine, I balled them and put them in the fridge overnight, but they were very thin and very sweet.

They didn't turn golden brown after 8 minutes, nor yet by 10..  15 minutes in my regular, ordinary oven at 350 and they came out much better.  I also noticed that the dough was *very* sticky, and extremely difficult to roll into balls, and very messy to work with.  To combat this, next time, I will refrigerate my dough for probably an hour to an hour and a half before attempting to work with it- I'm assuming the butter in the dough got too warm to properly work with.  If that doesn't work, I'll add more flour, a tablespoon at a time, until it's more easily handled.  I also dusted my hands in the rolling sugar between each attempt, to keep the dough from sticking to my hands as much.  There's a little much vanilla in this recipe for my liking, I'll probably reduce it down to 1 tsp next time I make it, and I'll look for a coarser sugar to coat them with, as mine was pretty fine.  All in all, a decent recipe- I just have picky eaters =)

I followed the directions PERFECTLY,  I don't know how anyone would actually be able to roll this mixture into a walnut size balls? The dough was like cake batter! I finally just poured cookie size shapes of the "batter" onto the cookie sheet and baked...they all joined as one big flat cookie and stuck to the sheet! I tried another batch...same thing. I tasted some of the cooked goo...it kind of resembled a sugar cookie flavor

If  I were to make these cookies again, I would add two eggs instead of three.  They where a little too eggy.  Over all, they where not to bad.

Not sure what went wrong with this one. I too had the same problem with the cookies sticking to the pan. I should have figured when the dough was like cake batter.  I consider myself an experienced baker.  I typically use butter so the only thing I can figure is the temperature of the margarine maybe, mine was slightly softened. Novices, please don't be discouraged by this recipe. I'm glad it worked out for some. Unfortunately, I was not one of them.

I would have to change this recipe. Even after 1/2 hr. In the refrigerator it was still very sticky and loose. You had to pour it in a container.  I would ask for you to revise this.

So it's pretty common sense to add more flour if the batter is thin. I followed a comment to add a half a cup more and they're perfect! They were gone in two days. Super easy to make and delicious! I do refrigerate mine for 30 minutes before I bake them. I feel it makes them thicker and chewy-er!

This is an average tasting sugar cookie. The "dough" was very runny and I had to add a cup of extra flour in order to keep it from spreading into an inedible mess. Even after adding the extra flour the "dough" was closer to a batter that had to be spooned onto the baking sheet.

These cookies are SNACKTASTIC!! I did take the advice of  another Baker from the comments and added the extra 1/2 cup of flour, which made the cookies alot thicker but still a very traditional cookie flavor and texture. The second time I made these (which was in the same week) I only had Parkay Butter Spread, and the  cookies where even BETTER!! ??

These would not roll into a ball and just felt like a 'meh' recipe.  I picked these thinking margarine would be good - but really, sugar cookies should have butter - my mistake. They weren't sweet at all.  I agree with one of the posters that said 1/2 cup of flour would have helped.  When I took them out of the oven for 5 minutes, after 5 minutes they instantly hardened.  Something isn't right about this recipe.

These are the best sugar cookies I've ever baked! I subbed a 1/2 c brown sugar into the cookie to add depth of flavor and covered them with a cream cheese icing. So decadent!

I made this recipe the first time going directly by the recipe, and they ended up paper flat and tasted terrible. I had to throw it all out, and I started completely over.  The second time, they came out perfect. The change I made was that I used baking POWDER instead of what is called for, which is baking SODA. The baking soda made the cookies taste acidic and made them flatten. The baking powder made them taste a million times better, and they were normal cookie size and height. I'm not sure if it was a mis-type to put baking soda instead of baking powder, but I will tell you now to substitute the baking soda for baking powder, otherwise, they will turn out awful.

This tasted like cream corn.The cookies would stick to our fingers & wouldn't roll into balls. Even the dog, that eats anything would not touch it.Wish I could give a no star, as this was awful.NEVER AGAIN

Made these cookies raising my kids.  20 yrs later I couldn't remember the measurements.  I searched for yrs for the right recipe but they never turned out right.  I've made this recipe 3 times in the past 2 weeks.  Half sugar/half snickerdoodle.  Can't get enough of them.  Especially when they're right out of the oven. Thank you so much!

Absolutely terrible. Followed directions to the T. Should have cut down, 2 1/2 stick of margarine was way too much, and should have chilled doe. Paper thin cookies that stuck to the pan and could NOT get off. Don't fallow this recipe to the T or you will be highly disappointed and pissed for wasting time and money.

In looking at previous reviews I cut a 1/2 cup of sugar and added a 1/4 cup of flour a tap of almond extract. I also chilled the dough for about an hour. The cookies were light and fluffy.

I've had to make these for a party my class held before, and they loved them. I've made these for my family reunion and everyone loved them. The cookies are easy to make and a quick clean up as long as you don't spill the flour ;). But I love recommending these to people and everyone that's had it recommended loved them too!

The dough came out very sticky. I could roll into a ball and roll in sugar. Had to scoop dough with teaspoon. Sprinkle some sugar on the place where the dough going to go to the bottom of the cookie will get sugar then after I put it on the pan sprinkle some sugar on top that's the only way I could do it because of the dough being sticky

I love this cookie. OK, nitty gritty obout this recipe. You MUST add 1 more cup of flour. A total of 3 3/4 cups. The butter MUST be softened before mixing with the sugar. To make sure the cookies are not flat, mix the dough until it looks like smooth pudding.  I chilled the dough in a gallon size storage bag for 1 hour.  (I always chill my cookies in a bag so I can just cut a corner of the bag to form cookies.) OK, more nitty gritty, you MUST WORK FAST!!  Once you- (squeeze ping pong ball size balls)- from bag , IMMEDIATELY roll in Sugar in the Raw Sugar. The cubes of regular sugar are too small. Then place on parchment paper. More  nitty-gritty, I roll ping pong size balls, baked at 350° for 30 minutes.

I will definitely make this recipe again sometime. These cookies  are DELICIOUS! What I did was put pieces of chopped up starburst and taffy in the middle of the cookies. Put the starburst in the cookies before you bake, and right after you pull them out of the oven, put the taffy in.

My friends and co-workers loved these.  I do have to say they looked like cow pies even after adjusting for elevation (over 6000 ft) and they were really buttery.  
To fix for this I added around an extra cup of flour and they look like the picture and taste just as good (I think better).  Essentially I had to add butter until it was possible to roll into balls since following the recipe made for super sticky dough.

This recipe was a challenge for me, in that it was difficult to complete without consuming the ingredients beforehand - the dough was very, very sticky and I ended up frustratingly eating most of it during the ball-rolling process. Nevertheless, it was a delicious experience, and the cookies I did manage to bake turned out absolutely yummy!

As my old cooking teacher once said with most baked goods you do need to edit the amount of flour dependent on your climat. I needed to add a whole extra cup of flour to get the consistency needed to roll it into little balls. The bigger the cookie the more likely it ended up being perfect. I did try out making smaller ones and they just ended up being crunch and not what I wanted. The sugar on the outside of the cookie is more optional then nesasary.

These cookies were amazing! They took a super short time to bake and were super easy. The only substitute i made was switching the margarine out for butter and it still tasted de-lish. I would highly recommend this recipe for people with a sweet tooth and that like quick and easy desserts.

I cut the recipe in half for smaller batch. And I didnt roll into balls, oops. But i dropped by spoonfuls and sprinkled with sugar and they are very good.Would have been prettier and more uniform if I would have followed the recipe and roll into balls. Very yummy!

Great flavor. I ended up adding more flour, as I rolled the dough out to use cookie cutters, and the dough was too soft... I'd make this again.

Definitely will add some lemon zest next time to  minimize the "eggy" flavor. I had to put the  dough in the freezer between batches too  sticky to roll (could be the tropical Amazon weather  - I live in Suriname -)

Great recipe! I've made it twice now, and great results. I'd suggest refrigerating 20-30 minutes before rolling. It helps make it less sticky. :)

I followed the recipe and ended up with pasty, sticky dough. I couldn't roll the cookies into balls. I added more flour, but the "dough" was still impossibly sticky. Waste of my time!

These are easy to make and taste delicious. My 9-year-old daughter made them all by herself and they turned out great. She used butter instead of margarine and softened it. Like other reviewers noted, they are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside...perfection!

These are amazing!  Not only did we roll in cinnamon sugar, but we also added coffee grounds into the mix for the second batch, and OHMIGOD they were to die for!  We've also done this recipe with whole wheat flour and brown sugar, and those are an awesome healthy-ish twist but just as good :)  So many ways to customize...  But we have found that putting the dough in the refridgerator for a bit (20-30 mins or so) before portioning it out makes it much easier to handle.

Really good - the only change I made was to use butter rather than margarine. On some of them I added some crushed walnuts. And 9 minutes it the perfect amount of time to cook them.

I did make some changes with the recipe the first thing was instead of margarine I used canola oil and it tasted fine. When ever I placed it on the cookie and baked it , it came out fine I guess the reason why it didn't stick was because of the canola oil. It wasn't bad but it wasn't fantastic

Loved it! I use this quite often and it always is consistent. The only thing is that it slightly flattens but that is because I'm in high altitudes. Over all, one of the best recipes I've used.

Best sugar cookie recipe I've found, I've made this recipe over and over again and the cookies always come out perfect. Even the dough is delicious-100% would recommend to anyone:)

I don't turn on the convection for this recipe, having found that they turn out softer this way(though it takes longer to bake). I also add 1/2 -1 cup extra flour at the end for rolling. I sometimes also add a sprinkle of cinnamon to the bit of sugar I roll the dough balls in before setting to bake (strictly because I love cinnamon)

Dough way too runny, after first batch flopped, added more flour, that batch flopped, added a lot more flour, and finally got a bath to bake, but cookies expanded like chocolate chip cookies, so they didn't keep shape.

I made these cookies with my son and he gave them two thumbs up!  We made 1/2 of them sugar and the other 1/2 Snickerdoodles.  Both are delicious!  After mixing up the dough, I was a little concerned that the consistency didn't seem quite right, but they came out great.  Happy Baking :-)

These cookies were delicious. They were very chewy and soft. The only thing I didn't do was cool the cookies in sugar i just rolled them into balls, flatten them a little then sprinkled a little bit of sugar and added fun colored sprinkles. This is a fabulous recipe and a big hit in my family.

Something seems off in the measurements of this recipe.  It was more the consistency of cake batter than a cookie.  I added 1/5 more cups of flour to get it to a 'rolling consistency' and still did not achieve that.  It is more like a drop sugar cookie.

While searching for the best sugar cookie recipe, I've made 3 different sugar cookies from this site- including the cracked sugar cookies- and this recipe is by far my favorite.  The dough is easy to work with and it produces a chewy cookies that reminds me of Subway/Otis Spunkemeyer cookies.  My husband, who takes his role as a test-taster very seriously, said we could stop looking for a perfect sugar cookie after this one.

I used salted butter instead of margarine because it was what I had.  I also let the butter come to room temperature. I believe room-temperature butter causes the cookies to spread more- but I loved the thinner cookies.  My friend swears all cookies taste better with Parkay margarine.

I did bake these cookies one 2 different baking sheets which (unbeknownst to me) required 2 very different cooking times.  One sheet came out fluffy- the other came out super thin.  I actually LOVED the thin cookies because they tasted like sugar cookie dough straight from the container.  So- give consideration to what type of pan you are using when you bake.  On one pan they baked 9.5 minutes, but on the other pan it was closer to 12.

I also chilled the dough in between batches and the later batches had a better texture- I am guessing this corrected my "room temperature butter" issue.

I gave it 4 stars because the texture was not perfect, but the taste was exactly what we wanted.  I may play around with more flour. adding baking powder with the baking soda, and higher t

I halved the recipe but still ended up with 30 regular sized cookies.   The original recipe must result in enormous cookies.   I was craving snickerdoodles, so I rolled them in a cinnamon sugar mixture.   Several people said they tasted like cinnamon toast crunch cereal.   These cookies were so tasty!!!

I used cold butter instead of margarine and  I didn't experience any problems with the dough. It was very easy from start to finish and the cookies turned out perfectly crispy and chewy. I always prefer my  cookies a little more browned than recipes call for but these are better (both in taste and texture) without any browning -- about 10 minutes in the oven is truly all it needs. 5 stars!

This is a great recipe. These cookies are wonderful. It is now one of my favorites to make. I change up the cooking time to adjust the crispiness 8 minutes makes the perfect chewy cookie, 9 minutes makes the bottom slightly crispy and 10 minutes makes a crunchy cookie. All version taste wonderful. I do half of the recipe as the yield is very high on the full recipe. I also add just a dab more vanilla maybe 1/4 teaspoon. I have made these at least 10 times.

This was my first foray into sugar cookies. I didn't have enough sugar to I had to adjust the recipe as needed. I baked for 15 minutes. I also decided on  the snickerdoodle suggestion in the header. And man are these delicious! Just perfect, crunchy outside chewy inside. Will make these again!

The resulting batter was incredibly thin. Could roll this into a ball. Even with extra flour, the dough was impossibly sticky, too.

I followed instructions word for word but they ended up more like the tops of muffins. Fluffy, not chewy. I couldn't really taste much but at least they were edible. Last sugar cookie recipe I tried, the batch ended up tasting like butter. So this wasn't too bad, just not what I expected.

These were good! My dough was extremely sticky almost a batter so I spooned mine out with a small scoop and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. They are already very sweet so it didn't take much. You do not want to overbake these, 9 minutes was plenty unless you want a crisper cookie.

They taste amazing but they didn't cook very well. They took over 20 minutes and they were still white as ghosts, uncooked in the middle, and flat. I put non-stick cooking spray on the baking sheet and the bottoms still stuck to it.

lol! The first time I made these they smelled like popcorn and we're horrible, and yes, I cooked them right. Watched the video to find out that you must refrigerate it for 30 minutes before making balls. Now, they are so irresistible I have to make a batch every day in order for me to try one before the whole family eats it all! It's so delicious!

Flavor-4 1/2
Ease-2
Extremely sticky, unable to roll into a ball, much less roll in sugar. This is even after putting the dough in to chill for a while. For my second tray, I spooned dough onto a sheet, flattened a bit with moistened fingers (otherwise can't flatten, dough just sticks to hands), and sprinkled sugar on top.  Put sheet in freezer for a few minutes bc first tray spread completely together. Guess what...so did the second batch, just not as badly.
So disappointing when a recipe doesn't work as stated.  Won't be taking any of these to work as planned.

This is my go to sugar cookie recipe. The dough is delicious just raw and cooked. The finished product is soft and chewy. Make sure you keep a close eye on them while they are cooking - they are better uncooked than overcooked.

These cookies were so amazing!!! They tasted like vanilla cake! The only downside to these cookies was that My dough was a little too sticky to start rolling in sugar so I stuck it in the fridge for a little while and the dough hardened up a bit so I could roll with ease, but they warmed up quickly so I just went back and forth spraying my hands with cooking spray to atop the stickiness. But besides from that, these were the best sugar cookies I've ever tasted. Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside! Pure perfection!

I personally loved this recipe, It had a nice chewy taste. Although it was not very flavorful my family and I loved it and will be making it again. I cooked the cookies a little over the given time and didn't really get to much of the crunchy on the outside but over all it was a really good cookie! : )

I used butter instead of margarine which while baking filled the air with this incredible buttery fragrance. You can taste the butter as well. Will definitely make this again!!

These are the best cookies I've ever made! Like some comments have mentioned, the recipe doesn't say to chill the dough. If you watch the video, it tells you to do it though. I chose to make snickerdoodles instead of just sugar. I also baked them for 10 minutes rather than 15, as another review suggested. They came out perfect!  My 2 year old was trying to sneak in the kitchen and steal some when I wasn't looking! We can't get enough.

This is an excellent recipe for chewy sugar cookies. Simple and sweet. I do suggest that the dough is chilled for at least 15 minutes before using it. It makes it less sticky and easier to roll. I rolled mine in McCormack Cinnamon sugar and I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour mixture. Man oh man did these cookies come out delicious.

Good cookie but did not stay soft in the middle and did not raise up when baking.  Finial cookie was crisp on the outside but not soft  inside. Tried different cooking times, didn't seem to make a difference.

Do you melt the butter or leave it solid? I melted it and  poured the batter it into a flat pan I rubbed down with butter and it was a thin fluffy cake. Just sprinkles sugar on top and my daughter loves them! They stay so moist!

Strongly recommend using  Pam or baking spray. They stick really hard to the cookie sheet.

For around the holiday's, I recommend adding about tablespoon of peppermint extract to make it all minty. I also added crushed candy canes as a topping. CHILL THE DOUGH before actually placing into the oven.  Makes it less sticky so you can cut them into shapes

I really liked this recipe. It was a fast and simple recipe to follow. However,  I had a very hard time rolling the dough in to balls. I added 1/2 cup of flour in hopes to thicken it. It did not work. I then decided to put the dough in the freezer for about 8 minutes and was then able to roll them up. (Kept putting the dough back in the freezer in between batches) also rolled dough in vanilla sugar! DELICIOUS.

I cut it in half and had to add almost the original full amount of flour and they were STILL like thick cake batter. They would not roll at ALL.

I read the reviews of this cookie before trying it out. I saw all the complaints about the sticky dough. I was thinking this recipe is a hit or miss, or something isn't right about the recipe the way it is written. When I first made this dough I had the same sticky results. I was disappointed and thought I had wasted my time and ingredients. However, when I reread the recipe I saw where I use "BAKING POWDER" instead of BAKING SODA" as called for in this recipe. When I made the recipe again with the baking soda, I got much better results. I was able to roll the cookies in a ball. Make sure you are using baking soda and not baking powder. Happy Baking!! :-)

These were very simple and easy and quick to make. My family can be very picky or choosy and everyone loved these.   Some members of the family do not like things that are real sweet so I did not roll them in the extra sugar before baking them.   They turned out perfect.

I must admit; the few low ratings that this recipe received had me a little worried. Coupled with what I was looking at after I had finished mixing all of the ingredients, "little" was a bit of an understatement... I freaked! I just knew it wouldn't be right and that I had just wasted everything that went into it, time included! So, hoping for the best, I took advice from a few if the positive reviews and threw it in the fridge for about 30 minutes. It looked a little better after that, but I still was a little skeptical. I ended up doing 2 test cookies... came out STELLAR! I have NO IDEA what the low raters were doing wrong, but it had to be something because the rest came out just as perfect as the test cookies. Other than the refrigeration (and softening the margarine), I followed the recipe exactly. NOT disappointed. DEFINITELY going in the recipe box. Thanx a lot!

Good taste,  but the dough was very sticky and even after chilling it, the dough SPREAD in the oven.  I suspect the OP may use the scoop-straight-out-of-the-bag method of measuring flour.  I used the spoon-into-the-measuring-cup-and-level method of measuring the flour. I also used butter instead of margarine.  I will probably use another recipe when the occasion calls for cookies.

This is hands down the best Sugar Cookie recipe I have ever tried. I loved that I didn't have to use the rolling pin. They are absolutely delicious even after a week they are still yummy! I did it with my grandchildren and they had a lot of fun rolling them into balls and handing them to me so I could roll them in the sugar. Thank you!

I didn't like this recipe.  The cookies came out paper thin and overly sweet instead of buttery.  I even tried baking a batch without flattening them but still the same horrible result.  I couldn't even get my two boys to eat them because they said they were too sweet.  I will never use this recipe again.

To everyone complaining that it can't be "rolled out"... I don't remember this being a "rolled sugar cookie" recipe... Pretty sure its just regular sugar cookies. And they're delicious. I added about a half a cup more of both sugar and flour, as I like my cookies really sweet... and the dough was pretty runny, even after chilling...

If i could give it a smaller rating than 1 star than I would. These were absolutely terrible. The batter was good but you couldn't roll them into a ball like they said and when you baked them they were really flat and boring. VERY DISAPPOINTED

I didn't use margarine, and instead used 1 cup of butter and did not use the extra sugar at the end. I personally really enjoy these cookies, but they do come out very flat and burn quickly. When I baked a batch at 6 minutes they turned out chewy and soft, and at 7 minutes they burned. I did make my cookies a smaller than recommended, thus baked them for less. But depending on how you want your cookies bake them at different times and check on them often. Overall still good cookies and I will continue to use this simple recipe.

I definitely had to tweak this recipe quite a bit. The first thing was I had to add an extra cup of flour. When I originally made the recipe the batter was more like cake batter not like cookie batter at all. I also added an extra teaspoons of vanilla to give it more flavor. I don't know if the amount of flour was a typo in this recipe but you definitely need more than this recipe calls for.

I kept forgetting to by sugar cookie dough or mix and finally just decided to try some from scratch. This recipe is easy and uses ingredients most people who bake have on hand.

I was visiting a relative who doesn't do much cooking. When I tested this recipe, I did not have access to measuring cups or spoon...or a mixer!!!

Surprisingly, though, they came out perfectly. This will be my go to sugar cookie from now on.

I added a frosting/glaze and colored sugar, but they were buttery (I used butter instead of margarine) and delicious without the addition.

I modified this recipe based on the bad reviews and only added 1 cup of butter instead of the 1 1/4 cup of butter and I think this makes all the difference in getting a really good chewy sugar cookie. I also added 1/4 tsp almond extract to my cookies. They turned out perfectly chewy and crisp.

I absolutely loved these cookies! I did however follow the advice of other reviewers an used butter instead of margarine as well as adding 1/2 cup extra flower. After mixing I put the dough in the freezer for 20 min. When the top layer is semi hard I rolled the dough and used parchment paper not only for easy clean up but the cookies don't spread too much if you don't put them on a hot cookie sheet. Then the dough goes back in the freezer until I'm ready to put in another batch. That solves the complaints about sticky dough and cookies spreading too much. I made a double batch and frosted, rolled in cinnamon sugar, and decorated with sprinkles. The kids and I had a great time making these!

These are fantastic! This is the recipe I will forever use for Snickerdoodles, and they're awfully cute dressed in green crystal sugar for Christmas as well.

The cookies were delicious...but I was irritated that I spent so much time adjusting.The dough was too wet to form into ball. I added a lot more flour and about 1/4 tsp baking powder to the recipe to get the dough to the consistency I felt was needed.

Delicious! Best sugar cookie ever. I did about 3 cups of flour instead because I was hoping to be able to roll it immediately without refrigerating but I still had to refrigerate. My biggest mistake was that I didn't save the recipe so I ended up using another one tonight because I couldn't find this one and it does not even compare to this recipe. And now here I am, I found it. And it's saved!

These didn't come out quite right when I made it exactly like the recipe says, my batter was a little on the runny side and sticky so it was hard to roll into balls. I did change it up a bit and added about 1/2 - 1 cup more flour and added a little bit of cinnamon to the batter. Instead of white sugar, I rolled my dough in Sugar in the Raw cane sugar and when I placed it on the baking sheet, I did not flatten it a bit like the recipe says. My sugar cookies came out perfectly and not as flat as it did when followed the recipe exactly. I think next time I might reduce the amount of sugar in it though because it's pretty sweet.

Very good!  They do spread out more then I expected.  I adjusted how many I put on the cookie sheet each time I put them in the oven.

These are our new favorite cookie!!!  Only change is that I used butter rather than margarine (I never use margarine).  Flavor, texture - amazing!  The only flaw, which is one all sugar cookies seem to share - since there's no brown sugar in the recipe they tend to go stale before the others.  But they're so good they don't last anyway!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Total flop. Cookie dough was not firm.  Cookies spread way too thin as they were baking and some had to be literally scraped off the cookie sheet.

These cookies are quite simply perfect. I have made them probably 50x and they steal the show wherever they go.  Everybody loves a good sugar cookie; the snickerdoodle option is also well received. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe except to specify that you *must* chill the dough before rolling into balls and placing on greased cookie sheet. I chill overnight but you need a good 3-4 hours or else, yes, the dough is too sticky to work with and your cookies will be very thin and stick to the sheet.  (I also add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.) Like others I too keep a reserve of dough in the freezer so I can make a batch with just a little notice.

The dough was very sticky. The first cookies spread terribly. I added more flour to subsequent pans and they were marginally better, but would never make again.

LOVED these. We used butter instead of margarine. We rolled some in brown granulated sugar. And to add a fun twist for my son's class, we added some M&M's before baking and sprayed with edible decorating paint.

Not only is this the best sugar cookie I've ever eaten but it is also the best cookie I've ever eaten. I followed the recipe as written except I rolled the dough balls in turbinado sugar instead of regular, white sugar. Don't overbake. Oh, I used butter instead of margarine. The only downside is that this cookie is not a long keeper. They are at their best the first and second day. I will never look for another sugar cookie recipe again.

Perfect!  I added a 1/2  tsp of lemon extract because I add lemon to everything. It came out crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside as promised.

I thought I'd try these. So far they are sticky there is no way I can roll them. I added some more flour hoping that would help but it didn't. I put them in the fridge, this as well didn't help. I just had to slop the batter on to the pan with a spoon. They did come out tasty but it was very frustrating trying to spoon this out. They are more flat and crisp on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside. I baked them for an extra 5 mins as well.

I only gave 2 stars because they dont taste too bad....but otherwise these are a negative 5 star cookie. This is NOT a rollable dough. I followed the recipe to a T and it was cake batter not cookie batter. I put in the fridge...no luck...still not rollable. So I added some more flour. Still no luck with 1 more cup added. They were not as sweet anymore but the dough still tasted ok. I added ANOTHER 1/2 cup of flour and it had finally started to stiffen enough to maybe roll them but I put them in the fridge to chill again because it was still not rollable I would suggest softened butter vs margarine. I would also recommend cutting down on the sugar but almost a cup. This will make them less liquid and firmer.....seriously disappointed!

They were delicious!! except for the amount of sugar, instead of rolling them in it before you bake, I dumped it in with the other 2 cups of sugar. Theyre delicious! I would most definitely make these again!

After mixing the ingredients together, I noticed that the dough looked more like cake batter.  The recipe says to roll the dough but it was entirely to runny.  After baking the first batch, I ended up adding an additional half cup of flour and a little cinnamon to the 2nd batch but the taste was still very bland.  Also, it is imperative to spray the baking sheet otherwise the cookies will stick to the pan.  I won't try this receipt again. : (

These cookies are extremely tasty, and very easy to make. The only reason I am giving it four stars, and this could be entirely my own error, is the dough turned out very runny. I could not roll them into balls as suggested and instead plopped them on cookie sheets hoping for the best. But, they still turned out amazingly and I can't wait to make them again!

I decided on a whim that I wanted cookies. I knew I didn't have any chocolate chips so I searched for a sugar cookie recipe and came across this recipe. It is absolutely amazing!! The only change I made was using butter instead of margarine. I didn't have any of the issues others have mentioned and didn't need to add extra flour. My husband can't stop raving about them and he isn't a sweets person. My sister and her boyfriend said they were beyond good. Will definitely be making these again.

I would like to say that this is my first attempt at making sugar cookies so my review may be a bit biased.  That being said, this was a very easy recipe to follow and the results were very good if I could give you 4.5 stars, I would. This is just what I was looking for in a cookie.  They were chewy, tasty, & not overpoweringly sweet which is the benchmark for a sugar cookie.  The sugar should compliment the other ingredients, not overpower any one over the other.  

I did do some things a little differently though, I used real, unsalted butter instead of margarine.  I ran out of vanilla after 1.25 Tsp, so I improvised with a little bourbon.  Next time I will put a bit more of the latter in there to see how if it provides another layer of flavor I think a quality dark rum would be nice as well.

Like some of the reviewers, this batter is a bit sticky but gets the job done.  Of note, if it turns out too dry or too runny, you did something wrong.  My first batch I followed to a T and they were rather flat, the second batch I flattened only half of the dough balls and the results were not too different.  The ones I did not flatten were slightly thicker than the ones I did.  I ran it through my gas oven for 9 minutes so a plus or minus 1 minute could affect your results.

I followed the directions completely, however the dough was incredibly sticky, so much so that I was unable to roll it at all. I added extra flour and no matter how much extra I added, it was still incredibly sticky and unuseable.

Have never seen dough so runny, I added at least one more cup of flour, but still on the runny side,, I ended up spooning it on the cookie sheet and then sprinkle sugar on them, No way could I have rolled them into a ball, Will prob not try them again. Oh,, but they tasted ok, just needed more sugar on them.

For whatever reason they came out extremely flat and spread out. The flavor was good though.

Seriously?  This is a pretty bad recipe.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to roll the dough.  It is a sticky, mucky mess.  I had to chill it between each batch just to be able to form something similar to a ball.  It is VERY oily and unpleasant tasting.  

Don't waste your time, folks.  This is a pass.

This was very easy and quick. I had a 4 year old helper and I'm pretty sure she could have done this on her own I love how you don't have to roll these out or refrigerate is for hours or overnight. I used butter rather than margarine as that's what I had. After I completed the dough I put it into the refrigerator while I preheated the oven. Between each batch I would also put it into the refrigerator while they cooked. I only cooked them for 11 minutes in a gas oven at 350. Just till the outer edges were a little brown. I left them on the pan for about 5 minutes before putting them on the drying rack. These do spread out a lot so be sure to space them. They were better than expected!They took awhile to set so they don't fall apart The center was still chewy and soft. Overall a great recipe.

It's great! I used butter instead of margarine. Also, my batter was pretty sticky. I chilled it, and then I greased my hands with cooking spray. This helped me roll them into balls and dip them into sugar. When the batter started warming up, I'd stick it back in the fridge for awhile. I used parchment paper on my cookie sheet as well. The cookies turned out wicked awesome!!!

Very delicious. There were a few problems while baking unfortunately. Even though I TRIPLE checked that I used all the ingredients and the correct amounts, they were still very creamy and couldn't roll into balls. After baking they stuck to the cookie sheet and the bottoms were ruined. :(

Made tons of delicious cookies! For one batch, I added cinnamon on top, and for the other batches, I rolled the dough in a mix of sugar and red sprinkles. Easy to make and easy to make your own :)

I must have done something terribly wrong... These were dry, crumbly, and did not melt or flatten out. Tried it in two batches, adding a bit more margarine in the second batch in an attempt to salvage it to no avail! T

These sugar cookies are NOT chewy what so ever, they were as soon as they came out of the oven, but once they cooled off, they were hard as a rock. Very bland, not impressed at all.

I made it exactly as the recipe is written and I took the note of not cooking them for more than 10mins. I didn't do the walnut size balls. I used an ice cream scoop which made the cookies bigger. I baked my bigger cookies at 11mins and they were Perfect! slightly golden on outside chewy center. I then took my Xmas cookie cutters and cut into the bigger cookies while they were still cooling. Makes it easier i think to have the perfect cookie and shape. Works me! :) they are delicious not overly sweet, my family and I enjoyed them. Can't wait to make more for friends and family.

The dough tasted good, and I even chilled it for a while because it wasn't stiff enough. Even with chilling the dough was super sticky. The cookies looked decent right out of the oven but within a few minutes they were totally flat. Huge disappointment, I will never make these again.

This recipe was a surprise and  a disappointment. I expected much more from such a high rated dessert, but I shouldn't expect too much from just random recipes posted by random people. To ensure the batter was a balanced temperature. I made sure every ingredient was room temperature - except the eggs. I held the eggs to a candle for a meager amount of time to make them slightly higher then room temperature. The temperature in the room when I made these was 66 degrees. They didn't mention the humidity range for these cookies either - another thing I was disappointed in with this recipe. You want to make sure you test the humidity before you even think about making these kinds of things. I suggest you all find yourself a psychrometer, they really come in handy. Moving on, you should preheat the over beforehand for a half hour. This is because most ovens lie when they say they are preheated. If you check the temperature and it isn't 350 degrees - you either need to get a new oven or you need to turn it up a hair and check it again. And just a tip - you should also get your hands on a leveling device. You have to have your oven on a very flat level surface for it to cook balanced. Once you measure all of the ingredients accurately (and possibly weigh them), mix them gradually ONE AT A TIME. The recipe did not stress this enough. Mix them for approximately 2 minutes and 32 seconds each. From my research, this is the ideal mixing time for ingredients like these. And make sure there

Entirely too sticky to even handle these cookies even after putting them in the fridgerator for 30 minutes after you make the dough it's still sticky the same as before I put them in the fridge plus they are so thin that you can't even get them off the pan.

I didnt experience any flatness as some have described.  Also I prefer soft cookies and found the texture was perfect and chewy.  

Unfortunately I only gave it 4 stars because it makes a GREAT SNICKER DOODLE(once you sprinkle with cinnamon).  However as a sugar cookie the flavor was odd - too rich (perhaps too much vanilla).  I should also note that I used butter rather than margin (just because it's natural).  This quite possibly could have affected the "richness" as well.  

I was looking for something similar to, but better than Pillsbury's.  Fortunately as I tried to save the batch t I experimented with a few things and found the cinnamon as the the perfect solution... 

Ultimately  if this recipe were titled Best Ever Snicker Doodle i would've given it 5 stars.

This is such a great recipe! Quick and simple to make. I didn't add the baking soda to my mixture so it turned out kinda light, like cake batter. So I just poured the batter into a cake ball pan and made COOKIE BALLS! :) They were such a big hit. 10/10 would make this again.

These cookies are very yummy. My family couldn't stop eating them. A little too sweet for me perhaps I rolled them in the sugar for too long. The dough is very wet after you combined all the ingredients. I wrapped it in saran wrap and left it in the fridge for about 2 hours before rolling them into a ball. I baked it about 10 min or till it's lightly golden. It's more crunchy than chewy.

I made this for my friends and they ask me all the time "when are we getting more cookies?"
They are delicious and chewy even if they are thin. Just watch if they are too thick they become hard as bricks the next day.

I just made these and can I just say WOW. I did change a few things which I hope can help anyone. I used 3 cups of flour instead of 2 3/4, I used organic sugar which is a better consistency, I used 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tarter, and instead of butter or chemical margarine, I used organic extra virgin unrefined coconut oil which is the same measure my as the butter. I used a kitchen aid mixer on med and my dough was absolutely perfect and didn't need to be chilled. These are so sweet and yummy, that on only rolled half in sugar and left half plain. I got a thick, crunchy outside with a chewy inside and no sticking to pan. I actually had to be careful to not have them slide off the pan. Love, love, love this cookie. Thank you all recipes.

Good cookies. Hits the spot for my sweet tooth. Flattened out while baking the first batch, so I'm chilling the dough for a couple hours. Hope it gets better!

Great recipe. The cooking time was off for me (took 12-15 mins) but this may be due to my aging oven and cookie sizes. Because my inconsistence in their sizes, the cookies'  doneness was varied, some well done and others soft, but all were equally chewy and tasty! The family loved them, and I would recommend this recipe for beginners especially!

These cookies were exactly what I was looking for.  They were crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  My children loved them and wanted me to make more.  I will definitely make them again.

Simple and wonderful.  I so not understand the negative feedback on the consistency of the dough, the only wet ingredient is 2 eggs, unless your using Ostrich eggs 2 1/4c flour is more than enough to make it a good dough.  Love the taste of the cookies.

It was an okay recipe, but I decided to tweek it a little bit. 1 cup white sugar + 1/2 cup brown sugar + 1/2 cup powdered/coffection sugar.  Half of the batch I added chopped pecans (just because both hubby and dad like nuts in their cookies). Chill the dough for an hour.  Then I rolled the balls into a 1/2 sugar  1/2 cinnamom combo.  Baking was about 10-11 minutes in my oven.   And always my trick....always work with a COOL  cookie sheet.  That keeps the cookie dough from melting while you are putting dough on the sheet.   And cool for 3-4 minutes before taking off the pan.

I could not roll into a ball and I followed recipe exactly, dough was way too sticky. I scooped dough out anyway so not to waste it and wasn't able to roll in sugar but they turned out ok.

These are delicious. Instead of white sugar, I used brown sugar, to make it more chewy. I kept the others same. I would totally make this again. And although I dislike sugar cookies, these tasted heavenly!

Since my oven only has 3 racks, and that are not all at the same level, thus not all cookies were able to get the same amount of heat, so a good way to even that out is to measure time deprecate lay for each rack. The cookies are very delicious

Very good and easy recipe.  I did not use all of the sugar in the recipe and did not roll them in sugar and they tasted great and were light and fluffy - not very chewy. I also had to use mostly natural cane sugar instead of white sugar for most of it, so it still turned out ok, but probably affected the texture.

There are a lot of different sugar cookie recipes that I like, and this is one of them! My 7 year old and I made them late one night together and she had a blast. We covered our hands in sugar to make the rolling easier and they came out soft and chewy. Would also make a great snickerdoodle cookie. The only difference is that I doubled the vanilla used. Thanks for the great recipe!

Pand half sugar half sugar cinnamon. We will see how this turns out adding little more flour.side note also good luck getting off pan.3rd pan looks pretty good.
4th turned out okay. 5th pan was rolled in Brown sugar white sugar mix.turned out well...over all not fan just the sugar ones. The snickerdoodle version is delicious. But don't think I'll make these again.

I made these, theyre good, but they spread about 3 times the size of the balls you roll so if you care about shape i would space them out a lot more than 2 inches.

These were really easy to make! They're best eaten soon after taking them out of the oven as they're crunchy and chewy all at once. After they cool down a bit, they're less chewy but still taste great nonetheless!

These cookies tasted really good, but  I only gave it 4 stars as they just don't roll into balls - the dough is way too sticky. The first few batches I had to just spoon the batter onto the cookie sheets and sprinkle the sugar on top. I put the rest of the batter in the fridge (as some other reviewers suggested) and they BARELY rolled into balls - with a very light touch and very cold hands. Having said that the result was not really any different than the ones I spooned onto the trays so I just went with that method for the remaining cookies. Once that annoyance was done with the cookies were very good, soft and chewy as advertised.

Ohhhh this is a keeper! Originally wanted a simple snickerdoodle recipe and stumble upon this one. I agree with adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour. After mixing the ingredients, I noticed how sticky the dough was. Extra flour and POOF! Perfect dough!! And THEN I read the reviews, lol! Excellent go-to recipe for easy classic yummy cookies! Thank you allrecipes.com for saving me again!

I liked this recipe, but I had to adjust the oven temperature to achieve the shape I wanted in my cookie, and I had to chill the dough before baking. I baked it at 375 and the results were much nicer for me.

I will very much make them again. To those that give it 1-4 stars, you guys are insane. I made 2 batches and my brother, mom, stepdad, and stepbrother loved them. So did I.

My family and friends loves these cookies! Know your oven and make sure you put the dough in the fridge to chill. It was so so easy that I also rolled my dough in cinnamon and sugar and I added a teaspoon of cinnamon extract to the dough and cut back on the vanilla for the Snickerdoodles. Don't forget to turn your cookie sheet the last 4 minutes.

Um, had to make with butter. 2 sticks. I'm just a butter girl. Also, for DH, rolled in pumpkin spice added to sugar cinnamon then flattened. The dough alone is delicious! Trader Joe's vanilla. MLK, mmm.... We don't do anything Halloween. But if someone knocks that day, this would definitely be quite the treat!

Very simple recipe just don't flatten your balls. When I flatted my dough balls before baking, they didn't come out the way i'd hope. On my next patch I just rolled my dough into balls and they came out perfectly :)

In the process of making these, I have run into the issue of very sticky soft dough. 

I've decided to refrigerate the dough and see if that will help to make it more pliable.  UPDATE:  After refrigerating for 2 days, the dough is still so sticky that it is unmanageable.  It is impossible to roll and the cookies wont stay on the sheet, instead choosing to stick to your fingers until to want to throw them against the wall and scream.  (OK, maybe a slight over-reaction, but seriously, this is dumb.)

Great simple recipe to keep in the bag of tricks. They go great with Ice Cream of course. Some tricks of the trade that need mention though are below.
>These cookies do not spread so you must flatten them to the desired shape prior to baking
> Freeze your butter and use a blender to cream together the egg, butter, and sugar results in much much chewier cookies.
>The finer the flour you use, the fluffier these cookies are. they also get much stickier.
>If the cookies are too sticky, dampen your hands then rub sugar on your hands then try again. They need to be slightly sticky to turn out right.

The dough was  all liquid so i couldnt roll into balls. But i used pre sifted flour so that could have been the problem added a little over a cup of flor to make right consistancy but haf to add more sugar too. I also used honey instead of vanilla since i didnt realize i was out of vanilla till time to add. They turned out great anyway. Yummy

These cookies were perfect!!  I tried a few other recipes until I found this one which is just what I was looking for.  I wanted a chewie sugar cookie comparable to Publix and this recipe is it.  I honestly think they are a bit chewier and prefer them over Publix sugar cookies.  Thank you for sharing!

I used organic flour instead of all purpose flour. They came out soft but chewy. I think the organic flour made a diffence in the texture of the cookie. I will try this again but with all purpose flour next time. The kids enjoyed them!

These were absolutely amazing! I was nervous to try because of the bad reviews but they turned out perfect. I used just regular butter instead of margarine.  The dough was barely sticky to the touch so I threw it in fridge while the oven preheated. My family couldn't get enough!

I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was not rollable. Had more of the consistancy of pancake batter. Spooned onto pan and while it was cooking the cookies completely flattened out onto each other......

I am really happy with these cookies, I have made them several times and they are a big hit with my family and coworkers. If you would like to also have the perfect lemon cookie, substitute the vanilla extract and add the same amount of lemon extract and about a teaspoon of lemon zest. Perfect every time!

Love these! Crispy outside, chewy middle! Used salted butter once by mistake, not bad is you like it salty but unsalted is best with 1/2 tsp of salt.

This cookie is so good! I cook them for 5 minutes, turn the pan around and cook them for an addition 5 minutes! I use a table spoon of cookie dough per cookie because I think it is a really good serving size! Yummy!

Definitely exactly what you would expect a sugar cookie to taste like! Super buttery and just delicious! I added heath milk chocolate toffee bits to the recipe. It's safe to say I'll be making them again! But maybe with butterfinger? Endless possibilities!!

I loved this recipe! It was simple and my younger sister and I had a lot of fun making them. The first batch we made came out a bit burnt so I experimented with the time and I found that ten minutes cooks them perfectly.

Great, my 3 and 4 year old girls wanted to make cookies from scratch and I must say this one was pretty easy to do with small kids. We didn't roll them into balls, instead we flattened them and used heart shaped cookie cutters, it made it more fun for them! Then we sprinkled sugar on top of them before putting them into the oven. I forgot on one batch though and sprinkled sugar on top just as I got them out while they were still hot and they turned out just the same.  Over all a really good recipe!

I replaced Margarine with Unsalted Butter, and replaced White Sugar with just a little less than called for brown sugar, and I added in a bit of cinnamon to the dry mix, they came out great. They were indeed very oily though due to the large amount of "margarine" used in them, but the came out just fine, delicious too!

I made these sugar cookies. They're delicious! This was the only good looking sugar cookie recipe I could find without baking powder, which was good for me because I don't have any at the moment. I added sprinkles while the sugar cookies was in the middle of cooking, and that turned out good. Overall, this was amazing.

This is perfect!  My 9 year old grandson assisted in measuring and mixing these and rolling the cookie balls and rolling in sugar!  Even a child can handle these.  I was out of sugar so I used Splenda and Spenda Brown mix, still came out perfect! Grandson and 13 year old brother scarfed down the first dozen immediately.  I agree with other reviews that these are done to perfection in only 9 or 10 minutes, just when the edges are slightly browned. I used parchment in one pan and silpat on another and no sticking at all!  I'll make these again and again!

These are sooo good and easy to make. My family and friends are lactose intolerant and so I used Crisco shortening instead. I added 2 tablespoons of water to make it the consistency of butter. I followed another post and kept the dough in the fridge for a few hours. The cookies came out round and beautiful. I also put the sugar into a grinder to make them finer but not as fine as icing sugar. I coloured the sugar in Spring colours and the cookies were perfect for Easter.

The cookies tasted just like what the description said, crisp and crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. It was my first time making sugar cookies and it tasted amazing :)

Dough is way too soft, can't form a ball or nothing with it.  Raw batter tastes better than cooked product.

I loved this recipe except for the fact they were hard to roll due to the stickiness.  From this recipe, I made snicker doodle cookies - by rolling them in cinnamon and sugar, and regular sugar cookies.  I also  sprinkled the sugar cookie with red sugar as well as mixed the red sugar into the rest of the batter.  Imagination goes a long way!  The cookies are very tasty, light, and delicious!

These were not crisp at all for me, but they have a pleasant chew to them. Not crisp on the outside at all despite adding in one tsp of cornstarch as someone else had suggested. I live in high humidity, but the dough was pretty easy to handle. Not sticky at all. My changes: used butter instead of margarine, added 1 tsp of cornstarch and cut back on the sugar- used only 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar. I added some cinnamon into the outer sugar coating to turn them into snickerdoodles. Perhaps I should have squished the dough balls thinner? The cookies didn't even spread very much for me! Maybe I'll squish them to 0.5cm thickness and bake longer next time, thinner cookies may be more crisp. UPDATE: after sitting around for a week, these dried out a bit and ended up being crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle, and even better than when I first made them!

The cookies came out flat. They were brittle and very dark at edges and raw on the center. The dough cannot be rolled as called for in the recipe. And they taste terrible. After the first time I made them and they came out so poor, I tried again with fresh ingriedients and followed the recipe exactly. Same thing. terrible

I did add a 1/2 cup extra flour, and, honestly, it could probably have used a bit more.  I put the dough in the freezer for a half-hour before rolling into balls.  I also had to bake for 15 minutes in my oven, rather than 10, and then let them sit on the pan for an additional five.  With those tweaks, I ended up with about 12 beautiful cookies (and a whole bunch of others that were ugly -- too much butter -- or too well-done or not quite well done enough).

Perfect except this recipe lacks cream of tartar, which I always think of as the key to great snickerdoodles. I added a teaspoon and these cookies were amazing!

I've never been much of a cookie baker but these cookies are fabulous. They come out very chewy with a firm edge. I followed the recipe and, fortunately, did not have the watery or sticky dough experience like others did nor did I refrigerate the dough. I used vegan butter (dairy allergy) and pastry flour as opposed to regular flour so maybe that made a difference. I also used an electric hand mixer, but I used it on the lowest setting and intently watched the batter to make sure I wasn't over mixing. I baked for 9 minutes. Things to watch out for. These cookies SPREAD when they bake. I wasn't expecting them to spread so much and ended up having to gently pull some apart when they were done, but they came apart fine. They also are a little greasy. Other than that, loved these and they satisfied my cookie craving. Definitely saving this recipe.

It came out the consistency of cake batter, not dough. I double checked all my amounts.  
I put the batter into the fridge for a while in the hopes that maybe as it gets cold it'll harden up. But I don't have much hope.

I followed everything and checked it one by one, and my cookies are completely flat and stuck on the tray right now. I didn't even have them in for the full 10 minutes...
And they taste like egg yolk.
I guess I still managed to mess it up.

My family and I love them. They are very good and can be rolled, dropped or spritz. I repeatedly caught my husband and son eating the dough when I turned my back to eat the dough without them seeing me. Ha ha ha ha ha. Margarine is pretty soft already and should be ready to use straight from the fridge. The recipe Doesn't say but I used butter that had been sitting out for about an hour or so.   When the butter is too soft or has melted  it will resemble cake mix and should be refrigerated until firm enough for desired cookie. If its sticky and wont roll in a ball put it in the fridge until it firms more. Overall Great Cookie Thanks for the recipe.

The flavor is unbelievable! But I used unsalted butter instead of Margarine, we do not like Margarine. (BLECK!) My other advice is to put a small amount of dough on the cookie sheet because they do spread out while baking. I put a ball of dough about 3/4in. round on the cookie sheet, flattened it down with the bottom of a glass, and ended up with cookies the size of my palm. Now if you're going for that size then by all means, but I was not. Happy baking!!!!!

Great recipe! Made this on a whim today using half of all ingredients. Only adjustment I made was using 1.5 cups of flour. Dough was sticky, but did not need to chill it. Adding flour to my hands made it easy to form balls. There was no need to flatten balls as they spread out during baking. Would definitely save this recipe!

These cookies were amazing. Crispy and thin and slightly chewy  in the middle. Just the way I remembered sugar cookies. I put 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 cup of shortening. (Instead of the margarine ). Going to be my go to recipes for sugar cookies. My kids loved it.

This recipe is perfect in both texture and sweetness. 10/10 would recommend!  My friend and I added about 2 cups of chocolate chips for an extra boost and it was fabulous! Naughty, scrumptious,  and decadent. . You will not regret making these tasty treats!

The taste was great.  However, the dough was really thin and wouldn't firm up.  I was not able to roll them into balls at all.  So I used a spoon to make them into small dollops and placed them on the cookie sheet.  Baked the for the allotted time and they deflated, were paper thin and broke into 1000 pieces when trying to remove them.  I followed the directions and made sure not to over stir, etc.

One little change makes this recipe a cookie that everyone will have hard time stopping from eating the whole plate. Change the margarine to shortening and be considered a bakery chef. Also, this change makes the dough a pleasure to work with vs. a sticky batter.

These cookies are very good. They are tasty and chewy, but they wouldn't brown. Left them in 2 min.'s longer and even put the temp. to 375 and they still wouldn't brown..

OH MY GOD!!! These were great! Thank you for posting these!!! These were the best cookies I have ever tried, and I'm not going to say 'yet'(excuse my punctuation) because I  don't think any cookies are going to top these, let alone any other sugar cookies! They made a ton but they went down fast! Again, thanks for posting! :)

This makes for the prefect chewy and crisp sugar cookies. I used BUTTER, not margarine. Usually I use 1 c butter and 1/4 c Crisco I don't tool in extra sugar. 
Takes 10 minutes to prepare, 11 to cook,
1 to eat.

These are to die for. You just can't get a better sugar cookie. We don't like things overly sweet, so these worked out great. The only thing I may do next time is add one more tsp vanilla for a richer flavor, but other than that 5 star!!!

STOP! These cookies are awesome. For those who think the cookie is too flat or thin, chill your dough for a while. ! Also if you want to make these even tastier substitute a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract for a half teaspoon of the vanilla. ZING! It is a perfect sugar cookie.

I love this recipie but the only thing is if you want to cut scapes,it doesn't really work all that well. But otherwise as long as your butter is squishy, its great.

the cookies turned out ok, but be careful when rolling them in sugar at the end. If you use too much, things get pretty smoky! You don't want any emergency vehicles getting sent to your house LOL.

Top notch, simple recipe. Love these. I've experimented with a few different recipes and this was the one I saved. Even tripling the recipe gave me perfect results. Oh, and I usually use Crisco in baking instead of butter. 

When I make these sugar cookies, I spread a layer of dulce de leche in the middle and edges of two cookies and put shredded coconut on the edges. Everyone raves about these... They're so yummy! Making some now!

I have made these cookies twice in the past week and they are incredibly buttery and delicious.After the first batch I chilled the second batch of dough BEFORE I put them on the pan and this helped them maintain their shape after they were put in the oven.This is now my new sugar cookie recipe!!!

Yummy sugar cookies! Easy to make and very easy to eat. I rolled mine in cinnamon sugar to make a snickerdoodle and it was lovely. The batter was sticky to start with, but got easier to handle with each batch. If you are finding it too sticky just let it sit uncovered for 10 or so minutes. Keep them in till the edges turn brown and you will have a cookie that is chewy on the outside with a soft delicate centre. I have already eaten five!

This recipe is amazing and I absolutely love it. I'm only 15 and I can barely bake but this was so simple for me. My school staff and my classmates love it when I make these and bring them in. Absolutely love them.

I found this recipe in the summer of 2014 & have made it at least 50 times! These  cookies come out perfect every single time! They can be dropped by the spoonful on the cookie sheet (if you don’t have time to chill them) & they will still come out perfectly round! If you chill them,  you can roll them out & use your favorite cookie cutter,  whichever method you use, rest assured they’ll always come out with a crunchy outside & slighty chewy inside! 
You can roll them in sugar like the recipe suggests or leave them plain-sprinkle with sugar or frost them, they’re going to be a hit regardless!!  I usually use real butter but only because that’s what I usually have on hand, aside from that I follow the recipe as written. Thank you to the original baker for sharing the greatest sugar cookie of all time!

These are amazing. I made these and rolled them in sugar sprinkles. My family loves them (and so does my neighbor). I didn't have any margarine in the house, so I did use butter instead. I can't imagine them being better than they were, but I'm sure they are great with margarine, too! Definitely my new go to recipe for sugar cookies.

So I just tried this recipe because my baby sister wanted sugar cookies. It was very easy to follow, the problem I had or at least didn't realize it would be a problem until I checked on the cookies was that I made each cookie dough ball to big so it turned into one big cookie. Oh well it was still delicious but hopefully next time I can get individual cookies to form.

This is a great sugar cookie recipe! Not much to say that hasn't been said. Only negative is the slightly sticky dough, but as other have said a quick stop in the fridge or even just some flour on your hands really helps!

This is my first time baking anything from scratch.. Ever! Not only were these cookies absolutely delicious they were extremely easy to make! I chilled the dough for about an hour and it does help with the stickiness as suggested by some of the comments. I also recommend baking them for about 10 minutes instead if 15. They remain chewy on the inside but crisp perfectly on the outside:) My 3 year old helped me make them and had an even better time eating them a short 20 minutes later!

Great recipe. I halted the recipe for 15 cookies but I made 24 smaller cookies. I melted the butter though, they still turned out very chewy and nice! I chilled the dough for 30 minutes as well. Love it:)

I think that this recipe is good but you need to watch the cookies more  than normal some of mine burnt because I set  timer for 8 minutes but other times they did not.  It also left me  55 cookies yum!

I really enjoy these cookies they're easy to make and not time consuming. I'd imagine they'd be excellent to make with children. I did however susitute the baking soda with baking powder not exactly sure if that makes a difference. They are really chewie and not to sweet I made them to surprise my boyfriend I'm hoping I don't eat them all before he gets home lol

Yummy. Tastes just like you would expect a good sugar cookie to taste...sweet and buttery. I cooked mine for 10 mins, chewy center and delicately crisp edges.

I really liked this recipe! However, when I took my cookies out, the first batch rises a lot and then collapsed on themselves! Lol they were still great! They are very crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. I did not use vanilla (I ran out) and I used Crisco instead of margarine (also out). Great recipe! I will use again. :)

I followed the recipe to the letter and my first batch came out rather crispy....  i read through a few of the reviews and noticed that some people said to take them out as soon as they changed slightly in color.  i did this with my second batch and they were much more chewy.  i think this is the key... as soon as you see a slight change (and i mean slight)...take them out!

These sugar cookies are just what I was looking for. They are so good. I saw where some thought they were too thin.  I use Hudson Cream short patent flour. All cookies do not spread as much, and they are not as thin.

They were chewy when they came out of the oven but 20 minutes later, they became weapons. I'm not sure if I should have adjusted for altitute but they flattened out pretty thin. The flavor is meh.

DEFINATELY had to add about 1/2 cup more flour to barely get these to hold together to roll in the sugar, even after chilling for 20 minutes...suggestion...keep the dough in the fridge while batch is baking....added cinnamon to the sugar for rolling...ummmm  BEST SUGAR COOKIE I HAVE EVER MADE

I needed a sugar cookie recipe late on a Sunday night because I forgot I needed them for a school party Monday morning. I had all the ingredients on hand so I tried this one. PERFECTION. I used butter flavor Cisco instead of margarine because that's what I had. Thank you for a great recipe. I plan to try them again rolling in sugar and 
cinnamon!

This recipe is delicious, I used almond extract. The one main issue is I had no idea what a walnut sized ball is. I made about 40 cookies after I cut the recipe in half. I believe walnut sized is around 2 tablespoons, I'm not sure.

Terrible. I was looking for a soft chewy sugar cookie like the picture but the cookies from this recipe were nothing like that. The cookies came out flat, thin, hard and crispy. I followed the recipe exactly and made sure not to over bake. I will not make these again.

I'm currently baking these cookies and MAN they are WONDERFUL. I don't know how people could mess up? Follow directions. :) I don't see how its possible to ruin these cookies, seriously. Shame on the negative reviews. 8 Minutes in the oven at 375 & their done. I used sticks of butter rather than marg. I played with these a bit too for the flavor by adding lemon juice/lemon shavings & cinnamon to another batch. My husband and I LOVE them!!!! Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I made these cookies last night rolled in cinnamon sugar and they are AMAZING! They are exactly what I was looking for, a little crunch on the bottom but soft and chewy on top and inside. This will be my go to sugar cookie recipe from now on! When making the dough, I was a little worried is was so soft and sticky, but they turned out perfectly. Thank you for a great cookie recipe!

Followed recipe exactly as stated. Dough was not thick enough to roll in sugar even after overnight refrigeration, so I had to sprinkle it on. Bad idea; ended up ruining my cookie sheet. The cookies came out flavorless and boring, not chewy at all. The texture was very cakey. The dough was better than the cookies themselves. I ended up adding M&Ms to the leftover dough to try to add some flavor/texture. Will keep looking for a good chewy cookie recipe.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I think I've been looking for it all my life!  These cookies were wonderful, exactly as described -- crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Warm, they were heavenly, perfect.  And the next day, they were still delicious.  They were a big hit with all who tried them. Leaving them on the cookie sheet for five minutes worked perfectly.  I will be making them again and again.

I didn't have any margarine so i used about one cup butter. Also cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup. Added 1 package True Lemon powder to 1/2 dough. If you like sugar cookies, this is good recipe. Personally I'd rather have chocolate.

These cookies are chewy and buttery and delicious! I've made them twice as snickerdoodles in two different ovens, with two types of flour/sugar combos (regular flour and sugar, and organic whole wheat flour and organic sugar) and they've turned out soft, chewy, and slightly crunchy around the edges both times. One downfall is that they don't hold their shape, so can't be cut into shapes like traditional sugar cookies. I would suggest a different sugar cookie recipe, if you're wanting to make shapes.

This is exactly what I was looking for today. I didn't have margarine, so I used butter flavored shortening, and these taste delicious! I did use almond extract, because that is the flavor I was looking for when I wanted to make cookies today. They are soft and soooo yummy!

This is the best sugar cookie ever, it makes great plain sugar cookie without frosting and even better snickerdoodles. My son wanted me to take them to his school when he signed with his college. Got good reviews from the kids. Gave the recipes to others to try now.

The cookie dough was a bit sticky, but it wasn't runny... the cookies did exactly the job I was wanting them to do, which was provide a crust for personal sized fruit pizzas, and for that, this recipe was great -

These cookies were exactly what I was craving!! And it is hard to find recipes like that. Well, I only have two things to say. One you should add more sugar into the recipe. If not it is fine. Just sprinkle it over he cookies when here finished baking. And I feel like they taste better cooled completley. But if you like them warm, go for it!!

These are awesome. I used butter instead of margarine, but they are still madly addicting. While my Father, Sister, and Brother aren't addicted to them, my Mother and I can't stop eating them. I find that they taste best with icing on them. I'm debating on whether I should make more, because while they are good, that's the reason I don't want to make more... Because they are addicting. This batch of cookies are going to be gone by tomorrow.

My husband cannot get enough of these! He doesn't want me to make any other sugar cookie recipe ever again. FYI, it definitely helps to chill the dough for a few hours to make it easier to work with.

Gave em 5 stars because they're delicious and exactly what I wanted. Used slightly less sugar, slightly more flour, and slightly less vegetable oil which I had to substitute for margarine since we were out. (Since our imitation butter is made of veggie oil, I figured it'd work!) Then I rolled them in a mix of sprinkles and sugar and baked as directed. Had no trouble at all with flatness, they were thick and fluffy, not too hard or too chewy. Yum yum!

I just made this recipe for my 4 daughters and myself and let me tell you it's a hit. The ages of my children are 15, 12, 11 and 5. So it pleased all age groups. I used some colored sugars on some of the cookies and my 5 year old is allergic to milk so I used earth balance natural buttery spread. It's vegan and they are still AMAZING. No rolling, no chilling....just quick, easy, delicious sugar cookies!

Sugar cookies usually end up in some disaster for me.  I tried this recipe and it was awesome.  The cookies are sweet enough that icing is not necessary. I don't think they are going to last long at all.

These were not chewy by any means.
Unless it's my cheap horrible electric stove oven, which could be why. I used Crisco instead of margarine since that always makes everything taste better, also I left them in there for a minute or two longer because at 10 minutes the cookies were still super doughy and sticky. They were soft when coming out but they just got really hard! So I just took them out at the 10 minute mark and see if they turn out better resting out... and they still got hard. I took them out when they weren't even done and still got hard.
I don't know but I still can't find chewy sugar cookies that are good :(

This recipe was absolutely amazing. As promised, they were "crisp on the outside and very chewy on the inside". Very easy to make and it tasted so good. Perfection was what this was. All my friends and families enjoyed it very much! Thank you for the amazing recipe!

Cookies were chewy as promised. However, the cookies spread way too much. I would use less sugar and less butter.

This is the best sugar Cookie reciped I've tried.  My husband and kids loved them!  I reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and also added some 1 teaspon of Baking Powder.  Make sure you only bake them for 8-9 minutes.  They may look under cooked, but they will conitinue to cook once you take them out the oven.  Definitely a keeper!

Previous to trying this recipe I had tried another in which my cookies came out horrible. However, when I tried this recipe my cookies came out as if I had been making these all my life! Everyone loves them! I don't bake often so the recipe was easy to follow. Thanks!

Really good cookies.  Crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle.  I added 1/4 cup of flour per reviews and baked them at 375 for 12 minutes.  Excellent recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Excellent recipe although I don't think the 'rolling in sugar' is necessary, I liberally sprinkled it on and they were amazing. I used butter instead of margarine (we don't use margarine) and I replaced vanilla extract with maple syrup (everyone loved them except for my little brother who has made me promise that half of the next recipe will be regular sugar cookies). I also added cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice to the sugar.

Perfect with more flour than noted. Dough was way too runny, as other comments, like cake batter. I had to add probably about 3/4cups more flour (I just kept adding until I thought it seemed like the right cookie dough consistancy.) It did help to put them in the fridge for about 20 minutes so that they do not stick to your fingers as much! I also used parchment paper and cookies did not stick at all. I also just took some of the dough and put it on the cookie shape in no particular ball shape and did not push down. I believe this helped keep them from getting too flat. Great taste and I love the chewiness!

Instead of using a teaspoon of baking soda, I used 4 teaspoons of baking powder. I think it tastes the same as the original, but these are still the greatest sugar cookies ever.

OMG!! These are the best ever! Texture and taste...WOW! Just can't say enough.  I made a batch yesterday using another recipe and they were hard & crumbly.  These are yum! Just used two sticks of butter softened, (No margarine for me, and 2 1/2 sticks is way too much butter, even for me..lol) and per another reviewer increased temp to 375 degrees for 6-7 minutes ..for a crispier cookie. If you are worried about sticking, use wax paper. Easy cleanup too. Also since the dough is sticky, use a cookie scoop. I used Pampered Chef medium, but any brand will do. Scoop & drop in sugar, then its easier to handle. The bad reviewers must have done something wrong.  Try it again and check your oven temp.  It could be too hot or vice versa.

I really liked this recipe, but if you're going to make it I suggest sifting the flour and use baking POWDER instead of baking soda. It makes them fluffy and pretty, not just flat. I also added a little extra sugar on top after they got out the oven. I also added red food coloring to make them look festive.

These sugar cookies are pretty awesome. They went REALLY fast which wasnt a good thing for my eating healthy regiment. I made a batch as the recipe states then froze some leftover dough bc the kids and I ran out of time. So tonight, I took the dough out for maybe an hour or two, just used my cookie scoop to get that perfect size and voila...! They are baking as we speak and just in time for the 2.5 year olds bed time. They are delish!

I chose this recipe, because the ingredients were simple, and I didn't feel like making a trip to the market for the ingredients that other recipes required. Anyway, these cookies came out pretty well. The dough is VERY sticky, but I was still able to roll it into balls. The dough also spreads a lot in the oven, so I would advise either spacing each dough ball far apart, or just making the balls smaller. Follow the time completely if you want them to be chewy. I did for the first two batches. But for the third batch, I left them in for about 15 minutes, and they came out crispier. Not completely hard, but definitely not chewy. Overall, I really enjoyed this recipe. The cookies tasted good and weren't too sweet. Just right.

This is just amazing! I've been making them all the time for my family and they just disapear! One thing is make sure you put the dough in the refrigerator for a few hours. The cookies dont spread as much and are easier to roll into balls.

Great recipe. Definitely got the seal of approval from the kids. Made these for "Santa" on Christmas Eve, with the boys devouring the rest. I also decorated some cookies with the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe here, which worked out beautifully. Thanks!

This is the perfect cookie with a bit of crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside!  Yummy!
I also used butter rather than margarine, and I used fine baking sugar, which made the texture not-so-gritty as the usual sugar cookie.  If you are looking for a cookie that's in between the whole chewy/crispy versions, this is it!  Thank you!

This was really good I made it a bunch of times. I just added a little bit more flour because sometimes it was sticky and hard to roll in your hands, but besides that they were the best cookies ever!

Delicious cookies. I used butter flavored Crisco because i didn't have enough butter in the fridge and these cookies were even better the 2nd day. Will most definitely make again.

This recipe is perfect! I added just a little bit of extra flour (probably 1/4 cup) and it helped keep them from being too flat without tasting like flour. I used an air bake pan and instead of rolling them in sugar, I sprinkled them with colored sugar before baking and they were very festive! This recipe goes a long way!

I just made these about an hour ago, and they are as fantastic as promised! I did cut down on the sugar by half a cup, but they are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I will certainly be making these again!

By far the best sugar cookie recipe yet. And I have tried many different recipes. This is is going to be the only one I use. Made no changes, other then I let the butter and sugar beat a little long (i am a caretaker)...they still turned out perfect.

AMAZING sugar cookies! They made the house smell like Christmas!Quick and easy to make.mine took a tad longer to cook then what the recipe says since i made larger balls of dough.Overall great, quick, and easy recipe. You can subsitute the margarine for butter like i did, i think it made the batter better. I'll definately make these cookies again!

I assumed the margarine had to be softened (as most baking requires) by the time it was all mixed it was like frosting! I even added an extra bit of flower and it was still too mushy to form into balls as instructed. I only made a partial batch and put the rest in the fridge. Putting it in the fridge over night helped firm up the dough so I could work with it. Tastes good but I feel a step or two is missing or needs more flour from the get go?

These cookies are delicious! FYI though, one batch made 70 cookies, not 30. I don't know how big you guys are making your cookies, but mine were about 3" across, and I have enough to share with my family AND coworkers. I was about to double the recipe but didn't have enough sugar - glad I didn't! One tip - to keep them chewy, take them out when they look like they aren't quite done.

Really great recipe. They came out exactly as advertised with a nice crunch and chewy interior. I did have some trouble rolling the dough but chilling it for a few minutes in the fridge did the trick.

I love sweets. I am the kind of person who adds 4 sugars to her tea. But this cookie was far too sweet for me. If you look at the other sugar cookie recipes, the sugar content is far less by at least 1/2 cup. it makes a huge difference.

Also bakes rather flat. If you roll into a ball and do NOT press to flatten, it will still be relatively flat. My suggestion is to refrigerate dough for at least 30 mins and roll into a ball as large as a half dollar to help maintain its shape. Or else if you do not then you will come out w/ cookie pancakes. For the ones that baked flat, the consistency was also more cakey than a cookie. For the ones that I rolled into a big ball, they were more of a cookie consistency.

Love the cookies but they need 4tsp of vanilla. The extra sugar is important or they end up tasting like just butter cookies,not sugar cookies. Also,only cook them 8 minutes. 10 minutes can make them too crispy. I used all butter instead of margarine. I think the recipe when using butter,could be cut back by 1/2 stick.

Great Recipe!

It is really hard to find a good sugar cookie recipe since there are many out there. But I found the perfect one with this recipe. I made it for my family and they loved them. Crisp on the edges and chew in the middle, just great!

I added a hint of ground cinnamon, I add this to about everything I make.

Spectacular Cookies!!! I only made a couple changes. I used butter instead of margarine and used two cups of it instead of 2 and 1/4 cups, I also melted one stick and softened the other, that worked great! I refrigerated the dough for a good hour before baking as well. My husband and I really enjoyed these with tea!

YUM!  I had been searching everywhere for a recipe that would taste like the sugar butter cookies from The Original Cookie Co.  I saw a review that said these tasted like that, so I tried it-and they do! (if you remember the Cookie Co. and liked their M & M cookies, try pressing M & M candies into the top when these come out of the oven)  Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this one!

These were fantastic especially when still warm. They hardened more than I thought they would on the second day, but they were still delicious. If you like chewy sugar cookies you can't go wrong with this recipe.

Best sugar cookies I have ever had. I added little more flour and chilled the dough for a couple of hours at the end. I also rolled the balls in cinammon sugar instead of just sugar before baking. They look beautiful and are so yummy.

These were nice, easy cookies - the only complaint is that the 8-10 minute cook time wasn't nearly enough for the 'crunchy-on-the-outside-chewy-on-the-inside' texture.   Next time I'll bake for a good 13-15 minutes.

I made M&M cookies with this recipe! Imagine a flat, buttery, chewy & crispy M&M cookie. They were exactly what I was hoping for! These are not cut out sugar cookies. They are straight up drop cookies. They are flat, but they are delicious! Thank You!!!!

Perfect as written with the exception of bake time - mine were perfect after baking about 15 minutes.
If you leave them out overnight after baking, they are nice and crunchy in the morning.  If you put them in a Ziploc baggie right after they cool, they will stay super-chewy.

The directions were easy...the only thing I questioned (as a new baker) was what "cream together" meant...but that was easily found. I used butter instead of margarine and they turned out delicious and easy to make! My wife called them "freaking delicious"  :)

I would not make these again.  They were chewy, but I did not like the margarine taste within the cookie.

Amazing! I made 1/2 batch with rolling in white sugar & other 1/2 rolling in cinnamon sugar. I honestly can't decide which I like better. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Soooo yummy!! I added craisins that were infused with cherry to add a little color. They were really good and really easy. They are a little flat which was fine but I tried a batch in a mini and regular sized muffin pan so they couldn't spread out as far - still great, just a little thicker.

Great recipe. I added lemon flavoring for a twist and in half of the batch mixed in some toasted coconut. Very yummy. Definitely refrigerate for a bit before balling and baking.

A perfect sugar cookie!  I used butter, softened first, vanilla extract and perfect!  I didn't chill either...a great solid cookie.  Also I didn't roll in sugar but instead let cook then iced and sprinkled.  Very great cookie!

OMG! i followed this recipe EXACTLY as written, and let me tell you, these came out great! They were nice and chewy! And also because it was Christmas, i put M&Ms on top of the cookies when they were half way finished! my friends and teachers LOVED them! but keep in mind, 8-11 minutes, is perfect. if they seem fluffy, and not hard it's OK, because once they are cooled they will harden and become perfect sugar cookies! loved them!

These cookies are awesome!  They are crispy around the edges and chewy in the center.  I also used butter rather than margarine (taste is more intense), and I used 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar adding to the tast.

These are great! I was looking for nondairy cookie recipes and these turned out to be the perfect solution. I substituted vegetable shortening for margarine and unlike most people here I ended up baking mine for AT LEAST fifteen minutes. The held their shape nicely and they still have that wonderful crisp outside with a soft, fluffy interior.  I topped mine with confectioners sugar as soon as I pulled them from the oven-- they hit the spot!

The taste is is fabulous. My kids went crazy for them.  I added 1/4 tsp. almond extract to my dough and they were so good.    My only problem is they didn't look anything like the cookies in the picture. Mine were flatter than a pancake and spread all over the pan.  I don't know if it's because I used real butter instead of margarine, but that's what I had on hand.  We didn't really care how they looked though, the taste was great!  And they really are crispy on the outside and chewy.

This is a very good cookie recipe.  I made it exactly as the directions indicated.  The original recipe indicated a yield of 30 cookies.  I was able to get 4 1/2 dozen (54 cookies).  I made large cookies too, about 3 - 4 inches across.  I refridgerated the dough after mixing all the ingredients for about 20 minutes and in between batches, but the dough never firmed up enough to roll.  Instead I used my ice cream scooper, which is how I got such big cookies.  Any smaller and I'd be eating cookies until next year.  Since I wasn't able to roll the cookies, I didn't coat them in the additional 1/4 cup of sugar.  That didn't turn out to be a problem because the cookies were plenty sweet enough.  I ended up baking mine for 12 minutes and the cookies came out just slightly golden on the edges and perfectly soft on the inside.  I will be using this recipe in the future in place of store-bought cookie dough.

I made these last night and they are wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly. The dough was too soft to roll but it didn't matter to me so I just used a melon ball scoop to scoop the dough. I used a melon ball scoop to make mini cookies for my daughter and they did end up a little flat but they taste so good that it doesn't matter. I cooked them for 12 min rather than 8 - 10 because they weren't done but that could have been my oven... I don't know how people said they burned these though because I could have left these in for longer and they would have been just fine, next time I might leave them in a few more min but they are very yummy and my 2 year old daughter loves them too. These cookies don't taste too sweet to me either. I would recommend these sugar cookies for anyone who wants a great sugar cookie.

Very delicious. Only reason I didn't give it 5 starts was because it's reeeeally sugary ... so I could maybe eat one and be content. I'll probably decrease the sugar content a bit next time. Very good though. Definitely fulfills the sweets craving. :-)

The cookies have a delicious taste to them. I frosted the cookies with the sugar cookie frosting recipe and everyone loved them. However, I did have to bake them an additional 3 to 5 minutes longer than what is specified and I was slightly disappointed at the flatness of the cookie. Next time I will add a 1/2 C brown sugar to try and "bulk" them up a bit.

The original version was great...this time around, I used butter instead of margarine.  To the recipe, I added 1 t. of butter flavor and 1 t. of lemon flavor.  I rolled the dough into two logs, wrapped them in saran wrap and refrigerated the dough for a short while.  I did not roll in sugar (I don't like sugar rolled cookies), instead I sliced and baked.  YUM!

I made these cookies and they turned out so good.  They are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I have made several differnt recipes lately and my husband loves these cookies. Will make again soon :)

The title of these cookies actually makes sense! These cookies are very trusted and are delicious! I really recommend them. BUT they could use a little bit less of the butter, still if they have more they are still scrumptious.

WOW, excellent!  I am still a beginner cook/baker and I found these so easy and sooo yummy!  Followed recipe except took a reviewers advice and put dough in fridge for an hour to cool down a little.  Also did not letter butter soften.

every year around the holidays i struggle to find a good recipe for sugar cookies that produces cookies that are edible without being smothered in frosting. this recipe turned out really nice. the cookies maintain a great chewy texture even after cooled with light crisp edges. while i usually prefer a fat cookie, the flatter shape could be easily overlooked on account of great taste and texture. while the recipe is perfect as is, i did make a couple variations. by rolling one batch of balls of dough in a cinnamon-sugar mixture i created snickerdoodles and by adding some cocoa powder to another batch i made a sort of of cocoa swirl cookies which came out looking great and having a slight chocolate hint to them (without adding any additional sugar). with the plain batch i never added the extra sugar before baking. they are sweet enough as is to not need it. simple recipe. hard to mess up. great starting point for endless variations.

Soooo delicious! Very yummy flavor and consistency.  I made them once with rolling the balls in sugar and they were pretty darn sweet, probably too sweet.  Then I tried them without rolling them in sugar and they were just right but missing the sugary texture on the outside.  I would suggest using a little less sugar in the dough and still rolling them in sugar. Very good with fresh vanilla bean seeds!

These tasted marvelous but I didn't like them because they ran all over the cookie sheet and all the cookies ran together. i don't know if it was something I did but I followed the recipe exactly.

Super yummy sugar cookies! The whole gang loved them! I too used butter instead of margarine and I put them in the fridge for about an hour. I did not have trouble with the dough being sticky or hard to handle. I rolled the cookies in a multi-colored sugar/ cinnamon mix to give them a snickerdoodle taste for the kids. For the adults, I ploppped the dough by the spoonful (didn't roll them into balls at all) and iced them with gingerbread flavored icing after the cooled. They turned out great both ways! They did seem to spread pretty thin after baking, but they were super tasty!!

These cookies were great! The only problem is that as soon as you take them out, they start hardening, so make sure you wrap them up tightly with seram wrap or something. Other then that, they're delicious! I'm gonna bring them in my lunch tommorow.

I decided to make this recipe and substitute applesauce for half the butter.  I've never used this substitution before and against all advice on the web stating that it may not "turn out" in cookies, but is better used in cakes/breads/muffins, I decided to give it a whirl.  The dough was too sticky to roll by hand, but I was able to plop it onto the pan with a spoon into globs.  They turned out looking like 'normal' cookies, but were very soft and stayed completely soft and mallable.  The core taste of just how yummy a sugar cookie this is, is there.  The more I eat them, the more I like them.  In a way it's like eating sugar cookie dough; they're that soft.  For those that love raw dough, I would recommend what I did.  Otherwise, I can't wait to try this recipe using all butter so I can get a little crunch to the edges.  GREAT taste and not the disaster I half expected!

This just came out terrible. It tasted like you were eating boiled eggs and they weren't sweet enough. I don't know what I might have done wrong. I only made half the batch (the raw dough was delicious by the way) and put the other half in the fridge. The next day I made the other half and decided to bake it longer than the recommended 8-10 minutes. I baked it for 12 minutes and still eggy. I would have given it one star but I'm giving it two just because I wonder if I did something wrong although I do make cookies a lot and never had this problem before. By  the way I used Large organic eggs.

mine didn't turn out as chewy as I expected them to. But they do look really cute. I made them and rolled them in different colors of sprinkles. Good cookie if you are short on time. Simple to make.

I call these "crack" cookies, as they are super addictive.  I have made four batches in as many weeks.  I just can't get enough of them.  Only changes I made were to use butter (and one time I only had 2 sticks softened and they turned out fine) and I do not bother to roll in sugar.  In fact, I don't roll them at all.  I just drop them by the spoonful onto the baking sheet.  I also don't bother to chill the dough as some have suggested.  I bake for 8-10 minutes, but don't leave them on the sheet for another 5 (I'm too impatient and want to get another batch in the oven).  As long as I use a very thin spatula, they come off the sheet just fine.  One of my new favorite recipes, thanks!

These were easy to put together (not sure why people are having trouble with them spreading so?).  They came out picture perfect after 10 minutes.  Unfortunately they were more like tender crumbly cookies than chewy :(  Not bad, just not what I was looking for.  Thanks anyway!

It's my first time making a sugar cookie, and I'm very satisfied how this recipe turned out. I like the chewy and sweet kind. And I already ate three of them just waiting for the next batch to bake. Now, isn't that funny? :))

Delicious cookies! I don't make cookies from scratch often, but found it easy and simple.  I refrigerated the dough for 35-40 min before rolling into balls. We rolled the balls in red and green sprinkles before baking and turned out really pretty. I will definitely make these again vs buying refrigerated dough!

These cookies turned out very good but for some reason, mine turned out "hollow"-is the only way I could describe it.  They formed some sort of air pocket in the middle: still very tasty but the pocket was alittle strange. Would still recommend to others.

Delicious! The dough for these was sticky, but once you roll it in the sugar it 'feels' like real dough. Mine expanded to a HUGE size in the oven though so bake far apart or use smaller than normal sizes.

I was worried about these bc the dough was very sticky and I was tempted to add more flour (I didn't). I would've liked these to be a little thicker. They were still very good.

The butter flavor is great.  These are very chewy- perfect.  Crunchy on the edges, soft in the middle.  They hold up well over a few days too.  We roll ours in colored sugar for whatever the season.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are hands down the best tasting sugar cookies. Perfectly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Tastes great with frosting. I just wish they did not spread out to twice the size. If anyone has suggestions to capture this great flavor in a roll out cookie I would love to know...thought I think it has to do with the butter content haha. Still a delicious, simple drop cookie.

This recipe is fantastic. It's simple, and the cookies taste wonderful. I change up the recipe a little each time I make them. I've used extra vanilla extract, I have used honey instead of the vanilla extract, and I have used 1/8 less flour for a cookie that's softer on the edges. All of the variations turned out delicious!

I was having a craving for a chewy sugar cookie and this one definitely is the best that I have ever had.  The uncooked dough was so yummy that I new it would be a hit!  My husbands' employer was having a few new people start in the office so I wanted to make them some treats that were quick, cheap and amazing.  Everyone raved about them at the office.  Love these!  

I took the advice of others and let the dough cool a bit before making the cookies.  I rolled them in a light coat of confectioners sugar instead of the white sugar that it calls for.  I baked them for 12 minutes in my oven which resulted in a light brown edge with buttery/chewy centers.  These cookies do spread tremendously and flatten but they are still great!  Amazing!  Definitely a keeper.

These have great flavor, worth about 4 stars - buttery, sugary and just delicious. They definitely live up to the name of the cookie, as they turned out crisp around the edges and wonderfully chewy in the middle. 
However, I'd give these a two rating for presentation. Once out of the oven, they fell flat (some VERY flat) in the middle, so they look like little moon craters or something. A few stuck to the pan, even though it was greased. 
Overall, they don't look very good, but they taste great.

I substituted the all-purpose flour for whole wheat and they were excellent. Very chewy. My grandmother especially loved them and took the last couple ones home with her... without asking! ;o)

Great recipe!  The edges have a little bite to them but they are still chewy like i love!  The only thing i didnt do was rolling the dough in sugar - they are already sweet enough for me to skip that part.  Overall - the best sugar cookies I've tasted!

honestly, these cookies are so far the best cookies i have made. when i took out the first batch, they smelt so good! i had a taste of them - and it wasn't bad. it was crunchy on the outside, but it wasn't exactly soft as they say so. the second batch - well i did it for 6 minutes instead of 8, and they turned out better than the first batch. these cookies are really good - and i recommend them to anyone!

These are good and chewy but I don't feel they are great, went flat and I didn't melt the butter. Probably won't make again.

These were SO YUMMY!!!! I tried a few of the sugar cookie recipes on here and this recipe was by far the best.  They were nice and crunchy on the edges and soft in the middle.  I rolled mine in rainbow sprinkles.  I made a double batch and everyone at work loved them, they were literally gone within minutes.  This recipe is a keeper!!

These were pretty darn tastey.  I added about 1 tablespoon of cinnamon to mine to make them into snickerdoodles, then dusted them with cinnamon and sugar.  They were the first to go when I brought them in to work.

Just made these and they taste great!  I did not have enough vanilla extract, so I added some almond extract.  Had a lot of dough, so I made some tumbprint cookies and added homemade blueberry jam that my Grandma gave me for Christmas.  Thanks for sharing!!

I made these cookies near Christmas time. I followed the recipe and just made one batch. There were NONE left over the next day! I was having my girls night out so I decided to double the batch and leave some at home and take some with me. I had about 10 cookies left when I came home!! For Christmas I tripled the batch, gave some to neighbors, took some to my mothers and my mother in laws. We had whatever was left for breakfast the following day!! I had nothing but compliments!! I highly recommend this recipe!!!!!

pretty good sugar cookies.I cooked 2 batches at the same time. the ones on the older pan w/ sides and they turned out great. The other ones on the new flat baking sheet did not cook all the way (after almost double the time) and stuck horribly to the bakers sheet. FYI. recipe is good though.

These are the best sugar cookies! The first time I made them for my family we couldn't stop eating them! They are so perfectly sweet -but not too sweet-, and the dough usually lasts me a while. Also, they are quite easy to make. My family would go crazy if I ever stopped making these cookies!

these are excellent!  im not the hugest sugar cookie fan, but i enjoyed these greatly.  i took them into work and everyone raved about them!

on a side note, the first time i baked them, i used a flour that was a mixture of wheat and white (it was the only thing in my mothers house).  both my parents enjoyed the cookies with this flour, but i was personally not a fan...too much wheat flavor, which in my opinion doesnt mesh well with a sugar cookie concept.  and besides, the wheat doesnt REALLY make it any healthier when youre rolling the cookie around in sugar!

the second time i made them, and when i brought them into work, i made them exactly as the recipe stated, with white flour.  i enjoyed these much better because they lacked the wheat flavor.

so if you dont mind the wheat flavor, the recipe still turns our with mixed flour.

VERY tasty!  We LOVE these cookies.  A couple of years ago, I'd found an awesome recipe, and for the life of me, I can't find it again.  I typed in "chewy sugar cookies" and found this one, tried it, and LOVE IT!  The cookies DO flatten out tremendously, as if something may be missing, but they are still so yummy, I wouldn't change a thing!

These cookies were wonderful. I didn't make any changes to the recipe at all. One of the other reviews had mentioned that rolling the dough in the sugar is more like a 'flip-flop'...which is quite accurate. Although I chilled my dough in between batches, I would rather deal with the sticky dough than keep the dough chilled. My last batch was definitely the flattest of all my batches. I baked my cookies for 10 minutes, then let them cool for 5 minutes on the nonstick cookie sheet before transferring them to a wire rack. They still tasted great (and stayed soft) the next day! UPDATE: I took these into work one day for my Soldiers and they LOVED them! They still talk about these cookies 7 months later. This recipe does not disappoint.

I don't usually bother rating and reviewing a recipe that already has so many reviews, but WOW! These are wonderful cookies.  My long time favorite recipe has been replaced. These cookies have a great buttery sweet flavor. I love them!  thank you for a GREAT sugar cookie recipe.

I brought the snickerdoodle variation to Thanksgiving and was told by everyone there they were the best snickerdoodles they had ever had. I use less magarine than called for (only one cup), use three whole cups of flour and mix in the flour by hand, not with a mixer. These cookies are definitely the best.

I lost my favorite sugar cookie recipe, one I found on the back of a flour package, so I tried this one.  These cookies looked good right before I took them out of the oven, but as soon as they were out (within 5 seconds) they went completely flat.  Good buttery taste, but if you want melt-in-your-mouth sugar cookes, try a different recipe.

I wanted a drop sugar cookie to send on a high school weekend trip.  These are tasty with a good chewy texture, but have the flavor of a store-bought or bakery cookie.  I used butter flavor shortening, and rolled in cinnamon sugar.  I might make again, but next time will roll in a crushed corn flakes, or a mixture of that and coconut.
I made a 2nd batch using 2 1/2 C flour & 1/2 C cocoa, rolled tops in chopped nuts, and bottoms in sugar.   Followed same directions, came out great!!!

These cookies taste great, but they turned out extremely flat and almost paper-thin. Even when cooled, they crumbled when I removed them from the pan. If I made these again, I would add baking powder.

They were chewy, as promised, but the taste wasn't that great, and they were FLAT.  I refrigerated them overnight before dropping them onto cookie sheets, but they still came out extremely flat, and the temperature of my oven was accurate (I used an in-oven thermometer).  I followed the recipe exactly, but I was still a little embarrassed to have to give these cookies out (they were supposed to be quick'n'easy "thank-you" gifts, and I didn't have time to make any others).  These might taste better with frosting.

These cookies are AWESOME!  They're crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Just what I was looking for.  I did use real butter though.  That usually makes a difference taste-wise.  My four-year old daughter said these cookies taste better than the bakery's!

Although not my favorite kind of sugar cookie, it is exactly what my fiance was looking for, and he loved them.  I used margarine (stick, not out of the tub) and the dough ended up being more like batter- was super sticky and hard to work with even after refridgerating.  Will only make again at his request.

Good recipe! However I had to add an extra 1/2 cup sugar to the batch because it tasted like it was missing extra sweetness. I did not flatten the dough as suggested; just rolled it into walnut sized balls and dipped in sugar. I baked the cookies for exactly 14 minutes because they still were "raw" after 8-10 minutes. (Maybe it's my oven.) They came out looking beautiful, golden and brown.... and chewy! Delish! I will definitely make these again.

This is a great recipe as long as you add a little more flour so you can actually ball and roll in sugar.  I also only used 2 sticks of butter and they still tasted wonderful!!  I made half sugar and then I mixed cinnamon in and made the rest snickerdoodles.  The family ate em up fast!! I highly recommend using a cookie dough scoop too. It makes cookie baking so much faster and easier!

Just a little more flour and this recipe is perfect!  My husband can't get enough of them!  Everyone at his office loves them, too!  I'll be adding this to my recipe collection.

I used 1 cup butter, and rolled in raw sugar, and they are tasty!  Flattened out quite a bit when cooking, will change the recipe a bit next time to prevent this.  Also turned out yummy as a snickerdoodle as well, rolled in sugar and cinnamon.

I made a batch of these with Butter Flavored shortning, and they turned out really pretty good. i cooked mine for 12 minutes, and made half the batch snickerdoodles and half sugar cookies. They will be a present for my mom when she gets in town. I am not the biggest fan of sugar cookies, but i thought these were pretty good. My mom will probably say they are fantastic, they seem like ones that she will just love. 

Just a bit crispy on all the edges and a good amount of chewyness on the inside. They seem a little bit plain in flavor, but maybe thats just how sugar cookies are (i just havent had one in so long!). I think next time i would put in a pinch more salt, and roll them around in demerara sugar, instead of regular white sugar. Much more fancy presentation i think- but they wont 'sparkle' like white sugar will.  --- I cant eat more than half of one of these without feeling a little bit sick from all the plain sugary taste... like i said, maybe sugar cookies just arent my thing.. who knows.

My friend and I made some as a give-away for Valentine's Day.  The dough was very sticky but licking it off fingers didn't pose a problem.  They turned out just a little dry for us, but the taste was great.  Even my mother (not a fan of sweet things) liked them.  They are not too sweet and very quick and easy to make.  All in all, the only complaint was the slight dryness, but they did come out looking beautiful.  We were proud to serve them!

Good, but be careful not to cook too long.  After 8-10 minutes, they did not appear done, so I continued cooking and they turned out a little harder than I'd like.  Still edible though.

I followed this recipe exactly and the cookies came out a bit dry.  I coulnd't wait for the edges to get brown before removing them from the oven or they would have been inedible.  I was disappointed.

These cookies were really good, had a problem keeping my boyfriend away from them. I did have a hard time trying to keep them from going to crispy. I saved them in a zip lock bag, but they were crunchy the next day.

Hm..out of the oven it was more cakey than "chewy" in the middle and then they dried out after a while, but they still tasted pretty good - crunchy and all.  I believe it was because I chilled the dough so it wouldn't be so sticky.  I also added a pecan half also with cinnamon-sugar on the top for a bit of decaration.  They look pretty, but the texture leaves much to be desired.

Great even without baking the dough!  Just make sure you love sugar.  My trick is to add a combination of cinnamon and sugar on top.

Overall a great tasting cookie.  Hard to get to the right constistency.  I baked one batch for 9 minutes and it was too soft, baked another for 11 minutes and it was too hard.  About half the batch fell apart but we ended up eatting the pieces right off the cookie sheets because they tasted so good.  I don't know what I could to make the cookies stay together better.  Any suggestions would be welcomed.  Thanks for sharing Cindy.

i used this recipe b/c it was the first one i saw that did NOT need baking soda! i rolled it in the sugar mixture mixed with a little over one tablespoon of ground cinnamon. mmmm...yummy...it came out a lot better than expected. i did have to bake it in the oven for over 15 minutes though...worth it, 10x better than the sugar cookies i tried to make before because with this one-you DON'T need frosting to eat it.

These cookies were delicious.  I made a batch for some of my husband's friends who were sent overseas in the military.  Before I could box them and send them off, my husband had eaten half of the batch!  I had to make more, but I didn't mind because these are so simple to make.

I'm a teen and I can't exactly go out and get ingredients when I want to make something, and my parents don't bake much but I had all these ingredients in my house already .. they were a little too sugary with rolling them in sugar, so next time I think I'll make them as drop cookies.  Thanks !

This was a great recipe. I will only use this recipe for sugar cookies from now on. I only did one thing different. Instead of rolling the cookies in sugar(because I didn't want to handle the sticky dough to much), I dropped spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet and then sprinkled some of the cookies with sugar, and others with a sugar/cinnamon mixture before baking. (The kids liked them better with the sugar/cinnamon mixture). Overall a great easy recipe....

Was looking for sugar cookie to roll out and cut, this isn't it.  Dough was very sticky and not firm at all.  Turned out to be drop cookies instead.  The flavor was good though.  Made many more cookies than expected so they were taken to husbands work and they all liked them very well.  Overall a good cookie, just messy.

A great chewy sugar cookie that was easy to make.  My kitchen was a little too warm, so my first batch spread out a lot.  I simply refrigerated the dough a while before making the next batch.  Tried both the cinnamon and non-cinnamon variations. Both were great!  Disappeared quickly!

I had high expectations for this cookie recipe and it definitely measured up to its reviews and ratings.  I love a chewy cookie and haven't been able to find a good sugar cookie recipe that wasn't crispy.  Kudos to the author of this recipe.

Great recipe, but for the life of me I could not get it to work with cookie cutters, so we rolled into colored sugar instead.  Wonderful!

the first time we tried these, we somehow used powdered sugar instead of flour.  so those turned out disasterous.  but then after we resolved that little issue and found the flour, they turned out perfect and amazing.  so the moral of this story is that these cookies are essentially impossible to mess up, unless you have issues distinguishing between essential ingredients.  yum!

These cookies are everything and more! Great recipe, although I was little concerned with the amount of butter-- but it is right. I made them for my son's kindergarten feast and the first batch didn't make it there. I had to  make another. Use with the butter cream frosting II recipe-- yummy yummy yummy!!!

Very tasty rolled in cinnamon sugar mix as suggested by others, however, my batter turned out way moist and I had to add lots of extra flour to be able to roll these little guys into balls. Oh well. Still good though!

I'm really glad I picked this recipe! If your looking for something that you have all the ingredients for - this is it! I did as some of the others mentioned, rolling them in cinnamon sugar, and they turned out perfect.

Great recipe! Really quick, really easy. The cookies were delicious. I was surprised such a simple recipe could make such great cookies. I used butter instead of margarine. I think it gives the cookies a richer flavor. For variety, we rolled some cookies in cinnamon and nutmeg mixed with the sugar. Yummy also! A good recipe that hard to screw up.
