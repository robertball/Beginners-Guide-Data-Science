I used (cheap) white spumanti in this recipe and doubled it to make two servings, one each for my husband and I. We loved it. Don't feel like you have to go all out and buy the expensive stuff if you can help it, the cheap stuff tastes just as good.

A Bellini cocktail is a mixture of Italian Prosecco sparkling wine and peach purée or nectar and this recipe definitely hits the mark.  Perfect for brunch, summer picnic, or an afternoon on the water. Thank you Sanzoe for a classic recipe!

This was my first peach bellini experience and I don't think you can go wrong with champagne and peaches. I have a feeling I made a mistake - I pureed the skin with the peach. I'm not totally sure you are suppose to do that but I like it just the same.

I served these with Easter dinner this year and they were a hit!  I had to use frozen sliced peaches (thawed) and pureed.  Some guests added a small amount of sugar to theirs, due to the frozen peaches not being very sweet, but I thought they were great just as they were!  Thanks for this easy, tasty recipe!
