O I made this tonight with some provisions using hamburger, beef broth and green beans and carrots because i did not have lamb or peas.Used the directions and all other ingredients. It was fabulous and I deal with a 14 yr old critic who asked for seconds, this alone immediately put this into my favorites recipe box. Thanks John, I enjoy your light hearted humor while cooking, thank you for the flavor of food

I made this last night also using ground beef and it received rave reviews at dinner. I did use beef broth for the liquid since I had to use ground beef. I thoroughly enjoyed it, which is unusual for me. Also, hubby, adult son, and teenage daughter ate it happily-no complaints from anyone! Hurray!! Chef John, I enjoyed watching you prepare it, that helps me when I am trying something for the first time.

Omg de-lish. Eyeballed ingredents (as we irish do) and it came out perfect. Dubliner cheese works really well w the potatoes. Perfect alternative for those who dont like corned beef.

I've never had a cottage pie that I liked, they're always too bland, but made this one tonight on a whim, just because CJ hardly ever disappoints. I used ground beef and mixed veg, omitting rosemary and cinnamon, as they seemed more suited to lamb than beef. After tasting the beef mix, I wanted to boost the beefy flavor, so added 2 teaspoons beef base. Perfect flavor! I was worried that the beef mix was too thick, but after baking it was just right. I might add more cheese to the potatoes next time, or even toss some in with the beef. The bones of this recipe are great, producing a perfect pie that holds together but isn't dry at all. It could be easily adapted to other cuisines, using Mexican spices and topping with cornbread, or using soy sauce, Hoisin sauce and wasabi mashed potatoes for Asian flair.  Finally, a really, really good gluten-free casserole! Thanks, Chef.  And thanks for a new trick to remove oil from ground meat. I'll never try to drain hot oil again!

This recipe is wonderful.   I have no idea how anyone could call it bland - it is a delightful blend of amazing flavors. Everyone absolutely loved it!   I changed nothing except I had to substitute half a green pepper for half of the onion because I discovered that I only had half an onion in my fridge.  I think it's probably important to be patient when cooking the ground lamb to allow the liquid to evaporate (see the video). The potato topping was to die for - the Dubliner cheese (as opposed to a regular cheddar) added an amazing distinctive flavor.   If you use another meat and a different cheese, it's probably still really good,  but those changes would turn this recipe into something else completely.

ugh! way too greasy for my family. I would drain the meat before adding the flour next time. My family doesn't appreciate intense flavors, so I will cut down on all the spices and use a more mild cheddar in the potatoes.

Excellent!  This is truly the traditional shepherds  pie.  As the allrecipes.com  video on this states…Shepherds raised sheep not cow,  hence the use of lamb and not beef and the name "Shepherds Pie”.  I made this exactly as written and it was delicious. I did make a mushroom gravy to go on top. A great one dish meal; for a crowd, or dinner for two with plenty of leftovers!

This is one of the best Shepard's Pie's I've had in a long time!! Really liked that you could taste the cinnamon. I also added chopped celery and fresh carrots(note be sure to either cut fresh carrots really small or cook them before hand).I also suggest draining some of the grease from the pan after browning the meat. I think my favorite part of this recipe is the Dubliner cheese, it made the potatoes really unique!! Made this for St. Patrick's Day, and I will definately make it again, though my husband told me it better not be a whole year before we have it for dinner again!! 
THANK YOU FOR SHARING!!

Great Recipe. I made it exactly to recipe the first time as I always do and saved some customization to my tastes after establishing a baseline. For those of you who made it with beef you ought to try Shepherds pie sometime.

I had to use ground cow meat (not lamb,  cowboy pie? Ha!) But it was delicious any way.  Perfect recipe,  and Chef John is amaizing, great teacher and makes cooking and enjoyable experience. Sorry for my poor  English!.

I made this for St Pattys and overall it was pretty tasty.  I used 1 pound of ground beef and one pound of ground lamb.  I would suggest cutting the cinnamon as it really took over the dish I thought especially with the inherent nuttiness of the lamb.  Despite all of the ingredients i found it a little bland and may go with some cumin next time to give it something extra but overall it was pretty easy to make and the guests I had over went back for seconds.

Lamb is too expensive, we don't like mutton, so we use beef. With these changes the Shepards Pie is a real hit in our house.  I use this dish for pot-luck dinners a lot, and the dish comes home empty every time.  I think that says more than anything else.  Make it your way and enjoy. That's what it really is.

Wow!  This is great!  Only sub was chicken broth for water and I went long on the Dubliner cheese too.  For onions I like to use Shallots as i love the flavor.  Very nicely done, Chef John!  All who tried it loved it.

My Mom was 1st generation here from Ireland. I grew up eating Shepherd's Pie.  Did not ever think that I would find a recipe as good as I was use to. I saw this with the Dubliners cheese in the mashed potatoes and decided to try it. The ONLY substitution I made was using homemade meat broth in place of water as liquid. It was Spectacular!!! Made me wonder if Chef John had a bit of Irish in him. Definitely added to recipe box.
Additional note it would be nice if people rated the actual recipes on this site. Do not make several alterations and then give a poor rating because you do not like what you created. Write your own recipe and let us rate what you actually made.

I halved the recipe as it's just the 2 of us, but leftovers would have been very welcome! As a halfer, I used 3 cloves of garlic, cuz why not, a little extra ketchup, and had some mint on hand so chopped a bit of that in. It was so flavorful, I can't imagine how others think it is bland...season to taste!!! I used lamb, not 50/50 beef/lamb, or turkey, just go ahead and try it with the main ingredient-it is worth it! I did drain a bit of fat off after the browning, and used chicken broth instead of water-but that's it!! You are all in for a real treat with this one!

Delicious! I made it exactly like Chef John did the first time. Second time, I wanted to substitute a stout beer for the water. It intensified the flavors. Yum! The third time, I used Substitute "Low Carb Mashed Cauliflower" for the mashed potato crust. Excellent!

Wow!  What a great flavor!  The only change I made is that I used ground beef instead of lamb.  I was a little apprehensive about the different seasonings coming together, but it was definitely a flavor I wouldn't change!  I would also suggest using Dubliner® cheese and not an American cheddar...it really does make a difference!

I make this often, and I use ground moose. It is by far the best shepherd's pie I've ever had, and it is so good the next day for lunch...assuming my husband doesn't eat it all!

Cayenne pepper is mentioned in the directions, but not in the ingredients list.  How much should I add?  To Soccerwidow23, the video talks about draining the meat before adding the flour.

This came out exceptional - I did tweak a little. 
More rosemary and Garlic in the potato's.
I also braised some Lamb tips ( Trader Joe's ) with a little flour and tossed them in and cut back a little on the ground lamb.  It gave you Lamb chucks  every now and then. 
I must praise the potatoes with the Cream cheese and Cheddar Cheese, nice touch indeed gave it a real nice texture and they browned so nicely. Good Show !!

Works great with Ground beef in place of lamb. Also, instead of adding water to the ground beef mixture, I added a 15 oz. can of beef broth and omitted the salt. Yummy!

My first attempt at homemade Shepherd's Pie was a success! I replaced half the lamb with beef (I was lucky to find lamb as I live in the Southwest and is not usually stocked, my luck may be due to the fact I bought it St. Patrick's day weekend). I also spiced it only using salt and pepper and used beef broth instead of water for a richer gravy. I enjoyed mine with a very cold Guiness! I will make this again! Maybe even as a new tradition for St. Paddy's!

Really good!  Hubby & I love lamb so this was a fun way to celebrate St. Paddy's Day, having something new to try.  The cayenne gave this dish a nice kick.  Looking forward to sharing this with others next year.

We made it tonight for St Patrick's Day. Lamb is expensive! I will make it again but I'll probably use ground pork. The meat mixture is tasty and a little sweet. I've never cooked with rutabagas before. They turned such a lovely yellow. The colors were beautiful. The potato topping was sharp and rich. Altogether, yummy! Changing out the meat would make it affordable for most budgets.

Look no further for an authentic tasting Shepherd's pie! I lived in Ireland for a year. Although Shepherd's pie is not regularly served in restaurants, it is more of a "family" dish (think American meatloaf or tuna casserole). Made this today with half lamb half beef. Left out the rosemary (glad I did), and subbed cut green beans (pre-cooked to soften) instead of peas because my husband doesn't like peas. Otherwise pretty much followed exactly. The cinnamon is key! The entire family loved it! Will definitely make again!

I didn't find the flavors spectacular.  There are a lot of ingredients and not sure this was worth the work.  Husband loved it, though.

I made this tonight and the family lived it!  Even the  2 year old asked more. I will made this again.  I added a  small tub of  ricotta cheese to the mashed potatoes made them even creamier.

I intended to make this recipe exactly as directed until I got to the grocery store and realized lamb is $9.99 a pound and this calls for two pounds. [Beware!] Since there are two of us, I cut the entire recipe in half. My grocery (Meijer) doesn't carry frozen peas and carrots, so I had to buy a bag of each. [Beware!] My grocery also doesn't carry the cheese called for in this recipe, so I used the only "Irish" cheese I could find which was aged cheddar. [Beware] I don't have time to shop at multiple groceries or specialty stores. You'd think I would've said "heck with it" at this point, but I proceeded. As I said, I made the recipe EXACTLY as directed (except I cut it in half). It was just okay. A lot of work for an "okay" recipe. I would advise cutting out the cayenne pepper--it's not needed and seems to throw the flavor profile off. I might also use beef broth instead of water to give the gravy a little more flavor. That's my two cents. Sorry, Chef John. Usually I enjoy your recipes.

AMAZING!! first time making shepherd's pie for my irish husband and it was a hit! i will definately make this again, maybe just use a little less cinnamon next time. the cinnamon gives a great different flavor- like a secret ingredient- but it was a little too much for us

I tried this recipe with ground beef and followed the recipe as stated above.  The only problem was that it was too liquidy.  I think maybe because beef renders more fat than lamb??

Anyhow, it was still delicious!
Next time I make it, I will drain the beef before adding the rest of the ingredients.

Delish!  Thank you Chef John for a delicious recipe, we loved it!  I used ground turkey and instead of carrots I used organic frozen butternut squash and organic frozen sweet potatoes with the peas.  Yum!  All the flavors went together very nicely and I will make this again and again.

This was beyond good! Made with beef and beef broth but changed nothing else.  Friends who are beyond picky ate it and said several times how good it was.  This will go in my permanent recipe book.  Only changes I wil make when using beef will be to drain grease after browning beef, delete the cinnamon and use 1 tsp of rosemary but everything else is just perfect.

It was ok, not great.  Will make again with the following changes: ground beef, beef stock instead of water, tomato sauce instead of ketchup, no cinnamon, less rosemary. More cheese inside of potatoes and lots on top before baking.

Delicious! I did do a few things differently to suite my family's tastes...On a side note, I only made a 1/2 batch of this, as a full recipe would've been too much. Well, the grocery store only had a little over 1/2# of lamb (go figure), so I used ground sirloin for the rest of the meat called for. I omitted the cinnamon and rosemary, and added a bit more ketchup and a few shakes of worchestershire sauce. This was so good, that even a few pickier eaters loved it. I will def be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I LOVE lamb and cannot digest any cow products (meat or dairy). I have always used lamb as my mum was English and made shepherd's pie that way. Tonight I didn't have any potatoes so I used sweet potatoes (yams) & carrots but still followed Chef John's recipe. It was amazing!!!

This was a hit with my family.  We used the ground lamb.  I am not a cheese eater so we made it without the cheese, just a little extra milk and butter in the potatoes.  My husband and daughter then mixed in cheese after it was done.  I am thrilled to find a recipe I like.  I have always loved shepherd's pie.

This is wonderful!  I cooked the lamb separately so I could drain off the fat.  Went a little heavier on the rosemary and cinnamon, and added sauteed mushrooms along with the veggies.  Like other reviewers, I didn't know how much cayenne to add, so I made it a small sprinkle.  It's pretty with a light sprinkle of chives and paprika as garnishes.  I made this the day before and let the flavors blend overnight.  It was perfect!

I made this recipe back in March. I know, I know! It's the end of September!! It's almost October. It starts to get chilly in WNY. This is the time of year where I look for meals to make in the oven. This way I can take the chill off of the house without turning on the furnace. Anyway ...  I LOVE this!!! I've never had it before. So, I didn't change much. I used mixed frozen veggies, regular ole potatoes, rosemary from my cupboard and regular sharp cheddar because that's what I had on hand. Although I love Irish cheese, it just wasn't handy. The only thing I added was a dash (a whack on the back of the jar type dash) of curry. For some reason, for me, curry goes with lamb. My husband and I loved it!!! My kids are older and are starting to appreciate the "stronger" flavored foods such as lamb. They liked it as well. I dunno if they would have liked it ten years ago. But, I'm living in the now and will definitely make it again.

Followed this recipe to a "t." Think it was the cinnamon that wrecked it for us. Plus, it needed something else to make the flavors pop. If I ever attempt to make this recipe again, I'd use beef broth and stewed tomatoes instead of water. Maybe add some parsley, thyme, and oregano to the meat mixture.  Very disappointed in this recipe, which is unusual. Chef John rarely fails to please the taste buds with his recipes. This one, however, just did not pass the test.

I was had friends over for dinner a couple of weeks ago and wanted a one dish meal, that I could partially prepare a bit ahead of time (the meat mixture),  so I could spend time with company instead of the kitchen. I followed Chef John's  recipe with only some minor changes, using frozen corn and carrots, rice flour as a thickener (as one guest was gluten intolerant), and substituting 1/2 the water with broth. I was able to get the meat portion of the recipe done, and start the potatoes just when folks arrived. In addition to the Irish cheddar, butter, and cream cheese, I also added a clove of minced garlic simmered in 1/2 cup of light cream to the potatoes. This recipe is easy, delicious, and everyone loved it!

I love Dubliner sliced with crackers or just by itself w/ a glass of wine.  Putting it into the potatoes knocked this recipe outta the ball park!  This is the Shepherd's Pie recipe I've been looking for.  I only made a 1/2 recipe for 2 people.   The cinnamon is a must!  I followed the recipe using the same ingredients, with minor changes because I had to:   used small cut up leftover leg of lamb from last night's dinner, cut the rosemary to 1/2 tsp (all I had)  and used about 1/2 tsp of ground thyme; using the fresh diced carrots, I threw them into the  potato boiling water to cook for about 5 minutes then mixed them in with the frozen peas, etc.  - I didn't have frozen carrots and this worked great.  All in all 5+ stars.  This has the flavors I've been searching for in Shepherd's Pie - my hubby's favorite! I'll bump up the spices I was short on next time, but probablly not by much. Thanks, Chef!

Excellent! This makes a delicious  and huge Shepherds Pie. Chef John always leads! I had 2 pounds ground lamb from my supermarket (just asked the butcher) and went totally Irish with Irish butter, Irish cheese,  Irish Guinness beer instead of water for an amazing result Wow!!

This was great! We raise sheep and needed to be more creative with how we eat it.  (My husband LOVES lamb, I think its OK, not a fan of the gamey taste)  This was so good and not gamey with all the other ingredients.   I will make it again!

This was an excellent recipe for my first time traditional irish dish. Since my fiancee is half Irish I thought it would be a good idea to make an irish dish for St Patrick's Day in honor of his heritage and in remembrance of his veteran father. I added mushrooms for a little twist, used lamb shank chunks instead of ground lamb and instead of peas and carrots...I used mixed vegetables. Delightful dish that we enjoyed on our candlelit romantic dinner.

When the recipe is followed exactly, the meat mixture is actually pretty mild tasting, and lacking flavor. We fixed it up by doubling the seasoning, adding chicken broth and as a last ditch effort to boost the flavor, my boyfriend dropped a curry cube into it. As for the potatoes, I LOVED the cayenne pepper in it, giving them a surprise kick! I would make this again, but with my own modifications. also I would double the mashed potatoes, since they provided a very thin layer.

I made this recipe today and completely fell in love with it. I followed the comments and used beef broth instead of water. I actually used a pound of ground chicken and ground beef since my husband actually used the 2nd pound of ground beef. It was so delicious that I ate more than I should have. I will definitely be making this again!

This is the first shepherd's pie I've ever made and this recipe was followed almost to the letter. The filling was made as directed except I used beef instead of lamb and beef broth instead of water. It seemed to need more flavor (I love flavor!) and it was a little too runny. Perhaps I could add more ketchup, less broth, and some other spices to play around with the flavors next time. For the mashed potatoes, I used red potatoes. They were boiled with garlic and salt. I melted 2 TBSP butter and 3 oz of cream cheese together, adding cashew milk to thin out a bit while still leaving it thick and creamy. Potatoes and creamy sauce were blended in a mixer. Cayenne pepper was added along with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Forgot to add the cheese before starting to spread on top of the filling...oops! Will definitely add that next time! I will be playing around with the filling flavors, but it's a start.

Made this recipe exactly as written the first time and thought it was delicious. Very flavorful and filling. The second time I made it, I adjusted it just a little for my taste and it was even better (for me). Instead of ketchup I used Sriracha sauce, and used Guinness for half of the water. Definitely in my rotation, but I will try it with other meats as the lamb was expensive. I'm also going to add some garlic to the mashed potatoes; helps keep the vampires away.

Incredible!  I didn't have lamb so used lean ground beef and it was perfect.  My husband took one taste and mumbled 'keeper' .  Now THAT is a compliment!  I can't imagine using instant mashed, the Yukon gold potatoes are the only way to go.  Thank you so much! I've been looking for something new to put in the rotation and I don't need to look any further.

Really, really, really good!  I subbed the lamb out for ground Italian sausage and oh man, yum!  The potatoes alone are to die for and reminded me of the inside of a pierogie. It was a big hit in our household and I'll definitely be making it again!

This is a great recipe. I made a few changes. I only had 1 pound of lamb on hand, so I reduced the other ingredients slightly. For the meat mixture, I added ½ teaspoon of smoked paprika to the regular paprika, and I used fresh carrots and frozen peas. I also added some chopped canned tomatoes, added some worcestershire sauce, and replaced the water with homemade stock. For the mashed potatoes, the only change I made was using garlic chive cream cheese, which was the only one I had left. I loved the addition of the cinnamon, it took the flavor to a whole new level. I've tried many shepherd's pie recipes, and this will be the one I'll stick with from now on. Even my son, who usually is not crazy about shepherd's pie, devoured this one.

I halved the recipe and used ground beef instead of lamb. I'm sure it's even better with the lamb.
My husband, who is a picky eater, really enjoyed this dish. It's a keeper!

Though I liked it and it was fun to make and put all the ingredients together, it just didn't come up to the flavor I was expecting.  I used 1# ground lamb and 1# ground beef.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written.  For us it was good, but not great.  Maybe it was in the Irish Cheese...we just did not care for it and seemed to give the potatoes an odd taste.  But, that is purely our tastebuds.

I followed the recipe as directed but added some Montreal seasoning, ketchup and pepper after tasting it. Too bland, and I am not sure why I can't find a pie recipe with layers of flavor. I am not sure how to fix this, maybe use beef broth instead of water? I really liked the potato topping.   koriander

Great recipe and FINALLY a shepherd's pie with lamb.  I've never seen a shepherd herding cows.  It's 9:30 in the morning still this recipe made me drool.  I skipped the cream cheese, there's enough fat in the potatoes without it and the taste doesn't suffer without it either.

I just made this recipe for a St. Patrick's Day party and it got rave reviews!  Honestly this was the best Shepherd's Pie I have ever eaten.  I followed the directions almost exactly.  My local grocer did not have ground lamb so I used ground beef instead and followed the rest of the recipe as written and it was delicious!  The entire tray was eaten in only a few minutes, thanks Chef John this is a keeper!

I made this last night using beef which was all I had in my refrigerator. It turned out so great! My husband loved it and took the leftovers to work for his lunch. it really is easy to follow and the meat mixture is so fragrant and tasty I really loved it.  I added a  dash of chili powder to the meat mixture just to give it some bite and what can I say - they gobbled it all up!

Every one liked it & it served all 7 of us.  Took longer to prepare then we thought it would so will allow more time in future.  No changes on the potatoes but with the meat we used hamburger seasoned with the onions, salt, pepper, 21 season, katsup & garlic & used beef broth.  Changed the veggies to green beans & corn.

Had to make some revisions as my market did not have Dubliner cheese or lamb. Used ground round and brick cheese,  and used beef broth instead of just water. It was wonderful!  Next time I will try another market and try half lamb and half beef.

This was delicious!  Because ground lamb was very expensive, I used one pound of ground lamb and one pound of ground beef (instead of two pounds of lamb).  Next time, I will not add so much water to the meat mixture because it was a little "soupy."  Also, since I adde dth ewhole block of Dubliner cheese (shredded), the potatoes were a bit thick to spread, so I would add more milk.  But, overall, easy to make and very tasty!

The whole pan was gone in a day! I really didn't taste much of the cinnamon so maybe a pinch more of that next time.  I mixed the cream cheese and the Dubliner cheese in with the potatoes but I think next time instead of mixing the Dubliner in, I will shred it fresh and raw on the top when it comes out of the oven.  I think that will give it more of a kick with the cheese.

Delicious! I watched the video and then made the recipe. I used ground turkey and low sodium chicken stock for the liquid. The rosemary went very well with the turkey. I forgot to add the ketchup, but I don't feel like it was missed. I only had extra old white cheddar, but that worked too.  Definitely a keeper!  I will try it with the lamb one day when I have it.

Whole family liked this even though I used 2.5lbs venison (no need to worry about fat!). I might cut back a bit on the cinnamon, and i used fresh carrots which I cooked w/ onion and meat. Also used sharp yellow cheddar (dubliner would def be better tho), and leftover mashed potatoes since i had it on-hand; I added cheese and cayenne to them, no cream cheese or butter due to high level of whipping cream and butter already present. A bit soupier than i would of liked, but maybe that was me not timing the thickening time. Hint: if your pan looks full like mine was, put a roll pan under it..it will bubble over. I will definitely make again!

OH my gosh this was so good.  I actually split the recipe into two different ones.  I have a step daughter that doesn't eat red meat.  For hers I used turkey and added a bit more butter.  For ours I spit it between ground lamb and turkey.  It was so good.

So delicious!  I love shepherd's pie, and especially loved the homemade gravy in this one..  and the potatoes.  Perfect and yummy.  It was even great for leftovers.

Was really excited to try this, but ended up being very disapointed. Made exactly as recipe stated but when I tasted it before adding the potatoes it had no real flavor. Ended up adding more ketchup, worcestershire, balsamic vinegar and spices to achieve a satisfying result. I also felt that the cream cheese made the potatoes a little rubbery in texture. Guess it's not bad as a starting point.

I had leftover leg of lamb from easter dinner.  So I diced that up.  The other thing i changed was adding the "thin mushroom gravy leftovers" to the quantity of water.  Still added all the spices called for in the recipe.  "This was a wonderful meal".  Will make again with either ground beef or lamb.

This recipe was devine!  I think the cinnamon and the fresh rosemary are what make this dish a stand-out. I used ground buffalo because that's what I had in the freezer, but next time I'll try the lamb.  The Irish cheese, cream cheese and egg yolk make the topping really special and alllow for that lovely browning of the top of the pie.

This is pretty good - I enjoyed making it, but it wasn't loved by my husband. That might be because it was lamb, and I generally make Shepherds' pie with ground beef. However, I enjoyed it I just didn't think it was spectacular.

It was wonderful  it was the first time I made shepherds pie. I thought it was time consuming to made as you have a lot going on at one time, however my husband and daughter loved it and I have enough for another meal.Next time I will use all beef,I use 1/2 beef1/2 lamb I do not like lamb.

This recipe was phenomenal! i used ground beef because I don't eat babies and 2c. chicken broth in place of the water. It came out exactly like the video. The Dubliner cheese really makes it. YUUUUM!

Made this for a pot luck. It's definitely a large enough recipe for it. I used a blend of lamb and beef. It tasted good. I just think that the meat mixture would benefit from the richness of a good stout or a bold red wine. I'll give it a try next time.

This is a fantastic recipe! I made it with ground beef and added thinly sliced celery (cooked with the onions) and used leftover mashed potatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, including adding the cinnamon, which is known to be great with lamb. It was a hit in our house. Will definitely make this again.

Really good! Mostly followed recipe. Didn't have peas so substituted frozen corn. Used fresh carrots which added texture. Used Idaho potatoes because that's what I had. Used 10x10" casserole which probably made it deeper. Cooked double the time recommended but oven was lower temp than expected, so there's that. Would recommend and would make again.

This was thoroughly approved by my shepherd's pie-loving English hubby.  The only change was that I used a mixture of lamb and beef because I didn't have enough of either.

Made this for  a group of women in my book club. Followed recipe pretty much as written, other than I used organic ground beef and added about a tblsp of ground cumin. Was great! I will try it with ground lamb next time and I'm sure it will be just as good!

When I made this, I should have drained the fat after browning the meat. I don't think I had the heat on the burner up high enough either because the pan didn't sizzle after I put the water in, and I simmered it for three times as long as the recipe calls for and it still came out looking like catfood. The potatoes are also really thick. I wish this website would post recipes that didn't need any tweaking, but here we are. Follow your gut and don't blindly follow a recipe. Also, in the video, chef John absolutely didn't use 2 1/2 cups of water, that's crazy

Very flavorful and the whole family loved it. I pretty much followed the recipe, but added fresh carrots to the frozen vegetables, added some thyme, subbed beef broth for water. Didn't have cream cheese for the potatoes, used sour cream instead. The cinnamon, carrots and lamb made for a craveable, almost sweet taste. There is another CJ recipe for shepherds pie, but this one is the real winner.

I made this with @ 2pounds of ground beef, omitted the ketchup, and added extra beef both.  I also used more potatoes for the topping.  I had a parmesan blend cheese that I put mixed into the hot potatoes.  Topped potatoes with shredded cheddar cheese before baking.  I ended up with a 9x 13 dish, that provided plenty of tasty leftovers.  Served with brown gravy on the side.  Will definitely make this again.

This was delightful, tasty, and such a wonderful dinner. Easy enough to do, and I look forward to cooking it again. Everybody in the house loved it.

Wonderful!  Made it almost exactly  except I dont eat lamb, so used beef.  Sorry for rating with modification, but I tasted lamb once 45 yrs ago and never again, lol.  The rest of the recipe is exactly like my mother made for us growing up.  Such a comfort food.  Easy and pretty inexpensive.  Thanks for sharing

I used extra lean ground beef rather than lamb so I did not add the olive oil. Technically I believe I turned it into a "Cottage pie". Used fresh rosemary from my garden. The filling was delightful. Very flavorful and moist. I had to leave the cream cheese out of the potatoes due to allergy. I used about half a cup of milk but should have added more, they weren't fluffy enough but still tasted good. The family liked it but didn't rave about it. I'll make it again.

Skip the cinnamon. Definitely not good. Otherwise, good recipe. We swapped lamb with ground beef. Added Lima’s and corn. Muenster cheese baked on top. Turned out good, but definitely won’t be adding cinnamon next time.

I love this! My mother bless her used to make a version of this when I was a girl. It was bland but this is fantastic. I love the cinnamon in the lamb and the cheese in the potatoes. Delicious.

The recipe was great, I did however, use a leftover 
smoked leg of lamb chopped up pretty small, and also added Worcestershire. I thought the depth of flavor was exceptional and the sticky thickness of the mashed potatoes worked well.

Regrets.  I gave it 5 stars because the Potatoes are great.  But I detest cinnamon. But I though I'd put it in, it would enhance food like salt without making it salty... Nope. Cinnamon sucks, even in tiny doses. So if you leave out  the cinnamon this is a terrific shepherds pie. Maybe put some turnip in it.... just a thought.

It tastes good and all, but it is a lot of effort for what it is: minced lamb and mashed potatoes, simple foods. It really takes 1.5 hour from start to finish, including 25 min baking and loads of dishes. It could benefit from more veggies as well. The water is too much so I used less.

Not my favorite.  It was easy to make and I followed the recipe as stated.  I did not care for the cinnamon or paprika.  The Irish cheese did add to the dish, and I will definitely use that again for the potato crust.

Made with Chicken that I marinated in Dale's Steak sauce.  We are GF so used cornstarch to make gravy rather than flour.  Next time we will add a little more salt and pepper, but otherwise great!

I used ground chuck and canned peas and carrots. Did not use cinnamon...just sounded like it wouldn't fit with the other flavors. I also cubed Velveeta in small pieces and put it on top of the meat mixture.

Excellent result, and actually really easy to make.  I didn’t cook the carrots completely through (on purpose) to provide some texture and crunch, but followed the recipe to the letter (I did sub in ground turkey for the lamb) and it was delicious.

My market didn't have ground lamb but they kindly ground up the lamb steaks that I chose.  So the meat was extra lean.  Frozen peas and carrots were al dente (which is a good thing) and the mashed potato top (for which I used the Dubliner cheese as Chef John recommended) was really good!  I can't find "Yukon" potatoes any more...wondering if the name is now trademarked...can only find "yellow" potatoes. They worked though!   The pie held up beautifully for several days until we finished it off.  I will make this again!  I did pick up a few tips from watching the video.  It's  well worth watching!

I wanted a different kick to the pie, so went with 50% ground beef, 25% ground lamb, and 25% Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage.  For vegetables, also added frozen sweet corn, and finely chopped red pepper and zucchini.  After cooking the meat with the veges, drained the  bulk of the fat and replaced with beef broth.  Modified the spice quantities to taste since the hot sausage added more kick.  We took to a St Patty's Day party and was a big hit.

I made it for St. Patty’s themed Bunco on March 1st. 
Super easy and delicious! I used ground beef and added a splash of Worcester sauce to the meat and veggies. FYI, I used a small can of cream of mushroom and Used gluten free flour as a few have gluten allergies. So delicious!! Btw, I did this partially on the stove and added everything to the crock pot to finish the last bit of cooking and it traveled so well. So many compliments!! You can also go 100% keto using mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes but still use the added ingredients for the original mashed potatoes recipe. Thank you for an easy dish!!

I had leftover roast venison that I chopped up and substituted for the lamb, and used beef broth instead of water, and it was fantastic.  A great mix of flavors, complex yet easy to put together.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe!  Definitely will make again.

 I made a few changes:

--Used ground beef
--Added a package of brown gravy mix to the spices stirred in with the meat
--didn't use cinnamon; couldn't wrap my head around cinnamon in this recipe
--Used beef broth instead of water
--(I cheated) Used Bob Evans family-sized original mashed potatoes instead of making the mashed potatoes from scratch.  Fixed according to microwave directions, then picked back up with spices/cheese/etc. in the recipe.

Granted, I used ground beef instead of lamb so this might not be a fair review. However, the cinnamon ruined it for me. I did like the cheese mixed into to mashed potatoes instead of the standard cheese topping.

Slightly modified the recipe used broccoli and mushrooms,instead of peas and carrots. Used 1/2 beef broth and water with a bit of corn starch and flour for thicker, and the best part I used venison instead of lamb.

I made this with half lamb and half beef since my family isn't used to the lamb. It was really good. Now, however, I make it with all beef. I use brown gravy to add moisture and a dash of paprika. Also discovered that we love the sharper taste of cheddar instead of the smooth Dubliner flavor.

This is a great recipe! It’s tasty, easy and versatile . I didn’t have lamb so I used ground turkey which is leaner. I followed all instructions and it makes a savory dinner.

Not knowing if my family would like lamb I made this with ground beef and everyone loved it.  Without the added flavor of the lamb though I think I might add more garlic and rosemary next time.  I'll have to make a half recipe with lamb as well for my husband and I to see if we think the others would like it.  Definitely a keeper as all of Chef John's recipes are!!

I enjoyed the recipe as it was written. I added corn because it just seemed right and I used Swiss cheese as a substitute because the other wasn’t available. I can see this working with all kinds of veggies. Thank you for sharing!

This is so delicious! I made it on St. Patrick's Day. I used Dubliner Cheese, as suggested and that along with the other ingredients gave it so much flavor. Next time that I make it, I think I'll sprinkle the cheese on top instead of stirring it into the potatoes.

I really liked it, but thought that the meat was bland. The recipe doesn't call for seasoning the meat! I'll either season the lamb or use ground beef next time.

Otherwise it was a big hit!

EDIT: I substituted 1lb of ground lamb with ground bison and it was perfect! I also did 3lbs of potatoes, omitted the cayenne, and sprinkled the top of the spread potatoes with paprika.

It made a beautiful sauce! I did use cut up leftover green beans that were still partially uncooked. Worked great. I tripled the recipe as I had 12.  I thought I would have leftovers.  No such luck!   It's a really good recipe.

I used really lean ground beef since I did not have the lamb. I cannot eat onions or garlic, so I seasoned the meat with cumin and parsley. Everyone loved it.

We made this last night. If you use fresh carrots instead of frozen you may want to increase the cook time a bit, or partially cook them before assembling the dish. IMPORTANT:  The recipe says to use LEAN ground lamb. Take that to heart. Our lamb was a bit fatty, so we had to drain some grease off the browned meat. This recipe is a keeper, as written. Thanks for another great recipe, Chef John (and yes, we included the iconic cayenne)!

This was absolutely delicious. I made this exactly as written,  except for cutting the recipe in half (there are only two of us). It set up beautifully in an 8x8 pan. 

I'm not sure if any other reviewers had as much of an issue finding ground lamb as I did, but here's what I did in a pinch: after scouring 3 grocery stores trying to find ground lamb, I ended up just getting lamb leg steaks. When I got home, I cut out the bones, kept on the fat, cut into chunks,  put the chunks in the freezer for 30 mins, and then pulsed the lamb in a food processor a few times. This yielded an absolutely  lovely minced lamb that cooked up wonderfully. I liked it so much, in fact, that I plan to keep doing it this way in the future (even if I'm lucky enough to find ground lamb)! Make sure not to overprocess the lamb, as you will end up with a meat paste. It truly only takes a few pulses. Also, it helps to stick the food processor bowl and blade in the freezer along with the lamb. Happy cooking!

I made this in 12 ramekin bowls as a first course.  It was awesome.  It looked delicious and everyone loved it. Dubliner cheese makes a real difference.  Also - don't forget to spoon out the grease after you brown the lamb.

I have made this twice.  Well, not this excally, a few changes here and there,  but basically. Love it, very hearty. It will warm you on a chilly day and heats up well in the microwave.

Great flavor!! Took a little longer to prep than I planned but that may be more a reflection of me than the recipe. This is a keeper!

I made it with hamburger meat since I didn’t have lamb.  My husband who is a meat and potato kind of eater loved it. I’m definitely making this again!

Easy recipe, made it excatly the way recipe called for.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is the cinnamon was a little over powering.  The next time I'll cut the cinnamon in half.

Really Good flavor profile, seasonings were amazing. I used extra Cayenne and extra garlic (of course).  Added a bag of corn and subbed Beef for Lamb as do not like Lamb.  Will make again.

Made this recipe on St. Patrick's day and followed the recipe on the ingredients to the meat portion and it was delicious in itself.  Kinda did my own thing on the mashed potatoes on top, and it came out excellent.  May family raved and I took the leftovers to our small group on Sunday night and they loved it as well.  Great recipe.  This will be my "go to" recipe for Shepherd's Pie from now on.

This was pretty good. I had to doctor up the meat mix as it was bland so added more salt and garlic powder. The potatoes were realky tasty, and my family ate this up. not as firm as other shepherd's pie recipes, mine came out more juicy and the potaties were soft. Will make again!

We made this for St Pat’s day.  Used ground turkey instead of lamb, and used beef and chicken broth. Followed recipe with no other modifications. My family really enjoyed and will put into rotation when we have leftover potatoes.

Best Ever!!
Every year someone in my house makes this for St. Patrick's Day but it is always bland. This year I decided to make it. I followed the recipe except for the lamb, I used ground beef and added more vegetables. This is the best recipe ever. It was so full of flavor and my family loved it. They even ate the vegetables in it. I made two large trays and both were gone. I don't know if it was the cinnamon or not but this is one fantastic dish.

I've made this recipe several times, the first time by the exact recipe, and each time tweaking it here and there just to try something new. I love this recipe, my husband loves it, and all my friends and coworkers do, too. I've had about eight people ask in the last three days off I was going to make my shepherd's pie this year, so I just threw two into the oven for St. Patrick's day dinner. Erin go bragh!

Good, but it’s better with some changes.

I made it pretty much as written the first time (beef instead of lamb) but found the spice combination with cinnamon and rosemary a bit odd for us.  
I would change to thyme from rosemary and skip the cinnamon altogether. Other changes I did/would change are smoked paprika instead of regular, added 1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, beef broth instead of water in the meat mixture.
Went for a cheesier potato mixture, increasing the butter to 1/4 cup, increase cream cheese to 1/2 cup, changed the 1/4 lb Irish cheese to 1 cup shredded cheddar (didn’t have Irish cheese), added 1/8 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 to 1 full can of evaporated milk for a smoother mashed potato. 
Made about 8 large servings.

Kind of a lot of trouble for a recipe that turns out to-do.  The lamb is more expensive than beef (here) and doesn't bring much additional flavor to the party.  If I did it over, I would use beef and maybe add more of the seasonings.

Authentic and very flavorful. I only had beef, but next time will make with lamb and update my review.  Also I didn't measure the potatoes and made too much, but that's not a bad thing!

My husband (Irish) raved about this recipe. I reduced the quantities by half, but otherwise made it exactly as written. The big surprise was that I liked it as well, and I was concerned that I wouldn’t like lamb. We’re loking forward to having leftovers!

I know, I know shepherd’s pie calls for lamb but I didn’t have chopped lamb in the freezer and I live out in God’s country so it was made with beef. What a great recipe!!!  Thank you chef John ,especially for the video! I usually don’t watch the videos but now I will start because yours helped me a lot with this recipe! I added fresh frozen corn from the cob also !This will be my go to Beef (sorry!) Shepherds Pie recipe forever?? PS.. I also didn’t have the correct cheese,but the simple cheddar I had worked fine.

I love Sheperd's pie & wanted to try a different version. I made it  1/24/18  This was not the version for me.  With the exception of one other person out of 5, No one else tried it.  And although I like lamb, I was not a fan of it This dish. I found the potatoes to be too dry & flavorless. I don't like peas & this dish worked well without peas. I used corn & carrots. As a short cut, I began boiling my potatoes while the meat simmered & peeled them afterward. I noticed that I prefer cheddar cheese as I couldn't taste this cheese much in the dish.

What everyone else said!  I used 95% lean ground beef and fresh diced carrots instead of frozen, because it's what I had in the house.  Eye-balled the measurements, and it came out great!  Easy to put together, and tasted even better the next day.  Going to try this next time with lamb!

Followed the recipe except I substituted ground turkey for the lamb and Cracker Barrel white cheddar since these are the ingredients I had on hand.  My kids 10,13, and 15 enjoyed it and all had seconds.  I had to stop one of them from getting thirds and overeating:).  Very tasty, will definitely save this recipe and make it again.

Great recipe. I always used seasoning packets in the past. Followed the recipe exactly except for substituting a cup of the water for a cup of Guinness. The recipe produced strong pungent flavors like a good shepherds pie does. This will be my new go to recipe.

I was skeptical of the cinnamon but the meat mixture is fantastic!  Mixing the peas and carrots with the meat was a nice touch.  We didn’t have Irish cheese so sprinkled some cheddar on top.  Yum!

Surprised at how easy this was to make. I covereted this to a vegetarian friendly recipe by subbing lamb with seasoned tofu crumbles and making a veggie broth using vegetable boullions and the water from the boiled potatoes. I added a wee bit more rosemary, cinnamon and ketchup than the recipe calls for, but not too much. Turned out super delicious. This was my first time making a shepards pie and I loved it.

A few people said the meat/gravy was too soupy. If you use the broth/water as needed as per the ingredients list and you won't have that issue. I thought it was quite flavorful.

OMG!!!
This recipe is a huge hit, I've made it a few times. We call it, 'Our version of Irish Shepherd's Pie'.
 Like some of you I didn't have all the ingredients listed so I substituted only a few; Used ground pork instead of lamb, grated CHEDDAR cheese instead of Irish and didn't add the Cinnamon and Cayenne Pepper(was out of cinnamon and have young kids so no Cayenne). I love the thickness of the potatoes and the savoury filling is to die for. We eat it with a side of  Coleslaw (Restaurant Coleslaw found here as well) .

I didn't use the butter and oil when I cooked the meat, just cooked it up the same way I always cook up hamburger meat.  After seeing some of the reviews about how heavily seasoned the meat was, I decided to forgo the paprika and cinnamon.  I did not intend to forget the rosemary, but I did.  :(
I put more butter and milk in my potatoes than it calls for, but I like them moist.
I definitely noticed the lack of rosemary, but I don't think it lost out on anything by not having the paprika and cinnamon.  Definitely a recipe that I will be making again!

Wow, this is restaurant quality  shepherd's pie that I would order again and again.  I made it as directed with only one exception... I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of Dubliner  cheese (oh yes, and I did drain the fat from the lamb before I added the flour).  Thank you Chef John!!

Yes Yes Yes! I made with ground beef, hubby's preference. Made exactly as prescribed. I'm not a big measurer so just eyeballed the spices, the cinnamon was absolutely lovely in this, if you omit it, you're missing out! Dubliner cheese is a must. Thank you Chef John for another amazing creation!

This was very good. I added a little worchestire with the ketchup because I thought it would add more meaty flavor to the stew. I liked this addition. I used leftover lamb roast but I look forward to trying it with ground lamb.

Chef John has hit another one out of the park.  

I did alter the recipe as I could not find ground lamb. 

 I substituted ground lamb with 1# beef chuck cut into 1 inch squares and 2#s of lamb shoulder chops.  I seared the meat in a little olive oil and then added chicken stock (about 1-2 cups…{you could probably use a little wine or beer in this step}) brought to boil and then simmered for about 90 minutes.  I removed the meat, discarded the bones and then diced the meat finely.

I added the flour as a slurry to the juices in the pan and proceeded with step 3 ingredients as well as stirring the meat back into the mixture.  

I followed the recipe according to Chef John after that.

It was the best Shepherds Pie ever.  I can't wait to try make it again.  Perhaps I'll slip a little stout into it.

This was really good, made twice as much as I expected. Next time I would drain the fat off the ground lamb before adding any of the other ingredients.

I did not have lamb, but  I used venison instead along with beef broth instead of plain water.  It was THE BEST shepherd's pie I have ever had.  My family said it was definitely a keeper.  I texted  all my grown kids with the link and said they HAD to make this no questions asked because mom "said so" .  I have no idea how or why (really don't care either) these humble ingredients that I use all the time came together to create such a tasty masterpiece.  All I know is it is the BEST!

Wow! This was incredibly flavorful and will definitely now be made again and again. I made this as part of a birthday dinner (which happens to be St Patty's Day). I had about 14 people, most of whom don't have very exotic or adventurous tastebuds, so I chose to use ground beef vs lamb (in hind sight, I have no doubt that this would be even more incredible with the lamb, can't wait to try it) everyone raved about this dish. I had another which was good but this is the one people went back for! I was so surprised at the flavor combination! I couldn't believe how the cinnamon came through in a totally indescribable way! It was only an 1/8 tsp but it was awesome. You really have to try it and see for yourself. But seriously...try it!!!

I'm not a big fan of "gamey" meats so I mixed the lamb 50/50 with grass fed beef. Yes, there was quite a bit of grease when browned so I used the Chef John paper towel trick to get rid of most of it. I used homemade turkey broth as my liquid because it was there and I needed to use it up. I also added a glug of sherry to the gravy. 

I used Kerrygold Dubliner cheese and unfortunately couldn't really taste it. Next time I'll use a good extra sharp white cheddar, and put a little on top too. 

Keep the paper towel trick and the sherry.

Best ever Shepherd's Pie.  Very authentic, perfectly spiced and the use of the Irish Cheddar in the potatoes that the total topper for this dish and best of all, this is the first Shepherd's Pie I've had that was not bland, but very very flavorful and tasty.

I made this with ground Angus beef, which is a bit greasier than standard ground beef. I'd recommend going with as lean a meat as you can--lamb if you can, 93% lean ground beef if not--and going easy on the olive oil in the beginning. The potatoes turned out well; if you have a standing mixer, use the whisk attachment when you're adding the cheeses into the potatoes for best results. All in all, a fantastic recipe.

Very tasty, this. Made it with ground beef, as that's what we had. Ground lamb would be great, I'm sure. I drained the beef before adding the flour.  Otherwise, pretty much followed the recipe.

The recipe is full of taste and although I wouldn't want to deviate from a classic I found it a little too rich for my taste.  I put in half the amount of both cheeses and I still found it heavy. I would make it again but I would forego all the cheese and maybe grate a little on top.  It was very good though

I followed the receipt to the T, way too greasy, I would eliminate the olive oil or drain it before adding the flour, and I think 2 1/2 cups of water is way too much. The taste was good, but it definitely was way way too greasy.

I think this is a super good recipe.  I prefer Russet potatoes and they worked perfectly in place of the Yukon Golds.  Another plus to this dish is that leftovers reheat wonderfully too!

Really good. I didn't have peas, but I did have part of a cauliflower left over and some fresh carrots, so I chopped and added them along with some fresh red and green peppers, and let them simmer with the meat before putting in the oven.  I put it in the oven in the same dutch oven I used to cook all the ingredients on the stove.

Made this using the spices and subbing ground moose and venison. Made it carb friendly by topping with cauliflower mashed potatoes.  Spices worked perfectly for the wild game and the cheese was amazing in the cauli-mash! Saved this one to favorites

This is an excellent recipe! It works just as well with ground turkey. I added dry mustard and celery seed with the spices instead of the rosemary. Whole family loved it.

I have to revise nearly every recipe I make, even paleo. This was no exception. With IBD, you have no choice. I used cauliflower 'potatoes', a low-carb substitute for flour, hamburger (only because I had no lamb), and Daiya cheese. The spices were good and the flavor was very good. I will definitely repeat.

Admittedly, I used ground beef because that's what I had, and I used instant potatoes (I know: shame, shame) because I am the mom of three young children. But my biggest complaint is that the "gravy" was super-watery and I even added an extra tablespoon of flour to try to thicken it up. I will probably make it again with the lamb and add even more flour. The flavor was great and my husband really enjoyed it, so I think it's worth another try.

Delicious Irish comfort meal! Making this dish with lamb is a must--won't be the same with beef! I followed the recipe very closely. About half a cup less water, and 4oz extra peas/carrots since I couldn't justify saving the little extra bit of the bag veggies came in, no other changes. Totally worth the work and wait! To reviewers complaining about ingredient availability--you will have to go to a full service grocery store for Dubliner/lamb and possibly Yukon Gold potatoes, but just do it. And if you don't like lamb, then making a recipe that features lamb doesn't seem to make a lotta sense. One of my top Chef John dishes!!!

I've never had Shepherd's Pie before. I happened to have some lamb in the freezer and decided to make this. It was good. Not great, but good. If I happen to have the ingredients around I'd make it again.

I made it for my husband's birthday and he  loved it!  I couldn't find Irish cheese, so I used cheddar.  I also used 1/2 Elk and 1/2 Lamb to reduce the fat a bit... It was a hit.

I made this from start to finish in my big cast iron skillet. I did change some things. I omitted the cayenne, the peas and the onions and just used steamed baby carrots. I doubled the cheese, and instead of fresh garlic and rosemary I just used garlic powder and dried rosemary. I used cream where it called for milk and did drain off a lot of fat as one reviewer suggested. I used a bit more ketchup and a splash of Worcestershire sauce but I think next time I will put A1 in the lamb mixture before I bake it.  All in all I think it will be a keeper for me.

This was AMAZING! The only change i made was fresh carrots (which should have gone in the pot finely diced with the onions) and canned peas. Over all this one is a keeper.

I made this exactly how chef John explained and it turned out perfect and beautiful.  The thick gravy was perfect.  And, no, don't drain the meat!  I love Shepards pie, and this is the one I we'll always follow.  Thanks, John!!!!

I did make a few changes, used ground beef, beef broth instead of water, fresh carrots instead of frozen, added a small can of corn, 1/4 cup of worsterschire and a couple splashes of red wine.  I also added a tablespoon of butter broken into small pieces on top of the potatoes.This turned out delicious and I will make again.

Delicious!  Have never made any kind of shepherd's pie but will make this again. I did replace half the lamb with lean ground beef mostly due to cost, but wouldn't have bothered to try this with all beef - the lamb and spices/herbs are what make it special.  I used fresh carrots (sliced)  for better flavor and fried these together with the onion and garlic so they wouldn't still be crunchy after baking.  Also drained the meat. Potatoes are superb; I sprinkled a small amount of extra cheese over the top of them and the dish browned beautifully. Protect your oven - will bubble over just a little.  :). Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I made a few subs (bison instead of lamb, mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes, almond milk instead of regular milk). I also couldn't find Irish cheese for the life of me so I used fresh pepper jack which gave it a nice kick of spice.

I made it at the last minute for St Patrick's  day using what I had in the freezer - venison and mixed veggies.  It was delicious!!  I eyeballed ingredients and added too much milk to the potatoes.  (I was afraid they would dry out).  That was a mistake. It looked great, but when I put the spoon in, they ran into the meat mixture.  It was still amazing, even though it didn't look pretty in the bowl.  I'll definitely make it again, but I'll follow directions next time.

Used Kerrygold reserve sharp cheddar in the potatoes and added sliced mushrooms. This turned out wonderful! The sharp cheddar in the taters kept my mouth interested  and the filling and seasoning (surprisingly minimal) made for a great gravy! Everything had the right texture and made for delicious bite after bite after bite. Highly recommend if you are looking for a casserole. If tou are worried about using lamb, don't be! It's very close to beef and this would be the perfect introduction to using lamb. Enjoyed to the last bite.

This is a great recipe.
Made a few minor changes, ground beef for lack of available lamb and I also added some small stew meat for some meaty chunks.
I used all 7 oz. of the Dubliner cheese (cause I love cheese).

We will be having this again!

This Shepherd's pie is delicious this is the second time I made it , the first time it wasn't enough because everyone wanted seconds and it was gone in a flash, so this time I double the portions, my boys and husband kept asking for more. So delicious and such a different  flavor from the beef or the traditional mashed potatoes. Definitely it's a keeper. 
Thank you Chef John! 
I would make a note that this is a very rich dish, but since it's not our everyday dish, I think we can afford indulge ourselves with so many calories . :)

Used ground meat instead of lamb (my husband doesn't like lamb) and used a bit more milk that the recipe called for in the mashed potatoes as they were a bit dry for my liking but other than that it was fabulous!  My whole family loved it and they usually don't like this type of dish.

I've made this 3 times now and I can't get enough!  I add a bit more ketchup and seasonings than the recipe calls for but that's about it.  The last time I made this I completely forgot the egg and milk in the potatoes.  I realized my mistake after they were already spread over the beef, but it didn't take away from the flavor or overall outcome of this dish.  Once, I placed a few pats of butter on the top of the potatoes before baking and it turned out just as delicious!

Reduced it to 4 servings the changes where beef instead of lamb and added cumin and only a pinch of cinnamon, everything else was the same. The trick is to be well organized because of all the ingredients...... Came out great will make again.

I loved this! I did make a few changes though. I used ground beef and chicken broth. I used baby red potatoes.  I didn't have rosemary or irish cheese (nor any substitute) but it still turned out so nice! Loved the cream cheese in the mashed potatoes!!! So delicious!!!

I love this recipe. I was looking for a way to make shepherd's pie without condensed soup.  I used what I had on hand: onions, celery, carrots, peas, garlic, lean ground beef. I also used beef broth instead of water as another reviewer suggested. My seasonings were pepper, salt, fresh thyme and rosemary and a titch of kitchen bouquet. Sorry if this makes the chef twitch in horror!  I also used a gluten free flour blend. My mashed potatoes only had butter, whole milk and salt with some melted butter brushed on top. Both my husband and I had two helpings!

My son and I liked this recipe a lot and I suspect I will be making it a couple of times per year with tweaks here and there to keep things fresh and new.

My family has never had lamb, so I went 50/50 with ground sirloin to keep the mix a bit less unfamiliar tasting.  I followed the meat mixture recipe verbatim except I added a few extra ounces of veggies and cayenne to the mix.  After tasting it, I want to try adding a little Worcestershire and some tomato paste (or more ketchup) the next time I make this recipe.  The cinnamon was a nice touch, though.  If you try this recipe, I recommend cutting it back a bit it you are not adventurous, but do not exclude it (especially if you use lamb!).    

For the potato topping, I used some leftover mashed taters and added a Tbsp of milk, one egg yolk, and four ounces of 18-month aged cheddar (our local store was sold out of Irish cheese).   For texture, I also put some fried onions on top  and a dash of paprika for color.  I will try harder to find Irish cheese next time as I think the richer flavors would do this dish good.

Since this was only to serve two people, I cut the recipe in half and assembled the pies in four disposable mini loaf pans.  Each pan got eight ounces of filling and seven ounces of potato to cover.  I baked two and will freeze the others for future enjoyment...like maybe tomorrow!

Made it exactly to recipe and turned out amazing. Had a holiday party with a guest from Ireland and his compliments were spot on with a traditional Irish shepherds pie. Two other guests with stays in England loved it very much as well.

AMAZING recipe! Made this for the very first time and got RAVE reviews!!! Definitely going to make again! It took a lot of prep work and a long time to make but was definitely worth it.
Tips:
1. The recipe does not tell you when/where to add the milk - it goes into the mashed potatoes
2. It is quite greasy so definitely drain meat (A lot of grease developed on top of the potatoes, used paper towel to pat dry) 
3. Add garlic powder, extra thyme, extra salt and extra pepper to meat/gravy mixture for better flavor
4. Use 1lb ground lamb and 1lb ground beef and brown together in the same pan(be sure to drain!!) - this combo is still lamb flavorful just a touch less heartburn inducing
5. Use fresh carrots not frozen ones
6. Invite everyone over for dinner and HAVE FUN!!!
7. Goes great with Powers Irish Whiskey :)

I made this last night for dinner. I used hamburger instead of  lamb and it was a huge hit! Another little tweak I did was,  because I was out of cream cheese I actually put in Artichoke Spinach dip. It was amazing! My sister and her kids were over plus I have 2 sons (and my youngest son refuses to eat vegetables), at the end of the day there were NO leftovers! All 4 kids totally cleaned their plates!! I will make it many more times!

Delicious! I made it last night and it was a big hit! I did edit it a bit. Used ground beef instead. I boiled fresh chopped carrots and parsnips together with a bouillon cube, and used that water in the ground beef  (instead of using frozen peas and regular water). I think next time I would also add worchestshire sauce in the beef as well for more flavor

Big success and all enjoyed. 
I did make some changes. 1. It is very hard to find lean lamb, so I drained the meat (but not completely since some fat was needed. 2. I added more potatoes because we like them.  I also added more milk.  I'm not sure how the potatoes would have covered the pan otherwise.  3. I used a slightly deeper pan, since that's what I had.  I think the added depth was good.

My Family loved this.  I substituted 1 cup of mixed veggies instead of the carrots and peas.  I didn't have a great beer like Guiness around so I used what my husband had in the fridge, Samuel Adams Ocktoberfest.  I know it would have been even better with Guiness!

Hands down, the best recipe I have come across! My husband was born/raised in Ireland, his whole family still lives there. Going to visit annually, I have had several opportunities to try this dish. This tops them all! I usually do not change recipes the first time I try them, but due to the fact my kitchen was missing ground lamb I used  2 lbs of a boneless leg of lamb cut in bite-size pieces. Also missing was a bag of mixed frozen peas/carrots. So I used a half bag of frozen peas and used fresh chopped carrots and parsnips to make up the difference. I did not change any of the spices or herbs. I don't like to add more calories than necessary to any dish, so I opted to omit the 2 cheeses in the potato mixture. Even without the cheeses, this dish was the best! The flavors are delish!

This was very good, but came out too watery for me. I did use the full 2.5 cups water (not broth, which may be 1 reason why), so next time will cut that way down.

This is the best shepherds pie I have ever had! I followed the recipe to a tee with the exception of using ground beef in place of lamb. It was indescribably tasty! Everyone in my household couldn't get enough... Even my picky 19 month old!

There are two things I love : trying new recipes and lamb.  I would agree with many people that this recipe lacks one step, to drain off the fat after cooking the lamb.  But other than that this is a beautiful recipe.  In the end when I sat it down in front of me it had the aroma I knew but a taste that could only be described as heavenly.  I added the peas and carrots frozen and after the baking was done the vegetables were firm and crisp instead of mushy.  FANTASTIC!  Next time I'm substituting some beer for some of the water.

I used beef instead so I left out the cinnamon and rosemary and used the beef broth stuff with the base instead of water. And, I don't like veggies so I left those out too, but it was still awesome!

Chef John - you never let me down!  This was a huge hit at our house.  My only change was to use ground turkey instead of beef.  I've been looking for a recipe that didn't use canned soup as a base and this one was absolutely delicious.

Tried this for dinner.  My family loves Shepherd's Pie, but I never did.  But after I tried this recipe, I decided I like it too.  The grocery only had one pound of lamb so I had to sub in one pound of beef, but cost wise I probably would have done it that way anyway.  The cheese in the potatoes is die for.  My kids told me I should add the Irish cheese to my normal smashed potatoes from now on.  I'll admit I did add a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the meat, but I don't think it needed it.  Cannot wait to make this again.  Thank you for sharing Chef John.

love the recipe, but, it's too much for just 2 people{or at least these 2 people]. I cut the mix for 2 servings and I have question. how do you get 1/4 egg yolk?

Ground lamb is typically pretty fatty, so I substituted half with ground turkey and drained the grease before adding the flour.  Also I don't tolerate dairy, so instead of cheese added 2 yolks and one egg to the mashed potatoes, I didn't bother peeling them either.

Just sort of made this recipe. I couldn't follow the directions exactly simply because we have a dairy allergy and an onion allergy. So I skipped the butter and onion in the stew. Then because mashed potatoes just aren't the same without butter and milk/cream and we cannot use the cheese I chose to dice the potatoes and add them to the stew. For some more color I also added in some sliced carrots. So basically lamb stew.

Love it! I used hamburger and drained some of the fat before adding flour, etc.   The cinnamon and rosemary is just fantastic.  My bf is a chef that of course, never cooks at home and he loved it too!

I used beef and left out the spices and seasonings I think were meant to go with lamb. I also just topped with mashed potatoes. Delish.

I cooked two cups of lentils and used them instead of lamb and it's wonderful. I used coarse mustard instead of ketchup and plain Greek yogurt instead of sugar. Delicious and meat eaters were just as pleased.

I made one minor change to this recipe: I used 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground lamb because Wegman's only had one pkg of ground lamb left. Everything else is exactly according to the recipe. My husband loved it! I thought it was delicious too. I didn't use Dubliner's cheese but I did use another Irish Cheddar. Next time I hope to make it with all lamb. Also next time I'd cut down on the liquid because mine didn't thicken as much as I would've liked.

I made the following changes:  I halved the recipe substituting ground beef for lamb, thyme for rosemary, mixed vegetables for peas and carrots, and I used half each mashed potato and cauliflower for the topping.  I soaked up the excess fat with paper towels before adding the flour, then fooled the directions as listed. This dish was absolutely delicious!

Simple to make but a lot of steps. I used 1/2 lamb and 1/2 hamburger (93%) and used beef broth in place of water. Dubliner cheese is ideal and melts nicely.

I actually used turkey burger with beef bouillon.   It was very good.  Since I made this on St. Patrick's Day, I added green food coloring to the whipped potatoes.  It was a hit!!

This recipe took a bit of prep work, but it was well worth it according to my DH. I was planning on using cheddar cheese in the potatoes, but surprisingly I found the Dubliner Cheese at Trader Joe's. I wanted to keep the recipe as close as possible to what was submitted. I did use ground beef and skipped the cayenne pepper. Other than that I made it as listed. This is going into my recipe file and will be my go to recipe for Shepherd's Pie from now on.

The best recipe I've found for shepherd's pie. I found that lamb and cinnamon are naturals together, so thanks to this recipe, I now use cinnamon with lamb in many other dishes.

I've had ground lamb in the freezer for months and was searching for something to do with it.  This recipe was perfect. The flavors blended so well and complemented one another flawlessly.  Definitely on the "must make again" list.

I tweaked it a little.  I don't eat lamb.  I usually just use whatever I have in the kitchen and don't worry about particular types of cheese or veggies, etc.  Regardless, this is a good recipe and I will make it again.  Thanks for posting it!

I watched the video first and then made the dish for New Year's Eve Day.  Everyone LOVED it! I used ground venison instead of beef or lamb and it tasted fabulous.  Loved the Irish Cheddar in the potatoes.  Thanks Chef John, this is a keeper!!!!

This recipe was delicious! The only thing I changed was that I didn't add the Irish cheese to the potatoes since I didn't have any on hand and used extra cream cheese. I also added quite a bit more garlic as we are a garlic loving family! Used fresh carrots that I par boiled ahead of time and only used 1 lb of lamb as that is all we had on hand, so upped the amount of peas and potatoes. This was so yummy I will have to make this frequently.

Made this with grass-fed ground beef since I had a couple pounds I needed to use and didn't want to do my usual with it. Works very well with beef, but it does require a little tweaking to makeup for the loss of flavor when using ground lamb. The hardest part was getting my wife to not eat the delicious potato mixture before I added it to the meat!

I've made this several times for family and friends and each time it is a hit.  I have served it to those that are less than excited about lamb and they have commented that it tastes much better than they expected it would. I would guard against using all of the mashed potatoes as they can easily overpower the good stuff underneath.

We loved this dish! We felt the veal was a little strong of a flavor for us so might will try half veal and half ground beef next time, but will definitely be making it again.

I always hated making Shepherds Pie, it was so boring:( But John's recipe was just what I needed to create a new version of Shepherds Pie:) I love this recipe. I changed his recipe just a bit to my husbands liking.( Who is Irish) Instead of peas & carrots I used green beans & mushrooms. I also added French fried  onions on top of the potatoes. I hope my husband  and I will enjoy this recipe:)

This was just amazing!  I altered it by adding 2 TBSP of Worcestershire sauce and used Guinness instead of water.  Best ever!

Wonderful! I made this for a large group of guests and they all loved it! Only changes I made was to use ground beef instead of lamb, and I also used a little more flour. FRESH rosemary makes all the difference. Thank you for the recipe! I'll definitely be making this again.

I enjoyed the use of lamb, however felt that the dish was a bit rich tasting with the added cheese. The ketchup and cinnamon added an interesting, almost strange flavor. I, stupidly, failed to drain the fat from the meat before making the dish, so I ended up with an extremely greasy product. The dish, overall, was good. I would make it again, but I would probably leave out the cheese, ketchup, cinnamon, and of course, drain the meat.

We're trying to save calories, so I used reduced fat cheddar and cream cheese and it still came out yum. I upped the veg amount, adding leeks, celery, and fresh carrots. A fellow reviewer suggested curry powder; it pairs well and adds a depth to lamb dishes. I froze half the amount for a future enjoyable dinner!

Very good! I felt like being adventurous and making this for company. They all raved about it.  The only thing I would add is more salt.

Made this for an Irish-themed dinner and the only problem was that I underestimated its popularity!  It was GONE; should've made more.  Changes I made: Because the hosts do not eat lamb, I subbed ground turkey.  I drained the fat before adding the flour.  I added all spices as directed, and used Irish Cheddar in the potatoes.  It was delicious!  Almost all of the 15-20 kids at the dinner wolfed it down, which makes it a success in my book.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is amazingly delicious! I have had and made many versions of Shepherd's Pie through the years, but never used Lamb. Even my Son who claims to not like the taste of Lamb loved it. I let him think it was beef as he assumed, and he asked what wonderful spices I added :-) I am adding this recipe along to my daughter, my Mom, and other friends and family.

This was very good I also made it with beef (cowboy pie) like many others because I had no lamb in the freezer. I should have cut the recipe half for just two of us. Lunch for the week!

Very good.  Had to use beef instead of lamb though so used beef stock instead of just water.  Probably will use just 2 cups instead of 2 1/2 next time.  And there will be a next time!

I used 1 lb of lamb and 2 lbs. of lean ground. I also used Chianti to reduce the lamb flavor a bit. Couldn't find the Dubliner cheese so I used sharp chedder in the potatoes and Asiago cheese on the top. Very delicious

This was the best Sheppard pie I ever made and also the first time I cooked with lamb. I loved it so did the rest of my guests. Way better then hamburger witch I have used many times in similar recipes for Sheppards Pie. From now on I will be making Sheppards Pie the right way, with LOCALLY sourced Lamb.

Timing says fifteen minutes, it took me over an hour, and that, I expected. Definitely drain off the fat, or this will be swimming in grease. Wasn't sure about the cayenne and what was recommended, I used a heavy dash, it was enough. I also found it did not brown up like the video, so I had to use a gravy browning product. Tasted great in the end, but start to finish, it was close to three hours. I'll start earlier net time!!

This made a great shepherds pie, highly recommend this recipe.  Only thing missing was in the ingredients, there was no mention to the cayenne pepper, I used 1.8 tablespoon.

Made a hit! Tasted great. The lamb mixture did not thicken as it had in the video. Added more flour and it still didn't thicken as it should. Would love suggestions for next year on St.Patty's Day.

I am not a big fan of Shepherds Pie but decided to make this for St. Patricks day.  Wow!  What a surprise; nothing bland about this dish!  There is a wonderful blend of flavors.  My whole family loved it.
