Unusual sauce.  Must like peppers, no doubt!  I would serve initially as a side dish. Would be good with grilled marinaded firm tofu slices.    

If the household chef has a gas range, the peppers can be blistered over a flame.

This was a great new twist on basic pesto! I did change a few things; we used walnuts instead of pumpkin seeds and roasted the tomatoes with a little olive oil, sea salt and pepper. I served this with a piece of toast and goat cheese. We have plenty of pesto left over and I will probably use it on homemade pizza's this week.
