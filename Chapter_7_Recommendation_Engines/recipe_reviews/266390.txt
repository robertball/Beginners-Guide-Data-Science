Excellent! The cucumber adds a refreshing twist to traditional caprese salad. Perfect on a hot summer day. Everyone enjoyed it and I'll be making it again.

Cut the slices of mozzarella and the tomatoes in half, width-wise.  That way, youâ€™re not left with a mouthful of cheese and the cukes come out a bit, which is a good thing.
