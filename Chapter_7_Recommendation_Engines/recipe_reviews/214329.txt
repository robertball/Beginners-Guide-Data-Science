This is a top of the line dessert.  I don't usually eat desserts, but this I had to use restraint!

The ingredients don't match up with those on the directions page (called for pistachios instead of the proper pistachio pudding).  It would be great to have that corrected.  

I made it correctly however and it was a huge hit.  I liked the leftovers even better straight out of the freezer.

I liked this very much! It should have been simple, had I followed the recipe to a T, however I halved the recipe to make an 8x8 pan size and had some trouble when putting the first layer of pudding onto the base. It was very thick and the base crumbs kept sticking and mixing in as I tried to spread it...perhaps because I was in a hurry and didn't put the base into the fridge before this step. All in all it was very good. I would highly recommend you chill the base crumb crust WELL before trying to spread the first layer however.
