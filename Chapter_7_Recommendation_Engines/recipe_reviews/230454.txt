I made these to take to a Christmas dinner we were invited to. I love potato rolls and these didn't disappoint. They were easy to make and were very soft, fluffy & moist. I recommend oiling your fingers when you start to shape the rolls, as the dough can be a bit sticky. I did use butter in place of the shortening. I put them into cake pans--a dozen in one pan, and a bakers dozen in the other pan. Everyone raved about the rolls, so this one is a keeper!

These make very nice rolls - rave reviews at the party I took them too. Half of them I rolled into balls and put in a 9-inch round pan. The other half I rolled out, cut into circles and then folded in half (these made for great sandwich rolls!). I followed the recipe except that I substituted some of the white flour with whole wheat flour.

These rolls are amazing! Soft and fluffy. The perfect dinner roll. If they aren't fluffy, you have used too much flour. The dough should be a little sticky. I have found my new favorite roll recipe.

These rolls are great!  I made them as the recipe was written for family Easter dinner and everybody raved about them, none left over!  So light and fluffy, and such a great taste they didn't need to be buttered.  This has definitely become my go-to roll recipe.

I made this for the first time tonight and my family devoured it!  The rolls came out very light, tender and fluffy!  I made some changes: to dissolve the yeast, I added 1/2 teaspoon of raw honey to 1/4 cup warm water from the water that I used to boil the potatoes.  I also substituted butter for the shortening.  I really like this recipe and I will continue to make it again since my son loves the rolls very much!

Made these after Easter having had leftover mashed potatoes. The only thing I changed was butter instead of the shortening. Doubled the recipe, but these were devoured very quickly nonetheless. Our new favourite roll.

Delicious.  The only change I made was to use the potato water to soften the yeast ...because that is the way my sister always did it!

These are the softest and yummiest dinner rolls you can make. 
I do use Irish butter and raw sugar. I also use my left over mashed potatoes and it is great!  I always try to make extra mashed potatoes and put them in the freezer just for these rolls.

I used purples sweet potatoes instead of potatoes, and reduced the amount of sugar, used coconut oil. I put more flour during the kneading process.  Finished by blushing butter on top with black seamen seeds.  The buns are smelling great and soft, and in light pink/purple colour! looking great!

I just made this, and yes, they turned out really yummy, tho I wish I'd made them bigger for sandwiches. As is, we had them fresh out of the oven as slider buns. I found, like some other reviewers, that they didn't rise as much as many other yeast bread/roll recipes I've made. Perhaps that had a little to do with how cool and dry it is here, but it is to be noted. However, they are definitely worth a try (especially for a holiday meal, these would be perfect). I'm glad I saved half the dough for rolls later. I'll have to see if it rises after being in the fridge for a day, but it's worth a shot to have fresh bread. If it doesn't work, lesson learned.

Delicious! So light & airy! I mixed them in the bread machine - used instant mashed potatoes & coconut oil instead of shortening. The dough was so wet that I added about 1/4c more flour while it was mixing, so it would knead properly by slapping all the sides of the bread pan. I took it out 15 minutes early, as it was rising over the edge of the pan. I made 20 large rolls, sprayed them with butter Pam & baked as directed in the toaster oven, covering with foil when they started getting too browned. I will make these often - they will be great as a dinner roll or for sandwiches. Thanks for posting, Derrick!

I beat egg white in a small bowl with just a little pinch of salt. Then, after the individual dough balls rose, I brushed the tops with egg white gently, about 5 mins before putting into oven. Gives them a nice sheen ;)

My mother always made these beautiful potato rolls as big as your head for Thanksgiving.  They were rich and flavorful but also light and fluffy. Since she passed away years ago I have been trying to find the right recipe to reproduce them.  This is it!  They are just perfect!  Not to complicated and comes out beautifully in just a couple hours time. I baked them to light golden color a couple days ahead and then will brown them up a bit on Thanksgiving.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I have been baking breads for over 40 years now and I love this recipe.  I make it exactly as written and they turn out perfect every time.  It is the texture that grabbed my attention.  They are so soft and flavorful.  I use them for dinner rolls and I also make some bigger for breakfast sandwiches.  They freeze well.

You must try these, they are light and melt in your mouth delicious!  We have made several bread and bun recipes and these are our favourite rolls.  I do all my bread doughs in the breadmeaker, as I do these with success every time.  Makes them so easy.  I have subbed the vegetable shortening our on occasion for butter or vegetable oil.  Still makes a beautiful roll.  You can't go wrong with these.  Challenge your best bun recipe with these!

These were great. Made them for dinner when my daughter came with her boyfriend and between them and my husband they ate almost 1/2 off the batch. Will definitely make again. Softest rolls I have ever made.

Great recipe. Made rolls many times just as is.  I started bumping up the sugar  from 1/4 to 1/3 cup. And on this last batch I tried 1/2 cup. Tastes about as sweet as Hawaiian rolls from the store. Will be using 1/2cup of sugar from now on

Made the recipe exactly ad written. They were light, fluffy and so delicious! 
I will use less sugar next time as the crust was a bit sweet for my husband's taste.

I used about 1/2 tsp. of sugar to help proof the yeast.  and only the 2 cups of flour in the dough.  Only extra flour used to help form the rolls.  The rolls were delicious!

I love this recipe! I often add more potato (1cup or more) sometimes sweet potatoes or butternut squash with amazing results.

These came out so soft and delicious! I somehow ended up using nearly a cup less flour than the recipe called for, the dough had already formed well enough before I could add the rest of the flour. I'll be using them as buns for sliders too, should work out great!

I'm responsible for making the rolls for family gatherings now! The only thing I stay from the recipe is using almond milk instead of regular and I will add more potato. They are so delicious. We usually butter and sprinkle with kosher salt when they just come out of the oven.

Amazing! It was my first yeast-bread dish and it came out perfectly. Fresh out of the oven, warm, soft and delicious. Loved the texture too. I haven't tasted anything like this from bakeries. Thank you for this amazing recipe!

Great recipe! I replaced one cup of white flour with whole wheat, and it was plenty. I also made my own buttermilk with milk and vinegar. My dough also didn't seem to rise much initially, but as they cooked they rose, and turned out great. My son only eats potato bread and he liked these. Very happy with this recipe.

These rolls are addictive! Just the perfect dinner roll. I used my bread machine set on dough and I did use bread flour. There are only two of us so I froze half after baking and those were every bit as good. Thanks for the great recipe.

These are great and very simple.  I have made them with sweet potatoes and subbing 1 cup wheat flour for the white.   They are tender with a nice crumb,  but hold up well as sandwich or even burger buns.

I did make these in my breadmaker and had to add about 1/4c of flour.  This recipe is a keeper.  I formed them into hamburger size buns and had to freeze a few.  Took them out of the freezer 2 months later and still were terrific.

These rolls are amazing!!! So many dinner rolls taste great the day you make them, but seem dry the next day. These rolls are so soft and light, and taste just as amazing the next day (if you have any left).

Yummy! Although I accidentally put around 2 cups of mashed potatoes. They ended up turning out great, just a bit heavy. I omitted the egg, and used unsalted butter instead of shortening.

So easy. Before I made these I asked everyone I know if they had heard of them. Nobody had so I decided I had to try making them. Glad I did! Completely fool proof recipe. Cut the recipe in half but other than that didn't change anything. They rose beautifully and were so moist. Definitely will be making these lots more in the future.

I have used this a few times making changes depending on what ingredients I have or don't have and it's a very forgiving recipe for sure! The last time was today and I used canola oil instead of shortening and had some left over mashed potatoes that were made from potato flakes and the only sugar that I had was about 1/4 cup of brown sugar so that is what I used. Came out great!

I let these rise in my oven while using the "proof" feature and they were just so fluffy! Taste was great. Made these under a time crunch once, let them rise half the time both rounds, and they were still pretty good. Not quite as fluffy but still totally edible.

I have tried a lot of dinner roll recipes and this recipe is by far the best. The rolls were moist and the perfect density. They were so good we didn't even need butter.
