I was impressed and thought this was very good!!! My husband however, thought it was too sweet. So next time, I'll omit the brown sugar and reduce the amount of chili sauce by half, replacing the rest with tomato sauce. A little tip for those that those that had a problem with the rice taking longer to cook or that it wasn't finished, it could be from stirring it around too often while the rice is cooking. I did not lift the lid from the pan while it simmered to prevent the steam from escaping (which is what cooks the rice) and it came out perfectly. Also, there's no sense in browing the meat and transferring it to another pot. Just start off browning the meat in a large pot and adding all of the other ingredients as directed.

This has become a staple in our home, we have it every 2-3 weeks.  I typically try and use brown rice because it's healthier and sometimes use the Asian style chili sauce for its sweetness (to suit the kids' taste).  We love this, thank you!  **updated comments: why dirty 3 pans?  Make it in a dutch oven or similar cast iron pan, brown the meat in it, throw all the other ingredients in, let it cook and then throw the whole thing in the oven.  1 dish to wash!**

I made this rice last night and being from Costa Rica, (where we eat rice with just about every meal) the reason why people are experiencing some difficulties with cooking the rice is because the recipe calls for medium low heat, and the only way you can get the rice to cook all the way is by cooking it in just LOW heat. Cooked mine in low heat for about 40 mins added 1.5 cups of medium salsa instead of the water, and a can of corn and once I placed all the ingredients in the casserole dish before baking it I put a layer of refried beans and sprinkle the cheese. I also added some taco seasoning, cumin, and some fresh garlic when I cooked the meat, since i find that the meat picks up all the flavors when you brown it (I will never brown any meat without spices, is like showering without soap!)

Delish and easy!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used salsa instead of chili sauce.   To make it simpler (with less clean-up), I cooked everything in one pot and served it right out of the pot.  Instead of baking it with cheese on top, I garnished each serving with a dollop of fat free sour cream.  This recipe is a keeper!  By the way, don't touch the rice while it's cooking.  Just put the lid on the pot and simmer for 25 - 30 minutes or else it will get gluey.

This is so delicious! I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes which worked really well, with the smaller can it was a bit too dry. I used chili powder instead of chili sauce. I have made this recipe at least 5 times and it's always great.

I will definitely make this again, but I have a few comments. It is sweet, but that's okay. My rice wasn't done after 30 mins., so I had to add 1/4 cup of water and 10 more mins. of cooking. I'll add more water at the beginning next time. I agree that this is even better the second day; it's a great "make ahead" dish.

Spanish Rice Bake Haiku: "Yawn, this was boring. I would add alot of stuff. If I made again." I should've known, with all the thumbs-up reviews saying, "I added 'x' seasoning" or "I included 'y' spice" that maybe I should've done so too. I made the recipe as written, only using a homemade salsa instead of chile sauce. I just found it extremely blah-tasting, and ending up rolling mine into a tortilla w/ additional salsa, cilantro, avocado, and other chopped veggies. The other thing that perplexed me was the dirtying of 3 dishes, when realistically, it could all be prepared in one large pot, and one could even skip baking it, and just let the cheese melt on top right on the stovetop, conserving energy (and possible calories, by using cheese to one's garnishing preference.) If I were to make this again, I would brown the beef in taco seasoning, ditch the brown sugar, and add minced garlic, more cumin, and maybe some frozen corn or black beans for added filling fiber.

This is a wonderful dish.  It can be served as a side to any meat.  Just a trick regarding the rice, a rice expert once told me that if you rinse your rice in cold water at least three times, then let it sit in cold water for about 1 hour, the rice will not stick.  It also will cook better because it absorbs some of the water and puffs out.  It works, my rice is separate and cooks easily every time, even with the cheapest rice.

I feel a little unfair rating this since i change so much, but here it is. I use ground turkey, onions, jalapenos, orange bell pepper, canned black beans(drained and rinsed), canned corn(drained), mexican tomatoes, and (hot) salsa in place of chile sauce. I add more cumin, paprika, oregano, and some chile powder. I leave out the brown sugar and worcestershire sauce (although i used w. sauce the first time i made it and it was fine). I cook it as stated in a cast iron dutch oven on the stovetop and simmer for 30 min. DO NOT lift lid before 30 minutes so rice can cook, and make sure it is on a low setting or bottom will burn. I then take off heat, stir, and top with mexican cheese blend (or sharp cheddar). Pop it in the oven until bubbly and add cilantro. My husband usually puts sriracha on top too, but he puts it on everything. So in the end this spanish rice turns into mexican rice, but this recipe was the inspiration and basis for my delicious additions. Thanks, we make this pretty often.

The aromas filled my entire home while I made this dish and the whole time the kids were begging for it to be done. Even my husband who tends to not like dishes like this really enjoyed it and told me to keep this recipe. I didn't change much at all. I added about twice as much sugar, cilantro and cheese. I also added a bit of chopped green onion to the top. More importantly, I never lifted the lid once while it was simmering on the stove for 30 minutes, it made the rice just perfect! ***Next time though I am going to do all the steps in my large skillet to save clean up time. There is no reason to use 3 separate dishes, it makes a bigger mess than necessary.

I used instant rice to cut down simmer time (10 min) and Thai Srirachi chili sauce for heat, and added a dash of cinnamon for a more Spanish-y flavor. Super yummy!

With the changes I made based on other reviews this was a 5 star recipe.  I made the recipe in one pot then transferred to casserole dish.  I omitted the sugar and substituted salsa for the chile sauce.  I also added in some corn, blackbeans, garlic, and taco seasoning.  Baked at 350 for about 20 minutes.

YUM!  Good one Melodie!  I added kidney beans and a couple of cloves of garlic.  I agree with another reviewer about the cilantro - use the freshest you can get.  Leftovers are wonderful (if you have any) as the flavors meld together.  I'll definitely make this again and again!

I made some changes to enchanced the favor. I used diced tomatoes instead of whole, added 1 cup of tomatoe juice, cut the cumin to 1/4 tsp and added 1/4 tsp of chili powder. To make it even better, I sauted the onions and peppers in 1 tbsp of bacon dippings and added 1 can (14oz) of dark kidney beans. Wow! Now the family liked it.

Awesome recipe exactly as written with the following direction clarification: at #2, bring all of the ingredients to a boil and COVER; reduce heat to simmer for 30 minutes WITHOUT stirring. We loved the flavor!!! Cooked the whole thing in a 10 inch cast iron skillet with high sides...only one pot to clean. It's a keeper recipe!

Very tasty BUT...the rice just won't cook all the way so...instant rice works great and cuts the time down to half. I cut out the green pepper and the brown sugar. I used a can of Rotelle instead of chili sauce and instead of plain water I used 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth. 
I'll be making this again! Instant rice is the winner here though.

Very good!  I changed it around a bit, but a great starting point! Cook 1 cup basmati rice in a separate pan, ground 1 lb ground beef with 1/2 onion and 1 green pepper, season with salt and pepper, drain fat, add 28 oz can diced tomatoes, 1 drained can black beans, 1/2 cup salsa, 1 sm can green chiles, to taste: salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, worchestershire sauce, mix in rice, sprinkle top with cheese, put in 375 oven until cheese melts, remove from oven and sprinkle top with fresh cilantro.

Excellent!  Very filling.  I did not have chili sauce but I did have a can of chili beans which I added without draining.  My husband loved it!
Update: I always use chili beans in it...just love it with beans!

Good!  Great way to use leftover rice.  I cooked the onion, green pepper & hamburger; drained and then mixed everything together and put into a 2 Qt. rectangular baking dish; topped with cheese and sprinkled cilantro (didn't have fresh) and put in refrigerator until near dinnertime then baked in oven for 30 minutes.

Delicious and easy recipe when you don't have a whole lot of energy. I added more spice than was called for, as I am a fan of cumin. I also had a problem with the rice not being done after 30 min, so I would go ahead and add 1/4-1/3 cup extra water and at least 10 more minutes to the cooking time on the stove. Other than that, it is really good.

This recipe tasted good, but the prep was misleading.  It was easy to throw together, but took WAY longer to cook - our rice was still a little crunchy an hr later in the oven..I also had to add an extra cup of water.  If I make this again, I'll just pre-cook the rice like regular, and add the flavourings.

I wish there was 4.5.  I've made this twice now and use instant rice instead, which works out fine (leave out water and brown sugar) and instead of chili sauce I add tomato sauce with green chiles since chili sauce isn't vegetarian.  I use the veggie beef crumblers but the rest is as written.  I will add corn next time and green onions instead of cilantro, just because we love green onions.  We eat this as our main dish and I make sweet corn bread to go with it from this site that's fantastic!  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/golden-sweet-cornbread/
Thanks for the great recipe!

The rice was still very crunchy even after nearly doubling the cook time and adding more water.  It seems based on some other reviews that this should have been simmered with a cover on. If that is indeed the case, that is something that definitely should have been mentioned in the recipe.  I finally threw the whole thing into the oven thinking perhaps the rice finishes cooking in the final step.  No such luck.  Too bad too because I gave it a taste and the flavor was good.

This has become a staple at our house.  The only change I've made is to add a bit more water.  Also, don't bother with putting it into a casserole dish -- take the lid off, add the cheese, and turn the heat off. Let the cheese melt, then serve it right from the skillet.  One less dish to wash!

A good but not great recipe as is.  I used enchilada sauce, increased cumin, and added garlic for more zip.  I also browned the ground beef with with vegetables.  Using quick-cooking rice cuts down on cooking time.  My kids liked it over crushed tortilla chips with a bit of salsa or taco sauce.  They weren't thrilled about cilantro.  I'll reuse this recipe with my modifications.

I thought this recipe might be a bit on the sweet side, so I added some chili powder and garlic powder to try to make it more savory.  It didn't work.  This actually reminded me more of a sloppy joe recipe I use that's on this site.  If I made this again, I'd probably eliminate the chile sauce, brown sugar and Worcestershire, and add more chili powder and garlic powder.  I didn't have any fresh cilantro on hand, so I added some dried cilantro to the ingredients before it simmered.  Without the addition of the chili powder, there really would have been no spiciness at all to this recipe.

Excellent recipe, easy to make, and the whole family loved it.   To dress it up a little, mix up a box of cornbread mix according to directions (Jiffy is fine), and spread on top before adding the Cheddar cheese.  Bake for about 20 minutes, or until cornbread is done (timing depends on size of casserole dish).  Sprinkle with cheese, then bake for antoehr minute or two to melt the cheese.

Great Recipe! I followed the recipe, except that I used salsa for the chile sauce (homemade salsa), and used 2 cans of rotel for the canned tomatoes. I chopped up cilantro and added it to the meat and rice mixture while it was simmering, and used a cheddar/pepper Jack cheese for the topping. I garnished it with cilantro, and served it on a fried corn tortilla! Check out the picture I posted for this recipe! It is definately a 5 star recipe, and I will be making it again, and again! Thank you!

Interesting recipe and easy to prepare, making it an ideal weeknight meal.  The only drawback was the texture of the rice.  The cooking time didn't allow for the rice to fully cook, so it was a bit cruchy (under done).  I would make this again.

It was good. I made some changes as per other reviews. I sprinkled some taco seasoning mix onto the ground beef, used salsa instead of the chili sauce and omitted the brown sugar. I cooked it all in one pan and sprinkled the cheese on top. Very good!

As ther reviewers suggested, I added all the ingredients into one pot, but I made sure to sautee meat first, then add onions, and then, the rest and made sure to cook them before added the rest. The only thing I did differently as far as ingredients go, is that I omitted the sugar. Not necessary AT ALL! Came out so delicious! The only thing is that my rice burned at the bottom, even though I only cooked it on the stovetop covered for 15 minutes. I would suggest stirring well and making sure there's enough water to avoid sticking and burning. After rice was cooked, I sprinkled the top with the cheese, and put the whole thing (oven safe pot!) in the oven. Fabulous easy recipe, we all loved it, thanks for sharing!!

This was very tasty. I wasn't sure how it would turn out because it looked really runny at first, but once the rice cooked a lot of the moisture was absorbed.   My husband hates rice, and he even didn't mind this dish. (I put sour cream on the table for him to mask the rice.) I also added green onion to the top (after adding the cheese) before cooking in the oven. This also added a nice flavour.   I will definitely make this again! Although my husband only found this "ok," that is definitely saying something since he absolutely hates rice dishes!

This recipe was a HUGE hit at the office.  There is no need to use two pans--brown the hamburger a small stock pot or a dutch oven (the name of the bigger pots with two handles).  Then add all the ingredients to that pot.  Works very well made the night before.  After pressing it into the pan, refridgerate it and cook it (a little longer, of course) the next day after the cheese is sprinkled on top. Keep a good eye on this.  I put the lid on the pot and simmered it like I would rice in water (on very low for 30 min) and it was a little over cooked.  All in all a VERY good recipe.  Next time I'll add more green pepper.

this is wonderful! I added some jalepeno peppers, black beans, and instead of using regular rice..I used jasmine.  This turned out really great and it is very versitile as I also used it for a filler for burritos.  My family says: keep the recipes coming.  Thanks

I used cooked chicken instead of ground beef, since I'm not fond of the texture that the ground beef has. It turned out GREAT!!! and was given two thumbs up by family. This recipe is in the must repeat file.

My mother's recipe was somewhat similar, but no baking involved.  It was a quick meal that we loved.  She boiled her rice in chicken stock and chopped green onions(scallions). (salt chicken stock to your taste).  When rice is cooked, add 1 - 2 cans of seasoned stewed tomatoes (more flavor), salt/pepper to taste,  1 cup of Kraft Cheez Whiz or to your taste.  Heat through, taste test and add more cheese or stewed tomatoes.  This can also be doctored up with your favorite flavours, salsa, etc.  She served this with beef sausages, cooked and fat drained off, and fresh crusty rolls.  It was yummy.

This was delicious!  So very close to the spanish rice my Mom used to make.  I think a bit more water and maybe 5 more minutes of simmering as the rice needed a tad more cooking.  I also added a tsp of hot sauce for zing.  I would highly recommend the chile sauce instead of salsa.  A dab of sour cream on top sets it off.  I found no reason to change anything other that what I listed as the recipe is wonderful and a keeper.

I would give this 4 stars as is.  But with the changes I made, the whole family scarffed this down. I used 1/2 of a green pepper instead of measuring 1/4 cup. I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes (instead of the smaller can of diced),and skipped the chili sauce entirely. I added a 6oz can of tomato paste mixed w/ the 1 cup of water. I incresed the rice to 1 full cup. The brown sugar was also increased to 1 tbsp. After this simmered on my stove for almost forty minutes, I placed it in a baking dish and topped it with 8 oz of shredded sharp cheddar, and baked for 20 minutes.

This is a great, family friendly dinner. I made a few changes, though, since I didn't have all the ingredients. Instead of canned tomatoes and chile sauce, I added tomato sauce and taco seasoning. It was still very, very good...and a little more appealing to my son this way. :)

Not my typical spanish rice but it was good. I sauteed the onion and green pepper with the beef and then added everything else. I used chunky style chili style and it gave it a nice sweet taste. Didn't see the need to pop in the oven so did it all on top of the stove.

I left out the additional salt since the canned tomatoes and the salsa I used instead of chili sauce have plenty of salt. I also added about a tsp. of chipotle hot sauce and used monterey jack instead of cheddar. All three of us loved this and it was very easy, even though it created a lot of dishes. On making this again, I found a way to lessen the dishes used-- cook and simmer everything in a deeper oven proof skillet. After your rice is done cooking, just top with cheese and put it directly in the oven. Using leftover enchilada sauce also works in place of the chili sauce.

This dish is so good!  I subsituted the chilie sauce with enchilada sauce because it's what i had on hand.  It was nice and spicey.  I made this to go with our taco dinner and ended up eating just the rice, served with a little sour cream.  Made good leftovers too.

Very easy and delicious. I didn't have chili sauce so I used 1c of  mild salsa & 1/2c of water. I also added cumen, chili powder & garlic powder to my hamburger when browning. I added a can of mexi-corn to the mixture and cooked it entirely on stove top because I didn't want to start oven & heat up my kitchen.

This turned out delish!  Added a rinsed/drained can of black beans and used INSTANT rice - cooked on the stovetop for 10 minutes and then in the oven for 15 minutes - turned out great.  Family loved it - will make again!

I couldn't wait to make this recipe from the second I saw it.  It was really good.  Next time I'll omit a little chili sauce and replace with Catsup (prefer taste).  I accidentally added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar...a little too sweet that way.  I also mixed in the cilantro and that tasted a little too strong.  Despite all that, I enjoyed every bite.

I've been making this dish for a few years now, and I must say its probably my favorite dish!  Here's what I learned: first-- omit the fresh veggies and chile sauce and tomatoes. Use a 1lb 8 oz can of salsa instead, you wont know the difference and it's a lot easier.Also, bring to a boil and then simmer.  Finally, melt the cheese on top instead of transferring to a casserole.  It comes out the same way but less dishes for you!

Although I love the flavors of this dish alone, for me it got better when I wrapped it all up and made burritos with it. Some salsa on top and these were seriously good! I will definitely be making this again!

This was so good!! The only minor changes I made were to use 1/4 cup chili sauce with 1/4 cup tomato sauce in place of the 1/2 cup of chili sauce, and I reduced the brown sugar from 1 tsp. to about a half tsp. Also, instead of using several different pans, I made the whole thing in my stainless steel deep saute pan, then simply scattered the cheese on top & covered the hot pan until the cheese melted. No need to use the oven at all! Will make this again and again!

Supper yummy!!! I had no problem at the dinner table with the kids not wanting to eat this dish. They gobbled it up! My husband talked about it for days, he thought it was so good. I did add corn because that is my husbands favorite vegetable, and I love adding extra veggies to all my dishes I prepare. This one has definitely entered into our rotation of dinners.

This was delicious!  I took reviewers advice and used salsa instead of chile sauce and did not add the brown sugar (although I think I could have without bad effect)  because people mentioned the rice not cooking well, I was cautious with removing the lid to stir and ended up burning the bottom a little bit, so keep it covered, but do stir!

This was very good and easy.  I followed others suggestion with cooking the rice (don't lift the lid during the 30 min except to stir maybe one or two times--and I did that quickly!)I also had run out of brown sugar so I put in about a tsp of maple syrup (have done that substitution before) and it had just the right amount of sweet taste.  I'll make this again..

I am going to give it a 5, because I am sure it would have been.  But I couldnt help but to add things, and while it was still yummy, probably wasnt Spanish Rice any longer :-)  But this was such a good starting point, I just couldnt resist.  I added corn, chili beans, black olives, smoked paprika, curry powder, and I pretty much tripled everything in the recipe - double to triple.  I did not have chile sauce nor cheese, so I just cooked it on the stove.  I did have a smidgen of sun-dried tomato Alfredo that I added. Everyone really liked it, even the little guys.

Very good!  I had left over taco meat so I used that with great results.  I added more green pepper and used cooked quinoa instead of rice (no rice on hand).  I also used salsa instead of chili sauce.  This recipe is versatile and can easily be adjusted to suit a family's tastes.

My family liked this dish.  Only minor changes I made were to use red bell pepper and a can of tomatoes with green chilis instead of plain.  I also did not have fresh cilantro which would have made it way better but did sprinkle in some dry cilantro for the flavor.  As others said do not lift the lid while the rice is cooking on the stove and use a large skillet that can do all three instead of dirtying 3 dishes.

A great time saver is a big sautee pan, I have a 5qt caphalon sautee/sauce pan that's oven safe...this made it so easy, sautee the hamburg, add the onion & peppers, then tomatoes and the rest of the ingredients!  The tip is to bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to about a simmer, cover and cook for about 25 minutes.  The KEY, don't uncover and stir!  The steam gets trapped in and helps the rice cook!  When the time is up, uncover stir, sprinkle with cheese, and toss the whole pan in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes (just to melt all the cheese).  Serve with the sour cream!  Yummy!!!  All three kids (5 & under) LOVED it!!!  Thanks Melodie!!

I used salsa instead of chile sauce and added a can of green chilis and less brown sugar (1/2 tsp). Also, I used boil in the bag brown rice cooked separately and just mixed it in afterwards, so I left out the water entirely. I also used a little more cheddar on top. Pretty tasty. I might even add a little hot sauce next time (we like things spicy).

Very good. I changed it up a bit since a lot of folks said that it was too sweet. I eliminated the brown sugar all together. Added 1/2 cup of Chili sauce and 1/2 of tomato/pasta sauce instead of the 1 cup of Chili sauce. Used brown basmati rice. I also added 1/2 tsp of cayenne for a kick and a couple pinches of taco seasoning/chili powder. I browned the beef in a dutch oven, added the remaining ingredients. Simmered this for about 30 mins (did my best not to keep opening the lid) and then transferred it straight to the oven for another 20-25 mins with the top off. I served with a dollop of sour cream and cilantro. Was wonderful!!

Terrific recipe.  I followed it pretty much as written except I didn't have enough ground beef so I added in Italian sausage.  I used the full teaspoon of sugar and thought it was a nice addition that added just a hint of sweetness.  I used a chili garlic sauce that I had on hand and it doesn't contain any sugar.  Some reviewers stated that they thought the recipe was to sweet this could be because some brands of chili sauce, like Heinz contain high fructose corn syrup and are sort of sweet on their own.  The next time I make this I am going to add celery and green peas.
******************
Recently made this with Mexican chorizo and used a full cup of rice.  The chorizo really jazzed it up!  The next sausage I'm going to use in the recipe is andouille.

This was good.  The only change I made was to add 2 cloves of garlic, and a teaspoon of chili powder.  I would have added a can of green chili had I remembered.  Easy to do and no problems with my rice.  Thanks for sharing this is a good busy night meal.  Oh, and I made it all in one pan- stove top to oven.

My wife and I were pleasently surprised by how good this was, considering how fairly easy it was  to put together. Definetly top it off with sour cream and salsa to kick it up a bit.

Next time I am going to cook the rice first.I did not stir while cooking nor did I keep picking up the lid so the steam would escape.still had to add more water and bake an additional 20 minutes.Other than that a good recipe.

This was a  good dish! the recipe didn't say what kind of canned tomatoes so I used diced tomatoes with jalapeno's in, mexican blend cheese and I forgot the cilantro (well, didn't forget, just didn't put it on) and it was good! Opened a can of refried beans and avacado dip and had a real good supper!

very easy and very good! I cooked everything in the same large pan and just sprinkled the cheese over each single serving to save dishes! Make sure to watch the rice; I forgot about mine for a few minutes and it got a bit crispy!

We were disappointed in this recipe.  We love Spanish rice, but the addition of the sugar and chili sauce gave this dish an unpleasant sweet taste.

threw this together w/ a few "twists" ..  used a dutch oven ...sauteed peppers/onions then browned ground beef, used organic fire roasted tomatoes, 2 tbsp mexican chili powder, a dash of paprika, brown rice, and threw in a can of chili beans (with liquid) about a cup more water and simmered for about 40 minutes.  then threw it in the oven for about 20 min. topped w/ reduced fat mexican blend cheese, baked till melted and bubbly.  finished w/ a few dollops of low fat sour cream and some corn muffins..delish!

I liked this version. It is a plain recipe, but you should "make your own" by adding flavors that you like. I added chili beans and some "southwest seasoning" to spice it up. I cooked the rice before adding it to the meat, and I sauteed the onions with the hamburger. I used twice the amount of rice (because I like more rice then hamburger).
You could add a lot of different things, like corn or green beans and it would really good, too.

Yummo!  Sorry for using a copyrighted term, but I couldn't think of anything more fitting to describe this recipe.  I even subbed dried onion and salsa for the chile sauce. I too, had to add more water towards the last 10 minutes on the stove, but that was not an issue as it did not add cooking time to the recipe. I will be adding this to the rotation.

This is fantastic! I did a Mexican Theme for my youngest son's highschool graduation June 2007.. served this with the Lime Chicken Soft Tacos, Oaxaca Tacos and Chicken Enchiladas I by Debbie Donham (all from all recipes) 
Back to the rice.. I of-course made enough to fill one of those big white roaster pans full thinking there would be left overs- I will have to say I was shocked that every ounce of this went at the grad party! Everyone raved about it and I will have to say it was the best!!!! It was moist and cheesy, not dry like some recipes are.
It is perfect the way it is.. please dont alter the recipe.. Yes it looks like alot of ingredients but gosh every bit worth it when all done.
A keeper!!

Given all the great reviews, I really expected this to just taste great.  What a dissapointment.  Neither my husband nor myself enjoyed this.  We ate it - I guess I will say it is edible, but no one in the family got seconds.  We couldn't put our finger on it, but one of the ingredients just gave it an odd taste...perhaps the brown sugar?  It really did not taste at all like Spanish rice.  I will not make this again.

I watched as my husband took his first bite...all he could say was MMMM! And he kept saying MMM! after every bite! I made this dish last night along with tacos and spinach enchiladas. It looked very appealing in the casserole dish after cooking. My only changes were; I didn't add the brown sugar. I used a Mexican blend of diced tomatoes, and I used much more cheese for the topping than called for. I completely covered the top in a thick layer of cheese. My hubby and teens thought it was the absolute best. I had a feeling it would be one of those dishes that would taste better the next day...and I was right, I am eating the leftovers now, and it is sooooo good! This recipe wil be made everytime I serve Mexican food. A dish to be proud of!

This was wonderful!! We couldn't help but have seconds. I used 2 cans of tomatoes after reading the other reviews.  I didn't have a bell pepper so I used Mexican style stewed tomatoes, I used basmati rice and no cumin.  I did use some extra water (about 1/2 can or more), covered it and it was done in the suggested amount of time. I don't care for very spicey foods, this was just right. So delicious!!

This was much better than I thought it would be but I did make a few modifications.  I cooked the beef with some garlic salt and the onions.  Due to some reviewers who said it was too sweet, I added about 1/3 cup of salsa.  I added a can of drained kidney beans (black beans would be good too).  Since I'm not a huge cumin fan, I decreased that by 1/4 tsp. and added 1/4 tsp. of chile powder.  Instead of green bell pepper, I added a can of mild green chilies.  And since it seemed this was poured into a casserole dish and baked simply to melt the cheese, I saved dirtying another dish and when the food was done, I sprinked the cheese on top while still in the skillet, covered it and took it off the heat until melted.  This was relatively quick and very easy.

We enjoyed this dish...thanks, Melodie.  Only change would be to add additional cup of water (or liquid of your choice) towards the last half of cooking time...made it juicer.  And, as, always...more worcestershire sauce!!!

This was great.  I took the advice of other reviewers, and added about a cup extra of water, diced tomatoes and a cup of tomato juice.  The cheddar cheese on top was great, because I love cheese.  This was a real keeper.

Very easy and tasty. I didn't have time to put it in the oven so just put the cheese on top of it in the skillet with the lid on until it melted. Saved cleaning a pan, too!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  I had leftovers and used them to make Mexican Stuffed Peppers!  I just filled red and yellow peppers with the leftovers, topped with canned enchilada sauce and shredded cheese (I used a pepperjack/cheddar mix) and baked until the peppers were soft but not mushy.  My husband LOVED them!!!

Was good! The rice turned out crunchy on the top. I agree with those reviewers that have made suggestions about the rice.  I also agree that you can do everything in one pot. We put salsa on top of the finished product and we liked it.

Great recipe! Definitely a nice spin on boring taco night. I changed it a tad and added crushed tortilla chips to the bottom of the pan, and layered the cheese in the middle and on top. I also used a packet of Tex Mex chili seasoning with the need for more flavor. My husband said he could go without the chili sauce so next time, I'll probably leave it out. Throw in a few shakes of garlic salt and chili powder for taste. I also added a can of corn for more texture. Pretty darn good! Keep that k

This was definitely edible, but waaaaay too sweet for my family and I. It lacked something too, maybe some corn? Maybe less brown sugar and more spice? I think I will make this again just to use as a nice rice base to make a taco casserole. I'll add a packet of taco seasoning to the meat when browning it, nix the other spices/sauces and dump all the other veggies and rice in it and serve it with a layer of refried beans, sour cream and black olives on top.  :)

This was a great quick recipe for me, since I used leftover cooked brown rice (and omitted the water). I used a can of rotel tomatoes and added leftover tomato paste instead of using chili sauce and subbed coconut sugar for the brown sugar.  I also added quite a bit more cumin, at least twice as much, because I love it.

We just had this for dinner and it was a HUGE hit! Neither of my children are fond of cooked tomatoes, but they both loved it. My husband pouted when I said he couldn't have the left-overs for lunch. I did make a couple of substitutions out of necessity. I did not have brown sugar so I replaced it with maple syrup. Also, we were out of Worcestershire sauce. After looking online, I went with others suggestions of replacing it with steak sauce, a dash of cinnamon and a dash of ground cloves. This is definitely a keeper!

I love the idea of this dish,I didn't love the out come. The rice did not cook through and I followed reviewers advice.Also it was just to bland not enough zip.If I make this dish again I think I will aim for tangy rather then the sweet that it is.

This was a good base recipe. I added carrot, onion, and celery. I didn't have green pepper. I added a can of black beans, and I added some chipotle sauce. I also increased the cumin and chilli powder by a lot. The end result was really good.

I really enjoyed this dish, and my family did too! I only made a few tweaks: I used medium salsa instead of the chile sauce, and also added more cumin and Worcestershire sauce than the recipe calls for.  It was super easy and I will definitely make it again!

This was very good...a great comfort food!  I subbed ground chicken which I browned with a bunch of spices (garlic, etc).  I decided to use brown rice instead of white and added a full 28oz can of tomatoes instead of using water with the smaller can of tomatoes.  This had great flavor, a bit sweet, but savory at the same time (not spicy at all).  I skipped the cilantro at the end as we don't like it.  Served with a green salad for a balanced meal - yummy :)

I followed this recipe exactly.  And I had reservations the entire time I was making this.  First, I thought there was too much liquid and not enough rice.  Then, as things got going, I thought the rice was going to be undercooked because I had gone back and read reviews while I was waiting. But, it turned out fabulous.  I did do one thing differently, I used only one skillet for the entire thing.  However, that's not changing anything.  My husband did note the sweetness to it.  We thought it was a different flavor, but enjoyed the originality of it.  He ate his folded inside a tortilla with some sour cream and extra cheese.  I used some tortilla chips and sour cream with mine.  Overall, excellent recipe.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I loved making it all in one pot for easy clean up. I did mess up and use brown rice, which I later found out takes really long to cook. Next time I’ll make sure to use white rice or start this earlier. With the brown rice I had to wait another 20 minutes. But it was well worth the wait. I’m not a big fan of cilantro but it really tasted great on this meal. I think with the leftovers we’ll eat with it wrapped in a tortilla!

This was good - I think the rice needs to be cooked 10-15 minutes on it's own before going in the mixture to simmer.

My husband and I are vegetarian, so I adapted this to suit our needs by using 2 cans of black beans (rinsed) and quinoa in place of the beef and brown rice. I also substituted spicy salsa for the chili sauce and omitted the brown sugar because we prefer spicy to sweet. I used frozen mixed peppers and onions and a can of green chiles. Instead of the salt, I used a bouillon cube. This was really a "dump everything in and cook" recipe. This was really delicious and my husband had seconds. Ok yeah, I changed stuff, but this recipe is a great base for doing just that.

this is a good base for the makings of a great side dish. I used jalapeno instead of bell pepper, diced roasted tomatoes instead of chile sauce, fresh minced garlic and omitted the brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce. I made the rice ( brown) in the rice cooker ahead of time to speed up assembly. I plan on making this again

This is incredibly tasty.  Since I already had a very similar recipe that used shredded lettuce, I did fold in shredded lettuce into the whole mixture just before the cheese topping. I too used only one pan for the whole process.  An absolute must have in your repertoire of recipes.

Just tried this for the first time, really yummy.  Lots of flavor.  I will reduce the simmering time next time, mine burned just a bit on the bottom.  Served it with refried beans and tortillas, both husband and kids loved it!

I make a similar dish, but this recipe is definately better. I used ground turkey & sauteed the onions with it & added seasoned salt & chilli powder. I then added a large can of diced tomatoes, a jar of salsa & the remaining ingredients. I omitted the chili sauce & brown sugar, as suggested by others. I also used brown rice. This definately took longer. I had to simmer everything for about 1 hr. I transferred it to a baking dish & topped with lots of cheddar cheese & green onion. We can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow night! I am going to use it for taco salads! Thanks for the recipe!

i am rating 4 because of brown sugar and those darn whole tomatoes.  i will definitely leave it out the brown sugar...i hated it sweet!  Also don't use whole tomatoes. i don't like that much in a bite.  but if you do go ahead.  diced tomatoes would have been much better.  I used chicken broth instead of water...I know it will be really good next time!

Delish!!!  I made it with brown rice and used Trader Joe's Salsa Authentica instead of chile sauce.  I also used a whole green pepper instead  of measuring out a 1/4 cup.  An important note if you're using brown rice - it needs to simmer for about 50 minutes instead of 30.  It had tons of flavor and felt hearty even with brown rice, 90% meat and reduced fat cheese.  I will definitely be making this again!

I added taco seasoning to the beef, and made my own chili sauce with 1/2 cup ketchup + 2 tsp chili powder.  Only used 1 pan & I did not take the cover off the pan to stir while the rice was cooking because that would let the steam escape which is part of how the rice cooks.  Really tasty!

This was pretty good. It reminded me of an enchilada without the tortilla. My kids (6 and 3) didn't care for it though. The hubs thought it was just ok. If I make it again I will probably add some kind of spice for heat and maybe mix cheese throughout instead of just on top.

Good and easy. Made with brown rice (additional time and liquid). Would make it again but will top with less cheese in the end.

This was delicious! I made a few alterations. I, along with some others, used salsa. But I did use a can of chiles also. I used taco seasoning for my hamburger as well as 2 cloves of garlic. Turned out FANTASTIC. Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making it again!

This was very tasty but next time will use brown rice to make it healthier.  And I used my own garden tomatoes & my spicey tomato chili sauce recipe from Jan Larsen on allrecipes.com.

Made this for dinner last night - YUMMY! After reading other reviews & based on what I had on hand I used fire roasted tomatoes instead of plain tomatos.  Did not have chili sauce so I used a can of tomatos with chilis.  Did not add the brown sugar...do not care for this kind of meal being sweet. One other thing, did not put in the oven. At end put cheese on top and covered it until it melted. Just the kind of meal I like (had 2 servings)

I made a vegetarian version of this dish using Morning Star Farms Grillers Recipe Crumbles and it still came out delicious. I added additional spices to the crumbles while it cooked as suggested in other reviews, used instant rice which I precooked and cooked it all in a cast iron skillet. I didn't think it was sweet. The dish came out perfectly and I will definately make it again.

I live in Spain and have never seen this dish hahaha  maybe it is Mexican or south american.  People in Spain do not eat spicy sauces (other than the spicy ketchup type sauce on Bravas) and cheddar cheese is not popular.  still is a great dish and went over well with my family.

I made this with instant brown rice and omitted the cilantro as I had none. I respect others reviews that this is not a true Spanish dish yet I found it to be delicious and my family seemed to really enjoy it. I am in search of recipes that I can easily make that do not include meat but contain enough vegetables and beans (maybe) to serve as a filling main dish. My goal is to cut down the meat consumption in my families meals to 3 times per week. I am thinking this may be one that I could use black beans instead of meat with. If any who read this review have any helpful insight than please do share. Otherwise cook and enjoy.

I love this dish.   I am for doing things easy so I used a dutch oven and browned the hamburger, onions and green pepper and then used canned wild rice and used the rest of the ingredients as listed and popped it right in the oven and baked it until the cheese was melted.  Cut off 30 minutes and the wild rice gives it a bit of a nutty flavor...  yummmm...

This was a great recipe! I used what I had on hand and made some changes due to not having everything. I put garlic powder and onion powder in with the beef. Then, I mixed red onions, peppers, black beans, minute rice, and enchilada sauce in to simmer on the stove. Simmering for 30 on low heat covered, then added cheese to it and simmered another 5 minutes to melt cheese. It was great and I think you can change it to fit what you have on hand. Thanks for sharing

I added cayenne and chili powder to this.  I had to add more water as the rice wasn't done yet.  I wasn't expecting too much from this but the flavours all came together really nicely.

This was awesome! I needed to add some extra water because I kept it on the stove on low rather than baking. Fantastic flavor. Picky hubby loved it too! Will definitely be in my top picks for easy, healthy, and delicious!!

I used 10 minute brown rice, can of green chilies, and some green sauce. 

I have made this a few times now, but I highly recommend you do not use curry (I did on accident-just saw the cu on the container) instead of cumin. Makes for an odd flavor. But is great if you use the correct ingredients.

Yummy!  Especially considering how easy it is.  Just a few changes- I used yellow and green bell peppers from my garden.  I didn't have a can of tomatoes, so I used a can of tomato sauce and added a fresh chopped tomato.  The only rice that I had was Uncle Bens Ready rice so I cooked the meat mixture with everything except the rice and water.  Then I added the ready rice in the last couple of minutes until it was heated through.  Super easy and I didn't have to deal with the rice not being cooked enough like I read in some of the other reviews.  Before baking, I mixed shredded cheese into the whole mixture in addition to sprinkling on top.  Served with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips on top.  It was a hit!

LOVED this!!!  In fact, my husband thought it was the best casserole I had ever made.  Also used salsa instead of chili sauce, no green pepper or cilantro, played a little with the spices.  Fantastic - will be definitely making again!

We decided to try this because we were tired of our usual Mexican meals.  I did a few things differently based on some hunches.  My husband doesn't like tomatoes very much, so I substituted a can of black beans for the canned tomatoes.  I left out the green peppers and substituted salsa for the chile sauce.  I cooked the onions with the ground meat.  And then to give the casserole more structure I put a flour tortilla on the bottom of the dish, layered the meat and rice mixture on top, then half cup cheddar cheese, then another tortilla, rice mixture and top with another half cup of cheddar.  The cilantro garnish is a must!  It turned out so well that I think I'll keep my alterations!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved this! I used Rotel Chunky style tomatoes instead and added a small bag of the Mahatma Long grain & Wild rice with seasonings. I was afraid it might come out too seasoned but I chanced it and it was delicious! My husband ate it all! He is so picky and said that he loved it!~

Yummy and oh so easy! The changes I made were based on what I had on hand.  Ground turkey, 10 oz can diced tomatoes w/chilies, no bell pepper. I only put in about 1/2 the brown sugar called for and I added about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and about 1/2 cup extra water. I cooked up everything in my cast iron skillet (took about 40 min for my rice to cook) and then into the oven.  Clean up was also a breeze. It doesn't get much easier than this.  Will definitely keep this recipe handy for those busy weeknights. Thanks for sharing Melodie!

This was pretty easy and tasty. I also used salsa in place of chile sauce because I didn't know what chile sauce was. I  used brown rice and didn't use much cheese for the topping. I realized as I was cooking that this is almost the same recipe as my stuffing for stuffed green peppers. I wasn't super wowed by this recipe but it was pretty good for an easy meal.

This was pretty good.  If I make it again, I will either use less brown sugar or none at all since it was a little too sweet for me.  Also, my rice wasn't completely cooked so I'll add more water and cook a little longer.  My family liked it and I served with sour cream on the side.

Good basic recipe for an easy "what's for dinner" - Added lot more spice ( aunt cora's soulfood seasoning is good)Kind of tastes like the "stuff" in stuffed peppers. If mix starts to dry out when simmering, just add a bit more water or V-8 juice.

Just ok...kind of reminded me of hamburger helper, maybe a step up.  No one said one word at dinner, whether they liked it or not.  I did not remove the lid as other reviewers recommended and the rice did turn out perfect.  6 servings may be stretching it a bit, had to supplement with big salads and corn on the cob.  I love spicy, but I didn't mind the sweetness of the dish, but it was just ok.

This was good.  Note that if you are using brown rice (I did), you need to let the rice mixture simmer for at least 45 minutes.  I used salsa instead of chili sauce because I wasn't exactly sure what kind of chili sauce the recipe meant.... still good!  I served it with black beans the first time and for leftovers, I put the beans right on top!

This was excellent - very tasty and easy to make.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Update:  I've found that I never have chili sauce available, and always use salsa instead.  It is always a hit with my family.

I just made this today.  It was delicious!  I followed the recipe but made some minor changes.  I accidentally measured 1/2 cup of chopped green bell pepper instead of 1/4 and the extra 1/4 cup didn't do any harm.  I love green bell pepper, so the more of it the better.  I also followed another's advice to add 28 oz of canned diced tomatoes and it came out perfectly.  Not too dry and not too runny.  Perfect.   At the end, I decided to do the bake and added the entire packet (8 oz or 2 cups) of shredded cheddar cheese on top.  Perfection.  My husband said "oh wow, this is good!"

Delicious!  Changed just a couple things for personal preferences (ground turkey instead of beef, no brown sugar, some cayenne pepper) but left the recipe largely intact and loved it!  Will be added to the rotation.

This is so yummy! My whole family loved it, and it's not easy to please all of them. I used the amount of ground beef the recipe called for, but doubled everything else. In place of water I used V8 juice and chicken broth. Thumbs up!

Really enjoyed this flavorful dish.  It's great as is, but I made a few minor changes.  I used 1/2 cup hot chili sauce and that was bordering on over-powering for me.  Next time I will use a milder chili sauce.  I added flour tortillas to the bottom of the cassarole dish before transfering and replaced cilantro with chopped green onion.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Great at dinner and easy to take for lunch at the office the next day.  Served with jalepeno corn bread.

very tasty. I used 1 cup onion, 2 tablespoons minced garlic and 1 green bell pepper and cooked them with the meat. I also seasoned the base mixture (meat, onion, garlic and bell pepper) with salt, pepper and the cumin. (I used 1 teaspoon cumin) In addition I used 1 cup salsa. While cooking there was not enough water so the total amount of water I used was almost 2 cups. This was definitely a crowd pleaser as I used it for a church potluck and it was finished fast. I received a lot of compliments. Definitely a keeper.

This was really good. I had left over rice so I just omitted the water and added the rice and simmered for around 15-20 instead of the 30. I forgot to add the chilli sauce and it was still very good, just added hot chilli flakes after, and topped with sour cream. Really good.

Very good!  I used this recipe as a starting point and added a few other ingredients for more flavor, color, and texture.   While the beef was browning, I added the dry spices, and I probably added more than a tablespoon of Cumin.  I also added garlic powder.  Not only did I add 1 can of tomatoes, I also added a can of ro-tel tomatoes.    I didn't have any chile sauce, so I added a good cup of salsa.   I also stirred in a small can of mexi-corn and a can of black beans, drained.   Because of my additions, the rice seemed a little overwhelmed by the other ingredients. Next time I think I'd adda full cup of rice.  I poured it all into a rectangular baking dish, sprayed with nonstick spray.  Topped it with way more than 1/2 cup of cheese.   VERY, VERY good.  Love the flavors, love the ease of this recipe.  My husband thought it would be great served up with some shredded lettuce, sour cream and black olives.  Next time!  :)

I just made this recipe tonight, my husband is still happily eating!  This recipe was delicious!  In an attempt to eat healthier this year I used ground turkey and brown rice.  While making the mixture I was reading the reviews and started to think it may end up too sweet so I decided to additionally add a tsp of chili powder and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I also agree that it could have used a little bit more water, although I got away with not having to add any...if I had let it simmer any longer it would have needed it, but the rice was done after 30 minutes.  The only other thing I did in the end of the baking was I broiled it for 2 minutes, just to lightly brown the cheese.  We will definetly be making and eating this recipe again!  Thanks for sharing!!

My family LOVES this recipe.  I substitued salsa for the chile sauce, but other than that made it as per the recipe.  Absolutely fantastic - easy and delicious.  Reheats in the microwave really well for leftovers too!

Wow, this was great! Used wild rice instead of white. Added 1/4 cup more water because of the wild rice. Also added one small can of tomatoes w/chiles for flavor. Was quite easy to make and had fantastic taste!

Delicious! A make again recipe! Didn't change the recipe except a bit more meat and a tad more rice. For the tomatoes I used the diced ones, the cheddar the lower fat version, and Slenda brown sugar.

Good base ingredients...but no big whoop in the flavor/presentation department.  I will try to make it again....maybe it's better as a chip dip or something.

I make a similar spanish rice using bacon instead of the gr beef.  I use home canned tomatoes and tomato juice, onion, rice and cheese, s & p to taste and my family likes much better than the sweeter version. (plus I am diabetic and this would be too much sugar for me)

We make this recipe often, but use brown rice instead.  Should double it when making it as it is great for leftovers- even freezes well too.

This was a great jumping off point.  I did feel it needed the spices amped up a bit but that depends on your taste buds.  I left out the brown sugar since I was afraid it would be too sweet and it wasn't missed.  I also added garlic to it and topped with black olives.  The munchkin loved it and asked for seconds.  Thanks for the recipe!

The end result of this recipe was delicious, but it required a couple of alterations from the original recipe.  (1) The rice does not cook in the time allotted. I kept the top on as other reviewers recommended, but still had to add water and let it cook for another 20 minutes or so.  (2) It would be way too sweet with the brown sugar and all the chile sauce. I only used about 3/4 of the chile sauce and half the brown sugar and might even cut it down more next time. Or use tomato sauce instead of chile sauce as recommended by some.  I used canned diced tomatoes, Cracker Barrel extra sharp white cheddar cheese, and ground buffalo. I also served with Parmesan cheese on the side.  Overall, it's a really tasty recipe and super easy for leftovers.

This is a VERY good, easy and economical recipe! Made this for my bf and I last night. It is a tad sweet, but not terribly so - I think it depends on the brand of chile sauce you choose (I used Heinz). I pretty much followed MELODIE's cooking directions, but did make a few changes to suit my/our tastes. Along with my substitutions, here's what I did: a) subbed a 14.5 oz. can of Delmonte diced tomatoes with mild green chilies, b) subbed a 14.5 oz. can beef broth for the water called for, c) subbed Mexican-blend cheese (~ 1.5 c. worth - whatever was left of my already used pkg.), d) added 2 minced garlic cloves, e) browned my ground sirloin with the onions, garlic and green pepper as opposed to adding them after the browning step and (finally) f) simmered everything, covered, for 20 minutes as per the directions on my box of rice, then sampled (rice was still crunchy...), added the rest of the can of beef broth (I started out with just 1 c. as directed) and covered again for 10 minutes but ended up having to cook 5 minutes more to get the rice consistency to my liking. I baked everything in my 2 qt. casserole dish for 12.5 minutes (which was the perfect amount of time IMHO). Served each helping with a garnish of fresh cilantro (a MUST!) and a side of garlic bread. My bf said I should make this again :) Thanks for sharing!

as far as cheap and fast recipes go, this one's a keeper!  I use brown rice (cook a bit longer) chicken broth instead of water, salsa instead of chili sauce, and some extra spice for kick.  Very good.  I also use very lean ground beef so there's no fat to drain, that way I can brown the beef in a dutch oven, add the onions and peppers, add the rice, continue the recipe as stated, throw the whole pot into the oven - no need to dirty three pans if you have a dutch oven!

This easy supper disappeared in no time flat! As with previous reviewers I increased the diced tomatoes to 28oz. and used a combination of 1/2cup salsa and 2 tsp. chili powder instead of the chili sauce. I also substituted pepper jack cheese in place of the cheddar for a little extra kick. I will definitely make this again!

Very. very tasteful!  The only variation was adding 2 cans of tomatoes instead of 1.  My hubby brought the leftovers to work and all the guys raved about it too!  This would also be a great filling for stuffed peppers.....trying it next time!

I made this in an attempt to have a "made-ahead" dish, and to please everyone at the table.  I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor because I've made similar recipes that turn out to be so-so, but this had a bit of zing that everybody liked. My daughter loves all food except rice, and even she enjoyed it!

This is really good.  I used ground turkey (only 1/2 of a lb) and put in some chipolte peppers in adobo sauce.  I also used the thai chili sauce.  It had such great flavor. The only thing I will add next time is some mexi corn.  No brown sugar (forgot it) and did it all in one pan for some pretty easy clean up.  Easy meal for a work nite!

This was good. It wasn't spectacular or anything but it was good and I will probably make it again. It's more like a side dish than a meal in itself.  I did use taco sauce instead of the chili sauce because that is what I had on hand.  Will make some changes next time.

Awesome recipe. It can be served as a side or maindish, and the ground beef can be left out without hurting the flavor. Even my kids love it.

WOW! This is a different take on your traditional Spanish Rice, but it is oh sooo good. It has a sweet but spicy taste to it. I doubled the recipe and served it as a side dish to tacos for our poker night. The only thing I did different was use rotel instead of canned tomatoes, and I threw in a couple dashes of chili powder. This is definitely a keeper and I can't wait to make it again!

Was in the mood for something different and decided Spanish Rice would fill the bill.  Followed the recipe exactly and it got a rave review from my husband. Definitely a "keeper". Will print and take when we travel as it's easy to prepare and so delicious. Thanks for sharing this wonderful dish.

This dish is great! I used original ro-tel (which has chilies in it) instead of canned tomatoes, added a packet of taco seasoning, a dash of cayenne pepper, and put breadcrumbs on top. For leftovers, I made "hot pockets" out of refrigerated biscuit dough, filled them with the spanish rice bake, and warmed them in the oven. It was fantastic!

Quite tasty although I changed a few things because I didn't have all of the ingredients that the recipe asked for. I subbed a package of taco seasoning for the chili sauce and then mixed it in with 3/4 of a cup of water. I used a can of tomato soup and about 1/3 cup of salsa instead of the tomatos. 
We will definitely make this one again!

I used ground turkey for this, salsa, as others suggested, pepper jack cheese and skipped the salt and cilantro. I felt it needed a few more seasonings, but other than that, my gang loved it. Thanks Melodie!

This was great.  My husband hates Spanish rice, so I added a can of red beans to the mix, served with tortillas, and called it rice and bean burritos.  He didn't know the difference.  Very good and easy.

Chile sauce is actually closer to ketchup in flavor, rather than picante or taco sauce.  You can find it on the ketchup isle, next to the cocktail sauce.  That said, I didn't have any on hand - so I substituted 1/4 ketchup mixed with 1/4 picante.  I used brown rice - took 1 hr 15min to cook, which I expected.  Overall not than great, my husband asked me not to make it again -- although in all fairness I wasn't true to the recipe... I also didn't care for the texture of chopped cilantro on the top (and we love cilantro). I have a feeling using chile sauce, rather than picante, make a big differnce.

Looking for recipes to replace the boxed hamburg helper I found this one to be good!  Since I discovered that soaking rice prior to cooking can shorten the cooking time, I automatically soaked the rice in a bowl with the recommended amount of water for 5-15 min. while I was browning the gr. beef.  You could soak the rice in the tomatoe water if desired.  I added green beans just because I was in the mood for them.

This recipe was OK. It was too sweet for me. Thats all I could taste. I just dont like my main dish to be so sweet. Others who dont mind sweet will like this recipe. Dont get me wrong, this dish was good it just wasnt to my taste.

We just had this dish for supper tonight with a side salad.  Over all it was pretty good although I did modify it just alitte.  First I didn't have any chili sauce so I had to substitue some sweet homemade relish mixed with some home made pepper sauce that I have.  Mixing the two tasted very much like chili sauce.  I agree with some of the other reviewers who said the sauce was too sweet.  To cut back on the sweetness and give it alittle kick I added some medium salsa (about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup).  I had some precooked rice so I added that to the mixture after letting the sauce simmer the 30 minutes, (about 2 to 3 cups cooked rice depending on how thick you want this mixture to be. Thanks

This recipe was awesome! I got all the correct ingredients, including fresh cilantro, and the only thing that I did differently from the recipe, is I went ahead and added cilantro to the dish itself. (Depending on your stove, you make want to simmer the rice for about 35 minutes*Remember though, that when you bake it in the oven, that gives the rice extra cooking time, for it to get "done"*Also depending on your on prefrences, you may or may not need to add a little more water while your simmering the dish, depending on the texture and consistency that you prefer*). I then added the cheese to the top and I let it "brown". Then I added another layer of cheese and just cooked it long enough to melt it. Then just add the cilantro to the top for the garnish. This was actually one of the best dishes I have ever had. My husband said, "that the only bad thing aobut this dish, is that there wasn't more of it, and that this was good enough to bring to his mother's house!"

My husband and I thought it was very tasty, however it needed some 'zip', we chopped up some jalapeno peppers and added them.  I will definitely make this again, but will add the jalapenos along with the green pepper.

This is a delicious and stick-to-your-ribs dish that my family really liked.  I used a can of tomatoes with mild green chilis and lots more cheddar cheese on top.  Leftovers tasted even better the next day.

Really easy to put together.  I only made one substitution, using mild picante sauce instead of the chile sauce.  My spouse loved it, and he is a picky eater.

Very, very good. I added black beans. Even my picky spouse said to add this to the list!

This recipe is a keeper!  I substituted riced cauliflower for the rice, I used vegan “Beyond Meat” instead of ground beef and use dairy-free cheese in place of the cheddar cheese.
It was unbelievably good!  Loaded with flavor!  

 I’ll definitely make this again and again!

Like others here, I tweaked the original recipe just a little. I used chicken broth instead of water. I omitted the brown sugar. I used 2 cans of rotel mild. And I used par boiled rice instead of long grain rice. It came out perfect. Served with a side of refried beans and tortilla chips. It was a delicious alternative to the usual Taco Tuesday.

I NEVER don't adjust recipes, and ALWAYS use the reviews, but because this one (1) had such a great rating and (2) had so many reviews, I didn't consult them.  Maybe I should have.  For me, this was just "ok."  It just didn't seem to have much flavor.  If I do make it again, I will consult the reviews to see if they help.

I was surprised how much I liked this.  i didn't have tomatoes so I used a can of rotel.  I added garlic and taco seasoning to the meat while browning and added a can of corn. Otherwise I made it as written. I brought everything to a boil and covered it for 30 min. My rice wasn't  done ony because i had only 1/2 a cup of white rice and used brown for the rest.  The white rice was done and not the brown! oops!  Thanks for the recipe

I chose this because I just happened to have everything it called for already in the house, well except brown sugar. I didnt have regular canned tomatoes, but I had rotel (hot). If you use rotel, watch out with your chili sauce. I used franks and even though I cut it down by half, it was still spicy for hubby. I used a dutch oven and cooked it all on the stove. I rinsed my rice a few times so it was plumped, brought it all to a boil and then set the burner on 2 1/2 (low) for 40 min. Only stirred twice. Topped with cilantro and green onions and a dollop of sour cream. Adding this to my rotation when I need something easy and quick. This is a cost effective meal and it is easily customizable. PS I joined this site to leave this (my first) review  :) Thanks for the recipe!

We really liked this spicy and filling casserole! I used brown rice and it definitely needs to cook for at least 10 more minutes than is stated in the directions; covering the pot while it simmered helped cook the rice too.

This was good.  I bumped it up to a more interesting main dish.  I used mild salsa instead of the water, added frozen corn, onion, celery, black beans, green olives, doubled the cumin and added some cayenne pepper.  Very satisfying.

Very good. Easy to make. Good base dish because the people who like "mild" could eat it as-is and the people who like spicy could add hot sauce, etc. Adding beans next time I make this.

This is a relatively quick and easy way to satisfy a craving for Mexican food. My husband said it was  a keeper. I omitted the brown sugar, added a can of Rotel and used 1/4 cup of Frank's Red Hot Sauce. I also used an entire chopped green bell pepper. Next time, I will use 1/2 cup salsa instead of Frank's and a 28 oz. can of tomatoes instead of the two smaller cans.

Followed the recipe with the exception of baking it in a covered casserole at 350 for 1 hr. Added the cheese & baked uncovered until the cheese melted.

I made this in a large pot and doubled the recipie. Used brown rice and had to cook on low for about an hour.  Did not use the brown sugar. We like alot of flavor so went heavy and added in a few more to our tastes. Used med salsa to replace chili sauce.  Added in an extra 8 oz of salsa  for more flavor. Did not transfer to a casserole dish. Sprinkled cheese on top and kept the lid on until melted. Served with extra cheese, sour cream and cilantro. Husband ate tortilla chips with his. This is definitely  going into the rotation.  Thanks!

I don't rate many recipes but I had to put my 2 cents in about this one.  I made it as written except I used Rotel instead of the canned tomatoes.  This gave it some heat and savory.  I also added black olives.  I served it over Mission tortilla strips.  It was awesome.  It warms up just as good as when it was first made.  It is best when put into hard shell tacos.  The crunch the sweetness, the savory all come together to make a fantastic meal.  Thank you for sharing with us.

The only thing I would do next time is make sure to cook the rice a little more because it came out a little too al dente.  I also added a layer of refried beans before topping it with the cheese and even my five-year-old loved it!

We thought this was very good.  I followed the recipe with the exception that I added a jalapeño pepper and I cooked everything in the same pan (just sprinkled the cheese over the top before serving it). It was sweeter than I expected, but may or may not make adjustments for that; my husband liked it as is.  I'm sure I'll make this again.

This is a great recipe that can be made in one oven-proof pan and can be modified to your family's taste. We like spicy so I used hot enchilada sauce instead of chilli sauce. I also omitted the brown sugar and Worcestershire. I cooked the ground beef, onions and green pepper in an oven ready pan, adding the cumin and some tex-mex seasoning while it cooked. I drained the fat and then added a cup of rice, the canned tomatoes ( mine were spicy red pepper flavoured), enchilada sauce and chicken broth instead of water. I made sure that the liquids totalled 2 cups to properly cook the  cup of rice. I brought it to a boil and then let it simmer covered for about 30 minutes stirring a few times. I then topped it with tex-mex shredded cheese and popped it in the oven until the cheese melted. I forgot to add the cilantro but it definitely would have added to the dish.

This is a nice forgiving, delicious recipe.  I used ground turkey in place of the beef and taco sauce instead of chile (chili?) sauce because that's what I had on hand.  Also, I added 2 cloves garlic, minced while sauteing turkey, onions and pepper.  I halved the salt and felt the brown sugar should eliminated, increased the cumin to 1 teaspoon and black pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. Instead of cheddar cheese, I used a shredded Mexican blend of cheeses to cover the top.  My husband doesn't like cilantro so I snuck a little dried cilantro into the casserole.  Garnished with sliced green onions and a dollop of sour cream on each serving.  You can change things around in this recipe according to your taste and it still comes out great.  Hubs loved it.  I submitted my own recipe called "Turkey Spanish Rice" because I made so many changes as other reviewers have suggested in the past.

I stepped it up a notch by adding 1 cup frozen corn. I served the casserole on a bed of shredded lettuce and topped with crushed taco chips. A few dollops of sour cream and extra chopped cilantro dressed it up nicely.

I have made this twice now and it's a big hit even with my 3 yr old. the second time I did not add the brown sugar and I added a half a can of black beans cause the first time hubby said it was a lite dinner. both times I cooked  this there was no need to put it in the oven. cook on stove top just fine.

This recipe is AWESOME! I knew to use a little less sugar and even worsteshire. I don't like the taste of the ground beef to be overpowered. I used parboiled rice, it cooks faster. I also added the cheese throughout the dish just before baking, rather than on top.Lastly, I didn't have cumin nor cilantro and my family enjoyed EVERY cheesy bite!!! THANKS 4SHARING.??

I just made this right now and it was so delicious. I added an extra bit of water and simmer day for about 10 extra minutes. I also added a little green chilies and salsa instead of chili sauce. I'm going to try this next time using ground chicken. I will definitely be making this again

This is a family favorite! I use either mild salsa or sweet chile sauce so that it is mild enough for my husband's allergy and my children to eat. We also load the cilantro on top (who uses 2 TBSP of cilantro on anything!?! lol). It's easy and delicious!

I thought this was good but my rice was also undercooked.  I should have read the reviews prior to making it, because I did not realize I needed to cover the pan while it was simmering.  It still turned out pretty good and I thought the flavor was good.  I may try making some of the changes others have suggested such as using salsa instead of water and adding some corn.

This was great! Delicious! 

I had the same problem that a lot of people did with the rice burning/cooking through all the liquid without softening enough. This is despite the fact I never drained the hamburger (it was low fat to begin with) and added a whole batch of the 'chili sauce' recipe I used from this website--so about double the non-water liquid. Next time, maybe I'll try a lower temperature/longer cook time and double the water as well. I'll have to look at the comments. It probably doesn't help that I'm cooking at high altitude.

But the recipe tasted so good in the end that tweaking the time and temp will be worth it. The other subs I made were to double the cheese I put on top and use 2 jalapenos instead of green pepper because that's what we had in our garden. My husband liked it best with sour cream and even preferred it better the next day. The suggestion to use a skillet-dutch oven turned out to be great! One pan all the way.

I had no problem with the rice. I think the reason some people had undercooked rice is that they did not cover the pot during cooking. Also for the chili sauce you have to use the kind more similar to cocktail sauce rather than the Siracha type if you're following the recipe. I used a whole green pepper because it's silly to waste the rest of it and actually it could have used more. Also cooked the spices with the meat and used a single pot. Didn't use any cheese, authentic Spanish rice doesn't include cheese; even though this is not an authentic version it's still pretty good and easy to make.

My family and I ate this for dinner tonight and loved every bite! I follwed a few tips from other posts. Added alittle taco seasoning to meat, used 1 &1/4 cup water and simmer on low for 40 mins, no sugar and replaced the chile sauce with salsa.

This was excellent! I made a few adjustments, only because of what I had in my pantry. I used 2 (10oz.) cans Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies (mild) instead of the diced tomatoes, green pepper, and chili sauce (I omitted the sugar). In an oven safe, covered skillet, I browned the beef (97% lean), with the onions, and then added the rest of the ingredients (except the cheese), covered and cooked until the rice was done. Uncovered, sprinkled with cheese and placed the uncovered skillet in the oven until the cheese was melted and slightly browned. Garnished with sliced scallions (didn’t have cilantro) and sour cream. Everyone loved this, even the Grandkids, who asked me to make it again, really-really soon… lol Next time I’ll double the recipe, the little bit of leftovers was great the next day... but left me wanting more!

This was excellent! I did make a few adjustments. I used red and banana peppers instead of green pepper. I used canned tomatoes with green chilies instead of plain canned tomatoes. I used Heinz brand of chili sauce but also added about 1 T sriracha sauce. Rice took longer to cook so had to increase liquid. Will definitely make again

I absolutely love this, and have made it many times now; it's really wonderful fresh, with the sweet sauce and the cilantro.  I typically hate leftover food, but this is one leftover dish I can eat all week.  It is sweet, depending on how much brown sugar you use.  I didn't have bell peppers the first time I've made this, so I substituted garbanzo beans instead, and have been making it with garbanzo beans since then.  I also had run out of chile sauce, so used a mixture of tomato sauce/brown sugar/vinegar/allspice.  Oh, and don't mess with all the extra frying pans and saucers; brown the beef in one dish, drain the fat, and simply add the rest of the ingredients to that dish, after which you can transfer it all to the appropriate casserole dish.  Just delicious!

Tasty! Reminds me a bit of my stuffed bell pepper filling, but easier and quicker to make. My kids are grown, but I wish we'd had this recipe in our arsenal while they were with us. It's great to have another option for ground beef. I followed the recipe, except I used a 28-oz can of tomatoes, as well as a couple of the tips in other reviews, adding a handful of frozen corn at the same time as the other additions, and browning the ground beef along with a clove of garlic and the onion. I, too, made the entire meal in a cast iron skillet rather than messing with other pots. My husband raved about this and enjoyed seconds as well as taking some for lunch the next day.

Pretty good basic recipe. I used chicken instead of beef, and cooked in just one oven-proof metal saucepan. I put one whole bell pepper, homemade marinara sauce instead of crushed tomatoes, and taco sauce instead of chili or salsa. I skipped the sugar too.

Ever since I located this recipe I have made it at least once every two weeks.  I don't change a thing and I absolutely love it.  I always get to freeze some for later and this meal makes a great lunch for work next day.  It has been a hit at a few pot lucks at work, and with family members.  Recipe is a keeper for me.

This was very good but only after reading the other reviews, I did add a can of black beans, corn, diced tomatoes, extra cummin, garlic and taco seasoning. I also spread a can of refried beans on the bottom of the casserole dish. Served this with corn chips. I added 3 cups of sharp cheddar cheese to the top before baking. MMMMM it was so good and the whole family loved it! It takes a 13X19 size baking dish, this makes a lot! After I fried up the ground beef and other ingredients I transfered it to the baking dish with the refried beans on the bottom, this way I could store the leftovers in the fridge without removing it from the dish. (oh, I forgot to add the sugar, it does not need it).

This recipe was great!   To make it a little bit healthier I used ground turkey and quiona rather than rice. I added some taco seasoning to the turkey and used tomato sauce instead of chili sauce.  I didn't have any canned tomatos and it turned out great!

DELICIOUS!! I've made it a few times already and its a hit. A few people commented on the rice not being cooked, I usually add a LITTLE (maybe a couple table spoons)bit more water and use a cover while its cooking. It makes a difference.

I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of: adding a couple of chopped chorizo sausage along with the beef mince, using home-made passata sauce instead of tinned tomatoes, used chicken stock instead of water and increased the amount of rice (I used jasmine) slightly by 10 grams. Also pepped up the flavour by adding some chili powder and a dash of Tabasco.Was planning to make chili con carne initially for dinner then thought hmmm, why not do this recipe instead and have a one-pot dish with everything in it. So before transferring to the dish to bake, added a can of kidney beans. A friendly tip while baking in the oven - cover the dish with foil so the cheese won't harden and the rice won't get burned. Hubby loved it, went for seconds. Tasted even better the next day. Got some frozen in reserve for emergency days when there's no time to cook. A real keeper!

My family enjoyed this dish. I did however make a few alterations because I did not have some of the ingredients on hand. Instead of chile sauce I used 8oz can of tomato sauce and added some chili powder. Also didn't have cilantro, so I used green onions. Used orange and yellow bell peppers instead of green bell peppers too. Definitely will be making this again soon!

Excellent recipe! I used salsa instead of chile sauce as some of the other reviews suggested. I also added a can of corn and used a cup of rice instead of 3/4 cup.

This is really good.  Quick dinner and I had leftovers the next day.  Used low fat cheddar and topped with low fat sour cream and cilantro.  Will make often.

Fantastic, easy to prepare and always enjoyed by my family of 3 males and myself.  I followed the recipe exactly and I use Heinz Chili Sauce, it's not crazy hot but adds a great taste. I layer 1/2 the meat/rice mixture, then a layer of cheese, then repeat.

This is a very good and easy recipe. I would not use 1/2 cup chili sauce unless you want to set your mouth on fire. Otherwise, it is good as is.

Super delicious.  Takes a little time to make, and I made some adjustments (added more bell peppers, different colored bell peppers, used tabasco sauce instead of chile sauce) based on what I had around the house.  Still, what a very tasty and wholesome dish.

This is sooo good with the only downfall being that you have to simmer the meat mixture longer than specified to get the rice fully done. I don't like to chomp on the hard rice, but even then it is a good recipe.

This turned out wonderful.  I had to modify the recipe for my mom since she cannot eat very much salt.  So I cut out the chile sauce, the worcestershire sauce and the salt.  Added instead cayenne powder..small amount and a can of no salt canned kidney beans. I used no salt  canned tomatoes as well.  Thought it would turn out very bland but was actually really good.  For those of us not on low sodium I added some hot sauce and sour cream to after plating.  My husband even got seconds and he usually doesn't care for rice dishes at all.

This dish was very good! I browned the beef in chile powder and minced garlic. I also used salsa. It was a little too spicy for my husband but just right for me. You can always adjust the heat for this recipe. I like med salsa. I will be making this often. Thanks for this delicious and easy to prepare recipe

I made this last night and ALL of my family was convinced they weren't going to like it. So they when I "plopped it" it on there plates the groans began. UNTIL they tasted it. Even my husband who claims he doesn't like ground beef couldn't wait to see how much wiould be left for his lunch!

It had just the right amout of spices, enough kick at the end of each bite. It was easy to make and didn't take long at all. 
I will definately make again!
Thank you so much for this recipe!!

This recipe gets a 4 for flavor and a 3 for texture.  Next time I make I will layer the meat mixture with either crushed tortilla chips, corn chips or corn tortilla shells.  The meat mixture is delicious, just is all the same texture.  I added some minced garlic to the meat while cooking.  I added black beans and green chilis under the delicious blanket of cheese.  I did add crushed tortilla chips on top but was thinking while making it that I should have layered it and I was right.  (Per our taste)  I'll bet this would make great enchilada filling! Thanks for the recipe!

This will be a new staple in our house! I omitted the chili sauce bc I didn't have it on hand. The tomatoes I used had "hot" peppers in them, which gave this dish a nice kick. I topped it off with sour cream. My whole family enjoyed this recipe...thanks! :)

I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes like another user said to and I will say that they were right! Also, I added two cloves of garlic. I had velveeta cheese so I used that instead. I also served with cilantro and a dollop of sour cream. Delicious! Would be good with tortillas too or chicken. I'm thinking add some spice and guacomole on the side and you won't have to go to a mexican restuaraunt for a good burrito anymore!

Delicious; will make again. Took an hour to simmer though, to cook the rice, so next time I would add cooked rice. Also added leftover corn and fresh sliced mushrooms. along with a little chicken broth.

Sorry to say this wasn't as good as I'd hoped. My rice didn't cook very well, even though I'd kept the dutch oven on med-low (the low end) without opening the lid.  It could have used more liquid as well.   I was hoping for a better result, but you can't win them all.  I suppose the leftovers might be good as an omelette filling.

It was very delicious tasting, BUT my rice didn't cook, so it was a bit crunchy. Next time I will either just cook the rice first or use minute rice.

Fantastic!!  Wouldn't change a thing unless you don't like it too spicy then you may lessen the chili sauce.  Great recipe and there were no leftovers.  My five year old is picky and gobbled it up (after I removed the tomatos). Thank you!

I've made this twice now.  As someone suggested, I left out the brown sugar.  I also prepared it in one sauce pan and I didn't bother to bake it.  We added the cheese at the table.  It's nourishing, doesn't take a lot of preparation or use more than one piece of cookware.  It will be my go-to for a hot meal without a lot of effort.  NOTE:  I prepared this a 3rd time and since I had no chili sauce, I substituted ketchup with no noticeable difference.  The big change was that I added a mounded TB of hot chili paste.  Good if you like it hot.

Perfect rice! I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes,  kept the rest of the ingredients as is, and it turned out great! I agree with keeping the lid on the rice while it simmers to ensure it cooks properly.

This was just OK for us, not great.  Nothing wrong in particular, it just did not ring our chimes here.  Seemed good but lacked pizzaz.  I was looking for a way to use left-over (excellent quality) ground beef; and it felt like that's just what I got.  With so many "bell-ringer" recipes on this site, I think I can do better!

yummmy!  this was sent to me as the "daily dish" just when I was trying to figure out what to do with a pound of ground beef.  I used a dutch oven like others have suggested I also made my own chili sauce using another allrecipes.com recipe, axed the extra sugar,  used brown rice and because my husband prefers it, mozzarella on top instead of cheddar.  He really liked it and in his own words he is the "plainest eater you will ever meet."

I followed the recipe exactly, but kept wondering if the rice would be done.  After I put it in the oven, I then read the reviews & was mad at myself for not reading them sooner like I usually do.  Saucepan needs to be covered to cook the rice!   Here's what I did at this point to get the rice done:  poured about 1/2 cup of water over it & covered with foil.  Baked it about 30 min & the rice was done.  Delicious!  Feels a little odd making a side dish with meat, however.  I may substitute the meat for black beans next time.  I would give this 5 stars if not for the error in the recipe.

This was a very simple economical recipe to suit all ages.  It was very sweet...probably because I used sweet chilli sauce which I would reduce to 1/4 cup next time.  Great for kids....add some grated zucchini and carrot, they would never notice.  This would freeze very well.  I had no trouble with the rice after reading several reviews....you must simmer this for 30 minutes....COVERED.....with the lid on the pan you're using and only check to make sure it's not sticking every 10 minutes.   I have no hesitation in recommending this recipe as it was a winner with this family of critics.

This is a fantastic, quick dinner. I followed the recipe to the t and would not change a thing. While this was very tasty, it was not the BEST thing I ever had, but will be making again for sure!  For a larger family, I would consider doubling this. we ate half of it for dinner (2 people) and had leftovers for lunch.

This was delicious!  I had to leave out the bell peppers because I didn't have any and I used a bit of fresh chilli (because that's all I had) but I think this is going to be a regular meal at our house.  My picky eaters thought it was great and have told me they want to eat this all the time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!! I used Sriracha hot chili sauce and a dash of cayanne pepper to give it a lot of kick because my husband and I love spicy food!  It is now my husband's new favorite dish!! He took leftovers to work and when I asked what he wanted for dinner the next night he said more Spanish "hot" rice!

A kid pleaser.  Kind of sweet for me.  Don't like all the pan switching, found it easier to do the browning and simmering in one pan, then use a different pan for the baking.

Cooked it exactly as recipe shows and rice was still crunchy and not done.  I think the word simmer is deceiving as it should be clearly boiled, covered, or whatever to fully cook the rice.  It had good flavor, but was not edible.

Maybe this is just me, but my rice didn't cook! I kept re-reading the recipe because my gut told me that the pot should be covered during the 30 minute simmer to let the rice steam; I didn't see that in the instructions and I decided to follow them exactly but the problem was towards the end of the 30 minutes, when I went to stir it for about the third time, all the liquid was evaporated and the rice was hard; UGH! I knew better! Anyway, I added a little more water and transferred it to the casserole dish and covered it with aluminum foil to salvage what I could; It was edible but definitely not what I knew it could be; I don't know if this was my fault or not but I felt that it should have been more explicit in the instructions; I could see how this would be a great recipe and I did substitute out the whole tomatoes for diced, fire roasted ones which added a lot of flavor; I'll try it again!!

I followed many of the previous suggestions (I used a 28 oz tin of tomatoes, I used Salsa instead of Chili Sauce, I didn't add the brown sugar, I also covered the pot with a lid which is not mentioned in the instructions but is a very useful tip). I also found that I didn't need the full 30 minutes of simmering on the stove. I did about 25 minutes but possibly could have done less. I think if I had done the full 30 it would have become dry. I also added a bit more cheese to the top; 1/2 cup didn't seem quite enough.   I really liked this and so did my husband (he had 2 servings!). I'll definitely make it again.

I was really excited about this recipe.  I was disappointed in the directions because it didn't say to cover the pot.  I got that from another reviewer.  Also, it needs more liquid-I added extra water and also small can tomato sauce and let it simmer about 45 minutes so rice could cook.  I am not a experienced cook , so I followed recipe closely without thinking!  Get rid of the brown sugar-too sweet!  Add chili powder or red pepper flakes because I think most people who are cooking Spanish rice prefer a spicier version!

This recipe brought out the real cook in me, which happens to always want to tweak things and try what delights my tongue at the moment. I didn't drain the beef fat because it's not a problem for me and it makes everything taste better. I kept the beef in the same skillet as I added the garlic, onions, mushrooms, bell pepper, carrot, tomatoes, and spices (cumin, cayenne pepper, Worcestershire). I waited to add the rice because I had some leftovers which was already cooked, but when I do this meal again I will cook the rice beforehand also because I'd rather not mess with everything just so the rice can be just right. Chile sauce isn't really needed if ya have chili flakes or anything that's hot like that. The brown sugar was a nice touch. I served this stuff with homemade guacamole, cilantro, fresh cut lettuce, and lime on crisp corn tortillas, also known as tostada. AMAZING! Oh, and one more thing: I add a touch of cinnamon to the meat in the beginning because I like it like that.

I made this for dinner and it was DELICIOUS!!!  I thought I had tomatoes but didn't so I just used pasta sauce and it worked just as well.  You just need to add a little more water to compensate.  I didn't have any chilies or chili sauce so I used chili powder and chipolte tobasco.  It was awesome.  Definitely making this again!!!

This was alright - it wasn't super flavorful, but it was quick, easy and satisfying.  I used red pepper in place of green, double the cheese that the recipe called for and no cilantro because we don't care for it.  It was much better the second day.

For the chile sauce, I used 1/4 c. sriracha and 1/4 c. salsa and doubled the onion and green pepper. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, but thought there was too much meat in the dish. Next time I'll either skip it or sub some veggie meat instead - or maybe even beans.  The cilantro is a must-have - it really makes the dish.  I put some of this into a flour tortilla and ate it like a burrito - really tasty.

To make this  a hearty meal in itself...Use brown rice (*not* instant), cook it separately in the juice from the tomatoes (Use Ro-tel diced tomatoes with chiles)+ enough water to make 1 1/2 cups. Reserve tomatoes. Add the onions + half the salt, bring to a boil, put a lid on it & let it simmer gently for 42 minutes (good time to use a glass lid. If you lift the lid, your rice might scorch). Add the bell pepper + 1 small chopped zucchini to the ground beef & brown it. Drain the grease & add  the cooked rice, remaining salt, reserved tomatoes + all other ingredients  (except cheese & cilantro). Heat thru, then dump in your casserole dish, top with cheese, bake & add cilantro. It does make a lot of dirty dishes, but it's delish & veggies are in it! The Ro-tel tomatoes make it spicy, but my kids love it!

This was a huge hit at my house! Took no effort to put together. I used all of the ingredients as written, and for the chili sauce I used Heinz brand. I doubled the cheese on top -- you can never have too much cheese :) Several folks mentioned that the rice didn't cook and that they had to add liquid, but I didn't find that to be the case at all as long as you COVER it for the 30 minutes of simmering. I did so in the same skillet that I browned the meat in (didn't transfer it to a pot, just used a skillet with a lid) then proceeded with the recipe as directed. 2 qt. casserole dish baked 15 mintues. LOVE IT. Putting it in normal rotation.

This was ok.  I used a can of rotel in place of the diced tomatoes and salsa in place of the chili sauce.  The biggest problem I had was that my rice was not cooked after the stated time, even though I used the type of rice called for.  I had to cook it almost twice as long and add a lot of additional water.  I think if I made this again, I would (1) cook instant rice separately and add it at the end of the simmering time and (2) not bother baking it - just add the cheese to the pot and serve.

I love this dish even though I have a hard time getting the rice to cook all the way-- maybe it's my rice? maybe my altitude?.  I've tried leaving the lid on the whole time as directed by other reviews, but no luck.  I will keep experimenting though, because it's a great meal!

Yum! Husband, toddler, and I all really enjoyed this one. I didn't have chile sauce handy so used 3/4 cup of salsa. I used basmati rice and it cooked just fine (I left it on the stove for 25 minutes and only stirred it twice). Even better the next day!

I have made this twice now. This recipe serves as a great start. I use minute brown rice and add it to the meat after it is cooked. I use garlic powder, taco sauce, a lot more cumin and sharp cheddar.I use two cans of Rotel instead of the salsa. I put the whole pan in the oven for a quick and one pan meal.

very simple and hearty meal. I added cayenne pepper for a little extra spice and I also used a dutch oven to dirty less pans. I browned the meat, added the rest of the ingredients to simmer then popped it in the oven to bake! I will definitely make this again.

My family was not all that impressed with this recipe.  It tasted more like hamburger helper with a twist.  I think this recipe would have been better without the chili sauce.

This was pretty tasty.  The rice was a problem for me too, so just make sure to check the cook time on your rice beforehand.  The long grain brown stuff I used needed an hour to cook, so I clearly didn't plan ahead right!  Next time I'll use instant rice or precook it some.

Meh.  aliann11 summed up my opinion of this dish: --- Good base ingredients...but no big whoop in the flavor/presentation department...maybe it's better as a chip dip... --- It was tasty, but not very inspiring.

My boyfriend and I really liked this. I followed other's suggestions and used: salsa (instead of chili sauce) sour cream (for topping) chili powder (1/2 t)  I also added: frozen mixed vegetables (1/2 c.) fresh spinach (1/4 cup) BBQ sauce (1 T) soy sauch (1 t)  It was delicious!

Fantastic! Instead of ground beef I used leftover Shrimp from this recipe "Chipolte Shrimp Tacos" found on this site. I omitted bell pepper but added chopped black olives. I went a little heavier on the cheese & cumin. Would absolutely make again.

This recipe was a hit at my house.  It was very easy to make and tasted great.  I will be making again. 
Update: made a second time and was too sweet, so added some salsa to get rid of the sweetness, don't know that I would make again.

I thought this was very good. Husband did as well.  However, 7 year old and 3 year old didn't really like.   Possibly because all the foods were mixed together?   I used Salsa instead of chile sauce and thought it was very good.   Kid rating was low.

Very good starting place for a simple meal. I didn't have chile sauce, so I substituted salsa, but would like to try chile next time. Next time I will also cut the salt a little, add some beans to up the health factor, and probably increase the rice simply since I prefer a higher rice to meat ratio. We served it with salsa and sour cream and the kids ate it very well also.

Loved this. It is nothing gourmet, but comfort food. I used 1 cup of rice, a 19 oz can of tomatoes because that's what I had and a 19 oz can of water to account for the extra rice. I didn't add the brown sugar as I tasted it and liked the taste without.

Delicious and flavorful!  Added some minced garlic and increased rice to 1 cup (used brown rice also).  Using brown rice I had to simmer the concoction a bit longer, but it was worth it.  I used cheddar and some pepper jack cheese I had on hand for the top.  New favorite here! Fresh tasty goodness :)

I've had better from a box of Hamburger Helper! This was bland. I tasted before putting in oven and had to add chili powder, garlic, extra cumin and diced chiles before it had any real flavor. it also needed about a cup more rice. No one really cared for it. It wasn't disgusting just not a dinner meal for me, maybe as a side. It reminds me of the burrito filling at Taco Bell.

Made this for Memorial BBQ, was really good.  I did substitute the chile suace for Salsa that's the only change I made.  Also doubled the recipe.  Everyone really enjoyed this.  This is very versatile you can add more ingredients. Maybe next time I will add black beans, etc.  Will make again.

This is one of the Spanish Rice recipes.  My DH loves spanish rice, not so much me.  I am always looking for one he likes. This is it!  I used salsa instead of the chili sauce.  I think I may sprinkle some green onions on top next time.

this was really tasty.  After reading some of the woes about the rice, I cooked rice separately as I have a wonderful filling for green peppers that is similar to this and just stirred rice into rest of mixture before putting in casserole.  I also substituted salsa for chile sauce as other suggested.  Great comfort food!

Very good. I didn't have enough chile sauce, so I used tomato sauce to make up the rest. I also used a can of Rotel to add some spice and used just a pinch of brown sugar. Great topped with a dollop of sour cream. Loved it, thank you! :)

I've made this quite a few times now, and it's always turned out well. It's even better the next day. I've found that by omitting the cumin, cilantro and brown sugar works best for my tastes, but if you use brown sugar I advise using less than called for. This applies to chile sauce as well. Otherwise, this recipe makes a great meal.

GREAT flavors! My mom made something very similar when I was a kid and I've been looking for a recipe like this for years :-) I took the advice of others and browned the beef then cooked the rice, etc in the same large pan. I also put the cheese on without baking...saving a step just means eating sooner ;-)

My family and I really enjoyed this.  I'm always hunting for inexpensive ingredients that are staples, which I just happen to have in the house.  Well, I didn't have the chili sauce so I took another reviewers suggestion of using salsa and adding chili powder( which worked fine).  I also pre-cooked the rice (which if you do, make sure you delete the cup of water from the recipe later).  It was a good and easy meal.  Served it with cornbread.

This recipe was great, I really enjoyed it and so did my bf. I made some changes from the suggestions of others and some of my own. I did not use chili sauce, I used an extra thing of salsa (pace picante) and chili powder. I used diced tomatoes with the chilis in them. I sauteed onions and garlic a bit and then added a can of hot jalapenos when cooking my beef along with some salt and pepper and chili powder to give the meat its own flavor from the beginning. I took others advice and added about an extra 1/4 cup of water and did not lift up the lid on the pan for the entire 30 minutes and the rice was cooked perfectly. I also only used one pan, i cooked the beef and then added everything in and omitted the baking, just mixed the cilantro and cheese in at the end. Anyway, It was very flavorful and easy to make. Great recipe!

I thought this was a good, quick weekday meal.  I browned the meat, then drained it.  I sauteed the onion and pepper before adding all ingredients.  I added a teaspoon of chili powder.  To avoid the rice being undercooked, I simmered the pot with the lid on for the 30 minutes.  Next time I would use reviewer suggestions and add a can of rinsed beans, and I would double the cumin.  Served with a salad and everyone enjoyed it.

This was good, and I will definitely make it again, but with some modifications. Add some chili powder to give it a little kick, and next time I'll probably add some jalapenos to spice it up. Don't skimp on the cumin, or the water. I might use beef broth next time, to add an extra touch.

I have make this several times now.  My family loves this recipe. This is very easy to make and really delicious! I follow the recipe exactly, except I don't always add the green pepper. I also add a can of black beans. I do not bake it in the oven , I don't want it to be too dry. So I just add the cheese at the end and cover it for another 5 minutes until the cheese has melted. Will be making this tonight family requested it.

This had all the makings of a great meal. too bad it wasn't. I simmered this for 45 min and added additional water as need until the rice was cooked through. I baked this for 20 min and let it stand for 10 before serving it up. The rice still ended up a little crunchy and it was distracting and not so pleasant. It could have been more clear on the ingredients as to chili sauce, as I used a little less than 1/3 c sriracha chile sauce and this was so hot we had to add quite a bit of sour cream to make it palatable, it was just too spicy. And we love/are used to spicy foods. Thank goodness I didn't use the full half cup! This wasn't too bad overall in spite of everything and just wasn't to our tastes even if I fixed the errors, so thanks anyway.

Not a bad weeknight meal.  I never have chili sauce on hand so I just used salsa as several other reviewers did.  I found that one can of tomatoes, one cup of water, and half a cup of salsa was the perfect amount of moisture for the 3/4 cup of rice.  I served it with "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" (yum!).  This was an easy, hearty, flavorful meal that is sure to be repeated in our house.

Very disappointing.  The problem was the flavor of the chile sauce - it just didn't seem to work well.  I would suggest using salsa instead.

This recipe was too sweet and even after adding additional water, the rice didn't cook all the way. We had to add extra spice to make it edible, and then we did eat most of it.

I believe that we followed the recipe exactly and had two sets of eyes to make sure that happened.

Pretty good, but I thought it was too sweet. I think I'll try it again using salsa rather than chile sauce as some reviewers have done and omitting the sugar.

We really liked this. I made a few minor adjustments to suit us:
I drained, rinsed and chopped the tomatoes, added 1/2 cup chicken stock to replace the tomato liquid.
Sauteed the onion and bell pepper for about five minutes, and put some crushed tortilla chips I had on hand in the bottom of the casserole dish before I put in the meat mixture.
This was a very easy and tasty dish. I can see adding some Mexican squash to it or maybe some beans or corn if I'm in the mood.

Great recipe and very easy to make.  I didn't have any chile sauce on hand, but used a little under a 1/4 cup of Texas Pete, and it still turned out great.  The cilantro garnish really does make the dish.  Will definitely make again, thanks for sharing!

I wish I could actually give a 4 & 1/2 stars!  This was quite tasty.  I substituted ground beef w/ ground turkey.  I also didn't have chile sauce, so I used salsa instead.  Plus I added a lot more fiesta blend cheese on top, maybe 1 1/2 cups.

This was really good and even better the second day. It was a tad sweet for me, and next time I'll add some garlic and less of the brown sugar. It was filling and great with a salad.

We really liked this dish.  It was quick and easy.  I didn't add the brown sugar, but used a whole jar of chili sauce.  Oh, and used ground turkey, but couldn't tell the difference!  Otherwise, followed just as written.  Thanks for the recipe!

After reading other reviews, I made the following changes:  used 28oz can crushed tomatoes and 3/4 cup water, 1/2 cup salsa instead of chile sauce, omitted brown sugar, and omitted cilantro.  I browned the onion & ground beef together then added the other ingredients to the same pot.  I simmered covered for 30 minutes per recipe and my rice was cooked.  I ate it with tortilla chips and topped with salsa and sour cream.  I enjoyed it, but I think next time I will try substituting black beans for the beef and serving it as a side dish rather than the main dish.

We tried this for the first time tonight.  It was wonderful.  I added two cloves of garlic, (I always use garlic), and I replaced the water with low sodium beef broth. Everyone loved it. By the way, for five people I doubled the recipe.  I'm glad I did.

I think this is a great basic recipe. My family likes our casseroles bold and spicy, so I did tweak it a little by increasing the green pepper to 1/2 cup, increasing the ground cumin to 3/4 tsp, adding 1/8 tsp garlic powder, adding 1 tsp chili powder, adding 1/8 tsp ground red pepper and increasing the shredded cheddar to 1 cup. Also, I substituted lean ground turkey for the ground beef. Bringing the mixture to a boil, and then letting it simmer at medium-low heat for about 30 minutes (with 2 or 3 stirrings) created perfectly cooked rice. The extra spices I added gave the casserole some "kick". Some reviewers commented that the recipe was too sweet, but we found it to be just right. I served the cilantro on the side, and it also tasted great with a dollop of sour cream on top. Thanks for a great basic recipe.

I have a hungry husband and two hungry toddlers beside myself.  We need to double the recipe next time.  I also didn't have chile sauce, but I did have tomato sauce, I used that instead and it still came out great.  Better for my 2 year old as he doesn't like spicy things.  So we just added our own hot sauce to our own portions.  Great recipe, on the menu for next week already!!  Also a great and different way to use ground beef.

This was ok. Kind of bland. I would really need to up the spices (cumin, chili powder, red pepper) if I made this again.

This is delicious.

I don't use the brown sugar, however - chili sauce is sweet enough as it is (and as another reviewer indicated, chili sauce is very close to ketchup in its content).

I also don't bother with the green bell pepper since, well, I hate green bell pepper.

Other than that, I cook PRETTY much as the recipe states - but when I put a lid on the whole shebang including the rice and cook for 30 minutes, I don't remove the lid AT ALL.  I just wait for it to boil, then put the heat on simmer and wait.  Cooking rice requires pressure and steam so removing the lid is counterproductive, in my opinion.

Otherwise, this is a nice spanish rice recipe with a bit of an added kick.  It's currently one of my faves and I make it about once every other week - it lasts quite a while and can be a main dish or a side dish.  

One could easily sub salsa for the chili sauce, although it will not have the same flavor (would still be really tasty though, I bet).  One could also sub brown rice for the white rice - but if so, add a bit more water and cook longer (brown rice takes longer to cook).

Glad I found this recipe!  Not something I would have ordinarily tried.

This was really delicious! We loved it! I did follow the advice of others and added 2 cans of tomatoes with chiles. I also used a taco seasoning packet to add a little flavor to the ground beef. I will definitely make this again. Thanks.

I made this exactly as written, except after it cooked awhile on the stove, I realized the rice wasn't going to be cooked all the way.  At this point, I added another half cup of water, put a lid on it and let it cook an extra 15 minutes or so.  Then I baked it as directed.  It is pure comfort food.  Very good.

This wasn’t a winner in my family. My first thought was I added all those ingredients and there wasn’t a lot of flavor. The dish was good, but it wasn’t great. No one asked me to make it again, so I probably won’t.

This has become one of our favorite recipes!  We prefer to use ground pork.  And we haven't found chile sauce (actually haven't searched much); we use two jalapeno peppers instead.  And then we add hot sauce or dried pepper seasonings, such as chili powder, to our individual plates.  Oh, and neither of us are cilantro fans so we omit that.

I've tried this several times.  I've followed the recipe exactly, made alterations suggested in other posts, made my own alterations...we just don't care for it much.  DH said it was fine & he'd eat it again but wouldn't ask for it.  I agreed with him.  I've since deleted it from my saved recipes.

This is one of our favorite recipes.  Some of my variations - I omit the cilantro.  If I don't have chile sauce, I use ketchup & chili powder.  I sometimes add a can of corn or black beans.  I get my 3 year old picky eater to eat it in a tortilla.  This is really quick if I have the meat already browned and in the freezer.

Half the family liked it and the other half refused to even try it.  I thought it was good but could use a little more spice.  Maybe a little to much tomatoey.

This make a good pot luck dish. Noticing some of the other reviews about the rice not getting done, I decided to cook the rice in the water, tomato mix without adding the meat until the rice was near done. I used one can of beef broth also so it would not seem so dry. I added a dash of cayenne pepper for some heat. I liked the hot/slightly sweet flavor. The three dishes to cook in is a lot for a one dish meal. But it is worth the extra washing.

This recipe was very good and tasty. I used 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes (as per other reviewer's suggestions) My rice mixture had to be cooked much lonegr than the allotted time.  I would recommend checking your rice before you bake it in the oven to avoid the rice being under cooked.  The flavor was perfect for my family but if you want to spice it up you could add red pepper flakes and chili powder.

Too sweet.  Trying using something else beside the chile sauce and get rid of the brown sugar and it might be OK.  My husband thought it was OK.

My husband loves spanish rice so i tried this recipe tonight. It was very easy to make,(could easily be made ahead of time). Excellent flavor. Pretty presentation. I used 28 0z can of tomatoes, a whole large green pepper just because we like green peppers. Also used chili powder instead of cumin and salsa instead of chili sauce. I'd make this again, my husband ate seconds!!

This recipe was simple and easy to make.  Not having chili sauce I just added a couple of our favorite spices to the mix  I also used crushed tomatoes in tomato puree (28 oz ) instead of the canned tomatoes (my kids don't like to see their tomatoes - lol).  My family did enjoy this recipe and will be making it again, but the overall rating I gave it a four since I felt it was not a "wow" recipe.  Shredded chicken/beef would make a nicer alternative.  Adding green chili or jalapenos depending on your “hot” level would make a splendid addition.

Since some people said it turned out a bit dry I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes. This was a good recipe. For a "one dish" meal it sure does dirty a lot of dishes though! The baked cheese makes it really good, so don't skip baking it in the oven. I didn't have cilantro. I may try this recipe again without the brown sugar. I may also substitute shredded chicken for the ground beef for something different. This meal would also be good wrapped in tortillas.

This is a very good dish and is a keeper.  Only change made in recipe was a tad of cayenne to give it an extra "zip".
Easy and quick to prepare.  After sauteing meat, onions and bell pepper, added rest of ingredients and placed in oven covered for about 35 minutes.  Then added cheese and served- Yum Yum

Made this for dinner last night. Big hit with my husband and I. It's a keeper. Did add a little bit more water per other reviews and few dashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce. Yum.

Made a few changes.  Used brown rice instead of white, 10 oz can Rotel tomatoes and green chiles instead of canned tomatoes, omitted the brown sugar, added chipotle and ancho chile powders and added cubed Velveeta.  Cooked on the stove in a dutch oven until most the liquid was evaporated. Did not bake in oven and did not top with cheese.  Served in a low carb whole wheat tortilla.  Spicy and delicious!

This was awesome! I made a few adjustments. I used 1/2lb ground beef and 1/2lb ground sausage. I replaced the green pepper with green onion. I didn't have chili sauce, so I added a few dashes of hot sauce. Also, I substituted Salsa for the tomatos and finally, I added a 1/2-cup of frozen corn. This was so good! And so easy! Also, if you scale the servings it makes the perfect amount!

Way too sweet for our taste.  We left out the meat to use as a side dish.  We will keep looking for a better more flavorful recipe.

This was tasty and easy to make but can't say that I would call it a favorite. My husband liked it. I used it as a main course dinner and just added a veggie on the side. Good when your in a hurry to make ahead of time.

Great Spanish Rice recipe.  I used low fat finely grated cheddar cheese to help keep down the saturated fat.

Mmmm, this was really yummy.  I've made it twice now.  I did not use the sugar, tho... I haven't had a chance to buy brown sugar since moving.  I did add some extra spices like oregano and some seasoning salt to the meat.  It is good, thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe was good, but not outstanding.  My kids wouldn't eat it because it was too spicy, and the tomatoes and green peppers did not look good to them.  My husband thought it was great.

A very tasty and easy casserole.  This would be great for a buffet as this holds together real well.  I wouldn't change a thing.  My husband and I had it for dinner and both agreed it was a "keeper" and we'd definitely make this again.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. My kids also didn't like the peppers or the spice and the recipe makes way too much. It is easy, but nothing exciting.

This was a good but not great everyday family meal.  Per others suggestions I used canned tomatoes with green chilies, added garlic and left out the brown sugar.  It was still strangely sweet from the chile sauce.  I've never had Mexican or Spanish food that was that sweet.  It was ok, my kids didn't like the peppers and other "things" in it.  I probably wouldn't make it again.

The boys in the hall thought this one was great!  The table was silent which means there's nothing but some good eatin going on.  It's even good cold (which we all tried since our dinner got cooled off when we went out for a call).  Try it with some Louisiana hot sauce on top - excellent!

What a yummy recipe.  My husband (who is not a casserole person) really enjoyed this dish. I added a cooked package of corn niblets to the rest of the dish before putting it in the oven and cut the oven time down to 5 minutes.

This was fantastic!  My husband doesn't like cheese very much so I only used a little bit.  Also, I added the cilantro in the mixture along with some minced garlic to jazz it up a bit.  This is also pretty low fat so a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing it!!!

I made this without the ground beef, and it was still excellent!  The rice was very flavorful, tasted even better the next day!  Great side dish! I will try it next time as a main dish with the ground beef.

I LOVED this dish!  I was so excited to find this recipe because I'd had it years ago at a Memorial Day picnic and loved it then.  My husband said to him it was more of a side dish than a main course and I said "Can you say CASSEROLE?!"  :-)

This was a very flavorful Spanish rice.  I decided to make it in my electric skillet for ease of preparation.  This worked out beautifully except that I had to add quite a bit more liquid.  Next time I will follow the recipe completely.  It was great with sour cream.  My cilantro never made it home from the store, but I'm sure it would have made it even better.  Thanks for a yummy dinner.

This is indeed a very yummy recipe...wonderful comfort food.  For once I'm looking forward to leftovers.    Thank you, Melodie!
(Made mine with home-canned tomato sauce instead of canned tomatoes and water.)

My husband does NOT eat casseroles.  He single handedly polished off 2/3rds of this recipe in less than half a day!!!  Easy, delicious, and the aromas had my family coming into the kitchen to guess what it was!  TERRIFIC!!!  Thanks!

We all liked it.  Used it to supplement as a soft taco filling.  My  changes were to cook everything in the same pan.  I cooked the onion with the beef which was so lean, I didn't need to drain any grease.   I added all remaining ingredients to the pan with just a bit more water and put a lid on the pan cooking almost 40 mins without removing the lid or stirring ( to make sure rice cooked). The only ingredient changes I made  were some red and yellow pepper for the green as it was what I had and I used petite diced canned tomatoes. I did by mistake add 3/4 c. chile sauce as I read the recipe wrong.  It didn't hurt it, and in fact I might just add the whole bottle next time because there wasn't much left in it. Once it had cooked on the stove top,  I removed the lid, stirred it and sprinkled cheese on top then placed the pan in the oven for 10 mins.  My husband commented later he really liked it.  And he had tried to talk me out of making it!

It was really good. I made a couple substitutions based on what was in my cabinet. I used fire roasted tomatoes with garlic and green chile enchilada sauce.

I also used my Instant Pot to brown the meat along with the onions , then pressure cooked everything for 15 minutes. 

it came out really well.

Always looking for new recipes for ground beef.  Saw this recipe and it looked delicious.  Went to make it and realized I didn’t have everything I needed. So I improvised and it really turned out great. I used a large can of tomato sauce and 1 can rotel tomatoes and the cup of water, 1 teas. cumin and chili powder, 3 garlic cloves and the onion. Browned the beef with the onion and garlic and salt and pepper.  The rice was done in 30 minutes cooked on medium low. Used shredded Mexican cheese covered the pan and cooked on the stove till cheese melted. Served with chopped cilantro, sour cream and Franks hot sauce. Can’t figure out why you need so many pans and place in the oven. Husband loved it.

Hubby thought it was ok, I thought it was good.  I used a 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce instead of tomatoes, a can of rotelle that I put in blender, and some chili powder because I had no chili sauce.

I love this recipe and will definitely make this again! I subbed salsa for chili sauce because I didn’t want the heat and it was great. I also used turkey sausage because I had it on hand but next time I will try with hamburger meat. Definitely a keeper!

I've been making this recipe for about 45 years.  Can't remember where I found the recipe but I've always had people requesting this anytime there's a potluck.  So easy and so good!  Thanks for reprinting it.  Forgot to mention - I always use Mexican style stewed tomatoes.

Agree with others that changes make this a much better recipe. I cooked the meat with garlic and 2 T. taco seasoning. Added salsa and tomato sauce. Left out brown sugar, reduced rice to 1/2 cup. Added water only when it seemed to need it. Used the same pan for both browning meat and creating casserole. Despite having less rice, it took more like an hour (on low) to get the rice cooked well enough to eat. But it was worth it in the end! Next time I might add corn too. There's a lot you can do with this dish.

It was yummy.  Like other reviews state, don't stir when cooking rice.  Also, I thought it was too salty so I'd omit the tspn of salt next time.

This recipe is aaaaaamazing!!  My whole family loves it and now that the kids are grown, they are making it in their homes.  The only tweak I have is doubling the tomatoes.  I've added a bit of water too depending on how the rice cooks up...we don't like it dry.  I serve it topped w sour cream.  Yum!

Tonight,  I made it with chicken (boneless breast, diced very small) per hubby's request.  It's just as delicious!  This has become a family recipe.  Thank you!

I didn't have chili sauce so I used a little hot sauce  and added garlic. Very tasty dish.

This is my favorite, fast spanish rice. I use the basics of the recipe  but omit the brown sugar and  use chicken broth instead of water. The liquid to rice ratio is perfect but you do need to cover the dish while simmering. You can substitute just about any seasons depending on your mood. I've also added a bay leaf and used chili powder instead of cumin. Sometimes I'll put a little Adobo in it as well. 

Well done Melodie!

This is super delicious, it loses something to reheating (I tried to reheat it on the stovetop  with the help of steam) but right out of the over it's really good.

I love the flavor but SO disappointed that the rice didn’t cook . Used Boca veggie crumbles instead of hamburger but that shouldn’t have had an affect . Cooked at medium for 50 minutes but still had crunchie rice . Was thinking next time I’d cook rice first , but am concerned that when I then simmer , it won’t think . Maybe leave out the water if rice already cooked ?

Came out excellent. Perfect for taking to a gathering. Made it for the first time going to a pot luck. Doubled the recipe and there was very little left, several people asked me for the recipe. If I were making it for just me I would add a little more spice to it but it was perfect for a crowd.

Absolutely delish.
I replaced the can of tomatoes (my kiddo won't eat them) with a bottle of pasta sauce, and did not add the chile sauce.
Also did not have Worcestershire Sauce, so I added a couple of teaspoons of bovril... and coriander instead of cumin.

I would like to still try the recipe as is, but the altered version I will certainly do again.

My usually picky child had two full helpings and wanted it cold in her lunchbox the next day.

Yum! This made a fantastic base for stuffed bell peppers! Due to sodium concerns, I decreased the sweet Chile sauce to 1/4 cup, but it still turned out with a delicious, unique flavor!

I liked it very much.  Did not think the brown sugar was too much.  I usually add a little sugar when coking with tomato products.

This was good, but I did make several changes based on other reviews. Used salsa instead of chili sauce and added chopped green chiles. Made it sort of Mexican instead of Spanish. Omited the brown sugar.

I will make this again. I had to substitute the red sauce with a different red chile sauce and modify that to bring the sharp taste that red sauce has, but it worked great and no one was the wiser. Everybody liked it and we want it again!

I adapted this for my Instant Pot by upping the rice to a heaping cup, which I rinsed first.  I also used more peppers (3 mini colored peppers and one jalapeno.) I also added two cloves of crushed garlic. Saute the meat in your pot, then add the vegetables and saute.  Then add the spices.  I cut the sugar by half and added 1/2 tsp black pepper.  Then top with the rinsed rice and the other wet ingredients.  Cook on the rice setting  and let pressure release manually, stirring to combine afterwards. I let the pot sit on warm for 30 min and it came out perfect.  I topped with shredded Mexican cheese blend and chopped cilantro.  No need to put in the oven.  Great quick meal! The flavor was excellent!  Will definitely make it again.

Made as advertised and found it to be “ho hum”. Maybe more spices would help. Didn’t care for the cheese on top. If I make it again I’ll add tomato sauce and more seasonings. A new recipe is always an adventure for me and I try to make mental notes as to how I’d do it the next time. Thanks.

The recipe was easy to follow, but a little too sweet for my taste.  I followed the recipe exactly.  If I were to fix again, I would probably use a different chili sauce and/or leave out the brown sugar.

Very good. Made it just like it said. Reminded me of a dish my Mom use to make but she had kidney beans in hers. I'll add  hot peppers the next time I make it, we like hot and spicy.

My family really enjoyed this entree. I used 93% lean ground beef and replaced the full fat cheddar with fat free.  I also omitted the brown sugar. It was delicious, easy to prepare and I will definitely make this again! Worth a try!

We really liked this and will make it again. I don’t like things real hot so I reduce the chili powder by half and I use beef stock instead of water.  I used it for wraps, I added refried  beans, salsa and sour cream. Delicious!

Like others stated, it is a tad on the sweet side. Personally I would omit the brown sugar, however, my husband liked it as is. I also agree with others in that it’s totally unnecessary to use all those pans. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 4 qt cast iron pan and popped it in a hot, but turned off, oven just long enough to melt the cheese. I also would have liked if it had more rice. Altogether it’s a good recipe that can be tweaked to ones liking.

This recipe is not bad if you like sweet Spanish rice. I made it exactly like the recipe stated and I can't complain because it was easy to make (time consuming though) and the family liked it.  The next time I make it I will need to take the 'sweet' out of it, I personally would rather have a savory Spanish rice.

The flavor was good, although you could add a number of spices or herbs to make it your own. My problem was that the rice didn't get cooked in the allotted time. I have had little success for recipes calling for uncooked rice, and this was no exception. To make it again, I would either pre-cook the rice or add 1/2 cup water and bake it for 45 minutes. I would add the cheese then, for the last 15 minutes of baking.

This is a staple at our house! We hardly ever have leftovers because we always go back for seconds. We like it as is but we prefer to add Cajun sausage for flavor, texture, and more meat. Our grocery store was out of Chile sauce so we always substitute chile sauce for La Costeña medium chipotle sauce (it looks like red enchilada sauce).

Decent dish. A touch on the mild side, so you may want to add your own spices as well. The portion size was a bit smaller than expected, so you may want to double up on some ingrediants if you are planning on feeding a family with this. Didn't regret making it, will probably make again with a little modification.

I made this with pre-cooked chicken.  It made excellent enchilada filling.  I will cook the rice first next time with the tomato sauce, otherwise it gets mushy and chicken shreds to make a well - filling.  I admit I used a pre-made taco seasoning too, not the seasonings in recipe.

Very good, low key addicting, only needs a small tweak and that would be to add garlic

I also used red enchilada sauce instead of chili sauce to make it less spicy for my toddler

I tweaked it with ingredients I had on hand. I used Cacique Beef Chorizo and leftover rice with cheese. Amazingly great. Delicious! Of course I did the chorizo just like ground beef and fried it and drained the excess grease. Still had lots of flavor

This was so tasty! I made a few changes: Used ground Turkey, added garlic and broccoli with the onion and pepper. Spiced it up with oregano, basil, garlic powder and chili pepper. Instead of brown sugar I used sweet chili sauce. Used a larger can of tomatoes. It was done cooking in 30 minutes. Scooped 1/2 in casserole dish, added feta cheese and parmesan cheese, then scooped the rest of it on top. Topped with more parmesan and then cheddar cheese. Cut up a few slices of fresh tomato for the top. Sprinkled oregano on top and baked for about 15 minutes. Absolutely delicious and hubby loved it!  
Thanks for the idea!

Used ground turkey in place of the lean ground beef.  Used a little more onion since using ground turkey.  1/2 cup of chili sauce was a little to spicy.  Next time will try 1/4 cup.  I also used a chili sauce with garlic.

I made this tonight and the only change I did to the recipe is that I added a little onion powder and garlic powder and used tomatoes with garlic and onion in the can. I also didn't add the brown sugar and sprinkled a little chili powder in it. Delicious!

I followed the recipe and it was  a little too hot for me.  My husband loved it though.  I would reduce the chili sauce a little if you don't like things too hot but I will definitely make this again it was great.

yummy!  a hit with the family.  

I'm trying to eat a little more anti-inflammatory, so used Ancient Grains instead of rice..   Perfect!  

There's also lots of opportunity for additions to the veggies, so it's a great recipe for using up those fresh veggies you just haven't had time to use!

Definitely a new family keeper.  Very easy to make and quite delicious.  Didn't have chili sauce so used salsa...also Mexican stewed tomatoes.  Added a bit more water initially...as well as when reheating the leftovers.  I may reduce the beef to 3/4 of a pound next time.  It did seem a bit meat heavy (although not to my husband!).

I used picante sauce instead of chili sauce because I don't have chili sauce, and I use brown rice instead of white rice for it's better nutritional value.  I made this in my instant pot with excellent results. It was sweeter than I prefer.  Next time I will add some hot sauce to it to make it more to my preference, but overall it was a very good recipe.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing it!

This recipe is just delicious.  I used chile sauce as called for, rather than salsa as many others did.  I think it would be good either way.   Next time I think I may add black beans and corn.  It's very versatile, and perfect for a hearty, comforting meal.

Made it as written.  My husband loved it.  I thought it was good but not exceptional.  Thought it was better when I dug out some tortilla shells to have on the side.  Also had to cook much longer to get the rice done.

I made this last night  and since it was a Friday during lent I left out the ground beef.  It was quite good and I can only imagine how much better it would be with beef.

I was really disappointed. I followed this recipe to a T and the instructions should have said to cover the rice. After about an hour and a half of work and cooking, the rice was still not cooked. Tried to salvage it by adding more water and cooking it on the stove but it just turned to mush. Literally ruined my night, instructions need to be more specific.

Nothing special, but pretty good. I did it all in one skillet, because why not. Used chiles in adobo sauce instead of chile sauce. I overdid it a little -- don't use too much! And chicken stock instead of water. I had to use a lot more liquid because of the surface area of the pan. And it's in obvious need of a bit of sour cream to finish it off!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. We have a 2 year old and it wasn't even too spicey for her which was really nice...I think to stretch things a little further I may double the rice amounts next time, we used it as a main course (with a salad on the side) and it was perfect but if you are on a budget could definitely feed more people with more rice. My husband suggested added chopped spinach or even mushrooms would be good too.

Quick recipe - perfect for a work night meal. Following many reviews, I used just one pan on the stove and covered it rather than stirring during simmering.  The rice was fine.  It does need some additional spices, taste it as you cook!

Made this last night. Was a hit. Used less salt per other reviews, and for us, this needed a little more. I doubled the recipe, but not the salt. Next time I will use more. I added corn and olives to dish, since husband loves these two things in casseroles. The rice cooked well in it, but burned slightly on bottom. Still tasted great! We should have used more cheese. I just eyeballed it, and it wasn't quite enough. But my fault. We have leftovers for tonight, and I am looking forward to them. Will make again. Very easy and pretty fast. Thanks!

THIS WAS SOOO GOOD!!! I DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND IT WAS PERFECT, NO EXTRA SEASONINGS OR NOTHING. THE ONLY THING I WOULD'VE LEFT THE WATER AT 1 CUP INSTEAD OF 2 AND CAUSE IT WAS A LITTLE WET AND ALSO I DON'T CARE FOR CILANTRO SO I USED SCALLIONS INSTEAD. ALSO I USED PARBOILED RICE. I ACTUALLY LEFT THE LID OFF AND WHEN I PLACED IT IN THE OVEN, THE RICE WAS PERFECTLY COOKED. I LIKE THIS RECIPE CAUSE IT CAN BE TWEAKED. NEXT TIME ILL ADD SOME GREEN OLIVES AND SHRIMP!

I do not make changes to a recipe the first time I make it.  The only thing I didn't have was the cilantro and I wouldn't have used it anyway and did use brown rice instead of white because I think it is more nutritious.    Because of this, I didn't add the vegetables until the rice had cooked a half hour, then I added the vegetables and cooked an additional 20 minutes.   I was a bit nervous about adding the brown sugar, but it definitely didn't hurt the recipe because we loved this. I added the cheese adn put it into the oven. My husband said, "this is a keeper" and I agreed.  We  tried not to eat the whole recipe ourselves.  Delicious!

Family asked me to remember everything I did for this recipe because it  was perfect. High compliment! Like many I had to add water& simmer longer for rice to get done but it did.  Used beef boullion instead of rice. Used crushed tomatoes, no Worcestershire, because I forgot! I added same amount of smoked paprika as the cumin. I added about 1/2 c mango chipotle dressing for more liquid& about 2/3-3/4 c of the chile sauce. A lot of the recipe I did follow but made it our favorite as well.

Spices were spot on.  Very good recipe.  Next time, might swap black beans for meat to make it vegan.  Used red peppers instead of green (too hard to digest) added a cup of frozen corn and used instant brown rice because that's what we had.  When it was finished, decided it didn't need the cheese and we were right.  Definitely a keeper.

I could not find chile sauce so I used enchilada. It was good, but nothing overly fantastic. I used quinoa instead of rice and had a really hard time getting it to cook. Next time I'll have to cook it separately and adjust the sauce accordingly. I just realized I forgot the cilantro. That would have improved the taste.

Used 1.5kg of pork mince, fresh Italian  parsley instead of cilantro. 2 Jalapeno chillies, and 2 cloves of garlic. Forget the sugar as it's not needed (too sweet). Next time I will add a bit of red wine to sharpen the taste. Great recipe but I simply added a twist.

A big hit with the men in my household. I'm not a fan of coriander so used green onions instead.
Also, wasn't paying attention,  and bought 'masala'  chili sauce in error  - wowser, it was spicy.
Freezes well.

Hubby and I loved this dish!  Although I did make a few changes.  Hubby doesn't care for Green "Bells" so I used Red and Yellow  Peppers.  Worked great!  I also used Chicken broth in stead of water.  Really Good!  This Dish is a "Keeper".

I didn't have chili sauce, so used about a cup and a half of cherry tomatoes that needed to be used up. It was quite good! I just browned the meat in a dutch oven so I used one pot. It did take longer to cook the rice, most likely because I kept lifting the lid to stir. I can see this would be a neat recipe to vary, depending on what ingredients you have in the fridge. Will be a staple as it's easy.

Great basic recipe, I did alter it to keep a more mexican flavor profile.  So I replaced chili sauce with salsa, and replaced diced tomatoes with rotel and changed spices to my own mexican spice mix .  I left out the brown sugar and worcestershire sauce.  I also added 1 large grated zucchinni  to up the nutritional value.  Finally I topped each serving with fresh cilantro.  I agree with another reviewer that the rice will be done if you leave the pot lid closed  during stove top  cooking time.

Pretty good recipe that I used to make more of a deconstructed stuffed peppers.  I made the dish all in 1 pot as well (did not use the oven at all) I didn't have chili sauce,   so I left it out, chose not to use brown sugar, and added 2 T tomato paste, Spanish smoked paprika (Penzey's), and garlic powder. I also increased the black pepper to 1/2-1 tsp. I also increased the chopped green peppers to 3 full peppers. Overall I found it to be a bit bland (but stuffed peppers usually are), but it was a great start, the family liked it, and I'd make the recipe again.  Next time I'll likely add some cayenne to give it a bit more kick, increase the cumin  and the Worcestershire to 1 tsp, and maybe saute minced garlic with the onions.

I loved it more than my wife did. She said it was spicy. I made it with ingredients I already had,  so there were several changes. I used a can of tomatoes and green chiles as well as enchilada sauce. I added avocados and parsley as final garnish. I did make it in one dutch oven pot to minimize the cleanup. Thanks to reviews for that tip. Next time will be different I suppose as on hand ingredients may change.

I liked this a lot.  So easy and good comfort food.  I really like the spicy sweet combination, and I find the recipe very changeable.  I made it as directed, but next time, will add some corn and maybe a different chili sauce...something not quite so sweet, but will keep the brown sugar in it!  Love the easy one pot dishes!

I made this for the first time last week and my family loved it! I couldn't find chili sauce so I substituted it with red enchilada sauce and it turned out great! My 6yr old and two yr old loved it. Their dad took some to work the next day and let his friends try it and they all liked it. So needless to say this will now be in our rotation. 
We topped with cilantro, sour cream and avocado.  It really did taste like an open face taco. 
Very good!
Also by me using the enchilada sauce I think it cut down on the sweetness that some ppl complained about. Ours didnt taste sweet at all.

A keeper, especially after catching myself licking the serving spoon.  Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I  increased the water to 1 and a half cups to ensure all the rice was thoroughly cooked and used salsa instead of the chile sauce. Added several cloves of chopped garlic because it's hard for me to cook without it. Also decided to throw in some corn for color and texture.  Cooked everything in one stove-to-oven casserole dish.  Delicious!

I subbed in ground turkey, cooked leftover rice, two cans of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies.  I left out the green pepper, chili sauce, brown sugar, cilantro, and the water.  I topped the mixture with the cheese when it was hot and covered the pan until the cheese melted then topped with chopped green onions.  Skip the oven altogether!  It was great!

Delicious, but not particularly attractive.  So easy and quick when you make it in one skillet (or wok) and just put cheese on at the end with lid on after you cook rice instead of baking to melt cheese.  I used corn instead of pepper because that's what I had on hand.

I made this using a cast-iron skillet, which was really convenient because I could move it directly from the stovetop to the oven. I wasn't sure what chile sauce was, but I found chipotle sauce (medium) in the Mexican aisle of the grocery store.

This was excellent.  I did cut out the brown sugar and added red pepper flakes.  Had a really good taste.  Put it under broiler to brown the top/cheese a tad.  Really enjoyed it.  May use a can of hot Rotel tomatoes next time for the canned tomatoes.  Yummy.

Wonderful recipe! The depth of flavor is incredible. I also added 2 garlic cloves, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and an extra 1/2 cup of tomato. Thank you for the helpful suggestion of cooking the rice on a lower temperature. As others suggestioned, I substituted a 10 oz can of green enchilada sauce for the chili sauce  and chicken broth instead of water to increase the spice level.  I omitted the brown sugar and salt because we are watching our sodium. We were out of cheddar cheese. Luckily, mozzarella was a great replacement.

I revised the recipe slightly to suit our taste. 
Using: 2 lbs turkey or ex lean beef, 2 cloves garlic,540 ml spicy red pepper diced tomatoes, salsa  instead of chilli sauce,canned green chili peppers instead of green pepper, saluted the rice once the onions and garlic were transparent, reduced the sugar by half and used double the cheddar to top it. A Good base recipe to personalize this tasty, hearty casserole. Thanks!

Good basic recipe. My 12 yr old son loved it and had seconds. I didn't add as much chili sauce because my son doesn't like spicy. I also didn't add the brown sugar (didn't sound right to add it) or the cumin (forgot that I ran out) Used leeks instead of onions because that's what I had. My rice had to cook 50+ min before baking. I need to double the recipe next time so my family of 5 has enough to eat.  I will make this again with more chalula sauce but prob still not the brown sugar.

I made this for supper tonight - my husband and I both really liked it. I did as someone suggested in previous reviews & added a can of corn and I think that was a good choice.  I also used 1-1/2 cup spicy salsa instead of water.  Also, because I really like cheese, I topped it all with about 1-1/2 cups rather than just ½ cup.  I’ll definitely make it again but next time I’ll cook the rice separately and mix it in after the simmering, before putting it in the oven because it didn't cook evenly in the simmering pot - on the bottom it was over cooked and closer to the top it wasn't cooked quite enough.

I used 1.5 lbs of ground beef, a whole green pepper, a medium onion, 1 cup of brown rice, and a cup of sharp cheddar cheese. Everything else was pretty much according to recipe.  It turned out great and was a big hit.

Doubled the recipe with the exception of the salt and cumin.  Left out the sugar.  Used a slightly rounded teaspoon of cumin as wasn't sure it would be liked by one of  our guests. It was a resounding success.  Suggested if they wanted more salt to add it at the table.  No one did.  The seasoning was perfect.  Meant to mention that I used Medium Salsa in place of the chili sauce.

It was a three star.  I think it had a tomato soup taste.  If I make it again I will only  use  half  the chili sauce the recipe  calls for.

I substituted picante sauce (mild) for the chili sauce and for the regular canned tomatoes, I used Rotel (mild).  For a bit more flavor I used canned chicken broth to replace the water in this dish.  For my own taste, the brown sugar did not appeal to me when I read the recipe, so I did omit that.  Long story short, this was a good dish.  I am glad I tried it.  Will definitely make it again.

Super delicious!! I used tomato sauce instead of chile sauce, regular sugar instead of brown sugar, and I coated the top of the casserole with a layer of refried beans before adding the cheese. DELICIOUS!

Left out brown sugar, added 1/2 cup of cilantro to the mix that went in the oven and topped it with 2 cups of cheese because 1/2 cup was way to little for us.

great dinner!! even my picky eater liked it. Since I don't like really spicy-hot food, I thought it had enough flavor. I had to omit the bell pepper since I am allergic to them,, but added plabanos.  quick and easy to make.

I agree it is  too sweet, but it works well with fake beef as well.  I used Trader Joe's Beefless beef.  I didn't have green pepper so I put in celery.  I'm sure it would be better with green pepper, but it is still yummy, and easy.

I loved it the first time and then I have made it several times both with and without the meat.  I leave the cheese off and serve it on the side as it is better to reheat without the cheese on it

It satisfied my hunger and was tasty but needed a lot added. For instance when the ingredients were all combined in a pot 1 cup of water was not enough because it would cook out too fast. And the rice was still hard. So I adjusted the water to about 2 and 1/4 cups. I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of 1 teaspoon. WARNING: Don't use siracha sauce for the Chile sauce the recipie calls for or sharp cheddar cheese. As well, if you increase the amount of water, increase the seasoning also.

Easy and delicious. I added more  taste as It was a little bland for me at first. I also used a spicy chile sauce (by accident lol) but it gave it a nice little kick. I'm just glad I realized before adding so I could reduce the amount. Overall great meal quick and easy and filling

I suggest maybe using an instant rice or cooking the rice separate. I added over 2 cups of water and the rice still turned out crunchy and undercooked. I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted ground turkey for the hamburger meat and dried cilantro instead of fresh. The taste was great! Wonderful flavor!

This was wonderful, but the second time in making this, I used red enchilada sauce instead of chili sauce, and it tasted amazing. My husband, roommates and their kids even cleared the casserole dish (and my husband is hard to please, almost as bad as the roomies kids, lol).  Tonight I am making this again because I like this recipe......just going to add red enchilada sauce again.

YUMM I made this for my boyfriend and two friends who came over for dinner last night (who happen to be professional chefs) and they LOVED it. Served after a charcuterie board. Topped with cilantro and sour cream. Both myself and chef friend raised an eyebrow at the half a cup (!!!) of chile sauce. I put in a quarter cup and it was PLENTY. Spicy meatball alert! But just right at a quarter cup. This was SOOO easy to make, made the kitchen smell great and was a big hit. I would make additional rice to go with it and maybe add corn to the mix. You could easily serve this mixture in a soft taco.

Final verdict: YUM but could be vamped up slightly to unleash full potential of this amaze-balls mexi dish :)

4 Stars! 

PS: Chef friends made chocolate flan for dessert *drool*

Great recipe! The family loved it, including the kids! Only thing I did differently was I omitted the green pepper, I sautéed the onion with the ground beef. Before baking I added a heaping spoonful of sour cream to the rice mix. I also used an entire 8 oz. block of sharp cheddar cheese. I mixed half into the rice mix, and put the other half on top before baking. There is no such thing as too much cheese! Really good, will be putting into regular dinner rotation.

Made it last night.  I doubled the recipe and the neighbors came over for dinner last minute.   We still had a bunch left over.  This meal is very easy to make.  Everyone thought it was good.  Even a few of the kids said that they liked it (unprompted).  I'm probably the harshest critic.  I liked the flavor, but I don't think that this meal is awesome, just good.  Thank you for the recipe.

Really good recipe, I will definitely make it again.
I made it as described but next time when I brown the meat, I will add some taco seasoning sauce and perhaps substitute salsa for the chili sauce and see how that is. But whole family enjoyed it and my ten year old wolfed it down and asked for seconds.

I love this recipe. I make it with whatever veggies are on hand at the time and I always use salsa instead of chili sauce. This last time I replaced the ground beef with spicy Italian sausage. And extra ground chilies. It was delicious.

Awesome!  I made this tonight and we loved it.  I used the other suggestions.  I cooked in a big sauté pan that is oven friendly.   I added fresh minced garlic to the beef along with taco seasoning.  I put in a lot of salsa because I was too lazy to sauté tomatoes & peppers (but next time I will because it will definitely add to the dish).  Rice took 45 mins covered to steam because I wanted to cook on low.  Then I topped with refried beans and cheddar.  It rocked!  Only suggestion I have is to prepare guacamole... Definitely serve with sour cream!  Thanks!!

I made this as directed, but it needed more water to fully cook the rice. Very good as a base recipe,  I think. Next time, I will add more spice and perhaps some black beans.

this turned out to be quite an epic fail.. i realized last minute i had no cumin. then when trying to preheat my oven i rec'd a trouble signal code. so i had to improvise. i used chili powder but cut it in half. also, i just threw cheese on it after it was done cooking + sour cream. turned out fine! im excited to see what it really taste like but i wanted people to see an oven isnt needed for this recipe :)

I made this recipe exactly as instructed.  Actually I doubled it thinking 1 pound of ground beef wouldn't be enough.  Boy was I wrong.  It makes a lot!  That's okay because it was a huge hit with my hubby and friends that I shared it with!

I made this according to the recipe for a family function first. It was pretty good but the rice was a little undercooked. The second time I added 2 habanero peppers (my girlfriend and I always make things spicier at home then we do for gatherings) to the mix and added 3 eggs, beaten, when I added the cheese. This turned out delicious and I highly recommend it. Unfortunately, with increased temperature and cook time on the stove, I still failed to get the rice to desired tenderness (still great, though).

Great tasty and easy recipe!  However it's not really a 'bake' since you cook it on the stove for most of the time, only putting it in the oven for the last 15 minutes to melt and brown the cheese.  Also, don't turn the oven on first, you will have at least 45 minutes before you actually put the casserole in the oven; it took longer for the rice to cook and I had to add a little more water.  Good idea for a potluck!

Made with Rotel mild chilies and tomatoes, used chicken instead of beef.  Left of the chili sauce.  Nice zip and super easy to make.  I will make again.

I basically made per recipe using green chili enchilada sauce and Mexican stewed tomatoes. As a side I used this,  black bean and corn mix.  https://www.birdseye.com/vegetable-products/protein-blends/southwest-style?gclid=CjwKEAjwsvmvBRCT5ozK-dmY7D4SJACyIoJmsegHwyrV_7ozuVY_aT9b8jyqOQZFCLYgBt8n2nreCxoC0wHw_wcB

This recipe was just what I was looking for! I had all of the ingredients except ground beef. I instead used my reserve canned chicken breast chunks, and it was fabulous! I also added a touch of lemon juice to punch up the flavor and replace the brown sugar. It went in a whole new direction from the beef recipe. Lighter, and yet similar. I made it with beef shortly after and my family was none the wiser. THAT is cooking on a budget. Thank you for such a beautiful, versitile recipe!

This was outstanding! Incredibly tasty and just the right amount of heat!! The only change I made was to use an orange bell pepper instead of green (the green peppers were terrible at the store!), and I added celery as well. I also cooked the onion and celery with the meat (for a little extra flavour infusion!).  The only recommendation I would make is regarding the rice...if you are using a par-cooked rice like Uncle Ben's, then change nothing. But I used an organic, non-gmo long grain uncooked rice and it never did cook fully through, even though I added extra water and simmered even longer.  So next time I will pre-cook the rice! That's it!! Awesome recipe...going into my book of staples!!!

This is good. The only thing I suggest is to definitely add a taco season pack to this and use minute rice! Cuts down time to 15 minutes! Use one pan to cook on stove then just melt cheese in oven. Easy!

Very good!  I halved the recipe as there are only two of us to eat it.  After reading some reviews, I decided to leave out the brown sugar.  Other than that I made as directed except for adding the chopped onions and peppers to the browning ground beef.  It let them cook a bit more.  I didn't use a measured amount of cheese, just covered the top with it.  I will be making this again.  Don't leave off the fresh cilantro.  It makes the dish pop and cuts some of the sweet.

Turned out really good! Super easy! I used Rotel instead of just diced tomatoes and added cayenne for a kick. Other than that, everything else was the same. I really liked the slight sweetness with the spicy.  I think next time I may add some black beans! Note: when all of the ingredients are simmering, put a lid on the pot and don't take it off...the rice will be cooked after 30 minutes.

I made this recipe with chile powder, because I didn't have cumin and Siracha sauce instead of chile sauce. It was HOT stuff.  I can barely eat it because I'm a wimp, but there's no way I'm offering it to my little girl.  The flavor seems like it would be yummy if I could get past the heat. I think next time I'll make these changes:  Saute the onions, rice and peppers first in the pot while browning the meat. I will use half the chile  sauce / Siracha in my case or less maybe, I'll try to find cumin!   I did top my creation with sliced avocado and put plain Greek yogurt on the side to cut the heat.  It sort of worked! Overall an easy and yummy dinner idea.  I'm definitely going to try again.

Fantastic.  Tastes like chili (with cumin, tomatoes, onions and peppers, how could it not?) but the rice makes it filling.  Because I like kidney beans in my chili, I might add a can before this goes into the oven next time.   Also, I used a mixed basamati rice, not because I was being one of those sassy "I changed everything" cooks, but because that's what I had in my pantry, and I'm definitely a "I'm not putting pants back on to go to the store for some brown rice when I have this perfectly good brown/white mixy stuff!" kinda cook

We really thought this was bland and too sweet and actually chose to eat leftovers from the night before rather than this.  I even had left out the brown sugar after reading a few reviews.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.

Tasty and really easy! I added about 2x the tomatoes as I can mine in quarts, plus a whole onion and a little extra red pepper.  Reduced water to 1/4 c.  I also think it would be yummy without the cheese.  But the seasonings are spot on!  Will serve again!

I decided to give this a try since my son loves Spanish rice and it seems like a pretty easy recipe. He gave it a 2 thumbs up but I did make some changes.
I used about a tablespoon of onion powder because my son does not like bits of onions. I also omitted the brown sugar, chile sauce, Worcestershire and bell pepper. Instead I used about 1/2 cup of chunky salsa and 1 tsp of chile powder and I added the spices as the ground beef was cooking.
I also added flour tortillas and layered them when I transferred the meat mixture into the casserole dish.
I will definitely make this again! Yummy!

I thought it was good. Hubby & daughter picked at it though. I think I would have added something... not sure what yet. Maybe black beans? I topped with fresh shredded romaine, chopped onion and salsa and that helped give it the fresh crunch. If it were just me (and not family) I would def make it again.

Used spicy canned tomatoes, only had Thai chile sauce so used 1/2 of amount asked for,  added black beans, and didn't use worcestershire.  Did everything in an ovenproof skillet.

Unfotunately my family did not like this recipe.  So I get to eat all the leftovers.  I enjoyed it though, It was kind of sweet and the cheese made it nice.

Fantastic  The only change that I made was to use 2 cups diced fresh tomatoes as we are in the midst of the Great Tomato Harvest.   Fast, easy and delicious.   Next time I will double the recipe and maybe have leftovers

Good basic recipe...I dropped sugar and sweet chili sauce and used can of diced tomatoes and green chilies (Rotel) instead of plain diced tomatoes as we like savory rather than sweet,  and a little salsa for more kick.

Liked it, after reading reviews decided to use brown rice, a little more water for cooking rice a little longer and used diced canned tomatoes, with jalapeño.  Also used one pot for the dish before baking. Liked it, thought it would also be good with ground chicken.

very good, just added extra tomatoe , onion and added minced garlic to meat. Good with or with out cilantro.  For people like me, I need the recipe to say "cover" and simmer so don't forget to cover and DONT open to stir once on simmer. You let the steam out and rice won't cook right.

I make Spanish Rice Casserole all the time and this is good recipe, but I do make a few additions. I usually add a can of black beans and a can of corn and I totally cheat and use rice-a-roni Spanish rice because it never comes out right for me otherwise. This freezes well and is great to make ahead.

I make this recipe regularly.  It is a great addition to my dinner rotation.  It is easy, and I recommend doubling it just to have leftovers which are still very good warmed up a day or two later.

Did entire thing in one cast-iron skillet.  Used red pepper instead of green, salsa instead of chili sauce, seasoned meat with taco seasoning, and omitted brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce.  Brown rice instead of white.  Served in hard taco shells and soft with guacamole and pico.  Would probably be good with just chips, too.

This recipe is AWESOME! I didn't have any chili sauce and used about a tablespoon of crushed chili paste instead. I let it simmer for 30 minutes which was a bit too long. Without the additional liquid from the chili sauce everything else started to burn and stick the pan (which was definitely my own fault). If this recipe is too sweet for you I'd suggest using chili paste plus it gives it a little kick! Also LOTS of cilantro is a must. I will definitely make this again!!

We liked it, but next time I will add some oregano and reduce the amount of cheese. I might add a bit more cumin as well. I used Herdez Salsa instead of chili sauce and omitted the brown sugar.

Just had this for lunch and it was really yummy! Only thing I may have added is the recipe said half cup of chilli sauce and I added SWEET chilli sauce.  Even my hubbie ate it and he is very fussy at the moment! I used minced turkey instead of beef for a change and it was delicious. Great if you are watching your calories! Another great recipe Allrecipes!

Excellent recipe!  I actually used 2 cups of chili sauce as it made the rice slightly moister (this was after I had doubled the recipe so it would fill a 13x9 pan).  I also put 2 cups of cheddar cheese on top and it was very tasty.  Not only did everyone love it but there were absolutely no leftovers- and this was substantially more than I would have ever expected them to consume!

I thought this was DELICIOUS! My family devoured it:)  I always read the reviews first and make some changes based on other's reviews. Here's what I did. I used a whole onion and green pepper. I cooked the rice separately using whole grain brown rice. I seasoned the meat with garlic salt and red pepper (We like it spicy).  Then I added the veggies, one can stewed Mexican tomatoes and one can chili style beans (both undrained) and remaining ingredients. I omitted the water because the rice was separate. It simmered while the rice cooked. Once finished, I added in the rice and just melted the cheese on top. This was very tasty, healthy, and cost effective. When you're feeding a family of five that matters.

I did make this and it was so addicting! These are the changes I made, I used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned, jasmine rice, homemade spicy salsa instead of the Chile sauce and doubled the cumin. Other than that, I followed the recipe as it reads. I am definitely keeping this recipe for future.

We LOVED this recipe! I did however, cook it in one pan and served the cheese on the side. My husband likes rice so I cooked an extra pot of rice and it was good with extra rice. I didn't have just diced tomatoes but, I did have a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onions. Yummy..It would be good wrapped in a flour tortilla too

WOW!!! this recipe is totally AWESOME.. I made this one pot dish in a cast iron skillet.. I also used ground bison instead of ground beef, it's more lean less fat. Like the other reviewers while browning your meat add the seasons , I didn't use the brown sugar, can diced tomatoes,  or the chili sauce I use salsa medium & hot instead of that. Which gives you all the flavor. I also use little more cumin to taste and I added a can of Mexican corn w/ peppers, also a little taco seasoning on the beef... MMMMMMM this was perfect.. when adding the rice it is important not to do too much stirring of the rice just evenly distribute & cover with lid turn all the way down to low  for simmer.. I added grated extra sharp cheese to the topping .. My friend who I cooked this for.. LOVE IT.. .said I knocked it out of the park. Remember when cooking anything seasoning is all about taste, slowly add your seasoning then taste.. add more if needed to suit the taste your looking for.

This is almost the same recipe that my mother has been making for the past 50+ years and I've been making for the past 40.  The differences are we do not add brown sugar or chili sauce, since I am a diabetic, nor do we add salt and use the low sodium tomato sauce and diced stewed tomatoes.  Something else that I do is instead of ground beef, I use ground turkey or ground chicken thighs (since the thigh meat has more flavor), and instead of water, use homemade chicken broth.  If you want a little more spiciness, add a small can of red Enchilada sauce (I use the mild).  A real crowd pleaser.

Made as written, aside from using tomatos with chili peppers, a yellow pepper (didn't have a green one), and adding some garlic.  We loved it.

This turned out well, but I made some changes because of what was in my cupboard. I used a can of Rotel instead of the chiles and tomatoes. I also skipped the cilantro and chile sauce. It was slightly bland without them, but not so much that it wasn't still a great dish!

We loved this but did make a few changes to original recipe.  We omitted the chile sauce & brown sugar since most reviews stated this was too sweet.  I also added a couple gloves of chopped garlic and a small can of tomato sauce.  I made mine in a dutch oven so I could use one dish instead of 2 or 3.

This is so fresh and delicious!  Didn't do the cilantro as I do not care for it.  Reminds me of Pancheros minus the tortilla - just the filling.  I may even add black beans next time.  Try it!

This was really good, and I found that baking it after the stovetop part wasn't necessary.  I just threw a handful of shredded cheese, sour cream and avocado slices on it after the rice was fully done.  The cheese melted over the top, then a couple of turns of the pepper grinder, and voila!  I used stewed italian style tomatoes which had a lot of flavor, and instead of chili sauce I used a tomatillo cooking sauce.  My husband really liked the flavor and texture of this dish! Hearty but not too rich if you don't turn it into a casserole.

Thanks for sharing this recipe. It was so delicious and simple to make. My whole family loved it! There are a lot of reviews that say the rice didn't cook but you need to keep the lid on the first 15-20 min. and then stir. I kept it on medium low heat and simmered it for only 25 minutes, not 30. I also used El Pato sauce for the chile sauce. Thanks again!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dish.  My only suggestion would be to partially cook the rice beforehand, otherwise it doesn't fully cook.  I may add beans next time as well.

Great... I cooked the rice first and did everything else in one dish. I highly suggest topping it with a good cheddar (not the cheap orange stuff). I took others advice and saved enough in two small dishes to freeze for one pot meals down the road. I also used Rotel tomatoes (w/ jalapeños) and it was a great compliment.

It was just ok for us.  Nothing special.  Kids wouldn't eat it and husband ate it (but he'll eat anything)  Won't make this one again.

as others noted, this was far too sweet for me.  there was no need for brown sugar and additional tomatoes would have been better than chili sauce.  I would also have added cheese to the dish, not merely as a garnish.

I love this recipe! I've made it as listed above but have also used it as a catch-all for leftovers.... I've used leftover Thanksgiving turkey in place of the beef, added kidney beans, corn, salsa! Really anything left over in the fridge/pantry!

I thought this was great, how can you go wrong with a dish topped with cheese!  The only change I made is I used salsa instead of chili sauce. I topped with dried onions and a flour tortilla on the side. I will definitely make this again.

I was looking for a new Spanish rice recipe and this one was very yummy! Like most people, I made changes based on what I had. I used one can of diced tomatoes and one can diced tomatoes with green chilies. I only used 1/4 cup of chili sauce since I knew the green chilies would add spice. Rice and I don't get along, so I always use instant! I cooked it ahead of time and added it in after I let the veggies and beef simmer. Oh, I also stirred in about a 1/4 cup of lite cream cheese before I put it in the baking dish and then topped it with a little lite sour cream when I served it. My 2 yr old ate it, if that tells you anything! Thanks for this easy and yummy recipe!

This is just awesome!! My husband easily ate about HALF of it over the evening (and he is NOT a big man!!). I used a whole medium onion, and used poblano peppers instead of bell peppers. I added 1-Tablespoon of chili powder. For baking, I put 1/2 of the mixture into the casserole dish, sprinkled with grated cheddar, then spread the over 1/2 of the mixture, then topped with more grated cheddar! We are "cheese freaks" here. It was just YUMMY!!

We made this tonight for supper! Very good! Smelled amazing, we were hoping it would taste as good as it smelled and it did. We made it exactly as the recipe said, the only thing I may change next time is to add some jalapeno for a little heat. But if you don't like spicy its very good the way it is!

I'm giving this five stars since I believe it would be delicious the way it's written. However, because I didn't have a lot in my cupboards, I had to modify this quite a bit and the results were excellent and VERY easy! Talk about a quick meal! I didn't have any fresh veggies, so after I browned the meat, I added a can of Tortilla Soup (instead of all those fresh veggies) and then added the rice and water. I stirred it once, brought it to a boil and then turned the heat down to simmer - not removing the lid until the rice was fully cooked. That took about 20 minutes. Then, I took tortillas that I made the night before and cut them up into pieces and lined the bottom of the baking dish. I put the Spanish Rice mix into the baking dish, smushed it all down added a little cheese on top and put it in the oven for 15 minutes - just until the cheese melted and it was delicious! This is definitely a repeat meal in our household! The first night, I added too much cayenne pepper so it was really spicy - since the soup is spiced already. The second time, I added none and it wasn't spicy enough. lol! Just like Goldilocks and the 3 bears, the third time came out perfectly spicy. In fact, I've made this half a dozen times and each time it's better than the last. Highly recommend this recipe!

This was pretty good.  Easy to come together.  I didn't have any problem with the rice cooking.  It didn't say to cover when cooking, which I was skeptical of with rice, so I ended up not covering it anyway.  Rice cooked fine at a simmer for 30 minutes just as the recipe called, stirring 3 or 4 times within that time.  I also just cooked the stove-top part in just one deep pan, but did transfer to a casserole dish and baked as it said.   My husband really liked it, but to me the chile sauce made it have too much of a sweet taste, which I wasn't fond of.  But other than that, not bad.  Just a taste preference for me.

My family thought this was fantastic.  I love that is is so easy to make.  i made this a day in advance and stored it in the fridge until dinner the next night.  I believe this would freeze nicely, too.   Don't skimp on the cheese, it really *makes* the dish IMO.  Refried beans on the side also were a must. Thanks MELODIE for sharing :)

Yum, yum, yummy!!!  This was so super easy and quick to prep that I was sure I had done something wrong or left something out.  I did not brown the meat in a seperate pan then transfer to the pot...I did it all in the pot and no draining.  The only thing I added was a can of canned corn, drained, and it was delish!!  This would be a perfect dish to make ahead, store in the fridge or feeze, to enjoy later!!!  I was a little worried about some of the ingredients but when it all came together it was wonderful.  My husband is VERY picky and thought this was very good!!  Five stars from the entire family!!!  Thank you so very much for a wonderful, easy, and tasty dinner!!!

Very, very good!!  I love this receipe!!  My family loved it.  Because we like spicy food, I added some jalapeno pepper.  I also seasoned with some zesty creole seasoning and added a couple cloves of garlic and a little pablano pepper.  I used ground turkey instead of the beef and it turned out delicious.  I will definitely be making this again and soon!!  Great receipe!!!

I had this one in my recipe box for two years and finally got a chance to make it and I am glad I did.  I had to add more water while the mixture was simmering since the rice was not fully cooked and there was very little liquid left.  I also used a can of chopped tomatoes with  jalapenos for an extra kick.  Not sure if I liked the brown sugar in it but the family thought it was delicious.

This was great!  After reading a few comments I did the following - used a dutch oven rather than multiple pans, browned the meat with a clove of garlic, used about a cup of green pepper and a full teaspoon of cumin.   I used about 4 tsps of spicy thai chile sauce because that is what I had on hand. I covered the pot and simmered for 30 minutes and the rice was perfect.   Didn't bother to bake at all, just topped with cheese and recovered until melted.

Turned out great and took advice from others and used salsa instead of chili sauce, and brown rice instead of white.  I was worried that it would turn out too spicy for the kids but it was not at all and the family really liked it.  Easy to make and filling!

My family loves this!  I make it all the time.  I took the advice of the reviewer from Costa Rica and added the spices to the cooking meat.  Instead of water and tomatoes I used a jar of salsa and a can of enchilada sauce since it had been on the pantry for a long time and I wanted to use it.  I made it all in a cast iron skillet.

Very good recipe. I added a little more onion and a little more green pepper. I did every thing in a large iron skillet, that was I was able to just sprinkle the cheese on top and place the whole thing in the oven. Only one pot to clean.

Great recipe!! Everyone had a 2nd helping - I used 1/2 cup of salsa instead of chili sause so it wasn't too spicy for my 2yr old. He ate it all up! :)

Made this today with fresh tomatoes, peppers and added corn from the garden and fresh beef from our steer.  made it in a dutch oven and left the lid on for the entire 30 minutes on simmer.  I did put it in a glass baking dish to melt the cheese on top, but only because I used it to store the leftovers in the fridge as it is just my husband and I.  Definitly a keeper!  Thanks.

My husband and I both thought the taste of this was great, but agree with other reviews that the rice does not get cooked properly if you follow the instructions.  I did follow them as I usually do the first time with a recipe and we had crunchy rice, not inedible, but distracting.  Because the taste is so good, I will make it again, but will parboil the rice first.  I did not have fresh cilantro, so sprinkled dried on the top before putting into the oven.  Also added much more pepper than the recipe called for and served with hot sauce on the side as while the taste is could, it could stand to be spicier.

This is a 5 star recipe. It was very warm with the Chile Sauce, from the Asian isle in the grocery, (not chili sauce) but it was delicious.The aroma while it was cooking filled the house. I am saving it to my Recipe Box.

(By some odd coincidence, I made this very dish using a packet of Fajita Rice mix with the same seasonings, including cilantro -  and some ground beef just this week which I think would taste very similar.)  I can't wait to try out this recipe to see if it's similar, and I'm giving it 5 stars in advance, lol.  The one I made from the rice mix is VERY good, the cheddar cheese and sour cream really make the dish - plus some hot sauce to your taste.

My family loved this recipe!  I substituted Goya Sofrito sauce for the chili sauce and diced tomatoes zesty chili style (pureed since my family doesn't like tomatoes).  I served with a dollop of sour cream.

I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I used tamari instead (soy sauce). Also didn't have canned tomatoes, so I used Publix's "Fire Roasted Salsa" which had corn and black beans in it, and omitted the chile sauce since I didn't have any. Also ended up not doing the last step (bake with cheese on top) because I had to leave before finishing the dish and Hubby was already hungry, so he ate it as is. It was already very good without it! He liked it burrito-style too - as a filling with a tortilla. Good stuff.

This is a great one dish meal with a salad.  I will be making it again for the 2nd time tomorrow. It's quick, easy and very tasty. The only changes I made were to use brown rice and omit the salt as I do with all recipes.

The dish turned out delicious. I had to double the recipe because my can of whole tomatoes was 796 ml, so froze half.  I topped mine with lots of cheddar cheese and a some bread crumbs (stove top). Served with oven roasted asparagus.

If using brown rice, simmer in pot for at least 1 hour before transferring to casserole to bake.

I made this tonight for dinner. Even my 19 yr. old daughter was looking in the refridgerater for leftover.I made it just like the recipe except left the chile sauce out and just added more water.Oh yes, the only thing , it didn't say to cover, but I covered so rice could cook. Rice came out just right.

Thanks for a great recipe!  Yummmm!   I did make a couple changes but only because I was using what I had on hand.  I added an extra (14 oz) can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, and a can of corn (drained).  I did about 1 1/2 tsp of chili powder and 1/4 c. of salsa because I didn't have chile sauce.  

I only wish I had doubled it because I'd love more leftovers!!! :)

MADE IT THIS WEEK FOR A COVERED DISH AT CHURCH. I THOUGHT IT WAS EASY & VERY TASTY & THE RICE COOKED PERFECTLY. I DON'T CARE FOR ANYTHING TOO SPICY, BUT IT NEEDS JUST A LITTLE KICK TO IT. MAYBE I'LL TRY THE SALSA NEXT TIME IN PLACE OF TOMATO. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

I thought this recipe sounded really good but I wanted to try it with chicken instead so I used cubed chicken breast instead of ground beef. After I browned the chicken I added the onions and bell peppers and cooked until they were tender. Meanwhile I mixed the tomatoes, spices(i used extra cumin and added chilli powder), chipotle salsa(instead of chilli sauce), worcestershire and uncooked rice in a 2 qt baking dish then I added the chicken and peppers and onions and cooked for about 45 minutes in the oven with the lid on. Took the lid off added cheese and cooked it for another 10 minutes. It was delicious. I left out the brown sugar and cilantro because neither sounded appealing to me...

Made this tonight, followed the recipe exact, should have brought the mix up to a boil first and then dropped it down to simmer so it took a little bit for me to get the rice right.  Will know for next time.  We really enjoyed this a lot!  Great recipe thank you!!

Great recipe, on the two-week rotation here. I omit the brown sugar, and am a bit more heavy-handed with the spices, but otherwise follow it exactly. A success every time, and nearly fool-proof.

This was soooooo gooooood!!  Everyone in the house had more than one helping!  I'm so glad that I made 8 servings instead of 6!  I used all the same ingredients, however I used my calphalon everyday pan and went from stovetop directly to oven then to table - one pan, less cleanup LOVE IT!  Thank you for a great go-to recipe!

This recipe is really good!  I added some Celery, a can of Green Chiles, and an extra can of tomatos when I made it.  I didn't put any brown sugar in it, but I put some extra pepper and some italian seasoning in it.  I also used El Pato Sauce (found in the hispanic food section in a yellow can) in it for the Chile sauce.  It made it a little spicey,  but it was very good!  Next time instead of the extra can of tomatos, I am going to use a can of Tomato soup.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I was looking for an easy rice recipe that also seemed delicious and stumbled across this site and this recipe. Sooooooo delicious and perfect! I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I substituted with oyster sauce. I also used canned tomato paste instead of canned tomatoes (did have latter at home). I just finished making it and it is so delicious! The only small downside is that it's a but too spicy but that's okay. Next time I make it I'll reduce the chili sauce. Thanks for this Melodie!

My husband and I loved it. I made pretty much as the recipe calls for. I didn't cook the hamburger in a separate pan. I cooked it all in one and didn't even pour off the grease, it adds flavor. Also I'm not a fan of green peppers so instead a used a can of green chilies. I thought it gave the dish a good flavor. Served it with some fresh cilantro (not just some lots, because we love cilantro in this house!) and sour cream on top. Pair it with a nice salad and it's a great easy meal.

So glad I found this recipe! We loved it, and were saddened when we had no more for today. Instead of chili sauce I added a half a can more tomatoes and slightly reduced the cheese. Served with sour cream. Its Fantastic!!! My two year old gobbled it down as well, and hubby said I should make it again tomorrow!

This is very good.  I have made it many times.  I ususally don't even bake it to save time.  I have substituted salsa for the chili sauce for about the last year and it's great!

So the overall texture and combination was good, but I felt like the main flavor resembled ketchup way too much- so I will replace it with salsa and make it again.  I used ground turkey rather than beef and after adding remaining ingredients and bringing to boil I covered and simmered for 30 minutes without stirring and it was cooked just right,

changes: I had half a leftover chicken so diced that up instead of the beef and since I did not have any fresh cilantro on hand to put on top I put 2 tsp dry cilantro IN the bake. It was good but a tad bland...a bit too sweet....so I added extra chili powder before the baking phase. I used commrcial (Heinz) chili sauce. Not sure how much chili powder I added...just sprinkled over it...1/4 to 1/2 tsp range.

Very good.  Mr. Picky Eater enjoyed it.  I had some left over, so, the following week I cooked a half cup of elbow macaroni & added to the dish.  A little bit different, but it used up the leftovers, and still tasted good.

I'm not sure if there was anyone else that used the sriracha chile sauce like I did...if so, then the result is an extremely HOT dish!  It has a good flavor, but is incredibly spicy - and I can usually handle spice.  Next time, I will cut the chile sauce in half.  Those that used salsa instead and complained it was bland - that is probably why, the kick comes from the chile sauce.  Otherwise, I liked this dish a lot, and like the sweetness with the spicy.  I had no problems with the rice, mine cooked perfectly in the time suggested in the recipe.

very good.   My very picky irish husband loves this dish.  My only change is cooking the beef with taco seasoning and using salsa instead of chili sauce, only because i cant find it at my grocery store.   Also, as others have stated you have to put a lid on the pot and leave it for atleast 20 min...the rice will cook perfectly.

Very good. I had to use salsa instead of chili sauce as well and used brown rice but it still turned out great.

Good but not great for us.  We ate it the first night but never ate the leftovers.  I can't say there was anything wrong with it.  It was just not our favorite.

This is great.  I used fast cook long grain wild rice in the recipe and it was delicious.  Fresh cilantro on top before serving is a must!

This was good. Kind of bland to me.  I made it for some friends and they liked it in a tortilla. I think I like it better that way as well.

I made 2 versions of this dish.  One as written, with the exception of red pepper instead of green.  The other with red pepper instead of green, substituted black beans for the beef and used Rotel (with green chilies and lime) instead of regular tomatoes.  My husband preferred the one with the beans and Rotel saying that it had more flavor.  Next time I'm going to try it with beans and beef, and be sure to use Rotel.

The flavor of this was outstanding. I gave it only 4 stars because the rice was still on the uncooked side even after letting it simmer for a long time(over and hour). Next time I think I would either use a minute type rice or cook the rice separately. In any case I would still make it again. I used chipotle salsa because I didn't have chile sauce and it was really wonderful.

I did modify this recipe a bit.  I cooked brown rice separately and added it to the beef mixture at the end.  I substituted salsa for the chile sauce, which I did not have on hand. Also, I used this as a burrito filling instead, dividing the cheese among each burrito. I thought it was good, but lacked a bit of flavor.  Will probably add more salsa next time or try it as written, with the chile sauce.

I thought this was just ok.  A little bland even though I doubled the spices and added 1/4 teaspoon chili sauce.

I used brown rice instead of the long grain rice because I had it in my pantry, and added a small can of green chiles.  I had to adjust the cooking time and liquid content because of the rice, but the flavor was very good.

I never made it to the grocery store yesterday..(LAZY LAZY) so I was on a mission on what to make for supper. Here's what I did...in my electric skillet I cubed and sauteed some boneless chicken breasts in some olive oil, seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Cooked until nice and brown. I removed them and sauteed onions and peppers, added the tomatoes, tomato paste, a couple of spoonfuls of cream cheese, chili sauce, salt, brown sugar, (no cumin, can't STAND it) worcestershire sauce, fresh garlic, chili powder and pepper. I had made some minute rice, so threw it in and topped with tons of cheddar cheese. It was out of this world! My husband came home from work and knew that I really didn't have anything to make, and this blew his mind..he loved it!! He said, and I quote.."you never cease to AMAZE me"...I guess after 30 years that's quite a compliment. Oh yea, we topped it with a dollop of sour cream. YUM! Will make again. Thanks!! Also, made a cherry pie for dessert, it was really good, too!  lol

Good base but I also thought it too sweet and made some changes (hence 4 starts instead of 5).  Also easy recipe.  Changes I made to fit my taste: - no sugar; - subbed can tomatoes with green chilies instead of plain tomatoes; - used salsa with extra cumin and chili powder in place of chili sauce; - 2 garlic cloves minced; - 4 oz. cream cheese stirred in to melt (will cool down the green chiles if don't like too hot); - added chopped avocado and olives before baking.  My husband loved it this way and used as a filler for a wrap sandwich for lunch the next day and then the leftovers we used for nachos.  Thanks for sharing recipe.

Very good.  Living with a vegetarian, I used the soy crumbles instead of hamburger and it came out great.  I think sometime I'll make it without the rice and bake it in a shallow baking dish as a baked sloppy joe with cheese.

I didn't follow the recipe 100%. I used salsa as a substitute for the chile sauce and I thin kbecause of that it was missing something for me.  There wasn't as much flavor as I expected, so next time I think I'll add a little seasoning or chile sauce

Wow!  Surprisingly delicious!  I added one can 15 oz can of diced tomoatoes with chilis (Rotel) and one 15 oz can of diced regular.  I omited the green pepper because I didn't have any, the salt and the chili sauce.   I thought the salt wouldn't be needed and I didn't have the chili sauce or the green pepper.  I used what I had on hand.   I'll be getting the correct items and make it the right way next.  I'm sure several variations are good.  Thank you very much.  I'll be using this recipe often! UPDATE:  NOW I MAKE THIS IN ONE PAN.  I PRE COOK THE RICE AND OMIT THE WATER FROM THE RECIPE.  I DO NOT PUT IN OVEN.  I HEAT ONE SERVING AT A TIME IN MICROWAVE AND AND MELT THE CHEESE.  EASY.

Saw this on the site when looking for another recipe and decided to make this instead.  Family loved it even my picky eaters.  I didn't have any chili sauce so used salsa as other reviews suggested.  Will definately be making this again.

Very bland!  I followed the recipe except sub salsa for the chile sauce.  Plus I covered my rice while it simmered (not sure if it would cook right w/out a cover?).  This was okay after we used it like a dip w/ tortilla chips.  Won't be making it again:(

I really enjoyed this recipe. It had just enough flavor and spice to make it unique. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used salsa instead of chile sauce. I also omitted the worcestershire sauce as I didn't have any on hand. I used more than 1/2 a cup of Cheddar cheese which made it delicious. Would definitely make this again!

I made this for Sunday football and everyone seemed to enjoy it since there was none left. I think it needs a bit more seasoning. The tomato taste over powered the other flavors.

Was a very good dish with a different flavor to it.  I made some subsitutions though based on reviews and what I had in the house.  Sub'd meat for hot sausage, used diced tomatoes w/jalapenos in them, used instant rice, used 1.25 cup water, sub'd salsa for chile sauce. Topped with green onions, cilantro and sour cream. Hubby gave it an 8 and I said 9 out of 10. Used little extra cheddar on top too.

Even the kids loved it.  The 12 year old keeps asking me to make it.  It's every easy and most ingredients are always on hand.  I crushed tortilla chips on the bottom and top. yummmmm, making it again tomorrow!

We changed it up a bit:  Used about 2 cups water (no canned tomatoes)  Used 6oz. can tomato paste (no chile sauce)  added 3 Tbsp. chili powder  added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder  When it was all said and done - we enjoyed it!!!

I gave this a 4 only because my hubby didn't like it as much as I did. The kids did a pretty good job at it. I'll make again, perhaps a half portion. Added stuff per other reviewers

This is a great recipe. I made some substitutions, however. I used brown rice for nutritional purposes, and cooked it separately due to the longer cooking time required. I added the cooked rice to the mix before simmering. I used fresh tomatoes, skinned, instead of canned, and added a little extra water. I also used some garlic flakes, and I used hot chilli sauce instead of sweet. I omitted the brown sugar.  I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used a bit of parmesan. Cheddar would have been better and I will do that next time. There will be a next time-- I like this recipe quite a bit.

This looks and smells WONDERFUL!  Only changes I made were to add some jalapeno pepper since I grow my own in my garden, and I didn't have chile sauce so I just added a bit more of the tomatoes and some chili powder.  This recipe is a keeper!  OH and I also just used my large high sided skillet to cook this in to save me dishes :)

This was very simple and really good.  My whole family loved it.  I omitted the chile sause and used salsa and used red peper instead of green.  I found it was just enough for our family of 4 and I will double the recipe next time.  I also took the suggestion of the other reviewers and only used one pot that went right into the oven.  This would probably be good using sausage instead of the ground beef too.   Thanks for sharing this one.

This  recipes went together quickly.  My family went for seconds.  I added beans for the added protein.  I definately will do this one again.  The basic recipe is easy to add on to and personalize to suit your family needs.

This wasn't bad... the flavors were good, but a little too bland and in the end, I can't help but compare it to a tasty "Hamburger-Helper". There were elements I really enjoyed.  The chile sauce and fresh cilantro are both great additions, and next time I think I'd up the chile sauce or add some chili powder to spice things up a bit more.  Needed more cumin and onions too, and maybe some garlic.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I had a hard time getting my rice to cook and absorb all of the liquid in the pan.  A good recipe as written, but not great for me.  With a few changes, I think I might try this again.

Mmmm I love this!  Since I'm making it for the week's lunches and putting it directly into tupperwares, I just mixed the cheese in at the end of simmering rather than putting it on top and baking it.  I did use more rice to stretch it,  less sugar and didn't have cilantro but it was still wonderful!

We loved this. I did alter a bit, since I'm pregnant and get heartburn from EVERYTHING!! I omitted the chile sauce, cumin, and cilantro. I also used two fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned. It's delicious- and it's a great make-ahead-and-freeze for after the baby comes. Thank you!

Tasted a lot like cannded tomatoes to me.  Maybe adding some chili powder would make it better.  The left overs were better.

Very delicious, piquant dish! I only changed chile sauce for Hungarian hot red pepper "Eros Pista" which is very hot, so you only need 1,5-2 teaspoons of that. I will make this dish again!

Great flavor and super easy! I too used salsa (mixed black bean and corn salsa with regular to get enough - it was all i had) instead of the chile sauce; I also used ground turkey and reduced fat cheddar and served with sour cream.  My husband and I both loved it and will definitely make again.

I had high hopes for this recipe but was dissappointed in the end. I used shredded chicken in place of the beef and chicken broth in place of the water. I'm sure its just personal taste but i didn't care for the sweetness of the chili sauce. If i was to make again, I would use all tomato sauce and leave out the chili sauce. I also had difficulty with cooking the rice. It took way longer than the 30 minutes to cook through.

Pretty good. My boyfriend liked it too.  I used parsley instead of cilantro and added cheese into the rice mixture as well as on top.  I did not add the brown sugar - thought it would make it too sweet.

It was good, but I had to cook it almost twice as long as it said because the rice wasn't cooked all the way. Next time I'll either cook the rice beforehand or use minute rice. I also added some cayenne and tabasco to give it a little more flavor. We'll be having this again for sure!

Excellent quick-fix dinner! Toss it all in one pot and skip the oven. I took some of the other reviewers advice and mixed in a can of chili beans (and I also used beef broth in place of the water) and simmered everything together (along with a few special ChefHouse ingredients to kick up the heat a few levels!) for about 20 minutes on the stove. Topped with cheese and served with sour cream and warm tortillas and tada! A great weeknight meal in no-time from the stay-at-home dad/grad student!

This was very tasty, but I seemed to have the same problem as a number of other reviewers...the rice was crunchy. I added additional water and cooked an additional 20 minutes, yet some of the rice remained crunchy. The taste overall was good though. I would make it again, but I'll cook the rice separate and serve the hamburger mixture over it. Thanks for the submission.

This was really good although a tad too sweet.  I may also omit the brown sugar.  I used a whole onion and green pepper for a little extra veg. and it was good.  I think this makes more than four servings.  It is great left over as a lunch! I will make it again! I may add something (chili powder, red pepper flake) for some kick.

I changed a few things - I added more rice (ended up being a little over 1 cup) and threw in some red peppers. I also cut out the brown sugar, as I wasn't looking for something too sweet. This turned out well, but WOW is it spicy! I love spicy foods, but this is bordering on too much heat for me. I'll probably make it again, but cut down on the chili sauce (I used Sriracha).

I have made this twice already. It is great. I omitted the brown sugar because I don't like "sweet" ingredients mixed in with my food. It was still delicious!

I made this after finding it through an ingredient search, so I made some minor adjustments based on what I had on hand.  I used red pepper, salsa instead of chili sauce, and no sugar.  Delicious. Warmed us up on a cold winter night. Also, did the whole thing on the stove.  After cooking, I sprinkled the cheese on top and put the lid on until all was melted.  Worked perfectly!

This was great. Once I tasted the chile sauce and saw how hot it was I cut it to 1/4 cup and used crushed tomatoes to complete the measurement. I also added some crumbled tortilla chips in the middle of the casserole and it was great! My kids and husband asked for seconds.

My family loved this.  Was a little spicy for the baby, but my 9 y.o. loved it.  If you soak the raw rice in water while you're gathering the other ingredients/chopping veggies, it doesn't stay hard after cooking for the amount of time recipe calls for.

I gave it 5 stars cause the taste is very good, but even after reading the reviews my rice was still hard, I even simmered it longer and cooked it longer and still my long grain rice was hard, so I think next time I will either cook the rice first or use a short grain or quick cook rice cause the rest was excellent. I served with a side of mixed veggies and some biscuits and it was yummo.

We just had this for dinner.  It was so good.  My kids were complaining while I was making it.  Then they loved it. I used it as a burrito filling. I made it all in one pan.  I did not bake.  I just put the cheese over the top in the last few minutes to melt.  Also, instead of chili sauce I added salsa.  Instead of plain tomatos I added the tomatoes with chilis and omitted the green pepper.  I also added black beans.  So tasty.

I made this recipe as written, but the only change in the course of cooking it was that the rice needed more liquid to fully cook. I ended up adding an extra 1/2 cup of water. Otherwise, my family loved this recipe and I will definitely be making it again.

The first time I made this, I found the rice didn't cook all the way through. The second time, I cooked the rice in the microwave using chicken broth instead of water and mixed it all together before putting into the casserole dish. This really is a quite easy, inexpensive dish that I will make over and over!

This tasted way better than I thought it would when I was making it.  I followed the advice of not stirring while the rice simmered and leaving the lid on and it turned out great (although it stuck a little to the bottom.)  I also did everything in a dutch oven so it was only one pot.  A good weeknight meal with few and cheap ingredients.  My husband even had seconds.

Very bland. We could barely eat one serving. Today's canned chili is far tastier. This has the flavor I associate with canned, frozen, or boxed 'helper' foods from the 1960s. My family was extremely disappointed given all of the good reviews. Also, I'm not sure why it is called Spanish as I don't believe it is a Spanish dish, but perhaps Texan or Mexican.

This was okay. I think it would taste better if the onion and bell pepper were sauteed with the ground beef first. My husband liked it, but my kids and I didn't. I will not be making this again.

This recipe is pretty good.  My daughter and I are vegetarian, so we substituted GimmeLean for the meat.  I served it with Homesteader Cornbread and Refried Beans without the Refry from this site.  It was a VERY filling meal.

Very good! I think I used a little less brown sugar than it called for since I wasn't sure how it would go in the dish, but it gave it a nice little hint of sweetness that really worked well in the recipe. I'm adding it to my regular rotation of meals.

Most excellent - just like I had as a kid.  I, embarassingly, could not locate chili sauce at the store so I used the Manwich sauce I had in the pantry and some chili powder.  I also used chopped tomatoes.  Turned out perfect.  Thanks for the keeper recipe!

This was very tasty! It was sweet, but not too sweet. It was very good, but it needs to accompany something. Maybe made as tacos or a burrito? I'm not sure what exactly, but as good as it is, it's not great as a main meal.

This was a great recipe!  I too added rotel tomatoes (the mild can).  It tasted just as good reheated as it did out of the oven.  This will be a recipe I make often.  Thanks!

This is deff. a keeper though it taste's no way like anything spanish. Taste kind of like those stuffed bell peppers then sometimes it made me think it was similar to meat loaf but no it's just very good and thank you for posting this recipe. This would be a good holiday casserole dish.

made this dish last night and the family loved it. I added more cheese than called for and served this with tortilla chips. I also added some chili powder about 1tsp. just to give it a little kick. Thanks for the recipe.

This was good, but too sweet and not enough savory for my taste.  It's worth trying again without brown sugar, and adding salt and poultry seasoning perhaps.

This was such a fast and easy supper. It saved me a trip to the grocery store too.  I didn't have canned tomatoes so I used an opened jar of salsa dip and a little ketchup.  As I didn't have fresh vegetables to hand I used frozen 'Spagetti vegetables'  It was even better reheated the next day.  Thanks for sharing

I like the addition of cheese in this dish. I used a little less brown sugar than the recipe called for, added garlic powder, and omitted the cilantro entirely, as we don't like it. All in all, a pretty good meal.

this was a good basic recipe. It was a little bland. I think the recipe called for way too much water. I doubled the recipe and only added 3 cups of stock and the rice was a bit wet for my liking, still good though. I didn't add the salt bc of the stock, but I would add the salt next time. I also think I would add a little cayenne pepper to had some heat. Very tasty though. Everyone liked it.

This is one of our favorite dishes.  I found it on here a few years ago, and make it at least once a month.  

The way I tweek it - omit the cilantro, add extra veggies, serve it in a tortilla so the kids don't see the veggies.  YUM!

wonderful meal!!!!! my husband is picky about his spanish rice. He only eats rice in this kind of dish. This recipe adds a little zing to the flavor. I used more beef and another half can of tomatoes. My rice was perfect and the meal is full of flavor because you boil it down first. My hubby was watching a movie and had the plate in front of his mouth and scooping it in. ( funny sight)

I have been making this for a few months now. It is definitely one of our favorties and it is in regular rotation.  Of course, like many others I changed some of the ingredients.  I use either turkey or beef whichever is available in my freezer, I use zuchini and fresh mushrooms, two cans of tomatoes, no bell pepper (just because I don't like them) and a little more rice (not much).  For those that haven't tried it with the rice in the pot it works great.  I have never had the rice not done and it is one less pot to clean.

Excellent casserole recipe!  My whole family loved it.  Of course I used ground buffalo instead of the beef.  Much, much healthier for you.  Thanks for the great recipe!

great warming filling recipe

cooked this for 72 people recently and recipe scales well apart from salt - not sure if I used as much as suggested - I added it to taste late in the day.

to convert for veggies I cooked up the rice in one pot, mince in another, veggie mince in a third, and then veg in a fourth (peppers, onions) 

cook it all then mix in a big pot - add cheese when mixed, leaving about 1/4 of the cheese out, to put on top later. Spread in a baking tray and then bake until cheese has melted nicely.

One note - I used jamaican hot pepper sauce for this and I only needed about 1/5 of the amount suggested (gave a little bit spicy taste) - so I provided the rest as condiments for people to add themselves. Another fifth was added by people - the rest wasn't used so go easy on it! Served with tiger bread and very very popular with people

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because I was forced to make significant changes. I thought I had ground turkey in the freezer, but I didn't. So I made it with hot Italian turkey sausage, which I crumbled in the pan. Because of the spice, I left out the brown sugar and green peppers but I did use the other ingredients, including chili sauce, worcestershire and the cumin. OMG. Sooooo good. Since I had a sort-of Italian thing going on, I used shredded mozzarella at the end. Oh, one more thing: I did this all in one pan on the stovetop. I can't wait to try it as written, but with gr. turkey instead of beef. I'm sure it'll be great!

This was excellent. The only thing I changed was to boil the rice separately prior to baking.  I've had bad luck in other recipes with the rice not being quite done, but this way, it was! One of my guests called it "dangerously good."

This tased very good but just a little bit to sweet.  Also next time I think I will use 1/3 cup of chile sauce instead of 1/2 cup.  But even as is it is very tasty.

This was really good!  I didn't have chile sauce, so I used salsa and chile powder instead and therefore omitted the brown sugar.  (Next time, I will try the chile sauce and sugar!)  Although the dish was very tasty as is, it would be outstanding as filling for stuffed peppers!

This recipe had a surprising flavor - it tasted a lot better than it looked.  I cooked the dish using the times listed in the recipe and the rice was a bit underdone.  I would recommend tasting the rice before serving to make sure it's done.  Not sure if I would make this again.  It was good but not great.

I messed with it a little bit (green pepper and onions) but it turned out fantastic.  My dad wouldn't stop eating it (always a good sign).  I added extra rice and used a teaspoon of chili powder instead of chili sauce, but it coulda used more.

My family loved this recipe. I made this the night before and baked it, to melt the cheese right before we ate it. I added 1 can of Rotel tomatoes (instead of plain tomatoes).  My daughters topped their serving with a spoonful of sour cream. YUMMY! There was very little left the next day for lunch.  We will be making this again.

This recipe was pretty good, although thought was a little bland.  Maybe next time would try some green chilies,  or jalepenos, and some hot pepper sauce to give a little more zip to it.  With a little bit of help would be a great recipe, because it definitely does have a good base.

So Good! This is something I always make on those "What should I make?" nights. I never have chile sauce so I use enchilada sauce. For a little extra, I add mashed potatoes on top. I love to eat it for lunch the next day too!
