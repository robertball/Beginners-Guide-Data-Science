I really enjoyed this meal.  I am a garlic lover so I added about 5 cloves and it was delicious.

Using a prepared store bought sauce in a recipe is not a recipe.

I have to give this 4 stars because I can't ever stick to a recipe 100%. It was good as is, but I mixed the shrimp, sauce, and cooked ziti (what I used instead of spaghetti) together. I put this in a baking dish and topped with mozzarella and parmesean cheese. Then I popped it under the broiler for a few min to slightly brown the cheese. It was DELISH! Thanks for the great recipe!

I have not tried this recipe as of yet but I am just averaging out the rating of one rater who gave it a "one star" rating because it was his view that since it used pre-made pasta sauce it was not a valid recipe. If this was a recipe for pasta sauce I would agree but, since it is a recipe for Roasted Garlic and Herb Shrimp with Spaghetti I have no problem with pre-made sauce. Added to the fact HE did NOT even try the recipe, he shouldn't of rated it!

I made this a few weeks ago and it was great. It was so great,I'm making it again tonight. I added onions, mushrooms and green peppers to the prepared sauce. Thanks for a great recipe!!
