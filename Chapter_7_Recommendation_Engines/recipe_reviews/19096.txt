Ooof.  I am *exhausted* after making this recipe.  Waaaaaaaaay too much effort for the final product (which is good, but not *that* good).  The frosting tastes a lot like marshmallow topping and is really good w/ the coconut.  I think next time I'll make a white layer cake, give it a custard filling, and then frost with this recipe and coconut.
