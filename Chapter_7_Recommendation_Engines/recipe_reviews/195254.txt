I read the review of another person before cooking this, so I added some fresh basil, fresh parsley, oregeno, a few slices of freh tomato on top and a splash of red wine over each piece of chicken before cooking this dish.  Came out great

it's really just chicken and spagetti sauce, not cacciatore. That said it is very easy and kid friendly

The cooking is spot on, but it needs some vegetables and spices to be cacciatore.

I made this tonight for dinner and after I browned the chicken and took it out, I put it in a roasting pan. I sauteed some onions and garlic, added salt & pepper, basil, thyme, oregano and spaghetti sauce mixed it all up poured it on top of the chicken put on the lid and cooked it in the oven on 350 for 1 hour. Wonderful!!!! And family loved it.

I think this would be better with boneless skinless chicken breast.
