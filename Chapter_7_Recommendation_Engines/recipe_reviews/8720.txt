Delicious!  I didn't have any steak sauce so I used Worcestershire Sauce instead--it gave the chicken a nice zip.

Wow, the marinade/sauce flavors really absorb itself into the chicken, and I let the flavors set in for a mere half-hour before grilling!  The chicken turned out absolutely delicious. I grilled each breast for approx. 4 minutes on each side.  They turned out perfect.  I then basted them again w/leftover mixture and let them sit on the grill an extra minute before taking them in for consumption.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I don't have an outdoor grill so I used the George Foreman for this one- it turned out very tasty!

I knew as soon as I saw this recipe that the hubby would LOVE it and it would be too sweet for me.  So the compromise was I made the recipe exactly as stated but added an additional tsp of Worcestershire  sauce.  Gave it a little zip which was perfect for both of us!  Thanks Connie - loved this recipe!!!

This rating is just on the honey mustard.  It is wonderful!  I have been looking for a restaurant quality honey mustard and after finding this one, I can quit looking.  I usually tinker with recipes to suit our tastes, but there was no tinkering needed.  This honey mustard was great on chicken and on our salads.  I love it!

My boyrfriend's parents gobbled this up when I made it for them and that says a lot!  Great flavor....I've made this by grilling and baking and while both are great, grilling provides a little extra.  I think the steak sauce gives this honey mustard recipe that extra kick and I HIGHLY recommend making extra sauce for dipping like others have said because in all honesty, it is the best thing about the recipe and it completely makes the chicken.

Mmmmm.  This is SO good!  I just printed out this recipe 2 weeks ago and have already made it three times!  I even make the honey mustard as a spread for sandwiches - it's a little runny for the sandwiches, but I don't care because it tastes SO good!  I've also used this on the stovetop - I pounded my chicken breasts flat, then cooked them in a pan until they were no longer pink - then I coated the chicken with the honey mustard and just cooked the chicken for another 30 seconds on each side.  It was delicious!

Delicious!  Who would have thought there would be A1 steak sauce in this recipe! My husband didn't believe me. This chicken turned out very moist and flavorful, you don't need a lot of ingredients to make good grilled chicken.  I let this marinate for 6 hours and used "Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce" from this site on the side although it was so moist, it really didn't need it...

This chicken was so tender!  I doubled the sauce recipe and cooked the chicken over medium coals for about 30 minutes.  I turned and basted frequently and the smell was mouth-watering! My 4, 6 and 8 years olds loved it and my husband and I thought this recipe was worthy of a 4 star restaurant!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Delicious! I followed the recipe except I used thin chicken breast and I also with the suggestion of others doubled my recipe for the sauce.  I prefer it a little sweeter so I added more honey.  I also made extra to use as a dressing for a salad. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is a very tasty chicken recipe.  I followed the proportion for each ingredient as instructed and the honey mustard marinade turned out great.  However, instead of grilling the chicken on the BBQ, I cooked the chicken in the oven for 40 minutes at 400 degrees in a 9' by 13' pan.  Safe to say, the chicken turned out great.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I LOVE this sauce.  I grilled my chicken with some peppers and then tossed it all in the sauce and put it in a tortilla shell.  It was amazing!

This honey mustard sauce is heavenly! I didn't have any steak sauce so subbed worcestershire instead, but that was the only change I made, other than to double the recipe! I served the chicken with salad and rice, and served the extra sauce as a salad dressing, a dip for the chicken, and a sauce for the rice all in one. I will definitely be keeping loads of this honey mustard on hand for pretty much anything - sandwiches, salads, dips, sauces, etc. It is VERY mustardy, so beware -- I like it this way, but my roommate said it made her eyes water.  ETA: I made this sauce again, but this time with Safeway brand Dijon instead of French's (it was what we had). The store brand dijon was quite diluted compared to the French's, and so was a lot less hot and mustardy but still really good -- anyone who doesn't like a lot of mustard could give this a try!

The outside of the chicken had some flavour, but the inside tasted pretty plain. I marinated mine for a while in the honey mustard mix but it still didn't add any flavour or moistness. But all in all it was fast and easy and tasted ok.

This was a very tasty marinade and dipping sauce - the steak sauce added just enough flavor to make it not the usual overly-sweet honey mustard.  We used the leftovers today to make sandwich wraps, adding lettuce and tomato slices to each wrap, along with strips of the leftover chicken breasts and then drizzled some of the leftover marinade/sauce over it all before rolling up the wrap.  I will be using the rest of the leftover chicken tomorrow on a lettuce salad, and the marinade/sauce will be the dressing.  It was worth making "extra" when we made this, as the leftovers can be used in several different dishes!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

The marinate was unbelievable! My bf cooked them perfectly on the grill so that helped too, but it was such a nice honey mustard flavor. On the side I made extra marinate and added a dash of red wine vinegar and a dash of olive oil to make a salad dressing. Than put it on top a spinach, red pepper, soya bean and roasted chick pea salad. And I don't know what I loved more, the chicken or the salad. The salad dressing was out of this world good.

This is a review of the sauce only...I was bummed when I couldn't find honey mustard bbq sauce at the grocery store so looked this up...GLAD I DID!!! Just really good! I lightly salt & peppered the chicken thighs  just because we always do, but not necessary. Tasted great as a basting sauce while grilling chicken but next time I'll definitely use it to marinate the chicken for a few hours first to allow the excellent flavors to permeate the meat a bit. A keeper for sure!

OK, this is my first review and I have had doubts about the other reviews I have read but....I just had to "review" this recipe.  It is outstanding!!!  I made it for my family a couple of weeks ago and they raved about it.  I have had to make it once each week since the original "debut."  Word of warning...if you use it as a marinade don't use direct heat when placing the chicken on the grill, the sauce burns easily.  Do yourself a favor and MAKE THIS SAUCE!  It really is as good as everyone says.

This is the best honey mustard i've ever had! I put this on broil in the oven instead of the grill and it was still great! I've already used the basting sauce for dip for homemade chicken fingers and a pork tendorloin. I've already got it memorized! Thanks for sharing this keeper!

Great honey mustard marinade.  I think the key to getting the best flavor is to let the chicken sit in the marinade for hours and hours.  I actually had the time to let this sit for 24hours and it was sooooo delicious and the chicken came out so moist because of that.  The flavor tends to be more suttle if you only marinade for an hour so try to atleast let it sit for a few.
Will def use in the near future.

I added a little dill to the sauce, and sliced the chicken into strips before marinading and grilling. It was great.
I think I will add Thyme next time.
Even my picky eaters liked this one.
Thanks for sharing Connie!

Fast, easy and tastes good!  My kids who both love grilled chicken, but aren't wild about mustand, loved this--and spooned the extra sauce over everything!  I did have a problem with the chicken sticking to the grill--next time I'll oil the grates.

I made this last night and my husband Rick & I really liked it. We grilled breast, leg & thigh. The sauce has a nice tang from the mustard and sweet from the honey. I did add a splash of beer to rinse out the mustard bottle. Didn’t want to waste the mustard and not water the flavor down! I think this sauce would be good on pork too. Thanks for a good idea.

This sauce is amazing. I ate so much chicken I barely touched my vegies which isn't like me. We did not grill this but baked the chicken. I baked the chicken till done,drained the juices and poured the sauce over top and baked it another 30 min. I made the sauce a little different going with what I had on hand. I used more then 1/4 cup of honey and I added garlic powder and onion powder to taste. I didnt have any steak sauce so I used a Tsp. of Worchestershire sauce and it added a great flavor. This is a keeper for our family recipes. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent and Easy.  Prepared as written as a 'test run' for a big family gathering next week.  It was DELICIOUS.  Will serve next week with a bowl of dipping sauce as suggested... as well as marinaded the meat for a bit before grilling.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delish! I had boneless skinless thighs to use up, and used this recipe exactly, used bold and spicy A.1. Steak sauce.  I ended up marinating them (1 1/2 the recipe) for 32 hours, was only supposed to be 8 hours, but had a dinner change of plans. I thought they would be ruined, but OMG, soooo good and tender, not overpowering at all. This will be a regular meal, and I will plan on marinating for 24 hours, or at least all day long. I was very surprised how awesome this turned out. I forgot to mention that I am not a fan of chicken thighs, but this marinade worked wonders. You must try!

Fabulous!  This recipe is so easy, with ingredients I generally have on hand.  I was rushed (as usual) so didn't take the time to measure out the ingredients, just eyeballed the amounts till they looked about right.  The chicken turned out nice and juicy and super-yummy.

Weather didn't cooperate, so I baked the chicken instead. Baked at 400 for approximately 20 min. I doubled the sauce to have extra for dipping.  Leftovers were eaten for lunch the next day.  Can't wait to try on the grill.

This was a very quick and simple recipe that's great for a last-minute menu.  My grill was not working, so I had to cook it on the stove and it turned out very good.  Before I cooked the chicken, I squeezed about 1/4 of a fresh lime on each breast about 10 minutes before cooking.  The juice helped tenderize the chicken and give it a little zest.

i was pleasantly surprised with so few ingredients how GREAT this recipe is!  i first tenderized my chicken breasts, then marinated 6-8 hours.  my low-fat mayo tended to clump, but a metal whisk took care of that in no time.  other than that, i stayed true to the recipe and the chicken was bursting with flavor after marinating in the perfect ratio of ingredients.  we sliced ours and stuffed them in fancy rolls for sandwiches (needed a fast meal), but this is definitely a dish that can hold it's own as a main entree with sides, and i also think it would be great sliced on top of a salad.  magnifico!  just wish i had leftovers...

Snaps for Connie! This is the best honey mustard sauce we've ever had. I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce. So glad I did. I  marinated the chicken in the sauce for several hours and still had some for basting. The chicken was juicy and the sauce was the perfect blend of flavors. Our new favorite!!!

I do have faith as in a grain of mustard seed and this chicken was good.  It was moist and tender. Just wasn't spicy enough for my families taste.  I even used Bold & Spicy A-1 steak sauce and marinated in sauce for several hours.  Will try again. Thanks.

I made this 2x's already and each time this was scrumptious. I marinated the chicken for 4 hours and let the flavors marry. My guests raved and the chicken was very juicy. I will keep this on rotation for sure.

Me and my fiance have been obsessed with a chicken dijon sandwich served at a local pizza place, but were looking for a way to make it at home and cut back on the fat. This sauce was even better than the stuff they use! I highly recommend making the chicken as it says in the recipe, but serving it on a lightly toasted hoagie roll with all your favorite toppings, especially onions, banana peppers, and cheddar cheese. Delicious!

Really, REALLY good! I marinate chicken for a couple hours prior to grilling.  Definitely double the sauce to use some for basting and some for dipping!  Besides the chicken being moist and flavorful, this honey mustard sauce is WAY better than any store bought! YUM!

Great recipe! I was surprised with how moist they came out. I used a George Foreman, and the chicken really only needed 2 minutes per side. I marinated the breast halves for a few hours beforehand and really recommend basting quite a bit while grilling (and putting aside some marinade for dipping sauce) for optimal flavor. I'll definitely be making this again soon!

This is really good- I loved it. I added a splash of lemon juice and a dash of garlic powder. I used about 10 (or more) chicken tenders and marinated over an hour.  I used all the marinade on the chicken- I just boiled the leftover sauce in the microwave for a few minutes before basting it over the chicken on the grill. This chicken had fantastic flavor and was sooo tender, you could cut it with a fork.  Served with Ceaser salad and Steve's Garlic Home fries (from this site).  Great meal!

This is delicious!  Although, I have to admit, that I was too lazy to deal with the grill when I made this...I poured all of the sauce on the chicken and baked it.  Everyone loved it!  I will do this one again, and I MIGHT even put it on the grill.

This was delicious! I grilled the chicken on a George Forman type grill. I then sliced the chicken and put them in wraps smeared with extra honey mustard sauce. I also added grilled peppers, avocado, mixed greens and some chopped sundries tomatoes. Everyone devoured it!!!

In my opinion, it's best to use thin chicken breasts.

I cooked it as directed. But before the chicken was all done. I put on it mushrooms and cheese and put it back in the oven for the rest of time. It was absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it!!

I followed the recipe exactly. The chicken turned out very juicy and yummy. I also use the honey mustard sauce separately as a dipping sauce or salad dressing. It is very good. Thank you for a great recipe.

I love this recipe.  Great  flavoring for fast grilled chicken breasts. I usually pound the chicken breasts thinner to speed up the grilling process.  Often make extra to use the next day in a salad.  Highly recommended.

This is a must to try..I never do good with chicken breasts on the grill (they are always dry). I took them and cut them in half so they didn't have as much time to cook. With the sauce these things were just simply put HEAVEN for my entire family!! DID NOT CHANGE ANY INGREDIENTS!

awesome flavor.  Subst. worscheshire for steak sauce b/c we did not have any, marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts overnight (added salt and pepper) and grilled on bbq.  One of the best marinades ever b/c the sugar and mustard combo charred to lock in the moisture of the skinless breasts.  Can't say enough about this simple miracle marinade!!!

I was very disappointed with this recipe and am obviously going against the grain based on the high reviews  it has recieved.  I thought that this had an odd aftertaste and I would not make this again.

Awesome recipe.  Certainly didn't think the mayonaise sounded good but you couldn't even tell it was there.  I think it just helped to make it a thicker sauce.  I will definitely make this again!

Happened to read this recipe on a day I had a big piece of wild caught salmon thawed to make for dinner.  I made this as a marinade and threw the fish in it for about an hour.  Husband said it was the best salmon I ever made! Really nice with a good grainy mustard, which is what I used instead.  Also slipped and used more steak sauce than it called for and it didn't matter, it was still terrific.  I will try it with chicken, but use it on fish too.

This recipe is great!!! I oven roasted the chicken along witht he sauce and it was so tender! I added the extra sauce afterwards and was delicious... only difference I made was added a tad bit more steak sauce. Cannot wait to make this again.

Cooked it on my George Forman grill - really easy to make! I used chicken breast tenders so they were already sliced thin, making it easier to grill. Next time, I need to remember set aside some spread at the beginning so that the sauce that's touched raw meat doesn't mix w/ the sauce I use for the cooked meat

Very yummy - definitely listen to the reviews that recommend making twice the sauce - we wished we'd had a bit more on the side to dip it in.  I marinated the chicken for a couple of hours in half of the sauce and then we grilled it until it reached 165, basting the chicken on the grill with additional sauce with about ten minutes of grilling left - worked great.

Made this for dinner last night and hubby LOVED it!  The chicken breast was so moist it practically melted in your mouth.  Will definitely be making it again.  I agree with some of the others about making extra sauce for dipping... yummy!

super easy and moist. This was a great, OMG it's 5:30 what am I going to cook meal, because most people have these ingredients on hand. My husband and 20 year old son gave their stamp of approval so that works for me.

Wow. Judging from the recipe, I thought this was quite gross but decided to make it because my husband likes all the ingredients. I didn't have ANYTHING except the mayonnaise. I had to mix sugar and water to make "honey", use regular yellow mustard, and use seasoning sauce (the asian kind) instead of steak sauce and it STILL tasted good! To my surprise, my husband loved it! Thanks for the recipe! I'll be using it again for sure.

This was delicious.  Wonderful flavors.  It was too hot to face the grill outside, so I just cooked it with olive oil in the frying pan.  It was great left over in a salad, too.

This was a different twist on grilled chicken for us.  I followed Sherri’s advice from the buzz and marinated it five hours before grilling.  Tasty, easy, fast. . . what more can you ask for?

So simple and quick. I  prefer to cut chicken into cubes and marinate overnight. Skewer and grill 8 minutes over med heat,  turning once.  I have also made whole breasts and sliced over a tossed salad with honey mustard dressing from this site.  Delish!

Excellent, we did marinate the chicken in sauce for about an hour before grilling it. We did brown each side over direct heat and then moved over to indirect heat, for about fifteen minutes. Thanks.

Loved it!  Took a  double batch to a potluck tonight (adding a little extra honey so that it was 2/3 c Dijon mustard, 2/3 c honey, 4 Tbs mayo, and 2 tsp steak sauce).  I told everyone that we were all going to be guinea pigs for this recipe.  This chicken ended up being the hit of the party!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is great.  The chicken was extremely tender and everyone in the house loved it.  I've made it twice now, the first time "as written" and the second time I used worcestershire sauce in place of the steak sauce.  I have to say we like it with the worcestershire sauce a little bit better.

My wife asks for this every week. haha! This is by far best honey mustard chicken ever. I bale on 350 for 20 minutes and pull it out of oven and put a slit in the middle and pour honey in it. I flip the chicken and bake for another 20 mins. Turns out perfect using exact sauce from here!

This simple blend of ingredients yields tender, juicy, and absolutely delicious results.  I had enough  sauce to brush on 8 small chicken breasts.  There was even enough to set aside for basting on the grill.  I used grey Poupon, and my youngest found it to be a little too hot for his taste.  I'll keep that in mind next time, but it was perfection in my book!  Thanks for a great recipe for summer grilling!

Delicious!  I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces, sauted the pieces until almost cooked, then added the honey mustard sauce towards the end.  I saved some of the sauce and drizzled some over a salad, and added the chicken to the top.  Really amazing dinner, and everyone was pleased!!

I can't even count how many times I've used this recipe. Every single time, it's amazing. It seems strange to add steak sauce to the marinade, but it really works. This isn't like any pre-made marinade/grilling sauce you can buy in the store. This is a completely different taste--a much better taste!

Pretty good recipe. The flavour didn't really go into the chicken all that much, but I still enjoyed it. Will keep this recipe, thanks for sharing.

Very good grilled chicken dish.  Made exactly as written, except for using bone-in split chicken breasts.  I am not a fan of breast meat typically, but this was quite yummy, very juicy and tender and full of flavor! Added to recipe box. Will make again!!!

Made as directed, however, I was making 50 pieces of chicken for camping for a large crowd.  I baked the chicken with the sauce first.  Cooled it, threw the chicken in freezer bags, made extra sauce, took it all camping, bbq'd with the extra sauce when we were ready for dinner.  Turned out great!

Great chicken! I prepared the sauce about an hour before hand and let the chicken marinate for a little bit. This chicken was great, full of flavor and moisture.

Made this for a small family cookout. Rave reviews from everyone.  I used a whole chicken cut up and let marinate for 2 hours.  The skin burnt a little so next time will cook over indirect heat. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

WOW!!!! This is by far one of my favorite grilled chicken dishes now! I kept to the recipe exactly except cut up a whole chicken instead of using all breasts. Oh, I also tore up some fresh basil and threw it in. I marinaded the chicken for about 3 hours and grilled on indirect heat for about 30 minutes. The chicken was nicely sweetened from the honey and very juicy from the marinade. Thanks soo much!! I can't wait to make this again!!!

Great recipe!!  I only had two pieces of chicken to grill (for my husband and me) but still made the entire batch of sauce.  I used 1/3 to marinate the chicken in (I pierced the chicken so the marinade would sink in better), 1/3 to baste the chicken with as it grilled, and 1/3 as a sauce to drizzle over the chicken. It rocked!  Yes, it tasted like mustard but not overpoweringly so.  The only change I made to the ingredients was to use spicy brown mustard instead of the dijon just because that's what I had on hand.  Will DEFINITELY be making again.

The recipe didn't call for marinating the chicken, but I think it would have been great if it sat for a few hours.  I made the sauce and marinated for about 30 minutes, then grilled.  It smelled great!  I could taste the flavors a little bit, but definitely wanted more.  Next time I will marinate for 4 hours or more and see how it turns out.

Overall a good, easy recipe.  The honey mustard tastes great, and the addition of steak sauce gives it a nice flavor.  I barbecue the chicken breasts, melted some pepperjack over them, and stuck them on a roll with some sauteed onions, and it made a delicious, quick meal. This one is definitely a keeper.

Not a mustard fan at all but decided to give this a try based on all the great reviews. It was incredibly easy to make and tasted wonderful! Made extra sauce for dipping, like others recommended, it really made the dish. Definitely will be making this again!!

Really easy and very good. No changes necessary and it is definitely a family friendly recipe. I have also used it to put on top of salads. Sometimes we have large salads for supper and top them with chicken, steak, or whatever. This is definitely great on a salad.

I marinated the chicken breasts for 24 hours and they came out flavorful and tender. I seasoned the chicken with salt, garlic powder and onion powder before marinating. This recipe is a keeper!

I tried this for the first time last night, and it was delicious! I added a little bit of extra honey to the honey mustard just for added sweetness, and it was perfect. It definitely gave the chicken a lot more flavor!

I really liked this recipe! The chicken came out moist on the inside, with some crispy bits (just like the pictures!). It was very easy to prepare and cook; however, I would suggest letting the chicken marinate for at least half an hour to an hour in the fridge before grilling. 

As a side, I quartered, boiled, and roasted mini russet potatoes with yellow bell pepper pieces and asparagus pieces. I also drizzled EVOO and sprinkled the veggies and potatoes with garlic salt and Cajun spice. Roasted at 425 F for about 15 minutes.

I was looking for a new grilled chicken recipe and this one is a keeper! The flavor was delicious. I didn't have any steak sauce so I used worcestershire sauce as someone had suggested.  Be sure to reserve some for dipping.

We grilled out for Father's Day - had 9 people eat this chicken and not one person complained. It was gone in no time and almost everyone wanted another piece! The taste is amazing and it was so juicy. I noticed in the reviews some people did not halve their chicken - this was a must (I imagine it wouldn't have been nearly as flavorful all the way through if it was left whole.) I also let it marinate 5 hours before cooking (next time I'll do it overnight.) We will definitely cook it again!

I too, made it on a portable grill. The chicken was not dry inside but just plain. It needs to be marinated before hand to add that extra kick. I'd make it again. Good flavor

Absolutely outstanding!  I'm not a huge fan of honey mustard anything but was looking for a simple, healthy grilled chicken dish and chose this one.  Used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and A-1 as my steak sauce and low fat mayo.  FABULOUS!  Will definitely make again.

Really really loved this more than I thought I would! I have the recipe since I was only making two pieces of chicken. I kept all the ingredients the same, except I used miracle whip instead of mayo, used 1 Tbs. honey and 1Tbs. real maple syrup. I also added some pepper,garlic powder, garlic salt, and some mccormicks BBQ seasoning, let it marinate for awhile, and it turned out absolutely amazing!! I can't wait to make this again and I think it would also work wonderfully on other types of meat as well!

Good base recipe.  Like other reviewers, changed it up a bit.  Added 1 tsp. curry and 1 tbls olive oil.  Did not have steak sauce so used worch. sauce.  Marinated for closer to 6 hours.  Made chicken kabobs, grilled up fast and tasted great.  Will make it again!  Thanks.

I fully agree with the reviews that call this recipe outstanding. It was not the least bit dry, and the flavour of the sauce permeated throughout the chicken so that it was not necessary to dip in extra sauce. The honey mustard itself is the best. How lucky was I that I had Miel de romarin (rosemary honey) from France, and dijon mustard flavoured with chardonnay. It was over the top. This recipe is one of our new favourites.

The sauce was good. I would recommend letting the chicken marinate at least 8 hours in the sauce because otherwise it doesn't really soak up the flavors.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because the chicken I bought was terrible!  Not fault of the recipe's!  The sauce was AMAZING I followed the recipe exactly and it was very very good!  It was easy to grill on my George Foreman. Will make again, except using a better quality chicken breast!

This was so delicious! I made a double batch of sauce like others had recommended. When I tasted it before coating the chicken it was a bit mustardy so added some more honey. I will definitely be making this again!

Made this tonight and loved it. Used 2 chicken breasts and a package of chicken tenders (thawed these by mistake). Had to make 2 small changes. I didn't have steak sauce, so used Worcestershire sauce. It worked fine. Also, no outdoor grill, so used an indoor grill. Tasted great. Very picky adult son commented on how good the chicken was. Served it with rice pilaf and sauteed peas and shallots.  Cooked in no time, especially the chicken tenders. Will definitely make again.

My family loved it. I am a vegetarian and I prepared my Quorn Tuk'y Burger in the same sauce and it was out off this world good. I also served wild rice and broccoli on the side. It was a great meal.

This is one of the BEST, QUICKESt AND EASIEST meals I have ever made.  I made the marinade just at it is written.  I cooked the chicken on a George Foreman grill.  It worked like a charm.  The chicken was tasty and moist and the dipping sauce was amazing.

This was a very simple recipe and turned out great. Maybe it was the addition of how to grill the chicken correctly that also helped - the chicken was flavorful and juicey.  This is a great recipe for novice cooks!

Best honey mustard sauce I've ever had.  I had to bake mine since we don't own a grill right now and it still turned out wonderfully.  I added a slice of swiss over the top during the last few minutes of baking.  Very good.

Way better than plain grilled chicken! Lots of flavor! I reserved about half of the sauce for basting on the grill and dipping in later.

This was awesome! My husband (who has the taste buds of a five year old and isn't a very adventurous eater) loved this chicken and has already requested to have it again soon. I don't have an outdoor grill, so I marinated the chicken in the mix for about 30 minutes and grilled it on my George Foreman grill. SO moist and flavorful! I'm looking forward to coooking this again and slicing the chicken to put on a spinach salad.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. We don't have a grill, so I pan-seared the chicken. The glaze on the outside was delicious while keeping the chicken moist and tender on the inside. Hubby, 4-year-old daughter and myself LOVED it. Thanks!

This was very good, I was skeptical of the ingredients in the sauce. But the family loved it.

All you tasted was mustard; not a good tasting mustard flavor.  The chicken did not absorb the flavor.

This was nice, and a pretty versatile dish.  I may have shook in a little more than called for of the steak sauce.  Made just the right amount of marinade to split in half: marinated for 30 min. in one half and saved the other half for basting on the grill.  I think it would've been better with a longer marinating time.  The reason I chose this recipe was because it does not mention marinating and I was short on time, however it would really enhance the flavors to do so for an hour or two.  Also, I NEVER turn occasionally-once is sufficient if you do it when the meat is cooked about 75% the way through.  Turning once created a more moist, tender and juicy piece of grilled meat.

Im not a big fan of chicken but this was awesome! My whole family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used low fat mayo and I doubled the sauce so I could save some for dipping. Even without the extra dipping sauce, the chicken had soooo much flavor. My husband cooked it up until it was really well done (charred edges, the way we like it!) on the grill. This is one of the few recipes we have tried that we will now have on a regular basis

My family loved this. It was a quick, easy way to make our chicken breast more flavorful, while keeping it moist on the grill. Sure there are other recipes that will do that, but this one is quick. No marinading for hours, no pre-planning. More than likely you already have all the ingredients. I did taste the sauce and thought it could use a little more zing for the sweetness, so stirred in a small amount of horseradish sauce. About 1/2 tsp for the original recipe.It worked really well. Great recipe! Thanks for posting it. Will make again very soon!!! YUMMMM!

This was really delicious.  I did not have steak sauce so I did as another review stated and used Worcestershire sauce instead.  I set aside some of the sauce to spoon over chicken.  My whole family enjoyed this.  Will make again.

I make a recipe very similar to this but omit the steak sauce and add curry powder to taste. Also turns out well in a hot oven (400) if you can't grill it. The secret is plenty of honey so that it will carmelize while grilling or baking. I serve this with Jasmine rice and use plenty of sauce when I bake it so that we have extra for the rice. Kids LOVE it.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. The sauce is so perfect. I did not have steak sauce on hand so I substituted it for Worcestershire sauce. I used a George Foreman grill and besides the sauce burning, it was so good.

The dijon, honey, mayo mix here is what I usually use for a homemade dipping honey mustard (which I love) and thought, oh what a good idea, I'll cook my chicken in it. Very disappointing! The flavor was bland and the cooked mayo thing was just kind of weird. Edible but will not be making again. I wound up just adding some salt to the chicken and dipping it in the regular sauce anyway.

My mustard and mayo hating kids loved this!  I cooked it exactly as directed.  With indirect grilling, this chicken did not burn at all - in fact, I put it directly over the coals for a minute at the end to brown it a bit more.  This is definitely a keeper.

This flavor is fantastic! I used my George Foreman as I saw someone else did, but it totally burned the sauce black. So that part wasn't so good, but the parts not burnt were amazing! Any suggestions on how to not burn it?

So delicious!  Like others, I doubled the marinade & used it to baste as it was grilling.  I substituted worcestershire sauce for steak sauce, and actually liberally poured it (maybe 2 tbs instead of 1 tsp, but then I'm very partial to worcestershire sauce). Used drumsticks instead of breasts. Family loved it.  Will make again for sure.

This chicken was outstanding!  I poured on the marinade after pounding my chicken breasts to an even thickness, and let it sit in the refrigerator a couple of hours.  I then basted it with more marinade near the end of grilling.  We loved the sticky, sweet, mustard kick of this dish.  Leftovers were almost as good.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a fabulous sauce.  I made sure to double the recipe to have extra for basting and dipping.  Added a tad more honey and a touch of salt for that sweet, salty, tangy flavor

A GREAT basic chicken. I used half the amount of honey and replaced mayo with non-fat plain yogurt to be healthy, and my bf and I loved it. Since I have no grill, I marinated the chicken in plastic bag for about 30 min before cooking on a stovetop oiled pan. Worked great!

Oh yeah, it's a keeper.  Fixed the sauce exactly as written.  I used breast tenderloins, put them over medium direct heat and they cooked pretty fast.  Just keep basting with this wonderful sauce until it's gone and the chicken is done.  Someday I may try spicy brown mustard for a different twist but the Dijon works great. Thanks for sharing.

We truly enjoyed this recipe. The chicken turned out moist and delicious. I used Honey Mustard instead of Dijon. It was so easy! Yum! I will use this recipe again.Thanks for sharing.

I'll keep this short and sweet: YUM! ~~**~~ OK, I have to say a bit more after all. I've not had good experiences with honey mustard chicken before, but this worked beautifully. I butterflied my breasts before I coated them in the mustard and they grilled up very quickly and stayed tender throughout. Definitely will be made again...don't really need the recipe anymore. It's that simple.

I am practically addicted to this sauce. It makes me want to lick my plate every time I make it. Very nice. I did double the sauce like others suggested & I used part of it to baste during grilling.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The flavors are great and, if cooked slowly, the chicken comes out very moist.  Save plenty of sauce for drizzling on top after serving!

Great Recipe! I would recommend that you make the Honey Mustard sauce about an hour before hand to let it all mix together. Baste for a min or so and cook one side then baste again for another min and cook the other side. Serve w/ grilled corn!!

THIS.  I swear by this recipe for the honey mustard alone! I make a batch once a week and it's awesome for dipping, serving on a baked potato, anything!    And using it on chicken is pretty darn tasty as well!

This makes a very easy and tasty marinade/sauce - probably better as a sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Didn't notice much of the honey mustard marinade flavor on the grilled chicken by itself, but we didn't baste while grilling.  It's very flavorful for dipping though!

I'm really not a huge fan of mustard but, I did enjoy this chicken. It was a nice change. Used some of the leftover in my lunch salad the next day and it was great. Will make this again.

Wonderful recipe! Very easy to make and delicious! My boyfriend and I used this recipe last night and we both wanted to eat every piece of chicken we had! :) The only differences from the original were to use Worchestershire sauce instead of steak sauce (no steak sauce at the house), thighs instead of breasts (we love dark meat!), and we let them sit in the sauce for about a half hour. As a few reviews also said, I reserved about 4 Tbsp of the sauce to drizzle on them when they came off the grill. We usually leave them cooking a bit longer so that the sauce burns itself onto the skin (I mean, we're grilling, right?!) and let me tell you, it was amazing! My boyfriend loves my cooking, but it's not often that he uses the word "ridiculous" (in a good way!). :) Thank you for sharing!

I used this as a marinate and then boiled what was leftover and used this as a sauce for the cooked chicken. It made the chicken very moist and flavorful.

This chicken is so fab. I have made this three times now and it has been great each time. Even my picky eater mother raved about how good this is. It is such a quick thing to whip up too. I did it in the morning and left marinating all day. Threw the chicken on the grill when I got home from work and got delicious moist chicken. I did baste a few times but I doubt it is even necessary. I had some of the sauce left over used it on a salad the next day. This recipe is a keeper!

This was excellent!  So delicious and moist.  The steak sauce gives it a nice kick.  I love the combination of slightly sweet and tangy.  I served this with honey roasted potatoes, (from this site), and I added dijon to the potatoes as well, and broccoli on the side.  Something new to do with chicken that will be a standard in our home.

It was good...nothing super tasty.  I think I needed to marinade it longer maybe.  It was good don't get me wrong but I was desired more flavor.  But, give it a try it's a nice alternative to regular grilled chicken.

Great sauce.  I made it as written except I used yellow mustard instead of dijon.  Was still yummy.  My husband loved it.  Good thing I made extra sauce.  I will be making this regularly.

Delicious! The perfect blend of sweet, tangy and savory elements for chicken. I made this exactly as stated, and my grilled chicken (for once) was tender and juicy. I will be making this all summer! It went well with Tangy Dill Potato Salad (which also has a tiny bit of dijon). Thank you very much!

This is THE BEST honey mustard!  Like others, I used worchestershire in place of the steak sauce..and actually, after trying it both ways, prefer the worchestershire.  I have used it on chicken, pork, turkey sandwiches...awesome!  Thanks for this great recipe!

Great recipe!  I also grilled my chicken on the George Foreman grill but I didn't close the lid on the chicken in first 15 min because I didn't want to dry it out.  Chicken came out tender and moist which was great!  I also doubled the sauce to dip the chicken in and made cajun potatoes to dip.  I wouldn't change a single thing about this recipe except that for the steak sauce, use a good hickory smoked BBQ sauce to give it that extra oomph.  Bon appetite!

Being a very lazy cook I just cooked the chicken right in the sauce in a pyrex dish on the stove top. It turned out really good and the whole family ate it, even the one year old. I would cut the chicken into smaller pieces so the sauce sinks in a bit more. Very good!

The recipe doesn't call to marinate, but I would.  Although the flavor is great, it didn't really penetrate the chicken when using the sauce merely to baste.

Super easy!  I marinated the chicken for a 1/2 hour, prepped the rest of dinner, and while the chicken cooked, I cleaned up.  I also used my George Foreman grill and it made delicious and tender chicken!

This was a delicious, moist, quick and easy recipe! The honey mustard sauce is so good, even better than a stand alone recipe that I've been using from this website! Perfect combination of ingredients! The chicken was also so moist! I followed some previous reviewers advice and marinated my chicken breasts for a couple hours, and I also did not have a grill available, so I baked the chicken at 375 for 15 minutes. It came out perfectly! My husband and I ate it as a sandwich. We had some garlic ciabatta bread, spread the extra dipping sauce and added fresh tomato, lettuce and onions. MMMM!!! This is a keeper recipe!

Ok, I made this for me, my husband, a teenager, two 6 yr olds, one 8 yr old and one 10 yr old...They all LOVED it. and I mean LOVED it! The 6 yr olds used ketchup instead of the dipping sauce, but everyone else wanted to drink that stuff. I just got on here to get the recipe again because I am making it tonight again... and everyone is so happy =) I did not have dijon mustard the first time so I used regular mustard. this time, I have the dijon so I'm curious as to the taste difference. Oh yeah, SAVE some sauce before marinating for dipping the chicken in.. THAT was the best part.

I use this marinade all the time. I love the flavor, and I always have all the ingredients on hand. My husband (who does the grilling) does complain that the marinade is messy and sticks to the grill a little bit, but I think it's worth it. I use equal parts mustard and honey (1/3 cup each) and have used both bbq sauce and worcester sauce in place of the steak sauce, since we never have steak sauce around; I really like it with worcester sauce.

Delicious!  I made this one night after work and I was surprised at how quick and easy it was.  Make sure you use the A1 sauce because it really gives it that extra zing.  Since I had some sauce left over, I used it on the side as a dipping sauce.  Depending on the thickness of the chicken, you may have to grill them a little longer than stated in the recipe.

Excellent and soooo easy to make!  Make extra sauce though for dipping after it's cooked.  I got hamburger buns and made this into chicken sandwiches for the family.  They loved it!

I thought the combination of strong flavors would be overwhelming, however this was a very subtle blend of flavors that enhanced the chicken. The flavor seemed stronger on leftovers the next day, but still not overpowering. Thanks for sharing.

I like the marinade, however I recommend using cutlets instead of breasts, so the flavor is through and through with every bite.  Thanks.

Awesome recipe!!  I bought 1lb of thin chicken breasts, let them marinate in a ziplock back for about 2 hours, then grilled and they were awesome!  For the leftover sauce, I added a little bit of Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce for dipping and it was great also!  

Thanks so much!

I used sweet and spicy brown mustard I didnt have dijon, so I pounded out the chicken and marinated half not sure how it would fly. It was great, moist flavorful not too strong. The only left overs I had was the plain chicken, even the neighbor kid liked it. Thank you will make again!

This was awesome.  Made it for my cousin and a friend.  Served with a baked potato and sauteed green beans with olive oil and garlic.  The only thing I would note is that I doubled the recipe for the sauce, and I added about a half cup more of honey, only to take the slight edge off of the mustard.  Other then that it was really good.

I don't eat meat but I made this for my boyfriend and he couldn't get enough.  He was raving about the sauce!  I didn't have Steak Sauce on hand so I omitted it, and just added some dried parsley and garlic powder into the mixture.  Then I oven baked the chicken instead of grilling it.  Came out perfect!

This is my new favorite marinade for chicken. It was very good. The first time I made it, I had to leave out the mayo due to an egg allergy. The next time I used the mayo, but I didn't notice the difference. Yummy!

Oh my yummy!!!!  I used equal parts honey and dijon mustard, and wished I had made a lot more to have some to dip the chicken in!! This was delicious, and the fact that it was so simple made it much better! Thanks for an awesome addition to my grilling recipes!  :o)

With as many ingredients that were involved with this sauce, it should have had much more taste.  I marinaded it for many hours and brushed extra sauce on during grilling, but it still turned out bland.

Turned out great one of my favorite chicken recipes for the grill. Only change was I used regular mustard since that's all I had. I also marinaded it for a day. Will make again for sure.

This is a very good, and easy recipe.  I did not have any steak sauce on hand so I used Worcestershire Sauce instead and it was great.  That is probably my new favorite honey mustard.  I made extra honey mustard

My Husband and I tried this recipe this past Friday night.  We are newly weds and we had been eating out like crazy.  We are not much of cookers but we decided to give this a try.  We loved it!! We had it with a side salad and OMG! We even had left overs which the husband had last night mixed in with a salad.  We will definitely try this one again!

The honey mustard recipe is excellent and a snap to throw together on busy weeknights. I love that there is no chopping involved and that most people already have these ingredients on hand. I used it to marinate some chicken thighs which we then grilled. The chicken was delicious and I only had time to marinate it for about an hour. We also reserved some sauce for dipping and it was very good. This will now be my go-to honey mustard recipe.

Wow--this is SO good. I made it exactly as written and put it on boneless skinless chicken thighs. It's so good it really could be used as a dipping sauce. Too bad I didn't try it until the end of grilling season :(

This was a really easy recipe that turned out perfectly. I didn't have steak sauce so I just used BBQ sauce. Delicious! It made too much sauce to use just for basting the chicken so I saved some for dipping. I will definitely make this again.

Simply Delicious! Prepared the sauce exactly as directed and loved it.  We used bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts about 1.25lbs each. We put the sauce under the skin, added a little salt & pepper, and then grilled skin side up on the charcoal grill, with a couple chunks of hickory for smoke, over indirect heat (about 400 degrees) for about 40 minutes.  Then for about 5 minutes we flipped it over direct heat to crisp the skin.  Removed and let rest for 10 minutes and then enjoyed some of the tastiest, juiciest chicken around

If you're going to make this you might want to marinate it for at least 24 hours. Mine came out flavorless.

Wow, really good!  Per the reviews, I used half of the honey and mayo required and it cooked up really well on the grill.  I'm an amateur on the grill and always, always overcook the chicken but not this time!  I'm not sure if it had anything to do with the marinade but I think it did! (I marinated the chicken for 1 1/2 hours.)  I forgot to hold out some of the sauce for dipping so I made another batch and didn't have any left over.  This is pretty mustardy but we really enjoyed it and will have it again and again!  Thank you for the post!

Wow! This chicken was really, really (yes, 2 reallys!) good! I boned out some larger drumsticks to replace the breast and added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, but, other then that, I followed the recipe exactly. This is right up there with some of the best chicken ever. The honey mustard sauce was outstanding and great as both a marinade and as a dipping sauce. I already am planning on using it as a dipping sauce for some future German brats and as a great dressing for salads. Thanks, Connie, for a simple, easy to prepare and yet outstanding recipe.

How refreshing to see a recipe introduced by a Biblical quote (sort of)!  I will definitely try this one because we eat a LOT of chicken these days, but remembering that "man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Father."  Better yet, this meal is free!

It was raining so I couldn't grill. I baked them at 375 for about an hour (the pieces were very large so if you're using smaller pieces, bake for less time). I made extra marinade to pour over finished chicken. I used Dale's steak marinade rather than steak sauce.

It was really dry and kind of bland.  I used George Foreman and used frozen chicken pieces.  If I make it next time I'll thaw the chicken all the way and try to use the grill.   I'll probably use it again because my husband liked it.

I make this monthly, we LOVE IT! I make extra sauce and set it aside for dipping. I serve this with oven roasted red potatoes with rosemary and balsamic vinegar. since its just 2 of us about 6 small taters cut in to chunks, 1/4 or less of olive oil, 2tbs of balsm. ving. and 1 stem of rosemary chopped. coat the taters, salt and pepper to your taste and bake 475 40 mins.. halfway through we start the chicken  on the grill and in 20 min dinner is done!

Very very good.  Perfect blend of tastes - just be warned it is a little messy when you first put on the grill - very wet and will drip to your grate and coals.  I think next time I will baste once the chicken breasts are on the grill rather than dip first. I accompanied this with the quick and easy home fries recipe and was enjoyed by all.  Other then that will definitely make again!

This is my favorite grilled chicken recipe! Everyone I make it for raves. I'm not real particular about the exact measurements and it doesn't seem to matter. The key appears to be the steak sauce, though. Thanks for sharing!

This honey mustard is Awesome! I was dipping everything on my plate in it. I subbed lite sour cream (plain yogurt would work too) for the mayo, cause I don't like it. Thanks for the recipe:)

I wasn't as crazy about this as it seems like most people were.  It seemed a little bland.    My family also wasn't as fond of the dijon taste - it seemed to overpower all of the other flavors.  5/21/14 Tried this again substituting Guldens spicy mustard and we liked it much better than the version with the dijon.

Easiest recipe ever! I did not have dijon mustard so mixed 1/3 cup regular mustard with 3 tbsp wasabi horseradish along with the other ingredients. Marinated the chicken for five hours in the fridge before grilling. The chicken came out so tender and juicy - was a hit with the (picky) family. Great recipe, will make this one again

Really yummy! I had a package of bone-in chicken thighs. so I used the recipe to marinade them for about 30 minutes and baked at 375 for about 20 minutes and finished them on the gas grill. Tasted great, everyone loved it, tangy and a little sweet. Double the recipe to use the sauce for dipping.

SOLID recipe, and believe me, we tried as hard as we could to screw it up. We couldn't keep the grill lit, and after an hour of trying, we finally just stuck'm in the oven for about 45 minutes. Still delicious!

Delicious recipe!  Couple this with the video on how to grill chicken, and you will end up with yummy, perfectly grilled, moist chicken.  This is our marinade from now on!  We did not have steak sauce, so we followed another reviewer's advice and used worcestershire sauce instead.  Still divine!  Give this recipe a try.  You won't be sorry.

Easy, simple and  tasty recipe! 
Marinated chicken breast & thighs overnight.
Thighs were more flavorful. 
Will definitely make again!

This a decent recipe.   Not a "wow the company" kind of a dish but a tasty slant on chicken especially if you're already a honey mustard fan.   The sauce is great and is perfect just for salad.   The nice thing about it is that you'll likely always have these ingredients in the kitchen and can whip this up on the fly.

I should probably not review this recipe.  I'm sure many of you that have given it 5 stars really loved it, but I'm going to give my honest opinion.  First, there are so many steak sauces, and no specific sauce was noted.  A-1; Heinze 57; and many more.  I sprayed my grill with Pam, but the chicken still stuck and I had a horrible time getting it cleaned.  Even though I clean the grill while it's still hot I had to soak the grids to get it clean.  I really didn't have a flavor pop with this recipe.  BTW, I tenderized the chicken for a more tender result. Maybe I used the wrong steak sauce.

Tried this last night! It was fantastic. Modified a bit to use what I had on hand. Used horseradish mustard mixed with yellow mustard and used bbq sauce instead of steak sauce. I had more chicken so I didn't dip. I just basted while on the grill.  Mmmmm. I even have a honey mustard hater and she liked it. Will definitely have this again! Thanks!

I made this with leg quarters as it was what I had and I used fat free mayo. It was so good. As suggested by others I doubled the sauce and used some for dipping. Definitely a good idea. The sauce is great. I had to cook the leg quarters longer but that was because of what it was. Will definitely make again and maybe with other meats. I think this would be good on anything.

Love this.  I didn't have steak sauce so I used worcestershire sauce like some of the other people reccommended and it came out delicious!  Made extra sauce for dipping.  Will make it again!

When I started this recipe, I made the sauce first and then went to get the chicken...not realizing that I had no chicken (haven't been to the store in a LONG time). So, I used the sauce for steak that I DID have. :) Salt and peppered the steaks and grilled them, applying the sauce as they grilled. It turned out great! When will I ever learn to check before I cook? I get so carried away :) Thanks for this recipe!

Really good chicken. I'm not a huge honey mustard fan as a dipping sauce, but this made a fantastic marinade/glaze for grilled chicken.  A key note for me (and I'm putting in my review as a reminder for myself) is not to turn the chicken on the grill until it can be turned without sticking.  Oiling the grill beforehand might also help with the sticking.  I always end up with torn up chicken when I make this because the sauce is so sticky and I get impatient and turn the chicken too soon.

This is good, although quite sweet as written.  I ended up cutting the honey by about 1 T. and adding a bit more mayo to compensate. Works well for chicken skewers, too.

Absolutely loved this sauce! I let the sauce marinade for about half hr before cooking, I didn't grill the chicken either I just put it in a baking dish and coating it with the sauce, turning and coating half way through (2o min). Mmmmm delish!

I left these marinate for about 3 hours.  DH  grilled tonight, and I think for appearance sake, they could have had more grill marks, but who cares...they sure tasted good, and isn't that what really matters???

Made with regular mustard instead of dijon, no steak sauce, added cumin.  Dipped chicken in this then breaded in bread crumbs.  Crumbs were a bit heavy, next time panko crumbs.

The sauce alone is amazing. We have used the sauce on chicken breast, wings, and pork chops. This was exactly what we were looking for.

I only gave this 3 stars as this did not turn out very well at all.  The sauce was great, chicken I cooked on the George Foreman according to directions, but the sauce seemed to have burnt onto the chicken and I had to scrape it away.  After doing this, the chicken did taste good, was moist and the sauce was good.  I just could not make this work.

Great recipe! I didn't have stake sauce so used worcestershire sauce. Easy, fast grilling! Will pass this to family and friends. Boneless, skinless, chic can be dry if your not careful, but this sauce left it very moist. Remember to save some for dipping! Use as directed, 5 stars

My husband said these were "fantastic." Coming frome someone who detests most chicken with any type of seasoning means a lot. I used KC Barbeque sauce. Made exactly as is using indirect heat as stated. Moist and soooo good. Served with Dad's Pan-Fried Green Beans and Big B's Collard Green.

I made this two nights ago and we all loved it!  The chicken breasts were huge so there was a lot left over.  I thought "Great, we can have a second dinner from it, maybe salad!"  However, I got lazy last night and pulled some tortillas, lettuce and coleslaw out of the fridge and threw together some delicious wraps!  Wonderful recipe.  Thanks!

I thought this was pretty good. I honestly couldn't taste any real distinct flavor in this chicken, but I liked how moist it stayed. It only had an over so slight sweetness from the juice when cutting. I would definitely save some of the honey mustard for dipping if that flavor is desired. These would be good on a sandwich too, I think. ty

Made this tonight for 4 boys and husband, they loved it and told me I needed to start bottling the stuff.  I flattened chicken breasts a little, grilled and basted.  I  also made extra to serve with it at dinner and it was completely gone. I added a little more of mayo and and used French' s honey dijon mustard!!! Great!!!

Excellent recipe!! I used the costco skinless, boneless breasts, and used worchestire instead of steak sauce, olive oil mayo instead of regular.

This cooked so quick and moist on my George Foreman Grill.  Paired it with fresh, grilled zuchinni spears. 

Super easy and super tasty.

Freezer to grill in about 30minutes: I used the frozen chicken breasts that come in a bag. I forgot to thaw them, so I ran them under water to remove the ice glaze, then continue to run them under warm/hot water for a couple of minutes until only the centers were still frozen. Placed them on the lowest heat setting on a gas grill until fully thawed, flipping once. Then turned heat up and cooked according to recipe. Chicken was juicy. 

My boyfriend complained the sauce smelled horrible, but once he tried the finished product he said he'd eat it again. This recipe wasn't amazing, but it's a nice change from bbq chicken.

What a quick & easy recipe! Followed to the letter, even though I was a little skeptical about not marinating beforehand. This made enough for 3 super large chicken breasts to baste throughout the grilling process & then to add on top afterwards. The chicken was so moist and juicy. Full of flavor! I served with fried potatoes & fresh corn. Great, quick summer meal.

Definitely need to do this on indirect heat or you will get charred flesh on the chicken.  You will get GREAT grill marks as long as you keep it on indirect heat.

The sauce for the chicken is very flavorful.  I went lighter on the mayo because I don't like it that much.  The mayo clumped up a little bit in the sauce, but as long as you wisk it together really well then it won't get clumpy.

I made this as a "hurry up dish" when I had unexpected company for dinner.  I used honey dijon mustard cause I couldn't find my honey and added a bit of worcestershire...I also pound the chicken breasts before cooking, to tenderize and so that they are the same thickness for even cooking.  Also they grill up alot quicker.  Very good easy recipe that everyone, even the kids enjoyed.

This turns out each time. So moist and flavorful! I usually marinade overnight and or at least a few hours. Perfect!

Enjoyed this a lot- I did pound the chicken to make it grill more evenly and it turned out better than most of our grilled chicken which we tend to overcook out of fear of undercooking! I think the sauce helped protect it from getting all burned.  We served it with some grilled asparagus with a dijon vinaigrette. Yum!

Easy and tasty.  I had a bit of trouble with my grill and had super thick chicken breasts so it took a bit longer and I had to cook over direct vs indirect heat but the result was very moist and tasty. Even my 3yo daughter gobbled it up ... with a little of extra honey mustard that I had reserved for dipping.

This was so easy and so awesome.  I didn't have dijon so I used regular mustard.  I only made 2 large chicken breast but made the recipe as it was written cause i basted the chicken alot during the cooking process and I served it on the side as a dip for the chicken.  We will make this again and again.

This is easy and awsome. Do yourself a favor and double the honey mustard portions and keep the extra in the fridge. It is great on salad or as a dipping sauce.

Amazing! Simple and great! I did do the Worcestershire as I didn't have steak sauce but it was all just soooo tasty. I added cayenne to some for heat and with or without - still a very tasty dish. :)

This simple sauce is delicious and grills well. The sauce, though made with just a few simple ingredients, really has some depth, and my husband loved it. I marinated chicken legs, thighs, and wings and salmon in this sauce for a couple hours before grilling. Reserve some sauce for dipping. Also good on baked potatoes. I will definitely make again.

Delicious!   Added a tablespoon more honey and an extra tablespoon of mayo for the dipping sauce.  Marinated for four hours, and then used the George Foreman for about 15 minutes.  Everyone in the family loved it!

The BEST honey mustard chicken I've had!  I followed the recipe other than subbing regular mustard for dijon.  Still delicious!  I doubled the marinade to use some for basting and the rest for dipping sauce.  I used chicken tenderloins which grilled fast and were still perfect and juicy!

This is a family favorite. I use worchestershire sauce instead of steak sauce because I usually don't have steak sauce and I use whatever mustard I have on hand. It's great on the grill but I usually cut the chicken into 1 inch pieces and cook it in a pan indoors, adding the sauce in the last few minutes. It only takes about 15 minutes from start to finish when I cook it that way.

Easy to make and very tasty!  Cleanup was also great, considering it's cooked on the grill.  I wasn't totally blown away by this recipe, but it was very good (and kid friendly).  I will be making it again!

Simple and tasty.  Nothing outstanding but nice change from BBQ sauce etc.  Maybe next time I'll add some spiciness.

The marinating sauce was absolutely amazing. I actually made up extra just to have on hand for dipping and add for a chicken salad. This was really easy, it was delish! I butterflied my chicken breast just to have them cook quicker on the grill, but other then that. Nice sauce, nice flavor. Yummy!

Easy, quick, no marinading required.  Very tasty.  Perfect for lunch.  Added a tablespoon + of hot sauce the last few times and it gave it just enough heat to compliment the sweet.

This was so good!  The first time I tried it on the grill my chicken got burnt and had to be thrown out.  I tried it again the next night in the oven.  I cooked the chicken at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.  It came out so moist and tender.  Definitely make extra honey mustard to put on the chicken once it's done.   My daughter who is so picky, actually ate this.  I will definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe to the T and enjoyed it quite a bit!  I made sure to baste the chicken frequently as it cooked which really helped impart a wonderful flavor.

LOVED! This was a great recipe for our family’s Independence Day celebration. I really loved how easy the recipe was to make, especially as a busy Mom. I served this with corn-on-the-cob, grilled peaches, creamy new potatoes/peas, and a cold veggie/pasta salad. Definitely a keeper in our home. Thanks!

Awesome and so easy to make (though not clean)!  The sauce as listed tasted a little too sweet to me (could be because I used Dijonnaise instead of dijon and mayo) so I used extra dijonnaise, more steak sauce, a little pepper, and some Worcestershire.  So simple and very tasty, except that our electric grill is almost impossible to clean - keep that in mind.

I am not a big fan of honey mustard so it wasn't as amazing to me as it was to my husband and daughter. But, my tiny husband probably had 3 breasts and my really picky 6 year old scarfed it down so they loved it. Like others have said the dipping sauce makes the dish!

This was a very easy & quick recipe. The sauce turned out perfect, it had a little zest bust was still sweet. I marinated the chicken for one hour before putting it on the grill. Once I took it off the grill, I basted the chicken with more sauce. My guests are still talking about it today. Two Thumbs up!

This was amazing in taste and ease. I watched my family smile when they bite into the chicken. Next time, I will let it marinade longer to get the flavor throughout the chicken.

I used 1/2 cup Dijonaisse instead of Dijon and Mayo. I am not usually a fan of grilled chicken, but this was really tasty and the chicken was actually moist. I did marinate in the fridge for an hour or so prior to grilling. For something so easy and relatively low in fat it was excellent. I plan to use this all summer. 7/27/10: I have now made  this 5 or 6 times EXACTLY as written and it turns out great every time. The leftovers are perfect for salads, wraps or stir-fry. I think the small amount of mayo is just enough to seal in the juices without adding too much fat. I am so happy to have found this recipe.

Followed this recipe exactly and it really wasn't that good.  My husband felt is wasn't even worth messing with a second time and told me to just find another honey mustard recipe to try.  No outstanding taste and the grilled mayo was just wierd.

Delicious! I didn't have any steak sauce so I used some homemade bbq sauce instead. Still gave it a nice little zip. I saved a little bit of the sauce to serve over top of the chicken at the end. I would have liked it to be a little sweeter and a little less mustardy so next time I will probably up the honey 1/3 cup.

This couldn't be easier to make.  I used low-fat mayo but otherwise made no changes.  I put the sauce together in the morning and let the chicken marinate all day to give it extra flavor.  Great!

I was looking for any easy, quick, tasty grilled chicken to take camping. Easy and quick this was, tasty not so much. It was pretty bland to us, and didn't get very high reviews from anyone who tried it.

Followed the recipe with suggestions from others, grilled on med. heat. The chicken turned out moist and tender, everyone that came to dinner complimented me on the dish. I personally thought I added just a touch too much mustard but I was the only one that thought that so it must have just been me. I also served Baby red potatoes with Garlic, Basil & Thyme, sweet onion rings atop-roasted. The wine was a Washington wine- Chateau Ste Michelle-Horse Heaven vineyard- Sauvignon Blanc, it complimented the chicken with a soft hint of pear & grapefruit, with crisp texture. The wine was chilled to about 52 degrees. For desert I poured a chilled Gewurztraminer ice wine into Belgium dark chocolate cups. I got 5 stars from my guests.

This is incredible!  I love this sauce.  I whipped this up in no time and had the chicken sit in it for about an hour or less and it was so flavorful.  I used chicken tenders, so they really soaked up the flavor!  The extra sauce that I pulled aside is a perfect dipping sauce!  Thanks for a superb recipe!  This will definitely be made again and again, especially this summer!

So I usually rate these recipes, but this one I had to especially review. OMG, I am a chicken lover, always have been and always will be, but this was one of the best flavorings in chicken. EVER. I did marinate it for about 20 minutes and cut chicken before hand, but it was still tender and absolutly running in the mouth with tons of flavor. I actually made the chicken and cooked a pasta dish with tomatoes and artichoke hearts and made a quick sauce and with the chicken it was even better. Alone or mixed in with pasta dishes. Amazing. This will definitly be saved. Loved it.

My wife is on a diet and chicken is a big part of her diet. She had made mention that she was "chicken'd out" . I wasn't listening at the time and planned the days meals and planned on using this recipe on of couse CHICKEN when I remembered that she was "chicken'd out", I then changed plans and pulled out of the freezer some Pollack filets and coated and breaded with them with seasoned bread crumbs and baked at 350 for about 10 minutes. Just as incrediable as the chicken recipe

this was awesome. I love this honey mustard. I made way more than the recipe called for and I used it on sandwiches all week. I marinated the chicken in this for maybe an hour first, and then cooked it on the stove. Easy, cheap, and yummy. I will be making this again.

This is THE best honey mustard sauce.  Make sure you double the recipe for the sauce because you will definitely want to use it for dipping.  I also like to make enough that I can cut up the chicken over a romaine/spinach  salad the next day and use the sauce as dressing.  The only change I made is using worchestershire in place of the steak sauce. This is part of the regular dinner rotations at our house!

Amazingly good! My boyfriend made this for me and it came out so flavorful. It is simple to make. He ended up using regular mustard because he didn't know we had dijion mustard. This will definitely be a recipe we will make again!

This was very good.  I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo since that is what we always have on hand and also used Heinz steak sauce...I mean I am from Pittsburgh.  I didn't marinade, just used as a glaze on the grill then a dipping sauce when serving.  Will make this one of my go-to recipes.

Very easy to make which gets extra points from me on a busy school/work night. Followed the recipe exactly, except used chicken tenders on the Forman Indoor/Outdoor Grill. Even the picky 7 year old son loved it. Thanks for sharing.

I am not sure if one more review is needed for this very tasty recipe!  I made the sauce with slight alterations due to ingredients on hand: I used almost all Dijon mustard but had to supplement with a bit of German Hot Mustard, I didn't have chicken breasts but used thighs, bone in and skin on. I probably added a bit more mayo and used HP sauce instead of steak sauce.  There was more than enough sauce for four chicken thighs, so before I mixed it with the chicken, I put about half of it into a container with two small pork boneless steaks, still frozen, for supper the next night. I ended up roasting the chicken for about 40 minutes at 350 and didn't feel the need to baste.  It was tender and delicious, and I do think would have been even better if cooked on the BBQ.  Also, the sauce by itself is terrific and would be great as a dip or as a spread in a sandwich. It was also very good with the pork which was BBQ'd. Definitely to be made again in our house.  Thank you tahoegirl.

4 stars for the original recipe - 5 stars for my adjustments. Add a couple dashes Worcestershire sauce, ground mustard, one dash tabasco, some ground pepper. But the absoloute key to delicious chicken is boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts. Marinate for four hours. Simply delicious and the best chicken I have ever made. Baste with the marinade every time you flip on the grill. I have made this about 20 times now with perfect results.

Yum!!  What a quick, easy way to cook chicken breasts!  This would be delicious with both boneless and bone-in breasts...or any cut of chicken really.  The only change I made was to increase the amount of mayonnaise (I doubled it to counteract the spiciness of my Dijon mustard); I also marinated my breasts some of the Dijon mixture for about an hour before grilling - the end result was just delicious and we'll definitely make it again!

Yummy! The marinade is delicious. I grilled the chicken on a George Foreman grill, so one suggestion if you're doing it that way: the outside burns very easily. Marinate the chicken but try not to have excess sauce on the chicken when you grill it on the Foreman. Instead, add more to it right before you serve it. We had extra marinade left over, and we used it for a veggie dip!

Great recipe! Made a mixed plate of pork loin chops and chicken breasts using the same recipe. I didn't have any mayo so I used vegetable oil instead. Used my own homemade Jack Daniels mustard. Everyone loved it! Next time I will try the Dijon. Thanks!

Very good!  A nice change of pace for grilled chicken.  Followed the recipe to a tee and think I would actually marinate the chicken next time.  Quick and easy, and love the fact that I always have these ingredients on hand.

I didn't have any steak sauce, so I used Worcestershire instead.  What an excellent sauce!  I'm glad I'm made extra as suggested by other reviewers because it also made an excellent salad dressing.

The honey mustard marinade/sauce is just right! The grilled chicken was good...but the next night I tossed it with some romaine lettuce and salad fixins and used the sauce as a salad dressing, and this was a phenomenal combination. Will definitly use this again for chicken salads and the dressing will go into my salad dressing folder to use again.  Thanks for the post.

Easy and delicious! My family loved it! I, like others, also used worscestershire sauce instead of the steak sauce. Next time I'm going to kick it up with a dash of cayenne pepper and try it on grilled pork chops! Yummy

I had to bake this recipe. However I added a few touches of my own (squeeze of orange and sprinkle of basil.) and it came out so wonderful!! It was very sweet and had a Hawaiian flavor. I recommend this recipe.

My husband usually doesn't like chicken breasts.  His comment on this one was that it was "moist and flavorful"  that means it was a hit.
The only thing I did differently was to baste the chicken breasts with the marinade about an hour before I put them on the grill.
I will be making this again.

WOW! This recipe rocks! My kids requested it three days in a row! I let it marinate for only 20 minutes or less. Tasted great! Thanks! I forgot to say that I used regular mustard, it's all I had, and still it was great!`

I'm not the biggest honey mustard fan, but I thought I'd give this a try, and I must say I'm impressed. I used drumsticks for the recipe, and grilled them on my gas grill for about 45 minutes. They turned out perfect: crispy on the outside, and juicy and delish on the inside. This recipe is definately a keeper. :)

This was delicious... I didn't change a thing the first time I made it and it came out perfect, but I agree with the others who said you should double the batch of sauce- it's great for dipping, too. Yum!

I was looking a a different sauce for BBQ chicken than the typical red sauce and this was it.  I used agave nectar in place of the honey.  Refrigerated the chicken with marinate for 1 hour prior to grilling.  The mustard flavor was strong but easily controlled by adding a tad more agave.

This recipe is WONDERFUL! Made these for dinner last night and WOW! Delicious and easy. I only did one thing the recipe doesn't call for and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder. This recipe will be a staple in my household from now on!

I was looking for something new to try and happened upon this recipe. I actually had to substitute a couple of the ingredients--worcestershire for steak sauce, and sweet hot mustard instead of dijon--and it still turned out great. I also added a clove of garlic. I'll definitely be making this again! :) Next time I hope to have the the right ingredients. haha

I cooked this in the oven, instead of the grill. It couldn't have been better. My kids who don't like anything wanted more. This was one dinner where we didn't have any leftovers.

This is wonderful! I didn't have Dijon Mustard so I used regular mustard. It was still really good. I even use the sauce on its own as a dip!! Yum!

The Honey Mustard that is created is the best I have ever tasted. Make sure to make a little extra of it to cover the chicken after it comes off the grill. My girlfriend loved this dish!

Great honey mustard recipe. I followed it exactly and I really liked the tang the steak sauce gives it. I grilled the chicken on my George Foreman and served with Cheddar Broccoli rice on the side.

This was YUMMY!  We were tired of our normal recipes and are so glad we ventured out and tried something new!  We had some leftover and so the next day I sliced up the cold pieces and put them over a big salad.  It was delicious!  We will definitely make this again and again.

This is the first five star rating my boyfriend has ever given !!  A nice subtle flavor all the way through the chicken, though I only marinated for about 1/2 hr.  I did forget to reserve some marinade to baste/dip with, but still turned out very moist.  I will definately make again.  Thanks!!

This was a hit, even my kids loved it.  Very easy, obviously just adjust cooking time to your grill.  I only had to cook about 15 minutes...I had small chicken breasts, so it was only about 6 minutes per side.

This was fantastic.  The dipping sauce is a must.  I brushed each piece of chicken with the reserved sauce just before serving.  It makes a HUGE difference in flavor.  I always test recipes before serving to guests.  This one is definitely guest worthy.

This is the absolute best honey mustard my husband or I have ever tried.  We followed the recipe to the letter (using A1 as our steak sauce - our favorite) and cooked our chicken on an indoor grill pan.  There was plenty of sauce left for basting and drizzling over the chicken once it was done cooking.  My husband ate all the chicken I made, even the pieces intended for leftovers the next day.  This recipe is definitely a keeper in our house!

This was very yummy.  I cut up the chicken and marinaded it for several hours.  I then grilled as kabobs.  I served it for a girlfriend party so I had to make it the next night for my family.

YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!  This was so delicious! I can't wait to make it again.  Next time I will marinate the chicken as other reviewers suggested.  The only change I made was to do equal amounts of mustard and honey....I like my honey mustard a little on the sweet side.  I made 6 chicken breasts and there wasn't enough sauce left to dip........next time I will definitely make extra. Can't wait to make this again next week!

Excellent and quick. I doubled the recipe for my family of 4 and they were begging for more.  Will definitely become a regular meal at our house.

I will definitely be revisiting this one! I have a super picky eater; he prefers his chicken plain, absolutely nothing on it. He ate this and really liked it! Even asked for seconds! I actually baked this, rather than grilled it and it still came out great.

Super easy and fast - I usually have all these ingredients on hand and since this doesn't require marinating it is excellent for a weeknight dinner even when you don't have time to plan.  I paired this with butternut squash quinoa pilaf and grilled asparagus.  Delicious!

I love it when I find a recipe that doesn't need to be tweaked.  My family inhaled this. No left overs to be had.  The chicken breasts I buy are very large so I cut them in half. There was plenty of marinade to cover the chicken and separated for basting.  I think I could have added a couple extra breasts to the marinade and there still would have been good coverage.  This is going to be a repeat meal this summer!

This was very easy to make, but I felt it needed a little bit more flavor. Next time, I'll have to add a little extra flavor.

Really easy & tasty! Made double the honey mustard sause to really coat the chicken. Coated chicken with sause on every flip on the bbq! Fantastic! This will be a regular in the dinner line up.

This was great! I made this on our Weber gas grill, turned off the center burner, the chicken was done in 18 minutes. I flattened them to one half inch thickness so they would cook evenly. There are only two of us so I cut the ingredients in half. Other then that I made it just as written. It's a keeper, will definitely make again.

Delish! We had 4 really large chicken breasts, so I butterflied them and pounded them down a little. I used more mayo than what the recipe called for to give it more of a zing. I also used spicy brown ballpark style mustard. The steak sauce threw me, but don't leave it out! It ads a nice depth of flavor.

The remaining sauce I thinned down a little, and my son asked to use it for chicken nuggets the next day.

Love that I have all of these ingredients on hand too. A working mommas dream! ;)

I'm no grilling expert, but this was SO easy - I didn't have time to let it marinate and it still turned out moist inside and flavorful all the way through. I followed other reviewers' advice and added 2 tbsp Worcestershire, which kicked up the flavor. Will definitely make it a lot this summer!

This was awesome! My wife hates chicken, doesn't matter who makes it or where it's from and she loved it (her words not mine)! There were only a couple things I changed. I double the sauce, used chicken thighs (because breasts are over rated and dry), and I marinated them in the fridge for about 3 hours before hand. If i hadn't had the time to go the fridge route i would have done 30 min on the counter top.

Family loved this recipe.  I used 4 bone in chicken legs and 2 bone in breasts which I had removed the skin from.  My DH said it really tasted like a BBQ chicken.  Made as is with not changes.  Will be making again.

I really liked the sauce and I don't even like Dijon mustard. I didn't have steak sauce so I used Worcestershire as other suggested.

LOVE THIS!!  I also use Worcestershire Sauce instead of steak sauce.  Have made this many times.  Most recent time was hands down the best.  I used frozen chicken breasts and threw everything into the crockpot....cooked on high for 4 hours, shredded chicken and put it back in on low until we were ready to eat.  Also used a little bit more honey.  It was so good!!

Love the flavor. I tend to marinade this chicken for at least 8 hours. I tried it at 4 hours the first time, which resulted in a good flavor but not much depth. Since then, it has always been 8 to 12 hours with awesome results. We usually grill some onion and asparagus with it. Delicious meal.

My family and I LOVED IT!!!!I did add sliced Green onions. Put it in a ziplock and marinated it then had to throw it in freezer for a couple of days. Thawed it out and grilled it basting every time I  turned it and added garlic pepper on side while on the grill. It was wonderful!!!! Will make again and try it in the oven next time. Make extra sauce for the rice and salad. BTW, I used 8 smaller breast halves and it came out perfect!!

This was yummy.  I grilled the chicken until nearly done THEN basted with the honey mustard so that it REALLY stuck.  I'll make this again. We were pleased.

Delicious and easy weeknight recipe!  I used A1 sauce for the steak sauce and it was really good.  Next time I'll try marinating the chicken beforehand for even more flavor!  :)

This is a great chicken recipe! I always love honey mustard with chicken and really wanted to eat more healthy foods. Even the little picky eaters in the house loved it. This is an easy recipe to make and will definitely be a regular in our house.

I make this all the time now!  Husband, kids and I all love it.  I usually arinate the chicken for a half hour or so and then grill it (I poke holes in the chicken so it really absorbs the flavor). The sauce is also great as a salad dressing or a dip.

This recipe was fantastic & the sauce gave a great flavor to the chicken. I took it up a notch and, after grilling, topped each breast with about 1/4 cup of sautéed sliced mushrooms, 2 slices of cooked bacon & a slice of cheddar cheese. Put it in the broiler just long enough to melt the cheese.  It was awesome!!!

Delicious! Didn't have steak sauce either so used recipe for steak sauce from Ron Shepherd on this site. UNBELIEVABLE!! And saving some of the sauce for dipping is a must! It's an incredible honey mustard dip. I marinated thin cutlets for a bit (maybe half hr?) and grilled on a grill pan w flame on super low. Yummmmmm

I used 2lbs. chicken tenders & doubled the sauce, using 1.5 recipes as the marinade & .5 as a drizzle before serving. Grilled them on medium high heat for 2 min per side. The honey carmalized on the grill and gave the chicken the most incredible flavor!! This recipe is a keeper!

While you've got the grill going, make more that you can eat in one meal.  It is just as good reheated in the microwave.  I asked my husband to do this on the charcoal grill, as the charcoal adds great flavor.  I'll be making this again for sure.  It's a great "company" dish.

Tasty.  Allowed chicken to sit and marinate maybe 20 minutes while preparing other things. My husband did an awesome job of not overcooking it! ;-)

This is a great way to cook chicken. I used my George Foreman grill and it came out juicy and delicious. I made extra sauce for dipping as well. Thank you for submitting it.

I made some changes to reduce calories but the concept is wonderful so I gave it 5 stars.  Used spicy brown instead of Dijon mustard, light agave syrup instead of honey, only 1 TBLS of light mayo, 2 tsp of Worcestershire instead of steak sauce.  I marinated for at least an hour.  My whole family loved it!  Thank you for giving me the baseline with no garlic (mother allergic )!

The flavor from this was very mellow, hardly distinguishable.   However, it did not detract from the chicken either, which is a good thing.

Excellent!  I put aluminum foil on my grill, poked some holes in it, then sprayed them with vegetable spray.  THEN I lit the BBQ and put it on high.  Instead of steak sauce, I used Peter Luger's brand.  When I put the marinated chicken on the grill, I turned the heat down to medium, 10 minutes on each side.  I topped it off with a little marinate before serving.  EXCELLENT.  Not overcooked, not raw, not boring!  Will make it again!

Tried this for the first time today.  We love chicken on the grill and I'm always looking for ways to mix it up. I went a little lighter on the honey.  Turned out really well.  Simple but really pops with flavor.

This was delicious but I added salt, pepper, garlic salt, onion powder and little brown sugar before dipping the chicken in the sauce. Since it's a little cold outside, I used the George Foreman grill. Delicious will make again!

Delish! I now use this marinate all the time for chicken breasts! So moist and juicy without over powering honey mustard flavor. Still can taste the chicken. Big hit with entire family. Didn't change this recipe at all.

Delicious! We grilled the chicken after marinating it for several hours, it was very moist and tender. The marinade is absolutely delicious, made me want to lick my plate!

Made this two days in a row. Did'nt have steak sauce, so I just used honey barbeque sauce. Best part, the sauce absorbed quickly into the chicken!

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes....I always make extra sauce for dipping....it is sooooo good! I have grilled this & also baked this...taste great both ways...I make this chicken recipe often...usually pair it with a baked potato because the sauce tastes great with potato too!  Husband loves it so its a keeper.

I really liked this recipe...I made the sauce, and put the chicken right in it.  Then, I put the chicken on the grill. I only basted a little bit...it didn't really need a whole lot of basting.  The sauce does tend to run, and quite a bit fell through the grill grates, but the taste was very good!

This sauce is wonderful and I've made it three times on breasts, thighs and tilapia. Kids love it. I have tomatoe allergies, so use Worcestershire sauce as a steak sauce replacement. Comments concerning the plain taste of the chicken...well marinate your chicken first, for a few hours. Basting sauces baste the outside, not the inside. Don't expect miracles. I typically use Dave's seasoning salt, olive oil, Worcestershire and apple juice as a chicken/steak marinade. Never had a "plain" complaint.

Although the flavor was good, it was surprisingly milder than I expected. Through serendipity I found that a squeeze of lime on each breast really helps. (I would have expected it to overpower the coating, but instead it brings out the flavor.)

I ended up having to pan fry mine indoors on a grill pan but I think it actually worked out well as the honey mustard couldn't really drip off the chicken but rather the chicken simmered in the sauce that was on the bottom of the pan.

So yummy and moist.  I did use my homemade jalapeno mustard along with the mayo and omitted the steak sauce.  I used chicken with the bone and skin on too.  Probably not the best for your health but the taste was delish!

My family loves this quick and easy recipe!!  The honey mustard is absolutely wonderful!  I don't normally have steak sauce on hand, so I tried the suggestion of using Worchestershire sauce instead and it works beautifully.

This was awesome!  Way better than I expected.  I'm not a huge fan of Dijon mustard, so I used a little less than half yellow mustard, the rest Dijon, for the mustard that's called for.  I think the Dijon in there made it more "robust" tasting than if I'd have used all yellow mustard, but was still subtle enough that I liked it.  We will make this again FOR SURE.

I absolutely love this recipe. This recipe was a hit with all the picky eaters in my family. The only changes I made was that baked it instead of grilled (because of the weather) and I used chicken thighs instead of breast (My grandmother doesn't like chicken breast).I can not wait until I can fire up the grill so I can have my grilled honey mustard chicken. Thank Connie for this wonderful recipe.

This was really simple and good.  Strangely, the dominant taste for me was the mayo - which usually would be a problem because I don't like mayonnaise, but it worked.  I don't know what other kinds of steak sauce there are, but I used HP Sauce.

My mom and I tried cooking this for  this tonight on our indoor George Foreman for the three of us. While it was delicious, we found that the chicken breast pieces turned out a little dry. If anyone can let me know how to fix this when making in the future, I'd appreciate it!

This chicken was amazing.  I made the marinade exactly according to the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing.  It would even be good on a salad as a honey mustard dressing.  My family couldn't get enough. Thanks!

What a strange list of ingredients! But do NOT let that scare you. Delicious chicken.  Don't let your chicken overlook or burn. Longer and slower is better in my opinion.

This recipe had a funny effect.  All those in the family who love chicken, did not care for this recipe.  But for those in the family, ie hubby and son, who are tierd of chicken loved this recipe.

The perfect combination of yummy, easy and quick.  My teen son loved it.  It was cold and rainy so I baked it covered in the oven.  Very tender chicken.  Served it with baked potatoe, asparagus and cornbread-yum!  Would be great with rice or egg noodles to serve the sauce on.  I'll try it on the grill per request of my son.  It would also be good with pork chops.  Thanks!

The honey mustard sauce is truely great... I could think of a ton of things it would be good on... I would recommend letting the chicken marinate in the sauce to really get filled with flavor.... good recipe though... I am definitely going to remember the honey mustard sauce...

I make extra and keep it in my fridge so its on hand when I need it. Its great to baste on grilled chicken wings or chicken breasts. I have used a variety of steak sauces and marinades all with good success. This is a great alternative when you are sick of BBQ sauce all the time.

If you're in the mood for honey mustard chicken, this is a legitimate receipe.  I used spicey brown mustard in lieu of dijon (my family doesn't care for horseradish, which is almost always found in dijon mustard), and I substituted worcestershire for steak sauce (since that's what I had on hand).  I marinaded the chicken in the honey mustard mixture for about 7 hours, then grilled it to juicy perfection.

This was very good.  I sliced the chicken breasts into strips and it worked out great.  I think it wouldn't have been enough flavor throughout if I had just dipped the breast and cooked it whole.

The sauce is a 5, the chicken a 4.5. I marinated the chicken in some of the sauce overnight but it really did not seem to pick up any flavor.  Reserving sauce for dipping is the way to go!

I never review the recipes i try but this one was amazing.  I totally agree with the reviewers that suggested worchestire sauce instead of steak sauce.  it added something special to the whole thing.  will definitely make it again.

I fixed this for my family last night and it was really good!  I used Worchester as the steak sauce, and sprinkled a little Lawry's Seasoned Salt & Pepper for an added flavor.  I would recommend making an extra batch of the honey mustard sauce.  My kids loved drizzling the sauce over their chicken.  Good stuff!

I made this for dinner this week using chicken thighs, I doubled the sauce and marinated the chicken for 4 hrs. My husband loved it and wants me to make it again. Make sure you do it over indirect heat. Some of my chicken got charred but as it cooled I removed the charred and it was still good. I admit to getting impatient when grilling.

This was delicious!  So simple to put together and my family loved it. I too kept out a little of the marinade for dipping. This is definitely a new staple to our family meals list.

Wonderful recipe. I love simple recipes that call for ingredients I already have in my kitchen. Although I don't have any steak sauce, so I used BBQ sauce instead. I cooked the whole dinner on the grill with cubed, seasoned potatoes, and pineapple rings. The tang of this sauce works very well on the grill. I will definitely make it again.

Very good and simple, however it makes much more than needed for 4 breasts. I reserved the extra for another time.

LOVED this recipe! It was easy and quick and tasted so Yummy! The only changes I made were really small... I added just a tad of seasoning to the chicken while cooking and I added about 2 tbsp of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. I also didn't bother using the big grill outside I used our indoor grill/griddle we have but the chicken tasted like it came off the grill outside. It was SO good! I highly recommend it if you want a taste of BBQ!

Great recipe!  Very easy sauce to make and it was delicious on the chicken.  For those that might want more honey mustard taste, make a little extra sauce for dipping.

Pretty darn good the first time I cooked it. I prepared it as written and enjoyed it. However I kicked it up last night and made a few changes. I replaced honey with blue agave (I did equal amounts I like the some sweetness). Then I halved the Mayo and added 2 tablespoons of homemade chipotle barbeque sauce (this can be easily substituted with store bought, I like the Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet Chipotle if I am am out of our homemade batch). It really added a few more layers of flavor.

Been making a version of this for years but it is even better with pine nuts, if you can afford them! Cook extra because sandwiches the next day on big rolls with pesto are really fantastic!

This is easy to make especially for those who do not have alot of time in the kitchen. My boyfriend said it could have used a bit more spice to it so next time I will add some different spices. I bought French's Honey Dijon Mustard and it tasted great!!

Amazing ~ this is my first review and I use All Recipes, recipes all of the time, but I had to rate this recipe, the honey mustard was outstanding, the recipe was extremely easy and I did not have steak sauce so I used a reviewers suggestion and added worcestershire sauce and I am on a very strict low fat diet so I used low fat mayonnaise.  I did find that the 1/3 cup dijon mustard was a little too pungent so I added more honey to balance out the heat of the mustard.  I marinated the chicken for about 1 hour at room temperature and saved some dressing for basting and I served over a salad.  I'm sorry I did not make a double batch to use the dressing for my salad.  I will be making this recipe again.

This was delicious! I have to admit, I really didn't measure anything, just added ingredients to taste. I also didn't have steak sauce, so I used Worcestershire sauce instead. Grilled it and had it on a salad with blue cheese. Wowza!

Awesome recipe!  I didn't have dijjon mustard so I used a spicy brown mustard.  I also marinaded the chicken breast for a couple of hours.  Cooked them slow and low on the grill for about 25-30 minutes and they came out juicy and had lots of flavor!  Will definitely do this again!

Seriously ~ WOW!  I was just looking to do something with chicken to put on a salad for the diet I'm on.  I hate diet chicken/salad meals.  I actually wanted a 2nd plate of this!!  No changes to recipe except to double it.  Now I have extra for tomorrow.  This was excellent and I will definititely make again.   I never seem to get around to rating recipes I like but I made it a point to rate this just after dinner.  Try it!  Thanks Connie.

This dish was absolutely amazing. I made it with rice and made two bowls of the honey mustard sauce so we had extra to drizzle over after it was cooked. SOO GOOD!

I highly suggest grilling this chicken. I made it in the oven and it was delish! I can't imagine if I had grilled it. The dressing is good in itself! I put some aside and topped the chicken with it on everyone's plate.

Made this chicken for my family, it was great!  I made a little bit of extra sauce and drizzled it on top of the chicken just before serving it.  This is a keeper!

Delicious and easy. Pounded the chicken breasts thin and spread the sauce on the top. Grilled for 8 minutes on medium-high, turned over and spread sauce again, then 8 more minutes and it was ready to eat. Yum!

Nice, mild taste.  Nothing fancy but very good nonetheless. A good staple for grilled chicken.

I grilled tenders and hindquarters, next time I'll stick with the chicken tenders, they're so much easier and cook quickly. Nice mild flavor!

Absolutely delicious!  The only thing I did differently is that I marinated the breasts for a couple of hours before grilling.  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe. :)

My family says this is a "keeper"! Have to say I followed just about exactly - but I used deli mustard that had chunky mustard seeds in it, and worchestershire sauce for the steak sauce. I used chicken breast tenders, and soaked them in the sauce for about an hour in the fridge before grilling. 
Served with wild rice, corn on the cob and green beans. Delish!

I really enjoyed this but my family did not.  We dont eat a lot of sweet meats though, so maybe this will grow on them when I serve it again.  When my family changes their mind I will give it 5, but I really did enjoy this.  I saved extra sauce for dipping and that made it really enjoyable.  Just pour some out into anther small bowl before you baste the raw chicken.  Thanks!

I used grill seansoning instead of the steak sauce, and omitted the mayo.  The Dijon really flavors the meat.

This is a keeper. Put frozen chicken breasts in the marinade and placed it in the refrigerator for 18 hours before grilling it. It was so moist and even the people that don't like mustard totally enjoyed it.

I loved this chicken.  It couldn't have been easier to make.  I was a little "iffy" about the sauce before it was cooked; it had some flavor I wasn't a big fan of.

But after it cooked, the flavors mixed together in a great way.  Delicious, juicy, tender...thanks for this recipe!

Wonderful change of pace for bar-b-q chicken.  Followed the recipe to the tee - marinated the chicken for about 12 hours.  Wouldn't change a thing, it was delicious and enjoyed by all.  The Chicken was about the most moist I have ever grilled.  A definate keeper!  Served with roasted red potatoes and roasted asparagus.

I let these marinate for a few hours and took them out of the fridge about 20 minutes before grilling.  Basted with reserved marinade during last 5 minutes of grilling.  Zesty!  Definitely a keeper!

Nice flavor.  I will probably pound the chicken breasts thinner next time so the flavor gets into them a little more.  Tasty though!

I was really impressed with the taste of the sauce. It's so simple, but full of flavor. The chicken was very most, thanks to the mayo. What I like most is the ingredients are things I always have on hand.

YUMMMYYYY!!! I don't write many reviews. This one was worth it! We usually end up having to pour sauce on our chicken to make it flavorful...not this one. My 2 year old and 5 year old ate it up too! Definitely a keeper. I forgot to set aside some for basting but we didn't really need it. I let it marinade in fridge while grill was heating up and that is all!

This was excellent!!!  I used my George Foreman grill, but it was juicy and tender.  Even my 10 y/o picky eater loved it!  Also cut the sauce recipe in half for dipping!! Leftovers were great as a salad topper!!

Such an easy recipe, but you just gotta discover it! Instead of basting the chicken (I found the mix a little thin) I just dipped the chicken parts in the mix and then on the grill. Tasted really good and was really easy to make. Will make again!

Very good. We found it a bit too tangy, and added some extra honey. We have grilled this and broiled it - both were delicious.

Yum! Tastes great even as a marinade. Adds a lot to just plane chicken breasts.

This one's a keeper - thank you Connie! It's very forgiving - I didn't have any honey or steak sauce. Instead I used whole grain mustard, molasses, mayo and a teaspoon of vinegar. I pounded my chicken with a mallet so the chicken was tender and the honey mustard gave it a wonderful sauce. I served it with rice noodles and snap peas. Enjoy!

A very quick and easy sauce. I have used the sauce on wild game such as pheasant and turkey too.  It is my go to recipe when I want something quick, easy and delicious.  Did not change it a bit.

Delicious sauce.  This is one of the few recipes that everyone in my family enjoys.  One of the best things about it is that the sauce uses ingredients that I almost always have on hand so it is great last minute meal.  I use worcestershire sauce rather than steak sauce and it turns out just fine.

I love this recipe! I normally have a difficult time cooking chicken unless it's fried but this was an easy recipe that cooked PERFECTLY the two times I have made it. The chicken stays juicy and the slight "burn" the grill creates with the honey mustard is to die for! This recipe will remain in my box for a long time!

Really good... I used olive oil mayo and had 1.5 pounds of chicken tenderloin, instead of the breasts.  After marinating for 3-4 hours, we put them on the grill and they came out perfect.  They were flavorful and even better with a little sauce on the side.

Made it exactly as recipe stated.  I used A1 steak sauce.  It was a nice change.  I will definitely make this again.  I might try using Heinz 57 sauce next. Thanks for the recipe.

This dish combines two of the best things; chicken and honey mustard sauce. I like to add a little bit of paprika to the honey mustard sauce though, otherwise this is a great recipe and should be on everyones dinner table!

This is the first honey mustard sauce that I made.  It's delicious!  I used it to marinade chicken for kabobs as well as for a baste while grilling.  I loved it!  The only change I made was to use chili paste instead of steak sauce (didn't have any in the house).  I will definitely make it again!

Just tried this tonight.  Very good but felt it needed a little more 'zing'.  Maybe might be good to add another teaspoon of steak sauce.  I used worcestershire sauce.  Might be good to add some paprika.  I might try that next time.  Also recipe didn't say whether or not to marinate, just to dip.  I might try that next time.  Overall, very good!  Good to have something other than barbeque sauce for a change.

I can't believe how fast the chicken took on the honey mustard flavor. I didn't allow enough time for it to marinade at all. It went straight to the grill and came out great!

So great!  But the grill died, so we had to pan fry them.  I thought they'd be horrible, but the sauce was so good they still tasted moist and flavorful.

This is so easy and very good.  Just don't dry out the chicken!  I marinated mine overnight which really added more flavor, but I've made it with just marinating for 15 mins or so.  I used the left over chicken on salad the next day - very good.

I made this on the foreman grill. The only thing i wouldn't do again is basting. It did burn a little bit. I made this like the recipe said. I don't think it need double sauce i used 2/3 of the sauce to marinate for about 15 minute and use the last 1/3 to top and i still had some let. This was a great recipe and i will make again.

I guess it's mostly a matter of taste on this one. I made it as written except doubled the sauce and marinated the chicken for a couple of hours before grilling. My son loved it but my husband and I thought that the sauce had too strong a flavor for us when used for dipping. I will probably try making it again but marinade it for longer to try to infuse more flavor into the meat without having to use extra sauce for dipping. The chicken was very tender and juicy.

So Yummy and so simple. I made this yesterday and absolutely loved it and so did everyone else. I also doubled up on the recipe like others suggested & added a bit extra honey. It was so good i think i'll be making it again this weekend for my boyfriend.

this was allright. made it on the george foreman grill and the sauce burned before the chicken was done, which was a downer. don't try it on the grill unless you can turn it down to mid temp. the taste was nice, don't think it really marinated that well either(left mine for 2hrs). definetly needed the extra sauce on the side

We enjoyed it, thank you for the recipe. It was a bit on the dry side so we had to keep spreading sauce on it while it was grilling. Maybe try marinating it for a few hours beforehand.

I have to admit, I was on the fence about this recipe, but I had all the ingredients on hand and tried it.  So glad I did, it was very good.  My kids even liked it, which is amazing.  The only thing I did was pound the chicken breast out a bit before grilling.  I will be making this one again.

mmmm! this recipe is absolutely delicious!!! although i did alter it just a little because i have no steak sauce in the house so i used bbq sauce & i like honey more than mustard so i added more honey and less mustard! (1/4 spicy mustard, 1 teaspoon of bbq sauce, 1/2 cup of honey, and 2 tablespoons of mayo... SO yummy!) one of my new favorite recipes! i had extra honey mustard so i dipped my chicken in it... delicious!!!!!

Yum! This recipes is fantasic. I love honey mustard anything and this chicken hit the spot. We used bone-in chicken thighs and grilled them, they were super juicy. I saved some ot the honey mustard for dipping sauce and it was great. We'll be making this all summer long!

Moist and delicious! The best grilled chicken we've had. Everyone fought over the extra piece! Made double sauce, marinated over night in half the sauce and basted through the grilling process with the other half of the sauce.

I didn't find that the chicken was anything to write home about.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  The sauce, however was!  I really enjoyed it and I will be making it again by itself to use as a dipping sauce.

Great tasting marinade, but not quite as much flavor as I hoped for.  Next time I will let the chicken marinate overnight - and definitely leave some sauce to dip the chicken it.

We thought this was really good.  If you don't like honey mustard dressing, this may not be the recipe for you. I added a little more steak sauce, salt and pepper and cooked the chicken on aluminum foil on the grill sprayed with Pam, after reading other reviews about burning the marinade.  Also, served on the new sandwich thins with grilled cabbage (kids love this), and grilled potatoes with red peppers.

Made this to recipe, but marinaded for 6+ hours.  I think I shouldn't have done that, and maybe reserved more of the sauce for dipping, as I really liked the flavor BEFORE it was cooked.  Simple, easy and tasty.

The sauce is very good.  It is a little on the spicy side (meaning it has a little kick to it).  I'm only giving it 4 stars because my husband and I don't like spicy foods.  Purely a personal preference.

Very good, easy, simple ingredients you have on hand.  Husband gave it an 8.5, I said 9 out of 10 stars.  Will make again for sure. Thanks!

Pretty darn good and easy to pull together. I made sure to baste the chicken almost constantly for the last few minutes to make sure it was as saucy as possible. You have to flip it often to ensure it doesn't burn becuase of the honey!

My husband actually loved it! I marinated it for a couple hours, put it on the grill on low/med so to not burn anything. I basted it for a couple of mins on each side. Turned out great!

This was amazing!!! I loved the honey mustard sauce.  I will definitely be using the sauce for other things as well, such as salads.  I think it would make a great dressing.  Chicken was great :-)

My family rated this 4 stars but it was one of my favorites.  Will definately make it again.  Really easy and tasted awesome.  Next time I will make extra sauce and serve a little dipping sauce on the side and then I think they willl agree it really deserves 5 stars

I used worchestershire sauce instead of steak sauce, plus a little extra for more kick. I grilled them on the stove with a grilling pan and they turned out great. My guy smeared the sauce on bread and made a chicken sandwhich.

My husband and I were not that impressed. I am in search of a recipe that is similar to Bakers Square Honey Mustard chicken. I made these in the dead of winter, so I baked in the oven. I will try again when the weather warms and cook on grill as recipe states. Will update rating if this makes a difference.

My whole family loved it! I did not have dijon mustard, so I added black pepper to regular mustard.  I also used thighs and grilled them in the microwave (mine has a grill feature) and they turned out wonderful!   Tasty!

Loved loved loved it, the only thing I would do different is use thin breasts or just adjust cooking time (mine turned out dry due to the thickness of the breasts). I had to cook far too long.

This was an easy sauce, that was thick enough to keep the chicken juicy. i doubled the sauce, and would like to add horseradish next time, or maybe some melindas hot sauce...

Good sauce recipe. The steak sauce doesn't really give too much of a kick. I used chicken thighs and it turned out ok. The dark meat gave it a nice look though.

This chicken was amazing! So simple to put together, yet it really tastes like you fussed a lot. The wonderfully unique thing about this recipe vs. other grilled chicken recipes is that it doesn't require any marinating time, something that really appealed to me, because I am notorious for not thinking about marinades until about 20 minutes before the chicken is going to be grilled :) Though it requires no long marinading process, the honey mustard flavors still really come through, which is awesome. The sauce brushed on during cooking helps retain moisture and flavor, as well as giving it an awesome golden brown color. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...it is going to become a regular on my family's menu!!!

This stuff is the bomb!!  I let the chicken sit in this for 2 days and the flavor was incredible.  I also basted with it as directed....so good!!  This would be perfect for dipping fries in-yum!

Haven't grilled the chicken yet, but the sauce is AWESOME - better than any restaurant or store brand honey mustard sauce I've ever tasted. I used Golden brown mustard almost to the top of my 1/3 cup, but topped it off with about 1 tablespoon of Beer Brat Mustard (horseradish mustard). I used Heinz 57 steak sauce, and WOW! If the chicken grills up as well as everyone says, this will definitely be a regular on our menu. Thanks to whoever posted this recipe!

I have made this several time and is one of my favorite chicken recipes.  The marinade really keeps the chicken juicy inside, instead of drying it out.  I baste the chicken a few times throughout the grilling.

I also used worchestershire sauce instead of steak sauce, and I precooked the chicken before grilling to make sure it would be done evenly (about 30 min at 350).  We loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I was skeptical about the steak sauce, but after tasting it, now I get it.  It was perfectly delicious!  And it did cause the chicken breasts to be nice and tender and moist.  I do recommend making double the sauce though.  The raw chicken really holds on to it when you initially dip it.  Then you need more for the basting, and then you need more for dipping the finished chicken into.  At least, that's the way my family wanted it!

Yum! The honey mustard sauce is super tasty! I used this recipe and baked instead of grilled but it still came out very tasty and moist! If you like honey mustard, this sauce is a keeper and you'll want to make extra for dipping!

This was simply the best.  I've made it two times, the first as written and the second time, I used this as a base for Alice Springs Chicken (Outback Steakhouse).  I just added a little bacon and some cheddar cheese and served some of the sauce for dipping. YUM!

Yum! Great flavor. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, but doubled the sauce so that I could have extra for basting. Will definitely make this again, Thanks!

I thought the chicken turned out pretty bland, but I made another batch of marinade, with a little more honey that the recipe calls for, and drizzled the grilled chicken and let it rest for a bit. Also used some sauce for dipping. Chicken was much more flavorful this way. I will make again with the same changes.

This was excellent - followed the recipe and it was perfect. I would serve this to guests without hesitation.... but the real pearl here is the Honey Mustard Sauce. Absolutely out of this world!

I've read a lot of reviews that said this recipe had no flavor, and I disagree. I used actual "Grey Poupon" dijon mustard, a high grade very sweet honey, and "Chaka's"for the steak sauce. Both my boyfriend and I loved it. I just dumped all the ingredients into a plastic back, squished it all together, and then added the chicken for to marinade about an hour or so. We didn't baste the chicken, but it came out great. I'll definitely be saving this recipe for next time.

I marinated the chicken in hot sauce for a few hours. It created a yummy spicy honey mustard sauce. I will definitely use this again! Could be used as a salad dressing too.

Awesome flavor. Only change I made was using light mayo instead. Tastes just like restaurant-style honey mustard sauce. We make extra to eat with the meal too.

Needed a quick way to add some flavor to chicken I was about to grill last night. This did the trick. Super fast and easy, with great flavor to boot. My picky eaters even had second helpings.

I didn't think that the flavor was that great.  I cooked the chicken on my George Forman grill so maybe that made the difference.  I served the chicken over a salad and my family liked it so I will probably make it again.

I really wanted to love this recipe as much as most reviewers seemed to, but I just didn't.  It didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting, and the flavor it did have just wasn't that great.  I asked my husband how he would rate it, and he said 3 stars.  He thought it tasted like it had been basted in honey mustard dressing.  I thought it was deserving of 4 stars though.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  I'm sorry but this recipe won't make it into my rotation.

This was very tasty. I do not have a grill so I just cooked it on the stove top with extra sauce. Super easy! My family ate it right up.  Oh, I did not have any steak sauce so I used a bit of soy sauce and ketsup, I am going to get steak sauce for next time, but it was still really good.

Wow, these were soo juicy and tasty.  Grilled as directed and then moved them to the hot side of the grill to get those pretty grill marks.  I would definitely make extra sauce for dipping.  Will be part of the regular rotation.

Great sauce.  Made this tonight for some picky eaters and they really liked it.  Loved the creaminess and how well it coated the chicken. Made exactly as written, doubled batch for eight breasts plenty of sauce.

I think I need to try this again.  I thought it was good, but nothing amazing.  But we had it at a big cookout and I was busy talking with everyone, so I didn't really pay much attention to the flavor.  I'll try it again though.  It certainly was easy!

We loved this recipe.  We are big dijon mustard fans so this was right up our alley.  I would make a little extra next time b/c my hubby likes to drown his chicken in the sauce.

This one was a hit at our house.  It was very easy to prepare and the end result was really tasty.  Very moist and lots of flavor.  If I did anything differently, I would maybe add a little more honey and a little less mustard next time, but that is because I like a sweeter meat.  I will definitely prepare this again!

Very good...also used Worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce, and grilled on the george forman.  Served with fresh chopped green onions sprinkled over the top.  Also made AMAZING leftovers (might have actually been better) so be sure to make more than you need for the initial meal.

I'm very new to this whole cooking thing (I'm a college student) but I made this for a bunch of older people from my church and they absolutely loved it! Every time I see them now they ask when I'm BBQing again and can they come over. Thanks!

This is one of my boyfriend's favorite chicken recipes.  I usually add a little extra steak sauce and a dash or two of worcestershire sauce.  I also leave some extra sauce on the side for him to use for dipping, too!

Was I supposed to marinate this for several hours?  Ues, the sauce by itself was tasty, but I continued to baste while the chicken was grilling and in the end, it just tasted like plain grilled chicken.

Fantastic! Used Fat Free Mayo and Worcestershire and may have used a little more honey as I was squeezing it out of packets. Used Foreman grill but will try baking next time as the grill was so hard to clean. Doubled sauce and so glad I did. YUM! Thanks Tahoegirl.

My roomie and I tried this when it was still too cold to grill outside, so we used an indoor grill pan. The chicken was moist, but I wish I'd have doubled the sauce so we could have spooned it over the finished dish! Good recipe!

My husband's favorite recipe! The steak sauce adds just the right tang. I'll save more marinade for the next one for added flavor when eating.

So easy and tasty.  It was wonderfully moist with just a hint of flavor.  I didn't have any dijon mustard so I mixed the 3 other types I had.

My husband loved this. I thought is was ok but based on the other reviews I was expecting more flavor. I didn't realize I was so low on Dijon mustard so I ended up using half dijon and half regular yellow mustard. I will make again and follow recipe exactly.

I used this for baked chicken - poured on 2/3 the marinade, baked for an hour, uncovered, poured on the remaining marinade, and baked for another 20 minutes. This was very flavorful, perhaps a tad too flavorful.

This was very good. Im not really a honey mustard fan but I asked my bf "bbq or honey mustard" and thats why I made it. I used stone ground dijon  which gave it a pretty appearance. Yum yum.

Love this!  I could definitely imagine this marinade as a salad dressing.  Reminds me of the honey mustard from Chick-fil-a.

This makes a good week-night meal. Made recipe as written, except used Worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce and doubled the sauce to have some for dipping.  My whole family loved this recipe, may try on pork chops next time.  Will make many times.  Thanks for the fast, easy delicious recipe!

I'm not really that big a fan of anything mustard, but the honey mustard is delicious. It's tangy, yet sweet from the honey, and it's all brought together by the classic taste of the mustard. I had two breasts leftover from dinner, so I let the Chicken re-marinade overnight, and the next day for lunch I cut it in strips and cooked it long enough to warn through. Then I used it in a salad. My boyfriend loved it! I can't wait to make it again!

It was fantastic. Even my 13 year old daughter who doesn't like to have any sauces on her chicken loved it. Next time I will put a little horseradish and spice it up a bit.

Very easy and tasty. I used a grill pan on the stove, so I cooked plain chicken breasts until almost done before putting the honey mustard on so it didn't burn on the pan.  An easy week night meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious base sauce, have made it several times.  This time when i made it I put it on pork chops, and for fun I jazzed it up with a little salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a splash of lemon juice to tenderize the meat.  I also added a tbspn of raspberry vinegar, gives it the perfect balance of sweet and tang.  It is great as-is, but you can play with it too to suit your taste.  Try dipping pretzels in it, tastes just like a great pretzel dip we get in well-known gift baskets each year at christmas!

Great chicken recipe.  I followed the directions exactly and the chicken was very flavorful and moist.  We will be having this again!  I think the leftover chicken would be great on a salad.  I will be trying that next.

I would give this 5 stars but I had to alter the recipe based on what I had on hand, but it was fantastic nonetheless!  I didn't have honey or steak sauce, so I mixed the dijon mustard with honey mustard and some worcestershire sauce... very yummy! I made extra sauce to keep on hand in the fridge, thanks!

Id give this more stars if I could!  This was amazing!  Super easy and super good!  Great recipe!  I marinated mine in the honey mustard sauce for about 2 hours but I really don't know if it made a difference.  I think it would be good either way!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this recipe!  It is quick to mix up on a weeknight and the chicken only needs to marinate a half hour or so.  The extra you brush on while the chicken is on the grill is key.  Great flavor and super easy!

GREAT taste!  It was a nice change.  I pounded the chicken to a uniform thickness so they would cook evenly.  I followed the recipe without any changes and it turned out perfect.  Thank you, Connie!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I did exactly what the recipe says but when it was done but still on the grill i put cooked bacon on the top of it and covered it with mixed shredded cheeses.  So delicious!!!

this was great. i cant say much more than anyone else did except i left out the mayo because i am cutting calories, and also i am on weight watchers and one chicken breast came out to about 9 points. not bad for good solid protein. i have a sweet tooth and this definately helps. i will be making it as part of my normal repertoire.

Really good! Make sure your chicken is COMPLETELY thawed before you apply the marinade or the marinade won't soak in.

Not really sure if I did something wrong or not.  I substituted dijon with French's Spicy Brown mustard (as others did), but followed the rest of the recipe for the sauce exactly.  I marinated the chicken in the mixture for about an hour.

Delicious! We really enjoyed this chicken and not just because it was the first time grilling in months. I made a double batch of the sauce, using a good deal to baste the chicken and the rest as a dipping sauce. We'll be making this often this summer, I'm sure. Thank you :)

I didn't like this. I thought the mustard flavor was way too strong. My wife really liked it though so I'm giving it three stars instead of the one I wanted to give it.

This was okay...not as good as I expected but maybe that was due to my inability to grill.  I did use the sauce as a salad dressing and that was good.

MMMM!!! Very Tasty!  I misread the directions and marinated the chicken overnight in the honey mustard mixture. And then i grilled them, reserved the marinade and boiled it down into a thick sauce.  Got thumbs up to make again.

Love this meal--everyone did except for one of my kids who hates mustard, but we can't count him. The only thing I regret is that the chicken I used, which I thought was chicken breast, turned out to be thighs. The honey mustard was the saving grace.   The only thing I did differently was to use regular yellow mustard mixed with a bit of French's Honey Mustard instead of the Dijon because Dijon is too spicy for us. And of course I made extra sauce for dipping. That turned out great for dipping other things, too. Thanks for a fab recipe.

Awesome flavor and grilled up nicely.  I did make an extra batch of marinade as the chicken soaked up alot of the marinade in our vaccum marinator. Big hit again with this family

This is very, very good!  I marinated mine for about 2 hours and wish I had made some extra sauce for dipping.  It would have made it even better (I was out of dijon!).  Simple and delicious!

I've been trying to see what all the fuss was about with my new George Foreman grill but didn't get its greatness until I used this recipe with my new grill. Adding a little oil before grilling made all the difference. This is the best chicken I've ever cooked. AWESOME and EASY recipe!! Thanks a lot!!!

This was incredibly easy (even for a grilling novice), yummy, and quick! I pounded the chicken breasts to an even thickness, so it only took about 12 minutes to cook. The sauce was fantastic and made a great dipping sauce - it was nice to have everything on hand for this meal.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I couldn't stop "snitching" the sauce. I was short on Dijon, so used half dijon half yellow mustard (doubled the recipe so we'd have lots for dipping, also put sauce on rice I made to accompany, delicious). I was also out of steak sauce, so did as another reviewer and used Worcestorshire (however it's spelled) sauce. The sauce would also be great for sandwiches, chicken nuggets, etc. I grilled mine on medium heat for about 7 minutes per side (direct heat).

I used bone in chicken thighs ( all I had) so I did let it marinade for a couple of hours.  This was so good My husband and daughter loved and there were no left overs

Really Great recipe! I was looking for something quick that didn't have to marinade, and this did it!! After reading some of the other reviews, I went ahead and used Worchestershire sauce (I had no steak sauce), added about 1 garlic clove, and fresh ground pepper. SO TASTY!!!

I was having trouble finding a good chicken flavor that didn't require marinading for hours on end and this fit the bill perfectly!  I will absolutely be making this again!

Chicken was tender.  I wasn't a real big fan of the mustard sauce.  Too much of a tang for my taste.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I didn't have steak sauce, so I used Worcestershire sauce, which works just as well and it's just as scrumptious!  Definitely a winner!  And you could use the sauce probably on anything, it's so good!

This was a nice simple, tasty and refreshing way to serve chicken. When you eat chicken like my household does (5 times a week) a change is always welcomed. This will be made again. I made it exactly to direction, I will omit the mayo next time. It didn't mix well and I think omitting it wouldn't really effect the taste. I used a chile dijon mustard from Dean and Deluca and it was fab. My husband stated as others have mentioned, that he isn't a big fan of honey mustards, but did enjoy this one. I doubled sauce as other readers for double dipping, glad I did. We have a birds nest in our bbq right now, so unable to bbq. Therefore, I lowered my oven rack to about 8 inches below broiler and broiled. Turned out great!
thanks for a much welcomed change!

I let my chicken marinate in the sauce overnight before grilling. YUM! This was great. Next time I may let it marinate longer. Deinitely a keeper. Thanks for the great recipe, Connie! UPDATE** it is definitely better marinated longer. I love love love this chicken! Try it served on a bed of your favorite rice smothered with sauteed mushrooms. YUMMY!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  We even got our nine-year-old to eat it and she really liked it!  (She usually won't even try honey mustard chicken).  I've tried a similar recipe where you bake the chicken and use butter and curry powder instead of mayo (and omit the steak sauce).  We had been wanting to try it grilled, then I saw this recipe and thought I should take that recipe and use the twist of the steak sauce.  This was a nice change!  Delicious!  I suggest you put the chicken in a container and then add what you need of the sauce.  I'd wished I had left more out to baste and also more to dip.

I just tried this recipe a few days ago and it was DELICIOUS! The honey mustard sauce was very tasty too. I used the thin sliced chicken cutlets. I also cooked it on the George Foreman grill. I served it on a nice roll and put some more honey mustard on it(i had set aside some honey mustard so that I had some at the end to put on my sandwich). It was so delicious and I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious, easy, and fast. Would be even better if I had marinated it longer. I made the recipe as stated but only cooked 3 chicken breasts and had enough left over for dipping.

Great, easy recipe. I, too was skeptical about a recipe with so few ingredients, but I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. I did add some extra steak sauce for a little more zing. It really was very good. I made sure that I made extra sauce for dipping

A-MA-ZING!!!!  I used boneless, skinless chicken tenders, marinated them for a couple hours, then threw them on the grill and basted them.  I also made an extra 1/2 a recipe to use as dipping sauce.  It was fantastic!!!!  Definitely a keeper that we'll make again and again!

I consider myself a honey mustard snob and this sauce is the best.  I didn't have any steak sauce on hand so I added a couple dashes of Worcestershire and it turned out wonderfully.  I also broiled the chicken because our grill is buried under 4 feet of snow.  Delish!

kids loved it!  - changed mayo to sour cream. Made little dippin sauces with it. Used Dijon, but also added yellow mustard to the dippin sc. Added curry and cayenne to adult recipe. Great with brown rice.

This was amazing!  I suggest only that you serve with extra sauce, blue cheese and mandarin oranges.  I have baked this in the oven for 20 min. on 400, and I have grilled. Both turn out fabulous.

I marinated in the sauce for about 45 min before grilling and the chicken was so moist.  Delicious and easy to make! Even my 19 month old ate it (although with ketchup, of course) - can't wait to make a salad tomorrow with the leftovers.

Very good! I used this recipe tonight - also the first time I tried my countertop grill. They were a good combination! I didn't have steak sauce so I used Worcestershire sauce - it was good.

Very good!  I definitely recommend leaving additional sauce on the side for dipping...this really makes the dish.  Otherwise, she just get a slight hint of a honey-mustard glaze.  It was delicious and my husband loved it.  Will be making again and again!

I'm not a big fan of chicken most of the time.  This was so incredibly good, and surprisingly easy.  I'll probably make this for my husband at least once a week from now on.

it's amazing how so few ingredients can make such tasty chicken, and i followed the recipe to the T (which rarely happens).  Instead of grilling it, I broiled the chicken tenders for about 8 min on each side.

A beauty! Let the chicken marinate for a couple of hours in the mixture. I make extra sauce to add separately to blanched green beans and some ziti pasta and serve it cold, with the chicken right off the grill.

Pretty yummy. I've made this twice so far and the second time I added a bit more mayo (just about 1tbsp) as the Dijon seemed to overpower a bit the first time round. I've got a bit of chicken left over for a sandwich today - looking forward to it!

This was tasty, and very simple to make.  Definitely let it marinade for several hours and baste while grilling.  My husband said he would eat it again, but it was not a favorite. I thought it was very good.

This was so good I was sticking my fingers in the reserved basting sauce while the chicken was grilling!  I recommend making extra sauce for that reason.  My boyfriend's only complaint: i didn't make enough for leftovers. =)

This was easy and delicious, I used bone in chicken breasts with the skin- loosened it up and rubbed the marinade underneath the skin- grilled it and then used the remainder as dip as the recipe suggests.  This will stay in rotation at our house.  Thank you for sharing :-)

This is very good and low fat.  I like how you dont have to marinade the chicken. It is something that could be whipped up with no planning involved.

Love this recipe!   I first made it for my husband and myself, but it was so good I made it again for company...  the best part about it is it's EASY.  Just be sure to take the advice of others and reserve some of the Honey Mustard sauce for dipping at the table.  I just put it in a little pitcher...   People loved it.   Thanks, Connie, for sharing.

Very, very good, and easy.  All of my guests loved it. We used leftovers for sandwiches the next day.  I also pounded the chicken pretty thin so it cooked really quickly. I let soak in the honey mustard sauce overnight.

I've made this marinade on grilled chicken twice now for my boyfriend in two weeks. He absolutely LOVES it. It only takes a minute to prepare and really keeps the chicken moist. I save extra sauce so he can dip and pour it over his rice during dinner. It's in the boyfriends top favs folder for sure.

I love this sauce.  It actually took me twice as long as the recipe indicates to cook the chicken, but it turned out tender and juicy and glazed to perfection.  I will definately make this recipe again, it was so easy and tasty!!  Thank you!

Excellent and very juicy!  My only changes to the recipe were cutting down a bit on the mayo and increasing the steak sauce.  Got rave reviews!  And I did NOT have to pound the breasts flat at all--which tends to dry them out for grilling anyways--even though they were big, thick breasts.  I tripled the sauce for dipping and such, but had leftovers--may use it up by baking some small chicken breasts in it.  Great with corn on the cob and a salad!

This is just a great change for a grilled chicken. My whole family loved it, icluding my picky 20 month old. He kept wanting more sauce. Make extra sauce for dipping. Yummy!

This was good, but I did make modifications as I was preparing it. After mixing up the honey mustard, it looked and smelled a little to "mayo-ey" to me, so I knew my non-mayo liking boyfriend would think the same. I added more honey, mustard, and steak sauce. I highly suggest grilling the chicken, it captures the flavor so much better. Like others, I reserved some sauce for dipping and that helped a lot. I would make this again, but will try to let the chicken marinate in the sauce for longer then 45 minutes.

Highly recomended!  I don't like Mayo so I used ranch & added a Tbls of BBQ sauce for fun. Everyone liked it & it grills very well.

It's grilling season, and this was great! My husband and I grilled ours on an old fashioned grill to really get that grilled flavor in there. We love A1 so that's the steak sauce we used, and doubled it. Grilled corn on the cob goes great with this recipe. We used the leftovers for sandwiches with sharp cheddar cheese, used the extra honey mustard sauce for the spread. Usdd some lettuce and tomato as well. Grilled that on our George Foreman. Great summer lunch!

We liked this scrumptious dish so much that I've just emailed it to all of my family and friends who enjoy grilling.  To ensure a rich flavor, I marinated the chicken in just a bit of the sauce for about two hours prior to grilling.

Very easy and nice flavor. Chicken browned beautifully. I did not pound the breasts and cooked over medium heat, 6 minutes per side. I tasted the sauce before I marinated it and agree with other reviewers that it was a little bland. Fixed that by adding a couple more tablespoons of A1. Delicious!

This recipe had wonderful flavor. I about triples the recipe though. The primary recipe didnt make a whole lot. I let the chicken marinate for about 8 hours and would occationally massage the chicken in the bag to tenderize and be sure it marinated to the fulles flavor. The chicken was very tender. We actually used fresh chicken strips, and made extra (The tripling of the recipe as previously stated) honey mustard sauce to baste and dip in. Very Yummy Thanks for sharing.

I marinated the chicken in the sauce for 5 hours but didn't taste the flavor throughout the chicken after it was cooked.  My mom said it was the best chicken she had ever eaten.  I guess that goes to show you that everyone's tastes are different.

This was pretty good.  I use bold and spicy mustard because I didn't have dijon. I also used worchestire sauce instead of steak sauce.  I marinated the chicken for 3 hours as previous posters suggested.  My kids ate it all and loved it.  My husband thought it was too mustardy.  I thought it was okay.  Not sure if I'd make it again but like I said the kids really loved it.

This was kind of bland. The chicken did not have any flavor even after marinating. The sauce was OK if you want to dip the chicken after grilling, it tastes like a typical honey-mustard sauce.

What was terrific about this recipe was how quick it was, and yet how very tasty. My husband was rushing to get out to a meeting, so I didn't let the mixture sit on the chicken as others had suggested (and as I had intended to do). Will make again. Thanks for the quick, easy and delicious recipe, Connie.

I did not have any steak sause so I just added a bit of Worstishire sauce, pretty good.  Definatly make more sauce for dipping.  I baked mine and it was good.  I went light on the honey and did it by taste.  I will make again.  Thanks.

The sauce was AWESOME, however I give the recipe 4 stars because the chicken didn't seem to cook as well as I had hoped. I will definitely use this recipe again, and will save some of the leftover sauce for dipping.

Quick, easy and yummy.  I pounded out our chicken breast - nice and thin.  Used worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce (it's what I had on hand).  And I marinated in a zip lock for approx. 1 hour.  Like others I had extra to use as dipping sauce.

I changed the recipe a bit to what I had on hand. I switched the mustard to a multigrain mustard. I cut the chicken into smaller pieces and allowed the chicken pieces to marinade for an hour. The flavour went completly through the chicken and tasted great. I'm not a fan of large chicken pieces, they just taste a little dry on the inside to me. Such an easy recipe and my husband told me it was a keeper.

This wasn't too bad at all. Nothing mind-blowing, but very, very good. The steak sauce was a nice twist on things, and pretty much separates this recipe from others similar to this. My wife and kids liked it. Wouldn't really change anything about this recipe.

A nice change for chicken! I used 1/6 cup dijon and 1/6 cup stoneground mustard which was great for the visual presentation.  My whole family liked this one!

Fantastic flavor!  We used boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I was too lazy to pound out and cooked them for 8 minutes per side and they were done all of the way through, yet still juicy.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

This was very tasty and very easy. We made extra sauce, as others suggested, for dipping...very good idea. It took about 30 minutes on the grill to cook through. Thanks for the recipe!!

This was ok, not a whole lot of flavor but very quick and easy to make.  I will probably make it againg when I don't have much time.

It was okay.  It was kinda bland to me, but editable.  I ended up dipping it in A-1 to get some flavor and the chicken wasn't too moist for me. That could have been my own fault though.  Smelled great cooking, just not really my thing.  Family liked okay.  Thanks anyway!

Great recipe. Sauce is really good! I recommend making extra though and marinating chicken for longer- sauce would also be good as a dressing for salad or a dipping sauce for pretzels.

This was an excellent recipe.  We made it 4 or 5 times now in the past month and every time our 3 year old has cleaned his plate!
I usually double the recipe as others have suggested and now I'm to the point where I don't measure any of the ingred. but it still turns out great!

Was good, but not outstanding. What I like with this recipe is that you don't have to marinate, so it is nice for last minute meal on the grill. The sauce was good on the chicken, but I didn't like it as a dipping sauce.

This was way better than I thought it would be, we really enjoyed it.  I didn't care for the steak sauce in the honey mustard however.  I made one with and one without it.

This was very good! I marinated chicken breasts (cut in half) in spicy brown mustard, honey, and A1 for a couple hours. Then I made some sauce per recipe for hubby to baste on the grill. Even with a whisk I could not get the mayo to dissolve though. I also made some more sauce with no mayo for the table (I did not want mayo clumps on my plate). Just eyeballed it and it was very yummy and easy. Thanks! Will use again.

This was pretty good.  I doubled the sauce and marinated chicken in 1/2 the sauce and used the other half for dipping.  The chicken had good taste.  I thought the sauce was alittle to strong.

This was o.k., but nothing to get excited about.  Maybe if I had marinated it, it would have had more flavor but the recipe did not call for marinating.  I won't be making it again.  Better off using a prepared honey mustard bbq sauce.

Mmmmm.  No grill, so I had to bake this.  Turned out absolutely amazing!  The steak sauce is definitely a great trick.  I can't wait to try this on a grill, and next time I'll marinate first!  Will make this one often.

I marinated over night due to changes in dinner.  And it was so juice and had a great flavor.  I only used 2 chicken brest but keep the Honey mustard part the same.  Once I put it on the grill, I took the left over marinate and put it in a sauce pan and boiled it.  Then used it to dip the grilled chicken in.  This is the best will make it again and again

I was skeptical of this recipe as I'm not a huge fan of dijon mustard but i was totally wrong! This was great! The flavors blended together very well. I marinated the dish in the fridge for a few hours & then used a grill pan on the stove. Turned out to be delicious. Thanks so much.

A new family favorite.  My kids and hubby BEG for this.  So easy, so quick, yet absolutely delicious. Make extra sauce for dipping because you will need it. Otherwise the kids will fight over it! As good or better than any honey mustard dipping sauce I have had anywhere.  This is a keeper. Thanks for posting

Yum, easy and delicious.  I doubled the recipe and marinated the chicken as others have done...  I will definitely make this again and again.  The flavor reminded me of the type of chicken that often comes on chicken sandwiches at awesome restaurants!

The best honey mustard chicken I've tasted! I leave it marinating all day in the fridge and just cook it on the grill when I get home for dinner. Easy and delish.

I'm not a huge fan of honey mustard, so I didn't expect to be totally thrilled with this recipe.  But my boyfriend loves anything slathered with honey mustard and he enjoyed this a lot.  He thought the sauce was excellent and had me make a little extra for him to dip his chicken into.  So give this a try if you like honey mustard!

This turned out faboulously.  I didn't really measure my ingredients, and went by sight.  I used 2 pieces of chicken, and made extra sauce, which I marinated the breasts in for about 2 hours, then grilled them on my George Foreman, basting with the remainder.  They were perfect!  I was a little leery about the mayo at first, but you really couldn't tell it was there, and thickened up the sauce nicely.  I also used spicy brown mustard since that is what I had on hand, and added a dash of dill and curry powder.  I also substituted Worcestshire sauce for steak sauce. Excellent!

My hubby loves honey mustard, so I tried this for his sake...boy were we glad I did!  Everyone in the family gobbled it up.  I added a little garlic for our taste (which I almost always do) and cooked on a stovetop grill pan.  No problems with burning...wonderful flavor!

This was great, chicken turned out perfect.  My mom prepared this and she said it was very easy to make.  Tasted great, saved extra sauce for dipping chicken in and served with roasted potatoes and broccoli.  Good, easy recipe.

This chicken was amazing! I only had about an hour to marinade and I marinaded a second batch overnight. I grilled hot and fast on something similar to a George Foreman grill. The flavor was delicious. I had no problems with burning. I butterflied the breasts to make them grill faster. It was so easy...really. I will definitely make this again and again. I will make more sauce too for basting. Thank you, Connie!

One of my favorites and so easy to make.  You can cut the cooking time by using strips instead of breasts if you were in a hurry.

This chicken was great!  It had a great flavor and was so simple to make!  It was different from all of the barbeque and marinated chicken that we normally have.  Next time I will make more sauce to use for dipping, but overall this recipe was delicious!

Amazing recipe. The longer you leave the chicken in, the more juicy it becomes.

This was pretty good. I cooked it inside on a cast iron griddle plate on top of the stove. Next time I will double and divide the sauce and use the second half as dipping sauce.

Pretty good recipe. I wouldn't call it amazing and maybe I didn't marinate it for long enough but it was good just not an amazing recipe for me.

Everyone's favorite. Super easy and tastes great. I used Worcestershire sauce instead if steak sauce. Thus recipe is a keeper.

I made this exactly as written (tho I used Miracle Whip instead of real mayo because that's what I had). Hubby grilled it and we both loved it. Definitely a repeater for us!

Incredibly easy and so tasty. Everyone in the family loved it. Leftovers chopped up made great lunch wraps. I didn't have steak sauce and used Worcestershire. It worked great. So much better than a bottled bbq sauce.

This is an exceptional recipe. Simple to make and so very, very good. I made it nearly as written, using A1 steak sauce as the steak sauce ingredient, thighs instead of breasts and letting the chicken marinate in the sauce for about 30 minutes before grilling. I'll be making this a lot. Thanks for sharing, Connie!

I made this for my husband and I for dinner last night, although I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes instead and used boneless skinless thighs. The honey mustard added so much flavor to the chicken! I paired mine with some fried potatoes I made as well and it was absolutely scrumptious!!

This was delicious. Rather than grilling it, I cooked it on the stove, turning each piece once, 4 minutes on each side. I then put it under the broiler for a few minutes until the sauce browned slightly.

Delicious grilled chicken!  I do agree with others that the inside of the chicken was pretty bland, so we reserved a bit of extra sauce and drizzled that over top at the very end.  We served it with broccoli we roasted in a foil packet on the grill.  Yummy!

As suggested, I added 1 tsp of worchestershire and doubled the sauce (except the honey); and set aside some for dipping at the table. I marinated for 8 hours and basted while grilling. Very, very tasty!

I thought this was good. I doubled the marinade recipe and used 6 skinless breasts reserving maybe a quarter of marinade for basting. I let the breasts marinate for about eight hours.  Then grilled and basted. Wished I’d saved a little marinade for dipping later.  Next time I may add a touch more steak sauce for a bit more kick. Thanks!

Fast, easy, and delicious!  I made 2 batches of the sauce-one for dipping the chicken into and one for basting/dipping.  My kids think the dipping sauce tastes like Chick-Fil-A sauce.

This was excellent. Everyone ate it including Jake and Ty.  Doubled the sauce to use for basting on the bbq as well as for the rice I made.  Cooked 15 boneless, skinless thighs and could have used more.  Didn’t use indirect heat because I didn’t have enough room so just bbq’d at lower heat and kept turning and basting. Also added Worcestershire sauce.

This was so good! I did not have any steak sauce, so like another reviewer suggested, I used Worcestershire sauce instead. Let it marinate in the fridge for about 1 1/2 hours, then grilled. So tender and flavorful! Will definitely make again!

This was a very easy recipe and my family loved it. I made the recipe almost as is....replaced steak sauce with Worcestershire sauce as other reviews said.  Marinated for approx 1 hour before grilling. Also made a double recipe of the sauce per reviews I read.  Daughter thrilled as now she is taking a salad to school for lunch tomorrow with left over chicken and honey mustard sauce!!  This recipe is a keeper!

My go to recipe for grilled chicken! I always make sure I make some extra sauce to drizzle over the top of the grilled chicken or to serve on the side as a dip.

Although I was skeptical of the steak seasoning, I made this as written.  My hubby and I really liked the flavor of the meat.  I used the leftovers the next day chopped up in a lettuce salad.  Good! Thanks for the recipe.

Really tasty. I poked holes in the chicken breasts before putting the sauce on then and let them sit for about an hour with the sauce on it before cooking. Is definitely a do-over!

Delicious!!!  As stated, very easy, fast and oh so scrumptious.  Will be making this often.  Used grill pan, had to use worchestshire sauce instead of steak sauce and now not sure if I want to change that.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

We happened to have a surplus of mustard in our home, so this was the perfect recipe to make use of some of it. My husband was extremely pleased with the outcome. I followed the recipe except for substituting  Worcestershire sauce for steak sauce.

I'd give it a 5 but I took huge short cut.  For 4 whole breasts, I beat them out to 1/2 inch thick and marinated them for 3-4 hours  in 3/4 c. O'Charley's Honey Mustard Salad Dressing & 2T. Dale's Steak Seasoning Low Sodium.  Grilled them on med. temp.  gas grill for 14 min. with mesquite smoking chips.  I will definitely do this over and over again but next time with a weeks worth of breasts!

I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo and Worchestershire sauce for the steak sauce.  I bought chicken breasts that were thinly sliced.   It was excellent.

Followed the recipe as it was, and thought it was great. I didn't grill it this time, I used the oven then the broiler and it worked nicely. Will add to regular rotation.

I did everything said in the recipe.  Since I don't own a big outside, I used my small indoor grill. The recipe was easy to understand. One thing I'll say is that the outside packed a lot of flavor while the inside didn't.  I thought to myself "It needed to be tangy,zinging, zap, like barbeque sauce", so I added a few more droplets of the steak sauce to my last chicken breast. Any recipe that I make and comes out good (not very good with cooking) I will love to make again but try something else. Like Worcestershire sauce

This was great! I didn't have steak sauce so I substituted a little barbecue sauce instead. I bet this would be great on a pork chop too!

The sauce is great. We went a little easy on the honey and marinaded the chicken for about an hour before we put on the grill. Everyone loved it. Thank you for sharing such a quick and delicious recipe.

I've been making this for years.  So simple and so incredibly delicious.  Trust me...grill some romaine lettuce (EVOO & salt)  to go with it and top it with the honey mustard.  Sounds weird if you've never had it.  If you have, you know how addictive it is!

I use stone ground mustard, instead of the Dijon, because that's the kind of guy I am. :) I think it gives it just a little bit more spice and texture.

I followed the recipe substituting Miracle whip for the mayonnaise  because I don't use mayonnaise.  I marinated the chicken with 1/2 the sauce for 30 minutes.  I glazed the chicken when I put them on the grill and then glazed them again when I flipped them.  I coated the chicken just a bit when I took them off the grill and they tasted great and were  extremely moist!

Made the recipe as written.  Excellent product.  Very easy.  I did turn the breast a few times, so one side did not get too blackened. A reminder if you are going to grill, a meat thermometer is invaluable.

So delicious!  Cut chicken into strips, or cubes and skewer for most flavor.  Make extra sauce for dipping and for your salad dressing.

Great recipe! I gave it four stars because the dijon and mayo flavours are very stong and overpowered the chicken a bit. Otherwise it was great, a definite make again.

The sauce was really good.  I only marinated for 1/2 hour.  I will marinate overnight next time and see if that helps flavor the chicken more.

I made it exactly as the recipe said, however, it took 45 minutes on indirect heat on the grill.   We loved the tangy taste.

Fantastic recipe! I made this for my family one night while my youngest sister was away at camp, and everyone loved it! I modified it slightly, buy using a tiny bit of brown mustard since we didn't have enough Dijon mustard, the sauce is great and I want to try again making it with more sauce to use as drizzle or dipping sauce and make the chicken into kebabs

Hands down, the best honey mustard sauce recipe out there!  I've made the recipe (always subbing out the steak sauce for Worcestershire sauce) on grilled chicken, exactly as described or baked chicken at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.  But I've also used the honey mustard recipe on everything else, from fish to pork chops to veggies. Anything I marinate in this sauce comes out amazing, and it's also a great dipping sauce.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

I double the sauce for this.   I set 1/2 aside and use it how the recipe suggests.  Then with the other half I microwave it for 30 seconds on 1/2 speed and use that as a dipping sauce.   Its AMAZING!

Love this! The honey mustard is on point, better than any one I've ever got out of a jar. I like to marinate my chicken in the sauce all day before I grill it. I've used an electric grill and gas grill to make this and they both taste amazing! Defiantly a keeper. Kids love this one 2!

This recipe is amazing!! I left the chicken in the marinade for 4 hours. Then made more marinade to baste the chicken with while grilling and used the extra marinade to flavor my grilled string beans. 
Tip: Before marinating the chicken, fork either side of the breast so that the marinade seeps into the chicken breast.

Delicious!  Followed exactly.  Be sure to oil the grill.  We make a double batch of the sauce - a batch to marinade and brush on the chicken while cooking, and another batch for drizzling on the chicken on the plate.  Extra sauce is also a tasty dressing for salads...keep refrigerated.  This will make your grill messy, but it's so worth it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't change a thing. I cooked it on the stove top and let it rest for 15 minutes. I cut up the chicken and basted its juices all over.

Best grilled chicken recipe I have found.  I tried dicing up the chicken and did it kabob style. Also made the Brazilian grilled pineapple recipe (as kabobs) the same time.. needless to say there was no leftovers. Kids thought it was fun to eat too.

This meal was pretty tasty. I started with frozen chicken breasts instead of fresh chicken breast, and I put mine in the oven. I baked it at 400 degrees, for about 40 minutes. Next time I think I'll try 35 minutes because the chicken got a little dry and the honey ended up burning in the pan (be careful for that). Otherwise the meal was delicious and quite simple to make. I'll be making it again!

Followed recipe almost to the letter except added one clove of garlic and used a "57 Style Kroger Brand" steak sauce.  Used heaping amounts of each to have enough marinate.  Set some aside for basting and let the chicken breasts marinate about 4 hrs .  I think it would have been better if the breasts were cut to more even size so it would all be done at the same time.  My husband really loved the sauce,  and I thought it was pretty good so it's a keeper.

very tasty.  I used A1 for the "steak sauce".  I made a 2nd batch of the sauce (since I didn't want to reuse anything that might have had raw chicken in it!)....to this I added some cognac and a tad of white wine vinegar to make a honey mustard vinaigrette. It was an intense taste, so not much was needed on the salad greens...then we just topped the salad with the grilled chicken.  I'm eating the cold leftover chicken right now and it's still delicious.

I marinated this for about 7 hours and cooked it on my Foreman grill. I would have to say that it was MUCH better with the Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce recommended by Jillian. I will use the leftovers to top a salad or in a pita pocket sandwich.

This was so tasty! I, too, subbed Worcestershire sauce for the steak sauce and used some whole-grain mustard we had laying around. Pan-fried instead of grilled; turned out great. The family loved it. No leftovers!

I have a NuWave, my grill, oven, etc. Wonderful invention. I marinaded it and used Dijon mustard. Made a difference. Used some Panko with a little powdered garlic, to coat chicken. Very little little clean up on grill. Loved it. Don't overdo the garlic.

This was just ok. I think the dijon mustard overpowered the taste. I wouldn't make it again.

Quick,Easy and Delicious. Made as is and by 7 year old said it was the best chicken she had ever had. Will be added to the regular rotation because it is so easy to get on the table after a long day at work.

Yum!  As others suggested, I used Worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce (didn't have steak sauce), but that was my only change.  I also did 1 1/2 times the recipe so we could have extra sauce to serve on the side.  We really liked this and I'm going to make it again for sure, no changes.

This was great!  I tanged it up with more steak sauce (A1) and a shake of cayenne since I like spicy.  I'm going to use this as a spread on turkey or ham sandwich.  Seems like it'd taste great in that context, too!

Will definitely make it again!  Delicious flavor and grill at low temps if you can so there is less burning of the honey which charred.

This was delicious on chicken cutletes.  I prepared the recipe as written, but after tasting found a tad too mustardy for me, so I added a little more mayo and honey to dillute.  Next time I prepare this (and I will!) I'll use equal parts honey and mustard.  Great grillin' recipe, thanks for sharing with AR!

if you use skinless chicken breasts it works well, if not, the flavor seems to get lost.

Delish!!!!  Marinated for 24 hours and grilled 9 minutes on each side (probably could have done 8 on each side).  Had plenty of sauce left for dipping.  Would definitely make again.

Best meal of chicken I ever had. Simply delicious, sweet, but has a right balance of salt. I prefer chipotle mayo for a spicy kick to the sauce.

This sauce tasted fine, and the chicken was cooked nicely, however, I would have only cooked it for 10 minutes over indirect heat and then turned up the heat for the remaining time.  I like a bit of evidence that my meat has been on a BBQ, I would have liked the sauce to have been cooked onto the meat.  Cooking the whole time on indirect heat left the sauce kinda 'uncooked' just sitting on the chicken. (not that the sauce needs to be cooked but, you get the point).

Simple, straight forward, delicious. I made it with the darkest honey I had and stone ground mustard.  Low and slow, then a blast of heat at the very end. Went straight into the starting lineup.  I would add a photo but there is none left.  Maybe next time.

Made as directed--I had high hopes, but did not like the taste.  Honey flavor came across too strong--maybe it was the type of honey that I used?

I hate changing a recipe and then rate it but this was delicious. The only change I did was change the honey to Grade B Maple syrup.  I didn't have honey on hand. Thanks for sharing.

I made this with chicken thighs. I thought it was AWESOME. The best ever. PERFECT flavor. My son didn't like it and my daughter thought it was just okay. I guess it depends on your taste buds, but I LOVED it. You have to like a slightly sour taste. It almost tastes like it was marinated in a vinegary-A1 sauce.

Excellent chicken was tender inside and crispy outside. Marinated one hour room temperature. Used less mustard only about 1/4cup & Worcester instead of steak sauce.

Loved it - I didn't have Dijon mustard, so used grainy mustard and marinaded the chicken for a couple of hours.  The secret to perfect bar-b-cued chicken is not to have the bar-b-cue too high.  I kept it at 300 degrees and it cooked perfectly.  Will definitely do this one again.

The sauce is amazing! The chicken didn't have very much flavor so I would marinate it for a few hours next time and double the recipe for the sauce to use for dipping. 4/3/14

This was delicious. I used mister mustard hot because I didn't have any Dijon and I added a little brown sugar because I was afraid the mister mustard would make the flavor to spicey for my little one but I followed the rest of the recipe and marinated in the fridge for about 4 hours. My entire family loved it. I will definitely make again.

I also used Worcestershire sauce because I didn't have any steak sauce on hand.  It was delicous!  I had about 1/3 of a breast leftover for lunch the next day and it was even better!

Very tasty! And relatively low-calorie. Easy to make, too. What more could you want? I read that someone else used Worcestershire sauce, so I used it, too. Really nice.

LOVED This Honey Mustard Chicken!! To give it a little kick I added Big Rick's Jalapeño Honey Mustard.  ( www.bigricks.com ) My husband grilled it outside and it was AWESOME.  Had some leftovers and made a chicken salad the next day.  Nice and Healthy with a Kick of flavor!!

I dont have a grill so i baked this then set the oven to broil once the inside was almost cooked. It was great, although a bit bland inside. I marinated for about 15 minutes. Next time i'll probably marinate it much longer.

added more mayo to make the flavour less intense (boyfriend doesn't like sweet nor mustard).  I cut the chicken into little pieces to maximize the marinade.  Will make again - ate it with rice - what did you eat it with?

Hummm ! This recipe is great and easy to make. I cooked the chicken in the oven with the marinade, delish ! My daugther who is not a fan of either mustard or sweet and sour type of sauce loved this one ! She even used the left over chicken to make herself a sandwich for her school lunch ! This will become a classic in our house. Thanks !

My family LOVES this recipe.  The sauce/marinade is SOOOO good.  Follow the advice of everyone and marinate the chicken the night before to get even more flavor and also make extra sauce for dipping.

Excellent. Will do again. Didn't grill the chicken as long as the recipe says (15 minutes in all was perfect) but I suppose you might have bigger chicken in the States.

I don't care for mustard or mayonnaise, so my BF looked at me kind of funny when he saw me preparing this sauce. I was looking to try something different though, and I'm glad that I did. I really enjoyed this recipe and will surely make it again next time I want to do something different with chicken breasts. I followed the recipe to a T, except for the fact that I prepared my chicken on the stove because it started raining. Can't wait to try it on the grill!

Well, I had high hopes for this chicken, but it was way too "mustardy" for us and we like mustard. I wonder if the Dijon here in Sweden, where we live, is stronger somehow. I will not be tryng this one again, unfortunately.

MMMM! Absolutely delicious! I made this last night using split chicken breasts. Marinaded for 2 hrs.in the fridge, and it came out excellent.  Chicken can be so bland and boring, and I tend to dry it out when cooking it on the grill. I will definitely make it again! Thanks Connie!

Great recipe. I didn't have 1/4 cup of honey so I had to use less but I think I liked it that way. I also added more steak sauce and some chicken montreal seasoning. I've been cutting my chicken breasts butterfly style so they are thinner and I marinated those in 1/2 the mixture for a few hours and then basted while cooking. They were quick and tasty. Thank you for the recipe!

This is the recipe I've been looking for!  I used chicken tenders and baked them in the convection oven; next time, I'll use the grill.  But either way, just delicious.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Connie!

This is a must try... I make it pretty frequently about every 2-3 weeks and the whole family loves it.  I make it just as recipe says and it comes out delicious every time.  The marinade is awesome. Try it w/ free range organic chicken...you won't regret it.

This recipe was very good. I didn't have any Dijon mustard so I substituted Chipolte mayonnaise and I only added an additional Tbsp of regular mayonnaise. Served this for hubbie, daughter and grandson and all thought very good! I'll definitely make again.

I fixed this for dinner last  evening and was less than enthused with the results. Even though my wife thought it was good, I found the taste to be quite bland even after basting it several times during grilling. This is not a recipe that I would consider doing again without some CONSIDERABLE modifications.

Saw this recipe and said that's my savior.  I purchase a weber of good quality and have been doing rotiserri chicken bi-weekly.My other halve loves Englehoffer honey mustard, so i used that with miracle whip and leas & perrrin worchester sauce. I used what i had. I put about 2 tablespoons under the skin of a young chicken 5.65lbs, on the breast and legs of each side.I rub it around with my hand.  When i withdrew my hand from under the skin I wiped them off on the surface.  I bag it and left in the fridge about 4 hours.  Set my grill at 400 degrees for 45 minutes,  then turn it down to 350, I then basted with remainder at 70 minutes and 80 minutes.  Pulled at 90 minutes.It was excellent, the other halve said don't do it any other way.  there is a sign in my basement that was in my parents house.  It says the opinions of the husband are not neccasarily those of the management.  So Thank you,  I have been told I will do this again.  ps I'll sneak one in your way that englehoffer is good but expensive AND i PAY THE BILLS. lol  Since we also do chicken breasts I will try those soon. Sorry I can't give you more stars

I'm giving it fours stars just from the ease of preparation and how Delicious that honey mustard sauce sounds.  I have an outdoor grill and this one oi gonna be used now that the weather is warming up.  I'm not a mayo fan, though.  Anyone make this minus the mayo?

Delicious.  I marinaded it for about an hour before grilling and as someone else suggested, we made extra dressing for dipping.  It didn't need it, but it was so yummy!  I cooked extra chicken to throw on top of a salad for a no cook meal later this week.

The flavor on the outside was good (somewhat mild) but as other reviewers stated, the inside was not flavorful.  I cooked this on a charcoal grill, and looked pretty.  Would do this again, but might add some salt and pepper to the marinade.  Definitely easy to make at the last minute or when you have nothing else in the cupboard.

This is more a review of the sauce than the recipe as a whole as my chicken is marinating in it now.  I did however just make a double batch of the sauce and it is DELICIOUS!  I am not a fan of dijon and used spicy brown which is still a tad too horseradish tasting for me but the honey cuts it for me.  I used a really good quality honey and A1.  We are already thinking that this will be a staple for sandwiches.

This recipe was excellent and a huge success.  I doubled the recipe and put the chicken and marinade in a ziplock bag.  I only intended to marinate overnight.  However, plans changed and these ended up marinating in the fridge for a day and a half.  I would turn the bag over regularly to insure even marinating.  

I used this recipe on some breasts as I was cooking for the first time on Weber Kettle Charcoal grill.  I used Mesquite flavor charcoal and cooked the chicken slow on a low heat.  They came out juicy with a smokey sweet flavor that was delicious.  Family loved it and the leftovers disappeared quickly.

This was SO good!!!! I made my chicken breast on the George Foreman until they were 180 or no longer pink! The sauce pretty much burnt off but it is an AMAZING dipping sauce!! This will be one recipe that I make over and over! I couldn't stop eating! :)
I also didn't have Dijon so I did half normal mustard and half spicy brown mustard!

This is great. We use it often when grilling out. I make sure to save a little for the end and brush it on the chicken to have that extra flavor.

wow, talk about easy!! This is a super fast meal and so tasty. I made one adjustment. I found that when I used a name brand Dijon mustard I didn't care for it as much as a weaker store brand. You can adjust this to perfection with the few ingrediants needed. I found this recipe a few weeks ago and I've made it almost once a week. Everyone that I've served this to has eaten every bite!

Very good chicken. I marinated my in the sauce overnight. I cooked on a gas grill at 300 degrees and indirect heat. I kept the breasts on for 30 minutes, thighs on for 25, legs on about 22 minutes and the wings on for 20 minutes. I turned all of them at their respective half-way point. I basted a couple minute before turning.

All of them came out very juicy and tender. My wife and teenage boys loved it.

Will definitely make this again.

I am not a big mustard person but that was good! 
I used regular Heinz Mustard and Honey, no mayo or steak sauce and it was still so good. I almost licked the pan at the end :P
Next time I am using real Dijon mustard and the steak sauce (i don't do mayo) and I am sure it will be even more yummy!

Thanks for the recipe!

The first time I made this it wasn't very good. The glaze/sauce was yummy but it's not a real marinade that gets into the chicken and flavors it - so the chicken was pretty dry and tasteless.
But this time I tried it with thin sliced chicken breasts (or you could pound them really thin) and it was MUCH better. 
I obviously cut the cooking time in about 1/2. 
Now this will become a regular - it's quick, easy and tasty.

I really disliked this recipe.  I thought it smelled funky when I was cooking it (and it wasn't the chicken).  It turned out very lackluster.

I never write reviews, but after tasting this honey mustard sauce I just had to! This is the BEST sauce I've ever made from scratch. My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe as others commented here, because it went fast. I'm going to try the salad dressing as others have mentioned next time!

Will be making this again soon.  I followed the instructions exactly.  I almost didn't try it because I do not like mustard.  However, I could not taste the mustard at all.  The chicken was delicious and moist.

I made this chicken for a huge family get together and it was fast, simple, and delicious. I went a little heavier on the steak sauce because I wanted more tang. It's important to make sure to hold back some of that sauce for basting after you flip the chicken on the grill. This gave it a great outer layer akin to cooking with the skin on. The chicken was moist and flavorful. I think this would also be a great way to cook up some fish steaks (salmon comes to mind).

My Family and I loved this! The only complaint we had (well my mother and I) was that it was too mustardy and could use more honey. I would also recommend cutting it into thin sections because it allows you to really balance the sauce with the chicken more.

Love this and it was a hit with everyone.  I used Worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce and marinated the chicken for a couple of hours.  Delicious!

We really liked this. Only marinated the chicken for 30 min or so, would probably marinate longer next time. But it was good with some of the sauce, I set aside prior to marinating, brushed on top. Yum!

Perfect!  Marinated chicken for 5 hours and grilled.  Served with sauteed onions and mushrooms and a little extra sauce drizzled over the top.  New family favorite!

What a great recipe!  I followed all but used worcheshire sauce and added a little minced garlic and parsley.  I cooked the chicken breasts on the George Foreman grill.  A different spin and great flavor.  Served with wild rice and french style green beans.

Excellent chicken! Very tasty sauce yet so simple of ingredients. This sauce really makes this chicken rock. Did not think the sauce was too sweet or too tangy, just right. i thought I was going to have to cut down on the amount of honey but did not need too. I doubled the sauce, reserving a little on the side for a dipping sauce later. I marinated the chicken in the rest of the sauce for 6 hours. I grilled the chicken on one side for 10 minutes on medium high heat, then 12 minutes on the other side. I let it sit a minute before slicing it horizontally. The juices ran clear and the chicken had the nice grill color to it (probably from the honey).  The chicken was juicy and tender with flavors of honey mustard in each bite.  I had two thumbs up from my family.

Made this tonight for dinner and the sauce was to die for.  The only problem that I ran into was the sauce burning to the meat.  Next time I will baste at the end. Will make again

This was fantastic! Just happened to be on this website late this afternoon and saw this recipe. I had boneless chicken thighs and was planning on a pasta dish. Soooooo glad i did this instead! Very tasty and the chicken was super moist! A keeper in our house!

This dish was great!  The only thing I did different was that we brined the chicken before cooking to keep it nice and moist.  Other than that served as is and we thought it was wonderful :)

This would have worked out better if I did it a regular grill instead of the George Foreman grill but I could tell that it was an awesome recipe. The Foreman just couldn't handle two thick chicken breasts :/  I also doubled the sauce amount and also added a little bit more honey to the mixture to sweeten it up a little more.

Super Tasty! I used Worcestershire sauce since I didn't have steak sauce, and I marinated them for about 24 hours. They came out super moist and yummy! Will definitely make again!

Followed recipe exactly, tasted amazing! This is perfect for those who are not big on spicy flavors but still want to have good taste! The only thing I do different is grill the chicken to cooked before basting so no cross contamination & don't need to use two basting brushes.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe it was not as good as I thought it was going to be. The chicken was tender but the flavor was a little bland. I doubt if I will make this again.

Easy and tasty recipe.  I didn't have steak sauce so put in a little soy sauce and a little worcestershire sauce to substitute.  Everything turned out fantastic.  Thanks for a great and quick marinade/sauce!

OMG! This dish was absolutely scrumptious and so quick and easy to make. I reserved some of the sauce for dipping and used the rest to marinate the chicken for about 30 minutes at room temperature before grilling on George Foreman grill for 6 minutes. Served chicken with steamed broccoli and a side mix green salad with walnuts, sun dried tomatoes and Gorgonzola.

Pretty good, didn't get 5 stars because it didn't knock my socks off, but it was easy enough to make and my husband liked it. I might try a different type of dijon mustard next time.

I also sub'd Worcestershire for the steak sauce, and thought this turned out REALLY well. I didn't save enough of the honey mustard for basting though, and there was a lot left over after coating the chicken. Next time (tomorrow) that I make it, I will use less for coating and more for marinating the last 10 minutes.

like the mayo in the sauce, really adds extra tang.  Probably don't need nearly as much honey as the recipe calls for.  I cut it in half and we really liked the results.

So simple, but soooo good. We use it on pork too.  Everyone in the family thinks it is great. I use it just about every week. I made it with the mayo, but it doesn't really need it.

This was alright.  The rest of my family liked it, but I guess it just wasn't my favorite.  However, I loved the sauce!  I served the chicken with sweet potato fries, and the sauce tasted amazing with the fries.

This was good and easy!  And I had everything on hand.  Perfect for a weeknight meal.  Not that my two-year old would eat it, but once he actually starts eating anything besides PB&J I'm sure he'll like it.

I've made this twice. It's great and very easy! I marinated the chicken in the sauce for 15 minutes before grilling for extra flavor. Very kid and husband friendly. Next time I plan to make a few extra pieces for a sandwich or to add to a salad.

Make extra sauce for dipping - not very strong flavors.  Marinating for a few hours may help as well.

WOW! This was one good chicken recipe. The end result tasted like chicken smothered in McDonalds Honey Mustard Sauce, which I love. I chose to bake mine at 350 for 35 minutes, and the chicken was so tender and juicy. I will make this again baking it, but I think it'd be wonderful grilled! Can't wait to try that!!(I was just too lazy to grill tonight)

Excellent recipe! I cooked this on an indoor grill and I didn't have steak sauce so i used worsheersire sauce and the honey mustard was DELISH! I wasnt extremly impressed with the grilled chicken itself because it didnt seem to soak up the flavor of the sauce so next time I plan on frying chicken and using the honey mustard to dip it in. Super easy to make!

The honey mustard was good, but not great. It tasted just the same as the stuff in the squeeze bottle. I waited until the chicken was cooked to pour some of the honey mustard on it as many reviewers suggested. I didn't like the after-taste of the mustard, and therefore will not be making this recipe again. Thanks, though!

We loved this sauce. I made the sauce and poured it in a slow cooker; I didn’t have any chicken so I used pork chops, delicious! The mustard and honey came through but not over powering! Next time I will use chicken. I also think it would be good on cooked veggies.

I made this last night, and it was delicious!  I'll definitely make it again - frequently.  :)  I doubled the sauce recipe and fried bone-in thighs on the stovetop.  The next time, I'll marinate the chicken in the sauce for an hour or so before I cook it. I can't wait to try it on the grill.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was not a fan of this recipe because I thought it was too sweet but my boyfriend thought it was delicious! So for people who like sweet food this would be a great recipe. for people who do not might want to stay away from this one.

Tasted great!  I didn't have any dijon, but did have "horse radish mustard" and it worked well.  Very tangy, spicy and slightly sweet.

Perfect!  The only sub was "light" mayo.  The chicken stayed moist and the glaze after grilling left just a touch of sweetness.

Delicious! The chicken was tender and the sauce is absolutely wonderful. Even my child who claims to hate mustard loved it.  We've tried this on salmon too and it's great!

great recipe!  i used a teriyaki sauce because i did not have any steak sauce and it turned out great. i grilled on a stove top grill pan and the chicken stayed so nice and moist. my husband is a picky eater and really loved this--and especially loved adding some more of the sauce that i had set aside before to it after!

Good sauce, I used worstershire instead of steak sauce. However, it flared up my grill since it was so drippy. I'd think better under broiler than gas grill.

This is a phenomenal recipe! Cut it in half as I only needed it for two breasts. Put them on the BBQ and basted every so often...didn't change a thing! AMAZING! I would imagine it also tastes good cold the next day tossed into a salad.

Hands down one of my favorite things to make on the grill.  I don't change a thing but I do baste and baste and baste throughout so there are layers of deliciousness! Only downside: Wish I knew how to clean the grate properly after...

Excellent,I didn't have time to marinate because this was a last minute meal. We were tired of the same grilled chicken and wanted a different flavor. I came upon this recipe that I saved to my recipe box. The marinade was easy and fast to put together. We just basted as it cooked and the chicken was so moist. Can't wait til next time, I will plan to marinate. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy to make, and everyone thought it was pretty good, but not fabulous. My husband thought he might have cooked it a bit too long. I used the same sauce on tofu for me, and it was good too. Thanks!

I needed a quick "stuff in the cupboard" recipe for chicken tonight.  This turned out great.  I will definitely keep on my list of quick and tasty meals.  I will even try to use the sauce for homemade nuggets!

I loved these and couldn't get enough.  My husband said they were too bold, and he loves everything bold.  He didn't like the dipping sauce either, he said it was too strong.  My 5 year old didn't like it either, but that was no surprise.  I will definitely make again for me though...simple and delicious!

this was probably the best chicken i've ever made. i doubled the sauce and set about 1/3 of it aside for dipping. i let the chicken marinate for about 45 minutes while the grill got hot. i turned it about every five to seven minutes and basted the chicken with each turn. i generally cook my chicken on a lower heat when i'm basting so i can keep adding layers of flavor. this was a huge hit and i sliced the leftovers and used in a honey mustard wrap. just made it last week and i am making it again tonight for a neighbor.

This was fantastic!  We just bought a grill for the first time, and I decided to try this recipe out - perfect flavor for grilled chicken!  The chicken was extremely moist and the marinade was not overwhelming.  I will make this again and again!

The sauce is great, really tangy and delicious!  Super easy to make, I served with grilled asparagus using some extra sauce to brush on the asparagus. Great recipe!

This recipe has real potential, however lacks depth,as is. I agree, the sauce should be doubled, but in different proportions. To make it "gourmet":  After browning the seasoned chops and covering them, saute a small shallot and one clove garlic, both finely minced. When shallot and garlic have  softened, add 1/3 c hot chicken broth, 2 Tbsp. good balsamic vinegar, 4 Tbsp. orange juice concentrate, 1 teasp. Dijon mustard and 1/3 c raspberry preserves.  Bring to a boil, stirring to loosen the browned bits.  Add juice from the covered pork chops as well.  Reduce sauce slightly to thickness desired and lastly, stir in 1 Tbsp. butter in small pieces, stirring to dissolve.  Place chops in sauce, simmering about 3-5 minutes, turning to glaze with sauce. Present chops on hot polenta or mashed potatoes with a fresh sprig of thyme on the chop.  Serve with steamed asparagus or green peas.

This was really good. My family really enjoyed it and everyone was asking for the recipe. I omitted the mayo as I didn't have any. I thought it was a little too sweet but everyone disagreed and thought it was perfect as is.

WOW! A keeper.  Simple and DELISH.  I used it on grilled breasts and wings.  I also used other suggestions of doubling the recipe to have dipping sauce.  I will be making this over and over and will not change a thing.

Wow, I was definitely surprised!  It's true what they say, the fewer the ingredients, the better the flavor and it really shows in this case!  The sauce was perfect for my butterflied and grilled chicken breasts to which I added a little lemon zest for my own personal touch!

OUTSTANDING chicken recipe. I followed the marinade ingredients exactly, but marinated for about 3 hours before grilling. This was so moist and delicious and the mayo really is the secret ingredient to perfecting a honey-mustard chicken sauce! I made extra for dipping and this one will definitely be a keeper.

My family loved it!  I actually doubled the Honey Mustard and used 5 table spoons on 6 sliced read potatoes and 1 medium onion and 2 tbs or butter that I tossed on the grill in aluminum foil for 20 minutes.  I used the remaining to both chicken breast and pork loin.

This was great! simple and tasty. I used Worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce, and plain yogurt instead of the mayo. Way better than the stuff in a bottle!

Very good!  This sauce is pretty versatile.  I used it to baste a whole chicken for roasting.  I put the sauce in the cavity, between the skin and the breast and in the cavity.  I also filled the cavity with a few onion pieces. We loved the flavor and the chicken stayed moist, (but next time I use this to roast a chicken I may inject it with some reserved sauce to boost the flavor a little more).  I reserved some sauce for basting and then with what was left over I tossed with quartered potatoes and carrots.  Then put on a cookie sheet with a little olive oil and roasted in the oven at 450 degrees for 25 - 30 minutes, making sure to use the bottom rack.  Wonderful!!!  The veggies roasted while the chicken rested so the timing worked out well.  Will definitely make again and again.  Nice change from the usual roast chicken!

Very good! When I made it for the first time, my boyfriend and the kids we were babysitting loved it! The whole dish was gone in minutes! We only cooked this once, however, because we like the Deviled Chicken recipe on this site better. But we do use this recipe as the dipping sauce for almost all our chicken recipes. [only change: spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon mustard... RECOMMENDED]

This was an easy recipe.  I thought the honey mustard was good, although I didn't think it got all the way through the chicken.  So I think next time I might either, marinade the chicken in the honey mustard, or flatten the chicken so the flavor gets in more.

I used spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon (that's what I had on hand), but otherwise followed the recipe. The chicken came out moist and juicy and the honey mustard sauce was amazing. We used the left-over sauce to dip the chicken in.

This was seriously the BEST chicken marinade I ever had. We BBQ usually 5x a week and this by far was the tastiest. I kept everything exactly the same, just tripled it!! You have got to try this. Soooo good.

This was very good.  Grilled chicken breast can be very bland and uneventful, but this sauce made it absolutely flavorful.  My husband really liked it and he's hard to please.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This was one of the best chicken recipes I've ever made! I doubled all of the ingredients so I could have extra dipping sauce and it was amazing! We turned the chicken about every 4 minutes (for 20 minutes) and it grilled perfectly. We served it with tinfoil packet of mushrooms, onions, peppers, and zucchini/summersquash. I will definitely make again!!

My guests loved this more than I did, but it was very good. Next time I will use a spicy mustard. I think it just need a little more bite.  I cooked it in my Nuwave (which I love) and it came out very juicy. They thought I used a special kind of chicken :)

This was quick and easy. I made basmati rice to go with it. The mustard flavor didn't really come out as much as honey. I'll try adding more mustard next time. Great recipe.

YUM!  I didn't have dijon (sigh), so I used regular mustard, and it still turned out WONDERFUL!  I grilled this on a stove-top grill pan because we don't have an outdoor grill.  I also used chicken breast tenderloin cuts, since that's all I had in the freezer.  I grilled it until the sauce reduced down to a gooey caramelized mess and it was DELICIOUS!  I was afraid the chicken would be dry since I cooked it so long, but it was tender and flavorful and so yummy!  Made extra sauce for dipping, as others suggested.  My mom is coming in for a visit next week and I can't wait to make this for her!  I served it with some roasted vegetables and yellow rice.  I will make this a regular meal for sure!

This was a really good recipe!  The honey mustard alone is great and I will be making this by itself for salads in the future.  I continually basted the chicken on the grill so it would not burn too quickly.

The whole family loved these. I marinated the chicken breasts in the sauce for about 45 minutes. Then I grilled them on my George Foreman Grill for about 10 minutes. We then toasted some buns and made them into sandwiches. YUMMY...I grilled a couple tenders that I marinated as well for my 3 yr old since she won't eat the sandwich, she loved them!! And I agree that you should make more of the sauce for dipping...I used it on my sandwhich too.

I liked this, but my husband said he didn't care if he had it again.  I would like to give it 4.5 stars.  I made it as is.

It was good, although I did do it on my Foreman grill, I will bet the actual grill would have been better, I do not recommend the Foreman, only because it was such a pain to clean up afterwards...sticky sauce :)

I thought this had pretty good flavor...I didnt have chicken breasts...I had legs.  But I think this recipe would work with any part of the chicken.

This is an awesome recipe when you didn't have the foresight to marinade or decided to grill at the last minute. It offers a big taste with little effort or time. Do note that the flavor is bold, so if you prefer milder food, avoid this one. The sauce is top shelf and I will use it for a perfect dipping sauce down the road. I doubled the sauce, which was great for dipping the chicken, particularly the inside meat that wasn't exposed to basting. Connie, it's a winner. Thanks.

I'm sorry, but I just really didn't like this. I am from the south and our honey mustard is usually very sweet and not really mustardy. This just didn't taste like I had hoped. It was sort of bitter and really just tasted like Dijon to me.

Very good and very easy.  I used worstershire sauce as I didn't have steak sauce. I made extra for dipping as others suggested but found we didn't need it since the flavor was great right off the bbq.

I omitted the mayo and the steak sauce. I added a little carribean jerk season with one habanero liquefied into it in the blender before mixing with the other ingredients. Turned out wonderful if you like heat :) which I love.

This was good.  I think the sauce would be better suited for a dipping sauce than coating the chicken.  Maybe chicken nuggets or a little on a sandwich.  It is tasty and only takes like 3 minutes to make.

We don't use steak sauce so we didn't have any so I had to use Worcestershire sauce and added a pinch of chili powder. I broiled the chicken and served with roasted red potatoes.

This is really good. I followed the recipe as written. But instead of dipping chicken into the mixture I just poured some over it. That way we had some left over to dip in. But you really don't need it as this chicken has a very nice flavor to it.

I was looking for a marinade for grilled chicken and decided to try this. I look for simple recipes without several ingredients, and this one looked easy. I let the chicken only marinate for 2 hours, but it made the chicken very juicy and moist! I left one chicken breast out of the marinade and basted it with BBQ sauce on the grill (I was worried my picky daughter might not like this recipe), but I was very wrong! She ate 1 1/2 chicken breasts, and I was left with the dry, tough, BBQ chicken! I also didn't make extra dipping sauce, but I definitely will the next time I make this.

Not my favorite recipe.  Too much mustard taste and too sweet.  I let the chicken marinade for about 3 hours, maybe it was too much.  I prefer the honey mustard for the Aussie Chicken MUCH, MUCH more.

Excellent recipe and very easy, too! I followed it exactly and had plenty of marinade leftover. It would easily have been enough for 8 chicken breasts. Next time, I might try marinating overnight.

I used spicy brown mustard (like someone else suggested) and just eye-balled the rest of the ingredients.  Mine marinated most of the day (maybe 6 hours?) and it was sooooo moist!

This was a yummy recipe.  I had to change it a little...I used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon.  I only used 1 teaspoon of mayo b/c I didn't think it was needed.  I didn't have steak sauce so I omitted it.  I agree with the other folks, leave some of sauce to the side so you can dip your chicken in it!

I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled the sauce for dipping as suggested by other reviewers. We gave it an Asian twist by wrapping the chicken, some stir-fried veggies, and a little Gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste) in a spring roll and then dipped it in the extra sauce.  So delicious!!  Suprisingly, the Gochujang really complimented this honey mustard sauce. The chicken is great by itself as is, but we made it an entire meal this way (a rather healthy one too!).

Everyone agreed that this was a ***** recipe. I didn't change a thing, and I only had about an hour to marinate. I definitely recommend making extra sauce for the table. This is a keeper. UPDATE - I use this recipe all the time. It is even good if you simply grill chicken with S&P and make some of the marinade for dunking.

I was getting tired of having bbq chicken, so we tried this. I personally am not a big fan of honey mustard, but my husband and 4yr old son liked it so it gets 4 stars.

This was great!! I don´t even like mustard but I thought I would give this a shot and it was so good!! I did however, bake it in the oven for 35 min. at 220 degrees C. I bet it would taste even better on the grill!! My bf liked it too, and said it was a great combo of flavors!! thx!

Very good. This is being put in my recipe book. I love how its sweat at first, then it becomes tangy from the mustard.  Also good as a dipping sauce.

Great recipe. I will omit the mayo next time completely to make it a little healthier. I had planned to do it this time as well but I used a spicy dijon that would be a bit much for my kids so I'll play with different mustards.

Made this tonight and cooked on George Foreman Grill.  I did marinate it for 3 hours before cooking.  I didn't keep any sauce for dipping (BIG MISTAKE!)  My husband loved it.  I didn't tell him what it was.  The mustard would have killed it for him. 

He wants me to put it in our regular rotation.

Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

This was amazingly! Perfect amount of flavor and SO juicy. We made double of the sauce and used it to dip and baste 6 drumsticks. Perfect amount with some left over for dipping, tho we didnt need it, so much flavor already. Really watch it because it will burn fast(a couple were a lil black, but still good) This one is a keeper!

Make more sauce for Dipping! I didn't think my picky eaters would eat this, even though many other reviewers stated their picky eaters ate this dish. My two year old who doesn't eat more than two bites of anything we cook actually gobbled this up and went back for more! I didn't have steak sauce so I used worcestershire sauce and just a touch of molasses since the honey gives a lot of sweetness already.

I modified this recipe by adding a bit of horseradish to the honey mustard sauce. Also, since I don't have an outdoor grill, I used my George Foreman grill. I think this recipe would be better if it called for the chicken to be marinated for several hours before cooking. I didn't do that and the flavors didn't seem to stick. Also, I second the suggestions to keep some of the sauce for dipping after the chicken is cooked.

I made this last night with some chicken tenders. I let them marinate for about an hour. I wasn't all that impressed. I might hang on to the recipe to keep as a dip for the breaded chicken I make.

This turned out excellent!! The sauce was the best. I cooked it on my foreman grill so it cooked a little quicker. I also reserved some of the sauce for the top.

My husband decided to make me dinner the other night (a first!) and found this recipe. He marinated the chicken in the sauce for ~6 hours, and then reserved extra sauce (before marinating) for dipping.  It was great grilled chicken. The honey made it slightly charred, but great with dipping sauce!

This recipe was wonderful. The flavors were light but made a huge impact. I didn't grill my chicken, but baked/broiled them. They still came out well, but next summer I will definitely have to try my luck on the grill. I'm sure it will come out better.

This was GREAT!!! the chicken came out so moist and delicious. My husband loved this receipe. With the little leftovers I made a couple of sandwiches for our lunches. I recommend let the chicken marinate for a couple of hours...at least! Definitely I will cook this again.

I used plain yellow mustard and a little whole grain mustard. This marinade is SO GOOD!  I marinated it for a few hours, then baked it in the oven. Chicken came out very moist and flavorful.  I will use this one alot. Thank you!

I marinated the chicken in this for several hours while at work and then threw it on the grill (low heat so not to burn the chicken) I made an additional batch of the honey mustard sauce to dip it in. Overall, my husband and myself thought it was pretty good and would make it again in the future.

Loved this recipe.  Made it indoors on the contact grill. Didn't have Dijon, so used a spicy mustard.  Then, just added the Honey and Miracle Whip, as I didn't have mayo or steak sauce.  Turned out terrific!  And, do make extra for dipping.

Dont really care about the taste. Maybe next time I should marinate it to make the flavor at least stay with the chicken. Thank you for the recipe. Will try to make it again one more time, but marinate it first.

I made this last night with a few changes. First off, I doubled the recipe to use for dipping, putting on the chicken and for a sauce for potatoes. I also didn't have dijon mustard on hand, so I used 3/4 cup of mustard with horseradish and 1/4 honey. I doubled the rest of the ingredients the same. I like the heat that the horseradish provided. Next time I might try it with a little less mustard and more honey. This was really great though and an easy weeknight meal. I will definetly make this again. My kids loved it, even with the heat from the horseradish.

This was really good and juicy. I used boneless skinless thighs, because that's what we like. I cooked it on the George Foreman grill, and it came out great. Would probably be even better on the regular grill.

Our chicken was very flavorful and juicy, however, I just used the O'Charley's honey mustard I had on hand, so it was super easy!

YUMMY!!! I love BBQ! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because I don't like chicken breast it's always so dry! It needed to be cooked about 20 minutes longer but it was GREAT!! I loved the flavor. Hubby & daughter loved it! I'll be saving this & making it AGAIN & again!

Tasty and so simple.  I made this for Easter dinner with friends.  I made sure not to tell them it had dijon mustard (they are kind of weird and don't like 'foreign' food).  But the gobbled it right up.  Success!

Very good recipe.  I mix the ingrediants until I get the taste that I am looking for.  I use most of it to marinade and then keep the rest for dipping.  This is an awesome marinade, and an even better dip.

Excellent! Made just as recommended. What a yummy sauce....I did let my chicken marinate in the sauce for about 6 hours....delicious! Dijon is definately the key....I did use low fat mayo and bold and spicy A-1. Will make again!

I forgot to pick up dijon mustard at the store so I ended up subbing yellow table mustard for this recipe. It still turned out really well and I am looking forward to the leftovers in a fresh salad. Next time though I will have to use Dijon, as I suspect that it would add more complexity in flavor. Thanks for an easy dinner idea!

Delicious, soft and tender...used worcetshire sauce in place of steak sauce, cause did not have any.  I reserved some of the sauce for dipping, which the kids loved to do. Grilled on george foreman for only ten minutes. Served on a bed of lettuce, tomatoe wedges, sliced red onion, drizzled with evoo, salt and pepper.

Great recipe! I agree with all previous additions and deletions.  I did find the chicken bland.  What I did the second time was to brine the breasts first for about 2 hrs (better if overnite) in a palmful of salt and water just to cover. Remember don't use any salt after brining, but feel free to use other spices, this also "kicks the favors up a notch". I also added 1/4teaspoon curry powder to the sauce.  Yummy!

Good but note that it is a little sweet.  I prepared the sauce without the steak sauce and tasted.  There was little to no difference in comparison to the bottle of store-bought honey mustard in my pantry.  So next time, I will make it even easier and use prepared honey mustard.  Also, I suggest that you taste your sauce after adding the steak sauce.  I used A1 and doubled the amount to cut the sweetness.

This is a simple and delicious way to spice up plain old chicken breasts. The chicken stays soft and juicy. I only marinate it for a few minutes and the flavors are fabulous. This has been the most requested chicken recipe in my household. Enjoy!

I let it marinade overnight and kept some honey mustard separate for basting.  It was very good.

I read a number of reviews before I made this recipe. One thing I saw over and over was that a lot of people felt that the Honey Mustard Chicken was bland. So I made this recipe a few days ago it was a huge it with my family. I sprinkled the chicken in seasoning salt and pepper and put it in the fridge. I made the Honey Mustard sauce seprately and put it in the fridge (Never marinated the chicken in the sauce). Once the chicken was on the grill I glazed it (several time for about 10 minutes) with the Honey Mustard Sauce.  In the end the chicken had a great carmalized covering of honey mustard.

It wasn't as flavorful as I wished (maybe marinade it longer? We were short on time so we only did it for 30 mins.), but the sauce is VERY yummy!

This just did not work for us. Unless you really love honey mustard, I don't recommend it. I marinated overnight, so maybe that was the problem. The taste and smell was really overwhelming, not to mention the aftertaste. It was edible, just didn't care for it.

I loved this recipe! It was really tasty and the chicken was moist. I used chicken cutlets instead of breasts so they would cook evenly and using the grill is the best part. They get really brown and still have a touch of the sweet marinade on them.

This chicken was great! It was full of flavor without being too sweet, plus it was quick to make and really easy. I used a little more steak sauce to give it more kick, and made another couple of extra servings of sauce to pour on the chicken after cooking.

This was a really tasty honey mustard sauce.  As other suggested, I pounded my chicken thin and marinated it for several hours.  I also used a combination of stone ground garlic mustard and dijon mustard.  The chicken turned out really moist, and I was glad I had extra sauce for dipping.  I served it as a sandwich, with swiss, bacon, and tomatoes on an onion roll.

Very flavorful. Made it on a Foreman grill, and the only bad part was that the grill chars the outside before fully cooking the inside. On an outdoor grill (or a bigger Foreman grill, maybe), this would probably be perfect.

Just used this as a marinade with yellow mustard and worchestershire sauce because that is what I had. Marinated chicken pieces for about an hour and then grilled. FABULOUS. Served leftovers cold the next day and they were excellent, with a nice hint of the marinade flavor. Will definitely have this as a regular recipe.

This chicken left my family asking for more, more, more. We ate over a pound of thin chicken breasts! Very tasty, but make sure you watch your grill, so it does not burn. One of my pieces did burn on one side just a little.

This was delicious.  After grilled, you can barely taste the honey mustard, but all of the flavors blend nicely.  I will definitely make this again!
