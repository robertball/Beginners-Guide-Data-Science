This syrup was delicious!  I made this for my mom and she loved it.  Make sure you use coconut milk and not cream of coconut, which is a much thicker, sweeter product.  Also, I shook the cans of coconut milk and found that there was a big difference in brands.  I bought the one that was the most liquidy.  Great and different!

I recently returned from Hawaii where I discovered the delight of coconut syrup.  I was excited to try this recipe and wasn't disappointed.  It's a little difficult to blend the coconut into a smooth consistency, but it was still delicious and on a sunny day, I could imagine the beaches of Kauai!  It's great on pancakes, waffles, ice cream . . .

This was excellent!!  The coconut syrup I had in Hawaii was white but with this syrup it doesn't matter because the flavor was amazing!  Thank you!

I have used this recipe before and it was wonderful. For those of you who feel it can be grainy due to the coconut flakes (even after blending), strain the syrup before service.

I am giving this 5 star, because the flavor was delicious.  The only problem I had was the consistancy.  It is runny like a syrup, but it is a little grainy(even though I blended it a while.)  I served it over banana bread and ice cream.  Both were delicious.  I bet is is great over pancakes.

This tastes really great, but didn't come our quite like syrup (more solid), but it was great as a spread, maybe I didn't heat it long enough.

I was getting ready to make this when I realized that the ingredients list calls for "coconut milk" and the directions refer to "coconut cream"  There's a big difference in the 2 so I'm not sure which to use.  Anyone?  I gave it 3 stars anticipating it will be as wonderful as the other reviews say.

Very yummy syrup!  I served this with the Hawaiian waffles with pineapple and coconut recipe from this site.  It was great!  I think it would also be good with ice cream.  I will try that next time! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this to go over banana pancakes and the flavors blended great. It was also super easy to make with little mess. Reminded me of Hawaii. Would also be good over macadamia nut pancakes. Yum!

This is so much better than the so called Coconut Syrup one gets in Hawaii ... 
You can actually taste the coconut !...
I used an immersion "stick" blender before cooking the Coconut Milk, Coconut and Sugar, and the coconut is barely perceptible ...
I changed the recipe by using plain White Sugar instead of Brown Sugar to keep the syrup white, as opposed to having the final product, tan ... 
A bit more appealing to me and mine ...
Sooooooooooo GOOD ...

This was really good and really rich.  My 12 year old wanted to eat it by the spoonful.   I used coconut powder and used my immersion blender to puree it.

If you leave out the flaked coconut, it has the consistency of syrup.  We liked it - it definitely had a different flavor than we had in Hawaii, but it's sweetness complimented the crepes I made very nicely.  I think the flavor depends on the type of coconut milk you buy - light or regular fat - as well as the brand.

A little sweet, but all I could find was sweetened coconut. With sweetened coconut, I'd use more coconut milk, and about 2/3rds the amount of sugar, which I'll try next time I make it. Other than that the reason this gets 4 stars is for the texture with the coconut pieces, which limits it's uses as a syrup a bit. Next time I'll put it through the blender and see what happens. I made this with buttery crepes, and the taste was pretty gorgeous.

My kids have pancakes and sausage for breakfast once every weekend just so they can eat this syrup.  Next time, I'll run it through a strainer; the consistency with the coconut reminds me of icing for a german chocolate cake.  Not that that's a bad thing.  My kids love it!

Reading these reviews got me super pumped to try it!  I wonder how it would change the recipe to use fresh coconut milk.  I am not very experienced in the kitchen... any advice?

This is sooo dang good!!!! I use unsweetened coconut and it is plenty sweet.  Or I'm sure using half sweetened and half unsweeted would be great too.  I have quiet the sweet tooth though and using the unsweeted is plenty sweet!

I had the All Recipes calculator figure the ingredients for one serving.  I found that, as sweet as this recipe is, that produced enough for two people rather than one.  It will remind you of German Chocolate Cake icing if you don't blend out all the flakes.  Very good stuff.

Oh... I wanted to like this sooo much!  It was just too, too grainy.  No matter how many times I ran it through the processer, I couldn't get a smooth syrup.  I love coconut, but my family couldn't get past the texture in order to enjoy it.  Sorry!

I wish I could rate this higher, but I'm guessing that I don't care for coconut milk...Is it supposed to taste so sour? I processed coconut flakes til they were pretty fine. I had no problem with those. Otherwise, was pretty good.

Tasted great, although I did have trouble with the consistency. I used coconut milk instead of coconut cream. Goes well with pancakes, or absolutely anything if you like coconuts!

Taste on our pancakes was pretty good.  I wasn't so sure when it was made.  And the color was not what I wanted.  I wanted a milky look and texture.  I would use less sugar and probably go with white sugar as the coconut was also sweetened.  All-in-all thought, when it was mixed with our unsweetened fruit sauce, it made for an "island" tropical taste on the pancakes.

I HATE using my blender, so I left the coconut flakes out.  Still very coconuty, with a smooth syrup-like texture.  I used lite coconut milk (not coconut cream).  Served on top of French Toast soaked in an egg/milk/coconut rum/unsweetened coconut flake mixture, and topped with toasted sweetened shredded coconut.  Delicious!

I made this several years ago to go with banana pancakes for my mom's birthday.  Even though I didn't blend it (didn't want to wake up the 3rd shift worker sleeping upstairs), it came out great.  I didn't have anything to compare it to, but Mom had tried it in Hawaii and approved this version.

This was great!!  I had coconut syrup from Hawaii when I was a kid and I never stopped thinking about it.  I found this and decided to make it.  One thing I must say is use C&H Brown Sugar, no fake imitations!  Also use the best coconut you can get your hands on, not the store brand stuff.  Yum!!  I want to use this for Rum drinks too!
