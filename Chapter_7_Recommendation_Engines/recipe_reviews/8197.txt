I have this recipe too, and my family and friends love it, but my recipe comes with a yummy glaze that keeps it moist for days:  melt 1/4 cup butter in a small saucepan. Stir in 1/8 cup water and 1/2 cup sugar. Boil for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, stir in 1/4 cup Southern Comfort.  After removing the cake from the pan, prick top of cake. Brush half of glaze evenly over top and sides. Cool cake. Reheat glaze and brush over cake. Before serving, sift 1 tbsp powdered sugar over cake. Delicious!

Let me preface my review by saying I used this recipe as a starting point.  I made some substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I used a chocolate cake mix (w/o pudding), a pkg of chocolate instant pudding, and replaced the Southern Comfort with 1/4c dark rum and 1/4c coconut rum.  In place of the walnuts I used about 1/2c of coconut and 1/3c pecans (I didn't measure these).    I baked 8 mini-loaf pans, 12 mini-muffins, and a small ramekin, adjusting the baking time accordingly.  They are SUPER - the only thing I'd probably do differently is either stick with all coconut rum or add a little coconut extract.  I imagine it would be equally good using just plain rum if you don't care for coconut.  This seems to be a very versatile recipe and will be a keeper for me because of the ease in substituting ingredients.  I'm also considering a lemon cake/pudding with lemon bacardi rum this summer to serve with strawberries.

I made two of these cakes recently for a food fair at my school.  The cake was incredible, but I did do something a little different.  I used cold water instead of milk and pecans instead of walnuts. Overall it was incredible and EVERYONE loved it, and were pleasantly surprised!

This recipe was great, I received lots of compliments from our guests.  The cake looked a little plain, so I just sprinkled icing sugar over the top and it looked store bought.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe!  I also make it with a glaze over the top.  Glaze consists of butter, powdered sugar, and a splash of Southern Comfort.  Sprinkle the top with powdered sugar after the glaze is set and this cake it to die for!

Was a fabulous party cake that everyone loved.  Some even suggested it was better than sex. I did use the suggested glaze which I believe completely made it even better.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe and for the following suggestions!

I could not stop eating this cake.  The only change I made was using pecans instead of walnuts.  I want to try this recipe with chocolate cake and pudding too

Excellent recipe. I've been looking for this recipe forever.  Everyone at the party loved it. Would not really recommend for kids, because of the alcohol .

This cake is the BOMB. I made it over the weekend and it turned out fabulous. It looked a little plain so I made a drizzle of Southern Comfort and icing sugar. It was soooo good. I will make again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good, very moist and easy to make.  Next time, though, I will either leave out the walnuts or use pecans instead.  I didn't think the walnuts added much to the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Had to hide the last slice from my kids & their company. The only changes I made was after the glaze, drizzle cake with vanilla frosting (warmed in microwave oven for a few seconds), for a lovely presentation

This recipe is nearly identical to a Bacardi Rum cake recipe I made years ago and have been looking for.  I couldn’t remember the ratios, but you just sub the Southern Comfort out for rum and the walnuts for pecans. Awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing! I used to make mine in a tube pan, but yours is so much prettier.

This works great with 1/2 cup of coffee substituted for the liqueur.  I like to use yellow cake mix with chocolate pudding.  I've made it that way 4 times now and the whole family loves to munch on it all week!  So good!
