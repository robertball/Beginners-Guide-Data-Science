This is a very good recipe.  After searing it for 10 minutes each side, I cooked it on the "cool" side of the grill on a small sheet pan covered loosely with foil.  It took 40 minutes to cook perfectly.  I served it with grilled potatoes and BLT salad. 
I'll definitely cook this again.

WOW!  This recipe was fantastic!  The *only* thing I subbed in this recipe was celery salt for garlic salt, b/c that's what I had.  My picky, picky husband loved it-he usually has to eat any meat with ketchup (yuck), and he said that this didn't need any.
I almost gave it four stars, just b/c I am new to indirect grilling on a gas grill, but the instructions are clear as to what to do.  Five ++++ stars for taste alone, this will now become a staple in my recipe collection.

The best grilled pork ever!  I sliced the pork first, and then rubbed all over each peice (not excessively), so it would be more flavorful and cook faster, and it tasted absolutely fabulous!

Come on people try this one!  Five star hit.  I made this for a bunch of people and it was gone in no time.  I only got a little piece myself.  I let the rub marinade a couple hours in a zip loc and put on the grill for about 2 hrs on low after searing it first.  Let rest for 25 minutes and you won't have any complaints.  Thanks for this recipe pork board.

Oh my goodness!!!  This was excellent!
I followed the recipe to a T. (other than the fact that my grill cooked the meat a little faster then the recommended time) and it was fabulous!  My husband absolutely hates pork loin and whined when he heard was I was serving.  He was half way through his meal when he looked up and said "this recipe kicks butt!!  I love it!"  That isn't easy to come by in this house!  Thanks so much for an excellent and super easy recipe!

Thanks to everyone who rated this five stars!  I prepared an 8-pound loin using this recipe on my grill's rotissie and all of my 7 guests raved on how tasty the finished dish was.  It took me only about 50 minutes of grill time.

This was SO easy and so flavorful!  I marinated it for 24 hours because dinner plans changed the day I planned to grill it.  Here's what I'll do differently next time:  1) sear it on lower heat - it was too hard on the outside (bit too overdone); 2) cook it less ... I think next time I'll remove it from the grill 5 degrees under the "done" temperature, as it contines to cook as it sits and it was a little dry.  It was still delicious, first day and as leftovers.  I served it - as another recommended - with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce (from this site) and Baked Applesauce (from this site).  It was a GREAT dinner!

This was very flavorful and easy.  I only had a 1.5lb tenderloin, but made the same amount of rub, using garlic and onion powder (3/4 tsp. each) and 3/4 tsp salt (because I only had unsalted versions of the above and didn't want to overdo it w/spice and salt).  I also prefer brown sugar and used that instead of white sugar.  Since we no longer have a grill, I decided to cook it in the oven in a the Pampered Chef covered baker.  At the last minute I panicked about its being too salty, so I sliced up some red potatoes and threw them in the dish, hoping they would soak up some of the salt.  As for oven temp, I followed package directions, baking at 425 F for 40 minutes, no longer.  When it came out of the oven, the temp read 170 F, so I probably could've cooked it for a little less time, BUT, it was NOT dry!  In fact, it was very moist and flavorful & the potatoes were delicious, nothing was too salty.  I ordinarily do not deviate from the recipe upon first try and I usually don't go into such lengthy detail in a review, but I just wanted to make the point that this is a very versatile recipe that can be adapted to certain situations and it's definitely a keeper.  Thank you!

OMG! This was so good. Very tender, moist and flavorful. I replaced the regular chili powder with McCormick's Chipotle chili powder for a little extra kick. That's the way I like it!

Excellent recipe, and easy to use. The rub is really good. We used Cowboy charcoal on a Weber grill. I can't believe it gets any better. Will definitely do this a gain, soon.

This was amazing, I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, gave it a really really nice sweet crusty coating. My husband doesn't really care for pork but loved this one.

All I can say is if you have a roterrise, USE IT!.  All of the elements were perfect, however the outside burned black during the "browning process".  You really need to pay attention while grilling.   Nice flavor, but process issues.

Tried in the crockpot and was very disappointed. After reading the reviews I expected something fantastic and this just didn't even come close.

The family really enjoyed this, and it was a snap to prepare on the grill.  I followed the recipe as written, but I didn't have coriander.  I was out of onion salt, so I subbed 3/4 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon onion powder.  I'll try it with brown sugar next time around.  You can't go wrong with this rub!

Wow! This rub is excellent! I am out of garlic salt, so I subbed garlic powder and added approx. 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt. Worked out great. We were running a little late for dinner so hubby cut the pork roast into thick chops. We rubbed the olive oil and then sprinkled the rub on all sides of each chop, seared them on high and then cooked over indirect heat. Several of the kids said these were the best pork chops he has ever grilled. We will use this rub on other meats and use this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

One of the best pork loins we've had in a long time.  Made 2 changes to rub:  subbed onion and garlic powders for salts to cut down on sodium, and brown sugar for white- personal preference.  Glad we have leftovers for sandwiches and green chili!  I plan on making a larger batch of the rub to keep handy.  Thanks NPB!

I had a short time to make dinner and it was raining so I simply cut my loin up into steak like pieces, coated them in the rub and placed in a pan in the oven.  Not perfect but it had a wonderful taste and Hubby LOVED it!  I can't wait for nice weather so i can do it properly on the BBQ!

This was our first time grilling a pork loin and it was fabulous! We used a much smaller loin -- only 1.8 pounds -- so the cooking time was only about 45 minutes total. I'm thinking of just mixing up a jar of the rub to have on hand, making this super easy to throw together, with virtually no clean-up.

After I put the rub on, my husband took me out for dinner.   24 hours later, I threw it on the grill.  It was still fantastic.  It had a great flavor.  I just wish it was a little spicier.  My husband thought it was amazing.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family is not the biggest pork fan, but I had the pork loin defrosted and thought I'd try it. We all loved it (kids and mother-in-law included)!  Was super juicy and flavorful...and easy to make!  I left out the coriander b/c I didn't have it and added a little more cumin.

OH MY GOSH!  This is incredible!  The flavor is awesome.  We let the meat marinate in the rub for about 20 minutes before putting it on the grill.  Incredible!  We served it with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce.  This will become a regular meal in our house!

My husband bought a 7-lb pork loin on sale so I came to this site to find help. I was out of onion salt, and subbed parsley for the coriander. I seared as directed on a very hot gas grill, but because of the size I couldn't turn half the grill off. Instead I turned the heat to low and moved the roast to the upper rack to finish cooking. WOW is all I can say here! I cooked it fat side up and it came out fabulous. I will make tj again for company.

This was very, very good! Definitely rub the pork a day ahead of time and let it marinate... it does a lot to spread the flavor through the meat.  I also throw this roast in the oven at 325 for an hour to two hours depending on the size of the roast (my 6 lb roast took about 1 1/2 hours).  The rub is pretty spicy, but delicious.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used a little mop sauce to keep it moist during cooking but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I definitely recommend this, and like others who have made this, I agree that the rub probably would be good on all pork cuts.

Good Recipe...Thank you!

I did sub garlic powder for garlic salt. Seasoned and refrigerated for 30 min. Seared on the stove then put on the BBQ. I used sour cream, honeymustard dressing, chipolte peppers & sauce and chipolte seasoning to make a dipping sauce. Was a big hit with everyone.

Great basic rub for loin on the grill.  You can adjust the seasonings to make it compatable with your side dishes (add cumin if you're doing Tex-Mex, more garlic and oregano for a Greek flavor, etc) but I'd suggest making it once the way it's written to know what you're starting with.

I made this last week and it was awesome! I used onion powder instead of onion salt and omitted the coriander.  My picky husband said it was one of the tastiest pieces of meat he's ever eaten! He was still raving about it the next day when he ate it cold.  My only suggestion is to watch your cooking time, it didn't take near as long as the recipe stated.  Use your meat thermometer for best results.

Most amazing pork roast ever! I omitted the onion salt (didn't have any) and everyhing else was the same. Let the roast sit in the rub for about 2 hrs then seared in cast iron skillet on both sides and popped it in the oven. Came out so moist and so much flavor! Won't be using any other recipes for pork roast! Goes great with applesauce

Had to do some minor substitutions using what was on hand, like leaving out coriander.  Other than that, followed the recipe almost exactly.  Cooking method was perfect.  This was the juiciest and tastiest pork loin I've ever had, even reheating the leftovers, it still tasted like when it was first grilled.  Delicious!

The rub on this was great! My boyfriend is the "grill master" around here so I rarely attempt to grill meat but after reading some reviews I gave it a try. He loved it! He even asked me if I could make the rub again for a meat he was going to grill.

This rub was great.  I did use onion powder and garlic powder instead of onion salt and garlic salt because it is what I had on hand.  To compensate, I threw a little sea salt into the mix.  This was my first time ever grilling a pork loin and the directions were very clear and easy to use.  The meat was delicious and tender.  I'll definitely keep this recipe in my rotation.  Thanks for sharing it!

I made this one night this week and we really enjoyed it.  The instructions for cooking on a gas grill were perfect, although I had to adjust the cooking time as I had two small tenderloins instead of one larger one.  I tented the meat with tin foil for ten minutes after taking it off the grill.  The pork was very moist, as were the reheated leftovers the next day.

I have made this a couple times now and love it!  The sugar adds a nice crunchy exterior while keeping in the juices.   I did substitute the granulated sugar for brown sugar and it turned out great!

I made this last night using two thick boneless pork loin chops.  This is simple and quick and has nice flavor.  Hubs seared this at a lower temp than usual because I told him there was sugar in it.  Well, having done that we didn’t get a good sear or good grill marks, so I’ll have him crank it up next time.  I applied the rub in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated until dinner.  During that time the moisture in the meat dissolved the sugar and the chops were quite wet when he put them on the grill.  That could be another reason we didn’t get a good sear.  I’ll definitely do this one again, but may rub the chops just before grilling and crank up that heat!

We brined it first for 24 hours in 6 cups of water, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup of sea salt.    Let that sit in fridge overnight.  NEXT DAY:: Then took it out and seasoned it as this recipe says and grilled at 500 degree direct heat fat side down for 10 minutes.  Then flipped fat side up for 10 minutes.  Then moved to indirect heat (on grill burners that are not on) got temp down to 350 and let grill for an hour.  Pulled it when internal temp got to 147.  Let sit for minutes and sliced.  DELICIOUS!

This recipe is great. I cooked it just like it says. I lost my power for a week. My kids are really picky eaters (3 boys). They ate it all and asked for more. There was none left. I would also like to say that I had never cooked on the grill before that is more of my husbands thing. It was VERY EASY came out perfect and was not dry. Thank you. I will be cooking this often.

Wow, this is excellent!  I made it for a cook-out with friends on Friday night and made it for the family tonight (Tuesday), so obviously we liked it!  I like to cook pork until it reaches 155 degrees because it still cooks internally after you take it off the grill.  Biggest caution is to not overcook it, so stay on top of the temperature.  A good meat thermometer is not an option with pork.

Tried this tonight on the grill because of all the great reviews and it did not disappoint! My daughter LOVED this and she basically won't eat meat. I did not have coriander and subbed a little Irish Curry...yum! Makes me thing a curry rub would probably be good too. Try this, it is reaaly good.

What a fantastic rub!  I used it for a grilled tenderloin, and everyone loved it.  I was out of coriander, so I added a bit of curry powder instead.  I will definitely make this again.

This was awesome!  I used a smaller roast, that had a considerable amount of fat on the outside.  It was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten.  The flavors were complex and aromatic.  Simply wonderful.

A real winner!  I didn't have coriander, but it didn't seem to make any difference. Wonderfully tender and flavorful.  My kids (one is a really picky eater) and my husband loved it.  I served it with oven-baked french fries and a salad, and 
WOW-a great meal!  It cooked much faster than the recipe suggested: I put it on a medium-hot grill, and it was ready in 22 minutes. I let it rest for 10 minutes and it was perfect: juicy and tender.

This was a very flavorful rub, and it smelled great!  I didn't have any coriander, so I left that out.  I let it for a few hours in the rub, then we put it on our smoker and smoked it overnight.  Delicious!

This recipe was AWESOME!  One of my favs from this site. I used a pork tenderloin and didnt have onion salt so I just subbed onion powder and added salt.  I would rather use the garlic and onion powder that way I can add the amount of salt I want. Super delicious!  Make sure to watch it on the grill because the sugar will burn it pretty fast.

This is a really good recipe.  Lots of people  have their rub mixtures - this one is superior.  I brined a 4 lb pork loin for 1 1/2 hours (in the fridge) then put the rub on and let it sit out for 30 min to get to room temp.  I basted it right at the end with the "Rice Vinegar Basting Sauce" recipe from this site.  Can't tell you about the cooking time because I ran out of gas right at the end and had to finish in the oven.  My wife said it was the best pork I ever made.  I did a few boneless chicken breasts exactly the same way (shorter cooking time, of course) for my guests who don't eat pork.  These were also great.

I made this for my parents 25 anniversary. I used a whole pork loin, and I grilled it for 10 min on each side on hot, turned down the heat and put it on the top rack of grill and let it cook for another hour or so. It was tender and juicy, and well liked. The whole loin fed about 50 people.

I made this exactly as written except it rained so I cooked it in the oven on 350. It was so good. Definitely my favorite pork roast recipe now. I was slightly scared of the coriander, and there was no reason to be. In fact, I think the coriander added a brightness to the roast. It kept the other spices from being flat. Husband liked it too, and he's not a big spice lover.

I smoked this with a pan of applewood chips over the burner and took it off at about 145 degrees; otherwise made exactly as directed.  It was done (medium well) in approximately 45 minutes, and was tender, juicy, and tremendously flavorful.  Delicious!

Best pork loin roast I ever made. I unintentionally made changes, the roast I had on hand was 1.5lbs and it marinated for 2 days. I took it off the grill when the internal temp reach 155 then wrapped in foil and set aside. It was so juicy and flavorful, just perfect. Thanks for sharing!

Oh my gosh!  This was so good, and the instructions for grilling were outstanding.  I grilled my 2 pound loin 10 minutes each on 2 sides at the highest setting, and then lowered the coals halfway for the next 20 minutes for the last side.  I needed to add about 5 minutes to reach the 160 degrees.  But it was so succulent!  The only thing I did badly, and it's not the recipe's fault, was not to add some salt when I used onion and garlic powders.  It could have used a little bit of salt. That was my bad, so this recipe rates 5 stars and then some!

Well done, Chris! This DOES take me back to the Gulf Coast! 
I followed this to the letter (but used smoked paprika), and it just ROCKS!
This is going in my recipe box, and you will have to forgive me if I forget to give you credit when my wife finishes raving about it!

Turned out rather blah and tasteless.  It didn't seem to absorb much of that barbeque flavor at all.  I've made baked tenderloins before that turned out much better tasting and also much more moist.  It's edible but I will be smothering in sauce as unfortunately this turned out to be very plain tasting.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe at all.

This was definatly 5 stars!  Served it for Easter with Amy's Cilantro cream sauce and was a huge hit!  My husband did the grilling, the directions were easy to follow and the result was fantastic!  Bought 2 more loins today so I can make it again!

This may be the best pork loin I've ever had, and I turned 2 non-pork eaters into pork loin believers!  My only addition was 18 hours in a pineapple juice marinade before cooking, and I quartered the loin for faster grilling and more surface area for the rub. Served with a pineapple-raisin-ginger chutney, this had everyone asking for seconds!

This was a wonderful recipe and very easy to prepare.  The rub is very flavorful.  I cooked on a gas grill, and fortunately checked the temperature after 60 minutes, as it was done to 165 at that point.  After letting it rest for 5 minutes it was done perfectly.  Highly recommended.

I used this recipe the first time I attempted grilling a pork loin roast on my gas grill.  It definitely was a success; I allowed the rub to marinate on the meat approx 30-45 minutes prior to grilling.  I also trimmed the "silverskin" off the roast prior to applying the rub (I like mine very lean).  Total grilling time for me was approx 30-35 minutes on a 3-burner gas grill with middle burner turned off.  Very easy recipe with good result.

I just made this tonight. I did soak my pork in a salt brine for a few hours before rubbing and grilling it. It was delicious. My hubby said it was the best pork he head ever had. I'm just glad I doubled the pork because now we have lots of leftover.

I'm always looking for tasty, simple ways to feed my extended family when they come to visit.  Between food allergies and picky kids, it can be challenging.  This recipe is incredible.  I change nothing about the recipe.  My family always asks about it when they are preparing for a visit.  Thanks so much!

This was really good.  I did not have any coriander so I subbed Adobo seasoning and my husband and son loved it!  Cooked on rotisserie for exactly 60 minutes and it was juicy and delicious.

I use this recipe often for grilled pork loin. The cooking temps and instructions are perfect for the 3 burner gas grill I use.

Absolutely delish!  My boyfriend and I argued for an hour how we were going to cook the pork loin.  Found this and had my mind made up.  Glad I did!  No complaints, in fact probably best pork loin I've ever had.  I only grilled mine on the BBQ for 45 minutes.  I had a smaller but thick piece of meat.  Didn't have chili powder so I threw in some spicey taco seasoning lol since I thought it would have it in there.

This rub is very Good, and it's super simple! I would venture say this rub would work nice with any cut of pork.

This was tasty.  The rub seemed to hold in all of the juices for the meat.  A nice grill recipe that doesn't need a lot of attention.

In my quest to make dinners under $15.00, I found a 4+ lb. Pork Loin on special for $8.25. I mixed up this rub exactly as written, but subbed Brown Sugar for the White. I covered the Pork Loin with the rub at 7:30 am and put it in the refridge for the day. I couldn't face the BBQ in our current heat wave and got out my Rotisserie (Set it and Forget it Ronco Oven)and cooked it in that for 52 minutes. I let it rest for about 20 minutes after cooking. Sliced thin and served it with corn on the cob and green beans and a salad. Perfection. Thanks for the great recipe! Will definitely use this again!

Just tried this recipe tonight. I got a good char on both the fat side and the trimmed side of the loin, but had to continue turning the loin, as the fat side rendered a lot of drippings onto the coals, and created flareups. After the twenty minutes of browning/charring, I wrapped it in foil, and set it on the indirect side of the grill.  Temperature after browning was about 96 degrees F, and it climbed about one degree per 35 seconds, until about 130 degrees. At that point it raised about one degree per minute, and I pulled it from the grill at 145 degrees. I left it in the foil, and it continued to rise for about 15 minutes until it reached 160 degrees. I cut it very thin, maybe about one quarter inch, and kept the drippings (still in the foil) to create gravy and reserved some for dipping. Nothing like dipping your pork loin in its own rendered fat. 

Great recipe, everyone was very satisfied.

Excellent rub.  I didn't change a thing except left out the coriander because I didn't have any.  I rubbed it on pork chops.

This was the most amazing port tenderloin ever.  I followed the recipe to a tee, and grilled it for about an hour and 1/2 on the charcoal grill.  It smelled heavenly, and there was more than enough for leftovers.  Will definitely make again!!

Great!  I doubled the rub and rubbed the roast early in the day - wrapped in plastic and refridgerated until it was time to cook.  Will make again and again (when pork is on sale!)

I seared the loin right on the cooking grate at 600 degrees for the ten minutes a side, I then moved it to a raised rack and cooked uncovered for an additional 70 minutes at 400 degrees turning occasionally to an internal temp of 145 degrees. I let it rest for 10 minutes sliced for serving and the juices just flowed from it!! It was served with baby red potatoes roasted with Rosemary, garlic, butter, and some Vidalia onion. I was amazed, my guest said it was the best pork loin they had ever eaten. Juicy and fork tender. I will definitely be cooking this recipe again

Delicious. The only thing I omitted was the coriander and only because i didn't have any. I followed the gas grill method mentioned. It did cook quicker than noted - 60 min. This was so juicy. The juices from resting were used to make the gravy. Will definitely be making this again.

Good flavor. Took 60 mins for 2 1/2 lb pork loin. Next time I might poke holes in it too give inside more flavor. Then wrap w foil n grill. Also made in oven 350 degrees for 1 hour..

This is great. Very good flavor. I used a smaller pork loin so you definitely have to adjust cooking time. Roughly 45 minutes for a 2lbs pork loin.

Ok, have to share my story about this recipe! Last night I was going to make a pork loin the "usual" way I make it.  When my son asked what was for dinner, I said pork and he said Eww, yours is always dry.  Then, I got home and my husband asked what was for dinner.  I said pork and he said Ewww..I'm not in the mood for your pork.  So, last night I went on strike and did not make dinner at all!  Today, I woke up and went on a mission to find a new pork loin recipe and stumbled upon this one.  I've never done a pork loin on the grill, but thought what have I to lose?  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except my pork loin was about a pound and a half.  I seared it for about 7 minutes on the grill.  Cooked on indirect heat for 30 or so minutes.  I cooked on a baking sheet wrapped tented in aluminum foil.  Let it rest for 10 minutes and it is amazing!  My husband just said - Don't make pork any other way - ever again!  My son gave me a thumbs up...all is good.  I am happy and for once didn't cook a dry pork roast!  We all thank you for this recipe!!!

Very good dry rub that gave the meat very good flavor. The cooking method is spot on. I did cut a 4 lb pork loin in half, as it is just my husband and I. I brined one half in a simple brown sugar and garlic brine for 6 hours, rinsed and patted dry before putting rub on and cooking on grill as directed only cutting time down to 35-40 minutes after initial browning sear on each side. The other half used dry rub and wrapped in foil allowing meat to rest for 4 hours. Then cooked in slow-cooker still wrapped in foil for 2 1/2 hours on high. Unwrapped and shredded using two forks to pull apart into bite sized pieces. I had made a homemade apple butter bbq sauce the day before and reheated it adding the pulled pork, We ate this on onion rolls from bakery. Both meats turned out very moist, juicy and flavorful! Thanks for sharing the recipe and thanks to the two cooks who suggested the two forms of cooking and serving!

I made this the other day and it was great. I didn't use the loin though. I had A shoulder in the freezer so I decided to use it and I was pretty heavy on the red pepper. Quite the crowd pleaser.

This is awesome! I made it this past Saturday! I added the seasonings, and wrapped it in foil and refrigerated overnight. Put it in the slow cooker (in the foil) on high for 4.5 hrs and then grilled it. I reserved/added back the juices and shredded my pork. Then added some Apple Butter BBQ Sauce! Served on buns! It's only Tuesday and I have requests for it already!

I was surprised when i found this to have 5 stars and said i had to try it! my dad is really not a fan of white meat so i knew i needed something to knock his socks off to help keep him on track of healthy eating. I did cut out a bit of the sugar and a bit of the salts to lower the sodium intake but it was still amazing. this is the t ype of thing that proves healthy eating is possible! thank you

Brillant!!!  This was so yummy even my picky 6 year old came back for second and thirds.  All 5 of us loved it but watch the cook time, I cooked a 6lb loin for 70 minutes and next time will taked it out 5-10 minutes sooner.  It was still moist but could have been a little moister.

Mmmm, this rub was so good on a pork loin. I had bought a couple pre-marinated pork loins, and found I didn't like the flavor. I figured a rub would do the trick. This one was perfect. It was slightly sweet, very slightly spicy, and just had good all around flavor. I grilled the meat according, to how we always do it. It was about 10 min. or so on each side on about a medium heat. I made the full recipe and realized my pork loin was only 2 lbs. I saved the rest in an empty spice jar. I plan to use the rest, definitely. TY

This rub had a good flavor, but we did add bbq on the side.  I baked it in the oven instead of using the grill.

Delicious.  So simple and so flavorful.  Followed directions exactly.  I did use a meat thermometer to make sure I didn't overcook the pork.  Definitely a keeper.  Try it!

Wow.....this was delicious! I didn't have coriander, so I substituted a little bit of parsley and thyme. I used my charcoal grill and browned each side about 8 minutes, then it took about 50 minutes to finish. It came out moist and flavorful....the best pork loin I've ever made!

I roasted the pork loin in my oven instead of cooking on grill, mainly because it was frigid outside.  I did broil a few minutes on each side first.  It turned out great!

I LOVE this recipe! Elegance on a budget! I've made it at least 4x for company so far, to rave reviews each time. I had never made a pork roast before in my life. This recipe is very easy and inexpensive. I had most of the seasonings in my kitchen already. I like to make the rub a day ahead of time. I have a disability, and it hurts to stand for a long period of time, even though making the rub takes only a few minutes. In order to reduce the sodium in the recipe, the subsequent times I prepared this dish, I substituted the garlic salt for garlic powder and the onion salt for onion flakes. There wasn't any difference in the delicious taste, and my fingers did not swell up the day after eating it. 

I've cooked this both on the grill and in my oven, adjusting the time cooked for the size of the pork loin I used. It comes out great either way.

This meals makes yummy leftovers, too, so cook a larger roast and freeze leftover slices for another quick and easy dinner. Saves money and time.

I make this once a week.  My family loves it.  I only keep recipes in my recipe box of those that I don't have to alter the recipe at all. It's perfect the way it is. I do place in oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes per pound instead of the grill - it's just easier for me.

This was perfect, I modified the rub a little based on a no-refined sugar diet my wife and I have been observing. So we used brown sugar instead and I think it made it even better! Tip for a standard Weber-style charcoal grill: stack all charcoal to one side against the bowl. Only sear each side 5 minutes (burns fast if left longer) and then take off-heat but cover and seriously, leave it alone for 30 minutes before uncovering  to do a temperature check. Massaging the olive oil in well also helped prevent it from drying out which pork can do in a heartbeat if you're not careful. Great recipe.

I only used this for the cooking instructions. But with garlic powder,seasoned salt, black and cayenne pepper this turned out amazing. My family demolished the entire tenderloin in just minutes. Goes great with yellow rice and tomato gravy.

Wow!  This was excellent and easy!  The rub is amazing.  It would be good on grilled chops too. I used 1tsp each salt, onion powder and garlic powder in place of garlic salt and onion salt since I didn't have them. I marinated for 4 hours before grilling.  The loin did not take nearly as long to cook as directions stated.  My 4 lb. loin cooked fully in under an hour.  I followed cooking directions and cooked on one side without heat and left heat on the other side.  It came out perfect and moist.  A meat thermometer is a must so it doesn't get overcooked.  This served 4 adults and 4 children with a little leftover.  I made Amy's Cilantro Cream sauce from this site to serve with pork, and it was a big hit!  I will make this again!

I didn't have all the spices on hand so I just used salt and pepper. I used a roasting rack on the grill since indirect heat was not an option. The timing was perfect and even though I overcooked it just a smidge, it was juicy and flavorful. I will definitely buy the recipe spices and do this again and again! Thanks for another great recipe!

This was really good and really simple. Will it replace bbg pork aka bbq butt, no. But this made a nice juicy pork loin with little effort.  I cut the recipe in half (2.5 pork loin). I used garlic powder and my own salt. I never quite know the proportions of garlic and salt in the commercial mixes so  I avoid them . Onion salt never tastes like either,  I never use that vile mix and left it out.  Other than that modification  I cooked on my Weber E320 over med-lo off med-lo for 50 minutes and we had a perfect 148 degrees. No flipping required.  My roast had a nice 1/4 inch layer of fat on top,   No sauce required.  Also added some pecan chips to my my smoker box on the weber.  It worked well with this recipe..  The outside was perfect not at all black just a nice yummy blend of spices and herbs.

This was delicious.  I also basted the pork roast with a red pepper jelly glaze of red pepper jelly, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard and apple cider vinegar (found on another site) for the last 10 minutes of cooking.  It was incredible.  JIF

Delish, thank you for sharing this recipe! I increased the dry rub ingredients by about 1/2 tsp each and added oregano, used a tbsp of olive oil, added brown sugar instead of white and pork savory instead of cumin and coriander. Seems like you can make this with any combo of dry spices, the key is the indirect grilling. After searing all sides, I placed the roast on an aluminum pan on the unlit side of the bbq and loosely covered it with tin foil. The roast was about 3 lbs and required just under 20 mins per pound. It came out fall apart tender - this one's a keeper!

I use this recipe all the time with all my pork loins, leftover's make great fried rice or pork stir fry.  My family loooovvvves this recipe!  I use all the spices except instead of garlic salt or onion salt I just use the powder and then use salt.  We take a loin when we go to a cabin ever year and bake it for about 3 hours on a low setting and it turns out wonderful and juicy every time and makes great pulled pork sandwiches for the next day!  On the grill I do cook for 10 minutes on each side, then wrap the loin in foil and place over indirect hear for 1-1.5 hours depending on the size.  Meat thermometer is Key!!!

I don't usually care for pork roast, but this recipe rates a WOW!! I prepared the roast early in the morning so it could sit in the refrigerator all day. This is a keeper!

My guy bought a 4# pork loin out of the blue and wasn't wild about slicing it down to boneless chops, so I found this recipe and decided to give it a go:  WOW!  Substituted dill weed for the coriander (really thought we had some), and a 2:1 mix of salt to garlic/onion powder for the seasoned salts.  Didn't pre-sear the loin, as that seems to increase the cook time to more than "about 1-3/4 hours".  The indirect-heat method yielded a perfect "sear" all around.  Sandwiches the next day were delicious:  try using leftover coleslaw for a nice, crunchy bite!

Best Pork loin I've ever pulled off of my grill.  The outer bark has just the right blend of spicy sweet while the center of the loin was moist and tender. I did cook until it reached 165 on the meat thermometer instead of 145, as I have a healthy fear of under cooked pork.

Just finished eating this... it was great! I used Cajun seasoning instead of chili powder, let it sit about 20 minutes before putting it on a preheated grill. I had a 3 1/2 lb roast so I only did 8 minutes each side to sear it nicely then moved it to the side for 20 minutes before rotating it (not turning over) for another 20 minutes. Let it rest for 20 minutes before slicing. Very flavorful and juicy. Will make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I agree with everyone else... 5 stars. Rub can be altered based on ingredients. I used onion powder and celery salt instead  of onion salt and didn't have coriander so skipped that altogether. Still came out terrific.

This came out perfect. I didn't make the rub from scratch, but had some on hand. (Had the grandson tonight.) I cooked it at 400 deg. 10 minutes each side on my Big Green Egg and then put it to the back of the Egg for a little under an hour at 400 degrees. You can cut it with a fork. So juicy and tender. This is a keeper!

My husband thought this was five stars and I thought it was three (but I generally don't love pork). I had a tenderloin and it cooked much faster than expected...it was 150 degrees about 20 minutes after searing for 10. I really liked the cooking method, but you definitely need to keep a close eye on temperature. I would make this again.

I've been using this site for years for nearly every recipe I've made and I just had to comment on the two that I made tonight! I made this recipe with just a couple modifications. I used smoked paprika and added chipotle powder to the rub; and I added some molasses to the EVOO spread in the beginning. I let it marinade for a few hours, first. There is a gas grill built into my back porch, connected to the home's gas line. VERY convenient, but I prefer charcoal to gas and I'm sure this would taste even better had I used charcoal! Anyway, the only settings on the grill are HI/MED/LOW with no thermometer. I left it on MED for 20 mins, and the bottom side was a little crisp/slightly burned, but looked beautiful. I turned it down to LOW and flipped the meat over. After 15 mins, the bottom was burned! The temp was only 130, so I put it in the oven for 20 mins as I finished the sides and it came out super juicy! I used the grease that dripped in the pan to sautee some asparagus, and wow! I will be trying this rub with other meats :) Thanks for sharing!

This was amazing, tender, juicy and delicious.  I loved the rub and there was enough to cover my entire loin.  I made this recipe as is with the only exception of no coriander because I didn't have any. Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

Easy to get ready and BBQ. The seasonings add to the flavor of the pork, but does not overwhelm it. You could easily serve it with warmed BBQ sauce, or I like just plain jarred pork gravy. I have made it twice and my husband reafirmed that this is a keeper.

Excellent recipe and spice combination. Used ancho chile powder in place of regular Chile powder on a 2.7 lb roast and it took about 40 minutes after 10 minutes of charring/browning. Thought the person who had issues with browning the roast was a bit unfair. Seems that he doesn't grill meats often. Why would you let it burn? You do want some blackened bits though! All grills are different, know your grill! The flavor of the meat was great and it turned out juicy with a 15 minute rest before slicing. Served sliced on homemade Kaiser rolls with side of coleslaw. Think it would pair well with an apricot or plum chutney. Might try with chipotle powder or smoked paprika next time for a smoky twist. Definitely company-worthy! Thanks.

Made this for Mothers Day.  It is AWESOME!!  I used roasted garlic olive oil and then rubbed the roast down. Then I sealed it in a vacuum bag and let it marinate for 2 days before browning on a gas grill and then finishing in a 325 oven (too windy to cook completely outside). My son-in-law couldn't make himself leave the kitchen!!  I now have another roast, prepped the same way, in the smoker. I will update you on how it turns out. SMOKER UPDATE: This method turned out great also. We used hickory smoking chips. I prepped the loin much the same as for grilling/baking. Only I butterflied it and laid some fresh sliced garlic cloves down the center, added a little of the rub and then tied with kitchen string. I should have either added more rub to the center or  injected the loin with some garlic/butter marinade just to get a little more flavor to the center. But otherwise the recipe is a definite keekper!

I consider myself a very good grill master, but mostly with family recipes. This is the best pork loin I have ever fixed on the grill. The rub is incredible. When it was time to put BBQ sauce on, my wife suggested that I only do it on half. I am so glad I listened, which I never do when it comes to cooking, I couldn't decide which part of the loin was better. I let mine cook a little longer than the 90 minute recommendation, but it was incredibly moist and tender...like eating cotton candy...don't worry if it burns a little, that makes it good...

I baked instead of grilled, but this is a fantastic rub! Will definitely use again! The only change i made was celery salt instead of onion salt, as mentioned by another reviewer, just due to what was on hand. Really a great recipe.

Loved this rub!  You know it is great when guests ask what kind of rub you used.  I used powder instead of onion & garlic salts and it was nice to pile it on and not have to worry about being too salty.  Will definitely be making it again.

Delicious. I modified the blend and used it on a pork butt that I'd bought mostly because it was marked down. I cut down the chili powder because the kids don't like too much heat. I also used 1 teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder instead of garlic and onion salt and added 1 teaspoon kosher salt. I covered the meat the rub and covered with foil then baked for about 90 minutes. I had to taste it even before it cooled and tender and delicious it was. It will become the base for our meals this week.

This was an excellent recipe.  I didn't have any garlic salt or onion salt so I just used garlic powder and sprinkled a little salt over the loin.  Other than that I followed the rub to a "T," very tasty.   I had never grilled a pork loin before, but I followed the gas grill instructions and it worked wonderfully.  It took about 60 minutes for my 5 pound loin to cook.  Will certainly make again.

Wonderful!  The instructions in this recipe made it easy for me.  I used a gas grill and warmed it up on high heat,  then reduced burners to low and browned the roast as indicated in the recipe.  It took 25 min. to brown all over, then moved to indirect heat and turned burners on med.  Covered, the grill came to 450 and I grilled for about 1 hr.  When the meat therm. registered 140, I removed the roast and wrapped tightly in foil.  I sat it in a styrofoam cooler for 1/2 hr. and when we cut into it - that roast was melt-in-your-mouth perfection.  The crust was so good and the meat was tender and tasty to the center!  The whole family raved.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was delicious. The only thing I done different was baste with butter after it was seared.

This was really good.  I do agree with another review that you really need to watch the meet and determine time and cooking temp based on your grill.   This was a great way to cook pork without heating up the house.  Rub was good.  Wish I had let it marinate longer.  The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is that my family does not like so much garlic.  Will cut down on that next time.

I really like this one.  I don't use garlic or onion salt, I used onion and garlic powder and salt as needed.
My grill runs hot so for the indirect cooking part I was at a med/low setting so it would not burn.

great flavor. decreased cooking time for a much smaller loin, and it was still great and very easy, the first time I made. Last night (2nd time), I even messed up the grill and turned the section on low instead of off, and it still came out great.   Keep the rub around for other uses as its got a slightly sweet, slightly spicy flavor!

I didn't care for the chili powder in this spice rub.  It was okay.

Love this recipe ..I use it OFTEN...most times I cant grill it so I sear the outsides ( sometimes I don't ) and then stick it in the oven...still comes out awesome.
