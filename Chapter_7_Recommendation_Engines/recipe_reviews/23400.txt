This was a bit too bland. I made itr for Christmas brunch.....I did like the crispy texture however....I would recommend using a bit more spice such as cinnamon....probably personal preference

I served this as one of the dishes for a Sunday brunch this morning for 8 guests, and it was a success.  I used skim milk, substituted Splenda for the sugar and cinnamon for the nutmeg, and sprayed the baking pan with PAM.  I think a cinnamon raison bread would be yummy but as I try to eat whole grain products, I used whole wheat bread.  I may add some raisons next time and make half with nutmeg to see which flavor we like best.  My company had a choice of eating it plain (which was fine) or topping it with pourable Splenda, sugar, syrup, or fresh strawberries.

Very good for low fat.  I used cooking spray instead of butter to grease the pan and it still tasted fantastic.

easily the best french toast i've made yet - rewarding, unique, and not terribly difficult.

i took the advice of a previous reviewer and added more cinammon and nutmeg - also used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and used spray for the bottom of the pan instead of butter. and i'm a pecan lover, so i used more pecans than called for.

turned out wonderfully, and really impressed my husband, who still hasn't figured out how i managed to get breakfast made before he woke up.

I dont usually comment on recipes, but I couldnt help myself this time. This recipe is truly outstanding! It was very easy to make, and eventhough I didn't have any nutmeg and didnt add any orange zest, it still turned out delicious! I did however add 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and increased the vanilla extract to 1/2 teaspoon(personal preference). I also melted the butter and mixed it in with the rest of the ingredients. After cutting the (french) bread I then diped/soaked every single bread piece into the bowl of ingredients. I single layered the pan with the soaked bread, placed in refrigerator overnight, 5 hours later I flipped every piece of bread over and placed back in the refrigerator, 4 hours later I took out of fridge and sprinkled the pecans on top. I then placed in oven as recommended at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. The whole fam loved it, including my hard to please little brother :-)! I will definitely make again!

This was my first attempt at baked french toast and I thought it was delicious, especially considering it's somewhat "healthier" than many of the other recipes I looked at.  None of the others I served it to used the maple syrup I set out; they seemed to enjoy "as is".

Makes a classy brunch for family or friends, it was a big hit.  I used fresh Vienna bread from our local bakery, and made it the same morning - slice your bread a little thinner and it still tasted delicious, the warm bread soaks it up fine in two to three hours.  Top with maple syrup, rasberries or blueberries and invite friends!

This recipe was delicious and very easy! I sliced the bread a little thicker using the full 1# loaf which exactly fit into a 9" x 13" pan to soak it overnight and it worked fine. The only thing I left out was most of the orange zest.

YUM!!!! Love this recipe!!! I didnt soak it overnight and it was still delicious. I turned it a few times in about 10 - 15 minutes time and it turned out wonderful. I also used my electric griddle to cook it and then I added a little butter cube on each piece and sprinkled it with the chopped pecans... this was a great hit and I'll be making this one again.. especially for company since it was so easy and so tasty!!!

used a little less sugar and sprinkled cinnamon on top. also used 1/2 c less cream.  poured egg mixture over bread then flipped instead of dipping each individual slice.  spread syrup mixture on top and let sit over night as well.

The first time I tried this recipe, I followed it to a "t"..but by adding more wet ingredients it prevented it from drying out in the oven.

This was awesome. I did not use all the grated orange peel- I got too tired grating it and ran out of oranges. I made three loaves of bread.  My sister who was not wearing her glasses cut the first loaf into thin- think thinner than sandwich bread slices, the second loaf was about 1/2 inch slices and the third loaf we cut into approx 3/4 inch slices.

They all tasted great. the thinner ones of course took less time to cook. the thicker slices you definately want to cook longer to get that crispness.

We had leftovers and just wrapped them up in foil for the next day. They reheated well in the oven. 9 people ages 7 to 50 all thumbs up!

This was OK...rather bland as the top reviewer mentioned.  I had the problem that mine stuck to the baking sheet.  With lots of syrup on it, thought it tasted good especially with the hint of orange and the crunchy pecans.  Will try a new recipe next time.

I'm rating this 5 stars because I think it would be a 5 star recipe if I hadn't added too much bread.    I did just over 1/2 loaf on a baking sheet and the egg mixture wasn't quite enough for it all.  Thus, some pieces were a little dry.  If I'd used a 9x13 pan, it would have been perfect.  The orange juice & zest give it a wonderful flavor.    Will definitely make again.

A very good recipe! Very filling! Had a delicious sweetness and the orange zest added a perfect touch of flavor! I, like the others, had to bake the toast longer. All together, I baked for close to 35 mins. The ones on the end were crisp, however, the slices in the middle were still slightly soggy.

Very good, guests were impressed (and taking second helpings). I didn't add the sugar to the mixture, but sprinkled a little sugar after pouring the egg mixture over the bread. I turn the bread immediately, to help even coverage, and sprinkled the other side with sugar. I omitted the orange zest, and greased a pizza tray with butter to bake the toast.

This was awesome! I even made it with homemade sourdough bread, which made it even better. Loved the flavor of the orange and pecans. With the thick slices of homemade bread, I cooked it a little longer than the directions - just until it was crispy and no longer mushy. This is definitely a keeper.

A great French toast recipe - especially if you don't want to be cooking over a griddle. I used skim milk, brown sugar, freshly grated nutmeg and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon. I left out the 1/3 cup of butter entirely. Since I didn't have any orange zest on hand, I added 2 tbsp of Grand Marnier to the egg mixture. I sliced the bread 2 1/2 inches thick (reminiscant of a brunch I recently had at a trendy place in the south end of Boston).  I soaked the bread for an hour and baked the French Toast for 35 minutes in the same dish - I had read that it was sticking for some people, but used a non-stick pan and took it out immediately after removing from the oven (a bit did stick - but it was so much easier than using two pans). And before serving, I sifted some icing sugar over the top of the dish. Yummy! Great recipe Wanda.

Great! I, too, added cinnamon to the mixture, about 1/2 teaspoon and then sprinkled a little more on top before baking. I do have a problem with them sticking so I've started spraying the pan with spray before adding the butter. Very good recipe. My family loves it and it's pretty easy to make.

This was easy to make and tasted pretty good too.     I loved how quickly it was to make the night before and there's minimal work in the morning.  If you don't like the taste of orange - don't make this - it was quite strong.    Thanks for sharing.

I made this for Christmas morning and found it to be very tasty.  My husband doesn't like soggy french toast, so I did not make this ahead.  I made it just before cooking it and used rustic french bread to keep it from getting soggy.  I really enjoyed this and will definitely make it again!

My family loved this recipe.  Wanted a special breakfast for Easter and we got it.  The only thing I did was add a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe.  My daughter who doesn't like French Toast absolutely loved this.  Not too sweet, just right in the flavoring.  We served it with just a little butter and sprinkle of powdered sugar.  Thank you very much for sharing this recipe.

Delicious!  I had to use Splenda instead of sugar because most of my guests were diabetic but it turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

this is great! I avoid cooking the nuts as this alters the good fat in them so I just sprinkle them on top at the end. Not as flavorful as roasted nuts but supposedly healthier. Anyway, wonderful! Thanks. Love the orange juice in this one.

This recipe is fabulous and so easy for when company is coming over.  I did add cinnamon to the recipe to give it some more flavor and cut back on the orange zest a bit.  Highly recommend.

I did not have time to do the over night thing and it came out fantastic.  I served it 2 ways:  both were made into sandwhiches - one type with nutella in the middle and the other with cream cheese in the middle.  I dipped the bread in the egg mixture, pan fried each piece. Make it into a sandwhich with cream cheese or nutella in the middle.  Return to pan quickly and heat like a grilled cheese to heat middle.  Serve on plate with the pecan - orange rind garnish, a dollop of whip cream and vermont maple syrup.

Amazing flavor- I was worried at first with the amount of OJ that was going into this recipe- I thought it was kindof odd soaking bread with OJ- but this was awesome- we will be making this again!

This is a great recipe for those who don't like really soggy french toast. I halved the recipe since it's just me and added a little cinnamon as others have. I also ended up soaking it for about 3 hours instead of overnight. I let it bake for about 25-30 minutes and it came out great! Had a nice texture and remained that way even when I poured syrup on it. Will definitely make it again...and again...

This was absolutely amazing! My only recommendation was that I had to cook it for about 35-45 minutes total. So yummy though, I'll definitely keep this recipe in mind the next time we have overnight guests.

Excellent!  I made this for mother's day and it was a hit with my parents.  Very easy and tastes great.  I also reduced the amount of zest.

Tasty, but I needed longer baking time. I needed at least 40-45 minutes. I also used PAM like many other reviewers, but some parts of my finished toast still stuck, so make sure if you're using PAM to spray a few good layers. The orange zest was definitely a unique touch and the pecans created a pleasent crunch.

I made this recipe for a family vacation, but made a few changes. I used cinnamon bread (full loaf), replaced the nutmeg with extra cinnamon, and I omitted the pecans and used almonds instead. I also omitted the orange zest. It was the perfect mix of crispy and soft--I loved it!

This was a keeper. Everyone loved it. I followed it exactly but did not let it soak overnight (did not have the time). Just let the bread soak till all liquid was absorbed. I turned the bread several times to soak up all liquid. It was a great way to cook it rather than standing over a griddle.

This was DELICIOUS!  I made some changes based on other reviews.  I was making this for 7 people so I set the serving size to 8.  I had 15 pieces of bread but didn't double the recipe.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and did 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and vanilla instead of 1/4 teaspoon.  I dipped each individual piece in the mixture before putting it in the pan.  I also didn't use melted butter to coat the baking pan.  I just used some Pam.

When cooking it, I did 20 minutes at 350 degrees but it was still a bit soggy so I cranked up the heat to 425 degrees and cooked it for another 5-7 minutes until the bottom was nice and brown.  It came out perfect!  It wasn't soggy at all and everyone LOVED it!

It's pretty good. Some reviewers said it was sweet enough that it didn't need syrup. We did not find this to be true. Nice flavor. Liked the addition of the crunchy nuts on top. It has a nice subtle flavor of orange (would probably have been stronger with the zest- which I didn't use because it was so late at night when I made it, and I was tired). Baked mine 20 min (checked after 10, and 5 and 5).

This recipe is very convenient to make the night before a busy day so you can cook them in the morning.  Cut the butter in half or else it is extremely buttery.
