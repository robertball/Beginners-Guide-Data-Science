Oh My Gosh, this pie was WONDERFUL! I made it, ate almost the whole thing, raved about it and then my mom called me to get the recipe so she could make it for a ladies meeting at church. Everyone told her that she outdid herself and asked for the recipe. It was easy to make too. Thanks for submitting it Candi!

I was looking at a link to the 5 star recipes page and seen this recipe. I thought the ingredients were kind of odd, but I liked that it had no crust. My nephew wanted to bake something when visiting so we chose this and neither of us had tried it before. It had a flavor I have never tasted before of butter pecan mixed with gooey and crispy merengue. I used honey grahams as it didn't specify. Strangely the graham cracker was barely distiguishable, in taste, which was preferrable. I used sprayed lite whipped cream in a can on top to save time and a little fat. I have never had one of these pies, so it was a tad too sweet for me from the cookies, but I can see why the other reviewers like it.

Really, really good pie. I have made it 3x this week. I like it best topped with a vanilla mouse filling. I also put a little  of the batter on a silpat next to the pie on a cookie sheet and then crumble it on top of the mousse filling, along with some shaved chocolate. To die for!

This is very good.  I have never had anything quite like it before.  I left out the pecans because of teeth issues and I baked it in a rectangular pan instead of a pie tin.  Very very good and I'll definitely make it again.  Husband said it reminds him of divinity candy.

Growing up in Texas, Luby's was a big player in my family's After Church Lunch roulette and a frequent mid-week dinner choice too.  Their butternut brownie pie was my favorite thing. Living in VA now, I haven't had it many years. 

This is easy to make and is just as I remembered. Creamy, crunchy, rich and delicious. I only made a few changes. I made a German chocolate cake the day before that required 6 egg yolks, so I used all six whites in the pie and baked in a 9-inch cake pan and baked just a few minutes longer. Also, I remembered when I was a kid and dissected the pie, it was made with Ritz crackers instead of graham crackers so I subbed in a sleeve of Ritz. I know the official Lubys recipe says grahams but in the late 70s/early 80s it was Ritz.

This was a great treat. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
