So easy! Ok so I didn't follow the potato filling recipe, but I did use wonton wrappers and it works great!  I used about 2 teaspoons filling and crimped the edges with egg white.  I boiled them 2-4 minutes then let them cool completely. I froze them and sauted them when needed in butter and they are excellent (similar to store frozen perogies). very good!

Actually, wonton wrappers are usually square. I think you are looking for dumpling (shui jiao) skins.  I don't know why the other reviewer used egg roll wrappers!  Dumplings and wontons are designed to be boiled, unlike egg rolls!

I am so entertained by your videos Chef John. I loved your square dancing joke, and a dough-seal-dough your pierogi! I decided to give your grandmother a rest and made my own dough. Your filling however, is excellent Chef and very easy and fun to make. I look forward to making more of your recipes.

These taste good, but the texture of the wonton wrappers is thinner and a bit off from regular perogies. They also look pretty ugly, but that might just be me.

The 4 stars are because it sounds and looks so good.  Plan to try this, but need some clarification. Written recipe says 2 TBSP filling and the video says 2 TSP.  I guess I'll try it and see. Will post an update soon. FOR MY UPDATE:  I'm sticking with the 4 stars.  I had to use square wonton wrappers as none of my local stores carried round ones.  Used 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 ricotta as I was not able to find farmer's cheese.  I was able to fit a hefty 1 tsp of filling into the wrapper and the square worked just fine.  They came out great.  I've never made a pierogi before, but using the wonton wrappers was a breeze.  Like others, I had WAY more filling than I was able to use with my package of wrappers.  I think the package had 50 wrappers and I had enough filling for at least another 25.  No biggie, I'll just get two packages of wrappers next time.  I froze the ones that I didn't cook right away and am going to try them from frozen tonight.  Can't wait to try a batch with some spinach worked into the filling.

Very delicious. Just a point off cause they don't look like perogies cause of the wonton wrappers being square. My boyfriend has the idea to serve them on a bed of iceburg lettuce with apples and green onions and it was amazing definitely making these again sometime although they take a long time to do even cheating not making the dough.

I am a fan of ("Mrs.T" store bought ) perogies  & I eat them often.
I like the mash potatoe & cheese.
I give this filling 5 stars, but overall, I did not care for the texture of the shells.
Because the work involved in the making of perogie shells is a all day process, I will buy pre-made shells from a local store or Amazon. (they are not cheap)
A time saving tip is use instant mashed potatoes...  there is no difference in the outcome or taste.
Also, WonTon wrappers are a good substitute for perogie shells

Ok, they aren't my Nana's pierogis, but I didn't spend an entire day in the kitchen, so it was a good trade-off.  We all liked these, and I've made cabbage, mushroom and sweet pierogis using the wonton wrappers as well.  Not quite the same consistency or flavor, but a heck of a lot less work.

I was really up against it!  My parish priest wanted me to give him a cooking lessing on how to make pierogi.  I was at my wits end.  I tried multiple dough recipes and always came out with hockey pucks.
I have made won tons since forever and do them very well.  This recipe is a God send.  Today is Saturday and Fr. Jamie is coming Monday.  I was down to the wire and you saved my neck!  Thanks ever so much!!!!  Glad you are so smart!

I made Plum Pierogies - filled with canned plum slices a bit of cinnamon and sugar, boiled, then fried in butter and sprinkled again with cin/sugar... Delicious! I used two wontons but will try next time as they got a bit tough in frypan...  Terrific short cut!!!

This was my first attempt at pierogi making, so I'm not sure what the taste and texture is supposed to be. These came out delicious and pretty (I have celiac disease, so I made my own gluten free dough). I did some with caramelized onion added to the filling too, which I thought stepped the flavor up a notch. 
My only complaint would be the lack of measurement for salt and pepper. being a first time maker, I didn't have a starting reference point to go off for seasoning the filling.

These were just ok, the egg roll wrappers were kind of chewy or tough. The filling was good. Would make my own dough if I make it again.
