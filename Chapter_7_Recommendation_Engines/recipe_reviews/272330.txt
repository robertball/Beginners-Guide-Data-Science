Delicious and filling! My daughter who claims to hate tomatoes even ate this! Great for dunking grilled cheese and you can use the leftovers as a yummy pasta sauce!

Excellent and easy.  Made slight modifications based on what I had on hand.  Instead of raw garlic, I used a few cloves of garlic I already had roasted. I put the onions in raw.  And, I put in a big handful of flat leaf parsley  (no stems) and instead of removing after cooking, I just blended them in.

Will definitely make again.
