Awesome. I make these when we have houseguests and everyone thinks I've done something amazing. And they're so easy. I do everything the night before. I chop the fruit and put it in a bowl in the fridge, make the crepes and put them in the fridge, and I mix the filling and put that in the fridge. In the morning, I serve a great breakfast that everyone thinks is amazing and I even have the time to sit down and enjoy it with them.

I happened to find this recipe this morning and had all of the ingredients. It was great. I had everything ready before my husband even left for work at 7:30 am. I will definitely make this again.

The cinnamon was a wonderful touch and added quite a bit of flavor. It was much better than the simple crepe recipe this website provides. I think they're basic crepes? Anyway, terrific and yummy! A little less butter in my opinion, should have been used to coat the pan, for it made the crepenot want to stick to the pan the first couple times, causing wasted, torn or overcooked crepes. I will definately use this recipe again, with possibly a tad more flour. It came out a little runnier than I remembered. Doubling the recipe would also be a smart moove. The crepes were too good to only have one batch!

PERFECT! These were delicious crepes. Followed everything as instructed and opted not to add the full amount of sugar for the topping since the fresh fruit already holds it own. The cream cheese filling is absolutely divine! We loved this breakfast treat! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! :)

These were great! and so easy to put together. what i did was pour the batter in the middle of the pan and rotated my pan back and forth to thin out the matter. When it looks cooked in the middle, then flip it to cook for a few seconds, and done! The filling was good, but I wish it was was creamier/smoother, because the cream cheese was still chunky. But was great when i made them with strawberries, blueberries, and one with peanut butter. YUM! 
Love this recipe, super easy!

These were pretty good. Still nothing I would rave over. But overall a good recipe. I am not sure if I will make these again or not.

Could it get any easier? I always loved crepes but watching street vendors make the crepes made me feel it was really daunting. When I saw this recipe I thought, "No way, this is too easy." Thankfully, I was wrong! Easy, delicious, great way to sneak fruit into something delicious that could be a breakfast or desert. Gosh, I could make it a whole meal!

This has been our family tradition for Christmas morning for four years now. I make everything in advance so all I have to do is put the fixings out and let people build their own. A single recipe really makes about 11 crepes. See my notes for easy crepe making below. See my 2 photos above for finished strawberry/chocolate and apple/caramel crepes.  To make the crepes in advance, heat a small frying pan to medium, butter the pan well, pour 1/4 cup of crepe mix into the center of the pan and swirl it around until it no longer runs. Cook until no longer shiny. Flip. Cook 30 seconds. Place ON WAX PAPER on a dinner plate. Continue to make the crepes and layer with wax paper. When finished, wrap plate of crepes with saran wrap and put in fridge. In the morning, peel off about 10 crepes in a hunk with paper still between and warm the stack in the microwave on a separate plate for about 45-60 seconds. The crepes will peel right off one at a time without tearing.  FILLING: I make strawberries (you don't need THAT much sugar) and drizzle with Smuckers ice cream fudge topping.  I also make apple (chop to bite size pieces with cinnamon sugar stirred in) and drizzle with Smuckers ice cream caramel topping.

I did cheat and use store bought crepes, but the filling was exactly what I was looking for.  I was looking for an easy, tasty filling and this is very good.

This was a hit!  I made this for my boyfriend and he was very impressed.  I made the filling and batter, and cut the berries the night before to save time in the morning.  It took a while to get the pan at just the right temperature, but I think I'll get better form with practice.  The cinnamon was a nice touch!

I found these crepes stuck to themselves when I tried to flip them. Now, I did substitute about 1.5 tsp of mayo for the eggs, because I'm out, so that might have had something to do with it, but I've never had that issue before when substituting mayo for the emulsifier.  A crepe for the expert crepists among us :) But delicious!

There were very good and a nice change of pace for a weekend breakfast!  For the filling I did not use the whipped cream.  I just spread a  thin layer onto the crepe and rolled up.

So yummy!  I'm pregnant and had a craving for strawberry crepes and this was perfect!  I actually used store-bought crepes, though I'm sure homemade would be better.  I wasn't patient enough.  :)  I also put the strawberries and chopped banana slices right inside the crepe.  Delicious!  :)  Thank you!!!
