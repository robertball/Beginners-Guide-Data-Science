Best macaroni salad recipe I've tried yet!  Simple but great just the way it is or a wonderful base recipe to expand on.  Will be making this again with Old Bay and crab meat soon!  Two suggestions:  First off, more onions and a course chop or they'll get lost in it all.  Secondly, it will dry out in the fridge.  When it does, just add water until it gets the creaminess back!  Thanks for the recipe!

Did this tonight for Labor Day!  Just excellent.  I did add maybe a dozen or so stuffed green olives for a little brine favor...  Next time, I might try a little more rice vinegar.  But darned good stuff.  The leftovers are MINE.

Made this yesterday- It's really good.  I love that I didn't have to chop a ton of stuff.  Did add a significant amount more of Mayo- It was too dry otherwise and I added another 2tsp of rice wine vinegar.  Had to sub a tsp of celery salt for the seed and salt.   LOVED THIS. WILL MAKE IT AGAIN.

After reading the reviews I tried this recipe and absolutely loved it.  My only changes were that I used dried parsley, as I didn't have fresh.  I also used finely chopped celery instead of celery seeds.  Great recipe, it will be my standard from now on.

This is the best macaroni salad I have ever tasted! I doubled the pasta and used about half the amount of onion. I also used only the whites of the hard boiled eggs, and the yolks weren't missed at all. I didn't have elbow macaroni in my pantry, so I used small penne, and it was just fine. I didn't need to increase the amount of mayonnaise even with the increase in pasta...it was still very creamy...could even have used less in order to be a little bit more healthy. This is easy, and oh so delicious. I will make this again soon!  I hard boiled extra eggs while making the three for this recipe - to keep in the fridge for egg salad or a snack. Thanks for this great recipe!

Yummo! I was looking for a basic macaroni salad because mine always end up d-u-l-l. The celery seed and rice vinegar definitely do the trick. I used shells instead of macaroni, but only because the store was out, and adjusted the mustard to suit my family's taste preferences. Other than that I followed it exactly (I don't like to leave reviews for recipes that I altered.) This will be my go-to side dish for summer for sure. Thanks for sharing it!

This is the best classic recipe for macaroni salad!!!! I add some black pepper to taste and top with papricka. I also used 2 green onions chopped, instead of yellow onion and added 2 celery stocks, chopped instead. I added some fresh chopped parsley and I added an 1/8 cup of sour cream too. I loved it!!!

Without a doubt, wonderful salad.  The rice wine vinager and a little bit of sugar make all the differance in the world.  I'm thinking of adding a little cheadder cheese next time.  Made it as recipe and made no changes. Thank you for a great and easy salad.

12-06-15 ~ Loved this macaroni salad.  It is the closest thing to my mom's recipe that I've ever found.  I did add diced celery along with the celery seed as we like celery in our pasta salads.  I mixed my dressing ingredients in a large measuring cup and let meld about an hour before adding to the cooled pasta.  I wanted to make sure the sugar had completely dissolved and I could adjust the the dressing taste before adding it to the other ingredients.  This was wonderful, and it is a keeper in our house.

Didn't have any rice vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar.  Other than that made it exactly to the recipe.  Was excellent!  It made 5 very big servings!!  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe!  I, like many others, used this as a base and added cubed cheddar, olives and garlic as a personal preference.  I also left out the parsley and used flavored rice wine vinegar.

Made this yesterday to go with baked chicken, and it was good!  Not sure why a review or two that I read mentioned that this was "dry" and they had to add more mayo??  Mine had almost too much mayo--and I love me some mayo, trust me.  Anyway, I used chopped green onions rather than regular onions, and it was tasty.  I will make this again for picnics in the summer, I'm sure.  Easy and good.

This is the perfect classic macaroni salad we grew up with. I used cavitapi noodles instead of elbows and reduced the sugar a touch. perfect! You can definitely play around with your veggies to your liking.

This mac salad really is magnificent! Don't hesitate to make it. I was skeptical because I have a mac salad that I love and the ingredients is this are rather different. It is not better than my other one, but it is just as good. I am happy to have 2 favorite recipes now! After making it as written to taste and rate it, I then added some chopped celery and sweet red pepper only because I like them. I can't keep out of it and am restraining myself to wait until the rest of dinner is ready! Thank you for this great recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as written, with the exception of using white vinegar rather than rice simply because I didnâ€™t have any on hand and red onion because of personal preference. It turned out to probably be the best macaroni salad Iâ€™ve ever eaten. It seemed unusual to add parsley, but I grow culinary herbs anyway so I figured what the heck. It added a nice, fresh flavor. There are just two things Iâ€™d mention: First, it took me much longer to prepare than what was indicated in the recipe. Iâ€™ve been cooking for over 40 years, and I consider myself to be an amateur chef. So if preparing this, count on it taking some extra time. The other thing is that the recipe says it serves five. This seemed odd, as did the amount of calories per serving. I wound up with a massive amount of macaroni salad. Thank heavens it tastes so good, because my husband and I are going to have to eat it twice a day for the foreseeable future. And then toss out whatâ€™s left. When I make it again Iâ€™m going to cut the recipe in half or even quarter it unless Iâ€™m making it for a crowd, although Iâ€™ll probably still use two eggs or maybe even three. Otherwise, the ingredient proportions seemed spot on.

This was a great basic macaroni salad. I followed the recipe exactly and made it the night before a party. When I went to serve it I thought it looked a little dry but after mixing it again it was perfect. Not too dry but not over the top creamy either.

Good base salad recipe.  I added chopped celery and chopped radishes for more crunch.  Used reduced fat mayo and added some black pepper.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Allergic to onions, so I added shredded carrots and diced celery. I added 1 TBSP sugar because I like it a little sweeter. Great recipe and very versatile. Thanks!

This was the best macaroni salad I've ever had and it will be used again and again.  I added a couple of T of cream because of the reviews suggesting to add more mayonaise.  I blended the dressing ahead of time before adding it to the noodles, onion, and egg.  I had kids, young and old adults who all gave rave reviews.  Thank you.

Added an extra teaspoon vinegar and about a 1/4 of a green bell pepper.  Left out the parsley and celery seed.  Stayed nice and creamy.

Made as recipe stated and it wasn't bad. By the time it had chilled and the flavors had melded, I found it to be dry and bland. Had to add a lot more mayo.

Next time I will do as one review suggested. I will chop onions course instead of fine (my mistake). He suggested adding a little water to cream it up. I don't know about water though.

Delicious! Simple crowd-pleaser. I chose to use a creamy salad dressing (1/2 cup) and 1 cup mayo - skipped the sugar. Seemed to work well.

Made  for Memorial Day - liked the rice vinegar. Didnâ€™t use sugar. USED WACKY  (colors) macaroni bow ties. Added shredded carrots (sweet). Also celery instead of seed.  Seconds and thirds were requested.

Great basic recipe from which to go.  I added 1/4 c of sour cream, 1/2 c water (I don't like dry salad), diced celery & sweet bell pepper, cubed cheddar cheese, ground black pepper, & some dried dill.  To make it like I remember from childhood.    I have no doubt that the recipe is great just as it is too.  My daughter and friend stopped by and snagged a to go order of this yumminess.   She stopped back today for the recipe.   I also only use Helman's Mayo - it's the best.

So delicious! I made this for our family 4th of July get-together. I used 1 cup of light miracle whip and 1/2 cup of mayo instead of all mayo. It was a big hit! Leftovers were divided to take home. Thanks for a great recipe!

This has the basis of becoming my new mac salad recipe, but for some reason it turned out way too salty.  I won't salt the pasta water as much next time during cooking. To offset the saltiness I added more sugar and some water to thin.  I also added to celery stalks, thinly sliced and some sweet pickles. It will be even better next time.

Our family really enjoyed this macaroni salad. Kids even took extra servings of this at dinner!  I did add fresh diced celery and a little paprika.  Very nice taste!  This is a keeper!

Magnificent is right!!! My husband and son are now addicted (thanks a hell of a lot). I followed the recipe in its entirety (except added dried parsley - too lazy to run to the store for fresh - however I will be trying with the fresh). I won't be changing a thing. Why mess with what's great!!! Thank you so much for submitting!!!!

I was very disappointed with this salad--all I could taste was the mustard. I tried to remedy it but it didn't make a difference.

Went half on the mayo and it still would have been fine with a little less.  Didnâ€™t have celery seed, and used red onion.  Fantastic recipe.  Good warm too (before refrigeration)!

I resequenced the steps as follows: Hard-cook the eggs ahead of time (the day before, or earlier in the day). Refrigerate them until needed. When ready to begin, start slowly heating the pot of water for the elbows. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, stir the salt & sugar into the vinegar until they mostly dissolve. Then whisk in the mayo, mustard & celery seed. Refrigerate until needed. Prep the onion (about 2/3 cup white, sweet, red or scallions) & parsley (Italian flat-leaf). (Optional: add a rib of celery, first sliced lengthwise into 3, then finely diced. Add some chopped celery leaves, too!) Peel & dice the eggs. Stir the onion, parsley, celery & eggs into the dressing. Refrigerate the dressing again until needed. Boil the elbows until slightly (just slightly) overcooked (so they won't absorb all of the dressing, making the salad dry). Rinse them in cold water until cool; drain. Then combine the elbows & dressing. Refrigerate until cold. Stir before serving. Garnish with sprinkles of paprika (or cayenne!).

This macaroni salad is the best ever! I have never made macaroni salad before and have made this twice in two weeks! It's pretty easy to whip up and has a great taste between the sugar, rice vinegar and celery seed. I also added a little fresh celery to give it some extra crunch. In the first batch I made it with half light mayo and half regular mayo. The second batch was creamier because I used only regular. It was great and I highly recommend!!!

Excellent macaroni salad! I omitted the sugar and put in a couple of tablespoons sweet pickle relish. I also put a sprinkle of dill weed. It was even better the next day!

I was asked to bring Macaroni Salad to a gathering,  my family doesn't usually eat mayonnaise based salads.    I did half Mayonnaise and half Miracle Whips plus a 1/4 cup of ranch dressing.  Also add bacon.  It was a hit and I was asked for my recipe.

I've made this delicious pasta salad twice.  I use 1/8 of tsp of sugar because we're not a fan of sweet mac salads. This is the first macaroni salad recipe I've followed where I add more mayo than called for.  Especially the day after, I add another spoonful or two so it moistens but otherwise we love the blend of ingredients and I'll definitely keep making it.
Thanks!

Excellent.  I used penne pasta since that's what I had on hand.  I picked parsley from my mother's garden and it was so tender and flavorful.  I used brown mustard since I didn't have regular.  I wish I had added a little granulated garlic.  Just a little.  I think this is going to go over very well at the Superbowl party.

I have not made macaroni salad before but this is excellent! I added finely chopped red pepper for color, and did not have fresh parsley so used dried,  it would be just as fantastic as is! Love that it does not require lots of chopping. I will make again.
