I see a lot of bad reviews on this recipe when they didn't even follow the recipe....sherry and red wine are NOT the same!  I found this recipe to have a very well-rounded flavor.  The RED WINE (not sherry) did not overwhelm the dish.  I was skeptical of using red wine with poultry, but this recipe changed my mind.  Excellent recipe for those who have an acquired taste for cooking with wine.  On a personal note...if you don't follow the recipe EXACTLY...don't show your ignorance by giving the recipe a bad review.

I can see how this recipe appeals to those who are looking for a simple and easy way to get dinner on the table fast, but the taste would be so much better with a few modifications and a little more effort. First, never use commercial cooking wine - ever! It's the poorest quality you can buy. Instead, opt for a good quality dry wine (either red or white) you would enjoy drinking tableside. The better the ingredients, the better the outcome. Second, I suggest sauteing seasoned chicken cutlets in a tablespoon or two of olive oil or the artichokes marinade until evenly browned. Then toss in some onion and garlic along with fresh sliced mushrooms and cook until soft. Next, deglaze the pan with the wine, and reduce a bit to cook off the alcohol and thicken the sauce. Then add the artichoke hearts (quartered or roughly chopped), simmer until heated through and the flavors marry. Finally season to taste with salt, pepper, and a little fresh minced thyme and/or parsley. Done in under a half hour and much more magical than dried out baked chicken.

This is certainly no "magic" chicken.  It was basically chicken swimming in alcohol.  The taste of the alcohol totally overpowered the chicken, the artichokes and the mushrooms.  It might as well be called "Sherry with chicken".  I will never make this again.  Susan

Good recipe *IF* you follow directions.  Use RED WINE, not sherry...use marinated artichoke hearts in a jar, not plain canned artichoke hearts.  If you use the marinated kind, and the red wine, it will have seasoning and oil (from the artichoke hearts) and won't be overpoweringly "alcohol-flavored" as it would be if you used sherry instead of the red wine called for.  I do suggest using a decent red wine, not "cooking" red wine, which is usually not very good.

Delicious, easy recipe!  I fixed w/brown rice and steamed asaragus. Next time, I might add a little fresh garlic for a little extra kick.

This chicken recipe was delicious. A terrific company dish as well. Make it the day before and just warm it up. Leftovers are great too. Very moist and the taste is superb. Everyone will want the recipe for this easy to make and great tasting chicken dish.

I used red wine ( a Cabernet Sauvignon) AND marinated artichokes and I have to say I did not care for this chicken. It was tasteless, flavorless and completely unappealing to look at. I apologized to my husband and kids several times for even serving it to them. Sorry but if I could give it zero stars I would :(

People! Read and follow directions!! It calls for RED COOKING WINE, not sherry. Those are two totally tasting liquids. Also, use MARINATED, undrained artichoke hearts.

This was such an easy recipe, and I had such high hopes that we would love it.  Unfortunately, it was bitter tasting - maybe I should have used a different kind of marinated artichoke hearts (I used Progresso).  I might try it again without the artichokes, because it was very easy, and the chicken by itself was tender and juicy.

This dish was just o.k.  I seasoned the chicken with some salt and pepper and also some minced garlic. I probably won't make it again though.

Delicious. I have made this several times, sometimes with fresh mushrooms which I saute a little first. Super easy and super delicious.

Nothing magic about this one. None of us were impressed with this, one little bit. I love cooking with sherry, but this called for a bit too much; the chicken ended up drowning and the taste was overpowering. Limp, canned veggies only made this recipe worse.

Will not make this again. Totally lacking in flavor and eye appeal. It needs a lot of doctoring up to make it "company" worthy.

I did follow the recipe, using cooking sherry like it says. Red wine? This recipe shows up two different ways, when I went to edit it, it shows 1 cup red cooking wine but the recipe that I printed and used said 1 cup cooking sherry. No wonder everone is confused!!!!Sorry but I agree with most of the other posts that it was swimming in too much sherry, If I ever make it again, I would use about a 1/4 of sherry and the rest of the liquid would be chicken broth. I like the idea of adding garlic, salt, and pepper. It definatly needed something. Again, it was easy so it would be nice if it could be tweeked to have a better end result. We served it over angel hair pasta.

Very bland.  Almost tasteless.  Way too much sherry.  I would never cook this again.

We thought this recipe was very good.  I used 3/4 cup of a $6 red wine from Trader Joe's and also their artichoke hearts (I prefer those because they are not quite so salty as other marinated artichoke hearts).  The mushrooms were also TJ's (I guess you get the trend here).  I followed the recipe exactly except for seasoning the chicken with some of my favorite seasoning from this site---Papa's Seasoning.  I'm not sure what was wrong for the other reviewers because we'd have this again!  I often have leftovers of the ingredients used in this recipe.  The chicken that was left over will make a really good sandwich tomorrow!  Thanks, MRSCHRISB!
