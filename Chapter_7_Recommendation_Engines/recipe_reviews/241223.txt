I thought the ratio of kimchi to eggs was a bit much so I made this with 4 eggs instead of 2 and for my taste it was perfect. I recommend chopping up the kimchi to a more manageable size.  I also added fresh spinach, 1 T. sour cream whisked into the eggs before I added to the pan. This is a terrific recipe , very simple and tasty as is but it lends it's self to personal variations.  ( Used Mother In Laws Kimchi. )

As soon as I saw this recipe I could not wait until my husband left for work (he hates the smell of kimchi) before I could make this. It is amazing and absolutely the easiest thing to make.

I like eggs and I love kimchi . . . How have I never done this before!? The only substitution I made was to switch out the vegetable oil (high in omega-6 fatty acids and some trans fat) for avocado oil (full of healthy monounsaturated fat). Super fast, easy, delicious, and nutritious! Thanks!

turns out very well if you let the kimchi and egg sit on the flame for a while; the kimchi caramelizes and eggs turn nice and fluffy

I added some spinach into the pan with the kimchi as well.  Really surprised how good this was.

I used a sliver of butter instead of vegetable oil & hot kimchi. If you can ear spicy food in the AM great way to get your fermented veggies in.
