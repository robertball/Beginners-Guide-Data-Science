Sounds delicious! I haven't cooked it yet but think I might chop the vegies instead of slicing. Then use it as a hot dip for toasted baggetts

This was very tasty, quick, and simple. I didn't have the red & green peppers on hand, but an  excess of tomatoes, cubanelle peppers, baby bella and oyster mushrooms. I feel like this recipe is a great way to use up the vegetable drawer. Which is always a keeper in my book.  I served with a little sliced london broil and some jasmine rice.  A keeper

We loved this recipe!  However, it didn't feel like a casserole to me so we used it as spaghetti sauce and poured it over our pasta and it was delicious!  I also used fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned and I added some garlic powder to give it a little kick. I will be using this recipe for our pasta sauce and pizza sauce.

Delicious! I had a bounty of hot banana peppers to use up, so I used those, 1 green pepper and 1/2 each of red and yellow pepper that needed to be used up. I also had an 8 oz. pkg. of sliced fresh mushrooms to use up, so I used those in place of the canned. I sauteed all the veggies in a tiny bit of evoo and a heavy spray of PAM cooking spray, and that worked great. I seasoned the veggies w/ some s&p while they were cooking. I transferred the mixture to my casserole dish and poured the sauce over, then topped w/ some cheese (did not use as much, as we are trying to eat healthier). This was so tasty! I served it alongside steak and roasted red potatoes, but I do agree, this would be awesome over pasta. I was glad to find a new, healthy veggie side...a keeper, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
