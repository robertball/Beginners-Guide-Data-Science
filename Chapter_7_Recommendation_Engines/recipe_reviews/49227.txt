I would say this recipe is a keeper, however, I had to modify for what I had on hand, then still, I tweaked it a bit.  First, I only used one 6.5 oz can of minced clams, but I chopped up about 3/4 cup mushrooms and added that for more "meatiness".  I didn't have any white wine on hand (shame!), so I used the clam juice and chicken broth  with a twist of fresh lemon juice and a splash of half-and-half to give the sauce some body.  I also wanted a thicker sauce, so I thickened it with 2 tsp corn starch and 2 tsp cold half-and-half.  The lemon gave it a great balance of acidity (replacing the wine).  I also boiled my pasta in a broth/water combo for more flavor.  Overall a very quick dish paired with a spinach salad! Perfect!

This one is excellent.  Get out your clams and put away your heavy cream.

Delicious recipe and very easy.  I couldn't find 8 oz chopped clams, only the 6 oz can.  Used two of these, would probably double recipe next time.

Very good! I over did it w/the salt by salting the spaghetti water but I fixed it by rinsing it and adding a splash of milk, next time I will be more carefull, but good dish!

This was a very quick and easy recipe to prepare and the taste was excellent. I've made other recipes of this dish but the clam broth made it lighter than a white sauce and healthier.

Used fresh free-range littleneck clams from the flats near our house. Grilled them and retained the juice for the sauce.

I found this recipe very simple and quick.  I used white wine rather than water, to make up the 2 cups of liquid with the clam juice.  Added a touch of cream towards the end as well, and a few red pepper flakes.   Served over linguine.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Tasty and a good way to use up about 1/2 a can of clams. Just cut recipe down for a single serving today, but still heavy on the garlic. No one likes me but me now :)
