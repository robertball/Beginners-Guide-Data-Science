I'd just like to add that sauteeing the caps mushrooms in some olive oil before baking makes them softer. Also, I added some more shredded cheese to the top before baking. Also cutting the bottoms of the mushroom caps to make them flush will keep the shrooms from toppling over. I usually dont have too much filling left over but that will depend on how big your mushrooms are. I try to get the container with the biggest mushrooms and stuff em way up high. I am the recipe author, for those who think these are bland, add only half off the cream cheese and saute FRESH garlic with your onions. For all those who have extra stuffing left, again, add half the cream cheese and PEEL your mushroom caps. This opens them up so you can add more stuffing. This is a "starter" recipe that you can modify. I have gotten lazy and now throw all the stuffing ingredients into my food processor! EDIT: I have also covered the top of the filling with panko bread crumbs for crunch (it's now my favorite way to make them.) Cheers and happy cooking.

If you are looking for the next appetizer to serve at your dinner party.  You just found it.  I took these to a dinner party and they were a huge hit.  I followed as stated, only my onion was a bit small and I put 1/8 teaspoon pepper in as I did not add as I cooked the onion.  The baking time is straight up.  If you use the stuffing mushrooms, which I was very happy to find, but wish I had bought two packages, because I thought it said stuff 12.. haha.. my mistake.  I might add that the comment by one person at the party was "these are better than any I have eaten at a restaurant".. GREAT job CC.. you made me a hit!  UPDATE:  For the poster below.. If you have leftovers, I just tasted.. Yummy on crackers, spread it on a bagel, stuff it in some chicken and bake.  Lots to do with just the filling.

I made these exactly as written, except I used mozzerella and shredded parmesan because I didn't have any Italian blend shredded cheese. So, I'm eating one in the kitchen while I take the photo... Me: MAN! These mushrooms are gooood! ~ Him (from the other room): I haven't tried one yet." ~ Me: "You will be happy when you do." ~ Him: "MMM! These are the best stuffed mushrooms I've ever had." ~ Me: "Really? She'll be happy to hear that - they're Chicago's. ~ Him: "Delicious!" ~ Me: "I almost don't want to tell her cuz she'll be all full of herself."  Nicely done. :D

EXCELLENT stuffed mushrooms! I followed recipe as written, but I baked them in a 9x13 glass dish with a bit of melted butter on the bottom and covered them. The mushrooms were tender and so delicious. I used jumbo mushrooms and overstuffed a bit, which didn't matter because I sopped up the drippings with crusty bread (; these are truly addicting and plan to have a "dinner" with these alone. This is replacing my stuffed mushroom recipe I have made for years, absolutely wonderful. I broiled these for a few minutes at the end. Thanks CC84Anita for sharing this :)

Nice balance of flavors but a little too creamy for my tastes.  Maybe add a little less cream cheese and bake them longer. Also, I used minced fresh garlic rather than the garlic salt.

I used the non-marinated artichokes, mozzarella and parm cheeses.  These were awesome - I was lucky to get one.  I need to make some when no one is around so I can have some guilty food pleasure all to myself. Thanks Anita for sharing this.

Perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I too used reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream.  Artichoke dip and stuffed mushrooms are 2 of my favorite appetizers, so this was awesome!  Now if I can figure out a way to add bacon for a true trifecta of favorites.....

Because there were only the two of us, I made half a batch of these little marvelous wonders!  That was a mistake!  They are SOOO yummy!  I made them as written, using Anita's suggestion to slice off a touch of the bottom of the mushrooms to keep them from toppling.  These were much better than the main dish I prepared!  Thanks, Anita.

This is a great recipe!  My only complaint is that I had a lot of filling left over.  However, that turned out to be not such a big deal.  Just put the leftover filling in a small casserole dish, bake until bubbly and serve with crackers!  For the filling, I added some fresh minced garlic to the onion and stems, instead of using garlic salt.  And I used non-marinated artichoke hearts because my store was out of marinated.  We loved these, they were absolutely delicious!

We LOVED, LOVED them!!!! I used my favorite baby bellas & definitely sauteed them first. I was never a mushroom liker until I discovered first ambibambi's "Shrimpcargot" (also on this recipe site), & then these mushrooms!! Now I occasionally crave them. So a big thank you to you, Chicago Anita! BRAVO! ~ I did have a lot of filling leftover after using 2-inch baby bellas (aka cremini), so will plan to double the # of baby bellas, as the next size up of baby bellas are the palm-sized portobella mushrooms - too large! Oh, since I used unmarinated fresh-frozen artichoke hearts, I made a simple marinade for the hearts, mixing a little olive oil, cider vinegar or lemon juice,  dried Italian herbs, S&P. So delicious that I could have eaten the art. hearts alone that way!!

These were fantastic. I sauteed the onion and stems in a steak butter I had prepared a few days before, for another use, and before I stuffed the mushrooms, I rolled them in that same butter.  I don't use pre-shredded cheese, so I used mozzarella, Asiago, Romano and Parmesan.  I also rinsed the artichokes cus, though I love them fresh, they're a lil salty and strong for me, otherwise, but that's personal taste. :)  Other than that, I didn't change anything and they WILL be added to our appetizer nights/weekends/whenevers! :) Thanks, Anita.

Wonderful. Ran out of mushrooms so I filled frozen phyllo shells also & baked them.  Had shrimp so I added that to mixture.  Liked the idea of bacon as suggested by another reviewer. Thanks, Anita!

Excellent!  The only changes I made were to use non-marinated artichoke hearts (because I'm not fond of the marinated type) and added fresh garlic and about a 1/2 cup of Panko bread crumbs to the mixture.  Also, they needed a lot more time in the oven.  I topped them off with some shredded mozzarella.  Everybody loved them.  Next time I might try the marinated type...might add a little more zing.

The taste of these stuffed mushrooms was great.  My only problem was after baking there was too much liquid in the pan.  I think the mushrooms extract a lot of liquid when cooking in the oven.  My solution is to try and add some seasoned breadcrumbs.  Wondering if anyone else had that problem.

These were amazing.. I could have easily eaten them all by myself for dinner ;) ;) I had filling left over and we heated it up the following day as a dip, and it was fabulous! We truly love this recipe. Thanks Anita!

These were so good! I love the artichoke and onion combination with the cheeses. I had left over filling, so that is in the freezer. I would even use it as a dip, if I don't use it to fill more mushrooms.

I made these twice already and plan on making more of them tomorrow. The times I have made them they didn't last more than a few minutes. The filling recipe is enough to make more than 24 if you use regular musrooms. This is my favorite mushroom recipe ever. I add bacon to the mixture and also sprinkle bacon on top. I would also recommend using more artichokes in the recipe and some shallots. Yum.

Wow!  Very easy, fast, and impressive. Thanks Anita!  Tried these last night using DH as my tester and we loved them.  They are quite rich (as artichoke dip tends to be for me) so we would make this along with a crudette tray.  You know;  eat a mushroom, feel better by having a carrot, go back to eat more mushrooms! I even dipped a carrot in the stuffing and then popped all the rest in my mouth.  Mmmmmmmcrunchmmmcrunch...

Perfect recipe. All the ingredients are so basic, but you end up with something fancy and special. They were gone about .2 seconds after I put them out on the table.

Pile 'em high!  Top with a little mozzarella and voila!  A hit last night!!  We fed a family of 5 (with this being the main - vegetarian - course) and still have 8 leftover 'shrooms.  I bought big baby portabella mushrooms and stuffed 'em high.  I would definitely recommend slicing a tiny bit off of the top the mushroom to keep them from rolling around.   Yummy!

Made these as written... I thought the artichoke taste was a bit too strong (or maybe I didn't like the brand I got).  Nonetheless, still tasted really good!  I will make these again and maybe decrease the artichoke and put in some spinach. Thanks for sharing!

These were delicious.  The only changes I made were I sautéed 3 cloves of garlic after the onion step, added a hint of cayenne pepper to the mixture and used fresh mozzarella in place of the Italian blend cheese. Thank you Anita!

Cut cream cheese amount in half and still very mushy.  Ended up broiling at the end of cooking to crisp up a tad.  I will not only drain but also squeeze the artichokes in paper towels.  Draining left too much juice in them.  I browned mushrooms on the bottom as one user suggested and that flattened them out sufficiently-no need to trim.

Everyone enjoyed the artichoke heart as a nice change from the usual stuffed mushroom recipes.  I didn't change anything and I'll make these again!

Great easy recipe.  Also, I use this basic recipe and sometimes add some other ingredients- like chopped olives or crab meat or pepper jack cheese to add flavor.

i made these for our churches annual ladies tea party. they where a huge hit! i made a lot more, and only thing i did different was i used butter not olive oil (i just didnt have any olive oil and didnt feel like going to the store) and i added one package of frozen chopped spinach, (cooked) because i've never ever heard of something with artichoke without spinach, i'm glad i did... everyone loved them, i made a lot & there was none left... great recipe i'll make again

Mushrooms are a delicous and nutritious medium to get the artichoke dip from the dish to your mouth.  I substituted the garlic salt for actual salt, and then added about 1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper and 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic.  My in-laws were thoroughly impressed.  Thanks for the great recipe, Anita!

Unbelievable!  My go to for many vegetarian recipes because you can play with adding other veggies.  I always cut the cream cheese in half and use low fat sour cream and cream cheese.  I always use non-marinated artichokes and adjust the seasonings to taste.  I have served as a main course and used portabello (using lower oven temps and longer cooking times, or parbaking the mushrooms prior to stuffing).  With regard to any leftover filling, I have used (or frozen for later) and used as:  quesadilla, burrito, or enchilada innards, baked in phyllo or tart shells, in quiches, baked and served on crackers or chips, in eggs Benedict or breakfast burritos, in pasta sauces or baked pasta dishes -- even veggie lasagna, bruschetta, cheesy garlic bread.  Really, you are only constrained by the limits of your own imagination.  And it is all absolutely delicious; I have never heard a negative comment and routinely get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  Thank you Anita!!!  You must be brilliant!

These were WONDERFUL.  I made these as an appetizer before my family went to meet friends for a Christmas dinner, and we really enjoyed them.  Like others, I added minced garlic instead of garlic salt, cut the cream cheese in half and didn't miss it, and added a touch of extra asiago cheese because it sounded good.  Num, num, nummy.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a good recipe, but it made about twice as much filling as I needed. I was able to make another 12 mushrooms and put the rest in a baking dish to make a dip.  It actually turned out better as a dip with some tortilla chips. The mushrooms came out a little soggy, so I would recommend not greasing the pan first and adding about 10 minutes to the cooking time.  Although they were good, I felt like they needed something.  All the flavors were very rich, adding a spice would help break that up.   If I make this again, I would add some smoked paprika.

oh Man Oh Man, were these good! I only made half the recipe and still had plenty of stuffing left, so I put it in a pie pan and added the leftover cheese, (I made my own mixture of white sharp, Mexican Queso fresco & Parmesan)  and baked it with the shrooms. They were perfect! Anita, another winner:) Now I finally know what all the hoopla is about.  Thank You so much.

These were great. Im a big fan of artichokes, but my kids hate them, so I made a few without them and they thought they were yummy (my son wants me to make another batch tomorrow). Thanks so much!

Delicious...very creamy and flavorful. Love the marinated artichokes...adds so much more flavor. I did use reduced fat cream cheese, sour cream and cheeses. Easy to make and easy to devour!! Thanks Anita...will make this again!

These were absolutely delicious ! I only had 12 mushrooms so I adjusted the recipe for 6 servings.  I used a small shallot in place of the onion.  I didn't have any marinated artichokes so I used the artichoke hearts from a can and seasoned them with a little italian seasoning and a drizzle of olive oil. I didn't have any italian cheese blend so I did as SunnyByrd and used mozzarella cheese and parmesan . Also,  I did as Chicago Anita suggested by sauteeing the mushroom caps in a little bit of olive oil before I stuffed them.  These mushrooms were soooooo good !  Very easy to make ~ Thanks Chicago Cookie !!

I made these today with some tweaks.  I used 1/2 the cream cheese, added pieces of pepperoni, a handful of seasoned breadcrumb, and sub-ed mozzarella for Italian blend.  I baked the stuffed mushrooms for 35 minutes instead of just 20; this ensured tap hat the mushrooms were cooked and the filling was plenty hot.  Overall I give the Recioe 4 stars for a good start on flavor; the texture is a bit off (without the tweaks) as its just mushy.  I will make them again and will sprinkle the tops with bread crumb.  Thanks Chicago--Anita for sharing this flavorful recipe.

These were fantastic!  The recipe made way more stuffing than needed, which was good because I was eating it out of the bowl before I ever started filling the mushrooms.  I used ordinary canned artichoke hearts instead of marinated, and it still tasted great.  Excellent recipe!

The filling is great. I think next time I will just make it into a dip and not put it on mushrooms. I love mushrooms but I really didn't think the mushrooms complemented the filling. Or, maybe I'll just use smaller mushrooms?

I made these for my sons Graduation Party and they were fabulous. I made one batch exactly as written and a second batch with Feta cheese instead of the Italian cheese blend and they were equally great. Will definitely make again and again.

These were DELICIOUS! Made exactly as written, except I only had shredded mozzarella, so I had to go with that. I almost didn't have enough filling for the mushrooms because I kept eating it out of the bowl, lol. These will definatley be made OFTEN! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were so good. I sliced a bit off the mushroom caps so they would sit flat and added them to the stuffing. The mushrooms were overflowing and I had so much stuffing left over I made stuffed chicken with it a few nights later. Great recipe

Wonderful mushrooms. Take any leftover filling, put it in a small ramekin, top with bread crumbs and bake along with the mushrooms. It makes awesome artichoke dip similar to restaurant quality. Next time I may make extra with a little spinach and hot sauce!

The flavors are all excellent. Be sure not to undercook the onions (like I did), or you'll end up with a weird crunch. Cook it right and these are perfect.

I love stuffed mushrooms but didn't really care for these. I cut the cream cheese amount in 1/2 and was glad I did because it was plenty. Had to add more/other seasoning than called for to give the stuffing mixture enough flavor. Also, I love onion, but it seemed to over-power the artichoke flavor and that was a disappointment.

I made these for my daughter's graduation party and everyone LOVED them.  i had 3 people (and there were only about 12 there) ask for the recipe.  I mistakenly used one small jar of artichokes instead of the 12 oz. and even though it was good, more artichokes would have been better - I'll pay more attention to the size of ingredients next time!!  
I did mix the parm with some breadcrumbs to sprinkle on top and they browned up nicely and gave the mushrooms a nice little crunch.
I also used fresh garlic vs. garlic salt - tasted and adjusted with a little salt and pepper

Truly yum!  I added maybe 1/4 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs to the filling and topped the shrooms with Parmesan cheese before baking.  And I used garlic powder.  Really good!  We had a few left, as only 3 of us 5 like mushrooms, so I am going to chop them up, add to the leftover filling, thin with a little cream or milk and toss with pasta.  Doesn't that sound good?  I'm sure it will be.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Loved it!  I actually put it on top of the large portabella caps and I chopped up some small mushrooms and added them to the onions I also used fresh garlic and added some Italian seasoned bread crumbs on top.  The left over is awesome for a cracker dip!

These were absolutely delicious and so simple to make!!!!
I altered the ingrediants.
I used 2oz of cream cheese instead and added monteray jack cheese.
I also put roasted red peppers on top and tossed them in the oven! the peppers gave it a pop!

Wow!  These were fantastic!!!!!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and sauteed the mushroom caps briefly in a bit of olive oil first, to soften.  I also had to use Mozzarella cheese instead of a blend, as that's what I had on-hand.  These were the BEST!!!!  I'll make them again and again!

I made these for a dinner party, they were gone in a flash.  Filling did make more than needed for 24 mushrooms, so i refrigerated & used later as a dip for crackers.  These were fantastic already gave the recipe to 2 other people.  Can't wait to make them again.

These mushrooms are wonderful.  I did have quite a bit of filling left over, however.  I also felt that I had to bake them longer than the time suggested in the recipe.  My husband gobbled them down!  Thanks for the recipe.

Huge, huge, huge success! I needed to find a veggie-friendly appetizer dish for my Vegetarian friend that was quick and easy and this recipe fell in my lap. I followed pretty much everything to a T except I added paprika and a few tsp of hot sauce to the mixture. These mushrooms were gone in less than 10 minutes!

I made these for Thanksgiving & they were gone before I knew it. They are delicious, I added about a cup of breadcrumbs to my mixture just to give it a little bit of a crunchy texture after they are baked.

LOVED these!  They were sooooo good!  I think I am even going to serve them at my parent's 50th b-day's.  I didn't have the Italian blend cheese so I upped on the parm. and added some ricotta in it's place.  These are very versatile with lots of cheeses.  Anyway, great recipe Anita...thanks!

These were by far the best stuffed mushrooms I've ever eaten! I didn't have any Italian cheese blend, so I used a combination of shredded parmesan and mozzarella. The only problem I had with this recipe is that it made too much filling. This was just fine, though, because the filling alone makes an awesome cracker dip! Thanks so much for sharing; I will be making these again and again!!!

OH MY!!!!!!  These were a hit!!!  Even my friend who had to tell me that he hates marinated artichoke hearts couldn't get enough!  second time I made them I bought 4 8 oz of button mushrooms, increased the cream cheese, sour cream, garlic salt and cheeses by 1/3,  same jar of artichokes. Little left over mixture, but plan on making spinach omelet with it! YUM

This are good but i would suggest using artichoke hearts that are not marinated. You can find them at Trader Joe's in the freezer section. Canned ones are not as good! The marinated ones take over the flavor.

Really enjoyed these.  Doubled the recipe and used baby Bellas instead of the mushrooms stated.  The guests enjoyed them at a Tapas party.  Just a little more "zip" would have been good too.

I made this for some friends and got GREAT reviews. I used about half of the amount of cheese that the recipe calls for just to make it a little bit "healthier." One guy said that he doesn't like mushrooms but he kept going back for more. Side note: I had quite a bit of the stuffing left over after stuffing all of the caps. I just threw the stuffing in a small baking dish and served it with crackers the next day as a snack. Worked great!

This recipe deserves 5 stars. It was such a hit with family. It is so tasty and delicate that I serve this for special dinner parties. Guests think its brilliant! Like I went to culinary school! 
I followed the directions, but used pecorini cheese instead of parmesean because that's what I had in the fridge.

Excellent. I did not have marinated artichokes, only had frozen on hand so I chopped the defrosted artichoke hearts and sauted in the onion/garlic until soft and fragrant. Made an amazing filling for the mushrooms and also was great in some stuffed sweet peppers we made to accompany on the appetizer tray. The way these mushrooms cook with the filling is mouth watering. Yum! Sprinkled some paprika on top for crusting.

I made this appetizer for a party at my Mother's...they were all gone in under 5 minutes.  My 6 year old nieces even fought over the last one!  A little time consuming to make, but followed the recipe to a T and it turned out great!

Great Recipe... Makes plenty of filling so the mushrooms aren't on the skimpy side.  I also made this using portabello mushrooms, very tasty!

All those fab reviews were true!   These are amazing!  I could not stop eating it right out of the bowl!!   Simple to make with uncomplicated ingredients, looks so elegant, and tastes good enough to scrape the empty plate....what more could you ask for?  If you love mushrooms, you're gonna' love these!

Awesome, everyone loved them as recipe is written. I found mini bella 'shrooms, and they worked wonderful since they have flat tops, and they tasted good.

These were so great! I didn't have any sour cream on hand, but they were great anyway. I had more than enough stuffing so I make about 35 mushrooms with this recipe

I enjoyed this recipe, but it didn't have that wow factor for me.  I did end up with a lot of left over stuffing, so buy extra mushrooms.  I didn't make any adjustments to the recipe.

Easy to follow instructions with ingredients that you will likely have at home already.  Very tasty and I didn't have the best artichokes or the right cheese for the recipe.  Thanks!

Great recipe.  I didn't have sour cream though and just used motz cheese, didn't have an Italian blend.  Loved them and will be making these for an upcoming family gathering.  My husband couldn't eat them fast enough.  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

Just made these for the first time, only change was non-marinated artichokes (on hand), and they were pretty good. Put filling in both small phylo cups and mushrooms; mushrooms were much better than the cups as the filling is actually kind of bland. 1/2 batch made enough for 8 med/big mushrooms and 12 cups. I will be making these again, but I'll add some herbs, more S&P,  and use the right chokes.  Could even see some lemon, maybe a bit of crumbled sausage, or as another reviewer suggested, spinach would be good addition.This is a good base that provides a nice springboard for going in several different directions.

I made these as directed and used the biggest button mushrooms I could find.  They were easy to prepare and made more than 24 mushrooms.  I still had mix leftover that I used as a cracker dip which was really yummy too.  These were a hit with my mom and uncle.

Delish! I didn't have an Italian Cheese Blend, but still wanted to make them, so I used a bit of mild cheddar & cottage cheese. Yum!! The cottage cheese is plenty of salt, so I just used a good quality granulated garlic. More parm, just cause I like it. Thanks for the recpe Anita!

I just made these as a Thanksgiving appetizer and they were a huge hit (especially for the vegetarians)!  I did add a little extra garlic and put extra cheese on top the last few minutes of baking.  For those who aren't big on mushrooms, the filling is also fantastic spread on bread or crackers.  I'll definitely make this again.

I really wanted to like these- I like the ingredient list- but they were just overkill.  Too rich, too creamy, too much.  None of the ten of us who tried them were particularly impressed.

Very good but I tried to cut out some of the fat with fat-free cream cheese and substituted sour cream with fat free greek yogurt. Next time I will follow recipe. The marinated artichoke hearts puts a great pulse into this dish

The stuffing was enough to fill another batch of mushrooms, and I found it worked better with the second batch where the stuffing had set in the fridge for a day or two.  The first batch came out kind of watery and the second batch were nice and firm and taster better.

Because of the artichokesI thought this might be an Americanized version of the Italian stuffed mushrooms I grew up with. Not so much.  To me, it's very American and typical mushy with all that cheese.  It wasn't terrible, and I could see some people enjoying it, but for me it's a no go.

I made these to bring to a party. They were good but no one oohed and ahed, and there were a few left at the end of the night. I was afraid they would be horrible cold but they still tasted pretty good even after sitting out.  I definitely had more filling than I needed but it is good with crackers.

I marinated the artichokes in balsamic vinegar overnight. I sautéed the mushrooms in butter first, and added sautéed onions and garlic to the artichoke cheese mixture. They were a hit, everyone loved them

They're a bit tedious to make, but so are any stuffed mushrooms. They're a big hit with everyone. My family and friends are always trying to get me to make them. Do remember to briefly prebake the mushroom caps before filling though, otherwise they will get too soggy.

I absolutely love this recipe. We made them on the grill since having a cookout. 
I added frozen spinach,  I was looking up recipes and got them mixed up but this ended up being an awesome mix up.  Just drain the spinach really well and it was just like spinach artichoke dip!

Always a hit when I make these.  I always get asked for the recipe.    Extra filling freezes well to be used as needed  Or they can be prepared then frozen, not as good when reheated, but still yummy

I love artichokes so this recipe caught my eye. They disappeared from the plate. I baked them in a small size muffin tin. They sit on the edge and the liquid goes in the tin keeping mushroom dry.

I will make this again for sure!  I have prepared this appetizer a few times now with "oohs and aahs" but other night I added about a quarter cup of cooked crisp pancetta (minced), I added granulated garlic but no salt.  I sautéed the mushroom caps, one side only, filled them and placed them in a tart pan, the small indentations were perfect for holding the mushrooms upright while baking. 
I also did not use "marinated" artichokes and I used hearts because I don't like those little fibers.

I would have to say (all modesty aside) it was one of the best appetizers I have ever enjoyed!  

Try it, you'll like it!

These turned out well for me. I followed the author's suggestions and only used half the cream cheese and added fresh garlic, parsley, and topped with Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses. I threw everything into my food processor because of laziness and I accidentally made a bit of a purée rather than a chunkier filling but that was my rookie mistake. The flavor was great even if the texture left something to be desired (again, my fault). I would definitely give this another go!

Wow, these are very good!  The only thing I changed due to personal preference was the addition of a little hot sauce and after baking the recommended time I turned on the broiler just to brown the tops a little. Yum-o!!

This made a great quantity. I stored the leftover filling in the fridge, then used some of it again for another get together. I still had a lot  of filling left, so I made another pan.  Each time I make a batch of 24 it there is none left over.

This was just ok. I think the marinade on the artichokes gave it a bitter taste. I've noticed the same flavor using marinaded artichokes in other recipes. Guess I just don't like that flavor. Maybe I should've rinsed after draining. Probably won't make again.

I had some mushrooms that needed to be used. So I threw these together  on the spur of the moment. Hubby loved them.
Made the mushrooms as is without the Parmesan. I liked that these didn't use breadcrumbs or bacon.

The only change I made was to use 8-9 big stuffer caps instead of 24 small mushrooms. These were so, SO good! We each ate two as a main course, and we would have fought over the rest if we hadn't been so full!

The taste of these were pretty good but I didn't like the texture of the filling. It was too mushy/slimy. I think I would prefer no cream cheese and maybe some breadcrumbs for texture. Anyway, my three star review is really a matter of taste. Nothing wrong with the recipe, just not to my liking.

very delicious and easy to make.  i cut back on the cream cheese and sour cream, increased the artichoke.  I read a review stating that mushrooms excrete too much water.  i placed the mushrooms in my skillet added a few droplets of water and put the lid on them. this made the mushrooms tender and no water on my baking sheet.  also i topped with a little sprinkle of italian breadcrumbs.

Outstanding recipe! Loved the stuffed mushrooms, but the leftover filling as a warm dip was so creamy and delicious - will definitely use for our next party. The only thing I did different was to add the cream cheese to the onion and mushrooms the last minute of cooking to totally soften it up.  For the dip, I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of Italian herb seasoning.  Really a terrific recipe, thanks so much for sharing!

This was good, but a bit bland.  I believe if I would have added spicy sausage it would have given it the kick it needed.

These are sooo good and sooo easy! We had a TON of filling left, though, so I'd say make sure your mushrooms are pretty large. Or, the filling makes an excellent dip, too!

These were a hit with our guests.  I used cremini mushrooms, as they have a nice shape and are flat on the tops so they don't teeter when you stuff and place them in your baking dish.  To address some of the reviews about too much liquid coming out, take a spoon and scoop out the "gills", the darker part that fans around the base of the stem.  This will solve that problem, unless you have used something in the filling to make them ooze all over.  I have to admit I skipped the first part of sauteing the mushroom stems and onions in olive oil.  No need to do this, unless you have the time.  Since I'm the only one in the kitchen and preparing the entire meal for guests, I opted out on having to chop onion, and an extra pan to clean.  Instead I just added some crushed garlic to the mix, along with Alfredo sauce from a jar (which was in the fridge from a prior recipe and I needed to use it)in lieu of the sour cream.  This is a beautiful appetizer to present for your guests while awaiting the main course.

The stuffing is absolutely delicious.  I used goat cheese instead of cream cheese and added a little of some pureed kalamata olive and walnuts.  I defintely will use this again.

Great, easy recipe. I made this exactly as the recipe was given, and it came out great. The next time I make it- I believe I will add a bit more garlic or add some garlic to the onions as I saute. I thought this recipe could use a bit more garlic flavor. All in in all-very good!

I will be making a test run of these in the next two days for Thanksgiving. I plan on trying a variety of cheese, and I'm hoping to cut the cream cheese completely. So, parmesan only, parmesan and feta, feta only, blue cheese only... Mine might just turn into a different recipe!

I found these to be very bland, I added a TON of salt and green chilies and that helped.  I had made these for a dinner party and heard several of the guests complaining about the onions and bad breath, all in all I would not make these again.

I thought these mushrooms were absolutely delicious. The only criticism I have is the amount of cream cheese in the recipe - I found it to be a bit overpowering. Next time I make these I will probably either reduce the amount of cream cheese or add something to make the flavour more interesting - perhaps finely diced tomatoes.  As well, the filling for this recipe can stuff much more than 24 mushrooms - I would suggest either being prepared to make a lot more than 24 mushroom caps or cut the filling in half.

I added two cloves of fresh minced garlic in place of the garlic salt.  Other than that, kept the recipe exactly as written.  Great as part of a main dish or as an appetizer.  YUM!

Made this along with several other appetizers for my company.  My boss called them "the best stuffed mushrooms" she ever had.  I agreed wholeheartedly.  Rock on, ChicagoCookie84, I'll be checking out your other stuff for sure.

These were a big hit at our Christmas Eve Party. I did not have artichokes and substituted zucchini. I will definitely try again with artichokes, but still really good!

These were awesome! I made them for a dinner party & they were gone in no time! My son was bummed that there were none left over-he wanted to have them the next day! The recipe made too much filling, but that's ok with me. It's great cold or heated as a dip! Thanks Anita for a great recipe!

I follow the recipe and it was fantastic.  I also sauteed the mushrooms a little bit before stuffing and cut the bottoms off so they would sit flat.  I had a lot of stuffing, so the mushrooms were heaping with them.  Next time I am going to sprinkle some of the cheese on top towards the end and broil them for a little bit to brown them a tad.  Overall great dish!

Add a roll of fried spicy sausage- you won't be disappointed!!
