Fantastic! This was perfect for a quick meal. I used sirloin that I marinated in a mixture of olive oil, minced garlic, red wine vinegar, and Montreal Steak Seasoning. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go for about 6 hours. Once it was grilled to a nice medium-rare we sliced it and then assembled the salad. I used "Garlic Croutons" from this site as well as "Caesar Vinaigrette" dressing. I topped it off with some shredded Romano cheese and served it with a nice white wine. Great recipe - a definite keeper!

A glistening epicurean intercourse of protein, carbs and vegetation. Both times I've made this, I've omitted the croutons and used fat-free dressing to cut down on the fat - 42 grams per serving?  By Bacchus' gut, I couldn't consume that much fat in one meal.  Also, I've experimented with that crazy purple lettuce and have found the results to be most visually pleasing and needless to say, my paramour tore into my exquisitely presented meat and begged for more.  Nice with shiraz.

This is a wonderful week night meal, it is very simple and quick to throw together.  This is a salad even the guys will like to eat as a meal!  I used a light Caesar dressing (Ken's Steak House...my favorite), and fat free Caesar style croutons.

This recipe took literally 10 minutes to make! I was shocked. I made it as directed except for the olives. It fed us for 3 days! 

FYI: to make it last that long it's a good idea to save the salt for serving as it tends to wilt the lettuce over time. Also, serve the dressing on the side so you can control how much you get. ken's steakhouse brand creamy cesar is the best.

This recipe was really fantastic.  My husband and I both loved it.  I eliminated the tomatoes and replaced them with onions because that's what we like.  Also used sirloin instead of flank steak because I'm notoriously bad at cooking flank steak.  This is a great recipe for men who complain that "a salad won't fill me up!"  This one will!

Yum! What a good dinner. I made this with steak I had on hand (bought it on sale cheap). I omitted the olives & tomatoes (don't like them). The directions to cook the steak was right on the mark & the steak was great. We added the croutons & dressing (used Ken's steakhouse caesar dressing) on our individual plates. I bet it would be good with shredded Parmesean. This meal would be a great way to take steak far if you say had kids & wanted to have steak but needed 1 lb to feed the whole family. My husband & I enjoyed this meal. Thanks.

YUM!  The only thing I omitted was the olives because I don't like them.  We had this for dinner and it was filling.  If I was making this for lunch I would use regular pasta instead of the tortellini.  This is a great dish to have in the summer!  Thanks I will make it again & again!

Love it!  But is you plan to eat left overs don't add the lettuce until you are ready to eat.

Super easy and tasted wonderful. The steak needed a little longer in the oven to be more done on the inside, as the time allotted left it very rare in the middle. 

The next day for leftovers it was delicious

This is one of those recipes where the variance in results is hilarious. We liked this very well. We didn't use anywhere near that much Caesar dressing; if we had, I'm positive I'd be giving this a negative rating. I served this salad buffet style: lettuce, tortellini, dressing, tomatoes, steak slices, croutons (no olives for us) and everyone was pleased. Thanks for the recipe!

SO GOOD!!!!!  Simple, quick and so tasty!  I was hesitant about the tortellini in the salad, but it was wonderful and picked up the flavors of everything else nicely.  This is a definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

Good, and simple. Used bagged Romaine lettuce for ease, and added other things I like in a salad...such as cucumber and green pepper.The tortellini made this a complete, filling meal!

This is an instant favorite! We had this for supper two nights in a row.  A great use for any leftover grilled meat.  I can't wait to try it with chicken.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Awesome!!! My family and I loved it. I used a little more tortellini than the recipe called for, because we love tortellini. Perfect recipe for left over steak. I will definitely be making it again.

Yummy! I substituted shrimp for the steak, used Ken’s light Caesar dressing, and fresh grated parmesan. I let the tortellini chill in the refrigerator in some dressing. This was a delicious summer salad!

I have made this recipe numerous times and both my husband and I love it! It is really a delicious and quick meal. Also, to add more flavor to the meat I marinate first in ceasar dressing for an hour or so and then place in broiler and follow the directions as posted.

I made a steak and a chicken version of this salad. Both were loved by their recipients. I made my own salad dressing and croutons. This is perfect using leftover steak. Thanks!

I didn't think my husband, a meat and potatoes guy, would like this salad at all but he loved it and so did I.  Quick, easy, nice to look at and wonderful to eat.  I served the pasta cold over the salad and I poured the dressing over individual salads so we could enjoy the leftovers without soggy greens.  Shredded parmesan would be a good addition.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!  Made this again onloy this time with chicken.  Just as good.  I marinated chicken breasts in some of the Ceasar Vinagrette salad dressing and then grilled.

This was really good.  I didn't mix everything and we made our own salads to our preference, but this was a hit at our house. As previously suggested, used Ken's light Caesar dressing.

This was great! I love love love tortellini, and it really bulked up what would have been a normal steak salad. I had never broiled steak in the oven before, but I was happy that it came out nicely. I'm glad to have discovered this recipe because I can now make many more variations of it with different types of meats, pastas, vegetables, etc. I had never thought of mixing pasta with lettuce for some reason- haha!

I really enjoyed this dish. I forgot to add in the black olives but it still tasted great without it. I think there was a little too much dressing involved, but other than that I really enjoyed this. The texture of the tortellini and the salad together was really interesting. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was a great idea.

This combo rocked! I skipped the olives and tomatoes and made my own dressing. Also used smoked tri tip. This was great for a warm evening...too bad I didn't have any leftovers.

This was a winner for us!  Left out the tomatoes (not a fan), used Ken's Steak House light dressing, and had to cook the steak a little longer than directed (maybe about 8 minutes per side).  Very yummy and very different! Next time I make it I think I will add some grated parm :)

Delicious!  I never thought to put these ingredients together.  We used tri tip instead of flank steak, other than that I didn't change a thing and I will be making again. Thanks!

I made some variations that fit with our family. We garnished the green salad with ranch dressing, regular crutons, and cubed venison that I broiled.

This was very good. Although I served the salad with the meat warm, I wanted the tortellini to be cold. So I boiled them earlier in the day, tossed them with Italian dressing, and let them chill in the refrigerator. This gave the tortellini a great flavor and made them firmer than they would have been if I tossed them into the salad right after draining. Thanks for this recipe. I think I will be adding tortellini to many of my salads.

This was a hit! The recipe says it serves 4, but I ended up using a steak that was a little over a pound, plus 16 ounces of pasta instead of 9. It ended up being lunch for 5 people, with enough left over for dinner for 2!

I'm sure you can't go wrong with the recipe as written because all of the ingredients and flavors blend well together.  What makes this recipe great is that you can use ingredients you have on hand and come up with a great tasting dish!  I used a pre-washed bag of romaine, some leftover grilled NY strip, tomato, red onion and some cheese filled spinach tortellini with Newman's Own Caesar Dressing.  Delish!  My husband loved it as did I!

This was pretty good. I used cheese ravioli because that's what I had on hand, and I used a bagged ceasar salad kit to make things even easier. Easy meal for a night when you don't want to cook something elaborate, you can just throw this together. Thanks for sharing your idea.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was good. If I made it again, I would not use flank steak to broil. I usually always broil London Broil and it comes out best. I used Newman's Own caesar dressing and it was too salty/garlicy with the garlic on the steak so I will switch up the dressing and use less garlic powder. I will make this again someday but switch those things up a bit. I also added fresh grated parmesan cheese to top it off.

Yum!  I was suprised at how good this was, and my husband even more so.  He only tried it to be nice, and ended up loving it.  I made a few changes to suit our tastes, traded chicken for beef and no tomatoes.  I tossed everything together except the croutons and dressing, added those last so that I could keep all of our leftovers fresh.  We had leftovers because my kids wouldn't touch the "nasty salad with PASTA in it", but I can only expect so much.  :)

Very pretty and fresh salad.  I did not put the flank steak on the salad, but on the side of the plate with the salad.  I also fried the steak in a cast iron skillet instead of grilling or broiling.  Used only 1/2 cup Ken's Caesar dressing.  Think a full bottle would have been way too much.  Whole family enjoyed the meal.

This turned out very pretty and tasted great.  I halved the recipe, grilled the meat, and only used about 1/4 of a bottle of dressing,  the recommended amount would have been massively overwhelming for our tastes. If you are concerned  about the amount of fat in this recipe, I would strongly suggest downsizing the dressing as well as the tortellini, and use a lean cut of meat.  I will be making this again!

Our family loved it!  I used precooked steak strips, and did not include the lettuce. I set the dressing on the table so everyone could use the amount that they wanted.  Our son requested some spaghetti sauce for his.

Everyone had seconds.  I'll be making this again.  Easy and quick.

My boyfriend said this was his favorite dish I’d ever made. I added onions and took out the olives, used spinach tortellini and put a little bit of garlic powder, salt, and pepper on it before adding to the salad. Took about 10 mins to make and was super easy!

This was very good.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used butter lettuce, Kalmata olives, and blue cheese crumbles.

I had to omit the garlic due to an allergy.  I didn't use Caesar dressing because we don't like it.  I served salad dressing on the side instead.  Other than those things, I did follow the instructions and this turned out very well.  The tortellini sure has a tendency to slip to the bottom of the dish so be careful to stir it up well before you serve it.

I liked romaine, tortellini, and steak combo idea, but I found this dish to be a bit tasteless. Next time I make this, I'll use a better salad dressing.

I will definitely make the recipe as written next time!  With ingredients on  hand, I used spinach tortellini and left over flank steak, cherry tomatoes and a jalepeno from our neighbors garden, some green onions and parmesan cheese and Italian dressing.  Wow!  Fabulous!  Gave half to my neighbors and they loved it as well!

We don't eat a lot of salad dressing in our home so I cut the recipe back quite a bit as far as that goes. My husband and four children really enjoyed this. I did add parm cheese as some reviews stated. It was a nice, well balanced meal.

I tossed the lettuce and tortellini with just enough dressing to coat and then arranged remaining ingredients on top of the lettuce and pasta on each plate. Added grilled asparagus and freshly shaved Parmesan cheese.

Very easy for a quick dinner. Excellent with a nice white wine. I used tender steak instead of flank steak and it was excellent. Followed everything else exactly. Will definitely serve this again.

This recipe is really quite tasty, and I love how quick and easy it is to make.  The flank steak smells so good while it's cooking, and pairs nicely with the tortellini - I would have never though to put it together for a salad.  Thanks LROHNER for the recipe!  We're having this again tonight :)

Everyone enjoyed this easy summer meal. I omitted the croutons. The only change I would make next time is to use half the olives (too many!) and use less dressing (I used about 1/4 the bottle) because it can be overpowering.

This is what I call a very clever left-over make-over!  I used a Caesar Salad kit from the grocery store, added the sliced olives and tomatoes, and then nuked some sliced left-over Tri-tip.  I tossed it all together and voila, dinner for 3 for about $4.  It took longer to cook the tortellini then it took to toss everything together.  My 15 year old asked, “Mom why can’t you make salads like this more often?  This is really good Mom.”  Thanks for the great recipe.  This one will go into my favorite recipes binder, and not to many make it into my binder!

Awesome recipe!  Really easy to make, which matters since I have a two year old and a two month old!!  Very tasty, my two year old loved it and even ate the lettuce :)  My husband also liked it and had the great idea of adding artichoke hearts to it next time! I can't wait!

I used whole wheat tortellini, didn't put croutons in with it.  I just separated all the main ingredients and put together that way (better storage for leftovers).  I also added blue cheese to mine and cheddar cheese to my husbands.  He used ranch and I used cesear dressing.  served with a side of crusty bread!!! good with the changes.

I took the idea for this salad & ran with it. changes I made are as follows: I used Quorn chicken analogue to make it vegetarian (yum). I used rotini because it's what I had on hand. (I would definitely have stuck with tortellini if I'd had any.) I added red & orange bell peppers & sunflower seeds because I had them around & they are a lovely addition to any salad. and finally, I used a homemade vinaigrette dressing instead of caesar. I am eating it right now and it's delightful. I think my substitutions prove how adaptable this recipe/concept is! thanks so much for this awesome idea, I will be making it again & again.

This is a great idea.  I made this for my boyfriend to take to work for lunch and he loved it! I added sun dried tomatoes and bacon pieces.  I also squeezed some fresh lemon juice on the lettuce to give it extra flavor.  Yum!

Loved this recipe.  It's going to become a staple at our house.  Anything that pleases the husband and the kids is worth keeping.  Everyone, even the baby, asked for seconds and thirds.  To make it even easier, I substituted a bag of romaine lettuce that's already torn into pieces and I used cherry tomatoes instead of cutting up large tomatoes.  Served with garlic bread and it was a real hit!

This went over wonderfully at our house.  The next time I prepare it, I plan to rub the meat with some steak seasoning and a touch of ground red pepper, and sprinkle the finished salad with freshly grated Parmesan and ground black pepper.

Excellent! My husband and I just made this on our honeymoon and it was great. We put a little less lettuce and a little more meat than called for to make it more hearty, and added the dressing on our own.

My husband thought this recipe was brilliant.  Unfortunately, I had to tell him it was not my idea.  We topped our salads with fresh ground pepper and finely shredded parmesean.  Definitely will make again.

Changed the recipe slightly to things I had on hand. Omitted the olives and croutons and put in cucumbers. Used the creamy garlic dressing recipe from this site. The broiling time was right on. The dressing I let people put on individually. Didn't have any leftovers and am giving it five stars since I would never have put the steak and tortellini in the same salad. Great way to use up leftovers!

This was excellent.

The only changes i made was in leaving out the tomatoes because no one in my family likes them.

It tastes so good and even my hard to wow husband commented on how good it was.

This was pretty good, but I would serve it as a side dish instead of touting it as an entree.  Definitely falls in the adult food category.  The kids just kind of picked at it.  It was nice for something different and took no time at all to make.  But, I will only make it again if I need an interesting side salad dish.

Did not care for this recipe. Thought it would be interesting, but the flavors did not go together. Maybe it was because I had a cold, will not try again though.

Very easy and very tasty! Whipped together for the families I vacationed with while at the beach. It was a huge hit.

My husband, who likes everything I make, was not able to finish eating this meal.  I will probably never make it again.
