I thought this dressing would be creamier, since it had 1/2 cup of mayonnaise in it.  It turned out very watery, and the dressing just sunk to the bottom of the plate, not sticking to the greens. Could be that just using the tomato pulp (no seeds or juice) would help cut down on the liquid a little.  For us, it was too tart, so I added a little sugar to counterbalance the sourness.  If I were to make again, I would probably try less cider vinegar or just use something a little milder like white vinegar, but less than 6 tablespoons.   The pureed tomatoes and onion do add a layer of texture which is nice.  It also makes quite a bit of dressing, more than 10 servings IMO, but we don't eat our salads loaded with dressing either.  I may try again with the modifications mentioned above, but will only make half a recipe next time.

I made the dressing according to recipe, only adding fresh ground pepper and a pinch of salt. I thought this was just okay, as I had a bowl of salad before work. For me, I think this would be better with a large tomato and either all balsamic or all cider vinegar. For me, the two vinegars fought for control, flavor-wise. I think it could use a little more garlic, too. The husband and kids haven't had theirs yet, I'll update my review once they have. EDITED: Husband and one kid didn't care for it--oldest boy liked it a little more than everyone else, but not by much. Again, I think this could be really good if I tweaked the recipe a bit.

Flavor is fantastic! Color isn't too pretty and texture was quite thin, but overall I would make this again!

I made this last night to put on my salad at work today.  I used 1 roma tomato with the seeds and light "real" mayo.  It was a little runny and very tangy so this morning, I added a packet of equal.  This helped cut down the tangy-ness.  It has a good flavor but does kind of pool at the bottom of your bowl.  Next time I make this, I might try adding in a little tomato paste to help thicken up a bit.

Lord have mercy make this recipe if you are crazy about
vinegar.  I couldn't finish my salad this recipe was so tart.
And I added twice as much mayo.  I'll give it one more try
but in my humble opinion, not good!  Sorry!
