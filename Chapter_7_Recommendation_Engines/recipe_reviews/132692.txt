This recipe is so wonderful. Panettone certainly is the perfect bread for bread pudding. I also use it Christmas morning to make french toast with our leftover egg nog.

If I could give this recipe more stars, I would! I baked this for guests, followed the directions exactly, and ended up with the most heavenly bread pudding ever. Definatly make this one.

The best bread pudding ever!  I omitted the butter and sugar on the top but none the less, perfect.  If you haven't tried panettone your missing the best sweet yeast bread ever.

I made this January 1 and it was sooooo good! Here are the changes that I made- 2 TBSP of sugar only- people- you dont need to use a ton of sugar! 2-1/4 cups 5% cream because I didnt have half and half, I used 1 TBSP orange extract because I didn't have Grand Marnier or other, ground cloves instead of nutmeg, no orange zest either, and no butter on top- but I did need to use and extra egg- cooked this at 350 for 1-1/2 hours without using the hot water bath method and it turned out fantastic!!!

Although the flavor was good, and the bread was delicious, this bread pudding was a little too sweet for my taste. Also, I like bread pudding to be more custardy, which requires the addition of more eggs. If I make it again, I will try it with less sugar.

Very good and moist!
I omitted the sugar and butter on top like the other reviewer suggested.
I also substituted 2% milk for half of the heavy cream.
I will put less sugar in the sauce next time. It tastes great with no sauce as well!

As written this is WAY too sweet... and listen,  I LOVE sweets!  I did like the panettone bread used in a bread pudding, and may use the bread again in one of my regular bread puddings, but definitely not with this sticky sweet syrup on top.  I didn't even use all the sauce and think I may need to mix it with some milk or something to even use it on anything else... WAY TOO SWEET!

I'd give it a five, but I add more spices to mine, no sugar and added coconut chunks, raisins, cranberries and topped with pecan. Sometimes don't do the sauce and top with agave for a healthier kick!

I didn't have any Panettone, so I used baguette, the juice as well as the zest from the orange, also added 1/4 c dried cranberries and raisins. It came out fantabulous. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a Christmas dinner party and boy was it a hit!  I wouldn't change a thing!  It is so rich you could probably serve this to a least 8 people instead of the stated recipe yield of 6 servings.  This will be my go-to dessert!  Thanks for sharing!

We had this as a New Years Brunch. It's extremely good, and extremely rich. I didn't have Grand Marnier, and so used Amaretto for the pudding, and Rum for the sauce. Yum!

Made this for New Year's Brunch and it was delish. Everyone loved it. I put a few coins in for good luck (told everyone of course). Doesn't really need the sauce but it is a yummy touch.

This was the best!  Even though I had to punt on some of the ingredients. I used Amaretto instead of Grand Marnier, a bit short of nutmeg, so I added some of Penzey's cake seasoning. All the rest was the same. the recipe was easy to follow. And the sauce!  I had all of my ingredients ready on the counter, and when we were finished with our meal, I put the sauce together, right in front of the guests. Again I substituted Amaretto and the cake spice for the required ingredients.  Yummy! I will definitely be making this again!!!!

This was such a huge hit to New Year's Day dinner. I doubled the recipe and made it in a small roasting pan. When I took the pork roast out this went in. One thing I did was make it with the panettone with chocolate chips in it because they were out of the regular citrus bread. OH. MY. GOODNESS! The orange and chocolate was such a great combination. Based on other reviews about the sweetness with the sauce I decided to provide a bowl of fresh whipped cream if anyone wanted to top it. It was GREAT!

Made this over the holidays (posting my review a little late sorry).  It is perfect for my family as we are half British and half Italian.  The combination was awesome and festive.  It made an excellent  Christmas morning breakfast.   Will be sure to make this every year from now on in.

this is a terrific way to make bread pudding. the only thing I did differently was I used raw Agave Nectar in place of the white sugar in the pudding and the sauce and it was spot on delicious

We followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out beyond all of our expectations! We made it just before midnight on Christmas Eve because enjoying Panettone was part of my friend's Peruvian Christmas Tradition, but they had never made bread pudding out of it before. It was moist and delicious and the Grand Marnier sauce was to die for. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!

This is a great recipe, thoughtfully planned and accurate directions.  It came  out amazing.  One half of a leftover store bought panettone was 13 oz. and it fit perfectly in the casserole dish.  I subbed orange juice because I had no liquor (omitted the added water).  I loved this so much I will probably make it again and again, but might try subbing some lighter ingredients because it is SO rich.

This has become my go-to recipe for all types of bread but it is especially good with panettone because of its light texture.  I do refrigerate my bread puddings overnight before baking, not just for the 30 minutes recommended in this recipe.  Make with any panettone, traditional, coffee cream, chocolate chip, etc.  I serve without the sauce.

I wanted to like this BUT I didn't. It baked well, was the consistency that I was hoping for but it tasted too much like fruit cake. It had this taste/flavor that was NOT appealing...to me. Plenty of people may like fruit cake and this is for them. I will try this again with a different bread.
