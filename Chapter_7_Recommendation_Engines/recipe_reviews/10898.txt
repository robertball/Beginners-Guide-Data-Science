I tried this with "Fiber One". The kids won't touch the cereal, but they just gave these high-marks and nicknamed them "Jiffy Bakes". I think you need to "rolling boil" the the corn syrup and sugar on medium heat for one minute. Then they aren't gooey. They set up nicely.

WOW, these were a great fit for my peanut butter craving! I brought the sugar and corn syrup to a rolling boil, and boiled for 1 min.& 30 seconds. Then combined the other ingredients, poured all of it into a casserole pan. Cooled for 10 min. in the fridge, and cut into squares! YUMMY, Chewy and Delicious! Fantastic!

Fabulous Recipe! Very Hot here in Ontario, Canada at the moment--I was looking for a No Bake Cookie.
Well-This is IT! I will make these at Christmas and dress them up with some Chocolate Drizzle.
These are EASY and good tasting.
Kids love them-Thanks for submitting this recipe!

These are sooo rich you'll eat one and feel tanked! I used Special K flakes instead of rice crispies and used half honey and half corn syrup--the honey gives these such great flavor. They're kind of gooey, but they're really good, so I'd definitely make these again.

These are like the ones we use to get in the school cafeteria when I was a kid. I made these for my son who loves no bake cookies and he went wild over these! I even tasted one and liked these alot better than the ones that call for rolled oats. Nice and crispy with the cereal. These are a soft set type cookie. The directions were a bit misleading though, so I heated the sugar over med heat until it came to a full boil, then boiled it for 1 minute before adding the vanilla and the peanut butter. Thank you, we enjoyed your grandma's cookies too!

I made these last night when I was dying for a midnight snack (always a brilliant idea) and was happy with how easy they were but not blown away by the taste. They're passable, but are very heavy/oily/sweet and tasted kind of artificial to me (and this from someone who's known to eat frosting from a can) ... you can definitely feel them sitting in your stomach. Mine did set just fine though— I boiled the sugar & corn syrup until the sugar dissolved, and my cookies set to a point where they firmed up but were still chewy & easy to bite.   All in all, they're fine in a pinch because they're so easy, but I think I'm going to tinker with the recipe to see if I can lighten the flavor up a bit. Great idea though!

These are realy good, although they don't firm up well. They are more like peanut butter rice crispy treats. My kids had a blast makeing them AND eating them.

I absolutely love these! I added a little touch of powered sugar on touch...gives it an extra sweetness! I was thinking you could use cocoa powder too to give them a chocolate BP taste which would be yummy too!! I will have to post  apic of them they are yummy for sure! Thanks for the receipe!

I grew up making this recipe, only I always use chow mein noodles, it gives it an extra crunch. It's a really easy recipe for kids to make. I don't know about boiling for one minute... just boil until the sugar is dissolved.

I thought I had everything to make these but when I took the PB down, I only had a cup. Since I was well into the making of these, I added 8 marshmallows in place of the rest of the PB. I also boiled the syrup for one minute. I don't think I'll ever change the recipe now. I like it just like it is.

This was a great recipe to try with kids!! my 4yr old love helping me make them. we rolled them into balls with our hands so he loved that! I did make half as recipe states but they are very rich on the Peanut butter flavor so I added 1tablespoon of Cocoa powder, 2tbale spoons of powder sugar and 1teaspoon of cinnamon and they tasted really good. almost like reeses peanut butter cups. this has been added to my personal cook book for later uses!

These are wonderful!!  So quick and easy!! We made them with the oats, as suggested in another post, and used chunky peanut butter.  I'm not sure they will make it until the function that we made them for!

These were really good!! The only problem I had was that they never really firmed completely, but who cares when you get your peanut butter fix. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made these for something different on Thanksgiving and they were a huge hit. I did boil the corn syrup and sugar for 1-2 minutes as suggested by a reviewer and the cookies settled really well. They were not too soft.  I also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the mix and it made the cookies even better!

I tried this recipie with Half rice crispies and half cranberry almond crunch and it turned out fantastic. When you are making it though you need to full out boil the sugar and corn syrup. They tend to set better then.

I followed the directions exactly except that I used Fiber One cereal.  I also used natural peanut butter.  When I put them on the wax paper, I thought they were doomed to be awful:  they were falling apart.  However, I "smushed" them down, and they came out as I imagine they are supposed to.  They're slightly chewy, they have very candy-like pull-apart moment when you bite in, thanks to the corn syrup.  They were ready in less than ten minutes, so that's a winning snack to me!

I have searched for this recipe for over 2 years. I use to make this in campfire girls , but we added a Hershey Kiss in the middle of the cookie and then rolled it into a ball. The heat from the cookie melted the kiss just right. OHHHH the memories !!!  Thanks for the recipe can't wait to make with my daughters! ***Please be careful when handling the hot mixture if you do decide to put the Hershey Kiss in the middle,  it's easy to burn yourself.***

I just made these and they brought me back to my childhood!  I did bring the sugar and corn syrup to a boil and let boil for 1-2 minutes before removing from the heat.  They are great!

These were good, but when I think "no bake", I think oats, not rice krispies.  There was nothing wrong with them, but they weren't quite as good as some other no bake recipes I have tried.  They are more like a peanut butter rice krispy treat than anything else.  Tasty though!

Great recipe! Instead of using rice crispies, I use a mix of oatmeal and special k. The first time I think I used a bit much and they were a touch dry and crumbly. I'm making them again and I think I didn't use quite enough and they are going to be a bit gooey. SO filling though! A great snack and protein/fiber boost.

These were a huge hit with my two boys, a friend of theirs and myself.  (My extremely finicky one LOVED them!)  The tip from LisaR about doing a ROLLING boil for one minute is, I think, the key to making these come out right.  The only thing I did different was the cereal - toasted honey crunch.  That leads me to believe the first four ingredients are an excellent base for a variety of cereals.  Next time, I'll use a chocolate cereal and see how those come out.

These were really good.  I have been looking for a good dairy-free cookie for a while now and this fit the bill.  Lots of peanut butter flavor and extremely easy to make.  Next time I might try replacing half of the white sugar with brown sugar and drizzle them with melted chocolate.

I made these and pressed the entire batch into a 13x9...sort of a peanut butter rice crispie treat.  Two things I'm going to try next time - add 5 1/2 cups of  rice cereal and maybe whip the peanut butter / sugar mixture a bit to fluff it up.  Also, once it's in the 13x9 pan don't press it down...just spread it out in an effort to not press all the air out of the mix. I think/believe this will make even the cookie version lighter and not so dense.

I make these a lot.  I did change the recipe a little and use corn flakes instead of special K.  The less expensive corn flakes work best as they are thicker and stand up to the mix better.

We were feeling rather peckish, and
searching are cupboard for a sweet snack. Fortunately, we had all the ingredients needed to make this super
scrummy peanut butter treat. We really
like the fact that their no- bake and
are quick and easy to make. We added 
marshmallows for extra texture although they are still really yummy without them. Sooooo moreish!

I used equal amounts of granola & cornflakes, 2c peanut butter, 1c sugar and 1 TSP vanilla. Stirred constantly until rolling boil then 1 1/2 minutes. Added PB & vanilla to sugar/corn syrup. Poured over cereal/granola mix. Combined well. Poured into a sprayed a 9×13 packed down then into the freezer 30 minutes. Then cut into bars. My husband said "these are really gonna be good" while waiting for them in the freezer. They were good alright! A keeper recipe-these were GOOD & EASY

These cookies were good, but not too much different from peanut butter Rice Krispie treats.  Not to mention, these have a lot more calories than RK treats.  I think if I made them again, I would add something like mini chocolate chips or chopped peanuts, to give them a little something more.
