My artichokes were large. I pressed a garlic clove into the top of each squeezed the juice of half a lemon on them and dropped the rind in the pot with the bay leaf sprinkled each with Kosher salt and pepper and followed the recipe. I melted 2 T butter with a slice of lemon in the MW for each of us to dip; served with oven-roasted chicken thighs and garden tomato salad. Beautiful plate and delicious too.

It has so much flavor that dipping the leaf in butter when eating isn't needed. I don't have a steamer basket so I just put the artichokes in about 3 inches of water and put the lid on. I cooked them for about 40 minutes and they were great.

The artichokes ended up taking 3 hours for the leaves to be tender enough to eat and the heart was way over cooked. The flavor was also bland. I will stick to boiling them.

It has been my experience that artichokes take 1 to 1.5 hours to steam. I don't use a steamer basket just place them at the bottom of the pot. I wanted to share a delicious dipping sauce. One cup mayo 2 tbls soy sauce one garlic pressed and 1/3 grated parmesan mixed together. Prepare ahead of time and chill in refrigerator. I found a similar recipe years ago couldn't find it recently so I did my best to recall it. Came out great!!

I made 3 just sitting them in a 3/4cup of broth mixed with garlic and seasoning salt and melted butter. I poured the mixture all over the Artichoke s and with a lid let them steam on medlow for 40-50 min. Served with melted butter w/fresh lemon juice. Was wonderful

I love how simple and quick this recipe is. Like other reviewers I found 35 minutes wasn't enough so added some time. I still pulled it too soon at 40 minutes. Next time I will go for an hour. It could be because I do not have a steam basket and left the artichoke sitting on the bottom of the pan. I've done this in the past with good results. I also plan to add some dried basil and lemon slices next time I try this! Also I tried another reviewers suggestion on the dipping sauce of 1/2 c. mayo 1 tbs soy sauce 1 clove garlic. For a little more flavor I added a couple tsp of worcestershire sauce.

Very good! Made exactly as is. I might have steamed for closer to 45 minutes - I didn't time it - but the artichokes were huge.

I hardly even needed butter. These recipe is simple and fantastic. The artichokes were cooked perfectly.
