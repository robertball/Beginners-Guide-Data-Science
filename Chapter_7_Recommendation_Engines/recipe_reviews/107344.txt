I'm the author of this recipe...I'm glad so many people are enjoying it.  One thing I notice is that many reviewers are saying that 1/2 cup of butter makes too much sauce.  It does make a lot of sauce, but the reason for us is that my family likes to dip their bread in the excess sauce to sop it up.  Regardless, I'm happy to share one of my family's favorites with you!

YUMMY!  After reviewing other notes..., I decided to decrease the amount of sauce - I used 3 T butter, 3 T Brown Sugar & 1 T honey with a dash of cinnamon... I steamed 1 pound of baby carrots since we like prefer our carrots a little less done  for about 10 minutes and then tossed them in the sauce.  They were delicious!

Everyone liked this. I doubled it, but it was too much liquid - would probably not use as much butter next time.

Really good! I used smaller baby carrots and halved the glaze, but there still was plenty to coat the carrots. Thanks for a simple recipe!

Great side dish!  I used a steam in bag of baby carrots and cut the amount of topping in half and added some cinnamon and nutmeg.

Great flavor. As some other posters noted, this does make a lot of sauce for the amount of carrots. Next time I will halve the amount of sauce so less butter is wasted in the bottom of the pot at the end.

I only offer constructive criticism for these sweet goodies.  Cleaning up, I couldn’t help but notice all of the butter sauce left in the pot.  Mind you, we ate all of the carrots.  Out of curiosity, I measured it and there was almost 1 cup of unused sauce.  I was bummed because I felt like I just wasted ½ cup of butter and ½ cup of brown sugar.  Since you only add the carrots to the sauce 5 minutes before serving, it would seem to me that you could use half or even a third of the sauce, toss ‘n coat, and still end up with the same result.  With practically all of the sauce left over, it also brings up another reality which is that this recipe really doesn’t have 23g of fat per serving since you don’t actually consume the butter sauce.

I normally use butter and brown sugar, but the added honey was a nice touch.  Definitely a keeper!  Enjoyed!!

These were very tasty.  My youngest son LOVED them.  I love the flavor the honey gives it.  A few changes I made: I add a little bit of orange juice to my boiling water to give the carrots a little more zing.  I also agree that 1/2 cup butter is way too much!  There was a lot of left over glaze.  But all-in-all a great tasting recipe!

Will use this one again with a couple of modifications.  We don't need extra sauce to dip bread in so just made half as much sauce as called for and used the 1 lb package of baby carrots.  It was plenty.  It was a tad sweet so will decrease the honey and brown sugar a bit next time.  Also steamed the carrots instead of cooking in water.  The flavor and texture were fantastic.

I didn't even think I liked carrots until I tried this.  I didn't use baby carrots though.  I just cut up the carrots that I already had on hand.

Oh I just loved this recipe and so did my family, made a nice change from plain carrots.  I just know I will be using this recipe again, Only change I made was to halve the amount of butter, honey and sugar as I thought it would be too sweet for my family.  Turned out delcious.

Love, Love, this recipe!  The sauce is great!  This makes a lot of sauce, but I love my carrots to be drenched with sugary goodness!  To cut calories and to lightly glaze the carrots, I used this recipe but cut the ingredients down a bit.  I used half the brown sugar, 3 tbs. butter, the full amount of honey and add a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Thanks for this scrumptious recipe!

This was pretty good. The only thing was there was too much butter and brown sugar, not so much because of a health concern, but more because it was a waste. A half a stick of butter and a couple tablespoons of brown sugar was more than enough, and I made more than 16 ozs of carrots. I would make this again.

I LOVED these. I only started liking cooked carrots about a year ago and this was the first time I actually made them as a side dish, instead of as an ingredient in the main dish. I cooked exactly as is. I read the reviews about there being too much sauce, which I agree it is more than you need for the carrots but it is so darn good, it can also be used for bread or probably even over meat. Delicious! Will absolutely make again

I have made other carrot recipes from here and this one is the best so far.  The honey is the key.   I agree with other reviewers who used 3T of butter, 3T of brown sugar and 1T of honey.  It was still more than enough.  You won't be dissapointed.

These weren't bad - I doubled it for my Easter crowd. They had a nice sweet flavoring but not too sweet. I sprinkled them with fresh grated nutmeg when they were done. The only thing I really didn't like was there was a lot of sauce. I think next time I will cut the butter in half.

These were delicious! I've made them twice now, and my family loved them. They were fabulous with southern fried pork chops...wonderful contrast to the savory meat. This will be a regular in our house.

I gave this 5 stars for incredible taste! It's more like a treat. You can get incredible taste with just 1/4 the butter and sugar...I only used 2 tbsn butter, 1/2 tbsn honey and 2 tbsn brown sugar and still, it tastes amazing. Remember that carrots are naturally sweet once cooked. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon :)

This is great, I love simple, but like some others, I do not care for over sweet.  I cut the sugar down to 2 TBSP, and reduced the butter by about half.  Also added a good pinch of sea salt.  If you like extra sweet and drippy this is perfect.  I am not saying I do not like the recipe because of this.. everyone has different preferences and I always say if a recipe is not suited to you, it is not wrong, it is simply a good start to find what does suit you.  If drippy sweet were my thing, you would have gotten that last star for sure :)

Simple and delicious even though I cut down on the good parts to help keep calories in check. Even my vegetable-resistant boyfriend said these were good.

Yes, there is too much sauce, but that is a good thing for us as we loved it.  Terrific way to get picky ones to eat their veggies.

I thought these were good, but my kids thought they were way too sweet.  I will make them again, but I'll probably cut back on the honey and brown sugar by about 25%

I loved this recipe! I followed it exactly and then decided to add a dash of cinnamon. They reminded me of candied yams, which my son loves so he had no problem eating this dish. I will definitely make them again

A little too sweet for our tastes.  I made this for a family dinner and it really wasn't anyones favorite.  If I made this again, I'll probably cut back on the butter, honey and suger.

Carrots turned out okay but they were extremely sweet even having reduced the sugar to 3 Tablespoons. Next time I’ll reduce the surgar more and maybe rely more on the honey for sweetness

made these for a crowd of 10. Great reviews all around, though I was running out of time and needed the pot for another dish (it was Easter) so after draining the carrots, I popped them into a casserole dish, stirred in the sauce, and popped it in the oven to finish. The sauce never thickened into a glaze, but I imagine that's because I didn't finish it on the stove.

I just made these for Easter dinner to rave reviews! To be fair I added two ingredients a touch ground ginger and a little bit of orange zest because I had both on hand for my ham glaze. Otherwise I followed the recipe as is and added the ginger and orange zest to the pot while cooking down the butter/honey mixture. They came out great and I will

Fantastic recipe.  I scatled down the amount of butter,  honey, brown sugar & butter to my taste as 1 teaspoon of each and sprinkling of cinnamon or even apple pie spice.  Great recipe and a keeper in my recipe box.  Thank you for sharing it with us all.

I was looking for something to go with a pork tenderloin that I had just made - looked in my fridge - saw carrots - and thought - what the heck can I do with carrots?  Found this gem of a recipe - holy cow - it was soo good!  I didn't put quite as much brown sugar - but I will definitely be making these in the future for sure!  YUM!

Delicious!  I have finally found a way for my husband and kids to eat cooked carrots!  I reduced the amount of sauce based on other reviews (cut everything in half).  It didn't take away from he flavor, just didn't waste extra sauce that I knew we wouldn't keep or use.  I've made this twice now and my carrots seem to cook differently each time.  Nothing to do with the recipe, just something I noticed.  This recipe reminds me of Cracker Barrel's carrots...delish!  I think I'll try to use this recipe as a base for making mashed carrots next time.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these for Christmas this year, and they were AMAZING!  I doubled the recipe, as we were serving 8 and there were two servings left after we ate.  They were still amazing re-heated one and two days later! Yumm!  Definitely will make these every Christmas from now on!

My family requests this dish for all our gatherings.  I have to make it for about 50 people! I always make my carrots the night before and then heat them through in a skillet.  The sugar caramelizes and gives them a wonderful crunch. Delicious!!

OMG...this was loved.  Got a new job and I'm  going to be a few days late on rent for my roommate....so I thought, the  least I can do is cook something for her. I look in the fridge and it was looking rough. I usually just boil my carrots and saute them with real maple syrup. It's great but good syrup is just not in my budget. All these ingredients are pretty fridge friendly. Doubled up on everything but the carrots because I wanted more sauce....yum yum yum. I did have to replace the brown sugar with reg white sugar....(and I put a lot of cinnamon too)....but my party of 4 still loved it. I think the cinnamon may have helped the sweetness. Thanks poster, you made my budget dinner. Rotatingggg.

I would agree with the other reviewers that this is way too sweet. I used about 1/8 cup brown sugar and that was already just too sweet.

This recipe is delicious and very simple to make!  I did not read previous suggestions to halve the glaze and the sauce was way too much.  Next time will halve the glaze for sure.  I also did not have brown sugar on hand so used half a cup of white sugar and a Tbsp of dark corn syrup instead.  Recipe tastes delicious even with substitution.  Will be making again with the brown sugar as I'm sure it'll be even better!!!  Will use this as my caramelized carrot recipe from now on!!

I'm gonna give it 5 stars even though I didn't follow the recipe completely. I have no honey so I needed a substitute and all I could find was italian dressing. So i did it. I also added cooked chicken breast chunks to the carrots when re-added to the pot to glaze. Annnd I didn't follow the measurements, I just played it by eye. Still came out pretty good and I don't even like carrots.

Probably the ONLY way that I can get my 2 year old to eat carrots! I did reduce the butter/honey/brown sugar combo by half, and I'm glad I did... But great recipe anyway! Thank you for sharing!

Like many previous reviewers, I also thought this made a lot of sauce. But thanks, MrsAltmiller, for explaining why you make it that way. Overall, this was a very good recipe. I might have liked this even more if the sauce was more of a glaze (not sure how to do that) than a sauce. The sauce tasted kind of like something you might have for breakfast (on waffles?) or dessert (over ice cream?). A very tasty way to eat baby carrots thanks!

YUM!  A great new way to serve baby carrots!  A great change from the usual vegetables.  Next time I may cut down the butter and the honey so that the carrots are coated but not swimming but it was definitely tasty!  Thank you for sharing!

We had this with grilled steaks and man was it good! The only thing I would change is a little less butter, it was a bit on the runny side for us. Other than that it was so delicious! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is wonderful! My toddler loves and so does my husband, both very good things. It's so simple too! I work from home and some days I just barely have enough time to get things situated for dinner. This is a perfect side dish for so many things. We especially love it with chicken. Thanks so much for sharing!

Great recipe!  I only had standard carrots on hand.. peeled and cut them into coins, adjusted the cooking time, as they did not require as much time cooking time to soften.  Followed others recommendation to make sure the carrots were dried prior to adding the butter/honey/sugar mixture.  The only tweak I added was a touch (approx. 1/8 teaspoon) of cayenne pepper.  
Gave the carrots some very mild kick.

I double the carrots to 2 lbs and still thought there was too much sauce.  The taste was still good, very sweet.  next time I will cut the ingredients to the sauce.

I used dark brown sugar, I think the picture in the recipe was made with light brown sugar .  

Yes it was sweet, but with the ingredients I expected that.  It was hella yummy and everyone liked it.

This has been my "go to" side dish contribution at family gatherings.   I too cut the sauce in half.  I'd be happy to amend my rating to 5 stars if Lisa amends the recipe to reflect these changes.

Excellent recipe. Followed the recipe, except for reducing the amount of butter a bit.  The recipe's author is right though - dunking bread in the sauce is yummy.

Delicious!  I did cut the sauce way back to 3 Tbsp each of butter and brown sugar and 1 Tbsp of honey.  I wanted it to be a little thicker than it was and cling to the carrots more so at the end I made a *tiny* bit of cornstarch slurry and whisked it in.  Other than just cutting back the quantity of sauce and thickening it a bit I left the recipe alone and it was absolutely delicious!

After reading the reviews I just doubled the amount of carrots. The extra pound I froze using a food saver - when I'm ready to use the food saver bag will become a boil bag, no soggy carrots.

Great flavor and taste.  I did add a little cinnamon and nutmeg plus some original Mrs. Dash. Will definitely keep this recipe.

I only made a few minor tweaks and loved it!  I made the same portions for 2 1/2 lbs of carrots and divided the  amount of honey in half. The other half  of was supplemented with agave.  My family loved it and asked me to make it for the next family function!

Simple and tasty. Took a lot longer than 15 minutes though to get the carrots tender.

These were so good! Even the kids loved them. Had the perfect amount of sweetness. I halved the sauce and was the perfect amount.

Very yummy. I was short on time so I halved the carrots lengthwise. I also read up in the reviews and used only 1/3 of the sauce mixture. After using a slotted spoon to serve the carrots I was left with maybe 1/4 cup of sauce. So I saved it and I will add it to the next batch that I make. I am going to double the carrots next time because it was so delicious!

Although I don't eat butter, I made this glaze for steamed carrots for my husband. I steamed the baby carrots in my steamer and added the glaze. I did change it up a bit after reading a few comments. 3 Tablespoons of butter, 3 Tablespoons of brown sugar, and 1 Tablespoon of honey--with a small extra squirt because he really likes honey. I cut the butter in small pieces, added the brown sugar, and then just threw it in the microwave (covered with plastic wrap) for about 25-35 seconds. After making sure it was well stirred and the brown sugar had disintegrated, I covered the carrots with the glaze. I will be using this recipe from now on! Wonderful!

These carrots are fantastic I took the extra sauce and put it in a sauce pan I thickened it with cornstarch like a gravey and then put it back over the carrots and it was a huge hit  and the sauce hung on the carrot making it delicious.

I did what other reviewers suggested by cutting the ingredients, the original seemed it would make way too much. I was just craving sweet carrots, and this was perfect! I didn't have baby carrots, so I skinned the regular ones I had and chopped them fairly big. Like I said, they came out perfect and cured this preggo momma's craving!

We will make this again and again I am sure.  When you want a sweet glazed carrot, this is the way to go.  Follow other reviewers and cut the glaze ingredients by more than half or waste a lot of it.

I personally substitute maple syrup for the honey. What can I say?..I live in Vermont! Love these (& kids eat right up!) Agree w/other reviews that less butter is good.

Love this recipe! I found it about a year ago and my family loves it! It does make a lot of sauce but it's okay because I like to finish this before all the other food so the carrots can sit in the sauce and absorb the flavor better! :)
I made this for the family last year at thanksgiving and EVERYONE LOVED THEM! They were gone within the first 10 minutes!

Great side dish!  I did drain some of the sauce. However either way it looked delicious. May try some cinnamon next time, as that sounds in inviting.

I halved the amount of sauce like many said and still had more than enough. I also placed it in the oven on 350 for 15-20 minutes. Tasted good and will make again. Maybe a bit less sauce though.

My son loves carrots this way. As she said, not the healthiest way to eat carrots but once in awhile is okay and they disappear super fast. I've done it before with just the brown sugar, a little butter and some salt and pepper so if you don't have honey, I think you can still pull it off. :)

This is the second time I've made this recipe. DELISH! I rarely have fresh carrots on hand, but canned works well. I drain the carrots and "steam dry" them in the pan as suggested with fresh cooked carrots. The given amounts DO make a ton of sauce, but as the author said, it's best to sop it up with bread or double the amount of carrots (or halve the amount of sauce, of course). Regardless of how you do it, these carrots are a TREAT!

Made this last night. It was tasty but way to much sauce for us as well. EVEN WITH BISCUITS. and a little too sweet. I would cut the entire sauce in half next time.

Excellent recipe, just what I was hoping it would be. I used 1/4 cup of butter, 3 T brown sugar and 1 T honey, per the suggestion of others, and there was more than enough sauce. I cooked the carrots until they were still slightly firm, drained, and immediately cooled them with cold water because I didn't want them to be too soft. After melting the sauce ingredients back in, I tossed the carrots in the sauce and heated them through.

This recipe is delicious! I boiled the carrots for about 25 minutes (because I like mine more tender), but other than that, the recipe is perfect. Even though the liquid is a little thin, it doesn't matter. The carrots taste amazing!!!

I loved these! I love the carrots from Cheddar's and these remind me of those. I had to cook them a little longer than 15 mins as I like mine a little more tender. Used about half less butter as we were having too much already in the other parts of our meal. I don't like a strong honey taste so only added about 1 Tbs. My fiancée doesn't like carrots or sweet much and he went back for seconds.

I've made this per the recipe and with cutting the sauce in half.  The carrots end up tasting about the same, just with less sauce.  Overall, this recipe is so easy and the whole family loves it.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these last night and I tried them after they were done and they were good. I just thought there was just to much sauce so what I did was I added cornstarch to the sauce and it actually brought out more flavor to the carrots because it wasn't so much a runny sauce but a thicker glaze!!!!

I liked the sound of this recipe except for the crazy amount of butter so started reading reviews and found 1 that I did use by TYLERDEN. Cutting back the butter to 3 TBSP, 3 TBSP brown sugar and 1 TBSP honey with a dash of cinnamon made my sliced carrots perfect with just the right amount of sauce.

These were a hit on our Easter table! They do remind me a lot of candied sweet potatoes. I used 1/2 the butter & it was still too much for just the 1 bag of baby carrots. I can see why the submitter would use it to dip bread or rolls in, tho!!

Delicious and easy!  I used fresh carrots from my garden.  We had them for Thanksgiving, and there were NO leftovers.  Everyone loved them.  Now I'm making them again for Christmas!  Thanks for the great recipe, and new family favorite!

Very Good! I did make one big change: I ended up putting about half as much butter as it called for, and it ended up just fine. Also, there was a lot of sauce at the bottom of the pan that we ended up putting on other parts of our meal, so there could have been more carrots in proportion to sauce.

My kids asked for seconds of vegetables!  This makes carrots taste wonderful!  I would personally use less butter and more honey, and I also substituted whole (sliced) carrots.  I will be using this recipe again and again!

Tasty, although not as strong a flavor as I was anticipating.  Also the sauce was soupier than I expected.  But good for a wide audience, including kids.

Carrots came out delicious! Next time I'm going to modify the recipe to a "lite" version by cutting the ingredients in half, but only because there was so much sauce left over. But then again, maybe I should add more carrots!

For each lb. of carrots used 3 T. br. sugar, 3 T. butter, 1 T. EVOO and a dash of cinnamon.  Cooked the carrots at least 35 min. and could have used more time.

These aren't too bad.  The reason I give it four instead of less is these are the only way I can get my children and husband to eat carrots.  They all are so picky with vegetables.  I get tired of potatoes, corn, and green beans so anything different is wonderful in my eyes.

Loved these. I didn't change a thing! Always make them when I do a roast beef dinner. The sauce is an awesome dip for roast beef and yorkshire puddings. (Sounds funny I know, but sooooo good) Thank you :)

Absolutely loved these!  I made them last Thanksgiving and again at Christmas!  The only thing I did differently was allowing the carrots to cook in the honey mixture until it had cooked down some into them.

Very easy. Tastes even better the second day when the carrots have had time to soak up some more flavor. I had a lot of liquid in the pot though- after I drained and added the butter. It didn't take away from the taste- but you may need to drain some of that  off before serving.

I have made this several times when my granddaughter is being picky and wont eat any other vegetable. She loves them and the rest of the family enjoys them as well. I do cut back a little on the sugar. Thanks for sharing.

A must-have side dish in our house.  I steam the carrots for about 8-10 minutes (my family prefers them with a little crunch).  I add a pinch of salt to the butter/honey/sugar mixture.  You don't even really need to measure the ingredients for this recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight and was about to rate it 4 stars b/c it was much too sweet for us (me, hubby, and two boys ages 1 & 3)....but then saw the ingredient list and said "ohhhhhh" - I made it with plain white sugar, not brown sugar.  DO NOT make the same mistake as me - definitely going to try this again with BROWN sugar, as called for.  Silly mistake on my part, this should be perfect with the brown sugar.  Thanks for posting! EDITING TO ADD: ah yes, it was absolutely the sugar.  Made these again tonight with *brown* sugar, just eyeballing the ingredients, and they were absolutely fantastic!! Officially my favorite carrot recipe.

Fast, easy and yummy way to serve carrots.  I decreased the butter, honey and brown sugar and added a dash of cinnamon.  I used:  3 tbls butter, 3 tbls brown sugar and 1 tbls honey.  Family love it.  This one is a keeper!

I love butter and i love sugar, the more the merrier! but... i thought 1/2 cup of each was kind of a lot. It doesn't really absorb into the carrots so basically you're left with almost a cup of syrupy liquid. I pretty much NEVER ever cut down on the amount of butter or sugar but I think I will next time.

Very yummy and easy, flavorful but not too sweet.  I cut the butter down to about 1/3 cup, and it was still plenty.

Very good.  I agree with the other reviewers that the sauce could be halved and still be sufficient for a pound of carrots.

Excellent dish! I did only use 1/2 the sauce ingredients and it was plenty for 1 lb baby carrots. I also steamed the carrots vs. simmering them in water.

I love these carrots. Instead of cooking them on the stovetop I roasted them along side a pork tenderloin in the oven at 425 for 35 minutes stirring them half way through. My nine year old even asked for seconds.

These were really good.  My 5 year old daughter ate a ton of them.  It was really simple and very fresh tasting.  My husband thought they were too sweet, but I liked them.  I think I would probably make them again.  I might add less sugar though.
