Richard, if you give this recipe another chance, with a little tweaking, I think you might change your mind.  Nancy, I gave this 5 stars because I don't usually like lamb, but I really liked this recipe.  I only make lamb occasionally because my husband likes it so much.  I did make a couple of very minor changes as follows... 1. I diced my own fresh tomatoes - 1 plum, 1 heirloom, and 1 medium size round, instead of using canned.  2. I substituted a full-bodied red wine instead of white.  3. I used a few sprinkles of dried thyme instead of fresh.  4. I added 1 Tbls. of fresh chopped garlic and 1 small fresh peeled finely diced beet.  The only change I made in the directions was that I cooked it on high in my slow cooker for 4 hours (I was short on time).  I served it over parmesan cous cous, and it was absolutely delicious!  I'm saving this to my recipe box.  Thanks Nancy!

I wouldn't make this again, the flavors didn't highlight the lamb, and honestly you could have used most any other meat and get the same result.  Garlic is needed and more flavor.

Thought this was a great one! Made a side of mushroom orzo and it was perfect.

Divine. The other recipes for lamb shanks that I have made from this site are delicious, but this one is the best. I made the changes suggested and used red wine and beef broth. Also added a chopped carrot, dried thyme and rosemary and a bay leaf. After 4 hours I opened the top of the slow cooker slightly to let the sauce thicken. I further reduced it on the stove before serving. I used the leftover sauce to add to a spinach soup I had made the day before. Also delicious. I will make this often as the weather cools.

I have made this twice.  First as written and the second time with what we thought would make it more traditional.  I substituted red wine and beef broth as others have suggested. I added 5 cloves of smashed garlic and added some dried thyme to the salt and pepper before dredging in flour.  Dropped in a couple bay leaves and slow cooked for 6 hours.  Served over garlic mashed potatoes.

Nancy this lamb recipe was the best!  I just made it for the wrong person.  A very spoilt husband who only likes burnt crispy tough meat.  His work made it Friday before Easter.  Burnt the  out of it.  I followed your recipe not knowing he had it at work and  it was super tender . Only rarely can one get lamb where I live.   He hated it.  He will not be getting it again or anything of this quality.. I added more garlic and herbs.  Thickened sauce with cornstarch after skimming fat.  Used red wine and beef broth.  Seated meat as instructed.  Cooked 6 hours on low .  Perfect.   Gave entire leftovers to my daughter who raves.

I didn't change a thing. But, after reducing the tomato/wine mixture for 10 mins and ending up with less liquid sauce in the mixture, I would only reduce for 5 mins or add more wine, broth and maybe water to the dish next time. I also want to try it adding several garlic cloves, maybe some bay leaves and parsley. But the flavor in this receipt can't be beat. It was delicious.
