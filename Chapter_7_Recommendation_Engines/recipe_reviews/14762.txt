I think the basic recipe is a great start.The first time  I made it as the recipes called but I felt the taste of the tomato soup overpowered the entire dish. The family liked it but the I found the flavor profile unimpressive.   The next time, I used the basic idea as a stew. I diced pork loin, sauteed it in a pan within olive oil, 2 cloves minced garlic, salt and pepper.  Not draining, I added 4 diced potatoes, 2 diced carrots , and 1/2 a diced onion, fresh tarragon, oregano, and rosemary.  When the potatoes started getting soft I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth, 1 can tomato soup, 1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar, and  1 tbs merlot.  I brought to a simmer, covered and reduced heat and cooked for 15 min. It turned out great! I was much happier with my version but I appreciate the canvas provided by this recipe.

Made this for supper last night, very easy and quick in the electric skillet.  I thought it was great, my husband also enjoyed, but suggested using stewed tomatoes or a light pasta sauce in place of the tomato soup.  I will try it that way next time.  Chops were tangy, tender and vegetables just right!  A keeper!  Thanks for sharing this one.

Loved this recipe! Simple, quick and delicious! I did add a sprinkle of basil, oregano, parsley and garlic powder only because I was afraid it would be too plain with just the Worcestershire. After we tried it, I think it would have been fine. No salt necessary either. Just needed something to accent the soup color. Used 3 bone-in chops that were thick and they were the juciest! Had to substitute frozen baby carrots (didn't have fresh)thawed them first.  I am a first time mom who used to work nights so I never had to cook but once a week. Now I stay home and haven't a clue how to get a meal to come together all at once. This recipe is definately going to be a keeper. Thank You!

My mother made this combo when I was growing up in the 50's she called it Roosevelt Dinner. We bake it in a roaster, layer the browned pork on the bottom, then sliced russet or red potatoes, sliced carrots, and sliced onion then pour 1 can of tomato soup mixed with 1/2 c water over the top. Salt and pepper the meat and veggies layers. Bake 1 hour at 350 degrees F.  10 minutes before it is done we add a can of drained sweet peas. Comfort food!

I had to play around with the seasonings with this recipes otherwise it would have been too bland. I added minced fresh garlic, 1/2 chopped onion, 1 tsp italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp celery salt. THEN it was great!

This was so easy to make!!  I used Italian style stewed tomatoes instead of the soup and it came out great!  I hate to cook, but I'll make this again...

I was skeptical with this recipe because of its simplicity, but it was actually very tasty and we enjoyed it a lot.  I did add some basil and oregano to taste.  I also used leftover pork diced up instead of pork chops. What a great alternative to the standard pork fried rice!
So easy!  I prepared rice to go alongside and it was a nice compliment.

This is a basic recipe my mom always made. The best thing is that the pork chop meat just falls off of the bone. I usually jazz it up with some garlic, cracked pepper and italian seasoning. Works great in a slow cooker too!

good for if you are in a pinch.  Very fast and easy although a bit bland.  I didn't have tomato soup so I used a can of spaghetti sauce and added some water.  I also had some precooked pork in the freezer that shredded up real nice to turn this dish in to a stew.  Not the best I've ever had but still good and great when short on time.

This was good.  I altered the recipe a bit and added cut up venison chunks, garlic, and cream of chicken soup; I also did a can of tomatoes with the liquid instead of the tomatoe soup.  Great for a chilly evening easy meal.

Was short on time one night so I whipped this up and glad I did-my husband loved it as so did I.  Will be using it often. I added a can of peas near the end of it's cooking time.

Very good!  I added 1/2 tsp Caraway seeds since the original recipe I had called for that or oregano.  The tomato soup and caraway seeds gave this recipe a little different flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  My entire family liked this, even the kids.  The taste is very simple, but I think that is why it was such a big hit with all of us.  True comfort food and it was wonderful the next day for leftovers. Thanks!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I ended up adding a lot of seasoning to it because it seemed bland without.  Good start of a recipe.

Fast, easy, and yummy! I had pork stew meat thawed, so I used that instead of pork chops.  I added 3 small stalks of celery. I diced the celery, carrots, & potatoes into 1-2 inch chunks.  I also had no tomato soup, so I used a can of tomato sauce instead.  I served it in a bowl with fresh French bread on the side, and it came out delicious!

Good, but the meat came out too tough and the veggies didn't get done completely. Next time, I will brown the meat for only 1-2 mintues and then let it simmer with the veggies. I will also double the water to let the veggies simmer longer.

I followed the suggestion and added Stewed Tomatos.  I actually used DelMonte's Italian Blend Stewed Tomatos.  It took me a little while to cut up everything, I'm a beginner cook. :-)  I added a couple more shots of worchestire sauce because I wanted a more bolder seasoning.

This was excellent...though I will need to add more "boldness". :-)

This recipe needs spices! It tasted like pork in soup. Next time I'll use 1/2 a jar of salsa or Rotel chilies in the sauce.

this was really mouth watering, my family really enjoyed it.  Everything is there for supper, you only have to open 1 can, I substituted canned potatoes in it because I was short on time and microwaved the carrots.  Will be one of our monthly try agains. AAA+++

My family has made this for over 40 years.  We make it in a roaster and add Worcestershire sauce and caraway seeds to the tomato soup.  It is absolutely delicious made this way!!!

I made this the other night and it was a HUGE HIT! The pork chops were so tender it was crazy. However, I made have added a few things. Instead of tomato soup I used a can of regular tomato sauce. And I added about 3/4 of a CORONA beer. It was so delicious. I also dredged the pork chops in flour and pepper before frying them. I wish I would have taken a picture.

It’s fine. Doesn’t make all my dreams come true, but it doesn’t disappoint either. Wish I made something else to go with it as it seemed to lack a “wholeness” to it despite having meat, starch and vegetables.

Very tasty skillet dinner. I increased the Worcester sauce to tablespoon and added about 1 tbs. Of rosemary .  It turned out a real keeper. I used pork loin chop which turned out tender  and moist. My wife really enjoyed it - and she can be picky!

This was fantastic and easy to make. My only problem was no tomato soup, just substituted 1- 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and added 2/3 cup of half and half to make my own tomato soup. . 
My wife loved it which is all that matters.

I modified this recipe based on what I had available; I didn't have any potatoes, so I used mushrooms and onion wedges. I served it with couscous, which was yummy with the sauce poured over it. Gotta love a dinner that cooks itself in one skillet- I even had time to whip up some peanut butter cookies for dessert while it simmered!

Hooray I was afraid I had lost this recipe. Actually I remembered the easy ingredients except we add caraway seeds.  However, after reviewing some of the reviews I think I will experiment with some of the other seasonings.  My familly has loved this recipe for years and my husband is looking forward to it tonight.  How can you beat something that dirtys only one skillet, is flavorful and such tender pork chops. We add boiling onions and mushrooms along with potatoes and carrots.  It definately deserves 5* in my book. Weezie

This was really good, I loved the potatoes and carrots. I used a can of diced tomatos instead of tomato soup. I loved having the chunks of tomato with the other vegetables. I also put some red pepper flakes and it added a great kick. This is definitely a keeper!

Easy & tasty meal!  I browned the chops in oil w/ 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I added 1 can of "Original Aylmer Accents" (tomatoe, onion, celery & green pepper).  I also added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning & 1 cup of frozen peas.

I tried this recipe for its simplicity and it's five-star rating.  The simplicity proved true, but the rating not so much.  It wasn't bad by any means, and I might make it in the future when I'm in need of an easy recipe to leave for the baby-sitter.  But I've come to expect five-star recipes to be near restaurant quality, and this one was lacking in flavor.  It tastes exactly as you'd guess a tomato soup sauce would taste: like tomato soup, which isn't bad, but doesn't knock my socks off either.

Loved it!  Soooo simple, and my toddler LOVED it!  We call it "stewy chewy chops" which she loves to say and it makes it sound like something really fun.  We used an expensive tomato soup with ginger flavor in it, which probably helped it from being "plain" as some others had said.  Also, if you make sure you reduce the sauce long enough (don't be impatient), it's absolutely rich and silky!

I don't usually follow recipes exactly as they're written, but I did on this one and glad I did.  Well, I did add a little more garlic.  Anyway, like some others, I was apprehensive about the tomato soup, but tried it anyway.  It turned out fantastic!  Wonderful flavor, the pork was juicy and tender and the veggies complemented the meal well.  The kids asked for seconds even.  I had another pork recipe on this site that was my favorite, think I'm going to have to change it to this one.

I Loved this recipe but i added quite a bit. I chopped up an onion and a green pepper and added it to the mix. i also used alot of garlic powder and pepper. I added a bit of hot pepper sauce because i tasted it and found it still tasted kind of bland. with the hot sauce it tasted great tho! thanks for posting this

This didn't taste bad, but it was just very bland--Even after adding onions, garlic, italian seasoning, and extra salt and pepper.  The meat was semi-tender, but did not soak up any flavoring.  Probably won't make again.

Very tasty and easy.  I took some of the other reviewers' advice and added Italian seasonings, chopped green pepper, and black pepper.  I just  eye-balled how much Worchestershire sauce I added and did not add extra salt.  It turned out great.  Thanks Christine for the recipe and to all the others who suggested variations.

I converted this recipe to work in my slow cooker. I placed the quartered potatoes on the bottom (seasoned with garlic salt and lemon pepper), added baby carrots and sliced onions on top of that. I browned 6 thick pork chops seasoned with Italian seasoning and placed them on top. I mixed 2 cans of tomato soup with a half can of water and the worchestershire sauce and poured on top. The meal was very good but I found still needed more seasoning. Was still a little on the bland side. This recipe has great potential and was easy to put together.

mmmm. i actually did not think i would like this but it was delicious & the whole fam enjoyed.  i scaled the recipe to 7 servings b/c i had 7 thin pork chops.  and after reading other reviews 4 this, i made a few changes... i used about a 1/2 cup water, i cut the pork chops up into about 6 pieces per chop, when i was cooking the chops i added ALOT of pepper, salt, garlic powder & about 1tbsp of itl.breadcrumbs.  after i drained the fat off, i added the rest of the ingredients as directed with the exception of using about two handfuls of baby carrots instead of reg ones and added a dash of hot sauce.  i also used some leftover tomato sauce to mix w/the soup.  when there were about 2min left, i added some more breadcrumbs salt, pep & garlic powder.  i usually am really light w/salt but this needed the flavor.  i also wanted to throw in an onion but i didnt have one on hand.  the picture submitted up top is from my dinner last night.  i will make this again. Remember, i scaled mine to 7servings..

Everyone in the family loved how tender the pork was.  When I browned the pork, I used a little oil and 2 minced garlic cloves to give it more flavor.  This was very good and easy--a great combination.

This was very easy to make, the pork chops were very tender. Next time I will doctor up the sauce a little bit more, maybe adding some Italian seasoning and garlic.

I added onion powder and garlic salt but it still turned out a little bland but overall good. Add some more seasonings to your taste and you have a great quick meal.

Very easy to make. The meat was very tender. It took only 30 minutes before the carrots and potatoes were done. I added some dried oregano. The soup didn't make the dish taste tomato-ey at all. I may try it with different soups.

Didn't think it would be very good but decided to make it since I had all the ingredients.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was very good, not tomato-y at all!  And, Pork was so tender you could cut it with your fork.  This is a keeper!

It is hard to believe a can of tomato soup could make such a great sauce...but it does. I added some wedges of onion along with the other veggies.
