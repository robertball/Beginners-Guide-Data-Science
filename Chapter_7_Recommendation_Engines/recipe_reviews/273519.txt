Perfect recipe for tinga and just like one I've made in the past, but shortened cooking time by using the Instant Pot! Easy to make and very delicious! We thought it was a little spicy, but didn't feel the heat level was overpowering. It's a nice slow hit of heat with each bite. The only change I made to the recipe was that I blended a can of no salt added diced tomatoes with the chipotle peppers because I was out of crushed tomatoes. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. While the chicken was cooking in the Instant Pot, I made our sides of Mexican rice, black beans, and corn.   Will definitely make this recipe again in the Instant Pot! Thanks for the recipe Soup Loving Nicole!
