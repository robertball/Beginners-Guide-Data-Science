not bad, but not overly exciting, either...i seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper, and added a clove of crushed garlic to the soup/milk...the flavour wasn't as cheesy as i was expecting, so a little disappointing...the chicken breasts i used were HUGE, so i extended the cooking time to 50 minutes (not sure what size chicken breasts cook in 20 min)...overall, while my husband enjoyed it, i would say it was a bit bland and unexciting, but easy.

An extremely easy dish to make.  The chicken breasts came out very tender and moist.  Instead of noodles, I used Zaarain's Jambalaya rice.  The rice was spicy but not too much so and the 'sauce' leftover in the chicken pan went over the rice and chicken.  Overall, good dish, I'll be making it again.

A very simple, easy meal. There's not a tonne of personality here, but it's a decent meal. As for the question about the 20-minute cooking time, that was plenty for boneless chicken breasts at such a high temperature.
