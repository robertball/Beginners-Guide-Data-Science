This is a great recipe, and popular at a major restaurant chain. The key is let the jello thicken but not set completely, and then you gently stir the sour cream, so it flows like ribbons through the sea of jello. You may want to do the jello the quick set way. Also good with pecans instead of walnuts.

This did not turn out for me.  I couldn't get the sour cream to mix into the jello mixture completely.  The sour cream was slightly cooler than room temperature, maybe that was the problem.  There were small white solid bits throught the jello.  It didn't look appetizing at all.  I had made this to take to a potluck dinner, and I didn't take it, because it looked awful.  I tasted it later thinking that it probably tasted fine, and that the problem was just the looks.  The taste wasn't great either.  I normally like cranberries, but I just didn't like the texture of the cranberry sauce in the jello. I won't be making this again.

This has been a Thanksgiving tradition in my family since before I was born.  We have always lovingly called it "the pink stuff".  Not for everyone I suppose, but always been my favorite day after breakfast.

Stir in the  cold sour cream and walnuts when the gelatin has almost set, return it to the fridge and let it set up. This recipe is wonderful, has been in our family for decades.  Even people who do NOT like cranberries take seconds! Any red gelatin works. I think it would be good with grape, too.
