Very tasty pork! Followed the recipe to a "T", and everyone enjoyed this. We used it for tacos tonight, and the leftovers will be used with rice and beans (like Chipotle's burrito bowls). Yummy!

I have made many shredded pork recipes. This is my favorite. I use the pork for tacos, burritos enchiladas and as a filling for tamales. I used pork tenderloins as I always find them on sale locally. Placing the tenderloins directly in to the crock pot instead of browning makes for less effort. You may want to add a little fat to the pork as it finishes as tenderloin is quite lean.

Okay, this turned out way tastier than I hoped it would! Yum! I didn't have roast but two loins and skipped to the blender part and cooked on low five hours. ( next time four). I made homemade tortillas and homemade refried beans and added green sauce with cheese and sour cream. Something about that green sauce with the citrus flavor is so yummy, you have to try it! Thank you for your recipe!

Made this today, followed to a T, except the butcher insisted that this cut of meat “doesn’t come in 3lbs”, so it was about 2.5 lbs. Someone commented in these reviews that it was “too citrusy” for them and it questioning whether they actually made it or not, because the final product didn’t taste anything like the marinade. I will make this again, but will marinade overnight and flip the roast halfway through cooking time, because the side that was face down cooked better and was easier to shred.

It was easy to fix although pretty much all crock-pot recipes are. It did not take long. And was very very delicious and flavorful in a different way than what you are used to with work. My wife and I ate it three times burritos, tacos and pork sandwiches.

Used a bone-in pork sirloin roast.  Very easy and very tasty.  We forgot the salt and it was still good.  Next time, I would add some honey.

Absolutely delicious! The entire family loved it! Seriously, I made this last week and when I was going to the store the very next week, my husband told me to be sure to get the stuff to make that pulled pork again ;-)
We had zero left overs! Hubby liked it as tacos but the kids ate it with rice. Yummy!
Btw, I did not use the blender, just put it all in the crock pot and whisked it a bit. 
After shredding, I did not add the cup of sauce back in but kept it on the side. My husband and I ate it with the sauce drizzled on it but the kids ate it without the extra sauce on top.

came out really well cooked perfect. Marinated it two nights ago and put it in the slow cooker yesterday morning. When I came home from work, my house smelled as if i was cooking all day. Smelled amazing, drained the grease and fat, pulled it apart in the pot added a little bit of lemon/lime juice and made rice. It was like heaven....it was amazing

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe. It was easy.  We like the meat served with crispy tortilla chips, Pico de Gallo (store bought or homemade), shredded cheese, and sour cream.  I will make this again, many times. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

The marinade provides great flavor.  The slow cooker kept the pork tender.
