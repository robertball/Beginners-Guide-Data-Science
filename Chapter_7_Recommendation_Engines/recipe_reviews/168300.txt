My picky son said this steak is great, something he NEVER says about a new dish.  The only thing I changed was that I added 1/4 cup chopped scallions.  This is definitely going on the regular rotation.

So I have never reviewed anything before but just had to on this one!  I was a little worried about this dish since we are not big mushroom people but it turned out awesome!!! Will definitely make it again and again!  We did do a couple things different:  1. Expensive cuts like sirloin not necessary- we used cube steak because that was what we had in the freezer. Turned out great!  2. We cut the steak into bit size piece vs the thin slices. Made it nice to cook and easier to eat. We also cooked the meat in the bacon fat and added a tbsp of butter at the end for flavor.   3. We chopped the mushrooms in a food processor. Made then into tiny pieces which is easier for non-mushroom lovers to eat. Had to add a little extra wine to the mix to cook.   4. Used penne pasta because it was smaller. The rigatoni at the store was huge.   A couple changes we will make next time:  1. Worcestershire sauce when cooking the meat. Just for a little extra flavor.   2. Add steamed broccoli to the oven mix for a veggie component.

I made this with brown rice last night because I didn't have the pasta and I had to use up some steaks and mushrooms. I'm SO glad I did, my husband and I loved it and we're still talking about it. Followed the recipe for the mushroom stuff to a t, it was great with rice. I put green onions over the top of everything.

I would've given this 3 stars, but I think the few modifications I made contributed to the not-so-great results.  I made it as written, except substitued fat free half-n-half for the cream (just what I had on hand), powdered ginger for fresh, and too much mustard (accidentally).  I also used proscuitto for the bacon, which was a plus.  Unfortunately, the sauce would not properly combine.  The butter was floating on top, even after simmering for the full time, and even after it baked in the oven.  It was way too mustardy (my fault) and just seemed to have too many strong flavors for one dish.  I think it could have been better if I made it exactly as written, but still not a keeper for me.  It was fun to try, though!

The recipe was perfect ! I didn't have any Marsala wine so substituted a sweet white wine that I had on hand, dried ginger and half and half. I also just added the bacon and heated through since I didn't want to waste the energy to heat up the oven for such a short cooking time. My husband doesn't care for feta but he ate this and loved it! Will be making this recipe a staple in my recipe box!! Thanks!!

This is an excellent recipe!  It was quick, easy and delicious.  It seemed a bit salty, but that was okay because I love salt.  My husband is the one who mentioned that.  It was very rich and very filling.  The next time I make it, though, I won't pair it with the pasta.  I think it would be paired better with a baked potato, but is just my opinion.

The was DELICIOUS!  I wondered a little at the combinations of ginger, mustard, cream,  red wine, and feta, but it tastes wonderful.  My husband said it was the best pasta he's ever had.  And don't skip the bacon on top...it adds the perfect finishing touch.

wow!!  fantastic, and I was a little surprised that it all blended so well. Personally the serving size was too large but that doesn't reflect the recipe itself.

I tried this recipe after buying all the ingredients it called for.  It wasn't difficult to make, but after reading it I thought it sounded fantastic.  I was not impressed.  I followed the recipe exactly, so not sure what happened...I thought it didn't have enough sauce for one thing...I might try it again though -my husband and youngest daughter both liked it.  (Might just be personal taste?  I love feta cheese but am not used to feta and steak...)

This recipe deserves more attention. I must have made this a dozen times within the past few months, and am constantly getting requests for it. Probably one of my all-time favorites.

This was fantastic! I skipped the bacon, subbed what I had on hand ( dijon instead of yellow, ground ginger, half-half instead of the cream, all red wine), and served it with a side of mashed potatoes instead of the pasta. Will try it next time with a little less butter, otherwise, a total winner!

I was nervous about making this for my husband because he's not a big fan of fetta cheese. He really enjoyed this dish anyway.  I think its spectacular, I will be making it again.

Make sure not to overcook the meat. I think using a Dijon mustard would have been a better choice for this recipe. I used dried ginger in place of the fresh because I was short on time. I settled on using a feta that had bits of sun-dried tomato in it. I thought it was just okay, my hubby-to-be loved it. May or may not make again.
