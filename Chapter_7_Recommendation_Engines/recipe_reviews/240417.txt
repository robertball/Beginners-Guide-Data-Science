Easy and good. I use Justin's hazelnut butter,  way less sugar and still tastes great especially if you're making for little ones.

Tried and true, teenager approved! My teenage kids made these on their own. They enjoyed how easy they are to make and clean up! I used homemade dough though. Thank you Taryn B for the idea!

This was a quick recipe which was. Very good for a last minute desert. But it does not last over night gets soggy.

These are a great snack!  I used a mini muffin pan allowing me to use less of the dough.  With one slice of banana and a small spoon of Nutella. These were a great bite sized snack to serve at functions.

These are so easy, delicious, and always a hit! I've made them quite a few times. I like to switch up the fruit- bananas, strawberries, cherries...all super tasty!

These are quick, easy and yummy! The crescent rolls that I bought only had 8 triangles per package (8 oz. package), so I only got 8 servings instead of 12. I only needed 1 banana as well. For those of you who are expecting the NutellaÂ® to melt, it doesn't really melt down that much. Kind of melts a little where it's touching the bananas, but that's it. I tried to spread it a bit when they came out of the oven, but I could tell that it seized up a bit, so I just let them alone. They still taste great, and are really pretty sprinkled with the powdered sugar.
