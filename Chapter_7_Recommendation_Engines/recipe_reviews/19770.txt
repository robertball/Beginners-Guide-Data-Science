This is a lovely base recipe which benefits from a few adjustments:

-Save yourself some work: you can chop the vegetables (except the garlic) fairly coarsely, since they're all going in the blender/food processor anyway.
-Blanch the tomatoes (it's quite easy) and remove their skins before chopping them into the mixture.  Otherwise, your guests will find themselves picking bits of tomato skin out from between their teeth.
-Seed the cucumbers before chopping
-Saute the garlic in olive oil for about a minute, and add both garlic and oil to the mixture.  (I dislike using raw garlic in anything, because it tends to add an unpleasant bite even in minute quantities)
-Cut sugar down to 1/2 tsp
-Substitute extra fresh tomatoes for 1 cup of the tomato juice
-Skip tarragon
-Skip green onions

For garnish:
-Minced red bell pepper
-Fresh parsley
-Chopped hard-boiled egg (very practical of the folks in Andalucia to add protein)

On the side:
We had some leftover polenta, which I sprinkled with shaved parmesan and served with the gazpacho instead of the usual crusty bread + ham.  Delicious!

This is a great healthy find! I went the easy route and used a can of diced tomatoes and it still tasted great. I also added a jalapeno pepper for kick, replaced the tarragon with cilantro, and omitted the parsley.

I really liked this tasty quick and easy recipe using ingredients usually on hand.  I subbed out cilantro for tarragon and added hot sauce to kick it up.  I preferred this version of gazpacho over others on this site because using the same ingredients as garnishes was pointless and topped mine with broken tortilla chips.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delish. I always add a small can of chopped green chilies and 2 avocados, one blended and one chopped.  I use only a small amount of the tomato juice when blending just half the veggies, this keeps the finished soup from being too muddy.  Then use the alligator chopper on the rest of the veggies to have a chunky soup.

I have used this recipe for several years.  I offer crusty warm bread with it, and it is a hit!  If you cut the receipe down, you can make this in a cocktail shaker, and serve it in a Martini Glass with a slice of lime..   makes a great brunch soup! And everyone is so impressed with how you served it!

I have made gazpacho in the past but my husband has never been a fan.  I decided to try this recipe and it was a hit!  It doesn't have any oil in it so its just the wonderful different flavors from all the veggies and spices mixing.  I now make this and put it in a pitcher in the fridge.  Now, whenever we want something healthy and cool, it's available.

This was fantastic! Summer vegetables from the garden always makes me yearn for Gaspacho and this recipe didn't let me down.  I only changed a few things:  I don't care for vinegar, so I substituted 2 Tblsp of Worcestershire sauce and I like my Gaspacho crunchy, so I added two ribs of sliced celery.  YUM!

This was great!  Blanched tomatoes to remove skin first and subbed cilantro for parsley.  Also garnished with a little sour cream.  I made this after a trip to the farmer's market so all the vegetables were ripe and delicious.  I used the pulse feature on the blender so it stayed a little chunky.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

OK, I made the mistake of scaling this recipe down for 1 person.  And made it again the next day!  Left out the bell pepper, but I always do, and it was fabulous! Even the leftover leftovers! They're all gone now, so I have to make it again.  (Thank goodness I used this recipe to try out my new food processor!)  Loved it!  Perfect for Phoenix in July.

I think this is absolutely yummy!  I used Spicy V8 juice for the tomato juice, used fresh herbs including cilantro and omitted the green pepper.  Also, put a little lemon rind in with the juice.  It was so good.  Will make again! (maybe tonight...)

Just a suggestion for those who commented on the gazpacho taking on a "muddy" colour. If you hold the cilantro and other herbs until after you have blended the soup, then stir the herbs in by hand, it will keep the soup looking brighter!

This was very tasty, but it had consistency of salsa.  Next time, I will not run everything through a processor.  A little chunky is how I prefer it.  It was yummy, though & I will make it again!

I agree with the reviewer who suggested to "use what's on hand".  It's summer now and fresh stuff is everywhere so I used all fresh herbs.  I also scaled back on the tomato juice and used  "Spicy V8" instead.  I also used a red pepper instead of green...just because I don't care for green peppers and it's my soup, right?  Oh, and I used Balsalmic instead of red wine to give a bit deeper red hue.  Yummy recipe.

Very good recipe, definitely double up on the tarragon and basil though as just using what is called for makes for a bland gazpacho.  Overall, great recipe to use as a base and change up to your liking. Very waist-line friendly too - which is a bonus now that we are coming into swimsuit season soon!

Such a delicious recipe for a hot summer day!  I gave this 4 stars, because I think it needed a little more kick to it (my personal tastebuds).  So I subbed out the parsely and put in fresh cilantro and fresh basil.  I loved it with the fresh basil instead of dried!  It is a perfect soup to make using vegetables from your own garden or from the local Farmer's Market!  Thanks for sharing it!

With all of my fresh garden vegetables and hot summer days, this cold soup is perfect!  We always add one or two fresh jalepeno peppers (seeded) and add a spoonful of sour cream before serving.  I like mine chunky, so I also add extra chopped veggies before...including a few sliced black olives.  YUM!!!!

Delicious, though I adjusted for my taste. I added Worcestershire to give a bit of umami and used a stick blender as I did not have a regular blender. Mine also benefitted from an additional teaspoon of sugar and more vinegar. I keep it in a pitcher in the fridge so it's easy to pour from. Add olive oil & a dab of sour cream to increase the wow factor for guests but I think it's delicious without those serving additions!

Nice gazpacho. I sort of regret spending the money to buy the tarragon because it is not that flavorful and doesn't seem typical of gazpacho recipes, but the overall flavor of the gazpacho is good, so I'll probably use it up in the end after making this recipe several more times. I put croutons on top of mine. Next time I'll hard boil some eggs and chop them up to add on top--I remember having  that with gazpacho at restaurants in Spain.

Love this recipe. I always omit the sugar, as it's completely unnecessary. Otherwise it's easy, healthy and sooooooooooooooo good.

This recipe was good but I had to make some modifications. The onions were very overpowering in this and so was the garlic. To make it less overpowering, I added an extra cup of tomato juice and added a stalk of celery which made a huge difference. I think celery is essential to any gazpacho recipe! Enjoy !

My family thought it was rather bland. Perhaps next time if we serve it with lots of condiments like chopped red onion, croutons, parmesan cheese, etc.

This is a great gazpacho recipe! I just threw everything in my food processor and it did all the chopping for me :) Used low-sodium tomato juice and added salt to taste. End result was awesome!

A great base recipe!  I made a few changes to suit my taste and needs.  3 cups V-8, 1/2 of a small onion and pepper, used 2 cloves garlic, subbed balsamic vinegar for red wine, omitted tarragon, used fresh basil, and subbed cilantro for parsley.  Also added a tsp sea salt.  Perfecto!

Very tasty.  I added a hot banana pepper and some hot sauce. My husband loved it!  He already has planned to take the leftovers tomorrow.

I had leftover tomato juice after making salsa and have now made this twice.  Each time I have added cilantro and a jalapeno, which does make it taste like a watery salsa.

This was a nice simple recipe. I pureed 2 cups of tomato in place of tomato juice - just because I did not have the juice on hand. I also skipped the tarragon as hubby does not care the flavor. My children did not like it, but that is to be expected when trying chilled soup for the first time. I'm sure after a few exposures they will get over that *smile*. I garnished with fresh parsley and basil.

My husband made a batch of this over the weekend. It turned out really good. I enjoyed it, and I dont really care for Gazpacho. He LOVED it. Thank you. We made no changes to the recipe.

I'm eating this as I'm writing this review!! This is very good and easy to make. Although I made a few changes due to what I had on hand it turned out to be the best gazpacho I've ever had. I used V8 in place of tomato juice, a red pepper instead of a green, 1/2 clove of garlic, I had no tarragon on hand and 1 tsp agave syrup in place of the sugar. I also added about 1 tsp of hot sauce.

Well-received at the party I made it for, but I felt like something was missing, perhaps a chili element? I just didn't feel that it had much character. I used fresh tarragon and basil, a little lemon zest as well as the juice, and canned San Marzano tomatoes (since tomato season here ends early). Very refreshing, and would be good for a summer picnic, but not strong enough to stand on its own as a main item.

This tasted fine after I adjusted the seasonings.  I thought it was a little bland, so I added a lot more herbs.  It tasted better, but the red color definitely took on a brownish cast.  The onion was a little overpowering, in both flavor and texture, so I will use less next time.  I will keep this on hand for snacking, it just wasn't wonderful.

Great soup! I'm a big fan of Gazpacho soup, and I make it throughout the year.
This recipe is different in that it doesn't use the traditional olive oil, so it's a good one if you are watching calories. I sometimes use V8 juice instead of tomato juice. You can add hot peppers, tabasco sauce, anything you would like to kick it up a notch.
Because I can't have garlic, I always leave that out and add a bit more onion.
If you aren't used to cold soups, this is a good recipe to try. It's like eating straight from the garden.

My whole family loved this! I made mine a day ahead and the flavors became a little too strong for my taste so I added 2 more cups of tomato juice. I will definitely make this again.

this was great!  i used spicy tomato juice and cilantro as well (be careful not to add too much cilantro or it may have that "salsa" flavor). it's a great way to use summer vegetables.

This recipe is great, the only problem i had was being able to fit everything in the blender. i blended each ingredient seperately and added them to a pot where i mixed them when i was done.  Also, might want to add a little less tomato juice (add it last) so that its thicker. Lastly, would be great with a half of jalapeno to spice it up.

As mentioned by others, this recipe is best if you don't put everything into the blender. Chop the vegetables (I also include a red bell pepper and put in more garlic than called for here)and combine all the ingredients. Scoop about half of it into a blender and puree, then combine with the other (chopped) half. The consistency is much better. Top with a little sour cream!

This recipe is a keeper! I don't like to review recipes that I have modified, but my changes are minor and personal. Swapped Red pepper for green, omitted the tarragon, and added a splash of worcestershire. Fun to make and a big hit with friends and family.
Thanks for sharing Kara.

Used fresh heirloom tomatoes and the flavor was amazing. I also don't like the texture of dried herbs so only used fresh. Made a couple of substitutions; cilantro instead of parsley and jalapeno instead of bell pepper. I like a kick! A drizzle of high quality olive oil at the end added a nice velvety texture.

Wonderful taste,and wonderfully easy.  I forgot to buy parsely, so I used cilantro instead, and I'm glad I did.  It added a bit more flavor.  I don't use tarragon and didn't want to buy it for just this recipe, so I left it out.  Still delish!

I have made this recipe for years but have never rated it until now. I love this soup. I have always used canned petite diced tomatoes and think it is delicious and so much easier. I also add a splash of Franks hot sauce for an extra kick. I am the only one in my household that will eat it and it makes a lot so I always take leftovers to work. I get raves reviews every time and someone always asks me for the recipe. Try it with tortilla chips or crusty bread. You will love it!

This was amazing and will be added to my list of summer favorites. The cucumber makes it so refreshing! With some slight modifications it also makes a flavorful salsa. I had to make it in small batches because the food processor kept overflowing.

Disappointing. Followed recipe but used V8 juice and added one Serrano pepper. Bland and unappealing. It may be I just don't enjoy cold soup.

This was pretty tasty although I made some modifications. I didn't have tomato juice (but had lots of extra tomatoes) so I subbed 4 cups of tomatoes in their own juices. I added two ribs of celery. I also like it chunkier so I did not blend the cucumbers or tomatoes and just blended the rest of the ingredients before mixing together. I did not have tarragon so I used cilantro!. Great with avocado and with pita chips!

So good and very easy to make.  Follow the recipe the first time, then add your own spin to it.  I added 2 tsp of chili powder the second time.  You won't be disappointed.

I don't think there's much wrong with the recipe as it's pretty standard. The only changes I made were adding a pinch of chili flakes and only 2.5 cups tomato juice. Still, it mostly tastes like cucumber flavored salsa, but I noticed that when I dipped french bread into it rather than eating it with a spoon, it was quite good.

I absolutely HATE tomato juice, V-8, caesars and bloody Marys.  Ironically I LOVE this soup.  I used the food processor to chop everything.  I also added fresh herbs from my garden.  Very good light summer soup.  I only make this in the summer when the vegetables are fresh and local.

Very good!  I followed a previous reviewer's advice and blanched the tomatoes on my first try.  The second time, I skipped the step, and the recipe did suffer a bit.  I also added hot sauce (1 tsp or so of tabasco) to give a bit more zing.

Very easy. I didnt bother "mincing' the vegetables. Just cut into chunks and put it all in food processor.  Reduced tomato juice to 3 cups - because i like chunky gazpacho - otherwise it would have been too soupy.  Also, needed a bit more flavor. I added some fresh dill and a little bit of tabasco sauce for some 'kick.'

This recipe is AWESOME!!  I added some very lightly sauteed (in olive oil) yellow squash, zucchini & mushrooms.  Also topped with a bit of chopped fresh basil & what a hit!  Served with crusty baguette & the family loved it.

This recipe was great. I did however, not read it properly and missed adding the chopped tomatoes and sugar. Honestly, it didn't even miss it. Also, I skipped the tarragon and basil and substituted lots of fresh cilantro, a tablespoon of Worstechire sauce and a dash of tabasco for some zing. Then I served it in a plastic martini glass, topped with sour cream and a fresh lime wedge. Delicious summertime soup!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! This has quickly become a staple recipe of mine! Incredibly EASY to make, HEALTHY and tons of flavor!!! I honestly have no suggetions for anything to change... thsi is perfect as is! I do however tend to add cut up cocktail shrimp to mine after it has been blended, just to add some protein. Also, you can truly use any color pepper you want! A+++++++

I love this!! I make it all the time and I never get sick of it!  I cheat and use 2 cans of diced tomatoes and I don't add any tomato juice and it's still soupy enough for me.  Yummy!!

I am not a huge fan of cold soups, but this summer I've been wanting gazpacho and have been looking for a recipe that looked "safe" (since I'm picky). This recipe is definitely a keeper. Modifications: I halved the recipe, used V8 instead of plain tomato juice (for extra veggie flavor), canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh and left out the tarragon. Yum!

This was quick and YUMMY!  My son (age 24) and his friend raved about it!  I added fresh chopped parsley and cilantro, no tarragon, and used fresh tomatoes.  I will definitely make this many more times!  Thanks for sharing!

The only thing I added was a diced avocado. I wasn't overly excited about this Gazpacho. It reminded me and my husband of salsa. I gave it a four star rating because it did taste good, but the texture wasn't what I had remembered eating before and I wanted to put it on corn tortilla chips or homemade burritos, which is what we ultimately ended up doing, cuz I wasn't about to waste all that produce!! I'll just keeping trying til I get the right one I'm looking for, but thank you just the same. :)

Very easy and refreshing during hot weather. As others have said in their reviews, eating this gazpacho is sort of like eating salsa. Be advised that this recipe yields a lot of servings. My husband and I ate it with French bread.

Very very good.  Nothing but fresh flavor.  Didn't miss the oil at oil.  I didn't have good tomatoes, so used one 14.5 can of diced tomatoes with juice and I used my "boat motor" stick blender.  I just feel I have more control of degree of puree.  I like a little crunchiness left to my gazpacho.
Again, great recipe, thanks for posting.

I did what others did and used a 15oz can of good quality canned tomatoes since we don't have any ripe ones right now.  I had fresh herbs so I used those including the tarragon.. Even though not dried i still used the same amount and it was delicious and I also just rough chopped the veggies as the blender does the work. It really does not need salt at all if you use commercial tomato juice as that is already pretty salty. Overall outstanding. i added some fresh chopped avocado to the top and served well chilled. Excellent recipe.

Followed recommended changes from another post i.e., garlic sautéed in olive oil, omitted herbs except for basil, blanched tomatoes, de-seeded cucumbers, etc. Additionally I put in a little bit of red chili pepper flakes, a dash of cayenne pepper, and a half of a small carton of Dei Fratelli Finely Chopped Tomatoes. So so good... Highly recommend this recipe!

Used food processor to chop all veggies.  Then mixed all liquids separate.  To make room in the food processor changed the blade and added veggies to chop fine to chunky consistency and slowly added liquid.  Changed our Parsley and tarragon for 1/2 cup chopped cilantro.

I used V8 instead of straight tomato juice, and chopped all of my veggies with my Vidalia Chop Wizard. That made it incredibly easy! I also added 1 fresh jalapeno. I needed to add a little more V8- maybe 1 cup or so. This is a great recipe, especially for the summer!!

Just finished making it out of the garden. I added some chillies and set it to chill.  I can see us using it with chicken, seafood or over cheese for a nice quick meal. With a salad, bowl of Mellon along with fresh mint and cucumber Mojito does life get better?  Let's eat!

This is my first time using this recipe and it's delish!  I pureed cherry tomatoes and ran it through a sieve instead of buying tomato juice, so I left out the sugar.  I like my gazpacho chunky, so I added one chopped cucumber and chopped tomato to the finished puree.

Great recipe! But instead of red wine I use apple cider vinegar it also gives the gazpacho a good flavour.

I only loosely followed this recipe - I used what I had from the ingredient list (everything except fresh onion, green bell pepper, and I just forgot the red wine vinegar) and sort of winged it on the measurements (a credit to my laziness) and it turned out great! I used Spicy V8 for the tomato juice and added some dried jalapeno (no fresh :( ) I'm letting it chill for awhile before I eat any more of it, but overall this was really easy and gave me the results I was looking for. Thanks!

This is the first gazpacho that I have ever made.  I wasn't sure I was going to like it, based on past experience, but this was just great.  I substituted red bell pepper for the green and used vidallia onion.  It was fantastic!

Great recipe.  Prepared it in the Vitamixer.  Left out the tarragon and parsley.  Used fresh basil and heirloom tomatoes. Sauteed the onion and garlic for a bit in olive oil before adding it to the Vitamix to take out the sharpness.

My boyfriend made this for me. It was delicious. He added a bit more garlic and tarragon and let it sit for a few days which definately added a lot to the flavor. It was very flavorful and extremely filling, perfect if you want to watch calories. So fresh and healthy too.

Pretty tasty. I used V8 for the tomato juice. I added some pickled jalepenos and instead of red wine  vinegar I added a few tablespoons of the vinegar from the jalepeno jar.

Delicious, but then after a few bites had a strange taste to it, not so sure why.  Easy enough to make but should have cut the recipe in half.  Made WAY too much for the 3 of us.

very good recipe, only changes I made were to omit the taragon and basil and replace with cilantro and used white wine vinegar in place of red wine for a smoother taste.

Wonderful! I added cilantro (just because I really like cilantro!!!). I also used canned tomatoes, but it didn't take away from the fresh taste.  Easy and delicious!

I love Gazpacho, and I am always so thrilled at how easy this is to make! I always use V8's spicy tomato based juice, and it works perfectly. If you like more spice add a seeded jalapeno, but try it before you add it if you use the V8!  We always have it with thick organic yellow corn tortilla chips, and it is perfect for a summer day (or when you're just missing the warm weather!)

I followed the advice of some other reviewers and only blended half of the vegetables to keep a chunky consistency.  I also used v-8 spicy juice.  This is a really healthy & fresh start to a meal.  THANK YOU!

Wonderful dish. I followed it to the letter, and it turned out perfectly. Make sure to choose ripe ingredients, and especially the sweetest tomatoes you can find.  Next time I think I'll try spicing it up with a bit more garlic and adding some hot pepper, just because I love spicy food.

Easy dinner on a warm summer night.  I substituted lime for the lemon, fresh cilantro for tarragon, added a banana pepper & a few splashes of hot sauce.  I topped with sauteed shrimp & avocado.

A number of years ago I would go to a small restaurant here once a week for gazpacho.  This recipe was close to the one I loved.  I did use 1/2 spicy v8 and 1/2 reg. v8, and added small amount of dill and chives.  I do NOT blend it at all!  Wonderful!

Amazing, quick, and easy.  In place of cucumbers, we used zucchini and in place of tomato juice, V8 spicy hot, 1 LARGE spanish onion in place of the other three, as well as three cloves of fresh garlic.  Super super easy, great.  Next time, we may use regular v8 for one cup and 3 cups of spicy hot.  Highly recommended.

My husband and I both love this soup! I do use V8, instead of tomato juice, but otherwise follow the recipe.  I make this very frequently in the summer and guests love it too! I serve it before the meal instead of salad.

I thought this was just okay as written.  At the time I made this, I had never tasted gazpacho and didn't know what I was aiming for, but was making it for my hubby & his grandmother who love the stuff. Per other reviews, I used V8 instead of tomato juice, but have since learned that V8 is probably what killed this dish.  I also added worcestershire sauce, and lime juice to perk it up, and I'd stick with those additions.  This was an easy recipe, but not impressive.  I've since found Alton Brown's gazpacho recipe, which is fantastic although labor intensive.  If you decide to continue with this recipe, please don't repeat my mistake of the V8 juice substitution--stick with tomato juice.

From what I can tell from the other reviews, exact measurement is not always necessary. I did try to stick to this particular recipe as much as I could, but my own tastes often lead me down different paths. This is a great recipe to "live a little" and it's easy to customize. VERY TASTY and a great hit :)

Excellent Gazpacho recipe!! My BF who was apposed to even trying it, quickly gobbled it up!  He even said, "we should make this again"!  We added a jalepeno for a little kick and a LOT more garlic (approx 10 cloves when recipe was scaled down for 4 - because we're garlic lovers) and we did half and half of red and green peppers... other than that, no changes!

Minor change based on other reviews. Added Worcestershire sauce 1T and used spicy hot V-8. Bursting with warm but not overkill flavors. 
Makes almost 1/2 gallon. Will cut in 1/2 next time.  To much for just 2 people.

Loved this! Added a whole jalapeño, used spicy V8 and a tablespoon of Worcester sauce. Did not peel anything, just put it all in my Vitamix and pulsed it to texture I  like. Was a little spicier the next day.  So healthy! Yum.

I loved the way this recipe turned out. I was looking for a gazpacho recipe without added oil or bread. This turned out nice and thick and was rich and delicious. The only changes I made was using oregano instead of tarragon and I added a small jalapeno.

I've made it with fresh, ripe tomato as well as in the winter with canned petite diced tomato and it is delicious both ways. Definitely a repeating recipe in my household.

I would entirely make this again!  I left out the tarragon and added 2 tablespoons of fresh oregano and served it along with ham and roast beef sliders. My husband told me he disliked gazpacho and asked me to make something else. Obviously, I didn't and he was surprised at how much he enjoyed it. It was refreshing, light and perfect for a hot afternoon!

Thank you, Kara!!

I've lived in Spain in the summer and never had gazpacho as good as this one.  Yes, I've made it twice now and the recipe repeats beautifully.  The only change I'm going to make is to double the recipe or maybe triple it.

This one is in my personal recipe book (with credit to you and Allrecipes.com).  Thank you!!

Used all the ingredients pretty much as listed, but peeled the garden grown tomatoes first, and seeded the cucumber.  I chopped the veggies (except tomatoes) separately in my food processor to get the right consistency I wanted with some texture. It's in the fridge chilling now, and I'll dice some avocado to garnish, and maybe hard boiled egg as someone suggested.

This ends up very one note once blended together, my family  ate it but it probably will not be a repeat recipe.

My son made this for a class assignment and it was a hit. I've never had gazpacho before, but I thought it was really good.

I found it too acidic so added less lemon juice and added 2-3 T. olive oil. My husband isn't a fan of parsley, so I eliminated that in the mix, but added some cilantro to mine before serving.

I only made one minor change that was recommended by a few others. I used cilantro instead of tarragon. I chopped the veggies fairly coarsely, too. I had only had gazpacho once before and never made it, but this was delicious and got rave reviews from my guests. Will definitely make again!

Altered slightly for our taste and what I had on hand (canned tomatoes- I'm sure it would be even more delicious with fresh- and no cucumber since I don't like them) but still turned out delicious.

Made this with just a few substitutions. Reduced tomato juice to 3 cups, then added a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Also used a tablespoon of dried parsley instead of fresh since that's what I had on hand. Served with tortilla chips, sour cream and sliced avocado. This was phenomenal and I will definitely be making it again!

Great recipe. Used two cups of tomato instead of four, and 1/2 onion instead of a full one. Tasted great. Worked well as an appetizer.

The only change I made was to save some of the vegetables to add to it to make it chunkier.  You can also add crab and even a few shrimp to the rim of the glass to make it a little more special and yummy. Husband loved it as well.

I've made this 3 times and I've found when I make it with V-8 juice instead of basic tomato juice, it has  more zing and my husband and I liked it more. It's a lot of chopping but if you use a cuisinart, it makes chopping much easier and faster.

Super fresh and super easy! I went with fresh basil since I had some in the garden. I topped it with some fresh cubed avocado, a light drizzle of good olive oil and some grilled shrimp. Made it a perfect light dinner for a hot summer night. Next time I make this I think I'll add a small jalapeño for a slight kick.

Loved that I was able to use my Vitamix for this. Nice cool refreshing lunch for a hot summer day. It was a bit strong of onion and garlic so I would cut those back next time. I left mine a little bit chunky and may go a little smoother next time. I would consider scalding the tomatoes and removing the skins if leaving chunky but if I go for a smoother textured gazpacho the skins would blend right in. V-8 worked great in this.

Very easy and very tasty.  I sauteed the onion and garlic first, used an Anaheim pepper instead of bell, fresh basil instead of dried.  It was very tasty that night, even better the next.

I'm giving this 4 stars.  It's great for a light summer lunch or dinner.  I followed the recipe, but I think when I make this again, I'll use 1/2 of a garlic clove.  I felt like there was just a bit too much bite from the raw garlic.  Or, I suppose you could take the advice of another reviewer and cook the garlic for a minute prior to adding it.  Otherwise, this was a really nice recipe and I'll definitely make it again.

Delicious. A friend told me about this recipe. I altered it a bit and added jalapeno pepper, and didn't have basil.  I also used 3 cups of V8 low sodium juice and added a can of diced tomatoes that I did blend. It does have the consistency of salsa if you put everything in the food processor, but I really liked that. Love it, love that it's healthy and cold on a summer day and love the left overs.

Mmmm, mmmm. This is really tasty on a hot summer day. Very refreshing. I did add a stalk of celery and 2 radishes. I minced everything up really tiny and only blended half of it. This kept it a little more soup like consistency. I also used lime juice instead of lemon. I will definitely make this again.

I made this last week with my 8 year old grand niece.  It is so tasty  and refreshing.  I keep it in a pitcher in the fridge and serve it often.  I am on Weight Watchers and it fits in perfectly.  The easiest and best recipe of the summer season. Foolproof.  My kind of gazpacho!

Good, but a little salsa-y.  I added 2 more tomatoes, much less tomato juice (about 6 tbsp V-8), much more garlic, more lemon juice, olive oil and 2 slices of crusty bread.  Thoroughly blended and chilled overnight.  This gives a different texture (thicker) and I think, excellent.

In our opinion this was better than the recipe done by America's Test Kitchen (hence the 5-star). We followed the recipe exactly. If I was making it again for myself, I would add a chopped jalepeno, but I am a heat-lover... I did try adding some tobasco to one of my servings, but it was a fail. It just didn't blend well with the other flavors. I did note that the heat level of the tobasco was enhanced, so be aware if you are going to try to spice it up a bit that your results may exceed expectations.

Awesome! Here are my modifications based on what i had in the house: used 3 galirc cloves, a full (giant) red onion - didnt have green onion. Added a 1/2 can of black olives plus a splash of the juice, handful of fresh basil instead of dried and omitted the lemon juice (I forgot to add it actually, but it turned out delicious!)

Also: instead of sour cream we pureed a few avocados with fresh lime juice and it works great!

Absolutely fabulous! I didn't follow the proportions exactly; I kinda threw the veggies in to my Food Ninja and let it do it's business. 

Instead of fresh tomatoes, I grabbed two cans of the herbed chopped tomatoes and used them along with two cAns of V8. My family ate it right up!!

Delicious! I only gave it 4 stars because I changed a few things. First off I made it to serve 5, but that doesn't matter much except with that in mind I used 3 cloves of garlic, used no tarragon, basil, or parsley and just used 3 tsp fresh cilantro. i omitted the green onions due to the increased garlic and only used a pinch of sugar. Finally, right before chilling I added a bit of olive oil, s&p to taste. i sampled it prior to chilling and WOW! perfect! Rather than store bought tomato juice I juiced organic tomatoes and blanched the others prior to chopping. Great recipe, saved to my recipe box for sure! I'm going to serve it with grilled tomato and avocado sandwiches on baguette.

This is really good. Made a few slight modifications based on what I had on hand and other reviewers' comments. Actually, if you don't want to eat it as a soup, this makes excellent salsa! We've been eating the leftovers with tortilla chips.

Fabulous. I make this often in the summertime. The one change I make is to add a few tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil through the top of the blender at the very end of the processing. Adds richness that I miss otherwise.

I make this gazpacho just about every week in the summer. I never get tired of it. It's such a refreshing delight on these HOT Sacramento days!

In my opinion the "blending or food processing" that this recipe calls for creates a very soupy salsa - I didn't care for it

Made this with only a small change -- added some celery for extra crunch.  Tripled recipe for a church supper I was having in my home.  Got a lot of compliments.  Really good!

recipe is excellent even though I have the worst food processor ever and had to improvise a bit.  Added cilantro and jalapeno and some sour cream on top of each bowl. Used a bit less tomato juice.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  Followed exactly, but left out some of the onons--too much for me. Will make again and again.  So healthy too. Thanks for the great recipe.

Delish!  I had gazpacho at a restaurant the other day and had a craving for more.  This turned out even better than theirs:)   Changes/ additions I made with what I had on hand:  no cucumber,  1 extra clove of garlic, extra 1/2 tsp of sugar, 1 seeded jalapeno, fresh cilantro instead of parsley.  This will be a summer staple in our home.  YUM!

This hits the nail on the head!  I used fresh tarragon and fresh basil and it had tons of flavor!  The only thing I did different was finely pureed everything except the cucumber and totamoes.  I added those last and pulsed them a couple of time for a chunkier soup.  Next time I may try red bell pepper instead of green to give it a brighter red color.

Very good and flavorful (I'm not too familiar with gazpacho and how it "should" taste).  Maybe my eyes are sensitive, but I found myself crying while I was eating this, so I would lay off on the onions at least by half the amount the recipe calls for.  Unfortunately I added feta before even trying the gazpacho without it because a friend said it was a must.

Good recipe... love the tarragon flavor.  I used a low sodium tomato juice and omitted the salt... we follow a low sodium diet.   Tastes wonderful!

I changed this quite a bit to fit what I had on hand at the time.  I just used fresh tomato, cucumber, a little bit of onion and bell pepper, red wine vinegar, parsley, basil, garlic, lime juice, and sugar.  The sugar really made this recipe for me.  I actually put in too much and will cut it back a bit next time, but it was light and cool and a little sweet.  This is the first time I've ever tried this, so I'm glad I found this recipe.  I will probably try some other variations in the future, but this was a good start.

I normally think gazpacho is a little too close to eating salsa out of the jar, but this was wonderful. The texture was perfect after pulsing in a food processor a few times in one batch, and keeping some of the vegetables more coarsely chopped. I will make this again, but next time with about 1 cup less tomato juice as it was a bit "muddy" as one poster put it. Great with a couple of diced jalapeños and green chiles. My favorite gazpacho so far.

Very easy and flavorful.  I added some chili oil and cayenne to kick up the heat, which is wonderful in this cold soup.  Make sure you chill it thoroughly (it's just not the same at room temp) and eat it outside in the sun!

halved the recipe and used one can(26oz) of whole peeled tomatoes instead of tomato juice and chopped tomatoes(about 24oz combined). tomato juice tastes too artificial to me. also used yellow pepper to make it more colorful and added 5 tbsp of parsley instead of 2 in halved recipe. this recipe is a true keeper. so easy, tasty & refreshing. served with chickpea salad over a bed of baby spanich.

This recipe is a great starting point. Experiment with your favorite flavors. I sub diced canned tomatoes, Spicy V8 for the juice, add a couple of diced avocado's and a pound of cooked salad shrimp for a complete refreshing meal on a hot summer night

I'll give this recipe 4 stars because my husband loved it. Otherwise, I wasn't too impressed. I used spicy V8 juice as other reviewers had recommended. I guess I was expecting more flavor because it tasted bland to me. Will only make again for my hubby.
