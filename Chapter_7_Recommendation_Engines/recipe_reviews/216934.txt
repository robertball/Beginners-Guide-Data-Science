Fabulous Irish Soda Bread! I love Irish soda bread and generally only make it once a year. And, I'll admit I'm used to the ones that are a bit more on the sweet side - made with raisins or currants best enjoyed with a cup of tea. This was a nice departure! I made it exactly as directed and since no "type" of onion was specified I chose the "green" onion in keeping with St. Patrick's Day. Plus, it's mild and pairs well with Cheddar cheese. Like others, I did use a bit more buttermilk but other than that this recipe is perfect. I scored it lightly before popping it into the oven and it baked up perfectly in the alotted time. Keri, please thank your friend Jim for this wonderful recipe. It's a definite keeper and one I'll make more than once a year! UPDATE: Made this again (easily becoming a new favorite) and added in a bit of minced garlic and some chopped sun-dried tomatoes...definitely turns soup or salad into a meal! Try it with a little "Herb Butter" from this site too!

I'm happy to be this recipe's first reviewer! This is not your average soda bread - I'm sure no soda bread aficionado, but in my limited experience I've found it to be quite plain and, well, kind of boring - but not Jim's!  This is SO flavorful; and not (duh) just because of the add-ins.  Whether it's the buttemilk,  the touch of powdered sugar or maybe just the right amount of salt I don't know, but this bread really is "alive" with flavor.  In addition, I found the bread flour an unusual but great choice - I love the sturdy structure it gave the bread.   I was also a little concerned about the high oven temperature but here, too, it proved itself - it gave the bread a nice crust that I really loved.  When I mixed this up I found I needed to add more buttermilk than called for to make the dough come together, but that was no big deal. I did use the cheddar as directed, but for additional flavor and color I used chopped green onion rather than the regular ol' onion called for and I was very pleased both with how it looked and tasted. Since this was just for Hubs and me I scaled this down to 3 servings and made one, small loaf.  Don't know how the submitter "scored" the recipe from Jim, but many on AR will be glad she did. This is one soda bread that should not be limited to St. Patrick's Day baking!

Hubs said he'd rather have this than dessert. I used green onions and sharp cheddar. Baked exactly 30 minutes. Served with Herb Butter from this site per Jillian's suggestion. Thanks Keri for a great recipe!

Made this for Recipe Group and we LOVED it! I was really excited to try this for a few reasons...first, today we had our annual St. Patrick's Day dinner and though I always make traditional Irish soda bread, I wanted to try a savory version too. Second, It just sounded wonderful and third, my hubby's name is Jim, and I just knew he'd get a kick out of it, lol. I halved the recipe to just make 1 loaf because I also made the traditional bread. I also needed to add some extra buttermilk, opted to use green onions and did not have bread flour, so I used AP flour. This was simple to make and smelled amazing while baking (I scored it with a knife before baking and when I took it out, I brushed it w/ melted butter and sprinkled it w/ flour, just becasue that's the way I always make my soda bread). I knew this was a true winner when my super picky dad ate like 3 pieces and commented on how good it was! This was a great bread that I will be making a lot! Thanks for sharing this winner, Keri! :)

Made this for the Recipe Group this week. This is the best soda bread I have ever tasted or made. The entire family enjoyed it this evening with our St. Paddy's meal. I didn't realize that I only had 3/4 cup of buttermilk so I mixed up another cup of 2% milk with lemon juice and ended up using all of it (1 3/4 cup total). I had vidalia and green onions and after reading the other reviews, I was happy to see that many were using green onions and went with that option. Knowing that my granddaughter is more willing to eat smaller rolls or biscuits, I decided to make half of the recipe into biscuits. These cooked in approx. 22 min. The larger half, I followed the recipe and that cooked in approx 35 minutes. Mine weren't really browned at that point so I turned on the convection oven for just a couple of minutes and they browned up beautifully. The texture of this bread is wonderful. The flavors of the onion and cheese with a little twang from the buttermilk are delicious. I won't wait until next St. Patrick's day to make this bread again - I know it will be requested often. Thanks for sharing, Keri!

I made this recipe as wriitten but for using all purpose flour. The aroma as it was baking was unreal, but I admit I wasn't really expecting it to have quite the equal amount of flavor. I was wrong. Great flavor and a soft airy texture along with a nice crisp crust makes this recipe a keeper. Do expect to have to add more buttermilk as others did - it was neccessary for me to add more. Thanks, Jim, for generously giving up your terrific recipe for Keri to share here.

Made this for Recipe Group. I couldn't wait! Easy to put together, smells wonderful. Taste is really good. I used green onions instead of regular and AP flour. This may have made them a little more dense, I will try it again with bread flour. Neighbor came over and tasted one of the biscuits I made with the second ball of dough. She is in love and asked to take some home for dinner, LOL! I told her they are really good warm with butter. Thanks Keri!! I love non-yeast bread.

Very yummy bread!   I made this exactly to the specifications of the recipe except halved, and it was perfect--down to the timing of the baking!   Everyone loved this bread.  Thanks, Keri, and make sure you let Jim know that his bread was a total hit!  I'll be making another loaf very soon.  UPDATE:  Today I made these as mini muffins.  Half a recipe fit perfectly into a 24-muffin tin.  Thing is, we preferred it as a bread because the taste was much better, even when adding a little more onion and cheese as suggested by the author.  The crust was better, but the taste was not the same.  So the loaf for us!

Delish!! All the way around. The ease of this recipe was great! The flavor popped on the crust with the flavoring on onions. My husband doesn't like raw crunchy onions but went back several times to get some of this bread. I followed the recipe to a T but used green onions to play off of others before me that used them for contrast and to pop, it soo did and I had such a beautiful loaf of bread, Speaking with the submitter. She helped me decide to take the 2nd part of the batch and make biscuit style rolls or drop style biscuits for something I was wanting. The 1st half I followed to putting it on parchment and patting it down but scoring it with a long knife into 6 pieces and letting it bake and the other half made about 13 biscuits. They went fast. I pulled the biscuits out at about 20-24 minutes and they quickly got buttered and eaten. The bigger loaf I left in and brushed butter on top to get that nice beautiful golden color...and it was devine and delish. The flavors between the cheese and the onion totally paired very well in this. I wouldn't change a thing about the over all bread. But I sure can see making this wonderful bread with other ingredients. This is an excellent bread on a side of soup/stew as well as some Colcannon. Thanks so much Keri, it's a surefire keeper.

This bread is ridiculously good.  Too good.  So good that it will make you fat, because you won't want to let anyone else have a slice.  I'm sitting here with a very full belly after devouring 3/4 of the loaf.  Like the last reviewer, I used spring onions, finely chopped, and strong mature cheddar cheese.

I'd be interested to know if the confectioners' sugar adds anything that normal sugar wouldn't.

First of all, for those reviewers wondering where the "soda" is, it's in the baking powder. ;-)

Secondly, this bread was so quick and amazing!  I even forgot to put in the vidalia onion, green onion, and cheese!  I was too busy multi-tasking.  I cannot wait to make this with those ingredients in it.  I think I'll mix it up with other additions, too.

I did realize I forgot the "flavoring", so I put an egg wash on the top of the loaves, then made them like "everything bagels" - garlic powder, onion flakes, sesame seeds, & poppy seeds.  I used white whole wheat flour and next time I'll add some flax meal.  I cannot wait to taste the result!

I followed the recipe to a T and didn't enjoy it at all. Looked like a cheddar bay biscuit on steroids. Flavor was very bland. Guess soda bread isn't my fav.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I used green onions and did the ole vinegar in the milk thing for buttermilk.  I didn't make enough of the buttermilk, so I had to add a little extra plain milk to get the dough consistency right.  Still, it turned out very well.  I made biscuits and they took twenty minutes.  I had company for dinner and these biscuits stole the show!  Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe, Keri and Jim!  *UPDATE* I just realized that I made a lucky mistake when making this bread.  I added a cup each of the cheese and the onion rather than the suggested 3/4 cup each.  It wasn't intentional this time, but it will be next time!

Yummy bread!  I used AP flour, 1/3 C green onions, and diced the cheese instead of grating it so there were little cheesy pockets.  Like others, I had to add 1/4 cup additional buttermilk so the dough would hold together.  Because it was St. Patrick's Day, I added 15 drops of green food coloring to the buttermilk so my bread was very festive.  I told my family it was Leprechaun Bread with Gold Nuggets :D  The color was understandably a bit off putting, but perfect for the day and the flavor and texture were great.  Will definitely make again!

Best soda bread I have had.  Because my kids don't like raisins, I look for other ways to "jazz" up soda bread.  Cheddar and onions were a great way to do just that.  I did use green onions as did some others.  The bread had great flavor and was moist and delicious.

INCREDIBLE!! Now, I did make a few very minor changes because of what I had in the house, like using all purpose flour. I used dried white / green onions, I doubled the baking powder, and I used about 3/4 c. milk with vinegar in it to sour it. But all those substitutions are basic and should not change the flavor or texture much. This bread is AWESOME. It came together so easily! Puffed right up, took 5 minutes to throw together, and baked while I made dinner. Everyone loved it. I love that it uses things I normally have in the house and is so quick and easy, not to mention delicious. A winner for sure! I let my dough sit for 5 minutes on the tray before baking to help it rise, I don't know know if that makes a difference but it can't hurt. Definitely try this. Yum!

This was great bread!  I did have to add extra buttermilk to make this come together.  It was delicious and I'll definitely make it again.  I used green onions as other reviewers had suggested.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing!  This turned out SO good. I too used "green onion" (scallions), because we love these, and this turned out really good.  I followed recipe exactly, but for some reason my dough was really dry, and wouldn't "stick" I had to add about 1/4C more of buttermilk - but I could have added too much flour, so that was my fault.  Came out perfect anyways! Love it Thanks!

We loved this bread! I chopped the onions really really small so the kids wouldn't notice them and added a little extra cheese. I also had to add almost a cup more of buttermilk. So delicious and so perfect with our corned beef!

Was good, needs less onions or to use green onions. Used sharp cheddar cheese and that was really good. Needs to cook about 33 min on convection 325F. Is ok but not fasntastic, although its a good bread.

Shouldn't soda bread have baking soda in it? The flavor was fantastic but this is not soda bread. I also omitted the sugar-it was an accident but I won't bother with it in the future either.

I used onion powder, because I didn't have the onion. And I figured my kids wouldn't like the pieces of onion in the bread. I increased the cheese to 1 cup. I cut cold butter into the bread and then stirred in the cheese and lastly added the milk. Definitely flatten to about an inch and then cut a big "x" in the top so it will split and look pretty when it comes out.

What a bonus this turned out to be. First off, it's the recipe group selection, and St Patrick's Day bread of choice. So, being out of buttermilk the quick fix of course is the milk/lemon juice trick, but I decided I wanted more. I also added about 1/4 C of plain yogurt to the soured milk to give it that thickness and sourness of real buttermilk. The addition also took care of the extra milk other reviewers said it needed. It was perfect. I wondered why the addition of the powdered sugar? I didn't add it and we didn't miss it. Cheese was a combo of both sharp white cheddar and Tillamook cheddar. I used an entire bunch of green onions instead of a yellow also.  Thank you Jim for sharing this recipe. It was wonderfully easy.

I'm so glad Jim let it slip that he had a great recipe - it RoCkS! I did have to add a little bit more buttermilk to bring the dough together. I used green onions.  The flecks of green and orange made this very visually appealing (we do eat first with our eyes). It smelled wonderful baking and was so delicious. I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing Jim's recipe, Keri!

Recipe Group selection of 3/12/11.  I thought this might perk up the soup and salad I planned for dinner and it certainly did.  I had to read the recipe 3 times to convince myself it called for baking powder and confectioners sugar.  I resisted all urges to tweak and other than halving the recipe I made it exactly as written.  It smelled lovely as it baked and it tasted just as good as it smelled.  I used some Sweet Texas onion so the flavor is present, but not overwhelming.   Next time I might add 1/2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning, but it really isn't lacking.  Keri, you be nice to Jim - he gave you a great recipe!

Yum! I had to bring a soda bread to a St Patrick's Day dinner last night and thought I would give this recipe a try. Traditional soda bread is a little on the sweet side and I was looking for something that would be good to eat with the irish stew that was being served.  OMG! this was delicious and pretty simple.  I will be making again. It does require more buttermilk and I followed other reviews and used green onion which I think really made it.

This bread was fun and simple to make. I give it four stars because it was heavy and biscuit-like, which I hadn't realized, and I'm not all that fond of biscuits. Then again, the heaviness could have been a result of the fact that I used melted butter and olive oil in place of softened, and all-purpose flour instead of bread flour.  Even so, my boyfriend liked it well enough and went back for seconds, so I think if you are a fan of biscuit-type bread then this loaf would be a nice variation on that.

This was my first time eating and making soda bread, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I did not have to add additional buttermilk as many others have mentioned.  I followed the recipe to the "T" and it came out very nice.  We particularly like the outer crust of the bread.  Thanks for sharing your friend's great recipe, Keri!

This is the quickest, most delicious bread I have ever had.  For me it doesn't rise as much as it probably should, but even so, the flavors are exquisite.  We usually have to cut the recipe in half and make one loaf so we don't overeat.  Thank you!

This is only the second soda bread recipe I've tried.  I used 1 tsp. of baking soda and 3 tsp. of baking powder which made a similar proportion of baking soda/powder to the other soda bread I'd made before.  I added 1/4 c. additional buttermilk.  This quick to make savory bread goes well with Tomato Bisque II soup.

I was a bit confused the second time I made this. The first time I added 1 T baking soda because soda was on my mind. Came out great! I didn't notice at the time it called for baking powder not soda powder. So the second time I just added the baking powder and no soda and it was not nearly as good. It wasn't done when the 30 min. was up so I had to put it back in for 10 min. I'm curious if the soda was just left out of the recipe. Next time I think I will use both like many of the other soda breads call for. I put corrindar seeds and love it.

Delicious! I made this as directed, pretty much exactly. I used 1 yellow onion (about 1 cup after my food processer pureed it :P) and 1 cup medium cheddar cheese. I had only 1 cup of buttermilk so I used the milk/lemon juice method to make another cup. I ended up using a total of 1 and 3/4 cups to get my dough to come together. However, since my onion ended up basically pureed it added a lot of liquid to the dough once I added it, which made me a little worried. However, it came out better than fine. :) Delicious flavor, especially when hot. I baked for 30 minutes and it was nice and brown on top, though slightly doughy in the center. Next time I'll cook a little longer, maybe putting foil over the top as another reviewer mentioned. My husband says this is his favorite bread of any that I've made, and I've made quite a few. And the fact that this is yeast-less and super easy makes this a new go-to bread recipe for us. I look forward to trying out new flavor combos with this. Thanks!

Awesome, I used what I had on hand. All purpose flour, regular onions and milk with lemon juice(in place of buttermilk).  Turned out great, cannot wait to make it again.

Great recipe.  Really good flavor.  I used green onion and med. sharp cheddar.  I wondered about the confectioners sugar, but it was just the right amount and complemented the savory.  I wanted mine to be a loaf shape and the dough was a little stiff, so I added more buttermilk and put in loaf pan.  It came out perfect.  It may have been a finer crumb than this recipe, but it was great!!  Thanks for the recipe.  Its a keeper.

I made this for Recipe Group just in time for St. Patrick's Day.  Like others, I also used green onions and needed just a little more buttermilk for everything to bind together well. Next time, I will mash the dough flatter since it wasn't done in the middle yet the top was nicely browned.  I put it back in the oven and tented it with foil to keep it from getting too brown.  It all worked out in the end, and I loved the rustic, hard, crunchy crust.  I will definitely make this one again!

To the posters who question no soda in this recipe -- baking powder has soda IN it. Check the label. Will be making this tomorrow.  : )  ********************************* Mar 18th : Great flavor! I also used green onions but halved the recipe to make just one loaf. Baked 25 minutes, as my oven always takes less time. I think I'll try AP flour next time, as the reviews support the exchange. Thank you for an excellent recipe!

Made this for RECIPE GROUP.  We LOVED it!  I made half the recipe using all purpose flour, which seemed to work just fine.  As others, I also used green onions.  I was concerned that the confectioners’ sugar might not mix in completely, so I added it to the dry ingredients.  After reading some of the reviews, I was going to add more buttermilk, but I didn’t remember until my dough was already rolled into a ball. :~)  Mine baked in exactly 30 minutes and I brushed it with melted butter when it came out of the oven.  I’m really anxious to try some toasted!  Thanks Keri and Jim!  I'll definitely be making this again, and soon!

We *really really* enjoyed this!  Halved recipe - used green onions - also had to add extra milk (scant 3/4 cup for half recipe).  Note to myself:  Next time, don't be afraid to pat down to 2 inches as directed - I was a little concerned it wouldn't rise much, so I left mine at probably 3 1/2" or so and sure nuff:  It was HUGE!  sliced cross in top which gave it much needed spread - nix the dry flour on top and try a butter/garlic topping instead.  Thanks so much for recipe - will definitely make again.

Loved this bread.  Very quick and easy to prepare and tastes even better the second day.  I froze one loaf for later since there are just two of us at home.  I used green onions, chopped fine which gave the bread a nice flavor.  This is a recipe I will make again.  Speed, ease, flavor, this is a winner!

First time very disappointed because of the texture and then realized that it did not have any baking soda (which is necessary when using buttermilk). Anyway, now use 1 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. of baking soda hence it tastes more like my own soda bread.

I needed a quick bread something to go with beef stew and decided to try a half recipe of this. It was very quick and easy and I love the onion flavor. I didn't have cheddar and had to use a milder cheese which was still good but I'll get cheddar for next time. I baked at 400 (convection) and it probably could have used another minute. I was worried it would be dry looking at some of the photos but it was not at all.

Fabulous! I never really liked soda bread - too bland and boring - but this has great texture and flavor!  I grated my onion, and also added about 2 Tbsp chopped chives (I liked the idea of using scallions for color, but I had none, so chives was the next best thing).  I also used extra sharp cheddar.  I think my baking time was about 10 minutes longer for some reason (I could see the center was still doughy) but other than that, the instructions are spot on.  We loved  it! Thanks, Keri!

First attempt at any sort of bread and it turned out great!  I really dislike onions so I left them out.  I was a little concerned at how crumbly my dough was so I may use a bit more buttermilk next time as others have suggested.  Thanks for sharing, will for sure make again!!

This is a great recipe. Very similar to my grandmothers drop biscuits. Everyone loved it.  It was a little to sweet for my taste with both the onions and sugar. so next time I will omit the sugar.  But I will definately make it again.

A M A Z I N G ! My kids now request "Jim's Bread". I heard my 12 yr old explaining that he didn't know who Jim was, but his bread is really good! The onions have to be minced and you can have bread on the table (2 large loaves) inside of an hour. Not messy and so so good! My Kitchen Aid Mixer and the dough hook rock this! I have made this with fresh basil and sun dried tomatoes and roasted and chopped garlic. The original recipe is still the best. Going to make it as pizza crust and spread it out super thin! SO SO GREAT! Thanks for the recipe! I have made it once a week since I found this!

I’m not a big fan of bread (eating or cooking), but I love cheese, so I thought I’d give this a try as it looked easy.  Gosh, am I ever glad that I did; it was DELICIOUS.  I did use fresh chives instead of onion since I had loads growing in the garden; plus, I think chives and cheese are a natural together.  Only bad thing about this recipe is that it’s so good I’ll have to avoid the scales as I’m craving more, but next time I’m going to make it into biscuits instead of a loaf.  As a note, I also had to add a bit more buttermilk and cooking time.

Very tasty.  This was my first time making soda bread.  I wish I had flattened the dough to more like 1 inch thick than 2, because I had a trouble getting the dough cooked in the middle.  It took about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe stated.  I don't think all of my kids were crazy about the onion flavor, so next time I will try increasing the cheddar and omitting or lessening the onion.  Also, my dough was very dry, so I needed to add 1/4 - 1/2 cup more buttermilk.

Thanks to Keri and to Jim for sharing a great recipe.  Made for the recipe group/ for family dinner on St. Patrick's day.  Used a chopped red onion as that's what was available.  House smelled wonderful while the oven was baking, family really enjoyed the levels of flavor.  Kids don't care for onion, but really liked the flavor in these biscuits.

made this for the recipe group, it was good. I used a sweet onion and kept my tweaking under control. I made as is the first time, but from now on I will enjoy playing with this recipe. I needed to add a little extra milk to the recipe (I made exact amount with lemon juice and milk). Measuring tbls of butter is  finicky. Served this with an invented soup, the family enjoyed it very much.

This bread is excellent. The texture is very nice, similar to that of a biscuit. I had some green onions on hand so decided to try those, it gave the bread great color & flavor.  The onion flavor is very strong, which I like, but for those who don't love onion, I bet it would be great without as well. I also used A/P flour, since I was out of bread flour. 
I plan on making this many times, I really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!

I used vinegar and almond milk for the buttermilk and I used a bunch of green onion. I've made this three years now - and Mom looks forward to it on St Patrick's Day! She likes to use it with leftover corned beef and mustard to make a sandwich (=

What a great, and easy bread.  I made it just as it was only added some scallions for color.   It's a dense bread, but very moist and flavorful.  And it came out beautiful!

The flavour was good. I used extra old cheddar and chives from our garden, but the dough was so thick, even after adding extra buttermilk, that even though I baked the loaves longer than indicated in the recipe, the middle was still undercooked. I may try again with even more buttermilk. Thanks!

This was absolutely fantastic! Made this along with corned beef and cabbage for St Paddy's day dinner, for a group of 13, including six children. The two loaves were the first things gone.
As I had no cheddar on hand I sub'ed Jalapeno Jack. Seriously the easiest bread to make. I threw everything into the Kitchenaid, then shaped and baked. Definitely keeping this recipe.

This was my first time trying any type of soda bread and I really enjoyed it. I did have to add more buttermilk as other reviewers have mentioned but that wasn't a big deal. I did feel that this was a bit bland and while I would make it again I would increase the amount of onion (I used green onions) and cheddar, I might even add something extra like some sun dried tomotoes. Overall it was pretty good; thanks for sharing!

I made this on St Patrick's Day since no one in the family likes regular soda bread. This was a hit with everyone! Iused regular flour since I didn't have cake flour and it was fine. Next time I may add a little more milk, onion & cheese since it was slightly dry. I also may take someone else's suggestion & try green onion. We are now soda bread fans(at least this recipe!)

This reminds me of Chedder Bay biscuits.  It was flavorful and was moist even the next day.  This one is a keeper for sure.  next time I may add a little garlic just to try it.

Love, love, love this bread!  It tastes like a cross between a biscuit and bread.  The onions are not at all overpowering and the cheese is just right.  Served on St Patricks day with cornbeef and cabbage.  Will definitely make this one again.  Thanks!

Maybe it's me getting used to my convection oven, but the bread never cooked through.  It was doughy.  I tried cooking it longer, but the outside hardened and it was impossible to eat. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I made this for the Recipe Group this week.  It was delicious!  I did find I needed to add about another 1/3 cup of buttermilk to get my dough to hold together well.  I used yellow onion which had a nice flavor.  A keeper for sure- thanks Keri and Jim!

There is a reason for all the rave reviews. This bread was fantastic! I made it for St. Patty's with our corned beef and cabbage dinner, but this will be made throughout the year for sure. Thank you Keri and Jim for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This bread deserves more than 5 stars! I have never made or had soda bread before, but I have to tell you I don't ever plan on making it another way.  This has to be one of the best tasting breads I have ever had.  It was extremely easy and fast to make.  I did use AP flour, because I was too lazy to take out the bread flour, but I will next time to see if there is a difference.  And I also used green onions, but I may try adding a sweet onion too next time.  As for the buttermilk, I did have to had a bit more, but not much.  This is a definite keeper that will be made frequently in my house.  Next time I'm going to try it as biscuits.  Thanks Keri for sharing an amazing recipe.

The flavor is great, but user error prevented this from being superb for us. As an inexperienced bread maker, I misread the ingredients. I saw "bread flour" and thought, "Oh, I've got that." I actually had CAKE flour...the only other flour I had was white whole wheat flour, so I used that. After 30 minutes, it was still raw in the middle, so I cooked it about 10 more minutes and we ate the outsides of it with supper. I think they would have cooked better as biscuits and I'll try that next time, along with the correct flour.

I was intrigued to try this soda bread --without any soda! It tastes fantastic (I'm an onion lover!) Mine came out quite dense, which I wasn't expecting. I think since it behaves so much like drop biscuit dough, I was expecting a light fluffy drop biscuit texture (think Bisquick biscuits) but I got something a lot more sturdy. Mine had to wait about 4 hours before getting eaten -- so it was cold -- and it STILL filled the house with an oniony aroma when I cut into it (which I liked!). I added 1/2 tsp. caraway seeds because I love them (and because they're so good with Cheddar and onions). You may (or may not) need about 2-4 more tablespoons of buttermilk to make your dough come together properly. Thank you for sharing, Keri, and thanks Jim, too!

Made this today to go with corned beef and cabbage.  I have never had soda bread before and was anxious to try it.  I invited my son over for lunch.  He was hesitant to try it, but after our meal, he asked to take a plate home for dinner tonight and said to be sure and put 2-3 slices on his "to go" plate, and he's really not much of a bread eater.  That tells me I will be making this again often.  I also used green onions for the color.  Thanks for the post--it was delicious.

I made this for the Recipe Group:  12, March '11.  This bread is AMAZING, and I'm not a big fan of bread.  In fact, we had never tasted a soda bread.  I am very intimidated by yeast so was very happy this is made without yeast.  The onion flavor just pops in this bread.  I used, green onion, yellow onion, and purple onion because I didn't have enough of any one kind.  I would make it this way again next time.  The cheese flavor is the added bonus.  Thank you Keri for sharing this recipe.  It quickly has become a favorite.

This was SUPER easy to make and went perfectly with the "Chef John's Irish Beef Stew" I made for St. Paddy's day last night. A nice dense rustic bread great for any soup, stew or even chili! I sauteed the onions and added crispy bits of bacon I had leftover. I didn't have buttermilk so used the milk/lemon juice substitute adding about 1/4 cup extra as some suggested (may add a little more next time). I also didn't have parchment paper so I used aluminum foil dusted w/ flour.  I skipped the dusting on top of the loaves and instead brushed the tops with melted butter. I like that you score with an X before baking because it breaks off nicely into big chunks (no cutting required). Next time I may try it with green onions and score the loaves before baking into smaller pieces or make individual biscuits.  :o]   *~* the milk/lemon juice substitute is: 1C regular milk with 1 tbsp lemon juice, let it sit for 10 mins before adding - adjust as necessary for your recipe, so I did 1 1/2 C milk with 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice for this recipe *~*

I followed the recipe exactly as written and found it to be really tasteless.  The time it took to prepare was greater than the 15 minutes suggested and, though it smelled wonderful as it baked, it tasted awful.....dry and unpleasant.

I guess I'm just not a fan of soda bread because this didn't suit me at all. On the other hand, my husband thought this was the best soda bead he's ever tasted (but he obviously likes soda bread much more than I do). If you are a fan, give this recipe a try. If I were, I'm sure I'd agree with my hubs. While a perfectly fine soda bread recipe, this just wasn't for us. Thanks anyways, Keri! :-)

The smell of this bread is amazing and makes for a great side to Corned Beef and Cabbage. I did the first batch and wasn't very impressed. So on the second round I added green onions finely chopped and some fresh dill along with a cup of cheddar cheese. I also added more buttermilk than called for and it turned out amazing.

This was so good! My dad said it tasted like pierogi bread. Everyone really liked this bread! The only change I made was to use green onion. I liked the green onion flavor better and thought it made it look prettier with the green flecks in it that kinda looked like herbs. Will definitely be making this again as it was easy and delicious!

Though it's not a traditional Irish soda bread recipe, this ended up being my favorite soda bread recipe.  I have tried 3 or so Irish soda bread recipes in the past but never found any of them to be interesting enough to try making them again.  Not this one!!  I used Irish sharp cheddar cheese and fresh onions to make the bread and we just loved it.  I will definitely make them again, maybe adding fresh herbs next time like chives or dill.

The bread texture itself is ok. It needs to be toasted to not be so doughy. It needs something in the flavor department. Perhaps a touch of salt or perhaps the onions needed to be caramelized before putting them in the dough. It should be ok once its toasted and very liberally spread with salted butter. All in all I think I need to play with this recipe a bit perhaps add some caraway seeds and other flavorants.

This soda bread is simply wonderful! I've been trying my hand at different soda breads all week, and every single recipe has come out tasting less-than-stellar. I took a final stab this morning with Jim's recipe, and I'm floored! It's fluffy without being crumbly, has a sturdy crust without being hard, and the cheddar and onion balance perfectly with the butter and sugar. This recipe is divine, and will absolutely be making the rounds through my regular baking schedule.

I didn't have an onion on hand, and I substituted a heaping tablespoon of dried minced shallots instead. It came out so tasty I'm not sure we'll bother trying an onion next time. Thanks for the recipe.

Tastes more like a biscuit. Added extra 1/4-1/2 cup extra buttermilk. Can substitute with green onions. Cubed cheese instead of grated for a chunkier cheese texture.

This was awesome.  It was dense, but a great flavor.  I will use this for more than just corned beef once a year - would be great with soup.

Loved this! Easy to make, tasty, great with soup! Best warm from the oven, of course, but sliced and toasted with butter the next day is wonderful, as well.

I am wondering if there was a mistake in the recipe. I followed the recipe using mild cheddar and green onions. I too think the flavor bland and can pick up the metallic taste of the baking powder. Maybe I didn't whisk the dry ingredients well enough? The loaf baked nice though.

Perfect! The combination of flavors and texture of the bread was amazing.

It was very wet before I baked it. It wasn't done in the prescribed time, I am bakng longer. What could be wrong?  It has been in an additional 30 minutes. Still very wet.
