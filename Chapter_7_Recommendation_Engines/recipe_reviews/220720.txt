I make this all the time it is so good. your going to love it.. I do fry the bacon though. the best of comfort food. I have made this using only 3 slices of bacon and it was great.

Super easy! DELICIOUS! I served with slice tomatoes and rolls. Really no changes except I added a touch of ginger and garlic in the cabbage water. Salted the egg noodle water too! So Cheap...

We are not cabbage-eaters! My family (4adults) was very pleasantly surprised with this tasty dish and all ate more than 1 serving. Changes: I fried and crumbled the bacon and added 2 T. bacon grease and increased the egg noodles to a 12 oz pkg. Frying and crumbling. the bacon added crunch and color (I think any food is tastier with bacon!) Changing the amount of noodles made little difference except to increase the number of servings. I wonder if the "distinct" aroma of cooking cabbage may keep some people from eating it (myself included)! After it is prepared the taste and smell of this dish is completely different than while cooking - amazing!

The only changes I made was to fry and crumble the bacon first (a texture issue with boiled bacon) and I added a Tbl of caraway seeds (you can't go wrong with caraway and cabbage). I increased the amount of noodles to 12 oz (to increase the number of servings). it was really good. thanks for the starter recipe

Good as is though I wish I had added onions for a bit deeper flavor.
