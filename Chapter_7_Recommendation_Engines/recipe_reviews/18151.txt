I know that some of you think I shouldn't rate this a 5 because I did change it a bit - but it was such a good starting place and the changes were minor: cut back on the anchovies, and didn't have tarragon vinegar, so used white wine vinegar and added 1/2 tsp dried tarragon.  My husband and I were reintroduced to Green Goddess at a new restaurant in town that highlights 40s and 50-style restaurant food - baked ham, great steaks (peppered steak with brandy sauce), wonderful meatloaf, Stroganoff - the kinds of food I remember being on the menu when my folks took us to "fancy" restaurants, but "kicked up" for the new century.  Anyway, we tried the Green Goddess, and my husband was hooked - and this one is better than at the restaurant.  Can't wait until summer so I can use fresh tarragon from the garden!

This is an excellent, easy recipe for those who like a good garlic/scallion flavor to their dressing. Easy and tasty!

So sad that I could not find tarragon vinegar or fresh or dried tarragon so I just used White Wine vinegar. I only used 1/3 a cup because the first time I made it I felt it was too bitter. I added another garlic and used 1 1/2 of the green onions. Also I only used 1 anchovy as they were extra fishy. I love anchovies and the more the better but these were just not that great..  I have to say with all that it was still amazing and delicious. I used Mayo light and you can't even tell the difference.. I live in South Africa and have a all girl get together tomorrow I can't wait for my girlfriends taste my Green Goddess YAY thank you so much.. It is also always better the next day

An excellent Green Goddess, not too harsh with the scallions like some of them are, and I used the fresh tarragon with white vinegar mentioned by another user instead of tarragon vinegar--I had fresh tarragon leftover from another recipe, so why waste it? I didn't have any problems with the anchovies being salty, but I soaked them for an hour  in a couple of cups each of water and white wine.

Served this over caesar salad...very strong but tasty! Good for garlic and onion lovers at least, will possibly try it in a pasta salad next time.

This is the first time I'd tried this dressing. Really great...similar to a caeser, but, better in my opinion. Very tart, garlicky and oniony. I think you can leave out the salt though, as the anchovies are salty enough. Thanks, I'll be making this again and again!

I was excited by this recipe but was terribly disappointed. Parsley being a very bland but the primary flavor made the only dominant flavor fish. I used half the anchovies, but still, that is all I tasted. My husband and I opted to throw the whole batch away. Sorry.

This was such a hit at a party last night, they told me I should bottle and sell it!
Only change was substituting 1/2 cup white balsamic vinegar for the two other ones.

We used this as a base recipe: We've never had g.g. dressing, so my recipe may be quite different.  We ommitted the anchovies & parsley.  We threw in some fresh basil and dried dill.  Also, used balsamic and apple cider vinegar in place of the tarragon vinegar.  The recipe does make more than two squeeze bottles full of dressing, so you may want to half it.  It's been going quick around here: great on spinach.

WOW....great fresh garden taste! I remember Green Goddess dressing back in the '60s, before restaurants started offering Ranch.  What a shame more don't bring this delight back. I feel this recipe is the best because of the amount of parsley - the entire bunch! If you cannot find tarragon vinegar, just sprinkle a little dry tarragon in the dressing. I would take this in jars to co-workers. They LOVED it. :o) Thank you, Verdie

The flavor of this is great, but mine ended up just a tad runny.  I think my lemon was too juicy.  Next time I'll add just a little lemon at a time.  Definitely use all of the anchovy filets!

I followed the recipe exactly and all I could taste were achovies. The sauce was a bit runny but could be easily fixed. We threw the whole batch away. If I made again i'd use half the anchovies.

This was the ultimate.  Surprisingly, I had no fresh ingredients (other than lemon), and it still turned out fabulous.  I opted to use Penzey's Fox Point seasoning to replace the major ingredients (shallots, garlic, onions, etc.).  I also opted to use 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream, and the tangy contrast to the lemon was great.  Can't wait to make this 100% fresh.

Made this for a big family gathering, everyone loved it and its consistency. I thought it was too runny.  I will hand blend in the mayo next time to make it thicker.

This sounds wonderful.  I love anchovies, and I like the idea of using half may and half plain yogurt.  Definitely something I must try.

I thought this was fantastic and had lots of bold flavors! It was not fishy at all (I thouoght I might even add some more anchovies) the only thing is it is too runny .....how should I thicken it? other than that .....LOVED it. Margaret

Now, that's what I'm talking about!! I used to make the Green Goddess dressing, from scratch, for a restaurant where I worked. When I read the ingredients for this recipe and saw that it called for green onions and anchovies, I knew this was the real deal. So many I've seen didn't include those two crucial ingredients. I didn't, however, use tarragon vinagar. Still tasted amazing without it.

I made this tonight the taste was vey good not too fishy.  A little runny, did not have a lemon so I put two table spoons of lemon juice in. I don't know whether to increase the mayonese or decrease the lemon juice or the vinager a bit.  Used half a cup of white balsalmic vinager and threw in a bunch of fresh terragon from my garden. The taste is great just a little runny.

I think this is a basically good recipe with great potential but it was WAY too fishy tasting. Next time I'll try using only one can (or maybe even half a can) of anchovies instead. I agree with a previous reviewer that it doesn't need the added salt!

This is great!  So very easy to make in a food processor.  I make a half batch (6 servings), as I am the only one in the house who eats it.  I could not find tarragon vinegar, so I used champagne vinegar with fresh tarragon instead.  Having made it with tarragon and without, I find it definitely adds a good flavor to add it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used worcestershire sauce because it has some anchovy in it in place of anchovies.  I used it in this recipe and felt it worked well.

I made this once with all the regular ingredients and once using vegetarian and vegan alternatives, I actually like my vegetarian one better. I used some homemade kombu seaweed powder and soaked it in the vinegar and just it gave the dressing a nice sea flavor with out being fishy and harsh.

I only loved this with WAY LESS anchovie.  I only used about one tin, rinsed, and it was still far too fishy.  Otherwise it's great - thank you.
