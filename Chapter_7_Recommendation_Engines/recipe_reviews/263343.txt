I had to add extra parm cheese in a rue to make it more moist. This was made with Gluten Free pasta, gluten free crackers and for my extra rue I used rice flour. Just make sure you use the proper size pan. My family loved it!

I added some dollops of ricotta mixed with marinara,  I needed to use some left-overs.  I used panko since I didn't have crackers.    
My spaghetti was left over from night before.  I topped with a bit of mozzarella...was amazing!!  the only spaghetti pie I ever enjoyed.  oh, my onion and garlic was fresh.  over-all a great base recipe
