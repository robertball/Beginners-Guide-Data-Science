As a Cajun I tried this and was disappointed in this recipe.

What a lovely cake! I used gluten free all-purpose flour, so I added an extra bit of milk and used butter instead of margarine. The cake came out light and moist. I think it is sweet enough, so I just used a simple powdered sugar glaze on top. It went very well with fresh fruit at tea time; really a delightful treat. Thank you for sharing the recipe. PS. I forgot to add that I only used 1/2 Tbsp of baking powder.

The cake was good, but I made a few changes, as someone else suggested. I also made a pecan caramel sauce to top it off and that was even better. I will make it again.

Batter was too dry, so I added another egg and a bit more milk.  Substituted coconut oil for the butter.  After baking, it was still a bit too dry, so next time, we will double the oil and use 4 T. coconut oil.  Other than that, perfect sweetness.  Kids even loved it and asked for more.  May also try adding a smashed banana for extra moistness, or even applesauce.  Overall, a simple, easy, tasty recipe.  Thanks!
