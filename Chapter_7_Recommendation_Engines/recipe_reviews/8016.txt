this is a WONDERFUL and easy dessert!  Definitely more like a cobbler, so it needs to be served with vanilla ice cream!  If you sprinkle the coconut and nuts under the cake mix (as one other reviewer suggested), it eliminates the burning and elminates the need of having to remember to add the coconut towards the end of baking.
A good variation on this is to use apple pie filling and a spice cake mix!!!

Delicious & easy!  I used only 1/2 cup of melted butter & 1/2 cup of the drained pineapple juice so it wouldn't have so much fat from the butter.  I used light cherry pie filling too.  Made mine with the coconut & pecans under the cake layer so they wouldn't burn (thanks to the reviewer that added that line a while ago!).  Turned out quite tasty & served warm from the oven with vanilla fat-free frozen yogurt. Reheated well too! Yum!

Great recipe!  Also made it with blueberry pie filling in place of the cherries and strawberry pie filling minus the pineapple.  So easy and yummy.  I also make it the night before so it has time to set.

I love dump cake--but I use a can of tart pie cherries instead of the cherry pie filling.  It gets rid of that artificial pre-made pie-filling taste, and cuts down on the sweetness.  It's still *plenty* sweet, don't worry.

I tripled the recipe and brought it to work for a co-worker's birthday. We served it topped with vanilla ice cream. It was a big success, and I've even had a request for the recipe (I would have probably had more, except that 99% of my co-workers are men - they like to eat goodies, not make them!).

I substituted devil's food cake mix for the yellow and distributed the melted butter evenly with a spatula. I omitted nuts and coconut. The top came out like brownies. The dessert was delicious with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.

I had this at a barbeque this summer and loved it!  I use tart cherry filling instead of pie filling (so much better) and I used PINEAPPLE cake mix instead of yellow!  It gives it more flavor!!!  Used pecans instead of walnuts and doubled the nuts. Awesome!!!!!

There are many versions of dump cake.  Other recipes call for only a 1/2 cup of butter/margarine instead of the full cup.  I have made it both ways and I think that the crust is firmer and crisper  with a whole cup of butter/margarine.    Many recipes call for the butter/margarine to be cut up on the top of the cake mix.   I have melted the butter and I have patted it on and I can't  tell the difference.   So now I just melt the butter because it is easier.   I do make one major substitution.    I switched to white cake mix.   I don't know what is put in cake mix to make it yellow but to me it gives the final product a little bit of a cotton candy taste which is still amazingly good don't get me wrong.  I just prefer the lighter taste of the white mix.   A classic upside down cake uses white cake,  and Dump Cake is  like a Right Side Up / Upside Down cake as strange as that sounds.    It is rich and to quote Steel Magnolia's,  "I serve it with ice cream to cut the sweetness."

Left out the coconut and walnuts, and used butter instead of margarine. Instead of melting the butter, I just thinly slice it and cover the the top of the cake mix. I also tried someone's recommendation to reduce the butter by half and add juice as a substitute. While it may cut down on the calories, it doesn't turn out nearly as good. The topping doesn't get very crunchy. Some recipes can be reduced fat, this is not one of them.

Everyone loved this dessert.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and added extra nuts and coconut as other reviews suggested.  I put some pecans and coconut in between the fruit layers and then added the rest to the top the last 10 minutes of cooking so it didn't burn.  EXCELLENT!!

I followed this easy recipe but just before serving added sliced bananas on top and drizzled chocolate syrup over the bananas. Made it taste like a banana split cake. Delicious!!! I continue to get requests for this version.

This is a GREAT dessert and the recipe is easy to follow. I'd never had the dessert before and searched for a recipe. I saw the 4.5 stars and figured I'd give it a whirl. I substituted butter and pecans instead of margerine and walnuts. It was one of the best desserts that I've had! I served it with vanilla ice cream and homemade whipped cream...so good!

This is so easy and very tasty.  These are the changes I made; I drained the pineapple and reserve the juice in a large bowl.  I put the drained pineapple on the bottom of a 9x13 cake pan evenly then sprinkle coconut over the pineapple.  In the bowl of pineapple juice I added cake mix and melted butter and stir until incorporated then I evenly put the batter into the pan.  Then I evenly put the cherry pie filling over the batter, then bake it.  It came out very good for something so easy.  I like this method better.  Even though I love nuts this is one time I left them out.

Didn't melt the butter, used the butter pats on top like suggested by others but still had dry spots where the cake mix didn't get wet. May try again and will mix the melted butter with the cake mix.  It was OK for me but hubby LOVED it.

I've been making dump cakes for years and enjoy them all! This is pretty much how I make them but I don't add nuts because of the hubby not liking them and I'm not a big fan of coconut, so I didn't add that. As we were eating it I had a different taste wondering what it was... Looking at the cake mix box in the trash I had mistakenly picked up a lemon cake instead of a yellow cake. It was very good! I like to melt the butter down, mix it with the cake mix and then spread it over the top of the cake.

My Mom always made this for large events back home in North Carolina. So I decided to make it for a church picnic this summer. I just HAD to make one for me and my family too of course. I liked heating it in the microwave for a little bit and then adding ice cream on top. DELICIOUS!

This is just the best! I love it and it is always a hit with whoever you serve it to. I've never tried it with ice cream as some reviewers have suggested but I will have to, sounds amazing! I also only use one stick (1/2 cup) of butter and find that to be perfect.
I've never made this with the coconut and walnuts but have eaten that way and it is also great (I just prefer without when I make it myself). Yummy!!

Once again I was looking for a simple dessert.  Something to make with ingredients I had on hand.  I came across this recipe and decided to try it.  It was very easy and it hit the spot.  The only change I made was to use chopped pecans instead of walnuts.

I started out and realized I had no cherry pie filling so I substituted a jar of mincemeat. I reduced the butter to 3/4 c. and covered the cake with foil the first 40 minutes to help reduce the dry lump problems I'd read about. Then I uncovered it and finished the baking. It was a hit!

Absolutely Wonderful!  I used fresh pineapple and made pie filling from fresh blueberries.  IT turned out AWESOME!  Next time I make this I am going to put the nuts/coconut on the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Mine started getting pretty dark in the beginning so I covered it with aluminum foil and it did just fine.

This recipe is a quick go-to, because you can keep most of the ingredients in the pantry ahead of time. It has a nutty, toasty, chewyness that will satisfy a sweet tooth.

I made this for an easy weekend dessert. Only thing I did differnt was use pecans instead of walnuts and placed them under the cake mix to prevent burning as others suggested. My fiance and kids loved it.

This was quick, easy, tasted great, and left only a spoon and cup to wash.  This is my favorite recipe in the world.  I made this with butter cake mix instead of yellow cake mix because I don't like yellow cake, and it turned out great!!

I had a version of this cake at a graduation party and it was delicious...had no idea that this was classic "dump cake" until I did a search for some of the ingredients and once again, AllRecipes came through! This is a delicious cake, and although we're typically not cake/dessert eaters, everyone asked me to make this again just two days later. I substituted pecans for the walnuts, but it probably doesn't make much difference which nut you use...whatever you have on hand works! Thanks, Barbara.

My family LOVED this even though I didn't make it exactly right. (I didn't read the reviews first! ) I told them you'll like it even more next time.  And have it with vanilla ice cream, OMG! I dumped crushed pineapple in a greased 9x13 and spread it evenly then cherry pie filling then cake mix. Patted it down and put butter squares on top. Next time more butter!

I give this recipe 5 starts but ONLY with the following substitution-use a can of sliced peaches in syrup instead of the cherries.  It goes MUCH better with the coconut and pineapple.  Also, make sure you drain the pineapple well, as you'll be using the syrup from the peaches for moisture.  My mother used to make this all the time when I was a kid and I loved it!  Definitely a keeper in this house!

I made the cake mostly as directed. I omitted the coconut, and put the nuts between the pineapple and cake mix. After 50 minutes I took the pan out of the oven because the edges were a little dark brown and I wanted to avoid burnt spots. After letting it sit a few minutes to cool, we tasted the dessert. It was great! I love quick and easy recipes - you don't even need a mixing bowl for this. I plan to try some of the variations that others have suggested, too.

This turned out really really yummy!  It is more like a crisp or cobbler so don't expect a cake cake.  I used a white sour cream cake mix not yellow, didn't drain the pineapple (turned out just fine) and put the coconut and nuts on the last ten minutes and they toated up real well.  Yum, yum, yum.

Delicious! I read previous reviews before making and I'm glad I did. I, also, put the coconut and pecans (instead of walnuts) under the cake layer to prevent burning. And I used only 1/2 cup melted butter and added 1/2 cup of the drained pineapple juice. The cake still had a very "buttery" flavor. By adding the pineapple juice in place of some of the butter it cut the fat, but not the flavor. Having vanilla ice cream with this is a MUST!! I will be making this again!! This is a very good recipe and thanks for sharing!

I LOVE dump cakes. I haven't tried it with the coconut, but I will next time. You can use blueberry or apple pie filling instead of the cherries too.  Make sure to serve this warm with vanilla ice cream!!

OMG OMG OMG
This was soooo good. I changed a few things: I used tart cherries instead of cherry pie filling (found near canned fruit not near pie filling), I put some pineapple juice with the melted butter to cut back on the butter some, and I added the coconut at the end. OMG, so amazing. mix it around a bit with a butter knife about half way through baking.

I've been a fan of Dump Cake for years.  I got the recipe from my grandmother when I inherited her recipe collection.  I recommend using either a 9x13 inch pan or an 8-9 inch square pan.  I think the sqaure pan works best as it makes the cake thicker.  

This is also good without pecans and coconut, whatever suits your taste best.  It's great served warm or at room temperature.

The cherry pie filling and crushed pineapple combo is great, but the yellow cake mix makes this intensely sweet (not surprising considering you're not having a fluffy cake, but a much more condensed form of it). I would only try this again with a homemade cobbler topping, not a packaged cake mix.

Wowsie has this one EASY EASY EASY and did it ever taste good!  My husband made this--and it was about the 3rd thing I've EVER seen him cook!  We made it with pecans since that's what we had, and ate it right out of the oven with vanilla icecream.  It was excellent!  And I'm not really a cherry pie person OR a coconut lover.  This will be a staple--especially when I need something really quick!!

Where do I begin?  Having read  many of  the reviews and gleaning ginormous  variations of the recipe, I've made it several times now while tweaking things a bit myself.  This is a "can't go wrong" recipe.  No matter what I try, it turns out good, albeit with the help of Jell-o and Ice cream on hand.   The Jell-o, because I sprinkle it on the fruit before topping with various flavors of cake mix.  I always use Butter in lieu of margarine (never margarine), but I do decrease the amount to almost half.  The most recent concoction was a Mock Strawberry cake using canned pears and yes..... Strawberry Jell-o and Strawberry cake mix.  There is no end to the variety one can come up with.  I'm thinking Pina Colada next, using instant Jell-o Coconut Pudding instead of Jell-o gelatin on top of Pineapple and topping with Pineapple cake mix and coconut.

I have been making this recipe for years now. I have only recently started adding some of the pineapple juice along with the melted butter to make sure the cake mix all gets moistened and bakes completely. We serve it hot over vanilla ice cream. Yummy!

I used butter instead of margarine. 1 can of cherry pie filling was not enough so I added another can of plain tart cherries which was not in heavy syrup.  Everybody loved this and it was easy to make.

I made this cake for a potluck and OMG!  People were going back for 3rds & 4ths. It was a huge potluck & my cake was the only thing that got eaten all up.  I have a friend on a paleo diet & I talked him into having just a bite, well he ended up having two helpings, I feel a little guilty about it, LOL! :)

I just looked this up on the internet if anyone else was curious:
Several mainstream cake-mix brands have downsized their boxes. We looked into it and found out that the new packages make pretty much the same amount of cake as they did before. The cake formulas have just changed a bit, and now the mixes weigh less. So what does this mean for HG recipes? It's simple. If the recipe calls for half of an 18.25-oz. box, just use the approximate cup amount given in parentheses -- about 1 3/4 cups (which is still about half the box!). If the recipe calls for an entire 18.25-oz. box, use any whole box with 15.25 - 18.25 ounces. We've tried both of these types of recipes with the new smaller boxes, and they came out perfectly! The only slight change? It may take a few minutes longer for your cake

I found a recipe similar to this in a cookbook titled, "Texas Celebrity Cookbook," by Russell Gardner and Chris Farkas. The recipe came from Congressman Bill Archer of Texas. The only differences in Rep. Archer's recipe are: Omit the coconut, and the last step is 2 sticks of butter, sliced into pats and dotted over the top of the cake before baking. I have made the cake several times, and it always turns out excellent!

This turned out great. I did use a few of the suggestions by using white cake mix and additional nuts and coconut.   I layered nuts and coconut over the pie filling and then in the last 10 minutes of baking layered more on topo.  It was a hit a work.  I served it with whipped cream.  NOTE- My cake only took 45 minutes in the oven.

I've made this recipe before to the letter, and it's wonderful. I use butter pats on top, not melted butter. Tonight, because one of my guests said she doesn't like overly-sweet desserts, I made it with 1.5 cans of drained tart cherries instead of pie filling.  It was still really good and they LOVED it. I did find that the top of it was on the salty side, though. I served it with vanilla ice cream, which was PERFECT.  Next time I am going to experiment and mix tart cherries with the sweet, gooey pie filling.  Then, I think I'll alternate pats of butter, one stick unsalted, the other stick salted.  I'll let you know how it goes.  THANK YOU FOR THE AWESOME RECIPE!  Oh, and I did leave the coconut out because I am not crazy about it.

I used fresh pineapple because I didn't have any canned. I put thin pats of butter trying to cover every inch of the cake and only needed a stick and a half. I also sprinkled cinnamon on top. Very good.

My mom used to make this all the time. The only thing different was we used Betty Crocker yellow cake mix with the pudding in the mix, and combined the cake mix with the cup of melted butter then crumbled the mixture over the cherry pineapple mix. Ive never used the coconut or nuts, but im not a fan of coconut. Delicious and easy dessert recipe :)

Gret recipe.  After reading the reviews the only the I changed was the butter.  I did not melt it instead I cut it into thin slices and put it on top.  The crust turned out perfect.

Quick and Easy - Great tasting - I lost this recipe (actually a similar one) several years ago - It was great to find it and make it again after so long.   - I did as another reviewer had suggested and added coconut for the last ten minutes so that it would not burn.

Changed this a bit by not using pineapple (husband does not like), and cut down on the margarine by 1/2.  It was wonderful!  I also did what other reviewers suggested and added the pecans and coconut before the cake mix and then reserving some for later in baking to avoid burning.  I think the idea of using the tart cherries would make this even better.  Delish!  I will try using apple pie filling, too!

This is just like the one I remember my mom making us as kids. I asked her and she said the only difference was that she used an 11x7 pan (which would be a good idea for those of you who like thicker cake.) I think I might use only one stick of butter next time, simply to cut out some of the fat, but I'll have to see if it affects the outcome.

Very good recipe! Followed to a tea except used half the butter and just sliced it in pats and put on top. We had it chilled ,think it would be great heated in the microwave with cool whip.

I tried really hard to like this recipe....even tried it twice. It is delicious immediately upon removing from the oven. However, afterwards, it turns to such a mushy mixture that even my 3 year old wouldn't eat it. I'll take any advice on how to fix this so that it stays good past a few hours. Until then, because I've had to throw this out twice, I give it a low rating.

Super easy recipe that's even easier to play with. I was making this for picky kids so I kept it super simple. I used the crushed pineapple, apple pie filing & the yellow cake mix. I only used 1/2 (1 stick) of butter and that was plenty. VERY yum. Look forward to the cherries/pineapple combo for next time!

YUMMY!  I made this for a family get together without trying it first.  It was such a hit.  Everyone loved it.  Most people preferred it without whipped topping.  I used Raspberry filling instead of cherry and it was excellent. Super easy, too! Thanks for a great recipe I will be sure to use again and again.

I know the description said it was more like a cobbler than a cake, but it wasn't even like a cobbler that has a crunchy top, this was just a big pile of goo. I even baked it for ten minutes longer than it called for to see if it would set up at all and nope. The next day...still big pile of goo, had to go in the trash. Even the pile of goo tasted way too sweet and the amount of butter called for was insane. Even cutting it back by half was nuts. Sorry, not a winner for me.

Love this easy recipe.  I cut some of the sugar and use the sugar free cherry pie filling.  It still taste great.  I remember my mom making this when I was a little girl.

This recipe worked well for me and was very like a cobbler.  However, I changed to chocolate cake mix, and drizzled chocolate syrup and sugar on top instead of coconut!  Yummy!

I am absolutely amazed at how delicious this came out.  I had never even heard of "dump" cake before, but I decided to make one for a friend as her birthday gift. Once I had a piece I wished I had made it for myself!  I didn't add the nuts in case people were allergic, and I only added 3/4 cup of melted butter. This is a great cake and I'm planning on making it again tonight!

This is the best dump cake recipe I have ever tried--the coconut and nuts give it a great crunch.  I used pecans and doubled the amount.  It is sweet but really yummy.

The coconut and pecans add a lot to the  plain dump cake recipe you usually see. This really tastes good the next day warmed in the microwave then served with ice cream.  Will add more nuts next time.

The name says it all - - dump the ingredients in the 9X13 pan, and away you go!  I don't melt the butter, I put it on in pats over the yellow cake mix.  This definitely is more of a cobbler than a traditional cake.

Instead of cherries I used applesauce and it was the perfect sweeteness. I did not have coconut on hand but it still was very tasty. Such an easy last minute dessert to make, considering all you are doing is layering each ingredient and putting it in the oven! A keeper !

I had never heard of such a thing until a friend brought one to a cook out. I thought I'd give it a try. Found this recipe and I have to say it's even better than hers. So easy and so good! Try it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream...Yum Yum! I can see me making this quite often. Thanks!

Yum, it is excellent and very easy! 
I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and added the coconut and nuts the last 10 minutes to avoid burning them! 
Thank you!

Oh. My. This is truly beyond, as I sit here shovelling it into my mouth.  I only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter instead of 2 sticks, and it was plenty.  I think I'll try one stick next time.  The other thing is, I'm with the person who recommended adding the coconut toward the end.  Both the coconut and the nuts got a bit burnt, and I ended up picking off quite a bit of it.  Overall though, this is incredible!

I'd forgotten how good a "dump cake" was!!  I'd also forgotten exactly how to make one. This recipe is excellent and oh so easy.  I took it for my bingo table and they all loved it. I served it with real whipped cream.  One of the ladies said she dreaded eating the last bite because it'd be gone!!  I have one in the oven right now, only I'm using blueberries instead of the cherries. Hope it will be as good.  Thanks for sharing!!

Very good. This was a hit at work. I took the advice and melted the butter and mixed with cake mix first. I also put the nuts and coconut under the cake mix mixture. About 10 before done, I sprinkled some nuts and coconut on top. We had it with whipped cream.

Did Not drain the pineapple, just spooned it on top of the pie filling, added half the pecans on top of pineapple.  Sprinkled cake mix evenly over top and spread the remaining pecans on top of that.  Cut one stick (half cup) of butter into pats and placed over top of dish.  Using the pineapple juice helped cut the amount of butter needed to moisten the cake batter.  Baked around an hour til slightly browned.  Perfection.  Crust was still buttery and delicious. With slight modifications this one is a keeper!  Thank you for sharing.

I made some major changes, didn't have a box of yellow cake mix so I made a yellow cake from scratch, didn't add the milk so I was afraid it would be dry, but turned out okay. Took it to a gathering and everyone raved about it.

This is a fabulous dessert and something you can pull out quickly for surprise company or potlucks.  I followed another reviewer' s advice and sliced bananas and drizzled chocolate syrup on mine and it was fantastic, but my sweet-loving husband ate it with just whipped cream and raved about it.  Such a keeper!

I've made this a few times now. It has always been a hit. It is not possible to find an 18.25 oz. cake mix, so I weighed flour in the amount of 9 tablespoons to make up the 3 oz. difference.  When I Googled this weight issue online, that was the solution I found. (Cake mix makers found a way to save some pennies.)  I use only 1/2 C of butter dotted on the top and pecans instead of walnuts. I don't care for the coconut so omitted that.

This is the same recipe  abfelliwbNursery School Mom gave me in the early 1980s.  I had not made it  but found the recipe a couple of weeks ago.  Didn't make any changes.  Very easy!  Taking it to work tomorrow.

Incredibly yummy! I used a gluten free cake mix, organic unsweetened coconut and organic cherry pie filling and pecans.  I got up the next morning and my husband...not a big eater, had eaten over half of it. This recipe will definitely be on our favorites list!

I’ve made this twice; the first time following the recipe, and the second with some changes. It was still good as is, but there was way too much butter.  This time, I replaced half the butter with pineapple juice and it was perfect! I also added an extra can of cherry pie filling, which I’ll continue to do. Super fast, easy and delicious!

So amazingly delicious. We will be making this with blueberry pie filling next time. We used the full cup of melted butter, extra coconut and pecans instead of almonds. This will be our new go-to.

I have made this recipe for years but have always used a chocolate cake mix rather than yellow. They are both delicious!  I usually even sprinkle on some chocolate chips on the chocolate version. So good!

This is a Classic!  Simple and easy to make. 

You cant go wrong making this.. and its hard to mess it up! 

I would use BUTTER instead or margarine.. not a fan of the margarine taste. 

Everyone loves this dessert... hard to pass it up at the table!! 

While its in the oven, your house smells heavenly!!!  Mmmmm

I made this for a cookout last night and it got raves!  So simple and tastes so good!  I omitted the coconut, but I did add a can of drained tart cherries to the pie filling—I love cherries!  I threw this all together in the midst of getting everything else prepped and ready for company.  My house smelled delicious!

I use only 3 ingredients for out of this world Cherry Cobbler-like dessert!   I pour 2 cans of Cherry pie filling in a 9"x13" pan.  Then, I sprinkle a WHITE CAKE MIX all over cherries...& then cut up in slices or small pieces..1 &1/2 sticks of unsalted butter!

I made this gluten free and vegan using a 15oz (smaller) tin of crushed pineapple as it was all I had. I'm stone fruit allergic so the cherries were replaced with blueberries. 
I topped it with Betty Crocker GF white cake mix and poured a cup of (melted) Earth Balance over the top. 
It turned out wonderfully well and was not too sweet either. 
It didn't last long!

It always amazes me how delicious this turns out.  Such a complex and exquisite flavor.  I will keep experimenting with different fruit fillings, but pineapple/cherry will be hard to top.  This easily beats out any pie/crumble/cobbler I've ever had. Update - made this with blueberry filling and pinaeapple.  Doubled the nuts and used 3 sticks of salted butter (melted).  Added a 1/4 cup of oats, .5 tsps salt and  1/4 cup of sugar as well.  50 minutes and it was done.

I have been making this ever since I was a teenager.  I always sliced the butter--NOT margarine--into pats and arranged on top of the cake mix.  This is easier and you get the same results without the hassle of melting the butter.  I like it sometimes with just chopped pecans on top too.  This is also good with apple pie filling, but I do so love the cherry and pineapple combo!

This is DELISH-& I definitely meant to use those caps..its that good! :-) I rolled with no changes save one...I'm a southern pecan girl; I save my walnuts for my banana bread. My sister makes a mean dump cake but this is my first time ever making one. Without a doubt, this is a keeper! I love Maltese Mom's suggestion of apple pie filling with a spice cake mix..that's next on my agenda. Stay tuned..I'll report back in a couple weeks & let y'all know how it turns out. Thanks Barbara & Maltese...my serious sweet tooth thanks you too! ;-)

I followed this recipe and after an hour, the cake is still runny in the middle.  Either there is too much butter or the time needs to be adjusted.  I'm not crazy about nuts, so I subbed in steel cut oats in the cake mix which added a nice crunch.

I've been using this recipe for dump cake for several years. It's delicious. I use two cans of cherries. I don't measure out the coconut or walnuts, I just sprinkle some evenly on top. It's a good summer dessert.  I like that it doesn't need to be refrigerated so it's easy to take to picnics or family gatherings when a long car drive is how you're getting there. It feeds many and tastes like you fussed over it all day for that wickedly good flavor.

I forgot to drain the pineapple and the cake still turned out fantastic!  I was so afraid it would not turn out, but it was perfect.   I took it to a get together and it was very popular.  I left out the coconut and used pecans instead of walnuts.  It was amazing!  From now on I will make it just the same without draining the pineapple.

This is very quick and easy. It's great that it requires virtually no washing or measuring. But you get what you put into it... the canned fruit was overly sweet, and all that butter just coats your mouth. It's convenient but not that tasty.

I love this recipie and I added cherry pie filling and I added butter slices instead of melted butter but it took at least 45-1hr to cook and I still had dried pieces of cake mix throughout.

Easy, good, and quick--my kind of recipe.
I left out the nuts and added more coconut.  Some ate this as if it were a cobbler with milk and sugar. Others used whipped cream or ice cream.  Thanks for sharing.

Thanks Barbara for the recipe.  I have made it a few times now and always get great reviews from anyone who has it. Some general comments:  You can use any kind of pie filling, I don't drain the pineapple, or just drain it  little, and use 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter.  I also use pecans instead of walnuts, just a personal preference.  
This is a simple, fast, yummy recipe!

I love this cake. I don't melt the butter I just cut thin slices and put them on top of the dry cake mix. And I wait until the last 15 minutes or so to put on the nuts (used pecans) and coconut.

I am a complete dessert fanatic and this dessert DID NOT disappoint me one bit--- or anyone else that enjoyed it with me! I served it with vanilla ice cream! mmmmmm sooo good!---- I used sugar free cherry pie filling and it really made no diffetence in the taste but made me feel a lil better about the sugar amount in this recipe.

I had this at a friend's party, and then found the recipe here. I made it for my family and it disappeared ... my in-laws couldn't stop themselves from going back for more, and even my husband really liked it, and he doesn't like anything! Awesome recipe, and an easy one at that!

So delicious!  I followed previous advice and added the coconut and walnuts during the last 10 minutes of baking, and this was perfect!

This is my children's favorite cake.  My 13 year old chose this as her birthday cake.  All of the girls helped to make it and then did crafts as it baked.  We served it warm with vanilla icecream.

It was okay- nothing to write home about.  I am glad that so many other people like it though.  It was fun making it.

It doesn't get any easier and faster than this cake! It is delicious as well! Nice to have a simple, quick cake recipe for those last minute desserts you have to come up with! I did however leave out the coconut and walnuts because my family doesn't like them and it is just as superb!

This was very good! You defintely need ice cream to go with this...it is so sweet! Next time I'll follow a previous reviewer's suggestion and use tart pie cherries instead of pie filling. I also added the nuts and coconut during the last 10 minutes of cooking time. Turned out great!

This was so easy and yummy.  I didn't have any yellow cake mix so I substituted lemon cake mix and almonds instead of walnuts and it has a very light sort of tropical taste - the kids love it.

This is a great recipe! My dad used to make it for us and when we were kids. We would rant and rave over it , my mom  used to spend hours baking
to get that kind of review from us! The good thing about it is if you are missing some of the ingredients you can still make it and it will still be good. You can use one kind of fruit filling or omit the nuts, you can't mess it up. It definitley is RICH so a scoop of vanilla ice cream tops it off great when it comes right out of the oven.

Yummy!  Try it with different fruit fillings and different cake flavors.  It is very rich so whipped cream and vanilla ice cream is totally required.  It really should be under cobbler rather than cake.

Not only was this the easiest cake I have ever made, but, it was absolutely divine.  It lasted about 4 hours with not a morsel remaining!

I've made this for years but never with coconut - very good!  The only thing that I do different is that I slice 2-sticks of butter and place over the cake mix - this allows for the butter to spread more evenly.  My recipe calls for spreading chopped pecans all over the top of the cake - then the butter slices and bake but I personally like it better without the pecans on top.  I have also made using walnuts, apple pie filling sprinkled with cinnamon and its very tasty.  Thanks a lot for the addition!

This has got to be the best dessert on Earth!!  My husband wants me to make it every week because it just doesn't last very long at our house.  The only thing I do differently is I put the coconut on top during the last 5 minutes.  Otherwise it turns black (not very appealing).  We love this Dump cake!!!

I made this cake for our family Easter supper. My mother and sister commented they had never had this recipe with coconut and nuts (I used pecans- turned out great). This is easy and very good..I had none left over..my dad took the rest for himself. My husband also loved it. Very good cake..I recommend you try it..
