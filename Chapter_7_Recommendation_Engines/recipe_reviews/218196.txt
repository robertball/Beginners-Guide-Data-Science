I used the 2 boxes of cornbread mix like others said.  I also added a can of corn (drained) and some black olives to the meat mixture.  To the cornbread I added some chopped green onions, along with the cheese.  Served with a salad.  YUM!!!!

We enjoyed this casserole.  I did  also make some changes as suggested.  I added a can of petite tomatoes without the juice, half a small bag of frozen corn, a can of black beans and after the meat and onions were browned I added a can of Mexican style Campbell's cheddar cheese soup.  I then proceeded with the Jiffy mix topping.  I made it according to the box but I did use 2 boxes for a 3x9 inch pan.  I also used more than a pound of meat.  Half hour on 350 was plenty of time.

My family loved it.  I did double the cornbread, like others, and added corn.  My husband says it's a keeper!

Excellent!  Instead of the jalapenos and spices, I used a can of diced green chilies, a pack of taco seasoning, a can of diced tomatoes, and a can of Mexi-corn.  I prepared the meat mixture the day before and all I had to do was prepare the casserole at dinner time.  It was quick and delicious.  I will be having this again.

Instead of enchilada sauce used 10oz can of chopped tomatoes with jalapenos. I still added the additional chopped Jalapeno to meat mixture. Also used 1/2 teaspoon of roasted, chopped garlic instead of powder and no cumin.Sprinkled 1 cup of Colby Jack cheese on top of meat mixture and added rest to two boxes of muffin mix. Everyone liked it. Will make again!

This was very good.  I added a can of corn and more garlic.  The corn bread was great on top.  Will make again for sure.

I didn't use a 13x9 casserole b/c that would have made the whole thing about an inch thin. I also used (half a can) of tomatoes w/chiles and I subbed chili beans for the black beans and can of enchilada sauce b/c that's all I had. Made it otherwise as per recipe, and put it in a 2.5 qt. round casserole. That was a perfect size. Pretty good, cheap meal. Thanks!

This one's a keeeper!  I didn't have the type of cheese Kraft suggests, so I just used regular shredded cheddar and a couple tablespoons of cream cheese.  But I don't think the cream cheese made much difference.  A great recipe for anyone that loves Tex-Mex and cornbread.

This was really good. I did use 2 boxes of corn muffin mix. I also used 1/2lb of ground beef, 1/2lb of hot bulk sausage, some fresh garlic, pepper jack cheese (since that's all I had) and added olives. I would make again!

I sustituted salsa for the enchilada sauce just because I really dislike enchilada sauce. It tasted really good with the substitution. I baked it in a 9x9 dish. It worked well but I'd recommend baking 40-45 minutes. After 20 minutes the cornbread topping was still pretty raw.

Because I couldn't find an 8 oz. pkg of cornbread mix, I bought 2 ~ 6.5 oz. pkgs of Martha White Country Cornbread Mix and measured out 2 cups of mix.  Had some leftover.  Drained corn, did not reserve/use liquid, added 4 oz. can of green chilies, melted 2 Tbls of real butter in 12" cast iron skillet, poured in mixture, topped with 8 oz of grated Sharp Cheddar and cooked at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.

My kids really enjoyed this dish. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it was just fine, even with the jalepeno. I think that next time I will use two boxes of cornbread mix because I only used one, and I spread it as well as I could, but there was hardly enough to cover the meat.

Delicious! I used chilli beans instead of black beans and omitted the jalapeno (I don't think the kiddo would have liked it). Next time I may try some of the other suggestions of tomatoes and corn.

I took a lot of the reviews of this recipe and adapted them.  I didn't have enchilada sauce.  I had a can of green chili's and added that.  Homemade rotel.  Black olives.  I also used two boxes of cornmeal.  What a fantastic dinner.  I will definitely make this one again.

Yum!  I used 20 ounces of enchilada sauce (2 10 ounce cans) so it would have more sauce when it was reheated and I wouldn't have leftover sauce.

Really really good.  I left out the beans (husband doesn't like them)and added a can of chopped green chilies instead of the jalapeno (I don't like them). Also I made my own cornbread instead of using packaged.  Definite keeper and will make again!!!

Pretty good weeknight dinner.  I had to sub picante sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I don't care much for ground beef casseroles, but this one was ok to me, and wonderful for hubby.  He has asked me to keep things on hand to make this again.  LOVE the cheese baked into the crust.  I didn't use a 9x13 pan, but just used the straight side 10 inch skillet I browned the meat in.

This is a quick, easy dinner for friends and family.  I served it with chopped lettuce, tomatoes and black olives, hot sauce and sour cream.  The only change I made was that I used a vegetarian ground "beef" instead of beef because I was serving some vegetarians.  I got requests for the recipe.

Excellent!!   I used a 7.5 x 9" casserole dish instead of the 9x13 dish.  It did take a bit longer to  bake.  Cornbread was very moist and cheesy and the filling was very tasty.  The next time I'll try salsa instead of the enchilada sauce.

So good! Just made this and it was so quick and easy. I picked a really hot jalapeño so it was delicious and fiery. I think I'll add a can of corn next time.

Delicious! I used 1 lb of hamburger and I had 1 lb of hot ground sausage so I added that. I also used 2 boxes of cornbread and used pepper jack cheese. A little dollop of sour cream when it was finished... Yummy!!

I fixed this tonight for the hubby. We loved it! I always read the comments and made the adjustments as recommended. The only thing I did different was to use a SWEET cornbread mix. I loved the dish!!! We will be having this again!

My husband, daughter and I really liked it... my son not so much.
My husband said "This goes on the list of things to keep making," 
I did double the Muffin mix we all agreed that while it tasted good (to three of us) it was too much and left me wishing I had doubled the meat mix as well. That was my son's problem he didn't like the top so there wasn't enough meat. Next time if I double the topping I'll double the bottom or keep portions as suggested and use a slightly smaller pan.

We liked it - but didn't LOVE it.  In fairness, I substituted a can of rotel tomatoes for the enchilada sauce.  But it wasn't the flavor we didn't like, it was the consistency.  It was basically a loose consistency of ground beef, beans, and tomatoes under the cheesy cornbread topping.  Anyway - hubby liked the beef part - and I loved the cheesy cornbread topping part - so it all got eaten.  I decided to do it all in one pan, so I cooked the beef mixture in a cast iron skillet, then just topped it with the cornbread/cheese topping and threw it in the oven.  Worked perfectly!  The pan was small enough that there was no need to double the cornbread, as others have suggested doing.

The corn bread topping was very dry.  Next time I will add a couple of tablespoons of melted butter, maybe a can of Mexi-corn would be tasty.

I know its unfair to rate a recipe where I have made several changes due to what I had in stock.  I used 7 x 11  casserole.  Substituted  Bush Baked Beans and Salsa, farm cut white cheddar.  It was delish!!!

I took the other reviews advice and used 2 packages of cornbread mis and I wish I didn't. it was still very good but the extra box of cornbread mix made too much cornbread toppi g and took away from the juicinest of the meat mix. Next time I will follow this recipe as written. I found it difficult to spread the cornbread mix over the meat...any suggestions?

This is one of my husbands and five year olds favorite recipes. I use two boxes of cornbread and I just add the cheese on top of the meat mixture. So fast and easy too!

I followed other’s advice and doubled the cornbread. After it was all cooked I think one package of cornbread would have been enough. It was very thick and overwhelming. I think the recipe had great flavor but next

I changed this just a tad to accommodate eating preferences….beef for half and lentils and barley mix for non-meat eaters. I opted for one serrano pepper and also added a  taco seasoning mix pkg  ( half to each ), and canned pinto beans because my man isn't a fan of black beans. I'm sure I doubled the cumin because I always do. I used two 4x6ish foil containers, topped with beans, a bit of cheese, then the cornbread mix. I did add jalapeno slices to the top because we are in Texas.... Baked a bit longer than the recipe.. but BAM! Fantastic!  Will totally do again!!

This has become a go-to casserole for a busy day. It is especially good on a cold night.  I do leave the jalapeno pepper  out, as one of us has issues with hot peppers, but it's still good and filling. Add a salad or heat up some green beans and it's a full meal.

I followed the advice of other reviews and added a can of tomatoes with green chilies instead of the jalapeño, I also used 2 boxes of jiffy mix.  Taste was good but it was a lot of cornbread.  Next time I’ll either use one box but instead of trying to spread it just place small dollops throughout or else I’ll add more to the base mix to even out the base/bread ratio.

Mom went to doctor with "hope you can make the ground beef." So here I am at one of my happy places! I've rated this at its highest just with its ingredients listed as is, but I, like most all of you, want to add 1 or 2 or 10 other items because of our right to try to make it better or just better for you. I'm a foodie and I would eat it if you tried to make it different. Since I'm trying this recipe, I took in all the suggestions. Hey, they sounded good to me. And so I pre-prepared all the veggies and spices and set out to business. Right off the bat, I realized the beef was only half, the other half got used somewhere. Oh well, I can only say i made the best veggies & cot

My husband rated this as a 5. He SELDOM does that! I added a can of diced chilis, which didn't add anything. I have a little bit of frozen corn, which I added, and I used a 19 oz can of enchilada sauce instead of 15. I only used the one box of corn bread mixture and, while it didn't spread well or cover all the meat, it was fine. I was asked to add this to the rotation. ??

This recipe is very tasty! I made the following modifications:
-used ground turkey and after browning prepped it with a low sodium taco seasoning mix
-instead of enchilada sauce I used 15oz Kirkland Organic Salsa
-used 1c cheddar-jack no lactose cheese
-added 1 drained can of corn to the cornbread mix (Jiffy Mix)

Very easy dish...I have it a 4 b/c spreading the cornbread was a task.  I used corn and 2 boxes of corn bread also as previously mentioned. I also put melted butter in the cornbread mix. I didn't have any cumin, like I thought, so had to go without that. I didn't use the jalapeño b/c while my family likes spicy, not jalapeño spicy. Next time, I will use spicy enchilada sauce for a better kick and make sure I have some cumin. Instead of beef, I used turkey.

I made this with the following changes: I used a green pepper instead of a jalapeño because the heat would be too much for my daughter. I also used pinto beans instead of black because I don't like black beans. I used 2 boxes of muffin mix i stead of one. It needed it.  This is a good reminder I personally and my family was happy. The one drawback was that the corn muffin mix made it sweet. We would have liked it better more savory. I think I will make it again but with cornmeal bread from scratch ingredients so I can control the sweetness. Try this recipe!

This is my husbands favorite and I make it probably once a week! We do things a little differently based on personal tastes. Lots of chances to experiment and change things since I make it so often. Instead of the cheese in the corn bread - I put chunks of velveeta into the meat mixture. We like spices so I also sprinkle in a touch of a taco seasoning spice mixture in with the beef. Like others have said - 2 packets of corn bread is a must. Over all this a must try that always makes my family smile.

I thought it was great. I added one can of southwest style corn, and I didn't have cumin so I just used Lawry's seasoned salt - I also added diced green onions to the cornbread. Will definitely make again.

I used my cast iron skillet for a one pan meal. Cooked everything first and then added the corn bread on top and transferred to the oven. I added corn, some red pepper, kept the seeds in the jalapeño and added about a teaspoon of chili powder(I like spicy). I also used two boxes of cornbread and added green onions to the batter. It took about 40 mins for the corn bread to cook all the way through but it was not dray at all. I'm very pleased with this recipe, it was yummy and fun to make.

Excellent!  I didn't have enchilada sauce so I used a can of tomato sauce and a package of taco seasoning with about a half a  cup of water added. I'll make it again with the enchilada sauce next time and see what difference that makes.

It's definitely necessary to double the amount of cornbread mix, but other than that this recipe is dynamite as is! I will make this again and again!

My family loved this. They even ate leftovers the following day which is very rare in my house.  I added extra jalapeno and used spicy pinto beans as well as hot enchilada sauce.  I doubled the corn bread like other reviewers suggested.  Next time i might double the meat mixture as well.
