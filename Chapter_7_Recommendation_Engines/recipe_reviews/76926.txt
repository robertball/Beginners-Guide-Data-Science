You could also brush the unbaked pita pieces with olive oil and then sprinkle with pepper.  Then bake.  Even yummier!  Although, not quite as healthy!

I used a 'Greek' style pita which is pocketless and they turned out great!! I also baked them on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet and when they came out of the oven they were crispy on the outside; warm and soft on the inside. Served with spinach and artichoke dip. Yummy!!

This worked perfectly,and it was exactly what I wanted.  I needed to use up some whole wheat pitas that I bought at the store, so I gave this a go. I actually cut each pita round into 6 triangles and baked with a cooling rack on a cookie sheet.  These little pita chips came out great, and they are a perfect canvas for hummus.  My two year old loves to dip them in veggie spread for an afternoon snack.  Thanks!

I used whole wheat pitas. Other than that, I made no changes. This was a snack for the kids and I for Movie Night. We loved them. I'll make this again. Next time, I'll try this with a brushing of EVOO with garlic powder.

I do this using greek style pitas as well - if I want the pitas chewier I only cook them for 4-6 min. can brush with butter if you want.  Regardless I spray the, with EVOO and sprinkle half with Parmesan cheese and half with pepper - sometimes with some seasoning salt, and bake directly on rack for about 7 min YUM

This worked perfectly. I used homemade pita bread (Peppy's Pita Bread from this site). Simple and tasty. Thanks :)

This is a great treat around the house.  We make different kinds to keep in interesting as well.  Brush some extra virgin olive oil and than sprinkle you favor seasonings to taste as well.  We tend to use more garlic salt or just plain sea salt.  There possibilities are endless!
