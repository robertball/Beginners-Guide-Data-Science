Oh yes!! I have found THE best apple dumplin' recipe ever!! So worth the wait but it is not hard to make! Only thing I did different was I didn't have the packaged pie crusts I used instead the recipe for 'The Best Pie Crust' (and it is!) and put it in a freezer bag in the freezer for only half an hour. Rolled out great! You MUST try this recipe it IS a must!! Thank you!!

Easy, delicious and better than apple pie.  The cinnamon sauce was perfect and by the taste and appearance it looks like you speny hours making it!   I followed the recipe exactly.

These were so yummy! I made them last night for my small group and one of my friends who is a health-obsessed dr. actually ate one and was licking his plate by the time he was done, lol! I did make a few changes:

Okay-here are the things I changed for the recipe-I doubled it to make 16 servings (8 apples), I used the big ones you buy in bulk but if you bought the smaller ones I think you could probably use a whole apple for this-I used granny smith. Also, I cut them in half horizontally then cored then and stuffed the filling inside that way-it was really easy and I didn't have to cut anything off the bottom because I just laid them on their flat sides. I put them on the crust and then I stuffed them so as not to make a huge mess trying to get them onto the crust. I doubled the filling and it used every bit so you could even do more and just pile it in the crust for more of that part-which was the best part, I thought! I made my own crust-way better in my opinion. Also we used 350-I had taken them to my friends house and wanted them to be hot so I baked them there but left the recipe at home so I wasn't sure on the temperature-I did the 425 for 10 minutes and then 350 for 20 minutes- but I thought they were done enough-I had eight of them on a pampered chef stone and 8 on a metal air bake cookie sheet. The ones on the stone turned out even better so I would probably use that again or if you used a metal dish or baking sheet, maybe reduce the cooking time. The ones on the met

Great recipe.  Definitely use small apples though, wrapping them was a bit difficult.  Not impossible, just difficult.  I sliced mine in half horizontally instead of vertically which made them stand up nice and straight with no problem.  Also gave me a nice well to put filling in without any fuss.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, then toasted some peacans to add to my sauce - just because I like them.

Mmmm-mm! Yummy recipe. My husband even really liked these and he's usually a chocolate only kinda guy. I do want to note, since I was stumped on this for awhile, that the apples need to be sliced horizontally for it all to make sense. You're essentially stuffing the core of the halved apple with yumminess. I also cut the water to 1/2 cup on hearing the sauce was a bit watery.  Excellent dumpings.

These were absolutely delicious, and the sauce was so fast and easy to prepare. I made half with Gala and half with Granny Smith, and the tartness of the Granny's was far better. It balanced the sweetness of the rest of the ingredients. I served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream--pure bliss!

I used the method for making the dumplings of enclosing the apple 1/4's in crescent rolls with this sauce.  This will definately be my 'go to' sauce for dumplings in the future

I love Pam Anderson's recipes and this one does not disappoint! I don't even like apples and this is one of my new favorite desserts. Certainly I would like about 1/3 more pie crust. I used a 15 ounce (2 sheets) pie crust and it was stretched thin in some places, thin enough that when I tried to move the dumplings to a serving dish, some of them "ripped" and fell apart. Of course, homemade crust is always going to be better if you have the time. Also, I used buttered foil and my dumplings still stuck to the bottom of the dish so you might want to cook them in the serving dish or use the parchment. If you want a richer caramel cinnamon sauce, omit 1/2 cup of the water and replace with heavy cream. It takes the sauce from great to unbelievable.

Very good. Omitted the nuts (due to allergy). Poured syrup over the dumpling in a bowl and made homemade pie crust recipe. Will definately make again.

Turned out beautifully, and was pretty easy to make.I did end up making my own crusts though as my local store does not carry ready made pie sheets.The sauce in my opinion could have been slightly thicker, but the dumplings were still a big hit.I put home made vanilla icecream on the side to finish it off.

I used 9 inch pie crust and it was enough - However I may have used to big of apples - The apples started standing up when I began baking and 10 minutes later the fell over.  They still tasted great - smell great - I would definetly try it again!

Holy cow this recipe is amazing! Smells great while they cook and tastes even better! Definitely a little more flavorful than your typical apple dumpling recipe! I made my own pie crusts and I highly suggest making your own since it will probably come out flakier.

Very good! I think the dough/apple ratio is a little off in this recipe. One pie crust BARELY did four apple halves at my house. Also, be sure not to wrap your apples too tightly (like I did) because the apples will blow a little when they cook. The cinnamon sauce was perfect for me, not too icky-sweet. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was delicious. I rated 4 out of 5 only because I like home made cooking.  I never use store bought or box baking anything.  I made my pie crust from scratch and the family loved it.  Thank you so much.

So easy to make and delicious.  I used 1 apple and 1 pack of crescent rolls.  I cut down on the butter by 2 tablespoons and I used a combo of white sugar and brown sugar with vanilla and cinnamon.  Will make again.

This was a great recipe. You have to use your judgment on the size of the apples. Mine were too large to use a half so I cut them down a bit. Also I forgot to turn down the temperature from 425 and they got extra brown but they still tasted amazing.

OMG, these are amazing! I don't like crust on pies, I usually just eat the filling, but the crust so works with this! Use Granny Smith apples for sure. Follow the recipe exactly, it's perfect. And it was very easy to make-this coming from someone who does not like to bake. My step-son called me, after coming over just to get leftovers, about how amazing these are. Do you know how rare that is?!? LOL Fiance loved them as well, they were the "best apple dumplings he's ever had." You have to try this recipe, period.

The best apple dumplings I have ever tasted! I added a teaspoon more cornstarch to the cinnamon than the recipe called for but otherwise they were very good. I used a mix of Cortland and Jonagold apples too.  P.S.  I am only 9, but I love to cook!! (Tricia's 9 year old son)

I generally like Pam Anderson's recipes (I have one of her cookbooks and have liked every dish I've tried from it), but this was just so-so for me. Luckily my mom and dad LOVED this, so I at least feel good about that. :) If given the choice, I'd much rather have apple pie - simple, basic apple pie just tastes better (and is MUCH easier to assemble), IMHO. The second turnoff for me was the addition of nuts in this. I did not care for them at all. They kinda seemed out of place (but that's just my $.02). The biggest letdown for me was the sauce. It simply lacked oomph. The sauce tasted bland and was oddly thick, but not in a sticky or syrupy sort of way (if that makes any sense). Don't get me wrong. This wasn't terrible. It just wasn't for me. Better luck for everyone else, I guess. Thanks anyways, Pam! :-)

Made this recipe tonight and followed it exactly and it is AMAZING... only thing different was I put toothpicks in the top of it so they would stay together. Some of them did end up exploding out of the sides but as I always say, the messier the food is, the better it will taste. Definitely will make this again! And the cinnamon sauce is just perfect!

Very yummy and simple to make. The only problem I had (which was caused by me and not the recipe) was stretching/rolling the pie crust enough without breaking it. The pieces ended up not being big enough to accommodate the entire 1/2 apple but i just wrapped them up as best I could. Fortunately, it didn't affect the outcome...the were still delicious!

This is the best recipe for apple dumplings. I have never tried making dumplings before but after all the great reviews I decided to try to make them. I am very glad I did. I omitted the walnuts because my son is allergic .This dessert was all eaten the very night I cooked them. I will be making this in the future. My family now has a new favorite dessert.

My family loved these and the ingredients and prep was simple.  Need to go light on the syrup or it may be to sweet. I didn't sprinkle sugar on top before baking and it was plenty sweet. I used refrigerated pie crusts and had a hard time tring to wrap the apples.  I even used small apples.  Not able to form squares from the round crusts.  Maybe if I make the crust from scratch it will be easier and maybe more attractive.  There were some pictures of some nice looking dumplings on the site.

Good recipe. I used this in my Foods 1 class and my students really enjoyed them. It was difficult to wrap the apples. My students were thinking though they decided to cut their apples up. I had them make the pastry from scratch so that was also a factor. I will definitely use this again in my class.

To quote my son, "I've died and gone to Heaven!"  These were fabulous!! We really loved them! The sauce was just the right touch and with a scoop of ice cream.....WOW!!  I ended up brushing them with a beaten WHOLE egg instead of egg white.  I forgot to take out the yolk and it didn't make that much of a difference.  Other than that, I followed it exactly, which is really rare for me!

Perfect in every way.  They look gorgeous plated and taste exceptional.  I particularly love the way the sauce compliments the dumplings.  The sugared crust is so attractive.  I used Cortland apples.

I used a 9x13 pan to bake 4 apples and it affected the baking. Thirty minutes total time was not enough to soften the small Acey Mac apples I used. (It DOES tell you to use a 18x12 pan, but I didn't have that size.) Despite that, I think the sugar/butter/cinnamon was just the right amount of flavor. I made my own dough, eliminated the nuts, and didn't bother with the sauce. I like the taste of the apples to dominate instead and they are definately delicious enough without the sauce. I will definately try this recipe again. Just don't make them in a 9x13 cake pan!

Awesome!  Added a little bit of nutmeg to the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture in the apple.  Also reduced the water to 1/2 a cup for the sauce.  Best if you use small to medium-sized apples for this.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I haven't reviewed anything before--I usually just lurk about the site and snatch a recipe here and there from time to time--but this recipe has become one of my all time favorites after making it several times and I feel it deserves a good review. Everyone who tries them loves them and they always come out so good. 
I do things a little differently for my preferences, and I'll share those things, but for the most part I stick to this recipe and it's been gold.
For one, I don't use whole apple halves. I prefer a smaller dumpling, made with small chopped pieces of apple instead a large slice. I think it makes it more pleasant for eating and helps the sugar, cinnamon and butter mix more evenly (which I just put a spoonful of on top of the apple pieces before wrapping the dumpling up). I strongly recommenced a flavorful, sweet-tart apple for baking, also. Otherwise, it comes out kind of bland and so-so. My grandmother's Jonathan apple tree always makes the best baking apples.
For two, I love to make my own butter crust, because it's so simple and always comes out just right--store bought crusts never do it for me. I'm sure there's one out there I don't know about that comes out perfect, golden and flaky, too. But I love a homemade crust. 
Other than that, and a little extra cinnamon everywhere and some vanilla in the sauce, I don't change anything. And this recipe always comes out perfect, every time, like magic, and ready to impress.

I just made these and I can tell you, they were easy and I enjoyed them much more than apple pie!  I give them 5 stars. I used a 3" deep cast iron skillet and covered it with the cast iron lid that goes with it as I do not own a parchment covered dish.I also baked it at 390 the entire time as my oven digital number 4 doesn't work, needless to say they turned out awesome! I used my own butter pie crust recipe too as it really isn't much faster having ready made not to mention, homeade doesn't have any preservatives!

Awesome! I made a mistake and mixed all the butter, sugar & nuts together and put them in the shell with the apple. I cooked it and served it without the sauce 'cause I didnt need any more calories. Even better the next day :)

Perfect apple dumpling!  Don't skip toasting the walnuts.  Combined with the soft apple and flakey pastry, it's a delicious and impressive dessert.  Serve with a scoop of ice cream and enjoy!

These were amazing! My family absolutely loved them. I used freshly picked apples and instead of buying the container of pie crusts like the recipe calles for, I made the Buttter Flakey Pie Crust and wrapped 5 entire small apples (peeled cored, and cut into 2 halves). I had a little bit of trouble getting the apples wrapped but that was because of my changes and I was able to eventually cover them. A warning though, on two of the dumplings, somehow the pastry must have ripped while bking because whaen I took them out, the filling had spilled out onto the pan. On these two, the apples did not have as much flavor on the inside and were not as good as the others.

EXCELLENT - I tried a recipe that used cresent rolls - don't waste your time - no comparison to using REAL pie crust.  These were great - only thing I didn't do was put nuts on top.

Excellent authentic apple dumplings. Don't settle for that popular recipe calling for Crescent Rolls and Mountain Dew. This is the real deal and blows away that recipe. A slightly tart apple (like Granny Smith) provides a nice balance to the sweet sauce and filling. Yum!

Excellent recipe. I used my standard pie crust recipe and granny smith apples and it turned out great. The sauce is incredible and I hope others do not miss out on enjoying this amazingly easy sauce. I love apple pie, but this beats it. It also reheats well the next day in the microwave for about a minute.

This was the easiest apple dumpling recipe I have ever tried.I didn't change anything in the recipe except it was hot and we were short on time so I used Hershey's caramel syrup instead of standing over the hot saucepan to make my own.It was great as it was so I can't wait to try it with the homemade sauce.I will definitely make these again.

This was pretty easy to make even though it looks like it would take you hours. I ran into the same problem as SunnyByrd, I struggled to fit my apples on my pastry dough so I was forced to wrap them a little tighter than I would have wanted to.  Mine blew open a little bit while they were baking but nothing major. My kids helped make these with me , so it's kid friendly.  I peeled the apples and they stuffed them. I didn't cut the bottoms and they did waddle a little bit.  Next time I'll cut the bottoms so that they sit better and I will use 3 apple halves to 1 sheet of pie crust pastry so that they aren't so tightly wrapped.  I used Granny Smith apples and I'm so glad I did. They held up really well and the tartness of the apples  countered any of the super sweetness of this yummy dessert.

This was really good, but it was a lot of work and the end result didn't WOW me like I would have hoped for the effort. Don't get me wrong, it was yummy, but if I'm going to make such a mess for a recipe, my expectations get WAY up there, and this just didn't make me wanna get up and dance or anything!

Absolutely delicious!  Made them with crescent rolls, Granny Smith apples and got rave reviews for Thanksgiving.  This will be a standard & will take over apple pie.

Excellent!  For the taste, it is really an easy recipe to put together.  I did double the amount of filling though and heaped it into the apple, on top and let it spill over a little into the crust.
The sauce was good but I like to melt real caramel down with cream to put over top.  My husband said this was "outstanding" and that's a hard compliment to come by from him.
**Update** I made this again and used light brown sugar instead of dark...I don't recommend doing that.  It was good but not as rich in flavor as it was with the dark brown sugar!

These apple dumplings came out excellent. The first time I make a recipe, I like to make it exactly as specified, without any changes so that I can give it a fair review. The only change I might make next time would be to leave out the nuts because my son does not like them. I think this recipe would be just as good with or without the pecans. At first,  I thought the sauce wasn't going to be sweet enough but when added to the dumpling it is just right. If I had added sugar it would have been way to sweet. My husband said this is one of the best desserts he has ever had and that it was better then any restaurant. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is amazing! I've made this recipe two days in a row because they went so fast - I served it in cute little dishes with ice cream and instead of making the sauce I bought caramel sauce - for anyone who makes this - follow this recipe exactly!

Let me tell you, this recipe is a **winner**.  I'm from Ohio and there is a meat market where you can purchase the frozen dumplings and sauce to make at home and when my parents fly here (California) they bring them with...several packs because I've never seen a recipe that duplicates them.  This is it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I feel like this is a taste of home.

I made my own crust, I didn't add butter due to lactose issues haha. But the rest followed perfectly! Instead of the sauce I just sprinkled a cinnamon, brown sugar, and white sugar mix over the dumplings then baked them! Yum yumm will defiantly make again

Instructions and recipe for the dumplings were very good, used Best Ever Pie Crust from this site. For me, the proportion s on the sauce were a bit off, and it tasted a bit watery, I adjusted with 2 addtnl TBS of butter, and an additional C of brown sugar, also added a pinch of salt.  Thanks for the recipe..

These were delicious!  Deceptively simple, too, although mine weren't picture-perfect.  I'll blame that on the three year-old rolling the dough.  This will become a new go-to dessert recipe in my house!  Thanks.

I'm making these now, and as I peeked in the oven to check on them, a few of the dumpling's filling spilled out onto the pan.  I'm sure it will be a messy goodness, but not what I expected. I followed the recipe exactly, sealing with egg white, and the mess is spilling from the bottom.  I don't know what would be the cause, but maybe when I try again it will be all in one piece.

Sorry, I did not like this recipe. It was more of a pain than other recipes I have used. The cornstarch in the sauce made the sauce gluggy. I prefer recipes that produce a sauce in the cooking pan while the apples cook.

This recipe was very good and quite easy to make and even though I liked the sauce, I felt it was missing....something.  I thought maybe it wasn't thick enough so I added a little more cornstarch which didn't fix things.  I did not slice the apples in half- instead I cored them and left them whole and it worked well.  I used more nuts, about 1/2 cup, and 5 tablespoons of butter for the center of the apples.

This was awesome!  I added a few fresh blackberries that needed to be used, and they just melted in wonderfully!  I may have cooked a little long because the sauce caramelized on the outside a little to much, but my fiance thought it only added to the overall dish.  I WILL be making this again!

I thought this was very good.  I shared the dumplings with several people and they all agreed that they were good.  My apple were so big I had to double the crust.  Ended up with 16 dumplings.  The sauce made the dumplings.
