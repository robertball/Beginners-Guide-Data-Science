Great and easy recipe. I cut the recipe in half, only used the hamburger, cooked it in a 9x13 pan and it was still enough for our family of four. All of the flavor of stuffed peppers with less work.

Loved this dish! My son and husband went back for thirds - it was that good! I hate it when people change the recipe and then rate their new version, but I'm going to do it anyway, because I don't think I really changed the integrity of the recipe - but you decide. I wanted a richer tomato flavor for the topping so I used tomato sauce instead. And I used 3 cups of cooked rice. That was it - just a matter of preference. This one's a keeper, however you make it.

Great kid and picky eater friendly recipe. Easy to make and not easy to mess up. 
I didn't have Italian sausage, so I used breakfast sausage. This was still very yummy. 
Also, I would highly suggest cutting in half or at least down by a third. I served this to 4 girls ages 10 to 16 and myself and still had leftovers, and I cut the recipe down to half. 
One change: I would suggest using more rice.

Very forgiving. I messed up and added a whole can of water to the soup topping.  No problem.  The boys say this is good and please make again.  And in case anyone is wondering, I used frozen green pepper (summer garden abundance) and it was good!

used 3 cans tomato sauce--no soup, one can diced tomatoes, chopped red and yellow pepper--no green.  Put cheese on last 10 minutes.  Didn't get to take any in for my lunch because it was all gone!

Delicious! Tastes exactly like a stuffed pepper. My husband doesn't like stuffed peppers - he says there is way too much pepper. He loved it! The only thing I did was added extra rice (our preference), but it would have been just as great with the recommended amount.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I make it for dinner at home, as well as for family and church pitch-ins! The only part if this recipe that I have changed up is substituting a large jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce for the tomato paste and crushed tomatoes. It saves me time!

The family loved this! I only changed a few things to meet our liking. I added one fresh jalapeno, chopped, and grated zucchini. I omitted the two cans of tomato soup and can of tomato paste due to the amount of water the zucchini created. It turned out perfect! No "soupiness" to it at all and still left with a satisfying amount of tomato flavor. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

My husband and I love this recipe, and I make it often. Because it's just the two of us, I cut the recipe in half except for the rice. However, instead of the rice, I stir in 1 package of cooked riced cauliflower. My husband, who doesn't like cooked cauliflower, has never noticed!

I loved this recipe, family loved the recipe! It made a lot, hubby has been using left overs as a dip with corn chips. I will make this again & again & again. I love stuffed peppers just not the whole big pepper part & this solves that problem deliciously! Thank you for sharing rebeccahayden87!

Pretty decent.  I will make it again with the following modifications:  more diced peppers, less or no canned soup (felt like it added a lot of salt), and more diced tomatoes.

I cooked it off for a week's worth of lunches at work.  Everyone commented how good it smelled.  It is a great basic spin on stuffed peppers that can be adjusted easily for personal taste.

Very good! My husband loved it & so did I. Just one cup of water for the tomato soup is good though. 2 cups as called for on the can is too much.

OMG Looks way better than the picture and tastes absolutely fantastic!! I did add 1 packet of dried onion soup. Also, there is only 2 of us, so I divided it in 1/2 and froze 1/2.

Absolutely delicious. Made some minor changes- 1 -14oz petite diced tomatoes and 1-14oz can crushed tomatoes instead of all diced. Used 1 lb beef and 1/2 lb sausage, and increased rice. Was wonderful and enjoyed by whole family. Mine needed bit longer baking at about 40 minutes.  Will make again for sure!

Based on other reviews, I cut down on most ingredients - used 1.5 pounds of ground turkey, 2 large peppers, 1/2 an onion, 1 can petite diced tomatoes.  Used 1.5 cups of uncooked rice, lots of worcestershire and most of a 19 ounce can of Progresso tomato basil soup (omitted the water).  This filled up a 9x13 baking dish, fed a family of 4 and still had leftovers.  Husband had 4 helpings!  That never happens!  Thanks for a great, easy, yummy recipe!

This was a big hit at my house with both my husband and my 1 year-old. They both cleaned their plates and had seconds. My son actually ate three bowls of this the first time I served it. Winner!
I liked it, too, although it's definitely more of a mild-tasting crowd pleaser than a unique and unusual taste. It's simpler than stuffing peppers, though, and fulfills the same craving.
Although I haven't tried it, I suspect it would freeze well, which is another plus in my book.

I used a jar of spaghetti sauce in the mixture and topped it with a can of v8 for convenience. I also used 2 cups of rice. With those changes, this was the best stuffed pepper casserole that I've ever made!

The only thing I did was to add more green pepper.  I actually forgot to add the cheese and it was delicious without it too! I did add cheese on top to the leftovers.  Very good as a leftover too!!

It was awesome  - VERY filling!  I added a large dash of paprika (my husbands adds a dash to every recipe) and I didn't have condensed tomato soup but I did have Trader Joes Tomato Organic Roasted Red Pepper Soup and gave it a good pour over the top.   I also didn't have green peppers - used my red, yellow and orange.   I think the green would have been good but ALL green would be really bitter.  I liked the mix.  Made so much I froze 1/2. and have another meal for a family of four to go.  Thanks for sharing!

I made no changes.  I should have cooked it a little longer.  Was kind of soupy. Buttt overall it’s very good. Took me a lot more time to cook though without any food processor. Also I didn’t have a Dutch oven but did have a big deep skillet.  When I placed in baking dish I bet it weighed over 5 pounds.  It was delicious

My husband loved it. He said it’s versatile. You can put leftovers on spaghetti. Use it on pizza dough. Add beans and a little heat, and it turns into chili.

So yummy!! I added shredded cauliflower in place of rice for a 'paleo' version.  There was plenty to share with friends and family.

Anything that starts with sauteed peppers, onions and garlic draws attention at my house. This was a good tasting variation of a stuffed green pepper. Everyone who tried it agreed. My daughter grabbed a bag of corn chips and used it as a dip. I ate it right off the plate. I doubled the recipe and thought it needed a little more spice so I will tweek it and try it again.

I made the recipe as stated except I doubled the rice. It made enough to feed my family of 5 including 2 teenage sons with about 1/3 left over. For me it was very (almost too) tomato-y, but my family loved it. My son just walked back to the kitchen for thirds, & my husband said it was so good he could just keep eating it. I may cut the tomatoes by using one can of diced tomatoes & topping with one can of soup next time - just my preference. My husband & kids wouldn't change a thing and definitely want me to make it again! Thank you for sharing.

Awesome just the way it is!  I’m generous with the spices.  I’ve also substituted tomato sauce when I didn’t have soup.  I’ve also used all hamburger when it was what I had on hand.  I’ve also used more rice as necessary.  Hubby likes for me to put his in a green pepper, so I stick a couple in the corner of the pan and fill.

The flavor was wonderful.  I will add another cup to cup and a half of rice next time though to thicken it up a bit.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe as written and thought it had good flavor, but am not a real fan of sausage, so I think I will just double the beef next time.
