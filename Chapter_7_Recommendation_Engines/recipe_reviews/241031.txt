I appreciate the warning about the adobo seasoning. I do use adobo, but sparingly as it is laden w/ sodium. I couldn't see myself adding more (salt) to the steak - for a quick steak this was easy, but lacked a wow factor for me.

I'm very happy with this. Honestly it's my new favorite way to make steak, and even when I overcook it to medium-well, it's still super tender and flavorful. It might not have a crazy twist or be complex, but it's still delicious!

Made it for my family and they loved it. I used the Adobo seasoning recipe since I didnâ€™t have any on hand and used less salt than called for.  Good and easy recipe.

Sort of bland, I've lived in Argentina and am looking for a spicier recipe.

Awesome recipe. Tasted great and will definitely make again. Used "Traci's Adobo seasoning". Made extra to try on different meats.

I made it with Chimichurri sauce for flavor.  Try that next time.
