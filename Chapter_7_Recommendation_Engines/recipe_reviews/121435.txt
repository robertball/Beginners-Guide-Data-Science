I just made the pancakes but not the fruit topping.  The pancake recipe alone is wonderful!  To make the pancakes "fluffier", I added the tsp of baking soda to the buttermilk and set it aside for a bit while I got everything else ready.  This really made the pancakes rise wonderfully and they were light & fluffy!  This will be our standard pancake recipe from now on!!

Well,I'm not sure it's fair for me to rate this but I'm going to anyway. I only used this recipe for the fruit topping. What a brilliant idea. I love to eat plain yogurt with granola and with the addition of this fruit topping it is so yummy! I don't put the bananas in it though and I use unsweetened frozen berry mix with pineapple and the brown sugar. I then put it in a glass jar and into the fridge and then I have a nice supply of a very healthy and yummy snack! Thank for such a brilliant idea....and so simple too!

This is my new favorite pancake recipe.  Both pancakes and topping are wonderful.  Pancakes had great flavor and texture but as someone else mentioned, batter is very thick.  I found that re-stirring the batter before cooking eliminated that problem.  For the topping, I didn't have raspberries but used canned strawberries in their place and the topping turned out unbeliveably good.

This was agood recipe.  I only made the pancakes and they turned out great.  The bater was not too thick or thin.  I did let the batter sit about 10 minutes while I finished getting ready for the day.  I used a pancake baker and they did not burn.  they were fluffy and the flavor was nice and smooth.  These stayed with us longer than other recipes or box mixes do.  I doubled the recipe and it made 16 8 inch pancakes.  They don't have the bitter taste that other recipes have and the don't fall apart either.  I asked my DH and he said they were good.  Our boys went for seconds.  Thanks for the recipe I will make this again over and over.

I followed the recipe exact, only cutting the topping in half and I only used less than a quarter cup of brown sugar. My husband wasn't hip on the topping but he thought the pancakes were perfect. And my kids? We'll, they thought the whole thing was great! I squirted a little whipped topping on the top and my oldest boy was so thrilled with that, because he remembers getting fruit topped pancakes at Sheri's with whipped topping on the top. I liked this whole idea, but next time when I make the topping, I'll use all berries. It's not the recipe's issue, it's just personal choice.

Oh my... I didn't think any other pancake would top the "TRUCK STOP" pancakes on this site.  Good gravy, this one did!!! Fluffy, stick-to-your-ribs goodness.  (Didn't make the fruit topping)  This will be my Number 1 Pancake recipe, and "Truck Stop" will be my second.

I'll never buy bisquick again. I never knew it would be this easy to make truly "homemade" pancakes. I had no buttermilk so I added 2 tablespoons of vinegar to 2 cups of milk. I prepared a hot apple topping with fresh sliced apples with cinnamon and butter that I cooked til tender quickly with the microwave and topped with cool whip - my husband was impressed.

Watch out. These burn before the middles are done if cooked on too high a heat. This recipe halves nicely.  The batter is thick.  The only change I made was separating the egg.  I added the yolk in with the wet ingredients & whipped the white to a soft peak. I then combined the wet & the dry. Lastly, I folded in the whipped egg white. These tasted & looked very nice.  I will definatley make these again.  I didn't make the fruit sauce.  Just topped mine with butter & syrup. Yum.

I made the pancakes only, not the topping.  The only change I made was using all winter wheat flour (no AP flour) and added a bit of cinnamon.  Came out light and wonderful and a bit more nutritous!

I love this recipe, and never again will I buy the store bought pancake mix! I added the baking soda to the buttermilk as one reviewer suggested, but I am fairly sure that if you mix everything together and let it rest for a half an hour, you'd have the same results. Six of one, half a dozen of the other :). Thanks for the great recipe!

The pancake recipe is great.  My family said these were the best pancakes they ever had.  They did not love the fruit topping.  I liked it though!  I probably won't make the topping for just myself.
The pancake recipe will be a staple in our household!  The search for the best one is over!  
also sidenote-it is best to stir the batter occassionally when cooking the cakes to decrease the "puffiness" of the batter.

Actually, I just made the fruit sauce and used in on waffles.  The fruit sauce was yummy!  Had it warm on the waffles and just had it cold on ice cream.  I made it with unsweetened raspberries so ended up adding some orange juice to get it to blend.

Delicious! I used strawberries instead of raspberries in the sauce and it tasted like a banana split. The pancakes were light and fluffy and very easy to make. A keeper for sure.

I didn't have the fruit for the topping, but made the pancake recipe this morning.  WOW!  These pancakes rock.  The only thing I should have done was scaled it down for my husband, daughter and I, because we ended up with about 18 pancakes.. to which half of it I added blueberries.  Awesome recipe!

The best pancake I've ever made.  I've tried a plethora of recipes looking for the right pancake.  This one is light and flavorful.  It's simply perfect in every way.  

The only cooking note is that I tried this as both large (5-6") and small (3") pancakes.  The large ones come out better...the texture is preferable.  Nevertheless, it's good either way.  Also, I did it without the fruit topping and instead made a honey cinnamon syrup that I got from another recipe...it'll send you to heaven!

I am not a huge pancake fan, but tried these for a quick dinner one night.  I made just the pancakes and they were wonderful!  Not the belly dragging heavy ones our mothers made but light and fluffy, like a cross between a pancake and a crepe.  I did not follow the directions but blended the wet ingredients and then stirred in the baking soda and powder followed by the salt and flour.  The batter was nice and foamy, not too thick or thin.  The pancakes cooked up with no problems and were good enough that hubby and our 15 month old tasted them plain!  I did add a pinch more sugar and vanilla but I like things sweet.  We are making them again tomorrow morning!

I'm surprised to read that others had a problem with the batter being to thick.  My batter was so runny that I could barely make pancakes at all.  The pancakes were super thin and strange.  But they tasted awesome.  I'm thinking that maybe I did something wrong...  I'll definitely try them again because we loved the flavor.  Hopefully they turn out better next time.

These were great. I only made them because I had some buttermilk I needed to use, Iended up being plesantly surprised. I added baking soda to the buttermilk like someone suggested. I didn't make the fruit topping but I did add fresh strawberries while they cooked. I'll make a point to buy buttermilk more often so we can eat them again.

I just made the pancakes, not the fruit topping.  They were excellent - light and fluffy.  I made some with blueberries, to.  I sprinkled blueberries over the batter in the pan and pushed them into the batter.  I mixed the buttermilk and the baking soda before adding the buttermilk to the other liquids.  If you do this, make sure you use a large container.  I added the baking soda to the buttermilk in a 2 cup pyrex container, and I had to transfer it quickly before it bubbled over.  Next time, I will measure the buttermilk into a 4 cup container before I add the baking soda.  These were the best pancakes I have ever had.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made the pancakes without the fruit topping. I cooked the pancakes on a griddle, pre-heated to 375 degrees, and put blueberries in the batter. The pancakes were served with cinnamon, butter, and maple syrup--the entire family enjoyed them.

This tasted like a normal pancake recipe to me.  (I didn't make the sauce, so I'm not reviewing that.)  It was good, but nothing to write home about.

Excellent! This is the best pancake recipe I have found. But I leave the fruit whole, and I cook the fruit in pineapple juice and thicken with corn starch. The kids loved them.

My family was snowed in and I was out of pancake mix.I made this recipe,only I cut the sugar amount in half and I didn't make the fruit mix.Instead we put maple syrup on them.My Nephew Jarrett and Grandson Cody said these pancakes were the best I ever made.They were cheering that my pancakes were awesome.They are my best critics.I will never buy pancake mix again!

These pancakes were great! I didn't do the fruit topping and made a few recipe changes:  used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose; used 1/8c cinnamon applesauce and 1/8c canola oil for the vegetable oil.  For the kids, I sprinkled some mini chocolate chips on the pancakes right after I poured them on the griddle. We froze a bunch, separated by parchment paper, and they reheat well, too. A real keeper!

Fruit topping is more like a homemade jam. We loved it!

These were very yummy pancakes!  I didn't have any raspberries so I used blueberries instead.  I wasn't too crazy about the sauce.  It tasted good, but almost too bananaey (is that a word?).  It also came out kind of foamy-maybe I mixed it too long.  The only other change that I did was to sub 1/4 of a cup of vanilla coffee creamer as I didn't have enough milk.  These will definately made again, but will probably use a different fruit syrup or regular maple.  Awesome pancakes, though!
