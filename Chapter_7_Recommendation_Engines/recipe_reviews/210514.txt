This is really good however my family can't handle a lot of spice so I made some adjustments for their tastes and mine.   I didn't have fresh ginger or garlic so I just added some vegetable oil to the salt, 1 teaspoon of ginger powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic powder.  Just put it all in the pan and stir so you don't have raw chicken all over your hands; it works just as well.  I didn't have shredded coconut but I had coconut milk so I used around 1/2 a can and just didn't use the water and heavy cream.  I prefer to use greek yogurt when cooking indian food but that is just my personal preference  I also added 1 teaspoon of Garam Masala and did not add the chile peppers.    This gave the recipe a much more subtle flavor which I enjoyed  I put frozen peas in it for a vegetable and served it over rice.

This is an amazing Indian chicken recipe that will ''live'' with my family from now on. The sauce reminds me of an amazing vegetable dish that I had in my local Indian restaurant. I had only 4 chile peppers and the hotness was just right for us. The instruction doesn't say at what point you must add coconut, so I added at the end with cream and I used only 1/2 cup coconut. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe.

A truly Delicious and fresh tasting curry.  Huge compliments from my honey who enjoyed it and commended it. I made some big tweaks to the recipe here as My inclination was to layer flavor more deeply.  I used mostly boneless chicken breast (a full pack), a few drumsticks and 1 thigh.  I marinaded the chicken twice.  Before starting with the recipe instructions I marinated first in the juice of 1 home-grown lemon, salt, cumin, coriander, asferitida, pepper and garlic powder.  That sat for about an hour or 2.  Then I did the garlic/ginger paste marinade in a bag for about 4 hours adding more cumin, coriander, pepper, salt.  I used store bought garlic and ginger pastes. To the yoghurt (half a container of lebne style and a scoop of Greek ). I prepped the yogurt mixture in the morning to use for dinner. I added the recommended but kept adding everything to taste as I went. I went most heavy with cumin and garlic powder as I also made the suggested "jeera rice" to go with. I also went ahead and added some coconut to the Yougurt. I added more coconut when I added the mint leaf/coriander "pesto" mixture I made. Due to counter space and time, I created that pesto in my nutribullet and added a small scoop of the yogurt mixture and some smoked extra virgin olive oil.   This time I went sans the heavy cream to keep it lighter. Will try with it down the line for sure. We are SUPER happy with this recipe.
