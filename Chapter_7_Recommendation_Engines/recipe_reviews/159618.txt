I just used rainbow chard and red peppers, and stir-fried it with the Quick Cantonese Sauce on this site.  It was really good!

I've been making green juice, so when I found this recipe, I decided to modify it for juicing. First, I reduced the recipe to half to produce one glass of juice.  Omit the oil, salt and sauce.  Here goes: kale, rainbow chard, bell pepper, leek.  I added 1/2 cucumber, 1/2 red apple, and one jalapeno.  The apple & jalapeno produce the sweet & spicy effect.
