Quick and easy - just as the submitter states! It's also very good and a life saver when you realize you're out of tartar sauce! It's also much better so I don't think I'll be getting the store bought stuff anymore. I cut the recipe in half and used Hellman's light mayo combined with a bit of light sour cream to make it a little creamier along with some finely chopped green onion as it's very mild. All it needed was a bit of dill to punch it up.  It was perfect over beer battered fish filet sandwiches!

I loved this tartar sauce.  I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise and added a little dill.  I also used green onion instead of regular white onion.  Yummy Yummy!!!!!

I am currently trying to change the way I eat for the better. I was having fish tonight and I just wanted a kick and I decided to make just a serving of this for my. I used 1 tbsp of low fat mayo, 1 tsp of relish, and 1 tsp of onion. I'm in love. Just what I needed. Thank you so much!!

Okay...I have to admit that I am one of those people who have to have tartar sauce on their fish to able to eat it. Well, my husband decides at the last minute he wants to cook fish and we are out of tartar sauce. So, for the sake of me not going hungry I make this homeade tartar sauce and it is so good. I will never buy store bought tartar sauce again!! I did add a hint of dill, lemon juice and old bay season........awesome!

I made two versions, one with the sweet relish as listed, and one with dill relish.  Both were wonderful.  Add a touch of minced fresh cilantro leaves and either version are perfect on fish tacos!

GREAT base recipe.  One of my FAV sauces for fish you can only get at (rhymes with) RACKER FARREL.....Can I say C.B.?  Don't want any lawyers knockin' on my door. ;-) 
MINE turned out just like that.  I added about 2? tsp. lemon juice and chopped up my own sweet pickles and used shallot's and a some dill and 2 pinches of salt and some fresh cracked pepper.  I know, I know but all I needed was a good base recipe.  SO...bottom line I will use this again and can't WAIT to cook my fish tonight.  Thank you so much for sharing.

yes, very quick and easy, which is great.  I made it then tried it and added a bit of lemon pepper and lemon juice, which made it more to my liking.  Bf wanted fish sticks tonight, and I made it last night and let it sit.  Worked well that way.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is almost the same way I've made tartar sauce for years except.. I've never added onion before.  We really enjoyed it, though. Glad I tried it.

I forgot to buy tartar sauce at the store so I decided to look up a recipe and OMG this is delicious!! I added minced garlic, some dill and lemon juice and some tony cachares creole seasoning and it was the best tartar sauce I've ever tasted! no more store bought for my family. Just wonder how long it stays good for...

This is ridiculously easy to make and tastes great.  I used another reviewers suggestion to use lemon/pepper and I am glad I did.  Tangy.

Excellent, better than store bought.  Slapped it together as the tilapia fish sticks were coming from oven.  Used low-fat mayo and a squeeze of fresh lemon. My picky husband loved it so will make again and again :)

This is by far the best tartar sauce. I halved the recipe but prepared as written. The only thing I changed was to add 1 TBSP chopped capers. So yummy!

I liked this recipe because it was basic.  That being said, I altered the recipe slightly after tasting it the first time.  I added finely chopped garlic dill pickles in addition to the sweet pickle relish, about 1/8 cup worth.  I also added fresh and dried dill - probably about 1/2 tsp worth.  The dill really made this taste even better.  I also added a splash of lemon juice for some zing.

I have been making this tartar sauce for years and love it.  Only difference in mine is that I use dill relish, a squeeze of lemon juice and a little paprika.  Everyone loves it.

I added Worchestershire sauce and a bit of lemon juice to this recipe - it gave it a little more zip.

This was so suprisingly delicious. I made this with catfish and homemade fries, and I swear it was the best thing on my plate was the tartar sauce. Best I've ever had. Added a little lime though.

Thanks for this quick, tasty, easy recipe.  I had fish in the oven and realized I was almost out of tartar sauce.  I got on the computer and pulled up this recipe and had it made before the fish finished baking. My husband tried the sauce and said  "this tastes like it used to taste when I was a kid".   No more store bought tartar sauce!

We only use tartar sauce on fried fish and I fry fish about twice a year.  I have always bought the smallest jar of tartar sauce in the past but even that went to waste.  I halved this recipe and it was great.  It tasted so fresh even though it’s just mayonnaise and a few other ingredients.  I didn’t add any salt and it came out perfect.  I’ll never buy store bought tartar sauce again.

I didn't have any sweet pickle relish so I finely chopped some dill pickle as a substitute.  My brother-in-law from Maryland loved this with his crab cakes.  I value his opinion since "crab cakes and football- that's what Maryland does!" :)

This was great with my fried fish. I almost ate it plain! Creamy mayo, sweet relish and the crunchy, salty fish. . . . yummm.

This is how I make tartar sauce, too, though I normally use about 1 to 3 relish to mayo.  (1/3 c relish + 1 c mayo in this recipe).    Be sure to drain your relish pretty well  if it's the loose kind or you will end up with runny tartar sauce.

Sometimes the best things are the simplest things, and this is one of them. Yummy! Just make sure to make it up a few hours before serving so the flavors can meld.

Awesome basic recipe! I use half mayo and half sour cream, only 2 tablespoons sweet relish, about 1/4 cup chopped onion, and I add lemon juice and dill to taste in addition to the salt and pepper. It's great for last minute, but even better the next couple of days, after the flavors meld. Excellent quick & easy no egg tartar sauce!

I made this to go with "Crispy Fish Fillets" from this site.  It was really good, and easy to make.  I will always make fresh tarter sauce from now on, no more store bought stuff.

Great basic recipe.  First time making tartar sauce and am very pleased with results!  Fish coming out of oven in about 10 minutes and we're looking forward to slathering with this delicious sauce! No more store bought tartar sauce for us.  Next time maybe I'll try the dill or other ingredients other reviewers suggested.  Thank you!

Great, easy to make tartar sauce.  It's now my go-to tartar sauce recipe, I never buy it ready made any more.  Sometimes I add some fresh dill if I have it, but it's great without!

This was a very good recipe for tartar sauce. I do not like sweet pickles very much and had never considered using dill pickles instead.  I had all the ingredients and it was easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly.  I will use this recipe again!!!

I love this recipe! I will never eat store bought tartar sauce again. I am a diabetic so I did use sweet pickle relish made with Splenda. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. It is perfect as is.

I used this recipe as a starting point, but I changed a bit on it. I used 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup mayonaise, 1/4 cup sweet pickle relish, 1/4 cup of RED onion. I also added about a tablespoon of horseradish, a dash of lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. It was great!

I agree with several others, this is better than store bought. I used green onions, and dill as others suggested. It tasted fine without the dill but also better with it. Either way, it’s easy fast, and cheap.

Perfection!  Tasted so fresh!  My husband loved it, said it was the best he's ever tasted!  Followed the recipe as stated, using dried onions bc I had no fresh onions.

I made this. It is really good. It's similar to my moms. But she used chopped capers and dill pickle relish  & grated the onion and squeezed the juices out.

Spice this up and eat it with salmon patties I.  It's a greate base recipe.  Here's what I did: I used an equal ratio of mayo and sour cream (I would probably just use mayo next time)  I sauted the onion and added a teaspoon of hot pickled peppers and kept the relish, I also added a dash of chili lime powder.

Was looking around for an alternative to the usual ketchup and fish sticks that my and my son have. Never really tried tartar sauce either but after reading all the reviews I tried it and it is very simple,different and tasty!

Quick, easy, mighty tasty! Superior to store-bought or restaurant brands. Why buy it when you can whip it up in a few minutes!

This recipe was very similar to a famous fast food restaurant with the double arches that was with me using dill relish instead of the sweet.

My family has used this as our staple tartar sauce all of my life, though we thin it out with lemon juice, quite standard but none the less works.
