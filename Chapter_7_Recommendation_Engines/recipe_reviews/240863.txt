I used the suggestion of fresh/roasted vegetables instead of powdered seasonings. Love it!

Itâ€™s a good technique of making it. Definitely did not like the taste of it when it was done so I just made another batch and put in the flavors I enjoyed.

I only substituted lemon juice for the citric acid and doubled the cumin (because my family loves cumin!). This recipe is great, fantastic, and simply fabulous!!!

I'm a promoter of cookimg your own food from scratch and eliminating any processed ingredients. This recipe will not let you down. It may take some time, but the end result is worth it. The hummus came out quite thick so, I suggest you make up the batch and reserve the liquid. Then let the hummus sit and add more liquid later, if necessary. Thank you for the recipe
