My husband and I really liked this. The crumb mixture added a really nice touch. I didn't have poppy seeds and can't get them where I live, so I used sesame seeds instead. Next time I will shred the chicken instead of cutting it up into chunks, only because I didn't lcare for the chewy texture of the chunks of chicken in the casserole. It only took about 40 minutes to be hot and bubbly in my oven.

Delicious!  I made this with light sour cream and light cream of chicken soup and you couldn't even tell!  Our family devoured this--definitely will make again and again.

I've tried this several times by the recipe and it's always great. This time, I cut the recipe in half, added 2/3 cup of cooked rice and chopped up a small box of frozen broccoli. It was fantastic and no need to prepare sides!

My best friend's mother-in-law cooks a dish like this every time they visit her. She loved it but didn't have the exact measurements. We plugged in the ingredients on AR and this recipe showed up. We had a big group over last night so we doubled the butter, ritz crackers and chicken that the recipe calls for. Very different from anything I've ever tried but everyone cleaned their plates last night. Wonderful flavor. Next time I'll add some salt, pepper and maybe cheese.

Wow! This is soooo good! The only things I changed was I used 1/2 C butter instead of 1 cup and 3 chicken breasts instead of 8. The Ritz crackers are a yummy salty little crunch on the top! Thanks for sharing Ladybug!

This really good! I've made several versions of poppy seed chicken and this filling is really good. I love that I don't have to cook it beforehand like some recipes. I prefer the cracker mixture on top also. Very good! I added some mozzarella cheese.

I made this dish exactly  according to the recipe except I didnt read to cook the chicken first! I didnt realize this until i stirred the chicken into the sour cream.  I had to cook the living daylights out of it to get the meat cooked.  Still-it was delicious.  Can"t wait do do it right

I just thought it was way too buttery and the cream of chicken soup mixed with sour cream was too thick and salty. Taking this one out of my recipe box.

Fans of poppyseed chicken will enjoy this recipe.  What makes this one different from my usual recipe is the layer of buttery crumbs on the bottom of the pan in addition to a layer sprinkled on top.  Of course this modification tasted good but for my family, I'll probably stick to my usual to cut back a little on the calorie and fat content.   We definitely enjoyed trying this version though.

Delicious!  Served over jasmine rice.  Not calorie friendly, but worth it for the best comfort food I have ever eaten!  I cut recipe in half.  Next time will freeze half for another meal.  Only thing I added was pepper!

This was amazing!  The only change I made was to add a can of Ortega chilies and serve over rice.  I also used half a package of Costco's rotisserie chicken instead of cooking the breasts.  My husband is still raving about this!

My husband really liked it. He doesn't like cream of chicken so I used cream of mushroom (99 % fat free!) I did cut the recipe in half. Thanks for submitting it.

I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't tried it yet - just found it. This is for Nick. The soup in the recipe is chicken soup, not mushroom, and if you don't want to use canned soup, make a white sauce and add whatever.  I'm definitely going to make this because I love chicken AND Ritz crackers!

We cut this recipe in half for 2 of us with leftovers  Just think using cooked chicken and cooking for an hour is way too long. We grilled chicken about 3/4 way done, then chopped into pieces and heated for 35 minutes.Chicken not dry

I love this recipe and have made it many times over the years.  I couldn't find my recipe and found this one on All Recipes today.
The only variations from this recipe and my original is that I add 8 oz. sliced mushrooms that have been sautéed lightly in butter. 
I also add 1-2 tablespoons of dry sherry.
This is an old Marshall Fields recipe from days gone by.  Love it and thanks for sharing this one.

I have been making this for years with a slight difference.  I use a whole rotisserie chicken shredded and I put crackers and poppy seeds on top only. I also serve it over white rice.  My grown kids request it everytime they come home.

Got 3 Rotisserie chickens, used those, and then only baked uncovered for 35 minutes, used breadsticks on the side, and the entire family LOVED this, my youngest said "you'll be making this again"  Thanks All Recipes, for making dinner choices easier!

This was excellent.  I used the chicken from the chicken soup I made.  My husband won't eat that chicken meat except in chicken salad.  He LOVED this recipe.  I added salt & pepper.  Soooo good!  It's a keeper!

My family has been making this recipe for decades. We use leftover smoked turkey from Thanksgiving. You can add a bit of liquid smoke for a similar effect.

Tasted good, little too saucy, too buttery.  Amounts need to be adjusted for better balance.

I would love to give this 5 stars but I made slight change.  I followed the recipe (I did cut it in half) but added about 1 tsp of tarragon for some extra spice.   I think this is a great pot luck recipe and will definitely make again.  Thanks.

Yep, have made it several times. My husband really likes it. Wish there was a way to get the nutritional content. My brother-in-law is staying with us and needs to know the carbs and sodium content. This is a really great recipe

This recipe was wonderful! I love poppy seeds and I'm always looking for other ways to use them besides desserts. The only thing I changed was adding some shredded cheese to the crumb mixture on the top.

Delicious comfort food!  Not great for the waistline, but very yummy.  I didn't have any poppy seeds, so I added a tablespoon of chia seeds.  I also put a layer of buttered fusili noodles as the base, followed by the chicken mixture and then topped off with the butter/cracker/chia seed topping.  Whole family loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.  :)
