This was my first cheesecake and it certainly earned all 5 stars.

I did have a few problems.  

1.The crust barely covered the bottom of my 9" pan.  It worked out fine though.
2. I never could melt the chips at the end to drizzle on top.  They melted through the plastic to make a mess in the microwave and then burned when I tried melting on the stove.  Next time, I may just drizzle chocolate from a tube.
3. I forgot to soften the creamcheese and it fried my mixer.  Literally-smoke came out and everything.  Don't forget to take the creamcheese out early.
4. The biggest mistake I made - I did not let the cheesecake sit in the fridge long enough.  It really needs to chill overnight I think.  We ate it room temp and the flavors were dulled a bit.
5. I used peanut butter instead of butterscotch and, although tasty, the peanut butter overpowered the other 2 chocolates.

That being said, every person raved over this cheesecake.  It was amazing in spite of all my mistakes.  Plan a couple hours to make this the day before you plan to serve it

*I used the base of this cheesecake for different types of chips, bottom layer dark chocolate, add salt to help with bitter taste. Milk chocolate was in the middle and on top just plain cheesecake. It was a hit. The only comment I heard was to add some sort of topping, such as chocolate, caramel or white chocolate drizzle to top of cake.* Another favorite cheesecake to make. A change I make is using milk chocolate chips instead of the semi sweet and I do just a plain graham cracker crust. Very good, very rich!

This is my all-time favorite cheesecake.  It does take a little longer to make than most cheesecakes, but it is worth every minute.  If I want to impress my guests, this is what I make.  Very yummy!!

I made this cheesecake for thanksgiving and received rave reviews.  It is a little more work than I'm used to doing for a cheesecake, but was definitely worth it. I will be making this one again!

We expected it to taste like cheesecake with flavors. What a dissapointment.

this recipe was my first attmept at cheesecake and was easier to make than I thought! Cheesecake turned out well, I brought it to a dinner and I've never seen something disappear so quickly that I almost didn't even get a piece! I love cheesecake, but I found that this is a *really* rich cheesecake, so servings need to be fairly small, but I had no complaints...in fact they've been pushing me to make it again.

This cheesecake makes a beautiful presentation and has good flavor. However, when I served to guests, it was a bit too rich and wasn't as well received as other cheesecakes I've made from All Recipes (people couldn't finish their piece) so I can only rate this 4 stars.

This recipe is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever had.  It takes a little more time with the layering but is well worth the effort.  I highly recommend it!

This cheesecake was good but not the best I've ever made or tasted. especially considering the time it took to make. Probably will not make repeatedly.

this cheesecake is AMAZING! my friend and her fiance have asked me to make this as their groomscake for their wedding in may. everyone has raved about this - they have trouble believing i made it because it tastes like something you'd buy in a bakery! this has been, by far, the favorite of the many cheesecake recipes i've tried. the crust is really good too - i may sub this crust for every cheesecake i make from here on out. the recipe says it's time consuming, but i didn't find that it took me too long, especially after the results i got. totally worth it!

Everyone I serve this to LOVES this cheesecake.  My only beef with it is that it's not hard enough.  I'm not a fan of soft cheesecakes - I like them heavy, dense, and dry.  That said, this has a lovely taste.  While not hard to make, it is a little time consuming.

People at church pot lucks keep requesting it, so I'm sure I'll keep making it!
