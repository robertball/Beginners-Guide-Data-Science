This was great! I made one change, I left out the raisins and added more curry powder. I served the mixture over rice. Then I had a choice of condo mints to place on top, such as mango chutney, raisins, coconut, banana, bacon, chopped onions, chopped eggs, and peanuts. Delicious and a huge hit with family and guests

Pretty good, but a little sweeter than I prefer. Next time, I'll try leaving out the brown sugar.

I made this a second time with half the brown sugar, which was an improvement. The big improvement, though, was serving this with a dollop of Greek yogurt. Yum!

GREAT DISH. The lamb is so tender and the whole thing just pops. Maybe add a little spice or salt to try and reduce the sweetness. But Great Dish! Serve on a bed of basmati rice.

Absolutely delicious! I wasn't sure how that combination would be but took a chance and now we have it once or twice a month. Nice flavor.

I cooked this for Mother's day and it was VERY tasty and not too sweet.  I cooked it again with chicken drumsticks and the meat was falling off the bone it was so juicy. I didn't have any Granny Smith apples but Braeburn worked just as well.

Incredible. This will be a menu staple from now on - the raisins were plump and beautiful, and the apple reminded me of the curry my grandma made in Japan.  Thank you!!!!

Have made it twice and for a group of friends last night and it was a total hit!  I almost burned it....actually did a little but it tasted great.  A good one to make for company...one pot meal.  I used chicken thighs for could not afford the lamb, but it was delicious indeed.  Outside of changing to chicken, I kept to the recipe.  We love Indian food and go constantly to a wonderful place.  I actually found this recipe on their site, and when I hit the picture it took me to this site...which is my favorite and to this recipe.  Ate there a few days ago and thanked them for sending me to this site and recipe!  My husband loved it!!

Yum! This was a spectacular dish. I used all the ingredients exactly as specified. However, I found meaty lamb bones on sale and used those because I could not find cubed lamb stew meat at the market. I softened the onions,browned the meat, and brought the all ingredients to a boil as directed, then threw it in the crockpot to simmer. The lamb fell off the bones! I paired this with a cucumber-cilantro raita recipe I found on this site. Add some indian bread or rice and you have a 5 star dinner!

Seriously regretting only making 1/2 the Recipe. The sauce is amazing, definitely will make it again with chicken or beef to bring down the cost. I used a bit less sugar but otherwise followed it perfectly. Aside from a slight burn in the bottom, but it still tastes great so for those of us who are not great chefs this is a very forgiving recipe. I bet it will freeze well. The lemon at the end is a must, the acid makes the curry flavor pop.

So delicious!!  It was my first time making a sweet curry with lamb, and both my husband and I  were more than happy with the results!  I did have to watch the mix towards the end to make sure that it wasn't getting too dry and/or burned.  I added a bit more chicken stock, and everything turned out great!  I will be making this recipe again and again.

Very different, very flavorful.  I used ground beef instead of lamb and cranberries instead of raisins.

It made a great dish that tasted very genuine like from an indian restaurant. My only complaint is more a personal taste issue in that it was way too sweet. I did see a review that recommended leaving the brown sugar out. That might be a good option to try next time. Overall good.

I tried this for the first time to serve as the entree at a church progressive dinner.  I was happy to read it could be made the day before.  That freed up my time, and allowed me a re-do period in case it did not go well.  It was very popular.  Most guests had second helpings.
I will make it again.  It was mild which was good as some guests were very elderly.  I would try hotter curry for a younger  group.

I'm giving this a 4 only because my husband loved it. I generally don't really like indian food anyway, but I found the spice and flavors to be rather one dimensional. I feel it would be better with maybe some rurmeric, chili powder, paprika, cinnamon, etc. The raisens were a nice addition, but the recipe itself was just bland to me. On a positive note, the house smelled wonderful and my husband's coworkers were raving about the smell when he took his leftovers to work for lunch the next day. On my own, I wouldn't be making this again, but he wants me to try it with some additional spices.

Not sure it is fair to review this because I used it as a jumping off place . I had leftover leg of lamb, so I didn't do the flour dusting, I just tossed it in the sauce I made, at the end of the cooking time. This recipe did inspire me to use raisins, which were abfab. My sauce was just yellow curry paste, pineapple juice, and a jar of coconut milk though. It was an awesome quickie meal.

Great recipe! It reminded me of the lamb that I get at a Moroccan restaurant nearby. I used 2 lbs of lamb meat instead of the full 3 lbs and kind of adjusted the recipe based on that. It was still a lot for me any my boyfriend but the leftovers were great too! Also added dried apricots which blended really well with the other flavors.

I made this and I used stewing beef instead of lamb. as I had beef in the freezer. I also only added half the brown sugar. and cooked for 30mins more just so the beef fell apart. my kids aren't keen on currys I keep making them. but this one was a massive hit. served with rice and popadoms and a onion mint and cucumber salad. it's already been requested again for next week.

This was excellent! My local store  doesn't carry lamb stew meat so I bought shoulder chops and cubed those.  I did follow one reviewers suggestion and only used half of the brown sugar.  I also needed to add more chicken stock as mine was thickening up before the meat was done.  Will be making again.
