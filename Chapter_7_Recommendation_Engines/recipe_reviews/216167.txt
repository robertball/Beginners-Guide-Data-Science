The recipe looked interesting and was fun to try. I'm Italian, grew up with Italian cooks and Italian cooking, and I travel to Italy - yet I've never heard of this! Curiosity hooked me right away.  It's not bad - it comes together quickly and certainly is easy enough to make. It's kind of a cross between chocolate pudding and hot cocoa.  Having said that, however, the consistency is odd, like it can't make its mind up between the two.  In addition, it's not sweet enough and is rather flat tasting - it could definitely benefit from a little extra sugar, a splash of vanilla and a pinch of salt. The concept was intriguing, and Hubs and I did enjoy it, but not enough to make again.  I guess we'd prefer either a cup of hot chocolate or a dish of chocolate pudding.

This is WONDERFUL hot chocolate!  It reminds me of the hot chocolate that they drink in the movie Chocolat.  It is very thick and creamy but that's why I like it.  I added three TBLS of sugar because I like my chocolate sweeter.  It was the perfect amount as suggested by another reviewer.  I also added two dashes of Cayanne pepper, and three dashes of cinnamon to give it that little extra kick of heat and to cut the chocolaty flavor just a bit. It was really good.  I know the recipe says it makes two servings but it filled my big mug and I drank it all.  If you want that extra creaminess, use either 2% or whole milk.  Also, dipping sponge cake in it is heaven!

I thought this recipe looked interesting and so I decided to try it. It had the consistency of a non-watery hot chocolate and not a pudding like the picture depicted. Although, it was nice and chocolaty, as is, it is like drinking a cup of melted bitter sweet chocolate with milk. So, if I made again I would definitely add some extra sugar a teaspoon at a time.

I was craving something chocolate-y, but didn't want to fuss with baking something however I wanted something with substance. This did live up to being a pudding-y hot chocolate, and it hit the spot. I followed the suggestions of adding a dash of salt and a splash of vanilla, but in the future I may try adding some cinnamon or cayenne, as one reviewer mentioned. I did increase the sugar to three tablespoons and I thought the level of sweetness was just right, without being overly sweet. I put one mug in the fridge, and let the other cool slightly on the counter. If you want a more liquid-like drink then don't refrigerate, as the texture becomes more pudding-y.

This was great. I was longing for that special pudding-y taste of italian hot chocolate and this captured it. I made it with skim milk and it turned out great. Like others, I used 2T sugar and 1/4 t vanilla. Wonderful and easy!

Ohhhhh soooo gooooood!  The funny thing is I don't lke hot chocolate, chocolate milk, or pudding.  This is to die for.  I bought a case of the actual Italian Ciobar mix before I left Europe and I am slowly going through it.  Nothing like attending Carneval in Venice in frigid February while sipping on a cup of this.  MUST put whipped cream on top.

My roommate and I love it. We've used this hot chocolate recipe the last three or four nights in a row. I keep burning my tongue.

It's very versatile, you can add as much sugar (or use less) as you see fit. I've taken the liberty of adding in some vanilla extract and quite like the result. Very tasty... I think I'll try some peppermint extract next time.

Just coming from Spain and Italy....We had hot chocolate similar to this while there and we were amazed with this recipe...I don't suggest you do like we did and buy a machine to steam your milk...but it helps.. I do suggest that you add a little more sugar to adjust for your sweet tooth... I think we will add some vanilla next time to experiment...

I love the flavor of this!  It was easy and sooo good (I added a little vanilla but otherwise followed the recipe exactly).  Next time, I might add a little more cocoa powder and cornstarch.  Mine never thickened up.  It took about 20 minutes to simmer on low heat, and after I added the cornstarch, I cooked it for another five minutes.  When it didn't thicken up, I decided oh well, and drank it anyway.  Soooo good!  I do wish it was thicker, though.  Perhaps it didn't thicken because I used 2% milk... Hmmm.

*************Update: I made this recipe again still using 2% milk.  I added an extra tablespoon of corn starch, and I waited until near the end to add the vanilla and pinch of salt.  I also cooked it at a slightly higher temperature.  It still took about 20 minutes to cook, but it thickened this time!  Actually, it got a little too thick for my enjoyment.

Made this as the recipe states, but with sugar-free soy milk and drizzled with sweetened condensed milk. This hot drink has a rich, comforting taste and is not sweet. Mine came out thicker than your typical hot chocolate, but not as thick as I had imagined...maybe a touch more cornstarch is needed.

More of a syrupy texture than a pudding texture, but who wants to drink pudding anyway? This recipe made a fine hot chocolate, and it works well with dark cocoa powder as well! It'll definitely take the edge off any chocoholic's craving.

Like the inside of chocolate lava cake! Needs a bit more sugar and a splash of vanilla. Made mine in the microwave: once the milk/cocoa/sugar was warm added the cornstarch and cooked at 30 second intervals until pudding like.

Mmmmm... quite a nice treat! After reading the reviews, I made my own variation: A little less sugar, a touch of vanilla, and a (big) splash of International Delights Hazelnut Coffee Creamer. I always think you can't beat the combination of hazelnut and chocolate!

Yummmm! This is similar to the hot chocolate I drank in Spain. Rich, thick, and chocolatey, it is often accompanied by churros or other sweet breads. It's like a pudding, but drinkable.  This recipe is super easy to make. I mixed the ingredients in the pot, added milk, turned on the heat, and whisked. Done in five minutes. Vary the sweetness to your taste. Highly recommended, especially on a winter's evening or to enjoy with friends who have returned from Spain.

I liked the recipe but I agree it was a little flat so I added a pinch of salt, a little vanilla, more sugar & a little more cornstarch if you like it a little thicker. A pinch of cayenne might be good as well. This reminds me of Starbucks chantico that they had out for awhile.

Absolutely amazing! You'll never settle for instant cocoa again. The first time I made it I was out of corn starch so I substituted coconut flour, big mistake! Flour leaves it with a grainy taste. Leave it as is, with the addition of a few grains of coarse sea salt to balance the chocolate. Oh, find a bulk foods store and get a good cocoa powder, not the canned baking stuff. Your taste buds will thank you!

Mmm good!  I tried this on the stove and in the microwave, and the microwave version was smoother and less fuss.  I whisked the dry ingredients in my batter bowl, whisked in the smaller amount of liquid until smooth, then whisked in the larger amount of liquid.  Cook on high 1 1/2 minute, stir, and repeat 3 times.  Do use a batter bowl for cooking as you want it to come to a rolling boil, and it foams up.  Add 1/2 tsp vanilla after cooking.  I used 3 Tbs sugar, 2 Tbs hazelnut creamer instead of the smaller amount of liquid, and the 1/2 txp vanilla.  Was scrumptious, took only 5 minutes, and only had one bowl to wash.  What could be better than that?  A very small scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream on top makes this very special.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because I had to make a few changes to get this to be good, and it never got to "pudding-like" consistency. It was thicker than regular hot cocoa, but nowhere near the consistency of pudding. I used whole milk, increased the sugar to 3 Tbsp, added a pinch of salt, about 1/4 to 1/2  tsp of vanilla, and a couple pinches of cinnamon. topped with a marshmallow. It was great with the changes. Very rich. I don't know why I"m drinking hot cocoa in July when the temp outside is over 100 degrees....As written, this would be really chocolaty and pretty bland.

This is very nice for 2 on a cold evening.  Different from the usual hot chocolate.  Can be sipped, or I prefer using a spoon.  Glad I read reviews before I made it--I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, a pinch of salt and a pinch of espresso powder.  The flavor would have been flat without these.  A squirt of canned whipped cream helps too.

I saw this and thought it would be good to try.  I did enjoy it. I really like the thick smoothness.  Will try with more sugar next time and I do like the idea of adding vanilla.  I topped it with whip cream.  Delish!

YUM!  I put in 3 Tbsp sugar instead of the 1 1/2 the recipe calls for and added a splash of vanilla extract and a splash of peppermint extract.  The only thing that could have made this better would have been if I had any whipped cream to put on top.

This was tough since I thought it was a 2 star & hubby gave it a 4 star.  Does take time because of the slow simmer to make & you need to love chocolate. I guess I expected something different that what it turned out to be.

I tried this this afternoon and instead of using cocoa which I thought would be a bit bitter I used Swiss Miss instead. I find this it delicious and would definitely make this again. Since the weather here in the U P of Michigan has turned much cooler, I can see me having this quite often in the future.

I increased the sugar so that it equalled the amount of cocoa, I reduced the amount of cornstarch by half because I did not want it to pudding thickness - rather, I just wanted a creamy hot choc

Was very excited to try this recipe as Italian hot chocolate is my favorite in the world. There is only one place in NYC I have found that makes their hot chocolate like they do in Italy, but they charge $5 a cup. I was hoping this would be a good home alternative. However it took FOREVER for the mixture to thicken... by the time we drank it, it was absolutely scalding hot! Maybe the ratio needs to be tweaked? Anyway, besides that the taste was really nice, but not exactly like the Italians do it.

I loved this.  Very dark chocolatey thick flavor.  The consistency was like warm pudding.  i always have these ingredients in the cabinet, which is a plus.  I used to drink this when I traveled to Italy and Malta.  Until now, I had been drinking warm pudding until I found this recipe.  It satisfies my fix.  I added a splash of vanilla, touch of cinnamon and salt, and used 2 tbls of sugar.  Will definitely make again.  Top with a few mini marshmallows or whip cream and enjoy.

I enjoyed this - it's a rich chocolaty cross between a drink and a pudding. My husband didn't care for it; he like drinks that are more liquid, and found this unpleasant. So it really boils down to the consistencies you're willing to experiment with. If you do make it, up the sugar to 3 T. and add a bit of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.

We also added vanilla and salt and did 3 tbsp of sugar. We were a little impatient waiting for it to cool down so we could try it so we added a bit of cold milk to our cups.  It was still plenty thick and had more of a dark chocolate taste to it. We'll be making it again.

We didn't like this at all. It has the same texture and taste of chocolate gravy. I was expecting thick and creamy but this was almost a pudding.

Thanks so much for posting this recipe. This is the type of Hot Chocolate that they serve in Sicily.  When I visit, I always have to go to the store and buy large quantities to take back home.  Now I don't have to - THANKS!!!!

I used 4 packets Truvia instead of sugar and Silk Coconut milk in place of regular milk. It was thick but not as thick as pudding. I did like it but I don't think it will be something that I will crave anytime soon.

O.M.G.! Now this is hot chocolate! Not real sweet and a nice deep chocolate flavor that is heavenly creamy. I used 2% milk that yielded a just right consistency and another time with full fat milk which made a slightly thicker consistency that I loved too, neither time though did it get "pudding" thick. I top my mug of hot chocolate with whipped cream and would opt for this anytime over many desserts it was that good. Nice proportion of ingredients nikwit, thank you for sharing your recipe!

This is a very good recipe, and people need to realize that the quality of their cocoa choice will give the quality of the drink. Find a very good quality baking cocoa like Droste, Guittard, etc - aim for a dark, dutched cocoa (even Hershey's has come out with one now with European on it). They make better drinking cocoas as they are less bitter to the palate. Type of milk will also change the outcome -- I enjoy 2 per cent milk since I'm watching calories. Whole milk is much better actually.  Options that can go with this: vanilla extract; more chocolate flavor with whisking in 2 tbsp semi-sweet choco chips; whisk in a tbsp creamy or crunchy peanut butter; stir in 1 tbsp of heavy cream; stir in some honey for the sweetener; brown sugar instead of white sugar; add in some mint flavoring or crushed mint candies; and so forth. It is a wonderful base as is, but variety is easy with this good foundation and the texture is pleasant instead of too thick. My kids also love it. Can be cooked in the microwave, but have to stir very often and can boil over if not a huge bowl to make it in :-)  ENJOY!! Great for dipping graham crackers, shortbread cookies, or cake doughnuts.

Beautiful blend! Use 1.5 tblspn raw sugar rather than white - richer and sweeter! Also pop two marshmallows and leave to melt for five minutes before drinking. Delicious! I personally found this extremely sweet as I love 85% cocoa chocolate haha but most people (including my housemates) think it's perfect! To get the thick consistency, I slowly heated the milk/cocoa/sugar until it JUST began to boil, then I quickly turned the heat down to a strong simmer/gentle boil, whisked in the pure corn flour (make sure it'd not wheaten corn flour) for 2 mins and then boiled quite vigorously for exactly 3 minutes. The mixture doubled in size whilst it was boiling. Oh and I also used skim milk! PS. have some hot milk handy for thos who can't handle it's intensity and need to 'tone it down' hehe

This recipe was a fast favorite with my family!  We were a little skeptical if we would like the thickness, but one sip and we were hooked.  I've made this at least twice a week since finding this recipe. Thanks!!

I was dying for a chocolate fix and this did it.  I made it for my friend's and myself and just loved it.  I followed other reviewer's advice and added a splash of vanilla and some extra sugar, according to my taste.  Next time I will try it with Cinnamon and Cayenne to see what that gives me.  Excellent!

I love this throat coating, creamy, for real hot chocolate. I don't drink the powdered junk anymore, though Swiss miss filled my childhood with happiness. I loved whisking real cacao (navitas natural brand) into some local wildflower honey on the stove top. As it heated the chocolate aroma filled my kitchen. I added in half and half because it was Christmas and we were going all the way with this hot cocoa. I had already added in the cornstarch. It would've been easier in a second step. It got hot and turned a beautiful color. We did add extra honey and vanilla.  I do think it isn't sweet enough. I have been off refined sugar for over a year and I hardly ever have sweets. I added a tablespoon extra in my kids mugs too. I had no problem with the thickness of the chocolate. It wasn't like pudding at all to me. Just spoon coating, chocolate bomb of a hot liquid happiness. Thank you for the recipe!

You can save yourself a lot of cleanup by making this in the microwave in a 2 cup pyrex measuring cup.  Just heat the milk/coco mixture, stirring every minute or two until it gets to temperature, then add the  corn starch slurry, return it to the microwave to heat some more until it is thick (the consistency should be like cooked pudding) and then pour from the pyrex cup into a mug (or 2 mugs, as it makes quite a bit).  Beyond that, use 3 tablespoons of sugar and finish it off by adding a splash of Kahlua.  If it doesn't get as thick as you think it needs to be, add an extra generous teaspoon of cornstarch to the slurry.  Top off with whipped cream and you're in a bistro in Italy, punto e basta!  I guess two more things, use good cocoa powder, and use whole milk.  If you only have skim on hand, add three tablespoons of half and half and that produces the amount of fat in whole milk for this recipe.

This was amazing!!! I added about 2tsp to it and like suggested a dash of salt, also I put in 2tsp of peanut butter like a different hot chocolate mix said. I ended up being a perfect mix! After putting it in a cup I put on a bunch of mini marshmallows then mixed up butter and brown sugar as a topper instead of chocolate syrup or caramel. Great recipie!!!

I live in Europe and this is a great recipe for the type of hot chocolate served in restaurants here.  Expect it to be thick and, after boiling several minutes, very hot.  I like to eat it with a spoon.  Delicious and warming on a cold day.

It was very yummy, thick and creamy, but I think lacked some ingredients. As other reviewers have said, it tastes much better if you add a pinch of salt, a tsp of vanilla, and an additional 1/2 tbsp of sugar.

Was good, specially because not too sweet.  However, next time I would: add less starch to reduce thickness, and add extra flavor with a splash of vanilla, rum, a dash of  salt and cinnamon.

This was just the recipe I was looking for! I skipped the corn starch. And topped it with some whip cream. I did not increase sugar quantity, but the whip cream added to the sweetness. Perfection

OMG - thanks for the recipe! When we were in Milan in March it was cold and rainy and several cups of cioccolata  calda kept us warm  every day. It is a lovely, thick concoction. Almost like a drinkable pudding. It's also a drinkable warm hug. Thank you! I'm making it!

This is a religion in Northern Italy.  My husband constantly complains when we are outside Italy because he says the hot chocolate served anywhere else is just hot chocolate milk.  This recipe is perfect; the amounts and method are precise.  It is exactly as you get in any bar (cafè) in Italy. In fact, it is always "eaten" with a spoon because it resembles a liquid pudding.  I always add some hot chili powder, but the classic recipe is as written here.  Thank you for sharing.

This is close to the real thing in Italy. The consistency, while thick, could be more  accurately described as drinkable pudding. Italian cioccolata calda is not as sweet as what we are accustomed to and is often served with a sugar packet to the side.  I plan on investing in some better quality darker cocoa and trying this again in the near future.

When we were in Venice a few years ago we found a little cafe/coffee shop that served a similar delicious hot chocolate. Thick and rich! I’ve searched and searched, and this is the closest recipe I’ve been able to find. I add the corn starch to the sugar and cocoa to save a step and it works great. We love this recipe and use it quite often during the cold, winter months. Thank you for sharing!

This was an exceptional cup of hot cocoa! I heated this up in a sauce pan after the family spent a chilly evening putting up Christmas lights outside. I didn't have cornstarch so threw in some mini marshmallows (to taste) instead, which thickened and added sweetness so didn't use any sugar. Topped with some home made whipped cream with a touch of vanilla and cinnamon, it was OUTSTANDING! Definitely will make this again, using the same ingredients. I let the mixture cool and put it in a large glass canning jar in the fridge and heated it up in the microwave the next evening. It turned out perfect.

This was absolutely delicious, and I did add a little vanilla and cinnamon to it, like other reviewers. Don't go too heavy when adding whipped cream - this chocolate stands on its own two feet! Thank you for the wonderful treat!

This is a very interesting combination of a hot chocolate and chocolate pudding.  I liked it, but it needed quite a bit more sugar for me.

I've made this several times now and the family loves it! They especially like to eat it frozen.

Was essentially hot dark/butter chocolate pudding in a cup. I made this on a cold snowy day for my family plus a handful of kids from our street - sure that they would appreciate a thick, rich treat after shoveling snow.  Much to my disappointment, nobody liked it.  Despite putting equal amounts of cocoa powder and sugar in, it was too bitter.  After pouring it into cups, I refrigerated the remaining "hot cocoa" and my husband who loves dark chocolate later ate it as pudding, but even he said it wasn't sweet enough.

This is a great recipe! I also tweaked it by addding more sugar and a bit of vamilla extract. One thing to note: the mixture must come to a boil after the cornstarch slurry is added or it will not achieve full thickness.

This was really good! I tripled the recipe & added about a Tbsp of cinnamon & a little more cornstarch than the recipe called for (wanted it on the thicker side). It reminds me of a drink I've had in Mexico (champurrado??). YUM!!!!
