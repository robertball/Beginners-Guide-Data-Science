One word...Amazing. So easy and fast to make. I made sure to mix the peanut butter, honey and flax really well before adding the other stuff. It's hard to mix, I had to use a large, metal spoon and really go at it. Bare hands would be easiest, like with meatloaf. I pressed the mixture into the 9x13 with my hands, it was easier. In case anyone is wondering, like I was, you don't need to spray/butter the dish or use wax/parchment. It will come out of the (glass) dish just fine. Most likely due to the oils in the peanut butter. The recipe says to cut into 12 bars. I cut mine into 20, and next time will make even smaller. These are SO filling. My bars are roughly 3" x 1 3/4". They are packed with flavor and goodness, so these WILL fill you up and the hunger stays away for a long time. Longer than with store bought bars. Great for an on-the-go breakfast or for your mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. I wrapped individually, put in a tupperware with no lid in the fridge, so they're easy to grab for everyone. You can use any combo of dried fruits and nuts! Oh, I let it sit in the fridge, covered, overnight before cutting (about 12 hours). They tasted best after all the flavors could meld together. Thank you!

I loved this recipe! I used 1/4 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup maple syrup instead of the honey. I cut the peanut butter  back to 1 cup & softened it in the microwave for easier mixing. My family loves these, great to go breakfast for our kids before school or as an after school snack! Next time I'm going to double the batch & make it in a jellyroll pan.

I did not have almonds on hand, I had peanuts so I made a quick switch out. I did run the peanuts through my mini food processor for a rough chop before folding it into the other ingredients. I also used Jif extra crunchy peanut butter because that was all I had on hand. This was easy to mix up with pantry ingredients. They held together well and were quite tasty. Thumbs up from our family.

This is the perfect "basic", no-bake, whole-food granola bar recipe I've tried! It's great as is, but it's also easy to add/change depending on your preferences! I also love that these do not have to be baked. Easy and quick to prepare and, most of all, yummy!  My family loves them. Tonight I made a batch to take with us for "fuel" at a volleyball tournament tomorrow.  Tonight's changes to the original recipe:  Toasted the oats first, used 1/2 honey 1/2 raw maple syrup, used a whole 16 oz jar of natural unsweetened crunchy peanut butter (which is just a bit more than the 1 1/4 cups called for), mixed dried fruit, 1/2 cup Chia seed (for extra protein + it uses up the extra peanut butter I added), and a few sprinkles of cinnamon. Left everything else the same. Thanks so much for the recipe! AllRecipes never lets me down!

I no longer buy store bought granola bars because of all of the additives, so I've been experimenting with homemade granola bar recipes.  This one was really good!  I just made them tonight and they came together easy.  My modifications: added 1 T. cinnamon, pinch of salt (to bring out the sweet flavors), and 1 T. of brown sugar in lieu of 1/2 of the honey.  I omitted the cranberries.  These are very peanut-buttery and the chocolate chips are a nice balance to that sweetness.  I will definitely be saving this recipe!  I love that you can add different ingredients (dried fruit, different nuts, etc.)

i was looking for something healthy for the kids to snack on instead of chips and junk..i have to say the first time i made these they disappeared before i had the chance to sample them..so the next time  made them i doubled the recipe..and again..the y disappeared before i got to sample them..lol..ive been making these now for a few months....every weekend..kids love them..they love making them with me.. and they especially love eating them...lol...i change up the ingredients all the time....so faar there hasnt ben anythng n them the kids dont like!....thank you for the great recipe!..... add on sept 12 2019....after making these for some time now I find that if you wear kitchen gloves like in resturaunts first spray them with  a little cooking spray then just use your hands to mix all the ingredients together ...I put a wet paper towel under my baking sheet so the pan stays still  wax paper over the granola use a rolling pin to flatten them out put in freezer for about an hour pull out and slice them down ….I I usually get about 50 out of my batches because I double them....after they are cut I put each one into snack bags and they all go into the freezer for the kids whenever they want them..

I added salted, sunflower seeds, rough chopped some bulk almonds, and threw in raisins.  Melted the peanut butter and honey as previous reviewers suggested. Great tip that made mixing easier.  I seriously will never buy another granola bar because nothing will ever equate to this healthy flavourful snack. Thanks for the recipe!

I found this to have way too much peanut butter and honey. Those flavors overpower everything else I put in this recipe. I added slivered almonds, sunflower seeds, choc chips, and dried apricots. I will use this as a base for my no bake bars but will either add more oats or scale back the honey and PB.

My Family liked these granola bars, but I cut the bars into 36 servings. It has quite a bit of peanut butter,so my family preferred the smaller servings.

I decided to try this out but scaled down the recipe down to 4 servings. It didnt taste bad, but wasnt quite chewy as others I have tried of copycats of the store bought Quaker granola bars. I sort of like oatmeal cooked or mixed with the hot syrup. The raw oatmeal taste can be sort of chalky. I would recommend this type of granola bar recipe more for a person on a raw foods type diet. I used mini chocolate chips, chopped dried sweet cherries, and finely chopped almonds. Main issue I had though was it coming together easily. It was sort of sticky. I finally opted to shape them individually in snack bags scooping an even amount into each bag. I got 5 large bars and from the appearance it seemed to do the trick. Overnight, they seemed to hold together into the shape I made them in. I used a sharp knife and cut them in half in the morning. It made 10 approximately 2-3" bars at 164 calories each according to on-line calculations.

There are so many other ideas you can do with these.  For one, I roll them into bite-size balls.  Easier to eat and you feel more satisfied having "several"!  I also add toasted coconut, cinnamon and nutmeg, hemp seed, walnuts and almonds, AND for a special taste for the kids, I add two tablespoons of Ovaltine to add a chocolate flavor! It's not that much chocolate at all, and the kids love them.  you just mix it with the recipe before rolling. Going to try to add some dried apple next time.

These were delicious and so easy! You can use it as a great base and add whatever you want to it. I left out cranberries but I added cashews, coconut, raisins and dried blueberries. I melted the peanut butter and honey together in the microwave for about a minute and then added them to the dry ingredients to make it a little easier to mix, then added the chocolate chips at the end so they didn't completely melt when I mixed in the peanut butter and honey. I cut them into 16 and they were still very large, I'll probably cut them into 20 next time. I took some with me on a canoeing trip this weekend and they went over really well. Definitely helped me make a good first impression on the new boyfriend's friends :)

I'll definitely be making another batch this week.

the best thing(s) about this recipe is the base - the first four ingredients (and the fourth can be substituted with brown sugar, maple syrup, mango syrup &tropical fruits, really "do it your way") - the rest can be switched added to etc. to taste - any nut from pistachios to macadamia any dried fruit from blueberry to dried pineapple (cut/diced really small just do not overdo)

This recipe is great.  I made it with chopped pecans-my daughter is not a fan of almonds, all natural peanut butter and diced dried apples I found at Bob's Red Mill instead of the cranberries.  My daughter loves them and I feel like I am giving her a healthy snack for lunch and before swimming.  I was able to cut them into about 2 x 2 squares.  They are so rich, she only needs one to be satisfied.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!

I didn't use any additional nuts, but a little more of chunky PB than called for, and used 1/2 cup corn syrup instead of honey. I stirred and microwaved the syrup and PB for one minute, stirred, and mixed with a big spoon  as much as I could, then used my hands.
These are great! I put a sheet of wax paper on top and used a rolling pin to get them pressed together well. They held up well after being cut- a pizza cutter works best.
Next time I'm gonna use chopped dates.

I have made this recipe over many times.  I am afraid to let the supply run dry!  I have added various dried fruits in addition to the cranberries such as raisins, dried cherries.  I have switched out various nuts, like pecans, pumpkins seeds work great.  I have also added different chips such as butter scotch, salted Carmel, heath slivers mixed with the chocolate to make the 1/2 cup. A real nice twist is to use 1 cup crunchy peanut butter and 1/4 cup of hazelnut nutella... yummie!  I typically do not use a full cup of flaxseed and the texture is still great. I too cut them into small 1 inch squares as they are jam-packed with lots of good stuff! Fun to experiment with different combinations of ingredients.

Turned out great. One tip... If you decide to melt the peanut butter and honey, you may not want to use mini chocolate chips as I did. The warmth of that mixture was enough to completely melt the chips.

I'm going to always keep these on hand - they are the first small item that actually satisfies my hunger & keeps me full for 2 or 3 hours plus are healthy, too! Not low-cal, but for a "meal", not bad. I like the high fiber and protein content, and the taste is good, too. I made them as stated, but heated the ingredients in the MWO to make stirring easier (still a JOB!) Because the mix was warm & I used mini chips, they melted into the batter, but the taste was good anyway. I'll try regular sized chips next batch. I froze some, and they were just like fresh when thawed. I packed them a little too hard in the pan, so will go a little lighter next time, so they're softer to eat. Thanks for the recipe, Jessica et al!

What a great recipe! I changed it just a bit I used 3/4 peanut butter and 3/4 Nutella since my family likes chocolate a lot. Then I skipped the almonds and cranberries. These are delicious!

Sooo good!!! It's like eating cookie dough while it cools. Like other reviewers, I also didn't have dried cranberries or almonds and instead used coarsely ground mixed nuts. The family loves them, and they're so quick to make!! We're definitely making these regularly.

Great basic recipe! You can add whatever you want. Chocolate or white chips, raisins or cranberries. Mine came out soft like an oatmeal cookie! My family likes these for a quick breakfast or snack before a workout.  Delicious!

I followed the recipe almost to the T, except I used less honey and added 1/2 tsp salt. I really enjoyed it! I heated the PB and honey to make it more liquidy for easier mixing, as suggested by another reviewer. This will be a great Go To recipe and I will be making these again and again. Thanks!

So easy to make, and I am not one who bakes so this no-bake recipe called to me! As well as the fact that it is so EASY & healthy! I left out the chocolate chips and added roasted pumpkin & sunflower seeds instead. Delicious!

Wow these are more like dessert than what I was looking for.  Not that they are bad by any means!  Ooey gooey goodness.  I'm looking for more of a granola bar texture ....so I will keep looking but these are very yummy.  UPDATE:  My husband will not let me stop making these.  He will put an empty milk carton back in the fridge but yet he will tell me every time there is only one of these bars left.  They are a staple in my fridge now and I love that he grabs one in the morning on his way out the door rather than an egg mcmuffin down the street.

This is a great recipe! It's so easy to switch out ingredients for your personal tastes. I used natural almond butter instead of peanut butter which was divine. I saw that a few people commented on switching out the honey however raw, organic honey is a superfood! You will be missing out on the all the nutrients and properties of the honey if you skip it. I also added sunflower seeds and goji berries then switched the chocolate chips to cacao nibs (raw chocolate) in mine. I used a mini muffin tin to pack them into and they come out in perfect bite sizes. If you are doing it with your hands instead of a utensil, keep water on your hands. It will allow you to work with the ingredients without everything sticking plus the water seems to keep it held together better. After an hour or so in the freezer, they pop right out of the tin and hold together well. I kept mine in the freezer for work and some in the fridge for immediate enjoyment. These are so filling and healthy. They give me a great boost of energy during that mid-afternoon grind at work. Great recipe! Thank you for adding!

I'm obsessed with this recipe! I've made it several times now. It's a perfect breakfast for me, because I never have the time to cook breakfast. I generally let them sit in the fridge over night before eating them and keep the extra bars in the refridgerator or freezer until I eat them. They tend to get a little mushy if left out for too long. I love adding dates to them! This time, I added cranberries, sunflower seeds, flax seed, dates, oats, organic peanut/coconut butter, honey,'and carob chips. Delicious!

I replaced the honey with 1/2 c agave nectar(better for you) and pecans from the almonds (due to allergies) and cranberries for raisins (another allergy). They taste great! Definitely one you can play around with!

I have made this recipe almost every week for my family since trying it.  It is so easy to make, healthy, and filling--a great afternoon snack.  I also like eating this as a light lunch with yogurt.  I made it exactly as stated, except used less honey.  Amazing!  Thank you!

AMAZING!! These were so easy, quick and very tasty. My 12 yr old loved them! I didnt have cranberries but used shredded coconut. Great for a quick snack or eating on the go. Very filling. This recipe is a keeper!

They are really delicious, but I will use less honey next time as I feel they are rather sweet. I added dried apples, dried cherries, and pecans while omitting the chocolate and cranberries. You can pretty much add anything you want to this base recipe. Next time I’ll do half almond butter as I found the peanut butter flavor to overpower most of the other flavors.

I found this recipe2 weeks ago and have made it four times already!   Delicious  and  easy.  I like that the granola  is sweetened with honey and not processed  sugar.  I tried some changes, like adding walnuts and using whole flaxseed instead of  ground, but I  just cannot beat the original recipe!  If it ain't  broke.....
I am making a batch for my nephews football team.  This is a great source of energy for  athletes young and old!

This is my first ever review and I’m happy to have it be for a recipe that has become a staple in our house.  The recipe is wonderful as is, quick and easy to prepare, so portable and most importantly, totally yummy! I’ve found a few small changes work well for us which I feel allows me to include a little more nutrition which is to substitute 1/2 cup of the flaxseed with 1/4 cup of chia seeds and 1/4 cup of hemp hearts.  Everyone I’ve shared these bars with, either the original or with the changes, has gone ga-ga for them. Thanks so much for a super recipe!

These bars exceeded my expectations! I can’t stop eating them. I have allergies to peanut butter, nuts and soy, so I made my bars with “SunButter”brand sunflower butter which tastes just like peanut butter. For the chocolate chips, I used mini semi-sweet chips made by “Enjoy life” (these chips don’t have soy in them). Also, I thought I’d try using some baking cranberries that were already Julienne cut instead of whole Craisins. The recipe turned out well. For my next batch, I might even add some roasted sunflower seeds since I can’t eat nuts. I liked that these were super easy to make. Thank you for such a great recipe!

The taste is amazing! My problem with these is the sticky gooey mess. They have been in the refrigerator for several hours now and still messy. I rolled them in balls and put them in the freezer. Hope for the best tomorrow.

Tastes great but I agree  other reviewers that I will add more oats next time to even out the peanut butter and honey ratio. Mine are still really sticky to touch after 6 hours. I uses pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries, sweetened coconut-next time I will use unsweetened and the rest of called for items.  No chocolate added. Will use again.  Great base recipe.

Better than expected. I only left out chocolate chips for my husband wasn’t a fan of them. It was so good I couldn’t wait to have them harden in the fridge, I just ate it with a spoon. I would say the pb is a lot, but still takes good. I read many reviews before making. I would say less pb, more honey, more nuts. Not cheap to make. Isn’t it sad eating better costs a lot more than eating junk. Definitely will make again with less pb.

I've been looking for a good no bake granola bar recipe and I've finally found it!! This recipe is so easy to make and the taste is really good.  I added coconut, sunflower seeds cut back on the choc chips and I like crunch so I added about 2 cups of rice crispies, I used 1/2 honey and 3/4 cup of corn syrup (because of the rice crispies) and a bit more pb and it worked really well, I can't wait to make them again.  The nut/fruit options are only limited by your imagination !! Thanks for this recipe

These are delicious and my husband is happy to eat them.

I will point out that they are not calorie friendly. Mine came out at 163 calories per bar (24 bars from a 9x13 pan). Recipe changes I made were 1 cup (250 grams) peanut butter, 15 grams flax seed, and 15 grams sunflower kernels (I left out the almonds). The bars are very sticky and I'm glad I sprayed the pan with cooking spray before spreading out the mixture.

Very easy to make, rich and quite filling.  The peanut butter is the  flavour that comes through the most.  I cut my bars into a bit smaller pieces.

I made the following the exact recipe except adding any dried fruit or almonds..... my kids prefer less 'chunkiness'.  Super easy to make and very filling, I made some into granola balls and the rest I pressed into an 8x8 pan.  Definitely a keeper!!!

Great base recipe.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it's quite crumbly.  It's not until they are in the fridge for a good while do they stay together, and even then depending on the size of the bar it's a  shoot.  I used mini chocolate chips to spread them out a little more evenly and cherry flavored dried cranberries, it was delish!

Easy and versatile! Both of my kids love these. I am sick of buying processed granola bars at the grocery stores with ingredients that I can't pronounce. The recipe makes a lot and I can control what is in them. I think that I could easily cut back on the honey and the peanut butter as well. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

These are not what I was looking for at all. They set in the fridge all night but they are so soft and way to sticky. I made these for my 2yo and while they eat them it's such a sticky mess. I won't be making these again.

I registered just to rate this recipe.  This is the only recipe I've ever made that my whole family has liked.  You'll have no problem with crumbling if you roll these into balls rather than making bars.   I toasted the oats on a medium heat frying pan for 5 minutes.   I crunched up the sliced almonds a bit.  These are wonderful!

I really love these, so full of nuttiness and gooey-ness.  I had about a cup of homemade almond butter that I used to replace a cup of the regular peanut butter and I added about a tablespoon of Chia seeds for extra crunch.  I also used half agave nectar and half honey in the recipe. As several others stated, these are very compact and filling so I actually got 40 bars out of one 9 x 13 pan.  For those of you doing Weight Watchers, as I am, the points are daunting for a total amount for the pan but they come out to five points for each bar if cut into 40 bars.

This is a very flexible recipe, so long as the consistency is proper with right amount of moisture. I needed a nut-free version to put in my kids' school lunches, so I made the following changes for my first pass at this: I halved the recipe; I used sunflower butter and no peanut butter; I added: flaked coconut, some chia seeds, sunflower seeds, and (because I had no chocolate chips on hand!), a few crunched up kit kat rectangles for chocolate and crunch. I also put the mixture into small silicone molds, and baked 8-10 minutes at 375 degrees. My kids (and husband) loved them.  

Next time, I am going to add chopped up dried apricot or raisins. Based on how these came out, I think you can throw in whatever your family likes, just make sure you have enough (but not too much) honey and peanut/sunflower butter for moisture, but not too wet. I found the consistency should be akin to a chocolate chip cookie batter before you cook it! Enjoy!

Great bars.  I made them for a quick breakfast/snack alternative for my college son. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

**Update - These are so good.  The serving size is big enough, you can eat just a half and have a nice snack.  I'd rather eat these than a pre-packaged bar anytime.

There is just way too much peanut butter and honey making these really heavy and sweet. Even my husband who loves peanut butter and honey sandwiches was a bit overwhelmed. I will plan on making there again because I like the ingredients but will definitely cut the peanut butter down to 1 cup and the honey to only 1/2 cup.

Thought this was very good as I'm looking for a recipe with flax seed to hide the taste since I don't care for the taste of flax but need to take flax.  The mixture of flavors works well and you can be creative with what you have on hand.  I didn't have chocolate chips so used peanut butter chips, and chopped walnuts instead of almonds.  I think next time I will cut the flax in half.  1 cup = 48 tsp which I split into 24 bars but still could be halved.  Individually wrapped in saran wrap and keep a few in the fridge for quick snack and the rest in the freezer where it's keeping well.

I made a few changes.  I  used 1 1/2 cups rice Krispies and 1/2 cup oats in place of the 2 cups of oats.  I also did what another reviewer did and in place of honey used brown sugar and syrup.  I microwaved the corn syrup, brown sugar and peanut butter before adding the dry ingredients to make it easier to mix.  No cranberries so added honey roasted peanuts.  Also added a touch of vanilla extract to the microwaved ingredients.  I didn't add the almonds either.  The mix was a little wet so ended up added just a bit more oats. Turned out pretty good!

A great soft granola bar recipe! I did swap raisins for dried canberries. Still turned out well. They were easy to make and gone after a weekend. Will definitely make again!

These are really good. Although I made a few additions to mine I still feel this recipe warrants five stars. To mine, I added whey protein powder, chia seeds, and used powdered peanut butter instead of regular peanut butter. I wanted to cut way down on fat and calories thus allowing for the few additions without going crazy on those added calories. My batch made 22 bars and they are thick bars too. Thanks for sharing your recipe. Its one I'm going to make many more times.

I love these! They're easy and quick, too! I didn't really make any changes to the recipe. I mixed up the honey, peanut butter, and flax seed together first, then added the other ingredients and mixed with my hands. To push it down into the pan, I got on a chair to give myself more leverage so I could really pack it down. After I cut and wrapped them, I kept them in the fridge. I've made them for my family two weeks in a row now and they keep disappearing! Very delicious.

When your kids give it thumbs up and want it for lunch snack, its a winner.  My kids are 16 & 20 very athletic.  Great source of energy and protein.  Super easy to make and can tweak for different flavours.

A little crumbley, I might add a tiny bit of coconut oil or a tbsp more of peanut butter. I used part pb & part almond butter & I was out of cranberries so I used raisins & they were still yummy!!

I made these last year around Christmas time.  I gave them out along with other treats and goodies.  They were a big hit.  Easy to make,  inexpensive and they store well for a long time.

Quick, easy and kids love it.  That's 5 stars in our house.  I substituted unsalted sunflower seeds for the almonds and coconut (unsweet) for the cranberries.

Everyone loves this! I use hemp seeds, raw pumpkin seeds, raw sunflower seeds. It's a healthy, easy alternative to the traditional marshmallow peanut butter energy bar.

I'm not sure what went wrong, but this was just way too gooey and sticky.  I added about 3/4 of a cup of grated coconut to get it to the right consistency, and after that, it was pretty good.  I ended up rolling it into bite-sized balls, rolling each ball in more coconut, and then refrigerating.  It ended up pretty tasty; I just can't give five stars to the recipe as is.

I have made this recipe over and over and over again! Thank you for posting this recipe! It has become a staple! Plus it is so so easy to switch up, and so so hard to mess up! I have added and omitted ingredients several times, and my husband, my friends and I have enjoyed the variations. I love how the flaxseed makes them healthier than your average granola bar. 

Here are some of the changes I have sometimes made:
~Trade Craisins for raisins
~Trade honey for maple syrup
~Omit the nuts (only if already using crunchy PB)
~Use creamy PB and add nuts
~Omit chocolate chips (if I don't want them too sweet)
~Add coconut flakes
~Add pumpkin spices in the fall (MMM!)

We LOVE these! My husband rarely eats breakfast, and when I started making these, he said, "I'd eat THESE for breakfast!" He regularly requests them, and we love eating them after working out or just as a snack. If you are questioning making them, don't hesitate! Just go for it!

I substituted the peanut butter for almond butter, and the almonds for raisins since I'm not a huge peanut butter fan, and I didn't want almond chunks. Tastes pretty great. And got the sons "double-thumbs-up"

These turned out great but a little sticky.  I think that was because the peanut butter was quite runny.

Absolutely delicious!  Even my, "I don't eat healthy", friend loved them. I strongly suggest using disposable gloves. It was so much easier to mix and press into the pan. In fact I mixed and pressed in the same dish. Less washing!!

Very easy to make.  Easy to add other ingredients.  Made it for my family and daycare kids, and all but one loved them.  Definitely will make these again.  I added dried cherries, ground flax seed, and mixed nuts.  I also cut these into much smaller pieces than in the original recipe.

I added two tablespoons of raw cacao powder, half a cup of coconut shavings, and only used a cup of peanut butter. I also ran whole almonds through my Nutribullet for a rough chop. Holy , delicious. I will never buy granola bars as long as I live. Endless possibilities here. Thank you, Jcn.

These are awesome! Great with raisins and coconut too. I left out the flax and added about a tablespoon of cocoa. I mixed with my hands and formed them into balls (dip hands in water to keep from sticking). Love them with coffee in the morning or with milk for a healthy sweet treat. Great snack for kids too!

Great flavor, and easy enough to mix and match other fruit, etc. to accommodate whatever you have on hand. They're very soft, almost like a fresh fudge texture, and definitely have to be refrigerated (not great for sending in a kid's lunch, for example).  But overall, a great base recipe.

I'm a bust college student so I like to find recipes that I can make in advance and are easy. I try to plan my meals as much as I can so I'm not eating  out of a vending machine. This is definitely a WIN! They are so delicious and filling which makes for a great snack.Next time I will scale back on the honey a little more, maybe use 1/4 C instead of 1/2 like others said. It was a bit sweet for my taste. I used 1.5C steel cut oats and 1/4 C pecans because that is what I had on hand. Then, I put in 1C of creamy peanut butter and added the wheat germ. I will experiment with adding different fruit/nuts in the future.

I cut the recipe in half and used whole flaxseed instead of ground. I also used quick oats instead of rolled oats, and I added a little extra chocolate chips! It still turned out fantastic! I like that this recipe is vegan and mostly raw and easy to make. It will be my go to junk food or treat when I am in the mood!

We all liked the original recipe however it was very sweet for my tastes.  The second time I made these I changed it up a bit.  I decreased the amount of cranberries to 1/2 cup.  I also reduced the amount of honey to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk to get the ingredients to stick together.  It was still good with much less sugar!  Next time I would like to try dried cherries instead of cranberries.  Thanks for the recipe!
