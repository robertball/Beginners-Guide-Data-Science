Great! I couldn't find Asiago cheese, so I used Parmesan instead.  I also used 1 tsp. dried basil instead of fresh, 1/2 tsp. salt instead of 1/4, and 1/8 tsp. pepper instead of 1/4.  Using skim milk in the sauce is fine.  I thought 2 cloves of garlic was a bit too much - try 1 clove instead.  Thanks for the recipe!

Once you have all the ingredients ready to go, this recipe is very easy and fast to make. However, it does take a few pots and about 30 minutes to get the ingredients ready. Very delicious once it is done.

Made a few changes; the 6 year old asked if we could have it again tonight and the 10 year old, who has nothing good to say about ANYTHING these days, said "this is pretty good." Used frozen chicken tenderloins(and yes they were frozen), enough for 6, cut them into chunks, and sauted in little olive oil with 2 cloves chopped garlic. Added a fair amount of Italian Seasoning herb mix while sauteing. Covered and let cook through. Cooked pasta while sauting chicken and threw 2 heads of cut up fresh broccoli into same water as pasta for last 3-4 minutes. Drained pasta and broccoli. Put pasta and broccoli in 11x13 oval white corningware type dish. Added cooked chicken plus all juices/garlic. Made cheese sauce; used 1 1/2 times the actual recipe amount; used a container of mixed Italian Grated Cheese which contained parmesan, romano and asiago; plus I added a fair amount of freshly ground pepper to the cheese sauce. Poured cheese sauce over pasta/chicken/broccoli mix. Added addtl Italian seasoning herb mix. Combined all well. Then sprinkled a mix of breadcrumbs, garlic powder and grated cheese(Locatelli romano) over top. Covered and cooked for 10 minutes. Took cover off and cooked addtl 5 minutes or until top was a little colored. If you like ALOT of sauce on your plate then make 2x the amount called for; otherwise 1 1/2 times seemed fine.

Hmmm, I'm not quite sure what all the positive fuss is about because I was quite disappointed.  Granted it's a lower fat recipe, but it suffers from the lack of an interesting fat substitute.  I would possibly try again, but only with a bunch of changes.  First, I too would double the amount of sauce (it's way too dry with only 2 cups).  A quarter cup of flour?  Paste city.  Next time I'd try less flour coupled with an equal quantity of margarine to make the roux.  Could also add some low fat chicken broth to increase moisture and flavor.  Although asiago cheese is tasty, it's too mild for this dish.  I would use parmesan or romano next time.  One generous clove of garlic is plenty (two overwhelms).  Top the finished casserole with a sprinkling of grated cheese, then COVER the dish and bake for 15 minutes (if you don't cover it, the moisture will evaporate).  Uncover for the last 5 or so minutes to lightly brown the top.  So, I'll see how it comes out next time.

I thought this was pretty good.  I too altered the recipe.  I used parmesan instead of asiago and also added some mozarella to the sauce.  I added nutmeg to the sauce too but I still think it needed more spice.  I added more basil and garlic because I like it alot and still could have added more.  I boiled whole chicken breasts to keep them really tender and then just sliced them and layered the dish.  I covered it with mozarella too.  It might also taste good with mushrooms (though I personally am not a mushroom person) and/or sun-dried tomatoes....great Christmasy colored dish!  Overall it's a good base for a dish but a little bland.  I gave it 4 stars because it was good and with more additions could be great.

Delicious! Great subtle flavor, and the cheese sauce is rich without being too heavy. Another reviewer said they did not like the broccoli/basil combination, but I thought theh flavors mixed well! I'll definitely make this again.

I used the Ragu parmesan and mozzarella cheese sauce instead of the one in the recipe.  It was very easy to make and everyone liked it. I would make this again!

I think this recipe is great!  And the cream sauce is lower in fat than alfredo sauce, too.  However, I thought that the sauce was a bit too thick, so next time I will try adding a 1/2 cup more milk.

Yummy.  I doctored it up with sauteed mushrooms and onions and I doubled the sauce (as recommended by others).  I couldn't find Asiago cheese so I used Parmesan and it was quite flavorful.  I also cooked the chicken with Italian seasonings to add some more flavor.  Doubling the sauce adds a lot of fat so I don't think we'll be having this tasty meal on a regular basis - boo hoo.

This was a very good recipe.  My three-year-old loved it too.  I made it in a 9x13-inch pan and it wasn't full.  I think I would prefer to make this next time in a smaller casserole dish so everything stays moister.  The flavor of this one is great though. Basil is my favorite.  Thanks for sharing.

This was absolutely delicious!  I took the advice of others and made a little extra sauce.  It would probably be great as is, but my husband loves sauce. It was great, and a terrific leftover dish.

This was a pretty simple recipe and very tasty too.

I took the advice of previous raters, sautee'd the frozen chicken tenders, and threw the broccoli in the last few minutes with the pasta.

Also, I doubled the sauce and used a mix of parmesan and mozzerella, what I had on hand. 

This was a really good Sunday dinner, next time I will add some salt & pepper (forgot to) and maybe some red chili flakes.

I debated between a 3 and 4 stars for this dish. OVerall, it was fairly good although a little bland. I added garlic powder and red pepper flakes to the sauce and it was still quite bland. Next time I make it, I will add more seasonings.

I was really disappointed here.  Too much pasta and the sauce needs to be doubled here.  The description said it was "soul satisfying" but I think it should read more like the "soul should look elsewhere."  Sorry, I just was not impressed.

I've tried this recipe several times.  You definately need to double the sauce.  I also used skim milk instead of 1% and I didn't notice a loss in flavor.  I also increased the broccoli to 4 1/2 cups.  I cut out the basil and just used a lot of spices when cooking the chicken and broccoli.  With a little variation this is a great dish.

This was very easy to make. I leave out salt due to our diet restraints, but with extra pepper we didn't miss anything (with a more refined palate the Asiago cheese is a delightful flavor not to be drown out with too many other spices). I didn't need a baking dish any larger than 10" square but there could have been a bit more sauce...it was so good and the noodles on top did dry just a bit when baking. This was very good!

This was great!  I love the Asiago cheese sauce, but it could have used just a bit more - it was a little on the dry side (to keep the calories lower, I'm sure).  Next time I will double the sauce amount, and use a bit more for this recipe and the rest for other vegetable dishes.  I will also use more broccoli next time, because I like an equal amount of veggies with my pasta.  And, a couple of cautions - I used the original amounts given for everything, but I had to use a 13 x 9 baking dish, because the 11 x 7 size given in the recipe was too small.  Also, I wasn't sure if the salt and pepper amounts were right.  Most other recipes don't have more pepper than salt, so I did it the other way.  Other than those picky details, it was great, and I will definitely make this again!

This was fabulous! I think it would be really good with fresh parmesan in place of the asiago cheese as well.

This was delicious.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and put in a smidge of red pepper flakes, added some cajun spice but I did skip the basil (mostly because we didn't have any on hand).  I did not pre-cook the chicken or the pasta as there was plenty of liquid in the milk and cheese.  It turned out perfect.  I also cooked the garlic and all the spices in with the cheese sauce.

I made this for a couple who had recently had a baby and they RAVED about it, so I made it for myself.  It was good, but other reviewers were right in that you should double the sauce.  I also added some cajun seasoning for my family.  It was good and I will make it again (on a weekend -- it takes a while to make).

mmmm, I wasn't too impressed.  The sauce had a "floury" taste that I didn't too much care for.  I may try it again and use a cornstarch white sauce instead.

I liked this recipe, but I did make some pretty major changes! I used Parm instead of the Asiago, and I kind of made a non low-fat version using some olive oil while cooking my chicken. Very good though!

What a crowd pleaser!  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used some dipping spices that I had made myself (rosemary, oregeno, thyme, basil, etc) to season the chicken.  I made just a bit extra of the sauce after reading the reviews and used 2%milk.  I served it with a ceasar salad.  It was warm and satisfying and so delicious!!  got thumbs up all around the family -- even my husband, who doesn't always like unusual cheeses.

This is excellent comfort food. Husband loved it & so did I. Following others' suggestions, I added about 3/4 c. milk to the recipe and the consistency was perfect. The next time I make it I would actually add _more_ basil and garlic, but judging from the other reviews I guess I like basil and garlic more than the average person. I also used asparagus instead of broccoli.

I was very excited about this recipe but ended up pretty dissapointed.  There was definitely not enough sauce and tasted very dry.  Not at all creamy like I had imagined.

This just didn't turn out to be as great as I'd hoped. I think the Asiago cheese was too sharp when I put it with that much garlic. (I used a pretty large clove, and it was waaay too much.) The casserole also seemed too dry. Maybe it's just our taste, but I think it would have been better with parmesan cheese.

I really liked this!!  The fresh basil and creamy sauce were delicious.  Next time I will cut back on the garlic.  I am thinking that my cloves were too big because the garlic overwhelmed the other flavors a bit.  After making this adjustment I will be making this again.  Thanks.

Very yummy; husband said its one of the best things I've ever made!  Needed more sauce for sure, but ran out of milk so used about 1/2 jar of the Ragu cheese creations sauce.  Also used frozen broccoli and increased cook time to 30 minutes.  This is a keeper!

Very good. One change though, I only added one very small clove of garlic, as I knew two would be too much. I was right. I will definetly make this again. Makes good leftovers too.

I don't know if it's because I doubled the sauce like other reviewers suggested, but this tasted a lot like lean cuisine chicken and fettucini alfredo... which is not a good thing.  It was really bland, I had to dump a ton of salt on it to get it to have any sort of consumable flavor.  I doubt I'll make this again

This is WONDERFUL. I could not believe how great this tasted and it was actually pretty easy to make. I used mozzarella cheese instead of Asiago and it worked perfectly. My husband absolutely loved it as well.

This is a really good and very healthy recipe. I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen brocolli florets and the Short-Cuts roasted chicken (1 package).  I also increased the bake time to 30 minutes and baked in a 2 quart casserole dish.  If you cannot find the Asiago cheese...you can use Romano or even mozzarella. I highly recommend this dish for a quick, easy and yummy dinner.

We thought this recipe was pretty easy to make.  However, we thought you could use a bit more of the cheese sauce.  Next time I will 1 1/2 the sauce.  We kept adding salt to kick up the flavor as well.  Quite tasty!

I loved the end result - very tasty and satisfying - but found the prep a little time consuming.  The asiago cheese sauce seemed a bit intimidating but was a breeze.  I used frozen broccoli to save time, and it worked great.  I was just happy to find a recipe that didn't rely on cream of mushroom soup!

I found this recipe relatively easy to make, using some plain grilled chicken breasts that had attained the 'leftover' status from a meal a few days earlier. Instead of using all asiago cheese, however, I substituted some romano and low-fat mozzarella, and ground a little fresh parmesan over the top of the entire casserole. My whole family seemed to enjoy it, already asking for it again!

I made this dish for sunday dinner. It was pretty good. To save time I started early in the day cooking the chicken, shredding the cheese and cutting up the brocolli. This made it all come together pretty quick when it was time to start cooking. I served it with a big green salad and that was all we needed.

This is a pretty good casserole for left-over chicken.  I added crushed up fried onions and more of the Asiago cheese on top.

Really great recipe! I made my cheese sauce into more of a cheddar sauce though. I did this by making a roux, and added sauteed onions, and evaporated milk. I then added 2 kinds of cheddar cheese, a splash of white wine, and a couple squirts of Dijon mustard. Turned out great! Oh, to save time, I didn't steam my broccoli, and I didn't precook my chicken chunks. I just baked it for about 35 mins at 350 and it came out great :)

We didn't like this at all.  I think it was probably the cheese, though, so I gave it 3 stars, because if you like Asiago you'll probably love it.

For a light recipe, this dish came out a bit heavy.  I took everyone else's advice and doubled the sauce -- perhaps this is why.

Agree with the comments about the need for more sauce...I would double it (if I ever made it again).  Just thought it was very bland.  Needed some sort of "kick"
