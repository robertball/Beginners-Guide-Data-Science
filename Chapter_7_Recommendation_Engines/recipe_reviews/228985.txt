Outstanding recipe, worthy of any Five Star restaurant!  The cabernet-cherry vinaigrette is absolutely delicious.  This really is NOT a complicated recipe.  It looks like there are a lot of steps, but you can be doing more than one step at the same time.  I was a little concerned about the marinade ingredients not being enough to marinade 4 steaks, so I added an extra tablespoon of EVOO & porto, which was a good call. I also didn't have any radishes on hand, so I used 3 green onions instead.  Other than those changes, I followed the recipe to a "T".  Just an awesome salad, and one that I won't forget!

I agree with the other poster that this is not a difficult recipe...just more steps (which is great because it breaks it down and therefore easily manageable).  

I have been experimenting with microfarming here in the city and I enjoyed using my fresh mesclun salad mix that I just harvested the day before.
