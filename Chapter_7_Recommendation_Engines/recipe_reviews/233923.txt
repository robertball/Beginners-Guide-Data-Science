So good on a cold night!!  Fast to prepare, only bakes for 15 min.  Used a combo of jalapeño monterey jack and cheddar, added just a touch of salt, used all the red pepper flakes and my 7 year old really liked it.  Had to make the lime juice and cilantro tomatoes out of a pint my own- seemed to work!!

Instead of Rotel, I used 15  oz can of fire roasted tomatoes and along w the black beans I used 1.5 cans fat free refried because I used 1.5 lbs ground chuck. Added salt and increased the other seasonings, extra grated cheddar and topped w crushed tortilla chips and sliced black olives since I stuck with the 6 flour tortillas. Baked a little longer as I added the chip topping and olives later. Very good and fast and doesn't dirty up a ton of pans! Next time I may serve atop a bed of shredded lettuce for a healthier one dish meal, tostada style.

Soooo good! I made this with ground turkey and low carb tortillas for a low fat option. It was sooo delicious. When there was just a tiny bit of leftovers left, I through it in with some spinach and salsa for a taco salad.

This is SO Good! I doubled the recipe using 2 lbs of ground Turkey instead of beef and nobody knew the difference. Had such a good flavor with the turkey. However, I only used one can of the Black Beans and One can of the Corn.  I could only  find the RoTel w/green chilies, so I chopped fresh cilantro and added the  juice of one  lime.  I used soft yellow corn tortillas so it's Gluten Free.  I layered it like this:  a generous layer of the Turkey mixture, then shredded Mexican cheese blend,  on top of that. Then 6 Tortillas. Layered the rest  of the meat mixture . Then another 6 Tortillas. Added Mexican Cheese blend on top of the tortillas. Baked for 20 min. Sprinkled sliced black olives on the top. Served with sour cream. Everyone loved it.

The flavor was really good, but the flour tortillas turned go a gooey nasty mess! I will make this again, just use crisped corn tortillas or tortilla chips.

This was so easy to make and such a tasty dish.  I had my doubts about it, but thought I would try it based on the reviews.  I omitted the corn because my husband isn't crazy about it, but it was delicious.  I love these kind of recipes that taste like you spent a lot of time making it, but are really a quick dinner option.  This is going into my recipe box and I have already shared it with others.

I've made this twice now within two weeks and find it a nice improvement over a hamburger helper type meal.  Very easy and tasty and enjoyed by all.  It's more of a mexican lasagna than quesadialla.  We serve it with a salad on the side and it's a wonderful combination.

My family has been making this since the 1960's without the beans and corn. I have added the corn and also have used corn tortillas. We make it in a deep casserole with large tortillas and only the Rotel tomatoes.  We layer a little meat sauce on the bottom then a tortilla, meat sauce, cheese, tortilla, etc. 

We got this recipe from a friend in 1960 -- long time and long loved.  

It is a great, quick dinner recipe with a salad.

Love it!!

I made it just as published, as I believe all recipes should be before they are modified. This was truly awesome, I cannot lie. The whole family, from grandparents to toddlers, loved this. A great blending of flavours, and all from things you already have in your pantry! Win, win!

I do like this recipe but feel it needs a few changes. Corn tortillas go well with the other ingredients. I use a whole package (8) and fried them lightly  (a needed missing step). My first tortilla layer is on the bottom to make serving easier.  I double the chili powder and add chopped olives. I used plain chopped tomatoes but added the juice of a lime and 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro.  I used frozen corn but I'm sure canned corn would work as well. This makes a hearty, yummy meal.

I omitted the green chilies and used one can of  (6oz) tomato sauce(1 can of water from the sauce can and used a 1/2 of taco seasoning with 1/4 the water. (Note, the recipe calls for 2 cans of sauce but I dont like too much red sauce bc of the acidicfactor. I also used frozen corn instead of can. And I used only about 1 1/2 cup cheese (not 2 cups). Lastly, I used about 8 tortillas. It came out flavorful, juicy but not too dry. I used a 1/4 teaspoon  of red pepper. I dont like too spicy foods. I made a side of guacamole and low fat sour cream as add ons. It was even better the day after. The dish was scraped clean and everyone enjoyed.

I previewed the reviews and used corn tostada rounds.  I liked the flavor and it was good for leftovers.

This was super easy and makes wonderful leftovers! I added adobo  and lime juice. There was a lot of liquid on the bottom of the pan after baking, definitely from the lime juice but also from the chiles and tomatoes. Be sure to drain everything really well, and use corn tortillas (or stale flour tortillas!) if you have them.

I didn't have the onion, green chiles, oregano, and swapped minced garlic for powder garlic and the dish turned out great. We'll be eating this again!

I use low carb wheat tortillas (Cedar's) and it turns out great. I also use ground turkey instead of beef. Always a hit.

This turned out really good, quick to make too.  I made a few adjustments to decrease the heat: 1 can diced tomatoes instead of Rotel plus 1/2 can of green chilies, decreased chili powder to 1/2 teaspoon, decreased chili pepper flakes to a few shakes. I also used whole wheat tortillas and skipped the beef.  It had great flavor, will make this again for sure.

This came out absolutely delicious! I couldn't find the Rotelli can of diced tomatoes so I just used a plain can instead. I also put about a teaspoon of lemon juice, and a teaspoon of sugar.  I didn't have any cilantro but it still came out great.  This will be a new staple for me.

Yes. this definitely looks like McCormick's recipe, BUT McCormick no longer provides this recipe on their website, so I really appreciate it being posted here. I make this casserole all the time and am thankful it is available on Allrecipes!

Have made this several times. Always a favorite with my family. It's a pretty forgiving recipe as long as you don't burn anything. For example, we don't have Rotel tomatoes, but regular canned tomatoes seem to work pretty well.

Tastes sort of like Mexican chili with tortilla.  It was good.  I made it with fresh cilantro and lime juice and added Italian tomatoes and chili black beans.

Keeper! I did use salsa in place of the canned tomatoes, and used Mexican cheese mixture instead of cheddar cheese and it turned out perfect! My husband raved about it, and when he does you know it's a keeper and he said it was.

I used corn tortillas and cut them to fit the 9x13 pan.  Made 3 layers.  Used 4 cups total Mexican cheese.  Unbelievably delicious.  This is a new family favorite.

We liked although we thought it should have more then the 6 flour shells. Maybe add scallions next time. Easy dish to put in the oven for a short time. Thanks

I made this last night and it was delicious!  The only changes I made were adding jalapenos (wanted some heat) and not adding oregano (didn't have any).  Served it with sour cream and taco sauce, and a fresh fruit salad on the side.  My whole family loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

We all enjoyed it, I had to alter it a bit only because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I had black eyed peas in place of black beans. And my tortillas were spinach and garlic, it's what I had.  It came our very tasty, and I got compliments even from a picky eater.

The difference between 3 stars and 5 + stars is keeping in both the green chile peppers IN ADDITION to the Ro-Tel AND stepping up the heat w/ the right pinch of red pepper flakes ( crushed or whole--your call on that ).

Used both black beans (rinsed & drained) & prepared chili beans.  Doubled the cheese, using both shredded jalapeno  cheddar & shredded mexi-blend.
YUM!

I made this for a get together for a group of 15, I had to make one vegetarian.  Used pinto beans for the vegetarian and got many compliments from the vegetarians that it wasn't "lacking" anything. Will  make again sometime.

Didn't make any recipe additions, but I didn't have any corn, chilies or garlic.  Made it anyway and wow was I surprised it was so good.  Very little left over and will certainly make again and adding the extra ingredients to see how much different it will be.

This was surprisingly good.  Don't shoot me, I did make a 
change in that I added a can of refried beans into the hamburger mix, oh, and I used kidney beans because I didn't have black beans.  I think the recipe would be very good just as written, however.  I'll make this one again.

This was an awesomely easy dish to make and to eat.   Everyone in the house loved it - very my VERY picky 13 yr grandson.    He said "definitely make this again".      I had no problem with what some said were soggy tortillas and I followed the recipe exactly.

I made this just like the recipe said with two exceptions. I used ground pork instead of ground beef because that is what i had. For the cheese I used a combination of pepper jack and Mexican cheese. I have three teenagers one of which is very picky. She made the comment she didn't even care that it had onions in it. :) We topped it with sour cream and it was delicious!

This recipe has good flavor and I've made it several times. However, the tortillas tend to get mushy and by the next day (leftovers) they are almost doughy. I think I'll try using tortilla chips instead.

I will definitely make this again. I did make some minor changes. I reduced the amount of beef and cheese, for health reasons. I will use ground turkey next time. I used fresh garlic cloves, cooked with the meat and onions, rather than garlic powder. I used whole wheat tortillas for health. The store didn't have the kind of tomatoes called for, so I used stewed tomatoes and squeezed a lime in the mixture. The meal was delicious and made enough for 6 to 8 servings. I portioned four servings and froze them for future use.

This is a super simple, and quick meal, that tasted wonderful. I followed the recipe, but did add a packet of taco seasoning, as it was a little too bland for our tastes. I will say that the 1/2 cup of meat mixture was not enough to cover the bottom of a 13x9. I didn't measure, but probably used a 1/3 of the total meat mixture for each layer. I didn't have small tortillas on hand, so I cut up three 10" ones in quarters and used those. This is very similar to how I used to make tacos (adding diced tomatoes, beans and corn) until my picky eater discovered plain tacos. This is a great recipe that my family will add to our rotation of Taco Tuesday meals.

I made a great discovery when I went to buy flour tortillas - street tacos. They are the perfect size tortilla for this dish. There are 12 in a package so I put 6 for each layer; they just touch at the edge. For the cheese, I used pre-sliced pepper jack for the first layer and pre-sliced Havarti on the top layer since I didn't have cheddar. I covered the dish to bake it, then uncovered it and cooked another 5 minutes. This made a perfect-looking 6 servings (I should've taken a pic). Oh, I used 1-1/4 lbs. ground beef and 2 cans Ro-tel tomatoes (10 ozs each), plus the other ingredients as called for. I think the sauce layers need to be more than 1/2 cup. The 4 stars is due to the tortillas turning out on the gummy side so I may try corn tortillas next time. Otherwise, very tasty.

Added extra enchilada sauce, as I did not have enough cheese and needed something to cover everything with. Also had bigger tortilla, so I used only 4. They covered whole surface well.
Overall this made me think of lasagna, and you need to serve and eat it like one.

I made this exactly as written with one exception, I used high protein tortillas, 3 for the whole dish. It is now a family favourite.

This dish had good flavor.  I only used one layer of tortillas and one layer of cheese. It turned out well, was easy to make and my husband enjoyed it too. I would make it again - and it was great for leftovers!

I wished I’d had doubled the meat to compensate for the beans that I did not add. The dish is very tasty! Next time I’ll make the adjustment and maybe add some sour cream in the layers.

I’m one of those “meal planners” that fails to really meal plan. I knew I had ground beef thawed, but until I came across this recipe, I had no idea I’d make it. Great choice! Flavors were wonderful, easy prep, easy clean up. I did have to sub a few things because I didn’t have it, I but I feel that this recipe was so well written, I thoroughly enjoyed my subs. I didn’t have Rotel, so I subbed hone-canned tomatoes, fresh lime juice from one whole lime, and fresh cilantro. I also didn’t have any of the chili’s, so I subbed fresh jalapeños. I was not disappointed!!! I truly enjoyed the freshness of the subs and the added color. Unfortunately, my whole family is sick, so I hope this recipe is even better as leftovers. I am a bit concerned with the tortillas being soggy; no one in this house can stand soggy breads/breadings. Give this recipe a whirl, it’s pretty tasty!

Really really good! The only recommendation I have is to drain the sauce (or some of it) from the tomatoes. I didn’t see it mentioned in the recipe, but mine turned out a bit more watery than I’d have liked due to the tomato juice. Excellent casserole though!

Very tasty and simple to make.  Couldn't find Rotel so used regular diced tomatoes and added the juice of one lime and cilantro.  Omitted the chiles.   Used corn tortillas with the initial layer on the bottom followed by beef mixture and cheese.  Will make again.

very yummy and easy to make! would be fun to play with and mix and match different ingredients. I used a yellow Bell pepper instead of corn since I had no corn. also uses tomato paste vs sauce which worked well!

I’ve tried it with both flour and corn tortillas and personally I think it’s better with flour. The corn tortillas softened too much and you couldn’t taste them. Maybe I needed to double up up the layers or crisp them prior to. The filling is similar to what I use for black bean and corn quesadillas. Use lots of cheese and sour cream. Lettuce is a good add-on as well. Very delicious meal.

My whole family enjoyed this dish. I made it with ground turkey and taco seasoning before following the rest of the directions; also used fresh cilantro and next time will add more corn. Instead of black beans I used "ranch beans" and only half of the tomato sauce called for (ranch beans are saucy) because I don't care for black beans. I will go heavier on all of the ingredients next time because it only afforded me one layer of tortillas in my pan. Extra cheese for sure. Yum! It is kind of like a Mexican lasagne. Great recipe!

Great meal idea! I used Mission brand wheat, low-carb tortillas (which did NOT become soggy as others worried about), 1 lb. of ground chuck beef, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of Bush's chili kidney beans, taco seasoning instead of individual herbs, two cans of Rotel (one with lime and cilantro, the other original), and then just a little sprinkling of corn (mostly for color). The cheese used was Colby. Turned out terrific! Top each serving with sour cream, with a side of avocado and grape tomatoes.  :) Will be making this again!

This is a PHENOMENAL recipe!  Just wonderful.  I didn't change a single thing, which is super rare for me.  I ate mine as-is but my husband topped his with sour cream.  Either way- pure deliciousness and so quick to throw together on a weeknight!  I did use 9 tortillas rather than 6 but they were on the small side.

This is like a TexMex beef casserole!  Switched our the flour tortillas for corn tortillas, and I added a roasted and chopped up big fat poblano.  Like so many other recipes, it's entirely customizable to anyone's tastes!

All of my picky eaters loved this recipe!  I did a few things differently since I do have picky eaters.  I used taco seasoning, onions, garlic powder, and chili powder.  I used a bag of frozen corn instead of the beans.  It was a hit and we will definitely have it again!

We really liked this, altho I did make a couple of changes. Used monterey jack cheese (personal preference), frozen corn instead of canned, and refried beans instead of black beans to hide them from picky son. He would have noticed the black beans and not touched it.  It was delicious.

I started with a layer of tortillas on the bottom of the pan (like noodles at the bottom of a lasagna), then spread refried black beans on the tortillas, then meat/veg mixture (minus black beans) and cheese, repeat. Swapped ground turkey for beef and still had great flavor. Served with a dollop of Greek yogurt. Delicious!

My wife liked this a ton.  She's not a big foodie so when she likes something - we keep the recipe.

I omitted the black beans and corn (just because I don't like them) came out great.  What's cool about this recipe is that you can make the casserole the night before and pop it in the oven when you get home.

This casserole was an instant success with my family and has been added to our regular menu rotation. I didn't have a can of black beans, so I used Ranch Style beans instead. Also didn't have a can of green chilis handy so I substituted chopped roasted red pepper.  A small dollop of sour cream on the side makes this stand-alone casserole a Tex-Mex flavor to die for!

This dish is absolutely delicious. I added a tablespoon of sour cream to each plate upon serving it. I accidentally put 1 tbsp of chili powder instead of 1tsp. The spice was perfect. Even my 2 year old loved it.

Made this for Christmas eve brunch and it was a hit. If anyone you've invited doesn't like spicy food, either use only one ten-ounce can of the tomatoes with lime and cilantro. Or you could just substitute plain diced tomatoes. Leftovers freeze well.

Easy and made with ingredients I had at home so just a few changes - no green chilies or full amount of tomato sauce so 2 can of Rotel instead.  Served with lettuce and tortilla chips.

I didn't use Rotel or red pepper flakes (even though I desperately wanted to) only because I have a toddler who can't handle the spiciness. I also used corn tortillas instead of flour ones. STILL, it was very delicious! I will be making this again.

I did not care for this recipe, strictly because it was soggy and unappetizing in appearance.  The tortillas can't stand up to all the liquid and the texture of them became distracting from the filling.  I liked the actual meat mixture and, if I could find a substitute for the tortillas that would hold their texture, I wouldn't mind using the filling again. Won't make again.

Originally I made it as it stated. Now I have improved it, corn tortillas, ground chicken, no corn and layer refried beans for one layer. Side toppings  were sour cream, guacamole, green onions, black olives and jalapeños. Everyone has asked for the recipe.   Love this!!!!

I doubled the recipe. The only thing I did that I shouldn't have was put a bit too much chopped garlic (from the jar) in! Everyone raved about the casserole, but I just thought it was too garlicky for my liking! Otherwise, it was delish and a hit!

Was delicious. I put 5 corn tortillas on 2 layers overlapping. At about 5 mins left I put broken hard tostitos scoops all over the top.  My husband said it was delicious. add sourcream to each serving and hot peppers. Would definately make again. Taste like your eating a dip.

I have made this twice. The second time I deleted the chilis, but used chopped tomatoes with chilis instead of chopped tomatoes with cilantro, and I added 1 T of lime juice.   I have a picky 7 year old and he loved it.

This was awesome.  I didn't know if the leftovers would be as good but it was even better the next day for lunch.  You end up using more of the beef mixture between layers than the recipe states but there is still enough for all the layers.

First review, and I must say that this dish is outstanding! Even my 21 year old, who flat out refuses to eat anything with corn in it (despite liking corn), ate a plate sized piece!

Added 1/2 pound of Chorizo for just a little extra kick, and used corn instead of flour tortillas, but other than that followed the recipe to a "T"

I would suggest making the beef mixture a day before so that the spices really soak in. I also recommend white corn tortillas because the flour tortillas get gooey leftover.

This was a great weeknight dinner.  An easy spin on Mexican and yummy.  A little spicy so reduce the CRP if you don't like that.   Feeds  4-6 people.  Looking forward to the leftovers!

This is almost identical to  a Mc Cormack spice pack called Quesadilla Casserole.  Only difference is only green chilis are called for and not Rotel

As the author of this recipe first I’d like to say thank you so much for everyone’s generous feedback. I honestly didn’t know how popular it would become. And special thanks to Allrecipes for publishing this recipe -featuring it in there magazine and making a helpful video.Second I understand a few prefer corn it’s versatile of course you can choose some stick with flour tortillas but corn works or corn chips or tortilla chips. Mexican dishes are so easy simple but very comforting. I really do appreciate all feedback. And I’m so loving all your pictures there very enjoyable Thanks Melissa- August 2019

Given all the highly rated reviews, I was disappointed at the outcome of this recipe. I changed nothing except that I used corn tortillas instead of flour. It was very dry and totally flavorless. I love the ingredients in this because I love Mex dishes. It needed a lot more seasoning and more moisture. I'm an experienced cook, so this is worth reworking, but as-is I'm sorry but this was not good.

I made this with ground turkey. I did not have chiles or the Rotel tomatoes on hand so I used a can of chopped tomatoes instead. It was very tasty, my husband thought it was "really spicy". I think this is because of the crushed red pepper flakes and the chili powder I used which comes from the natural foods store and is quite pungent. I thought it was great. I'd make it again and use a smaller casserole 2 quart oval instead of 9 x 13.

Yes, I added frijoles instead of black beans., used enchilada sauce in stead of tomato sauce. Also used a package of taco seasoning for the meat.  It was delicious!

Not bad but definitely not great. You will have to dr. it up. the tortilla wrap gets so soggy and slimy. this dish will need a CRUNCH to it. we added corn tortilla chips on top that made it acceptable. probably won't make this again.

Very good taste, but tortillas do get soggy. Someone suggested doubling the tortilla layers and I would do that next time.

What a great meal. I did do some things different.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of ground chuck and then increased the seasoning by a half. I also put in paprika and andouille chilli seasoning.  I used Monterey Jack cheese   I will definitely make this again

I've made this recipe quite a few times now and Love it!! I did change the flour tortillas to soft corn tortillas as they held up better, the flavor was better and they didn't get gooey like the flour tortillas. I always make a double recipe and freeze one for later (unexpected company or a pot luck). You can reheat it in the morning and top it with over easy (medium) eggs for a great breakfast!! Enjoy!

I used Ro-Tel Chipotle because it had all the spices already in the can. It was a little hot for me but other people in the house like it that way, so all in all it was a win. I put extra cheese on it too since I'm a big cheese lover. Will definitely make again.

My goodness, SO GOOD. I did not add the tomatoes so the whole thing came out to be less layers... so layer of meat mixture, 3 tortillas, rest of meat mixture, and cheese. I did add lime separately since I didn't add tomatoes with lime.  10/10 would make again.

Loved this recipe. I did change it for fear it would be too soggy with soft flour or corn shells. I used crumbled corn chips. I also substituted the tomato sauce for mild salsa.
In addition, I made a small portion without the beef. It also was delish!

Very good, my husband really liked it.  Of course, there are a few tweaks I would make but nothing serious.  Most a case of what I do and do not have in the cupboard regularly.  We didn't think the tortillas came out too mushy.

We can not eat much spice/hot food so I used reg. diced tomatoes drained, juice of one lime, 1/2 can Rotel diced tomatoes rinsed and drained, no chili powder, no pepper flakes, 1/2 green Bell/Pepper diced. Everything else same as written. Very good recipe.

The basic ingredients sounded really yummy, but the flour tortillas were a bit soggy and unappealing.  Next time we will try corn tortillas.

Whole family liked the recipe- youngest is  particular and had 3 helpings! Winner! I did put tortillas as 1st layer after browning them. Had a random 1 left and just put it on top. I also served corn on the side rather than in the casserole- just my odd preferences. Didn’t want too much liquid- and like corn separate.

Excellent taste! Instead of tortillas in the casserole, they were stuffed with the filling at the table to make tacos.

It was definitely yummy! Not sure I’d call it a quesadilla casserole. It didn’t have that bite that quesadilla tortillas have. Will I make it again? Yep. I sure will. It had a great flavor and made leftovers, too!

Very delicious and easy to prepare!  I used regular canned tomatoes, so added lime juice and chopped fresh cilantro to the meat mixture.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Five stars. Very easy and tasty! My cans of black beans and corn were slightly larger, no big deal. I didn’t have any tomato sauce so I used the same volume of crushed tomatoes. They actually had Ro-tel tomatoes at my grocery store so I picked some up and looked for a recipe. Glad to find this one! And, I personally liked the softened texture of the tortillas. Will make again!

This was so yummy and very easy to make! Just the right amount of heat from the green chiles...may add jalapeno to the top the next time, since we like spicy. This one is a keeper!

Four stars ( closer to five) for flavor, but I have to agree that the  soggy, gummy texture of the tortillas is a deal breaker.  I wonder if you crisped them up in the oven first it would help?

The flavor in this dish is spectacular but the texture of the soggy tortillas is a deal breaker. I thought it would be ok based on the numerous positive reviews but I was wrong. Perhaps baking longer or at a higher temp would reduce this but I probably won't try again.

This was delicious! My nieces and nephews loved this. Just the right amount of heat. Babysitting night was a breeze with this recipe. I made it with meatless vegan meat. I added the garlic together with the onion and meatless meat and sprinkled salt and pepper. Next batch I didn’t use the flour tortillas, because the kids were eating this with chips. I also didn’t have anymore of the Rotel tomatoes with lemon, so I used a regular tomato can and 1/2 tsp of lemon juice. A nephew asked me for lettuce and sour cream. Yum! I had to make the second batch, we couldn’t stop eating it over playing UNO.

Instead of flour tortillas, I used corn tortillas.
I lightly heated them in oil first, to bring out the flavor and improve the texture, then I added them to the casserole.  I also mixed the ingredients (beans, sauces, spices, etc.) separately before I added them to the beef/onion mixture to assure that everything was mixed well first.

I didn't have enough corn, so I added a can of mixed veggies that had a bit of corn, potatoes and carrots.

I also didn't have tomato sauce, but I had tomato paste, so I  added about 1 cup of water to the paste and blended it to create the tomato sauce I needed.  Note:  make sure to know that when you first start layering it in the dish that it's 1/2 cup of the sauce (not half the sauce) that goes in first.  I had mis-read it, but luckily had viewed the video to see that not much sauce goes in the bottom.  I put more than the video showed, though and it came out fine.  Just had a plate of it -- yummy!  Added a dollop of sour cream and some scallions.

I thought this was really good!! I did however after the 15 bake time take it out and added crushed chips and some more cheese and threw  it back in for 15 more minutes! It's got a kick to it, that I like! Will make again for sure!

Absolutely wonderful for a meataaholic like me. Used frozen chopped onions, 1 1/2 cups and frozen corn. My Rotellowas only 10 ounces. Worked fine. Heated flour tortillas on the grill prior to assembling. No ‘soggy taco syndrome’. Delayed final assembly 2 hours due to spouse working OT. No problems. Will definitely keep this in my rotation. Construction was very easy using all canned components other than the beef.

We rated this an A. I used a 15 oz can of corn and a 10 oz can of Rotel. It may be a misprint but the 1/2 c of meat mixture suggested in the recipe didn't come close to covering the 9x13 pan so when layering into the casserole dish I used 1 1/2 c of the meat mixture in the first layer, 2 c in the second layer, and the remaining 2 1/2 c in the last layer and added a little more than the 1 cup of cheese in each layer or to cover. Served with sour cream, this was yummy!

My husband liked it so much, he had seconds! I used corn tortillas to prevent the sogginess that flour tortillas would have, and Borracho Beans because I’m from Texas and prefer them, but any style beans would be great. I also added salt to taste. I even sent the recipe to my son in New Zealand. This one is a keeper.

Needed green onions. Used plain Greek yogurt to calm it down for me. Spicy enough for my husband. Used tomato sauce with jalapeños, that’s all I could find. Easy to make and really good.

Will definitely make this again. I used picante instead of tom sauce, also used chips instead of soft shell. My picky eater loved it. This would also be good with chicken. Thanks for the recipe

Great, I relate with Jim from Dec.2018. I've made this so many times over the years and probably never exact same way twice. It can be varied a lot without messing up. Adjust to your taste, creativity, and what you have on hand. We have called it many names like Taco Pie, Mexican Lasagna, Enchilada Torte, Tamale Pie; etc. You can make up your own names and come out with good stuff from this as it is written. I am not a fan of raw flour tortillas in baked dishes .

A very good mexican casserole.  Family loved it.  I used the exact ingredients but my tortilla were large, so I did three layers with two tortillas instead or two layers of three. Will make again.

Instead of ground beef, I buy a roasted chicken at the supermarket and shred it. Comes out fabulous in this layered casserole. I like to add sautéed onions and lots of green Chile’s.  If I have cream cheese, I mix that in also. Perfect dish to make ahead of time. I’ve served for company and there is never any leftover!

Really liked this recipe! Used a pkg of taco seasoning for the meat and a  can of pinto beans I had on hand.  Had an extra 1/2 pound of ground  beef and added a layer. Didn't measure the amount of cheese I used but was fairly liberal with it. Covered it with foil for 15 minutes then uncovered for 10 more. I know people get mad when you change the recipe and then rate it but I never would have made it without the original. Will make again many times!

super quick to serve. used tortilla chips (had leftover fm party) and taco seasoning. no meat (thus omitted the tomato sauce) , but extra corn - basically amped up nachos.

found it better to prepare the "topping" then bake with cheese on as-need basis - otherwise the tortilla/chips got soggy as leftovers.

Quick and easy weeknight dinner. Made it instead of the usual “taco Tuesday” and everybody had two helpings. Prepared as per the recipe, just added some sliced cherry tomatoes on top for garnish. Serve with sour cream and shredded lettuce. Jalapeños and shredded pepper jack are also good additions.

This dish is really good and easy to make. I used the small corn tortillas. The soft flour kind will get soggy. I’ve also used beef instead of chicken. Still yum! Coated tortillas with retried beans. Yum. Added salsa and cream cheese, yum yum.  Thanks for posting!

This dish is really good. Lots of flavor, which is lacking in so many online recipes. I don’t care for black beans so, I substitute with either pinto or kidney. I also used white shoepeg corn because it’s more tender than yellow corn. As optional additions I sometimes add sliced black olives & top with sour cream

This was good. I didn’t have all the ingredients on handle so for there spices I added 1/4 cup taco seasoning, garlic, cilantro and red pepper flakes. Had perfect amount of heat. I probably could of used 9 tortilla shells since I have little more than a pond of hamburger. But is still came out good. I would make this again. Makes enough for dinner and lunch he next day.

Delicious! of course I'm going to be one of those people who changes then rates. I needed to use up some pulled pork so I ran it through my food processor. I subbed corn tortillas for flour and topped with cheese, crushed chips and cilantro. the flavors were awesome together and recipes like this are so easy to customize. Thanks!

Modified to use what we had on hand: used ground turkey, pinto beans instead of black beans, and fresh oregano from the garden. My son and I made it together (easy peasy.). Served with sour cream. So good.

Based on the comments I changed the flour tortillas to corn and also instead of the green chilies I added jalapenos.  It was 'warm' but very flavorful.

I loved this recipe! I did make some changes as follows: red enchilada sauce vs tomato sauce, taco seasoning packet vs all the spices in the recipe, no chopped green chilis (didn't have any), added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (1/4 cup +/-, and  2 equal packets cause I like a little sweetness!  It was beyond wonderful and I'm making it again today !!

Did not make any changes and will not make it again.   The 10 minute prep was way short of the time, more like 30 minutes.  The tortillas were too soft and really liked a true Mexican taste.

I loved this casserole!  Found it in the All Recipes magazine which seemed a bit different than what's here online but here are the few changes I made:

- Ground Turkey instead of Beef
 - Added 1/2 green pepper (chopped)
 - I used corn tortillas (and only 4 per layer instead of 6)
 - I also just used one large 1lb 12oz can of San Marzano tomatoes instead of the sauce and then the tomatoes

I also served, topped with Jalapenos and Plain Green Yogurt (in substitute for Sour Cream)

Delicious and quick!

I just added salt and pepper. It was so delicious, but too spicy for the kids, so I recommend having a few extra tortillas and cheese on hand to make them a quesadilla while you're waiting for the casserole to come out of the oven (I sprinkled in just a bit of the ground beef with onion too.) They had mild quesadillas, my husband and I had this spicy dish with margaritas and chips with salsa verde. Any liquor you have on hand mixed with a limade (frozen canned limade) makes a great margarita.

This was fabulous! I found this in the All Recipes magazine.   My only changes were I did not use garlic, green chilies, chili powder, cumin and crushed red pepper. My husband and mother in law can't eat spicy food. Instead I used garlic powder with the ground meat (I used ground turkey) and then Mrs Dash garlic and herb to help add some flavor and of course salt and pepper to taste.  Last change I used corn tortillas and shredded my cheese.  I will make again.

This was very good. I divided the recipe into 2 baking dishes so I could have a meatless, vegetarian version for my brother as well as the normal version for myself. I used pinto beans instead of black beans. The next time I make this, I will use 2 cans of chopped green chilis instead of one.

I can't take really spicy foods but I made this recipe without changing a thing.  I was surprised to find that it was actually quite bland.  I  will make it again as  my family really likes Mexican food.  But next time I will add  more spices, especially red pepper flakes and salt.  I wonder if it was a mistake that the recipe called for no salt?  Another thing I noticed is that if you add the meat layers as the recipe calls for with 1/2 cup it just isn't enough.  My layers of meat mixture were a cup and a half.  Next time I will also  use corn tortillas (more flavor). I added sour cream and everyone at the table used  salsa to add more flavor cause of the blandness. Do yourself a favor and at least add some salt when you make it.

Made exactly as written except took another reviewers suggestion and switched out flour tortillas and used corn.. My family says this is a recipe to keep and that I need to remember to make again.

A fun alternative to burritos or tacos.  After reading other reviews I used hard corn taco shells (broken in half) and they held up fairly well the next day, though I think that flour would have tasted a little bit better.  Served it with salsa, sour cream, and a diced-lettuce-and-tomato salad.

This was quite good.  I skipped the red pepper flakes since I was feeding this to a 2 year old, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I also cut down the tortillas to 3 with 1.5 on each layer to cut the calories a bit.  The meat sauce was also very good on chips.  It did seem a bit blah for taste.  Definitely needed some salt and pepper.

Good, but tastes just like you think it would taste. Just another version of a taco, all the same type of ingredients. Don't get me wrong, good winter comfort food, but don't expect it to be the height of culinary excellence on your taste buds.
