Very tasty!... But I did make a few adjustments to the recipe. I'll list them:
1.  I made this with 4 salmon portions instead of 2. This made for less sauce per portion.
2. I allowed the salmon and sauce to cook for about 15 minutes instead of 5-10 minutes. This allowed the sauce to further reduce, and the salmon did not suffer (dry out) from the extra time.
3. I cheated and added lemon pepper and dried oregano to my salmon before cooking... just my personal preference...
4. I served this over a bed of rice. The rice absorbs some of the sauce, thus reducing the amount of sauce even further.

 
I think the given recipe, with the additional 5 minutes of sauce reduction time, would produce a great meal if you like a lot of sauce (which I typically do). 

However, if you're like the rest of my family who prefer not to have salmon swimming  in sauce (no pun intended), adding rice and/or 2 more salmon portions should be sufficient fixes.

This was very easy and tasty!  The sauce did not reduce to half during 15 minutes of cook time, next time around I will go with 3/4 of a cup for the wine and the cream.  Otherwise the flavor was spot on!  Thank you!

For two 4 oz salmon portions I couldn't go the full measures, evident as I went through the cooking process.  I used 1/4 sliced onion, half the garlic, 3 patties of butter, a 1/2 cup of wine and a 1/3 cup of cream.  Going the full measures would be too much for the salmon and spinach portions.  Also no salt/pepper was called out, so I added just a pinch of each.  The sauce was plenty, much lighter than the recipe, and still very flavorful.  Trying this early after posting I wanted to follow the recipe as is but the butter and liquid measures were too much for us.

We really liked this.  Easy to make and the sauce was delicious.  I would double the garlic.  I also gave it a squeeze of lemon and used rosemary garlic seasoning, just because salmon has a stronger flavor and I wanted to soften that a bit.  Served over the bed of spinach, it had a nice presentation. I served it with asparagus and sweet potato slices in butter and a pinch of cayenne.

We read the reviews ahead of time and did use less cream and wine.  Otherwise we followed the recipe, substituting cod for the salmon.  I served it with rice and my husband loved it.  Very easy and very yummy.

Used 2 8oz filets, since thatâ€™s what I had, and the addition of mushrooms others mentioned sounded good.

I tend to use recipes as guidelines for my improvisation. Despite my minor changes - 1/2 & 1/2 for heavy cream, coconut oil to replace some of the butter - I am pleased with the outcome.

I only had about 1/4 cup of heavy cream so I used 1% milk for the rest and it was delicious. I used the left over sauce to make it again with more salmon. The second time I used a lot more spinach as it tends to wilt down to nearly nothing.

Yummy! Next time, though, I will reduce the sauce slightly before adding the salmon.

This dish was easy to make, and with the combination of ingredients it is hard to go wrong, next time however I shall not add the butter to the spinach, but lemon juice instead. I also added salt and pepper in the cooking. It was quite bland without it.

I thought this dish was incredible. Not real heavy. Pleasant change from my normal salmon dishes. Can't wait to try it again and add mushrooms.
