I really enjoyed this recipie--the chicken was mosit and very tender. I did add additional seasonings to spice the gravy up a bit--mostly more pepper and a little sage. It's a great dish for those that miss the gravy!

I worried the gravy would be bland so I spiced it up.  I also spiced up the shake and bake mix.  I added liberal amounts of Mrs.Dash, Salt, Pepper, and Garlic Powder, also I needed more flour (1/2c).  I doubled the gravy with little changes.  I made it with 2c water, flour, 4 TBS corn starch, and the fried drippings from step one.  This did the trick.  The chicken was very moist!  Very easy to make.

Thanks for the good recipe!  Will make again!

Not bad. Many viewer's said it was bland so I added Old Bay cajun seasoning and salt to give it some flavor. After browning the chicken pieces in oil I dipped them in the coating mix again to make them more sticky and a bit thicker texture cause I remove the skin from the chicken pieces.

This was YUMMY!  Even my 12 year old liked it.  We're not gravy eaters but even the gravy was absolutely delicious!  Thank you for submitting it!

This is hard to rate - overall we were pleased with the final product but that is based on making some changes.  I used "Chicken Seasoning" from Heather's Fried Chicken on this site, in the flour to coat the chicken and then more in the gravy.    (chicken seasoning mix: Stir together 2 tablespoons black pepper, 2 tablespoons garlic powder, 1 tablespoon paprika, and 1 tablespoons kosher salt.)  I heated homemade chicken stock in the dutch oven - added the milk and simmered it before adding the seared chicken.  For the chicken I just halved the chicken and cooked one half, it was not submerged in the gravy, just simmered in it. The gravy did need some more seasoning.   I am glad I made this - it has been waiting for a picture for a long time. Not sure if I would make it again though.

I am not sure what was supposed to be sticky about this chicken, but it did not go over well with my family. The gravy was VERY thin...the cornstarch mixture did nothing to thicken it. I think if I make this again I will use less water and broth in order to have a thick gravy.

This recipe was very bland, but the chicken was very tender and was SO easy to make that I had to give it 4 stars.  It's a good recipe, but I would serve it with a side dish that has a little kick!

Sooo good! We usually make two, side-by-side in a turkey roasting pan... You can get two chicks at Costco for decent price! Soo much better than store bought rotisserie chicken! We will have one for dinner, and the other, I remove the meat from it and use it for enchiladas or another chicken dish later in the week.... (if the second chicken lasts that long!! :+)

This was the first recipe I tried off of this site and I guess I could say it didn't make a very good first impression. We ate this and I don't think anybody was pleased. Yes, the chicken was tender but anything that you leave in the oven for an hour with that much liquid would be. I guess what I am trying to say is that it was so very plain!

It did make gravy but the dish was bland, next time I would zip it up with some spices, that would probably change the rating!

Joe, this is a great recipe.  Made it today and my husband loved it and so did I.  I made 2 modifications, firstly I never had any green beans so I didn't add them and second I added seasoning salt with no MSG to the vegtable layer, the potatoe layer and to the chicken breast layer.  Next time I will add one can of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of water instead of 2 chicken broth. I used seasoned breasts so there was no worry of the chicken being dry. Recipe is great, thank you so much for sharing..

This was yummy! I did everything in a cast iron skillet and it turned out great. I used more seasoning in the flour mixture such as garlic powder, onion powder and thyme. I only cooked 4 chicken thighs, and still made the same amount of milk and broth for the gravy. After browning chicken, I placed them on a plate, drained off oil, and returned chicken to skillet and added the milk and broth. I didn't use cornstarch to thicken, I used the seasoned flour I coated the chicken with and water!

Easy to prepare- yes.  You will need additional cornstarch slurry to make the gravy have a consistency that is consistent with gravy!  The gravy as is- extremely bland.  It was OK after I spiced it up a good bit with salt, pepper etc.  To say that this is anything like fried chicken is deceiving.  The skin is limp and soggy, however I really did not expect it to be different based on the preparation.  This chicken was moist but I have found other recipes that yield moist yummy chicken that are just as easy.  This one will not be saved in my recipe box- sorry Joe.

We really enjoyed this. I used boneless chicken breasts (what I had on hand). I cut the breasts in half. Also since there was only 2# of chicken, I halved the liquids. May use whole amount of liquids next time, as there was not alot of gravy. Chicken was moist and tasty, went great with mashed potatoes.

I was in a "what to make...what to make" frenzy when I came across your recipe.  I added some frozen vegetables and served it over white rice.  It was DELICIOUS!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe...it's a keeper!
