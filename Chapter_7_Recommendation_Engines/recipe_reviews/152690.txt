I am first of all a long time yeast dough maker and familiar how things should be done.  These are excellent!  Because I have a dough hook, I put all wet ingredients including the butter (I warmed it with the milk)...then the dry ingredients from smallest amounts to the largest.   Dough is slightly wet, and it would not hurt to add a little extra flour, perhaps a 1/2 cup.  
I also egg washed (beaten egg with 1 TBL water)and brushed them.  The rolls shined  coming out of the oven.  Will make these again.  Urge you to give this a try.

Followed the directions exactly and got nice fluffy, beautiful dinner rolls!  Everybody loved them and they made great little sandwich rolls the following day.  Watch the quantity though, this recipe makes 36 rolls which is a lot of rolls for a small family!  I cut the recipe in half and still got 20.  Also if you are having a hard time getting the dough to rise while in the bowl, heat up your oven and then turn it off and leave the bowl of dough to rest on top of your oven door while the door is open, it helped my dough to rise.   Will definitely make again!

These are FANTASTIC!!!!
The dough is very sticky, and I did have to use about an extra cup of flour.
I used my KitchenAid Artisan stand mixer, and note to those of you who own the same model: there is too much dough for this size mixer and it got jammed all up in the arm.  I had to stop the machine, divide the dough into two piles, and knead each one separately and then tossed them together in a bowl.  Excellent, excellent, and excellent! They are soft and pillowy and turn out HUGE!  I rolled my dough into the smallest of balls and they turned out the size of bakery muffins.  My one and only (minor) qualm: I will add more salt to the recipe next time.  Perhaps a half teaspoon and see how that goes.  Thank you though, these are the rolls I've been looking for!

very easy!  I'm not a bread maker but these turned out much better than store bought. I think I might try a bit more flour next time as one reviewer stated.  The dough was very wet. Not so easy to work with. I found out you can make these the day before and freeze.  I put them into a greased 8x8 pyrex dish and froze them just before the final raise. The next day it took about three hours to thaw and raise before they were ready for the oven. I don't know how well a larger dish would work though as the rolls in the middle took longer to thaw and raise than the ones on the outside. But they were delicious!

These are amazing! A few comments for some of the problems others have mentioned below:

If you knead the dough it will get too chewy and  will  not rise as much. So seriously, mix just like you would a muffin batter, easy does it.

Butter your hands to shape. And use that flour you were tempted to add for working into balls.

Go easy on the salt. Salt enhances flavor but it also slows the yeast growth down. Too much salt will kill your yeast and result in heavy dense roles that just don't rise. No more than 4 - 5 tsp.

About that flour. Use All Purpose for these, not bread flour. Too much gluten give a firm crumb. The goal here is pillowy softness.

Humidity and storage time can all affect how much moisture your flour  needs, not the other way around. Think of the dough like pie crust and wait until the final shaping to add additional flour. Just use a stout spoon to punch down. Again, no kneading!

Big batch means more to freeze! After the final rise before shaping, scoop out as much as you want to bake right away and stash the remaining dough in the fridge. Shape and let the rolls rise. Now, Line a cookie sheet with wax  paper. Shape balls of dough and position on the paper without touching and put in the freezer. If you don't have room for multiple pans, stash the remaining dough in the fridge and set up a production line.

Congrats you now have rolls, the making of monkey bread, breadsticks, you name it.  Store in a plastic bag or tub.  Thaw, covered and shape and bake.

The rolls tasted good, but I would bake them in a bigger baking dish next time. I had to throw out 2 of the center ones because they just wouldn't bake and the rest of them were already really brown on the top and bottom.

I've made these twice. First time I was impatient and let the dough rise only once before shaping into rolls. Second time I replaced half flour with whole wheat flour. Both times they were delicious but the recipe dose need more flour.

I had these at my mom's house and had to have the recipes.  I used my bread machine on the dough cycle and cut the recipe by half (except used 4 C flour) and they were really good.  Not quite as good as mom's, but maybe that is because someone else made them!  Thanks.

I cut this recipe in half to 18 servings. I also used my Kitchen Aid to make these rolls. I just proofed the yeast in my mixer bowl with the warm milk and sugar for ten minutes, then added the egg, melted butter and dry ingredients. This needed just a touch more flour to get it to form a non-sticky ball, just over a quarter cup. I kneaded it for five minutes with my dough hook, then set it to rise in a greased bowl on a warm heating pad. This was quite slow to rise, it took almost two hours to double. After I formed the rolls, I plopped them in greased muffin tins, covered it with saran wrap and let them rise again. It took over an hour to double. I did NOT get 18 rolls out of a half recipe, I got eleven smallish rolls. The rolls were wonderful, fluffy and very tender--the flavor of them was fabulous. I just wish that they'd risen a little bigger. That's not a deal breaker, the rolls turned out just fine irregardless.

Excellent. I made just half the recipe (using 4 full cups of flour) and it turned out superb. As everyone says, very light, very fluffy. If you're getting a dense roll, you're not rising long enough. This does need a little more salt.  I added a full teaspoon for half the recipe and it still tasted like it needed 1 1/2.  This roll has a yeasty flavor but I love since it really spells homemade. I mixed and kneaded the dough with the KitchenAid mixer. When forming the dough, spray your hand with PAM to avoid sticking. This is a fairly wet, sticky dough, but adding more flour as your knead and form into balls only makes the bread tougher.  Mine baked for 14 min. before it was done.  10 min. is definitely not long enough. I will definitely make again. *Update* - I'm eating these the 2nd day and WOW, they are still super moist!  I was expecting something dried out, but it's so moist you can eat it plain and cold. Awesome.

This was a easy recipe to follow.  I made them with Potato soup for a dinner party and everyone loved them.  Thanks for the good recipe!  I will be using these rolls for more parties.

These taste oddly close to the Texas Roadhouse Rolls, and they were awesome with cinnamon butter (butter, powdered sugar, and cinnamon).  I havled the recipe and got 12 big rolls.  They were sweet, light, and fluffy!

YUMMY!
I used about 3 cups whole wheat flour and about 5-6 cups white flour... just because I don't care for plain white. 
I also melted the butter into the milk on the stove, also adding the sugar and salt..... and proofed my yeast that way.... only because that's how my Dad taught me. That may help with the "yeasty" taste too because I didn't find that at all.
I bake bagels for a living so inches don't do me well for size... I weighed each piece to about 2 to 2 1/4 oz and got a 10x14 and an 8x8 pan full... totaling 33 very good sized rolls.
Next time I will go a bit smaller, about 1 1/2 oz and use the 10x14 and a 9x13.

Followed the recipe exactly - came out with "rolls" that were golden brown on top and gooey in the middle.... now trying to salvage to have some sort of bun with the beef dip... since the buns are key in that dinner. The parts that cooked tasted ok, but I am very dissapointed with the results.

Wow, these are good rolls with just a hint of sweetness.  First of all I halved the recipe since I planned on using the breadmachine and felt it couldn't handle the 7 cups of flour.  Plus increased the yeast to 2 1/2 teaspoons after reading reviews which stated the rolls did not rise properly.  The dough was way too sticky so additional flour was needed to form a proper ball.  Once the dough cycle was completed I formed into rolls, let rise till doubled and baked at 350* for approx. 22 mintues.  Yield was 9 large rolls in a 9 x 9 pan.  Thanks for sharing your aunt's recipe, Cristy!!

I made these for Easter dinner and have craved them every day since.  I love a yeasty roll!  I made a half recipe (using 1 envelope of yeast) and still got 24+ decent-sized rolls.  The only other change I made was to let it rise only twice in the bowl, and then once after the rolls were formed.  Didn't notice anything lacking, and saved probably an hour's time.

For all the people saying they needed more flour I have to disagree. This is the right amount, if you want light fluffy rolls. If not don't go overboard on extra flour, also I recommend kneading for a while, you'll get a sticky dough but as soon as it rises it will be the perfect consistency. I made pizza rolls out of this that were to die for, not too tangy, not to sweet, fluffy, beautiful...I made a batch that should have lasted a week, but instead lasted a day and a half.

Delicious rolls!  I used only 1 packet of rapid rise yeast for the whole recipe.  I found the easiest way to shape rolls from the sticky dough was to do this:  dump portions of dough on to a floured surface, sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough, flatten a bit with hands or rolling pin, use pizza cutter to cut into little square pillows, and then transfer to greased pan.  Perfect!

These are great. I really had to control my urge to knead the dough. I read through twice to make sure I hadn't missed something! I learned long ago to always add the last cup of flour sparingly, and did the same with these. I used some of that last cup to dust the top of the dough and my knuckles for the first punch down. (I also scraped the dough away from the sides and bottom at that point, and dusted the bowl also, which made the next 2 punchdowns quicker and cleaner. Also, please note that you will need much more than a 9X13 pan. Either about 3 of that size, or a large cookie sheet.

These rolls were a little crispy on the outside, and soft in the inside. They were delicious! I cut the recipe in half since it was just 2 of us. I got 8 big rolls. I did have to use one extra cup of flour. I baked them at 400 for 17MINS. Some people were saying that their rolls were undercooked, but that's because you need to leave them in there a bit longer.

I arranged these in a Christmas tree shape as I was serving Christmas Eve. Brushed them w/melted butter when done and sprinkled with a mixture of parmesan cheese, italian seasoning and garlic powder. Yummy!

I'm eating one still hot from the oven while I type this. I made the recipe exactly as written, except I didn't brush melted butter on the top. The rolls are incredibly soft and not too dry. This is my new favorite recipe for rolls.

Delicious roll recipe. Just the perfect amount of sugar so that it doesn't make the rolls too sweet but adds flavor. The only problem I had was the cook time and temp. My rolls were not done on the inside but browned on the outside and I had to throw them back in the pan and into the oven for a little while longer but that is something I can remedy by adding a longer time and maybe lowering the temp to 375. Very good and I will use this recipe for rolls for now on!

Yum, needs more flour and needs egg bath before hitting the oven.

This was one of my first times making bread. I halved the recipe for just me and my husband. I was a little nervous because the dough was sticky so I didn't know if I did something wrong.In the end it turned out so good! My husband kept going back for more!

* first let me say, I think steps 3 and 4 are switched.  You should preheat the oven and grease the pan THEN roll them into little balls.  Ok, now back to the review; I bake. When I say I bake, I mean I bake A LOT.  I bake bread and rolls all the time, but I wanted to try another recipe for a change.  This was so easy, so simple and so tasty I had to not only review it and save it to my recipe book, I had to share it.  I did make just half of the recipe and it was way way more than we NEEDED, but being lovers of anything bread, it will NOT go to waste.  Well, it might go to WAIST but it's all good lol.  A simple way to impress anyone.  Enjoy!  Beware, it makes a LOT of rolls so either bake and freeze or change the serving size.

These were great! My husband said that they are some of the best rolls he has tasted. I mixed the yeast in with the milk and sugar because that is what most bread recipes say to do. They aren't hard to make but take all day because of having to punch the dough down and let it rise again several times. I made them when we had guests and everyone loved them and wanted seconds. I will definitely make them often!

Perfect! The only change I made was to butter them before and after.  The dough is a bit sticky when forming the rolls, but if you just put a bit of flour on your hands when rolling it solves the problem and doesn't change the taste at all.  This recipe makes 2 standard rectangular pans full of about 15 rolls.

Fantastic recipe. They taste great. I halved it, and ended up making about 19 small buns...I had a problem with the rising...I took the advice from some of the reviewers, and put them in the oven at a very very low temperature, and it didn't seem to help. Next time, I'm definetly using instant yeast, and adding a little bit more. Other than that, they're great. The bottoms cooked very fast, so they're a dark brown, whereas the top is very light, but they still taste great. I'd recommend turning down the temperature a bit more, maybe down to 350.

These are wonderful buns, but be sure to make them small enough.  First time I made them I didn't divide the dough up enough and ended up with very doughy undercooked buns...my bad.

I tried to cut the recipe to 24 rolls which worked great although i think i needed a little more yeast, i went by the exact instructions and they came out wonderful i just felt like maybe they could've risen a bit bigger. Next time i will add a little more yeast. Also i added a little bit more sugar we love sweet rolls

These were amazing!  Easy to make and tasted great.  I didn't want them to burn.  I had a little trouble telling if they were really done, or not.  Luckily, they were.  Maybe one in the middle wasn't quite there, but still very good. 

Will make these often.  Give them a try. :)

These dinner rolls are worth the effort!!  They turn out perfect every time.  I use rapid rise yeast and that cuts the rising time in half.  I let them rise 30 to 45 minutes for each rising.  Perfect, perfect, perfect!  My family LOVES them :)

Theses are the best rolls ever. I made others and this takes the cake. I did follow adivce of another adding 1 cup of flour more. I even made cinnamon rolls out of the same batch. I only let them rise once then shaped them into rolls and then let them rise again then baked at 395 for 15 mintues. Came out perfect. I tested them by putting butter on one of the pan of rolls before baking and butter on the other after baking and both turned out perfect. I also took advice of another and baked them in a glass dish and they were perfect. Great recipe and will make again....

These rolls are very yummy, I make them quite often. The only problem I have is getting the dough to the right consistency, the best answer I've managed to come up with is to weigh the flour, this last batch with 2lbs 6oz. of flour has been the easiest to work with so far.

Made these for Christmas dinner and they were delish! With some help from other reviews, I made a few modifications.  Added 1 extra tsp of salt, brushed with beaten egg before baking, and baked at 375 for 30 mins, covering for the last 10 mins.  Turned out great!

First attempt at making yeast rolls.  Made a few changes--I halved the recipe, used 1 packet of the Rapid Rise Yeast, and baked at 375 degrees for 20-25 min.  The end result was fantastic....served them at a dinner party with the "Cinnamon Honey Butter" and didn't have any left by the end of the night!

I did recipe as described but had one little issue with it as it was written.  Making two inch balls and then letting them rise again and baking for actually 5 minutes more than recommended still left middle of rolls not done. I had to shut oven off( I was scared they would brown more) and leave in warm oven for another ten minutes for them to finish.  Once they were done they were perfect.  Everyone loved them but with the baking issues I had I can't give a five.  Recipe is good enough to try again but next time making smaller balls, the end result with two inches were big enough that at one inch and then rising again they would be plenty big enough, and see if this helps.

I made these for a charity I cook for on occasion. They are wonderful. I highly recommend making them as pan rolls. They are light and fluffy and there's no kneading! I'm going to make them again but with whole wheat flour.

These are excellent. I halfed the recipe. I put everything in the bread machine and used the dough cycle. I had to add about one additional cup of flour.  When that finished, I punched it down, formed the rolls, let them rise and baked them. They came out beautiful. Light and airy. They were a huge hit! I served them with honey butter. This one is a keeper!

OMG! The first rise only took 30 minutes to double, the second 40 minutes, and then I formed them into rolls and let them rise another 30 minutes.    I used 8-1/2 cups of flour to get the right consistency.  Used a half size baking sheet for 24 rolls and put the last two in a small loaf pan, instead of using a 9x13 glass dish.  I got 26 rolls of between 2.6 and 2.85 oz. each.

If I can make these, anyone can! They are so soft and fluffy, but I would still consider them on the heavier side.  Perfectly suited for soups, stews, dipping in gravy, etc.  Be prepared, the dough is sticky.  I added additional flour, but tried to be careful and not add too much.

Just made these today and they are awesome!  I added about 1/2c more flour.  This is kinda a sticky dough, but turns out wonderful.  Comments on adding more salt -- I didn't think so, but depends on your taste and I'm sure it wouldn't make them bad, for sure.  They are kinda yeasty, but I like dinner rolls like that.  It tastes homemade to me.  I made mine in 2-9x13 pans 20 in glass, 15 in aluminum.  Definitely need more than just one 9x13 pan.  I also used 1/4c butter mixed with a few dashes of salt and about 1/4c honey for the top after they're cooked and this covered both pans perfectly.  Seriously good rolls.  Fluffy, while still having very good density.

These dinner rolls are perfect.  I have worked with yeast a lot, but I think even a beginner could be successful with this one. I found this recipe to be really easy to follow, with GREAT results.  I even had to rush the risings, and they still came out beautifully.  I have used the dough to make the kolaches we used to get in central Texas -- dough wrapped around sausage.  They were just like I remembered.  Thanks for adding this one!

I followed this recipe as written with the exception of changing oven temp to 375 degrees and baked for 23 minutes. My husband and I absolutely loved them. I will definately make these for Thanksgiving. The only change I will make is to add 1/2 to 1 cup more flour for easier handling of the dough which was very sticky.

Very good. Thank you Angie. I had my husband push the dough down a couple of times while I was out shopping... The first rise did seem a bit slower like other people said... I think I waited too long to bake them since they were a tiny bit sour from them fermenting basically all day.. Oops.... Next time I will push down once and then proof and bake. Or refrigerate until I am ready...Overall I think the rolls were great and I did add 1/2 tsp more salt and it was good like that... Nothin worse than flat tasting bread! Also I baked in glass @ 375 for about 15 mins.. Don't over bake these!

Rolls turned out great and I am not very experienced at making bread. The best thing was the mini french toast made from the left overs on day four.

Made these to take to Christmas dinner at a neighbor's house & the rolls were excellent!  Didn't make any changes to the recipe other than to do an egg wash before baking - 1 whole egg, 1 T water.

Great recipe! I substituted the milk for soy milk and butter for margarine (because my man is lactose intolerant), and used half whole wheat flour (just cause it makes me feel healthier, haha).. And they turned out wonderful. Raving reviews from all the family at the table. I followed some advice from others in order to make the dough rise and stuck it in the oven at a very low heat.

These turned out really good. I accidentally added the melted butter to the buns and it didn't seem to change anything, also I used buttermilk because I had some.

WOW-- I have been making bread for many years, but I wasn't ready for the wonderful yeasty aroma of these rolls, and the taste is the best ever.   I halved the recipe except for the 2 1/2 teaspoon of yeast, and used the bread machine for the dough.  Once that was done,I  punched fingers into the dough to deflate and then let it rise and deflate again.  I dumped the dough onto a cutting board,and using kitchen shears, cut strips about 1 1/2 to 2 inches inch wide, and cut two inch pieces off that then rolled and put into pan.  Didn't need to add flour to my hands, but did slightly oil  them. After reviewing  the recipe, I think that you are supposed to stir ingredients in a bowl, cover, rise, deflate, rise deflate, rise deflate and shape rolls.  No kneading at all.  Will triy it that way next time.

The rolls are soft, fluffy and light. Really awesome. I used 3 tsp instant yeast and sieved it in with the flour, everything else was unchanged.

These are the best rolls ever! I also shared this recipe with my mom and we both agree that this is the best recipe for soft rolls that we have found. She makes her into a loaf but I made mine into the rolls and froze them, they are perfect if you are making cheeseburger sliders. Addictive!

This recipe definitely threw me off a bit with the lack of kneading. But that's okay- they did turned out okay. If, like me, you find that your dough is quite sticky when trying to tear off pieces and shapes into the rolls- just spray your hands with cooking spray. It's much easier to work with the dough that way.

These are fantastic. I read reviews to see how other people handled the recipe and I love all the helpful hints. If it helps, here's my experience:

I halved the recipe (4 cups of flour and 2ts salt) and used 1% milk because that's all I had on hand.  After reading the reviews, I cut the heat to 375 and baked for 25 min.  I used a glass 9" cake round and an 8X8 glass baking dish sprayed with PAM.  Each dish held 9 two ounce balls.  I cooked them one after the other to not crowd the oven.  I also made the dough the day before letting it rise 3 times.  This morning I took out the dough and let it rest for an hour before portioning.  I let the balls rest and rise for 30 min while the oven preheated.  When I took them out of the oven they were a nice golden brown and 205 degrees on the inside courtesy of my thermapen.  I brushed them with some melted butter and put them on a rack to cool.  After about 20 min of cooling they are soft and light, just like a good dinner roll should be.  Thank you for the recipe!

I tried this, but the dough was soft and quite sticky. Tasted good, though. I live in a hot and humid place, so that might have something to do with it. I'll try it again with more flour or less yeast and see how it turns out

Last weekend I was in full blown baking mode. Having gotten a new bread maker for Christmas I have been looking for a good dinner roll recipe. I found this and thought, 'Hhmm . . .Guess I don't need the machine. Let's try this because it got such great reviews.' It turned out to be the best dinner roll recipe I have ever used.  I am a trained chef and this is now my 100% go to recipe for rolls as well as bread. My step dad never really eats bread with dinner but that night, we had London Broil, baked potatoes, corn on the cob and these amazing rolls, my step dad ate 3 of these bad boys! Nice.

These are fabulous! Soft. I also used egg yolk to create a golden brown crust on the roll tops. I baked these for 20 min at 350 in the center of the oven, because I have dark bake-ware with non stick coating.  The higher temps tend to cause the bake-ware to become too hot and scorch the underside of bread products

I started making these a few months ago and have made them 10-15 times already, they are amazing! They are light and airy, and can be altered in many ways. The first time I made them, I added all of the sugar, but they were a bit to sweet for rolls for me, so I now halve the sugar. I use this recipe to make bread wrapped meatballs and I add fresh herbs, garlic powder, and parmesean to the flour. I also use this recipe for the bread for tortas and I get about 12 nice small sandwich loaves. I love that it is the kind of recipe that can used for many different things and holds up well for all of them. If making this for something else, cut back on the sugar. I personally have not had any mishaps with the recipe and I dont even really follow the directions exactly. I do, however, follow the rising directions as close as possible and I literally get my house as warm as possible and then put them in the warmest part of my house (I just dont trust the oven method) and they rise just perfect. If you are having rising issues, you may want to start checking the temp of your liquid. If you didnt like these, or were unhappy with the result, you must have done something wrong.

These were great rolls, but the recipe calls for a lot of rising of the dough.  I didn't have time to do all of the rises, so I really only did the first rise and part of the second one.  The dough wasn't firm enough to form into dough balls, so I just put them in a mini-muffin tin.  Turned out great!  We served these at Thanksgiving and everyone wanted more rolls...which was good because we had a TON.  The rolls might be even better if you go through all of the rises that recipe calls for, but I was glad I was able to make them without going through all of that!

These were great!  I halved the recipe and ended up with 11 huge rolls.  I used 2+ cups of white whole wheat flour and 2+ c all-purpose.  Thanks!

I've been baking bread for years and this is now my go-to recipe for rolls.  It is so easy.  I've made it countless times, made a few little goofs once in a while, and they've always been wonderful-light, fluffy and addictive. Also,  I love that I get to use the time I would have spent kneading tidying up or moving on to another dish.

I made these for Thanksgiving and this was my first time EVER making homemade dinner rolls. I went directly by the directions and it was a breeze and they turned out perfect except my family like their rolls sweet. I made these again..but doubled the sugar and they were perfect.

I was a bread-making virgin before attempting these rolls for Thanksgiving Day.  My mother helped me...as I whisked she added in the flour...but other than that I did all the work.  These were so easy!  For the rising part, I just put them in the microwave so that it was dark and warm.  I think my brother ate about 10 of them and he is the pickiest eater ever.  The only thing I added was a nice eggwash (1 beaten egg and 2 tbls. water mixed) brushed on the rolls before baking for 12 mins.  They came out beautifully golden brown.

I really liked this recipe! I am not in any sort of way a baker so i felt it was quite a bit of work and very time consuming, but i assume making most bread would be. It was very buttery, soft, delicate and all around, just really delicious.

These were delicious! I followed the recipe and made exactly 36 rolls. I brought them to a bbq with a bunch of my husband's Army officer buddies, and not a single roll was left after an hour. It seems time consuming because of how many times it needs to be punched down and allowed to rise, but if you plan ahead and start in the morning, you can go about your day and quickly punch down/turn/recover the dough which takes about 5 minutes.

Delicious! I used some more flour like other reviews suggested, about 1/2 cup. They turned out soo good! 
If you're looking for a Texas Road House roll recipe, this one is a close match. They turn out a bit heavier than TRH's, but are just as delicious. Mm-mm! Thanks for the recipe, Cristy! :9

Love these rolls!! I have been very spoiled by using rapid rise yeast (it cuts out the first rise time) and this recipe worked beautifully in it and I even doubled it. What a large batch of dough that turned out to be, but I've got 3 pans loaded with golden, fluffy rolls just waiting to be consumed with Christmas dinner. I will definitely be using this recipe again!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and the rolls came out kind of hard and dry without very much flavor.  Will try again and add more liquid next time.

I have had nothing but raves when serving these rolls.  The recipe appears to be very forgiving. I did need to add some more flower after blending in the mixer. I kneaded the dough just long enough till I felt the dough was a good consistency. I have punched the dough down twice, then shaped my rools for the last rise.  I make my rools larger then recipe calls for, I then make sandwiches, use them as hamburger rolls, last but not least, soooo good to toast with my morning coffee. I bake them about 3/4 in apart.  Makes 20 good size rools, makes much more dinner rools. I would bake them on a cookie sheet, you will need two of them. Every one that has eaten my rools said they were to die for. Thank You so much for sharing this recipe. Doris 12-03-10

Made these exactly as written at Thanksgiving and they were a hit! Nobody ever fills up on bread on Thanksgiving, but all of these rolls were GONE and people wanted MORE.  I have to admit, I took all the credit :)   Give yourself TIME to let these rise - don't cut corners. The dough is beautiful and light and the taste is superb.  I used a hand mixer to beat in the sugar, eggs, soft butter and salt. It worked well and went really fast.   Although, I didn't need the full 7 cups of flour. Maybe since I used bread flour? 6 was plenty and I liked that this bread rose in the same bowl it was mixed in. No fussy oiling and rolling and such.   These didn't get super golden, just a light brown - but not a big deal. Just don't overcook them, thinking they're not done - the time is right.  Next time, I'm going to divide the dough and make a loaf of bread - I'd be curious how that works.

I really dont know if this is what I was after, but, the results where of a good nature.  The reason I say this as the rolls look like the picture, was very substantial in the middle (like a snowflake roll).  they had a slight sweet taste and everybody loved them.  What I was looking for was more of a yeast roll that you get at a Steakhouse.  Maybe I picked the wrong receipe for that particular yeast dinner roll, but, these where really good rolls.  I ate a bunch and made a bread pudding off this site with the leftover ones 2 days later.  The Bread Pudding tuned out great as well!  I will make these rolls again when I want more of a snowflake roll than a yeast roll!

These came out wonderfully. Followed the directions exactly with half the ingredients. Had plenty of dough to make enough rolls for everyone and have a bag full of leftovers. Thanks for a great base recipe. I think next time I will put a little more salt in it.

Not bad.  Definitely better than rolls you buy at store but I thought with all the high reviews they would be out of this world.  Again, they were good and I'd make them again but leaving my options open for other recipes.  Until then this will be it.  I halved recipe and made about 16 rolls.  Be sure to spray your fingers with lots of Pam to help form rolls.  You will need help or your pam can will get really dirty by you doing it yourself since you will have doughy hands....

What a mess! Way too much liquid. Do not try recipe out unless practiced. I have made rolls before and could not understand what happened. The liquid content is too high and yeast/milk are not good combo. Yeast should only be put in water.

First timie I had ever used yeast and made homemade rolls (or bread of any sort).  My family enjoyed them immensely.  I did figure out they turn out better in a glass pyrex pan vx. a metal cake pan.  The metal turned the bottoms much darker (almost too dark), and with the glass, the tops and bottoms were about the same golden brown.  I think next time if I use this again (Probably will) I will make them bigger though.  mine turned out sorta like mini rolls, and I was expecting them to be much bigger.  Thank you for the recipe!

Ok I was going to give these four stars because for me the cooking time was WAY off.  It took like 20 minutes minimum to get the gooey rolls in the middle cooked (I turned them out to cool, and had to try and stuff the mess back into the pan to cook longer).  Also, I had a REALLY hard time fitting all these rolls into a 9x13.  I would definitely go with a bigger pan, because they were squashed (this could've caused the cooking time mixup, I think).  But when we tasted them, oh man!  These are the best rolls I've ever made.  Bar none.  All other roll recipes are going in the trash, because I will never make another roll except for Angie's!!  Soooo good!  We ate one pretty much every single time we walked by the cooling rack.  Awesome awesome rolls!

My first ever dinner roll, and they were spectacular.  However they took much longer to make than I was expecting.  Maybe you dont have to wait the full hour? but by doing so, there is an hour, then it says to do that 2 more times, so there's another couple of hours, 3 really if you punch it down 2 more times, I am guessing you need another hour to let it rise again so you can work with it?  Or maybe not, I don't know, but then you need to let the rolls rise once put in the pan.  I didn't have that much time, so I cheated a bit on the final punch down, and then I didn't have time to let them rise too much in the pan, so I took a chance and put them in the oven anyways, and they baked beautifully.  And they tasted amazing!

Wonderful rolls. Worth the extra worth since the turn out fluffy and and perfect every time! I make these for special occasions and they are delicious. Use extra flour when handling, since batter tends to be sticky.

My dough never rose and I have no idea why. I went ahead and baked it though and it rose in the oven. Odd. It tasted fine but didn't have the fluffy texture I was looking for. I will stick with the Unbelievable Rolls from this site instead.

These rolls came out fantastic.  I did not change anything and they were soft, fluffy and had a slight sweet taste to them.  I made them a little big so they were sandwich roll size and we made ham sandwiches with Easter leftovers. So yummy!

This dough rose so nicely, and came out great from the oven! Made entirely in the Kitchen aid with the dough hook, super easy! Nice texture, great flavor.  Used these for "Elaine's Sweet and Tangy Loose meat sandwiches," great combination.   Sweetness of the roll complimented the bite of the meat perfectly.  I could have eaten 8 of them! (I didn't) Thanks for the great roll recipe, I plan to make them again and again!

Oh these were just perfect - and I even goofed. I let the first rise go WAY too long and a lot of the dough spilled over the bowl and had to be discarded. I'm not sure if it was because the day was humid or not, but the dough was also REALLY sticky. I just put globs of dough into a cooking sprayed muffin tin and baked as directed. So even if your dough doesn't look promising stick with it because these are sssooooooooo good. Actually the best yeast rolls I've ever had!

OMGoodness!  I just pulled them out of the oven.  Forgot to add the butter on top, but slathered some on when I pulled them apart.  Wow.  I cut the recipe in half.  I used an oiled pyrex 9 x 12 glass baking dish.  I put the ingredients in my bread machine on dough cycle and when it was done, pulled it out, dumped it into an oiled bowl, punched it down, covered it and let it rise for an hour.  Then I pulled pieces off the dough (about an inch or so a piece) rolled them up (not perfectly), and put them in the pyrex just touching.  I got about 24 rolls out of it, and they all fit in the dish.  I let it rise for another hour, then put it into the 400 degree oven for 15 minutes.  The tops were brown, the bread was soft and scrumtious.  When I pulled it out of the oven, all had grown together like several brown topped soft pillows in the dish.  These were much more delicious than anything I ever could have bought.  This recipe is the best. Soft, warm, tasty buns.    I will make these always when I need or want dinner rolls.  They are much better than "rolls".  I bet I could make a batch or two and freeze them.  Tell your aunt THANKS!!! I am indebted.  Best rolls I've ever made or tasted.  Thank you, Cristy.

Unbelievable.  These are the best tasting rolls I've ever made.  My wife has even said she'll never eat the store bought split top rolls again now that she's tasted these...lol.  I used a packet of Active Dry yeast instead of the 4 tablespoons and the resulting rolls did not have a yeasty taste as others have said.  This made about 40 rolls for me.  On half of them I melted butter as the recipe suggests, the other half I melted butter over mixed with powdered garlic to make italian style rolls.

These are so delicious, soft, and buttery just the way dinner rolls should be. I will definitely make these again. As the other reviewers have mentioned you do need about a 1/2 cup to cup of extra flour.

I made a whole thanksgiving feast for a bunch of 20 year old boys and it was these buns, not the turkey or gravy etc, that they  raved about. They loved how soft they were and how easily they pulled apart. Will definatly use this recipe many more times to come. REVIEW: I make these all the time. My preference is to half the sugar.

These are GREAT! I halved the recipe because I didn't think that my bread machine could handle almost 8 cups of flour ;) I also added a little bit more salt and a half cup more of flour and a added a full half cup of sugar. My family started to eat them before dinner and ate with dinner and more after dinner. NONE left...and they wanted more! I have to make more tomorrow! haha!

these were soft but a bit heavy. I made some of them into calzones by rolling them flat, spreading tomato puree, grated cheese and salami accross, then folding over and baking. They were great! :-D

Great and easy for beginners! I did not add enough flour at first but after the dought rose I knew I had messed up and added a little flour at a time until a soft dough formed. Now I know the difference from batter and soft dough! I'll make again for Easter.

This is the best recipe for rolls I have ever tried! The rolls are wonderful. I read the reviews before I tried it and was prepared to have extra flour on hand. I didn't need extra at all! As a matter of fact I had maybe a half cup left over. I was also worried about the softened butter encorporating well in the milk. But it worked just fine once you being to mix in the flour. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I can't wait to make these again and neither can my family!

I made these for Thanksgiving this year.  Delicious!!  My mom liked them so much she asked for the recipe.  You may want to check the number of rolls it makes and adjust as needed.  The recipe as shown makes 36.  We had alot of leftovers!

My family's favorite rolls. I've not found a better dough. If you do this over a 12 to 18 hours you get a sour dough flavor just don't let it dry out.

I made these for our belated Christmas dinner. They were AMAZING! And really a snap to make-- all w/o a mixer or anything really fancy.

I did make a few changes. I only made half the recipe since there are only 3 of us.  I also didn't really measure the flour. Instead I added flour 1/2 cup at a time until a workable dough formed, then I turned it out of the bowl. It was still sticky but I dusted w/ flour as I worked the dough. I also didn't time myself kneading but rather worked the dough until it was soft, pliable, and not really sticky any more. Back into a greased bowl to rise for all 3 risings. One suggestion I have if you have a drafty or cool kitchen like I do is to put the dough in either a slightly warmed oven (I put my oven on the warm setting for a minute then turned it off) or the microwave. I did both and the dough rose beautifully. I formed the dough into balls, and I got 18, and set it on top of the oven (which was warm from the ham I was cooking) w/ a slightly damp towel over it. Lastly I brushed w/ an egg wash before popping them into the oven to give them a beautiful color. They came out soft, fluffy, and beautiful! 

Highly, highly recommend this recipe!

I used my KitchenAid with the regular mixer attachment and was very pleased with dough consistency.  I made the rolls a little too large so will make them a little smaller next time; however, they turned out great for our Christmas Eve Birthday Feast for my husband's birthday!

I’ve made these so many times I’ve stopped counting. Excellent every time- I make half batches in my bread machine. No work no hassle. My kids love them my grandkids love them- I don’t use any other yeast roll recipe now

This was my first time working with yeast and it was 'fast rising' yeast. Also I did not have regular milk and used Almond Milk. Because I always follow recipes to the 't' I was worried from the beginning that I screwed up. However, these rolls turned out GREAT!! Everyone LOVED them!! Can't wait to start experimenting with garlic, different cheeses and toppings, etc. 
If I can make these - anyone can!!

I've made this recipe at least 10 times and turned the dough into dinner rolls, cinnamon buns, juke kage, pizza crust, etc. It is a wonderful all purpose recipe!  Highly recommended.

I was looking forward to enjoying these after all the great reviews.  Although they came out fine, and looked like the picture, I didn't find the FLAVOR anything to write home about.  They were bland, with just a touch of sweetness.  I've had better rolls, and these disappointed me.

This recipe was fun to make.  I paired it up with New England Clam Chowder.   Luckily,  the weather supported the dinner genre because it was freezing (to us Hawaiians).  This was a simple recipe, quite time consuming,  but so worth the wait!

I have made these for Thanksgiving  for the last couple of years. My entire family (40+people) love them! They have now become a tradition and I have become the official bread maker. I also make them a couple times a year when my husband wants them "just because". Thank you for this recipe and Happy Holidays to one and all!

Excellent! Perfect light but chewy texture. I subbed in a few cups of wheat flour and it was so good. Try them.

Lovely light fluffy rolls. Only needed half an hour to double in size each time so much quicker to make than I expected. These got a huge thumbs up from the whole family.

Perfect recipe. My guys really enjoyed them, worth the time it took. I was worried about previous comments about gooey rolls so I cooked them on a baking sheet with about 1&1/2 inches between rolls. Perfectly delicious! Thank you, will be making more soon!

These are the best ever, I've finally found a recipe that is perfect!  I made 1 loaf of bread and 20 rolls.  I did have to add more flour as people have previously stated, probably about 3/4 of a cup.  I also kneaded the dough before I let it rise.  I only let it rise 3 times, twice before I shaped it into the loaf pan and once after.  Baked the rolls at 375 F for 15 min and the loaf at 375 for 25 min, worked out perfectly.  I've found my bread!!!  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe, it reminds me of home!!!

Made these for a family get-together a week ago.  My elderly mother said I was crazy, as she noted the "five or so rises - who does that?"  But I'm a believer that you get what you work for, so I tried them.  Everyone went crazy over them.  So soft, and so tasty (with the butter on top).  Even my mother said they were the best rolls we have ever made (although she still proposed that "surely 3 rises would be enough").  I'll continue to make them as the recipe says.

I made this but I used it to make cinnamon pecan rolls, and they turned out great! The rolls came out fluffy and tender--perfect for cinnamon rolls. It was easy too. I don't think I changed anything in the original recipe. After letting it rise, I kneaded it well and then cut the dough in half. (I put half in the freezer, so we'll see how that turns out later in the week--planning on making doughnuts out of it.) With the remaining half, I rolled it into a rectangle and spread with butter, brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. I rolled it into a log, and sliced it into twelve rolls. Put them in a baking pan with a caramel sauce I made and pecans, and let them rise another 45 minutes or so. They came out amazing!

Loved this recipe since there is no kneading!  As other readers suggested, you may need to add more flour so dough is not as sticky.  Other than that, I did not change a thing!

Outstanding recipe!  Tastes amazing!!!  Worked well when the recipe was exactly followed and when I increased the size of the roll and baking time.  I was very pleased with this recipe. It was exactly what I was looking for!  Thank you so much for sharing!  I plan on making this again and again!

I only give this three stars. First, these were to "yeasty"  and a little bland to my taste. The texture was good. The dough rises very quickly due to too much yeast and sugar. I may try less yeast and longer rise time.

I have tried so many recipes for rolls and these are the best ones ever!!! Very soft and buttery. I did use an extra cup of flour and was impatient and only let the dough rise twice but they were still very yummy. My kids loved them. My hubby thought they needed a little more sugar so next time I make I will add more but this is my dinner roll recipe. Thank you!!!

I really loved this roll recipe, and I have made a LOT of rolls/breads in the past!  They came out super light and fluffy with an excellent flavor - not bland in any way and I used the exact ration of recipe ingredients.  I did however change how I made them slightly - I heated up the milk and melted the butter and added the sugar and yeast and proofed it.  I then added the eggs, and flour and mixed using a dough hook.  Once incorporated, I kneaded it for just a few minutes and then covered and rested the dough for 20 minutes.  I then kneaded the dough again, and added the salt, kneaded some more and then proceeded to the first rise.  These were hands down the best rolls I have ever made and this will definitely be in my rotation - can't wait for Easter dinner because I am making these!!  Enjoy, you won't regret it!

Great Dinner rolls, simple, and while tedious with the repeated punching down of the dough, its a great recipie for the day off when you are running loads of laundry. I found myself using the timer on the washer/dryer to remind me to punch down the dough. Worked well and my children loved them. Tasted great!

These turned out so nice. Great taste and great consistency. I baked them in a heavy duty cookie sheet rather than in a baking dish.  Worked well and I had no issue with uncooked rolls in the batches I made.

I tried to reduce the size recipe but ended up with making the original recipe. This was my first effort in making dinner rolls. I did use more flour like everyone else has said. I used vegetable oil to roll the dough into a ball shape like a friend showed me. I ended up with 32 rolls. I think I should have waited longer to let them raised the fourth time. Other than dropping my oil bottle on the counter, I feel this was really easy. When I make them again I will only use a square baking dish like a 8x8 for uniform shape and over all baking. My boyfriend said they were good. My parents brought me back the container I put on their kitchen table two days later and said they want a batch every week, and said they are good for sandwiches too!

Made these with a few substitutions, since my son is dairy free.  Used soymilk and margarine with good results.

The second time I made them I took each portion of dough and wrapped it around a few pieces of chopped pepperoni and a small chunk of mozzarella cheese.  When they came out of the oven, I brushed them with garlic margarine and then sprinkled them with sea salt.  They were a BIG HIT!!!!  My kids  loved them, as did my hubby and I!

Like other reviewers, I combined the ingredients in a different order.  I put the milk, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan and heated to approximately 120 degrees, poured the mixture in my KitchenAid bowl, sprinkled the yeast over the top and waited five minute or so.  Then I beat in the eggs, one at a time and beat in three cups of the flour.  I transferred this to a large bowl and stirred in the remaining flour plus at least another cup.  The dough is very sticky!
This is practically a no-fail recipe.  I was doing too many things at once the last time I made these and dumped a teaspoon of the yeast in with the milk mixture while it was heating  No problem.  I added the rest of the yeast as noted above and the rolls were fine.
I have baked these rolls in 8 and 9 inch cake pans, depending on the size I want.
Do let them rise as directed in the recipe.  These are delicious!

I felt that these rolls did not live up to the hype. They were 'alright', but most certainly Not 'Perfect'. I didn't like the texture, and something was off with the taste. I did enjoy Whoomping them 4 times :0)

I can't really add anything to the positive reviews but I had to at least say YES these are great.  
Like someone else I too only made 1/2 the recipe and got 8 huge buns.  I am going to try freezing some after the 2nd rising and see how that works.

Let me tell you something, when i say these are good i mean they are GOOD! 
These are the only rolls i make, i have tried different recipes but i always run back to these.
I have made these rolls so many times that i can make it in my bread maker with my eyes closed. I know the recipe likes its on the back of my hand! Angie's Dinner Rolls are usually gone within a day!

Delicious!  I used an extra cup of flour, and the dough was still very sticky.  However, it did rise correctly and cooked up nicely.

Yum! I halved the recipe, and used a little extra flour. Turkey cooked quicker than we were expecting, so I only did 2 rises plus letting the shaped rolls rise, and they turned out great. Will definitely make these again.

I wanted to make rolls like my mother would for the holidays so I did some research and found these.  They do take time to make, but are worth it. After I took them out and allowed them to cool a bit, I shared one with my daughter and husband.  When I wasn't looking, my husband took another one.  He also had two for breakfast this morning. The only problem that I had was rolling them into balls because of the stickiness, so next time I will take the advice and add  another 1/2 cup of flour.

These are SO awesome.  I tried a different recipe before these and threw them in the trash.  These are so easy and turn out perfect and beautiful.  Add flour slowly after about 5 cups just until the dough doesn't stick to the side of the bowl anymore.

These are very special rolls and if you are patient enough to do all of the rises you will be rewarded.  I love this recipe but do not use but 2 tablespoons of sugar, tried with the 1/2 cup and was too sweet for me.  I like a dinner roll not to taste like a sweet cupcake just my preference.  However the extra rises changes this from a good roll to a pillowy light airy great roll.  I have made other dinner rolls with the 2 rises but never will again.  2-3 of these disappear within mins after coming out of the oven and hitting the dinner table.  It's the darnest thing how that happens!

This recipe did not go so well for me in which I am very dissapointed.  The instructions were confusing and I actually had to read them over and over. 450° was much too high a temp and it burned. It we truly a mess.

These were so soft and chewy.  Nostalgic, as my dad said, reminded him of the rolls he had as a child.  They were buttery with the perfect texture.  My family loves butter on their rolls so I dunked them in some melted butter right out of the oven and they were delicious!

amazing rolls,  I ended up using a 9 x13 and a 10 in pie pan.  I the dough was a little sticky but rolled nice.  I brushed with butter before I put them in the oven and right after I took them out.  They we're even great the next day.

I just made these for my family tonight and they were a huge hit!  I was concerned at first because my milk cooled down quickly and the yeast didn't seem to be proofing properly, but I forged ahead and they ended up rising amazingly quickly.  I did have some trouble rolling them into balls and will pay more attention when adding the flour next time (I lost track of my measurements and guessed.), but I just kept flouring my hands well as I rolled them and it worked out fine.  Everyone said they were perfect and rivaled our great aunt's whose dinner rolls are legendary in our family.  I'll definitely be making these again.  Thanks, Angie! :o)

This really helped lift my families spirits this holiday . my grandmother who just passed a few weeks ago made rolls just like these that were phenomonal . These are just as good I omited half a tsp of salt though due to high blood pressure problems. Only thing I would add is a tad bit more sugar but thats just a personal preference . Happy Thanksgiving

Great roll recipe. I altered it some though. The most significant change, I cook the rolls in a cupcake pan at 380. This insures that the rolls are cooked evenly.

This is just delicious! The bread is fluffy, flavorful, and beautiful! I did add 1/2 tsp of extra salt, and used 2 9x13 pans. I only repeated step 2 one time, and it came out huge! Everyone was impressed! Thank you for sharing this.

At supper these rolls were very good with a bit of butter and honey.  In the morning I packed them as a staple for my hungry hunter to enjoy.  When the men came in the first thing that they did was praised the rolls as the best part of their lunch. Then they wanted to tell about their adventures...

I usually half this recipe for my small family, but this has become the most requested roll recipe from the hubs. I do add 1 tbsp of dough enhancer for texture. At times I do not have time to raise 3+ times. Even with one raise in the bowl and then a one raise for the shaped rolls, they turn out great.

I made these rolls exactly as the recipe says and they were PERFECT!!! My family loves them and they are requested at every extended family dinner. Try them with honey butter drizzled over them when they are taken out of the oven... Incredible!

I just made these last night, and they were excellant! I halved the recipe, and had enough to fill a 10" pie plate with half and then freeze the rest before the final rise.  I will admit I got a little pressed for time, so they only had about 1/2 hour for each rise after the first, but they were still wonderful! Thanks so much for the recipe, i'm sure i'll use it again and again!

the bread was good, but definitely needed more flour.  i also didn't like the multiple risings it required.  thought it would be something spectacular, but it wasn't anything different than the recipe i usually use that only raises once.

I tried these twice, and can't get them right.... must be me, but both times, they were flat, even with new yeast. Great flavor though, my husband loved them flat

UPDATE: 3/07/10 BOO-HOOOO WA-WAAAAA I can't seem to get them right anf fluffy... the recipe taste amazing, but, I kid you not, I follow the recipe exactly, and still get flat rolls. My hubby loves them though cuz they remind him of a Chilean recipe. He delights, I frustrate.

These are great rolls! I wasn't so sure about the sprinkling the yeast on top of the warm milk instead of mixing it in, but it worked out just fine. After letting yeast sit for five minutes, I mixed it together with the the eggs and melted butter, placed in bread machine, added dry ingredients, and ran machine on Dough cycle. Dough rose all the way to the top of the machine! Punched down and let rise second time in my oven (while turned off) with a pot of steaming hot water sitting on the rack beneath it. Rises perfect every time. Based on other reviews of the rolls not completely baking in the center of the baking dish, I made balls of dough roughly the size of golf balls and placed each one individually into the cups of a greased muffin pan. I covered the pans with foil and froze until the next day, rising the rolls the third time in the off oven with steaming hot water. They puffed up beautifully, and all of the rolls baked thoroughly. This is my new roll recipe. =)

I ended up needing to use about a cup more flour than the recipe called for, and wish I'd added more salt. The rolls took forever to cook--about twice the stated time--and were still a little sticky in the middle even as they scorched on the outside of the pan. In the end, they didn't have much flavor and needed more salt. Next time I'd double the salt and split the rolls into two pans instead of one so that they bake more evenly.

The time it takes to make these rolls in innacurate.  With all the pounding and rising, it feels like forever!  But, they are SUPER delicious, so totally worth it.  Very fluffy!  I let the dough double, then I pounded, then let it rise again, then pounded and split into rolls and let it rise one more time in the pan.  Made 35 rolls, which is too much for us.  Should halve it next time.

The very first time I made any sort of bread I used this recipe.  It turned out amazing!!  I have now used this recipe tons of times and it is always great!!  For home, I usually half this recipe because it does make so much bread but for holidays I make the whole amount.  Great every time!      A good addition: Before you get ready to form your rolls, knead in two teaspoons of minced garlic and some onion salt.

I thought they were too yeasty for my taste. Kids even said they smelled like beer. I found the butter over the top made them too greasy and without the butter they were too hard. With stick with my tried and true recipe from now on.

Beautiful! I subbed half of the milk with buttermilk, worked very well. Also, I upped the recipe to 250 for a party, and there wasn't any left over...I am using this recipe again for our small Thanksgiving dinner...I am definitely thankful that I found this keeper! You may have to adjust the flour or raising time-but that's normal depending on where you live.

If you are lookings for a yeast roll recipe for Thanksgiving or Christmas or anytime.  Don't look any farther this is it.  I have made this twice in 5 days and each time it has come out perfect.  I have dough in the Refrigerator and am going to make rolls in the morning and let them rise.  I'm so excited to have found this recipe.  IF I could I would give it more than 5 stars. *********

I first halved the recipe, but than I needed much more dough than 3 1/2 cups of flour, the second time around I made the whole recipe and the amount of flour was ok.I didn't let them rise 4 times, only twice and shaped balls. I felt they didn't really came out THAT fluffy, but ok. The taste is good but I doubled the salt the second time around. My husband loves them and wants me to make them for his collegues at work!

I am quite new with baking specially breads, and was very excited when got this recipe and was eager to try it,i would like to ask the original contributer of this recipe my rolls did'nt turn as fluffy as shown what can be the reason and also just to inform that i used egg substitute instead of egg. It turned up to be ok, but i'm sure its somewhere something missed by me i kindly request the original contributer to help me with this recipe. Thanks

Quite yummy, but hard to work with and...I halved the recipe and it made only 8??? I don't know where these reports of giant, abundant rolls are coming from. Maybe my yeast was a bit off. They did rise plenty and tasted like perfectly good rolls, not dense, so it would seem the yeast was fine...I will try again, am just a bit confused about how I got so few compared to everyone else? Oh well, everyone liked them, just nothing extraordinary for the effort :-) (People couldn't tell that I had baked them from scratch, which, when it's me baking, is a BAD thing.)

This is the best recipe ever for dinner rolls! I can't wait to pass it down to a future generation:) Like a lot of other members who've tried this recipe, I too had to add more flower because the dough was still very sticky. The only thing i would change is just to cook at least no more than 350 degrees as I believe 400 degrees was too hot for the rolls...the bottoms were a little black but overall it still tasted terrific!

The first time I followed the recipe I got very dry rolls.  I am trying the recipe again and using less flour in hopes that the roles will not be dry.  I am also somewhat confused because the ready time says 2h35min but the rolls are raised 4 times?  I can only assume that each raising time is less than an hour.  I noticed several of the reviewers added more flour, but my dough this time was smooth so I hope it turns out.

Perfect!  
Tastes like Bob Evans Restaurant Dinner Rolls!  Absolutely Delicious!  
I did have to use about 1/2 cup more flour. Baked and eaten all in the same day!

This were delicious!! The only problem I had was the rolls in the middle didn’t cook all the way through. But I’m excited to try them again and am going to bake them in a larger dish. Super easy to make as well!

Good, but the flavor was not quite there.  I used unsalted butter and think that may have made the difference.  I live in Mexico and it’s difficult to get salted butter that doesn’t have oil in it as well.

This was my second time making bread ever! I was so nervous but they turned out lovely! I do find they smell very strongly of alcohol (straight vodka) but the taste is normal. Not sweet or salty, they would be best accompanying the main dish where hardiness isn't the main focus. The took about 20 minutes to bake not 10-15. Good recipe, I will try again.

I love this recipe. I cut it in half and got a 9x13 pan full. I pop them out, cut them in half and PERFECT slider rolls for my Philly Cheesesteak or BBQ chicken/pork sliders!!!!  We also had them with a dinner (my trial run)  and my TranSiberian Orchestra tour chef bf said they were delicious!!!

Can I substitute whole wheat flour? I tried it, but the dough didn’t rise?? I’m new to this whole bread making. It was my first kitchen aid mixer recipe, but I’m not sure it worked right for me because I subbed in the wheat flour.

Followed the recipe and the rolls turned out wonderfully. I used quick rise instant yeast, and prewarmed the oven slightly to help the dough rise.  The dough raised quickly, I only waited 20 - 30 min between each round, it was a huge time saver.  My first time at making bread, very happy it turned out successfully.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

We ate them too fast, I forgot to take any pictures. They were great, followed the recipe exactly except did do an egg wash before baking. Will definitely make these again.

These dinner rolls were fantastic. This was my first time ever making from scratch homemade buns. This was so easy... even for a novice baker like me!! I cut the qty in half since it's just two of us. I couldn't believe how much the dough rised! It was unbelievable!!! I followed all the steps exactly. I let my dough rise each time covered with plastic wrap in the microwave.... this works perfectly. What a cozy little warm spot for all the magic to happen.  These where so fluffy and moist... better than any store bought dinner rolls.  Yes there is a lot of time involved... but very minimal hands on time. Punch down dough and go do something else for an hour.... punch down again...go do something else...
I'm hooked now on making homemade buns.... can't wait to make again

I made these rolls last weekend to go along side a beef stew and needless to say I was blown away. this after about three years of experimenting with different recipes and techniques. by far the best rolls I have made to date! I believe it is the milk that makes the difference as yeast cannot digest lactose so the end result ends up sweeter, and probably the casien proteins also contribute to the texture more than simply water would.

I’ll start by saying I am not very skilled in the kitchen. I don’t bake often but decided to go out on a limb and try these rolls for Christmas dinner. They turned out so great! Even for someone like me, they were easy to prepare. I did find that I had to bake them a little longer than the recipe calls for, to get the bottoms done. But I will definitely be making these again. They made me look like a pro!

These were good, but the amount of time they take because of the many rising times seems excessive for the taste/texture. I'm a baker and usually rising 2x is good enough, typically.

I made this for Thanksgiving and turned out perfect. I don’t have the skills to add the eggs gently, so I substituted about 1/2 cup of veleveeta during that step. It turned out perfect! It was a huge hit and super easy to make.

This recipe was so easy!  I put it together in my Kitchenaid in just 7 minutes. I ran out of AP flour so I substituted 3 cups of whole wheat. So many compliments from the Thanksgiving family.

Started with 7 cups of flour (I converted '7 cups' to grams, as I bake by weight not volume), needed about a cup more to make a soft slightly sticky dough.  Kneaded the whole wad for a few minutes, oiled a bowl and threw it in there; I've put it in the fridge until morning... I'll amend my review tomorrow evening at the earliest, possibly with pictures of how things came out. (review amended :D )

I punched my dough down three times, once an hour after the dough went into the fridge, once about two hours later, and once more about 4 hours later... shaped this morning about an hour after pulling the dough out of the fridge.  Each time I punched the dough down I spritzed it with a water mist.

Shaped (13)  2oz dough balls for the springform pan, (8) for each 9" cake pan, and I froze 5 dough balls for later, for a total of 34.  Whole egg + 1/2 tablespoon of water wash; the 13 had dried onions added to the top, one of the 9" pans had sesame seeds added, and one pan was plain.  All also got a sprinkle of kosher flake salt.  When each pan was almost completely baked, I used a sheet of foil with a hole cut out of the center to shield the outer rolls and brown the inner rolls.  I checked the temperature of the center rolls with a probe thermometer, each pan read 208-210° when finished.   Images of all 3 pans uploaded.  I've never baked rolls in a springform pan, as I usually use an iron skillet - but I may have to buy a couple more springform pans as the sides are straight and result

There was no temperature for “warm” as with most receipes. When sprinkled, yeast formed globules and would not break up. Softened butter would not melt. I had temp at 109. Threw out for few fear someone would eat the yeast.

My only real change was to add another half cup of flour, and these are incredible. Do yourself a favor, make them with plenty of time to spare and let them rise all four times (three for the dough, one for the shaped rolls). Egg wash the tops lightly, and keep an eye on them so they don't overbake. Very little active labor, easy to make and SO very good. The smell in my house right now could make angels weep.

This is a great basic recipe but being a regular bread maker I made a few adjustments. 1st I like most I halved the recipe but I did NOT half the yeast. Also, I used bread flour to ensure full fluffiness.  I increased the flour but not by much and it was mostly done while kneading/working the dough (I have a dough hook but prefer to mix in mixer and knead by hand to control flour and to ensure i do not overwork the dough as this will lead to small dense breads. Finally, another tip: to proof any yeast product quickly and evenly for those (like myself) without a "proof" setting (appox 80 degrees) on your oven. Place dough in a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, place in oven, turn on the light (do NOT turn on the oven) and shut the door. Your breads and yeast items will rise higher, quicker, and evenly every time.

Love this recipe and a favorite of my family.  I took the suggestion of one baker who said to add the salt after the flour. I add the salt after a cup or two of flour.  I also use my Kitchenaide to mix and switch to the dough hook before all the flour is in, then removing it when the dough is off the sides of the bowl and is all smooth and ready to rise.

I absolutely love this recipe. You have to make sure you give yourself enough time during the day as there are multiple risings but it turns out fantastic every time. When I make these they don't last very long. I like a little extra salt so after I drizzle of a putter on I also sprinkle good kosher salt on the tops.

Amazing! I used this recipe for bierocks dough and they couldn't have turned out any better. I ran short on all-purpose flour and had to use 2 cups of whole wheat to finish the recipe, other than that, no changes. I only let rise once, made the bierocks, then one more rise and popped them in the oven. Perfection. Thanks so much for this recipe!

I would only add, that for a novice, remind them to oil the hand when punching down the dough.  The rolls were a huge success and very tasty!

First time ever trying to make homemade yeast rolls and these turned out perfect.  I took a reviewers advice and used extra yeast and I believe that made all the difference in the world.  They turned out scrumptious and golden brown.  I will be using this recipe from now on!

The best dinner rolls I've ever made.  They were light, fluffy, tender and tasty.  Yes, the dough is a little sticky but the only flour I added was to my hands each time I punched it down for the next rise or handled it to create each delectable roll.  Yes, I made 36 rolls, exactly and divided them into *ahem* TWO PANS.  That means, 18 rolls for each pan.  I lavished them in melted butter after taking them out of the oven and kept them together until mostly cooled.  This keeps them flaky and tender.  Excellent recipe and definitely a keeper!

The flavor was good, but we had to knead the dough to properly incorporate all the ingredients to get the dough to rise properly, and this was not in the written instructions.
Also, the 36 rolls was too much for the 9x13 baking dish. The center ones were doughy under the lovely crusty top.
We will make it again and try a half batch in a 8 1/2 x 11 pan to give the buns room to grow and bake evenly.

I use a bread machine to make the dough, reducing the milk to 1.5 to 2 c and the flour to 5 to 6 c depending on how much I'm making then bake in the oven and it turns out wonderfully. I love this recipe, it is the best dinner roll recipe one I've found and always turns out well.

Totally delightful!
Very easy to prepare and these freeze beautifully as well.  Followed the recipe exactly but did add an egg wash along with sesame seeds just to pretty them up a bit more.

This recipe gets five stars - It was delicious and everyone loved them! They are very soft and buttery just the way a dinner roll should be. I used my kitchen aid Professional 6 and it did a great job of kneading and getting the dough ready to rise - It was much quicker than I thought it would be a I say again they were delicious. We made it again for the Sunday following Thanksgiving - We found that making 30 rolls was a better match than 36 as suggested by the recipe - Delicious!

The rolls were excellent. I made half a recipe. Didn't change a thing except for the number of risings. As I was running short of time, I only proofed it twice total and it turned out great. Very soft & fluffy.

I have never made bread or rolls without a bread machine, but decided to give this a try.  
My family loved it!  I didn't change the recipe at all.  Huge hit and I will definitely make again.
Not sure why I didn't have enough dough to make 36 as stated in recipe, however with my family of 4 I didn't need that much.
I'm not much of a cook, but trying to be!  
Thank you for the awesome recipe!

This is my first time baking bread, and this was definitely the recipe to start with! I halved the quantities, though, because that is a lot of rolls! After reading the reviews, I did not add any flour, just used plenty of it on my hands when rolling the dough. The rolls turned out fluffy and light, and I got about 12 decently sized ones out of the recipe. Will definitely make again!

I did a half batch and started it in my bread maker. I didn't make any substitutions from the recipes ingredients just cut them in half.
Adding the milk, sugar and yeast together, I let it bloom then just added all the ingredients into the bread maker on dough setting.
Once it doubled I smacked it down once, rested for 45 minutes and made 16 2-3inch balls in a 9x13 glass pan and proofed again until doubled.
Cooking time was way off for this type of bake, I think I should have used two glass pans instead of one as the inside buns took a long time. After ten minutes I had to tin foil the buns as they were already brown, and cooked for an additional 20 minutes to get the inside cooked.
Overal though they tasted delicious. I did not have to add extra flour, I just greased my hands a bit when forming the dough balls.

Very good!!! I let it rise for 45 min then rolled it in a bunch of smaller than golf ball size. It was enough for 2 big cookie sheets. One went in the freezer and one got covered to rise more. Then when I want to cook the other ones I take them out and put them covered on the counter for 1-1.5 hrs. My kids loved them!!!!!

My first time making dinner rolls. This recipe was easy, a little time consuming as far as from start to finish; with the rising of the dough. So plan that accourdingly if you want them hot and fresh for a meal. The rolls were very good. I will make them again.

I cut the recipe in half, used the exact ingredients and measurements and made on the dough cycle in my bread machine. The dough was perfect, not too sticky. After I formed the rolls, they doubled in about a half hour. I cooked them at 350 for 20 minutes, and they came out perfect. They have a nice flavor and texture.

Wow, these were great.  They had great texture and flavor.   I do not have a bread maker or stand mixer but you can make these without them.  Mine did fall a bit during baking so I think I will only do 2 raises next time.  I will be making these again, thanks for sharing.

I let them rise twice in the bowl and then again after I formed the rolls.  I used half the recipe and since I didn't make huge rolls I got 24, which perfectly filled my new pan.  An egg wash gave them a shiny brown appearance and they were delicious!

The husband and I made these rolls for our Christmas dinner today and they were a HUGE hit. We followed the recipe exactly and encountered no surprises during the process. It was our first time baking anything with yeast and we had a blast. Thank you for a very easy and successful recipe; we will never buy rolls from the store ever again.

The only change I made was adding a little more sugar, and I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk. These rolls awesome! I made them for a thanksgiving dinner of about thirty people and everyone loved them! Some even thought I bought them at the store. My husband had been begging me to make them again! He doesn't even like rolls much, he like biscuits. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I have made these for my family on Thanksgiving several times and everyone always loves them! If I need to save time I will do step 2 (punching down the dough and waiting for it to rise) one time instead of 3 times and they turn out just as good.

Just made these for Thanksgiving dinner and they came out wonderful. I cut the recipe in half and got 24 slider size rolls. They are sweeter than I prefer, hubby says they taste just like King's Hawaiian rolls. I will make them again reducing the sugar, but I believe in making a recipe as written the first time. Reviewing something after making changes isn't fair to the person who posted the recipe.

I have trouble following a recipe.  But I stayed as close as possible since it was my first time. I added a a bit more butter, sugar.  The rising part was like omg... it was exploding from the bowl. So make sure you use a large size bowl. I did the warm milk and yeast and the first rise. The punch down I did too but didn't wait but about 5 minutes for the next rise before rolling into balls. I also used half AP flour and half cake flour (ran out of AP since I was making the recipe out of the blue. The final rise after rolling into balls was good. I used egg wash for the tops before placing in oven. Beautiful shiny brown tops.  The 1/2 cup butter to pour over was way too much. I just used my butter brush and spread it over. Made about 30 rolls. But VERY DELIOCIOUS!!!

made these twice - the salty butter on top really makes them stand out. the second time I subbed a little almond flour, because I had it and why not - but it did make them a bit too heavy. nice recipe, thanks!

I was a little worried when I was making these because the dough was stickier than I'm used to, even with adding a little extra flour.  I only did a few things differently, very minor changes. I halved the recipe and didn't get as many as 18 rolls, but that was fine. I also added about a teaspoon of the sugar to the milk when letting the yeast dissolve and proof.  I do this anytime I make a bread product after learning in a bread baking course you should "feed" the yeast. For the last rising, after forming the dough into balls, I let them rise right in the pan I was going to bake them in.
The rolls turned out perfectly and were delicious. This recipe is going in with my favorites!

YUM!!  These were so tasty.  Four rise cycles is a lot to go through, but it was worth it.  I cut the recipe in half and threw everything into the bread machine dough cycle, then added about an extra half cup of flour during kneading.  After the first 60 minute rise, I did about 30 minutes for the next three.   The rolls came out beautifully, and I don't think I'll be searching for another recipe to try.

Every year I try making something new for thanksgiving dinner.  This was my first time making any type of yeast bread and My guests absolutely loved them!
I may have done somethig slightly wrong because these rolls, though super tasty, they were very heavy... (i think i made the balls too big like double size). I ended up with 18 rolls  out of the oven and 0 left over.
I will make these again!

Update:  Easter. Spcial request for me to make these for Easter dinner!!!!!!

Best dinner rolls I've ever had.  This is  near a half century we're talking, mind you.  

The dough for these lovely rolls is soft because the rolls are so light and moist, but they still required a significant amount of extra flour to make a workable dough.  I used the serving adjustment calculator thing to cut them down to 15 rolls and I still had to add a complete extra cup of flour to get it to the point it could be kneaded and worked with.    

I also added 1T of buttermilk powder because I just DO that with bread recipes... Can't help myself.

Amazing rolls!  I can't go to a dinner without someone requesting these rolls! I made no changes to the recipe itself, howevr once I madde them into crescent rolls---just because I felt like it! Worked like a charm. Thanks for the recipe Angie

Excellent recipe.  Followed it exactly and it turn out great.  I think the key is patience:  each time let the dough rest it was for an hour.  If not, the rolls may turn out a bit dense.

These rolls take twice as long to make than the rolls I usually make, but I'm hoping that it's all worth it. The dough makes A LOT.... I had to stop my kitchen aid mixer and do a little at a time... But that's no problem Less baking later :) UPDATE... They are fresh out of the oven and I was SOOOO excited!!! but they are REALLY DOUGHY :(  I'm so disappointed... they look amazing  but they are far too doughy on the inside.... but I'm afraid to cook them any longer as I don't want them over cooked.

This recipe was perfect. I finally found a really warm spot to rise the bread in and it worked beautifully. I made half a recipe and still had plenty to send some home with a friend.  I followed the recipe to a T, but used  my KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook.

I followed the recipe fairly closely  as far as ingredients, but I tend to just throw things in and not get exact measurements so while I didn't follow it to a T, these rolls came out to be quite possibly the softest rolls I have ever made!  I made crescent rolls with them so the pan prep was a little different. I also  brushed the tops with melted butter (ok, you got me, it was only margarine) BEFORE I cooked them (as opposed to after) and I cooked as stated at 400 degrees and I found that I only needed 12 minutes for beautiful golden rolls.

A lot of waiting around for too many rises for rolls that didn't fluff up as much as shown in pictures and they taste weird to me. The first rise also took much longer than directions state I also had to coat my hands in flour so dough wouldn't stick to them.

I have baked this recipe twice.  Once for Christmas and another time at my daughter-in-law's request.  I used bread flour and they came out perfect.  I did not handle them very much before rising and they baked perfectly.  This recipe will be used again for a fund-raiser.  My daughter-in-law's sister asked her to bake a batch for her fund raiser and I just know they will be a hit.  Thanks for such delicious recipes.

I made these rolls for dinner last night to go with pork tenderloin, applesauce, and scalloped potatoes. These rolls are so good, I found myself stuffing one in my mouth while complaining about how full I was. I can usually pass up dinner rolls, and usually just make them for my family, but after one roll I had to go back for another, and then another. I followed the recipe exactly, but put half of the dough in the refrigerator, and used the other half to make twenty rolls. I usually do not write reviews but I felt compelled to let everyone know how amazing these are! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Yummy rolls, although mine didn't get round at the top. It may have been my finicky oven though. I will likely make again. I didn't add more flour or knead which was difficult because they were super sticky, but they turned out light and airy. 

 Made a third of a batch via metric system and it made 16+ (used a whole egg instead  of 3/4 egg and cut back the milk a twitch to compensate).

*UPDATE* made these again and they turned out well. I used fresh yeast instead. I made them with te "Ultimate" rolls recipe on this site and more people preferred those, not these, but everyone agreed they were both good....

These were good, next time I will make them way bigger and more uniform in size. They seemed a bit random, not overly pretty...they tasted fine though.

Fantastic! I made these for Thanksgiving thinking that I would have plenty left for days.  What few were left were eaten for breakfast the next morning.  Following other reviewers advice I cut the milk by 1/2 cup (only used 2 cups) and cut the sugar in half (only used 1/4 cup).  This is enough dough for 2 pans of rolls. Don't hesitate to brush the butter on top when they are done - it really finished them off perfectly. Yummy!

Great recipe! Only thing I would change is a little more sugar (I tend to like my bread a little sweeter), and bake at a lower temperature for a little longer. The inside of the bread was a little undercooked though the outside was nice and crunchy. I concur with the others who mention that it needs a little more flour as well.

I was very happy that these were so easy! And, they tasted great, too. They were a little on the dense side and very yeasty in flavor. The first batch I made, I didn't make them big enough because I thought they would grow a bit more when baking, but they stay the same size. Also, I needed about an extra cup of flower. I did it all by hand. (Instead of using my KitchenAid Stand Mixer.)

A staple in our household! I do split the batches up into two smaller dishes as others have commented that the center ones come out undercooked. My 2 year old can't get enough.

This recipe works out great.  I wouldn't recommend someone who is new with baking bread starting with this for a dinner roll.  It takes a certain kind of instinct to pull it off, but it is a great one for those who have experience.  It is very versatile.  I don't always do the third rise before shaping.  It makes a ton of regular size rolls.  Good for family gatherings. Very important to let brown on top and put butter on after pulling out of oven to make soft.

I am a novice baker and this recipe is my very first attempt at baking buns. It was fun and surprisingly easy to follow the instructions. I found the rolls are a bit sweeter than I like (for a dinner roll), but still scrumptious nonetheless!!! Next time I will see about trying out some handy suggestions. Overall, this is a great recipe! Thanks :)

I brushed these with beaten egg before baking, and they came out beautiful. Definitely need a bigger pan than 9x13. I used a jellyroll, or 1/2 sheet pan.

Oh my goodness!!! These were so delicious!!! I followed the recipe exactly except I halved it (I wasn't sure I had enough flour. When they were done, they were so soft and yummy that I felt I could have eaten the whole batch. When I halved it, it made 12 nice size balls of yumminess :)

I just took a batch of these out of the oven. I have a pan full of big, fluffy rolls that are a light golden brown on top. I didn't make the full 36 servings, so I had no issues with the middle rolls not being done. I didn't let the rolls rise after putting in the pan prior to baking, but that made no difference. They still rose a lot during baking. This is now my go-to roll recipe!

Love this recipe!!!  They made me a family hero.  I only let the dough rise once before shaping and knead the last few turns by hand instead of the mixer.

I probably didn't let the dough rise enough the last time when I had rolled them and might have made them too big. The recipe said 2-3 inches but I made more like 21 rolls rather than the 36 suggested. So the rolls were fluffy enough a little bit dense. The taste was perfect though. I'll be making these again and seeing if I can get them just a bit fluffier.

I changed the servings to 18, and added more flour than the revised recipe called for (the dough was way too sticky to be handled). I punched down and allowed to rise twice, then allowed the rolls to rise in the pan before baking. I suck at bread making, so if I can make these anyone can! I might add a little more salt next time and do an egg glaze, but they were really good. Oh, my balls were also too big (haha). Rookie mistake.

Wasn't what I expected based on the reviews. I wanted a lighter bread. Maybe I used too much flower. I also used a little less sugar. That may have changed the taste.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. It was a hit so I made it again for Christmas. These rolls were RAVED about at both functions. I will NEVER use another roll recipe again. I also plan to use this as regular bread recipe. It is amazing! :D

These were a hit at our dinner table, fluffy and moist. I used an egg wash instead of the butter for the tops.

Absolutely fantastic!  I've always struggled to make a nice fluffy bun, but this recipe fit the bill.  I made 2 batches today, initially I thought the dough was too sticky so I added more flour and the dough seemed too dense so I tried it again, sticking to the 7 cups flour.  I followed both batches through to completion and both turned out but the stickier dough (with 7 cups flour) made much nicer, lighter, fluffier buns.  I had to cook it longer because I only had 30 buns, so baked them 20 minutes which was perfect).  Can't wait to try them again, switching out some of the flour for whole wheat and trying bigger buns that would make better sandwiches).  Definitely a keeper!

These rolls are a new family favorite! I also added an extra cup of flour. And after trial and error I have found out that if the rolls are touching in the pan that they will be doughy in the center, so set them an inch apart and they'll all be perfect!

I make these every Thanksgiving! They are the best! I have made them with all purpose flour as well as half whole wheat half all purpose and they turn out great every time! I don't find it necessary to let the dough rise three times though. I let it rise, punch it down, form the rolls, let them rise and then bake them.

I have made MANY dinner rolls and these were terrible! They looked great in the pan, but did not have a nice texture  and unlike any other dinner roll that I have ever eaten. I will not make them again.

The rolls turned out great, could use a bit more salt. This was my first time ever working with yeast I was a bit scared they would turn out bad, the rolls were rally good and it didn't change the recipe at all. The rolls were a bit on the small side but I'm more the sure that was my falt.. All in all great rolls :) will make again

This recipe is amazing! My whole family loves these. They are super soft and light, not a heavy dense bun at all.  I have made them larger at times by making only 24 and placing them on greased cookie sheets- this size is good for a hamburger or sandwiches. The 36 make a nice size for soup of smaller sandwiches.

these were wonderful. they raised perfectly moist inside. I highly recommend these for any dinner occasion I brushed mine with 1 egg and 2 tbsp of milk you can use water. before baking them they seem to last longer if not gone right away. haven't had them last in my house more then 3 day's the guys's like them for even a quick snack..

First time making rolls, I wanted to make something for the kids lunch boxes for their sandwiches/hamburgers (something w/out all the artificial ingredients)and these turned out great.  Dough was a bit sticky so I added a little bit more flour. We love them! Will continue making these.

Very good rolls! I cut recipe in 1/2 as I didn't need 36 rolls. Used bread flour vs A/P and did 3 (not 4) rises for the dough. Then the rise for the rolls. I did add 1 T. fresh minced rosemary and some garlic powder, also entire tsp of kosher salt. I baked 12 - 2 oz rolls in a muffin pan and froze another 6 - 1.5 oz dough balls for another time. I brushed melted butter on prior to baking and then again when done but didn't need 1/4 C. Maybe 1 T for each application. Nice light, moist rolls with a slight chew. My company loved them and I will make this recipe again, for sure. Even cold the next day they were good. Thanks Cristy, these ARE excellent!

They really are perfect!  They were exactly what I wanted to make.  I had to add a bit more flour because the dough was wet, though.  My family was surprised at how flavorful they were.

this is one of the best rolls ever. i am a young baker who tried this at my lake house with a little bit of help. my family loved it. You should definitely try it. you can make  2 different kinds of rolls depending on how you position them on the pan. it was so scrumptious.

These rolls came out amazing. I've never been able to make nice rolls like this. I did add about half a cup of flour to the dough. I made half the recipe the first time and the second time I added cheese, herbs and garlic powder. Everyone loves these.

I used half wheat flour, and they were great! I want to try them with all wheat flour next time. I also think I'll try them with white flour, because I just can't resist fluffy white rolls straight from the oven! Yummy! Best roll recipe I've found so far!

The recipe is great, but the instructions leave some gaps. Definitely knead the dough before you let it rise, punch it down before forming the small balls, let the small balls rest (covered) 20 min before baking. Also, 400 degrees may be a little much depending on your oven. To get the perfect roll, use an insulated baking sheet, or place an empty pan or pizza stone on the rake below your regular baking sheet. This will protect your rolls from the direct heat from the burners and keep them from burning on the bottom before the roll is done.

Make some cinnamon honey butter for the perfect combo - whip together 1/3 cup confection sugar, 1/3 cup honer, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 cup butter.

These turned out great.  I got about 50 rolls out of the recipe, so lots leftover to freeze for later.  I did 1/3 whole wheat flour, 2/3 white flour and they were great.

The 10 year old who rated this was right!  Better than ice cream!  I was in a hurry so I used quick rise yeast and it only took about 30 minutes to rise instead of 1 hour.  They came out perfect and made the process go much faster.  So yummy and easy!

I really didn't't think I could make these come out properly, especially because I was using gluten-free flour, but they were great! They were too gooey to shape into balls so I  refrigerated them for an hour or two first, then  shaped, put in pan and popped them in the oven. Delicious.

These rolls tasted AMAZING!  I added chopped chives and parsley to give it a little something extra and did an egg white wash on top right before I baked them I ended up with the most beautiful, fluffy, great smelling and tasting dinner rolls.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

Made these for the first time for my family (16 people) at thanksgiving, I thought it had made way too many but they were so popular there were no left overs and I was asked to make them for christmas.  These take some time to prepare, but well worth it.

I made this receipe twice and the first time turned out ...... well lets just say the kids are still using them for hockey pucks. My "hockey pucks" were no fault of the receipe I was ALL ME. So I figured I would give it another try and I am sure glad that I did they turned out fantastic and because of that I have now been recurted to make them for Christmas dinner. 
Happy baking people!

My kids go absolutely ape-poop over these! I substituted coconut milk for regular milk and added a bit more sugar and they are downright decadent. My inner hedonist insists on these occasional, astro-caloric guilty pleasures.

Nice rolls.  Easy, and makes a lot.  I made larger rolls, as I usually do, and tried a technique for baking I found on the Bread in Five website:  using the crock pot and cooking for about 1 hour and 20 mins (I added time to the original instructions bc it didn't seem enough), then broiled for a few minutes to brown.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very fresh and tasty. Easy to make, but they didn't bake in the allotted time. It was hard to get the middle un-gooey. Next time I'll probably put them on a cookie sheet a little ways apart from each other.

Made these again, and they're still delicious.  Besides taking a long time because of the numerous times to raise, it's super easy.  I made a double batch and came out with 6 dozen.  Baked them in muffin tins, and did clover rolls with most, dividing each roll portion into 3 and putting it into the muffin tin.  Just yummy all around.

Made according to recipe and they were wonderful. It was my first time doing the whole rise and punch down thing and after I remembered to put a little shortening and flour on my hands before punching down it went great. Made some in a muffin tin and the rest on a cookie sheet... I really like the muffin tin ones best.

I made the dinner rolls the day before Thanksgiving and they were pretty tasty. I was a little disappointed because the rolls in the middle were not completely baked like the ones on the edge. I think that using a larger dish would do the trick.  Like some readers suggested I added half cup of flour and still sticky when trying to shape into a ball. This is my first time making bread so maybe next time I will do better.

This was an excellent roll. I followed the advice from other reviews and I did add additional flour for easier handling. The dough was still a little sticky but it turned out fine. I was very happy with how it turned out even though I dropped one rise time. I plan to make again.

This.Was.Amazing. I make bread every year, but this is the lightest, airiest, fluffiest, most wonderful bread EVER. I made some "mini" twisted loaves (each person might have had 1/2 a loaf - except we couldn't stop!) - and because these were bigger than your description (3x8 for my mini "challah"), I kicked the temp up to 425 and gave them 15 minutes in the pre-heated oven. They were AMAZING. I'm making smaller ones later - and I'll drop the temp back to 400 and go for 10 minutes - I expect wonderful things! Thanks so much!!!

pretty decent recipe. as other ratings stated, the recipe needs more flour (at least when adjusting to a smaller portion). It needed quite a bit more actually.. I made 15 servings and had to add upwards to a 1/2c more. I let them rise pretty good, but they still weren't as fluffy as I would have liked.. a little dense. All in all, I liked these, but I'm still looking for a keeper.

Absolutely fabulous! I am not an expert with yeast, and don't make bread often. I followed the directions and it yielded perfectly fluffy dinner rolls! The recipe does make a ton, but these are good for sandwiches the next day!

I had to make this a couple of times.  The first time my dough didn't rise.  Don't make my mistake - the milk should be LUKEWARM not CLOSE-TO-HOT-WARM.  I basically killed the yeast the first time by having my milk be too warm.  Also, like many others, I had to add an extra cup of flour.  Finally, when the dough DID rise, I brushed the tops of the rolls with an egg wash before putting them in the oven.  Made the tops extra shiny.  :-)

I have found my lifelong dinner roll recipe! These are amazing.  Be careful to look at how many one batch makes--- I did not and they came rising out of my bread machine!  These also freeze very well before the second rise to make another day or share with a friend :)

The smell of this dough brought me back to thanksgiving as a kid. I halved the recipe and used bread flour, they came out great. Love that you don't need to knead or roll out dough. Keeping it in the bowl cuts down on cleanup. Definitely need to use1/2 to 1 c more flour as others have put. The only tip I have is to not try to make these pull away biscuits, they came out a little underdone in the center when I did that. Place 1/2 inch apart on sheet to let cook evenly.

I can't give this recipe 5 stars yet because I screwed them up LOL. I followed to recipe ALMOST to a T. I don't know if over-mixing the dough does anything but it took forever to mix in all the flour even after I switched to the hook attachment. I might just use my bare hands next time....might be more therapeutic and won't leave my hand shaking from holding the mixer all that time.  So when I say I screwed the up, I mean I made them too big (3 in) AND I cooked them in a Pyrex dish - I'm thinking I should have made them smaller and put them in a metal pan. I use a convection oven, but all the middles were still raw even after 10 extra minutes. So I cut off the tops, which were find to eat, then baked the bottoms for another 10 minutes! LOL  So they taste good, but they are brown tops and ugly train wreck bottoms. They turned out more like buiscuits than rolls in texture. Not what I was expecting.  Please note, this was my first attempt at a yeast bread. I'm hoping I can find a recipe that allos for a soft top and not a hard crust.

7/2016 Update: I've gotten to be a better baker and can now say these are perfect! I make 9 large rolls from a half recipe, baked in an an 8x8. People fight over these! I make these exactly to recipe and while the dough is sticky at first, after rising a few times it is fine to work with. 


4/2010These took a lot longer to bake than stated (and I did half batches in an 8x8 so I didn't have the issue of the outside cooking before the inside did).  The dough is also pretty sticky.  Otherwise, these are great; I even froze the extra dough I had and the ones from frozen dough were just as good as the freshly made ones.

These turned out perfect.  I have never made homemade rolls before and these exceeded my expectations!  I followed instructions exactly as written, except for placing the individal balls of dough in my muffin pans. These will become a staple at my house...they taste so much better than store-bought rolls.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these for Easter dinner and they were a huge success! I used 1/2 the recipe and did not change anything besides brushing the tops with butter before I cooked them instead of after.  They came out golden brown and delicious!  Will defiantly be making these again.

I have to say that I have tried many, many roll recipes and I have to say this one is number 1 in my estimation. The recipe is so easy and the rolls come so soft and very good. My family loves them. This will be one of my favorite roll recipe that I will keep coming back to.

I struggled with getting these to rise as much as the directions said, so they didn't turn out quite as fluffy as some of the pictures. But boy did they taste delicious! :) I'll definitely make these again sometime.

Truly the best rolls that my family has ever eaten.  They have a great density, texture and taste.  We are a family of four, so I made a 1/2 recipe.  We turned out 20 rolls.  Though some reviews recommended additional flour, we live in the High Country (8,900ft), so I  left the dough sticky (as it was per the recipe), reduced the baking temperature to 350 and baked the rolls for 10 minutes.  Perfect, perfect perfect!  Golden brown and delicious.

These are the best rolls ever. Even better than the ones I grew up with. I put a little red food coloring in them so they were pink for Valentine's Day. We make them a couple times a month now.

Best dinner rolls I've ever had! I made them with white whole wheat flour and they came out light and fluffy and delicious. They omitted one step in the recipe: be sure to knead the dough for about 10 minutes before the first rising. And you really should prepare the baking dishes BEFORE you form the rolls! :-)

These rolls were tasty out of the oven, but delicious the next day. Pretty easy and straightforward to make, however it takes almost twice as long as stated to prepare if you let it rise and punch it down three times then let it rise another time in the pan like it says to in the directions. I started with 2 1/2 hours in mind and the rolls were still rising through dessert.

Excellent recipe! As others have mentioned the dough is sticky & you need to use 7 1/2 or 8 cups of flour. My recipe made exactly 36, I used one 9x13 and one 9x9 for baking. Make this if you need a really good roll for any occasion or simply just because!

I use this recipe for my bacon/saurkraut rolls and my 93 grandmother who made many a loaf of bread in her life said it was the best she had! I roll the dough out, drizzle a little butter on and sprinkle it with diced/cooked bacon, saurkraut and dill. I then roll it up like a jelly roll and cut them in 1 1/2" slices. They rise up light and fluffy and taste amazing!! Unlike many reviews, I found I don't use the full amount of flour and would not use extra for sure, both when I knead by hand or make a single batch and use my Kitchen Aid Mixer. The dough is not sticky at all and easy to roll out and work with! By far one of the best doughs I have worked with!! I make this all the time and will continue to do so as I get rave reviews each time!!

These were good, however, I think I baked them too long cause they were a tad dry.  And, next time I make these I will add just a tad more sugar.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. The rolls are perfect, and you do get a lot. They are super easy to make and taste wonderful. I did, however, add about an extra 1/2 cup of flour and brushed the rolls halfway through baking with melted butter and again when they came out of the oven. I made about 20 dozen for Thanksgiving dinner and didn't have a single one left.

These rolls were very tasty. The trick to making the round shapes is to put a little flour on your hands or else the dough will be too sticky to handle.

These are the very best rolls I have ever made and with my substitutions the best dairy-free rolls I have ever had. To accommodate our dairy allergies I substituted plain Silk soymilk for the milk and Earth Balance for the butter.   I did not add any additional flour and I refrained from attempting to knead or roll out. This is a very wet dough, don't expect to handle it without well greased hands.  The process does take a long time but is well worth the wait. I started the dough just after 9 am and they were ready for the oven after the Thanksgiving side dishes came out around 2:30 pm. The rolls were absolutely fabulous. Thank you so much for sharing!

These turned out Perfect! I have been having trouble making yeast rolls and thought it was just me but decided to try this last recipe and they were amazing so light, and fluffy! i followed the recipe exactly except added 1/4 c flour to reduce the stickiness of the dough.

Worth the work.  I suggest adding a 1/2 cup of flour and egg wash them before baking. OMG!!!

This recipe made my kitchen smell a little too yeasty-kind of like beer. I waited until the rolls browned slightly before taking out of the oven-it was the full 15 min. Everything baked well and the tops of the rolls were good, but the bottoms were too crunchy for our liking. I have made rolls with only ~4 cups of flour that make just as many as this recipe does too. This recipe calls for a lot of flour! Sorry, I don't think it's worth it for us.

Followed the recipe to a T and thought the batter was a bit to sticky to work with...next time will add more flour and knead a little so forming the balls will be easier...the rolls did come out very tasty though and I brushed honey butter on top..

This is an amazing roll recipe I've made it twice now and they just don't seem to last the week. My husband loves 'em and claims that they taste like his favorite store-bought rolls. This is EXACTLY the recipe I was looking for! So very worth the time!

These rolls looks so delicious when they came out of the oven, yet they were just ok.  Maybe it was because I had high expectations from the other reviews but they were not my favorite.  I changed the recipe to make 24 and it made 24 large rolls, I was expecting 15 or so.  Thanks for sharing though!

I halved the recipe, and added 1/2 flour.  I also wasn't quiet sure how much dough to put into one roll and ended up making mini rolls (still equally as tasty).

My family ate ALL of them in one sitting - they were a hit! I've been asked to make them again.

These rolls are so easy I have made them four times between Thanksgiving and the 27th of December!  The only problem I have is that the center rolls don't always completely cook.

This was my first attempt at a yeast bread and it turned out wonderful. Very tasty recipe... reminds me of the bread they used to serve us in high school. (I know... comparing it to school food isn't necessarily taken as a compliment... but this should be.) Great bread for a beginner.

These are the best rolls I have ever made.  They rose super high and fluffy.  You need a little bit more flour then called for, and you won't be able to fit all the rolls into a 9x13, you will have to bake them in 2 batches.  If you have never baked bread before, make sure that all your ingredients are warm, and these will turn out great!!!

I'm not sure how you could possibly fit 36 of these in one 9x13 pan.  But I ended up using a 9x13 and an 8x8 (24 in one, 12 in the other).   I also had to use 8 cups of flour because it was way too sticky (more like batter) with just 7.   When I was rolling the balls I put a little flour on my hands each time to keep it from sticking so much.  Still a very tasty, delicious and easy to make roll!  I love light and fluffy and this did it for me.

I just finished making these and they turned out fabulously!  They were very easy to make.  I did end up using two 9X13 pans and an 8X8 though.  I wanted to give them plenty of room to expand. I used soy milk and vegan butter to make them non-dairy. Someone else had mentioned that they had a very yeasty taste, and I did find that too, but they're still delicious.

Just like grandma used to make. Thank you so much for the recipe. I have been searching years for a dough recipe to make grandmas pepperoni rolls. I followed the instructions exactly, except I needed additional time for rising. I also added slivers of pepperoni on the last step. Light and fluffy, and melts in your mouth. Definately a keeper

This recipe was great. I cut the recipe in half since it was for just the two of us. I added a little bit of salt to the top with the melted butter and it was great. My husband loved them too. It took time to make but it was worth it. Nothing from the bread machine would be so good.

Great taste...VERY heavy! This didn't stop my guest from eating more than one, though! They're best right out of the oven, but get a little dry the next day. Love the buttery, yeasty flavor. There's almost a wine-like flavor about them too. Easy to make aside from how sticky they are to work with when balling them up for the pan!

yummy when they are fresh out of the oven.  Dough is a little heavy and sticky, but they rise beautifully in the oven.  I'll make these again.

These are the best rolls ever. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfecttttt.... just like the picture. My son has been home for a whole 6 minutes and has already scarfed down 2 of them. He can't believe that I made them! The only thing I did that was different than the recipe is I cooked them on cookie sheets (or jelly roll pans). This dough is a pleasure to work with. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I have tried many roll recipes off this site, and my search is finally over. I absolutely love these! I halved the recipe, but i think next time i will do the whole and freeze what i don't need, so I'll be able to make them more often :)

I have only made bread a few times, so I consider myself a novice in baking bread.  Having admitted to that, this recipe was fabulous and very easy!  My rolls look a little funny because I was too scared to handle the dough too much while punching it down, but now that I know I can turn it while punching it, I will feel more comfortable next time.  The family loves them!  I also made a back of Honey Butter to go with them.

These turned out great.  My husband loved them.  He said they were exactly how dinner rolls should taste.  They were pretty easy to make also but a little messy!
