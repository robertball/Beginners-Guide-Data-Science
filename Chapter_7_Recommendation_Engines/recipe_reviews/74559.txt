Until now I've had very rigid thinking that ice cream has to start with a cooked egg custard in order for it to be top-notch.  Not so here.  I resisted the urge to add egg yolks as I usually do, basically as an experiment, and I was pleasantly surprised! This is some creamy ice cream! And what an unusual flavor--not quite banana, not quite citrus, but a recognizable, delicious blend of the two. With no cooked custard involved, this was a snap to make.  I made this in six 1's in order to fit my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker, adding an extra half banana, and used 2 parts cream to 1 part half and half.  To ensure the best results, once mixed, refrigerate for several hours before churning. I'm so glad I tried this!

My husband said this was the best ice cream he had ever eaten...and we are ice cream fanatics.  I made this as six twos and still had a little bit too much for my smaller ice cream freezer, so I just poured the rest into a plastic container with a lid and stuck it in the freezer.  Both batches turned out great.  Also the juice from the oranges and lemons combined to make about 6 oz. of juice.  So if I'm really short on time I can buy fresh juice at the grocery store instead of squeezing my own.  Thanks for a yummy new recipe!

This is the best ice cream in the world!  A friend shared this recipe with me a long time ago, and said it was best made with peaches.  She was right!  It's also great with strawberries, or blackberries.  Just substitute the bananas with 3 cups of your favorite fruit -- it's sure to be a hit!

I made some adjustments for my 6 quart ice cream maker. I wanted to make strawberry ice cream so I pureed 2 lbs of strawberries in my blender and did 3 Fours, i.e. 4 cups each - milk, 1/2 & 1/2 and sugar and then added the pureed strawberries to the mix. It was perfect and fed 17 people. If everyone would have taken the same amount, it would have fed 15 people easy. Great easy recipe and a real crowd pleaser.

Very good and easy recipe! I cut it down to six "ones" for my kitchen aid ice cream maker and it was perfect. I substituted 1 1/2 c mashed strawberries for two of the bananas and added the zest from the orange. I also substituted half and half for the cream. Very refreshing and simple.

This is really refreshing and takes *no* effort.
Somebody ate one of the bananas I intended to use, so I cut back the recipe to "Six two's", which still was enough to fill my Cuisinart ice cream maker twice.  I used a blender so the bananas would be mixed in well, and used half and half for part of the cream.  On the second batch, I added a splash of coconut extract and some orange zest. We liked it better that way; next time will try lemon zest.

OH MY GOSH! This is just so refreshing and delicious -- there just aren't words. I had to half it because my ice cream freezer doesn't do two quarts but it worked out great.

Loved this simple ice cream recipe. I blended all the fruit juices and the bananas so no pulp problem. Used an old fashoned ice cream maker with ice and salt...it worked great! Really rich...Will make again!

This is an awesome recipe!  So refreshing!  I received this recipe from a friend over 30 years ago!  It has been a favorite in my family all these years!  I've never run across it anywhere until now!  The name of the recipe makes it so easy to remember how to make it.

Really good recipe. Somewhat new at making ice cream. I used the orange and lemon pulp in the ice cream. The pulp clogged the beater. Next time I'll chop pulp well in the blender. Also used lemon zest. Will do again.

I have to say that this recipe is the best! When I was looking for an ice cream recipe, I saw this one and figured I would try it.  I am so glad that I did because my kids fight me for it.  I did make a few modifications though. I used orange juice instead of squeezed oranges (1 orange= 1/4 cup of juice). I also did the same for the lemons and it came out perfect.

This is a pretty good fruit ice cream. Easy to make. I did 'one sixes' in order to fit my kitchenaid ice cream maker. Take note that the order of ingredients is crucial.  The first time I made it I added the cream after other ingredients by mistake and the fat separated and it didn't work. Second time round, I  whipped the sugar (subtracted a few tablespoons from what called for so that it wouldn't be too sweet) and cream for about two minutes, blended the fruit juices and banana and added them after the milk. the result is a creamy texture, refreshing fruit ice cream. I find the taste pretty good but not superb.

This is our family recipe too, except we make it with crushed pineapple instead of banana. Here is our modified version (for 1 qt) (also is a little less rich)  1 3/4 c. milk 1/3 c. cream 3/4 c. sugar -- 1/3 c. oj 1 1/2 T. lemon juice 3/4 c. crushed pineapple 1/4 c. corn syrup (not in original recipe, but adds smoothness)  Add fruit and juices after milk/sugar mixture is partially frozen.

absolutely wonderful recipe. I was afraid my Cuisinart wouldn't be able to handle 6 3's, so I too did 6 ones. I substituted 1/2 cup greek yogurt and 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt for the milk as I had lots of yogurt on hand. I also had just bought some fresh cherries from the market and threw in about a cup of chopped cherries after the first 5 minutes.  Exceptionally tasty and creamy.  The flavour was delightfully tangy and I think that frozen mango pieces would have been an even better addition.  Thank you for the recipe

Incredible flavor!  I'm not a huge fan of bananas, but couldn't get enough of this!  We had trouble eating just two helpings a piece.  We'll definitely be making this again.  Were already dreaming of nectarine, orange, and lemon, or perhaps crushed pineapple, orange and lime.  We made 6 twos.  Thanks to the viewer who mentioned 2 oranges gave 4 oz. of juice, and 2 lemons gave 3 oz.  This was a great time saver as I used my carton of orange juice and bottle of Real Lemon juice!

I honestly don't see what the big deal about this ice cream is.  It was just okay.  There was not enough orange flavor in it and it was too sweet.  Basically a really sweet banana ice cream.  Not what I was looking for at all.

My Mom passed away in January and I'm making a cookbook from the family recipes.  I found a small receipt from a store called Kuhn's dated May 28, 1964 in my Mom's recipe box, and on the back was this exact recipe, written in her writing.  The cool thing is, I remember helping her make this (I was banana masher!)  I googled it because the receipt didn't say "ice cream" so I wasn't sure what it was. I'm really tickled to find out what it was and be able to make the connection to my memories.  This has been such a wonderful project for me and I sure enjoyed this ice cream growing up!

Family really liked this.  Very fresh flavor.  I used skim milk so am wondering if this is what made the ice cream so hard and crystallized after it was frozen solid?  Would give it 5 stars if it had been a smoother conistency.

This is an extremely easy ice cream to make. I was just making it for myself and my husband, so I cut it in third just to make a smaller batch and the division was so easy. The one thing I didn't like was that it tasted too much like bananas to me, but maybe it was just my fruit? Anyways, it's quick and easy, and my husband liked it, but I'm not the biggest fan of bananas, maybe next time I'll try with other combinations of fruit.

I didn't know what to expect when I made this with my new ice cream maker but this turned out to be very interesting and rather refreshing. I'm not giving this 5 stars because i'm not really partial to orange ice cream and this really felt like a rather acid orange ice cream with a hint of banana. the texture is wonderful but as I said, too orangy for my taste. but then i'm not really into trying unusual combinations , i usually stick with chocolate, vanilla and berries ice cream. but the ratings made me want to try it and i do not regret it. now i have a recipe to impress my mother in law with (she always makes us guess what ingredients went into her very colorful and very unusual meals, I swear she lives to surprise us and is always on the look for new and preferably weird recipes, though they're usually tasty. I figure i'll turn the table on her which would be fun! thanks) it also reminded me of a layered cake my mother used to make with fresh orange juice soaked biscuits, whipping and custard creams and sliced bananas, kiwis and strawberries, tastes almost the same.

Very delicious and so easy to make. I love it especially since I have most of these ingredients sitting around my house all the time. My father loved it and he isn't much of an ice cream eater, but he sure does love his fruit. I will keep on making this recipe all summer long.

My grandkids had fun "churning" this in my "hand crank" one quart Donvier ice cream maker.  Of course the recipe had to be reduced to Six Ones, as others have suggested.  Otherwise, the only change I made was to add some of the orange and lemon zest for extra citrus flavor.  We served ours in waffle bowls for an extra treat. Granddaughter isn't crazy about bananas.  She wasn't aware of them lurking in the mixture as I had made it ahead.  She took a bite or two, got a puzzled look on her face, asked if there was banana in the ice cream and proceeded to devour it.  I may try fresh peaches or strawberries another time.  I also like another reviewer's suggestion to replace a small amount of sugar with a bit of corn syrup to help maintain the original creaminess of this recipe after freezing.  Although when making a quart, truthfully, there are not a lot of leftovers!

This was easy and it did have a different and unusual flavor. My family gave it mixed reviews,though. One son loved it and finished the whole batch practically single -handedly over a few days. Husband and other son had a small serving each and didn't want any more.  Good if you like fruity flavors but dissapointing for those who like a more traditional taste ( chocolatey,nutty etc)

Really great recipe. Made this to accompany my husband's lemon pound cake.    I halved the recipe so that my Cuisinart ice cream maker could accommodate it.    I used a mini food processor to blend the bananas first to prevent any pulp problems...    Also added a pinch of lemon and orange extract for some extra citrus zing.

So creamy and fresh! My DH was suspicious of all the citrus going into the ice cream but he absolutely loved this recipe. The flavor that comes through is a subtle banana vanilla with a bright crisp note to it. Great stuff!

I made this for a family barbeque and it was a big HIT! Followed recipe exactly. I was able to get local fresh milk with a high butterfat content. YUMMY! Icecream was unbelievably smooth & creamy. The banana flavor definitely stands out over the citrus. We had leftovers and it was delicious even 2 days later (let stand at room temp to soften). I prefer a more strong citrus flavor, so next time I'll try one less banana & adding some lemon or orange extract like another reviewer suggested. THANKS for sharing this recipe :)

Good icecream, would describe it as a tangy banana icecream. I give it 4 stars because in my opinion it was too sweet, supersweet, I made it a second time with only 2 cups of sugar and it worked great.

This was the best ice cream I have ever made in my life!! The flavors of the bananas, oranges and lemon is perfect!  I'm using this base of the milk,cream and sugar from now on. I like that I don't have to put eggs in it.-

Oh my gosh!! The easiest ice cream recipe ever.  Creamy and wonderful, my company loved it. I used strawberries and it was lovely.  I also have a small ice cream freezer and used 6-ones.  I will be making this all summer.  Will try the bananas next time.

This is a great recipe.  I got it when I moved to a new town and one of the women at church always made it for the annual ice cream dinner.  It's easy and tastes great.  I use 6 cups of half and half, but otherwise, just as the recipe calls for.

wow! a delicously refreshing creamy ice cream. I could taste the fresh oranges, lemons and bananas. It was such a nice balance of flavors, nothing overpowering each other in this ice cream. I had to cut this recipe down to fit my ice cream maker so I made 1 of everything. I also decided to add a zest of orange to the milk mixture. I put the milk mixture into the refrigerator to let everyhting set and chill a few hours before churning. It took almost 25 minute to make in the ice cream maker and there was a nice hint of citrus-y flavors which I love. I will definitely make this again.

This ice cream is delicious. I used two of everything and it still did not all fit in my Cuisanart ice cream maker, in fact only about half fit in. It's a week later and the texture is still great-did not get too hard at all. At first I thought the banana flavor was too strong but as it sat in the freezer it seemed to get toned down. I will make it again.

Very smooth and creamy.  This tastes like a perfect blend of sherbet and ice cream.  We have made this recipe for 15-20 years and have never strayed from the original ingredients.  It is so good!

This ice cream is amazing--refreshing & delicious with a unique flavor. The citrus reminds you of sherbet/ the rich creaminess of ice cream. Since peaches were in season (& a favorite)I used a reviewer's suggestions of replacing the bananas with 3 cups of pureed fruit. Tossed a handful of fresh mint in the blender with the fruit (try this--its really great!!), added a teaspoon of vanilla. Chilled prior to churning (also a reviewer's reccomendation), then allowed to ripen, it set up to perfection. Yum!! Everyone had extra servings, then we ate it for lunch (not with, but AS) the next day. Fabulous recipe w/ excellent advice from others! Many thanks--definitely a keeper!

This ice cream was creamy, but had a strange taste that my family didn't care for. Next time that I take the time to make homemade ice cream,  I will go bak to my old tried and true recipe.

I really liked the flavor in this.  Bf wasn't so enthusiastic--I'd forgotten he doesn't like orange that much.  Oh, well.  He adores ice cream, so he'll probably eat it anyway.  I also made this in 6 1s as well in order to fit it in my small ice cream maker.  I just dumped all the ingredients in my food processor, although I put the banana in first and let it run for a minute or two before putting in the rest.  Bf asked me to use splenda instead of regular sugar, so I did, and it worked fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is delicious! Very easy to make! My family loved it. This recipe filled my 4 qt. freezer container to below the fill line so there was plenty of room for expansion. After hardening, the consistency was still creamy and smooth. Will definitely use this recipe again! Highly recommend to everyone!

Wonderful recipe.  The flavor of the banana is dominant with the orange and lemon juice adding a nice tartness.  I followed another reviewers advice and used six 2's and like her I had too much for my countertop freezer.  Could six 1 1/2's work?  I wonder.

Good recipe.  I made it with peaches instead of bananas, and I think it needed less lemon that way.  It was still good, though, and very easy.

LOVE this recipe.  Super easy to throw together and the taste was wonderful.  Made it for dessert after a mexican meal and it was refreshing and light.  All the guests loved it so much that we didn't have any leftovers.  I did add just about a tsp of orange extract as suggested.  Served it with blueberries on top.  I might try to add just a little orange zest the next time I make it.  I think this will be a regular summer dessert.

really good recipe.

ok, I switched a few things here to, but just to make it easier. And I have one kid that won't eat bananas.

So I did 6 X 2 and still had 2 batches for my machine.  I added cut up strawberries for one batch and blended the mix in a blender to make stawberry icecream for the second batch.

I used skim milk because thats what we have and used the juice because again thats what we had. It came out great. really suprised at the blending made that much flavor difference but it did. Both where good.

Very yummy.  I made it about 1/2 to 2/3 recipe since it's just my husband and I.  Next time, I think I'd add more bananas and maybe some banana extract to make a more banana-y flavor.

My family loves this ice cream.  The only changes I've made is to adjust the amount of the ingredients to fit my 1.5 at ice cream maker.  I have also tried substituting either mango or raspberry, blueberry and blackberry combination for the banana.  Just need to strain the mix when using the berries.

This recipe was the easiest I have ever tried for ice cream so I was pretty excited about it. I was also excited to try it because the great reviews but I have to admit my family was not loving it and my husband made comment that it tasted like whip cream not ice cream. I think it is just as good, if not better than some of the dry mixes you can buy for your ice cream freezer but I think I prefer the cook kind.

One of the best ice creams I've ever made. I swear I could sell this stuff! Only change was I used fresh pineapple instead of banana because my hubby doesn't like banana. Even my oldest son who hates ice cream ate a small bowl. And so easy to remember. Thank you for this recipe.

I made this exactly as written the first time (well six twos to fit my 2-quart ice cream maker) because I don't believe one should change a recipe and then review the changed version. I was surprised by the texture given that it isn't a custard-based ice cream. Very smooth and creamy. But the flavor is a bit odd. Too much citrus to banana. The second time I made it (again, six twos) I substituted 1 small package frozen raspberries for the bananas (thawed and strained to remove seeds) and used the juice of two large lemons. No orange juice. I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups. Perfect.

I went crazy making homemade ice cream a couple months ago… trying different recipes, flavors, combinations, etc.  Now that is it time to make more, my husband only wants this recipe.  I have to say it really is so refreshing and has a really lovely taste!  Christmas or not, we are making this banana flavored ice-cream for sure!  Couldn't be simpler.  If you are making ice cream for the first time, this is a great recipe to start with!  Enjoy!

Very tasty and fresh! Boyfriend totally loves this ice cream and insists it tastes like kiwi. I can't say i tastes like kiwi but i has a wonderful fruity flavor. Super easy to make with just knives in the food processor. Once I substituted the banana with fresh sour cherries, a drop of almond extract and added some more cream for a little extra softness - it was a hit with everyone.

This was a great recipe.  We have an ice cream maker and my husband has used it more then me but I was looking for something different to serve for a barbeque.  Boy was it a hit.  I used 2 peaches, 4 apricots, 1 banana plus the orange and lemon.  Awesome I had read the reviews and one said to refrigerate before making, I made it the night before and churned it the next morning awesome.  Thanks so much

I may have rated this before, but the longer I have the recipe, the more I like it.  This is soooo good with fresh fruit and makes a light summer dessert without heating up my kitchen.  It keeps well in the freezer without getting icy.

This ended up being a delicious and creamy ice cream. I made it without the bananas so I would have a just citrus ice cream and it was delicious.

This was super easy to make (I used 6 "2s"); I put everything in the blender and blended, then poured into an ice cream maker. Flavor was good, although my husband thought it was too banana-y, and I might would cut it down to 1, next time. Also, it was TOO sugary; I thought it was eating a bowl of sugar. As I was reading the recipe, I thought it seemed too much, but my husband says I can never follow a recipe, so I figured I should stick with it;-p Next time, I would cut the sugar in half.

Great Ice Cream, I used the recipe doubled because I have a 5 quart freezer,  I had to make two batches!  Not sure where the 2 quart yield came from but mine yielded a lot more.  I also made a double batch and added a quart of strawberries,   great flavor!

I grew up eating this for special occasions in the 1960's and 1970's and had lost the recipe. I am so glad that I found it on this site. It is truly one of the best recipes for ice cream. It's sweet, tart and refreshing.

(3 1/3 stars actually) I thought this was good. It just didn't knock my socks off. :-( After reading the reviews I kind of expected it to. I made it just as stated except I used 1 of everything as that's all my ice cream maker will hold. It had a good flavor - kind of like a fruit salad in ice cream form. My son who LOVES fruit and ice cream, I thought for sure would eat this up, he didn't finish his bowl. Not sure what that was about. :-( I will probably not be making again.

Wow, so good.  I didn't have bananas but I had fresh apricots so I replaced the bananas with 3 cups pureed apricots.  The pulpy stuff did gunk up my ice cream maker but it was well worth it.

I've always made ice cream with seasonal fruits, but this was the EASIEST and freshest flavor EVER.  The citrus real adds that "brightness" to the flavor.  We topped ours in the bowl with toasted coconut and chopped toasted almonds.  It was an awakening!

I make this recipe for a huge birthday bash and even tho it didn't set at all in my ice cream maker and I didn't add the bananas (turned brown on the way to the party) it was FANTASTIC!!! The favor was so refreshing and light that I will make it again and again once I find a way to make it set in the maker. I won't add the bananas next time either cause the flavor was just so perfect. Thank you for helping me get outta my "gotta have chocolate ice cream" rut by submitting this WINNER recipe!

The easiest and best ice cream I have ever made!  It went down a storm... I made other flavours by adding melted chocolate, and made vanilla (cheated by just adding some vanilla essence/flavouring!

Wow... very good & super creamy. I used only 2 of each with the exception of 3 lemons & only 1 orange. Needless to say the base of this recipe is awesome & the other ingredients can be modified to suit your tastes. Next time I might use all lemons. Great recipe & so easy to make!

I had to taste after 3 hours hardening, this ice cream is delicious. I added the orange extract as sugested. Next time I'm thinking of adding some mango to the mix.

Easy to make - I used canned peaches, coz that was the only thing I had on hand.  Tasted refreshing.  Only thing was that it's very hard straight out from the freezer, and I need to let it sit outside for sometime before it "thaws" and becomes less icy, and easier to scoop.

I made this ice cream to use up some fresh peaches I had on hand. I used this recipe because I'm pregnant and cannot consume raw eggs and this recipe fit the bill.  When I was removing the ice cream from the ice cream maker I tasted it before transferring it to the freezer and was very happy with the flavour.  Unfortunately, once the ice cream froze thoroughly, it was  like a brick!  Very difficult to scoop like ice cream and the texture was very flaky.  So in the end, the flavour was really nice, but the texture and consistency were way off.

Okay...I'll admit, I totally screwed this recipe up by accidentally adding 3 cups of orange juice!!!  OOPS!!!  Even doing that, it was DELICIOUS!  (I did have to finally freeze it as it would not freeze in the Cuisinart ice cream maker.)  Any recipe that you can screw up that  bad and STILL turn out well deserves more than 5 stars!

The easiest ice cream recipe ever! I made Six 2s and used the 6oz juice formula given in the  reviews (4oz store oj & 2oz fresh lemon juice from 2 medium sized lemons). I will try peaches next.  Thanks for this yummy recipe.
