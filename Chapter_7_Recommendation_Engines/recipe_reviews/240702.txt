My husband made this for Christmas Eve dinner. It was delicious. Since neither of us are a fan of goat cheese we just substituted regular cream cheese for the goat cheese. It was a beautiful presentation and very tasty indeed.

This party cheese ball is savory yet tangy and a different twist on the traditional cheddar-based cheese ball.  I made this for a Christmas gathering, and everyone really liked the taste of the cream cheese and goat cheese blend.  For the outside, I used raspberry-glazed almonds and also served it alongside pepper-jelly.  The savory cheese, fruit-glazed almonds, and sweet-spicy pepper jelly was a great combination to spread on party crackers!

It made a big hit at my Christmas party.  The presentation is great.  I didn't have the herbs that were suggested so I just added Lemon Pepper and garlic powder instead.  The goat cheese is an important ingredient so try to use this without substituting.  
There's a lot of almonds in this dish but splurge for the effect.

Everybody loves the presentation! Guests hesitate digging in for fear of recking the artwork. The recipe is for a lot of people so you may want to cut back. Itâ€™s not saveable as the nuts will go soggy.

I love Chef John's recipes but this was not for my taste. I did not like the taste of  all of the herbs, I felt like the tarragon overpowered everything. Next time I will try it with half the amount of herbs.  It made for a beautiful presentation however, very festive!

Delicious and impressive!  I did a taste test with roasted and raw almonds, and roasted won hands down.  Couldn't find fresh tarragon, so used probably about 1/4 tsp. dried, and I think that worked just fine.   Also used about twice as much garlic as the recipe called for, and used garlic salt instead of plain salt.  I love garlic.  Used saran sprayed with cooking spray to help mold the pinecones shape.  It did make a lot!  Everyone loved it and took pictures.

I absolutely love goat cheese and when I saw this recipe included it I knew it would be a hit.  I doubled the recipe to make two and they were completely devoured at my party!

Quite labor intensive but turned out great, relatives raved over the taste. I used a little extra goat cheese and bought a truffle blend instead of plain goat cheese. Would make this again!

This was delicious. It did not take long to assemble.  I would half the recipe for a smaller pine cone as the recipe is quite a large portion. Way to go Chef John! I served this to a group of Australians and at first sight they said, "Is that a hedgehog! Wait a minute its a pine cone!" Too funny from my Aussie  friends.

Hilarious!  My sister used to make a pinecone cheesball 60 YEARS AGO -although I'm not sure the ingredients were exactly the same. Sisters tasted good.

This was a big hit at the party! I added lemon pepper, too. I think you could use almost any cheese ball recipe, but this one is really good. Took to a party of about 12 & there was a lot left over, so you might want to half it. Also, I mixed the ingredients and refrigerated overnight; instead of forming the cone on the plate, as shown in video, I put the refrigerated spread on a piece of plastic wrap to form the cone, placed on platter. And I used smoked almonds...I think honey roasted would be pretty too!

This was so yummy and pretty easy to make. It did not look as pretty as his when I was done... but that's always the case. I did roast the almonds before using them. I highly recommend this for any party.

Loved the cheese with all of the herbs, but the almonds got soft and odd tasting. Is there something that can be done so this does not happen?

The best thing about this is the presentation which is 5 stars plus!!  I am not a goat cheese fan, so I substituted cream cheese.  I also  mixed in 1/2 cup shredded "mexican blend" cheese (cheddar, monterey jack, & asedro), 1 tsp of fresh garlic, 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper, a tsp. of grated onion and then rolled it in cooked, bacon bits before shaping it to add almonds.

Delicious!  And a real showpiece of an appetizer!  Though there were too many almonds for spreading on crackers.  Had to leave some on the plate.  Would make a delicious cheese spread if undecorated and shaped into a ball instead.

this recipe was really delicious and easy to make, but molding it into the correct shape was very messy and was difficult to was off afterwards. I would suggest putting plastic wrap on top of it and then molding, to help with the mess.

The more parsley the more refreshing it tasted. I like the kick of goat cheese so used 6 ounces and cut back 2 ounces of cream cheese. Mine didn't look as beautiful as Chef John's, but everyone dug the pine cone effect.

Made this for Easter. Amazing flavor. Reminds me of Christmas. Very pretty presentation. I can't wait to see how its received. Thanks Chef John for another amazing recipe.
