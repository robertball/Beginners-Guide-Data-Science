I make muhammara regularly as I am of lebanese origin. The main ingredient is missing: red bell peppers. I used about 3 to 4 red peppers and I also add a small spoon of sugar.

This recipe is definitely missing roasted red peppers. I used a recipe from another site that called for them. I think this is the kind of dish that you either love or hate.

Very different, and very nice!  I used orange juice instead of lemon juice, and I used twice as much as the recipe called for (gets thick).  Probably wouldn't want to try doubling lemon juice, though.  Also, no need to chop walnuts or garlic if you have a good food processor.  Sweet, savory, and exotic, I LOVE this recipe!

As is, I can't imagine this would taste very good and definitely nothing like muhammara, so for me, it's zero stars for an incomplete recipe, guess the one star is for the sheer novelty, I googled muhammara to find out what it was supposed to have in it, I've eaten it before and thought it was lovely, a nice change from the usual hummus.  As others have noted it seems to be missing the main ingredient, fire roasted red peppers. Also, 2 tbsp of pomegranate molasses + lemon juice would be mouth puckeringly sour!  Also, and I promise, this will be the last 'also' the taste of this dip is great enhanced by roasting walnuts.  I've made this twice now from a recipe I found on epicurious and subbed panko bread crumbs the last time (time saver!) and it turned out fine.  Definitely worth your time and it keeps well in the fridge for days.

Wow I loved this, so did my mom who hates spicy stuff. I used 3 tablespoons of fresh squeezed pomegranate juice instead of the molasses
