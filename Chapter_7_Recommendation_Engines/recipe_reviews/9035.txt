This recipe was very good!  However, like others have said, I found it to taste way too much like ketchup. I improvised by putting 1/2 cup of ketchup(instead of 1 cup), 1 1/2 teaspoons of soya sauce, 1 table spoon chilli powder, 1 table spoon garlic powder and a few shakes of hot sauce.  I gave this recipe a 3 because of the changes that needed to made. After all the changes, it tasted absolutely delicious. I've used this recipe to make wings, legs and thighs.  I will definitely using this recipe for making barbeque chicken in the future.

These are the BEST wings I have ever had in my life! My husband who used to work in a restaurant says they are the best he has ever tasted! I did change two things in the recipe however. Before coating the wings with the sauce I dropped them in boiling water for 10 minutes. I didn't have any onion powder so I substituted garlic powder. Also, I put aluminum foil on the pan before I put the wings in (makes clean up easier).

Wonderful! I made these for the Super Bowl and my friends loved them.  I doubled the recipe as I had 20 wings and made a few other changes.  These changes are for a doubled batch: added two tablespoons of garlic powder, added approx. 10 drops of hot sauce and added approx. 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke.  I also used only 1 1/2 cups of ketchup as other reviewers suggested.  Because some reviewers complained about burning I cooked them the first 30 minutes covered with foil and the last 15 minutes uncovered.  I also basted every 15 minutes.  This was a great recipe and I plan on making this many, many more times.

This is a good recipe as is, 4 stars for sure. But it tastes a little too much like ketchup for me. To make it 5 stars, try Naturelle's suggestions (posted 6/1/2005) - decrease ketchup, add soya sauce, chili powder and substitute onion powder with garlic powder. Those variations make it fantastic.

Really great-- follow others' suggestions to reduce ketchup and add the soy sauce and other spices--best we've had.  Husband loved it--smelled great while cooking and not too sticky.

This is easy to make and my family loves it.  I have used chicken breasts and cut them into 1 - 2 inch pieces in place of wings.  We rarely have leftovers!

We love this recipie. I made the sauce as printed, except I reduced the ketchup. Before coating the chicken, I boiled it for 15 minutes. Then we smoothered the chicken with the sauce. We then put it on the grill for a few minutes to make it a little crip. Thanks for the great recipie

I took others' advice and I halved the ketchup, I added about 4 Tbsp minced onion, 1 clove minced garlic, 2 Tbsp honey, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, and I used cider vinegar in place of the water. It is the best sauce I have ever tasted!

Thanks for this recipe.  It's a keeper!  I made it for "girls night" this past Tuesday and everyone loved it.  I sprayed the pan before putting everything in it and it was easy to clean afterward despite all the sauce.

This is a totally YUMMY dish that my family loves for me to make! If I'm in a complete hurry, I follow the directions here, but I always use drumsticks instead of wings cause they offer more meat. If I have a little extra time, I will use an oven safe pan and brown the chicken first, while making the sauce, then pour the sauce over the chicken and bake in the same pan so I'm not messing up every pan/dish in the kitchen! Make it - your family will be glad you did!

OH MY GOSH this was so incredible! I rate it 5stars because I made some of the recommended changes: I used 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/3 cup soy sauce, switch the onion powder for garlic powder, added some chili powder and some cayenne pepper for a bit of bite. I made it with drumsticks, cooked covered for 30 min and uncovered for another 30 and it was so tender and delicious! A huge hit in my house. I highly recommend it.

This recipie was delicious. My Mom loved the homemade sauce, and even asked me to make it again the next day on chicken breasts. I'm 16 and not the best chef in the world, but this recipie was so easy to follow. The meat was so tender it was falling off of the bone. We made the recipie for the sauce our official family recipie for any meat we bar-b-que in the future. :)

Hands down 5 stars because of how my chicken turned out. I only use recipes with 4 stars or more, so even if I alter a recipe, I give it the stars I feel my end-result version deserved. And I always check a handful of reviews prior to using a recipe. This turned out phenomenal. I had every intention of making this as listed, but I was missing one ingredient. And when I tasted the marinade before adding the ketchup/water mix, it was soooo good (hubby and son agreed), that I quit right there. Here's what I did: Feeding 6 family members, so I quadrupled the recipe yet still changed a couple things... for 6 large boneless skinless chicken breasts with rib meat, I melted 11 T butter in sauce pan. Added the onion powder (just under 1/4C - I know it sounds like a lot), added a half to three-quarters cup of brown sugar, added what was left of my worcestershire sauce (1 to 2 tsp), added a bunch of shakes of soy to make up for the worcestershire I was missing (maybe a quarter cup). Then added just under a half cup yellow mustard. heat and stir till smooth. Sweet and tangy and awesome. Tasted so good, that I was afraid to add the ketchup, so I didn't. Set a small amount aside for dipping. Marinated the breasts (could have added another one or 2 breasts) for a couple hours then grilled to perfection. All my boys, 2, 4, 14 and 15, and hubby scarfed it up. Served with baked potatoes and broccoli. What a keeper! I'll try to upload my photo too.

This was wonderful!  I also added a couple teaspoons of Redhot, and used cut up chicken pieces, baking at 400 for 1 hr, and 300 for another hour. Wow, so tender & delicious, even my non-chicken loving husband said it was great! Super sauce!

This is a great recipe for sweet chicken wings!  I combined some suggestions and used garlic powder, less ketchup (3/4 cup) and reduced the water a bit.  The result was a sweet, sticky coating that didn't have an overbearing ketchup taste.  I also lined my baking pan with foil.....make sure you do so othewise the wings will stick and make quite the mess!

delicious!  I followed the recipe and tripled it for 5lbs of wings.  Switched out the onion powder for garlic and added Cayenne Pepper, Ginger and a bunch of chipotle hot sauce. YUM.

This was beyond easy. I bought a huge bag of 24 wings and drummettes, thawed it, mixed up the sauce which was even easy to pour, dumped the bag into a 9 x 13 dish with the sauce on top and baked it for exactly 45 minutes. The top layer got slightly and pleasantly charred. Everyone raved about them. My only change was the addition of at least a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.

This was really good, and I only made a couple slight modifications. Instead of the 1 T. onion powder, I used ½ tsp. onion powder and ½ tsp. of garlic powder. I cut the ketchup down to 3/4 cup.  I had to lengthen my cooktime because I turned the temp down to 400. I also needed to cover with foil because the sugary glaze started to burn. It's a must in this household to cook chicken to 190°. Overall, the taste is good; sweet and flavorful. I don't like using soy sauce in my BBQ chicken because of the salt content and the taste, so if you're like me, then you'll consider this a tasty alternative. Although next time I think I'll try this on skinned boneless breasts because I'm not for cooking wings with the whole feather factor. 
We served this with garlic bread. Yum!

I used leg quarters instead of wings.  The only changes I'd make next time would be to lower the oven temp a little bit(my sauce charred a little, and I don't like charred sauce) and maybe add soem liquid smoke to the sauce to give it a more mesquite flavor.  Produced a very tender, juicy chicken though, and I will most likely makes this again!

This is so good with drumsticks. One hour instead of 45 min. Also 1/2 cup ketchup not 1 cup. I do not like grilling out because of carcinogens so this is a great alternative. Yum

perhaps a drop or two of liquid smoke will make this more of a bbq sauce and less of a meatloaf topping

My first time making chicken wings in the oven.  Made exactly as called for and they turned out really saucy and moist.  If I make them again, I may turn them a few times during baking and let the sauce caramelize a bit better on them.

I made this recipe for supper tonight using chicken thighs.  It was absolutely delicous.  I think it would be great with bonesless breasts.

I got this recipe in my email box yesterday...went to the store and got me a 12 pack of chicken wings...made the recipe today...it was AWESOME...the barbecue sauce was just the absolute best...even though the recipe calls for one cup of ketchup there is NO ketchup taste in the sauce..(I used Hunts extra thick ketchup).moreover, the sauce was sooo much better than the bottled ones you get at the store...I WILL be making this again...next time I'll use different chicken pieces...not just wings....this recipe is a keeper AND if you love barbecued wings/chicken/pork, you will LOVE this and so will the folks you serve this to.

My whole family LOVED this sauce! Gobbled it all up.. next time I will DOUBLE the recipe for sure.  I cooked the chicken on my indoor grill pan, turned out moist and juicy, with this delicious sauce!  Into the sauce I added some soy sauce and a couple shakes of Chipotle Tabasco sauce in as well, it was super.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This made a very good meal.  I cut chicken breasts into quarters and reduced the cooking time by about 15 minutes.  I also added onion and 1 clove minced garlic.  Delicious!

This is the best sauce I ever had, it's so yummy and juicy...... I used less ketchup and replaced onion powder with onion salt and baked for 30 mins only and the taste is still so unbelievable.... yum yum yummy. Tho I prefer drumsticks than wings.... My bf loves it so much, this is going to be our fav chicken !!!!! Thanks for sharing :)

This was great!!  I did use less ketchup (like other reviewer said), but left the other ingredients the  same.  I did have to cook it a little longer, but it was really thick and tasted great.  I did not feel that I had too much sauce as I continued to baste thoughout the cooking proces.  I also used mini drumbsticks they were great.  THanks for the great recipe!!

Great recipe...just made a few changes as suggested by others.  I used 4T of brown sugar instead of 5, 1/2 cup of ketchup and added garlic powder.  I baked the wings at 390 degrees for an hour and a half, turning them over a couple times...they came out so yummy!

Great Recipe! I gave it 4 stars because I made a few changes and a few additions.  Like most reviews, I cut the ketchup to 1/2 cup and that was more than enough.  I added about 2-3 drops of liquid smoke to give it a little grill taste although it's oven baked.  I also seasoned the chicken itself in addition to the sauce.  I just used my "go-to" seasonings - salt, pepper, garlic salt - and a little chicken seasoning.  Great Recipe!!!

Excellent to say the least!! My husband loved the chicken wings I prepared using this recipe. Before I put the wings in the sauce I used McCormick Grill Mates Sweet & Smoky rub on the chicken wings. I rubbed it in and let it sit for about 2 hours in a ziplock in the fridge. Then I used Jack Daniel's Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and I used spicy honey dijon mustard. I slow cooked my wings for 3 1/2 hours in the oven at 375C. After about 2 1/2 hours I lowered the temperature to 275C. This allowed the meat to really soak up the flavor of the sauce. This was a really excellent recipe and I will certainly be using it again in the future!!

Very very tasty. Like everyone else, I used less ketchup, substituted onion powder w/ garlic powder, and also added the chili powder, soy sauce, and hot sauce. I will highly likely make this sauce again when I have drumsticks, thighs, and wings.

Wow so good. I was afraid of wings in the oven being too gummy but they were PERFECT.  Following others recommendation, I used half the ketchup and water and the sauce was SO GOOD, not ketchup-y in the least. My husband wants me to de-skin the wings next time but I wasn't bothered by the skin.

First batch I made by the recipe and it was a OK, a little too ketchupy and not much bite. Next batch I substituted 1 tbl butter, 4 tbl brown sugar, 1/3c water, 2/3c ketchup and added a good deal of tabasco sauce and cayenne pepper. Turned out perfect.

I was looking for a chicken wing recipe that doesn't require deep frying and not spicy.  This recipe is IT!!  I had to use up some barbeque sauce so I used a half cup of barbeque sauce and a half cup of ketchup.  I also seasoned the wings with a little bit of salt and pepper for a few hours before adding the sauce.  I cooked mine at 375 degrees for about 40 minutes--did not burn. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. They looked just gorgeous out of the oven and the whole house smelled great. They were very tasty and for those of you who like to tweak the recipe no matter what, you can add more brown sugar if you want it sweeter, more pepper if you want it spicier, but I think it's great the way it is. A good alternative to Shake & Bake, which is what I've been using all these years! Husband said this is much tastier. I will try these on the grill once the weather gets warmer here. I will be making these again this weekend for a Superbowl party. Deliciously messy, finger licking, and have some extra napkins handy!  Trust me, you'll love it.

This was yummy!!  My only addition was a little Tabasco for spice, plus I used some jalapeno mustard instead of just plain.  I also scaled back a bit on the ketchup as others recommended.  SO good!  I didn't have any wings on hand so I just used some boneless, skinless breasts and marinated them for a few hours before cooking.  They were delicious and I'm definitely looking forward to using this on wings in the future.

I made the changes as suggested by other reviewers, added soy, chili powder, garlic powder and reduced ketchup.  This was a wonderful recipe.    I had friends for dinner and one said "These are so good and I am not a wing person."  That said it all.

I didn't have any onion powder so I chopped up half an onion instead.  The recipe was good, but a little sweet.  I think I will try cutting out some of the sugar next time or spicing it up to make it a bit hotter.  Also, I think I would cut back on all the ingredients since I cooked a few extra wings and there was still plenty of sauce left over.

I used chicken thighs and drumsticks and my family really liked it.  I decreased the ketchup to 3/4 cup and added 2 crushed cloves of garlic.  The chicken was very tasty and moist!  I will be adding this recipe to my line-up.  Thanks!

Easy and delicious! My fifteen year old son, who is my biggest critic, really liked them and  I loved them. I only simmered the sauce for five minutes and added to the wings when they were half way cooked. Sauce thickened nicely without burning. Yummy!

Very good.  A lot of work, and costly because I had to feed a family of 4 so I tripled the recipe and it coated about 50 wings.  I baked them on two cookie sheets for double the recommended time, then grilled them.  They were a messy, tasty hit!

Excellent sauce. Will definitely make it again, but a little more spicy next time....maybe add a little hot sauce. My husband complained that it was too "ketchupy", but I loved it.

The homemade sauce was great.  I made extra sauce just to have in the frig.  Next time I'll try is with breasts and thighs instead of wings.

I made this using legs and thighs instead of wings and cooked it an extra 10 minutes, basting a few times during cooking.  I didn't bother simmering the sauce 15 beforehand, just heated it till the butter melted and sugar dissolved.  It wasn't much like "real" barbecued chicken, but it was very tender, tasty and easy. My family liked it alot.

Easy and very delicious!  I followed previous reviewers' suggestions to reduce the ketchup and add soy and other spices.  I doubled the sauce, poured it over chicken legs and wings in a glass dish lined with baking paper, and baked it at 400 for 1 hour.  I will definitely do this again!

This is delicious. A tangy mustardy vinegary zippy sauce with a little sweet too. I used this to make a barbecued chicken pizza so I cooked everything on the stovetop and simmered the chicken in the sauce. I used boneless breasts that I cut into strips. Excellent recipe!

First time cooking chicken wings and decided to go with this recipe.  Turned out really good, though I did make a few minor adjustments to the recipe.  Instead of Worcestershire sauce I used A1 steak sauce, replaced onion powder with minced garlic, used honey mustard instead of regular mustard, and added about 2 tablespoons of Rooster sauce (chinese hot sauce). Turned out bold but not much of an overwhelming ketchup taste.  Definitely repeating this one again, thanks!

I didn't have ketchup so I substituted it with regular bbq sauce (only a half cup) and added a bit of garlic powder. Turned out delicious! Would definitely make this again.

I made the sauce as the recipe stated and it tasted too much like ketchup.  I added garlic powder, fresh cracked pepper, more worcestshire sauce, and liquid smoke.  After these changes, I thought it was very tasty.  I doubled the sauce so that I would have some to serve at the table.  I also used chicken breasts instead of wings.  I will be making this again.

As another poster said, follow Naturelle's additions/changes for this recipe from June 1, 2005!! It was delicious with the changes and smelled wonderful. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a sauce with a hint of the "smokey" flavour and do not have liquid smoke on hand (I didn't when I made this) just add some smokey bbq sauce. I added some (to taste) of the Bullseye Bold Original and a bit of black pepper to the sauce and it was perfect! I will defiantely be making wings with this sauce INSTEAD of going out from now on. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

I loved this after I followed some of the suggestions.  I added diced garlic, chopped onion instead of the powder (these were sauted in the butter).  I also cut down on the sugar and added a tsp of molasses.  I agree about never buying BBQ sause again. Thanks again!

I made this as a crockpot recipe. The flavor was great! Like other users, I added less katsup. I also added some cumin, cinnamon, garlic, and hot sauce. Next time (for the crockpot method) I'll leave out the water to make a thicker sauce.

As most other reviewers said, I had to do extensive tweaking to get the taste I wanted.  W-a-y too much ketchup.  I reduced ketchup and what I used was organic, low sugar, low salt with fewere preservatives.  I too switched granulated garlic for the onion powder, which I find rather tasteless.  I subbed Becel marg for butter and added Hungarian smoked paprika for that smoky flavour that grills inpart.  When some many changes are made to a recipe I can't credit it with too many stars.  This recipe is a jumping off point for concocting one's own version.

THESE WERE GREAT! I followed the tips by other reviewers - I doubled the recipe (but cut the ketchup in half) so I used 3T minced onion, about 2T garlic powder, a few dashes of hot sauce and 2T of chipotle chili powder.

these were so very tasty, We followed the suggestions of earlier posters, 1/2 ketchup, + garlic powder , soy sauce and hot sauce. We also put them under the broiler at the end for a few minutes on each side which really helped crisp them up! We are going to make these often , I can tell!

In other reviews, they stated it had too much ketchup...but I thought it had the perfect amount of ketchup.  I tend to like sweeter bbq sauce though.  I think next time I will try this recipe with a 1/2 c. of honey added.

We are big fans of BBQ and we didn't really enjoy this recipe.  It just tasted like doctored ketchup to us.  I even reduced the ketchup, added a smidgen of liquid smoke, and a T of garlic powder.  We won't be making this one again.

These were pretty good but a little too greasy for me.  If I try them again I will cut back on the butter.  But I must say that the smell that permeated the house was wonderful.

This was great the night I cooked it and great the next day for lunch. Plus, I had everything on hand to make it. I did use 4 thighs instead of wings, regular amount of everything else. A little extra sauce but that's OK. Will make this again.

I went shopping for chicken wings and decided I didn't want the ones in the meat dept. Too much skin and didn't want to mess with cleaning them. I found Tyson Chicken Wing Sections in the frozen food aisle. They had a little skin on them. I cut off the excess and left the rest on. Then I decided to do what a couple of other people did by adding soy sauce (about 2T), 2/3 cup ketchup, minced garlic and chili powder (about 1T) along with the rest of the ingredients listed. I decided to cover them the first 25 minutes of cooking (lined the pan with foil first), then uncovered and turned them over and baked another 25 minutes turning one more time half way through. They fell off the bone and tasted wonderful. This was a huge hit. The only question I got was 'Is it easy to make these?'

These wings turned out sweet and saucy and they had my cat trying to get them off the plate, LOL!! I did make a few changes, I added 1 1/2 tsp soya sauce, 1 tbsp chili powder, and 1 tbsp garlic powder instead of the onion powder called for. I still used the 1 cup of ketchup called for and we didn't find it overpowering in ketchup taste.  This sauce would probably be good on other meats also and I can't wait to find out. Thanks for posting this great recipe.  Made spare ribs tonight with this fantastic sauce and they turned out great!!!!!! I doubled the sauce ingredients to cover all the ribs after I had steamed them for a bit first to speed up cooking time. This is our all time favorite sauce recipe.

This was excellent with the suggested changes.  I made it last night with many of the suggested changes.  I made 20 wings (there was plenty of sauce).  I pulled the skin off half of them, just to see how they would be.  They weren't dry without the skin so I will probably remove it from all of them next time.  I lined a 13x9 glass pan with heavy duty foil and sprayed with cooking spray, just in case.  I boiled wings for 10 minutes first, as suggested by another reviewer.  I used a 1/4 cup of onion in  place of onion powder, reduced ketchup to 1/2c, added a clove of chopped garlic, 2T of lite soy sauce, 2T honey, 8 drops of Tabasco (which didn't make them hot at all).  I baked them covered for 30 minutes, removed the foil and cooked them about another 25 minutes, turning them (to baste) every 5 to 7 minutes. Excellent. Thank you for all of your suggestions.

This recipe is SOOOOO good.  The sauce is to die for.  I made a few modifications based on personal taste and previous reviews: added 2T soy sauce, subbed 4T minced onion for the onion powder, added 1 clove minced garlic, added 2t. chili powder, and halved the amount of ketchup.  I used 2 extra large boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into strips.  I think the cook time was too long for boneless chicken, so if you're going to do it that way cut back the cook time by 10 minutes or so.  Great recipe!  Thank you for sharing!

The sauce is five stars, but there are definitely some adjustments that need to be made.  When wings come out of the package from the store, each wing consists of three parts: a "drumstick" a "wing" and an inedible "tip". First, cut the wings into their component pieces and discard the tips so you are left with 20 "hot wings". There was WAYYYY too much grease from the skin in the pan after cooking, so definitely take the skin off.  I made the mistake of leaving the wings as is from the package and I couldn't access the meat without ripping apart the wings with my hands getting grease everywhere.  Yuck.  Then I couldn't even mop up the sauce because there was an inch of chicken grease in the pan mixed with it. Make these adjustments, or just use breasts.

I agree with other people reviews about how good they are, also added garlic, also put foil paper on the bottom. Great flavor, so simple to put together.  I used breast fillets and they were moist and delicious. This is a favorite!

These are the hit of my dinner. Once I did not have ketchup, so I used tomato sauce, and I have substituted garlic powder for onion powder...still tastes amazing! Easy, quick and no mess. I will never fix wings again that have to be fried first.

I was out of my buffalo wing mix last night, but had planned on having them for dinner.  I found this recipe and it was great!  The ONLY change I would make is to add a little something (hot sauce maybe) to make it a little spicier.  The flavor was outstanding!  Definately a keeper!

My husband and I love this recipe.  We grilled the frozen wings on the grill for about 8-10 min. on each side.  Then we only baked them about 30 minutes.  They are fantastic.  So quick and easy.

This is delicious! The only changes I made were using 4 chicken breasts rather than wings, and using garlic poowder instead of onion powder, because that is what I had on hand. I was thoroughly impressed and will definitely keep this one around for future use! Thanks!

This is the best bbq ever!!!  Very easy to multiply for a party.  Good on the grill (lay foil to prevent sauce from dripping off).  Pass the paper towels, corn on the cob and you've got a great meal!  Thanks a bunch for this one.  (Also used the sauce leftover on spareribs cooked the same way, delicous!)

This was surprisingly tasty. The sauce was super zingy. I only used 3 tbs of sugar and 3/4 C ketchup. I also used spicy brown mustard. I prefer breasts so I baked them (sliced thin) at 350 for 45 min. Everyone really liked this!!

Well this recipe was amazing! I made it for a bunch of my friends and tripled up the recipe. However I did make a few changes I cut down on the catch up a little bit and added a little bit more brown sugar. I also added a couple splashes of apple cider vinegar. I give this recipe of 4 out of 5.

Tried the recipe as is with exception of reduction 1/2 cup ketchup and 4 tblsp brown sugar to suggested 4-6 serving.  Worked out perfectly for a baked bar-b-que wing sauce.  Will continue to use for both oven and grill- loved it!

So I liked this recipe a lot and my husband liked it a lot. but i think there was maybe too much brown sugar or worchestshire sauce, it tasted a little...sour and sweet? I made some changes based on other reviews: 1/2 C ketchup, 1 1/2 tsp soy sauce, 1 T chili powder, 1T garlic powder, 1T onion powder, 3T butter, 5T brown sugar, 2T worchestshire sauce, 1/2 C water, 2T mustard. i doubled the recipe and used 4 chicken breasts. had plentyyyy of sauce. i probably could use 5-6 chicken breasts next time.

Used half the ketchup and added another tablespoon of brown sugar and onion powder. The last ten minutes I broiled the wings to give them that charred flavor, then i added kraft bbq sauce...they were great!

These were just okay. We didn't feel there was anything really special about them but hubby ate his usual heaping share and cleaned up the leftovers the next day.  The recipe is easy enough to prepare just make sure you use foil or spray generously as the clean up will be a nightmare otherwise.

Delicious with the reviewer revisions. I've made this several times and it's a hit each time! I cooked it covered for the 1st 30 minutes, then basted it and cooked it uncovered for the remaining 15. Sticky and delectable.

Tasty and versatile sauce.  Easy to make modifications here and there.  My last go round I halfed the onion powder and topped up the remainder for it with garlic powder.  Also added on some balsamic and black pepper.

My wife was sad when all the wings were gone.

Delicious! My husband was spooning the leftover sauce out of the pan and eating it by itself. I used chili sauce instead of ketchup, garlic powder instead of onion powder, and honey barbecue sauce instead of mustard. Also added 1 1/2 tsp soy sauce and a bit of chili powder. This is our go-to sweet barbecue sauce now!

I just don't like home made wings I guess... They were a good brand of chicken, but so fatty! It wasn't I hoped for. I gave it 3 starts because I'm not sure if it was the chicken or the preparation... either way... I won't be trying this again.

Better than most restaurants.  I make without hot sauce as a family preference.  However, when I make these to take to a party I always make two batches, one mild and one hot.  I do follow other reviewer's suggestions and boil the wings while the sauce simmers.

My boyfriend said this was one of the best barbecue sauces he's ever tasted, and he's had more than a couple. We cut down the ketchup to approximately half a cup, added a tad extra butter, added garlic powder to the cooked sauce as well as a light dusting on the chicken itself when we turned it halfway through. Not a gourmet sauce by any means, but an excellent alternative to highly processed bottled sauces for a quick weeknight chicken dinner. Would be excellent on any cut of chicken (tenderloins, breast, etc.) or even ribs or brisket. We're going to try adding a touch of honey next time. A good quick and easy sauce!

Sauce was great but would have liked the chicken a little crunchier.  Maybe I'll try on the grill next time.

I had to substitute boneless chicken for wings, but I cut them into wing-sized pieces, and followed the recipe from there, except that I did use garlic powder instead of onion powder.  The verdict "Perfect." from my family, so thanks for this recipe, which we surely see more use in our house.

this was really really good given the following changes: the mustard I used was hot & spicy, I added a 1/2 teaspoon of dry chili flakes, and i used 8 drumsticks instead.  Baked at 450 for 45 minutes in a 7x7 pan with all the sauce. Turn over and bake for another 15 minutes. Done!

I cut the ketchup in half and added siracha sauce and cayenne pepper for a kick.  Came out good and everyone ate them up.  I will make it again with extra siracha sauce next time.  I think that I had actually used a cup of ketchup, it wouldn't have came out very tasty, hence the 4 stars.

these turned out pretty good. i made it a few times, first time i made it as directed and like others said, it came out tasting a bit too much like catchup, so the second time i made it i halved the amount of catchup and doubled the amount of Worcestershire sauce because i like mine not overly sweet. also i made sure to take them out every few minutes and spoon the sauce back over the chicken so it was heavily coated. overall this was really good and ill keep this for a quick and easy week night dinner.

This was fabulous!  I changed it a little to adjust to my family's taste.  I used 1/2 the ketchup as recommended by other cooks and added hot sauce and garlic to the sauce. Also, I sprinkled seasoned salt on the wings.  I prepared them the night before and let them marinade overnight. I used the oven method but cooked them for a full hour.  They were great as leftovers too, so make extra!  Definitely use foil in your pan...

This is an easy, great tasting recipe that is almost foolproof; I doubled it in a counter top skillet to take to a potluck, and everyone loved it!  The chicken was so tender, yet held together well for serving.  Very very tasty.

This was very tasty! Some changes I made were adding dehydrated onions instead of the onion powder. I added fresh crushed garlic, soy sauce, spicy mustard (along with the regular), and halved the ketchup. I also peppered and kosher salted the wings before adding the sauce to them. I only made it with 6 wings, there's only two of us. We had some sauce leftover, so I am saving it for later!

Easy to put together and my family liked it. The servings are for appetizer portions, not dinner portions. I made at least twice as many wings, but didn't need to increase the amount of sauce. Make sure to line your pan with foil or you will be scraping the cooked on sauce off for days. Thanks!

My kids gobbled this up and ask for it at least once a week!  I halved the ketchup, but used onion SALT and garlic powder and added no other salt to the recipe. I used dehydrated onion as well. This is very, very yummy and something I put in the kid's thermos' the next day for lunch.

This was amazing, i add fresh seasoning into slits i create in my chicken meat (onion, garlic, basil, pepper, salt, sweet pepper) so i didn't have to add in the onion powder, i threw some potatoes and carrots in the baking dish, covered it and let it bake. My family loved it the chicken disappeared so fast! I've made it twice for the week. 5 stars for this recipe!

This BBQ sauce is excellent!  I used it almost exactly just adding a little more brown sugar to make it sweeter and a little hotsauce for a kick.  I used chicken breasts and cooked it in the crockpot for a few house.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was amazing.

This was delicious!  I made this dish with chicken thighs and the meat fell off of the bone and was very tasty.  

Thanks.  I plan to use this recipe again at a BBQ Baby Shower next month.

This recipe is great! I made this the other day and it was soo delicious we were licking our fingers clean! I tweaked a bit, the recipe called for mustard, but i didnt have any so i used balsamic vinegar to add a bit of tartiness instead. . .:D But this recipe is fantastic! Will definately make this again. :D

I made this just as directed except for using only 4 tablespoons of brown sugar.  My husband and 2 small children loved it!  Next time, I will add a little fresh garlic and possibly some liquid smoke.  It's definitely a keeper for me! Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe.

I don't see how 10 wings makes 5 servings. I had 50 wings to make so I had to play around with the amount of ingredients, it turned out very good.

I've taken much from this site and finally decided to give something back haha.  I made some changes to this recipe because I was in a hurry and it turned out fabulous: I whisked all the base ingredients together (added 1/2t cayenne, 1t lemon juice, 1T soy sauce) in a glass bowl and microwaved it for about 3 mins.  While that was going I rubbed the chicken wings with tenderizer, salt/pepper.  Before pouring sauce, I rolled each wing in the sauce and placed them in the baking dish.  Baked covered 25mins, uncovered 20mins then spooned the sauce (brown sugar will be a litte thick but very sticky and sweet not gritty) over each wing before serving.  Hubby and I were both sucking our fingers and nearly licking the plate...Thanks for this recipe! Next time I'll do drumettes for sure - Kroger only had full wings :-(

Really good...I took the advice of another poster and added a few drops of liquid smoke, as well as my favorite hot sauce and some garlic powder, about a tbsp. I also covered it for half the time and then uncovered it for the rest. If you like having the sauce like i do, cover it for half the time or it will all dry up. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have found a new favorite recipe from this site!! And ya'll know how I am always here cookin' and reviewin' all the time! This BBQ chicken was amazingly delicious. My only addition was a shot of hot sauce and Jim Beam. I just like the taste of a little bourbon in my sauce! I cooked up two chicken breast and a mess of wings in this sauce, and my family and I were licking our plates clean. Thank you, Abbie, for this new favorite!

I love this recipe! It is so easy, and the sauce is amazing! My favorite barbecue sauce to date. The first time I made it I added hot sauce to the sauce and my husband loved it. I thought it was too spicy. The second time, I left out the hot sauce and it was just about he best thing I have ever tasted. I made fresh oven fries to go with the chicken since they could cook in the oven together.

I liked this because I prefer my BBQ sauce "sweet" rather than "smokey". But I always like to adjust to my taste! I did add hot sauce to give some kick. And used a little less catsup and a bit more water. I also increased the worcestershire. Thanks Abbie!

Loved this recipe.  My grocer was out of chicken wings so I used legs instead which worked well.  Also I didn't wish to heat the kitchen up with my stove I did them on the bbq.  
This one's a keeper!!

Both I and my husband enjoyed this.  I would have given it 5 stars except I followed the advice of other reviewers to end up with my final product.  I added hot sauce, soy and chili powder, as well as halved the ketchup.   I will be trying this BBQ sauce on pork next.  This sauce recipe is a keeper.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  It tasted wierd.  It may have been the margarine I used in it.  I would suggest using butter or oil as a base instead.  I've had better BBQ sauces for chicken, so I'll stick to them.

Excellent sauce!!  I did the modifying mentioned by others plus some of my own -  less ketchup, garlic not onion powder, added minced onions and honey, and replaced water with chicken broth.  Since I did not have chicken, I made this with pork loins cut into 1 inch strips.  Outstanding!!

This was .....good and different. I used less ketchup per previous reviews. I added a couple of shakes of cayenne and some tabasco wing sauce. Instead of wings I used strips of chicken breasts that I had pounded. Turned out pretty well. Thanks.

This recipe turned out wonderful. I did however increase the butterto 1/2 stick or 1/2 cup and sauteed 1/4 small onion finely sliced and 2 cloves of minced garlic, I then followed the rest of the recipe as written. Smells awesome while cooking.

This recipe was great! However there was lots of sauce leftover (wasteful). I removed the chicken and continued to turn in the dish every 5 minutes to soak. The chicken was tender and intensly flavourful. Next time I'll need more chicken or less people!

This was really good!  I used chicken legs instead of wings since that's all I had in the fridge.  I will be making this one again but I might try boneless skinless chicken breasts next time.

We tried these wings over the weekend and they were just okay.  We found them a bit 'ketchup-y' tasting - my DH agreed.  I used 1.5 lbs of wings with the same amount of sauce ingredients below, and it turned out just fine (ie. there was enough sauce).  The only thing I changed was I cooked the wings for 1 hour at 425 (not 45 minutes as the recipe indicates).  I don't think I would make these again, they're okay, but not spectacular.

This is a great recipe. I made it exactly like it said but I added garlic powder and more brown sugar because I was afraid of all the ketchup. It was fantastic. We will definitely make them again.

I took the other reviewers advice and used garlic powder instead of the onion. Also, I only had soy sauce to use in place of the worcestershire sauce and it was great. I only let it simmer for about 8 minutes because I was getting impatient. I boiled my chicken for about 15 minutes before hand as well. All together it was really great.

I didnt care for these all that much. The BBQ Sauce was too sweet for my taste. My husband didnt eat very many and that says a lot at my house. The sauce had a strange consistancy and I followed the instructions to the T. Just not for us but thanks anyway.

My whole family really liked these wings, although my husband found them a bit on the "too sweet" side, but ate them up none the less.  Make sure you spray the pan with non-stick spray though, it makes for one nasty baked-on crust.

I allowed the chicken to marinate overnight in a bunch of seasonings like onion powder, paprika, adobo, old bay, etc.  I decreased the amount of sugar and added honey mustard instead of mustard.  It was a hit!

I followed most posters recommendation and used less ketchup.  I didn’t have onion powder so I used garlic instead. I used Heinz yellow mustard (all I had) and paprika. I cooked with Aluminum foil and removed it the last 20 mins. The taste and color is superb. Hubby enjoyed it.

I liked the sauce. Not too ketchup-y for me. It was a cross between barbecue sauce and cacciatore sauce. I had lightly seasoned my wings with salt and garlic powder and slow baked them for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees F. Then I heavily basted the chicken wings with the sauce and baked for another 30-40 minutes at 350 degrees F. Then basted again and broiled on high for about 5-7 minutes

Delicious! Read other reviews and looks like people didn't like the ketchup flavour, so I used BBQ sauce with half the amount of ketchup. They were soooooo tender and easy to make. Definitely a favourite!

WOW & YUMMY! So happy I tried these! I followed the basics of this recipe with minor changes to our preferences: per other reviewers I subbed garlic powder for onion powder, only 1/2c ketchup, 6Tbls brown sugar, added a small dash of onion powder, then added a big squeeze of honey (we love honey BBQ wings), a couple dash's soy sauce and finally a added 2Tbls white sugar. Boiled sauce 15mins or so, mixed wings & sauce in a big bowl and then placed them on a lined cookie sheet, baked at 420 degrees 20mins then added the last of the sauce/glaze and finished cooking them for another 25mins. My picky family loved these. My only regret is that I didn't make more:)  Thank you Becki. Now I don't have to worry about going out for wings, I can make my own!

Made this with butterflied breasts. They were amazing. Only change for breasts is less cooking time so they don't dry out.

The BBQ Sauce is amazing. Everyone will love these wings and they are easy to make. I substitute a real chopped onion for the onion powder and add 1 clove of fresh chopped garlic. I brown the onion and garlic together with the butter in saucepan as the first step.

This is my favorite BBQ chicken in the world!! I dont add mustard though.I throw in some chili powder and maybe a little more garlic and brown sugar,not so much ketchup.I've only  made it on boneless chicken breasts,can't wait to make wings. Everyone who tries it loves it,even my picky husband!I have made it quite a few times, gets better every time. Spoon the extra sauce over some rice with green beans...BAM! This is tomorrow's dinner!

Okay, I upped the brown sugar to equal parts with the ketchup. And for a bit more kick,  I added a 1/4 cup white pepper and a teaspoon of chili pepper and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I used quarter cuts of chicken. It was great! The pepper helped to balance the sweet. Moist and delicious, my husband loved it and so did I!

I used this in a crockpot over chicken thighs and cubed red potatoes. Easy, delicious, and I didn't have to take a trip to the store to buy an odd random ingredient. Added a little garlic, teriyaki, and subbed half the sugar with honey. Will make again!

I tried this recipe last night. I did what the recipe said and I also followed some of the other viewers and their suggestions. My family loved it, I felt like the sauce could have been a little bit thicker. Overall nice flavor, maybe not so barbecue. I will probably make it again and add more brown sugar it really wasn't ketchuppy to me cause I probably cut it enought with the water. But I think it's a keeper.

I made this with chicken legs and did follow the advice of others:  less ketchup, add soy sauce and garlic powder.  I did use apple cider vinegar but will try it without it instead next time.  I did also add dry mustard to the mix as well.  I baked for 45 minutes at 400 degrees and did baste it once or twice.  It was definitely a good meal.

I made this last night, with a mix of drumsticks and boneless thighs. Delicious! Used 3T fresh minced onion plus 1t dried, coconut oil instead of butter, and 1/2c catsup instead of 1c, and no added water. I loved it. The sauce gets a nice rich taste from caramelizing in the baking pan. Rolled the chicken pieces in seasoned flour and browned in coconut oil in skillet before putting in baking pan. Really, that was just for looks. But it did reduce needed oven cooking time. Yummy cold the next day! Will make again.

Great recipe!  Great for summer!  I use this sauce for a pulled pork or beef in a slow cooker for 6-8 hours. I add about a half cup of water to help it from drying out.

I tried this with chicken legs and thighs. As some reviewers suggested, I cut back the ketchup to 1/2 C. and added 2 Tbls, of soy sauce. I covered the dish with aluminum foil and baked for about 30 minutes at 400, then took off the foil for the last 15 minutes. Turned out great, but next time I think I'll take the skin off because the skin just wasn't appetizing and turned out kind of soggy.

I made a double batch. I cut back on the butter and sugar. I also used soy sauce instead of Worcestershire. I only had 1/3 cup of ketchup so I made up the rest with pasta sauce. I also went half & half with onion & garlic powder.

I cut down on the ketchup, added some hot sauce and follow the recipe on all other ingredients to the T. Loved It!!!! The flavor from the sauce went right through to the bone and the chicken was ohhhh so tender. This is ONE to add to the collection.

I use diced chicken breast and otherwise follow the recipe to the T.  I love how the sauce bakes into the meat, it is nice to shred the meat up a bit so every part is saturated, so good my daughter and fiance lick their plates clean.  Plus easy to make!!

Great barbecue sauce! I added a little cayenne pepper and garlic powder. And used it on chicken thighs. When cooking it I turned the thighs a few times and basted it until the meat fell off the bones. Fantastic! I am never going to buy BBQ sauce again!

4 1/2 pts. actually. I lessened the ketchup to 3/4 c. and added 1/2 tbls garlic pwd and 1/2 tbls onion pwd. Those were the only changes. I used chicken breasts, boiled then shredded it; added the sauce and made sandwiches. Good

This is the BEST BBQ recipe I have ever tasted!  I would not change a thing!  I do not like anything the least little bit hot and this was PERFECT!  Thanks for the recipe!  This sauce would be great on anything you wanted to BBQ!   (From a Memphis (home of the BBQ) BBQ lover!)

even though i only used half the ketchup based on everyone else's reviews, it still tasted too ketchup like for me.  i like more of a thick, tangy, mesquite barbecue like flavor, and this was just too... light for me i guess.  but i tasted it halfway through and caught it so i added some soy sauce as well as some honey flavored bbq sauce i had in the fridge (which i didn't like for the same reason - not tangy, mesquite enough) and it helped tremendously for me.  i guess it all depends on what kind of sauce you like though...

This is definately a 5 star for me. I did make a few changes but nothing major. I didn't have any onion powder so I added minced onions, I also added 2 small cloves. As per other reviews I started with 1/2 a cup of ketchup and that was enough for me, it doesn't over power the taste. Oh I also added a tbsp of soya sauce. YUMMY I haven't even tried it with anything yet but I'm sure this will be a hit. Will be making the chicken wings tonight for supper.

I made this recipe with the changes suggested by Naturelle (June 1,2005) and it will now join our regular culinary rotation.  Usually we can BBQ year-round but record amounts of snow this year are keeping us indoors.  This recipe gives us that BBQ flavor we love.  My husband is the one who eats chicken, but I actually liked the chicken in this recipe.  We used cut up chicken breasts and made pan fries.  But there was so much nice sauce that I can't wait to make mashed potatoes or rice to go with it.  Happy cooking!

Excellent recipe!! I did change it a bit to our liking.  I used real crushed garlic instead of onion powder, added a bit of fresh ground pepper and added 3 or 4 tbsp of Franks buffalo wing hot sauce.  After the sauce was done simmering I poured half into a bowl with the wings to coat them. I then baked them for almost an hour, took them out broiled them on another pan until they were crispy and dipped them in the extra sauce right before plating.  They were soooo good! My hubby loved them.  The taste is amazing...I will definetly be making these again! Thanks for the recipe! :)

Delicious! My daughter requested bbq chicken, and I happily tried this out for her.  I used chopped up an onion and garlic instead of powders, sauteed and followed other recommendations.  Used a little soya and wocester sauce and half the ketchup.  My youngest liked it enough to dirty an extra plate! ( I make them wash their own dishes lol)  Next time i will make extra sauce.

Tasty, easy, and would make again.  I used 12 chicken thighs.  I doubled the recipe, and adapted the recipe pursuant to the recommendations of other reviewers:  
1)  Halved the ketchup.
2)  Substituted garlic powder for onion powder.
I also used half dijon mustard/half normal.  

Very yummy!

This was really yummy!! I usually just throw all the ingredients together and then bake but this time I followed directions by simmering the sauce for about 15 minutes!! LOVED it! I did follow others advice about adding garlic powder instead of the onion, halved the ketchup, and added just under a tsp of chili powder. I am waiting to see what the hubby says about it as leftovers....but so far we have a new favorite!! Thanks....****UPDATE****Fiance told me that he LOVED these. We ran out of ketchup ((which he eats with everything)) so he worried that he wouldn't be able to eat the leftovers. But he said that they had such good flavor that he didn't even miss the ketchup ((I think it was because it was in the sauce!!)) Thanks again!!

This was a nice change for a quick chicken dish.  I gave it four stars since I also did the changes others noted which was 1/2 cup ketchup, soysauce and garlic instead of onion. It tasted quite sweet and the mustard gave it the tangy flavour. Would try again

These were great! Like many people I added liquid smoke and some soy sauce. Also I got chicken wings because they were a lot cheaper and didn't bother to separate them though I would if I was making these for something other than a private pig fest.
I loved them.

Good flavor, super easy to make. I did not change anything about the recipe. I would have liked them to have more spice and much more kick, but my husband was content to dip them in hot sauce.

This was good. I grilled the wings and they were very satisfying sticky. I cut the ketchup to half a cup and it was still a bit overwhelming. I used only 1 T. oil - no more was needed.

This was awesome, but I had cooked the chicken for about an hour and a half at 375. I used less ketchup than called for, and next time I think I would use less brown sugar, because it was a little too sweet. Other than that - wonderful. Just the right amount of spice.

The grandkids really like wings and they loved these. I fix them when they come to visit because they can be fixed ahead and we get more time to play!

I made this recipe not too long ago and absolutely LOVED it!  Followed the suggestions below and used garlic powder instead of onion powder!  Great sauce!

I loved this chicken. I tried chicken wings like this when I was on vacation and was looking for this recipe for a long time. Thank you. It is perfect, everyone loved it in my family. This is going to be a party plate for us at many events.

We felt this recipe was just OK.  I doubled the recipe for the size party i had and was left with a lot of marinade that was practically watered down.  The flavor was ok, it had a very sweet taste.  Some liked it, some Didn't.

this tastes like something out of a restuarant it was so good I couldn't stop eating them (made with chicken drummettes and used minced garlic as I'm not a fan of onion) they were so good my son who is 5 and picky said they were sweet and my daughter ate more than 3 and she is picky with meat in general and i will be reupdating when I make for hubby and he gets a taste, he's my biggest critic but he is in Iraq right now, but I swear if I had a restaurant or knew someone with one i would sell them this recipe, it's  a winner

This was pretty good but a little on the bland side.  It could be spiced up a bit as others have mentioned.  My picky 9 year old liked it so for that reason I would probably make it again.  Next time I will not use wings but chicken that has a little more meat on it.

Wow, wow, wow! The barbecue sauce almost tasted store bought and the best part about it was that it tasted BETTER than store bought. I kept licking my fingers. My parents ate some and both of them were raving about it. They want me to cook some more next week. Great recipe. Thanks!

The only thing(s) I changed were: cut the water to two tbsp and I didn't bother heating it up prior to putting it with chicken. My family's FAVOURITE chicken dish by far. Thanks for sharing!

We don't have a BBQ so we are always hesitant to try BBQ dishes. This one hit the mark. We will make this one again. It would be a great summer dish for the friends.

I really love this recipe. It is so delicious and so easy to make. I only used 1/2 cup ketchup and 3 Tsps brown sugar, but add 2 Tsp garlic powder (sometimes also a little ground cayenne pepper)to the sauce. It is still enough for baking 20 wings. I only baked for 35 min. It is a great recipe.

I made this a couple of times w/ just a little ingredient variations.  It was still a hit! The first time I did it in the oven as called for, but the second time I just couldn't resist throwin' those marinated suckers right on the grill!!  OMG, it was fabulous!  Thanks for the recipe =)

Yummy and very easy.  It's good as it is and it's also an easy sauce to alter should you fancy different flavors each time you make it.  I also added some chili sauce and some chili powder (it wasn't spicy, just a good flavor).  I only had onion flakes and no powder.  Also, I took the advice of other reviewers and added some soy sauce.  I used chicken thigh meat (no bone) and cooked for about 40 minutes uncovered.  It was tender and delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was yummy and very easy!  Other than using drumsticks instead of wings, I made the reipe as is.  The sauce was a little sweet for my husband, but he tends to like things pretty spicy.  I liked it just the way it was.

Rice and  this sauce together was really good!!   It's a keeper!

This was very very good and EASY!! I did add a few things. 2-TBSP honey, 1-TBSP soy sauce and 3-TBSP dehydrated onion. This sauce was truly "finger lickin good". I also used chicken breasts that were skinned and boneless. I checked the chicken after 25 minutes and it was done. I think because it was boneless, it cooked faster. This going to be a keeper and I know it will be a hit with
my friends and family...

AWESOME SAUCE!  Sweet and sticky!  Messy cleanup but well worth it.  I will use this on various types of chicken pieces.  Thanks for the recipe

This recipe was fantastic! I'm a new cook who's never even tried a barbeque sauce from scratch. I did add a little nutmeg, I used spicy mustard, and then topped my chicken pieces (breasts and drums) with a little rosemary while they baked. I was so impressed! Thank you for this recipe!

As written it is ok. It will burn and it has to much ketchup in it for me. I like more of a vinegar bbq sauce. I guess never being out of North carolina will do that to you. Thanks for the recipe it was good for a no vinegar sauce.

I just tried this recipe tonight.  Only one thing went wrong.....I didn't make enough chicken!!!!!  My family loved it.  I did add soy sauce to the ingredients, as it made it less sweet.  I cooked cut up chicken breasts but can't wait to cook the wings.  This went right to my recipe box!

This was the best chicken I've ever had.  My family thought so too, and I have a very picky hubby.  We will be using this recipe from now on.  It was so easy to make.  This is a definate keeper. So much better than a jar. :)

Really, really good!  After reading some of the other reviews, I did substitute the onion powder for garlic powder and reduced the amount of ketchup.  Other than that, everything else remained the same.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I have made this recipe many many times and loved it every single one! I can't resist sticking my fingers into the sauce and tasting a bit before it goes on the chicken. This is definately a keeper!
