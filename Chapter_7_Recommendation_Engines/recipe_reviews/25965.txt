Because I've had a quart of buttermilk to make use of and have been making lots of "Buttermilk This and Thats," I've learned very quickly what an incredible, stark difference in moisture real, fresh buttermilk makes in batters!  SO much better than using soured milk, or powdered buttermilk, and so much better than not being included at all (I offer the "Black Magic Cake" from this site as proof!) The crumb is soft, tender and moist, just as it is in this cake as well.  This cake is not overly sweet, so I hope no reviewers will dock it for that - it is a coffeecake, after all, not a dessert cake, although for my tastes it's perfectly suited for dessert too!  For those of you familiar with "Blueberry Buckle," either the butter or shortening version, this coffeecake is similar...but better because the cake is significantly more moist, fluffy and has a more delicate texture. The ingredients and preparation method are perfect as written, tho' those wanting more "spunk" could certainly add some cinnamon to the crumb topping, or swap out the blueberries for other berries, or even use a cinnamon swirl or fruit filling (peach sounds awesome to me)!  The crumb topping is what it should be,  somewhat crackly and buttery, not cloyingly sweet or greasy. This batter is so basic, and so good that I'll be including  this recipe in my reference file. Once again I'm convinced that any batter-type recipe with buttermilk in its list of ingredients is worth giving a second glance to.

I haven't tried this recipe but in reading the reviews someone said the blueberries all sank to the bottom. To prevent this add the blueberries to the dry mixture and make sure they are well coated with the dry ingredients before adding the wet. This also works for raisins & nuts.

It's about time I rated this recipe because I have used it so much with great success.   It's great just the way it is, but is also really easy to amend to your needs.

I usually halve this recipe and bake it in an 8x8 inch glass pan with great success.  The halved recipe also did well in a 9 inch springform pan IIRC.

I halved the amount of baking powder in the original recipe in order to get rid of that metallic taste that comes with using too much.  You could also try making baking powder using baking soda and cream of tartar which would also not leave a metallic taste.

I have started adding a very small amount of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I use 1/8 tsp when I make the full recipe. Just a tiny bit really adds something.

I too added brown sugar instead of white to the topping, which made it look much better.  

I also like to use oil instead of butter which creates a cake that keeps very well, moist, and you don't have to spend time creaming it.  for a lower fat cake I have tried substituting water for half the oil, but this made a slightly tougher cake. I might try applesauce sometime instead. I add the oil to the wet ingredients.

whole wheat pastry flour mixed in with the white flour also worked quite well.

I thought the cake was very good.  I took the suggestions from the other reviewers and went with the lemon flavoring instead of vanilla; used brown sugar for the topping and added 1 tsp each cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping.  Makes a very large cake, and takes about an hour to bake.  I will make this again, only if I have to feed a crowd.  Thanks Tricia!

I made a half recipe in an 8x8 pan, baked for 55 minutes and had no problems with sinking blueberries.  I took this to a birthday party and left with just my pan!  It's very light and not too sweet.  Side note: I mixed it all with a whisk, that may have helped.

I catered a PTA Board breakfast meeting last week and made this coffeecake, plus other coffeecakes, muffins, casseroles, etc.  The Blueberry Buttermilk Coffeecake was a HUGE hit!  There were no leftovers and 2 board members used their fingers to get the last crumbs from the pan.  I only made 1 change to the recipe:  I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the topping.  I can't wait to try this coffeecake again with other fruit!

This is a great coffeecake, very moist and delicious!  I made it with half blueberries, half blackberries, added 1 cup white chocolate chips... for the topping, I added a tsp cinnamon and a 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  It was a big hit at the office!  Thanks!

Delicious and plentiful!  Easy to make, rises well, and disappears almost immediately!  for the topping, I used brown sugar and added in cinnamon and nutmeg.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

This is truly a great cake. I baked it in a 10" x 15" jelly roll pan @ 350 for 1 hr. I doubled the topping using 2/3 c white sugar, 2/3 c brown sugar and 1 tbs cinnamon. I also used about 3c of berries sprinkled on top. The result was wonderful..EVERYONE LOVED IT!! I'm going to try peaches next time.

This was one of the best coffeecakes I've had in a long time!  It was sooooo moist and yummy!  I used 2 cups of frozen raspberries insstead of blueberries.  The possibilities are endless with this very versatile recipe.  You could use just about any fruit, and also add nuts to the top.  Thanks so much for the recipe, I can't wait to make it again!!!!!!!!

In a word? WOW! I made this into jumbo muffins (an even dozen) and they're spectacular. Moist and flavorful. I incorporated a tsp of freshly grated lemon rind and used lemon extract in place of vanilla (since I adore the combo of lemon and blueberry) and substituted Splenda for half the sugar (to make them more diabetic friendly.) They rose up nice and high. I skipped the crumb topping, opting to merely give a shake of pearl sugar instead for sparkle. I'm sure it would be fabulous with the streusel, but this recipe is so good, it makes a delicious product all on its own without any adornment. Be aware that your product will not get overly brown on top, so don't keep baking, expecting that to happen  - you'll end up with a dry cake. Coat the blueberries with some of the flour called for. It will keep the berries from sinking to the bottom. Also, wait until the very last second to gently fold in the blueberries to avoid having a purple-blue "smurf cake."

Great recipe. Even though the texture was light and moist, I was hoping for a slightly smaller crumb- still very yummy though.  To make this spectacular, I made this in a 10x15 inch dish (still rose very high), and added 3 rows of cream cheese filling under the streusel (used 1/2 brown sugar and cinnamon for the struesel).  For the cream cheese mixture, I combined an 8oz pkg of softened cream cheese w/ 2-3 Tbsp milk, 2 Tbsp sugar, and 1 egg.  Everyone RAVED about it... will definitely make again.

You do not have to lower the amount of baking powder, you will end up with a flat cake if you do. The "metallic" taste you are referring to is poor quality baking powder. I would recommend you find one that does not contain aluminum, the Rumford brand is carried in almost all grocery stores and does not contain aluminum.

I typically cringe when I read reviews where the person has changed so many aspects I ask myself "why did this person review"?  With that said, I did make this coffee cake only adding the zest of one lemon to the topping.  This is a large coffee cake and without the added dimension of another flavor, the blueberries could have become repetitive and/or lost.  But the basic recipe is good, you could also add a bit of orange zest to the topping too.  But traditionally bakers do use lemon zest.

The texture of this cake was wonderful.  It was an instant hit with my family!  I made it the first time with Blueberries and Nagoon Berries.  Also made it for a family function using apples.  Best coffee cake recipe I have ever made!  THANK YOU!

I had lots of fresh blueberries and exactly one cup of fresh buttermilk to use up so I came online in search of something to bake and found this wonderful recipe! I scaled this recipe in half for an 8X8 pan and added about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the crumb topping. In addition, I dusted the fresh blueberries with a little AP flour before gently folding it into the batter. I baked the cake for 60 minutes and it rose up perfectly. This coffeecake turned out terrific. The crumb topping is  so tender and moist with a light "buttery" taste. The cake itself it also moist and delicious, but not overly sweet - just right! The coffeecake has a light, fluffy and delicate texture to it which I really like a lot! Most of the blueberries held up nicely in the cake, not sinking all the way to the bottom. This is very pretty when cut into squares showing the blueberries baked inside the cake. We all really enjoyed this! One of the best coffeecakes I've had in a long time. Next time I may even add some nuts to the crumb topping and bake the full recipe. This is definitely a recipe worth keeping for future use again! Thank you Bata for sharing this recipe with us.

This turned out to be good and moist.  I can understand why some thought it may be a bit bland...I think it could have used some more blueberries.

Many things about this recipe that appeal to us and, for once, a cake that is not loaded with sugar but still tastes wonderful.   Unfortunately, felt that it needed more flavoring hence lots of grated lemon rind (we love lemon). I definitely agree that there is absolutely no substitution for fresh buttermilk - for texture, taste and end result

This coffee cake is moist and delicious.  I used 2 cups of fresh raspberries, and as per other suggestions swapped brown sugar in the topping and added some cinnamon.  MMMMMMM!  So good I made another one for our neighbors with blueberries.  With both cakes, I did have the problem with my berries sinking to the bottom.  Overall, very pleased with this recipe.

Went to bake this the night before Mother's Day.  At 10:30 pm my oven decided to go out on me!  I didn't have choice but to cover the dish and refrigerate it until the next day.  I was worried if it would work or not since my blueberries were frozen when I added them to the mixture.  I baked this 13 hours after I mixed it up....AND it was wonderful.  Not a thing lost by refrigerating this so long.  It was enjoyed by all and went nicely with the Denver Omelet Pie from this site.  Thanks BATA for sharing your recipe.

I used brown sugar in the crumble topping, made a half recipe, and baked it in an 8 x 8 dish for 55 min.  Otherwise all else was as is.  It was very yummy!  Between myself and my husband we polished it off in 2-3 days.  He wanted me to instantly make another.  We were eating it for desert, with the crumble topping, it was plenty sweet enough.  The cake part came out just like my reduced fat muffin recipe from Joy of Cooking (in other words, it was good).  It was not dry at all, nice and moist!

This cake looks impressive especially on cake platter with a glass cover - but I wish it had tasted as good as it looked. It was ok - not great. Ina Garten's sour cream coffee cake is much better.

This is the absolute BEST blueberry coffeecake that I have ever made.  I was bowled over by the flavor!  I used turbinado sugar in the topping and baked the cake in a tube pan.

I made this exactly according to directions, and while tasty it was lacking that certain something. I think next time I'll take reviewers' suggestions and add various spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg. It was good, very tasty, but could use some zest.

Delicious.  I made this exactly according to the recipe, but baked it in two springform pans - one 8-inch and one 9-inch.  We used one for a Sunday-morning birthday cake and got compliments from the neighbors on the other.  I'll make this again.

Terrific recipe. I used 10x15 pan and doubled the topping substituting brown sugar for the white.

This is the first coffee cake that I bake. It is also the first time I use buttermilk in a cake recipe. I was surprised by the texture of the cake. It was a little spongy. It gets much better if you eat it a day after. The good thing is that you can keep it for few days and it won't dry up since it is really moist.
I doubled the streussel topping recipe and I would use cinnamon if I make it again. I think 60 minutes baking time is too long as the cake gets really brown.
Over all my friends liked the taste so did I. It is different than the other cakes I have ever baked.

I divided it in half to make in a 8X8 pan and it was a beautiful and elegant coffeecake. The batter was VERY thick. I thought I had overmixed it but the end result was perfectly textured. The blueberries drifted to 1/4 inch from the bottom in a layer, but I LOVED it that way. I used fresh frozen berries and followed the EXACT recipe. Dont use brown sugar in the topping! Use regular white sugar. It fits so well with the overall product's taste and brown sugar wouldn't look as pretty, nor taste as good!

This is wonderful. I too used lemon instead of vanilla and brown sugar in place of white for the topping.  Next time I will add cinnamon.  The cake is HUGE.  Thanks for sharing.

nice, not too-sweet coffee cake that was mile high!  the real buttermilk is a must, don't ruin it with other milks or powdered buttermilk.  i used frozen blueberries and rolled them in flour before adding.  nice distribution of berries.  Made again with strawberries using half brown\white sugars  -outstanding!

This is soooooo yummy & moist. I made a double batch. It was great in the morning with coffee, of course, but also marvelous to graze on during the rest of the day. Come evening, it turned into dessert with a dollop of whipped cream.

I followed the directions and made no changes. The crumb topping was excellent and cake was moist, not overly sweet which I liked. Batter was thick so dont let that make you second guess. Makes a very big cake so it will be great for a large family or event. Definately a keeper and will make many times again! Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic! Tender, moist cake and spectacular crumb topping, though it definitely needs cinnamon added to it. I follwed this recipe just as written and wouldn't change anything else though. Be sure to use the real deal buttermilk or you may be disappointed in the results. Substitutes will yield a substandard result. This recipe makes a lot so it's great for a crowd, and absolutely worth sharing.

What a moist fluffy delicious coffee cake. I followed the very easy directions exactly except for three cups of fresh blueberries. and a dash of cinnamon in the batter and the topping. This cake wasn't overly sweet and the blueberries bursting in each bite gave just the right amount of sweetness along with the buttery crunch topping. My cake was done in 47 minutes to perfection and really rose up beautifully. I figured it would fall after I took it out of the oven, but it never did, it was really impressive looking. I took to a BBQ and everyone raved about it. Great served warm, just reheat in the microwave about 20 seconds.

I was excited to try this, but found it to be somewhat bland.  I followed the recipe exactly (using local spray-free blueberries we had frozen this past summer).  The frozen berries did not have a problem with sinking in the batter, the extra coldness made the batter extra thick and it helped them stay aloft.  I made this in a 13x9 pan as recommended, and could not get the center fully baked, even after the outside started to get dry and crusty.  It definitely took much longer than the 45-60 min to bake.  Flavor wise, the part with the topping and any bites with blueberries were nice, but the cake itself was rather bland.  If I were to make this again (I doubt that I would), I would add some spices and probably more berries as well.  Or maybe swirl some of the crumb layer through the rest of the cake.  As for the reviewer who halves the baking powder due to metallic taste, there is no metallic taste when you use a high quality aluminum-free baking soda.  I use Hain featherweight (made with potato starch instead of corn, so we don't have to worry about gmos) and we never have to worry about that yucky metallic taste.  I would highly recommend investing in aluminum-free baking powder.  It is tastier and better for your health, since aluminum is a known neurotoxin.

Very nice!  I made half this recipe in an 8” square baking pan and baked for 50 minutes.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I had intended to add some chopped pecans to the topping and forgot.  I dusted my blueberries with flour before adding to the batter but most still sank to the bottom, but that could have been my berries, as some were pretty large.  This was the perfect recipe to use up one cup of leftover buttermilk I had on hand.  I’ll make this again with the pecans for a little added crunch and texture.  Thanks for the recipe BATA!

Wonderful coffee cake.  I did switch out the topping sugar to brown sugar and added some walnuts.  Tweaked it alittle by adding cinn and nutmeg also.
Yummy

I made it exactly as written and it was moist but not worth making again or wasting blueberries.  I wouldn't bother trying to fix it.  I only fix recipes that start out good and this one didn't.  It could be 2 stars but I only gave it one because of all of the 5 stars that modified it to make it taste good.

This is a wonderful cake.  Don't even think of not using real buttermilk!  I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out wonderful.  It's tempting to want to use brown sugar and cinnamon for the topping, but I used the white sugar as written and it was delcious.  Perfect with a cup of coffee on the porch at the lake!

Very tasty!  I made this using fresh strawberries instead of blueberries and it was devoured within a day or two!  I definitely agree with other reviews, add brown sugar & cinnamon to crumb topping.  Not a very sweet cake. Next time I make this, I may increase sugar to 1-1/2 cups.

This makes a massive cake, and it took nearly three hours to cook all the way through, and over flowed all over the oven.  So this time, I'm going to half the recipe and see what happens.

I made this coffeecake and it was delicious. I did take advice from others who have used the recipe and added lemon extract to the batter instead of vanilla. I also used brown sugar, a pinch of nutmeg and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping mixture. It came out GREAT!!!! We really liked the taste..It only lasted the day at our house after I gave our son a very large portion of the cake to take home. This is definitely a keeper. THANKS TRICIA for sharing.....

This is absolutely the BEST Blueberry Coffee Cake I have ever had.  I've tried several and have found none better.  Next time I made this, I think I will try making it into muffins.  Should be good that way too.

I bring a baked treat in for my colleagues at work most Monday mornings. This week, this wonderful coffeecake was a huge hit, garnering me many compliments and expressions of appreciation. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I followed the suggestion of one reviewr and added a half-teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter (didn't add any to the crumb topping). The cake rose nicely in a 9X13 pan; I didnt detect any "off" taste from the chemical leavening. I used frozen blueberries, thawing them overnight. Dredging the (thawed) berries in a scoop of the flour was a bit messy, and most (but not all) of them ended up migrating toward the bottom of the cake, anyway. Not a big issue.

Thanks, BATA, for a great recipe! I'll probably be making this coffeecake again, once fresh blueberries are at the farmers market. My public demands it!

I made this today for the first time and I'm blown away by how good it is.  I halved the recipe, except for the vanilla, but otherwise made it as directed.  I don't write many reviews, but this is so amazing I feel like I have to sing its praises.  It's not too sweet, perfectly moist, and the crumb is excellent.  Fantastic recipe!

I made this last night - it's very good.  The only thing I did different was replace the white sugar in the topping with brown sugar (just because all the toppings I ever made were with brown sugar).  I cooked mine for 45 minutes and it was ready.  We ate it this morning for breakfast-I will make this again.

I replaced half a cup of milk with lemon and subbed the vanilla with lemon oil. I also added lemon zest to the cake itself and to the topping. It is my husband's current favorite cake. Thanks for the recipe! It is delicious!

The only change I made was to omit the topping. We didn't really like this cake, so I won't be making it again. It was kinda bland.

Perfect.  I only use 1/2 cup sugar and use canola oil instead of melted butter.  For a variation I often throw in a cup of chocolate chips and leave off the topping.  Very good too.

Another fantastic recipe from this site!  I had a lot of buttermilk to use up and picked this recipe since I had fresh blueberries in the freezer.  I didn't make any changes to the cake mixture but did add a little cinnamon to the topping.  The texture of the cake is so light and fluffy.  All my blueberries sank to the bottom even though I tossed them in some of the flour mixture.  It didn't matter though because it tastes great.  I think this would be great with brown sugar and pecans in the topping too.  Thanks for another great recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe! I had no problems with my fresh blueberries sinking. It is very moist and a perfect coffee cake. It rose beautifully. The only reason I tried this recipe is because I had buttermilk I needed to use up and now I will have to buy buttermilk for this recipe alone! A keeper! Thanks!

This recipe as written was easy to make and delicious.  I added cinnamon to the crumb topping to give it that extra kick and it was great.  I am going to use this as my base recipe and change the berries up.

ok... a little bland.  I added a little cinnamon, next time I'll adding a little more and some nutmeg.
It did bake up beautifully and the topping was great.

I split this recipe into two 8" cakes, following the recipe for one and substituting honey for the sugar in the other.  The honey cake was awesome.  The sugar cake tasted a little flat to me and maybe had a little too much 'tang' from the buttermilk.  Used the food processor to mix up the topping and it was very good.

So delicious, most, and flavorful! I halved the recipe and put into a 9inch springform pan sprayed with non-stick spray and parchment on the bottom. Took about 35-40 minutes.

One of the best coffee cakes ever!  Followed the recipe exactly.  The buttermilk gives it a great moist texture.  The flavor was right on, not overly sweet.  Will definitely be making this one again and maybe trying it with other types of fruit!

The cake is delicious. I also doubled the crumb topping but used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar with 1 cup of flour and used same amount of butter. I also made a powdered sugar glaze. Even better the next day.

This cake is amazingly good.  It makes a very large cake and my 9 x 13 pan was big enough but the butter from the topping leaked onto the bottom of my oven a bit.  Next time I know to either make it in 2 pans, or line the oven.  The only change I made to the recipe was using semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of berries to appeal to the masses and everyone loved it.  I want to try this recipe as muffins someday.  Great texture all around.

This coffeecake was a hit at church and at home.  This recipe makes a very full 9 x 13 pan so don't make it unless you're planning to feed a lot of mouths.  Used the cinnamon in the topping as recommended & also made 2 batches of topping.  1 1/2 of the topping was about just right.  Dusting the blueberries with flour helped somewhat.  Cooking time was definitely closer to 1 hr.  Recipe is a keeper!

I found some beautiful raspberries and blackberries at the .99 store, I couldn't find a recipe for mixed berry cobbler and had buttermilk to use up as well. I decided to take a chance and make this coffeecake and I'm glad I did!! This was excellent!! It could have been better only if I had had some vanilla  ice cream. Thank You for another keeper!!

This cake is freaking awesome!  So moist and light with bursts of blueberries in each bite... Everyone raved.  I decreased the sugar a teeny bit, and followed another person's advice of coating the blueberries in the dry mixture to prevent them from sinking to the bottom which worked perfectly.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and chopped pecans to the crumb topping- YUM.  Next time I'll probably double the crumb topping as I only had enough to cover about half the cake (adding a little more flour to the mix as well for a sturdier crumb).

This was really good.  As suggested by many others, I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar and added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  Delish!!!  I think I will make 1 1/2 times the topping next time, or maybe even double it.  This is a really good recipe.  Everyone in my family really enjoyed it.

Just like this site, this cake was
fabulous!  I added nuts and a teaspoon of
cinnamon to the crumb topping as others suggested and everyone raved over this cake.  So moist and flavorful, wonderful texture and great presentation if baked in a 9" springform pan.  [Although you do not have to use all the batter if baked in a springform pan.]  Thanks for making my research to find the best coffeecake so easy!

This does make a large cake.  I didn't use as much sugar as it calls for and it still turned out fantastic.  Everyone loved it and was asking for the recipe.  I will use this one again but when I have a large crowd.

This coffee cake was excellent! I cut the recipe in half but pretty much followed the original. I did use about 1 1/4 cup buttermilk instead of 1. Also used frozen blueberries, partially defrosted. For the struesel topping I used 1/2 brown sugar and put in a little cinnamon. Baked for 48 minutes in a dark pan. The blueberries did sink to the bottom despite dusting them with flour but no matter. It was perfect - very moist!

The coffeecake turned out really good... it's quite moist considerin there isn't that much butter.  The edge of the cake gets a little dry however... the flour:butter ratio of the struesel also doesn't seem quite right to me... maybe it needs a little more flour.  Overall, a very yummy coffeecake.

This coffecake recipe is delicous!  I made it for my husband and father-n-law and they couldn't get enough of it.  It's so moist!  I split the recipe in half and made it in a 9 inch glass baking dish.  Also, don't worry if you don't have buttermilk; to make one cup of buttermilk use 1 tablespoon lemon juice plus enough milk to make one cup!

This was so yummy!!! I did change it a bit. Instead of using blueberries, I used a can of peaches, (the large 29 ounce can) and I did double the topping. AND IT WAS EXCELLENT!!! The cake was perfectly moist, while the topping was crunchy. Oh, I did have to cook it for about 10 minutes longer, maybe because of using peaches instead. BUT IT WAS PERFECT. My family was shocked at how good the cake was... Thank you SO MUCH for sharing your recipe. It is a keeper!!!

I made this coffecake last Sunday for my college Sunday School class.  I have to be honest.  I was very disappointed in this cake.  It does make a very thick, tall cake in a 9 x 13 dish, but it is not exciting at all.  I would not make this again for all the trouble.  Sorry.  I am a good cook, but this one is not for me.

This is DELICIOUS!!!!
I used half brown sugar, half white sugar, and about 3TBLSP cinnamon for the topping and doubled the amount in the recipe, as the topping absolutely made this cake. Also took advice of coating the blueberries so they wouldn't sink. One hint; don't overcook- it will get rubbery really quick. It was great!

I thought this was a fairly average cake.  It tastes pretty good but is very heavy; not moist at all.  The crumble top is a nice touch but I feel like I made a giant blueberry muffin.  If you make this, make sure you really butter the pan otherwise you have no chance of getting the cake out.

Very traditional coffee cake recipe - the old fashioned type - excellent - thanks for sharing!!!  We shared with our neighbors - who had never heard of coffee cakes at all - and they loved it!!  If anyone thinks this coffee cake is "heavy" in texture - eat it with a nice hot cup of coffee (or tea) - the way it was meant to be eaten - hence the name!!!

I took this cake to my families Fourth of July cookout because it was supposed to feed a large group. Well when I brought the cake to the party, it went before the cookout even got started! Everyone loved it! I've made it five times since. Thanks Tricia

JUST INCREDIBLE!!!  This makes a HUGE 9x13 cake.  It rises very high and takes about an hour (or just over) to bake.  

The first time I made it, I served it at two different events and had plenty to go around.  I also froze some and took it out of the freezer for another time and it was still delicious.  I made this cake again tonight and plan on serving a good portion of it at a meeting tomorrow and freezing the balance for this weekend where I will serve it to about 10 more people.  

This cake is AWESOME.  I am not a huge blueberry fan and this cake is just wonderful.

This recipe was so easy to do!  It wasn't too sweet and the crust is so good.  I'd add some nutmeg & cinnamon to the topping to make it stand out a bit more.  Great recipe!

This was soooo good!! It is really a big cake cake, rises alot during baking, plenty to feed a crowd. Next time might add more blueberries and not mix them in, just sprinkle on top of cake batter, then put on crumb topping. But very, very good!!! Will make all the time when have leftover buttermilk!

Don't pass this recipe up. It's wonderful. However, I believe it's too much batter for a 9x13 pan.  The cake was quite high. The next time I make it I'll use 2 8x8 pans....and give one away. Nobody should be denied the experience of eating this masterpiece. I gave some to my neighbor and her husband threatened to leave her and marry me so he could eat this all the time. Now that's a wild review.

Really liked it - nice dense and moist. The only thing I'd change is putting an extra 1/4 cup of sugar in the batter. And for the crumb topping putting more sugar and 2 tbsp more butter to it.

Really, I was only looking through recipes for something to use up the last of my buttermilk, and I came across this and decided to try it out. Like at least one other reviewer mentioned, I decided to exchange the 2/3 cup white sugar with 2/3 cup dark brown sugar for the topping. I brought it into the office to share, and it was all gone within 1/2 a day. I was even asked for the recipe I used! This is definitely something I'll make again the next time I have extra buttermilk.

I used brown sugar instead of white for the crumb topping.  I also couldn't find anything to sift the ingredients with so I just mixed everything without sifting - came out great but not sure if it would be better if I did sift.  Brought it to work and everyone loved it!

Excellent. I made half a recipe in an 8 by 8 glass dish but used two cups of blueberries tossed in flour and the entire recipe of topping. Baked for 50 minutes and it was perfect. I did add some nutmeg, lemon zest and cinnamon to the topping. 
I will make again and use other flavor combinations.

I was in a rush so didn't use the beaters at all. Melted the butter and stirred in the sugar. Handbeat the eggs and put them both in. Used about 2/3 buttermilk and 1/3 regular milk. All turned out well. Very tasty and I hear the folks raved about it at the breakfast I sent it to.

I found this dry and wished I had added more blueberries for moisture and flavor. The topping was odd and tasted like shortbread. I much prefer the recipe for Blueberry Buckle on Allrecipes.

I made this and used plain unsweetened yogurt in place of buttermilk since I had some that needed using and instead of topping in recipe I
just sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  That saved a lot of calories and still tasted really good. I made the full recipe and baked in 8 x 8 and 9 x 9 inch pans.  I froze one for later. Very good recipe that I will keep in my file.

I though this tasted good, although I dont have a lot of experience with crumb cakes. I was kind of surprised with how dense the batter was that the actual cake was so soft. I found, I preferred this better the next day as the texture was more sturdy. Overall, this tasted like a mix between cake and a blueberry muffin to me. My favorite part was the fresh blueberries I had to use for it. Only change I made was making 1/2 recipe and baking in my Nordicware 9x9 sized pan. It worked perfectly. I cut it into 12 muffin sized square pieces of cake. The serving size was plenty and it cut the calories in half.

Very good and moist. The buttermilk really changes the texture and keeps it from drying out. The only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white and added some cinnamon to the streusel topping. I made a half recipe in an 8"x8" pan and used 3/4 of a recipe of the topping (we LOVE streusel!). My boyz loved it. Ate it for dessert last night and again for breakfast this morning. Thanks for a really nice recipe!

I am now making this for the 2nd day in a row.  I had started out with half a batch and everyone wanted more so I am making it again.  The baking time was a little longer for me (about an hour) and I subbed almond extract for the vanilla and added a little cinnamon to the topping, otherwise I made as directed. I did try the trick of coating the blueberries with the flour and I didnt have any problem with sinking to the bottom. Awesome recipe!

We enjoyed this!  Very moist from the buttermilk, and not too sweet.  Great with a nice cup of coffee.  I did add about 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the topping, just because.  Thanks!

So yummy, it turned out very moist.  I took some advice from other reveiwers and used brown sugar in the topping instead of white. I also added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the topping as well.  We all loved this.

YUM!  I made these into Jumbo muffins, and baked for about 35-40 minutes.  They reminded me of the jumbo blueberry muffins at Perkins. =)  Sooo good!!

Delicious. I made it exactly as written. I will make again! I might try with lemon extract instead of vanilla next time- sounds delicious.

This was my first coffee cake and it was simple to make and deeeeelicious!! I even made a few changes since blueberries weren't really in season. I added chocolate chips instead and added some cinnamon to the topping for some extra flavor. Moist, not too sweet, a definite keeper!

The topping on this coffee cake ruined it for me.  It needs a brown sugar topping.  I wish I had read more of the reviews as know I see others suggest that as well!  I gave it to my husband to bring to work, not worth the calories to me.

I added about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to both the cake's dry ingredients and to the crumble on top. I also substituted brown sugar for sugar in the topping. I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan. It took about an hour and came out moist, evenly baked, and absolutely delicious! Long live buttermilk!

I'm finding this hard to rate because while it wasn't bad, it just wasn't what I had in mind in the slightest. The texture of the cake was wonderful and the crumb topping was what I was looking for, but the cake itself lacked flavor for me and what flavor there was in the berries seemed to be overshadowed by the buttermilk. My husband loved it, and ate practically the whole thing. Also, I pulled it out after 45 minutes and I wish I had taken it out AT LEAST 5 min early. It would have been better slightly underdone than over.

What a super recipe! I used Blackberries and it turned out beautifully. The topping is very nice, you must include it when making this recipe. It rose pretty high and makes a nice presentation. Great recipe as is! Thanks.

doubled the crumble topping, and that worked well.  I did mess up a bit with the temperature, and slightly burned some of the top, but that picked off easily.  Now i have to decide if I should share this at work, or hoard it for myself...   Next time I might not bother doubling the topping, the recipe really lets the fresh wild blueberries be the star.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe exactly but halved it to 6 servings (remember the printed directions will still be for 12 servings.)  I baked it for 40 minutes and it was so good....I had to go make another to take over to Mom and Dad.  (They provide the huckleberries).  We used fresh - but if you use frozen - be sure to let them drain for at least 30 minutes before adding them to your batter.  Will definately make this again...and again.

I know what I like in coffee cakes and was looking for something to use up some boysenberries.  The recipe was modified quite a bit:  replaced 1 cup of flour with whole wheat flour, decreased sugar to 1 cup.

The topping had the most revisions:  added 2/3 cup oats, 1 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 cup chopped walnuts and used brown sugar instead of white sugar.

This was spectacular.  I will keep this recipe handy to use for any berry coffeecake.

This was really good when I made it for Easter brunch. I tossed the blueberries with a little flour to prevent them from sinking. I added some chopped pecans to half of the topping (we have both nut lovers and nut haters in the family) and sprinkled half of the cake with plain topping and half with nut topping. I actually preferred the plain side and I usually like nuts. I will add this to my recipe box and make it again.

I think this bread could have been a bit sweeter, and mine turned out chewy for some reason.  Overall not bad but could use improvements; I may try it again and add different things (such as more cinnamon and sugar).

Excellent. I used fresh blueberries and dusted them with flour and they stayed throughout the cake. The buttermilk makes the batter thicker which helps keep the berries suspended, but also gives you a tangy, moist cake. The white sugar topping adds a nice finishing touch. This is the best blueberry cake recipe yet!

good way to use up the extra buttermilk.  This does make a full 9x13 cake.  I added some cinnamon to the topping with a bit of oatmeal for texture and crunch, along with a little extra flour/sugar mixture.  Used half brown/half white sugar. Added some grated orange zest to the batter.  Took 70 minutes in my oven.  The cake itself is not real sweet so with the addition of the topping, it is not sickening.  Sampled it warm; would be good with some vanilla ice cream.  It definitely needs some personal touches as far as extra flavors and spices in order for it not to be too bland.

I cut this recipe in half and made it in an 8x8 pan, using King Arthur organic white whole wheat flour; it came out nice and moist.  Adding cinnamon to the topping gave it an extra boost.  Nice, basic coffeecake.

Outstanding!  Should be called Blueberry Muffin Cake!  I used the tip on doubling the topping and using brown sugar and cinnamon.  My family loved it.  One of the best blueberry cakes I've tried.

OK, so I'm still looking for a good Blueberry Almond coffee cake, so I changed this a little. I added about 1 cup of sliced almonds to the cake batter, and well about about 3-4 tsps almond extract. I also added a couple tsp almond extract to the crumb topping as well. The other change I made was to add an almost cheesecake layer to this. I mixed 1/2 cup cream cheese, 1/2 full fat sour cream, 1 egg, and 1 tsp vanilla extract. After I poured the batter into the pan, I poured this cream cheese/sour cream mixture on the batter, and then topped with the crumb topping. My mistake was though, I baked this in a springform pan. DON'T DO IT! *LoL* Turns out there is WAY too much batter for that small of a pan. It took forever to cook!!! I should have used the pan suggested by the submitter. Anyway, all in all, good flavour. Served it warm with some vanilla ice cream. Strongly reccomend the addititon of the almond. :)

This cake helped me use up the rest of my remaining buttermilk.  I mixed in toasted walnuts and dried cranberries in there - tasted wonderful.  My family couldn't get enough of it!

I'm sorry to say that I did not care for this cake at all.  I have many terrific recipes for coffeecake, but this one simply did not live up to the promise.  My husband did not care for it either.  The cake lacked flavor and was very dry.  Although I did cook it for about 55 minutes and a toothpick inserted in the center came out clean, the cake fell in the center after cooling.  I'll stick to my other tried and true coffeecake recipes.

Best coffeecake ever!  Followed recipe to a "T".  Very moist, fluffy and delicious.  Great to serve for a large group since it makes a 13 x 9 pan.  Will definitely make this again, probably for family during the holidays!!

This coffee cake was soooo good!  I did not have quite 2 cups of buttermilk, so I just used whole milk to make up the difference.  I used frozen blueberries thawed out overnight and coated w/ flour, they did not sink to the bottom as did for others.  The topping is the best part, tastes like a blueberry muffin.  Thanks for sharing!!

I love this cake! After making it according to these instructions, I decided to modify the recipe slightly. I couldn't find buttermilk so I substituted yogurt. I used three cups of berries in the batter and divided it between two bundt pans. Because I was making two cakes I doubled the amount of topping and used brown sugar instead of white. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping and about 1/2 a cup of additional berries. Baking time was about an hour.
One of the cakes is for now..the other is hidden in the freezer for unexpected company.

This cake is delicious.  Not everyone in our family is crazy about blueberries but the cake disappeared!!  I bake something from scratch almost everyday and I will be making this again.  I did make two changes -- I used canned blueberries (not the filling) and added cinnamon to the topping.  For those of you who said the blueberries fell to the bottom simply stir berries with a bit of flour first prior to adding to the batter.

I was very disappointed in this cake.  The reviews made it sound so wonderful.  It was pretty and very moist but just didn't have that "wow" taste.  I actually think blueberry muffins from a box mix taste better and are much easier.  I did use the lemon extract instead of vanilla and the cake tasted too lemon-y to me.  I also did the brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg on top.  It was good, but like I said, I've had much better.  A lot of work for being just OK.

I grew up not liking blueberries, but somehow over the last couple of years, I've developed a real love for them. This recipe is a wonderful use of blueberries. I have also used raspberries, which are wonderful. I am now anxiously awaiting the ripening of our delicious Oregon wild blackberries to try. I may event try it with fresh sliced peaches. This is a good basic coffee cake recipe. Simple enough to surprise your family, yet fancy enough to impress your guests. I highly recommend this recipe, and don't be afraid to experiment with it.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  The recipe made so much that I sent some with my husband, who's a fireman.  My family was upset with me, because they loved it so much.  But the Fire Dept was very appreciative!  I did make one change, I substituted lemon extract for the vanilla - I always like lemon/blueberry combinations.  This recipe is definitely on permanent file in my collection!

Pretty good coffeecake. A good thing to do with the carton of blueberries that I bought on impulse. Mine came out pretty dry, but I may have just overcooked it (went for 48 minutes). I also had no buttermilk, substituted 2 c. milk w/ 2 T lemon juice. I'll try it the right way next time (there will be a next time!)

This recipe is VERY GOOD! I only made half of the recipe and the cake batter was enough to fill a 9" spring form pan. This made the cake LOOK GORGEOUS! The only change I made was to use brown sugar for the topping and a dash of cinnamon. The cake itself is not too sweet at all, but the delicious crumb makes up for the batter's less sugary flavor. Feel free to adjust the white sugar of the batter depending on the sweetness of your berries, but IMO the amount of sugar of the batter is just right. The cake itself is moist and crumbly.  I will make this again just half the recipe is enough for a small crowd!

Whoa! Tastes like the best blueberry muffin I ever had! I changed none of the ingredients within the cake, including using fresh blueberries I added a smidge more just to use the tiny bit extra  I would have left over. 

I used the basic crumble on top, but used brown sugar in place of the white, and I finely crushed walnuts to add to it, spooning it over the cake before cooking it for a bit longer than recipe had said to ensure it was completely done. (That’s just an oven variance for me, as I didn’t use the convection setting.) 

It’s not sweet enough for my youngest child, but this is truly just sweet enough (especially when you get to a juicy blueberry in it). I absolutely love it!

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

Just made this today and used frozen blueberries. It turned out perfectly and absolutely no changes are needed for this recipe. You can make it just as it is. It worked just fine with frozen blueberries, for those that are wondering. No changes to the recipe are "NEEDED" but this tiny, minor tweak will make it amazing: for the topping, use brown sugar instead of white sugar, and add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. That's it. We'll make this again and again.

Add the blue berries after you spread the batter in the pan.  Next time I’m going to add less flour or more butter and buttermilk.  Everyone enjoyed it and ate all of it.  It’s not as sweet as other coffee cakes.  So if you are looking for a recipe that is not as sweet or buttery, this is for you.

I added a frozen blueberries, raspberries, cherries, and blackberries combo as I didn't have fresh blueberries.  This is the bomb, and I think adding the extra fruit made it better.  My co-workers love, love, love this!

I usually make the Blueberry Buckle recipe. Today I decided to try this recipe because I had extra buttermilk available. I'm always looking for new buttermilk recipes. Like Naples mentioned there's no comparison between baking with real buttermilk and only using clabbered milk in a recipe. Everything is better with real buttermilk. We liked this recipe because it's not overly sweet and it's definitely less clean up than the Buckle recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter and next time I will add another cup of blueberries. This makes a BIG cake so it can easily accept the added blueberries. Otherwise it was a fabulous recipe and will be five stars with a few more blueberries.

This recipe is excellent. I substituted lemon extract for the vanilla, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the crumb layer. This cake rises beautifully.

I've made this several times now with good results.  It does yield a thick batter and I've had no problem with berries sinking to the bottom of the pan.  Either fresh or frozen berries can be used with equal success.  I probably added a bit more flour to the streusel topping to achieve the consistency I wanted with about 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon mixed in as well.  Special thanks to Bookie/Bookmarker for her recommendation of this moist, delicious coffeecake.  It's one I'll make often.  :)

Made it exactly as suggested (buttermilk made with milk and lemon juice). My husband said, "this is delicious", after the first bite. If I could give it a higher rating I absolutely would. I'm already planning to make it with other fruit.

love this, ive been making it for years. typically i add a 1/2 cup of plain greek yogurt or sour cream if i have one on hand. translates really well to cupcakes, bake for 18 minutes. fun bonus: if you use thawed frozen blueberries(with the juice they put off), they’ll turn the cake blue

WOW, this is delicious blueberry coffeecake!  Made it this afternoon for the first time and I might just eat it for dinner!  Followed the recipe as written, except for the topping I used brown sugar instead of white, and added one tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also added the blueberries to the dry ingredients and folded it into the wet ingredients carefully by hand so not to break the blueberries.  Makes amazingly moist, not-too-sweet blueberry cake.  I hope it freezes well because it made a ton of food.  I'm going to make some coffee now, and have another piece!

If I took a picture, it would have been of an empty pan.  I got one small piece.  I used sweet milk and sour cream.  Next time, I'll get buttermilk.  I baked it for 60 mins., and thinking it use not quite done, I left it in for another six minutes.  I thought it was a little dry.  I took it to church to serve with coffee and got no complaints.  I marked this as a "favorite."

One word. FANTASTIC. Okay, 2 words -- DELICIOUS!  Followed the recipe exactly as written and the cake was tender and light and filled with blueberry goodness. Excellent recipe!  To those that criticized it, the recipe is perfect and if yours didn't turn out, then the mistake was on your end.

A very nice cake!  I made this without changes. It was moist. I agree with other reviews that omitting the vanilla and adding lemon zest would be better.  I did serve it with limoncello so the lemon zest would be a delicious addition.  My neighbors raved and asked for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious. I halved recipe but stuck to exact recipe. Incredibly moist and tender. Likely the best coffee cake I've ever made. Used frozen blueberries that I tossed lightly in flour. Will make again for sure!

Super easy and great tasting recipe. I subbed brown sugar for the white sugar in the topping and added just a little cinnamon, but otherwise made it exactly as written. I split the amount between two dishes, a 9x9 square ceramic  dish and a 4x9 rectangular ceramic dish. Cooked both for about 45 minutes and they were done.

It tastes ok, but quite bland, and all my blueberries sank, despite coating them in flour. The streusel was far too wet and sticky.

Wow, this cake gets huge when you bake it! Overall it is a very nice dense and moist cake. I found it a bit bland in flavour so I may add some cinnamon to the cake mix the next time I make it. Everyone else loved it. I also need to work on my topping skills. It all mixed together when I blended it, but I wound up just breaking it up into small pieces and sprinkling on top. It hardened a bit while baking, so I think I may have done something wrong.

A very light and fluffy cake, but a little bland.  If I made it again, I would add lemon juice and lemon zest.

Since it was the first time, I followed the recipe only using soured milk and the mixed berries I had in the freezer.  I thought about adding cinnamon to the topping - which I will do next time, but didn't cause I wanted to test the recipe.  It was excellent.  Very moist and fluffy and not too sweet.  My family really enjoys it.  Thank you.

I made a half batch with gluten free flour.  Used 3/4 tsp dried lemon zest instead of the vanilla, and loved the flavor.  I also used extra blueberries, and did not cut in half the crumble for the top, and baked for 50 minutes in an 8 x 8 pan.  The flavor was fantastic.  The upper half of the cake was dense but airy.  The bottom half of the cake was very dense and almost not baked fully on the bottom.  I think the combination of extra moisture from extra berries, a very wet and rainy day, and forgetting to remove the pan that covers the heat and vapors vent on top of the oven (the back burner of the stove), all contributed for a dense bottom half.    And I will use a larger pan the next time I make it.  It tasted great and the texture was good despite being heavy.

I chose this cake because I had buttermilk that needed consumed.  This is not a very sweet cake, so if you're a sweet lover, it may not satisfy your sweet tooth.  My blueberries sunk to the bottom of the cake.  It was airy and light.  The cake cut well and did not crumble, so had a pretty presentation.  I will make it again.

Tasty. I halved the recipe to fit an 8 inch square pan (baked for 45 minutes) I've been trying to make things healthier.. So I swapped out all the butter in the cake and used Greek yogurt. Also only used 1/2 cup of sugar (halved was, 2/3 cup) I still find it could have been reduced more, as the blueberries add a natural sweetness to it. I cannot imagine using the entire amount of sugar... Unless you enjoy things extremely sweet. I also decided to omit the topping. I served this for breakfast with a big dollop of Greek yogurt on top. My family enjoyed it!

YUM!!! So good! I need to use up the extra blueberries I had my freezer from the blueberry bushes in my back yard. I picked something great to use them in. I did replace the vanilla with lemon extract and used brown sugar for the cumble on top.

Cake comes out fluffy and delicious just following the original recipe. Not too sweet. You can also halve the recipe for a 9” round.

This recipe is really good, nice and moist, and not too sweet, but I foolishly tried another reviewers advice to mix the blueberries into the dry ingredients. I rarely use blueberries in baking, and these were frozen, so I gave it a try against my better judgement. Its a good thing turquoise is one of my favourite colours, because that is the colour of my cake. It still tastes delicious, and tomorrow my friends that are coming over will have a good laugh at my expense :)

Great recipe, although I changed the topping:  used brown sugar and added 1 tsp cinnamon, since we all love it.  Took it to church for fellowship and everyone loved it.  Definitely will make this again.

Really great coffeecake! Moist, flavorful, with plenty of blueberries (although I added a cup more!). The topping for me is perfect. Some reviewers didn't like the streusel sinking a bit into the cake. This was the part I loved - it distributed that yummy topping into the middle of parts of the cake...mmmm. Only changes I made (besides the extra blueberries): brown sugar instead of white for the topping and added 1 tsp cinnamon to the topping mix. Perfect!

Loved it...started baking again after a long time!!! The texture was beautiful....I did not have a 9x13 baking pan...so I made 2 6x6 cakes...
Earned a lot of compliments...substituted 1/2 flour with wheat flour...found the batter a little dry so added about 1/3 cup olive oil over and above the butter...For the crumble also, I used olive oil instead of butter..did not have blueberrys but really wanted to make this cake...so used strawberrys...
Turned out with a wonderful crunch!!!!!

Great recipe!  I cut the recipe in half and used coconut oil instead of butter in the batter.  Also used half brown sugar and half white sugar, half whole wheat flour and half AP flour and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients and chopped pecans to the topping.  So glad I had blueberries and buttermilk that I needed to use.  Will make again soon and will make the full recipe.  This cake did not last long at my house.  THANKS!

Great texture.  Had to alter due to not having butter on hand.  4 alterations, all worked we'll. Cake delicious.  
Used 1/2 whole wheat flour
Used smart balance instead do butter
Used smart balance, flax meal and oatmeal, along with flour and sugar in topping.

Light and very flavorful.

I had about a cup of leftover buttermilk that I wanted to use up before it expired, so I whipped up a half batch. Everyone in my family loved this.  The frozen blueberries were perfect with it. I also added some lemon zest since other reviewers recommended it.  I didn't measure how much, but it was a HUGE lemon, bigger than my fist, and I zested just over half of it.  I wouldn't think to make it with peaches, since they're not a berry, but after reading the reviews, I'll probably try that next. The coffee cake was a tad bit on the denser side than I imagined it, but then again, I've never made anything with buttermilk before (except last weeks cookies) so I didn't really have any concrete expectations. I thought the topping was perfect and not too sweet.  My mother, however, has no sweet tooth whatsoever (and is diabetic on top of that) and took the topping off her piece after tasting it, claiming it was too sweet. I will definitely be making this again.  Super easy recipe and everyone liked it.

Not my favorite.  Followed the recipe as is only doubled the topping.  The cake itself was very bland.  The best part about it is the topping.  Cake not sweet at all even for a coffee cake.  Maybe sugar the blueberries before stirring in the batter.  I won't be making this recipe again.  Off to try something new.

This recipe was a hit at work!  My co-workers especially enjoyed the crumb topping.  Very moist cake too! Though I did make a few alterations to the recipes- I used 2 cups of all-purpose flour and 2 cups of whole wheat flour.  I also replaced the blueberries with chocolate chips.  :-)

This is very delicious. I followed this recipe to the letter, but this took over an hour and a half to bake! I used the recommended size pan, but next time I will bake in a different size pan, so it won't take so long to bake.

I've never made a coffee cake before but wanted to try.  I didn't have enough white sugar so I had to use Splenda but it still turned out nice and moist.  I had one stick of butter for the dough but didn't have stick butter for the topping so I had to use country crock and splenda.  Still made a nice topping but I think if I would have cut it with real butter instead, the topping would have been more crumbly.  Overall though, great cake and the husband liked it so I'll be making it again!

This is a wonderful recipe!!  It produces a classic coffee cake - the kind you don't see much of anymore.  I kept the vanilla extract and zested one lemon into the flour mixture.  Used Wyman frozen wild blueberries.  When almost done alternating the flour and buttermilk into the batter, save a little bit of the flour mixture.  Gently stir the blueberries in the remaining flour mixture and fold into the batter at the last step.  Per other reviewers added 1 tsp. cinnamon into the streusal just to give it a little more "oomph."  Took one hour to bake.

I hate to be a downer, but to me this cake wasnt very sweet at all. To me it was more like eating bread. It baked up beautifully so I am giving it two stars...Im sorry its just kinda bland. I may try it again with adjustments made to it.

I think this is a great coffee cake recipe.  My kids said, "This is absolutely delicious!"  I had a little leftover buttermilk after this recipe, so I made a little powdered sugar drizzle with the buttermilk to go over the top, but it really didn't need anything else!

Exceptional!  The only modifications I made were as follows:  halved the recipe, used an 8x8 dish, sub'd almond extract for the vanilla, added 1/4c crushed toasted almonds to batter, added 1/4c crushed toasted almonds to topping.  This was truly exceptional.  Great flavor, extremely moist and not at all difficult to make.  I recommend this highly and would definitely make again!!

I've made this about 10 times and just LOVE it.  It is best if a little undercooked rather than overcooked.  No one seems to mind to goo.  It tastes so good!

This is a very easy recipe to make and does it ever make plenty. I cut the recipe in half and made a 8x8 pan filled to the brim.  It did take about 20 minutes longer to cook than in the instruction stated.

This was a huge hit for Easter morning and was very easy...I used frozen blueberries and it was good, but would have been better w/ fresh blueberries.

I guess there isn't a picture of this recipe yet because the coffeecake gets eaten before you can take a picture... this recipe got thumbs up from my two boys.  The only change I did was substitute the blueberries with elderberries (excellent for boosting kids' immune system in winter)  and I added  a tad bit more buttermilk.  This made it soft and moist.  The only thing I would do next time is add a little  more sugar.     Also, I took some extra batter and made a couple cupcakes!  They were delicious.

I thought, buttermilk and blueberries would make a perfect couple. I was a little dissapointed - as someone wrote earlier, I thought this cake is just a huge muffin. And not the best, I've ever made or eat. It is soggy but not very moist, more on the gluey side. It might be ok for breakfast but not as a cake. The best thing was the crumbly crust (you definitely have to add cinnamon to the crust!).

I thought this was a very easy, basic coffee cake recipe.  It is very good. As another reviewer mentioned, I'm sure it would be good with raspberries too. I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar in the topping.  Next time I would make a bit more topping since that really made it delicious.  Be careful with the stirring, I know I stirred mine more than I should have and it seemed a tiny bit rubbery but otherwise a very good coffee cake!

Wicked cake!!  It is huge, to say the least.  I added cinnamon to struesel mixture, and used brown sugar in struesel, also. I have made this twice in one week, and rave reviews followed.  This is a keeper, FO SHO!!!  I am making next weekend to take up to my aunt......they are gonna love it!!!  When the kids ask for it, you know they really love it!!

This recipe sounded wonderful however I was very dissapointed in the results.  I read all the reviews and used the lemon extract instead of vanilla extract.Also used brown sugar with the cinnamon and nutmeg and the topping was basically non exsistent on the finished product.  I coated the blueberries with some of the flower mixture before folding them into the cake and still, the majority of them sunk to the bottom.  I made this to take to a family reunion and ended up sprinkling powdered sugar on top to make it a little more appealing.  I am an experienced baker and have no clue why the end product was not as wonderful as other people thought it was.

Absolutely amazing. Soft, sweet, full of flavor and just great all around. had some trouble with still raw center, though i think it's just my oven and I baked it the second time for an hour. Very nice, I can't say enough about it. Will make again and again, even if I don't have a reason!
