This was so FLAVORFUL! I doubled the sauce only I took the suggestions of others & used just 1 tbp. of soy & 2 Tbp. of balsamic. I did brown the butter (what an aroma!) & also reduced the balsamic a bit after I added it to the butter. I poured the sauce over a broiled rib-eye steak as well as the asparagus. YUMMM! I served the steak & asparagus w/ a red grape & feta cheese on romaine salad &  glass of white zin, which complemented the flavors well...it was a very, very tasty meal.

I've been making asparagus this way for the past couple of years.  I discovered the recipe in an issue of Cooking Light magazine (the only difference is in Cooking Light they use kosher salt and omit the pepper, as I recall) and it is OUTSTANDING!  I've made this in my toaster oven (much better results than in a full-sized oven) for everyone who comes over to eat and they are always impressed.  It's absolutely THE simplist, best-tasting recipe for asparagus you'll find.  The trick, and this is an important note, is to slightly burn the butter (never use margarine) before adding the vinegar and soy.  Unbelieveable!

Not only healthy but good for you!  A MUST:  Brown the butter for the full richness of this side dish!

i have made this recipe on many occasions, since first seeing it in Cooking Light magazine.  I would suggest watching the asparagus carefully, as it goes to tender crisp to crisp quickly.  also, i sprinkle the asparagus with kosher salt prior to placing it to roast.  finally, the original recipe called for brown butter(melted til it is browned lightly), which is important, i think, for the overall taste.

This was fantastic!  I think it would be great on green beans as well.  If i had one recomendation, it would be to up the balsamic to 2 teaspoons, as it had more of a soy taste overall.  Also, since the recipe calls for soy, I skipped the salt altogether.  **Update**  I tried this on steamed green beans last night and I swapped the amounts of balsamic and soy.  This was even better than the original recipe, as it definately had more of a balsamic flavor.

Wow!  I used smart balance instead of butter, and did as other posters and used 1t of soy sauce and 1T of balsamic vinegar.  With the asparagus, I used EVOO spray, ground pepper, light drizzle of soy sauce and garlic powder.  I heated until brown and bubbly, then simmered til the spears were ready.  I poured the sauce over the spears into the same hot pan as the spears were cooked.  I think this helped to carmelize the balsamic vinegar.   So sweet and yummy, and not too salty.  This is my new fav!

WOW!!! I was not expecting to like this and I definitely didn't think my kids would. But we all LOVED it!!!! This is easy, tasty and good for you!! I did what others suggested, I 1) Browned the butter (not margaine) 2) Used Kosher salt and omitted the pepper 3) Used 1 tsp soy sauce and 1 TBSP of Balsamic vinegar. My daughter actually wanted me to make more when the asparagus serving dish was empty!!!! A definite keeper. P.S. I have made this many a time since reviewing, absolutely great, but if I am too lazy to make this very easy sauce, I just sprinkle asparagus with parmesan cheese after baking.

This is one of those recipes where the sum is more than the parts.  If you like asparagus, it is amazing how good this is.  Bake asparagus until it gets tender and starts to carmelize - if you take it out while still crunchy and fresh in the middle, it's not as good.  Definitely pour the sauce on immediately on taking it out of the oven, so it will sizzle.  I've also baked a piece of salmon with the asparagus, made extra sauce and poured it on both.  What a meal!!!

Very good and a very easy way to not overcook your asparagus-which is so easy to do.  I took others suggestions with the sauce and swapped the amounts for the soy and balsamic(1tsp soy, 1 tbs balsamic).  I also doubled the sauce which I really don't think you have to do because I didn't use it all in the end-and I had alot of asparagus.  I did brown the butter and it gave it such a nice taste with the sauces but next time I want to try just using melted butter not browned beacuse I think the brown butter overpowered the great flavors of the soy and balsamic.  But I must say it was still soo delicious that there was none left.  Really worth a try-you wont be dissapointed.

I found this recipe in Cooking Light Best of the Best Issue several years ago.  It made an asparagus lover out of my husband. We don't fix it any other way!!!  Small young shoots work best.  The butter should be browned slightly before adding sauces.

This was very good, no doubt, because roasted asparagus just is. In this recipe I was interested in the soy sauce/balsamic vinegar combination and really expected more unique results. The flavor, while good, was very subtle. Hubby didn't detect either the soy sauce or the vinegar.

This is absolutely not the same sauce if you don't brown the butter first.  To make this a main dish, cut the asparagus into 2-inch pieces and combine with 8oz. of thick-sliced portabella cut into similar sized chunks before placing into the oven.  Double the sauce.  Serve over Fettuccini.  Finish with a sprinkle of Parmesan.  Pairs well with a good Caesar salad.

SO GOOD!!! After reading reviews I did change it up a bit though... Did 1ts soy and 1tb balsamic.  Also, browned the butter first as others did and this provided a much richer, nuttier butter flavor than just melted butter would've. If you're not used to doing a brown butter, all you have to do is put it in a saucepan over medium low (4 on my stove) for about 5 minutes or until it's nutty and brown. Then spoon off the milk fat (butter foam) and discard. What you're left with is a clear, rich brown butter. Because you lose a little volume by discarding the foam, I always do a little bit more butter than called for in the original recipe.  And I personally don't think this recipe needs ANY added salt and actually think it would take away from the delicate balance of the flavors. SO YUMMY!

Cooking spray - are you kidding.  Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil over the asparagus --- much healthier.  Tastes great.

Perfect way to get in veggies!!! I used 1 Tablespoon balsamic vinegar and 1 teaspoon soy sauce and browned the butter. WORD OF ADVICE--eat as soon as its done otherwise the asparagus soaks up the sauce and it gets soggy.

This recipe is just like the Cooking Light recipe I have, but it uses Kosher salt.  Make sure you use a quality aged balsamic vinegar and let the butter start to brown for the best taste.  It truly makes all the difference in the world.  I have never added pepper, but often add a little garlic.

Great recipe - It's hard enough to get my husband to eat veggies so the fact that he ate this meant it was good.  This is very easy to do.  I microwaved the butter to melt it vs. heating it over the stove then added the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar.

I gave this only 4 as I had to change several things. First time I made this - like other reviewers, it was too salty and I found the sauce didn't meld with the asparagus. Since then I've omitted the salt (plenty in the butter and soya) equalize the soya and balsamic, melt and pour over the asparagus about 1/2 way to 3/4 of the way throu cooking. That last little bit in the oven with the sauce seems to meld it and do the trick for me. Yes, I too add some crushed garlic. This recipe is also wonderful with zucchini that has been quartered lengthwise. And so now I think it's a 5 star!

This super simple and tastes wonderful! I added some thinly sliced red peppers to the asparagus and they worked so well together (similar cooking times, both were tender). I used one tablespoon of soy sauce and two tablespoons of balsamic vinegar. The sauce was really rich, I might decrease the butter down from 2 tablespoons to 1 1/2 or so. As others have said, the sauce would be really good over any protein (red meat, poultry, fish). I served the asparagus and red bell peppers with about 4oz of Mediterranean seasoned tilapia. Honestly, the sauce would work well with any veggies. All in all, GREAT recipe... Officially added to my arsenal of quick fixes! :)

This was awesome! I used a bit less soy sauce and subbed balsamic vinaigrette cause that's all I had. Used big asparagus. DH and I both said..this is a keeper. Yum!

I don't think I care for the 2 strong flavors of the balsamic and soy on a delicate vegetable such as asparagus.  My soy sauce was even low sodium.  Don't think I'll make again...

Mmm...As other reviewers suggested, I used 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and 1 teaspoon of soy sauce.  Also, I left the asparagus in the oven a few extra minutes until it was slightly crispy.  This dish is good sprinkled with sliced almonds.

YOU MUST BROWN THE BUTTER! It is essential and absolutely delicious! Melt the butter and continue stirring for 3 minutes until it is light brown in color. Then continue.

i have a better tip...instead of butter, which is unhealthy, use olive oil. just enough to lightly coat the asparagus, season with Kosher salt and black pepper, toss to evenly season. Must serve right after they are done, otherwise they shrink if you wait to long to eat them. trust me, you will love them with olive oil!

Wonderful! Even with all the great reviews I had a hard time imagining these flavors together.  However when I needed to fix asparagus for the 3rd time in a week (I had bought too much on sale) I tried it. It is nothing like I would have expected. After reading the suggestions to change the proportions of balsamic versa soy sauce, I decided to use equal amounts of each. Next time I will try reversing the amounts called for in the recipe as I would like a little more of that sweet and tart balsamic vinegar taste. I did use an extremely smooth, 10 year old balsamic. I can't wait to try this on other vegetables. My husband suggested Brussel sprouts. I think I would steam a bit and then lightly sauté in the butter. Julienned zucchini sautéed in the butter would probably be good too. Thanks for a great recipe and so many possibilities.

This recipe is just like the Cooking Light recipe.  It is fantastic.  Be sure to brown the butter though - it gives it a nutty flavor.  Who ever would have thought to bake asparagus?  You'll never boil it again after eating it this way!

I've always baked my Asparagus but this new variation is excellent.  I did reduce the soy sauce but also added a soft roasted garlic clove to the butter sauce...WOW.  I have also done this recipe with Asparagus & split carrots.

I have never like asparagus, until this recipe.  My kids even ate it (pre soy and balsalmic sauce).  This was fantastic. I recommend cooking 15 minutes and definately charing the butter, double the balsamic and half the soy.

I swap the quantities of the balsamic vinegar and the soy sauce and it's perfect every time! I served it at Christmas for my family, whom were never introduced to asparagus, and it was a hit. Since then it has become a staple side dish in my household. Love, love, love it!

WOW!!! I love it. So simple, so good. I have used this with frozen asparagus spears, too - simply microwave for a minute or two until no longer frozen, then drain/pat dry and finish in the oven as teh recipe states. The sauce is so wonderful and would be great with any veggie - green beans, even corn, and is fantastic drizzled over chicken and fish. I've even cut the butter to 1 tablespoon, and it's still delicious. This is a new staple in my home. Thank you for the recipe.

I have not made this recipe yet but just stumbled across it. This sounds just like an appetizer at a very expensive Italian restaurant down the street. They grill the asparagus and drizzle it with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The thing that makes it really yummy and sinful is they sprinkle it with gorgonzola cheese and pine nuts. Absolutely tasty! I cant wait to try this version myself. I hope this helps anyone else who is trying this recipe.

I made this exactly as the recipe and it was excellent! I was skeptical of soy sauce and balsamic vinegar (I love both, just wasn't sure about them together) and was very pleasantly surprised. Really good!

I really like these.  I was about the only one though in my family.  My husband couldn't eat more than one bite, he felt the flavor was too overpowering.  I did like them though, and since I'm much more open to a variety of foods than my husband is, they still got a 4 star.  Oh, and yes, I made the recipe as states.

Several years ago, I clipped this recipe from Cooking Light and it is always a family favorite.  This sauce can also be used on broccoli.  We like to toss asparagus with olive oil, wrap in foil and toss foil packet on grill.  I make sauce on stove and pour over veggies when done on grill.  Soooo good.

This was really, really good. I have always thought balsamic vinegar was overrated...but I followed suggestions of browning the butter, a 3:1 ratio of balsamic and soy and making extra sauce. And it was fantastic. I baked mushrooms and peppers with the asparagus and I served it with pan fried chicken breasts and white rice.

This is one of our favorites in our house!! This is how I cooked asparagus the first time and I am afraid to try it any other way now.  My oldest daughter will sneak back to the kitchen and eat leftovers right out of the pan.  Hardly ever do we have enough left to save.  My boyfriend didn't think he liked asparagus, but he also says this is one of his favorites. The only thing I do different is use 1 Tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.

This is delicious!  After reading other reviews, I decided to use 2Tbs basalmic vinegar and 1 Tbs soy sauce because I love vinegar.  My fiance liked it so much he drank the leftover sauce :)

very very yummy! my friend told me about this recipe, and i made it to bring to easter and i made the recipe times four, i was making four bundles.  and it turned out great!  everyone thought it was a good change from plain old asparagus.  my grandma whom is an excellent cook loved it and wanted the recipe.  i used real butter instead of cooking spray on the cookie sheet.  make sure you cook it to be alittle crispy, keep checking on it though it can burn fast, but you dont want them soggy....

This was absolutely delicious. I loved the balsamic/soy mix. I did as others suggested and browned the butter before adding the vinegar and soy sauce. Also seasoned the asparagus with sea salt and not the pepper. Will definitely make again.

FAVORITE way to make asparagus!!!  I always brown the butter a bit, thanks to previous reviews, and switch the amt's of vinegar and soy.  Use kosher salt for extra flavor and fresh ground pepper!!  AWESOME flavor!

This was really good but not amazing. You definitely need to switch the amounts of soy sauce and balsamic. I sliced up a little clove of garlic and sauteed it in the butter. I tasted it after it was finished and it was good but a little boring, so I added some sliced almonds and I liked it more - just a bit more interesting. I'll make it again - it's a good side dish.

SO good. I used unsalted butter and kosher salt and always. I also baked with two red peppers sliced into strips to add color, but added an excellent flavor!

This is a keeper for me with modifications suggested by other reviewers to use 1 tsp soy sauce and 1/2 tsp balsamic.  I also melted the butter in the microwave as it was easier and faster than the saucepan.

I brushed the asparagus with olive oil and decreased the balsamic vinegar to 2tsp. Scrumptious! Also tasted great on my accompanying steak.

Only cooked the asparagus for 10 minutes so it still had some crunch. Added more balsamic vinegar to the sauce as others recommended, made extra, and it was all gone by the end of the meal. Easy to make for a crowd. Will be trying the sauce for other things, like brussels sprouts and green beans.

I don't like asparagus, but for Easter, I knew people would, so I tried this.  Yowza!  Now I love it!  (but only cooked like this :-) ). And even the asparagus lovers in the group liked this even better than their usual fare. Thanks for the recipe.

This is amazing!!! I added a bit of garlic powder, lemon pepper & used rice vinegar as I had no balsamic vinegar. It turned out as an amazing side dish for spaghetti night! I added a pic also!

Very good asparagus! I agree with those that switch quantities of soy and balsamic. I added a couple cloves of garlic and a shake of red pepper flakes to my butter. They added a bit more dimension to the flavors. This is a frequent flier at our house!

Keeper!  I rarely review things with a perfect score, but for the simplicity of this recipe and resulting flavor, this recipe is definitely worthy of the five stars.  I like roasting vegetables with olive oil and s&p, so I wasn't sure what to expect this time.  The balsamic and soy sauce add that extra punch that gives this simple dish the wow factor.  In fact, that was literally the reaction I got tonight.  "WOW, what'd you do different?"    

Made just a couple of minor changes:
- I did not use cooking spray (not an item I have in the pantry).  Instead, I lightly drizzled the asparagus with evoo and tossed, prior to baking.
-I melted the butter in a small dish in the microwave, not a pan.

'm trying to understand the reviews on this one. Not to be rude but these flavors just didn't blend well together for our family. It was easy but the soy was too overpowering. 
The Asparagus was cooked nicely so 1 star for that.

AWESOME!  I have to admit, I went into this a little skeptical.  We LOVE roasted asparagus w/just a drizzle of EVOO and some sea salt.  I was concerned this would "muddy up" a good thing.  Oh how wrong I was!  This is excellent w/just a subtle extra flavor from the butter/soy/balsamic.  Mr. LTH is NOT a vinegar fan, but he did not comment on its presence, so it must have been quite mild.  I thoroughly enjoyed this and will be using this preparation method for asparagus as my go to in the future.  One small "tweak"...I baked at 425 as that was the temperature the seasoned oven fries required.  THANK YOU, CAE!

I wish I could give this six stars. I had friends over for a barbeque last night, and decided to use this recipe. After reading the reviews, I made sure to brown the butter, then added equal parts balsamic, and soy sauce. Everyone I dare say raved. A big thank you goes to Cae, for a wonderful recipe.

This is the only way I serve asparagus now.  As others have suggested, I switched the amounts of the vinegar and soy sauce, using one tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and a teaspoon of soy sauce.  It's excellent, and so easy.  Makes an elegant side dish for any dinner.  Received rave reviews and recipe requests from my guests.  Thanks!

We didn't care for this sauce at all...I was a little concerned about so much more soy than balsamic vinegar and I was right...the soy overwhelmed the balsamic. Sorry, won't be making this again.

You can never go wrong with baked asparagus!  This was easy and fun to make.  I tripled the recipe since I had two huge bundles of asparagus.  The one touch that I added to the recipe was 1 tablespoon of honey mixed in the with butter, soy sauce, and balsamic vinegar sauce.  The honey added a pleasant contrast to the other ingrediants.

WONDERFUL! I'm only giving this four stars because I had to modify slightly.  I doubled the recipe, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly - until I tasted it.  Then I added more balsamic (basically double what the recipe calls for) and added a splash of lemon juice.  After that, it was perfect! Flavorful and bright.  Will definitely make this again.

Wow, this was fabulous and super easy!  I did brown the butter first as other reviewers suggested.  I also just realized that I read the recipe wrong and added one tablespoon of both the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar.  I think I'll continue to do this, it seemed to be a good mistake!  Excellent flavor.  I will use this recipe a ton and try it on other veggies as well.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I really liked the flavor of this sauce.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and 1)cooked in toaster oven, 2) 1 teaspoon of soy sauce, 3) 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, and 4) most importantly BROWNED the butter (it adds maybe 90 seconds more to your cooking time, but it is the "make or break" ingredient in this recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I would not change a thing and is great paired with just about anything!  I am going to try what other users have recommend and use it with green beans and other vegetables!

This was so good, and so easy.  It even works on cold left over asparagus.    Yummy!

"The" recipe for asparagus!! Nothing else compares. My wife and I have been eating asparagus for many years just using a little olive oil,garlic salt with Parm cheese.We like it, but those days are long gone. This recipe takes to a whole nother level of deliciousness.

Try adding shredded parmesan after pouring the sauce. It adds more taste and surely makes them even more amazing.

I followed the instructions of the recipe exactly and didn't like the result that much. The mix of balsamic, soy sauce, and butter just didn't blend well with the taste of asparagus.If I were to do this recipe again I would skip the soy sauce altogether.

Very good but didn't get too much balsamic flavour... Might have to play with the recipe a little more, the steps to roast the asparagus were perfect.

Sauce was delicious.  Did flip flop amounts of soy and vinegar as others suggested.  But I'm not a big asparagus fan and it was still too asparagusy for me.   Just trying to find a recipe for this veg that I like

I have to rate this a 5-star!  I usually make my asparagus steamed, sauted and roasted in the oven with drizzled evoo.  But, I think this is my new best way to prepare asparagus.  I did follow other's suggestions and flipped the measurements and used 1 t. soy sauce and 1 T. balsamic vinegar.  I also slightly burned the butter as suggested by many other reviewers.  So good!  Roasting brings out a wonderful flavor to the asparagus that steaming and sauteing just can't do.  So good!

My new favorite asparagus recipe! I did not want to dirt another sauce pan so I melted the butter in the microwave in a serving dish and added the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar and then tossed in the asparagus.

I use the basalmic butter sauce all the time, even goes wonderful over stak.  Even though we may not be having the asparagus, I might just make the butter glaze by itself to top something else.

Delish. Drizzled the spears with EVOO instead of cooking spray. Switched the amounts of soy and balsamic. Served with steak that was topped with "Devil's Steak Sauce" from AR.

I normally don't like asparagus but this was a great recipe, we didn't have butter on hand, so we used I can't believe it's not butter.  We also add somed chopped garlic, and it was delicious.

This was a good recipe, but I like my asparagus with a little more crunch. I will probably cook just a little longer next time.

excellent flavor although I had to double the butter, soy sauce and vinegar mixture.  It took about 20 minutes of baking time for the asparagus to be tender.  I will be making this recipe again...yummy.

Turned out quite tastey. I added more balsamic than soy sauce in my recipe. I think next time, I'll add even more of the two than what this recipe called for. Thanks

I also thought this needed to be cooked longer. I gave it 10 more mins and it needed more than that but the rest of the meal was ready. I also didnt find anything special about the sauce. I am new to asparagus so I just might try this one again maybe steaming it? Not sure yet.

Really liked the sauce, very easy and the soy sauce gave it an Asian flair. The asparagus should be cooked longer in my opinion. Maybe it was the asparagus, but very stalky. Will try it again as it was super simple. Will cook a litttle longer next time.

This sauce is so simple and easy to make and very tasty as well!  We normally just use a bit of mayo but this sauce makes the Asparagus to much tastier! A definite keeper indeed!  YUM!

I made this, and when I tasted the sauce I was a bit reluctant to serve it.  So I sent the asparagus out with no sauce.  While I was getting ready to serve the next course, I dipped a little asparagus in the sauce and OMG....So yummy!  It's a great balance of flavors, and I have added it again to the menu next month.

Yum!  I'm going to only bake asparagus from now on - it literally melts in your mouth!

I sort of left out the soy sauce... and  the balsamic vinegar... so yeah.  Just butter sauce for us. :)

This recipe gets 10 stars for the Balsamic Butter Sauce.  My husband didn’t like Brussels Sprouts until I roasted them and tossed them with this sauce.  Our favorite Green Bean recipe is to fry them in a Wok and toss them with this sauce.  Oh – it’s also good on Asparagus!  :-)

Tried this for our family dinner of 10 - was very fast and a huge hit.  As suggested in previous reviews I doubled the balsamic vinegar.  I have also tried this with a lovely pomegranate balsamic that I bought very lovely taste.

Delicious.  Where has this sauce been all my life?  I will put this sauce on virtually everything from now on.  I thought to myself, over 1000 reviews and bazillions of downloads, how can anything so simple be that good?  Well it is.

Alterations: Doubled the sauces and changed soy to balsamic ratio to 1 soy to 2 balsamic. Cut the butter down to reduce the fat too. Yummy!

This is the best asparagus ever!  I've been making it for a year or so now and can't get enough.  Recently, I started spraying a little olive oil on my George Foreman grill and cooking the asparagus there for about 5 minutes then drizzling the sauce on top. DELICIOUS and Oh So EASY!

This was a tasty, easy recipe. My husband & I both liked it and I will definitely make it again. I used 1 tbsp soy sauce & 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar, after I had read the reviews. It tasted great this way. DELICIOUS!

This is the best way to enjoy asparagus. But remember, the asparagus must still have a crunch to it. Soggy and limp is a no-no. Instead of cooking spray, I drizzle extra virgin olive oil on the asparagus. Also use good balsamic vinegar not the cheap stuff you buy in the supermarket. I sprinkle fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top right before serving. My family can't get enough of this dish, there's never any left.

Instead of cooking spray (ewww!) we brushed the asparagus with olive oil.  Per some suggestions we also browned the butter.  The rest of the recipe we followed exactly.  I thought the cooking time could have been reduced by a minute or two, but we like our vegetables crisp and fresh tasting, not mushy.  Even so, it was delicious!  A five star recipe.

I made this tonight. It was good. I did add I think too much butter, but that was my fault. Also, watch the time! 12 minutes was too long and the asparagus was over cooked. (and i like mine very soft) .. so, overall good taste, and i'll make again, just wont bake as long. oh, and i subbed red wine vinegar, because i didnt have balsamic.

This tasted great, but even better it's perfect for a busy cook to time everything for serving.  The toaster oven is a fabulous option while other appliances are all in use.  The butter can be browned & mixed with soy & balsamic in advance.  I even warmed my rolls by setting them on top of the toaster oven throughout preheating & baking.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good sauce! It complimented the asparagas deliciously, and In My Opinion, would work for green beans too. I also liked that I could bake in oven as I used the stove top to cook the rest of dinner. The only thing I changed was I used my serving dish to bake in:that dirtied (1) less dish, instead of a single layer on a baking sheet. Timing was perfect at 12 minutes, done that way. When I make asparagas as a side, will do this way again. Great recipe!

Wow was this great!!  I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  The only thing I did a little different like some other reviewers was to brown the butter and added just a bit of dijon mustard.  Wonderful!!!  Sister-in-law loved it so much she asked me for the recipe so she could make it for a dinner party. I also made this the other night and will keep it in my repertoire........

This was great!  It was the perfect texture for asparagus...nice and crispy.  I made it with Easter dinner and even the non asparagus people liked it.  The rest of us, the asparagus people, loved it. Thanks!

This is just wonderful on all kinds of veggies. I have tried it on asparagus, pea pods, and broccoli.  All were just fabulous!! I had to convince all those veggie haters to just try one piece, and that's all it took- no more convincing necessary.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful!  I did switch the mesurements of the soy sauce and balsamic.  And Sauted in stead of baked.  Perfect!  I finally found the asparagus recipe I've been looking for.  Thanks!

Exceptional!  Perfect with our roast Easter lamb!  Could double sauce, if desired - It doesn't make much; but the sauce does have a punch and you don't need much to add an incredible flavor to the asparagus.  A MUST make!

phew! I'm glad I found this recipe. my sister was supposed to get green beans at the store but got asparagus instead since it was on sale, and I was really worried because I've never made asparagus before, but it was a huge hit with my family! incredibly easy, too. I took other reviewers advice and swapped the amounts of soy sauce and vinegar (though I might just use equal amounts in the future, as I'm not a big fan of vinegar), browned the butter, and sprinkled with kosher salt before baking... so good.

Great recipe! Thanks for the gem. I didn't use butter I used Olive oil instead, but I didn't heat it to the point of smoking (it is bad for you). Only warmed it slightly.

This is delicious!! I will NEVER make asparagus another way!! The sauce is the perfect compliment - double it if you want... and don't make it until just before the asparagus are ready to be taken out of the oven. thanks for the recipe!

this recipe originally appeared in cooking light a few years ago... a yummy favorite- when the butter starts to smell "nutty" and it might even have some dark specks, the butter is then ready!  this tastes great with green beans as well.

This was excellent!  The second time I made it I used olive oil instead of cooking spray and thought it was a little more flavorful.  It is also good with sesame oil and sesame seeds sprinked on top after cooking.

We all loved this asparagus. I followed the advice of others and made sure to brown the butter. I goofed and added 1 Tbsp instead of 1 tsp of balsamic vinegar, but didn't notice my error until later, after we'd all devoured the yummy spears and sauce. I also chose to coat the spears w/a bit of olive oil, rather than cooking spray, before baking (line pan w/non-stick foil for easy cleanup).The cooking time/temp was exactly right. Not too done, bright green, non-slimy asparagus. Even my 5-year old daughter, who has never liked asparagus, loved it dipped in the flavorful sauce. This will definitely be our favorite way to cook asparagus.

Followed other reviewers hint to brown the butter slightly.  Used 1 tsp. soy sauce and 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar.  We liked this.  However, when I took some of the sauce and whisked it until it was emulsified and poured it over the asparagus we loved it.  By emulsifying it all the flavors combined beautifully.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Have not tried this yet but from the reviews I've read it sounds delish!  I too am going to try with green beans that I will steam.  I'm also going to try with some crisp bacon chopped up and added at the end.  Then toss all ingredients at the end to coat bacon and beans. We'll give it a shot.  If it doesn't taste right with the bacon I'll know for next time.

Quick and easy side dish! I might try to let the asparagus sit in the soy/balsamic sauce longer though, to bring out more flavor. I poured sauce over leftovers and next day the flavor was perfect...but I wouldn't want to cook them in the sauce b/c they'll get soft and the thing my fam liked best was the crisp to tender ratio. That said, my hubby said this was the best asparagus he's ever had, which is pretty good considering he "critiques" everything I make and isn't afraid to tell me if it's bad! hahaha

I only rated 4 stars because the recipe is good, it's my cooking that's not! I followed the suggested tweaking of less soy sauce to more balsamic, I also added lemon pepper.

This was very easy to make for a beginning cook! The asparagus was tender, and I really loved the light flavor. The only suggestion I have is watch how much salt/pepper you put on. Since the recipe said to add to taste I may have gone a little overboard with the salt. It was too much for me, but my Husband loved it. Thanks for such an easy and great recipe!

Excellent!  Wouldn't change a thing, other than maybe decreasing the butter slightly just to make it a little healthier.

I made this twice.  Once with melting the butter in the microwave and adding the ingredients (it was a meal timing thing) and once with browning the butter in the sauce pan.  My family prefered the microwaved preparation best.  Either way it was tasty.

I will have to say I changed the recipe.  I cut up bacon and put in skillet then added mushrooms.  I cooked until the bacon was crisp and the mushrooms were cooked down. Then I drained the bacon and mushrooms on a paper towel.  After draining the bacon and mushrooms added them back to pan and used recipe above.  I poured the bacon and mushroom sauce over the asparagus to cook.  can I say this is amazing and my husband doesn't care if we eat it multiple times in a week.  Supper easy too.

Had to find a last minute way to make fresh asparagus and found this awesome recipe and it was so easy! I went with the recommendation to swap the amounts of soy sauce and balsamic and it tasted great.

5 star recipe with 1 minor change mentioned by many other reviewers so I too followed their recommendation and agree (why I rated it a 4-star as written, but it's a DEFINITE 5-star with this 1 simple change)...reverse the soy sauce & balsamic vinegar amounts = 1Tbsp Balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp. soy sauce and it's a perfect 10!

I loved this recipe. However, my husband was not a big fan. He said he likes his asparagus more crunchy the way they are when I just steam them. So if you don't like really soft asparagus, them lessen the cooking time or try a different recipe.

Loved this super simple, yet sophistocated side.  I served with filet of beef, perfect accompanyment.  I made as directed, but tossed the asparagus with EVOO.  I also placed the butter, vinegar, and teriyaki sauce in the micro and VIOLA!, sauce.  Will use this recipe many times, thank you for sharing with AR.

Very good recipe, BUT switch the measurements on the soy & balsamic (1 tsp soy to 1 TBSP balsamic) or it's Baked Asparagus with Soy Butter Sauce. Definitely brown the butter or margarine (just cook over med-hi heat and stir constantly until your arm falls off & it browns slightly). Also, double the sauce as it's delish!

Made this for dinner tonight and we really liked it.  I did as others suggested and used 1 tsp. of the soy sauce and 1 tbsp. of balsamic vinegar.  I don't usually like vinegar so I wasn't sure if I'd like this, but I tried it anyway just to try something different and found that it wasn't too vinegary at all.  It was a good balance.  Thanks for sharing CAE!

Asparagus is an absolute favorite vegetable.  This is wonderful - simple, light and flavorful.  Definately will make again.  Instead of cooking spray I did use a light toss in olive oil.

This was pretty good, but to me the sauce really did not add much... besides calories. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because it is a great way of preparing asparagus. Next time I will use olive oil instead of cooking spray, add garlic then season with salt and pepper and toss before placing into the oven.

I really liked this recipe. I usually just steam my asparagus and a a little butter and salt, so even though there's not much to this it was just what I was looking for. Plus it was super easy to make.

We really loved this. Browning the butter gave it a real caramel-y flavor. I added the vinegar and soy sauce and let it thicken a bit while stirring continuously. Delicious!

The sauce is a beautiful mixture of flavers!

I changed the cooking method, because I wanted the asparagus to have a chance to absorb more of the sauce's flavor. So I melted the butter in a saucepan, made the sauce, and then sauteed the asparagus in it.

I will definitely make this dish again, and I hope to find other uses for this delicious sauce!

I thought this tasted pretty good. My asparagus was thin and I still had to add 3-4 minutes extra to the baking time. Still, it was easy to throw together. To save time cleaning extra pans I just microwaved the butter and lined the baking pan with foil. Only change I made to the recipe was using low-sodium soy sauce for personal preference. Thank you, was good today with dinner.

I love this recipe. I wanted the sauce go further and I didn't want to add more butter, so I added 1/8 cup chicken broth and 1/8 cup water. Then I thickened it with a rue. It came out AMAZING! This is going to be a regular.

This is a phenomenal recipe! It's my go-to asparagus recipe. I made it as a side at the first meal I made for my in-laws...and even though they teased me about how much I was making (I made a double recipe, knowing how much they, my husband, and myself LOVE asparagus), but there was nothing left over. :)
So delicious.

Not sure why I didn't like this more.  I tasted the sauce before putting it on the asparagus and thought it was amazing.  A few minutes later at supper, I didn't really care for it with the asparagus.

It was delicious! I also used 2 tbsp balsamic, to 1 tbsp soy sauce, and found this absolutely wonderful. And perfect for the summer months because it is so light! I mentioned that one reviewer had said it tastes great on steak, and so he tried a piece in the sauce. Needless to say he has requested that I make this sauce every time he has a steak! He also isn't a big veggie lover, but the asparagus was definitely a hit! Will make over and over again!

Great recipe.  Neither the balsamic vinegar or soy sauce flavors are too strong, they work together very well.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly and got rave reviews from friends and family.

This was very good. Make sure you use the right measurements - too much sauce on too little asparagus can overpower the dish.

This is just absolutely fabulous!  I like asparagus, not love asparagus.  This recipe made me get my fork out and dig into the few that were left.  I did switch the soy and vinegar amts-T vinegar, t soy. Also I used kosher salt and it added a nice cruch. So very yummy. I like another reviewers idea of using sauce on salmon. (I also like the skinniest asparagus I can find)

I've always steamed asparagus.  This is the first time I've baked it, and it was cooked perfectly.  This is so easy that I know the asparagus will be going into the oven in the future even if I don't use this recipe's sauce.  Tasty side dish.

This recipe was just OK.  I thought the sauce flavors were really strong and masked the flavor of the asparagus.

This recipe was sooooo good.  I finally asked my husband if he had enough so I could finish the rest. The tips of the spears almost had a nutty taste which was different from the rest of the spear.  Try this just once and you will have this on your menu many times to come.

This is a great recipe.  A perfect balance of sweet, salty, and sour with the crisp freshness of asparagus.  This is my new favorite recipe for asparagus.

I liked baking the asparagus better than the sauce. It wasn't too bad but I wouldn't want it all the time.

This is an easy and excellant side. I made it for a dinner party that included a lobster bisque, this came in 2nd fav for the night. all any well stocked kitchen will have to add is fresh asparagus. The thinner is better.

I wasn't overly impressed with this recipe.  I did enjoy the asparagus, but I think next time I will take others suggestions and do more balsamic vinegar.  All in all, it was my first time, so there is certainly room for improvement.

I also cut the asparagus into 1" pieces and tossed them with a tiny bit of olive oil, salt and pepper before roasting for 15 minutes.  Brown the butter; Mix with soy and balsamic and toss all together.  This is the BEST asparagus - Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This was awesome!  I read the reviews and added additional balsamic to it as well.  I also drizzled olive oil on the asparagus prior to baking.  My boyfriend, who does not typically like asparagus, had a second helping.

Sorry, but these were a bomb at Christmas dinner.  I guess you have to really like soy sauce to appreciate this recipe.

OK, I tried this again and after cutting soy sauce to 1 t. and increasing balsamic vinegar to 1 1/2 T, it was much better.  I made mine in my toaster oven since I didn't have a large amount of asparagus.

I don't understand why this recipe got such good reviews. I made it exactly and it didn't taste disgusting or anything, but it definitely wasn't as good as asparagus with just butter, salt, and pepper. It just tasted like soy sauce.

I saw this recipe years ago and make it whenever I can. Absolutely delicious! I usually double the sauce and brush it on the asparagus after baking instead of pouring it over. It seems to me like the sauce soaks in much better this way making a very flavorful dish!

For me the balsamic taste was a bit too strong but my husband thought it was perfect.  A great twist on aparagus!  This was the first time we baked asparagus and they were cooked to perfection.

This is fabulous! This went over so well at our Easter dinner. I used 2 bunches of aspargus, doubled the sauce and instead of using cooking spray I used a tablespoon or two of olive oil. I roasted for about 20 minutes instead of 12, personal preference, I wanted this to be more tender and not have the "bite" to it. The balsamic butter sauce is delicious, something so simple could turn asparagus into something so elegant and wonderful! I will use this recipe again for sure, thank you :)

Made this for Easter dinner at my MIL's (Mother-in-law's) and it was a big hit!  Drizzled with olive oil rather than using cooking spray. Doubled the veggies by doing both asparagus and green beans (same temp and cook time) and tripled the sauce.  Scattered fresh crushed garlic around the veggies for the entire cooking time and added the sauce to the cookie sheet 3 minutes before the cooking time ended to meld the flavours.  Also followed everyone's advice about switching the portions of soy sauce and balsamic vinegar.  Also ommited the salt and pepper, used unsalted butter and low-sodium soy sauce to make it extra healthy.  At a table of 8 people, 7 loved the veggies and only my man's very elderly grandmother wasn't a fan but she grabbed only the beans thinking they were asparagus so I'm not sure if her opinion should effect the rating!  Oh and the leftover sauce in the bottom of the dish made AMAZING dip for fresh whole wheat baguette!! I'll definitely be making this again!!

This is a good recipe though I think I feel like roast asparagus itself is delicious and I was interested to see how the sauce would add to that.  It definitely does, I like the balsamic and soy sauce combination (I use reduced sodium soy sauce) but it didn't blow my mind or anything.  But it was very nice.  I think the sauce could also be drizzled over most proteins successfully.

We have been making a version of this recipe for a couple of years.  We don't bake the asparagus we just steam it (even in those new steamer bags for the microwave) and pour the sauce over.  We have used this balsamic butter for a variety of things, steak, potatoes,etc.. Try it on other things and see what you prefer.  It's awesome!

Amazing. I was SOOO dreading typical asparagus recipes with just butter or a squeeze of lemon juice or parm cheese, etc. I am now SOOOOOOO happy I found this recipe! Wow! It has such rich flavors--between roasting and adding the flavorful sauce--it really takes on a great flavor that I really enjoy. It could easily be an impressive side dish, or as others have said, great with steak.  UPDATE: Yup, I still love this recipe =)

This was easy, but it did not suit my tastes. It seemed too bitter, which may be from the balsamic I used (it wasn't the "approved" kind from Italy). However, my guests enjoyed it, but they didn't rave either.

This is the first recipe from this site that I did not care for. Three of us did not care for the taste but one did. I feel every one's taste buds are different. I thought I would like it because I love balsamic vinegar dressing on my salads, but I would not make this recipe again. I did follow the recipe.

Asparagus is my favorite vegetable and I am always trying new ways to prepare it. This is probably my new favorite.

I can't believe the combo of these three simple ingredients, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce and butter, can create such an amazing tasting sauce! To thicken it up, sprinkle a little flour or cornstarch. This recipe will stay in my recipe box for life. Thank you!!

I made this for a dinner party and it received high praises, I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and browned the butter and I also strained the butter solids before adding the vinegar and soy sauce.  It was great!

This balsamic butter sauce is one of the easiest and yummiest drizzles I've come across. Forget what other reviewers said about switching the soy and balsamic proportions--follow this exactly and you will not be disappointed. NOTE: when sauteing butter, must allow to brown before adding remaining two ingredients. Very important step in achieving the desired taste you want. VERY YUMMY!

This recipe was tasty, but I enjoyed the baked asparagus more without the butter sauce. I switched the amounts of soy sauce and vinegar as suggested.

I liked this dish very much, I browned the butter then added the balsamic (no soy used) I poured over asparagus, let sit out at room temp all day, put in oven 10 minutes b4 serving just to melt the butter back up.Good veggie side dish to prepare ahead of time. Have made several times always get compliments.

Nice idea but the dish was way too salty for our tastes. The asparagus turned out wonderful baked; I used very thin stalks so they weren't chewy. Next time I'll drizzle them with real butter and bake. Thanks for posting; I guess my tastes aren't normal!

I love this recipe!  I would flip-flop the amounts of balsamic vinegar (which I love) and soy sauce (which is ok).  Also, I browned the butter and sauteed sliced almonds to top the asparagus.  Lovely!

I use this same oven roasting technique with fresh green beans, and they always turn out awesome.  We made these with some baked salmon, and prepared the sauce using some slivered shallots with the butter.  It was very good, thanks!

I am used to roasting Asparagus with crushed garlic and olive oil. The balsamic took away from the natural flavor of the Asparagus. Just didn't do it for us, sorry.

This is a terrific side dish.  Instead of the salt, you can add oregano or fines herbes for a delicious and more healthful flavour.  
It's so easy to do this dish since it can be prepared ahead of time and popped in the oven when you're ready for it.

Oh my gosh, this recipe is so good.  I made this for a family dinner and everyone loved it.  I took the suggestions of others and sprinkled kosher salt on the asparagus before cooking.  I also switched the amounts of soy and vinegar - I have to admit I kept doing a "pinky" taste test and adjusted the amounts to my liking.  Not sure exactly how much of each I ended up with.  These were even better reheated the next day and I even enjoyed a few cold.  I'll definitely be making this again.

My boyfriend said he never wants to eat any other vegetables again besides this recipe. We made twice the sauce, and were certain to brown the butter slightly. We didn't have cooking spray so we drizzled some olive oil on the asparagus and rolled to coat them before baking - I don't know if this makes it easier to avoid over-baking the asparagus? But it was GREAT. We couldn't stop eating these till they were gone.

The only way to do asparagus now.  I also alternate the amounts of balsamic and soy (mostly because I love balsamic) and it works great.

I followed directions directly as written, my husband loved these, he even said he wished there was more when they were all gone.  I thought they were pretty good, I guess my favorite us still just steamed with sauce over them.

Wow I just made this for dinner, and it was the BEST asparagus I've ever had. I am trying to watch calories, so this was perfect.(and better than hollandaise)I used a little less butter, only a half tbsp of both sauces, and left out the pepper.Beautiful.

I was craving asparagus one day and found this recipe. Love the Balsamic-Soy Sauce combination. I had never heard or thought of it before. 
The only problem with the recipe I found was that I ended up with too much of the Balsamic Butter Sauce. I will cut that down in half next time. Also, I don't think it's necessary to salt the asparagus before baking. I found the result a bit too salty for my taste as the soy sauce adds enough salt to carry the recipe. 
Thanks for the tasty recipe!

This was really good. Since I like balsamic vinegar just a little more than soy sauce, I did as some others suggested and used 1t of soy sauce and 1T of vinegar.  Super easy, and sooooooooooo yummy.

One of our favorites!  For even more flavor, allow time for the asparagus to rest for a few minutes in the sauce.  Delicious, even with lite soy sauce!

This recipe was grotesque. Butter was a bad idea from the start. It provided an incredibly unappealing smell and taste. Then the soy sauce, which just made it incredibly salty. The only good thing about it was the balsamic vinegar (something I happen to love). I tried modifying it by replacing butter with olive oil and reducing soy sauce content but the only results were gross or bland.

I'm learning how to prepare asparagus so when I ran across this recipe I decided to give it a try.  I read several reviews and landed on these modifications: sprinkle with garlic pepper, brown the melted butter, double the balsamic vinegar.  It tasted great when it was done, but the next day the leftovers seemed to have soaked up the butter and it was too much.  I'll try it again but cut back on the amount of butter next time.

I loved this recipe! I read a lot of reviews that said to swap the measurements for the soy sauce and vinegar. I started to do that and then changed my mind, since I really like both. I'm not exactly sure how much I put in of each, but it was great. I had some brocolli that needed to be used, so I added it to the pan, as welL and it was very good, too. My husband actually ate some and he never likes how I fix asparagus. I can't wait to make this again.

Delicious and creative way to enjoy asparagus, even for those aren't crazy about asparagus.  I follow other reviewers suggestions and swapped the ratios of soy sauce to balsamic.  Also broiled in my toaster oven to cut down heat in the kitchen.  Turned out fabulously!

A delicious way to prepare asparagus!  I enjoyed this recipe throughout the entire spring growing season.  Like other reviewers, I used even amounts of soy and balsamic (1 TBS), because I'm a big fan of balsamic vinegar (used low-sodium soy).  I've tried every other method of preparing asparagus -- grilling, pan-fraying, sauteeing, steaming -- and baking as described here is definitely the best.  The sauce is a wonderful bonus.

I love asparagus but my husband hates it.  I made this recipe and he was floored-  he even asked for seconds.  I cut then peeled the base of the asparagus with a veggie peeler to make it more tender.  I also added a bit of parmesan cheese.  I will definitely make this again.

Loved it!  I followed other viewers suggestions and used 1 tablespoon of Balsamic Vinegar and 1 teaspoon of soy sauce.  I thought it was perfect.  I like vinegar but I am not sure what others would think if they didn't like vinegar.  Next time I might try the recipe as it is written or try even amounts of balsamic and soy sauce.  Overall I thought it was very good though and was a good way to add a little zing to the asparagus.

Quick and easy. Although I think that it was too buttery. I think it could be cut in half.

Oh my goodness - this was incredible! At first I thought it would be a weird combination of soy with the balsamic but it wasn't weird at all. I think the soy tempered the tang of the vinegar. I did use more balsamic than soy (personal preference) and I did brown the butter as suggested in many other reviews. The 12 minutes suggested was perfect - they weren't mushy and still had some bite. They presented beautifully and my guests raved. I doubled the sauce too and am glad I did because we had some homemade bread and we all enjoyed "sopping"! This one goes in the permanent recipe box!

Parboiled the asparagus first.  Followed the recipe without any additions or substitution.  I didn't find this to be anything fantastic.

well, I must have missed something.  I found the soy sauce totally salty and overwhelming - I even used lite.  I followed it precisely too. Won't be trying this again.

I've been looking for a healthy, easy way to make asparagus for a while. This recipe hit the nail on the head! My husband and I both love it, and it's definately going in my recipe box of favorites! I added a full tablespoon of balsamic vinegar for a little extra kick.

Loved this. I just steamed the asparagus in the microwave for a few minutes and then added some margarine and the soy sauce and vinegar. Made it a lot easier and the taste was fabulous!

OMG - I purposely went out of my way to find something I hated Asparagus to see if there was a recipie that would get me to enjoy since I want to add healthier things to our diet.  Asparagus, Welcome to our house thanks to this one!!!!  I did reverse the measurements for soy and vinegar and used Kosher salt. I do suggest using the Kosher salt and fresh pepper.

Made it last night--very good flavor.  My date was very pleased, as was I.  I paired it with the recipe for Grilled Salmon I, but since I don't have a grill I baked the salmon.  Threw some Rice-A-Roni in there and it was a very tasty and easy meal.

I'm surprised this recipe has so many rave reviews.  I thought it was okay but nothing special.  The sauce is decent but nothing I'd want to make time and time again - too plain, really.  I'd prefer either plain asparagus or the Drunken Grilled Asparagus from this site.

Excellent recipe! So simple, yet it really made the meal. I likewise used 1 tbs balsamic vinegar, and 1 tsp of soy sauce.

I'm not a big asparagus fan, and yet my husband and me were fighting over the last few. I will always cook asparagus like this from now on. One of my favorite recipes so far...

The first time I made this  I was not too wild about the soy s./balsamic v. combo. The second time I left out the soy sauce and looooved it. I also sprinkled over some parmesan cheese. This recipe is definitely going on my favorites list.

Very easy and a nice change for asparagus.  For the sauce - I preferred the flavor of equal amounts of soy and balsamic vinegar (bit more sweetness).

Thiss recipe was so super easy.  I fixed for Easter dinner with my in-laws and got nothing but compliments.  My mother-in-law begged for the recipe.  I pretty much followed the directions, but I did take the advice of others.  I switched the amounts of the balasmic and soy, and I omitted the salt altogether.  I also baked with sliced red bell pepper.  After adding the sauce, I sprinkled minced garlic and sesame seeds.  This one is a keeper.  It is great dish when you really want to impress.

If I could give it 10 stars, I would. What a HUGE HIT this was at dinner the other night. I also switched the soy and balsalmic amounts. I will make this again and again.

I ususally make a variation of this on the grill and this is just as good. Add rosemary,garlic or other earthy spices to your liking. Bake asparagus for about nine miutes rather than thirteen for bright green and crunchy spears.

Yummy!  We loved this - even my preschoolers.  I've only cooked asparagus once before, but this time was a real winner.  Next time, I'll try it on green beans and see how that works.  Thanks for something different!

I found this recipe very offending to my taste buds.  My fiance really liked it, but I couldn't even finish mine.  I read somewhere that some people are overly sensative to certain tastes so maybe that's why.  I don't think i'd make it again.

I didn't like this sauce at all. The vinegar and the soy sauce didn't compliment eachother very well, and I completely agree with the others that said it was MUCH too salty.

A tad salty but still very good.  I've made it twice - the second time I used a little more butter & a little less soy sauce.

I can't say too much about this one except that we won't be having it again.  I made one batch of sauce, and we hated it; the soy sauce made it so salty -- and I used the low-sodium version!  We thought it had some potential so we tried it again using half the soy sauce and double the balsamic vinegar.  Anyway, it was interesting.

Love asparagus and really love it with this sauce.  I doubled the sauce like always and should have tripled it.  My husband said as soon as he put the first bite in his mouth that this was the best sauce he's ever had!  Next time I'll make lots of sauce so he can spoon tons over the top!  I did add fresh garlic to the asparagus on the pan before baking to a crisp tender.

We have never had Asparagus before tonight.  I thought this was very tasty and really enjoyed it. I may have over-baked for a few minutes and that's where it went wrong.  My family prefers crisp veg's and these weren't crisp.  I will make these again, and I will be sure not to over-bake.

This dish is so easy and delicious! I've made it three times since Thanksgiving 2005 and have been asked for the recipe by several people every time I make it. My 21 year old nephew even loved it and he can't stand asparagus. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is wonderful!  But instead of baking the asparagus I grilled it and then put the butter, soy sauce and balsamic vinegar over the grilled asparagus.  It was so good I am feeding it to the entire family on Mother's Day.

Instead of using the cooking spray, I drizzled about 2 tablespoons olive oil over the asparagus (otherwise followed recipe exactly, allowing the butter to brown slightly as others suggested.)  Hubby and I loved it!!

A little too butter for my taste, but my parents really liked the buttery flavor.  Nevertheless, next time I will use olive oil instead.  Otherwise a very good dish.  The asparagus came out cripsy and green.

This was sooooo good! The flavor of the sauce went perfectly with the asparagus. I steamed the asparagus in the microwave instead of baking it (because we were short of time) and then poured the thickened sauce over it. We loved the sauce so much we also used it to dip our rosemary potatoes in. Next time I will try baking it, and I'm sure it will be fabulous that way too.

I actually used this flavorful  butter sauce on frozen mixed vegetables. I steamed the veges until almost tender then moved them into a sauce pan where I incorporated the butter  sauce. Very tasty (as a side to a thick pork chop) and can't  wait to try it on asparagus!

Like other reviewers we upped the balsamic to 2 Tbsp. 
I am not an asparagus fan but with this recipe I actually had a second helping. 
Will be making it again for asparagus as well as for green beans, broccoli, and cauliflower! 

We had hamburgers and I put leftover sauce on my burger and it was awesome!!

Edit: Made it again and it was even better than I remembered. Fast and easy to make. Great to drizzle on plain rice too.  ;)

I have never tried anything like this before - for me asparagus are always either steamed or quickly stir fried.  This was wonderful.  It put a new spin on asparagus for me.  I followed the recipe exactly and I did brown the butter.

Loved the sauce but added an extra teaspoon of balsamic vinegar per the other reviewers suggestions. So easy. So yummy. Would be great with a piece of salmon and rice.

This was pretty good.  I used VERY expensive balsamic and that made a difference.  I felt I had way too much sauce.  It tasted good though and lasted through a BBQ on a warmer!

This recipe is wonderful.  I've made it several times now and it is always a big hit.  I even served it as a side for a holiday dinner this year and my guests were quite impressed.   Easy to make and so very good.  It's a regular dish now in my household.

Pretty much tasted like plain roasted asparagus; did not find flavorful.  I did brown the butter.  Used 1 t. soy and 1 T. balsamic per reader reviews... maybe that was the prob?  Reduced them in the pan a bit because the balsamic was so acidic...  Not bad, just no raves here.

Did not think the sauce really added anything to the asparagus.  They were good from roasting, but salt was really all we tasted other than the flavor of the asparagus themselves

This recipe is wonderful! Love oven-roasted vegetables. The butter sauce with soy and balsamic is the finishing touch. Feels like you are dining in a highly rated restaurant when enjoying this dish.

Followed to the letter save for cooking in the oven as my oven wasn't working, so I steamed the asparagus and drizzled the balsamic/butter mixture over.  Just the same, it was delicious!

meh. after reading all of the great reviews, I was pretty excited to try this sauce. I suppose if you dislike asparagus to begin with, it is nice to have a sauce that overpowers the taste of the vegetable. But I'd much rather enjoy the asparagus roasted plain. Thank you for the recipe, I think I was expecting more.

this was great! I whipped this up to accompany grilled garlic-soy salmon and white rice, and it went perfectly! Hubby commented on it twice, so will definitely add it to the normal ways I prepare asparagus!

I was very skeptical about the balsamic vinegar. When I taste the sauce alone it seemed salty. Thank for the advice of transposing the amounts for the vinegar and soy sauce. I will make this over and over again.

Tried this with two heads of fresh broccoli, since I had no asperagus on hand.  Doubled the amount of butter, but kept the other measurements the same. I was concerned the broccoli would soak up too much of the soy and balsamic and be overpowering. My kitchen smelled funny while baking, but the end result was delicious! Would definately make this again! Next time I might add a little bit of fresh garlic.

Such an easy way to make asparagus.  I didn't add any salt since the butter and soy sauce both have it.  Added red pepper flakes instead of regular pepper.

The first time I made this was about a week ago and my family loved it!  I have never been particularly fond of asparagus, but I was eating this like it was candy.  Instead of using cooking spray, I used corn oil (or olive oil, both work) and I poured it directly onto the baking pan, about 2 tbsps.  Then I put the asparagus on top of the oil and moved the pan back and forth like I was sifting, coating the pan and the asparagus at once.  As for the balsamic dressing (which is the gold of this recipe!) I basically eye-balled my measurements according to my tastes, I like balsamic vinegar, but I didn't want it, or the soy sauce, to be too overpowering.  Wow, it came out perfect!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!!

I adore this sauce!!! You can't go wrong with anything butter based but I could drink this sauce by itself. Toss it on asparagus and it's divine!!

This would have 4 stars if no soy was used, it's too overbearing for this light dish.  Time and temp was dead on though!

This was really good--we ate it with steak and the sauce was really good with the steak as well. Be forewarned that if you have really skinny asparagus like I did, you'll want to put it in the oven for less time. I took it out after 8 minutes and it was just right.

The balsamic vinegar overwhelmed the asparagus, and even with a "skinny" bunch of asparagus, 12 minutes was not enough cooking time. If I make it again, I'll halve the vinegar and keep closer tabs on cooking time.

first attempt i didn't read the reviews about browning the butter... i will have to definitely try that next time... if you want to be super healthy the asparagus tastes great baked without the butter also... but next time i will give browning it a try...

Absolutely divine.  My family loved it.  My picky eater was prepared to do battle over having to try the asparagus.  There was no battle.  He even went back for seconds.  I am SO going to impress some dinner guests with this recipe.  Thank you!!!

This was very good.  Looking forward to making it again, next time I'll try making the sauce first and will saute the asparagus in the sauce to absorb more of the flavor.  Either way, it's a great, easy recipe.

Try a drizzle of EVO and a garlic flavor rice vinegar.
Before serving top with fresh shaved parm cheese.

Also... a little cheater for great Bernaise is Knorrs packet but I use half the butter and 2% milk. Fantastic on beef and vegetables.

I didn't have time, so I steamed the asparagus, and it still turned out good. Easy and tasy, will make again.

I had double the asparagus so doubled the sauce and did like others suggested and used 2 TBSP of soy sauce to 4 TBSP of vinegar (btw I thought I had balsamic, didn't so had to use zinfandel vinegar which still turned out really good). We also had the sauce on our fish. Really really good and will definitely make again.

This is a great simple recipe.  I had never eaten asparagus before but this was a wonderful first time experience.  After tasting the sauce alone, I was concerned with how salty it was but once I added it to the asparagus, it was perfect!!  I will be making this again and again!

So easy and yummy!  I love how much flavor you get from 3 basic ingredients, while still keeping the asparagus flavor the most prominent.  I, as many other reviewers did, put in 1 tsp of soy sauce and 1 Tbs of balsamic.  Personally, as a balsamic lover, I could have added a ibt more balsamic and it could have been just as good if not better. I also browned the butter and the richness really added to the other flavors.

One of the best, easiest sauces to throw together.  We were bbq'ing filet mignons also and put a little of the sauce over the filets and they were delicious too.  I'm going to try this sauce with many of the fresh vegies we enjoy, I think it will be delicious with anything.  I bake my asparagus at 415 degrees for 14 minutes and sprinkle with a little olive oil and sea salt.

ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT - So simple and easy to prepare.  My husband said it was the best ever asparagus he had eaten...I sprinkled "Tastefully Simple's" Garlic Garlic over the top.  It was delicious.

Wow--who knew asparagus could be so flavorful!  I usually have to force myself and family to eat it since it's good for us, but this made it so yummy that everyone was vying for the last pieces.  OK, so you are adding butter (which you could substitute margarine) but I still think it's worth the extra calories to teach the kids to crave vegetables.  So easy, too.

Nice, easy-to-make side dish.  I altered the recipe as others suggested by letting the margarine cook a little extra long before adding 1 tsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp balsamic.  Next time, I will try to use butter instead of margarine for an even better flavor.

I used rice vinegar instead of balsamic and it worked well.  Also, I used one tablespoon of the vinegar and one teaspoon of the soy sauce, as recommended by previous reviewers.

Really like this. We eat asparagus weekly so it's nice to shake it up a little. I was afraid the soy sauch would overpower it but it was perfect. I added a little more butter than the recipe calls for.

Excellent way to prepare and eat asparagus!  I think 12 minutes was a bit too long - the tips of our asparagus were a bit crispy, but otherwise we enjoyed this very much.

All I could taste in the sauce was vinegar.  The asparagus turned out fantastic.  I'll probably bake them again with olive oil and salt and pepper when I don't feel like steamed.  The sauce just seemed bland and unnecessary.

Delicious! Served this tonight with the recipe Seared Salmon with Balsamic Sauce and it went together so well. Family loved it! I doubled the amounts for the sauce and still used it all, but it's so easy I can make more for the leftover asparagus we had. We planned for leftovers anyway and will look forward to having it again and again after that! Thanks for such an easy and yummy recipe. I will be using it often.

Delicious.  I doubled the sauce like most people said and I found I had too much, so I guess it depends on how saucy you like the asparagus, and what you're putting this over.  As a side not on rice or another starch I think the sauce as is is fine.

I prefer my asparagus cooked a little more, so I cook this recipe on the stove top. The balsamic butter sauce is wonderful!

WOW....this was delicious and extremely easy.  My husband and I ate the whole bunch ourselves and I'm already headed to the store to make more for tonight.  Went well with grilled pork.  I wouldn't change anything about this.  This is going to be a recipe we keep.

Excellent light sauce.  I made this along with beef wellington, so it gave us a sauce for the asparagus without adding the heaviness of a cheese sauce.

This is wonderful even though I had to use canned asapargus.  I ended the recipe with adding the canned asparagus to the skillet with the butter and balsamic vinegar.  We're entertaining tonight and, yes, its on the menu to impress.

Really good, not great, wish the sauce was a little thicker and had something to offset the amount of salt just a little but it was definitely good.

Never been a fan of asparagus until we tried them like this. They were great! The buttery sauce was perfect, and the asparagus came out nice and crunchy. Thanks!

Made as instructed, although I think it could be just as good without the butter added. Would probably also be good with just the soy sauce and no balsamic vinegar. Served with Balsamic Rosemary Marinade (chicken) from Williams-Sonoma's website. Yum!!

Doubled the sauce because my husband likes lots of sauce on everything.  Also used sea salt in the grinder. I've made this again and again for family and company.  Everyone loves it....and it's so easy!!  Just try to select asparagus fairly uniform in size or you'll have to watch as it bakes and remove the thin stalks earlier.

This is SOOOOO good!!!  The Sauce is just awesome.  As per other reviewers suggestions, I browned the butter first, then added 2 Tblsp Balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp. soy sauce, a but of salt and pepper and mixed.  We put it on some venison steak I grilled and it was out of this world.  You must try this recipe.

4 tbsp butter, 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar and 2 tsp of soy sauce. lightly browned butter, added balsamic vinegar to reduce a bit. removed from heat adding soy sauce. sauteed slices of yellow onion with a clove of garlic in olive oil as an addition. added onions and poured sauce when asparagus came out of oven.

I did not expect balsamic vinegar to go well with asparagus. Congrads, you surprised me.  I did alter this one a bit though. I added a few glugs of lemon juice and a tiny bit of terriaki sauce for sweetness. The sauce tastes ghastly in the bowl but wonderful on the asparagus!  Note: You have plenty of time to prepare the sauce while the vegetable cooks so the prep time is a bit inaccurate. This worked great with frozen asparagus!

Very good.  I will decrease the salt and the amount of time the asparagus is in the oven next time just out of personal preference. Even my kids dug it as written so I have no complaints.  Thank you very much.

Wonderful!  The only change I made was to cook the asparagus in a cast iron skillet with a little EVOO.  When it was just right, I removed it, kept warm and used the same skillet for the sauce.  Tossed the asparagus back in just to coat and then served.  It was a huge hit.

Yum. We love asparagus and this will be a recipe I will go to many times. I used Smart Balance instead of butter but followed the recipe with the rest. This would be excellent over broccoli/green beans/steak, etc. I served this with grilled smoked pork chops and fresh grilled pineapple.  I drizzled the sauce over all and the flavors were outstanding and complimented everything so well. Thank you for sharing.   I love this website and visit it "daily".  I never use my computer without checking out the daily reviews. LOVE IT.

Wow, the photos of this recipe do not do it justice! I doubled the sauce because most of it ends up sitting in the pan, and I'm glad I did. I'll make this time and time again!

This was excellent. It simply proves the point that you don't always need many ingredients to make something that is very, very good. I also lightened up on the soy sauce and doubled the vinegar for personal taste.

I guess the biggest compliment that I can give is that my kids ate it.  I made them eat 1 and they took 2 more afterwards.  My husbands wants me to pass the recipe to my father-in-law, too.  Every last bit was gone.  I did make extra sauce as someone suggested.  Made it exactly as it said...no changes.  Thanks for sharing!

This is such a simple recipe and an easy "upgrade" for the asparagus but yum- what a difference!  I took the suggestion of others and switched the proportions for soy sauce and balsamic vinegar.  These came out great- 5 stars!

This is always a hit with my guests.  I also switch the quantities of soy and balsamic.  I sprinkle the parmasean flavored slivered almonds found in packages in the produce sections for an added festive touch.

This was the best asparagus I have ever eaten. That is saying A LOT because I don't like asparagus at all.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I was lucky to buy very thin spears.  I think it was probably a little overdone.  My spears were the size of thick spaghetti noodles.  So that being said, you may need to make some time adjustments depending on the size of your spears.

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish. It was very good. I baked at 350 for about 20 min- which was a little too much (I was trying to time it to be done at the same time as the pork). Thank you so much for this!

This was fantastic- I tasted it when I took it out of the oven and it was great- then I added the other ingredients and I have to admit that I prefered it without the balsamic vinegar and soya sauce. Next time I will just pour a bit of melted butter and thats it.

This was really good! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and browned the butter a little before adding the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar. Also swapped the amounts of those two so there was a TBSP of Balsamic and only a tsp of Soy. Had skinny asparagus, so they only had to bake for about 8 minutes. I then just threw them in the pan with the sauce, tossed to coat, and served. Delish!

LOVE THIS!  I had to make Christmas dinner 3 times this year and made this all 3 times.  I let the asparagus cook in the balsamic/soy sauce mixture and it carmalized just enough to make it even more fabulous!

All I could smell and taste was browned butter.  I ate one fresh out of the oven.  Thankfully the smell and taste softened overnight in the fridge since I had to serve it to guests the next day.  Ppl ate it at dinner, so that is the only reason I am giving it one star.  Will not try this again.

The first bite with the balasamic butter sauce was good, but then I just felt it was too strong of a taste.  I think you really need to just barely drizzle it on.  I won't be making the sauce again.  I usually steam my asparagus but when I tried a spear just out of the oven (prior to putting sauce on it), I thought it was delicious.  Next time I make asaparagus I will be roasting it based on the directions in the recipe.

Found the asparagus was a little chewy - but I may have bought too ripe of a bunch.  the balsamic was good but I felt that I needed to reduce it a little to make the falvor pop.

Awesome recipe. I tripled it and topped some over stuffed salmon.. yummmyy.. I also took the advice of others and let the butter brown, I switched around the measurements for the balsamic(used tbspn instead) and soy sauce(used teaspn).  My asparagus were not exactly the way I wanted them but I think I put a little too much cooking spray.  I will make this again!!

I have made and shared this recipe many times since finding it in Cooking Light magazine! My husband loves it! I can't imagine a better recipe anywhere for fresh asparagus! It is super easy and as elegant as you can get for a dinner party. Kudos to the original creator of this recipe!

I decided to try using mushrooms and zucchini in addition to the asparagus.  I tossed all the veggies in olive oil with kosher salt and pepper, then roasted the mushrooms and zukes for 15 minutes before adding the asparagus.  Because I had more veggies, I doubled the sauce, swapping the amounts of vinegar and soy sauce and browning the butter first.  Even though I subbed half the butter for light margarine (which I added with the vinegar and soy sauce), the sauce turned out AMAZING.  We could hardly believe how good it was!  We loved it on both the veggies (the mushrooms and zucchini were a great addition) and steamed rice.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

This was delicious and the only way I can get my kids to eat asparagus. The minute I sat it on the table all I heard was "ughs" once I finally got them to try a bite, they couldn't get enough. Thanks!

Before this recipe, my husband and I thought we didn't like asparagus.  Now we make this every chance we get.  I make the soy sauce and balsamic equal amounts, per other reviews.  So delicious!

This was SO good and SO simple! I bought really thin asparagus and cooked up nicely! Followed the directions exactly, which I do not typically do.  I will make this again!  I've gotten so sick of asparagus.  This is my new favorite way to prepare it. Yum!

Just made this.  I want to bathe  in the sauce.  I am pregnant so this is one of those things I will have to keep in stock because I will be up making it in the middle of the night.  THE SAUCE WILL GO WONDERFUL ON ANYTHING!!!!  I could drink it with a straw.  Make sure ou cook the asparagus until almost crispy, and also reverse the balsamic/soy ratios.

I've made this several times and can't seem to get over how easy this recipe is.  I think it works best if you use equal parts butter, soy sauce and balsamic.  I've also cooked fresh greenbeans using this exact recipe and they are wonderful as well!

Took the advice of other reviewers and switched the amounts of soy and vinegar.  We loved it!  My husband (who usually leaves some asparagus on his plate) ate all of his and asked for more.  The sauce was great for dipping grilled steak in as well.

Very tasty!  Complimented the asparagus.  I threw mine into a bbq basket lined with foil, drizzled some olive oil, bbq'd for about eight minutes, and poured the sauce right onto the asparagus in the basket.  Was a hit. I used 1 tbsp soya sauce, 2 tbsp balsamic.

This was wonderful! I made this for Father's Day today--had never made asparagus before--and it turned out perfectly! It was so easy, I followed the recipe exactly, and everyone loved it. I just had to add a couple of minutes to the baking time. The more we ate, the more we enjoyed it! Will definitely make again!

WOW,WOW,WOW!! I am usually not a asparagus fan, but with this basic recipe and a couple of unplanned changes it was spectacular. First, because my oven was in "clean" mode, i wasn't able to bake this. i cut the spears in 2 after removing the woody parts. Then stir fried them in veg oil with chopped garlic. i then melted the butter in the microwave and added soy sauce to the butter along with about 1 tblsp sesame seeds. before adding the butter, because the spears were still a bit too crunchy i added about 1/4 c water to my wok and steamed the aspargus. after the water had steamed off added the butter mixture to the veggies and tossed to coat... yummmy! DH, who doesnt usually eat aspargus, cleaned his plate of all his veggies..

Very good and easy way to make asparagus.  They came out tender and flavorful.  I doubled the sauce as I had a large batch to make, but next time I will omit the salt when baking the asparagus, as with the soy sauce in the recipe it has enough salt flavor.

I am not much of an asparagus fan, but this has changed my mind.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I will alter a bit in the future according to some others suggestions by adding more vinegar and less soy sauce and brownig the butter a bit more.

This is a phenominal recipe.  The 7 year old little boy in our house who doesn't eat ANYTHING that is green loved it and now requests that we eat it at least once a week.  It's also simple to prepare and goes great with mashed potatoes and grilled chicken.

This is fabulous!!  My whole family loved this even my 2&4 year olds.  Hubby raved.  The sauce added a nice light flavor to the asparagus without overpowering it.  There were no leftovers.  I used kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.

So good!  I did as others suggested, and browned the butter first.  Don't miss out on that- it smells incredible.  I doubled the  recipe, using 4 T butter, still only 1 T soy, and 2 T balsamic. I did not use salt and pepper. I served this at a week night dinner party, and everyone had seconds. Really delicious and very little effort.  I also used frozen asparagus for convenience.  Just lay them out on baking sheets while you are preparing the rest of dinner so they can thaw a little before they go into the oven.  I served this with the crock pot turkey breast from this site, mixing some of the turkey juice with a jar of good quality turkey gravy (read the labels- some have lots of filler and chemicals).  I also cooked a bag of white and a bag of brown frozen rice from Trader Joes.  I arrived home from work 10 minutes before my guests arrived for dinner, and this was an impressive meal to present.  Everything was delicious, but the asparagus added real class and a gourmet touch.  Thanks!!

Pretty much perfect. Could've used a little something eles (hence the 4 stars) just dont know what. But these were definatly good. Followed all directions as written. Used the skinny aaparagus, came out to desired tenderness. Poured a couple drops of the sauce over them the last minute of baking. What more can I say? Thanks for the great recipe!

Switched the balsamic vinegar & soy sauce amounts and sprinkled a wee bit of garlic powder over the asparagus as it was cooking.  Sensational and I can't wait to have the left-overs tomorrow!

I thought the sauce was very good however it did not infuse into the asparagus very well. Next time I might saute them in the sauce so that the flavor of the wonderful sauce will be distributed throughout the asparagus.

We loved this recipe. It is now one of our favorite ways to prepare it our favorite vegetable. I also changed the soy and vinegar amounts. The soy was too salty for our taste.

I've made this a number of times now, and it's always great. I don't change a thing, except that I usually melt the butter in the microwave since most of my saucepans and/or burners end up being occupied when I'm cooking.

Normally I roast asparagus, but this was just as easy and a nice change.  I made the recipe as written because I was really, really low on balsamic, but I'm very excited to try switching the amounts of the balsamic and soy as other reviewers suggested.  I also wonder if maybe it wouldn't be tasty to actually cook the asparagus in the sauce so the flavors have some time to concentrate -- but as written, still very good!  UPDATE:  switched the vinegar and soy sauce, and it was delicious!  Also, added the sauce for the last two minutes of cooking time.

The asparagus was great even without the sauce.  I made the recipe with 2 tbsp of butter and had leftover sauce.  I also browned the butter before I added the soy and vinegar.

I only had margarine, so I don't think we got the full effect of the recipe. However, it was still very tasty even though it didn't have the same taste real butter would have allowed. The combination of the butter flavor with the soy and vinegar seemed odd when reading the recipe, but it actually works very well together, especially on the asparagus. Will definitely try again with butter next time.

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my picky husband.  I followed other's advice and did 1 tbsp of balsamic and 1 tsp of soy, simply because I love balsamic.  The sauce amount was perfect for one bundle of asparagus.  I also added just a sprinkle of onion powder :)Delicious!!

This recipe was super-easy and delicious. The tang of the balsamic vinegar combined with butter makes for a smooth sauce that perfectly complements the asparagus. Great side dish!

We thought these were great. I didn't tell anyone I did something different to my normal roasting of the asparagus, but everyone noticed right away ,and really enjoyed them. Just a little different to shake things up.I will diffently make again.

My husband is an asparagus lover and I'm still aquiring a taste for it so I'm trying to find different ways to prepare it.  I followed the recipe ingredient wise but since we have an 11 week old and time isn't always something I have a lot of, I just baked it with everything in it instead of adding it after it baked.  My husband loved the recipe and I thought it was pretty tasty myself.

This was amazing!!! My husband and I loved the sauce. We ended up putting it on our steak, potatoes, and we even dipped our bread into it. It was the best sauce. Tomorrow I plan on marinating a pork tenderloin in it. Thanks for the recipe.

I gave this a two because I did manage to get it down thanks to my love for asparagus.  My dad said it tasted ok, but I did not care for this.  I am sorry to give a negative review.  It is my own personal taste, but I did not care for this at all!  I am actually shocked so many people loved this.  If you try this, good luck.

Intense but great flavor. I was rushed, so I melted the butter in the microwave then mixed in the other sauce ingredients. Next time I will heat the ingredients together so the sauce is one unit. UPDATE: used as leftovers with a baked chicken breast (garlic salt, pepper, oregano) and couldn't get enough!

crowd pleaser! I was apprehensive about this recipe (we usually use cream sauces) but it was wonderful--light and flavorful! smelled great too. Only change I made was I poured the sauce over the asparagus for the last few minutes of roasting so they really soaked up the taste. yum.

This recipe gave me a whole new love for asparagus! I followed the exact recipe the first time and it was fantastic but being the experimental home chef that I am, I had to try something a little different. For the 2nd time around I added in a small amount of dijon mustard to the brown butter mixture and it was FABULOUS.

This was great, I made it for Thanksgiving last night and thought my brother-in-law was going to lick the dish clean! I used equal amounts of balsamic and soy, and I do want to try this on green beans, as another reviewer mentioned.

I used olive oil instead of butter to make this recipe healthier. To keep the nice buttery taste, I sprayed with butter spray. Excellent taste!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it's delicious as is and next time I'm going to follow other reviewers advice and brown the butter.  I can't imagine how it can get any better but I'm sure it will!  Yum!  Oh and I grilled the asparagus rather than roast it just because I already had steaks on the grill. Update 11/17...made this again tonight and whoa! Browning the butter is so so so good and I roasted the asparagus w/ a bit of EVOO and salt for 12 minutes and it was perfect!  (I usually always grill it)  I also did 1 T. each of balsamic and soy.  Delicious!

The asparagus did turn out very tender but there wasn't much flavor to it aside from the butter.  I browned the butter and I took the advice of some other reviewers and flipped the soy sauce/balsamic vinegar measurements.  I would make this again just because it's such an easy recipe for asparagus but I'm going to play around with the soy sauce, balsamic vinegar and butter next time.

DELICIOUS. Every time I used to google "roast asparagus," this recipe would come up. Not only is it the perfect way to cook asparagus fast, the butter/soy sauce/balsamic glaze is just delicious. I made it for my sisters, who were skeptical, and are now in love. We substitute Mrs Dash for salt & pepper, btw.

This recipe is astonishingly good--I've converted asparagus haters with it.  Added a little more soy, because I like the taste, but followed the directions perfectly otherwise.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good. Dont use all of the sauce...too overpowering. Definately use 2T of the balsamic. Good sprinkled with a little parmesan. BROWN THE BUTTER. Serve immediatly while warm.

I didn't like this sauce at all.  It tasted way too strongly of soy sauce in my opinion, and really drowned out the flavor of the asparagus.  My husband didn't like this either, and he loves soy sauce on just about anything.  I won't be making this again.

I tried this recipe on my Birthday when I had my mother and 90 year old mother-in-law over for a steak dinner.  My mother-in-law had never hade asparagus and had three (3) helpings.  I usually fix asparagus on the grill with olive oil and salt & pepper, but my husband stated that this is now his favorite recipe.  This is definately a keeper!!!

Yummy!  "Brown butter".  My new favorite flavour!  This was really nice and bf who doesn't like parmasan said it was good in this dish!  I think some toasted almonds would be really nice to try added to it.

This is an excellent recipe. I am making it for the third time today. I had never made asparagus before and the very first time, it turned out delicious, tender, succulent and so very, very, easy to make. My husband and kids love it. Whenever we go to a restaurant and considering ordering asparagus, I hesitate because I wonder if it will be as good as the one I make using this recipe. Again, try this simple easy recipe. You won't regret it.

Can YOU say YUMMY?  OH wow.  I had doubled the recipe and browned the butter! With the balsamic and soy and I also added about a Tbsp of lemon juice.  I'm tellin' you, I wanted to just drink the juice!  My 17 year old daughter preferred it just out of the oven, but me?  I LOVED the sauce.  Thank goodness for spring and our lovely asparagus.

This gets 5 stars because it was delicious and EASY!! What a perfect holiday side-dish and a great change from the regular ole green beans. As suggested, I switched the quantities of soy & vinegar and added just a bit of lemon juice (about 1 tsp to the doubled recipe), and omitted salt.  I also pre-steamed the asparagus in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Since I doubled the recipe, I cooked it for about 15 min in a glass 10x15 dish. The asparagus came out tender-crisp and the sauce was flavorful and mild. Another 4-yr-old approved recipe--my kiddo actually tried asparagus for the first time!

What an easy and different way to serve asparagus. My entire family loved it, including my 3 year old granddaughter. The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star is because my husband still likes it steamed with pepper and butter. Will make this again.

An awesome recipe - I cooked the asparagus at 350 for 17 minutes (just because I had something else in the oven at that temperature). I used 1 tbsp of butter, 1/2 tbsp of soy sauce and 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar - we are big balsamic fans, and this combination was delicious. I drizzled the sauce over the roasted asparagus on dinner plates. I'll definitely make again!

Oh wow, I loved this!!  I sprayed my baking sheet w/olive oil spray, and then drizzled regular olive oil on top, and shook the pan around to coat.  I loved how roasting the asparagus made it a tiny bit crispy on the tips.  And the balsamic sauce.... I could drink that!!  I did cut the soy sauce in half because I wanted to taste more balsamic than soy.  I think that was a good move on my part.  I used low-sodium soy, like always.  And I made the sauce in the microwave.  I ate way more than my share of this asparagus.  What a great recipe!

These are perfect as-is.  I didn't change a thing and I don't think I ever will.  They're fool-proof, no more wiggly soggy asparagus!  These come out done perfectly and with such a wonderful flavor.  My husband raved and I have a feeling I will be making these again and again and again!

Incredibly delicious. I was skeptical about “burning the butter”, but it wasn't hard. After just a minute or two in the pan, it starts to change color. It was easy. My mistake was that I prepared it too early. It really only takes about 15 minutes from start to finish. And you should definitely prepare the sauce just before serving. I tasted it and the asparagus was perfectly cooked (exactly 12 minutes in the toaster oven at 400) and deliciously crunchy (not mushy at all) – then, when my husband came home late, I made the mistake of microwaving the whole meal. Oops. Made the asparagus a bit mushy. Wont do that again. But the good news is that this recipe is so quick and easy that it can be prepared just minutes before you eat!! My husband was adamant that I use the sauce on everything from now on. Oh, and I used 1 Tbs soy and 1 Tbs balsamic vinegar. I will definitely be making this again and again – and for company too! It looks beautiful!

Love it!  I've only steamed asparagus before so baking it was a nice change.  The balsamic butter sauce is great on the asparagus but goes well with meats as well.

I sure can't say anything very original in this review: perfect, the best, simple, etc.  I skipped putting them on a cookie sheet and put them in one layer across a 9x13" serving dish.  Nuked the sauce in a spouted cup to drizzle over.  Kept all the proportions exactly the same along with the baking time.  So, so easy and fantastic!

Really good recipe. I browned the butter as suggested by another reviewer and increased the balsamic vinegar to taste- until it was a perfect balance between the soy sauce and the balsamic- I used sea salt and fresh ground pepper, and I finished the asparagus up under the broiler - 1 min.- (and cooked for about 8 minutes  400 degrees and turned them before putting them under the broiler). They were excellent, but only after tweaking the recipe hence the 4 stars and not 5. Thank you for posting the recipe!

This was fine -- I reversed the soy sauce/basalmic ratios as others suggested and I thought it was a bit too sweet (due to the basalmic vinegar flavor).  I may try it the other way next time.  In the end, I'm just as happy with the asparagus sauteed in some butter with some salt on it.

What a delicious sauce to put on asparagus, or anything for that matter. My boyfriend used it with the baked salmon we had to accompany the asparagus and he loved it.

I love the flavor this adds to the asparagus and it's so simple to make.  The only change I made was to subsitute olive oil for the butter.

This recipe is fantastic!  Everyone gets so happy when I make it.  It is fabulous with fresh asparagus.......and recently I tried frozen cut up asparagus (fresh stuff is dried up at our grocery store) and even that was super.  The litlle bit of soy sauce and balsamic vinegar give it such a wonderful flavor.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

[[UPDATE: I made this for my mom some time back and ever since then she has been finding every opportunity to make it again! We were never asparagus eaters in the first place, but this recipe won us over]]  My brother who predicted he would dislike asparagus suddenly fell in love with it when I placed this infront of him! Very flavorful!

When I was a kid, we called asparagus "worms with perms".  My own kids don't know what a perm is, but they love eating asparagus this way.

I made this two different nights for a group of 16 and a group of 26 and everybody raved about it. My mom the cook even called for the recipe. After putting the butter sauce on, I sprinkle parmesan cheese over it. I add a little more balsamic vinager to mixture. Not a big fan of soy.

This was okay.  I love asparagus, but my husband is not a fan, so I keep experimenting with new recipes.  He took a few bites of this one - which is good for him.  The soy sauce was a bit over-powering.  I would suggest using less soy sauce or more balsamic vinegar.

I think I would just steam the asparagus next time, but overall I loved the flavors in this dish. It was easy to make and added a little flavor instead of just having a plain veggie.

This is the perfect way to prepare asparagus.  I had never baked it before, and I don't think I will ever go back to steaming/boiling/etc.  The sauce is just right, too.

This recipe is going in my rotation. Delicious! My changes, I used a spray type of oleo (I know, not healthy, but it takes only a tiny amount.) instead of Pam. I also took the advice of others and reversed the proportions of the vinegar and the soy sauce. I also added the finely grated parmesian cheese. Freshly grate it. If you don't have one of those micro graters buy one. In the time it takes to open the green box type of cheese, you can have a mound of freshly grated cheese. Next time, I will increase the sauce. It was so good. I might quadruple it. Buy good quality soy sauce and balsamic vinegar. It will make or break this dish. I used a light salt soy sauce because I had added the cheese. I fixed a braised London Broil with this, and tried dipping the meat in the sauce. It was good. Next time I make London Broil I'll make the sauce and pour over it.
My husband said, "This is why I don't like to go out to eat!" After almost 44 years of marriage, a comment like that goes a long way!

Yummy! Got the recipe off of this site about 20 minutes ago, and already ate it! Very fast, but with a sophisticated taste. Used Promise for a healthy twist, and made extra sauce...hubby loved it! 
Will try suggestion of scorching butter for next time...which will be soon!

This recipe was just so-so for me. It was my first asparagus recipe & I didn't trim them quite enough. But I think it would've tasted the same by just cooking in water with a few shakes of balsamic vinegar at the end.

This is a great recipe. I altered the recipe slightly with equal parts soy and balsamic as they are both strong flavors and I didn't want one to overpower the other. It was delicious!

This has become one of my favorite side dishes. I do follow the other reviewers' advice in reversing the measurements for the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar. I usually double or triple the amount of sauce and pour it over roasted redskin potatoes - DELICIOUS! Thanks for a great recipe!

This couldn't be easier! This had a mild flavor, I expected more at first, but it really accented the asparagus rather than overpowered it's taste. A dish everyone will enjoy since it's mild and not strong flavored. Very very good and there was none left. I even made extra. Definately a do over.

This was just ok for us.  I was not a huge fan of asparagus until I found a recipe on here that I liked.  We really didn't like this one as much.  I don't know if it was because I misread something or it just isn't for us.  I will stick with my tride and true recipe of just sautee it up in a bit of EVOO and butter...then top it with some parm. cheese.  Thanks for the post anyway.

This was just okay.  I liked it but it wasn't something I'm going to make frequently.  Definitely double the sauce, it doesn't make a whole lot.

Good and easy.  I love Basalmic so I also swapped the amounts of the soy sauce and vinegar.  The neighbors enjoyed it as well.  Easy and tasty side dish that will be added to the rotation.

I'm giving this only three stars because I didn't care for it.  However, my guests raved about it and they all asked for the recipe.  They gave it five stars, but I prefer to taste the asparagus, and not all the seasoning.

Using a teaspoon of soy and a tablespoon of balsamic made this recipe outstanding!  Friends that I served this to, called today for the recipe!  (That's what reminded me to do the review)

This is a great way to cook asparagus.  Roasting it gives it a nice flavor that I prefer over boiling.  The sauce is wondeful.  Love it!!!  Watch the cooking time depending on the thickness of your asparagus.

I'm not a fan of asparagus but I LOVED this recipe.  I've never baked asparagus before - always steamed it, but I might be a convert now.  The soy/balsamic was simple and absolutely delicious.  11 minutes was just right for the asparagus I had, it was tendercrisp and perfect.  (My one year old even ate it!)  I'll be making again, thanks.

I love this dish!!  It was easy to make and very, very good. Personally, I'd make twice as much sauce, just because it was so good.  I cooked it for about 8 minutes, but I really like my vegetables au dente.  This is the new family favorite way of preparing asparagus.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  Baking the asparagus just made it stringy and tough.  I followed the recipe, but couldn't stand the result.  And reheating the leftover made the asparagus even worse!  Wouldn't make again.

I found this to be a very tasty asparagus dish.  I never liked asparagus as a child, and decided the other day to give it a "grown-up" try - this recipe caught my eye.  I did add some left-over sauted mushrooms to it, as well as a couple of different random spices.  I really enjoyed this dish!

I found this recipe to be awsome, my roommate thinks i can cook but this was easy to make and tasted great. I didnt have the Soy sauce but used Lee & pearns
sauce and used melted butter instead of the cooking spray and sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese on, try that!

I usually find that asparagus taste the same, no matter what you do to them but this recipe changed my mind.  This side dish is both easy and delicious.  Even my brother in law who doesn't really like asparagus liked this.  Who knew you could bake asparagus so easily?!  The sauce is absolutly wonderful and really dresses up this strong tasting vegetable.  You must try this.

Oven roasting gave the asparagus a wonderful flavor, and the valsamic/soy dressing was perfect with it.  Be aware that oven roasting times will vary, depending on the thickness of your asparagus.

Seriously delicious side dish, even better the next day. I used olive oil instead of cooking spray. I do tend to up the amount of balsamic in the recipe, we just love this dish, and have been eating it on a regular basis for a few months now since first finding it here. Thanks a bunch, CAE.

Overall, this was yummy. However, I felt that the "balsamic butter sauce" was not blasamic-y enough and too soy saucy. To me the sauce overwhelmed the natural taste of the asparagus. Next time I'll cut back on the sauce a tad.

Baking the asparagus made is less soggy than when i usually make it. I added a little garlic to the butter, but followed everything else. My husband loved it! I will be trying this sauce with other vegetables.

I haven't rated anything in a long time, but this totally deserves it. I don't even normally care for asparagus, but I needed a green side to go with my salmon and rice, and the asparagus was looking especially good at the store. I thought this recipe looked weird enough to try, and I'm so glad I did! Now not only will I eat asparagus more often, but this is the ONLY way I will make it. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was absolutely delicious. Very simple, and definitely great for company!

What a fabulous recipe! The asparagus just tasted wonderful! We had grilled chicken with the asparagus and, wow, did the chicken taste great with some of that sauce on it!
I can't wait to make this recipe for my next family/friend gathering!

This was a very easy side dish to make and very quick.  I had something else in the oven at 375, so I just baked the asparagus at 375 instead of the 400 degrees.  It only took about 10 minutes (they were kind of thin asparagus).  I also used frozen asparagus from Costco rather than fresh and it turned out great.  I let them thaw on the counter before I baked them.  The only change I made was I sprinkled parmasean cheese on the asparagus after I added the sauce to them.  Great!

This is a great way to eat asparagus!  My only tip is to be careful not to overbake the asparagus.  If the asparagus is smaller in diameter decrease the baking time or the asparagus will be mushy.  I agree with a previous reviewer who said to use real butter (Amen!) and I will try with different vegetables too.

Okay, I was doubtful, but this was really, really good.  I almost always change a recipe, but this was great just as written.  It will go in my "keepers" recipe book.  Thanks for a different and delicious variation of asparagus.

This was so good!  I love asparagus and this is just another great way to prepare it.  Very easy and quick.  This would be great with almost any good roasting veggie.  Next time I will use squash, Zucchini as well.

GRRREAT.  I added garlic and pepper to the seasonings, which gave it a better flavor.  I was skeptical about it but it turned out delicious.

I also agree that this recipe was a little salty.  Next time I will probably use low sodium soy sauce, or less of it anyway.  Other than that it was very good, I like this method of cooking asparagus.

Wow, this is excellent!  The sauce is great, I added equal parts soy sauce & balsamic vinegar.  Yummy :)  I made seared ahi steaks that night and the sauce from the asparagus was wonderful with the fish.

Just okay. This is the first time that I used balsamic vinegar, so that may account for the odd "tang" that I didn't like.  Will not make again.

This was very good, but still can't beat my regular roasted asparagus recipe.  There was no balsamic vinegar taste to this, just soy sauce.

Good way to serve vegetables that aren't ho-hum. I also appreciated this recipe showed me how to make fresh veggies without resorting to boiling them. I bet this would be great all rolled up in foil and tossed on the grill for 15 mins. I'll try that next!

I agree with the others--this is a great way to prepare asparagus, especially if you are already using your oven for something else.  Nice way to multi-task your meal prep.

This is such a great recipie! It can be used on so many differant vegtables and in so many dishes! I reccomend doubling the sauce, and dipping the vegtable of choice in it, and don't forget to brown (not burn) the butter, it makes all the differance. It is a regular in my home now!

Wow!  This was fantastic.  I usually steam asparagus but I will always bake it this way from now on.  It was tender, not stringy at all, and the sauce is divine.  I made this with Marinated Tuna Steaks from this site and mashed potatoes, and they matched perfectly.  (The sauce was also good on the fish and potatoes!)

Magnific!! Added Garlic power prior to baking and used EVOO instead of cooking spray. Added fresh grated parmesian after the Balsamic-butter was put on it and it was awesome. Asparagus was tender and falvorful. Great recipes, if you like Asparagus and Balsmic vinegar you cannot go wrong with this recipe

Very good.  I have always steamed my asparagus until I tried this recipe, now I'll always bake if I can.  The only thing I changed was to use 1t soy sauce and 1T balsamic vinegar.  Super easy.

Simply the best!!! I had my hesitations (balsalmic and soy? really?), but I love asparagus so much. I usually boil mine and cover with butter and lemon. Never again...I have found my asparagus recipe!!!! WOW WOW WOW. That's all I can say. The sauce also makes a great vegetarian gravy substitute for mashed potatoes!!!

I absolutely LOVED this asparagus!  I drizzled with olive oil as previously mentioned.  Since I'm not a big soy sauce fan, I only used 1/2 tbsp of soy but increased the balsamic to 1/2 tbsp.  I might even just try butter and balsamic the next time.  Great side dish!

Great dish.  I almost always roast asparagus and use a variety of seasonings and sauces depending on the menu, but this is now on our favorites list.  I did use 2 tsp (rather than one) of the vinegar for a slightly stronger balsamic taste.  I used light butter.  I also cooked it at 375, instead of 400, since I needed to coordinate two cooking temps.  Extended the time to 15 minutes.  Came out just fine.

It tasted better than simply steamed asparagus.  Dad found it had too much of a vinegar flavor, even though I cut the balsamic vinegar by half.  Cooked 10 minutes, and the asparagus' "crispness" was good.  Also used 2.5 tablspoons butter instead of 4.  Again, not bad, but there are better recipes.

What an excellent recipe.  It was quick, easy and very tasty.  The soya sauce, balsamic vinegar and butter sauce did not overpower the taste of the asparagus.   I would never have baked this vegetable on a baking sheet until I tried this recipe.  Great idea.

This is absolutely delicious!  My husband raved about it and he didn't even like asparagus before this recipe. It's very easy to make...I didn't change a thing.  I will be using this recipe often!

I usually pan dry in sesame oil, and add Soya to steam to Al dente. This was a good alternative to that, as I was out of Sesame oil and wanted to try it a different way. I liked it, and was pleasantly surprised. Will not hesitate to make this way again.

I actually added small, different colored potatoes and mushrooms that I had left over from another meal to the asparagus. The sauce is amazing. You can do so much with it.

One of the best ways to prepare asparagus. Be sure to avoid asparagus which is tiny; get the thicker kind. The tiny ones have a tendency to dry out quickly and start to shrivel up in a hot oven.

Delicious!  I doubled the butter. Used:
       2 tbsp. butter (Browned, melt on medium heat stir constantlyy till brown)
     1 tbsp.  Balsamic vinegar and 
     1 1/2 tsp. Soy sauce.
I baked the asparagus for 15 minutes, I don't like crisp veggies.  As soon as I plated asparagus, I poured butter sauce over it.  
    We had this with ribeye steaks.  The butter sauce was delicious with the meat also.This is the only way I'll make asparagus from now on!!!   Love it!!

Way overcooked my first try,  (got interrupted by my new grandbaby). Saved the tips, used as a topping for baked potato, what a discovery. Second try, I did right. Excellent, will make many times again. Also used the sauce  on brussell sprouts. 400 degrees, cut in half lengthwise and cooked cut side down 15 minutes. flip them, baste  with the sauce another 15 minutes, or until tender.

I used olive oil instead of cooking spray, skipped the s/p, and swapped ingredient amts for the soy sauce and vinegar.  I only had margarine, which didn't brown.  This was good, but we often roast asparagus with some oil and balsamic vinegar, pepper, seasoned salt, etc, and it seems like less work to be just as tasty.

I doubled the sauce ingredients because I had almost 3 lbs asparagus. It was delicious.  I usually make  it roasted but wanted something different.  Everyone liked it but still prefer roasted with garlic.  I will make it again to change things up.

This is the recipe that made me love asparagus. I browned my butter, and reversed the amounts of soy sauce and balsamic. Completely amazing dish.

This is so easy and delicious, and can be made in under 15 minutes if you make the sauce while the asparagus bakes. Like others, I swapped the quantities for balsamic vinegar and soy sauce, otherwise made as directed.  We loved the sweet and salty combination on the asparagus and it complimented our Italian-themed dinner perfectly.

absolutely adore the sauce!!
I’m not sure which world you’re living in where 12 minutes is long enough to cook asparagus! hahahahaha I’ve made this recipe quite a few times and have made some changes - the asparagus needs at least 25-30 mins to bake, and I like to use equal amounts soy sauce and balsamic vinegar! I also drizzle the sauce over the asparagus and then cook it for a few more minutes so it crisps up a bit.

I made this on Christmas to go with a Beef Tenderloin.  This was delicious and super easy.  I used 1 tsp. of soy sauce and a T of Balsamic.   I felt it dressed up the Asparagus and made it a little more special.   Highly recommend.

This was wonderful!  My kids started licking the sauce off their plates once the asparagus was gone.  The only thing I changed was that I microwaved the butter just to make this quicker.  Next time I will brown it.

I'm not a big fan of Asparagus...but sometimes you have to eat it.  (kids, company, etc).  And if you have to eat it, this is the absolute best recipe I have found to make it enjoyable.  I really was surprised and gave it five stars for making an asparagus hater like me, actually enjoy the experience.  Yes, I would have it again!

absolutely delicious!!   I used olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic powder and salt/pepper.  I was worried the combination of balsamic and soy sauce would be overpowering.   It was wonderful without it.    My kids had seconds which is pretty rare to see when serving asparagus

I made this with the additional suggestions provided in the comments about doubling the sauce, browning the butter, and the soy to vinegar ration, and it turned out amazing! My mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and husband all cleaned their plate and were going back for seconds and thirds of this dish!

These are super easy to make and the best tasting brownies ever! I always make 2 batches because 1 is never enough and I do not add the icing. They are perfect with out the icing.

Simple, easy and delicious!  I add garlic when I baked the asparagus. I bet the sauce would be good on broccoli also.

It was good but def need to double the sauce.  I  switched the amounts of soy and balsamic as we like balsamic more than we like soy which was good but it was just not enough sauce. I will try it again as it was not a bad flavor...just not enoug h of it.

Delicious dish. Agree with other users about switching the measurements of soy and balsamic.  Didn't have time to brown the butter, but will try that next time.  Also, I subbed out the cooking spray for olive oil and used too much. This meant that the sauce didn't attach to the asparagus as much as I would have liked. Will try next time to use just a couple of drops of oil - just enough to secure the salt and pepper to the stocks.

My fiance and I loved this! Although I tend to add a bit more balsamic vinegar and less soy sauce as the soy sauce plus extra salt can make the asparagus too salty (plus we just really love balsamic vinegar!) Either way though this is a favorite in my house when trying to add more vegetables to our diet!

I personally feel the asparagus itself is perfect- tender but not overdone, crisp but not underdone. The sauce, however, is another story entirely. I've played around with the ratios of ingredients over many times making this (I like the asparagus itself that much) and since I like vinegar much more than I like soy sauce, I like to put put in only about 2-3 teaspoons of soy sauce and 2-3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar. I've tried browning the butter and not, and regardless of if my other changes sound appealing, trust me, you need to brown the butter.

I have made this a bunch of times now. Easy and per the other reviewer's the marinade is awesome if you instead do 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon of soy.

What sorcery is this???!!! When I tasted it, it tasted like corn on a cob oozing with butter. The flavors all dancing with gusto in my mouth. I did add garlic salt on the asparagus on top of the salt and pepper . To make the sauce even quicker, I just microwaved smart balance butter to melt it then added soy sauce and balsamic vinegar after. So quick and easy clean up.

Very tasty, the asparagus was cooked just right at the time and temperature suggested.  Only needs 1 TBSP of soy or eliminate the pre-salting.  Everyone enjoyed it!

At the advice of other reviewers, I used extra balsamic and browned the butter.  It made for a very tasty asparagus dish, the family and our guests enjoyed it very much...there were no leftovers.

I thought it was gross, but my husband thought it was ok. It tasted like vinegar toast to me. However this is my opinion. Its a cheap sauce to make (if you already have the balsamic vinegar) so just try it out. Maybe you'll love it. Definitely try it before dumping it all over your food though.

I used a little less butter than what is called for and I used Italian salad dressing instead of Balsamic vinegar.   Instead of baking, I like to steam all my vegetables, including asparagus.  I made the sauce, included the pepper and then poured it on the steamed asparagus.
Awesome sauce.  It made the asparagus taste great.   I definitely want to  do this one again.

I have been making this for about 10 years and my family just love it. I melt the butter till just brown before adding the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar, it gives it a nutty flavor.

I'm also in the, this is pretty bad camp.
I thought it was terrible and cannot understand the rave reviews.
I thought the butter was terrible and couldn't tell if I was tasting soy sauce, balsamic or butter. None of them seemed to go.
Good thing asparagus was on sale because we ate what was on  the plate and I threw the rest away.

I've now made multiple times and it's always a crowd pleaser. Simple, fast and delicious, providing you with a great side dish that allows you to focus your attention on the main dish. Only thing you need to worry about is forgetting about the Asparagus in the oven. I double the recipe and it is great!

As others suggested I reversed soy and balsamic amounts and it was very good. My grown son even said he liked it (without prompting), and he doesn't like asparagus.

The roasted asparagus was great.  The sauce not so much.  It separated & was too greasy for me.  I liked the taste of the balsamic vinegar, though, & will just use a drizzle of that at the table next time.  Thanks for a new favorite.

This was delicious!  What a great way to dress up asparagus.  I took the suggestion of others and browned the butter.  I also let the sauce thicken a bit over medium heat before pouring over the asparagus.

Perfect as is, we have this a couple times a month, sometimes I half bake it and finish it on the grill before saucing and serving. Delicious! I think this sauce would also be great on roasted Brussels sprouts.

My husband and son loved it. I followed suggestions and used 1 tsp of soy and 1 Tbsp of balsamic.  I then added a little Wondra to thicken the sauce. They were practically licking up the sauce when they were finished!

We LOVED this recipe!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  My husband raved about the asparagus all through dinner!

I made this last night with chicken and  roasted red potatoes.  The asparagus was delicious and came out perfect but the star of the meal was the red potatoes which I drizzled the sauce over.  Per suggestion of other reviews, I switched the amounts of soy sauce and vinegar and also browned the butter before adding.  Soooo good!

Tasted excellent. I did take the other reviewers' advice to switch the amounts of balsamic vinegar and soy sauce though.

Sauce is delicious! Next time will reduce so it will cling to the asparagus better.

I took the suggestions with the other reviews (1 tbp of sou and 2 tbsp of balsamic) There was a little too much vinegar for my tastes so I will have to alter this recipe to my liking.

I made this as a side for Christmas dinner, and it got wiped out.  Everyone loved it.  It has a nice salty and savoury flavour.  I highly recommend.  The texture and flavour really gel together well.  Simple, easy to throw together, and can go with just about anything.  Thanks for the recipe.

This had excellent flavor, but my only trouble was the asparagus was not in season & the cooking time seemed to be off - 12 minutes???  I baked it for 35 & it still was crisp.  Maybe operator error???  Anyways, we really enjoyed this & I will make again but my fiance said to steam the asparagus then bake them in the balsamic vinegar butter sauce.  Will try again this way instead.

I did not care for the dressing. It has a bitter stinky vinegar taste. I think maybe I'll try a garlic butter next time.

Have made this many times.  Spray a foil lined cookie sheet with Pam, line up asparagus, spray asparagus with Pam, sprinkle with garlic salt.  Switched the amounts of balsamic vinegar and soy sauce.  Just before serving, i spread freshly grated Asiago cheese over the spears and bake until melted.  Really like the addition of cheese.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Really great recipe! I followed IMVINTAGE´s advice and used 1 tbsp. of soy and 2 tbsp of balsamic. Don´t use too much oil on the asparagus while it cooks, or it get´s a little overwhelming. But delicious flavor! Try adding roasted sesame seeds for a little crunch !

This turned out perfect.  My husband and I both agreed that this was the best asparagus we have ever had.  We even make extra sauce now to drizzle over our pork, chicken or steak.

Good texture but I could hardly taste the balsamic glaze...I think next time I will try cooking it in the glaze instead of just pouring it on top.

As written, four stars, but it quickly goes to five stars with two changes. 1. As many have stated, flip flop the balsamic vinegar and soy amounts, and 2. brown the butter first. It seems like a small thing, but it makes a huge taste difference to the finished dish. Oh my goodness, with these two changes this dish is soooo delicious!!

Made this last night as a side dish with our shrimps and it was delicious!  I did change the amounts of balsamic vinegar and soya sauce as stated in previous reviews, using  1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar and only 1 teaspoon of soya sauce.  However, just out of curiosity I want to try the original recipe just to see what it tastes like.  I also loved the texture of the asparagus after baking it in the oven.  I've never done that before and it was gooood!!!  Thanks for posting.

Balance of flavors way off - too much soy overpowers everything.  This could be experimented with, but much better recipes out there!

I had never fixed asparagus before and only eaten it once before using this recipe.  IT WAS AWESOME!!  I definitely think of asparagus and this recipe as one of my first vegetable choices now.

I love this recipe I just used olive oil instead of butter and used a little Cajun seasoning on the asparagus. It came out flavorful and very tender, just perfect

Would you like some asparagus with your butter?  Very buttery and not even slightly healthy tasting.

This is a great way to change up my usual steamed asparagus!  I drizzled the asparagus with a little olive oil instead of cooking spray, and I also took some of the reviewer's suggestions and reversed the amounts of balsamic and soy sauce, delicious!  I think it would taste good either way though, I like both soy sauce and balsamic, can't go wrong with this one.

This recipe was bang on. I never used to like or eat asparagus before finding this recipe. Now I literally eat it everyday because of it! I use 1/4 butter instead of just the two tablespoons as I like more of a butter based sauce in mine, but other than that this was absolutely perfect! Thank you ever so much for sharing. Good job!

Excellent recipe!!!  The sauce is totally delicious!  As recommended by other reviews, I swapped the amounts of the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar.  Served as a side dish to Marinated Turkey Breast from this site.  Perfect combo!

This is very good and extremely easy. Like many others, I use low-sodium soy sauce and reduce the amount to 1/2 tsp. Also sprinkle Parmesan Cheese on top. Yummmm!

I was really surprised by how tasty this dish was. I make asparagus all the time, and I'll certainly be keeping this recipe in rotation. I doubled the sauce after reading other reviews, but I don't think it needs all the extra sauce because the flavor stands out without it.

This was very good.  I wasn't sure I would like the addition of balsamic vinegar, but the combination of flavors added just the right amount of seasoning to the asparagus.  It complemented and did not overpower the taste of the asparagus, and eliminated any trace of bitterness.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is delicious! I agree with the suggestion of maing sure the butter is brown in the pan before adding the soy sauce and vinegar.

This can come down to personal taste, but I feel the asparagus was standing on it's own just fine without the balsamic and soy sauce. Next time, I'll skip the fancy prep and stay with the roasting with olive oil and S&P to taste.

Really tasty!  I listened to a reviewer that suggested doubling the sauce, it is nice to be able to dribble some on your rice.

This recipe is so great I crave it on occasion.  I added the 2 TBSP of a 16 year old balsamic vinegar and it was excellent.

This is my new favorite way to prepare asparagus.  I did as others recommended and cut the soy and increased the balsamic to 1Tb.  It was a hit w/ my kids so I know it had to be good.  This is def. a do-over!

I loved this recipe. But I tweaked it a bit. Instead of using the balsamic vinegar, I used white cooking wine. Added 3 TBS before i put it in the oven, sprinkled some ground garlic over the top with a little kosher salt and baked for 12min. I kept everything else just as the recipe called for. WONDERFUL!

Was at the FreshMarket and they had these nice bunches of asparagus and even though I don't like the taste I decided to get them knowing that I would find a nice recipe here at the site. Wow, I was right. I prepared them the way this recipe shows with the exception of switching the quantities of the soy and balsamic vinegar. It came out great and I can say that I'll be eating more asparagus from now on. Thanks !

Just sized this up for 100 people. 
25 bunches fresh asparagus, trimmed
cooking spray
salt and pepper to taste
3 cups and 2 tablespoons butter (browned)
1-1/2 cups and 1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/3 cup and 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar

Reduced the balsamic to 1/3+ cups and browned the butter. Excellent.

I followed the directions to a T. I browned the butter as others suggested, but it did not make a difference. I also switched the amounts of soy and balsamic vinegar as suggested. The asparagus came out chewy. The sauce did not taste very good, it was okay, but not amazing. I don't know if I cooked it wrong, but it was not to my liking.

This was so easy and absolutely amazing! I think the tablespoon of soy sauce was a little overwhelming though, so I just added more melted butter. I also replaced half of the butter with a butter substitute for a healthier alternative. I'll be making this again and again. Thanks!

Fantastic!  The sauce is delicious and this is such an easy way to dress asparagus.  We love to gill, so we did the asparagus on the grill and had the butter sauce on the side for our guests to pour.  Yum!

Super easy and delicious! I used low sodium soy sauce to cut down on the salt a bit and it was really good. Will definitely make again.

This is great. Baking has now become my cooking method of choice for asparagus. Sometimes we don't even bother with the butter sauce, just eat it as is, straight off the baking sheet.

The sauce is so simple and outstanding, I can't believe I haven't seen it somewhere before. I do cook asparagus on the grill often and the sauce made it extra special.

So good!  I definitely double the sauce for a bunch of asparagus and do about equal parts of soy and balsamic.  After i add the two, I put back on the heat to reduce a little bit.  I add to the asparagus for another few minutes in the oven, comes out bubbling and delicious!

This was so yummy!  OMG, simple but, so delicious.  The only thing I did differently was brown the butter as others had suggested.  I baked the asparagus for only 10 minutes due to my oven temperature runs hotter than normal.    Great dish and a must in the future..

This is easy and a great variation on asparagus.  I usually saute it since I dont care for steamed asparagus.  Excellant flavor and perfectly cooked.

This is a terrific asparagus/sauce recipe!  It has been made for our past 3 Easters, and has received many compliments from family members.  To make gluten-free sub San-J Tamari sauce in place of soy sauce.

I tried this recipe this evening. Very simple for such great flavor. I did double the recipe because I served quit a bit of asparagus. The only thing I did different was peel my asparagus. I always do. It's a matter of preference.I would have given it 5 stars except the presentation color isn't quit up to par. Somewhat murky.

What a great way to eat asparagus!  I usually don't like asparagus as it's not very flavorful, but this one is!  I made it exactly like it said, but overcooked the butter on purpose.  My only suggestion is that you peel the bottom part of the asparagus, as it can be rough.

Incredible, just incredible.  I get so many compliments on this from dinner guests, and it is so very easy to make.  Also, baking the asparagus as opposed to steaming it ensures that it is crispy, not soggy.

The family loved this!  I was told to save this recipe 'for company'.  I followed the previous suggestions of browning the butter, decreasing the soy sauce & increasing the balsamic vinegar.  They added some aged gouda (it's their favorite cheese this week), but they like to add that to everything and I think it would have been a hit without the cheese.

This was good and it was fun to try something a little different.  But Hubs and I agreed that we prefer plain roasted asparagus with a little EVOO, course salt and freshly ground pepper better.

Absolutely WONDERFUL.

Except it always turns out stringier than I would like. I want it to bite off in one motion every time. But the flavor can't be beat.

This is fantastic - I make it all the time as a side dish.  You don't need the butter - I make it without it to save on the calories.

This was awesome.  I used 1 TB balsamic vinegar instead of 1 tsp.  Had leftover sauce in the bowl and poured it on my steak.  It was outstanding!!  I followed the advice of others and browned the butter.  It made a huge difference and was incredible!!!!!

This is a delicious side dish. I used low sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter and it was still excellent! Thanks for the recipe, I believe we liked this the best of the asparagus recipes we've tried at home so far!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I omit the salt and pepper, instead I sprinkle a little Italian seasoning over the asparagus before I bake it.  The sauce is delicious, I've played around with reducing the soy sauce (to reduce sodium) and 2 teaspoons has been a great balance to the tangy balsamic!

The sauce turned out well, but I liked it better over the chicken than on the asparagus, the sauce seemed to just run off.  I did brown the butter and use a tsp of soy sauce and a Tbsp of balsamic vinegar as suggested by other reviewers.

This was a huge hit at Easter dinner. It's so easy to make asparagus in the oven and the sauce is very savory and easy as well. Perfect side dish when you have a big family meal to prepare.

This was SO good!  I also took the advice of others and did 2 tablespoons of the balsamic and 1 of the soy sauce and browned the butter.  You will want to double this recipe because everyone will love it so much.  We also put this on our steak and it was amazing.  Such a simple but flavorful sauce.  This one is a keeper!!

I have never ate asparagus before, and my parents never liked them either.  I fixed this dish for my mother-in-law for our easter dinner.  I used low sodium soy sauce and followed what everyone else suggested and swapped the amounts of soy sauce and balsamic vinegar.  I think I finally found a new veggie, and my parents really liked it to.  My husband didn't like it but he doesn't do veggies.  But definately has to be fresh.  My mother-in-law always fixes canned and I thought it looked horrible.  Fresh is the only way to go.  I will definately fix this again.

Absolutely delicious! I've made these so many times for dinner parties, and they always disappear! I will say to use regular soy sauce and not low-sodium. It has more flavor that way. :)

I will admit this is the first time I have ever fixed asparagus and I plan on fixing it just like this again! I took the suggestions made by others to reduce the soy sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

The butter was overpowering, I cannot taste the soy sauce nor the balsamic vinegar.  Why so many people said it was good boggles my mind.  The roasting of the asparagus was good, but all it needed was salt, pepper and a drizzle of soy sauce.

great if you're bored w/ regular asparagus!  used 1 tbs butter and 2 tbs. balsamic, 1 tbs. soy.  next time use even less "sauce".  definitely brown the butter.

I LOVED this recipe - especially the cooking method for the asparagus. I can't believe I this is the first time that I roasted them - I won't be boiling or steaming asparagus ever again. They came out perfectly for my taste after 15 minutes. The sauce was delicious as well!

I used broccolini instead of asparagus, and it was delicious!  It was very easy to make, although next time I think I will double the sauce.  Definitely brown the butter.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband says this was the best asparagus he's ever had!  Thanks for such a simple way to dress up an "iffy" veggy in our house.  The kids liked the flavor still didn't like the texture of the asparagus.

We love asparagus, so when I find a new way to make it I have to try it.  This recipe did not disappoint!  My only caution is to make sure you use a good quality balsamic vinegar...it makes a  huge difference in the taste of the sauce.  As other reviewers suggested, I too reversed the amounts of the soy sauce and vinegar.  Delicious!

This recipe was so easy and very tasty! This was the first time I've roasted asparagus and I'll never do it any other way again. I took the other reviewers tip on the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar and it was exceptional. Will definitely make this again and again.

My girlfriend and I loved this.  I have to admit that instead of salt and pepper, I used garlic salt and lemon pepper, because we love those seasonings.  It was a little too salty, so next time I'll probably use garlic powder with light salt. Still rates 5 stars in my book.  Thanks for sharing!

In the description it reads "a simple and delicious side dish" yes ... it is simple and delicious but, it's PACKED full of flavor! My husband and I love asparagus and fix it many different ways but, this is my absolute favorite! I make my own flavored vinegars so I used balsamic vinegar infused with tarragon, don't forget to brown the butter  - it will make tones of difference. KUDOS to you CAE!

So easy to make, and with a few simple substitutions, very healthy! I used ICBINB instead of real butter and light soy sauce. Followed other reviews and went very light on the soy sauce. Perfect complement to the filet mignon I made for Valentine's Day.

This was so easy it was ridiculous. It had so much flavor, I didn't follow the recipe per se. I used it as a base for the ingredients for the sauce as well as added a splash of lemon. But it was absolutely fantastic! It's going in the recipe book!

This was great!  My husband (of two months) was used to asparagus with butter and garlic and was very concerned that I was doing it in a balsamic sauce... but he LOVED it.  And it is hard to get him to love something other than his mom's stuff.  I did follow the other reviews before me with the vinegar and soy sauce portions and overall it turned out very well.  At 12 minutes, though, the asparagus was slightly crispy for me so definitely WATCH THE ASPARAGUS!  Our new place must have a hot oven so next time I'll only do 10 minutes in the oven.  Overall very good!!!!

Excellent!  Followed the recipe exactly but, I added sliced baby bella mushrooms with the asparagus as I baked it.  I highly recommend it with Balsamic and Rosemary Grilled Salmon

Smelled odd, but tasted amazing!  Does anyone have a lite version of this recipe as that would change this from a once in awhile to a regular staple over here.  Thanks!

My husband had one huge grin on his face after eating this!  I love when he has those smiles..cuz I know I make him happy....I will definately make this again.I took a suggestion with the browning of the butter and I doubled the recipe. 4tbsp butter..2tsp kikkoman soy sauce....2Tbsp colavita aged balsamic vinegar...it was absolutely delish!  Thank you for sharing.  :)

This recipe added great flavor to a pretty boring vegetable.  Do not even bother keeping the left overs though, the asparagus does NOT hold up.  The left overs were soggy and just tasted like soy.

Heavenly! My father-in-law, who has something to say about everything, said this asparagus was "like eating candy (in a good way - he wasn't referring to sweetness) - cooked perfectly with just the right seasoning."

We LOVED this recipe!  I used olive oil to coat and kosher salt, and as others suggested, I used 1 tsp. of soy sauce and 1 Tbsp. of balsamic.  Even my 6 and 2 year olds ate it up....will definately make again.

This is a quick and easy recipe that is delicious and even elegant.  The balsamic taste goes well with the soy and butter.  Just be careful not to over cook.  No one likes soggy asparagus.

Wonderful sidedish!  Paired this with oven baked ribs tonight, and fiance and I both loved it.  Cooking notes: used 12 asparagus (medium thickness) baked for 10 minutes in toaster oven at 400F as directed.  For the sauce, I used 2T margarine, 1t soy sauce and 1T balsamic, simmered for 8 minutes until reduced.  Fantastic -- will definitely make it again!

The Balsamic Butter Sauce is absolutely delicious!! I sprinkled the asparagus with extra-virgin olive oil, sea salt and fresh-cracked black pepper, tossed to evenly coat, and then sauteed the asparagus in a fry pan over med-high heat until slightly softened. Then I added the Balsamic Butter Sauce and mixed well. This  was a huge hit; it even got more attention and praises than the main dish did!!

I hadn't cooked asparagus before and this was an awesome recipe to start with! I exchanged the amounts of balsamic vinegar and soy sauce like other reviewers suggested. So tasty!

This is so so SO delicious!  Like others I switched the amounts of the soy sauce and vinegar, which worked well.  Everyone ate theirs before anything else and told me to go out and buy some more asparagus to make more!

I thought this was fantastic!  I took another reviewers advice and went with 2T of balsamic and 1T of soy.  Also let butter brown before making sauce.

I thought this was a 4 and my BF thought it was a 5!  It was good but I could have eaten it as is, without the sauce.  I love the idea of just spraying it and adding salt and pepper. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this last night for dinner to acompany Thai Tuna Burgers (on this site) and Thai curry rice.  Not that this is a Thai recipe, but it was the veg that I had on hand, LOL.  Anyway, this was fantastic.  I made pretty much as-is, except I wanted to brown the butter a little (as suggested by other reviews) and I forgot to do that before adding the vinegar and soy, so I'll try that next time.  I also didn't spray this or salt/pepper this before putting it in the over, because I didn't think it needed it.  This turned out fantastic and was even better after sitting in the sauce for a few minutes.  My new fave way to make asparagus!

I made this to bring for Easter dinner and everyone liked it.  It's easy to make and the asparagus comes out just right.  I did make the switch with more balsamic and less soy.  Will definitely make this again.

This was a great side dish along with a piece of salmon.  Very healthy dinner.  I switched the amounts on the balsamic and soy sauce as many reviewers suggested because I love balsamic and soy sauce can be a little salty.  I will make this one often as long as I can afford the fresh asparagus.

Very nice sauce indeed. I added some minced garlic while melting the butter in pan. The extra sauce on the serving plate did not go to waste; we mopped it up with some french baguette. yummy!

Good, but not great...Followed recipe with a few of the suggestions and still this did nothing 4 me...I am not a huge asparagus fan, but hubby loves it!! He said it was ok - would probably make again, just not in our weekly or even monthly rotation! Thanks for sharing!

Didn't have balsamic vinegar so I subbed red wine vinegar and cut back a little on the soy. Very good.

This was amazing! Easy and so delicious. We loved it so much we have made it 3 times now; and each time it got rave reviews. This sauce is addictive...I usually double it and add a little bit of water as it was a trifle salty (but I used salted butter). One of my favorites for sure!

I give this five stars if you use 1 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp of soy sauce.  Be sure to brown the butter first! Very easy--I will definitely make this again!

Excellent, simple and different recipe.  Everyone loved it and thought that the sauce should be used throughout the entire meal...perhaps with chicken or pork.  Would be 5 stars but the baking time needs adjustment, as did doubling the balsamic.  With 2T. balsamic and 1T. soy sauce, the taste was much better. A definite keeper.

Everyone loved this on Easter.  I had to bake it a little bit longer (I think it's more of a guideline anyway....depends on how thick or thin your asparagus spears are.)  Also, I cooked sauce for a few minutes to reduce/thicken.  Very good and will definitely make it again!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  The asparagus baked nicely, and the sauce was fine.  I didn't find it outstanding though.  I felt like the taste of the sauce was overwhelmed by the natural flavor of the asparagus, and didn't add much to it. I probably could have been just as happy with plain roasted asparagus.

We have never been able to cook asparagus right - this turned out perfect! I did not have cooking spray so I drizzled olive oil over the asparagus before cooking.  I also switched the amounts of balsalmic vinegar and soy sauce - turned out perfect!

Very good and many compliments.  I didn't change anything, but I did add some olive oil to the asparagus when cooked since they were so thick.

I have never made asparagus before so I ran across this one and thought it sounded delightful.  My husband was about to protest at the thought of asparagus but I convinced him to try it with me and the kids.  After trying it, he asked if I could make more.  Great recipe and very easy too!

We love asparagus - and this was a great new twist on enjoying it!  I also doubled the butter & balasmic, browned the butter & reduced the balsamic (per another reviewer).  However, instead of pouring on the asparagus, I added the asparagus to the pan and let it simmer for a couple minutes before serving.  It was wonderful!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!  This is the best way to eat Asparagus!  I definitely flop the measurements to make with 1 TBSP of Balsamic & 1 TSP for Soy.  Before baking the asparagus I sometimes add 1 TSP of minced garlic to add a little more flavor.

This was fantastic! Such a simple dish.  I usually modify some of the recipes I get from allrecipes however, I didn't alter this one at all. I made it for company this past weekend and my  11 yr old ate most of it.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is a great addition to asparagus. It almost has an oriental flare, so may not be compatible with every entree, but definitely tasty. I love cooking the asparagus in the oven. I have been a chronic steamer and I love the crispness the oven gives it.

This made a good little sauce. I steamed the asparagus instead of baking it. I also used a little bit of the sauce on my chicken. A little goes a long way.

I would never think to mix balsamic vinegar and soy sauce! I really liked this recipe. The only addition I made to it was sprinkling the asparagus with about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar prior to baking. I don't know what it added to the recipe, but I am a huge fan of balsamic vinegars and wanted to make sure there was a little extra on there.

When adding your salt and pepper to taste, make sure you take into account the fact that you will be adding soy sauce later in the recipe. I was quite concerned that I had oversalted the asparagus when I tasted the sauce. I adjusted the sauce a biut to compensate by adding a smidge more butter adn balsamic. If you take the salt into account, I think this recipe is quick and easy to follow. Thanks!

I didn't think it was possible to improve on fresh picked asparagus, but this is the best we've ever had. I like to double the sauce so there is plenty for dipping.

The sauce was really good, tried it as others as suggested swapping the amounts of balsamic and soy.  I think this would be good on snow peas or snap peas also.

I loved how quick and easy this recipe was.  The balsamic vinegar and soy sauce gave it just enough extra flavor without overwhelming the taste of the asparagus.

This dish is so wonderful, and made asparagus-eaters out of my three kids.  I omit the soy sauce as I sprinkle the asparagus with kosher salt and pepper.  If you are not an asparagus fan, try this recipe!!

This is my primary way of making asparagus.  I flip-flip soy and vinegar measurements, and don't add salt.  I also cook the asparagus in the toaster oven.

This is one of my favs!  I've made it a bunch of times.  Side dish recipes get no easier than this.  Because the asparagus cooks in just the cooking spray, they come out nice and crispy every time!

I also followed several of the suggestions, browned the butter & only added 1 teaspoon of Soy Sauce & 2 tablespoons of Balsamic - however it seemed to taste more buttery than anything else - I'll definately use this one again, next time I'll probably follow the original recipe.

It was okay, I am new to cooking fresh asparagus ...thought I would try this out. Pretty good flavor but nothing special and maybe adjust how it is cooked..mine didn't come out very tender.

This was just a bit bland for my family. I did double the recipe, but only because I had two bundles of asparagus.  To put a little twist I toasted cashews, which did help with the blandness and added a nice crunch.

This is my standard way of cooking asparagus, but I really loved the addition of the soy sauce to the recipe. I also added some mushrooms that I had in the house for a wonderful side dish!

I made this recipe for Christmas last year and now EVERY holiday, it seems to be a given; that I am to bring the 'spargus (as my nephew fondly calls it)!  Big hit!  This sauce is good with salmon as well.  Thanks for such an outstanding compliment to asparagus!

Great easy sauce, but only needed a small fraction of the amount of sauce that was created for one bundle of asparagus. I used olive oil instead of butter to make the sauce.

Toasted at 350 for 30 minutes w/ my garlic bread, and it was fabulous!  I melted the butter for about 10 minutes over low (not sure if that "browned" it or not) and followed recipe exactly... yum yum yum!  (I also salt my asparagus very liberally!)

Good recipe. I had to use margarine instead of butter- turned out ok. My husband, who loves asparagus said it was too "vinagery" for  him.

This isn't bad, but either I used too little asparagus or that is a lot of sauce!  Bf liked it, but I'm on the fence. Maybe it's the asparagus we have, but it seems bitter to me.  I baked it 5 min on one side, then flipped and baked for another 5 min.  Worked perfectly.  Thanks.

A little strong, but just limit how much sauce you put on it.  My four year old son will eat a whole tray of asparagus if I serve it this way...

Mmmm, the asparagus was nice and tender yet crisp, too! This was a super easy compliment to the salmon I served it with. Make sure to brown the butter - it helps with the flavor.

This was very good. Not as good as doing them on the grill but close. I browned the butter like everyone said. I put the asparagus on the middle rack for 12 minutes. Then I turned on the broiler after 12 minutes and kept them under for about another 8 minutes to roast the tops. It was really good!!!

This is the only way we make asparagus anymore.  I always have the ingredients on hand, it is fast, and hard to mess up.  Non-asparagus lovers have been converted by this recipe!

This is my new favorite way to prepare asparagus. I was very skeptical of the vinegar, but figured all these people couln't be wrong. Thanks goodness I listened! I prepared it just as directed and it turned out great. My husband and I had it with a steak dinner and we both said we wished we had more asparagus! We ended up pouring the leftover sauce onto our steaks as a marinade. I highly reccomend this recipe. Thank you!

This was quite good! I followed the advice of other raters and used the 3 to 1 ratio of balsamic to soy sauce. I also doubled the asparagus and tripled the sauce mix to pour over the baked asparagus. Before baking, I sprinkled salt and pepper over the veggies. Would make again.

At higher altitude (8200 ft), I baked for 25 minutes, turning asparagus twice. You have to watch the baking depending on the thickness of the spears. 

Delicious! The sauce was really fantastic. I gotta tell ya, I was dubious about the ingredients coming together. But the results are absolutely perfect! You can use this sauce for other green veggies. Thank you for a tasty recipe!

This is a very good recipe. Only thing is, I lower the temperature on the oven and watch carefully as they tend to get crispy very easily.

This is hands down my favorite way to cook asparagus! One day I did accidently pick up to worcestershire sauce though instead of the soy sauce and it was equally good.

Made 3 bunches for Easter dinner and spread them out on a Texas sheet cake pan.  My husband doesn't like balsamic vinegar but he loved it mixed with the soy sauce eand butter.  Definitely will make again.

FABULOUS!  No changes (other than not really measuring anyhing as usual) and it was SO GOOD!  Will definitely make again, though my hubby's favorite is still grilled asparagus that's been marinated in italian.

I fixed this on Easter. It was a big hit! I reduced the butter to 1 Tbls. and  sprinkled it with toasted sesame seeds when I put it in the serving bowl to give it a more finished look. I will definitely make this again!

Very good.  I baked this at 350 for 15 minutes as I had somethig else in the oven at that temp.  The Asparagus came out great.  Since so many comments mentioned the vinegar and soy sauce raito and some mentioned it being in "Cooking Light" I checked that site.  There it says to use 2 tea. soy sauce and 1 tea. balsamic vinegar.  I used raspberry balsamic vinegar as that is all I had on hand.  It was good (I do want to try it with regular) and it had a bit of extra sweetness.

This was awesome.  I really had my doubts about this recipe as it just didn't seem like the sauce would compliment asparagus.  Boy was I wrong. I made this for easter dinner and everyone raved about it.  I switched the balsamic vinegar and soy sauce amounts as other suggested and browned the butter and it was so good.  I am actually going to make it again tonight.  Everyone wants me to make this for every holiday now.  12 minutes was the perfect cooking time as the asparagus was not mushy and not hard...it was firm but tender. Fantastic recipe

My mother made this for a side on Easter and I begged for the recipe. The next day I made for a non-Asparagus eater and he loved it!! Very fast and easy - will make again and again!! I use 1 tsp soy sauce to every tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.

and it was perfect. Thanks CAE for the recipe.

I've never baked asparagus before, but this is easy! The taste was rather bland.. I may double the sauce the next time? I made the sauce on the microwave.. maybe that was the problem?

The taste of the asparagus/sauce flavoring was great. I don't what I did wrong but the asparagus was a bit stringy.
I'll try it again and see what happens.
Any ideas about the stringy asparagus?

If I could give this more stars I would!  I switched the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar around and doubled the recipe.  Definitely brown the butter.  This is an excellent recipe and if I could drink the sauce I would.  It is that yummy!!!

This is my absolute favorite recipe!! I've made it on several occasions, its absolutely delicious. I've actually tweaked it a little: I place the asparagus in an aluminum pan in the oven at 350 degrees for about 30-40 minutes. The asparagus never turns crisp, it's very tender!! I highly recommend this recipe, you won't regret it!

Fantastic.
Traditionally, I've cut, boiled, and sprayed with 2 sprits of butter.
This is so much better.
Try more balsamic and less soy.  Even try a low soy.

Very tasty, and so easy to make!  I substituted half the butter for olive oil.  Next time I will bake for less time for a more al dente texture.

Quick, simple and delicious!  Sprayed the asparagus with cooking oil and added some fresh ground pepper and granulated garlic, baked for about 14 mins (they were somewhat thick!).  Heated about 1 1/2 tbs of unsalted butter and then added the balsamic and low sodium tamari (soy).  Drizzled over asparagus and thoroughly enjoyed!  Will definitley make again!

My father-in-law hates asparagus and not knowing that I made this recipe for dinner when he was over and everyone is still talking about how it is the only time he ever ate asparagus and liked it! 

I added some white wine vinegar and basalmic dressing instead of the red wine vinegar and cut down on the oil. It was delicious. 

Also good on Swiss Chard topped with a clean filet.

This was a little funky tasting.  I think it was the butter.  I browned the butter, as suggested, but it still was strange tasting.  Maybe I'll sprinkling Olive Oil on the asparagus while cooking and just add the soy sauce and vinegar, omitting butter.

I baked the asparagus for about 20 minutes, versus the 12 they ask for.  My father likes them a little softer.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it tasted just a little greesy, even though I used I can't believe it's not butter light.

Our family loved this recipe.  I did increase the balsamic vinegar to 1 tablespoon, and added a pinch of minced fresh garlic to the sauce.  It was a very easy recipe, and I'll be using it again soon.

I like my asparagus steamed rather than baked, but I did use the balsamic butter sauce portion of this recipe and drizzled it over the asparagus when it was done. Great recipe.

I made this last night and we all loved it!  I browned the 2 Tbsp. of butter first then added 2 tbsp. of balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp. of soy sauce.  Other reviews suggested more vinegar than soy sauce and they were right!  This went very well with my onion crusted chicken (used French's fried onions) and uncle ben's rice pilaf.  Before the meal I served up the delicious Corn and Crab Bisque (recipe on this website by tattoochicc).  It's all good!

Everyone loved this. I used a tbsp. of balsamic vinegar. The flavoring was subtle and didn't overwhelm the flavor of the asparagus. We like our asparagus a little softer so I cooked them for 15 mins.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a hit; my mom loves asparagus and has made it several times before and even she asked me for this recipe.  I took the advise of others and slightly burned the butter and doubled the amount of balsamic vinegar.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I made it for our Christmas Eve dinner, and it was loved by all.  I adapted the recipe by using a tablespoon of balsamic, and I didn't have cooking spray so I drizzled the asparagus with olive oil.  Someone mentioned to brown the butter, and I agree. This added great flavor.

I don't even like asparagus and I loved this recipe!

I made this a little different because I made it on the stovetop. I figured why dirty another dish? So, I sauteed my asparagus in a little olive oil and garlic powder until tender,and removed from pan.  I then followed the recipe for the "sauce" as directed.  It was wonderful!  I agree with a previous poster that letting the butter get a little brown added a nice flavor!

Thank you so much for sharing...this was a great recipe!  I can't wait to try this with green beans...I bet spinach would even taste great!

This was great!  Next time I'll steam them for a bit before I put them in the oven. I followed the recipe instructions and thought it was wonderful without changing the balsamic vinegar and soy sauce.  I'll definitely make this one again.

I followed this recipe to a "T", and it was great. I'll be making it again and again! PS If you serve this with roated potatoes you can dip the potatoes in the sauce, which is also quite good! You could use this sauce for a lot of things actually!

Great recipe just as is. So quick and easy!!! But if you wanted to play with it, add a little less butter and make the balsamic to butter ratio 2:1 instead of 1:1.  But very good, would serve to dinner guests.

Great!  I did not use the soy sauce.  But I dash some seasalt on the spear prior to putting them in the oven.  My husband loved it and was sad we did not have more.

This was so simple and absolutely delicious!! We had this with steak and the two complimented each other wonderfully and our company loved it. I almost forgot the salt and pepper on top before putting it in the oven, not sure it would have been as great without it. I will be making this again and again!!

Delicious   Ok - my asparagus went bad and I didn't want to go to the store so I used broccoli instead. I boiled the broccoli for 5 minutes. I also switched the amounts for the vinegar and the soy sauce.

Lynn, I didn't even realize I knew you when I made this recipe! This was the first time I had ever made/eaten asparagus and it was WONDERFUL! I feel like I've been missing out my whole life on a green vegetable that I actually like ;) Bravo! Great recipe!

Great taste, I had to make a double batch, so I decided to make 1 just as the recipes stated, and the other with the suggestions about more vinegar, than soy. I actually liked the original recipe best. I just used low salt soy and it was perfect. Thanks for a great way to serve asparagus. A definate keeper

These asparagus were fantastic!! 'the flavor of the butter sauce is perfectly matched with the asparagus. I will, however, try brushing them with EVOO instead of the cooking spray.

Very easy and very tasty. I did as other reviewers and swapped the amounts for the balsamic vinegar and soy sauce since I'm a fan of balsamic vinegar. Served this with grilled pork tenderloin and baked sweet potates.

so very simple and so very yummy.  Asparagus were perfectly tender crisp.  Very little sauce goes a long way.

Very good!  I use 1 tablespoon of basalmic (because we love that flavor) and it's delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is my new favorite way to cook asparagus.  It is simple and tastes great.  Even my husband who does not like asparagus will eat it this way.

I ran out of time and had to saute the asparagus in the butter, instead of roasting in the oven, and I poured the sauce over, covered & let it steam for about 3-4 minutes. It was awesome. I love asparagus, but the sauce was incredible with a wonderful rich flavor, reminiscent of au jus. My 94 year-old Mom loved it--she asked me what was in the sauce, and when I told her, commented that I had become a gourmet cook--the ultimate compliment!

I don't really like asparagus, but I made this for an Easter dinner and everyone there LOVED THIS!  I followed other member's suggestions and swapped the amounts of basalmic and soy.  I also sprinkled the asparagus with Kosher Salt prior to putting it in the oven.

We really enjoyed this recipe! We have been eating asparagus every day since it appeared in the grocery store in March! I am always looking for new ways to fix it, and this one was good! I did as some other reviewers said, and changed the amount of soy sauce vs. balsamic vinegar, making the vinegar 1T. and the soy sauce 1t. I did add some garlic powder to it, and we really liked that, though I should have used fresh garlic, and added it towards the end of the sauce cooking time, as it got a little bitter. 

I will save this recipe, and use it often. Thank you for posting it!

Very tasty!  My husband hates both balsamic vinegar and asparagus, yet loved this dish.  Those of us who like asparagus loved it as well. I used less vinegar than called for though.  Highly recommend!

Was pretty liberal with the kosher salt, and used a T. of vinegar.  Easy, and my husband and I both thought it was very good.

Plate-lickin' good! No, seriously! I found that thin asparagus only needs to bake for about 10 minutes, and the sauce can be microwaved instead of getting out a pan. I skipped the salt and used low-sodium soy sauce, and it was perfect.

This is so delicious!  My husband doesn't even like asparagus and he really enjoyed this dish.  I made it the other night for me and my daughter and didn't even use the butter/balsamic mixture and it was just as good.  Baked with some salt and pepper.  YUM!!

I was so excited to make this-I followed this recipe exactly.  It did not live up to the reviews.  Maybe it would be more flavorful if it was marinated in the sauce beforehand, then topped w/it afterward? Not worth wasting the ingredients.

WOW!!! Loved it! Hubby says it's the best asparagus he's ever had. I am emailing my mom and sister the recipe right now. The only thing I did different was add a little garlic powder with the salt and pepper before baking. yum, yum!!

I wasn't sure how I would like this especially since you spray it with PAM, but it came out excellent.  If you like your asparagus soft, you may want to cook a little longer.  15 min. was perfect for us.

I made this recipe a couple of times since my first rating, and I think it is good for people who don't like asparagus, but for people who like it, it masks the natural flavor too much.

I use this butter/soy sauce for any vegetables now! Today I am baking brussel sprouts, zucchini and yam potatoes and coat them with this balsamic sauce after baking on the pan.
Butter makes the roasted veggies look so glossy and yummy!

I liked this recipe, but I prefer the taste of just plain baked asparagus with a little salt and pepper.  I don't think the flavor is worth the extra calories from the butter.

this is great - heat the butter just until it turns a golden brown - this gives the recipe a lovely nutty flavor.

I love asparagus and this is a unique and delicious way to prepare it.  The recipe is so simple and I love the salty flavor of the balsamic and soy.  This asparagus is great served with parmesan breaded chicken or steak.

I didn't think one could improve on steamed asparagus with butter & salt. I was wrong. I swear I will never steam or boil my asparagus again--baking it is so delicious. The butter/soy/balsamic sauce is incredible. Sometimes I use just soy sauce + balsamic vinegar, if I want to cut calories. My husband goes crazy for this recipe, and that's saying a LOT....it's a *green vegetable*!! :)

Make sure you use fresh asparagus, I think our experience was tainted.  However, overall flavor was good.

What a great way to prepare asparagus.  I was tired of steaming it...or often over steaming it.  I did use reduced sodium soy sauce (always do) and used two bunches of asparagus.  Very tasty.  Thanks.

This is a really great, simple recipe.  I had been making my asparagus in white wine from another recipe on this site and my husband has requested that I only use this one from now on.  Even my kids eat it up in seconds.

This is very good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is a bit too salty, but probably using low sodium soy sauce will help.  I will make it again though, my family liked the flavor of the sauce and if was very easy to make.

This was sooo yummy - I loved the flavor and roasting is for sure the best way to prepare asparagas.  Can't wait to try the sauce on other veggies like green beans or even brussle sprouts! Thanks!

Roasting the asparagus is brillant!  Each piece cooked evenly and had great flavor.  The sauce was so tasty.  Worked well for my dinner for 10 people.

This was good. I used margarine instead of butter to try to make it healthier.  It didnt have a strong flavor (maybe because I didnt use butter.)

This was the easiest recipe to jazz up the flavor of asparagus.  Following others that posted, I switched the amounts of soy and balsamic.  It was great! Asparagus was perfectly cooked and had perfect flavor.  Will definitely use again.

It was not bad as written (I think the suggestion to invert the amounts of soy and balsamic was NOT an alternative - I tried it both ways) but not great.  I will be making asparagus another way,  sorry!

OH MY GOODNESS!  This is my most favorite recipie that I've found on this site so far.  This is so incredibly simple, yet so unique and elegant.  (We always had Holandaise sauce with asparagus, so this is new for me!) I'm eager to try this sauce on other veggies, too.

Delicious!  Watch out for the salt and pepper "to taste" -- I used too much salt, but that was my fault, not the recipe's.  Next time I'll omit the salt, it really wasn't needed at all with the soy sauce.

We thought this was pretty salty, but the idea is good.  Will probably bake asaparagus this way in the future, but would have to find an alternative sauce or experiment with reducing the amount of soy.  Leftovers were definitely not very good, but tolerable.

I can hardly believe how good this is!  This sauce also works well on lightly cooked greens.  It also works well to melt the butter in the microwave and mix the vinegar and soy sauce in the same cup for easier clean up.

I will never steam asparagus again!!  I used garlic infused cooking spray, and also reduced the margarine to 1T, and the soy to 1t.  I increased the balsamic vinegar to 1T, and used a lemon infused balsamic (Trader Joes).  Yummy!

My new favorite way to make (and eat) asparagus!  As previous reviewers suggested, I browned the butter, and put 1 T balsamic vinegar and 1 t soy sauce.  I ate the first batch entirely by myself!

We thought this was very good!  I usually make asparagus with more of a creamy sauce but this was a great twist to my traditional!

This was really good--a nice change from boring steamed or sauted asparagus. I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce. I would definitely make this again.

This was very tasty, but I'm not sure if I could really taste the flavor of the balsamic vinegar. Next time I think I'll add more.

Lovely recipe Cae. I steamed my vegies instead of baking them as I wanted the texture to be tender crisp. We love balsamic vinegar and it really helped to make a most delicious sauce. Thanks so much!

Good stuff!! I baked a tad longer & nuked the butter in the microwave instead of on the stove. Used olive oil spray. Great easy recipe- thanks!

So good.  Thanks to all who suggested browning the butter and using kosher salt.  I also drizzled with olive oil instead of spraying with cooking spray.  Will make again for sure!

This was very easy to make, and came out great! I later made the sauce again and used it for green beans and it tasted just as good! Who would have thought that balsamic vinigar & soya sauce work well together!

Not bad.  I found that spears tasted better after they were allowed to sit a few minutes in the glaze and absorb the flavors.
