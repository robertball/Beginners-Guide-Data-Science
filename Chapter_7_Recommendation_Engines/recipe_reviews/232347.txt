These whoopie pies are awesome!  I gave only 4 stars because they need more filling....next time I will double the filling recipe.  Overall, they are delish!  :)

Very easy recipe, but like one of the other reviewers, I ran out of filling.  I would say that 1.5 times the filling would be absolutely perfect!  I also only cooked the cookies/cake for 8 minutes and that was spot on.

These are delightful!  The amount of filling is just right if you follow the recipe and use the amount specified.  This is a keeper!

This was not a good recipe. The cookie is dry and the cream was too runny. The cookies looked horrible with the cream in the middle; the cream wouldnâ€™t set and kept running down the bottom cookie. My kids liked the taste, but I thought it was just so so since the cookie was dry.

We liked this! We made a little extra filling and found that it was too much for our liking. We also added a 1/4 teaspoon mint extract and some oreo crumbs for texture! Rich and delicious.
