This was good and easy.  BUT, next time, I will make a syrup of the brown sugar/pineapple juice/ginger ale before pouring it over.  It was sweet, but it would have been better if it was more of a glaze.

I've been making ham like this for years.  As another poster suggested - Vernors Ginger Ale is best but I think it's a Michigan-based pop.  Didn't have it in IL.  But if you can find it - it's awesome.  Great for reheating leftover ham.....gently simmer in the Vernors - easy ham and great tasting.

Very good and very easy to prepare. Perfect for holiday dinners. Made it for Easter and I'll be making it again for Christmas!

My Father had made this every Easter for years.  Also excellent is using a bone-in Ham and basting every 20 minutes until finished.  We live in the Philadelphia area and our favorites were Franks Golden ginger ale.  2 generations love this recepie.

I make ham in a similar way and this is very yummy- I let the ham bake a little longer and mix the ginger ale/pineapple juice basting juices and drippings with a can of cream of mushroom soup for a wonderful gravy.

I made this for Christmas and it was very good. I combined the brown sugar, pineapple juice and ginger ale before pouring over the ham and basted every 30 minutes. I also used a butt portion ham and Bleinheim's Ginger Ale. Will be using this again at Easter. I wonder how it would work on the grill and use the juice mixture as a basting sauce?

This is really good.  A suggestion--If you can get Vernor's Ginger Ale, use that.  Oh my! what a flavor.  A glaze of the ingredients that another reviewer wrote would be perfect.

This was a great holiday ham recipe.  It was moist and tender and had great flavor.  I left the leftover ham in the gingerale bath in the fridge and it continued to be delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe seemed easy enough. I followed it exactly but the ham curled up and was EXTREMELY DRY.  I retried the recipe, but did not remove the foil for the last 20 minutes, as the recipe instructed.  What a difference!  The second try was a hit with my family.  They suggested I thank you after the second try, so thanks BCORTE for sharing!

The whole fam loved this one!!  I've made it with a couple 2-ish pound, fully cooked turkey hams that I sliced up. I also like to use crushed or chunk pineapple instead of sliced because every slice of ham gets some pineapple with it. The liquid/sauce in the pan is great served over mashed potatoes or rice!

I cut up a spiral 5-pound ham and placed it in the slow cooker, following the directions for layering, etc.  Cooked it on high for about 1.5 hours.  It was the most delicious ham I had ever tasted, and the family agreed.  So easy to serve, too.  Thank you!  Note:  I did not need a whole liter of soda... two cans probably would have been enough.

I like this--I added some clove  and boiled the mix before adding it to the ham. I also added cornstarch to make it thicker before baking.

I've been making this for years.  I use a can of crushed pineapple, which I mix with the ginger ale and the brown sugar and I leave the spiral cut ham on the bone and separate each layer and add the pineapple goodness between each layer.  It is always a hit.

I will never fix a ham the old way again. This is amazing. For me it's so much easier to already have the ham sliced while it's still cold. I had a packet of sugar glaze that came with the ham so I used 1/3 of the packet mixed with the brown sugar.  Everyone loved it. I kept the liquid and served it as a gravy and that was also a hit. I bet this works well with pork chops! Hummm, I'll let you know. Happy Holidays to all and thank you for sharing this recipe!

Thank you for a yummy easy way to bake ham.  I usually dry out my ham but this time the slices were moist and tender.

Excellent!!  I've made this several times and is always a hit!  My husband requests this often. It's so easy to make...I use Vernors ginger ale. I also pour most of the pineapple juice in the mixture.

I used a smoked boneless ham and prepared according to the recipe.  The pineapple juice and ginger ale completely washed out all of the salt and flavor of the meat. Will never use this recipe again.

@CookInterest -- You didn't even make the recipe. Why are you reviewing it?  :-)   If it seems like it wouldn't fit your meal choices, please keep searching for a recipe you like better. Everyone is entitled to their own food choices. Some people have loved this, others have not, but at least they tried it before writing a review. Bashing someone's recipe that you didn't even make is just peremptory and bad-mannered. I hope you found a recipe for ham that you liked, that fit the nutritional profile you want for your family.

This was delicious and oh so easy. I made it exactly as directed, except I used an 8.5-lb ham and (sort of) increased the other ingredients accordingly. I also didn't measure the brown sugar, but with ham I figure more is better :) It turned out moist and fabulous!

I used this on our Christmas Day ham and it was FABULOUS! Since it was a whole ham, I spiked it with whole cloves around the top and used fresh pineapple (that I cut into rings and placed on top of the ham). I mixed the brown sugar into the ginger ale (Vernors of course) and poured that overtop and let it drain into the bottom of the pan where I placed some pineapple chunks. Every 10 minutes I basted with the juice from the bottom of the pan, adding more gingerale as needed. This was the BEST ham I have ever made. It wasn't too sweet (we don't like that) and the cloves weren't over-powering and the best part was that the ham was so juicy!! I will make ham like this from now on.

I made this today for the first time. I made a syrup out of the brown sugar and pineapple juice,then poured the Vernor s Ginger Ale over it. I did not have enough aluminum foil,so I used a Turkey cooking  bag. It made clean a breeze,and nothing got dried out. This is definitely a keeper of a recipe.

I made no other changes to the recipe other than not measuring the brown sugar (I'm estimating I used about 1 cup total) and it was absolutely perfect!  I'm a Vernors fan anyway and used 2 cans regular Vernors.  I believe Diet Vernors wouldn't have made any change at all due to the fact I was using pineapple and the juice as well as brown sugar.  This one is a keeper and will be used from now on in this household.  Bravo!

Turned out great! I cooked this dish for the first time for about 25 people, and I got nothing but compliments... What I did was: First, I used a fresh pineapple and cut off all the skins, put the middle of the pineapple aside. I then squeezed out the juice from the skins into a dish, added one cup of brown sugar and about 2 cups of ginger ale, mixed it all together to create a sauce. I then cut up the ham and placed it in the casserole dish, and poured the sauce over the ham. I filled the dish with more gingerale until it reached half way of the casserole dish. I sprinkled brown sugar over the ham on top and I took the pineapple cut it in slices and spread about 4 across the top, took the left over pineapple and cut it into smaller pieces and sprinkled around the edge. Baked it as suggested and !VOILA! Delicious!

Just a note, if you want the meat to be extremely tender/fall apart, cook it for an hour (covered) and 1/2 hour uncovered. I personally do not care for it as much that way because I think it is almost too mushy, but many others seem to like it that way!

Turned out great! Slightly sweet but not too much. I didn't have any ginger ale (and I don't really like it) so I swapped it for 7-Up and it was still delicious. The only change I would make next time is to use more pineapple.

It was OK..a little too sweet and probably just baking spiral ham would have been easier but just as good.

We served this as a holiday meal and really liked the overall flavor that the ginger ale, pineapple an brown sugar(I cut back a little) provided. I also liked the fact that I could trim  the fat prior cooking---- quite delicious actually!

This tasted wonderful prepared exactly as written!!  Yum!  I only gave it four stars because although the taste was outstanding, the texture of the thin, spiral sliced ham was dry...next time, I'll buy the 4 lb. ham whole and slice it into thick pieces myself.

I'll never make ham any other way.  Easy and tasty.  I didn't use a spiral cut ham.  I cooked my ham the day before.  Easter morning, we sliced it and pepared it per recipe.  Wonderful.

Delicious! Perfect for our Christmas dinner! My husband followed the recipe and used Diet Ginger Ale. We cooked the ham in a roasting pan. It looked so pretty that I will use this recipe for company. All 4 kids liked it too-added bonus! Leftovers will be great in sub sandwiches!

This was very good. The only problem my girlfriend and I had was the pan we cooked it in wasn't deep enough, so I almost got a hot ginger ale bath.

I liked the flavor of the juices but was surprised and disappointed that the ham was a little dry....how could that happen?  It wasn't dry before I cooked it and it didn't cook very long. Wasn't a hit at this house.  Hopefully the many leftovers will be good.

Thank-you for this delicious ham recipe.  After reviewing the comments I have decided to give it a try for the holidays.  It sounds so easy but moist and delicious, too.  I think this is just what I have been looking for.  Thanks again.

Tender, flavorful and easy to make.  Next time I might try with 2 cans of pineapple and omit the ginger ale.

To spice it up a bit I included a couple of shakes of red chili peppers to each layer... Sweet and spicy is a good combo with this delish recipe...

Used fresh pineapple (chunks) so it required more Ginger Ale. Made a half recipe with Boars Head sweet ham in glass loaf pan (4 layers). Also added fresh mushrooms to  to each layer. The ham came out fall apart and quite tasty over rice.  There are only two of us so had left overs, from which I drained the Ginger Ale the next day and loaded the pineapple, ham, some more fresh mushroom and Mozzarella onto a Home Run brand frozen cheese pizza. With just a couple of extra minutes bake time, we had the best Hawaiian pizza, very good!

This was tasty. I admit that I made some changes: I used fresh pineapple and its juice (it had been sliced a few days earlier so had plenty of juice), but only about 1/3 of a cup, cut into very small pieces, and I cut way back on the sugar (maybe 1/4 cup) and ginger ale (I used about 6 oz).  I also added a handful of pecans to the baking dish.  I had scalloped potatoes in the oven at 450, so I cooked the ham at 450 too, for 1/2 hour, with foil placed loosely on top for the first 15 minutes.  It was plenty sweet and moist, but the sauce wasn't thick enough. Next time, I will replace the ginger ale with a little grated, fresh ginger to further reduce the sugar and liquid while amping up the ginger flavor.  4 stars intead of 5 because of the excessive amount of sugar in the recipe.

Tried this as a glaze over the spiral ham and then stuck it in the crock  pot.  Used the pineapple as garnish on the ham.  Was delicious, but I might have cooked too long.  A bit on the dry side, but will try a bit less next timel.
