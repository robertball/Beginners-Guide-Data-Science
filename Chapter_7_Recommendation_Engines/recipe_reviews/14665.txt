Great easy recipe!  I used fresh tarragon and as I didn't have any unsalted butter on hand, just used salted butter and omitted adding any salt. I stole an idea from another recipe by arranging on a 12" piece of plastic wrap, leaving 3" at either end and rolling before refrigerating.  This way made it easy to cut into nice size 'pats' for serving on top of the steak.  I will use this recipe again and again!

Guests loved this butter served with a crusty garlic bread.  I thought the shallots might make it too chuncky but chunky was good.  Great recipe!

I agree with the previous reviewer that this is like a Bernaise sauce. Very nice, put on a grilled filet mignon.

This was absolutely perfect! I had been looking for a good tarragon butter recipe and this was exactly what I was thinking. I made the recipe as is and wouldn't change a thing. I served it over steaks and it was mouthwatering!!! I did take another users advice and rolled it on a sheet of plastic wrap before refrigerating. This made it easy to cut once it was hard.

This is a good recipe. It tastes just like bearnaise sauce, just a different consistency. The only change I would make is add less shallots next time.

Nice spread for crostini or toasted french bread or to top grilled meat.  I will back off of the amount of pepper a bit in the future, as it was just a little overpowering for us. Loved the shallots.
