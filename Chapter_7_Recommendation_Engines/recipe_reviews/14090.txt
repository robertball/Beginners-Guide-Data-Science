I would rename this recipe "San Antonio" as opposed to Mexican.  Being Mexican myself and making this rice or eating it from relatives in Old Mexico, the recipe does not call for all that spice nor peppers, much less all that tomato sauce.  Less than 1 can is enough if you use tomato sauce.  And the rice is supposed to be sauteed with the onion in the oil.  It sounds good, but I don't think it's kid friendly.  It's just another Tex-Mex variation of the traditional recipe.

I'm never using boxed red beans and rice to go with Mexican food again!  In the past I was a little lost as to what to serve with tacos, or fajitas but now I have an answer.  This was really easy, and it tasted a lot like the mexican rice we eat at a Mexican restaurant in my area.  Of course, I can't afford saffron, so I omitted it but other than that the ingredients were pretty normal and easy to find.  And no one was repulsed by green peppers, which the kids have a problem with every time we sit down to eat.

This was ok but I have had better. It was  easy. The cook time listed is too long 25-30 min. is more then enough time.

This was the better than the restaurants serve! I only used 1 can of tomato sauce and I used calrose rice. (I've made this numerous times, only so-so with white rice, awesome made with calrose or basmati...different texture depending on rice and whether you sautee it first before adding the liquid.) I use turmeric instead of saffron. (have you seen the cost of that stuff?!!!) This was delicious! My new favorite mexican rice recipe, yeah, it's THAT GOOD!

Wonderful recipe. I have been looking for a recipe that resembles restaurant mexican rice and now I have found it.  One thing that I recommend is not to stir at all once the rice is in the simmering stage.  DO NOT STIR OR EVEN LIFT THE LID if you want perfect rice.  My whole family loved it.

I started out with leftover Chinese take-out rice so I had to modify the cooking directions. I sauteed the peppers, onions and garlic in butter, then added the cooked rice and the remaining ingredients, using just a little water. The chipotle chili powder I used is hotter than regular old chili powder, so I used just 1/4 of the amount called for and it was plenty spicy for us. The saffron wasn't noticeable so I don't know that I would even bother to include it. I simmered this for just about 10 minutes or so just to meld the flavors. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I'm not fussy about what you call this, or whether or not it's authentic.  What's important to me is that it tastes good - and it did.

This is the best version of Mexican Rice I've tried.  It's absolutely fantastic.  I like to substitute chopped stewed tomatoes (or fresh if they're in season) instead of the tomato sauce.  Also be sure to use an oil that does not overpower the dish.  Be sure to use the saffron.  There have been a couple other reviewers who haven't used it.  You have too...otherwise it's like making a lemon dill sauce without the dill (well, almost).  Thanks Ginger.

THANK YOU GINGER for sharing this recipe! I have been looking for a mexican rice recipe forever to no avail.  I added a tsp of taco seasoning and sprinkled some cheese at the end to melt! Very good and is a wonderful side dish to one of the many mexican lasagna recipes also found on this site.  Will make again and again!

This recipe was outstanding! I used Basmati rice as that was the rice that was available to me here in the Netherlands. I have never had a mexican rice recipe come out this good! It was moist and very flavorful. I would not change a thing. It is definitely a keeper and my guests and family loved it! Thank you Ginger for a terrific recipe! Nice to get a touch of tex-mex from an uprooted Texan in Holland.

I made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe as shown.  My husband ate it every day - loves it. 
 
The second time I increased the onion and garlic and increased the chile powder to heaping tsp, used only 1 tsp salt instead of 2, replaced the water with homemade chicken broth.  I like most recipes very full flavored and the additions did the trick.  Oh, I also used about 1 cup left over canned tomatoes with juice and 3 Roma tomatoes chopped up. This recipe is so easy to adjust flavors to your personal tastes.   Thanks so much Ginger.

I made this last night and it was very good!  I omitted the green pepper and onion as the freaks in my house (aka, my husband and son) won't touch them.  I was a bit concerned about how much water to add as a result of less substance in the pan - I added a cup and a half and it worked out perfectly.  I ended up needing a few extra minutes to cook - total of 45, I believe.  I'll definitely make this again!

Very good and easy.  Finished my off in the oven at 350F.  Might try to thin the tomato sauce by a 1/4 of a cup with water next time.  Very tomato tasting.

This was delicious and very close to the mixes I get in the box. However, it was a little salty, so I would cut down on that. Next time I will only use 1 can of tomato sauce or less, so that it won't get too tomato-ey. I didn't have any saffron so I didn't use any. I used brown rice, and it came out just fine. Overall, great-- thanks!

My boyfried really liked this.  I'm not a fan of spicy food, so this was a little too hot for my britches!  I didn't have saffron on hand, but would like to try it for next time.

Way too much salt. It was good otherwise, but tasted a bit of flavor overload which is uncommon for me to find. I didn't use green peppers as I was out, otherwise followed reciepe.

Great recipe! I am thinking I might try adding ground beef one time for something different.  I wanted to let others know that if you are having a hard time finding Saffron you can look in the section of your grocery store that has the small "bags" of mexican spices. They are cheaper and I found my Saffron today for $1.  I read that some people were concerned about the salt, I added the tomato sauce with No Salt Added. That will cut down a little of the salt anyway.  Thanks for the recipe Ginger. It's a keeper.

I CHANGED THIS A BIT BECAUSE OF WHAT I HAD ON HAND..I USED ROTEL INSTEAD OF TOMATOE SAUCE AND CHICKEN BROTH INSTEAD OF WATER. I ALSO ADDED SOME FAT FREE SHREDDED CHEDDAR CHEESE. IT WAS A LITTLE SPICY BECAUSE OF THE ROTEL BUT I LIKE SPICY FOOD SO I LIKED IT.

This was nothing like the Mexican rice we get at our local Mexican restaurants in NC.  It just tasted like tomato rice. I was not happy with this at all.

This recipe is easy, and fun to play with and adjust.  I use it now with Vigo, instead of saffron (easier on the pocketbook, and with all the strong flavors in the vegs and spices, I can't tell a difference.)  I also use Rotel tomatoes, and whatever veggies I have in the fridge that need to be used up. Thanks for this basic recipe.

Excellent recipe. I used Rotel tomatoes.  Saffron is usually found in the spice section of any grocery store.  Although expensive, a little goes a very long way!

excellent recipe, but use a non stick pan so you need barely any oil...and you'll have to get more creative with the additions to the rice, or it's a little bland.  I added corn, jalapeno, anaheim, and red peppers, zucchini, and extra tomato, black beans, and hot sauce to the mix.
I served it with sour cream on top and drizzled with...lime!

This recipe has become a favorite at my house.  I had a hard time finding Saffron so I substituted 1 packet of Goya's Con Azafran spice for the cumin and saffron.  I prefer to use Mexican Styled Stewed Tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce.  My mom also likes to add a can of pink beans when you pour in the water.  Thank you Ginger!

I changed this recipe around a bit, but the end result was great... I would say what and how I changed it, but that's not how I cook... at least the first time.

Thanks for a great recipe. I had to add a little water to thin it right before serving, but otherwise great flavor.

This was good! I enjoy saffron rice's often, and I liked it's addition to this Mexican-type rice:it gave it a little more flavor. Will make again not only because it was good, but also because the Saffron cost $14.-  and I want to use before it goes bad :).

Better than all boxed mexican rice that I've tried. I substitute the extra 1/2 can of tomato sauce with a 14oz can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. I usually find that I have to add extra liquid near the end of cooking time. My only complaint is that I wish the rice  turned out more fluffy and less thick and mushy. But this doesn't stop me from making it over and over.

Rice was too salty, I think 1 tsp would have been enough.  But otherwise was good, and would make it again with less salt.

Great! Variations:  I omitted the saffron. I used small can of diced green chilies instead of green peppers.  Used only 1 can of tomato sauce.  Turned out great. I served this with Tacos and mexican corn cake.

this was ok. it looked pretty - also added a little yellow pepper. it was easy and came out good, but with out much of a kick like the prepared ones. i think i would add a little medium or hot salsa in the simmer process next time.

Simple and flavourful rice dish.  Instead of tomatoe sauce, I used pureed salsa, which gave this dish a really nice flavour.  I didn't have any saffron, so I used tumeric.  This went really well with my mexican themed lunch today!

This is the recipe that the Tex-Mex dinners use...finally found it! It's not in many mexican cook books..Its so basic all the Mamma's just knew how to make it!Thank you Ginger! The only thing I added was a half of can of green peas. And Enchalada sauce might work for the tomato sauce without the chili powder...Will need to try it!

I made this for a staff luncheon today and it was a hit.  It actually tasted better after it had been in a crock pot a couple of hours to keep it warm - it was just a touch to soupy when it was first made.  I like the flavor of the saffron in it.

This recipe was excellent and super easy to make.  My husband and I both loved it and will definitely have it again soon.  I omitted the saffron.  I  didn't  have any saffron, and my neighborhood grocery store does not carry it.  I will make a note to pick it up at a larger store.  It was still awesome!

I used homemade sofrito in place of the onion, green pepper & garlic. I used sazon in place of the saffron threads & Abobo in place of the salt. I left out the tomato sauce, cumin and chili powder. I then ended up with our family thought was a five star recipe!

I loved this rice!  I've tried many boxed rice, and finally gave up (I'm a lazy cook).  This recipe look simple enough so I gave it a try.  So glad I did!  I only omitted the green pepper for personal preference.  Since we have taco night once a week in my home we will be eating this often!

I liked the rice that I made.  But, I did alter the receipe.  I did not have the Mexican saffron, so I did not use saffron.  I used short grain brown rice.  I only had one 8 oz can of tomato sauce, so I added two large chopped Roma tomatoes.  I also added 1/2 jalepano pepper finely chopped.  I also cut the salt in half and used 1 teaspoon of Kosher salt.  I also used a red bell pepper instead of a green bell pepper.  Brown rice takes longer to cook than white rice, so it simmered for about 35 minutes.  My family really liked the rice.  I will make it again with the alterations that I made.

This rice was pretty tasty. I would recommend cutting down on the salt (2 teaspoons is a lot.) I also didnt have saffron on hand, but would try to use it the next time I make this.

This is very good but couldn't find powered or ground saffron in my store.  I also used DMonte Stewed Tomatoes (Mexican)with less tomatoe sauce.  Next time, I'm going to add less water and hope the rice is fluffier rather than moist as I prefer rice fluffy.

I made it with a jar of hot salsa instead of the tomato sauce - it turned out great - but a bit hot!  Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll definitely use the salsa again but I'll miss out the chili powder.

My 10-yr old son told me to rate this a 10-star recipe!  It has the perfect bite, is flavorful, and is a great "base" for adding vegetables and beans so he can have a healthy meal (he is a vegetarian).  He had 3 servings tonight and can't wait to have it again tomorrow with the extras added in.  Thank you!

This rice was fairly tasty, but not quite as flavorful as I expected. I added chicken bouillon to the water as others have suggested, along with garlic salt, green chilis, and diced tomatoes. A good basic recipe, but needs some additional seasonings, I think. I have tried several rice recipes from this site, but I still think the best and most flavorful is Mexican Rice II.

Great rice!! I served this with Enchiladas II recipe found on this site(which I've made many times and my family loves). Delicious...I found regular saffron instead of the powdered and used several strands of that. I think next time I will cut the recipe in half since this made a lot of rice for a family of 3. Otherwise this recipe stays in my collection. Tastes like the rice you get in a Mexican restaurant. Thanks Ginger!!

This recipe was great- I substituted red bell peppers for the green peppers and added red pepper for more spice.  This is definitely worth making again!

Excellent flavour.  I gave it a little extra kick by adding a dash of hot sauce.  Also added some drained, canned corn.  Went very well with fajitas.

It was great. Used brown rice because I a diabetic. Used just 1 can tomato sauce. Added cilantro and served with pork tenderloin off the grill. We will make this a regular.

I made this and it is excellent. I used brown rice instead, which I prefer.  I didn't use Saffron though (too pricey), seasoned 2 tsps of taco seasoning instead. Also I used Spicy V8 instead of the tomato sauce. Very good side dish to any Mexican meal.

Cooked as the recipe states but without saffron. Very good. No more than 25 minutes for the rice and no peaking yields the best results

I thought this was a great rice side dish.  I used chicken broth instead of water, and fresh tomatoes. Next time I would cut the salt to one teaspoon.  And it doesn't matter to me what it's called.

I'm not quite sure what happened!  The flavor was fine, my 1.5 year old liked it.  However, I had to start over with this dish because when I brought it to a boil the first time, the bottom became terribly burned and ruined the entire pot of rice.  I tried again, stirring frequently, and the bottom still burned but not as badly.  Heat was low and everything! It was edible, though.  I'm not quite sure if it was the tomato sauce or what, but I've never been so attentive over a pot of rice before in my life and still have the bottom burn! Usually I'm not attentive at all. I set it to boil, turn it down and leave it alone and this never happens so I'm assuming it's the tomato sauce. Will try a different recipe next time.

I'm reviewing knowing that I made changes and so I want to make note of it so I don't forget. I made 16 servings so I used what the directions said but I added 3 fresh corn off the cob, 2 sm cans of pinto beans, 1 sm can of kidney beans, used veg broth instead of water. One jalapeno. 2 chopped gr peppers, 1.5 onions, tumeric in place of saffron and balsamati rice. Everything was very good and I made it the night before.

Made this great rice dish for my Bunco Group's Cinco de Mayo party.  Great recipe, did use beef bouillon for water and eliminated the green pepper. It was a great side dish for burritos and tacos.  Will make again!!

Delicious basic recipe.  I don't like green peppers, so I added fresh spinach.  I used brown rice instead of white.  I added a can of black beans (rinse first to remove sodium) and baked it covered in the oven for a hour.  Brought it to a family gathering and got lots of compliments from a critical family.

It has good flavor.  I used a can of Del-Rio tomato and decreased the water to 2 cups.  It only takes 20 minutes and it's done.  It's very tasty with the shredded beef.

I used olive oil and a mixture of colored peppers that I had on hand, and it was very colorful. Cooked it in my pressure cooker. That way, it was super fast too.

I made this almost exactly as written but without the salt (wanted my 8 month old to have some) and using strands of saffron b/c I didn't know there were different types. I also used red peppers instead of green b/c it was what I had. It was pretty good. so far the best spanish rice I've made but I know others that have been better. Will make again

I found the rice to be quite bland so I used only a little bit of tomato sauce and substituted salsa for the rest of the amount called for the tomato sauce.

This was very good. I loved the addition of saffron quite a bit to the rice recipe I did cut back the tomato sauce to one can and I think next time I may cut it back just a little more.. maybe 3/4 of the can. I also added some chopped fresh spinach during the last few minutes of cooking. Wonderful.

Good basic rice.  I used brown rice and only 1 8oz. can of tomato sauce and it was perfect- just cooked about 5-10 minutes longer because of the brown rice.  Had this with our Mexican meal tonight.

Nice side dish.  I left out the saffron (way too expensive) and used chicken broth instead of water.    I also used wild rice instead of white.  Cooking time is a bit longer but it was very good.  I will make again, but maybe add something else to give it a kick.  We do like things spicy!  :-)

Excellent recipe.  Because I had an extra can of tomatoes w/chilies, I added that in place of 1/2 of the tomato sauce requirement.  Also, did not add saffron.  Quite good with the King Ranch Casserole III and some chopped lettuce and tomatoes on the side, and garnishes of guacomole, salse, and sour cream.  Thanks, Ginger!

I make this rice frequently, following the recipe exactly except that I add a VERY SMALL amount (less than 1/8 tsp) of Dave's Insanity Sauce to give it a little more kick.  If you like a litle (or a lot) of heat, I recommend this rice with the addition of some Dave's.

This was very good though I din't use the saffron it was a little too expensive on this grocery trip though I will purchace it in the future.I scaled it down to 4 servings and added a can of green chiles and a dash or two of hot sauce,and also added a little more cummin and chile powder and it turned out wonderful!We like things on the spicy side so I usually adjust to that.Great recipe.

This is a wonderful dish! At the last minute I realized I didn't have the tomato sauce, so I used a can of diced tomatoes instead, and it turned out delicious! I will probably make it that way again. Very flavorful and easy as well.

I would not call this a main dish.  I found that it worked with chips as an appitizer or as a taco salad topping.

This was excellent!  Threw it together in a snap and served it with our fajitas.  Next time I will use one can of tomato sauce and less water.  Just a personal preference!  This will definitely be a staple on "Mexican Night" at our house!

I was going to make yellowfin tuna tacos for dinner and was looking for a couple of side dishes. I came across this Mexican rice dish that looked intriguing. I decided to go ahead and take a chance and make this recipe. I was pleasantly surprised and so were my guest upon eating the dish it was very simple to prepare I used a cast-iron skillet and I also use the bacon drippings note instead of olive oil. It was a winner winner Yellowfin taco dinner. I will continue to make this recipe for years to come and add it to my repertoire when making any kind of Mexican dinner

My husband is a cumin fan, so I added more cumin for additional flavor. Also used turmeric instead of saffron as a substitute.  Very easy to make and is also a wonderful leftover.  We are fans!  Thanks Ginger!

Based upon others reviews of soupiness, I reduced the water to 1.5 cups and cooked it in the instant pot using the rice setting. Came out perfectly. I did not use saffron nor green bell peppers. Next time I want to add can of pinto beans. I am eating leftovers right now with pinto beans and cheese in warm tortilla =yum! I also followed after other reviews and fried onions, garlic and rice with bacon prior to starting instant pot.

OMG, this rice is wonderful! I added a whole jalapeno without seeds, and a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes for a bit more heat. Only had red pepper so I used it along with Jasmine rice. I loved it! While cleaning kitchen, I put coples rice in container. It was too small so I ate the rest. Then went back for more twice & it was cold. Even my Chihuahua liked it!
Served with pupusas (Green chili & cheese)& Mexican squash.
A wonderful vegetarian Dish.

I have used this several times and it has always been a hit with my Family  they ate lots. I changed up the recipe and added Mecican stewed tomato’s instead of tomato sauce but either way I am sure it to be a hit.

my husband actually made this (so you know it has to be easy) and it was actually delicious!! We omitted the saffron (have you seen the price of that stuff?!) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was the perfect side for our enchiladas!!

Turned out great! Boyfriend ate half the first night! Didn't have black pepper, used two cups frozen corn and real garlic instead of garlic powder and still turned out delicious. Was still good heated up the next few days! Great recipe!

It was wonderful. I used 12 oz of tomato juice instead of sauce and an extra 1/2 cup of rice. Definitely not needed. Made  2 or 3 times what I needed for my family of 6.

Although I did not have all the items at hand this still came out really good. Nice flavors . I used one 8oz can tomato sauce and pimentos instead of green peppers as that was all I hand on hand. Left out the chili as I don't like heat. Came together well and tasted great.

Perfect recipe! Being from San Antonio and having been hired as a cook at a Mexican/American restaurant over 8 years ago, I had been trying to find the exact recipe and be able to tweak it a tiny bit! 
Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was a huge hit in my family, even though I would have liked it a bit more spicy. My stepson is beyond picky when it comes to eating new things, but he loved this! He even when up for seconds. My 3 year old ate it too :) I will definitely make this again. The only change I made was using turmeric instead of saffron. Turned out great still!

No Flavor. I added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes, more chili powder and cumin at the end to try and save it.

This is a delicious recipe that is easily made because the ingredients are always in my home, except for the saffron which I omitted. I made some swaps because I had leftover ingredients that I needed to use. I substituted olive oil in place of vegetable oil, used the entirety of the cans of tomato sauce, and chicken broth instead of water. I cut the salt as a result of these swaps. Also, I only needed about 30 minutes to fully cook the rice to my family's taste. I'll be sure to make the recipe exactly when I can get some saffron; as of now, by using the recipe as a guide, my rice came out wonderfully!

Not sure what went wrong, but this was very starchy and not at all what I expected. Because the flavor was OK I'm giving it 3 stars. However, I am still searching for a Mexican Rice recipe that my family likes.

I had to omit some of the ingredients, particularly the spices due to being unable to locate them in the foreign country I am presently in, however I substituted some local chili peppers. It was ok, the reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 3 was because everyone else seemed to enjoy it a lot.

Very good. I used one can of italian tomatoes chopped w/ the liquid. I also used 1 cup of brown rice and used the same amt of water. I did not have green bell peppers-but I do think they would make a nice addition. Will definitely make again!

I put everything in a casserole dish, popped it in the microwave, cooked on high for 7 minutes, let it sit for 4 or 5 minutes and it was done. I used instant rice. Easy peasy. And yummy, too!

This is delicious Mexican style rice.  Not just Tex-Mex, as it is very similar to rice from many of our San Diego and Tijuana restaurants.  Good for those game day tailgate parties.   Look for Asafran, the Mexican Saffron, much less expensive and about the same characteristics as the higher priced condiment.  This can be found in the Mexican oriented groceries and larger supermarkets.  One made-in-San Diego brand is Madrecita, other good brands out there also. Adjust the tomato sauce to your taste and I like to use Jasmine style rice.

Made this rice for my very picky mother who enjoyed it. I found that the amount of salt added was a bit too much. I think i'll reduce it to 1 teaspoon next time and I think if you add some ground beef to this it would make it even better. I also did not get to use the saffron in here but I would make it again.

I don't use saffron because it's so expensive, so I left it out of this recipe the first time I made it, and it was really bland. So, to make up for the flavor that I am sure the lack of saffron gave it, the next time I used 1 8oz can of tomato sauce and 1 14 1/2 oz can of diced tomatoes, plus I had to add a little more water to keep it from being dried out and scorched even at reduced heat.  This vastly improved the flavor for me.  But very easy recipe to make!

Yum! I only used 1 can of the tomato sauce and that was definitely enough. I didn't have to saffron, so I used 1/4 tsp. turmeric instead.

I had a real hard time finding saffron and when I did find it, it was $19 for about 1 tbsp of threads of it. So needless t say I omitted the saffron. I used brown rice, my preference. It wasn't the best spanish style rice I've had. I have had better recipes, so I will not make this again.

I don't think I'd eat this on its own, and it is not quite worth the effort over a plain bowl of rice paired with something else, especially chili.

I didn't have the saffron so I just ommited that. I love onions and green peppers in my mexican rice. This is very good, it was a little tomatoey to me but still good. I used a cup of instant white rice that was already made which made this very quick to make. I just added the tomoto sauce, chopped onion and green pepper and the spices to the already cooked rice and cooked for about 10 - 15 minutes while my enchiladas were baking. Great stuff! EDIT **** made as original recipe states without instant rice and soo soo good. I still didn't have the saffron though.

I used spanish saffron rice (yellow package) instead of buying jasmine rice and saffron spice bec. it is expensive and I used smoked green chile peppers from Mexico that I bought at an Harris Teeter event and WOW all put together delicious! Spicy and very tasty :) Oh I did need to occasionally stir my rice bec. some stuck to the bottom and burned and 30 min. was plenty.

This was a HUGE hit with our family members from Italy.  We thought instead of doing the typical Italian meal, we would have them explore Mexican food.  A fabulous recipe and SO easy to make!  Thank you!

This was so delicious! I didn't have saffron but didn't miss it either. Otherwise I followed directions and I loved how this rice came out. Added to black bean tortillas.

We like a little more spice, but this was good.  I also used chicken broth instead of water and added some green chili peppers.  I will make this again and add more of the spices.

Good recipe that will definately serve 8.  Fairly easy to prepare and MUCH better than anything out of a box.  I really like saffron and appreciate the flavor in the rice.  Will make again.

The results-to-effort ratio is off the scale: restaurant-quality Mexican rice that's as easy to make as a Lipton sidedish.  Bravo, Ginger!

This was nice.  I didn't add the saffron as I didn't have it in my pantry and perhaps this might make this dish more of a stand out.  I will have to make it again to see.  I did serve this with a dollop of sour cream and chopped shallots on the side.  This was made this rice better in my view.

I used yellow food coloring and went without the saffron. When I realized the taste was suffering, though, I added 2 cubes of chicken boullon and a can of chicken broth. THIS saved the day; the rice turned out excellent and I'd definitely use this recipe again.

This was great! I made it with enchiladas, and it almost seemed like we were eating at a Mexican restaurant. I didn't use the saffron, as it was too expensive for me at the time. Thanks for the great recipe!

Ginger, this rice is fabulous! My boyfriend and I both love it ... I've made it twice already. I love the flavor of cumin, and the saffron really DOES make a difference. My only problem is that it tends to really stick and burn on the bottom of my pan. I'm using a Revereware stainless steel saucepan (I sure miss my Le Creuset). I thought I had enough liquid and the heat was low. Any ideas on how to prevent this from happening (and wasting any delicious rice stuck to the pan)?

this rice was full of flavor.  I couldn't find saffron after going to 2 stores, but the recipe did
not suffer.  I usually hate mexican rice at restaurants, but I loved this.

Made this without the saffron and it turned out alright.  Only one out of the six that I served thought that the spices were too much.  Decent rice for mexican food nights.
