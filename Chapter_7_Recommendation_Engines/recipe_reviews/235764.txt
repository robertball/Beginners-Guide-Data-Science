I didn't have any leeks on hand, so I used 1/2 of a package of green onions instead. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I like the flavors of this soup. Mine turned out a little bit too thick for our liking (maybe due to the size of my cauliflower & potato). I will probably thin it out a bit with some additional stock before serving it tonight. Tasty soup - thanks for the recipe!

I loved it!  I omitted the potato all together and didn't puree all of it.  It was fantastic!  Thank you.  Also I didn't have allspice, so I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon and clove.

Delicious!  I used a sweet potato and chicken broth.  Also added a diced up chicken breast and white pepper.  So good.

The kids and I found this to be bland. I dirtied a lot of pots, dishes and blender to have a ton of mediocre soup leftover. Will not be making this again.

I followed the recipe until I got to the end and then I had saved about 1 cup of the mixture till I pureed the rest then I added it to the final mix as I prefer to have some of the vegetables in the soup. Was very good loved the combination of the cauliflower and potatoes compared to just potatoes. will make this again especially in the winter.  I might next make it with sweet potatoes.
