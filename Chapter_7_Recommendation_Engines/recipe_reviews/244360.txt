After reading through the recipe, I kept thinking that eating these would get kind of messy with all of the liquid in there, so I decided to spread the mixture out on a cookie sheet and bake them in a 400 degree oven for about 25 minutes. This dried up the liquid, but kept the flavor on the edamame. They're tasty!

This was a great hit with all of my friends.  The only things I did was add a little bit of toasted sesame seeds and used the edamame in the pods.  More fun to eat!

The holy trinity of flavors: sweet, salty, and spicy.   We loved it. I chose to make them in their shells and they were literally finger lickin' good. For personal taste preference, I only used  one teaspoon of sesame oil though. Very nice recipe!

Quick and easy and delicious.  After seasoning, I roasted the edamame in the oven along with the dinner instead of cooking it separately.

A quick, easy, delicious winner.  And the extra juices made a great topping for the basmati rice we also had.

Closest I've found to my favourite restaurant. Used edamame in the pod. Delicious!

I will make it again.  I started with less than 2 cups of edamame . Maybe 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 cups so I adjusted down to a half recipe for the rest of the ingredients.  The only other difference was that I didn't have plain sriracha but I did have sriracha mayo.  It might have been too hot for me as written.  I ate the whole thing at one sitting minus few taste bites while being refrigerated.

I used edamame in the shell. My Thai red chili wound up being Thai red curry. But it still worked!  Added more soy sauce and sriracha sauce. Very good. Also think this would be great as a salmon marinade.

This recipe was good but I made it better by adding 3-4 cloves of garlic (minced) and about a tablespoon of minced ginger. I'll never eat plain edamame again.

I made them as directed. They were a little salty but this may be my personal taste. I do like the flavor and will try this again with some changes

I ate this over several days so it does hold up very well.

I added about a 1/4 of frozen seasoning blend (chopped onion, pepper and celery) and 4 ounces of leftover turkey.

AWESOME!!!! So simple to make and so much flavor. The recipe calls for 'shelled' edamame, but I notice the pic by Raquel is of the ones in the shell, so I guess it doesn't really matter, but I used the ones out of the shell. The family (even the girls) gobbled up every last one. BTW, sorry for the bad pic, it's been gloomy/stormy here all day. This is a def keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
