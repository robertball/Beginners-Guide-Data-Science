Very close...
 
If you haven't been pleased with this recipe I suggest these adjustments.

For 8 servings, use 4 thin slices of salt pork, cut into small dice and "tried out" i.e. fried on very low heat until the fat is rendered. 

Discard rendered salty fat and set the crisp pork aside on double layer of paper towel. 

Try to use salt pork, it's the original ingredient and lends a subtle deliciousness to the chowder. Fish chowder is about sweet fish not salty smoked bacon. 

If you must use bacon, use only 2 or 3 slices and don't use hickory smoked, maple smoked, apple smoked, honey smoked or any other flavored bacon, but just plain bacon. And render the fat and throw it away because it will be too salty for this soup. Dice the cooked bacon and add as explained further on.  

Don't try to make chowder in an hour, or even two hours, or even for supper the same day you make it. Chowder's flabor needs time to develop because of its simple ingredients. It's not a dish to rush if you want it to be good. 

Use Spanish onion (about1 1/2 cups diced)for 8-servings). 

Sweat the onion for about 5-10 minutes over very low heat using the 2 tablespoons of butter listed in Cathy's recipe. No substitutions - you'll remove the butter later, cross my heart.

After onions are softened put them into a pan-sprayed heavy-bottomed Dutch oven, put in the fish which should be in very large pieces (thick fillets cut into 3 pieces each - I buy a big package at Sam's Club and use it all for one chowde

I am not much of a fan of seafood but recent dietary changes made me explore it. This recipe may convert me to being more of a seafood eater. I made this as presented and then a second time with my tweaks. Either are very good.

This is the best fish chowder ever!  I do suggest putting in old bay.  We ate the whole pot and had NO leftovers!

This is it, in its simple glory!  (I agree with the reviewer who uses salt pork instead of bacon, though.)  If you're looking for "the" Maine fish chowdah recipe, it don't get much closah than this heah.

VERY good!  I did not use anywhere near 1 pound of bacon though .. I used 4 slices and thought it was plenty.  I added 2 bay leaves and a few drops tobasco and it was awesome.;  Easy to make - I recommend it!

It was edible but I did not much care for it, neither did my boyfriend.  It was very bland with a strong fishy taste.  The only good part, we thought, was the bacon.

Excellent!!  I don't know what Maine chowder tastes like, but I just threw in some fish I had in the freezer, thawed it, cut it into 1" cubes and dumped it in the pot.  I also added a can of cream style corn and garlic salt.  I'll keep this one in my personal recipe box.

Incredibly easy and very tasty. The only thing I did different was I used chicken broth instead of water and I added a little bit of cayenne pepper to give it a bite.

Made this using fresh Cod fish my husband and son caught on their fishing trip.  My 8-year-old raved about it. Husband thought it was a bit bland, so I added a little Old Bay seasoning.  I did not taste it, but based on ease of recipe and how much my son and husband liked it(after the addition of some Old Bay), I give it 4 stars.

This was very good, but I would substitute one of the cans of evaporated milk for some 1/2 and 1/2.  A genuine Maine chowda!

ok, so I give this a 5 star rating because once I figured out how to give this some good flavor it turned out awesome. Instead of using water to cover the potatoes use chicken stock. It turned out amazing after a few tries when I did this instead.

I loved it!  Hubby thot the fish part sounded unappealing (he doesn't much like fish).  So we basically broke it down into 2 small recipes.  In mine we put the fish.  In his we did not, leaving him with basically a potato soup.  .... It was delicious!  I'm quite fond of Mrs Dash (all the different flavors), so I sprinkled some on my chowder.  But I did try it before doing that, and thot it was great that way, too.  This is one we'll make again!

i grew up eating fish and make it all the time, although this was my first fish soup/chowder (we always fry/bake/grill). after spicing up the base with cayenne and zatarain's cajun seasoning (i didn't have old bay) the base was excellent tasting but i just prefer to eat fish by itself. like i said i've never had fish soup before and i probably never will, it was just weird to eat it in a soup but i still give this 5 stars because the taste was really excellent we just didn't like the chunks of fish

A most enjoyable meal.  I did add some hot sauce, I really enjoyed the mixed flavors.  But I reduced the bacon to 3 slices, and added no salt because of diet restrictions.  Had it for breakfast, dinner and breakfast the next day.  WONDERFUL STUFF!

I made a few changes to add ingredients my husband and I like, but still a wonderful recipe so giving 5 stars!  Added celery, garlic scapes from our garden, chicken bouillon when cooking potatoes, couple shakes of curry powder & Braggs seasoning. Used diced ham because it’s what I had instead of bacon. Also used haddock which is plentiful here in Maine!  Yummy!  Thanks!  Also paired with popovers makes a real Maine meal. We stuff any leftover popovers the next day with scrambled eggs after toasting them!

I followed the recipe for the most part. While cooking the onions, I continued to stir the onions and bacon grease making a pseudo rue. I did substitute organic evaporated milk and coconut milk. I also added fresh jalapeño from the garden diced and cilantro as a garnish. It added a nice kick. The wife and kids loved it. This also pairs nicely with Shiner Oktoberfest beer. This will be in rotation.

LOVED this chowder recipe. Although I did use pollock and half & half in place of the milks.  It worked out perfectly and I will use this recipe often.

Had been looking for the recipe that appeared to be most like the fish chowder my mom made. This was it. I eliminated the evaporated milk and went with all skim milk. I used unsalted grass fed butter so sea salt was an absolute must.  Totally delicious!
