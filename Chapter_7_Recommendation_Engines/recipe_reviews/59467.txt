I didn't have any green onions, but liked this anyway!  Great fresh taste, you don't taste the mint right away, it kind of creeps up on you, and gives a great after-taste.  Will make many more times, with the onions added.

Wow, these were so fast and easy, not to mention delicious!  I used frozen peas, just threw them in the pan with the other stuff and stir-fried them for a few minutes.  Great side dish.

Very good and easy.  It's great to have a vegetable that can be used on a buffet that doesn't have to be hot.

Great recipe!!!! Cannot wait to make it again. Quick to prepare but looks like you went to a lot of trouble to make. Loved the fresh mint, very tasty and just different enough for that "wow" factor. Served with grilled filet mignon for my husband's birthday dinner but think this would be great for a springtime meal with lamb chops or pork tenderloin.

Excellent flavors and very easy to make.  I used a combination of peppermint and spearmint and the taste was so refreshing.  I did add more salt to the dish.

Terrific, just terrific!  I used a pinch of dried thyme with the salt & pepper since I didn't have fresh mint yet.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Fast and fun and very good.

Mint flavor is very strong - if you're unsure about whether or not you're a mint fan, I would substitute something else. Dish looked pretty, but didn't receive great reviews from my roommate, my boyfriend, or myself. If you love mint, you should really like this. I made it because it had such a high rating and was disappointed.

I made this exactly as directed and my family and I thought that the snap peas were too crisp.  Next time I make, I will parboil for a few minutes before stir frying.  The snap peas had a good flavor and I thought the mint really added that special something.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

It's simple and exciting.  The mint makes the peas taste even more fresh and sweet.  It's just a good easy idea.

I had to make these the-less-than-fresh-ingredient-way. I bought frozen peas and used onion powder, garlic salt, olive oil and dried mint (because I had none of the other items on hand). I nuked the peas for three minutes, added the spices/oil, continued nuking for two more minutes and then added the dried mint. Wow! What a combination of flavors! Next time I will do it right, but if you're in a pinch this will suffice.

Great texture and taste.  Fresh ingredients are key - remember: the more you chop your mint, the more "minty" the flavor(otherwise, just rough chop using twice as much).  Substituting cilantro for the mint also works well. Even though I love garlic and usually double up with other recipes, it really isn't necessary or desirable when preparing this dish.

These are sooooo sweet and crunchy and wonderful! I did not have mint, so I substituted parsley - it was great. They went perfectly with "Hot Tempered Baby Back Ribs with Sweet Guava Glaze" and garlic mashed potatoes.

A good side dish! I rarely cook with mint, so it was a new flavor with a veggie like this. The mint was a little much for me but the pea pods were really good. I would try this dish again with other herbs.

Great fresh taste! Instead of salt I added 1T soy sauce, 1t brown rice vinegar, and a dash of worcestershire sauce. It made a nice little sauce that goes well over rice.

This just wasn't for us. I think it calls for too much onion. You have to be careful what you serve this with - the flavors can clash badly.

AWESOME! I doubled the recipe and used frozen snap peas - to thaw, I just left them out for about 30 minutes. I pressed the garlic and used about four green onions (all I had left) and the seasoning was perfect! The mint flavor with the peas is really phenomenal and all through dinner I heard my guests talking of snap peas... ~UPDATE~ I'd been using frozen snap peas to save time - but fresh are better!

Excellent recipe!  Made it exactly as-is - very easy to prepare, and also very tasty.  Ate it both warm and at room temperature and it was great both ways.

I made this w/o the scallions, I didn't have them in the house and increased the mint to twice the amount in the recipe.  I also should have lower the cooking time to about two-thirds.  Just my desired done-ness for vegatables.  I loved the flavor in this dish.  I will try it again with the scallions and reduce the cooking time.  I think it will be PERFECT!!!

I LOVE fresh sugar snap peas! I like them best as simple as possible to highlight the natural flavors. I took someone else's advice to use thyme instead of mint (big mistake!) it's a much stronger herb than sugar snaps need! It was my own fault so I'm rating this according to what I think it would be if I had followed the recipe! Fresh and Delicious!! I followed everything else as I should and I highly recommend using the freshly ground sea salt in this recipe!

This was wonderful! I love the freshness of the dish as well as the ease of preparation. I didn't use quite enough fresh mint... my mint plant is doing a little puny this season so was afraid to cut too much. Next time I'll use the full amount as it could have used more. I loved this dish... and so did my husband.

This recipe is a wonderful summer side dish! I don't often cook with mint and was a tad skeptical, but tried it anyway.  I'm glad I did!  The mint isn't overpowering but gives the dish a very fresh summer taste.  I didn't have green onions so I used fresh onion chives out of my garden.  Lovely recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!

This is one of those recipes where the name is the most exciting thing about it.  It sure sounded fun and different, but prepared as-is, these snap peas were pretty bland.  Sure, I ended up doctoring them up, but I won't bother sharing because it doesnt' affect my rating when prepared exactly as written.

Local orchard had fresh snap peas so I bought them then went in search of a recipe. Some mint from my back porch and I had a light, local dinner. Very nice recipe.

This was good - not quite as outstanding as some of the reviews made it sound, but it was a refreshing change from my normal preparation. We eat snap peas this time of year once or twice a day, so any change is good!

I love Sugar Snap Peas! This recipe looks wonderful, and I can't wait to try it! If you don't want much of a minty taste, just use less. Do not overcook these peas. They are supposed to be very crisp. Some of the photos with this recipe looked overdone. In fact, my favorite way to eat them is raw, dipped in Ranch dressing! Sometimes I cook them in a little boiling water for just 3 minutes. More like blanching them. Add salt, pepper and a little butter. Delish! Toni

This was very yummy. Next time I will put the garlic and green onions in right before removing them from the heat in order to get the snap peas done with out over cooking the green onions and garlic. Wonderful combination of flavors I would have never have thought to put together. Thanks.

Loved this! So fast and easy to make. A friend gave me some fresh mint from her garden, and it was so delicious! I have passed this recipe on to many friends and they all come back and say they loved it. You can add more or less garlic and green onion, as your taste desires, and you really can't go wrong. A wonderful find!

Husband liked them. I used regular diced onion and garlic but less mint. Wouldn't want to use the whole amount, think the mint flavor would be over bearing.

These were ok, couldn't taste the mint though.  I used lemon mint cause it's what we have growing outside.  Maybe I needed to use more since it wasn't straight mint.  My hubby and daughter loved them but they both really like sugar snaps.

We liked this recipe although I'd probably do a few things differently next time.  I like my snap peas a little softer, so I'd probably steam them a bit before doing everything else.  I used a few sprigs of fresh mint and felt like it needed more than that since there wasn't a lot of minty flavor.

Very nice dish.  I don't have green onions (bf thinks he hates them) so I tossed in dried minced onion.  I also don't have fresh mint--I cannot find it in the grocery stores here for some reason--so I used about a teaspoon of dried.  Quick, easy, and good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this with Cornish Hens and everyone LOVED IT! Used shallots and dried mint flakes and cooked in a wok for a few minutes and it turned out fine. Easy and different.

Didnt have green onions, fresh mint or fresh garlic. I used dried onion flakes, dried mint and shopped garlic from a jar. Turned out perfect! So easy and great way to use sugar snap peas as a side dish! thanks!

I used shallot instead of green onions and it went nicely.  Might cut back on the mint next time.  It was a little too minty for me, but in defense of the recipe, I might not have had the stated amount of sugar snaps - I just picked what I could from my garden.  Will definitely try this one again, though!

Just picked our peas from the local farmer and added chives and mint from our garden. YUM!! I got a little carried away with the mint - I can't help it... I love the smell! But my son (9) said "maybe a little less mint next time, Mom".  Great recipe though, thank you for sharing.

I was afraid the mint would be overpowering but it wasn't at all.  Everybody really enjoyed it.  I made a double batch and it was gone by the end of brunch.

Turned out great!  Recipe is simple and easy to follow. The mint flavor was subtle, which I liked, but could easily be adjusted if you like it a bit stronger.

All I can say is wow!!  I fixed this dish for Easter dinner and was pleasantly suprised!  This was such a different flavor and it was so refreshing! The simplicity was great.  I used dryed mint as I could not get fresh mint at my store.  I am now going to look for more recipes that utilize mint!!

Crisp, refreshing and absolutely delightful! I used vidalia onion and a tad more mint (based on the other reviews) and it tasted light and heavenly! Served on the side with Mahi Mahi with a mango salsa, and wild rice, it was perfection as a supper!

I got an account just to rate this recipe.  These are awesome.  My family absolutely loves them.  Husband asks for them regularly.  It seemed so strange to put mint in with the peas, but it is really amazing.  I'm not a huge fan of sugar snap peas, but this recipe changed my mind!  When I don't have green onions on hand, I use regular onions and they turn out great.

I made this recipe with regular frozen peas, because that is what I had and I wanted to use up some fresh mint leaves.  It was marvelous.  Even my vegetable hating 6yodd cleaned her plate.

Very tasty side dish. Made it twice and first time used more garlic like some of the reviewers suggested, but i thought the extra garlic overpowered the flavor of the mint (and I like garlic), so next time used as the recipe said and it was perfect.

This was a definite hit and I will make it again.  I used a shallot instead of the green onion.  Delicious and speaks loudly that it's  spring!!

Very easy to make and the flavors go well together. However, it felt like the snap peas were nicely cooked and then there was some flavorful "stuff" to pile on top. The ingredients didn't meld together into one cohesive dish for me.

We LOVED these! I did not have green onions, so I used the shallot I had, other than that I followed the recipe. This will become a regular side dish at our house! Don't skimp on the mint, that really added a nice undertone. Thanks for sharing!!

Since we have a lot of sugar snap peas right now, I just made it for a lunch dish along with vegetable soup.  Since some of the peas get away from me and get too big, I sliced them down lengthwise and sauteed so everything was done and same texture when cooked.  I used three small onions from the garden and one banana pepper.  For some reason it was spicy, could be the banana pepper or the black pepper, but gave it great taste!

A fresh, easy to prepare dish.  We liked it with our dinner and even snacked on it cold, later on.
