WOW this is EXCELLENT!!  I made two small changes added some sliced almonds and used lime juice since I was out of lemon.  I served it on a bed of baby Romain lettuce.  Thanks so much for a delightful new twist on tuna salad!!

Very Good! So easy, and it tasted great. I served it on top of spinach leaves, but next time I will stuff it into a pita for a main dish sandwich.

Not bad flavor - but next time I would use fresh green beans or omit them entirely. The frozen ones had a bad "freezer" taste that is usually eliminated by cooking. Otherwise a healthy alternative to typical mayo based tuna salad.

Pretty good. I omitted the green beans.  It was much better the next day as the tuna was not so "strong" and the flavors were blended.  I used albacore tuna and served on baby spinich as a salad.  Will make again when craving a different tuna salad.  May try with kidney beans next.

Great, easy recipe- throw it all in and mix- all done!  Lots of flavor- use on top of spinach leaves or filler in pita.

I made this for The Woman I Love. It made 2 plates for each of us over 2 days. I made my half exactly as written (with 1 tbsp of parmesan in my half), and omitted the parmesan for her. We both loved it - so nice and fresh and healthy.
As it turns out, as much as I love cheese, I didn't really notice the parmesan in my half, so some people may choose to omit it. One minor thing: I used a very large red onion for this, and I thought it was too much, so others might be advised to use a medium or small one (or a half onion like one reviewer suggested). I had mine by itself, on a plate, and served hers on a bed of hearts of romaine - a great salad either way. I'm going to make a double batch for her next weekend, and so on. Thanks for a keeper of a recipe.

looks like it will be overwhelming, but it fits
perfectly into the dish.

I really loved this! I was looking for a lighter alternative to the usual tuna salad with mayo. I did make some changes simply because I didn't have the ingredients. Didn't have cheese and didn't have green beans but kept everything else as is except used about 1/2 the oil. Very good and I will definitely make again!

I thought this was great! My husband also enjoyed it. I skipped the green beans, but otherwise followed the recipe. Served it over some European mix lettuce dressed with a little lemon juice and olive oil and added some hard boiled egg to the plate. Very healthy and tasty!

This recipe was very good with a great garlic taste. I doubled everything and left out the cheese. It just needed a little extra lemon juice so it wan't so dry.

Loved it.  Have made it twice - once as lunch for the week at work.  I doubled the recipe and took it to the office with some pita and spinach.  I steamed fresh green beans that time and overcooked them a little, but that's my bad, not the recipe's.  The second time I made it as lunch for guests and they loved it too.  I think I used frozen green beans that time.  It doesn't hold together quite good enough to make an easy sandwich in my opinion, but my friend ate it with a fork, like a regular salad and we all enjoyed it.  My BF who doesn't typically care for tuna loves this.

I also omitted the green beans, and used kidney beans instead... delicious.  I find using "good" tuna makes all the difference too (I buy the Rio Mare brand packed in olive oil, it has the best flavour!)

My 1-year old is eating food with us now, but isn't a big fan of onions, so I omitted the onion and used onion powder instead.  Because of that I had to add some extra seasonings, but it turned out great!  I served it on a bed of lettuce with a little warm rice and it turned out great!

Just average.  If you only used half the red onion, it would probably be a little better.  Beware, too- the smell is STRONG!  My husband won't eat it, and is upset because our kitchen smells now.  I hope it's better after 24 hours...

Such a good dish! Lots of flavor and healthy too! The only change I made was to omit the green beans because I had someone that did not like them. I will make again with the green beans but it is still perfect without. A definite keeper.
