This was delicious.  The flavor was very nice.  The only reason we gave it four stars is that it isn't quite "quick and easy" to make.  Also, we got 16 rather large jalepenos, and we ran out of cream cheese and sausage halfway.  Again though, an excellent appetizer!

These were really good.  I did not have chives so that were left out.  I used a fiesta blend grated cheese instead of cheddar.  I must not have read the recipe very carefully because I mixed the shake n bake, cumin and chili powder in with the sausage and cheese mixture.  I guess it didn't make a difference because everyone that tried them absolutley loved them!!!  One other thing I did differently was I made actual eggs.  Instead  of slicing the jalapenos I used a paring knife to cut off the end of the pepper with the stem.  Then using the knife I scraoped the seeds off the inside ofthe pepper and poured them out.  I then put the cream cheese mixture in a baggie and cut a hole in the corner and filled the peppers.  I took some of the sauage mixture and wrapped it around the stuffed jalapenos.  Then baked as stated in the recipe.  If you do this remember that as the sausage cooks the fat cooks out and the sausge will shrink so make sure that it is covered well.  I had my peppers completely covered and when they finished baking I had peppers peeking out of the sauage, it didn't effect the taste at all, just presentation.

To me, these are a pain in the butt to make! But my husband loves them so much that it's worth it. My variations: I use hot sausage & I always need more than 1 lb. I have trouble getting the peppers covered completely. I use Pepper Jack cheese instead of plain cheddar. And I use Shake & Bake Hot & Spicy  to roll them in. Some like it REAL HOT! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

hey this is a great recipe you need to add hamburger meat to it helps make it easy to wrap the peppers and an egg will help keep it together

Way too much going on here.  The filling is good but the sausage was difficult to mold around the peppers. I just didn't like the combination.

A huge hit!! They were fabulous.  I didn't add the bacon to the cream cheese filling because I thought it was a little much.  Also I used a split of hot sausage and mild.  Be sure stuff the peppers very well.  The cream cheese filling is what helps cool the heat of the pepper.  I had a few people bit off pieces without the filling, and they thought it to be too hot.  Overall I will make again and again.

I owed my hubby since he had been especially helpful with a project so I painfully made these for him since he is a native Texan and absolutely loves hot and spicy. What a labor of love. The two previous reviews were both very good and helpful. This is a great recipe and he loved these. I never tried one so I can't attest. Thanks !

My husband loved these!  I used shredded bbq pork instead of sausage, and panko instead of bread crumbs... They turned out great.

These are super!  The guys love them and I am required to bring them to the Super Bowl party to be admitted!  However, not really easy to make, but worth the effort.

This is what we tried. 1Lrg. clove of garlic, 1 table spoon diced onion,1/3 teaspoon cumin, 6 lrg jalapenos, whole, seeded, 8 oz. cream cheese,4 slices of crispy bacon minced. Mix all the ingredients with the cheese. Poke a hole in the tip of the pepper so you can stuff it full. We wrapped them in breakfast sausage and baked them in a 350 deg. electric skillet for 35 minutes. No extra spices. We figured the sausage had enough. AWESOME!

These were good, one pound of sausage was only enough for me to cover about 8 jalapenos.  Maybe the ones I got were bigger than normal.  Otherwise, these have a great flavor and the filling is delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good, spicy! They were very popular everyone liked them. I don't eat carbs, so I left out the package seasoning coating mix.
