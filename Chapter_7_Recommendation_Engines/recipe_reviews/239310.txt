This was very good. I didn't know what to expect from a vodka sauce but we really enjoyed it. It does make a lot of sauce and I believe I could have made a little more pasta. It was super creamy and had a soft tomato taste. I served this as a side dish to 'Southern BBQ Chicken' from AR. Luckily I didn't create any flames as the submitter said may happen when adding the vodka to the hot pan. I had a lot of leftovers so I froze containers to share with our son and DIL my in-laws and have a small container for DH's lunch tomorrow. I love trying new recipes and this did not disappoint. The next time I'm going to try adding some red pepper flakes to add a little heat to the dish.

I have made this four times over the last year, and I continue to get requests for it at gatherings. After playing around with the base recipe, I now increase the garlic and italian spices by about 30%, I sauté a medium onion with the garlic, basil, and parsley in a little EVOO before adding the vodka (top shelf), I find that one to two tbsp of sugar takes the edge off of the acidic tomatoes, and lastly, I add either sautéed chicken or shrimp, and a bag of peas to add some greens.

I made a couple happy mistakes I mixed up the portions for the tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes. It turned out a little thicker and it was a good mistake. I added extra cheese no reason to explain why. Added a little salt as well. Then I simmered it for about two hours to let it get thick. It was godly. Thank you!

I followed the directions to the T. The name of the dish is true it is the best vodka sauce! It is definitely better than any restaurant. I am keeping this recipe for a lifetime.

This was absolutely delicious and EASY! I did do what another cook did and crushed San Marzano tomatoes with my hands instead of crushed tomatoes. They are the best! I also added chicken which I cooked separately in garlic and butter and added right before I severed it. This was something easy to throw together and would be a good dish for entertaining. Everyone raved about it!

Not only is this a delicious sauce but it is super easy to make. I followed the directions because it was the first time I made it and didn't have a flair up when I poured the vodka into the heated pot. I poured from a measuring cup not the bottle as suggested in other places. I added some chicken pieces which I had sautéed in butter and garlic. Next time I might add some chili flakes to add some heat which we enjoy. Also I might increase the amount of cheese to make the sauce even creamier. I have frozen several portions (the recipe makes a lot!) which I will use over the coming weeks. I cooked up some penne and we had a simple salad with it. Thanks for this recipe.

Excellent vodka sauce!  Absolutely loved it.  Used fresh garlic cloves, minced, fresh parsley and basil (gotta use fresh basil!), canned diced tomatoes and sauce, and New Amsterdam vodka, which I’m told is a decent inexpensive vodka and not top shelf (not a vodka drinker myself).  Loved how quick and easy this recipe is!

.Luckily I never had a problem with the vodka combusting and I am a newer cook so don’t shy away because it makes or breaks the recipe! Once I make it: my sister, my parents,  my boyfriend and in-laws all want to tray!!! I made this twice for a charity event and was asked for the recipe it at least a dozen times, It’s a way cheaper alternative to making trays of baked ziti with meat and a lot easier

I made this sauce with my son. It is amazing! Nothing in it is overpowering. The flavors blend together nicely. We will be making this again.

I made the sauce today and although it was very tasty, the consistency was too soupy.   I followed it to the T.

I love the easiness of this sauce and the taste is outstanding. I always add a little more cheese but it is not necessary! This time I use thin spaghetti noodles and topped off the dish with some boiled and sautéed Argentinian Shrimp! Yum!

Yummy! I substituted basil pesto for the fresh garlic basil and parsley which made it super easy...no chopping easy cleanup. Hubs LOVED it with shrimp over zoodles. Super low carb!

It was delicious!  I made this with homegrown pureed tomatoes and added a bit of salt for taste.  I also substituted half-and-half since I  didn't have heavy cream so the sauce was a little thin (but nothing a few sprinkles of flour couldn't fix!)
