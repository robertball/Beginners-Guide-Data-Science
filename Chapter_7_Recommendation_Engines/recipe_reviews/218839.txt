Rated good as is.  I'm not going to rate "based on my changes I give it a _star rating".  Went with the original recipe for a few pitas and a few "special" pitas.  Again, five stars based on original recipe.  Please quit rating recipes based on your additions/subtractions because it is not useful to anyone to base a recipe on your personal preferences.

This was delicious!  I couldn't find Johnsonville ground sausage so I used another brand....sorry Johnsonville.  This was so easy and everyone loved it.  I also made pizza sauce from scratch using the "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" recipe from this website.  This is a keeper.

Wonderful as is, but I think next time I will add the sauce inside the pita. Pouring down rain today so cooked them under the broiler.

These were really good. My husband made these for dinner tonight.  Instead of ricotta we subbed 4 oz of cream cheese. My kiddos don't like ricotta. Dipping them in the sauce was SO GOOD.  I can't believe my store was out of pita!  I had to sub multi grain 1/2 rolls. You know those rolls that are flat and 1/2 the calories of regular rolls? Hubby oiled them up and browned them in a pan like grilled cheese. I have a bit of left over meat so I'll add a scrambled egg and put it on a bagel for breakfast tomorrow. The little kid said it tasted like a mcdonalds breakfast Sammie.

These are quick and easy to make and taste pretty good too. The recipe is great as is. The sausage is full of flavor! You really don't need to, but I added garlic and onions when cooking the sausage. I also had about a tablespoon of basil pesto I needed to use up, so I added that to the meat and cheese mixture as well - it really added that special something. I used a grill pan to grill the pitas and it worked great! Thanks for a yummy recipe :)

I used ground beef because that's what I had, I also added a bit of sauce in with meat mixture.  Toasted pitas in my toaster oven and skipped the olive oil.  Picky kids liked it, overall a quick easy delicious weeknight meal!

I will definitely makes these again; may add some onions and or peppers and a little seasoning, but they were good as is also. My pitas wouldn't open so I ended up cutting them in half and making a sandwich out of the halves.

These are DELICIOUS!! I was looking for a recipe to use up some ricotta cheese that I had leftover from making lasagna.  (So my ricotta already had some spinach parmesan mixed in).  This was super quick and easy, and I found Italian Herb pitas at the store.  Will definitely be making again.

If you like calzones, you'll love this!  Extremely easy to make, and great for something quick!  I put these in a toaster oven to cook it quickly, and everyone loved them.

Only 4 stars because it needed extra seasonings. Garlic, italian herbs, onion, red pepper flakes, pepper, mushrooms, or diced peppers would all be delicious to add in any combination. Very tasty and quick for a week night, though!
