I added 2 tsp of ground flaxseed, to give a bit of texture.

You have to drunk these in some type of milk.  I just wish I could find a keto recipe that satisfies my sweet tooth and that's actually good.  I even tried adding mayo and a little bit of low carb milk as I read in the comments.  After the first batch I tried under baking them and Nope still so dry.  I won't be making these again.

I really liked this as a low carb option. I tried it with truvia, and thought it tasted good but does have a truvia after taste.

I following the recipe with two minor changes: 1) I used Swerve instead of Truvia 2) I used 2/3 cup smooth peanut butter and 1/3 cup extra crunchy.  Next time I will add a little more Swerve to make it a bit sweeter, but overall these came out pretty good. I miss eating sweets!

made it exactly as written.  Delicious!  Even my picky teenager liked them.  I usually do not like Truvia either but in these, it was fine.  Looking forward to making again.  So quick and easy!
