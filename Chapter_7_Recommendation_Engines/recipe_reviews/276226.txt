Really like this 'lazy' recipe.  Being Chinese and having made them the traditional way with the pleats to seal them all my life, it's refreshing to find an easier way of doing it. Side benefit is that it reduces the amount of dough in each dumpling.  Also, I find that instead of 'karate chop' to seperate the dumplings, I use a fat chop-stick instead. This helps to seal each dumpling on the sides, before I use a pizza cutter to cut them apart. Definitely making more in the future, and sharing this with friends & family!

This was my first attempt at making dumplings and they turned out great!  Watching the video really helped me when it came to getting it right.  I didnâ€™t have the Korean chilli flakes so I just used crushed red pepper flakes instead. My Asian wife and I prefer our dumplings dry so I cooked these in a cast iron pan on high heat, searing all sides and then we made a dipping sauce out of sesame oil, soy sauce and homemade red chilli vinegar.  We definitely will make these again!

An involved recipe,  but yummers! My tip is NOT to stack the dumplings on top of each other before they're cooked, otherwise the dough congeals and your left with some gloppy dumplings.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but it just wasn't my thing. I may give it another chance with a few tweeks. I would've rated this as 3 stars, but I'm going to assume some error on my own part. I don't have much experience with Asian dishes or dough/noodle type of stuff. My biggest issue was the salt. I even used low sodium soy sauce and broth, but that still didn't cut it. The dish was just way too salty.

The dumplings tasted amazing, and definitely didn't take long to make. The vinegar in the broth was a bit too overpowering for me, but otherwise tasted great.
