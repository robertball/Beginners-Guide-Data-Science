I used bocconcini (little fresh mozzarella balls) instead of the shredded mozzarella and red-ripe Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped.  I skipped the garlic salt - totally unnecssary.  To avoid a strong taste of raw garlic  I mixed the minced garlic with a little salt, then used the flat side of my chef's knife to mash it into a paste.  I added all ingredients to taste rather than measuring.  A plate of this and I'm happy.  Very happy.

Simple, delicious - and not just for summer! Although, I'll definitely remember this for summer when garden ripe tomatoes are in season. I subbed penne pasta for the linguini and opted to use fresh mozzarella that I sliced and chopped vs. shredded. I also used regular salt vs. garlic salt.  This is a great side dish for any meal or you could make this a meal in and of itself it's so good.  Next time I might add a splash of balsamic vinegar or a bit of crushed red pepper flakes for a little pizzaz!

Too much garlic!!!  I only used 1/2 the garlic, and it was still WAY too much.

I cut the recipe in half...and I'm annoyed I wasted 1/2 lb. of mozzerella.  This was just OK...very bland, and needed more Italian spices, like oregano, more salt, maybe rosemary.  I wouldn't even waste my time spicing this up and trying it again.  My husband asked me if this was the first time I made this (He knows I'm a good cook and that I am always making different meals.)  He asked where I got the recipe.  He then asked me to never make it again.

Absolutely delicious! I tweaked it a bit though! I added fresh baby spinach, more garlic, and freshly grated parmesean cheese. The entire family loved it! I also pan fried some chicken tenders to go on top.

This can be an excellent summer dish, but be aware that it would be best with fresh, ripe tomatoes.  If you grow tomatoes in your garden, or live near a good farm stand, you'll love this.  If you have to use tomatoes from the supermarket, it won't be nearly as good.  One other suggestion:  Instead of the shredded mozzarella, you can use bocconcini (little fresh mozzarella balls).

My whole family really enjoyed this pasta!  ...and yes, I made a major change, but not to the ingredients.  After marinating the tomatoes, cheese, basil and garlic, I warmed olive oil in a frying pan on medium heat and "stir fried" the ingredients for about two minutes, then added the angel hair pasta, removed the pan from the heat and stirred until the mozzarella was fully melted.  Easy peasy and so tasty!  Also, I used mozzarella balls as other reviewers had recommended.  Next time I make it, I think I'll use more garlic and add some sliced onions.  Thank you so much KDCG for this recipe!

Because I has a abundance of cherry tomatoes, I used those instead.  (about 45 cut in half = 1 1/2 cup packed)
I also reduced garlic to 3 cloves, & omitted garlic salt,
I reduced mozzarella to 3  cups (12 oz.) & added 1 cup (4 oz.) shredded Parmesan.
I also added 1/2 of a 6 oz. can of black olives. (cut in half)
Next time i make it I may add a little sweet Minny-Peppers (red & orange - for color)
