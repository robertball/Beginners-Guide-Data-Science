Very easy and tasty. We made it with some fresh veggies instead of frozen so the prep time was lengthened. Original recipe said 4 servings. They must be HUGE! I filled a large saucepan and didn't even use 2 10-ounce cans of tomatoes.

Delicious!  I used the frozen veges I had on hand, and I added a can of red kidney beans and about 32 oz of broth.  It makes a big pot of soup!

Best soup ever! 
I'm not really a "soup person", but this hearty soup is delish. Instead of the frozen mixed veggies, I added frozen corn and frozen chopped spinach. I also added a bit of cilantro. The soup was too thick, so I added water, but I suppose I could have added more chicken broth instead. It was very flavorful. We topped it with a dollop of sour cream and cheddar cheese, served with fresh corn bread.

I tried this without making changes to the recipe and it turned out great. This recipe was very easy to make as well as flavorful.  It needed no extra ingredients to make it tasty. This has definitely been added to my recipe box.

I served it over left over Spanish rice from this site and also made taco seasoning and dry ranch dressing from this site.  Awesome!  Served topped with sour cream and shredded cheese with good bread on the side.

I did not have the ranch seasoning on hand. So I just added a few extra seasonings to make up for that. It turned out really good and my husband went back for seconds.

This was so easy and very tasty!  I kept to the recipe except at the end I did add extra chicken broth only because I wanted more liquid to the soup.  It has a little kick but not to bad.  To add a little flare or maybe you need to tame the little bit of heat it gives, I put a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of Shredded Mexican Cheese to each bowl.  Yummy, I will make again. ***have made this several more times and still no need to change anything!

Made this tonight and doubled it as my family loves soup and spice, made it exactly as states but added some spinach to it and it was incredible.  The whole family loved it and barely had any left after doubling it.  I couldn't find the "ranch" chili beans but got the chili beans and they came as mild or hot, so I got 1 of each and that was pretty spicy with no other spices added.  Absolutely loved it and wouldn't change a thing, I love that it's so healthy too!!  Thank you!!

I had 10 ounces of ground turkey that had been in the freezer for too long, and it was time to use it up, so I basically made about half this recipe.  I used the full 1/2 cup of chopped onions, an entire 10 oz. bag of mixed veggies, one can of Rotel, an entire can of chili beans, the broth, and the taco and ranch mixes.  I sautéed the onions in a little EVOO and added a couple of cloves of minced garlic during the last minute of sauteeing.  Even though I’m not a huge fan of ground turkey, this turned out quite well.  My version yielded 6 cups of soup.

My husband loved this.....he said it was better than mom's chili! I did double the ranch beans and add an additional can of black beans. I also doubled the meat. Otherwise kept the recipe the same. Delicious!

So good!  I used veggie broth because that's what I had on hand as well as adding black and kidney beans. Topped with cheese, sour cram and baked tortilla strips! Yummy!

Easy and quick... the only thing I would change is to cook the turkey and onion together with the ranch seasoning and taco seasoning (instead of putting the seasonings in later)

Needed a good soup for my leftover smoked turkey from Thanksgiving. I used fresh carrots, celery, onion and frozen corn. This was very easy and interesting with the taco seasoning and ranch packets.

My new go to recipe! Everyone loves this soup!! I used lean ground beef instead of turkey and did not drain the little bit of grease left it for flavor. I served this soup in a bowl over tortilla chips and topped with onions, jalapeños and grated 3 blend Mexican cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  Yum yum!!

I think it would be great with two cans of tomatoes with chilies , as written, or one can and with one can of fire roasted diced tomatoes .  I made it the second way and it was perfectly spicy for us.

Made this for our stay outta the rain soup.   This was so easy.  I don't vary from receipts but I did not have a few things on hand.   No ranch beans (used kidney beans and a couple shakes of ranch dressing) left out green beans and give it extra corn, and cubed left over turkey and added it last cause it was all ready cooked.    The flavor was awesome.   My husband did not even doctor it with his jalapeño.   I topped our dishes with chopped fresh scallions and mixed Mexican cheese. Microwaved 30 seconds to melt cheese  and the Fritos corn chips on the side.   This is going to be our  winter soup for sure.  This soup is 297 calories per cup.   Carbs and sodium high.

Just made this for dinner this evening and it is a little on the spicy side, but it is very good!  I used what I had on hand, which was one can of Rotelle, one can of petite diced tomatoes, can of black beans, can of chili beans, can of cut green beans and can of corn.  That mixed with the ground turkey, packet of ranch dressing and packet of taco seasoning and 32 ounces of chicken broth and it turned out great!!!  Plan to serve it with cheddar cheese and sour cream on top and cornbread on the side.  Will definitely be making again.

Much better than I anticipated.  Makes way more than  4 servings.  A little salty.  I suggest making your own seasonings and use low sodium broth or mix with half water.

I don't like to use spicy tomatoes {with chilies}at all. I only used regular tomato cans.  Ate it with shredded cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips.

I used ground turkey, a little bit more than a pound. I also used a bag and a half of frozen veggies, and dried minced onion. 32 ounces of chicken broth and some extra chilies as well as a couple tsp. of chili powder. This makes a lot of soup...and it's yummy! Next time I'll make sure I have some sour cream on hand! Oh, and I used regular chili beans...didn't have the ranch chili beans...not sure if that would've made much of a difference or not. I'll make this again!

Very simple. Needs a little something to be great. I did not use Rotelle for the tomatoes -- it's too spicy.

Very good soup! I doubled the recipe and it was very spicy for my wife and some others who tried it. I then added 2 cans of tomato sauce and an extra can of chicken broth (like my soup with more broth). While it still had a little kick it was less spicy for those who did not like the heat. I am rating this on the original recipe, not the changes that were made. I think it is totally unfair to rate a recipe after changes have been made to the original. For my taste it was not overly spicy. Will definitely make again. Both versions were excellent.

I am so happy with how this soup turned out! Super fast, tasty and hearty. I followed the directions except I used black beans. With the green chili rotel, it had plenty spice for me but the hubs added hot sauce. We put shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips on top. All ingredients I usually have on hand so I'll be making this again for sure!

Different and GREAT! We love the difference of the mixed veggies and ranch packet. I used chili beans undrained for that's what I had on hand. Super easy soup to add to the mix--thanks!
