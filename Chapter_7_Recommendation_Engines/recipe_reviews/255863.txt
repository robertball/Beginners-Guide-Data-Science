This is my all-time favorite spice blend! It tastes amazing added to almost any dish. Some of my favorite ways to use it are as a dry rub for baked chicken wings, pan fried pork chops, cottage pie, and even just sprinkled over french fries for an added kick. I keep a large jar of it on hand for whenever inspiration strikes. If your grocery store sells bulk spices, thatâ€™s the best way to make this blend without spending a ton on money, since you can just buy what you need.

I did not have lime and  Tomato paste, so I substituted lemon juice and Heinz Ketchup.How the flavor of the sauce developed as it thickened.  This is my new signature dish.
  Thank you for sharing this recipe,
Alan Ehmke
