Good recipe, but 20 to 25 minutes is way too long for chicken thighs.  The sauce ends up burning.  Would reduce down to 15 minutes.  But the sauce is great!

I made this with breasts and just baked on a flat stone cookie sheet, came out great.I also used the extra marinade on top the chicken while it baked 375 about 45-50 min

I have made this several times now.  I really love it.  I baked at 400 degrees and until they reached 179 degrees.  Great flavor, will experiment with other flavors in the near future, but I think this is fantastic!

Great recipe! I modified it a bit, though. Fresh tomato in place of tomato paste, and Indian chili powder (2 teaspoons) instead of the pinch of cayenne. After marinating, I put the chicken in a skillet with all the sauce, brought to boil, then simmered for 25 minutes, and served with basmati rice and peas.

Good recipe! The sauce have a really nice flavor but it can burn easly, so I baked at 375 degrees for 45 minutes, added the rest of the marinate on the top of the chicken and baked for an additional 15 minutes. Next time I want to try this dish with chicken breast.

I took the advice from users and adjusted to cooking temp and time to 375 for 20 minutes - I drained the fat, turned the heat up to 450 and baked another 7 minutes.  My family said that it was one of the BEST tasting dishes they had ever tasted.  I served it with cilantro, lemon wedges and raw onions - thank God for leftovers :)
