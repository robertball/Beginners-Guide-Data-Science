This is a very famous recipe in Egypt, the one simple dinner to go to when you have hungry children or unexpected company. However, we use less tomato sauce and we add shredded cheese and black pepper on top of each egg .  The skillet is covered and cooked on low heat on top of the stove, no need for an oven.

Shakshuka Eggs in Purgatory Haiku: "There was too much sauce, but it tasted freaking great. We ate ours with naan." I look forward to making this again but using a 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes instead of 28 oz. My cast-iron skillet didn't want to accommodate 6 indentations w/ all that sauce, so I used 5 eggs instead, and it beautifully fed 2 adults and 1 child. Said child and I  saw Shakshuka during a Netflix binge of "Street Food Around the World" and she requested that I make it - it was a fun and different way to mix up our breakfast-for-dinner-Fridays.

My Jewish bf makes this for me all the time. He uses diced tomatoes (fresh, when available) instead of crushed, no bell peppers, and he simply covers the skillet to let the eggs cook instead of heating up the oven.He serves it with fresh pita breads from the middle eastern bakery.

Everyone loved it! I eliminated the hot pepper sauce because one of my kids will not eat anything hot, used diced tomatoes but less than what it calls for otherwise it would have been overwhelming, and covered the skillet instead of placing in the oven which worked just as well. Will make this again in a heartbeat.

If you are cooking dinner for guests who are dairy and gluten free, this is a great option.  There's a nice mix of flavors, and this dish looks attractive too.  The gluten fans among us ate it with toasted pita bread, and the gluten-frees ate it with corn tortilla chips.   It was a hit with some picky kids too.   I've made this twice, and as others have noted, there's too much sauce with 28 oz of tomatoes, so I used about 20 oz. the second time.  That was perfect.

This was a very simple recipe and it turned out beautifully. I followed this particular recipe step-by-step, except when I went shopping I forgot the cumin and pepper flakes, although I thought it turned out nicely anyways. I'll definitely be making this again.

I used a pablano pepper instead of the red pepper and hot sauce. Also used a 12" cast iron skillet. Fit perfectly.

I did not care much for this.  I would almost say too much flavor. Too tomato-y. It would be better with less tomatoes and some kind of bread or toast. Maybe some melted cheese on top to offset the flavor.

We make this dish every month or two, and we really like it.
We usually add about 8 oz. of spinach right before the simmer stage, and instead of putting it in the oven at the end, we cover the pan, lower the heat to simmer, and let it sit for 8-10 minutes.  
We both agree that it's not great as a leftover, so going forward we will just add the number of eggs that we want to eat that night (usually 2 a piece) and save the leftover sauce for something else - maybe a soup.
We most often have it with tortillas, but I think it's better with rice, because it cuts some of the tomato tanginess.

Maybe it just isn't my type of food.  It was way too spicy.  My husband felt like he was eating eggs and lots of salsa.

Very easy to make. The recipe fit easily in a 12" iron skillet. Here is a tip to try, use half of a poblano pepper instead of the green chilies in a can. Just enough heat. I did have to bake it longer to cook the eggs.

This is a solid 4.5 so I rounded up.  Needs way less tomato juice,  and recommend using rotel tomatoes and fire roasted as a good mix.

My favorite breakfast from now on! I love this. I put lid on the skillet and let the eggs set up that way instead of turning the oven on.

Wonderful! My version is a mix of many that I found on this site and another. I did use the red bell pepper however I did not use any cumin. I found fire roasted tomatoes with chopped green chilies at Trader Joe’s and some used those rather than adding extra chilies to plain diced tomatoes. I am glad I did not add any extra red pepper flakes or hot sauce as those tomatoes had a bit of heat all by themselves. I usually ere on the side of caution as not everyone likes things hot, and we can always add some heat after the fact.Made the sauce the night before-reheated when I got back from church. Once hot I will do the spinach on top of the sauce-and stirred it in before adding the eggs. This was a wonderful brunch-and I would make it for dinner!

Delicious! I mostly followed the recipe, but modified it slightly based off what I had read in other recipes and reviews. Instead of only using one seasoning, I used 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon of paprika. I let the sauce simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes, and then added the eggs until they were cooked.

I followed the recipe exactly and served with broiled garlic bread. Lots of juices to sop up. It was very good and we all enjoyed it but I probably won't make this again. The eggs were perfect but lost in all that flavourful sauce. Mine looked exactly as pictured.

I have made this a few times with a few different variations, and the thing that sticks out the most to me is that it always has a very tomato-y flavor. Obviously it’s tomato based so you’re going to taste tomato, but honestly it’s a bit overpowering! Up the spices, for sure. Other than that, super yummy, summer comfort-food-y, especially when you smear it all over a piece of toasted sourdough bread.

Love this dish! It's hearty and very quick and easy to make. I cooked the eggs the Chef John way: on top of the stove. And bc I tried it the night after I saw the recipe, I had no canned crushed tomatoes. So I improvised with one chopped fresh tomato, and fished off two almost-empty salsa jars. Yum yum!!

I made this after reading all the comments about too much sauce. I cooked it longer which reduced it and made it like a gravy and wow. I replaced the red bell pepper for green for more color, which also was better in my opinion. 

I also replaced the parsley for cilantro into the menu, I doubled the amount love cilantro, I also added a cup of jack and cheddar cheese and I just turn the heat off and put a lid on the pan to cook the eggs and don't bother with the oven. I haven't got the timing on the eggs yet either under or over cooked, haven't got that happy medium and all six eggs a perfect over easy. Needs more try's which I am happy to do it is a great simple, easy dish perfect on a cold day.

Next time we will cook the sauce longer and cover eggs on top of stove instead of oven. We served it with linguine and it was great. This is similar to an Argentinian sauce we used to make with chicken wings and drums. Loved it!
