Excellent recipe!  I can't stop eating it.  I was a bit confused with the two bunches of parsley, this seemed like a lot, but I did use two bunches wrapped with a rubber band.

Oh My Goodness!  This simple recipe was magic.  Even people who swore they would never eat anchovies took big heaping spoonfuls of this appetizer. Even teenagers!  I did not have overnight, so I let the mixture sit for approximately 4 hours at room temperature to macerate and mix the flavors...turned out great.  I soaked the anchovies for about 10 minutes in milk to leach out some of the saltiness, but next time I think I will just add the can with the flavored oil directly.  I used a food processor to mince, not puree.  I'm busy trying to think of more uses for this magic little sauce, (maybe stuff steamed artichokes and top with parmesean/mozarella?).  Thank you, Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Thank you for submitting this recipe!  My Grandmother used to make this in the Summer with fresh parsley from her garden.  She would serve it on delicious vine ripe red tomato slices. Mmmmm, a little bit of heaven!

When I read this recipe I found it to be strange. I was very iffy about a dip/spread made with......FISH! But I will always try something new because my motto is: you won't know if you like it unless you try it.  I literally finished making this less than 15 minutes ago. This was SOOOOOO good I just had to immediately hop on the computer and leave my review. I apologize for butchering your recipe but I did make changes based on ingredients I already had at home.  I used cilantro instead of parsley.I used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar.I didn't drain the anchovies and used the olive oil that was already in the can of anchovies instead of using the 1/2 cup of olive oil.I added 12 capers. I then dumped everything into my mini food processor and lightly pulsed until I liked the way it looked (maybe 10 super quick pulses).  I know it should marinate overnight but what can I say? I was CURIOUS! So I grabbed a veggie cracker just to dip the tip in next thing you know I'm carrying it to the living room to sit on the couch and dig in with veggie crackers and with celery sticks.  Thank you! I'm making this one of MY family recipes!

I make this without the anchovies, which probably makes it a totally different dish, but we really like it.  It is very garlicky, and great spread on rustic bread.

WOW!  I didn't think anyone else knew about this, nor called it the same thing we do!  My italian grandmother made this for us every Christmas. We dip slices of fennel bulb in this or if fennel is not available, celery.

This was awesome!  I made it with white vinegar, but I think I might try balsamic next time.  I'm not a huge fan of parsley, and I thought 2 bunches seemed like an awful lot, but I put it all in and was not disappointed!  If you like dipping your bread in olive oil and vinegar, you will love this!

I never had anything like this, but after all of the rave reviews, I wanted to try it with a nice Italian dinner. So glad I did.  The whole family loved it and it was even better the next day.  The second time I made it, I used one bunch of parsley and one bunch of cilantro-very yummy if you are a cilantro lover. Thanks for sharing your family recipe.

Big hit with my friends. Great flavor. Next time I make it, though, I will add the olive oil a little at time until it is just spreadable - 1/2 cup was too much.

This sounded really good, and I imagine that anyone who really likes parsley will like it, but it wasn't for me.  If I had grown up eating it, I'm sure I would absolutely love it, though!

I've made this 5 times. It always tastes better the next day, so if you have a chance to let the flavors marry overnight, do it. This is a great thing to serve at a wine/cheese party or at an Italian-themed night. It's great served on thick slices of tomatoes and on crusty bread.  I haven't tried it on burgers yet, but it would be a great topping!

Served it as a dip with Italian bread and it went so fast I barely got a taste of it myself. However, the mouthful I did get was absolutely incredible! Thank you.

Wonderful! Guests loved it.  Gave some to a friend who took it to a family gathering.  Was a great success with everyone.  Said it was a delicious topping for the main course meat as well.

I thought this was good, but I’m not sure how often I would make it. I think parsley fresh out of the garden might be helpful and I would also add the anchovy slowly until you’re happy with the taste. It was good for something different and I will try it again at some point. I think if you've grown up with it then it is probably like a taste of home. For someone like me that has never had it I didn't find it THAT amazing.

I rated this recipe a few days ago at 2 or 3 starts. Since then its sat in the fridge for the total of 8 days and now its beginning to be good food. The parsley and other ingredients have released enough flavors and those have had the chance to ripen. I will make this again but WELL in advance of serving day!

I used the steel blade in the processor and chopped the parsley up super fast stems and all (after trimming). This is wonderful! Very good nutrition. Better with age as the herbs infuse in the oils and release their flavor/nutrients. Nobody even knew it had anchovies in it and I wasn't going to say anything! One of mama's secrets! A keeper! I put a T. in my cup of soup and beans too. YUM! Excellent condiment. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

A superb recipe! Don't be miserly with the ingredients - esp. the parsley and garlic - it's meant to be really intense. We spread it thinly onto italian ciabatta bread or white baguette and our guests are always very impressed! It almost makes me blush to get so much praise for such little effort!

We did not care for this recipie.  It was really salty.  I had never tried whole anchovy filets before. Maybe that was why.

This "Boniet" was a tasty treat for a weekend brunch. I made mine a day ahead as recommended for better flavor; however, I found that it also tasted good when freshly made (just less of an anchovy flavor). If I were to make this again I would use Italian parsley (2 bunches of parsley = 3 cups of parsley). I served my boniet over fried slices of zucchini and eggplant, and will  also try it with slices of tomato and fennel as suggested by other reviewers. I think it would also taste nice as a sauce on white fish. Thank you Suzi-Q for sharing your recipe.

Served this for 7 guests. I did not like it, too much olive oil as other reviewers have already commented on. Most of the guests loved it! The fresh parsley is wonderful, as is the garlic. I am commenting because I think the anchovy is essential, but difficult to hide. I processed the parsley, garlic, and anchovies in a food processor but the anchovies still came out in big chunks that left an unpleasant after taste for some of my guests. I think it may be better to process the anchovies into very small pieces first, or use half of the amount suggested.  I noticed other reviewers wash the anchovies first, but I think the salt is essential to the recipe.

Just made this, haven't tried it yet. But for those that don't know (I didn't!), one "bunch" of parsley equals 1-1/2 cups!

Made this for a dinner party I had this weekend and it was amazing! Made it according to the recipe and served with warm ciabatta bread. It was a hit!! Thank you!

Although this was a good appetizer next time I would add less vinegar. Overall, very tasty.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I made it for my Italian grandmother, but ended up having to make a second batch because my friends gobbled up the first. I would have NEVER thought this would be so delicious - I normally hate anchovies. Such a nice surprise! Thanks again!

This is a great change from the 'creamy' dips. You must let it sit overnight to get its full potential. Add the anchovies, you cant taste them directly and makes a world of difference. This is very similar to a chimichuri sauce.

Wow, intense flavor!  The anchovies gave the spread/dip enough salt for sure and you really didn't notice any fish flavor until the end of your bite.  It didn't hit my palate right for some reason.  I agree with another reviewer maybe a different softer tasting vinegar (for my taste)?  Just my opinon tho.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Took it to a dinner party and it was a big hit. Not a drop left. Everyone asked for the recipe. Didn't change a thing. Even those who weren't anchovy fans loved it.

I have made this recipe on numerous occasions that I've found myself with an over abundance of parsley. 2 bunches of parsley isn't too much, since it's tha main ingerdient. I was amazed at how people were drawn to the pungent aroma of this dish. Most of my guests were also shocked that they loved this dish too.

I made a few changes and it was a big hit. I actually cooked this down in a sauce pan to make a thick tapanade-like spread. I also added some diced sun dried tomatoes. Delicious!

This is a unique recipe and I appreciate that.  It smells fantastic!  I like the ease of making and small amount of ingredients.  It tasted very very good.  Next time I will use a little else oil.

Just the kind of recipe I was looking for (to use up some extra anchovies and parsley, but without olives)! I cut the oil in half. I hope to try substituting 1 T. of the white vinegar with 1 T. Balsamic vinegar next time, as someone already suggested. I combined the ingredients in a food processor, but won't next time (parsley was pureed too finely, so not as pretty and doesn't keep as long). Actually, next time, I might pulse all ingredients in a food processor except the parsley (and then stir in the parsley), just to make sure there aren't any anchovy pieces.

This was a very unique appetizer dish.  It was a bit heavy for me so I couldnt eat too much in one sitting.  The ingredients hold very well so I can keep it for a while in the fridge and eat it a little bit here and there.  I would suggest cutting down on the serving size so you know what it tastes like before making a huge batch.  Ill try making this next time for our dinner guests and see what they say.  Thank you.

This is SO good. Because of the acidity of some of the ingredients, I was surprised by how rich and mellow this is. I live in Texas, and we eat EVERYTHING with tortilla chips. This is great with tortilla chips! Eating this with bread reminds me of spinach dip. 
This is an addictive spread, and I will be sure to make it for EVERY party I have or go to in the future. It's really unusual, but really good and oddly familiar and comforting.

I am stunned and thrilled, because I honestly thought I'd never find this recipe. I thought my grandma made it up! This pungent spread is one of my all-time favorite foods. Grandma was an Italian lady who always grew an abundance of parsley, so in the summer we had an abundance of boniet! I didn't even know how to spell it until today. TRY IT! Grandma's recipe had only four ingredients: parsley, anchovies, garlic, and EVOO. I'd give anything to have her make more for me! One can become addicted to this stuff. In the dead of winter I crave it because it means summer to me!

I have made this "Boniet" many times. The difference between "like" and "love" is using the high-quality ingredients available at the Italian grocery store instead of the ingredients from the regular supermarket (KYKNOS tomato paste; ALLESSIA anchovies in a jar, weighted on my own scale for measuring). I also used my own homemade herb-infused vinegar. Thank you Suzi-Q for sharing your recipe.

I AM 86, ATE IT AS A BOY, MADE IT LATER IN LIFE.
OUR NORTHERN ITALIAN RECIPE DID NOT USE TOMATO PASTE.  TWO BATCHES WERE  ALWAYS  MADE,  ONE WITH
RED HOT PEPPER FLAKES.   WE AGED IT SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE EATING.

Ciao! My recipe from my nona is similar to yours but no tomatoes. 
It's  parsley, garlic and only a few anchovy filets.  We grind it up with some of the anchovy oil, olive oil, a splash of red wine vinegar, a bit of fresh or dried peperoncino and salt and pepper to taste. Buon apetito!

It reminds me of chimichurri sauce/pesto.  We enjoyed it very much but it doesn't look like the photo.  It is very green like pesto.  I'll keep it and make again.  Very different, which I like.

I made this for an italian themed dinner that I had.  It was a very good appetizer and was very different from anything I have had before.  Even my super picky brother was intrigued and enjoyed it.  I thought it was a fun change of pace from the usual things I make.  I can't say that it was my favorite appetizer I've ever made but still tasty.

Too much anchovy taste. I ended up throwing most of it away. I  may try again with less anchovy, although it reminded me more of a pesto and less of a dip.

I made this for a coctail party and it was a big hit.  It's a geat, easy addition to a pot luck or a coctail party...I served it with crusty peasant bread.
