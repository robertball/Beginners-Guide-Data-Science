A *huge* hit with everyone! I've made this about 6 times now and have found that as long as you make sure the cake batter is level with the cake pan you're using (before you put it in the oven), it'll cook to perfection with the least amount of mess. I use frozen peaches on top and fold about 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries into the cake batter. I find that frozen fruit works best; try and pick a 'sturdy' fruit for the top (tried frozen strawberries once and they went to virtual mush).I *triple* wrap my pan with aluminum foil and put it on a cookie sheet for extra spillage. I have an old school springform pan that doesn't have the buckles, which seems to work better than a regular springform pan. Be *very* careful when lifting off the aluminum foil from the pan; the caramel sauce is very hot! This is totally a keeper! Thanks for a scrumptuous recipe ;)

I used a 9x13 pan for about 50 minutes and it came out perfect.  Yummy!

What a great cake! It's moist, light, not too sweet and has an absolutely delicious caramelized top. I used a deep angel food cake pan which worked perfectly. I also followed other reviewers suggestions and lined a pan with foil for the cake pan to sit on. Great for clean up! I found that using that kind of pan meant I only had to bake it for 65 minutes so be sure and check for doneness sooner than indicated in the recipe. Thanks!

I made this with peaches and my family thought it was very good.  Watch the temperature, though; I only had to bake it for 75 min.

Fantastic. I made the cake portion as directed, and thought it was perfect. In the baking recipes I'm familiar with brown sugar is measured "packed", so I did that for the topping here too - that gave a little too much to the (heavenly) sauce, next time I'll just measure the two cups out - chalk that up to the inexperienced baker. I also didn't bother to measure the peaches, just sliced and arranged them until the pan was full which seemed to work wonderfully. Not having the deep 10" pan I used an 8x11, which JUST BARELY held the cake and still leaked some sauce in the oven: a 9x13 should work great next time. The 8x11 needed just under an hour for bake time. Very rich, satisfying, impressive and simple enough to turn out - thanks very much for sharing!

I covered a cookie sheet in tin foil and placed the pan on top of that. It was so nice to just throw that mess in the garbage.. The cake itself was really nice, I used peach and raspberry. Next time I'm thinking of putting peach inside the cake, raspberry on top and less caramel. I also think I'll cut the recipe in half and put it in a springform-bundt pan, just so it looks nicer. The women at work all loved this recipe and I will make it often. Thank you!!!

I substituted a raspberry/marionberry/blueberry mix for the peaches, calorie-free sweetener for sugar, and egg substitute for eggs, and the recipe was still fabulous!  I also halved the recipe, because I cooked for just me husband and myself (cooking time was just 45 minutes).  I used a 9" springform pan, and even though I wrapped foil around it, as soon as I inverted the cake after baking, berry juice dripped everywhere, making quite a mess for me to clean up.  However, the flavor and texture were fabulous - and light vanilla ice cream made a great addition!

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet.  I have made it several times and it was always a hit.  I use a non-stick bundt pan and bake it 45-50 minutes and it is perfect.  No dripping, either.

I made this this weekend and it was a hit for my 18 year old son who doesn't like sweets and my boyfriend who does.  I read the reviews and decided to make it in two pans, it came out good but would have been ok to make in one pan.  I think my pan is deep enough to support the full amount.  This is a keeper.

Great recipe! 

I used an apple which has been sitting on the kitchen counter for about a week which no one wanted to eat anymore. I peeled, cored and sliced it thinly. 

I also melted the butter and sugar (only a cup of sugar) directly into my 9 inch round and deep baking pan (I didn't want to was another pan) before arranging the apples on top and also squeezed in about 2 tablespoons of honey.

I had no trouble removing the cake an there was no overflow or spillage yet I think the one cup of sugar was just the right amount of caramel.

This is a keeper and I plan to use it for our next brunch get-together!

Really good and large enough to feed a crowd...I used an 11 inch springform.  I marinated the peaches in 2 tbsp.  Bourbon for about 2 hours, adds a whole other dimention to the cake. Also increased the spices, 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. Added a layer of 1/2 cup chopped, toasted pecans after the peaches went in.  I don't like super sweet toppings so for the carmel I just made 1/2 the amount and was perfect for us.

This cake was delicious!  We made it with thawed, frozen peaches and it was just beautiful.  When first reading the recipe I thought 90 minutes was a long time and it might come out "tough" but it was absolutely perfect.  I thought about giving this  recipe a 4 because it was such a mess (the sauce leaked out of the springform pan, through the foil I wrapped it in, and baked onto the bottom of my oven), but in the end the flavor and uniqueness of the dish pushed it up to 5 stars!

This cake was a lot of work but it was worth it! I made it in November so peaches were completely out of season but we still had some frozen blackberries so I used that. I couldn't really taste a whole lot of caramel but it was delicious either way. I had a few variations: I used 3 cups of blackberries instead of peaches, I used 2 eggs and 2 eggs worth of egg substitue, almond milk instead of regular milk and I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour. Even with all of those changes, it was fabulous and we will definitely be making it again soon.

Since this recipe stated that a variety of fruits could be used, I decided to use 3 cups of fresh Mangos, for the fruit.  I did everything else exactly as the recipe is written.  Mine came out quite well done on the edges, a bit hard & dry, and the center was  undercooked.  I really couldn't leave it in any longer as it would have scorched the edges. ...I baked the 10" springform in a 350 degree CONVECTION oven....

Wow- sugar overload!! Don't get me wrong, I have a serious sweet tooth, but this was out of control. I followed direction to the "T" but it turned out funky. The butter/brown sugar sauce on the bottom called for too much brown sugar, or not enough butter. The result was an overly sweet, gritty caramel sauce instead of the desired "gooey" sauce. And in my opinion this flavor did not at all compliment the peaches or the cinnamon flavored cake. I served it at a family get-together and people commented that it was as if they were eating two different desserts- a spiced cake and a caramel dessert- in one. The cake went almost untouched, which is unheard of in my family!

I followed the recipe except to cook it in a 9X13 pan.  It was not ooey gooey and I thought the cake was too dense and a bit dry.

Sorry Coleen.  I had trouble with this recipe in that I used a large centre-hole tube pan with removeable insert and double-foil-wrapped it yet there was so much juice and syrup collected in the foil, some of which bubbled out and and burned all over my oven.  I used 4 medium peaches but they created so much juice in baking that it ended up a mess even though I held the baked cake over a measuring cup and pierced the foil through the centre hole to drain the juices.  I had one cup of juices (and more burned on my oven bottom) and put the juices into the freezer trying to solidify them but of course they never did and after spooning some over the top, ended up tossing the rest.  I had mixed some fresh blueberries into the cake batter because coffee cakes are usually drier, but I too realized the cake was dry which was why I tried to spoon some sauce on top.  Baking for 90 minutes was perhaps a contributing factor to the amount of juice accumulated.  Refrigerating it overnight just accentuated the soggyness. I may try putting this into a 9 x 13 pan to distribute the base and peaches mixture over a larger area and cutting the bake time down to 60 minutes, or simply trash this recipe and go back to my "old faithful" with a hot milk sponge cake batter.   To me it was a waste of time and ingredients and I had to clean my oven after to boot!

The cake was good and filling. I used one can of peaches that filled my 9x13 pan perfectly. I read some reviews that said to add some fruit to the cake itself, and used a container of raspberries- totally unnecessary and I think it actually took away from the peaches. It had a very strong cinnamon taste, though I think my partner may have added a tbsp instead of a tsp. I think it could be better, just not sure how.

This cake is huge!  Use a very large pan.  A 9 x 13 or even larger if you have it will do the trick or a 12" spring form pan.  I started the layers in an 9" square pan but had enough cake batter left over to bake another cake so I just added some frozen berries and a strussel topping and made a second cake with the left over batter.

The cake rises up a lot and the sauce will run over if you don't have a deep enough pan.  I learned this the hard way and ended up having to clean my oven.  The cake is tasty but the taste of the peaches I used was lost somehow.  

I was disappointed that the flavour of the fruit was lost so probably won't make this again as an upside down cake although I might use the batter part to make two "coffee" cakes with fruit in the batter and a strussel topping.

This was delicious!  I used frozen peaches for mine.  I baked it for 55 mins in a 9x13 pan due to only have a 9 inch springform and the last time I tried a recipe that needed the 10 inch in the 9 it did not end well.. lol.  It came out great!  I personally would add more spice to the batter next time.  It just needed a little something.  But it was a great cake, otherwise.

Wonderful cake.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using a 9" springform pan and a little (maybe 3"?) springform pan as well.  I wrapped my bigger pan in three layers of foil, but it still dripped some onto the oven floor.  The smaller pan made a cute little cake.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  I have made this cake as directed and I have halved the recipe.  The cake came out perfect both ways.  Watch the cooking time it is easy to overcoock.

I was very excited to try this recipe thinking that I could use just about any fruit.  I used fresh peaches and followed the recipe exactly as stated.  The 90 minute baking time should have been a warning to keep an eye on it.  Now I see that many of the other reviews baked for much less time, some as little as half the time.  My cake cracked after flipping it because I didn’t make sure the batter was completely level before being placed in the oven.  I’m disappointed and don’t know if I will try this recipe again primarily because of the wide variety of baking times ranging from 45 minutes to 90 minutes. But if I do I guess I’ll be poking it with a lot of toothpicks.  Butch

Turned out beautifully and didn't even make too much of a mess! I wrapped my spring pan in foil and it helped quite a bit.

This is a wonderful cake.  I used too small of a pan (9 inch square) and had a bubbling over problem with the caramel, so beware of that.

This makes a HUGE cake.  I used a big lasagna pan and it didn't overflow.  I made mine with one large can of peaches, but wish I had used more fruit and even more topping.  It was delicious but we got tired of it after a few days and some of it went in the garbage.  Very nice if you have a crowd and some nice vanilla ice cream to serve it with.  I will make again when there are more people around!

I used apples, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  I thought the cake was a bit dense, but my hubby loved it!  Maybe if I used a lighter oil instead of solid fat, it could lighten up the cake a bit.

Disaster.  The cake never rose and I was left with something that had the consistency of a soggy bread pudding.  Also, even though I halved the sugar for the cake itself, it was so sickeningly sweet, it set my teeth on edge. OK, so I halved the receipt (4 eggs, 3 1/3 cups flour?  How many people was this cake for!).  I'll never make it again.

One of the best cakes I’ve made. Used frozen peaches and put it in a 9X13 nonstick pan. I put the pan on a baking sheet, but it didn’t spill over. Baked it for 50 minutes and cooled for 10 minutes. Came out like a charm and looked gorgeous. The cake is so tender and light. Not too sweet. The fruit and caramel added the perfect sweetness. This was a huge hit and we ate way too much of it today.

Followed the ingredients exactly but did a 9x13 pan which I baked for 45 minutes. Flipped out onto a baking sheet after 15 minutes. PHENOMENAL recipe that’s moist & flavorful. I didn’t measure peaches just lined the bottom of the pan.

I made this with fresh peaches. It was very very good... a hit with the family!
I used a 9 1/2 in springform pan and it came out beautiful.  It did take 90 minutes to bake, so I put foil on top after and hour so it would not get too brown.

Read the reviews and CAKE pan size before making this one.  It says, 'a 10" DEEP cake pan' not a pie pan.  I read the reviews and made the cake as written, with the exception of the cake pan.  I used a 16'x4'x'4 long loaf pan and it was the perfect size for the cake.  The topping was good, and very, very sweet.  A nice use of fresh peaches.

The top (bottom) was good, but the actual cake was dense and kind of mealy or something.  Also, the flavor was actually not as good as a boxed cake mix. Not my favorite.

This is great.  I used a 9" springform and a 6" cake pan.  Doing this helped to prevent the overflow problem but I still used a foil lined pan to catch anything seeping from the springform  I cooked the 9" 70 mins at 325, 6" about 60 mins at the same temp.  This is a keeper recipe.  I may add additional complimentary spices next time I use peaches (I used frozen) for the cake.  It's moist and I'll make this again. Thanks for sharing.
