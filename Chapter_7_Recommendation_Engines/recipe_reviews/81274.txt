The bread crumbs made a textured gravy rather than coating the pork cubes.  It is a bland recipe and perhaps that is your liking.

This was absolutely delicious....I forgot to add the vinegar at the end but still really good, I served it with cheesy creamy mashed potatoes and it was a hit.  My dad said it was a heirloom recipe!! :) Definitely would recommend this to others.

This was very yummy!  The flavor was incredible.  I didn't have any shallots but I don't know that that even mattered!  This is on the menu for sure now!
