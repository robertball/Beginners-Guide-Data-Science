This is a fast, flavorful and filling family meal.  For a more economical version I substituted browned ground beef and it still tasted great.  I forgot to add the onion wedges to the rice, so sauteed them with the beef.  Tasted great!  Great meal when you're in a hurry!

Just average.  A previous reviewer mentioned stir-frying the beef separately, and, after trying this recipe as-is, I completely agree.  Plus, this needs a LOT more flavor (hot pepper flakes, garlic, ginger).  I think I'll keep rice-a-roni as a side dish, thank you very much.

My family enjoyed it very much.  I followed the advice of others and browned the meat seperatly and added it later.

Glowing reviews all around, this recipe made 3 kids and 3 adults very happy tonight! I did substitute vegetable oil for the margarine called for, as I just didn't think a buttery taste in a beef dish sounded very good. I also stir-fried the beef separately til browned, before following the rest of the directions as written, and the meat came out very tender. I chose a red bell pepper to contrast the green broccoli, which made a very pretty dish, and my two-year-old kept asking for more "red!" Thanks a million Rice-a-Roni!
