I used three eggs instead of two, so that it would be a bit higher, but the tart still ended up quite thin. Not a problem if you're serving a light breakfast or  lunch for two. I made it the day before and just popped it under the broiler before breakfast - very nice taste although I will use more pepper flakes next time. It looks beautiful too, so a lovely dish to serve to guests. Will make it again.

I am eating this right now. It was so easy and tastes so good.  I didn't have the bread crumbs, so I crushed some cheesy crackers and used them instead. I also threw in one extra egg when it looked like I wasn't going to have enough mixture to cover my base (I was using an oversized pie plate). Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The crackers were fine. I don't think the extra egg changed much other than the volume. The fresh herbs are a must - that's where all the flavour comes from. With a salad and a glass of wine, this is a great 'girl's night in' dish. So pleased.

I added some pasta, hummus and vegetables to the recipe which changed my oven time to 30'. On top of the bread crumbs layer, I put pasta and hummus. Then, broccoli, a carrot, 3 mushrooms, a few dried tomatoes and half of an onion (chopped). I had to add some half and half to the egg mix to cover the vegetables better. A generous amount of olive oil on top and voila! Delicious!
