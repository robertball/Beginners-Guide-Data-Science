I love this recipe but decided to play with it the second time around.  I replaced the green onion with about 1/8 c of chopped shallots and marinated the snapper for about 5 minutes in the sauce.  It came out excellent!

This was very good and worthy of making again.  The lemon sauce was very tangy.  Salt and pepper needs to be added to taste, and perhaps a little cayenne or cajun spice might go well.

Excellent dish. Very quick and easy to prepare. I took the fish out of the pan and reduced the marinade for use as a sauce to pour over the fish.It turned out well.

My husband has eaten a lot of red snapper over his lifetime and said this is the best he's ever had!  I also made it for my mom, who doesn't like fish, and she loved it.  She wants me to make it every time I make fish for her.  Thanks!

Add a little salt and pepper to the marinade – it will help punch up the flavours. I also cooked on high heat and sprayed the pan with some non-stick spray. I let the mixture reduce and slightly brown which made the dish look a lot nicer than some of the photo's I saw of this dish.

This was very very easy and delicious.  I marinated my fish for about 20 minutes or so first at room temp, then popped it in the skillet.  A keeper!  Loved it!  Thanks!

This is a great way to prepare snapper.  This was excellent served with rice pilaf and steamed vegetables.

I used cooking spray instead of oil to bring the fat content down and it turned out great!  It was a unique flavor and therefore worthy of serving at a dinner party.  I will make this again.

I am rating the sauce only for this recipe - EXCELLENT! I have been looking for a NON-cream/dill sauce for hubby's fish and I have now found it! I broiled red snapper that had just been seasoned with fresh cracked pepper only and a light drizzle of Olive Oil, while the fish was broiling, I prepared the sauce with just adjusting the amounts of the ingredients to our taste as I went along, here is what I used: 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp white wine vinegar (do not have rice wine vinegar), 2 tbsp honey and added about a tbsp of chopped, fresh parsley (left out the ginger, we are not a fan)...brought ingredients to a boil and then simmered until thick, added the parsley in at the last minute, hubs RAVED over it! :) My new go-to fish sauce! Thanks!

Just great. I do not cook alot of fish but this was great.  I took the suggestion from Gitano June 28, 2011.  I soften some garlic butter and brushed it on first and then seasoned with ground sea salt and fresh ground black pepper.   I broiled mine also.  I used fresh grated ginger, good honey and good extra virgin olive oil.  I usee fresh chives instead of green onions.   We like sauce, so I increased the sauce portions and made it ahead, so when the fish was ready so was the sauce.  Served with Jasmine rice and fresh green beans and carrots, it was worthy of any restaurant.  Will make again.  Thanks... Allrecipes....

Happy Father's Day!! My grocer was out of red snapper so I used chilean sea bass instead. OMG!! Anyone who hasn't tried this recipe, please hurry. For those who have, please try it with sea bass. My husband and sons are out of their minds with satisfaction today. I wish I could give this recipe more stars. And thanks to the other reviews, I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper and marinated it in a little of the sauce before I cooked it. A-mazing!!!

Great recipe!  I had to make changes only because I didn't have the exact ingredients!  I used Agave Nectar instead of honey.  I used purple onion instead of green.  I drizzled some olive oil in the pan before I placed the fish in it and then I did remove the fish from the pan, poured marinade in pan and reduced it and then put the fish back in and simmered it for the last 2 - 3 minutes.

Excellent flavor and balance.  Even my kids enjoyed this!  The only change I made to the recipe as listed was using apple cider vinegar in place of the vinegar called for.  (This was mostly because I had it on hand.)  Flavor was full with a sweet tang.

Yummy Red Snapper!!! I didn’t have rice vinegar so I used white vinegar. I didn’t have green onion so I used onion powder and parsley flakes for color. I also ground sea salt over each filet just to try it out. Then for fun I grilled it instead. It came out wonderful! My husband liked it and wants to use it again. I did rub the ingredients in and let sit for 30 min before we grilled the snapper.

Made this for hubby two days ago.  He said I could serve it in a restaurant.  This is the highest compliment I have ever gotten for my cooking (got it before for dessarts).  Coming from him, it means a lot because he is usually such a critic and he has definitely eaten at his share of fancy restaurants.  I almost didn't make this dish because the snapper at the supermarket was $7 a piece.  But this was $14 well-spent.  Will definitely make again.

This get 5 stars for the amazing taste and the fact that its super easy!

Even without the sugar and vinegar we loved it.  I prefer slightly caramelized onions so I cooked them first and then added the other ingredients.  When the onions were how I like them I allowed it all to cool then put the fish in to marinate for 10.  Seriously amazing flavors that allow for play, kind of like a pasta sauce recipes.  Definite keeper!

This is definitely a gourmet fine dining experience that takes very little time to make! The flavor is wonderful and the snapper turns out very moist. My husband and I LOVED this and will save in our favorite recipe file. I reduced the ginger by half because I didn't want it to be too strong, and I thought it turned out perfect.  A must try - you won't be sorry.

I made this for dinner last night and it was superb. I used frozen red snapper (thawed), because the store had none fresh, and it came out great. You could use any fish in this recipe and I will try others.

This was a great recipe!  I'm lucky enough that my spearfishing boss brings ocean fresh snapper to work weekly during spear season!! I had to use agave syrup because I had no honey and red wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar, but it was still amazing!  My wife walked in and said immediately it smelled like a Japanese kitchen (thanks to the ginger) but we both loved it.  Thanks for sharing!!

This was super easy to make and the ingredients are commonly found in my kitchen, which I love.  I made as directed, but there was something about the sauce that didnt sit right.  I dont know if it was the lemon or the honey, but I have used these together before.  I just cant put my finger on what I didnt care for.  If I make again, I will play with it a bit.

This looked great, but I modified the marinade.  I added a dash of sesame oil and cayenne, and took out the rice vinegar and honey and then marinated the fish for a couple of hours and cooked it on a cedar plank on the grill.  Also, took the left over marinade and added 1/4 of white wine and reduced it on the stove to make a sauce... AMAZING.

Easy!!  My family loved it.  The only thing I did differently was substituted white wine for the rice vinegar since I didn't have any on hand.  Will definitely make again!

I couldn't find red snapper fillets so I used tillapia filets instead...I did the marinate recipe as is and added salt, pepper and garlic to taste to season the fish. It was really good, it had a very delicate flavor. Next time I will let it marinate for longer.

This was a great recipe! I used a bit more fresh lemon juice, and I added a bit of melted butter to the merinade. I washed & dried the fish, lightly salted and peppered and let sit for 5 minutes. Then I let it sit in the merinade for 5 min/side. I had the skillet pretty hot so that I got a bit of browning on both sides of the fish before I added the remaining merinade to finish off the dish. My wife raved!

This is gonna sound kinda weird. I did the recipe exactly and I could have sworn I had ginger. Well, I didn't. I wasn't gonna throw the stuff away so I started searching in the spice rack and after much thought decided to put curry powder. Here's the kicker: IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!

This recipe rocks! I love the complexity of the flavors of the sauce. Those of you who substituted regular vinegar for the rice vinegar probably found the dish more sour--the rice vinegar adds nice sweetness.  I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, maybe a little more ginger. Good! This one is a keeper.

Good and tasty, but a little too acidic.  Lots of vinegar.  I still enjoyed it but I don't think I'll make it again.

This was easy and has an excellent flavor. I'm looking for more fast fish recipes and this is a keeper. I mixed the marinade ingredients in a freezer baggie, squished it around and then added the fish and let it sit for about an hour. I cooked it as per the recipe. What a delicious sauce! I think I'll try it with fresh ginger next time.

I went light on the lemon juice and added two tablespoons of white flour to the remaining marinade for a thicker sauce to pour on top of the snapper before I served it. Tangy! I thought the vinegar was overpowering but my husband liked it very much.

This was fantastic and no mess to clean up.  I used candied ginger because that was all
I had.  I added sliced red tomatoes to the plate because this fish was so white
the plate needed some "color".  It was so quick.  I'll make this dish often. Thanks!

I did like others suggested and used the remaining juice as a sauce, once I rendered it down. I added chipolte to just about everything and it was outstanding. Will make again! I made it with black rice, which is outstanding also, I squeezed an orange and added along with more chipolte. Threw in some veggies and it was tip top!

Sweet & tangy.  I made the sauce and used it shrimp in the pan.  It tasted delicious.  I will try it again with red snapper, or shrimp.  It's a winner!

Awesome recipe! Even my daughter, who doesn't like fish, loved it. I would definitely recommend this recipe and will for sure make it again. Not only is it yummy, it's really easy--I added fresh ground salt and pepper and used fresh ginger, but would otherwise change nothing else, except making more of the sauce. Served with asparagus and couscous or rice--great healthy dinner!

Definitely gourmet, but it did taste good. Our snapper was very moist after cooking and the sweet/sour flavor was good. We served with baked red potatoes, veggies, and baked french bread!

Very good. I actually marinated the snapper for about 3 hours and it took on the flavor really nicely. I also cooked the sauce separate from the snapper as I had thin fillets and they were done quickly (and I don't like over-done fish). It's a quick dish that works really well for a busy week night and the reduced sauce is very lovely. With a salad on the side, this is a perfect dinner.

I made this last night with some snapper and it turned out very nice.  I went light on the ginger because my husband is not a big fan (only used 1/2) but he said I could bump it up to 3/4 next time, since he really couldn't taste it at all.  Definitely a keeper!

I did make the pink snapper tonight. The presentation was wonderful, but the vinegar taste ruined the whole dish. I followed the recipe; did not change a thing and double checked my measurements. I would make this again, but reduce the vinegar to 1 Tbsp or even just a teaspoon.

I just made this tonight for dinner and it was just MEH. I was looking for a quick and easy recipe where I had all ingredients at home. This one was it! The only thing i swapped was the rice vinegar; i didn't have any so i used white wine vinegar instead.
I followed the recipe to a T, but I've got to say that the flavor didn't pop -it wasn't bad- it just wasn't anything special. I also thought the snapper would be more of a pan seared result, but was more on the sauteed'ish side, which made the texture of the fish not flaky but more like gummy or chewy. Again, not a terrible thing, just not what I expected. My family ate most of it to be nice, but it definitely was not a fave and I won't be making it again.

I made the recipe last night. My husband and I thought it was great. I used bottled lemon juice because I did not have any fresh lemons. I also made the fish in the oven instead of pan frying it because I did not have filets. Instead, I had a whole red snapper fish.  The recipe still worked great. 

What I loved most about the recipe is that I was able to use things that I already had in my pantry/fridge. I give it 5 stars because it was easy and tasty.
I will definitely make this recipe again.

I tried this recipe and it was a hit.  The sauce is what really made the dish great.  I'll make that sauce again with other pan seared fish.

Very good, quick recipe. Sauce is excellent. First time trying and its delish. I used agave instead of honey (allergic) and it came out great. Will use a bit less vinegar and lime next time.

We tried this once and are now cooking this dish a couple times a month. The kids love it and so do our guest. We add a dozen dry capers to the sauce once in a while for added flavor. Once we tried this sauce on three different fish one night and found that it only really worked with the red snapper. Great recipe.

I am one of the few who did not care for this recipe. The only thing I did differently was to double the recipe as I had double the amount of fish. Not to our liking at all!

Excellent.  But I suggest you DOUBLE the serving size, 'cause four ounces will not be enough of this delicious recipe!  I substituted fresh lime juice at two thirds ratio for a brighter flavor.

This dish was soooo simple, quick and DELICIOUS!!  I made it Saturday and Sunday and my husband and sons loved it!  Sunday I made it with coconut rice and it was a pure hit! I made little changes (added salt, pepper, garlic powder to the fish - didn't have rice wine vinegar, but had Mirin and Rice Vinegar so used both equally) I will keep this as a "shoe in" for a quick meal! I HAD to give this 5 stars because it is just tooo easy to make!

This recipe was very good... quick and easy.  I accidentally left out the honey, and sub'ed leeks for scallions... it was still delicious!  I plan on preparing it again, next time following the exact recipe.

It was good, but a bit too vinegary for me.  Might use half the vinegar next time.   The fish came out great though.

Just made this for dinner for mt husband and I.  It was really good!!  I marinated it for around 30 minutes, and I think that the flavor was intense because I let it sit longer than it stated.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Just prepared this for the second time.  I omitted the honey because of the side I served with it and it was as delicious as the first time. I served with with a mango couscous recipe I love ( has raisins, cliantro, parsley and lime among it's ingredients).  It was a perfect compliment.  This is one recipe that didn't have me wanting to substitute or change up.  It is simple, fast, healthy and company worthy!!

Very good recipie.  I doubled the marinade and added one pound of large shrimp (this was for 3 people). I cooked the shrimp first, removed them and cooked the fish. I returned the shrimp to the pan with the extra marinade.  Served with couscous and a salad.

I altered this recipe quite a bit, but it was a terrific starting point!  I did not use the honey or mustard and I used chopped up fresh ginger instead of ground.  I marinated my snapper (skin on one side to ensure moist fish while cooking), then I grilled the fish.  It had such a nice, subtle flavor with the taste of ginger, vinegar, et. al.

I loved the tangy/sweet sauce. I wasn't an overpowering flavor and a perfect sauce on veggies and rice too. I served fresh snapper (caught 6 hours prior! We're in Alaska...) with brown rice, green beans, and an asian inspired salad. It was a great healthy dinner.

this was tasty. i thought it was a good and healthy way to prepare snapper...it is versatile too...we had it with veggies, but it would be great with rice or noodles, even potatoes.  i served it with a spinache salad and grilled zucchini with roasted red peppers.  i drizzled the sauce over the grilled zucchini and peppers and it was awesome!

Fabulous!  I put the fish on a plate of hot soba noodles, then put 2 cloves of crushed garlic in the pan sauce and added about a 12 cup of water and 1-2tsp msg and some brocolli to it, cooking until crisp tender, then poured it all over the fish and noodles.  Voila!  Everyone loved it!

Didn't do anything for me.  It seems like it has potential, but really couldn't figure out where it was falling short.  Won't make it again.

The sauce had a decent flavor but this is not one of my favorite fish recipes.  Just dipping the fish in the sauce before cooking did not infuse the fish with the flavors and it did not produce a lot of sauce.  My boyfriend actually asked for additional condiments to put on the fish because of the bland flavor.

This recipe was okay - although the marinade was a bit too lemony and a bit too sweet all at the same time!  Next time I think I'll cut down on both the honey and the lemon.

Wasn't bad, but wasn't amazing for us either.  My husband, the fish eater of the family, said it was good, but that he would just as much prefer a slab of snapper cooked up with garlic and butter.  Probably cook it for company, but not just for us.

I added red pepper, chipotle and garlic seasoning, salt and pepper because we like spicy food.  I followed someone else's advice and sprayed the pan with Pam.  My husband loved it, and we will definitely have it again.

I doubled the recipe for a Costco-sized pack of snapper. I wish I'd had more time to let marinade the fish before cooking it, but we were in a hurry to get dinner on the table. The flavor was good, but very subtle.

Excellent!  I had read some of the review before.  I did not have rice vinegar so I used cider vinegar (which is an ok substitute) then  added a pinch or two of Cayenne pepper then a dash of salt and pepper. So I  let the fish sit in the marinade  on the counter for 15 minutes . Took the fish out and pan searer it in a teaspoon of olive oil for 2 or 3 minutes on each side. Then I added the rest of the marinade to the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on low.  Citrus flavor and DELICIOUS! . So easy to make

Very good recipe. The only and i say only because people are always saying i made a few changes, and to me they change the recipe. I added salt n pepper, as suggested by several people-that was the only change. It was a good call.

Something was a bit overpowering. I cut the ginger down to approximately 1/2 teaspoon. I think the lemon was a bit strong. Next time im gonna cut the lemon back by half.

I loved the flavors of the onion, honey, ginger and rice wine vinegar — a sweet and sour combination.  I did not have green onion nor Dijon mustard.  I substituted with yellow onion and brown coarse mustard.  I also doubled the ingredients for the sauce.  It still came out delicious.  This was a perfect recipe with rice.   My hubby loved it.  I will be using this recipe again.

I wanted a white fish prepared without heavy butter sauces. This red snapper recipe fit the bill! It was a snap to prepare and tasted oh so yummy. With a nice Sauvignon Blanc, salad and red potatoes, it was a lovely midweek dinner.

Good but next time will reduce the vinegar by half. 
I fried haddock in butter for a minute then added the sauce to the pan and basted the fish as it finished cooking. The sauce thickened up nicely.

A superb recipe for snapper!  I incorporated minor changes that others suggested and it was excellent:
*  Add salt & pepper to marinade
*  Marinate snapper for 20-30 min before cooking
*  After cooking, remove fish from pan, reduce marinade and pour over fish.
We loved it and will definitely make it again.

I bought fresh snapper today and decided to surf some new recipes to branch out a bit. I liked the sound of the ingredients and happened to have them all so tried this. The concept of pan seared is lost because of all the moisture of the marinade. Made for a completely different texture. It was pan poached not pan seared. The flavor wasn't bad but the texture was blah. Won't make it again.

For the fish puritans,  this recipe may not be your favorite "go to."   All the wonderful flavors of the ingredients mask the flavor of the fish.  But those of us who are looking to bring more wild wish into our daily diet will love it.  It offers a wonderful flavor--different from the typical lemon, garlic ,white wine base we see often.   The description on the cooking is spot on.  My only change would be a bit of salt and heat--a dash of cayenne or black ground pepper.

Exceptionally quick to make. Loved the taste. It tastes as if it's been made in a restaurant. I used English mustard instead of French. I also replaced the green onions with red onions as that is what was available to me. I think sprinkling the fish on both sides with a little salt and adding salt to the mixture really uplifts the taste. I didn't have wine vinegar, so instead I added the regular white vinegar with water(1:3 ratio). I marinated the fish in this mixture for 2-3 hours. And instead of using a skillet, I preheated my Airfryer for 5 mins on 200 degree Celsius. Then I cooked the fish and the mixture for 12 minutes on 200 degrees Celsius and turned the fish upside down once in between. This recipe is for keeps. Thank you!

Used maple syrup instead of honey, lime instead of lemon & dehydrated onion.  Used a cast iron skillet with small amount of coconut oil & it browned very nicely. Will make it again. Heated the marinate and used as an optional sauce.

I'm Vietnamese, and I cook Asian food for my family every day, so I tend to be quite critical of Asian recipes. However, being desperate for a "new" taste, I decided to go online. This recipe had really good flavor.. sweet and tangy, flavorful with the addition of garlic and ginger. However, I did a couple of things differently: First, I didn't have red snapper so I used fresh Tilapia, which was a nice sub. Then I asked the butcher to season my tilapia with "Mango lemon rub" (because it was free, and the flavor seemed like it would go with the recipe). I then pan fried the fish with oil til cooked and golden, then took it out and plate it. I then added the marinade from the recipe to the pan to cook and thicken, and then poured it on top of the fish. I surrounded the fish with Stir Fried Bok Choy with Ginger and Garlic ( recipe from Foodnetwork.com) and served with white rice. It was fresh and delicious. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was delicious, fast and easy!  I used perch since that was the fish I had on hand as well replacing the scallions with shallots.  Served it with a  fresh veggie and brown rice.  I doubled the marinade recipe and used some on the veggies and rice.   A definite recipe to make again and again!

There is nothing at all wrong with this recipe, only the choice of fish. Living in Scotland, Red Snapper is exotic, and my local fishmonger is well stocked of local fosh and exotics from around the world. I cooked the flesh side of the fish forst for the recommended time and flipped over to finish on the skin side. Immediately the skin srunk and the fish curled up making it very difficult to cook, i managed to lie it on its side since it looked more like a sheeps brain now. After considering it was ready i prepared the sauce and served. My wife was put off by the fact it looked like a sheeps brain.  On dissecting the fish we found it had a horribly rubbery texture with pinky white outer flesh and brown disgusting inner meat. However the sauce is delicious and will use it on Halibut next time. I work around the world and of all the fish i eat i find you cant beat North Sea Haddock, i have learned my lesson to stick to cold water species.

Trying out the paleo lifestyle and this was perfect for breakfast!  I didn't have any green onions, so I substituted red onion and it was still amazing!!!  I also used rice vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar (not sure if they're different) but the vinegar and the mustard was a great combination with the ginger.  I also cut up some tomatoes and threw them in the pan with some basil to add some extra veggies.  So good and can't wait to make this again!!!

I used the ingredients and added salt and pepper after reading other reviews. I also cooked a little different. Put O.O. in pan and seared fish skin side down. Then added sauce and finished in oven at 350 degrees for twenty minutes. Came out really nice will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good and tasty. It even pleased my husband who is not a big seafood lover nor sauce lover. I will make it again. I did not have ginger on hand and I substituted a white onion for the green. It was still very good.

I fried the fish in oil without the sauce for 3 minutes, flipped and fried for 1 minute, then added the sauce.  I let it cook until sauce reduced.  I added S & P, as someone suggested. Sorry,It didn't need the salt. Quick, easy, and tasty.

It was delicious, however they only had red snapper fillets without the skin so they sort of fell apart.  I also didn't understand if it called for rice wine (mirin) or rice vinegar, but I went with mirin and it tasted great.

I actually liked the marinade, but NOT for snapper. I'll go so far as to say I wouldn't make it again for any fish. I might try it with chicken one day.

Would not make this recipe again.  Maybe it was too much ginger for our taste.  Didn't like how the honey Caramelized the fish either.

Grocery shopping went a little late last night so I needed something quick and easy to make for dinner, and used this recipe because I had everything on hand. Everyone really liked it, but if I were to make it again I think I would add a bit less honey. I mixed the sauce (plus salt and pepper) and let the fish sit in it for about 15 minutes, then pan fried it without adding the marinade in the pan with the fish. When the fish was cooked, I added the remaining marinade into the pan to reduce and poured it on top of the fish. It would have also tasted great to add some white wine to the pan as well at this point, but I didn't have any on hand.

Good recipe,quick and easy with just a few ingredients needed. I didn't have green onion so I used onion. I was out of ground ginger too but it still turned out pretty good. As others suggested, i marinated the fish and reduced the sauce. This is something I will make again.

I really liked the marinade, but I think it overwhelmed the wonderful texture and flavor of the red snapper.  Also I thought it needed some salt.

The sauce was a little too acidic - would use 1 TBSP vinegar next time. Maybe this was why we couldn't taste the ginger.  This was our first time with red snapper, which we didn't care for.  I'll try again with a different fish and less vinegar.

This was quick & easy and very well received.  The only change we made, was to grill it. Hope they catch more snapper tomorrow!

It was edible, but I probably won't make it again.  It was very quick and easy to make, which I like, but the flavor of the sweet, tangy marinade didn't really compliment the flavor of the red snapper very well.

I don't know if it's just that I don't like this fish, but I really disliked this dish. I literally took one bite and stopped there. I'm typically a seafood LOVER, fish of all kinds.

Yikes ... that sauce was way to sour tasting, although increased the amount of honey. Nexttime, I am going to keep it simple and just pan sear in butter and add a few herbs ...

I did like some others had and let the fish sit in the sauce for a while. I felt that dijon would be too powerful for the fish so I used the mustard from Ikea which is sort of like dijon but not as strong. It worked wonderfully. I would also like to try this with lime juice instead of lemon.

I thought there was way too much acid in the sauce- too much lemon juice. I used ocean catfish instead of red snapper- similar in texture but maybe the oiliness of red snapper cuts some of the acididity? I would try this recipe again with less lemon juice and maybe some red pepper flakes for heat. Also the recipe as written is better described as "Poached" not "Pan Seared" due to the amount of liquid in the sauce.

Wow!! We all thought this was incredible.  The sauce is excellent.  I did add some salt and fresh ground pepper as suggested.  I'm from the beautiful Pacific NW and used to lots of fresh salmon and halibut but let me tell you what a treat to spend so little money for a fish dinner and one so good too.

I would suggest salt or salted butter to add more savoriness.  I accidently used too much ginger powder but it was still great!  Would definitely make this one again!!!

This tasted so good and was really easy to make! I know I've found a new favourite. I love fish and eat it often, and I'd have to say this is one of the best tasting fish I've ever had (rivaled only by the incredibly delicious monk fish I had at a little restaurant in Montmartre). I served it with steamed baby bok choy. Mmmm!

The sauce tasted great...to me...however...I did not like the sauce WITH the fish.  I used red snapper. My husband didn't even like the sauce (first time in 15 years) he dumped his plate of food in the trash.

This was great!  I love the ginger flavor, but beware if you aren't a fan of ginger.  I couldn't find any Red Snapper, even at Harry's Farmers Market, so I used Yellow Tail fillets instead and it came out wonderfully.  I doubled the sauce recipe because I'm a big fan of sauce and used 4 fillets.  I'll definately make this again!

Very good. I omitted the lemon, since I had none. It still had a wonderful flavor. My husband enjoyed it as well.

Tasted okay but not great.  My boyfriend really liked it though.  I didn't add the ground ginger but I didn't miss it.  Don't think it would have made that much of a difference.
