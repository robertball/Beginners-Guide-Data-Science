Very good and easy. Tasted just like mom used to make,so it was not only delicious but brought back some good memories. I used sugar-free pudding to cut down on some of the sugar but it was still great! Another one that's a definate keeper!

I just had this last night....and I must say it was tres delish!  I WILL say to use butter rather than margerine tho...and we skipped the chocolate and nuts.  French Vanilla pudding is yummier than plain too!  You can use sugar free and it's still awesome!  Altogether a very nice little dessert that's versatile and not too sweet.

I made this using sugar free pistachio pudding and sprinkled the top with pecans before serving. I loved the whole thing, but no one else in the house liked the cream puff crust and only ate the filling. Regardless of what the others thought, I'm still going to give this 5 stars.

I gave 4 stars because this recipe is good, but one on a different site is better. The difference is on the other they add 1/2 tsp of salt and 1 tbsp of sugar to crust. Makes the crust more airy which makes it a 5 star.  I was concerned about this ones crust when it came out so I ended up making both.

So good and yummy, everyone loved it.  Vanilla or Chocolate pudding is great.  The cook and serve pudding tastes a little better and fresh made whipped cream adds an added richness to it.  Very good recipe and easy to make.

Just made this today on my new gas range (wanted to try out the oven).  I've only got one thing to say...WOW!!! This recipe was not only easy but delicious.  I didn't use chocolate syrup simply because neither I or hubby like it.  Sliced some strawberries and put them on top.  I did have to increase the baking time for the cream puff to 35 mins. and  it turned out a beautiful golden brown.  It's a "keeper recipe" and I thank you for sharing it Zipity.

My mother used to make this exact recipe years ago.  Everywhere we went this cream puff "pie" came along as well. This recipe is easy to make lower in fat without having to put thought into it and it still tastes great.
I haven't met anyone who doesn't like this cream puff.  INCLUDING ME!!!!

I tried this last night, and it was easy and quick to make. I didn't have pudding in the house so I used a mousse mix that I had recently purchased. I only used one cup of milk for the mousse and made the puff layer in a smaller  8 X 8 square glass cake pan so the mousse would cover the pastry. I also whipped up fresh cream with some powdered sugar to bind it tighter and it worked perfectly. The whole dessert came out exactly as I had hoped and I am now trying to prevent my guy from eating the whole pan!

So much easier than making individual cream puffs. Good to take to a large gathering-hard to keep leftovers from getting soggy.

I love this recipe, but I like a little more pudding. I use two large boxes of pudding and 5 1/4 cups milk instead of the two small boxes and 3 1/2 cups of milk

I had a written version of this that I could hardly read ... was so glad to find it online.  IT IS AWESOME and 10 people finished it off last nite!!  Really does taste like a BIG cream puff which my kids remember from when they were young.

This recipe is awesome!!! I've made it several times with different flavors of puddings. Family favorite by far is using coconut pudding adding additional toasted coconut to pudding n then sprinkling some on the cool whip!!!! Yummy!!!!

I brought 2 pans to our church's Fish Fry and they disappeared in a flash - well except for a few pieces the dessert table ladies stashed in the back for themselves!  The recipe was super easy to make, and making a day ahead is such a relief for my busy schedule.  I omitted the almonds and made my own whipping cream - personal preference.

This was good.  I switched out the chocolate syrup for chocolate hot fudge, which I think was much yummier.  I would have used more actually, because there was so much cream to chocolate ratio.
