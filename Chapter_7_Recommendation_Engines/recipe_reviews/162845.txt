Great dish But I personally like to cook the tomato first and wait until they are tender and then add in the egg. This controls a few things, if it is too watery then I drain off some water because the eggs don't scramble and more become poached. and this way the egg gets the tomato flavor soaked into it more

Good, but not as good as my mom's...  A bit too watery and not as flavourful.  Gotta tweak it a bit before it can get 5 stars.  I made it without the pork -- just 5 tomatoes and 5 eggs.  Next time, will decrease the amount of salt, as eggs were way too salty!  May add some white pepper too.

Great recipe! I've also made this without the pork and soy sauce. It is a very healthy and filling meal over rice!

Great dish. Used steak instead of pork because that's what we had on hand. Turned out GREAT, but I simplified the cooking steps a bit by just leaving everything in the wok. Add oil or water if the egg starts burning on high heat.
