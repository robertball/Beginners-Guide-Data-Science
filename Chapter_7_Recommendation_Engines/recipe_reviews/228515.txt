This creme brulee was super fast and  easy and turned out to be so good, without double broiling or straining..!
It made 4 servings for me because I used the shallow, 3 oz, creme brulee ramekins and it took only 30 minutes for the creme to set. 
I added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to the 2 tablespoons of white sugar for better "bruling ".
Also, my torch was out of butane, so I broiled  the chilled creme, 6 inches away from the heat source, for 3 minutes  and then put back in the fridge for 15 minutes to harden the sugar crust.

So this recipe works quite well. I like the microwave solution for heating the cream. Be sure to use 35% whipping cream, and if you have vanilla bean at home, it adds a more interesting dimension as opposed to vanilla extract. Just shave some of the bean into the cream when heating it up.

Super  easy to make to lighten the caloric load (I know purists will be shocked) instead of heavy cream use condensed milk a great alternative.

The taste is exquisite. I followed the directions and subbed some homemade lavender extract for the vanilla extract. Perfect. Dressed it with a couple of raspberries and boom! Christmas eve dessert. Thanks.

Super easy! After reading several recipes I changed this one up a bit. I added a few dashes of Nutmeg and a shot of Butterscotch Schnapps.  Yum!

So simple and delicious! I didn't have to adjust for my older oven or higher elevation. Perfect recipe no matter what your cooking needs are. I even got this accomplished with my 2 year old helping. Great for little helpers to help prep.

I love it! Super simple and easy! I did a half batch which I quickly regretted after eating both servings. I used Ball jars instead of ramekins though. And after I ran out of ramekins I used a ceramic bowl which really didn't change anything. I also added blueberries into the cups before baking and that really added a special taste. One more thing is I don't have a microwave so I heated it up on the stove which didn't seem to make a difference.

I made it with sweetened condensed milk instead for cream and sugar. It turned out awesome though. 10/10 would recommend.

This is a great , easy recipe. I multiplied it by 6, as the family was coming. I only had 2 cups whipping cream, so I used 4 cups coffee cream. They came out perfectly and only took 40 minutes in a 6 ounce ramekin.  My son had 3, and my hubby keeps sneaking to the fridge. He knows how to use the torch now. I’m going to be asked to make this again.

I'm SO happy I found this recipe, it's AMAZING! It's extremely easy and delicious. The only thing I changed, I put a tad more vanilla to my liking and I added orange extract. I've made it two times already in the last three days. I need to buy more ramekins so I can make more at a time. ??

I followed the recipe except we didn't have a torch so we broiled these for 3 minutes.  So easy to make  and the texture of the custard is delicate and not eggy at all.  I will keep this as my creme brulee go to recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

Wow!  I thought creme brulee would be difficult to make!  Just follow the simple directions and get wonderful results.  I actually made the custard part 2 days before hand.  I don't have a torch, but I was able to do the sugar topping part under the broiler.  When I did this, I applied the sugar to the custards right after removing them from the fridge and immediately placed them under the broiler in a pan with water in it.  The custards were pleasantly warm when the sugar topping was done.

Simple and enjoyable. It does have a little too much "eggy" taste to it so I may reduce to 2 Egg Yolks instead of 3, but overall decent. Definitely room to play with.

Crème Brulee is one of my favorite deserts and it is SO simple to make and easy to make. I used all different sizes of glass Pyrex containers to make it, and it turned out great no matter the size I used. It was so good and perfect. We did the sugar on the top and used a torch to caramelize it then added blueberries, blackberries and raspberry's to it. so good.

This was a very easy recipe and it was delicious. The only change I would make is to cut back on the heavy cream and maybe use half whole milk. I personally don’t enjoy the high fat taste of heavy cream. I also cooked it in my instant pot for about 15 minutes so it was a quick recipe as well!

Mine had a taste that was a little off but I gave this one 5 stars anyway.  The reason is because I did not have a kitchen torch, although I have one now, and I used a propane torch.  The propane may have given me that off taste.  

This was the first time that I ever made Cream Brulee and I was surprised at how easy it was.  I will make this again and if I still get an off taste with my new butane torch I will let you know.

Very good. This is the first time I made this so I followed the directions as written. Next time, I’ll try some different things like chocolate, liquor and maybe fruits.

these turned out great. I didn't have a blow torch, but they were still delicious. Odd enough, all of my boys loved it, that never happens.

I made 4 batches at once and heated the sugar and cream low over a stovetop. I let it cool before adding the egg yolk so as not to end up with bits of cooked egg in the custard. Turned out pretty good!

we made this but weren't  able to use a torch for the top. instead we decided to use a broiler and it wasnt too bad but it cooked unevenly so if possible a torch would be much better for control.  over all very good and tasty.

I made it just as the recipe says.  It was done in 45 minutes and was perfect!  I made 10 servings for a dinner group and everyone liked it.  I put fresh raspberries on top.  Using this method, I think it would be very difficult to ruin it.  I will definitely make it again.

Super easy, just skim any froth you might get from whisking the cream off before poring into your ramekins. Mine were set in 30 minutes at 350 degrees oven temp. I did use fresh Madagascar vanilla bean instead of the extract. I let the kids torch their own, so of course it's a favorite at my house.

So easy and so good.   Will definitely make this again!  Will try to add some different flavors, i.e white chocolate, etc. The easiest dessert I've ever made.

I loved how super easy this was! I did use a fresh vanilla bean and added it to the heavy cream mixture when it was heated in the microwave. This was so delicious, my hubby even loved it.

Worked great. I loved the microwave to heat cream up. I didn't have correct dishes so I used 1/2 quart mason jars. Worked amazing.
