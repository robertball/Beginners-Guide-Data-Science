I've made this recipe on numerous occasions with a couple of minor differences.  I change out the milk & sugar and replace them with a can of sweetened condensed milk.  It is fantastic! I usually use a pre-made graham cracker crust instead of wafers. I've also made this with black cherry Kool-Aid & stirred in dark chocolate chips. It tastes just like a chocolate covered cherry. Yum!

I initially got a similar recipe off of a forum, like the other reviewer I too change out the milk & sugar and replace them with a can of sweetened condensed milk and use a pre-made graham cracker crust instead of wafers. I usually use the lemon or lemonade flavor kool-aid or the cherry. The lemon ones taste like a lemon cheesecake. I have taken this to a few potluck type parties and people always want the recipe or state that they "love the cheesecake!" many are shocked at how easy this is to make.

I find it much easier to use a can of sweetened condensed milk.

I seem to have been the only person who made this actual recipe. It works just fine. I'm not sure how it's "easier" to use sweetened condensed milk since that won't actually whip - those people must've folded it into the cool whip to achieve enough filling for 1 whole pie. As written this recipe tastes great but be advised that it makes almost too much filling for 1 pie (my pie lid was sitting squarely on the filling, which wasn't so pretty when serving) so definitely save your cool whip garnish for serving time, do not spread it across the pie or mix it into the filling before filling the pie tin up. In closing, it came out great, it was quite simple to do, and you need to serve it directly from the freezer because as evaporated milk thaws it becomes milk again. Tasty Kool-Aid milk, but milk nonetheless. Thanks for sharing, I liked having a use for all that evaporated milk I wind up with on sale!

This recipe was given to me by my relatives and it's SO simple. I too used just a can of EAGLE brand condensed milk, but I also add crushed pineapple(you have to squeeze the excess juice out of it or the pie will b runny). I also added a lot more whipped cream cuz it cuts that super dense sweetness out of the pie-which can tend to b TOO rich. YUM. EASY. SIMPLE. My kind of recipe.

I really hate to be negative, but this recipe was barely edible.  The kool aid flavor was overwhelming and way too tart.  I ended up having to throw it away, I'm giving it two stars because it was very easy to assemble.
