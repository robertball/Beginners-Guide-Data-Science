These bars are delicious!  I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips on the top layer.  I couldn't find the double chocolate chunk cookie mix, so I used the regular chocolate chip cookie mix, and added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips into the cookie dough and mixed thoroughly.  I didn't add the espresso powder because I had none.  Finally, I cut it into small squares, and placed each piece into a small paper candy/mini-muffin cups, like truffles.  They are so rich, that the small size is sufficient.

These were very good. very rich and sweet a little piece is all you need. Loved the cream cheese filling and will use in in another recipe.
