This recipe was very good but I made changes to the sauce.  I followed sauce ingred. but added 2 TBSP. mustard and 2TBSP. vinegar to sauce ingred.  It cut the sweetness and was awesome!!!

This was a very good and simple recipe. My husband loved it. Although he thought the glaze was a bit too sweet. I thought that it called for a little bit more milk than needed. It came out a little soggy in the 4 serving recipe, so next time I'll use less milk. But all in all it was a great success!

Yum. This was easy and  very tasty. My family raved about the flavor and wanted to know what I did different. They usually don't like me to try different recipes when the old one is fine but this just became my new meatloaf recipe.

This was a delicious change of pace from my usual tomato sauce meatloaf. Following others' suggestions, I reduced the amount of brown sugar in the glaze , but followed the recipe otherwise and it turned out very well.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I doubled it (wanted leftovers for sandwiches) and shaped it into 3 loaves.  I will use a little less brown sugar the next time.

This recipe was extremely MOIST and scrumptious!!  I decided to make this meatloaf into one loaf and enhanced the recipe 4 times so that I would have a huge loaf.  As a result the baking time was not 55 minutes but 1 hour and 45 minutes.  The end result was a delicious meatloaf which lasted 5 days.  Each day tasted as good as the first day. The topping was a bit sweet the first time but enhaced each day afterwards. EXCELLENT recipe. Will definitely create again and again.

I tried this tonight. I never make my meat loaf the same. But this recipe is a keeper to make again. I did tweak it a little bit trying to improvise with what I did have. I used turkey meat instead of ground beef. ( I do have to say it was not a joy mixing the ground turkey meat with everything else by hand being 6 weeks pregnant ...lol) I used tyme instead of sage. I used green onions. It came out awesome! My husband and I loved it. Thank you! = )

With my adjustments, this recipe was AMAZING!! My husband has seconds and raved about it. Instead of beef I used ground lamb. I swear it adds another dimension to boring old meatloaf! Instead of saltine crackers I crushed one spelt cracker that had pumkin and poppy seeds on it and one flaxseed cracker. What a way to add fiber to the meatloaf! I used chicken broth instead of milk, and omitted the sugar from the topping. TO DIE FOR!

This recipe was enough for my two boys and I. Because I'm watching my carb intake, I subtracted half of the crushed crackers and added Kraft parmesan cheese in it's place. I did not add the extra salt. I formed them into little meatloaf muffins and only spooned the "sauce" over the kids' muffins, only because I can't have sugar/ketchup (again, eating low carb). I got four meat muffins They loved theirs with the sauce, I had mine with mustard. No leftovers--only thing I'd do different next time is add some spices, maybe some minced garlic. Great recipe for me that fed three perfectly.

Nice and easy recipe. My family loved it. Personally I felt the sauce too sweet for my taste buds.

This was so easy and tasted great.  My husband loved the sauce.  I actually doubled the recipe and made 4 small loaves. I liked that it only called for 1/2 pound of hamburger.  Most meat loaf recipes call for at least 2 pounds.  This is a good size for my family. Thanks for sharing!

GRRREEEAAATTTTT!!! I used ground turkey and added Italian bread crumbs which helped flavor the ground turkey but what made this dish was the sauce that caramelized. It was Delicious!

This meatloaf was excellent.  I used Italian breadcrumbs in place of the saltines, but everything else I kept as is.  My husband despises green peppers, so finding a really delicious recipe for meat loaf without the peppers is always welcome!  Thanks for the excellent recipe.  It was delicious.

This was really good.  I really like the tip another reviewer left about putting bread slices at the bottom of the pan to absorb the grease.  The bread really does make a huge difference.  I put bacon slices on top of the meat loaf and a glaze.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Thanks so much...

Even the kids loved this recipe, thanks for sharing it!  The sauce was great, but I think I'll double the spices the next time I make this... my husband thought it could use a little extra "kick".

A great recipe for meatloaf and the sauce was outstanding.  I sub'd breadcrumbs for crackers.  I will add a touch more salt next time I do this substitute.

While I liked the concept and moistness of the mini meatloaf,I found them to be bland.  I will use the recipe again, but will add some parmesan cheese and a little spicey barbecue sauce and maybe a bite of garlic.

I am not a great lover of meatloaf,  but this was quite tasty.  I doubled the recipe and added  1 tbls mustard and 1 tbls vinigar after reading some reviews about it being a bit to sweet.  Will make it again.

Very yummy and moist.  While the sauce was very flavorful, I did find the meat to be quite bland and will make sure to double the spices and add more salt next time I make it.

This was the best meat loaf I've EVER made! It was super moist and full of flavor! The only substitution I did was use Italian breadcrumbs for the saltine crackers (didn't have crackers in the house). I'm so glad I doubled the recipe because my husband went back for seconds! I think this recipe should be called," NOT Your Mom's Meat Loaf!"

The recipe only asks for 1/2 lb. of beef so the loaves are really small.  I wanted to use a whole pound so I doubled the batch and cooked it a little longer.  I covered it with foil for half the baking time.

I made this and my fiance really liked it. I would use fewer crackers if I made it again. I also added about a tablespoon more of worchestershire sauce to the sauce.

This was the best meat loaf I have ever made. Thank you for the recipe. I always cook the recipe just as it is written the first time to see how it is supposed to come out. This time there is nothing I would change. Your a very good cook!

I love this recipe.  I make it pretty much as written except I double it or sometimes quadruple it for 1 or 2.5 pounds of burger.  Some reviewers described the mix as too mushy -- but I find the meatloaf moist when it's done.  I do like the glaze a little bolder so I add worcestershire sauce, some white vinegar and a little yellow mustard.  Great recipe - this is BETTER than my mom's meat loaf.

I used bread crumbs instead of crackers and made one loaf instead of two then baked for one hour and ten min.  Other than that, I stayed with the recipe. If I make this one again I would definately cut back on the brown sugar.  We liked it but both of us thougth it was too sweet.

This is third meatloaf recipe that I have tried and it is the only one that stays together!  The husband really enjoyed it and so did I.  I added a clove of garlic and used italian seasoning instead of the sage.  I doubled the recipe, but used a little less than 1/3 cup milk.  I used 1 Tbsp brown sugar in the sauce and it was plenty sweet for us.  This is going to be my only meatloaf recipe now.  Yum!

This is absolutely delicious!  I also doubled the amounts so as to have leftovers but there wasnt much left!  Many sounds of delight came from my husband and kids whilst eating this meatloaf.  For Aussie cooks - I used Jatz original crackers. Other than that, I didnt change a thing. Thank you for such a great recipe.

I really liked this recipe!!  Although I did make my own adjustments.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and Italian Breadcrumbs instead of saltines b/c I didn't have them on hand.  For the glaze, I used Heinz Chili Sauce for the base, 1/2 tbs. of brown sugar, a squirt of ketsup and a squirt of HP Brown Sauce.  YUMMMY!!!  My one year old couldn't get enough and my husband who dislikes meatloaf truly enjoyed this recipe.  Super quick and easy!

If you are looking for a solid everyday meatloaf with a nice flavor this recipe fits the bill.  Recipe has ingredients that are generally always on hand which is a plus in my house.  Meatloaf is one of my hubby's favorite meals and for someone who generally likes everything I cook he can be rather picky about his meatloaf.  We both enjoyed this recipe which has flavor and doesn't crumble when sliced.  I added green pepper for our taste and as we prefer a little dryer loaf I used 1/2 cup of saltines and served small individual loaves.  Loved the sweet topping.  The sauce added enough of a zip that no one requested ketchup on the side.  Thanks for the post.

Made recipe exactly as written, just doubled it to make more. Very good and moist. And I love that I get to use up the saltines sitting in my pantry.

I made quite a few tweaks to the recipe based on mine and my husbands taste. I went ahead and used a full pound of hamburger meat, lean. I also upped the onions to about 1/3cu and added fresh minced garlic. Instead of saltines I used French's French onion strings and some plain bread crumbs. Because I used a full pound of beef I also doubled the eggs and milk accordingly. I used the same quantities for the topping and it was more than enough. I used 2 tsp. rather than 2 tbls. of brown sugar and a full tsp. of whorstishire sauce and it was still too sweet. Next time I'll either leave reduce it to 1/2 tsp. or omit it all together. 

In conclusion, as far as meatloaf recipes go this one was very good with a few adjustments and made a quick and hearty weekday meal.

I love this recipe.  It's so easy to substitute different things and change the flavors, but it's absolutely delicious as-is.  I like to add mustard, vinegar, and extra Worcestershire sauce to the glaze, and use half spicy sausage and ground turkey.  Bread crumbs work just as well as the crackers, too. This is definitely one recipe I will be adding to the dinner rotation!  Thanks for sharing.

Everyone loved it. There was a lot of flavor in it. I used tarragon instead of sage(oops didn't have any) and it was wonderful. Also, made with 2lbs of gr.bf and tripled other ingredients. Though tasters said it was great, I think I would use less bread crumbs to have the texture not so soft. Boyfriend and best friend loved it and wanted take-home bags :)

Amazing!!!!!  My family loved it!!!!! My son told me to make more next time.  I guess he didn't have enough!!!  My husband couldn't stop eating.  I forgot to add the milk, but still came out great.  I'll add the milk next time to see if it really makes a difference. :)

I was looking for good comfort food, and this hit the spot! I made this for both my mother and mother-in-law (to be at the time) and it was a hit on both occasions!  The fresh sage and thyme really make a difference, so going fresh is worth it.  I'll be sure to try it again!

Very pleased with this. I doubled the recipe to make 4 little loaves - but did not double the amount of brown sugar in the glaze, and it was yummy. Easy enough to make during the week after work. It's now my go to recipe for meatloaf.

I love, love, love this meatloaf! My mom's meatloaf always had ketchup on top so I'm used to that, but the sweetness of the glaze adds something more. the hubby loves it too... and he can as picky as a 4 year old some times! Def tweak it to you liking. I take all the recipes I find and add the seasonings that I like. Oh and my mom taught me to throw chopped onions in when browning ground beef for pretty much any recipe. It adds so much flavor!

I have looked for meat loaf recipe that really has that WOW factor, and I found it with this one. I picked this recipe to try because all of my hamburger is in 1 lb packages, so I just doubled this one. The only change that I made was to follow another reviewers tip about using stove top stuffing in place of the crackers. I used "Savory Herbs". I usually don't care for sweet on meat, and I almost cut out the brown sugar in the topping. Really glad that I didn't. The sweet and the stuffing flavor did more than compliment each other.  We had unexpected company that had supper with us, and WOW was the vote, best anyone had.  Wife said that I can make this twice a week.

Delicious! I doubled recipe and added 1 small stalk of celery (minced), which I sauteed with the onions in 1 tsp of olive oil. I also cut the milk in half, used Italian breadcrumbs instead of crackers, and omitted the brown sugar. I shaped it into one large loaf and baked it at 350 for 1 hour. It was fantastic!

There was something missing in the meatloaf itself from the recipe I have made for years. It may be because the ketchup/brown sugar was on top instead of in the loaf.

Excellent!! Family RAVED. I doubled the recipe, skipped the worshester sauce, and used EnerG brand Gluten-Free / Casein-Free crackers. For the onion chose a sweet yellow variety. A keeper recipe!!!

This was my first meat loaf ever and it was a hit! My grandparents loved it!  I tried to stay very close to the recipe, however, I did make one significant change. I added Stove Top Stuffing to the mixture instead of the crushed crackers. The result was amazing. Not only did it add extra flavor to the dish but it also held the mixture together very tightly. Thanks Mom!

This is the best meatloaf recipe I've tried.  Flavorful and moist.  Like others, I decreased the brown sugar by half, and added extra Worcestershire sauce and about 2 tbs prepared yellow mustard to the sauce.

I have been making this recipe since I first discovered this website a few years ago and I just had to share with all of you how much my family loves it.  It's simple, tasty, and unique.  If that makes any sense.  I love the sage idea, thanks for sharing.  Sometimes I add a little rosemary in with my ketchup topping.

This recipe is very tasty and now a staple in our home.  I always double it to provide leftovers and follow the doubled recipe exactly except I cut back on the brown sugar to 3 tbsp and add 1 tbsp of fresh horseradish.  It gives it that sweet tangy taste we love!!

This was absolutely delicious. Perfect portion size for one adult. I substituted Ritz crackers for saltines and the white of the green onion for "onions". Best meatloaf I have ever tasted!

made this recipe last night for my boyfriend, mother and grandparents. everyone loved it. my only complaint was not chopping the onions small enough. being someone who doesn't like to know the onions are there, some pieces were a little too large (but again, this was my own fault). also, was a little watery. when making it for more than 2 people (like in my case) i placed all the meat in one loaf pan, and had to cook longer. all in all, it turned out well :)

4 1/2 stars.  as other review's said... good, basic recipe.  i doubled it and made it into 1 single loaf.  i i also threw in some other finely chopped veggies (besides the onion) -- red pepper, mushrooms & spinach.  turned out very tasty & moist.  omitted the sage; salt & pepper was enough seasoning for me.

This is a great basic meatloaf recipe! I like the idea of the mini loaves it helps with portion control. I didn't have sage and substituted thyme, it worked great. The sauce was very sweet (I reduced the brown sugar slightly) and it makes a huge batch. My husband likes it layered on. The mini loaves meant I could slather his and just lightly cover mine. If you don't already have a basic recipe in the family ~ this is a definite keeper!

I don't think sugar is needed in a meatloaf. There is a lot of sugar in ketchup and than the brown sugar.
I would also use quick oats instead of crackers (trans fats).

I didn't have the exact ingredients, but it worked wonderfully with turkey meat, marjoram instead of sage, and a bit of canola oil.  Great recipe!

I made mom's meat loaf last week and my husband loved it.  My husband is very picky when it comes to food  he hardly says; that was great or so good.  I have made a couple of different loaf's and he said it's ok.  When I made this one he said this is so good.  He asked me the next week to make it again.   I like it because I can make it easily according to our taste.

I love this recipe. I replaced saltine crackers with quick cooking oats, and put the worcestershire in the meatloaf, not the sauce. To the sauce I added nutmeg, and served it on the side. Just wonderful !

Oh my, was this good!!!!!!!  The only thing different I did was I didn't add any sage because I didn't have any and I used stuffing mix instead of crackers because that is what I had.  I think it would have been just as delicious made the way the recipe is stated but it was very good with the substitutions as well.  This will definitely be a regular for my family and thanks to AllRecipes serving calculator it was easy to know how to increase to serve a family instead of 2.  Thanks Michelle.

This was a great find! I made as directed with the exception of using bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers because that is what I had on hand. The meat loaf was moist and the sauce was delicious. I will definitely be making this again!

This is a tasty meat loaf. My husband and i love this recipe. Perfect American classic meat loaf. I used bread crumbs in place of saltine crackers because that is just what i keep in the house. Very easy to make and makes for a hearty meal.

With a house full of starving teens I increased this recipe to feed 12 & printed.  In the ensuing chaos I got distracted & accidentally doubled the liquids requiring me to double everything else again.  Thankfully it was an enormous hit because there was an enormous amount of food!!  Kids loved it, husband loved it (a BIG deal because he claims to ABHOR meatloaf!!), and most of the extra went with a friend to the firehouse where they all loved it too.  Being garlic lovers, I added a couple cloves, but it was really the sauce that added the WOW-factor.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!  This is now one of our favorite meals!!

This was okay, I'm not a huge onion fan so I would leave those out next time and the topping was a little too sweet I'd stick with just ketchup for me but otherwise it was good.

Amazing...our very picky kids even enjoyed it :) I tripled the recipe so we would have left overs and just cut back a bit on the brown sugar and it was perfect! Will make this again for sure :)

I love meat loaf but have been afraid to make it because I know it'd be way too much for just me and my husband.  This was great!  Like others, I made some adjustments.  I didn't have saltines so I threw some fire roasted tomato triscuits in my food processor instead, added some extra spices and cut some sugar from the topping.  I think in the future I would at least halve the ketchup sauce- it was too much for both of us.  Great serving size for just two people!!

This was great.  Only thing I changed was to use Stove Top Turkey Stuffing left over from Turkey Day for the breading.  Came out really moist and I'll probably never make it any other way from now on.

I doubled the recipe and omitted the onions and my husband ate 3 of them!  Said it was the best meat loaf he's ever tasted and the greatest thing I've ever cooked!  But cut the glaze part in half because it makes too much!

This was very tastey ~ the sauce makes it. I made one small change, I omitted the sage. My family loved it! They all had seconds, and my youngest daughter came home from school today and ate the last left over peice.

I really enjoyed this because it was easy and tasty. We just made a couple changes: we added extra onion, garlic, and worcestershire  to the meat, and used less sugar and more worcestershire in the sauce.

I've made this twice now and it's great!  I didn't use crackers either time, I used seasoned bread crumbs and the 2nd time I made it I was out of sage and used Italian seasonings...really excellent!  I do make a little more sauce than the recipes calls for because it's so good!  Definitely a keeper!

FANTASTIC!! It was wonderful. It's my first time making a successful meatloaf. I also however doubled the recipe for a pound of hamburger. I did listen to the other suggestions about the sauce. So I made it like it says and then just added in a few tablespoons of mustard, and it tamed the sweetness. I also added a tablespoon and a half of Worcestershire sauce to the meat. I also added a half package of bacon(ground in the food processor)to the meat and then formed 6 large meatballs out of the meat instead of making it into a loaf. Which helps with getting enough sauce in the end. Overall I loved this recipe and will definately make this again. Thank you!!

Really good and really easy.  I made a double portion and just left it in the oven an extra 10 minutes.  I find that one portion is not enough for two people.

I really liked this recipe. It was easy to make, and I had most of the ingredients on hand allready. I didnt have sage and so I used dried oregano instead. I also added some taco seasoning. I dont have worshire sauce, so I used A1 steak sauce.The sauce ended up tasting really good. And my whole family liked it.

It was OK. The zip came from the ketchup/brown sugar/worcesteshire sauce topping.  I think that meats require flavor these days and the worcesteshire sauce is best used in mixing meat.

This meatloaf was good. I'm not real fond of meatloaf but the sauce on the top made it good. I didn't put sauce on half of it because my husband prefers no sweet sauce and I found his side of the meatloaf didn't have alot of flavor. There were no leftovers though.

This meatloaf was very moist. I have never used crackers before in a meatloaf, only breadcrumbs. I personally would cut back a little more on the sage, but over all it was very good!  Will make again! I also doubled the recipe and made one loaf instead of two.

Good basic recipe that I altered the heck out of.  Substituted 1/2 cup of oats for the crackers, added green pepper to my onions, used turkey instead of beef.  Added an italian seasoning blend instead of just sage. Added a little vinegar to the sauce to cut the sweetness.

Great recipe.  My 6 yr old LOVED it.  I actually thought the sauce was excellent based on what the other reviews said.  I thought the sweetness gave the meatloaf great flavor.  I doubled the meat and made 3 small loaves but only added a little more of each ingredient instead of doubling each one. I prefer this over my boring meatloaf even though my husband disagreed.

Overall pretty good.  Hubby gave it 3 stars.  Probably needs just a little less milk and a little less brown sugar but a different change from our usual meatloaf recipe.

This one is perfect if you don't want to run out and get that odd-ball ingredient.  I already had all of these ingredients in my kitchen.

Always double this recipe when I make it except for the sage. My husband is not a fan of meatloaf except for this one. Simple and easy and always have the ingredients on hand.

This is my go-to meatloaf recipe, even my picky 11 year old likes it (minus the sauce).  I like making this in a cupcake pan, it cooks quicker, makes really good serving size loafs, and I can easily leave the sauce off of some of them.  I just cook any meatloaf remaining in an 8x8 pan.  The only thing I do differently is add more worchestershire sauce.

I have made this meatloaf so many times over the past few years that my family thinks I am the MOM in Mom's Meatloaf!  My husband and sons request it frequently.  It's for sure a family favorite.  I double/triple/quadruple the recipe and it is always gobbled down within 24 hours by my hearty eaters.  One change that I make is that I put in more ground beef than it calls for.  I probably double the amount.   I made it once for my own mom when she and my father were recovering from a surgery.  She changed her own meatloaf recipe that she used for over 50 years to this one.  It is absolutely delicious.  Thank you so much for sharing.

This is the meat loaf of my childhood, similar to if not identical to that which was in "Better Homes and Gardens" which my mother received as a wedding gift in 1948 and uses to this day.  This recipe is delicious as written; it is simple enough that I learned to prepare it as a 7 year old.  It brings back memories of a time of my life which at the time seemed idyllic.

This was a tasty recipe, though I will cut the milk in half next time because it came out too runny. I took another reviewer's advice and added mustard and a bit of vinegar to the glaze because it seemed too sweet. Otherwise, very simple and good. Went over well with the family.

I made this for my boyfriend and it was my first time ever making meatloaf. He absolutely loves the meatloaf that his friends' mother makes and I didn't think there was any way i could compete with it. I served the recipe with mashed potatoes and asparagus....He LOVED the meatloaf!! I also really liked it. It was ever great to heat up the next day and eat for lunch. VERY EASY to make!! I will definitely be making this again.

My husband and I came into our marriage about three years ago with two different meatloaf recipes.  Neither of us was fond of the other's recipe.  This recipe has very much pleased both of us!  We have also used it when having family for dinner.  They also loved how the meatloaf turned.  It is easy to make and uses on hand ingredients.

This is very good meatloaf.  I didn't have milk, so I used 1/4 c chicken broth. I took a reviewer advice and added 1T vinegar to the sauce.  I'm looking forward to finishing the loaf tomorrow with meatloaf sandwiches.  Will definitely make more often.

I loved this recipe. I wasn't to sure about it because I do not like ketchup but this was by far a keeper. I did add less brown sugar and a few more squirts of worshire sauce. Only reason is because I don't like sweet food. Other then that everyone loved it, including my son who is extremely picky. My son said its his new favorite.

Very delicious! I have made this twice and both times, it turned out great. The sauce is simple and good. I did not have sage, so I'm sure if I added that it would have been even better.

We love this meatloaf and so do our friends.  I've shared this recipe with them.  The only change I make is to add some chopped celery.

In general I am not a huge meatloaf fan, but my husband raves about this recipe.  I like it too, although not as much as he does.  I gave it a 5 because he insists it is the best meatloaf ever.

This is the one and only meatloaf recipe I have ever tried to make. I have eaten meatloaf before and honestly have never been a big fan, until now. My kids and husband love this too-they are always asking when I'm going to make it again. Thank you!!!
 I always double the sauce on top because it's just so yummy!

Followed the recipe for 4 servings and found the mixture to be a little wet, so I added an additional 1/2 lb of ground beef.  The results were tasty, though I wound up draining top sauce after 40 minutes and putting back in oven for another 10 minutes to get internal temperature to 160.  Boyfriend loved it and had 3 servings!  I wasn't that impressed but am looking to try it next time with ground turkey.  For added punch, substitute 1/4 of the ketchup quantity with sriracha sauce~  hello!

I discovered this recipe 3 weeks ago and have used it twice already!  My husband loves it.  I use butter crackers instead of the saltines.  I put the onion in my food processor so it is very finely chopped.  I also use a pound of beef to make enough for the whole family.  This will be a regular meal in our house!

The hubby loves it.  I add a little mustard to the sauce, but otherwise keep the recipe the same.  We always double it so there are leftovers for lunch!

wonderful!  My husband was slapping hands when others tried to eat "His" meatloaf!  He wanted leftovers for sandwiches for 4 days-that is a huge compliment-he hates eating the same thing over and over-until now!  I did add extra worcestershire to the glaze and the meat mix and used italian breadcrumbs as well -fantastic & perfect for sandwiches later-many thanks!

This meatloaf was delicious!  My roommate, who is just learning to cook, and I followed the recipe with the exception of using ground turkey instead of ground beef and it turned out wonderful.  We're definitely going to make this again.

Made this with ground turkey and it was delicious.  The sauce was a bit too sweet for our taste, so I will cut back on the brown sugar next time.

I did not care for this at all, but I think it is a case of personal preference.  The sauce was WAY too sweet for me (and I even cut down on the sugar) and the meat was flavorless.  I think I prefer a more tangy meatloaf.

Well, not sure how to rate this recipe.  I scaled it for 2 lbs. of ground beef and it never quite came together.  It had the potential for good flavor, but was more of meat mush.  I won't make it again unless I follow the recicpe exactly, which probably won't happen because I never cook for just 2!

It was good.  A bit surprising when you taste the sweetness with the meat loaf.  i would make it again.
