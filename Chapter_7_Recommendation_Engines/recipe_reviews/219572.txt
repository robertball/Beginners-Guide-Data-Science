Yummy, absolutely delicious! I adapted this for the microwave for 20 min cooking! Just throw everything but the cheese & tortillas into a microwaveable casserole dish w/ lid. Micro for 12 min. Stir in Cheese & top with Tortillas! EASY!

Thsi was good, but need something more to me. Maybe if you served it over rice or wrapped it in a tortilla. I did add some jalepneos for some heat. My BF liked it but I don't think it is something I would make again.

This was so easy and yummy. I didn't have salsa on hand, so I used half a can of diced tomatoes and added a small can of green chiles. I also sauteed some onions with the chicken.
