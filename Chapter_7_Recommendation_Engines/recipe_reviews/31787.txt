We really enjoyed this! Traditional meatloaf is always a favorite, but this was fun to make and tasty for something a little different...pretty too! Other than adding garlic to the mushrooms and onions (I HAVE to!) I made this as written and was very pleased. Another great comfort food recipe!

I used fresh baby spinach. Added more onions. My guess the previous reviewers meatloaf fell apart, is that the instructions need to say that you should let the meatloaf rest about 10 minutes before slicing. Also I baked it on a baking sheet. In a loaf pan I think the meat just sits in the fat while cooking. A definate keeper. Thanks Karen.

Pretty good base recipe. I tweaked it a bit...took out the mushrooms and rolled with ham and cheese as well as the spinach mixture.

This was really good!  I added some garlic (of course!) and extra Worcestershire sauce to the meat,  as well as some Parmesan cheese.  On top I made a mixture of 1/4 C. Worcestershire sauce, 1/8 C. Honey,  and 2 Tbsp prepared mustard. I put half on top to cook,  which kept everything moist,  and served the other half with dinner in case people wanted extra... which they did.  YAY!  Another dinner success. :)  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a yummy way to incorporate spinach into a meat loaf, just what I was looking for.  I also added garlic and more worchestershire sauce. I only used ground beef because that was all I had on hand.  I also used fresh spinach. But to my dismay the cute pinwheel roll I put into the oven crumpled.  It was a terrible sight on my serving platter.  Just a big mess.  Luckly it was just served to my family.  The flavor was great I will try this recipie again, but next time I think I will just mix everything into one loaf, no fancy stuff.  Maybe run the cheddar cheese through the center.

This was a good tasting recipe, but needed garlic in my opinion, but I'm a garlic lover. Cut the spinach up really small or it makes the loaf hard to cut. Cover the loaf for the first 45 minutes, or it will dry and be hard on the outside. Better with some gravy too.

Pinwheel Meatloaf Haiku: "Pinwheel rolled in yum! A fun way to make meatloaf! Looks pretty, tastes great!" This was the 4th time that I've made this recipe and each time, it gets better and better. I liked it a lot the 1st time when I followed the recipe exactly, and just as much w/ my small changes. I use fresh spinach, as well as sauteeing bell pepper and garlic along w/ the onion. I also haven't seen the need for egg and bread crumbs in the spinach mixture, so I skip that all-together. We've decided that we prefer the cheese sprinkled on top of the spinach mixture, rather than blended into the meats, for gooey, melty goodness. I've had the meatloaf "split" while baking and haven't determined how to avoid that (maybe I'm stuffing it w/ too much spinach and mushroom?) Regardless of how it ends up looking, it always disappears from the dinner table fast.

This recipie was fantastic.  A friend had picked this recipie for our weekend horse get away.  She put baby carrots on the botton so the meat roll could sit on them and red potatoes along side.  Very easy to make and full of flavor that will be a crowd pleaser.  We will make this again for ourselves and company.

Very good!  I used two small cans of mushrooms and dried minced onion.  I also made this the night before and just put it in the baking dish and covered it with foil in the fridge overnight and just popped it in the oven and baked about 10 - 15 minutes extra.

My meatloaf came halfway unrolled in the oven, so it wasn't a pretty pinwheel. It tasted great though! The spinach is delicious in this recipe.

I broke from the recipe and used baby Portabello mushrooms and shallots instead of the onions for the filling with the spinach.  I really liked the flavor, but I think it would be better mixing half shallots with half white onions for the filling.  I also added garlic while browning the meat.  My girlfriend said it was the best, better then the first time I made it following the recipe.  I really like making thins dish. It is easy to do.  I used wax paper to spread and roll the meat log.  It makes it really easy to add it to the baking dish.  I didn't have a bread pan available so I used a pyrex dish.  I think this allows the grease to flow out.  It's on the money.

This is such a good recipe - truly gourmet meatloaf! Unfortunately, my husband doesn't like it, so I only prepare it occasionally. My only change is to bake it in a pyrex dish, not the loaf pan. It takes too long to cook in the loaf pan.

Pretty good!  Go easy on the nutmeg.  A very little goes a looooong way!  Next time I'll add cheese to the filling also.

I tried this recipe last night. It was great. I used sage as I didn't have parsley but it added a really nice flavour. For the pork, I just used the filling from a pack of pork sausages. I didn't attempt to roll it as I was in a hurry but I layered the meat and filling and it worked very well. Was delicious and I will definitely use it again. Can't wait to have the leftovers for dinner tonight.

Very good!  I did add extra mushrooms and spinach (also threw in some garlic), but everything turned out great.  The filling is fantastic.  I can't say that enough.  The filling is going to be used with other recipes.  I honestly considered just eating the filling.  The meatloaf turned out better than any homemade meatloaf I've ever had.  The only modifications I made were the extra mushrooms and onions, garlic, and I used parmesan bread crumbs.

I made this the other night for my "chef" boyfriend. He loved it and so did I! It looked so good that I had to post a pic of it on Facebook. I will definitely make it again. We are thinking of trying the filling in wontons.

This recipe is awesome.  My husband loved it!  I only changed 1 ingredient - I used Monteray-Jack cheese instead of Cheddar.  This woud be delicious with Swiss Cheese also.

Very good, and what a nice way to dress up meat loaf.  I used fresh spinach, just sauted with the onions and butter until it wilted.

The only meatloaf that I have ever liked! It really is delicious as written, but, of course, I made a change. I added a little glaze on top for the last 10 minutes of cooking. Little ketcup, balsamic and brown sugar-pretty good! Would be good with a little goat cheese in the  middle I'm thinking.

I didn't use fresh mushrooms, I really should have.  Plus, fresh breadcrumbs really would have made a difference.  It was still very good and I will probably make it again. Next time I would probably add a bit more spice.

This was very good! :o) I used fresh spinach, and added it to the mushroom/onion mixture (after the onion was cooked)  I used extra sharp cheese, and I am glad I did, otherwise the meat may have been a little bland.  My two year old inhaled it, as did my husband, so I think it was a smashing success.  Thanks!!

Was disappointed.  Quite a lot of work for a meatloaf with spinach inside of it.  Found the filling to be lacking in any flavor that made the work worthwhile.  Nice presentation, but cannot imagine that I will make this again.

Husband loved this and meatloaf isn't his favorite.  Only change I made was use fresh spinach and not and not the frozen.  Also didn't use the nutmeg cuz I was out. Tastes great as leftovers too.  I also cooked in 9x13 dish as another recommended to quicken cooking time.  I beleive this kept it moist and not mushy.  Thanks for the recipe.

my loaf is in the oven but i already know it'll be great! during the rolling process it all cracked, but after rethinking and reading other reviews, i know what to do to not let that happen the next time i make a pinwheeled meatloaf...
i first noticed this recipie because it's creative and definitely can be a "pretty" dish on the table. the ingredients all taste well together and leave room for adding personal touches!

I submitted this a few years ago.  I just want to say...ADD GARLIC to the ingredients.  I always do and just missed including it when it was originally submitted.

I have made this meatloaf twice already & it comes out perfect each time.  You'll love the way it looks when you slice it (for chefs who like to add a little flair to their meals!).  I added a little cilantro to the meat mixture as well as some cayenne.  I also added to thai chilies to the spinach mixture (we love spicy food in our home!).

I really enjoyed this meatloaf. I used a 1/2 of an onion soup packet in the meat mixture and left out the salt. I also added more worcestershire sauce (about 1 tbls) and I added a little ketchup (about 1/4 cup). I did not add an egg to the spinach and mushrooms because I only had 1 egg and I put that egg in the meat, I doubt that it even made a difference the end result still held together just fine. As noted by a previous review this does work well cooked on sheet pan so it does not swim in greece. I also added kethcup and worcestershire to the top of the loaf and that kept the top from drying out. Tasty and pretty!

One of my family's favourite meals.
I substitute ground turkey for pork.
Double the mushrooms and onions (with a minced garlic clove) and put  half in the meat mixture and save some for the top with some ketchup and parmesian chese sprnkled on top before you bake it.
I also bake @375 for the 2nd half hour. 
Serve with Mashed potatos and steamed veggies!!

I LOVED this recipe.  I sauted a clove of garlic with the onion/mushroom mixture. Didn't have ground pork so used all ground beef. I cooked mine in a stoneware baker with a lid and added cut up red potatoes around the sides of the loaf with a about 1/4 cup of wine. Everyone loved it. Will definately make it again.

This recipe was fantastic! I changed it up a little because I didn't have some of the ingredients and it turned out great!  I added Italian flavored breakfast sausage instead of the pork, I left out the worshteshire, and I substituted 1/2 cup of seasoned, grated parmesean for the chedder.  This is definitely a keeper!

Made this for the family, they ate if up. It was really no more difficult than our old stand-by meatloaf. And the left over meatloaf sandwiches the next day were fantastic.

Yummy!  We loved this recipe!  I didn't have pork and only used lean ground beef.  I am a type 2 diabetic and am always trying to lessen the carbs in recipes, so I substituted bulgur wheat for the bread crumbs.  Also layered some cheese on top of the spinich mixture!  Left the parsley out, not a big fan of it. We really enjoyed it!  Made a simple gravy using soy flour to go on top!  Thanks for an inventive twist on a classic recipe!

I made this once exactly as written and loved it, this time a gave it a twist.  I used Italian sausage instead of the pork. left out the bread crumbs and put Italian cheese in it instead of Cheddar.  I also seasoned the veggies with Italian seasoning.

I'm usually "iffy" on meatloaf, but this one was really, really good! Came together in a snap too. I'll hang on to this recipe for the next time meatloaf is requested in my house.

I used all pork, honey barbecue sauce instead of Worcester sauce, feta instead of cheddar, and put a couple cloves of garlic in, too. Super delicious, especially with the mushrooms.

We tried this recipe tonight and really loved it. My husband is a picky eater and rarely rates anything higher than "not bad". He took a few bites of this meatloaf and said "That's pretty good!" He says we can put it on our favorite recipe list! 

I also wanted to add that you have to be really dilligent about squeezing all of the liquid out of the spinach or your meatloaf might fall apart. I learned that the hard way with other recipes that call for frozen spinach.

This is a great recipe! My only variation is - I use ground chicken instead of pork and fresh spinach which I saute with the mushrooms and onion. You really have to try this recipe.

Very tasty -  substituted ground turkey breast since I had it in the freezer, and hot Italian sausage.  Since there are just 2 of us, I put half of it into the freezer for a quick reheat for another time.  Presentation is very attractive, too.
