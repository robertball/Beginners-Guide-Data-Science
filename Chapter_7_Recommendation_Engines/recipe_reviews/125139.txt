Simply delicious! Some things just go great together and to me the combination of tomato and basil is as classic as peanut butter and jelly. This salad just proves the point.  All I added was a little minced garlic and a bit of salt and pepper - perfect.

I really liked this salad.  I didn't have red wine vinegar, so used balsamic instead, and the dressing really enhanced the tomato flavour.  I can't wait til I have more ripe tomatoes so I can make it again!

Delicious!  A great way to use up fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden.  I chopped the onions and mixed it in with the dressing.  Even the kids gobbled it up.

I only used the dressing part and served over a romaine, tomato, mushroom, cucumber salad.  It was extremely good.  I use it often.

Really nice and tasty with fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden. I think I'll add some chunks of fresh mozzarella to it the next time.

This was a great addition to our weekend cookout!  I did make a few changes though.  Instead of slices, I cut the tomatoes into bite-sized chunks.  I diced the onions and used a vidalia instead of red.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used 1/2 tsp dried basil.  I also added 1/2 tsp each of oregano, salt and black pepper, as this is how I remember my Mom making her tomato salad.  Obviously, the longer this sits, the better it tastes, and after a few hours it was sooo yummy!!  :)

Delicious!!! So easy and everyone loves it. I use heirloom tomatoes and sometimes add in mozzarella balls. The longer you let it sit the better. About an hour. I love to make this when we have company. It always wins!!!

This is a great and easy recipe. I didn't have fresh basil so I used one tablespoon of dried basil instead and let it sit in the fridge for an hour. It came out great. Almost like my mother's.

I'm not a tomato fan, but love growing them.  Made this for a BBQ with everything in my greenhouse.  I added a chopped zucchini and yellow squash, and some Feta cheese as well.  Don't forget the sea salt and pepper.  I tasted the dressing after making it and it was missing something.  The S & P was it.  My guests scarfed this up like it was going out of style.

This was a great salad.  I have a lot of fresh tomatoes coming out of the garden so I was looking for new stuff to do.  I chopped the tomatoes in half & then cut thin slices & chopped the onion into bitesize pieces.  It was fabulous.  I made it & it was gone!  Everyone went back for seconds (and thirds!)

You know, this one was sort of disappointing to us.  I used some nice Campari tomatoes but otherwise followed the recipe, with the exception of cutting the sugar in half.  I made this about two hours ahead and let it sit at room temperature until dinner.  If at all possible I never refrigerate tomatoes, as their flavor diminishes.  When Ohio River Valley tomatoes are available I may try this one again, and Iâ€™ll let it sit longer hoping the flavors will develop a bit more.

I loved the flavor of fresh basil in this salad. I used Vidalia onion instead of red because that's what I had even then it turned out great.

This is good. I would have rather have used fresh cilantro over the basil but that is just personal preference. I tripled the recipe and used the leftovers as a topping for our green salad. Very tasty.

My mother-in-law always made a delicious tomato salad to bring to bbq's. She never measured anything and couldn't  give the exact measurements to me.  Naturally mine never came out as good. This tastes the same as hers.  It is even great when you substitute fresh parlsey for the basil.  Thank you!

This recipe is great for using excess tomatoes (I never thought I'd say that in Alaska!).  It's a throwback to my childhood, my family made this with oregano so I added that.  The only other change is that I used Stevia instead of sugar to make it lower carb.  Wonderful!

I liked this recipe.  I diced the tomatoes and onions, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This would be a great accompaniment to a light summer meal.  It really brings out the fresh flavor of the tomatoes.   I think mozzarella or feta cheese would be a nice addition, but it's very good as it is.

The quality of the ingredients makes a BIG difference.  We're lucky to live in the warm Californian area that was formerly prime farmland.
