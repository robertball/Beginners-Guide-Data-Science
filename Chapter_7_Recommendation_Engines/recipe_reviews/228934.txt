**UPDATE** After doing some research, this pie is missing one cup of light cream!! That is why my earlier review was perplexing as I thought it was missing something, here is my earlier review: "As the name suggests, it is definitely easy to make. I thought it was odd that there was no cream in the mixture but I followed the recipe exactly as written. It turned out fine, the crust formed a crisp layer on top similar to a macaroon, but the inside was still creamy. It is super duper sweet though, too sweet. I think if there was a 1/2-1 cup of cream in the filling that would have helped with the sweetness. I also used Fresh Peaches,  4 cups of sliced peaches. Some of the fresh peaches were quite tart so I couldn't imagine how much sweeter this would be with canned peaches! I served this with a dollop of sour-cream just to balance out the extra sweetness and it was great, everyone ate theirs and asked for seconds so it was still devoured!! Next time I would reduce the sugar by at least a 1/4 cup and add a 1/2 of sour cream to the filling." So, with the inclusion of 1 cup of light cream you might not need to reduce the sugar if you use 4 cups of fresh peaches. I really hopes this helps! :)

This is by far the easiest dessert recipe ever!! And it turns out delicious every time- we used fresh yellow peaches and instead of pouring the mix on top of the peaches in the pie crust, we mixed the ingredients with the peaches in a ziploc bag to insure it was coated completely - everyone loves this recipe including my mom and sis in law who are hard to please

I never heard of a French Peach pie before, but this recipe was very easy.  Also it was very delicious.  What I did do was cut the sugar because I used the canned Peaches that had heavy syrup.  I will try it again with maybe fresh peaches or peaches with the juice.  My family and myself enjoyed this pie.  Thank you.

I loved this! My husband had seconds and I was tempted to. That's how good it was! I read the two reviews available beforehand, and decided to cut the sugar in half, as well as add a quarter cup heavy cream. I also added a bit of crumble topping before baking.
