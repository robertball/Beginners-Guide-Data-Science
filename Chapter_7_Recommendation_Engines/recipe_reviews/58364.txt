I've made this several times...not many recipes leave me wanting more, but this one is wonderful! However, I only use about 2 Tbsp real butter (no margarine) because using the full amount leaves a greasy taste. I also use Campbell's Beef Broth/Double Strength to give it a rich flavor. By draining the canned mushrooms, they absorb more of the beefy flavor from the broth and onion soups. By the way, use the soups full strength from the can; do not add water. Thanks for the recipe; I'm making a double recipe now to take to a church potluck tomorrow. When it finishes baking I'll refrigerate it overnight, then put it in my crockpot at church in the morning and let it heat in the kitchen until it's time to eat.

This rice side dish was EXCELLENT.  I did use chicken broth, and real mushrooms instead and it turned out great.

Tasty & easy. I only used 1/4 cup of butter. I cubed the butter & scattered it on top of the rice mixture before baking.

This recipe is great.  I have found that using chicken broth instead of the beef broth also works very well, especially when serving this with chicken or pork dishes.

I make this a lot, and it's very good. However, my husband doesn't like mushrooms so I sometimes substitute fresh green bell pepper, and it tastes delicious this way also.

Good, but needs some tweaking. It was too much butter for us! Next time I will use 1/4 cup. Also, with both french onion soup and beef broth, it was very salty. Next time I'll use low sodium boullion or dilute a bit with water to cut the salt. Otherwise, extremely easy and very good!

This recipe has awesome flavor. I used low sodium beef broth to cut down on salt. Also, I think canned mushrooms are gross, so I sauteed a mixture of button, crimini, and portobello mushrooms and added those instead. Since I use brown rice and a gas stove, i just did on the stove top instead of the oven-- since brown rice takes so much longer. I am still working to perfect the texture/consistency of the rice, but the yummy flavor is worth the effort.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now (I thought I had a review already)...with a few changes...1/2 cup butter just seems ridiculous... I put in maybe 2 tbs, it really doesn't need all that much.  Instead of mushrooms, about the last 15 mins or so I mix in a bag (or however much you like) of frozen (thawed) mixed vegetables (usually a mix of corn, green beans, carrots, peas).

My family has been making this recipe for years. The only difference is we add a whole bay leave to the cooking process and remove it (it will float to the top) before serving. Adds alittle flavor.

This was so good and so easy!  My husband does not like mushrooms, so I left them out.  I'd love to make it with mushrooms just for me - I bet it would be wonderful.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is good for a base recipe.  I used Arborrio rice as it is the only white rice I had.  Most reviewers said to cut back on the butter which I did to 1/4 cup.  I didn't have the french onion soup so I used one envelope of Lipton onion soup mix and added a can of water.  I was making this for my husband who hasn't been feeling well and wanted something mild and easy on the stomach for lunch.  He loves mushrooms so I used two cans.  He loved the rice and ate two bowlfuls.

EXCELLENT! I must admit I have been making this recipe for quite some time now, but just realized that I have not rate or reviewd this. This has got to be my family's favorite dish, out of all the recipes here. My two teens and husband all make it on their own without me, which is fine with me. I did however make a couple of changes to this recipe, I omitted the mushrooms and used chicken broth instead of beef broth. This is so popular with my friends and family. We all love it! Thank you Ralph for sharing!

Really nice recipe as written. This is what we always call "Baked Rice". Great with a little Garlic/Herb Seasoning as well. Thanks for posting  a reliable dish we can turn to over and over again.

This is a classic in our family - we've made this for as long as I can remember!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I use 1 1/2 cups rice rather the one cup called for here - seems like one cup wouldn't be enough to soak up all of the liquid.  I also love mushrooms and use a large can instead of the small one.  This is the easiest recipe you will ever come across, and I've never met anyone who didn't love it!

It is what it is called.  I am not a big fan of mushrooms so I leave them out, but its great with just the rest.  Like many, I cut the butter down, usually to just a bit more than a tablespoon likely.  Even though this has a beefy flavor, I love to make this with some of the lighter flavored chicken recipes.

OK but not great. May try again with fresh mushrooms and somehow beef up the beef taste.

It was ok.  I used 1/2 of the butter due to other reviews and think that more would've been WAY too much.  I also used fresh mushrooms.  I think it needs something, but I'm not sure what.  I will probably make again and experiment...I think it has potential to be a great side for my family.

First of all, canned mushrooms? only the fresh ones in my house. That being said, I had to use the low sodium soups because one of the people attending has to watch their salt intake....guess what? I felt it would have been wonderful if it had just a little more salt....in otherwords, use the fully loaded stuff unless you have to cut the salt.

This was good.  I had tried a recipe that was similar.  Well, since I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup it was identical.  I didn't realize it until after dinner and I was reading my review for the other recipe.

I like this. I increased the rice by 1/2 cup, added another can of onion soup, and used 1/2 cup butter total. Also used fresh mushrooms. In the oven for about 45 minutes - perfectly done. Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out even better that I anticipated. I did have to uncover it and let it bake a couple minutes longer just because it was pretty soupy, but otherwise perfect recipe. I didn't cut back on butter like others suggested and it was just right to me. I guess it's personal taste. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe collection!

We cooked all the food for our wedding and I wanted to give my father a good and easy recipe so he could help out.  This was perfect!  We scaled it to serve 75 and though we used less soup and broth than called for it was still too soupy.  Everybody still loved it, though, and I think if we were to do another wedding again (god forbid ;) that using half the liquid called for might just be about right.  Still a great recipe--thank you harrison23.

I'd give it 6 stars if that were possible. This was sooo good.  I reduced the butter/margarine (it would have been too greasy for us) and added a little water to reduce sodium since I did not have reduced sodium broth.  I also sprinkeld a little black pepper over it.  I did not have any dill but used dried mushrooms. I cannot wait to make this at the next potluck!!  A great recipe.  Tweak it to your taste.

This rice was so easy and delicious. I didn't have canned mushrooms but I did have fresh. I just sliced a handful up and threw them in. Cooked beautifully. The rice did not have a greasy appearance in the pan nor did it taste greasy, but it left grease all over the plate. Looked a little unappetizing. Next time I may cut the butter in half.

Just okay. This is similar to the maria's rice recipe. I would recommend cooking in a rice cooker. It makes fluffier rice.

I made this once and really liked it.  It uses an ingredient I don't normally have in the pantry so it takes some pre-planning but it's worth it for a good side dish.

My family absolutely loves this recipe. Just a few tips however, keep an eye on it. Everyone's oven temps vary and you will want to make sure there is enough liquid in there to keep the rice moist enough to get it completely done. I had to play around with mine a bit to get the time and the liquid amount just right. Also, be sure to spray the bottom of your pan really good to keep it from sticking. Once you figure out the time/liquid ratio for your oven this rice turns out wonderful and has a terrific flavor.

Yummy!  We made this last night with the broiled pesto salmon from this site also and wished that we had doubled the batch.  I used fresh mushrooms and chicken broth instead, as well as cut the butter in 1/2. Thanks I'll make this again.

I can't find french onion soup here so I sauteed two medium onions along with 1/2 cup of mushrooms in 2T olive oil. Once they were soft, I poured in 1/2C dry red wine and cooked until the liquid was gone. I added the mushroom and onions to the rice along with 21ounces of beef broth and the butter. Turned out a little mushy - but very flavorful.

I have to admit that I was leary of trying this recipe initially - I thought there would be too much liquid for the amount of rice...but it was perfect.  I did make a couple of changes to the recipe; I used about 3/4 of minced fresh mushrooms sauteed in a little butter with a clove of garic.  I also reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and the rice was good like that.  Next time I make this recipe, I will try cooking it in the microwave.

This is my favorite rice dish because it tastes great and is so easy! However, I make it with beef broth and regular french onion soup (not condensed)... I will have to try it with the condensed and see how that goes!!!

I saved this recipe years ago and never made it until last week.  LOVED it!  It is a small side dish that three of us enjoyed.  There was a tiny bit left for the next day because we were all being polite.  I will be making this again and would try doubling it and making a 9x13 pan of it for a larger group.  Very easy to make; we had it with baked chicken and a salad.  I am going to try it next with some slivered almonds or chopped walnuts to add some protein and crunch.

Yuuummm! The only thing I change is the amount of butter called for -- I use only 1/4 cup and find that's plenty.  But use butter NOT margarine!  This is probably my favorite rice recipe, ever.  It's a great side dish as is.  I've also added chopped cooked chicken breast to it and taken it as a potluck dish.  Perfect!

I wasn't sure what to expect of this since it was very different than anything I had ever cooked before, but my boyfriend and I loved it.  It was very homey and tasted a bit like southern cornbread dressing for some odd reason.

I used fresh mushrooms, since I think they always taste better.

I can't believe how simple and good this was.  I don't like mushrooms so I left them out, and used 1.5c rice.  No mess, no fuss and the family loved it.  Not too salty; perfectly seasoned and fluffy.  What more can I say?  This will stay in our rotation.  Thanks!

Very easy and delicious. I made two changes. I added a second can of mushrooms and used reduced sodium beef broth. Thank you for a delicious recipe.

I love the simplicity of this dish.  I only used 1/4 cup of butter which seemed like plenty.  This rice does end up quite salty tasting however.  The following day I used what was left and tossed in leftover cut up steak for a quick meal. So easy I'm sure I will make again.

This was ok.  I made it two different way's one in my rice cooker with a can of the french onion soup.  The other I made in the the oven with a Onion Soup packet.  All agreed, The oven rice came out much better, it was far more flavorful.  The only problem I had with my oven rice, was the bottom stuck to the pan.  The rice in the rice cooker still came out pretty good, just a bit more bland.  I dont know if I'll be making it again..My husband didn't care for the onion soup flavoring.

Awesome Rice! Great flavor, nice and tender and moist. I followed the recipe as stated but did add another 1/2 cup of rice after reading the reviews. I baked it at 350 for an hour and it was perfect. I probably could have cut down on the butter but it was just wonderful and tasted so buttery and not greasy. It will be fun trying the chicken broth next time to see how that flavor is. We will enjoy this for years.

Good recipe.  I did use fresh mushrooms and onion soup mix as I didn't have french onion soup in a can.  I also did cut the butter in half.

Made as written and it was good. Did cut down the baking time though. Next time I will leave out the mushrooms as my kids ate it until they "discovered" the dish had mushrooms in it.

My husband loved this recipe.  I didn't have any beef broth so I just added some granulated bouillon to some water.  I do think the next time I made it that I'll add about 1/2 the butter.  I also took the foil off and cooked it for about 15 minutes at the end to dry up some of the broth and crisp up some of the rice.  This is certainly a recipe I'll make again.

This recipe could not have been easier!!  Jump dump and bake.  Next time I will bake for 45-50 minutes instead of the full 1 hour... was a little overdone.  Great flavor and versatile side dish.  So simple a child could make this!

Exceptionally easy, good flavor.  I think the cooking time could be cut back a bit as the rice was a little over done, but we will try this again.

Very tasty...  I didn't use the canned mushrooms, I sauteed 8 ozs of mushrooms w/ about 2tsp. of fresh rosemary over med/high heat for 15mins or until very well cooked.  I added this to the rice AFTER it had cooked in the oven.  NOTE--Too much butter, I thought as it pooled on the bottom.  Very good though

This is the best and easiest way I have ever made rice!!  I don't usually have french onion soup so I just used beef broth.  I also sauteed my mushrooms in garlic and the results are excellent.  I now make this as a side very regularily.

Thanks!!!

Yummy! Lots of flavor and sooooo easy!  Great side dish.  I did follow other reviewers suggestion and used 1/4 c butter but rice was a little sticky so I may use 1/2 c next time. Also wasn't sure what to do but I drained the can of mushrooms and consistency was fine.
