I use this to make a quick egg, ham & cheese sandwich.  Instead of using a mug, I use a microwaveable bowl.  Mix the egg up with some seasonings, cover with a paper towel and cook on high for 1 minute.  Put bread in toaster. When egg is done, I place ham and cheese on top and let it set for a minute.  Then put it on the toast.

WOW!  This was fantastic!  How can you not like a recipe that is delicious, fast, easy, and doesn't dirty a bunch of dishes.  I microwaved 2 mugs for 1-1/2 minutes and it was still too runny.  I just stirred it again, and popped back in the microwave for another minute.  PERFECTION!  You could clean out your fridge with ingredients to add to the eggs:  spinach, tomato, mushrooms, bacon, ham, sausage, scallions...you name it.  This is a wonderful recipe!

This is a very good recipe. I just made it for the first time with ham, cheese, and green onion. Quick and easy! Can't wait to try it on the kids for breakfast!! Don't forget to spray the mug... I did and it looks like it'll need a good soaking!!

Easy and delicious without a ton of prep or clean up!What more could you ask for from a simple yet filling breakfast? Perfect for when you need something "on the go". I've been making this for my husband to take to work and you can use any type of microwave-safe dish as long as you spray it with Pam. Watch your cooking times as microwave strengths vary - you don't want the eggs to explode. This recipe is a great base: use your favorite cheeses or breakfast meats and add-in whatever veggies you have on hand. You can even lighten it up by using Egg Beaters and fresh herbs! This works great for breakfast sandwiches on biscuits or English muffins or try it in a warm tortilla for a breakfast wrap.  Whatever you choose it's bound to be good!

This is great - easy, fast eggs that only dirty one dish! I didn't have any peppers and I added a dash of milk to make them a little fluffy. Will make these again

What a great idea! No mess, no fuss, it's perfect for a quick breakfast on the run. I left out the ham since I didn't have any on hand and I added some chopped green onion and red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick. Thank you for sharing, Susan!

5 stars for simplicity!  I just put a cut up slice of American cheese in there instead of cheddar.  It is so simple and delicious.  My husband said that the taste is restaurant-quality!

I have been fixing eggs this way for years . Its great . The reason for my review is this ....for those who add milk for texture (it does nothing for flavor) you will find that water works better . Give it a try , or look it up ...the Food Network chefs comment on it all the time . Water makes them fluffier , without that bit of watery liquid left in the bottom , unless of course you use too much !

A fast, simple yet filling breakfast. Initially, I cooked the egg, ham (slice of lunchmeat), and cheese for one minute. My egg was perfect (set) so I did not need to cook it anymore. My nutritionist recommended this recipe due to the high protein content of the eggs, cheese, and ham.  Protein in the morning means less snacking later.  :)  Thanks for sharing!

Works well.  I'm not sure that this is any faster than a traditional omelet though.   What saves time either way is having ingredients chopped and frozen in baggies.  I guess this may help if you have to make several omelets at once for a big family.  My only tip would be to always start out with 30 second intervals, not the original poster's 1 minute 30 seconds.  This also would depend on your microwave though.  Stirring every 30 seconds is essential to have an evenly cooked omelet.

I have made this for years but put the recipe in a hamburger patty container (microwave safe)because they were the same size as an english muffin. While the eggs are cooking, toast a split english muffin. After the eggs are are set place the eggs on the toasted muffin. Fits perfectly and head out the door with breakfast in hand.

I have made this type of recipe for years only we do it when camping.  You put the ingredients in a thick, sprayed ziplock and place in boiling water.  After about 2 minutes pull out and squish with some tongs to redistribute any uncooked egg then boil for another minute or two.  It comes out tube shaped and great for a pita or tortilla roll.

I've been doing this for years.  Best kind of mug is one of those mugs designed for soup; they're deeper and your egg won't bubble over during the first cooking session.  We prefer chopped green onions to the green peppers.  This is great for nights when you're not all that hungry.  Yummy!

This sounded so odd, I had to try it! I love, love, love this recipe!! I'm a grad student who hates to wash dishes so I needed a quick, healthy breakfast that's fast to make and is easy to clean-up after - this is it! I added some roasted vegetables to mine and it was fantastic. One very important thing to remember - spray the mug! Nightmare if you don't... Also, do one at a time. I've tried making two at the same time and unless you're using the exact same coffee mugs, it doesn't work very well. I also added half & half like others suggested; the eggs stay nice and moist. Overall, my only complaint is that I didn't find this recipe sooner!

I love how easy this is. I've been eating eggs for breakfast. They are high in protein and keep me full until lunch. One dirty mug and one dirty fork is a great improvement. I mixed in a little bit of milk and nuked it for 2 1/2 minutes. It's just as good as cooking it on the stove.

My husband I had doubts, but we love this recipe. It was fun to make and I was like a little kid watching a pixar film. I was in complete amazement. I cooked the omelet for over a minute because at 1 min it was too moist, but about 1 min 60 it came out perfecto. Added fresh bacon, greens onions and some spices. My co-workers will love this recipe too.

What a surprise this was! I had my doubts and I was terrified I'd have to scrub my nuker. I was in such a hurry to try this I didn't add the green pepper. I had some deli ham that I tore up and put in the mug. In all, it took the whole 2 1/2 minutes in my microwave. This turned out really good!! Another reviewer complained she had to soak the mug for days to clean it. I had no problem. I took the egg out when it was done and put hot water in the mug and let it soak while I ate. Clean up was a breeze. Will do this one again and again! Thanks Susan for the recipe.

What a fun recipe!  The eggs come out light and fluffy.  Just add your favorite filling.  It is very hot, so eat with caution!  Definately a breakfast (or anytime!) favorite.

The kids (age 8 and 10) just made these for breakfast all by themselves!  We only used ham, no bell pepper, and had to use sandwich cheese because that's all we had.  The kids loved making them and they were so good.

This was one of the best dishes I ever made.  I like it because you can customize it anyway you want and it comes out.  The funny thing is my egg was HUGE.  I only added a dash of milk to make sure it was moist and it came out with enough to feed two people.  I added an Anaheim pepper instead of a bell pepper for more flavor and I added parmesean cheese in the mug and I added cheddar on top.  It was delicious!  I used butter to butter the mug.  It didn't seem difficult to clean.

Super fast, yummy, and no clean-up! This is MY kind of recipe. I used spinach leaves, feta cheese, and fresh diced tomatoes instead of what was listed... TO DIE FOR! If you try this, though, make sure you don't add them until the eggs are beginning to set (about 60 to 30 seconds left). If they're cooked the whole time you'll end up with mushy veggies that are blended throughout the eggs and with each other... A good thing if you prefer them that way, but I think it's so much better when you can taste each individual ingredient. Happy Eating!

I haven't tried this yet but could this be done in some sort of disposable paper or styrofoam cup for those who have to eat on the run, not that this is the best way to eat.  I can imagine this being the new take out for breakfast.  Imagine this on your local coffee shop, diner or McD's menu, lol.

My son wanted eggs this morning, and I knew I wouldn't have time, and then I remembered this recipe!  I didn't have any ham on hand, so I just mixed 2 eggs, with a Tbsp or so of milk (I didn't measure), and some cheese (again, didn't measure) and salt and pepper.  Cooked for 1 minute, stirred and cooked another minute, and they came out perfect!  My son LOVES my scrambled eggs and says they are the best (kiss up!) but he couldn't tell these were different!

Made this for my hubby this morning before he went fishing.  Quick, no fuss meal that he loved.  Sprayed a cereal bowl with PAM, fork scrambled 2 eggs with 1t water.  Microwaved for 1 min. then  added 2T shredded Mex. cheese + 1 cooked, crumbled bacon strip we had in the fridge & microwaved for 1 more minute.  Wraped it in a whole wheat tortilla and he was out the door!!  I always cook an entire lb. of bacon, put 4 strips per sandwich bag, put all baggies in a zip lock and freeze.  Then you always have cooked bacon for recipes like this.  Hope this helps

I've been making these for years at our camper. Only I use a paper bowl, spray with non-stick spray. Then you just throw away the bowl. Makes a perfectly round egg, for a sandwich. Yum, Yum...

I loved the idea of this, as we eat a LOT of eggs and it is so quick and easy.  I made this for my son and he said it was terrible.  I took a couple bites and they were pretty bad.  To be fair I omitted the green pepper and ham cause I didn't have them on hand.  The egg (and cheese) by itself really can't compare to eggs scrambled on a skillet.

This is fantastic!! I used the real bacon bits, green onion, s&p, along with the cheese... Perfect single portion, you can chop up to wrap in a tortilla on the go. Or place on top of an english muffin for an eggs benedict style, even as a bagel sandwich.  My husband has no idea I made this in 2 minutes.

used three eggs, took me about three minutes to get it to where I wanted it, worked great.  Note: Do not use a coffee cup that has a hollow handle...I didn't realize my husbands favorite Crafstman mug was a hollow handled mug (it was the right size so I grabbed it) and eggs inside the handle were not easy to clean out. Oops, live and learn. Thank you for the easy recipe, we will be using it again and again.

Even though I'm off from work today, I didn't want to dirty up the kitchen.  This was quick and yummy.  I added milk but I read that water works better.  No mess and it could easily go in a tortilla or english muffin.  I think next time, I'll limit cook time to 2 min.  The mug keeps it super hot and I think it kept cooking the omelet.

Remember when microwaves first came out? This was one of those "I can't beleive an egg could taste so good!" things that you could "whip" up in a microwave. I make this all the time for a quick, hot, healthy breakfast. You can pretty much add what you want to make the prefect omlet. Just remember to spray a bit of cooking spray in your cooking container for a little faster clean-up. Enjoy!

I love quick and easy recipes, so when I seen this I had to try it. I thought the recipe turned out well, however it is much tougher of an omelet then what I normally make in a pan. I had expected that though in a way. I didn't have ham so I used 1 Tblsp of mushrooms and 1 of tomatoes for the 2 Tblsp of ham. I did chop the vegetbles in about a large mince and they were cooked in the 2 1/2 minutes suggested on the recipe. I also used an oven safe soup bowl, which I was glad I did because the omelet expanded quite tall as it cooked. Overall, I really can't complain for an omelet in which I didn't need to clean a pan.

If you are in a rush for breakfast this would be the recipe to try.  It is very fast, easy, and little clean up.  I still prefer the traditional way of making an omelet but this worked.

Don't know why no one had thought of this before! I don't like bell pepper, but it' still wonderful without. I've thrown in leftover spinach, pepperoni... So many variations. If you use meat like bacon/pepperoni/etc that is fairly fatty, you don't even have to spray the mug with nonstick spray.  This is great for when I'm in a rush.

I really liked the ease and novelty of this little omelet.    Since I always add ilk to my omelets I added a dash to this too and since I used a soup mug I also used three eggs and real bacon bits.  As it turned out, my mug was big enough that I could have used five eggs.  It was a bit dry, but I don't like cheese in my omelets and I think that would have added some much needed moisture.  All in all a great little recipe.  Thanks!

These were fun to make and husband loved them, but no matter what I do to make it fun, kids will not eat. that is just my kids though. they looked so pretty. Like souffles in a glass mason jar. (What I used.) great to post on site with  pictures.

BRILLIANT IDEA!!! I did modify it a bit though, I used a small bowl and 3 eggs and bacon instead of ham. I also put in onions and after the 1st minute in the microwave, I stirred in tomato also! YUM!!!!

I used to make omelets in a little plastic omelet maker I bought from walmart and it takes alot longer. I am always in a hurry in the morning so this is perfect for me. Thanks so much for sharing.

Delicious and easy to prepare. I used grated parmesean instead of cheddar, turned out great. Once the 'omelet' was cooked, I heated a burrito size tortilla in the microwave for 10 seconds, then wrapped my egg mixture inside, and added a little salsa. Following others' advice I added a pat of butter to the mug before cooking, as well as adding a splash of milk to the eggs.

This was good, but after trying it in a mug I tried a bowl and I think that may have worked better -- the size was just right for making an egg sandwich that way, too.

Good and fast!  I used only 1 egg and 1 minute was almost too much.  I also made this into a sandwich so I only added salt & pepper to the egg before cooking it.  When it was done I put a slice of american cheese on top, let it sit for a minute to melt, then put it on a toasted english muffin with a piece of honey ham.  Wow!  Better than the ones we used to slave over!  My husband added herbs, onions and shredded cheese to his but wasn't too happy with it, he said it tasted funny, could have been the herbs though.

This recipe lends itself to all kinds of ideas.  I've made it as is, and also with Egg Beaters, or without ham, or with Laughing Cow cheese, or without peppers, or with diced canned chilies... What a winner.  And so flexible!

I made this with eggs, cheese, and canadian bacon, and it was very good. I gave it 4 stars because microwaved eggs have a slightly odd texture and the only time this method really saves is a few minutes in the cooking.

Pretty decent!  It came out a little dry, and kind of reminds me of cafeteria eggs... but hey, I'm a college student.  We don't exactly have standards.
Used pepperoni (cooked for 1min beforehand) as the meat, added lots of cheese.  Yum!

I was definitely skeptical.  Scrambled eggs from a mug in the microwave?  Works great! Amazingly simple and will be something my kids can fix for themselves on school mornings. Tastes just like eggs from the pan- just watch that it doesn't 'bubble over' as it grows, and let it cool since it's hotter than eggs straight from the skillet. So glad to find this.

Watching it cook in the microwave was a laugh.
It formed an adorable cylinder and rose up over the mug and fell back down to the bottom.
Easy cleanup, fun to make any way you want. (I used Bacon, Ham, Turkey, and tomatoes) Perfect for having houseguests due to the lack of dishes.
A + :)

Clearly, the cooking time varies from one microwave to another.  I made these for breakfast for our family last week (the stove was broken), and they didn't go over well.  Also, I had to soak the mugs for DAYS before I could scrub them clean, even though I had sprayed them before cooking.

I used one egg, and sausage crumbles instead of ham. This worked great. I can see this being a quick and easy way to make a homestyle McMuffin. Perch the egg atop a toasted English muffin, wrap in a napkin and you're out the door!

I can never make an omelet right, so I tried this one. I figure how hard is it to screw up an omlet in a mug!!? This turned out good. It was really hot (temperature wise), but other than that, it was a basic omelet.

I will make this again b/c it's super easy to bring the ingredients into work & make for breakfast.  Thanks so much for sharing this easy & yummy recipe!

This does work without the spray.  I used an oversized coffee mug and 2 eggs.  I added bologne and cheese to mine.  I stirred it after the first minute, then again after the second minute and every 30 seconds or so until cooked.  It took almost 2 minutes in my microwave.  You end up with more like scrambled eggs, but the eggs won't stick this way.

What a terrific idea.  You can use whatever you have on hand.  I used scallion and sliced grape tomatoes, seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper.  I miked it for 1 min, stirred, and cooked for another minute. Yum! And clean up is a breeze.  The kids can finally make their own eggs for breakfast, no fuss!

First time I made this, I made exactly as written since I was only making it for me.  Since then, I provide the eggs mixed with water in the mug, and then provide various breakfast meats, cheeses, and veggies and spices to accommodate the personal preferences of the family/guests. That way,each person gets to personalize their mug. Serve with warm tortillas on the side.

Just made it for the first time today with cheese only (no meat or veggies on hand). I have to say I'm impressed. I wake up every morning at 4am to get ready for work at 5 and I believe this will now be my breakfast of choice. Fast and easy when I'm half asleep before work :)

I am giving this a 5 for it being a quick and simple breakfast and fasy & easy cleanup! I love that it can be adapted to what you like or have on hand! I would give it a 4 or 4 1/2 on taste since I don't really care for microwaved eggs they seem a bit rubbery sometimes.

This was fantastic!  Since I didn't have the exact ingredients I used a cut-up slice of Swiss cheese and a few pieces of ham lunchmeat, and a shake of Mrs. Dash since I don't eat salt.  I had everyone in the house try it and it was a big hit.  I know it'll be my breakfast staple for a long time to come.

Loved making this tasty yet easy breakfast for one!!! My micro cooks pretty slowly, so I stirred at 30 sec. then cooked for another 1 1/2 min; thought it wasn't done, so I cooked it for another 30 sec. It didn't need that last 30 sec. It was a little over done but delicious anyhow! Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe!  Make a healthier version of egg mcmuffin. Instead of cooking spray, use a tsp of water in bottom of mug or bowl, crack egg in and break yolk and whites with a fork. Cover with paper towel & microwave 55 - 60 seconds (it will pop) Pat egg dry on paper towel. Slice the bread in half and put 2% american cheese on on one side & canadian bacon on the other side, put in toaster oven until cheese is slightly melted. Combine to make sandwich.  If you like, add mustard to the bread & salt & pepper to the egg.

I like to make eggs in the microwave. Make sure you spray the mug with cooking spray for easier clean up! I don’t like green pepper in eggs, so I left that out. The cooking time is way off for my microwave. I cooked for 30 seconds, stirred, and then cooked 25 more, and it was plenty done.

This was very good. I left out the peppers, added milk. When it was done it was a little tough so I broke it up and added about 1 1/2 T. cream cheese and stirred until it melted.

I was a little skeptical about how this would taste, but it was great! I used bacon bits and cheese and it came out tasting great.

I was skeptical, but the eggs really do cook up pretty fluffy in the microwave.  I like to add a touch of milk to my scrambled eggs.  Kids loved this recipe, and less clean-up!

This was much better than I expected. I did not have ham so I used chopped tomatoes and scallions. You can really use whatever you like in your omelet. Definately a quick easy way to have breakfast.

Made it for the first time this morning.  What a time saver and very tasty!  I used some real bacon pieces (from jar) instead of ham.

I am so glad I found this recipe! I just put some cheddar and leftover roasted potatoes from the night before in mine. It was awesome...I really want to start making this with different veggies and hopefully become more of a breakfast person! And I'm a huge fan of quick and easy and not dirtying a bunck of dishes ;)

It was very easy to do but we were not impressed with the results. It was very dry and overcooked. I cooked for one minute, stirred and then cooked for 1 minute more. It was so dry I gave it to the dog.I might try it one more time and reduce the cooking time.

Pretty easy to make.  No real mess.  I microwaved for 1 minute, stired and another 1/2 minute.  Perfect!  Will use the recipe/technique again!

This was great and actually made two omelet sandwiches for me because I used bagels.  You could (and should) cut them in half and make 4 sandwiches, but it was so good, I didn't. Use any veggies you have on hand and whatever cheese you have on hand.

This has endless possibilities. You can add whatever you have on hand, whatever tastes suit you at the moment. An easy, good meal. Followed others' suggestions and buttered the cup. Quick and tasty. Easy!

Fabulous!  The eggs are actually fluffier this way.  I'm going to try other combos as well.  Thank you, Susan!

We're in the middle of remodeling our kitchen.  I currently don't have a stove to cook on so I looked for some microwave recipes.  Found this one and WOW!  The egss came out PERFECTLY FLUFFY! My kids and hubby loved them and the kids were excited that they can now make eggs on their own.  I did add a little bit of milk (per reviewer recommendations) and some Hormel Real Crumbled Bacon (I didn't have ham or pepper and don't have a stove too cook bacon on).  This was a quick and perfect breakfast out of the micro.  Good flavor too.  I use medium cheddar which adds more flavor than mild cheese and the flavor of the real bacon bits came thru beautifully.  We were all very pleased and pleasantly surprised with this one.

This was a great idea! I used it to make up some eggs for my 2yr old really fast while I was in the middle of cleaning. You can tell that they were microwaved tast wise, but you can't beat the convienence!!!!!

This is a good and fast recipe to make a quickie breakfast that can be eaten on the go.  My daughter loves this for something to eat in a pinch and the mobility factor is a big plus.  I use a slice of American Cheese and one piece of ham deli meat, and tear them up into the mug with the two eggs.  A dash of milk and a few minutes later, a nice hot breakfast!  Definitely a keeper!

This was really good, not to mention quick and easy. I used fresh spinach and Eggbeaters. Make sure you don't fill your mug too high or you'll have a lava overflow like I did. Made a great lunch today.  Thank you Susan!!
