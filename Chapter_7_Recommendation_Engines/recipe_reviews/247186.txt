changed this up to make it healthier and still taste good.

Removed the banana as we don't like them and added Chia seeds around 2 tsp for 2 servings.  Do 3/4 C. oats and 1C. of milk, couple drips of vanilla, the Chia seeds, couple tsp. of Cinnamon grounded, handful of blueberries. place lid on shake and put in refrigerator. 

The blueberries give just eight sweetness, to make it good.

I made it without almond butter, as I didn't have any and with 2% milk instead of almond milk. It was very good. Next time I may try it with quick oats to allow the milk to absorb more completely.

This made an easy, good breakfast. I didn't use maple syrup but added a little less than 1/4 tsp maple flavoring instead along with some stevia for sweetness. A great breakfast to have in the frig for when I need to get up and out of here on time.
