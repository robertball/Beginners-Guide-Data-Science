I made this dish six times for each member of my dinner exchange club. All six said their families loved this. My husband does too. Very easy and do not feel any changes are needed. I bought meat already cut for kabobs to save time.

Mmmm, these were SO GOOD! I loved how the beef was juicy, but not oily or herby like other kabob recipes. Instead of freezing them, I just put the vegetables and meat in 2 separate small ziplock bags and refridgerated them 4-5 hours before cooking. The only changes I made was for the meat I had 2 NY Strip steaks. I trimmed the fat and cut them into 1" cubes. Out of everything I got 8 kabobs and at most about 3 servings. I did 1/2 red and 1/2 green bell pepper for the peppers, as it was what I had, and I also subbed white wine vinegar for the cider vinegar for the same reason. I definitely plan to make this again, but next time I will double it!

We loved this recipe! So easy to just pull out of the freezer for a busy day! Healthy and flavorful. I do like to make the beef in the marinade and freeze, and then use fresh vegetables with the defrosted beef.

This is delicious!  The sauce is positively yummy!  I left the beef cubes in the sauce for over 24 hours so the flavor was really prominent.  I did not freeze anything but did cut the veggies and fruit the day before.  I also added Asian pear to the skewers and sliced onion.  I highly suggest saving some of this sauce as a "dip" for additional meat.  Maybe try this on burgers?  Good stuff!

marinade was so so, Vegetables were good raw and unfrozen ist night.  After freezing they were just a mushy soft mess.  I will not use this method again.

good idea for the beef,but i waited till ready to make for veggies
because they get soggy when thawed from frozen and it only takes a short time to cut them up fresh

Loved the marinade so much that I made it again tonight, omitted the water, and basted pork chops with it.  Fabulous!!

I made these fresh (didn't bother to freeze any) and they were SO delicious. I didn't change a thing (except added a few white onion slices). We really enjoyed the flavor combinations from the pineapple, meat, and veggies. My husband asked if we could eat these every Wednesday, so I might have to try freezing some for next time.

I bought top sirloin and never froze it. Marinated it per instructions for about 4.5 hours. 
Same with the shrimp except only marinated it about 1 hour. 
The steak was very tender however the marinade was overwhelming.  The taste of soy sauce overpowered it as well as the oil.  
The shrimp marinade also was mostly the flavor of the olive oil.  I don't know, maybe I shouldn't have marinated them for the amount of time I did??
I also used yellow and purple onions, squash as well as red and orange bell peppers.
