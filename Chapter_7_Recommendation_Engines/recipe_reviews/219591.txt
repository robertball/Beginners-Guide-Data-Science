I give this a word rating good, because it can be improved in my opinion by not limiting the chicken to legs, and by thickening the sauce with corn starch and garnishing with pom seeds sprinkled onto it. If doing so, using the extra juice would be good in the marinade but test for sweetness and tartness.

The blend of spices worked so well together with the pomegranate juice.  The little bite from the peppers and sweetness from the juice left for an amazing after taste.  Served it with rice and broccoli.  Only change I think I'll make is a little more juice so I have more to top it with and maybe save only 1/4 instead of 1/3 of the blend for the second part.  
Already made a blend of the dry herbs and put it aside for the next time I make it.

This looks very good. I would rather not use legs if serving to company - maybe thighs but would definitely leave the skin on to prevent drying out. If it needs sweetening I think honey would be nice which would improve the glazing, too. Would rather not give a rating now but can't post without one.

This was good. I used thighs and just put all the spices (minus the herbs de provence which I didn't have) in the marinade at once. In the last 10min of baking I drizzled the reduced marinade over the chicken. served it over yellow rice.

It was okay,  I thought that there was too much spices and I had already cut it down by a quarter.  I will one day again try it until perfection.

We enjoyed the flavors in this chicken very much although you'd never guess there was pomegranate in the sauce.  Our problem came with the amount of powdered spices.  I followed the recipe exactly, marinating it over night and then coating the chicken with the remaining spice mix, and then reducing the marinade.  There was so much spice caked on the outside of the meat resulting in a dry grainy crust that really detracted from the tender meat and the sauce was so saturated with the dry spices that it was visually unappealing and practically ineatable.  I tried straining it and mixing in a bit of honey yogurt.  While the flavors were good I would recommend only using half the amount of spices listed in the recipe.

Chicken was moist and tender and flavorful even though I didn't have the herbes de provence I did my own variation. The only thing that was disappointing was the marinade burned off the chicken even though I only added it the last 15 minutes.

I've made this twice, the first time with breasts because my wife doesn't like dark meat.  I think I cooked them to long they were a little more dry than I like.  she loved them though.  The second time I marinated some boneless skinless thighs for two days.  Excellent flavor.  I made enough seasoning to use again.

I have made this recipe a few times with chicken thighs and it is extremely tasty. I have frequently served it at dinners we have hosted and it always has been well received. The spices and the pomegranate juice give it a lot of flavor, even though I have never been able to track down the herbs de provence.

Spices did not blend well together, and overpowered the taste of pomegranate juice
