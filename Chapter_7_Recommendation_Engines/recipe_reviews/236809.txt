This recipe was a great find.  I loved the creaminess of the yolk and avocado mixture.  The lime juice was also detectable, which we enjoyed.  I only made 3 hard-boiled eggs and used all the yolks in the recipe.  Yes, I did have extra filling, but I just finished it on a cracker or two.  The one change I made was an optional item.  Instead of the dash of hot sauce, I added a sprinkle of the cayenne pepper.  Eggs were delish, and a definite keeper in this house.  Thanks, thehealthyhousewife for sharing.

Made a dzen and a half today for Memorial Day parties and they were a huge hit with the adults and kids too! I didn't have lime juice on hand so I used lemon, a little more garlic than called for, and left out the turkey bacon (I didn't have any either), added the pepper to the filling and also sprinkled on top.  It had a great flavor, not too heavy, and with just enough kick to make it exciting.  Thank you for sharing.

What a nice twist to the deviled egg!!! I had to make a day ahead so I put the filling in a plastic bag, squeezed out the air and filled egg shells the next day.

I didn't have mayo or bacon and they were still great!  I used more avo in place of the mayo, and then smoked paprika on top.  Delicious!

This recipe turned out great!  The flavors are good together, but I added a second squeeze of lime and a touch more cayenne to kick it up a notch. The only thing is that I made them a day before and they turned a really ugly green.  The lime juice didn't help to preserve the color much.

I normally don't leave my comments, but for this one i will. THIS IS A WINNER! I made these and a few others for Easter and yes all gone. i didn't change anything, but I did accidentally forget to add the jalapenos but with the hot sauce I didn't notice. Check out my pic. As you will notice they are colored eggs for Easter of course. I used the dying instructions also on this site.  I have been asked to make these again along with the other 2 deviled eggs prepared from this site as well. Shrimp n Bacon Cheddar Deviled eggs.

This is the yummiest Deviled Egg recipe I have ever used! I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used paprika for the same effect. Thank-you for the great recipe!

Delish! I used real bacon and pickled jalapeno slices for garnish. Made it chunky for a nice guacamole taste and appearance. Would definitely make this for a St Patty's Day party!

This might be my new favorite!  Very creamy filling, wonderful flavor combination.  Plus the bonus leftover avocado/yolk has many uses.  Thanks!

Pretty good.  It really was creamy. For our family, I would add more cayenne and maybe some more dashes hot pepper sauce.  I like the idea of sriracha and wasabi, that someone else mentioned.  But, I was out of jalapenos and that might have made the world of difference.

I love avocados and was raised on an avocado ranch many years ago.I think I will try this recipe but add some cooked brown rice and use the avocado shell instead of the egg white shell.I love deviled eggs so am anxious to try this recipe.

Sometimes a new take will expand upon something good, making everything better. Sometimes a new take involves removing the best parts, the yolk and mayonnaise,  and substitute avocado. The end result is a sickly green paste, bereft of the familiar taste. These were pretty vile, but two family members were too kind to tell me otherwise.

This was a hit with a big crowd.  I made these and traditional deviled eggs and the avocado eggs got snached up first.  Made with Whole30 compliant bacon in place of turkey bacon.  They were amazing.

Amazing.  I omitted the hot sauce as I didn't have any on hand and didn't buy any.  Just the right amount of heat.  I also only put jalapenos on half for those that don't enjoy spicy.  This are definitely my go to deviled eggs going forward.

I took these to a party and whereas I thought the jalapeno was an exciting new flavor, it turned off most folks.  Those that ate them, took the jalapenos off.

Maybe I did something wrong but to me these weren‚Äôt that great. Seemed a little runny and not super flavorful. I followed the recipe pretty closely except I added some additional hot pepper flakes. Even w that it was a little bland. I think there is too much mayo as the recipe is written. I read others skipped the mayo and added more avocado, and I would do that next time if I were to make this again. I‚Äôd still use a little mayo but just a little. Also, I served these right away so maybe they firm up more if refrigerated. Regardless, I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the flavor or consistency.

This recipe is delicious. I used 8 eggs because I thought the filling needed more yolk to balance the flavors. Additionally, they weren't spicy enough for our crowd so I sprinkled with a bit of crushed red pepper. It was a big hit at the picnic. I'll definitely be making these again.

This was absolutely delicious. The additional hot sauce dollop on top really makes it. I do not have any changes to the ingredient list, it was a pretty solid recommendation.

My wife is allergic to both onion and garlic, so the garlic was left out. Normally I would increase salt, and/or add chipotle or jalape√±o pepper, as we both like spicy food, but I was not so sure about our company that would also be eating these. The end result was a fairly bland filling, that I was not totally impressed with. Notably, there were only 3 halves left, so somebody enjoyed them! I gave 4 stars because I'm pretty sure this would have absolutely  tasted as good as it looked, and it looked great, with the addition of garlic.

My husband and I made this together for a St. Patrick‚Äôs Day party. Everyone loved it. We decided to use real bacon instead of turkey bacon but otherwise followed the recipe as it is written.

These went over well at my New Year's party.
Hot spices and I do not agree, so skipped them. Added a bit of extra bacon instead.  You probably won't have any left over, but if you do, you might as well devour them. The avocado does not keep well. Will make them again!

This was an excellent recipe. The texture of having diced avocados, mixed with a little tang of the lime juice, brought these deviled eggs to life!

Great twist on an old favorite. I left out the garlic and jalepeno and it was still stellar! I also used the egg yolks which this recipe does not mention

These were great!  Even my wife (who eats no "heat", ate these and loved them.  Definitely will make again and again.  When that avocado on the counter begins to get a little too soft, this makes a great use for it.

I love this recipe.  It makes a lot more filling than you need, but that just means there is more to snack on when done.  My family also likes this.  With a dash of hot sauce, there is a little heat with a lot of flavor.  I didn‚Äôt make any variations.

I thought these were really good. I used regular bacon and garlic powder instead of fresh. You end up with leftover filling if you use all the yolks. If I made these again, I would probably cut the mayo at least in half, as it just needs a tad to make it creamier, but I didn't think it needed all that it called for.

Be careful!  If you're not quick enough, you won't even get to taste these delectable little morsels of goodness.  I made ~2.5 x the recipe....and, still only managed a wee-taste.  
Have been asked to make again....

Excellent  recipe  for  those who like  avocados.
The directions are easy to follow and the end result
is  delicious . Mixes well with your left over hard boiled
eggs.

I was too generous with my mayo so the filling was too runny but still tasted good. I do not like hot foods so adjusted the spices. Bacon would have added flavor if I had some :(.

I made it per the recipe to start, but found it pretty bland. Added some lime juice, hot sauce , and paprika. Still just okay. They have a very short shelf life because of the avocados.

I liked this. However, I did not make it as written. I used only 5 eggs. I also cooked 4 slices of turkey bacon, because that was what was on hand. When I took the mayo out of the fridge, it was slightly past its due date... hmm. Take no chances with mayonnaise -- omitted it. Then I couldn't be bothered with the garlic -- lazy Sunday morning, I guess. I used only half of an avocado, again because that's what I had on hand.  Fresh lime, yes. So I mashed all in the bowl as required, put a dollop on a cooked egg, and thought it was not too bad, considering I had scrimped and/or omitted ingredients. Will make again -- this time following the posted directions.

2.7.17   Used all of the yolks and loved the creaminess that the avocado brought to this deviled egg.  I added a bit more lime juice and crushed garlic and a healthy shot of Sriracha to kick up the flavor.  Used heart-shaped egg molds, since Valentine's Day is just around the corner, but those molds didn't work too terribly well.  Very nice change from the traditional deviled egg, we enjoyed them.

I was intrigued by this recipe because everyone loves avocados in my family, especially guacamole. So I loved the idea of a guacamole-like deviled egg.  I skipped the bacon and didn't have any fresh jalape√±os so I used a half cup of canned and added a little more lime juice.  I threw everything in the Vitamix for a smooth mix.  I also topped with paprika and fresh cilantro.  Everyone raved about them! This will be a new staple I believe, especially come summer.

Followed the recipe, except I us d real bacon. Loved it, so did my guests. Very creamy, had a bit a kick to it with the hot sauce and the cayenne pepper. I didn't use jalape√±os, only because I didn't have any.

Great!! We went to a cookout and everyone loved this. I skipped the jalapenos, only because not everyone likes them. 
Thanks for sharing.
