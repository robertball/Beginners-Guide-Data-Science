I've made these several times and they are always devoured!  However, I have never used the maple extract (I just double the vanilla) and prefer milk chocolate over semi-sweet.  I think they taste just like Reese Cups.

The whole reason I wanted to make these was because last weekend I bought one at a speciality store and it was so good I wanted to make them for Christmas. So today I made them! I also doubled the vanilla and skipped the maple flavoring. They turned out exactly as I wanted them too and they didn't cost a dollar a pop! I melted down some PB chips and made squiggles on the top to make them extra pretty! This one is a keeper! No need to add anything extra - the dough will seem crumbly but when formed in balls it will be fine.

I liked the recipe but made a few changes,I added 1/2 Cup more peanut butter and used less maple extract (1/4 tsp) the peanut butter mixture was a little grainy instead of creamy so I added 1 tsp milk and warmed up slightly in microwave before rolling in balls and dipping in chocolate.

i was not that impressed with this...i mean for one i ran into some difficulties dipping as the batter would fall apart once i tried to dip, I had to research another recipe to realizee that you were supposed to roll into balls and refridgerate for a period of time...and then use a broiler to melt the chocolate so it stayed thinner....once I did this stuff and used toothpicks to help dip....IT BECAME SUPER EASY....I wish this recipe would've been more helpful for first timers who didn't know the things that may seem common sense to others...:)

I used maple syrup instead of maple extract. As stated in the recipe, you really need to knead the dough to get a nice consistancy. Also refrigerating balls before dipping in chocolate made it alot easier. had a hard time keeping them hidden till Christmas ;P

Wow!!! These were fantastic. My kids said they tasted like reeces peanut butter cups. Made a couple of changes, used 1 stick of butter, maple syrup, and 2 bags of milk chocolate chips. I don't have a double boiler so I put chips in microwave bowl with a tablespoon of shortening. Thanks this is definitely a keeper.

These little treasures were very good but I would leave out the maple flavoring completely next time.  I also added a tablespoon of melted parafin to the chocolate chips to give the balls that professional chocolatier sheen.

These are the best Peanut Butter Balls I have ever eaten!  The maple flavoring makes this recipe.  I have tried other recipes with out the maple flavoring and none can compare!

Ok was it just me or was 4 cups of confectioners sugar just way too much??? I only used 2 cups of confectioners sugar. Had I used the 4 cups I would've ended up with nothing but a crumby mess. 2 cups was more than enough and I was able to shape them into balls. These were good.. ya just have to change the recipe a bit.

This is exactly what I've been looking for. I've misplaced my recipe card for these and have made them for years at Christmastime. I knew the basic ingredients, but couldn't recall the measurements. This version is very basic and very similar to Reese Cups in taste.

I wasn't sure about the flavors, because  I'm not a huge maple fan, so the first batch I made was a 1/4 batch and I'm so happy I did that.  They were OK, but I didn't care for the maple flavoring at all.  So, I made them again and I did make some changes to the recipe.  I increased the peanut butter to 2 cups and used "honey roast" peanut butter, reduced confectioners sugar by one-half cup, omitted the maple, doubled the vanilla and dipped them in milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  This way they are very rich, but extremely delightful.   I made my version of these for a party and they were a huge hit.  I got about 60 balls from my batch and WHEN I do them again (because they are going in my Christmas goody boxes) I will make them a little smaller, because of how rich they are.  I highly recommend making these small, maybe a little larger than a marble.    I made these the day before and kept them in the fridge overnight.  These were even better the next day.   They tasted very much like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  For those that like a maple taste, these are probably great to you, so I don't want to take away from the recipe.  For me however, it doesn't work.  With the changes to fit my tastes, this is a 10 star recipe in my book.

They were good but I would change the peanut butter-sugar ratio, more peanut butter less sugar.

I used 3 cups of powered sugar instead of 4 and doubled the vanilla rather than using maple. I also used milk choc chips instead. They taste like peanut butter cups. My family loves them and they will be a Christmas tradition in our house. Thanks for the recipe. Yummy!!!!

These were great!  I definitely recommend not cutting out the maple flavoring.  I did have to add a little more peanut butter to give it a creamier texture.

Seems I had the same problem as some others - the peanut butter part was too dry to roll into bars as written.  I had to add 2 more tablespoons of butter, 1/4 cup more peanut butter and 3 tablespoons of milk to get the dough to come together.  Even then, it was dry and a little hard to get to hold together in balls, but I persisted.  After rolling, I refrigerated for several hours before dipping in both white and milk chocolate.  The dipping part was easy compared to the rolling part.  My kids had these for a party, and they loved them.  The filling just needs more moisture.

This is almost identical to my recipe but I don't use maple extract and I add 2 cup confectioners sugar and 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs.

Yum! I had a hard time getting the peanut butter, sugar and butter and other stuff to combine.  It was really crumbly. I needed to add some extra peanut butter (about 1/4 cup) and a little extra butter (2 tbsp) to even get it to start sticking together.  It could have been the brand of peanut butter.  I don't know.  I did eventually get it all to combine, and it tastes great.  I also added the maple flavor, and it is subtle, but tastes great.  That makes it a little different than the other recipes I've tried similar to this one.
I think I ended up making around 47 smaller balls because it is so rich and sweet, so that meant that I needed more chocolate.  I used about 1 3/4 bags of semi-sweet chocolate total.  I only melted the first bag to start so that it wouldn't harden as I worked. 
I look forward to making this again next year!

The recipe is good, but not excellent. It calls for 1/2 cut butter - 1 cup of butter seems to work better. It is a good recipe for the kids to make on a rainy day.

Guests enjoyed the maple flavor, but needed more peanut butter to mix all that sugar.  Use crunchy and less sugar would probably be better, added a little milk to melted chips for easier dipping.

I found these to be really sweet. I like maple flavoring in almost everything, but it didn't seem to work here for me. I made 1/2 recipe and got about 25 balls. I did miss the crunch of the ground graham crackers in a buckeye ball recipe I usually make. I also found the chocolate to be difficult to work with. I added a little butter and vegetable oil, which helped some. I was surprised the dipping chocolate did not have any fat to make it easier to dip. I put them in mini Christmas cup wrappers, as the chocolate melts easy. I decided to not add them to the Christmas tray, but I took them to a party and everyone ate them up. They didn't seem to care about the melty consistency of the chocolate or what I thought was very sweet overall.

they turned out really well.  I doubled the vanilla and didn't use the maple flavoring cus i think that sounded really gross.  next time I might use milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet, but i'm really happy with how they turned out and they are super easy.

These came out really good!  I added the powdered sugar a half cup at a  time, and ended up using 3 1/2 cups - and even then I was finding the dough hard to stick together.  So, I beat in 2 more tbsp of softened butter and it was much better to work with.  Only other change was to use maple syrup (Grade B) instead of the extract.  I think these would be great with just double vanilla and no maple, but I thought the maple did add a certain depth of flavor without making it at all "maple-y".  I do like these, but I have to admit I prefer the peanut butter bar filling with the graham cracker crumbs in it.  Still, these are tasty and will make a nice addition to my Christmas cookie platters!

I absolutely could not get the full 4 cups of sugar incorporated, so I got on "the Buzz" here on AE and asked what to do, (in a panic). I was told that if I had used natural peanut butter it would make a difference... IT DID! I used maybe 2 cups of powdered suger  and had to add a bit more peanut butter AND some warm milk to make it work-but they are SO good! I left out the maple because I was making maple balls too and wanted there to be a big difference, used vanila in it's place. I will make the balls half size next time because they are SO rich.

Turned out excellent! Only used 3 cups of sugar and it was super creamy.  I used almond bark in place of the chocolate chips.  After they cooled I drizzled white chocolate over the top.  Super good

These are just wonderful exactly the way they are directed to be made. I make these every year and they always get rave reviews. I noticed that alot of people are cutting out the maple extract! People, this is what makes this recipe so good. Don't cut out the maple, you won't regret it.

I liked the recipe but had to modify it quite a bit, I had to add a whole cup more of peanut butter for the balls to even be rolled without crumbling up and falling into the chocolate... it's a pain in the butt to be honest, if you have the time to mess with it, it's not so bad.

I added only 3 cups of powdered sugar and it still seemed a bit dry after kneading it so I added about 2 T. milk. Also, added 1 t. vanilla extract and 1 T. real maple syrup instead of the maple extract. For the Chocolate I used half milk and half semi-sweet chocolate with a T. of light corn syrup for shine! Next time I will try with 2.5 cups of sugar. Thanks for the base recipe!

I made these almost exacltely how it was written. I only used 3 1/2 cups of teh sugar....while they are still naked little balls in the fridge, the peanaut butter part is WONDERFUL I mixedit al lwith a hand mixer and then kneaded with my hand to get it all together. I also kneaded alittle in my hand before rolling into balls. The texture is creamy and delish! cant wait to taste them with the chocolate on them. Also I got 45 ball out of it using a small cookie scoop. One more thing, with the maple flavoring they taste a little like the peanut butter the schools would give you at lunch time with a yeast roll, anyone remeber that? YUMMO!

Wow, it did sound good, however, these were way too sweet for me, and I cut back on the confectioners sugar.  Sorry, won't be making these again.

Made these like the recipe, but kept all vanilla instead of maple and used milk chocolate chips instead.  VERY YUMMY!
These freeze well and I sneak one when no one is looking :)  They are very sweet, maybe a little sweeter than the Reese's PB cups.  I think I would try it next time with a little less sugar to see if the peanut butter taste can be a little stronger.  THESE ARE SUPER EASY AND SUPER YUMMY!!!

I made these yesterday and had to add a half cup more peanut butter because it was too crumbly.
I also added a tablespoon of shortening to the choc. chips. They turned out good. Overall pretty quick and easy to make. I like that you can decorate them for different occasions. I added colored sprinkles and some jimmies on top fo xmas, Look so pretty. Will try these again.

Too much powdered sugar! Recommend starting out with half as much, and adding more till you get the consistency needed. Also safer to melt coating on stove not microwave

These were amazing!  They were easy to make and everyone loved them.  I used maple syrup rather than extract, and I wound up needing more than 2 cups of chocolate.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Leave out the maple extract and they taste EXACTLY like a Reese's peanut butter cup. I couldn't figure out how to roll the balls in melted chocolate without burning myself so I just drizzled it over one side, set the cookie sheet outside for an hour or so (it's cold enough here) and then turned them over and drizzled the other side, so they were coated. I added some shortening (about 1-2Tbls) to the choc, it helps it spread easier. I again repeat, leave out the maple extract and these are fab.

Good, but I add a cup of rice krispies to the peanut butter for a nice little crunch. I make hundreds of these each year to give away.Yes, be sure and refrigerate the balls before you dip and I tend to use two spoons rather than a toothpick.

I prepared this exactly as called for and was surprised when they tasted better than Reese Cups which I love. The Maple is not overpowering as other commenter have said.

Okay, well these were A-M-A-ZING! The Maple really made them too. However, When I mixed it all up, it was so dry I couldn't do anything with it and it also tasted like it needed something. Turns out that something was butter! I added an additional 3/4 c. of butter. It got rid of the dryness and gave it a melt in your mouth consistency. SO GOOD! Though, with the maple in the recipe, it really does change the taste a lot. I think these probably should be named "Maple Peanut Butter Balls" Because the original title is misleading. Yes, these were fantastic, but if you are really looking for that rich peanut butter flavor, I suggest leaving out the maple. With it in, there is definitely a strong peanut butter flavor, but the maple is also strong. I will absolutely be making these again though. Maybe next time with dark chocolate........ ;)

These were good. I thought they were a little dry and I had a hard time pressing the balls together. The chocolate was very melty when using your fingers to eat them. Next time I think I will use choc almond bark instead and maybe a little less powdered sugar. Still they were good, not awesome, but good.

As others said do not put 4c of sugar. That will be way too much. I only used about 2.5c and I also used 3/4 stick of butter. I also omitted the maple extract.

I chose this recipe for my peanut butter balls, after I added the butter and peanut butter & flavoring and mixed together, I added a cup of powdered sugar, I just dipped a 1 cup measuring cup into the bag of powdered sugar and leveled it, poured it in and mixed, but it absorbed all the moisture from the peanut butter and the butter.  I warmed it for 30 seconds in the microwave and attempted to incorporate another cup of powdered sugar and could not get it all absorbed so I added the rest of the 16.3 oz. jar of Peter Pan creamy peanut butter and about 3 tablespoons of corn syrup and was able to incorporate the rest of the sugar to make a dough that was not too stiff but held together.  It is now chilling until I can roll it into balls. After tasting is plenty sweet.  I didn't want to stiff a dough because after encasing in the chocolate and I want it to be soft and creamy when you bite into it.

We in Ohio call these Buckeyes! The only difference is that we don't dip them completely in chocolate. We leave a little of the Peanut Butter showing, thus they look like the nut-Buckeye! 
I've never had them made with Maple flavoring with the Vanilla! Sounds even better!!
This is a GREAT recipe. A variation would be to use Cashew Butter. (I don't know that I would  use the Maple!) I've had them made with it & they are fantastic!!

My second review on these! I have made them a few times and they don't last long. This time, I melted a package of milk chocolate chips in the microwave, and I added about 4 TB butter when I melted the cc; stirred that together, then added 2 TB of milk and stirred it well for the dipping. So good. :D

I made these for a church get together and everyone loved them. Definitely don't skip the maple flavoring. It made them unique, and gave them a great flavor. I put them in the freezer for a while before dipping them in chocolate.

Everyone LOVED them! At first the filling was really dry - I had to add another 1/4 cup of butter for them to work. I also drizzled white chocolate over the top, but when i melted the white chocolate morsels, it clumped together. I then tried bakers white chocolate and it was perfect.

This recipe is great. Peanut-buttery deliciousness! No need for wax as some other recipes call for. I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate (bittersweet) instead of semi-sweet chips. I think the dark chocolate adds a nice touch to the taste. I melted down some peanut butter chips (or butterscotch chips are fine) and piped a squiggly design on the top of each one which not only looked nice but signified that these were peanut butter, so the people allergic could beware. Great recipe!

I have made these in the past, minus the maple flavoring and I have always loved them.  I decided to use the maple and decided it was a good addition.  I know I didn't use the amount of powdered sugar it called for, I kind of eye balled it.  I rolled these and threw them in the freezer for a few hours.  I dipped them in milk chocolate, then drizzled them with butterscotch chips.  I thought it would give a "Special K bar" flavor since the topping on those bars are choco chips and butterscotch chips.  They turned out lovely and tasted awesome.

this is a great recipe. I've tried a few before but it never turned out the way i wanted. The maple in this is wonderful and the best part so says my husband! This was easy and  it made about  7 dozen balls. I drizzled in chocolate. Yummy!

These were DELICIOUS!!! I needed 2 bags of chocolate chips and used a little cream as suggested by other people.  I took a little of the peanut butter mixture out at a time and kneaded it, making it a smoother consistency.  YUMMY

This is a good twist on the traditional peanut butter balls. They take a LOT of time to make because of all the individual attention each ball needs.

The dough is very simple to make and tastes wonderful. I seemed to need more than 2 cups of chips to coat all the balls, but I think that is because I am a rookie at dipping in chocolate.  I followed the recipe exactly, without alteration.

These turned out fantastic.  I did find that after 3 cups of confectioners sugar the mixture was too crumbly to form balls so I added another 1/8 cup of peanut butter and left out the remaining sugar.  I could hardly keep hands off them to get them dipped.

These are yummy.  I didn't use maple (don't like the flavor) and I didn't even dip them in chocolate.  I did add more butter, used 1/2 c total. Couldn't roll into a ball, just smash crumbs into a ball.  Yummy anyway.  Thanks.

I thought this recipe was really good.  The filling was very dry/crumbly.  I made two batches and the first batch I just used a melon baller to scoop up the filling.  I would dump it in my hand and dig deep for patience to sit there and somewhat mold it and shape it into a ball.  I then made my second batch of filling.  I melted a couple extra tablespoons of butter and added to the filling and that was sooo much better.  That's all it needed.  I didn't refrigerate the peanut butter balls before I coated them in chocolate and I didn't have any problems keeping them together either.  But I did pack them pretty tight when I shaped them.  So that might be why.  I also thought they were very sweet.  But I've had so many sweet things lately, and everything is just tasting overly sweet.  My son and husband assured me though that they were perfect. And, I don't a double broiler, you don't need one.  But not using one results in much thicker chocolate therefore making it a little harder to coat.  I will make these again, probably for New Years b/c they are a big hit!

Good, but not perfect. If you cut down the confectioners sugar to 3 cups, adding and mixing 1 cup in at a time it makes for the perfect texture and sweetness. Adding a bit of fat to the chocolate also helps with dipping. Try a tbsp of butter, oil or coconut oil. I also make these into peanut butter snowballs quite easily by dipping in icing sugar frosting and tossing in coconut flakes.

Followed the recipe as directed, but it was too grainy during the mix up part of peanut butter, powered sugar....etc. I hope I didn't ruin all my ingredients trying to make this! What did it mean by knead well? I haven't had to knead any of my candy recipes. After adding extra peanut butter, and increasing the butter to another four tablespoons, it still isn't right. 
I have made these for years, and never had any problems with MY recipe. I am going to not have peanut butter candy this year!

Had a really hard time mixing it all and kneading it together. It was really flaky with the amount of sugar vs the amount of peanut butter. It gets the 3 stars because I was able to make some good peanut butter balls via this recipe, but I had to add a LOT more peanut butter in order to get it to not be flaky at all and for the balls to stay together. Good recipe in theory, but needs less sugar and more peanut butter next time.

from reviews left out the maple flavoring. I would recommend you sift your conf. sugar to avoid white lumps in your finished treat. I also add a pc of parafin wax to the chocolate to give them a sheen and doesn't affect the chocolate taste at all. A great time to use those chocolate bunnies left over from Easter to melt down for dipping. thanks for sharing

Super good and easy. I only used 3 cups of sugar. Next time I think I'll do even less. It was hard to make the balls and have them stick together.

I made these last night, and they are truly delicious.  I read many of the reviews, so I was prepared to make one adjustment to the recipe as written:  I used 3 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 4.  The mixture held together perfectly, it was not crumbly at all.  My suggestions have more to do with procedure.  I wore vinyl gloves and combined everything by hand to get a smooth texture.  Next time I would sift the sugar, because it was forming small lumps that took a lot of time to press out.  I don't know if others used an electric mixer, but the recipe didn't specify that so I didn't use it.   The maple extract was not available in stores, so I ordered it online, through Amazon.  It was actually 'imitation maple extract', because true maple extract is nonexistent as far as I could tell!  You can taste it in a subtle way, so it was worth the extra effort to get it.  However, I think that this recipe would be successful even without it.

Way too sweet. 4 cups of powdered sugar?? I was afraid if I deviated they wouldn't hold together so I followed as is. I will give them to the nieces and nephews who like really sweet desserts but not even sure if they will like them. Also it's just messy and tedious to dip in chocolate. The Reese's peanut butter cup cookies I made were way better.

Almost panicked when I made these!  Four cups confectioner sugar is WAY too much!  They were so dry, they wouldn't hold together, so I doubled the margarine AND the peanut butter which saved them.  I made these last night for a Christmas dinner today at my church.  I also added 1 T. paraffin wax (or 2 T. shortening will do) so the chocolate would be easier to dip the balls in. Left the maple syrup out. They ended up turning out perfect after the adjustments I made.

This was a good recipe, except it calls for too much powdered sugar!! So if I were you I would split the powdered sugar in half and then if you need more you can always add more. I also didn't have maple extract so I used maple syrup instead and it worked just fine :) Other than that these were delicious and I used them for a thanksgiving bake sale to raise money for my study abroad trip :)

I don't know how you were able to make the balls. It was very crumbly. I ended up only using 3 1/2 cups of powered sugar and added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Was able to rolls balls perfectly after that. I also dipped in chocolate and white chocolate. Was very good.

Loved them! I could have eaten the whole tray! So simple to make and everyone enjoyed them! Don't worry if you don't have any maple extract, increase the vanilla and they will taste just as great!

Awesomely easy = awesomely good. I have been making these for Christmas for several years now. They are always a hit. A few tweaks over the years, 1/2 tsp maple extract and 1/2 tsp corn syrup. Also back off to about 2-1/2 C to 3 C confectioner sugar. Also add 1 tsp of shortening to melted chocolate in double boiler. I roll the balls then pop them in the freezer for about an hour, makes dipping much easier. Love to pipe with melted peanut butter chips for finished look. Tried hiding mini marshmallow in the center of some this year, we'll see how that goes!

They were very delicious! I added coffee chocolate chips instead of regular. It really hit the spot! I highly reccomend these for special occasions. For an example, when you have guests over. Or just make them as a group activity!

Absolutely yummy!  The maple flavor is a nice addition which reminds me of maple nut goodies.  I used maple syrup because I didn't find any maple extract in the store.  The consistency of the peanut butter mixture was a bit crumbly and I found it harder to form the balls, but it was perfect for the finished product.  I tried a different recipe the last time that I made them and they were too gooey.  I'll try leaving out 1/2 cup of the 10x sugar next time...and I will definitely be making these again!!  I had Ghirardelli's white and double chocolate on hand, so I used both.  I had the bright idea of adding some maple flavoring to the white chocolate, that did not work out at all.  It had some type of reaction and the melted chocolate became a thick paste immediately.

These were great! The only change I made is instead of balls we made bars.  I spread the dough in a buttered 9 x 13 pan then let them set.  Came back and melted the chips in a pan on low heat then spread the chocolate on top. Yum, my girls love the bars.

Rolling the dough for these was a bit more challenging than I anticipated because it was crumbly but got the hang of it.  I would highly suggest adding 1+Tablespoon of shortening when you melt choc chips, my first round did not melt well & I had to run out for another bag of chips but with shortening added it worked beautifully.

It is a good, simple recipe. I made it with real peanut butter, real butter,  semi-sweet bakers chocolate bars and 2 tsp of vanilla extract.

I made these to pass out to family, friends, and coworkers. These are the BEST that I've ever made. Once I convinced everyone that I didn't buy them they wanted the recipe. They have a very smooth and rich texture. The maple flavoring gives them the extra something special.

Wanted to taste the difference with the maple extract and loved it!  The only things I changed was since I love the rice krispies in my balls to add a crunchier texture, I upped the peanut butter to 2 cups, 1/2 cup butter and used half semisweet and half milk chocolate chips. Can't wait to watch them fly off the platter at our church party tonight!

For my taste these peanut butter balls were just too sweet, and I did cut the icing sugar down by about 1/2 cup or so.  The balls came together fairly easily and some of my guests enjoyed them, but I don't think I would make them again.

Fan-freakin-tastic!!!  I did make a few changes though. (1) I also omitted the maple flavoring and insteada added an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla (2) I chilled the balls after I rolled them for about an hour. This made it easier to dip (3) I only dipped 1/2 the ball in chocolate instead of covering the whole thing.   Next time, I would definitly use milk chocolat instead of semisweet.

These tasted great but were a pain to make - the dough was very crumbly and though it was easy enough to shape into balls after kneading they crumbled as soon as I took a bite. The chocolate dipping was a disaster for me but I'm a novice so I'm sure next time will be easier :) I used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. Next time I will add more peanut butter to the dough to make it hold together. Thanks - I'll try these again sometime with the changes I mentioned!

These are great! I followed the recipe minus the maple and doubled the vanilla. Rolling did not work well but just forming them with my hands held the shap!  Also I just melted the choc chips in the microwave and poured melted choc into a zip lock baggie cut the corners and iced the tops only with the chocolate. Very yummy and super fast! Thank you!!

I made these with my 4 yo son.  He said they were soooo good they didn't need any chocolate.  I didn't have any maple flavoring so I doubled the vanilla and we ate them without the chocolate coating.  Super easy and super good.  This is a keeper.

Just love this recipe! I leave out the maple extract and double the vanilla. Kids and husband love these. Very good. I lost my recipe when my house burnt so I got this one from here. I love them so does everyone else. Thanks!!

I eliminated the maple extract flavoring and only used the vanilla extract in the cookie dough and then a little bit of almond extract in the melted dipping semi-sweet chocolate. They were delicious!

Awesome.  I changed the servings to five and whipped this up in a few minutes.  They are delicious.  I admit, I needed a little chocolate therapy.  This did the trick.  And I still have some left - a miracle.  I will definitely make these again.

I've made choc balls for years,  never a disappointment, my other recipe is not as crumble, but kneaded and came out great. the one thing I do for a more shinny ball, by melting a little bit of wax in the choc, also helps with the  choc staying on the balls.

Made these babies so many different ways over the years. Whether you like them more creamy, using more peanut butter. Or less, with more confec. sugar. My household and family have come to expect these as gifts & be out at gatherings for holidays. Definitely a tradition now.

These are awesome and a gift request  from so many family members, it takes me all day to make and roll these balls, but they are so worth it, they say better than reeses. I don't use the maple and they're still fine. I use fondue pot to keep chocolate warm.

We have been making these for over 40 years and I got the recipe from my Mother-in-Law. We don't use any extract at all. We do add 3 - 4 cups of Rice Krispies. That gives them a nice crunch!

I cut back to 2 cups of powdered sugar and did not use the maple extract. I also used dark chocolate as that is a preference by my people :) They turned out great, not to sweet. Have made them a couple times.

WAAAAAYYYYYY too much confectioner's sugar in this recipe! 4 cups is overkill and does not work. Compare to the hundreds of others online and you will see most use one cup or at most, two. We had to add more peanut butter and butter in order for the dough to stick together.

I liked them very much and they looked really nice when done. I learned a few things along the way..... at first my dough was too crumbly, I added a half a tablespoon more softened butter and wa la! It was perfect for making into a ball. (it was not to moist either).  The next thing I learned was to put the dipped balls onto parchment paper on a plate and into the fridge to harden, as they stuck to the plate without the paper.  Lastly I liked the idea of placing each finished and decorated ball into a mini cupcake wrapper. But some of my balls were a bit big, so I learned to make them smaller. They were delish! Very attractive.  This round I didn't have maple flavor so used 2 tabs of the vanilla.

Great Easy Recipe, made minor changes and included some of the suggestions found here. Doubled the Vanilla no Maple, Used 3 1/4 Cups of Confectioner Sugar,  1/3 cup of butter, 1 3/4 Cups of Luara Scudders Nutty Peanut butter Old Fashion at room temperature and mixed with hand mixer til completely mixed then dumped all out on a cookie sheet and started folding together  in to tight balls. It was easy to squeeze mixture in hand and then form into 1" size balls placed on another cookie sheet with wax paper on it and refrigerated all for about an hour. Used toothpick to dip in the heated chocolate used a double boiler then put back in refer. 
Peanut Butter Balls of Perfection. :)

I've made peanut butter balls every Christmas for years and thought that I would try something different this year. I halved the recipe and didn't add the maple extract as I thought that it wasn't needed. Half of the recipe yielded 25 balls. After rolling the first 15 I decided that they would be better with something crunchy so I added 1/4 cup of  Hershey Chipits®  toffee bits.
I made this for the Canadian Allstar Christmas Baking Challenge. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I love making these for the holidays or any occasion... it was inspired by a nice woman named Karen. The one thing I use to make my peanut butter balls with the chocolate to hold together is using a product called "gulf wax" right in the canning jar area at ralphs or walmart.  I mix it along with the semi-chocolate chips in a double broiler pan on low heat . when it cools off... I dip them and put them back in the fridge to form.  Trust me it makes a big difference

Very easy to make...and SOOOOOOO yummy!  I use different sprinkles, jimmies, etc...to coordinate with a holiday or celebration.  Makes a great little hostess gift or bake sale/fundraiser item.  You can get the kids involved, too, with the "fun" of rolling them and decorating them.

These were easy and huge hit! I used honey peanut butter and added a little more butter than the recipe called for. I had a hard time covering the whole ball in the semi-sweet chocolate, as the chocolate wasn't thin enough so I just dipped the bottoms.

I spoofed the recipe a little and made a peanut butter cookie dough of sorts to be eaten raw. I added 1/8-1/4 cup of water (1/4 cup was a bit too much) and it turned out pretty good.

I think an important point has been left our of this recipe.  Sift your powdered sugar before measuring.  For those of you who are having issues with your dough being too dry or crumbly, this should solve your problem.

perfect consistency, I was missing a few ingredients but it worked out and tastes great. I only had a little over 1 cup of peanut butter then I only had 2.5 cups of powdered sugar. kneaded by hand. put the butter and syrups first then peanut butter and powder last. crowd pleaser, best no bake recipe i have tried so far. one time i used sunflower butter instead of peanut butter. delicious

These did not work out for me. The inside is too dry. I added another 1/2 c peanut butter, but that didn't help much. Maybe I did something wrong, but perhaps more fat (butter, 1 cup more of peanut butter, something) would help the inside.

I love this recipe.  I do leave out the maple extract though because I don't think it's needed.  Another quick tip that makes dipping much easier is to insert a toothpick into the balls then freeze for a little while.  Then dip into the chocolate.  Toothpick slides right out after dipping.

Chilling the undipped balls is important prior to coating them. For a failsafe chocolate coating melt 2 T of shortening in a microwave safe bowl.  Add chips and stir, mixing well.  Microwave 1 minute and stir well.  Microwave 30 seconds and stir, and repeat until mixture is smooth.

These are very easy and delicious. Extremely sweet! But my hubby and kids devoured them. I did not use maple flavoring I just doubled up on vanilla like another reviewer stated. I am very glad I didn't use the maple as these actually tasted just like Reeses. This will be a new holiday treat.

Makes a massive amount (5 dozen). Relatively easy to make. Best after refrigerating for some time. The chocolate-covering process is messy, and the chocolate must be kept hot. Make sure not to refrigerate close together, or else they stick, and chocolate will come off. I will try milk chocolate chips and a little more peanut butter next time. They are extremely sweet.

This is a great recipe!! I used this for a New Year's party and it turned out delicious! I was a little afraid of how much sugar it took and it took a while to mix but it worked out.

The peanut butter mixture was difficult to roll into balls because the mixture was too dry. The taste was excellent besides the dryness. Next time I make these I will only use about 2.5 cups of confectioners sugar rather than the 4 that the recipe calls for. Also, it is very helpful to refrigerate the balls for atleast an hour before you try to dip them in the melted chocolate. I like dark chocolate so I liked the semi sweet morsels, but next time I will probably use milk chocolate morsels.

My husband and I made these and when it says to knead well that's exactly what you have to do! He kneaded it to make it the right consistency and I rolled and dipped them. They are really good. I did not have to refrigerate and wait to dip. I rolled and dipped as he kneaded... They are really good and worth the effort.

I don't keep maple extract, so I used pure maple syrup. Not corn syrup maple "flavored" syrup. I wanted to use crunchy pb, but I did not have enough so I mixed creamy & crunchy.  I used the 2 cups of semi-sweet and ran out. So I ended up melting Hershey kisses in double boiler over low heat. I put the pb mix in fridge for a bit to make it easier to handle.  I ended up w/ decent looking pieces. I used color sprinkles to "hide" some less than perfect looking areas.  Next time I will plan for better chocolate usage. Milk or semi-sweet both work well.

I replaced chocolate with almond bark and it's still so yummy. Also as gifts I'll replace the vanilla with rum or a creamy liquor and they are amazing!

I do not like fake flavors or smells.  I cut the maple extract back because of other's comments and it was still the dominant smell and flavor.

This was easy to make. It can get a little messy. I should've read the reviews before I made them. The next time I make this I will ensure I have a big function to go to. With the batter I had, it was way too much and it took my kids a long time to finish eating them. It was very tasty.

The peanut butter part was too dry for my granddaughters (7 and 4 1/2) to work with.  We had to play with adding more vanilla, peanut butter and even a little water.  Finally workable.  The chocolate was terrible to work with.  Much too thick.  I would try another recipe next time.

I'm thinking this recipe may be missing something like milk or heavy cream.  It was very dry and didn't work well.  I added some heavy whipping cream and it was much easier to work with.  It tasted good before the cream, but there was no way I could make the bon bons without adding some kind of liquid.
