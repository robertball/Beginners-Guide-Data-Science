WARNING...WARNING...WARNING...
The 1/2 cup of oil is listed at the very bottom of the recipe along with the glaze ingredients. I didn't see it until it was too late (In the future I will remember to read the directions THOROUGHLY). It's currently in the oven. Smells great but...

WARNING UPDATE...

The cake was done 10 minutes early. It tasted perfectly wonderful even without the oil. I'm guessing the normal product had a heavier consistency. So, I guess I saved some calories!

This recipe has been around forever and my family has been enjoying it for many years.  It is the BEST and easiest you will ever find.  I recommend leaving the cake to slightly cool in the pan, then pricking it with a fork and pouring the glaze over it while still in the pan.  You will have to be patient as the glaze slowly absorbs into the cake but it will make for the most delectable treat when it is all done.  Let it cool completely after the glaze has been poured over, run a butter knife around the edges and invert onto a doily covered plate.  Sprinkle generously with powdered sugar and the savor the moistest, incredibly buttery sweet, scrumptious rum cake on the planet!

This is the same recipe my aunt gave me, but the cooking directions are different.  Try boiling all glaze ingredients for a minute...then pour the hot glaze over the cake when it comes out of the oven (go slowly).  Allow to cool for 30 minutes, and then turn onto serving plate.  Every time I make this cake, it's gone in no time!  YUM!!!

This is an excellent cake I've followed just the recipe and it was great.  I've also adapted it somewhat and it came out great by adding crushed pineapple and substituting coconut milk for the water.  I also sprinkled pecans and coconut on the bottom instead of walnuts.  The cake reminded you of  a pina colada got many many reviews at work for the cake.

This is now my signature dessert. since I'm a college student, I use a regular cake pan or make cupcakes. I use butterscotch pudding, yellow cake (although the funfetti is neat too) and a cup of Captain Morgan (instead of 1/2 c water and 1/2 c rum). Instead of a glaze, grab a jar of caramel-butterscotch ice cream topping (room temp) and pours a bit on the top of the batter in the pan. Then, take a knife and drag it around the pan to make a tasty caramel swirl in the cake!

Very good recipe!!  When I first tasted this cake at a friend's, I had thought the rum taste was too strong.  When I made the glaze, I added most of the rum with the butter and sugar, and then added the rest after I had boiled it for the 5 minutes.  The glaze still tasted like rum, but it didn't have the strong alcohol flavour.

I made this recipe for my husband's birthday.  I added powdered sugar to the icing to thicken it up.  Also used chocolate fudge cake mix.  My mother and father-in-law called me 3x after the event to rave about the cake!

We all enjoyed this cake.  The top becomes slightly crispy, the nuts caramelize, and the glad is not overpowering.  

Suggestions: Burn off the alcohol in the glad by lighting  with a long lighter.  The first time I tried this, it tasted of alcohol so badly, none could eat it.  Also, this baked perfectly (golden brown) in only 40 minutes, not a full 60 minutes.  I also used a butter pecan cake mix the second time and it was worlds better!

My mom has been making this cake since the 60's.  It gets rave reviews every time she makes it!  I made it for my boss's birthday today and there's not a crumb left.  This is one of the best cake recipes ever!

I lived in the Cayman Island for many years. My cake was very close if not the same like the famous Cayman Tortuga Rum Cake.  I made some changes to the cake and it turned out great, moist, delicious, yummy and my entire family and co- workers crave for more. CHANGES: I use 3 full eggs and 1 egg white, I used Duncan Hines cake mix, sugar free Vanilla Pudding Mix, I added 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup cold buttermilk and omit the water, 1/2 stick smart balance butter, 2 1/2 teaspoon McCormick vanilla butter nut extract (this extract takes away the box cake taste and leave a buttery nutty taste), I sifted the cake mix with the vanilla pudding mix, I use an electric mixer and mix the eggs and butter together. I use 3/4 cup barcardi gold rum in the cake batter. For the Glaze > I use 3/4 cup of Bacardi gold and myers rum together, use only 2 tsp water and make the sugar melt to liquid then add butter and then rum mix,  remove cake when slightly cool, remove from pan then put about 4 tablespoon of glaze in the bottom of the pan, then put the cake back in the pan. Put small holes in the cake and use the glaze as hot as possible on the cake, when cake is fully cool then wrap cake in cling wrap air tight then foil wrap, let sit for few days to age. I also did Chocolate Rum Cake with same adjustments but use Myers Dark Rum. I added 1 & 3/4 tablespoon unsweeted cocoa powder to the batter mix with sugar free chocolate pudding mix. The cake was not sweet because the of the sour cream.

My family came to visit and six people finished the cake in one day. Had to make another one for the next day.  Fantastic and always enjoyed by all.  I  put some batter into the pan then put nuts on top of the batter.  I find that the nuts burn when they are on the bottom of the pan. I tried to make a different version with Coconut rum and mix shredded coconut into the batter.  WOW! it was great.  I have also used ground almonds instead of the walnuts and it still is wonderful.  It is hard to mess up this receipe.  I will make it for all my dinners and nobody complains but raves everytime.  A real keeper.

This is absolutely to die for!  I like pecans better than using walnuts and I used Captain Morgans original spiced run.  Next time I think I'll take the advise from someone and before removed the cake from the pan, to poke holes and pour half the glaze on and then remove the cake and pour the remaining glaze over the cake.  I used long wooden kebob skewers to poke the holes and it worked out great.   The glaze is what makes this cake!

I followed the recipe to a tee the first time around and liked it overall, but after trying it a second time with a few alterations to the glaze, it was MAGNIFICENT!  I increased the water to 1/4 cup and increased the rum to 1/3 cup to make it a little stronger and more "liquidy".  I poked the cake all over (many times) with a wooden skewer, then VERY SLOWLY poured the glaze over the top and sides.  Whatever glaze ended up on the bottom of the dish, I took a turkey baster and kept sucking it up and re-pouring over the top of the cake.  I did this until no glaze was left over.  THIS MADE A MAJOR DIFFERENCE - the cake was much more flavorful and moist.  It was a hit at the party!

OMG!  Awesome!!!!  A huge hit with the guests but even more importantly, with me!  This is exactly what I've been craving for 2+ years.  By the way, kisses to the person who suggested using bannana pudding instead of vanilla -- AWESOME!  And go for the xtra expense of pecans -- of so good!  I added my to the batter, as well.  PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT

Delicious for the holidays.  I made it as written -- just made a couple substitutions with what I had on hand.  I used pecans and cashews instead of walnuts, and coconut cream pudding instead of vanilla.  I used a dark rum from Trinidad.  Turned out moist and delicious!

I spent a long time looking for the best tasting, and the fastest to make rum cake. I must have tried about three or four different kinds of recipes, but it wasn't until I found (and made!) your recipe that I decided to keep it and pass it on to my family and friends. When thay ask me if the recipe is mine, I wish soooo badly that I could take the creidet for it, but I can't. I just tell them I got it off of the internet! 
          How on earth did you coem up with this recipe??
                      -Thank you!

This is literally the best recipe...ever.
Absolutely delicious.
...Irresistable!

I only made one change.
I added an exsquisit chocolate frosting with the rum glaze. 

This is the recipe for the chocolate frosting:
1/4 cup butter
1.5 squares unsweeted chocolate
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup milk
2 cups confectioners' (powdered) sugar
1/4 cup powdered cocoa

DIRECTIONS

1. Melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave or in the top of a double boiler. In a large bowl, combine sugar, vanilla, and half of the milk. Blend in the melted chocolate mixture. Add remaining milk, a little at a time, until desired consisteny achieved.

The frosting is a bit more glaze-like then frosting but when it cools it is incredibly deluctable.

Extremely moist and tasty! I made no changes to the recipe as written. Note: this is exactly the same as the 'Golden Rum Cake' on this site, but with different measurements for the glaze.  I did not notice any real differences either.

So easy and so good! I can't believe that this used a mix! I used light rum (all I had) and this turned out just fine! I used a skewer and poked holes in the cake while it was still in the pan and poured half of the glaze over; then, I turned cake over on plate, poked holes and poured the other half of glaze. Hubby loves it and pronounced it a 5!!! Thank you.

This recipe is good as is, but it is GREAT with a couple small changes. I use a larger box of pudding mix, omit the water and add about 3/4 cup sour cream you can also either up your rum (in cake) by just a little or the oil. Makes for a super moist (and rich!) cake.

Super delish and easy recipe, though I made some adjustments because I didn't have all the proper tools/ingredients.  I'm in very humid weather and maybe this had something to do with how liquidy the batter was.  Or maybe it was the eggs.  I used 4 eggs and only did 3 oz (less than half a cup) of dark rum, and veggie oil.  As suggested in an another review, I substituted the water with coconut milk (for both the batter and glaze), using 3 oz as well.  The package of instant vanilla pudding was also less than 3.5 oz.  I only had a small glass casserole dish and baked it for only about 30 minutes.  I omitted the nuts.  For the glaze, I used coconut milk and put a dash of water in, and used more than half a cup of sugar, as it got too liquidy after adding the rum.  THE CAKE TURNED OUT DELICIOUS and I'm convinced it's hard to mess up this recipe.  It allows room for modifications.  Great recipe!

Easy to make.  Cooked in a bundt pan about 45 min not 60 as listed in directions.  Was not as moist or flavorful as I would wish, if I was to make again I would use a flavored cake mix instead maybe a butter pecan as some one else suggested.

This was an easy recipe to do, however the batter needs to rest overnight for the rum to flavor the cake. I refrigerated the batter and the next day baked it off and the cake came out good and the flavor of the rum was in the cake.

This recipe was delicious!! I didn't have the vanilla pudding mix so I used pistachio flavor instead and it gave it a nice hit of green color and outstanding taste! I will make this many more times to come!!

I've been making this cake for several years now and I am rating it 5 stars as written. It's always a hit in my house! I usually use Appleton Rum that I've purchased in the Carribean or at the Duty Free store while visiting Canada. A couple of other fun twists are to change the pudding flavor, to whatever you might dare to try. Chocolate pudding is good in it, and another of our favorites is to use bananna pudding and a coconut falvored rum! That one gives it a slightly tropical flavor.  Love this recipe! It's super easy!

I made this for New Years Eve, and my boyfriend and I loved it! It was really moist, and did have a rum flavor that wasn't overpowering like other rum cakes that I have tried. The only thing I changed was substituting the oil for unsweetened applesauce. Loved it! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Absolutely incredible! Took some advice and poked small holes all over the cake before pouring on the glaze. It just soaked it up and was so moist! Best rum cake I've had and very easy to make!

I made this cake on Saturday thinking I could take most of it to a Father's Day celebration on Sunday.  No such luck!  My husband ate half the cake in 1 day.  I gave a slice to a friend and to my mom.  They both left me phone messages about how delicious the cake was.  An extremely easy recipe that turns out very moist and flavorful!!!  I left the cake to cool in the pan then poked holes in it and poured the glaze over it to absorb while still in the pan.  Also, I found no need to burn off the alcohol as other reviewers suggested.  The flavoring was perfect.  It is rum cake and should taste rummy.

Excellent taste! Super easy! An absolute must! I made it for a Superbowl party and they just loved it! I am going to try the other variations that other Members have suggested. But go ahead and try this, you won't be disappointed - just remember it's a Rum Cake - it will take like Rum!!!!!  Yummmmm!

Super easy cake to make.  I used light rum and it turned out so moist and delicious.  I also used butter instead of oil in the batter and it was divine.  I took it to a camping party and it was devoured in no time!

It takes less than 5 minutes to mix together and throw it in the oven. Accidentally, I used instant strawberry pudding mix, but the outcome was fantastic! I added a dash of cinnamon to the top of the cake because I (correctly) assumed that the combination of rum, strawberry and cinnamon would be to die for. 

After 35 minutes (I did a 1/2 portion of the recipe), take it out and let it cool. Then add the all-important glaze which makes this simple cake so decadent and scrumptious. How could anyone complain? It's the perfect recipe to throw together when you've forgotten to make that dessert you promised to make for a party.

Dangerously delicious!! Super moist. Follow the directions and make NO changes. This is what you call perfection. *I used malibu coconut rum. YUM! Oh one slight change i will make next time...top the batter with the walnuts instead of sprinkling on the bottom just because i think it will look prettier. i photographed the top of my cake because it looked nicer but walnuts were on the bottom. :(

One word: DEVINE. I used what I had on hand: pecans instead of walnuts, butter recipe yellow cake mix, and Captain instead of Meyer's, and it was so easy and so good. I do have a trick when its time to butter and flour the pan: I use real butter and WHITE SUGAR to "flour" the pan instead of flour. This creates a wonderful crispy sweet shiny glaze on the outside of the cake. A neighbor even stopped by to ask what I was baking because it smelled so good! I leveled the bottom of the cake with a knife and poured the glaze onto the exposed part while it was still warm. Leveling off the top makes a more even cake when it's inverted, and the glaze soaks into the cake very well this way.

My husband loves rum cake.  I had made other rum cakes in the past and none was better than this one!!  It is better when aged on 2nd or 3rd day.  I will definitely make this cake again.  I followed the recommendations of other reviews and used chopped pecans instead of walnut.  I used 1/2 white rum and 1/2 Malibu rum. I did not have trouble with runny glaze but I allowed the glaze to cook for more than 5 min till it firmed up a bit but not till soft ball stage.  I was afraid of too strong of alcohol flavor that I pour about 1/4 cup of rum into the glaze and let it cook for 10 seconds, then I took it off the stove and pour the rest of the rum into the glaze.  I poke holes with a wooden chopstick to make the holes larger.  I used a tablespoon to slowly pour the syrup into the holes and around the edges of the bundt pan.  I let the cake rest in the bundt pan overnight and flipped it over the next morning.  It was delicious!!  Thank you Mariann for this yummy recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe. Another great option for anyone who likes spice cake is to substitute carrot or spice cake for yellow cake mix, spiced rum for regular rum, brown sugar for white sugar in the glaze and (no kidding) pistachio pudding instead of vanilla. All this spice may be a little too intense for some people, but my husband is hooked on it.

If the rum in the glaze is too "alcoholic", try boiling the rum and water for several minutes until the alcohol evaporates away, then add the sugar and butter. I almost always use Banana Instant Pudding (or use some banana liqueur in place of the rum). This is a classic recipe.

It's so easy and taste so good.  I tried it with the glaze and I prefer it without and just as it.  I found the glaze too sweet, but I don't like things too sweet.  The glaze does keep the cake moist.  The cake gets better if it sits.

Everyone loves this rum cake when I make it.  I only use Spiced rum in the cake and in the sause on top.  I've also found that when I wait for the cake the cool before I poke holes in it with my fork and pour the sauce on it, it doesn't like the absorb the sauce easily.  It just ends up pooling in the center and I use half the sauce that way leaving on the very top and center tasting of rum at all.  When I poke holes and pour the sauce right out of the oven it tastes amazing and comes out perfect everytime.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake was delicious!  I made it for one of our Christmas desserts, and everyone said it was great.  I used salted mixed nuts and made sure I thoroughly greased the Bundt pan (I've had problems getting cakes to come out of it "nicely" in the past).   The cake looked beautiful and tasted yummy.   The rum flavor was strong, but it wasn't overpowering - after all, it is a RUM cake!  This is definitely a keeper and I look forward to experimenting with different flavors (e.g. chocolate cake or spice cake).

This cake is fabulous! My husband loves Amaretto, so I used that instead, and it turned out fabulously. I have also tried it with the butter flavored cake mix instead of plain and it gives it a slightly richer flavor. This is now my husband's favorite cake.  He likes it so much I made mini bundt cakes for his family for Christmas. On a holiday plate, sprinkled with a little powdered sugar, they looked so festive and everyone raved over them.

This is almost the same exact recipe as what my mother makes. I love making this during the holidays. It's so moist and yummy. The rum really has a great flavor. Make sure not to buy cheap rum. It does make a difference.

As a Jamaican I usually make the complicated "black cake" but I wanted something a bit simpler and quick to make. Besides, I usually don't do my Jamaican cakes until Christmas, so this was a welcomed recipe. I tried it, the cake was absolutely wonderful! Thanks Mariann.

I omitted the nuts and opted for coconut instead (I added 1/2 cup of processed sweetened flaked coconut in the batter).  I also brushed the cooled imbibed cake with a little more simple syrup and pressed in more sweetened flaked coconut (toasted) on the top.  This tasted very similar to the Tortuga rum cake my niece brought back for me from Jamaica.  Wonderful recipe.

Soooo amazing I don't know why I didn't have this before. Every restaurant should serve it.
Only two suggestions, mix more rum in the batter and add more flour to compensate for the rum. I did about 3x the rum prebatter mix, with a slight amount of flour.
Also for the glaze DON'T pour the alcohol in while the pan is heating or hot, sooo dumb. Soo good!

My teenage daughter asked me to make Rum cake just a few days after I saved this recipe on Allrecipes. I hadn't even mentioned it! My children made this cake today and WOW, is it ever good! They had only one small change (out of necessity). Since we didn't have dark rum, pineapple rum was used in its place. I helped them at the end and followed a couple of other reviewer's tips. We poked holes in the cake while still in the pan and poured the glaze over it while hot. After it cooled a while, I tipped it out of the pan and onto a plate and sprinkled with powdered sugar. All the glaze had soaked into the cake which made it super moist and delicious! I have to admit, my expectations were not high for this recipe and I was very pleasantly surprised at how yummy it is. We'll have to make it again when we are expecting guests!

Yesterday, I had a request by co-workers for a rum cake. I had my reservations, being that this called for a box mix. Well, I'm SO glad I went ahead and chose this recipe!
I have never tasted rum cake, much less made it. I have to say that this cake is SUPER moist, very dense and oh so RUMMY! 
I accidentally used chopped pecans instead of walnuts. Now that I think of it, it's probably better to use pecans. That way, you don't get the bitter peel flavor that you sometimes get with walnuts.
Also, I only had Caribean Rum on hand. I don't think it made a difference. I will definitely be making it again! I'm thinking in muffin tins with the pecans sprinkled across the top and the glaze oozing down over the paper cup. Yum!

I made this for the first time today and it was a hit. I made just a couple changes but mostly stuck to the recipe. I made the cake exactly as written. I was afraid I would taste too much rum so I mixed all of the glaze ingredients together and boiled it for about 3 or 4 minutes. When the cake was done I used a basting brush and brushed on 1/2 the glaze while the cake was still in the pan. I then removed the cake and brushed the rest of the glaze on the top. It was perfect. Everyone loved it! Definitely a keeper. Thanks so much!

This is the 2nd time I make this cake for my Christmas Eve party.  It gets rave reviews.  It does have alot of rum flavor, so if you don't like it tasting like its namesake, then use another recipe. Dont worry about the batter being thick, it will work!

Very nice - everyone loved it! I ran out of rum, so I used 1/4c rum in the cake and 1/4c of mirin. I also only had lemon pudding mix. I thought my aunts would find the rum flavor too strong, so I used lemon juice in the sauce. It turned out to be a very successful lemon/rum cake!

Delicious! I used butter cake mix and added 1 tsp vanilla to the glaze, other than that I followed exactly.  I'm making in mini bundt pans for Christmas gifts and I know my family will go crazy over these.

I made this recipe for the first time this weekend and made 24 mini bundt cakes out of it. I made a couple small changes. I baked my minis at 300 degrees for about 15 minutes. In the cake, I used milk instead of water and I used Capt Morgan rum in the cake and glaze. The first batch, I cooked off the alcohol for 5 minutes and after they cooled, I could barely taste the rum. So, the second time I did exactly as the recipe stated and there was a great rum flavor, it wasn't too strong either. Some of the glaze sat on the bottom of my cakes, so I turned them upside down for a little bit, so they would dry. I was putting them in holiday bags and didn't want them to be too sticky. I did have a lot of glaze left over, which was probably because I made mini cakes instead of one big cake. The cakes had great flavor and were very moist. They are definitely better a day or two later. This will be a recipe I use every year!

Flipping Fantastic!!! Truth? I made this cake because my 4-year-old son was watching "Bee Movie" and Rum Cake is offered to Barry the Bee. This was a very moist cake but I did only bake it for 40-50 minutes, and made half the glaze (made with rum flavoring) and added it after cooling the cake for a few minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!

Love this! I've made it both with and without the rum and it's so good! Not quite as dense as a poundcake and really moist. Came out great in a 9x13 and also as cupcakes. If you do cupcakes, fill a little less than halfway so it doesn't bake up beyond the edge. Then the glaze will soak in and not run over. Some of my cupcakes were too high so I used a turkey baster with an injector tip to get glaze into the middle.

This is fantastic! Make sure you poke LOTS of holes in the cake and take the time to get all of the glaze soaked in. The longer it sits the better it is so make it in advance if possible....however, not necessary.

I have been making this recipe for several years but with a lower calorie swap that does not affect its popularity:  use equal amount of nonfat yogurt instead of oil in batter, use eggbeaters instead of eggs.  Every little bit... also, I pour the glaze on as soon as it comes out of the oven & allow cake to cool completely before turning out onto a plate.  I also add a cup of water-soaked raisins with the nuts for extra punch if I have some.  Never fails to be a hit or to disappear at a party.

I don't usually like rum cake because it's too soggy but my bf does so I had him score this recipe.  It's very moist, amazingly so.  It doesn't have that coffee cake texture that crumbles apart when you cut it so I was impressed by that.  It didn't get too soggy, although I used only half the glaze.  It also freezes well.

This cake was very good. Didn't taste the rum as much as I thought I would. Maybe it was me because my roommate tasted the rum quite well. But other than that, it was very good.

My favorite cake.  Easy to make, and works great with other flavors of cake and pudding mix.  My favorites are fudge cake / chocolate pudding, and cinnamon swirl cake / vanilla pudding.  People ask me to make the cinnamon version all the time.

This is a sure winner!! I do substitute dark rum for flavored rums such as orange or coconut.  If you bake this cake once, you'll bake it again and again.

All I can say is YUM!!!  This cake came out moist, sweet but not too sweet, rummy but not too rummy, and it was SO easy to make.  I did not have the vanilla pudding mix so used coconut cream instant pudding mix and it added such a nice flavor to the cake!  This will become one of my classic holiday recipes!

This recipe is very easy to prepare and will make a good impression with your friends as a dessert. Usually I can't find instant vanilla pudding, so I buy a yellow cake mix with pudding already incorporated in the mix and it works well too. Also, I replace the 1/2 cup of oil for 1/2 of butter and it improves much more the flavor.

This is a sweet and easy recipe to make.  I make it all the time and have memorized it and so has my 7 year old.  It's always a hit at parties.  Check it out!

I make this cake often.  It is one of my most requested cakes.  This time I used a pineapple cake mix and coconut rum.  Awesome! :)

I just use the cake mix with the pudding in it, be careful with sampling the batter, to me it is quite potent.

Easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I followed the directions (although I used pecans instead of walnuts) and used the third review from the top as a guide.  Awesome!  I will definitely recommend this recipe and make it again real soon.

I made this for a bake sale at work today, and people loved it!  I used a golden butter recipe cake mix, fat free/sugar free pudding and light rum, because that's what I had on hand.  It was still great.  I used a combination of walnuts, macadamia nuts and almonds and that was a delicious variation for the topping.

Excellent!  Easy recipe to make and delicious.  I followed exactly and am glad I didn't add any additional rum because the taste is pretty strong.  My son didn't care for it but that's ok, more for Mommy and Daddy.  The icing is a little tricky, had to make it twice to get it to come out correctly--stir at a slow boil for 5 minutes...not a second more!  Very good, I'd definitely make it again.

It's not bad for a quick cake, but a little too much rum for my liking. If you're looking for something that's got a strong rum flavor, then this is your cake. If you've got some time on your hands try a different, more from scratch recipe. Also, I opted for a different frosting- chocolate, which was yummy.

Excellent rum cake recipe!  I used a wooden skewer to poke holes in the top of the cake, before spooning the glaze over it.  The glaze is quite thin, so you will need to scoop up what runs onto the plate and pour it back onto the cake.  In my oven, the cake was done in 47 minutes.

This was delicious! I didnt have any dark rum on hand so I used regular rum mixed with Malibu rum. This is a keeper. I baked in a rose bundt pan and it came out beautifully.

I used devils food cake mix and chocolate fudge pudding. I didn't have any rum, so I used kahlua instead. Also, I substituted fresh brewed espresso for the water used in the cake. It was delicious!

Very good.  My husband loved the rum taste in the glaze and cake.  Next time I think I will add the nuts in the whole cake rather than just the bottom (I used a tube cake pan).

Delicious.  I will definitely make this cake again.  I did a couple of things a little bit differently.  Used pecans instead of walnuts, soaked the cake while it was still warm (I removed it first to make sure it would come out easily) and left it for a good hour or two, and once plated I drizzled more rum glaze on the top.

fantastic! i was looking for a recipe that was similar to the one i usually use because my cookbooks are in storage at the moment! this went over well at the potluck i took it to, and i made it with gluten free mix. Im sure it would be just as good with regular mix so i give it five stars. also its fun to mix up the rum flavors, i like pineapple or pineapple coconut bacardi

Easy & delicious! Can definitely make some swaps (i.e. nuts, cake flavor, rum choice), but it's just what the doctor ordered to bring some Caribbean into this New England winter weather!

Used a sugar free cake mix and it still tasted great! New Year's Eve and there was no store open, so I used a sugar free yellow cake mix from Betty Crocker. The cake was still moist and delicious. I did aerate the cake with a fork before pouring the glaze. But next time I may try what some other reviews suggested....may try to pour glaze in the upside down pan while cake is still warm and see if more soaks in.

This is the one thing that my grandmother requests for me to make her. The only thing that I do differently is that I use flavored rum instead of dark rum (pineapple, mango, etc.).  She will eat half of the cake in one sitting if you let her. Lol

I could only find a cake mix that was 16.25 oz instead of 18.25.  I added a little more than 1/4 cup of flour and 2 Tablespoons of sugar and left out one egg to balance it out.  The cake was great, but I which I'd poked it more and let more of the glaze seep in.  The glaze was really good, but didn't penetrate the cake enough...

Great recipe. The one thing I change is to use a nice Amaretto liqueur instead of just rum. This takes the cake to a new level! This is my "go-to" dessert for adults.

I'm a huge fan of the tortuga rum cake and this cake tastes just as delicious. I used walnuts both for the topping as well as inside the cake. I recommend making a little extra sauce cause the sauce is what makes the cake delicious.

I have made this cake many times now and it's always a hit! No one ever believes it came from a mix & it's become a regular request from friends & family. I do take the cake out of the pan & pour in a bit of the rum mixture so the cake can 'marinate' in it before I skewer it & pour the rest on top. Very yummy & moist.

This is a fantastic recipe and produces a cake superior to Tortuga.  That being said, it's also extremely versatile!  I substituted coconut rum to the dark rum, pineapple juce for the water and pineapple jello for the pudding and it was fantastic!

My Husband has been making this cake for over twenty years, mostly for Christmas. He has a large list of people who want this cake, love this cake. He always takes them to our bank people. Sometimes when he goes to the bank a newer employee will say "Oh, your the cake man". Good cake.

This is a delicious cake. It's the Bacardi rum cake recipe that's been around for ages.  Sometimes I add coconut extract. I usually use Bacardi dark rum, but have used Capt Morgan's spice rum and it gives it a kick.

I do a lot of baking, and have knocked myself out with complicated recipes but this is the one my non-dessert-loving boyfriend asks for all the time - and could polish off by himself!  I just made it as cupcakes with just a slight alteration to cooking time  (just under 30 mins), a dollop of buttercream icing with a touch of rum over the rum glaze (so it can soak in) and then a sprinkle of the crumbly walnuts.  This is a fantastic, super easy recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was perfect. I made it for a friend for Christmas and he called the next day to say that it was the best Rum Cake he had ever had. He gave a neighbor a slice and he said the neighbor came back later that day to ask for more! I recommend trying this one. It's an easy hit!!!

VERY good cake.  I used Captain Morgan rum only because that's all I had on hand.  I also used rum extract in the glaze so the kids could eat the cake - a little goes a long way with rum extract.  I made this cake for Thanksgiving and will make one tomorrow for Christmas.  Delish in the morning with coffee too!

Oh WOW. My first rum cake. I made it as written with no changes (except I don't have a bundt pan, but will definitely get one now!!) This is wonderful!! It seems a very versatile recipe, so I'm sure I'll experiment with other cake mix/pudding/rum flavors, even though this is incredible as is!! Deliciously decadent!!!!

This turned out really delicious.  It lasted 2 days in my house.  The only change that I would make is to add more of the glaze, but that is my personal taste.  My sister thought it was perfect just how it was, and said "why mess with a good thing?"

Yum!  I made this for my husband's birthday.  It seemed like a good choice because he is not much of a cake fan, but he does love rum.  The recipe is perfect as it is written - the only change I made was to use spiced rum instead of dark.  It gets even better and more moist after it sits a few days, if you can make it last that long.

Wonderful cake. Used "butter recipe white" mix as that's what I had, and sprinkled chopped unsalted pecans in the center. I'll do that again, but will sprinkle some cinnamon sugar over the nuts before topping with the rest of the batter. Also poured half the glaze over the bottom of the cake to soak, then flipped it onto a plate and topped with the rest. It was thoroughly soaked...next time I'll just pour it on top since the bottom half was really overwhelmingly strong.

Very tasty and easy.  I added a pinch of cinnamon to the batter since I thought this would be a good compliment to the spiced rum I used.

Super easy! Very very rummy. Yum!! I made this for a co-worker's birthday and everyone loved it. Several asked for the recipe. My hubby was so mad that I was taking it to work and that he couldn't have any! Will be making this again, for sure.

Love love love this recipe! I made 4 of these over Christmas.  I know this is a pretty common recipe handed around, but I would reccommend you try it.  We actually used a 1/2 of rum in the glaze.. it had that nice warmth of a good toddy.  Love this cake sooooo much.

This is fabulous! I used light rum and a French Vanilla cake mix. (What I had on hand)I also mixed 1/2 of the nuts into the batter. The only problem I had was in getting it out of the bundt pan- It split and I ended up having to leave it in the pan and put the glaze over the bottom of it. (I let it cool completely, overnight...)My ds and I are enjoying a piece together  
I will definitely save this recipe! Thanks!

I decided that this was 'as good as any' recipe I'd seen for a Rum cake, so I made it.  The only change I made was to swap out the walnuts with pecans--only because that's what I had on hand.
The cake got rave reviews and I will be making it again!

This is really good! Maybe too good because I keep eating “just one more small piece” :-) I used light rum because that’s what I had on hand. Super moist and delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I didn’t make any changes in the ingredients other than not using nuts. The only difference I made was applying the glaze. I took the cake out of the pan and put it on a plate then poked holes on the top and sides. Then dumped the prepared glaze in the bottom of the Bundt pan and put the cake back in. I rolled it around to make sure most of the glaze was absorbed into the cake. I left it in there for a few minutes and then I put the cake on the cake plate  and the glaze was almost entirely absorbed into the cake. Super yummy!! Husbands favorite cake!!

The Rum cake turned out perfectly. The glaze was fabulous. Ensure that you poke plenty of holes on the top and sides of the cake, so the glaze can be absorbed.

I have a "scratch" recipe I have made many times, but thought I would give this a try.  It has a softer texture than mine, but I was very pleased.  I used a tube pan, a good Jamaican rum, and after I poured the glaze, I used a pastry brush to "paint" the cake with what glaze was on the plate.  It definitely tasted better on Day 2 after the rum had permeated the cake. Like a "cake cocktail." Deeeelicious!   I give it my "seal of approval!"

I made the cake just as the recipe instructed except, I did not add any nuts and I could only find golden rum, not dark. The cake was very moist and tasted delicious. I forgot to take a picture before slicing into it.

I made this for Christmas last month and it was amazing. I think I doubled the glaze. The only change I made was to use banana pudding instead of vanilla. I used spiced rum since that's what I had. Absolutely finger-licking delicious!

Great cake! I used a butter pecan mix (good luck finding 18.25 size). I also used coconut pudding, Malibu coconut rum and pecans. Added a little sweetened coconut to the glaze when adding the rum.  Was very good and will make again!

I made this cake basically as per the recipe.  It was delicious and easy. I used spiced rum in both the cake and the glaze because that is what I had.  The next time I will double the glaze.  I did remove the baked cake from the pan and put in half the glaze for soaking and found that  just the nutty area absorbed the glaze on top.  I also only baked it for 48 min.  Checked it at 45 min and it was golden and almost done.  This is a keeper.

Yes, sour cream. Yes pecans, and yes spiced rum.( Captain Morgan). Also added black currants. Bump the glaze up to 16 portions. Let cool a little until it pulls away from the pan, poke holes in it with BBQ skewers, then pour on the glaze. Save some to add on a slice. Fast, easy, delicious.

I also added crushed pineapple to the cake mix and used the pineapple juice instead of water. Did not use water for the glaze used more rum.

I read lots and lots of reviews before making this cake. I followed
The recipe except I did allow to cool and then invert so that I could put glaze in the bottom and the rest on top. I would like a little more rum flavor personally. -- I got rave reviews and will definitely make this again- I have a catering business and I will put this in the rotation---
Very good

This cake recipe turned out great!  I used Bacardi Black Rum and cake had a good strong rum flavor.  I let it sit least two hours before serving.  Next time  I will wait even longer &
instead of just poking holes in top of cak & pouring glaze I
may invert cake & do the same to bottom of cake and let it sit.

I enjoyed the addition of walnuts, even though I dont typically like nuts in my cake. Make sure to let it age a minimum of 24 hours. Its best after 2-3 days. Make sure it can breathe or else it wont lose that alcohol aftertaste.

I made mini bundt cakes using rum we brought home from our honeymoon cruise for Christmas presents for our friends and family. I made extras just in case i needed a quick gift.  Everyone loved them, one person actually thought they were from a famous bakery from the islands and when he realized i had made it, he couldn't believe it. I will definitely make these again.  
The only thing i changed was i didn't use nuts, and i used confectioners sugar sprinkled on the top. 
Made a beautiful presentation in a bag with a ribbon on it.

Fantastic!  I have been making this for years and have people who look forward to receiving this at Christmas time.  Several friends have nut allergies and I have used mini chocolate chips in place of the nuts in theirs and it still turns out to die for!!  I've made mini loafs and regular size large loaves, all turned out perfect.

I make this recipe "as-is" and it is ALWAYS a hit!  I've also tried it with chocolate cake mix (chocolate fudge, not devil's food) and chocolate pudding and it was just as delicious and popular.

I use a wooden skewer to poke holes in the bottom of the cake (while it's still in the pan) and use a turkey baster to drizzle about half the glaze all over the bottom.  I let the cake sit in the pan for a while until the glaze really soaks in, then invert the cake onto a plate.  I poke holes over the top of the cake with the skewer and use the turkey baster again to drizzle the remaining glaze over the top of the cake.  This seems to really give the cake a strong infusion of rum-my goodness!

I haven't tried it because it is for my bosses birthday tomorrow.  The cake came out beautifully however the glaze leaves a lot to be desired.  I followed the recipe exactly and the glaze was all runny and most of it ran off the cake.  This was after the cake had cooled too.  I read another recipe that says to let the glaze cool for 10 minutes first and I think that would have helped a lot.  Also, was frustrated as it called for a yellow cake mix of 18.25 oz. when all the yellow cakes mixes in the store are only 15.25 oz.  I had to buy a second box and split it evenly 5 ways and use one of the 5 shares.  Where do you find a cake mix that is 18.25 oz?  Also, the pudding said 3.5 oz. and the largest the store had was 3.4 oz. so not sure where these measurements came from but surely not standard sizes.  I also wish the recipe would have stated whether the cake should be refrigerated over night or not.  Looks good but recipe itself could definitely use some tweaking.

I used a chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding, baked as directed.  For the glaze I used half the sugar and double the rum, poked holes in the cake, and as others suggested, allowed the glaze to soak into the cake.   It turned out great; not much rum flavor, in my opinion, but it was competing against all the chocolate so hard to tell...next time will try with butter pecan cake mix and coconut cream pudding.

This is my grandma's recipe. The family has shared it with everyone who asks. It is so yummy! At family gatherings we fight over this rum cake, even when there are other delicious desserts around. I was going to post it and saw it was already on here. Grandma would be so happy that so many are enjoying it!

I loved it!  I left out the nuts because I don't like nuts.  I used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum and it turned out wonderful.  I remember my Aunts rum cake from when I was a little girl and this was just as good.   The best part is that this recipe is a lot easier.

Made this as written and it's delish!  My whole family loved it.  We all especially loved the glaze so I made a bit more of that.  Very easy, and doesn't taste like a box mix.  I will definitely make this again.

Couldn't get dark rum so used light & I like it better. Hubby thought the glaze was to strong, so next time will use a little less but that is preference. I liked this better than the Rum Cake I bought through an on-line coffee website I order my espresso beans from.

Great!!! I tryed it for the first time today and It was fantastic. I omitted the oil and used french vanilla pudding instead of plain vanilla.It still was very moist and delicious. I will Definitely use this recipe again.

This has been a family favorite for years.  The changes I make are to omit nuts, use light rum instead of dark, and increase the sugar in the glaze to 1 cup.  I made this the last time my husband's uncle came to visit...and he loved it too!  So easy and so good!

I've baked this cake several times and each time it is a huge hit!  The only change I made was to use Malibu coconut rum and it turned out great.  Easily a family favorite!
