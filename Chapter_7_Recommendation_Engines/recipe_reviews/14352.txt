Very colorful and tasy! I would recommend tossing the pasta with the olive oil vinegar and pepper before adding the other ingredients. Will definitely make again.

This is a large easy different pasta salad that would be great for a pot-luck. I used kalamata (greek) olives instead of regular black. I also used Kraft's bag of "mediterranean" cheese crumbles (provolone feta and parmesan). I thought it needed more vinegar and a pinch of salt. I think next time I would use 2/3 to 3/4 of the pasta in order to concentrate the other flavors a bit more.

Very good taste! We have been preparing pasta salads for a long time but the ingredients in this recipe went well beyond our usual fare.

Very good and easy but I agree maybe less pasta to concentrate the flavors. And I thought it needed some salt which I added to taste.

Well I guess that's what I get for omitting the peppers a bland salad. Trust me the basic flavor was ok without the pepper just don't omit it like I did (just for health reasons). Was also disappointed in the wetness of the salad..really had no consistancy and a little on the dry side..but I enjoyed all the ingredients so it was still edible.

I made it just as written except that I used green pepper instead of red and I used two tablespoons olive oil and 4 tablespoons vinegar. It was good but nothing special. It still tasted like it needed more vinegar.

Used orange pepper cuz that's what I had on hand. Used Athenos brand garlic and herb flavored feta crumbles which made a big difference. Would have been a little too bland otherwise I think. Tasty!

We really liked this pasta salad! I halved the recipe but kept the dressing amounts the same after reading some reviews...perfect balance! The fresh garlic in this was great too. Added a little salt to taste and it was good to go. ..a definite keeper-yum! Thanks for sharing ??

Extremely dry and bland there was not near enough seasonings for the amount of pasta. I used some bottled Greek dressing and the next time it was great.

This was the perfect back yard BBQ pasta salad!  I omitted the red peppers because my family doesn't like them.   Other than that I followed the recipe, I just added in some fresh cracked pepper.

I make my fair share of cold pasta salads, and I could tell, as other reviews confirmed, that the amount of pasta to mix-ins is off. I used 8 ounces of pasta (rotini) and kept the other ingredients the same, subbing orange & yellow sweet pepper for the red (as that's what I had on-hand). This, in my opinion, is a better ratio of pasta to condiments. I also added another splash of red wine vinegar after tasting it as is. With these slight adjustments, I'd give this 4 stars.

The only change I made was to add some salt, but otherwise our whole family loved this!
