I liked this fish dish, I really enjoy the combo of mushrooms, cheese and haddock.  The only thing I disliked is that it came out of the oven very watery, I am pretty sure it was the mushrooms as they will sweat when cooking.  In the future, I would saute the mushrooms until they released all their liquid, not just 5 minutes, then add the onion until tender.  Additionally, not covering the dish with foil may help. I used cheddar cheese over the Colby-Jack, as it is a more flavorful cheese, not sure it made a difference.  Thanks!

I made this for dinner last night but omitted the dried red chile peppers and it came out awsome.  I will definetly save this recipe and make again. It was very simple to make.

This is a very good recipe for haddock - I used crimini mushrooms, omitted the dried chili peppers and substituted cheddar cheese for the blend suggested in the recipe. If you use fresh fillets, they'll be cooked after the first 15 minutes, so I broiled the cheese after the initial cooking time and that worked like a charm. The reason for the 4 stars - having access to fresh haddock all year around, I have other recipes that are just awesome. This one is great for a quick week-day meal.

This recipe was a nice change from our usual baked fish.  The only thing I plan to change next time is to cut down on the amount of shredded cheese since we felt the cheese masked too much of the haddock flavor.  All in all this is a good recipe.  Thank you for posting it.

This was fantastic! What made it even better is that my husband cooked it!!  We omitted the dried red chile peppers, sub the following garlic powder with garlic pepper, we used mexican cheese(which has 3 different cheeses and used fresh parsley.
My 8, 5, & 4 year old all loved it!!  Everyone wants to have it again.

I really like haddock, mushrooms and cheese, so I really expected to like this recipe... but I just didn't. The combination of flavours just did not work together for me. I gave it 3 stars because my husband and I both finished it, but I wouldn't make it again. Another thing I would like to note is that the fish should not take 30-35 minutes in the oven, mine was done in just under 20.

This was fantastic!  My husband's comment was "This fish is awesome.  We need to have this again."  I didn't have the chile peppers and used marble cheese instead.  Definitely a must-have again recipe.

Simply delicious...I changed and sauteed the green onions and mushrooms in butter instead of olive oil and didn't add any more butter later.  My husband said this was the best fish I've made.  
Glad I made it because I was a little skeptical at first with the combinations.

I ommitted the chili peppers, as my husband doesn't care for them.  We thought the dish was very blah, with little to no flavor.  Could be because of the missing peppers.  Anyway, don't think I'll be doing this one again.

I am sorry Erin, I would give this all 5 stars but could not find Haddock, I used a nice white fish called Hake, firm, pleasant fish I found @ Smart N Final. Hubby Loved this dish! A+ I didn't bother sautéing the mushrooms, I just let the heat from the oven do the work, added a sprinkle of oil and Sriracha hot sauce. Delish:):) Thank You Erin.

This was fabulous!  I made it for myself and my husband and we both loved it.  I didn't change a thing however at the table I sprinkled a little Old Bay on my dinner (my husband doesn't like Old Bay so that's why I didn't add it to the recipe).

I think my late husband put it into my mind that you never put cheese on fish.  He was from Italy and it just stuck with me.  i actually love all the ingredients and thought it was delicious..  I'm glad I went ahead and tried it.  It was super tasty.

We really enjoyed this  fish.  We had it with rice and salad.  I followed the recipe except for the garlic powder which I thought might over-power the delicate fish flavour.  Unfortunately I forgot to add the lemon at the end.  I think that would have been a nice touch.  I am definitely planning to make this recipe again.

This is a great recipe.  I used hake rather than haddock.  I think any white fish like cod or tilapia would work, too.  Instead of chopped butter mushrooms, I used sliced small portobello mushrooms.  I omitted the dried red chile peppers because I didn't them and we didn't miss them.  Also, I substituted shredded cheddar for the Colby-Monterey.   Whatever cheese you like can be used.  I did not cover the pan with foil because I don't like steamed fish.  It came out perfectly so I would omit that part of the directions completely.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Boyfriend couldn't get over how buttery this dish tasted- by that he adored it. The funny part is I completely omitted the butter. Only olive oil was used. My best guess as to why is the mushrooms (baby portobellos). I did add a bit of red pepper, yellow onion and diced jalapenos to finish off what I had in the fridge. This is going on the rotation for sure. Thank you for posting! Oh and as for the liquidy issue goes, just let it go under the broiler for 5+ min to dry up some of the juices. Enjoy!

This is a great, quick meal! Very tasty and fairly healthy.  Thanks Erin for sharing.  Here are a few changes that I made:

- sautéed the mushrooms in a non-stick pan, with no oil or butter, to get rid of the excess water 
- then added a tablespoon of butter (omitted the olive oil) and added a splash of white wine (about 1/4 cup)
- reduced white wine by 50%
- added green onion and continued to cook for another 5 minutes

The only other change i made was substituting chill powder for paprika (my daughter is not a big fan of spice)

My husband loved this recipe.  I thought it had too much cheese on it. It was easy to make.

Delicious recipe! It's hard to find ways for my husband to eat whitefish unless it's fried, but this recipe is definitely a keeper in our house!

Made this with smoked Haddock. Very simple to make with only a few ingredients. I love garlic but thought there was little too much in it. Very tasty and will definitely be making it again.
