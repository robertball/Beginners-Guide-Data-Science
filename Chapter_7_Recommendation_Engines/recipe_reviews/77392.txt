The end result was a VERY rich, smooth cheesecake.  One has to be a big chocolate lover to fully appreciate this cheesecake.  I did bake this in a water-bath, wrapping the spring form pan in foil to avoid water or filling leaks, then let the cake cool for 1hr. in the oven when turned off without opening the door.  and....Viola!  Abosolutely no cracks and a beautiful presentation for dessert after chilling for 4hours!  Easy recipe to impress guests with!

YUM YUM! This is THE BEST cheesecake ever! Everyone that tasted it fell to the floor. I served it with a dollop of whipped cream and a raspberry for decoration. It is so rich and easy to make. This is a keeper!

Oh man! Oh man! Oh man! I made this for a friend for her birthday without ever making it before hoping from the reviews that it would be wonderful. There was no reason to be nervous! What an amazing cheesecake!!! I wrapped it the sides and underneath the pan with foil and baked it in a waterbath then let it cool in the oven for an hour followed by an hour on the counter. Then I let it chill in the fridge overnight. I have all kinds of requests for individual size cheesecakes now. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that could be served in a restaurant!

This cheesecake is AMAZING!!!  I served it at my Christmas party and it VANISHED.  Everyone was raving about it.  First, I used all Neufchatel cheese (1/3 less fat).  I baked it for 58 minutes on a cookie sheet in a springform pan.  Instead of the crust suggested in the recipe, I baked a box of brownies for 30 minutes, then while hot I scooped the brownie out and pressed it into the bottom of the springform pan.  Then I poured the cheesecake in and baked it as usual.  After the cheesecake cooled, I mixed up a ganache (boil 1 cup half and half, remove from heat, add 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate and 1 ounce bittersweet chocolate, wisk until smooth).  I poured the ganache on top of the cheesecake and immediatly placed it back into the fridge for 30 minutes to cool.  This was AMAZING.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This was my first time making cheesecake and it turned out GREAT! This recipe is restaurant quality! I used chocolate graham crackers and butter for my crust instead of the one here and that worked great.

This is so delicious and so easy to make! It is very chocolatey, rich and creamy! I did place a pan of water underneath cheesecake while baking in the oven and I let it sit in the oven  after cooking for one hour. I served it with  a dollop of whipped cream and raspberries. So decadent and absolutely sinful and so delicious!! Thanks for sharing!

Oh wow, yes, this is truly a cheesecake for the chocolate lovers out there. The filling is so smooth and creamy, just as the name says - truffle. The crust, I did use graham crackers and it came out sinful nonetheless. I cut the recipe servings down and made a 5 inch cheesecake. I garnished the top with a very thin layer of hot fudge sauce (which was not hot btw) and piped on some whipped cream. Beautiful presentation and so sinfully delicious. Thanks for posting.

I made this amazing cheesecake for my son's 15th birthday.  We are definately chocolate lovers and this was a hit.  I added one teaspoon of boiling water to one tablespoon of instant coffee to create a mocha flavor.  I also put a pie pan of water on the lower oven shelf while baking and left it in the oven 45 minutes after turning off the oven. Absolutely wonderful!

Happy to find this recipe (I've gotten on the eagle site before) here!  Wow, this cheesecake is excellent.  Using a high quality chocolate it's just as good as the Godiva Cheesecake from the Cheesecake factory!

A-MAZ-ING! I have never made a cheesecake before, but this turned out PERFECTLY! My cousin has always been the "Cheesecake Queen" in our family, but I think I'll be giving her a run for her money now. I cooked this in a water bath, turned the oven off and left it in the there for an hour after it was done baking, and then left it on the counter for another hour after that, before putting it in the fridge. Not a single crack! It was a thing of beauty. And the taste...oh...the taste. Delicious! My husband says it's better then the chocolate cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory. You REALLY have to like chocolate to appreciate this rich, delectable cheesecake...but if you're craving sinful, chocolaty, decadence, this is your recipe! I wanna make another cheesecake! :o)

This cheesecake is absolutly delicious! I made two, one to keep at my house, and one to take over to my relatives house for thanksgiving dinner. Either way, everyone went crazy about it! The crust was so buttery and the filling was so rich and creamy. I would though like to add that for some reason, both had a bunch of crack in them and they fell apart. But, they were still amazing! Thank you for a recipie that belongs in a gormet restaurant.

Just tried this for the first time to bring to a pot luck and everyone raved about it. Not only was it delicious, but it was the prettiest cheesecake I have ever made. I don't know if the water bath was the secret, but this is the first time I have never had a cheesecake crack. I will definitely be making this again.

This was a HUGE hit.  We made a rasberry sauce that we drizzled over each piece and it was incredibly deliciopus.  My dad decided that this was the best cheesecake that he had ever had (which is saying a lot since we eat a lot of cheesecake).  I used the waterbath technique plus I left it in the oven that I turned off an hour past it was supposed to come out.  That way there were absolutely no cracks, it looked gourmet.

WOW...FANTASTIC! I baked this an hour w/ a water bath, turned off the oven and left it in another hour. This is the first cheesecake I've ever made that did not crack, YAY! This was simple to put together and the taste is wonderful, rich and creamy. I topped mine w/ a simple ganache, once cooled...perfect. This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This cheese cake is awesome!  I made it for Easter and again with a friend for a bake sale.  I put some crust in the bottom of cupcake liners and then filled with the cheesecake and then baked until set.  They sold very well!!

Absolute deliciousness!  very creamy and unctuous.  I'm in New Zealand so had to google a few times to find a product equivalent.  In the end I chose to process a block of chocolate into chips in my processor but I ended up with a layer of chocolate on the bottom (which everyone actually loved!) next time I will melt the chocolate before adding to the mix.. just to suit the way I converted the recipe.  This one is a keeper and I will be making it again and again!

After reading all of the great reviews, this was a total disappointment. Just chocolate cheesecake, nothing to write home about. The texture was lacking, a bit dry, not creamy. Maybe I'm too picky. Will not make again.

I don't know what those that rated this low did, but I thought this cheesecake was heavenly.  It was rich and creamy and delicious!  Maybe theirs was overcooked, but mine was perfect.  This will be my go to chocolate cheesecake in the future!

I made the cheesecake over the weekand for the first time and and it turns out good. The flavor is heavenly, it melts in your mouth. I accidently used 2 cups of chocolate chips and no cocoa powder. I am sure the flavor is not much different.

OMG, good! I used 16 oz. fat free and 8 oz. low fat cream cheese, fat free milk & egg beaters. Instead of using the suggested crust, I sprinkled finely chopped chocolate wafer cookies & almonds in the pan. Rich chocolatey goooooodness.

Wonderfully rich. I cut down the amt. I used for the crust and coated the bottom of the pan with crumbs only. I used a non stick pan. Came out devine. mmmm

Amazing flavor! I used a 9 " springform pan and it was a nice height (not too sunken looking after it cooled). I swirled dark chocolate all over top and that made presentation nice.
