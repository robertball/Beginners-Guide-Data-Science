My family & I really like highly seasoned food.  As is, I knew this would be a very bland recipe.  I mixed in Montreal steak seasoning with the lemon juice & a little water & marinated pork steaks for about 4 hrs.  Then I poured off the marinade & mixed in the butter & brought it to a boil & then basted the pork steaks as recipe suggests.  I fixed them in the broiler & they were delicious.  Would have given a four but as stated as is I think the recipe is bland.

I added some oregano, parsley, and rosemary to the recipe. It added a lot of extra flavor.

This was absolutely delicious.  At first I wasn't sure about putting the buttered chops on the high heat of the coals, so I waited until they cooled a bit.  Next time I won't.  The high heat for some reason doesn't burn it, it gives it a great sort of crust.  Even my picky kids ate whole chop each.  And it was easy to make - you didn't have to plan ahead to marinate.  Definitely a keeper.  I actually made extra of the butter mixture to use as a sauce for the side dish (couscous or rice.)

These were okay, I didn't find they had a lot of flavor myself.  But they were very moist and tender.  Make sure you don't over cook them though.  I let mind marinade overnight, but that didn't seem to help much.

This was GREAT.  Especially for low-carb diets, but even if not.  I added mesquite seasoning, garlic and black pepper and marinated about an hour.  Also I added tenderizer because the cuts I used were very cheap.  Came very tender & very tasty.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I would have liked the marinade to get into the meat a little more, so maybe poking it with a fork before marinating is a good idea. I marinated them for a few hours, adding some black pepper and Adobo seasoning to the marinade, and grilled them on my mini indoor grill. I just seared each side on high heat every other minute while basting the other side as recommended, and kept a very close eye on it - you definitely have to do that on an indoor grill, especially if you use tender boneless chops like I did. The boyfriend and I really liked the flavor; we're always looking for healthy and tasty recipes. I'll make it again, thanks!

Wonderful, tasty, and fast!  This was an easy and delicious way to grill pork chops. My family and guest loved them.  I doubled the mixture to be sure there was enough for 7 boneless chops.

Very tasty - delicate citrus flavor compliments the garlic. It worked in the broiler, too. Then I took the pan juices and made a delicious gravy for my mashed potatos! Thanks for sharing.

Yum! This would make a great marinade for any meat! I plan on trying it again with T-bone steaks! I marinated the chops for about 3 hours, and had planned on grilling them outside, but it rained, so I broiled them instead. They were EXCELLENT!

Not bad, the butter gave it a good flavor.  I did add pepper in the sauce.  The hubby and four kids gobbled them up.

So easy. Very good flavor. I gave it four stars because I marinated mine overnight before I cooked it. I don't think it would have been quite as good without marinating.

I used 3 cloves of garlic for the three pork steaks we had and jazzed up the recipe with some herbs, salt and pepper, a pinch of lemon peel, and a splash of worcestershire.  Could stand a little more lemon juice.  Good off the grill!

Great Recipe!  I used an indoor covered grill and it turned out very flavorful.  I usually use a lot of seasonings so I was hesitant about the simplicity of this recipe, but I was pleasantly surprised!  Thanks!

It was a very good and easy recipe but I would recommend marinating the pork chops for several hours maybe even over night before grilling to help enhance the flavor.

Wow!  I've always been afraid to grill pork because it always turns out tough.  But this was so tender!  It was delicious and even my picky children loved it and requested it again.  We followed the cooking directions exactly and it was cooked just right.  Feel free to add any other spices or rubs on it, just use plenty of butter.

My husband and I love this recipe!! I took the advice of another reviewer and added parsley, oregano, and rosemary. This made the steaks very tasty!! I used our stovetop grill and cooked the steaks for 5 min. on each side, then put the under the broiler and spooned on the butter sauce, cooking them for another 5-10 min on each side. This got them well done but they remained very tender! Best pork steaks I have ever had!!!

These were surprisingly good!  I was looking for something fast and easy because I had no time to let the steaks marinate.  The reviews seemed to run the gamut and like some others, my family generally likes things a little more favorful.  BUT... this recipe made up for the lack of spice with being juicy in an unexpected way.  I served with rice, veggies and rolls for a quick meal.  A basic "keeper."

Yum!  So easy!  It's cold outside, so I did these on my stovetop grill pan, and they turned out great.  Nice and moist and flavorful.

Quick and easy.  I didn't expect lemon butter to go so well with Pork Chops!

Tasty, the souce caramelized on the grill, the pork was not too dry.  My Pork Chops were about 3/4 inch think.

I thought it tasted a bit too bland for my taste buds. Sounded Delicious.
