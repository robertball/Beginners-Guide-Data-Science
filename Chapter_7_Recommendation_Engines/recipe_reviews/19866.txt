These are delicious chocolatey bars - a great mixture of crunchy and gooey! I used an entire small package of Oreos and increased the butter to 7 Tablespoons in a 9 x 13 pan for a thicker bar. Very good and highly recommended!

I didn't really like this recipe.  It tasted alright (although a little rich) but the base was extremely crumbly and the top was really gooey.

Rich and chocolatey. It was a hit at the party I took them to, several people asked for the recipe. So easy too! I think I will make the cookie crust thicker next time. Although I made it in a 9x13 rather than 11x13 I still would like to taste even more of the crust flavor to offset the fudge layer above. Cut small and definitely chill before trying to cut. I put parchment paper in the bottom of the pan to make removal easier, but I don't know that it was necessary.

These were very good-indeed very chocolaty. I did take the advice of others who had experience with the recipe and also ended up using an entire bag of oreo cookies as the bottom to form a thicker "crust" and pretty much left everything else the same. Very fast and very easy-especially if you have a food processor to pulverize the cookies.

4 as written, a big ol' 5 with modifications. There would NOT be enough of a base if you made this in an 11x13 pan. I used 11x7 and it was perfect. Instead of using all the milk in the chocolate chips, I ended up pouring some over the top to help the cookies and chocolate chips stay in place (like what you do when you make 7-layer bars). It made the top not quite as pretty (you could see the milky color over the chocolate) but the taste is DiViNe =)  Rich and wonderful!

Excellent! I used all but about 8 Oreos (which I crumbled for the topping) out of a standard package, increased butter to 6 tablespoons, and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan. Because these are so sweet and rich, you can cut them small, like fudge. I ended up with about 60 small cubes--perfect for a kids' Christmas party. I cooled them completely, then chilled them for a few minutes, and cut them with no trouble. (It's even easier to cut them if you wait till the next day.) Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This recipe is to-die-for.  It is so easy to make and if you are a chocolate lover, you will fall in-love with this dessert.  Instead of the semi-sweet chocolate chips I used the swirl chips with the white chocolate.  This added a little color.  Definately make sure this dessert cools before cutting into it.  I actually made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge all night before cutting.  Took it to a baby shower and everyone enjoyed.  I will definately make this dessert again.

AWESOME! Especially the next day. I refrigerated overnight...even better than the day before (was easier and cleaner to cut too). I did follow the advice of others and I made extra for the crust at the bottom and used all but 8 Oreos (which I crumbled for the topping) out of a standard package, increased butter to 6 tablespoons, and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan. I didn't change anything else.

Absoultely incredible, and so easy! The only thing I changed was crushing several more cookies for the crust. I brought them to a party and they were a hit! Gone in the first 5 minutes!

Sooooo goooood!  I used the entire small box of Oreos (30 cookies, 24 for base and 6 for the top), and I used a 9x13 pan and it was perfect. They sliced easily and held their shape.  I think I would like to add salted pecans to the top next time.

These bars are excellent if you need to satisfy a chcolate craving.  I made them for my husband, and switched up a few things.  Instead of chocolate cookies, I used regular graham cracker crumbs, and added a 1/4 cup melted peanut butter to the crust.  It held together wonderfully.  I made the chocolate filling following the recipe, but than added peanut butter chips instead of chocolate.  A hugh hit with the husband, and kids will definitely make again, so easy and delicious!

These bars rock!  I used 2/3 can of the milk with the chocolate, and used 1/2 cup white choc and 1/2 semi-sweet on top of the melted chococlate.  Drizzled the remaining milk on top and baked as directed in an 11X7 pan.  Wonderful. Will definitely make again, but thinking about adding caramel topping next time.

When I made these bars, I only added 1 cup of chocolate chips (melted into the sweetened condensed milk), and omitted the other cup of whole chips.  I also used the entire package of Oreos in the crust as other reviewers suggested.  Then for the cookie pieces on top, I used Nutterbutters instead of Oreos, because I love the combo of peanut butter & chocolate.  I'm glad I cut down on the choclolate because these were very rich even with these changes.  I think they may have been too rich otherwise.  They were a huge hit at the party!

These are very rich!! I really enjoyed them and you only need a couple to curb the chocolate cravings! Next time I make them I will make a thicker crust at the bottom though. Thanks for the recipe!

These were really easy and delicious! I've also made them into smores bars by substituting graham crackers for the sandwich cookies and tossing abut a cup of mini marshmallows on top of the crust before pouring the chocolate mixture on. Bake them same and lasts just as long! Thanks for a great recipe!

SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!! I put these in a 9x13 (instead of a 11x13) and I did NOT refrigerate them. They cooled on he counter for about 2 hours before we cut them. They were gone in two days with only 3 of us eating them! I can't believe how quick and easy they were. I had all the ingredients right in my cabinent. Try'm... They're YUMMY!!!!!!

I made these for my family's annual Christmas Cookie Baking Fest and they were a huge hit!!  Several people told me these were their favorite of the 9 varieties of cookies we baked and gave them in their cookie plate.  I stuck with the 11x13 pan, but doubled the recipie, so it ended up being thicker.  We also individually wrapped them in plastic wrap so they wouldn't stick to the other cookies.  If you like Oreos and chocolate, then you will love this cookie bar.

These were wicked good. Everyone loved them. I made it in a 9x13 pan, and it needs to be greased. I would also recommend using 24 cookies for the crust, and an extra 6 for the top, as the crust was good, but thin. I left these out for 4 hours, and refrigerated them for 20 minutes, and they were still gooey, but good.

I used left over double chocolate cookies - for the base and the top and they came out amazing!!  the soft cookie base and top make them better than I imaged.  I strongly recommend using softer cookies!!

This was sinfully delicious! I am glad I read other reviews on this. I did use a full package of Oreos, minus 8 of them to make the crust and used 6 tablespoons of butter in a 9x13 pan. Thank you for this tip it was spot on!

I love this recipe.  I made a minor adjustment and used some melted white chocolate on top.  This way you can add colored white chocolate for the holidays.  Everyone loved this recipes, thanks for sharing.

Never been into recipes that do not require some sort of thought-process and adequate amounts of grey matter. When I bake it's from scratch. When I cook, I do the 'pinch-of-this' method. However. I made these, and they really are so. amazingly. good. I have  made them many times since, and will continue to whip a batch together every so often for night shift. 

Do increase the Oreos and butter for the crust, and don't forget to chill before cutting/eating it.

This recipe taste OK. There was not near enough base so I had to double the amount of chocolate sandwich cookies and the texture of the filling and the base did not go well together. So over all, not a fan.

Delicious! I made this for my friends at school and suddenly I'm extremely popular ;) Next time, though, I would add some more cookies to the crust because it was really thin and didn't entirely cover the pan.

I made these to take to work and everyone liked them.  I think the recipe would be a good base for a more complex layer bar.  Judging from the opinions of my co-workers though, it was fine the way it was. :)

Super rich and chewy!  Tastes like fudge.  Small bites go a long way.  Made it for hubby's work party and it was GONE!

I loved this recipe!  I increased the butter for the crust so that it was not so crumbly.  I have made this several times and sometimes use peanut butter oreos and pb chips with the chocolate - this goes over great!  Tried the holiday colors also!  This is a go to recipe for children and adults alike!

These are very sweet and chocolatey!  I was a little disappointed because the crust was very crumbly and didn't hold together.  To make the fudge part less "gooey" I added 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips to the milk instead of only 1 cup.  I only had 1/2 cup to sprinkle on top, but the fudge part set up really nicely.  Now if someone could figure out how to make the crust less crumbly!

Oh my Gosh! These are so good! I have a major sweet tooth, so this is right up my alley. But it really is a rich dessert. I have to say though, the fudgy part was still a bit gooey after I chilled it overnight. I enjoyed it anyway and will definitely be making more of these in the future. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

OMgoodness!  these were soooo yummy!  One of the easiest things to make and did I mention yummy!  they are very delictable and very rich!  I'm, already planning to take them to Thanksgiving dinner!  I did as others did and used all but a few cookies, and more butter for the crust and put it in a 9X13 pan, but otherwise, did not change a thing!  I ended up giving half the pan away just so we wouldn't eat them all, and we could have!  Thanks for sharing!

These were extremely rich and gooey - the chocolate lovers definitely ate them up! I thought they were almost TOO chocolatey, though. And I was expecting more of a brownie consistency, not flat gooey bars. Still, very tasty indeed!
