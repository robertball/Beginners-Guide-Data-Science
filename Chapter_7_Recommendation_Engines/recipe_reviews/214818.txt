I had some leftover fyllo dough and decided to try this out. The first one I folded was a little sloppy but then I realized I didnt have to go all the way to the edges when folding and they came out a lot tighter. Instead of frying I baked them at 350F for 25 minutes or a little longer depending on how crispy you want them. I sprayed the baking sheet with oil and then sprayed the briks. Thank you for this recipe! I will make this again.

In Morocco we call them Briwat. You can replace tuna with chicken, seafood or ground beef.

This was very good. My  only issue is that I just couldnt get one sheet of phyllo dough to work, it kept breaking because the tuna was so moist. I just used two sheets of the dough (layered), and it still came out really yummy and crunchy. Thanks!

The recipe is phenomenal, but phyllo dough and I don't work well together.

A crowd-pleaser!  So unique to serve.  Best part, there was a ton of tuna left and I mixed it with a tablespoon of Mayo and had a restaurant-quality tuna melt for lunch the next day.
