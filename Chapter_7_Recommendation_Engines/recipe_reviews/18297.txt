This recipe turned out GREAT!!! I used grated mild cheddar cheese instead of the pimento loaf, and i set the whirls and sauce on top of freshly steamed vegetables. I will definately use this recipe again. :)

Good flavor, but the sauce part was way too soupy.  I'd try it with another can of condensed soup instead of the milk.  Also, maybe it's just me, but my biscuit swirls didn't turn out at all swirly!  I also omitted pimentos & onion & added 2 cloves of garlic.

Okay, 6 oz tuna is not going to feed six - if they want to taste tuna.  I ran out of biscuit mix & subbed pancake mix.  It was fine.  'Couldn't tell.  I also used shredded cheddar & onion powder.  'Trying to get fish in the kids.  They couldn't taste it & they ate two each.  Wow.  I could barely see or taste it myself.  I didn't do any sauce.  Sooo, good for the kids since they ate it; but basically a biscuit that I could pass on.
