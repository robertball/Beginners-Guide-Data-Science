Absolutely loved the choice of ingredients which made for a salad as delicious as it was beautiful and elegant.

Easy and straight forward.  I added red onion because I love it - use what ever dressing you like but homemade ranch worked very well.  Thanks.

You cannot go wrong with this flavor combination, but I substituted sliced sausage links for the bacon and it was delicious!

we eat a lot of salads, the bacon brings a lot of pizazz and freshens up our salad choices.   Definitely do again.

Salads like this are SO good, with simple ingredients. I had a store-bought ranch veggie dip that I used as the dressing. It is thicker so I more or less dipped veggies into it. I had some delicious candied bacon that I made the other day on hand, so I used that. I skipped the croutons. Nice, light dinner on a hot summer evening.

Great recipe, I made my own garlic croutons, made it taste even better. Took it to a dinner party and everyone loved it!

Very good salad, but you certainly don't need a recipe for it.  Only thing I changed was the addition of blue cheese crumbles.

I've been making this salad for years -- great combination of flavors, and for us its hearty enough to be a main dish.  We prefer Girard's Light Champagne dressing (or whatever oil/vinegar dressing I have) instead of ranch, but that's just personal preference.
