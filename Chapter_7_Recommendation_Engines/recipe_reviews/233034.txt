We loved this quick and easy fajita recipe.  I did marinate the chicken for an hour in a mix of the juice from 2 limes, 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped cilantro, a tablespoon canola oil and a couple dashes of hot sauce.  When it came time to saut√© the chicken, I added the marinade to the skillet along with the chicken.  The added flavor of the cilantro and lime made this dish right on par with the fajitas we get in our local restaurants here in New Mexico. Using the prepackaged onions and bell pepper strips made this recipe so much easier. Instead of Birdseye, though, I used Trader Joe's Fire-roasted Onions & Bell Pepper Strips, as I shop there weekly and it was more convenient. The results were delicious! This is now my go-to recipe the entire family loves. Muchas gracias!

I used 3 bonless breasts which is over the amount called for in order to feed 6 of us.  I subbed my own homemade taco seasoning for the cumin and salt. Served on flour tortillas with rice, beans, and avocado. Tasty!

As written this recipe is lacking seasoning and it would not feed 4 people in my home.  With a few minor additions it is REALLY good.  I pre-seasoned the strips of chicken with fajita seasoning and let it sit for about 30 minutes.  I would suggest using a cast iron pan or a pan that you can good and hot.   One of the best things about fajitas is the fast sear that really develops the flavor.  I then added the frozen vegetables and sprinkled another teaspoon of fajita seasoning on the vegetables.  The frozen vegetables add just the right about of water to make a nice sauce.   This is fast and very easy and very tasty with some minor modifications.  Serve in warm tortillas with a side of Easy Spanish rice.

This makes a quick and easy meal and tastes delicious! The only seasoning I had was Taco Seasoning I from this site, so I sprinkled it on my chicken before browning it. Then I added more to the veggie mixture when I added it in. My husband loved this and added hot pepper sauce to his. I added plain Greek yogurt to mine. I served these fajitas with Best Spanish Rice.

These make a very quick and easy dinner and I always have the ingredients on hand for those nights when we need dinner fast.  I used Penzeys fajita seasoning and it was great.

This was easy to make. Make sure you heat up the oil before pan searing the chicken. I marinated the chicken in lime juice and fajita seasoning for at least 30 minutes because my family likes spicy fajitas. Adding guacamole, cheddar cheese and salsa makes for a tasty dinner. I made the fajitas for 6 people (5 adults and 1 child)  and I think I needed at least 1 and 1/2 bag of peppers.

This was good!  It made enough to fill 4 medium-sized tortillas.  We topped this with salsa, shredded cheddar cheese, plain nonfat Greek yogurt (tastes like sour cream in the fajita, but is much healthier), and leftover Mexican rice.  The only change I made was to add salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the chicken.  Yum!

This is a great weeknight dinner (and since it's just my husband and me, we have enough for leftovers!)  We don't eat a lot of meat, so we added refried beans to ours in place of the chicken.  I also used whole wheat tortillas because that's what we keep around the pantry.  I usually stick to fresh veggies, but these are great to keep in the freezer for emergencies or the nights you simply don't have the gumption to fight the grocery store.  We also added cheese to our final product because, well, cheese is awesome.

Very good, husband rated it a 10/10! I'm a very new cook, so the tomatoes got mushy and were a little gross. I cut the chicken into strips instead of cubed, and I added some cumin, garlic, salt, and cayenne pepper to the pot before adding the chicken. Delicious!

I liked this recipe, however, it was NOT enough to feed 4 people. I cooked extra chicken thank goodness. I have to also say that as a family who LOVES peppers, we would have liked more peppers and onions in the bag. It was good but needed some more flavoring. My son and I ate sour cream on ours.

I prefer fresh veggies, but in pinch the Recipe Ready veges are great to have on hand when you don't have time to do all the chopping! This recipe as is is bland, so I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and used spinach wraps. I also added cilantro for more flavor, along with sour cream, guacamole, and shredded cheese.

I have been searching for a simple recipe that I could keep on hand. I finally found it!! I am so allergic to most preservatives, I have 1 place near me and I can't afford to go there every time I want Mexican!!  Thank you!! My kids love this too.  Made 4X the amount needed so my daughter can take it back to school! With just a few changes, you can change the heat settings too.

Very fun! Subbed some homemade taco spice mix for the spices listed here, and just did a blend of red, yellow, and green peppers--otherwise followed the recipes. Made for a very good dinner, and then some very good leftovers. Put some fat free plain greek yogurt (tastes like sour cream) on the tortillas first, otherwise ate it plate. Yum!

Awesome! Very easy to make and you can have it as mild or spicy as you like. We added some rice to have it a little more filling.
