It looks like I'm one of the few, if not the only one, who prepared this recipe as written.  No add ins, no changes in amounts, no substitutions. And I DID use the full 2 cups of cream, which was just perfect.  Having said that, I believe this is a good, 3-star recipe, which in my book means average--not bad, but not extraordinarily good either. This was surprisingly nondescript, both in color and flavor.  Some might describe it as bland, hubby said it "needed something."
Even using the entire can of green chilies would have given this a flavor punch, and you might want to kick it up with maybe cumin, jalapeno, or hot sauce. Nevertheless, this made for an enjoyable dinner.

This recipe is fabulous!!! I did change it a bit, and will probably change it more the next time I make it. I added 4oz cream cheese, nuked it to make it soft, then added the cream, salt and pepper. I also added spinach to the chicken mixture. Next time I will add additional veggies to the chicken mixture - this is a ton of calories, so I need to disguise some veggies for my family! Maybe some corn, bell pepper, and tomatoes. I used regular salsa (Kroger Premium Selection Restaurant Style - my FAVE!) and 2 4oz cans of green chiles, and used a rotisserie chicken bought at the grocery store, cut up. (I was not about to cook chicken when I had worked all day!) I used flour tortillas because I don't care for corn, and didn't fry them - I loved the texture of the flour tortillas, it was soft but where the cheese melted was crispy and bubbly! I also used 8oz of Jack cheese, who needs a little bit left over, it goes bad! ;) Overall this is fabulous, definitely the best enchiladas I've had! Thank you for sharing, it will definitely be used again!

Excellent!  If you are looking for a more authentic enchilada suiza, and not some gloppy canned soup mess, try this recipe.  My husband could not stop raving about them...said they were better than any he had in restaurants.   I added the whole can of chili's,and also added about 1/2 pack of cream cheese to the mixture, just because I had it.   Would be excellent with seafood too!

I followed the original recipe and I thought it was a little bland. Don't get me wrong, the dish was good but next time I'll add granulated garlic and maybe some onion powder. I'll definitely use FRESH long green chile. I might garnish with fresh chopped cilantro. 

To roast chilies at home: 
Place chilies on a hot grill or in your ovens broiler. Be sure to rotate the chilies to allow the skin to blacken and blister all around. Place chilies in a large zip lock, then wrap the bag of chilies in a clean kitchen towel(the steam will loosen the skin). After the chilies have cooled to room temp peel the skin off and discard (the skin). Cut chilies into long strips or dice them up. ***You can freeze any unused chilies for future use.***

I substituted low fat half & half for the whipping cream as well as white corn tortillas (one-half as many calories).  My family raved!

I used half the whipping cream, and mixed in 4 oz. of cream cheese to dip the tortillas in. It was amazing! Next time I'll double that mix (two cups whipping cream with 8 oz. of cream cheese) and put some on the inside with the chicken. I made these enchiladas with the Fiesta Cheese Rice from this site. Delicious! Boyfriend said it was a keeper right off the bat!

I was not impressed with these at all. They need more kick in my opinion. I think I'll stick with Whit's Chicken Enchiladas

I have made a similar version for years and is a family favorite.  Leave out the chilie salsa, but add 1 6oz can of tomatoe paste.  I use milk not cream and add 6 chicken bullion cubes.  You can use swiss cheese on top (where the name came from).  There is no heat to this recipe, but we love it anyway and we are a family that loves hot spicy food.

I was glad to read a couple reviews that suggested additions.   I used some leftover veggie flavor cream cheese (melted) and replaced 1 cup of cream with 1 cup of sour cream.   I reduced the amount of green chili by half and added a whole chopped green pepper and also added a shredded carrot.    After placing remaining cream on top of the enchiladas and before covering with cheese, I added a few tablespoons of chopped cilantro leaves.

My family loved this; the only thing they would have liked was a bit of salsa verde sprinkled on top when served.  I will try that next time (and there *will* be a next time).

awesome enchiladas. I also substitute lump crab meat and small shrimp instead of the chicken. Either way it's always a hit.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I didn't buy already cooked chicken, I just took a few chicken breasts and chopped them up and fried them with seasonings, like garlic and onion powder, minced onions and some Ms. Dash.  I also added cream cheese, which I think was a great choice, but I also added some canned jalape√±os to spice it up a little more. All in all, this recipe was great, but has a lot of calories.

This recipe was delicioso!  I think I ate more than my share because it only served my family of 4, no left-overs.  The plates were so clean I just put them away without having to wash them.  Just kidding.  Thank you for sharing this LOSTUTTLES!

So simple and straight forward. I have made this several times! It is the best recipe hands down! Ive used leftover chicken, yes, canned chicken (Kirkland brand only) and rotisserie chicken. Hubby and kids love it. Serve with salsa or avocado on the side.

These were wonderful.  I have made tons of chicken enchiladas in my life, but this may become the new go to formula!  They were great.  I added a little cream cheese, cheddar and green onions to the filling just to use up some stuff in the fridge.

A GREAT recipe if you'r willing to spice it up a little with your own stuff.  I have not tasted a better enchilada!  I doubled the recipe put 2 chopped onions and garlic in to cook with the chicken and spiced it to my desires.  Then I put 8 oz of cream cheese in with the sauce and a tad of coconut cream (I know random but it worked).  I would recommend doing your own chilis too, it just makes it taste TWICE as good!

Chilis: slice and fry them till black and soft (perhaps with a little water) then put them in a large ziplock bag and wrap in a cloth about 15 min.  Take out and peel off the skin and presto!

I didn't have the chilies, but I used a can of medium hot green salsa and added a few sprinkles of cumin and some minced garlic to the chicken. Put it together as instructed, and used Swiss cheese. I did add a little (1 T) brown sugar to the whipping cream, as another reviewer had done. This dish was so good! These were the best enchiladas I have ever eaten- they were wonderful. Ialso served this with the Cheesy Fiesta Rice from this website. Wonderful meal. Who cares if it has enough fat grams to last a week?

These enchiladas are delicious.  My husband has gone on and on about them.  The 4-star rather than 5-star rating is because of my change to use flour tortillas rather than corn (just our preference).  Since I used flour I skipped heating them in the oil.  I just dipped in the cream, filled and rolled.  The result was a nice filled enchiladas with soft shells.  Other than the tortilla and oil change I made the rest as written.  I indvidually froze 6 of them for lunches. They reheat great and are much healthier than store bought versions.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I loved this recipe!! I did add 1 pckg thawed spinach, and subed the chilies for tomatoes with chilies and added cream cheese, about 4oz. AMAZING. By the way, thanks "Captain Obvious" to the person who complained about the fat and calories. Duhhhh, it's not listed under the healthy cooking section.

This recipe was truly mouth-watering. My husband loved it too. I added a little cream cheese to the enchilada filling and also grated some fresh pepper-jack cheese in addition to the monterrey-jack.

Delicous!!

Yummy! I made this for my husband and a friend of mine (who both love mexican food) and they thought it was delicious! I did add about a 1/2 cup of cream cheese to the filling and used some precooked fajita style chicken strips from Perdue- I think the seasoning really added to the flavor- and also saved some time! I couldn't find the green salsa, so I just used a medium spiced one that I picked up at the grocery store. And I added the entire 4oz of chopped peppers and it still wasn't too spicey- just perfect. Like other reviewers I recommend only adding 1 cup of cream- I think more would have made it too soupy. Try this recipe!

These enchiladas are superb! I have liked enchilada suizas for a very long time but have never found a good recipe for them (until now). I also added 4 oz. of cream cheese to the chicken mixture and they were very creamy. This is the first time my husband had ever tried them and he said this recipe was definitely a keeper. We just finished dinner and he already wants them again next week!

Didn't read reviews and made per recipe. This is what I consider a good base recipe. I will add seasonings next time to give the chicken more flavor. Cumin, chili powder, and some onion. I used more cheese than called for but we're a cheese family,

I recently made these enchiladas and they turned out wonderful!  Like someone suggested, I also added some cream cheese to the filling and the whole can of chilies along with some jalapenos.  I used almost all of the whipped cream that the recipe called for and let it bake a lot longer which worked out perfect because it allowed the sauce to evaporate.  I added some more jalapeno and some green onions on top of the enchiladas for some more color.  They were a little soggy but the the flavor was so great it didn't matter!

I followed others advice and used less cream. I cut it down to 1-1/2 cups but wish I would have used only 1 cup. It was still a little soupy but really great flavor. A wonderful way to used Thanksgiving's left over turkey. I had a recipe very similar to this many many years ago that called for two chicken bouillon cubes crushed and mixed into the cream so I did that rather than add salt, same effect I'm sure. Good eating !

My family thought these were very good!  I cut the cream down to about 1.5 cups, and added some cilantro to the chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  I'll be making this again soon!

Don't know what all the fuss is about the recipe.  It is very bland.  I cut back on the cream and thank goodness, because the texture was all ready too mushy.  I had leftover stuffing and used it to make nachos.  Go with the nachos, less fuss and tastes better with all the nacho trimmings (cheese, avocado, sour cream, salas, etc).

I really liked this recipe. I wish I had read reviews first,I would have used less cream,they did come out a bit soupy,loose. Could save the calories and still had a good dish. Will definately make these again with seafood as suggested by others. Thanks for sharing

The texture of these enchiladas really turned me off - they came out very soggy and grainy. I would cut the amount of cream in half next time.

This was one of my most successful meals so far! Only change I made was to double the recipe, since I was having company for dinner. Everyone loved it! P.S. Did I mention it was my in-laws over for dinner?!

Made these last night and they turned out great!  I too, only used half the amount of cream called for, and it was plenty.  I also let it bake for the 20 minutes, then kicked it up to broil for another minute or two to get the cheese a little crunchy!  We had this with the Mexican Rice III also found on this site & it was a great side dish.  Thanks for the great recipe!

First time trying this recipe today and it was a hit with me, my husband, and 22 month old!  I used the advice of another on the reviews and just used one cup of cream, which was perfect.  Also, I had my husband grill the chicken the night before and just heated it up in a skillet with the salsa and chiles.  Worked out great and we will definately have them again!

This was Great!  We were kind of chickened out this week so I just did cheese. I only had red salsa, I sprinkled it with black olives near the end and served with shredded lettuce,
tomatoes, sliced avacado,hot sauce,
and sour cream. YUMMMMM
My 10 and 11 yr old had 3rds!!!

Made just as recipe states and they turn out great every time. They are a little bland but we top them with different toppings if we want a kick. My kids love them.

These are amazing! I made them "stacked" because I'm too lazy to roll. I did add a little chicken "better than bullion", garlic and onion powder to the cream.

Really good and easy. I did not fry my tortillas, instead I slightly browned them on gas stove top about 30 seconds each side. I also cooked my chicken in the crock pot with the green chili's and salsa for the last hour. I did season my chicken with taco seasoning before adding to crock-pot. This came out really delicious. Will make again.

I too grew to love Enchiladas Suizas in Mexico, especially those at Sanborn's. This is pretty close. For those of you who think it is too bland , use pepper jack cheese and I think you will find it is just right. Glad to find this recipe. So easy, so good. Oh, and if you have some left over chicken, that is a good addition. I don't know about cream cheese but I suppose some people would like it that way.

Quick Easy and Really Tasty.  This recipe is a keeper.  The only deviation I made was to toast the tortillas on a gas burner instead of Frying them in oil.  Just like the $12.00 versions in the restaurants.

I "started" to make this recipe "exactly" as presented but at the last minute added 1/2 cup of shredded Swiss cheese to the 1- 1/2 cups Monterey Jack thinking that it can't be Suize Enchiladas without Swiss cheese! Then 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg.
This is now my Suize Enchilada recipe, it is the best I have had since I first tasted it in Northern Italy, yes that's right, Northern Italy, it's amazing where recipe's originate. I visit the Lake Region of Northern Italy every year and next year I will discover what the Swiss/Italian population uses in place of the tortilla. I'll bet it is pretty close to the flour tortilla!

I thought these were pretty good, but this is the first thing I've ever cooked that my wife didn't like it at all.

I boiled the chicken and then cut into cubes. I couldn't find the salsa listed on the recipe so I used tomitillo salsa instead and also used the whole can of green chilis. This recipe came out really good.

Everyone I served liked this recipe but my son the Enchilada Suisa expert says it need more green and sauce and less cream (and I halved the amount in the recipe). Very good but I am going to continue looking for the perfect recipe for the expert.

Love this recipe have made it a few times and this time was by far the best.  I doubled the recipe but kept the cream amount the same and used flour tortillas.  It came out great.  My 3 year old always asks for these the next day for lunch when I make em.

My husband and son loved these enchiladas.  I thought they were just okay.  I think it was my fault though, because I tried those new "whole grain" tortillas and they tasted weird to me.  Next time will just use the good old fashioned tortillas, for EVERY enchilada recipe.

Very good!! I loved the cream with the enchiladas-I've never had them like this. I'm thinking of doing seafood like this instead of the chicken. My ten year old loved these. Thanks for recipe!

Wow-- these are fabulous! My boyfriend devoured them, saying they were the best enchiladas he'd ever had. I liked the idea of adding cream cheese (as if it needed more fat!), so I included some in the chicken mixture. I also threw in some thawed, chopped spinach. And instead of jack cheese I used Swiss. I also reduced the amount of cream by nearly half, and it was enough. Everything worked wonderfully and I will absolutely make these again.
