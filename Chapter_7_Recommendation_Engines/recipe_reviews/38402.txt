I just had to post a positive rating for this sauce because the previous reviewer cooked it and I think they were expecting this to be a traditional red sauce. You don't cook this one. It's called a sauce but it's more like juice. Being raised in eastern NC this "sauce" is used on pig smoked outdoors. It's great on a lot of things but you'll have to understand what this is to appreciate it. It's more like a spicy seasoned vinegar - traditionally used at pig pickins (google it if you aren't sure what a pig pickin is)

This recipe was waaay too vinegary. Try cutting it in about half. I cooked it for a long time and it was still too strong.

The best for pulled pork. We smoked a Boston butt and I served Chick and Ox's sauce. Very good on pulled pork sandwiches piled high with slaw and pickles.

I scaled the servings way down on this but other than that I made as is. I actually made several similar sauces like this to go with the whole pig I smoked for Thanksgiving and this one was my favorite. I preferred the sugar over the honey the other called for. This is definitely strong in the vinegar department so if you don't like things extra tart you might want to scale down.
