Well, my first time making, and boy I was impressed.  I compared recipes and many were similar but the quantities in this recipe were easy to acquire and assemble NO WASTE ie: only needing 1 tub of cheese, 250 ml (1 cup) of whippig cream etc. Only thing I wished being a virgin  TIRAMSU maker was to have a bit more detail about the importance of creaming the cheese before adding the egg custard, I did well but if wasn't perfect. So my tip would be to have the cheese room temp and use a heavy duty rubber spatula to work the cheese so it is soft and NOT curduy, but then again it could have been my brand of cheese.  LOVED THE RECIPE

This is a very good tiramisu. By using a zabaglione the problem of uncooked eggs is eliminated. Make sure to use sweet marsala. There is a recipe for ladyfingers submitted by Roxanne that is good.

I have made this twice and will make this again and again. VERY GOOD! I made a couple of changes I didn't have the Marsala but I substituted Brandy and the second time White Rum. I didn't add any alcohol to the coffee mixture there was enough flavour from custard mixture; also this is a good way to make so children and adults who don't want or can't have the extra alcohol. Instead of dusting with cocoa powder I grated finely bittersweet chocolate over top.  Did I say how Good this is well it is Really Good .Try this one and you may not go back to cheesecake, and I love cheesecake.

This is a wonderful tiramisu recipe. What most people don't realize is that the "store bought" or often times "restaurant served" tiramisu is a knockoff that leaves much to be desired. Tiramisu is meant to have strong flavors to be truly Italian. I make this every time my office has a "food day". It's gotten to the point that when word goes out we are having a potluck, I am bombarded with emails ensuring that I will be bringing the tiramisu. PLEASE NOTE - this recipe is meant to be made ahead of time and chilled, preferably overnight. Rushing this dish will result in your disappointment and in a crunchy layer of ladyfingers and lumpy cheese mixture. To properly make tiramisu takes time and patience. I am Italian and it has taken me years to perfect tiramisu because of the time involved to make it correctly. If you make this properly, between the chill times and actual work times, it should take about 3 hours BEFORE you chill it, which should preferably be overnight or at least 4-5 hours. If you take your time and are patient and ensure that your mascarpone mixture is lump-free, you will have wonderful success with tiramisu!

My first Tiramisu and it came out very well.  The only substitution I made was Kahlua instead of brandy for soaking the ladyfingers.  Delicious!

This recipe is very authentic Italian!  When we were in Italy a year ago, we tried many tiramisus...and this one is very much like all the Italian ones...and even better than some of those.  As far as the zabalione, and whipped cream layers, I added a little more, as the layers were a little thin.  So I use about 1 1/2 of everything the recipe calls for!

This wasn't as hard to make as I had originally thought. At first I thought the zabaglione tasted too "eggy" but when it was combined with all the other ingredients and left in the refrigerator for most of the day the final product tasted superb. I served it to friends (who I later found out were Tiramisu connoisseurs  and had eaten it all over the world) and they said it was very good. Now I don't have to order Tiramisu at restaurants...I can make it at home!

A bit disappointed. I served this anyway since I spent so much money on the brandy and the Marsala wine. I think the problem was that it tasted too "eggy". I would only add 4 yolks, not 5. Also, it did not have the light, airy taste of the cafe Tiramisu. I also recommend adding more than 1 TBS liquid to the lady fingers, it took a full day for them to lose their "crunch".

I hate it when people "redo" a recipe that they have given 5 stars, however I am putting in my two cents worth.  I am not sure that I have had a tiramisu before but it is my sis's fav so I tried it.  She loved it and said it got better over time. I am making it again for the second time for my step-daughter.

I used a 9 by 9 and made 1 1/2 times the mixture to fill my pan.  I used Godiva Choc. liqueur in place of brandy. I also grinded up dark choc and milk choc covered espresso beans and sprinkled on top along with the cocoa.  The soft ladyfingers from Trader Joe's worked great.

I am not sure if this is what true tiramisu is supposed to taste like, but I really enjoyed it and will make again for special occasions.

Thanks for the great recipe (and sorry for the revisions!)

If your dessert came out tasting "too eggy" you have overcooked the custard. Reducing the number of eggs from 5 to 4 will mostly effect the texture not the flavor.    Also, substituting mascarpone using cream cheese and sour cream may taste good but it will dramatically change the flavor characteristics of tiramisu. You will end up with a dessert that looks like tiramisu and tastes more like coffee flavored cheesecake but it will not be tiramisu. Tiramisu benefits, both in flavor and texture, from some aging in the frig. It is best served the following day.

I used this recipe for my virgin attempt at making tiramisu and it turned out great! I believe the zabaglione is the key ingredient because I made a portion of tiramisu without it, just as a comparison. The one without the zabaglione had a one-dimensional taste, basically just cheesy tasting, and was not as smooth. The ones with the zabaglione were better in terms of taste and consistency. 

I made this without Marsala wine because my family does not take alcohol, so I would assume with the wine, the taste would be even more complex. Because I omitted the wine, I added a pinch of cinnamon and substituted one cup of evaporated milk for the wine. The cinnamon was a good addition but make sure not to use too much or it will overpower everything else. 

My only issue was that this recipe did not yield enough cheese mixture and I ended up with a short tiramisu. I made 12 individual portions in 5x4” containers, with two fingers as the base but the amount of cheese meant and I could only get 1” tiramisus. I’m greedy and would prefer a taller tiramisu so if you want to make individual portions, make less than 12. Or double the amount of cheese mixture, which I will be doing the next round.

I always loved the way a local restaurant used to make this and always wished I had their recipe. I don't need it anymore. Your recipe would blow them out of the water! This ending to a Valentine's Day dinner was AWESOME! I am going to print several copies of this recipe and put them in all of my cook books, so I won't have to look far to find it. THANK YOU!

great recipe..although I like to add some vanilla so I used vanilla sugar to mix with the whipping cream instead of plain sugar and put a little more coffee/brandy mix to make the cookies more soggy.

I literally just got done making my first tiramisu. Anyways, I haven't tried it yet, but they don't sell mascarpone cheese in my town so I had to do the substitution by using the whipped cream, sour cream, and cream cheese. I tried the cheese mixture and it seemed too cheesecake tasting for my liking. The tiramisu I've ever tried has been almost whipped cream flavored. And it doesn't seem to have enough sugar. It just doesn't seem sweet enough. But there are a lot of good reviews. I hope it's good. I'm going to be trying it tomorrow after it has soaked overnight.

This recipe is over the top in all respects. When I make this recipe I arrange lady fingers in a flower pattern and hold the filling back 1 inch from the side of the pan. I also sprinkle grated semi sweet chocolate on each layer and on the top.You can't tell the  sub Mascarpone from the real thing.The Zabaglione gives it the classic taste that so many others overlook.

Very tasty.  However, only two stars because it seems to have been copied from the side of a package of Alessi Biscotti Savoiardi ladyfingers (even the Mascarpone Cheese substitute is there).

This was the very first Tiramisu I have ever made! And other than using Kahlua instead of the Marsala Wine, and Kahlua again instead of brandy, I did everything else the same. My family's eyes rolled back in their heads! My MIL, sister and mom who have never made it either, said that was THE recipe. Look no further. It is going into my recipe box on a 3x5 card! Loved it to the last bite!!!!

This Tiramisu was very tasty although it seemed to call for too much of the coffee liquid.  I didn't use all of the liquid and the bottom was still very soggy. I would make this recipe again and reduce the coffee liquid.

I was a little apprehensive because it seemed complicated, but it turned out great! I made 1 1/2 times the filling and used 30 soft ladyfingers split in half. This made 3 layers in a 9 x13 x 2 inch pan. I was hesitant to use a lot of the coffee mixture but used about 3/4 C of it. Next time I’ll use a bit more. Really 1C of coffee and Kahlua (instead of brandy)would be adequate.  I made it 2 days ahead because of my schedule. It turned out really delicious! Tasted like quality classic tiramisu from a good Italian restaurant.  I served leftover coffe/ Kahlua mixture and extra whipped cream but wasn’t really necessary.  Very rich and delicious!

DELICIOUS!!! AUTHENTIC TIRAMISU!!!  Chilling overnight a must for a perfect melding of flavors.  Marsala wine is an absolute must, used Kahlua instead of brandy.  This will be my go to tiramisu recipe - hands down!!!
One change to avoid lumpy cheese: before adding to whip cream, I blended room temp cheese with chilled zabligone on low speed, then folded into the whip cream.

My third time making this ! Only this time I'm making it to be eaten at a birthday party so I used the ladyfingers to cover the sides to protect the cake and tied a ribbon to secure It. I made it with an 8 inch round cake pan. 
I also ran out of brandy and marsala wine so I used kahlua instead. Used nespresso ristretto because that is my favourite coffee. 
My friends raved over this cake ! It is simple and so delicious !

I made this on a camping trip to serve 15 people and I only had an ice chest and a two burner camp stove to work with. It turned out very well and everybody loved it. I'd like to try the Kahlua version too.
