The trick to making this not get soggy is to drain the juice from the pineapple and put the fluffy topping directly on the top of the cake, then the pineapple and coconut  scattered across the whole cake.  My family has been making it that way for years and it's the most requested cake we make.  Also we double the topping and make it in a big jelly roll pan and use a butter yellow cake mix.  It's delicious and making it this way, it keeps well in the in the fridge for days.

This is a great dessert.  It's supposed to be a bit moist so DON'T drain the pineapple as someone suggested.  The whipped topping should be refrigerated, not frozen -- you just have to make sure that your cake has cooled before frosting with the topping/pudding mixture. Follow the recipe and you will not be disappointed!    I bake a lot of fancy cakes from complicated recipes, but my kids continue to request this one really often.  It's that good!

What a GREAT recipie! It was so simple to make and tasted fantastic. I made it for a luau themed party, and everyone could not say enough about it. You could easily get away with 1 package of pudding and 1/2 the cool whip bc it made a ton of topping. I wasn't too disappointed, as I just ate the rest!  The only thing I did differently was bake some shredded coconut and add it on top for appearance! Thanks for the instant classic!

I have made this cake countless times and it is always a crowd pleaser. I let the cake cool completely before putting the topping on to prevent the topping from becoming a big liquid mess. Also, when you make the cake itself, replace part of the water the recipe calls for with pineapple juice. You really get the pineapple flavor throughout.  I also top the cake with toasted coconut.

Darn this cake is GREAT! I did not think there was to much topping because the next day, you see that the cake soaks up most of it. I did however use only 2/3 of the milk the pudding directions called for. Definately poke them holes big to soak up the yummy flavor. This is GOOOOOOOOD!!

I suggest leaving this cake in the fridge for about one day, to really appreciate the taste of the cake. It's a good, light tasting cake.

My Family has made this cake for years. The only diffrence being that we mix half of the pudding mix with the juice from the pinapple and layer that first onto the cake, allowing it to soak into it through the holes and adding the pinapple to the whipped cream and the other half off the pudding for the topping and topping off with shredded coconut.. yum

We didn't really care for this at all.  And make sure your whip topping is FROZEN or you'll have a puddle on top of your cake!!!!!!!

This is by far a great easy cake!!!  The top review made it sound like that cake was going to be soggy... Well let me tell you what.  The only thing that I did do was to wait till the cake was completely cooled down (room temp) before you put the frosting (Cool whip and Jello Mix) I think that is the hidden secret. I did make some toasted coconut to go on the top of the cake.  EXCELLENT CAKE!!! A KEEPER!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you love this cake .. you will love the coconut poke cake... Try it!

This cake is delicious!!  I made some variations to this recipe. I used a lemon cake mix instead of a yellow cake mix.  I drained the pineapple slightly. For the topping, I used one pkg. of vanilla instant pudding and 1 pkg. of lemon instant pudding plus the 1 cup of milk and cool whip and I sprinkled coconut on the top.  It is very easy and has an elegant taste.  I loved this recipe!

Love it!  Don't be scared to pour the crushed pineapple and juice over the top (s) of the cake.  I made a multilayer so I split the can in half, poured the first half over the first layer with the holes, then put some of the whipped topping on top of that.  Then I did the same with the top and added the second half of the pineapple.  I let that sit overnight and the next day I put the rest of the whipped topping g over the entire cake as I was traveling.  Next time.  Everyone loved it!  Next time, I will use a Butter cake mix as someone suggested in the reviews to elevate it to another level.

The topping: follow the recipe exactly.  I read someone said it was watery?  I think I they followed the Jell-O recipe instead of the cake recipe.  When you mix the milk, the Jell-O will be pretty thick.  Then when you add the cool whip, it thins it out a little and gives the topping a nice flavor.  I did a vanilla and a coconut Jell-O together.  Just in case there were any coconut haters, it wouldn't be so overwhelming.  But just follow the recipe, it's tried and true.

This is a great recipe for a refreshing cold tropical dessert but this is how I do it:  We use a jelly roll pan 11 1/2 x 17 1/2 x3/4. Drain the pineapple and distribute evenly over cooled cake. Make your pudding using only 3 cups of milk. I use coconut cream sometimes when I can find it. Layer the pudding on the cake next. Then layer with a large container of cool whip. Then sprinkle with coconut. Never any leftovers.

made this for a Large family gathering and it was a huge success!  I used the golden butter cake mix and it was SO delicious.  not soggy at all but I didn't have the recipe in front of me and didn't realize I was supposed to pour the pineapple on while the cake was still hot so I did it once the cake had cooled completely.....but like I said, it turned out great.  will be making this again and again!

There were so many conflicting pieces of advice for this recipe!  Here's what I did:  I made the cake a few days before the dinner party and froze it.  I let it defrost overnight.  I warmed it for a short bit in the microwave and poked holes on top.  I drained the pineapple and put it right on top of the cake.  I mixed up the pudding mix, all the milk, and the thawed whipping topping.   I tend to dump everything into a bowl and it worked out fine.  I put toasted coconut on top of the cake. 

It was really delicious for our Hawaiian dinner menu.  It was also good several days later.  I guess that draining the pineapple keeps it from getting soggy.  If you want a stronger pineapple flavor, maybe used the drained pineapple juice as part of the liquid in baking the cake.

I am a chocoholic and consider anything else a second rate dessert.  But this is hands down the best cake I have ever made.  I bought the pineapple cake mix and instead of water I added pineapple juice to the mix.  Usually if it is not cake from scratch and Cool Whip instead of real whipped cream, my husband won't touch it.  I never said a word and he devoured the cake.  This was wonderful!! I will use this recipe a thousand times over...

It's great if you mix a little bit of the pineapple juice into the frosting and drizzle the juice over the cake before you top it.

My mom makes a cake just like this, except she calls her's an icebox cake.  It is yummy.  Its on of my dad's favorites.  You have to eat it when its fairly fresh, because after a day or to of sitting in the fridge it gets soggy.  I suggest taking it to a family gathering.

This is a great recipe. I made the cake for a fish fry I attended. The guest and especially the host/hostess enjoyed it. They were asking you didn't put sugar in it and its soooo good. now my husband is begging for an encore of this!!

This is a terrific fast cake to make.  Don't be put off by the pineapple, it isn't overwhelming at all.  This cake has great flavor and is wonderful chilled.  This cake is very similar to the popular "jello cake" =)

I changed the cake box directions. I used 4 large eggs, 1 stick of butter, 1 cup of whole milk 1 TBS vanilla extract.  I did every thing else the same.  Next time I will add pineapple juice & a small amount of pineapple to the cake mix . Just felt it was a very good cake just wanted more pineapple.

I added pineapple and juice to cake mix.  Then used banana instant pudding and heavy whipping cream for frosting.  1 cup of milk for pudding then mix with 10 oz of whipped cream.  Top with coconut and cherries.

This recipe was some what good. You can taste the pineapple and the coconut, but don't bake it for too long, it is hard to cut. It was also too sweet. I paired it with cool whip and took played down on the sweetness. Otherwise it was easy and fast to prepare. I gave it four, for taste and effort. Still got to work on rise on the cake, a cake has to rise from its shape, its consistency was more like a bar. Taste was pretty good!
