This should be called Ice Cream for a Crowd. I made the whole recipe but had to churn it in two separate batches. My ice cream maker couldn t hold it all. I churned the first half exactly as written while the other half chilled in the fridge. It sat in the fridge for almost six hours. I gave it a quick stir before churning it. This second batch came out creamier than the first. So I suggest chilling the mix before churning. The flavor is outstanding in both methods. I used vanilla paste instead of extract. Thank you for the recipe.

This was terrible. Too sweet didn't firm up in the ice cream maker. I've never had a problem with any other recipe. I can't figure out what happened here.

I made this recipe today for the 4th of July. it reminds me of the ice cream we made when I was growing up on the farm. So yummy. I made it exactly according to recipe. I will continue to use this recipe.

Underwhelmed. Even though I chilled before spinning, ice cream did not aerate or thicken properly. Flavor is decent, but will end up being more like ice milk when served.

I was the most grosses thing I put in my mouth. the person who made it must not have great taste and must have a mom who can`t make ice cream well.
