I use a recipe similar to this, except I use Yellow cake mix w/ pudding in the mix. And I use 1 C Tropicana Orange Juice with lotsa pulp. Everyone loves it! You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I thought 4 teaspoons of vanilla sounded like too much, so I used one teaspoon of vanilla and one teaspoon of lemon extract. I thought the cake was delicious, but I am the only one who ate it. Maybe there were too many other goodies around during Christmas, but it simply did not appeal to the rest of my family.  I would make it again and just bring it to my office to share.

I'm a pretty good cook, but my baking skills are remedial at best.  I was looking for an easy good cake, and this delivered!  This is a lightweigt, fluffy, yet very moist cake that was very easy to make.  

I used chocolate cake mix with the orange gelatin, simply becuase I like the taste of chocolate and orange together.  Next time, I might use orange extract in place of the vanilla to intensify the orange flavor, but that's just personal preference.  

Great recipe... Thanks!

I've made this several times. Used an oblong pan and iced it with orange cheese cheese frosting because of everyone's sweet tooth. It did great. Will make it again and again.

I'm not any sort of baker.  Once every few years or so I try to make a great cake for my wife's birthday.  This year I made this recipe because I wanted to try something we've never had.  The recipe was super easy and very delicious.

As someone else suggested I only used half of the vanilla and replaced it with orange extract.  Also I didn't want to use a bundt pan for a birthday cake so I used two 9" round pans.  Baked perfectly at 375 for 30 minutes.

For the icing I used 1 tub (16 oz) of whipped topping mixed with 8 oz of sour cream, 3/4 tsp of orange extract, and 2 cups of confectioners sugar.  Then topped with some candied orange slices.  Turned out really well although if I ever make it again I might try a chocolate based frosting for contrasting flavors.  Either way you can't go wrong.

I have now made this recipe several different times with several different flavor combinations.  White/orange, chocolate/orange, chocolate/raspberry, white/lemon.  They are all delicious.  The chocolate/raspberry turns out looking like a red velvet cake.  The combination of the jello and extra liquids makes it very moist and flavorful.  I have started using 2 tsp. vanilla and 2 tsp. extract the same flavor as the jello.  That intensifies the fruit flavor a little.  Delicious!

Made this for my church youth group.  It was a hit!  I didn't have a large box of jello, so I used the small box and used 3 tsp orange flavoring and 1 tsp vanilla. Moist cake with great orange flavor!

It didn't even need frosting it was so moist and yummy. Quick and easy! I used Orange juice instead of water and coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I will make it again!

Yummy!!!  I did make a few changes.  I  used orange cake mix along with adding 1/2 cup of oj/tangerine juice and a few tablespoons of triple sec.  Loved the orange flavor of the cake!!

This cake was moist and a big hit for my Mother's birthday! I tweaked it a little bit, by substituting  orange juice with lots of pulp for the water.  Will definitely be a recipe that I keep.
