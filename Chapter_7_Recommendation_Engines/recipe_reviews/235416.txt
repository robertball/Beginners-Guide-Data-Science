This bread came out very well. I made the dough in my bread maker and then let rise for a half hour and then baked for 30 minutes at 350. I had to add about another 1/3 cup of water to the dough when mixing, but that happens when making bread sometimes. I upped the yeast to 2 tsp as the amount called for seemed like a small amount for whole wheat bread. I loved that this bread was not crumbly, even several days later. Thanks to the submitter for a nice whole wheat bread recipe.

This is a simple whole-wheat bread that has a mild sweet and sour taste which I really liked.  The texture is hearty but not dense. I'll definitely make it again!

Most of this loaf is going to be made into vegan stuffing for a Thanksgiving potluck. I substituted vegan spread (Earth Balance "Original") for the butter in the recipe. It had no effect on the delicious flavor of this bread.
