My Aunt made a version of Dream Squares when I was a kid and I loved them. This recipe is pretty darn close. I made one small change. I increased the cherries to 1 cup and reduced the choc chips to 1/2 cup. I love cherries. Keep a close eye when pre-baking the crust. I sometimes cook it a few extra minutes if it looks too soft. It shouldn't be brown just not look completely raw. I have made this many times trying other fruit/nut/choc combinations. It is great with white choc. I made a version with chopped apricot white choc and pecans it was very delicious but I did add a Tablespoon of white corn syrup as the topping looked a little dry. A great recipe to play with. My next try is with candied pineapple. I haven't decided which chips to use. Probably white but I think butterscotch might be nice as well.

I must be doing something wrong because these did not set at all! The top remained a gooey batter. Mind you it smelled delicious and tasted good too (I couldn't help myself) I definitely didn't want to serve them to company in that state.

This is a good base but definitely needs much less chocolate and a lot more cherries. I would say half the chocolate and double the cherries. I think if you were to sprinkle the chocolate on you would have a better idea of amount needed. But it did have a good base and the gooey cherry and chocolate was really good.
