I came to this site expecting to try several quiche recipes, but started with this one and haven’t strayed since…THANKS DAWNROBYN.  This is remarkably easy and tasty and I have been able to make it work in many variations…so here goes:
1. Yes, the Hormel/Oscar Meyer Real Bacon is perfect for this.
2. Swiss is good for the first time, but don’t be afraid to try gouda, cheddar, or any hard cheese you like (add 5-10 min cooking with cheddar).
3. Don’t leave out the (approx 1/3rd Cup) parmesan/romano cheese even if you’ve changed the swiss, it helps add to the creamy texture of the final product.
4. Adjust onions to taste; oldest daughter wants none, I want more. Scallions give it a very rich onion flavor and the frozen chopped save time, but fresh Vidalia is best.
5. I’ve also discovered frozen chopped red/green peppers, these needed to be chopped a bit more finely.
6. I have found that adding frozen ingredients adds to the cooking time (“duh”).
7. Add ½ tsp of salt & pepper to taste to the eggs and cream.
8. For vegetarian, I’ve used approx 3 oz of spinach (cooked in 1T water and drained) OR approx 3 oz of frozen broccoli florets instead of bacon.
9. For just a few cents more, I’ve found the Marie Callendar’s frozen pie crusts to be the best for this.
10. Right now I am making one with 2 oz frozen broccoli florets AND 2 oz bacon with cheddar cheese & frozen chopped onion.  I let the pie crust, onion, and broccoli sit out of the freezer for 1 hour first…Pefrect!

Hint:  use the Sargento Parmesan/Romano shredded cheese, NOT grated parmesan cheese.  You can really use any kind of cheese you prefer.  Also, use the 2.8 oz. bag of Oscar Mayer bacon PIECES (available near bacon bits- but DON'T USE BACON BITS).  Finally, to make it easier, Ore Ida makes frozen chopped onion (makes everything go quicker to not have to chop onions).  Truth be told, you can use any cheese or other ingredients that you like in your quiche.  It is very versatile! Hope this makes it easier and tastier!!

This was a very very easy quiche to make, I was a virgin quiche baker (lol) and it came out FAB!!! I will definitely add this to my rotation of recipes. I added sauteed fresh mushrooms and green peppers. I used minced onions that I rehydrated since I didn't have an onion on hand and I used an Italian cheese blend. I followed all the other posts suggestions as well. I would like to note, though: place foil around the edges of your quiche when you bake it so the crusts don't overbake!!! Make this...it is simple and yummy!!! :)Thanks to the originator!

This quiche is so quick and yummy! I usually just make it with a bag of shredded Italian cheese and leave out the onions because my kids don't like them. I also use the Oscar Meyer bacon pieces instead of bacon bits, or I use real bacon. And to keep the crust from getting too dark I wrap it with a bit of tinfoil. Thanks!

This recipe is simply and easy. I like to saute the onions first and add a 1/2 tsp of fresh grated nutmeg. I also use 8 strips of crispy bacon instead of bacon bits.

I just loved this quiche. Hadn't made one in years and decided to try again at hubby's prompting. Although I like swiss, it seems like it's often too strong in quiche, so I followed the recipe except used sharp cheddar in place of the swiss. Also I cooked the onion in EVOO (crisp/tender) first. I used an unroll and bake crust, layered in the cooked onion, cheeses (real shredded parmesan) and bacon pieces before pouring on the eggs as directed. Baked up perfectly, and was so tasty I couldn't stop eating it. I plan to add other ingred's in the future - maybe some cooked mushrooms or sundried tomatoes! And it was soooo easy and quick. This will definately be one of my regulars from now on!

This quiche was just as described easy and delicious!  Added in some mushrooms and used a smoky swiss and cheddar blend which gave the quiche a wonderful flavor. Also added my standby Tony Chachere's seasoning to give this a bit more of a kick. We found that the measurements for the cheese, onion and bacon mixture made quite alot and was enough for two quiches.  Not a problem, we are happy to make another one tonight!

This recipe was a hit!  My husband said it was one of the best things I have ever made him.  I did change the bacon bits to six pieces of real bacon and I used about one and a half cup chedder cheese instead.  I will be making this recipe again...tonight!

I've been making this recipe for over 30 years.  My family and I don't like Swiss so I used shredded cheddar (bagged if in a rush- just as good!) and I always crisp fry and crumble my own bacon (I don't like canned bacon, just a personal preference).  Over the years I've added - broccoli floretts, fresh chopped tomatoes, mushrooms, substituted ham for the bacon.  I've turned it 'Mexican' by using Pepper Jack cheese and fresh Jalepenos from the garden with salsa on top or baked in.  It's a great 'Base' recipe and allows your creativity to come thru beautifully.

This recipe came out great!!! Funny thing is my father is a chef and he questioned the preperation and cook time but I decided to try it anyway. I actually made 2 different types..one with bacon (pre cooked worked great), red peppers, onion, and italian chz, with a couple scallions on top...the other with mushroom, spinach, canadian bacon, and FETA! Sooooo good! The second one was everyone's favorite, even non mushroom lovers. I sauteed all ingredients first with seasonings. (Make sure spinach is squeezed really well, no liquid.) I wrapped foil around crust to avoid burning but be careful if any egg has touched a spot it will stick to the foil. Anyway, my father had his chef knowledge ego checked a little and I had 2 types of quiche that was a hit at the company breakfast on Friday!! Woo hoo!! Thanks! : )

Easy recipe, altho I didn't have bacon bits, swiss cheese or onions.  LOL!!  I cooked 6 slices of bacon and chopped them up, used colby/monterey jack instead of the swiss and one tablespoon of onion powder.  I also added black pepper.  Very yummy and will definitely make it again!

I made my own crust last night and set it in the fridge to roll out and form this morning. I used cook thick-sliced hickory smoked bacon that I cooked and crumbled and evaporated milk instead of cream, only because that was what I had on hand. Very simple. The kids always love "pie" for breakfast and my husband and I get an omelette, sort of. Next time, I think I'll add more "stuff" but tasty as is.

I've been making a similar version since the 70s with rave reviews each time. The basic recipe is 4 eggs with 1 cup of cream (anything from lofat milk to heavy cream works- it's just a matter of how rich and decadent you want it to be) with a bit of Lawry's seasoning salt and ground black pepper.  The crust can be homemade, or bought. If I don't have time for homemade I prefer Pillsbury's pop out crusts (deli) vs frozen. Put in whatever fillings you like- meats, veggies or cheeses. My favorite is campari tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and basil leaves.

Great recipe! I add bacon from the salad bar at my local grocery store. The nice people there have already cooked, drained, cooled and crumbled the fresh bacon for me! All the taste and none of the mess!

I have made quiche so many times with this recipe (2 or 3 times a month) and have to say that this is the perfect base recipe! Couple of notes - the recipe doesn't specify but I recommend a deep dish crust. Also I have made mine with milk every time as cream isn't a regular item in the fridge - I add an extra egg too since milk isn't as thick as cream.  Don't forget to wrap thin strips of foil around the crust so it doesn't burn.  Our family favorite is minced garlic, green pepper, diced sausage links, with provolone cheese, and parmesan sprinkled on the top before cooking makes a crispy golden crust on top. Super yummy. Thanks for posting!

My husband is a hard man to impress, but as soon as I served him this quiche, he about fell off his chair.  He couldn't believe the flavor!   I made a few changes to an already excellent recipe.  I sauteed my onions, using a cup raw, along with fresh spinach, salt, pepper and a teaspoon of fresh garlic.  Didn't have 1/2 and 1/2 so I used half 2% and half sour cream.  A little salt and pepper to the eggs and .....viola!  Delicious!  Can't wait to mix it up with different ingredients.  Oh, and by the way, this recipe serves 3 happy eaters...at most!

I changed this up a bit and it came out awesome! First I fried up about 1/3 lb fresh bacon. I used the pre-chopped frozen onions, which I sauteed in the bacon grease. I added 4oz cream cheese to the onion to melt and then mixed in the cooked bacon and 1 cup sharp cheddar. I spread the mixture on the bottom of the pie crust. I mixed together the eggs and 1 cup milk, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Then, I poured the egg mixture into the crust and mixed it up a bit so the onion/bacon/cheese mixture wasn't just stuck to the bottom. Followed the baking time and it came out perfect! Very nice flavor. I will definately keep this recipe on hand.

I really enjoyed this recipe and after a few tries made the following changes:
Substituted fat free evaporated milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2, tasted great did not notice any difference but a lower fat option.
Substituted ham instead of bacon.
Lightly pan fried onions, Portobello mushrooms and broccoli.
This recipe is very forgiving and will lend itself to many delish combinations. Also, freezes very well, warm up in an oven.
Thank you for sharing !!

I was really skeptical about baking this without per baking the pie crust, but it came out wonderfully. I did have to cover my edges because I prefer them a lighter brown. The egg to cream ratio makes a perfect light base for your ingredients. So much room for customization. Thanks for a wonderful recipe I will always keep on hand.

Delicious and easy to cook.  We added frozen spinash.  Sauteed with half an onion and added the bacon and cheese together before putting into pie crust.  Added 10 mins onto the cooking time and put under broiler (low) for 3 mins to brown the top.  Was absoultely delicious!

A winner. I used Vitamin D milk because that's what was on hand. Very tasty, thank you.

My family found this quiche to be just okay. We used cheddar in place of swiss and added real bacon. I think where it went wrong for us was the parmesean. It was just too strong. If I make this again, I am going to cut down on the parm or cut it out all together.

I used 6 slices of real bacon and then just crumbled them after I cooked them.  I used cheddar instead of the other cheeses and I used whole milk instead of half and half.  I omitted the onion and added spinach...so pretty much I changed everything!  But this was a good base recipe for a person who made quiche for the first time!

The recipe is a good start. I do not use bacon bits, buy precooked bacon and crumble or cook some earlier in the day or even the day before and use that, I use 3 slices of low sodium nitrate free bacon. Second you need a little seasoning, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper should be a good start and please sauté the onions first, the caramelized onions add a completely different flavor (mellow) which you need with Swiss cheese. And I added about 5 minutes to the bake time (at 350) to get the middle to set. Lastly you MUST let the quiche rest 10-15 minutes for it to fully set before slicing.  This reheats great if there is any left.

My thirteen-year old son made this for dinner tonight.  Made it exactly as written except he used real bacon (7 slices crumbled up). Came out perfect and tasted great!! Pie shell went in frozen (sat on the counter 10 minutes during prep). Next time, I would saute the onions a bit to sweeten their flavor and I would add some spinach for color. But this is such an easy, tasty recipe using things we always have on hand. Highly recommend.

I love this Quiche. I am retired,& I make this for my wife & her fellow nurses when they have a special Brunch. They never leave any leftovers. I use Microwave Bacon,& it comes out great. I also substitute Heavy cream for part of the Half & Half when I have some to use up. Tastes terrific! knfan47

There many ways to make this recipe your own.  Add a little of your favorite hot sauce to the eggs.  maybe a touch of Italian seasoning.  What ever is your favorite.  Also when pouring the eggs in do it over the back of a big spoon & that way it will spread out evenly & not create a big dent in the middle.

Holy cow, my husband INHALED this! Our 14 yr old daughter made this (w/my help : ) - we baked it on a Sat night and reheated slices Sun morning. When I came downstairs, 2 pieces (both, hubby's!) were already gone, and he ended up eating one more before I finally put it back into the fridge. Only thing I'd change is cooking time/temp - was a bit overdone for me. Just made another one, cooked it 45 min at 350 (added fresh spinach and a can of drained mushrooms that needed to be used up.) Thx for recipe! **Update: made again this weekend, trying to use up multiple cheeses, but out of half-and-half. Subbed evap milk for 1/2 and 1/2, and used up some cheddar, mont jack and blue cheese crumbles - RIDICULOUSLY good! My fave quiche!

This was my first attempt at quiche and it turned out perfect! I did change a few things though: 8 ounces of cheese seemed like it would be too much, so I used 6 instead. I also used freshly cooked bacon instead of bacon bits.  I will sautee the onions first next time, as they did not really seem to cook. I also added a bit of white pepper.
I can't really fault the recipe as it's written - I'm sure it's just as yummy - so I'm still giving it 5 stars.

I love the idea of the bacon bits.  I always use cooked bacon in my quiche, but it gets 'soggy'.  I throw in some fresh spinach or any other veggies I have on hand.  Nothing is beter than a bacon quiche and a salad!  Thanks for the idea.

This recipe is easy as named, and gives you a moist, delicious quiche; it also gives you a lot of opportunity to experiment with different ingredients.    I used half Gruyere and half regular Swiss cheeses; I also prefer to use shaved Parmesan rather than grated.  Try adding 1 cup of cooked frozen spinach ( be sure you squeeze it dry) and sliced mushrooms (saute with the onions).......delicious!

This quiche recipe was great! I usually throw in some broccoli in my quiches but I have to say I did not miss it here. I did make a couple of modifications though and I think they really pushed this recipe into the 5 star category. Firstly, instead of using bacon bits I cooked thick cut bacon in the oven at 400 degrees seasoned with fresh ground pepper and dried rosemary until crisp (about 25 minutes). I also used skim milk instead of cream because its what I had on hand. Finally, I didn't have any grated parmesan so instead I used a shaved parmesan/reggiano blend that I had on hand. Oh, and I beat the heck out of the egg/milk mixture! Makes it nice and fluffy. The results were magnificent!

I thought this was a great recipe.  I am not a big swiss cheese person so I used a mix of italian blend, mexican blend and a little cheddar (not too much because of the amount of oil that sometimes results from cheddar).  I believe that the best part of this recipe is that it is totally versatile.  Do what you like with regard to the meat and cheese and it should probably turn out well.  This time I used sauteed onion, salami, ham, and crispy bacon (chopped up, of course).  I would definitely make it again and I would use whatever I had on hand for the meat/cheese ingredients.  I found that when I doubled the recipe and added 2 extra eggs, plus 1/2 cup additional half and half, I was able to make two large quiches.

I made this for Christmas breakfast and it was a definite winner!  This is a wonderful base recipe and it's so easy to add whatever you have on hand to suit individual tastes.   I used minced leftover ham instead of bacon, added minced sweet pepper, and added black pepper and garlic powder.  I substitued skim milk for the cream and added about 1/4 cup (maybe a little more) of light sour cream to make the mixture richer.  If you're watching your cholestorol, you can use egg substitute successfully instead of eggs or a mixture of eggs and egg substitute. Everyone went back for seconds!

As I type this, I am eating this loveley Quiche. I've made this a million times, and absolutley love it. The only change I would make is 1 oz. more bacon, and the flavor is much more prominent.I also use cheddar cheese instead of the cheese recomended, it turns out great. I just love this, it's really easy to make, and the only thing I don't like is how long it takes to cook! :) Absolutley FAB!!!

This is a great recipe that you can fix as listed or "tweak" to your liking and personal taste.  This is the first quiche I have made and it turned out great! I did change it slightly as I did not have cream, so I used cream cheese as someone else had mentioned.  I just added a bit of milk and heated it in the microwave long enough to make it creamy and added it to the eggs along with minced garlic, a pinch of salt and pepper as well as a bit of onion powder as I did not have an onion either.  I used cheedar, a bit of mexican blend and fresh shredded parm.  I covered the edges of the crust with foil for the first 15 minutes or so (its easier to do when the dish is cold instead of hot!).  When I removed the foil I added a bit of grated cheese to the top of the quiche.  It turned out wonderful!  My daughter loved it and says that now quiche is her favorite food - even over pizza!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I took this quiche to a brunch and it was a huge hit!  Suggestions I took from other posts:  I used the Oscar Meyer already cooked Real Bacon Pieces;  1/2 c. mild Rotel (spoon it in so that you do not make your mixture too watery); 1/3 c. Sargeanto Parm/Ramano cheese; Marie Calendar fronzen pie crust (other brands crumbled very easily).  It was good because even the mild Rotel has a little kick to it and added interest to the taste and texture.  So good...they will ask you for the recipe.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  This was my first time ever making a quiche and I was very happy with it.  I did have to bake it an additional 10 minutes longer then the recipe stated for it to set in the middle.  I also followed other reviewer advice and used real bacon PIECES instead of bits and used a combination of cheddar and italian blend shredded cheeses.  I also covered the edges with foil to avoid burning.  Using the frozen pie crust made this super simple and fast.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe, but for those other men out there that are new to the cooking arena, please remember to remove the white paper sheet from inside the bottom of the ready made crust.  It begins to appear like frost, but believe me when I tell you it is not.  It bakes well when left in place, but the taste of the paper surely spoils the deliciousness of the quiche.  lol

Made using real bacon and cheddar jack cheese instead of Swis,  and evaporated milk instead of half and half. Delicious recipe, even my picky eaters ate it!

HEALTHIER OPTION STILL DELICIOUS!  I used skim milk instead of half and half, and it still turned out light, fluffy, and tasty!  I also switched the swiss for a monterrey/cheddar mix, sauteed the onions, and used real bacon.  I also followed the recommendation to cover the pie crust edges with tin foil after 20 minutes or so, and it turned out great!

I used a bit of cheddar instead of parmesan. I also added onion and some diced ham. It was spectacular and my boyfriend and I now have a new favorite recipe to make together.

This was FAST, EASY, and DELICIOUS! I lightly sauteed mushrooms and onions before I added it, and I used sharp cheddar and Sargento Italian blend (it has Romano and Parmesan in it), and it came out WONDERFULLY!! I'll definitely reuse this recipe!

This quiche is delicious! My boyfriend loves quiche and he loved this one! I tossed in mushrooms and bell pepper and used colby chesses and parmesan. It was delicious. I've made it several times since and everyone loves it. Oh and once I made it with ham and it was great. I like to add more bacon than the recipe calls for also.

good recipe.  I used the cheese I had on hand...cheddar, mozarella and a little parmesean.  Used ff evaporated milk and real pan fried bacon slices crumbled up.  Added a little salt and pepper since the cheeses I used were more mild...turned out nicely.  thanx!

Wow.  Great recipe for customizing!  I had some leftover bacon/cheddar cheese and wasn't really thinking about quiche, but this caught my eye.  Only 2% milk available, but had some leftover sour cream (used 1/2 2% and 1/2 sour cream as called for) - Followed the rest of the recipe and it came out bang-on!  So well that I made it *again* the following night.  Really great.  Thanks!

I have made quiche the hard way numerous times, but this is almost as good and so much less work! The only minor change I would make is to thaw the pie shell, poke fork holes all over it and bake it for 10 mins on 400 degrees to prevent the crust from getting mushy. I made two of these for breakfast on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, but they both were devoured on Turkey Day!!

I had two small frozen pie crusts that I wanted to use up in order to have fresh ones for Thanksgiving so I looked here on allrecipes.com and chose this one.  I divided the filling into the two pie shells and baked for the stated time.  It turned out perfect.  I had never tasted quiche before as I feared it would be like a custard (which I really, really don't like) but it was more like the consistancy of an omlet with cheese, bacon, and onion.  On a crust no less.  If I'd only known this years ago.  This was so delicious I can see myself making this once a week and I can't wait to make it for my friends. Thanks for the easy recipe.

Wonderful recipe.  I did add some asparagus (only because it was on it's last leg in the fridge) and a few chopped artichoke hearts, again just because I needed to use them.  Served it to a friend for lunch and she raved about it.  I did separate everything except the eggs into to pie shells as I thought there was too much for one.  Then just doubled the eggs and half and half and made two quiches.  Kept one and sent the other home with my friend.  Thanks so much for sharing such a great recipe.  It definitely will be going into the "keeper" file.

Pretty decent recipe for how easy it is.  The first time I made the recipe I followed the directions.  The second time I made the recipe I added a 1/2 cup of bisquick to the egg and milk mixture in place of a prepared crust to save some fat and calories.  I also used 2% milk in place of the half and half.  I thought it still tasted great.  For added nutrition I added some chopped spinach.  Great versatile and yummy recipe.

I made two quiches, one with bacon (real) and gruyere/swiss cheese and one with frozen spinach and cheddar. I didn't have deep dish pie crusts, so I left out one egg and used less milk (I didn't have any cream). They both turned out lovely, but a little bit bland. I would increase the cheese next time and use some more seasoning. Overall, very easy and good!

I followed DAWNROBYN's advice regarding the Sargento cheese (I used the 4-cheese variety) & Oscar meyer bacon pieces. EXCELLENT ADVICE! I added a small can of Rotell and small jar of sliced mushrooms to give the quiche more of a omlette-y feel. I also made both a "milk" and "half&half" version of the quiche. It's a great recipe and helped me discover how flexible a quiche can be!

This was great. I used real bacon pieces from the pouch, cheddar cheese only and added black pepper. I used 3 eggs and a shallow pie crust. We enjoyed this on our Sunday morning! Thank you.

very good recipe! the measurements are a bit off though, it was nearly enough to make 2 (which i did). i used 6 pieces of real bacon cut into pieces instead of bacon bits, and a mozarella and parmesan cheese mixture instead. i wanted to make this for friends, but alot of them got sick after eating it. turns out one's lactose-intolerant, one's vegetarian and didn't do a good job of picking the bacon out, and the other one's allergic to eggs. but regardless, i thought this recipe was delicious and will be making it again. its not often you find a recipe so easy even a college student has time to make it.

(revised edit) I made it exactly how the recipe calls and I think it needed some tweaking, at least for my families taste. So, I made it a second time and it was out of this world for a simple quiche!!! Instead of bacon bits, I cooked about 6 fresh bacon strips. I just put the bacon in the oven at 400 degrees (since you have to preheat oven anyway for the quiche) and cook it “well done” so you can crumble the bacon. I also found Swiss cheese to be tasteless so I omitted the Swiss and put in shredded SHARP cheddar cheese, Fontina cheese and a hand full of Parmesan cheese. For the CRUST, I used store bought 'graham cracker crust' (because that is what I had) and it made this dish so much better... the quiche was savory and salty-ish and the crust was sweet... it went together perfectly!

I used real bacon and because I forgot to buy 1/2 and 1/2, I used some diluted sour cream. It was delish! Will make this again.

Works great for the basic info. I used a refrigerated crust, freshly cooked bacon, sautéed onions in 1 Tb of the drippings, whatever shredded cheese I had on hand (cheddar, mozzarella, Parmesan). Delicious!

Heavenly Dah-Licious! Nom Nom!
Made this recipe in a flash with what ingredients I had on hand. Once you start making it, you quickly realize how many substitutions and variations are available to you here, to make this a dinner recipe even. You get a soufflé style middle, with delicious flavors in every bite you take.
I chopped, seasoned up and grilled some super sweet onion first, in about 2 tablespoons of the leftover bacon grease, as I cooked up my own bacon (gotta get it crispy) and I cooked up six slices. Who wants fake bacon bits?! But if that's all you've got the cabinet, use it! 
I then added the bacon cheese mixture. using a jack and pepper jack mixture with the Parmesan. The little kick of heat was nice. You could even add a can of diced green chilies (drained) to this, and it would be amazing! 
Go light on any extra salt ingredients, because the bacon and the Parmesan add a great deal of salt on their own.
I didn't have half-and-half, but I did have a half a cup of heavy whipping cream, which I mixed with milk to make a full cup of half-and-half!
All of the substitutions were perfect! 
My mother always taught me to keep a piecrust in the freezer. And I choose the Marie Calendars pie crusts. They're delicious, and you get two in a package. If you don't have time to make your own crusts, start keeping one in the freezer! 
You'll be surprised by the things you begin to make, just because you have a piecrust in the freezer! 

This blew my Som away!! Who says real men

I almost never cook but today I wanted to surprise my husband with a special dinner.  (He likes to say that I burn cereal.)  So I thought something with bacon would be a good idea, and then quiche came to mind.  I found and followed this recipe, and had great success!! I used cantaloupe as a side and my husband absolutely loved this meal. 

I used the Oscar Meyer Bacon Pieces,  Sargento shredded Parmesan, Sargento shredded Swiss, Publix half and half,  Pillsbury pie crust (they didn't have Marie Callender), and cage free eggs. I left out the onions. I might try adding broccoli another time but it didn't need it. I let it bake an extra 10 minutes because it wasn't quite dry or brown after the initial baking time. (Might be due to my older oven.) This is a very delicious and filling meal, and super easy to make and clean up afterwards. Thank you!

The first time I made this I followed recipe exactly and no one in my family liked it. There was too much onion flavor, didn't care for the pre-made bacon bits and it was very dry. Also the bottom crust was soggy. The second time I used fresh cooked real bacon, sauteed the onion in the bacon fat, and blind baked the crust for 15 min first. Baked at 400 for 10 min then reduced heat to 350, covered crust edge with foil and continued cooking for 20 more min, (35 min is just too long and dries the quiche out). Wow...what a difference. I can't give it 5 stars because the original recipe did not turn out as well as my own (after tweaking it).

Solid recipe. I used cubed ham (what I had on hand). My crust on the bottom came out a bit soggy and was actually better the next day.  I served this with a spring mix salad with balsamic dressing which was a good counterpoint to the dairy. Will make again.

I made this for the second time tonight. The first time I rated it high and saved it as my "go to" quiche. I made it again tonight and didn't like it as much. I realized that my first attempt, I read the recipe wrong and left out the onion. When I made it tonight, I must have been more careful and included the onion. Even at 1/4 cup (I reduced it), the onion was too much for my family. This went from a pleasant, mild, "bacon and egg-y" dish to too heavily seasoned in just that one ingredient. I even like onion, never cook without it, but I will be modifying this from now on to leave it out. 3 stars, too much onion as written.

This was an easy dish, but I felt like it was lacking something, maybe spice or green chiles. I used real bacon, cheddar cheese/mexican blend and whole milk instead of half and half.

My husband and I made this recipe but used a pound of bacon instead of the bits for a double batch recipe. It was delicious and our family really enjoyed it for our brunch!! We noticed that it cooked better in a clear glass dish versus a darker one (just an FYI). This will also be our go-to quiche recipe as it was a crowd pleaser!!

It was my fault it was very runny.  I added mushrooms and peppers not knowing that I should cook them first.  So it was my fault. The recipe was very easy I wish I'd had followed the directions.

This was a quick an easy weekend breakfast.  I used cooked and crumbled bacon rather than bacon bits, but followed the rest of the recipe closely.  The quiche was light, fluffy, and just creamy enough.  Perfect!

Very---Very Good !!!  I Decided not to use bacon bits, took a pound of bacon, cut it up and fried crisp, doing it this way it fries up perfect in no time.  After bacon was done and oil drained from pan I fried the onion for a few minutes just to soften them.  Besides the first 2 differences I followed recipe exactly as written.  Its an excellent quiche.

This recipe is a great base for quiche. I added bell peppers to it which was yummy. My husband and I wish we had some salsa to top but it really was great. I baked my quiche using a thawed pie crust and it was fine. Also I mistakenly mixed all the ingredients together before adding it to the pie. I thought I would have ruin the recipe but it was perfect. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy recipe but used real beacon then carmalized onions in beacon grease not healthy but soo good.  Also used leftover cheese had on hand some Gouda,sharp cheddar and a little white American. Added dried chives,freezes dried garlic,salt pepper,paprika sprinkled on top with McCormick Parmesan herb seasoning. Had to foil the edges since needed to cook little longer with extra cheese I added with extra egg but great base recipe. Also added 2 tble of gravy flour in cheese mix since I hate soupy quiche was perfect

This worked for me. Quiche is all about the right texture after it is baked. Only changed the bacon bits to real bacon. Otherwise bake time was perfect with covering the edges of the crust for about 1/2 the time.

Amazing!  Only thing I would do next time is pre- saute the onions or substitute onion powder.   They seemed to float to one area and were still a bit crunchy for my taste. Other than that this one is a keeper!

I used this recipe in a cooking class for 13 and 14 year old girls. They were very excited with how easy the recipe is to follow and how much everyone loved their quiche. They left the class vowing to make this quiche for their parents!

This is a great starter recipe.  I make it with the parmesan and a mix of reduced-fat cheeses (2% cheddar and reduced fat swiss), use a whole wheat crust from the organic store, and substitute 2% evaporated milk for the half-and-half.  You cannot tell the difference from using half and half (which I started with).  My kids love it too.  Next time, I am going to try non-fat evaporated milk.  Seriously, there is so much cheese in here, you will never know the difference.  And please use real bacon (no nitrates if you are inclined to buy that but not necessary).

Turned out great!  Left the onions out--just felt too lazy to cut them up.  Added some chives on top, which gave it a little color.  Good recipe.

Just enjoyed this wonderful quiche. My husband thinks it's the best yet. Used red onion rings on the bottom instead of chopped, added some freeze dried chives and used 2 eggs and 1/2 cup fake eggs. Didn't change the half & half, tho! Wonderful. Thank you for sharing.

It's really good and easy but I think the crust should be baked first.  It was a little off-putting to me that the bottom of the crust was clearly uncooked.  Just cover the edges with foil if it's getting too brown while baking.  Otherwise it's great :)

What an outstanding quiche!   I made a few small changes: I used 6oz. of bacon, chopped it up, and fried it along with the onion (drain the excess fat off!) before adding it to the cheese mixture.  I didn't have any half and half, so I used 1/2 c. of skim milk and 1/2 c. of heavy cream. Other than that, all I did was add a little salt and pepper to the egg mix, and it turned out absolutely delicious! My husband and I devoured the whole thing. We'll definitely be making this again, and soon.  Thanks, DAWNROBYN!

This turned out great and my 10 yr old DD did all of it except cook the bacon (we used fresh, not canned). We also made this and used Smoked Gouda & added mushrooms and it was fantastic!!!

This is a delicious quiche. I found that I had to bake it for 20 more minutes than what the recipe called for, but that may have been because I didn't mix the eggs and half-and-half well enough. Served it with a simple side dish of grapefruit segments with a light sugar coating.

A Quichetastes so good! With salad it's a full meal. Add any kind of vegetable in and it's even better! But this plain form is just as delicious! With some beer it's a winning  A+!  I make it with yeast dough, got used to itthat way and love it. Do not have it often - not your healthiest meal :-/

Very good flavor combos. Proportions fit perfectly in the deep dish size pie plate. Home made crust is better and plenty of room to get creative with different ingredients.

We found the recipe to have too much onion and not enough bacon.    Next time, we'll reduce the amount of onion and saute it.

We had company for many breadfasts with visitors at our home so I needed something I could prepare the night before other than the typical sausage egg casserole.  This was great esp for people eating at different times in the morning.  Just slice reheat in micro and it is ready.

Amazingly delicious and wickedly easy! I chose to use the pre-cut and rolled pie dough, but you could use a frozen, in-the-pan crust too. Just whipped it all up per directions (I did add chopped onions to the cheese mixture) and baked. I also baked it about 8 minutes more than the recipe said. I am sure that it just my oven though. I covered the edges of the crust with foil when it started to brown too much. Easy, take-along breakfast!

I made a couple changes to this recipe- 1) Instead of bacon bits, I used 6 strips of bacon, crumbled.  2) I used cheddar cheese in place of swiss/parmesan.  It was so delicious!!  I also made a second quiche- instead of bacon I used brocolli, so yummy also!!  Can't wait to make this again!!

This is the first quiche recipe I ever attempted and it was so easy and delish, that I have made it several times since. I am not exactly a "natural" in the kitchen but in all honesty, this is probably one of the best quiches I've ever had so it's clearly the recipe dimensions!!! Go DawnRobyn! I do use real bacon (about 5 slices of the precooked, which I just throw in the microwave), and I also add in a handful or so of chopped frozen spinach which I think adds to it. I have used Swiss cheese as well instead of Parm and it's been excellent. I pretty much use whatever cheese I have on hand. 
You cannot go wrong if you use this quiche recipe as your base. It's fantastic!

We tried this recipe at my brother-in-law's house after they had sworn up, down, and sideways that quiche was so difficult that even they could not get them to work properly.  But we were determined to have quiche so we, the cooking novices, took on the challenge.  It came out perfectly and it has come out perfectly every time since.  We love how simple it is to prepare and how well it turns out.  Two tips: cheddar adds extra tastiness (although it makes things a bit salty) and NEVER use "bac-os" instead of bacon bits.  Or as an alternative use little ham chunks.

Quick and easy quiche that the family loved, however, I do suggest using real bacon. I also subbed with fat free half and half and it worked just fine. Thanks!

This was great!  I was online looking for quick and tasty recipes and this certainly fit the bill.  I didn't have Swiss cheese so I used Monterey Jack instead and the results were excellent.  I know may people won't like bacon bits.  The easy solution is to use real bacon pieces which can be found in resealable bags next to bacon bits in the market.  I had the entire recipe mixed in under 10 minutes.

The Swiss flavor is a bit overpowering. I think next time I’ll use half as much Swiss and try cheddar for the other half. I also added sautéed fresh mushrooms and baby spinach.

Great!  I didn't have half and half, so I substituted milk.  I also didn't have Swiss, so I used what I had, which was packaged "mac and cheese" combo and mozzarella - I used half cup of each, forgetting it was supposed to be 5 oz.  In one I used the bacon, for the other I cut up a piece of kielbasa and spread it around the cheeses.  I did add a bit of salt and pepper to the eggs, though I probably didn't need to.  Older daughter wants me to make these every week.  Now that I know how easy it is, I will definitely do it more often.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added chopped bell pepper in addition to the chopped onions.  I also added Tony Cachere's, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder and salt to taste.  This turned out fantastic!  I will definitely add to my list of favorite dishes.

My family loved it! I made it with ham instead of bacon. Crust was a little dry, next time I'll probably try a refrigerated crust instead.

This is an excellent, easy quiche. I have made many quiches through the years, this is very good, and very versatile. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly except used real bacon rather than bacon bits. The next time I used different cheese and 2% milk instead of half and half. Have continued using the milk and different cheese (cheddar is my favorite). Also have included sautéed mushrooms. 11/27/18 today I sautéed the onions in  a little bacon grease, then added chopped broccoli. Yum yum

I had never made a quiche using a frozen pie shell so I had set out looking at recipes to see if I could use frozen.  I came upon this one.  Of course like any cook I made it my own.  It is a good basic recipe.  I used 4 eggs and 1 cup liquid. as in the recipe, but mine ended up being 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup raw goats milk.  I used about a 1/3 of a cup sauteed diced onions, 4 slices of thicker baked bacon crumbled , half a pkg of frozen spinach, thawed and drained, 1/2  cup grated Swiss and about 1/8 tsp of grated nutmeg and a few turns of the Trader Joes Everyday Spice mill.  I did put foil around the edges to keep them from over browning.  The great thing about quiche is that after you have the basics of 4 eggs and the 1 cup liquid, you can put in pretty much whatever you like.  great way to use leftover veggies.

Very good and easy quiche recipe. I adjust measurements slightly differently than the recipe, such as less onion, more Swiss cheese, and adding another egg to fill out the dish more. Cook time usually is closer to 20-25 minutes on 350.

My first attempt at making a quiche turned out delish! Improvised by using about a cup of shredded sharp cheddar, and crispy bacon pieces. Instead of half n half I used 1 cup 2% milk. Chose not to add onion or any other chz. Used what I had on hand and my picky family loved it! Yay me :)

This quiche recipe is absolutely delicious! I followed the directions exactly on the first one, then on the second quiche I substituted bacon bits for all natural chicken sausage links that I diced into small pieces. My 5 year-old said "daddy this is absolutely perfect!"

My first Quiche ever and it was a hit!  I have always wanted to make a Quiche and so I searched the web for an easy Quiche and found this one.  I took the basic recipe and made a few changes ... I used freshly cooked bacon (baked in oven at 400 till just right), an 8 oz pkg of shredded cheese, added chopped tomatoes, and sliced mushrooms.

We have now had this for both breakfast and dinner.  My family loves it.

Just made this for a Christmas brunch for friends. I used the Pillsbury crusts that you roll into your pie pan.
You can find them in the refrigerator at your grocery, (not frozen). I did not bake at 400 to start because I was not using frozen pie crusts. I baked at 350 for 35-40 min. until they browned slightly on top and a toothpick came out clean in the center, using glass 9"pie pan.  I also used real bacon that I crumbled up before mixing with other ingredients.  It came out excellent..very tasty.  Everyone raved about how good it was.

love!!! btw, you can substitute half firm tofu blended with half plain almond milk for the "half and half" and can substitute hard goat cheese for both cheeses. (easier for the lactose intolerant peeps!)

I used the bacon pieces as suggested by other reviewers and it overwhelmed the quiche plus it made it so salty.  If I had to do again, I would use less than half the bacon and half the onion.  In any case, I will try again with no bacon or onion and use mushrooms and salt and pepper and see what happens.  Quite frankly, I am not a big fan of strong tastes like bacon and onion and if I use them, I use in moderation.

I was stuck for something to make for a brunch at work and had little in the house but plenty of eggs. Quiche! I threw together a pie crust and found this recipe. I only had microwave bacon and a 3/4 block of cheddar. Halfway through I realized I didn't have cream so I used whole milk. I used about a dozen eggs to make up for fewer ingredients and doubling the recipe. I can't tell you the compliments I got! Light and fluffy and delicious! The lab director called it "freaking awesome!" Thank you!

This was a great dish. It wasn't quite as good when the leftovers were reheated, though. Still, I'm glad I resisted the temptation to eat it all right away. I made it exactly as written. I'd used those refrigerated rolled-up regular pie crusts in other recipes, but I think this was the first time I'd ever used a frozen deep-dish pie crust - I found them easily in my store. With the given time, the quiche baked up perfectly, and was very attractive to boot. Well worth recommending!

It doesn't get any easier than this.  I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now.  My husband prefers it with diced ham, but anything works wonderfully with this recipe! Try different cheeses and spices - lots of room to play here!

I tried this recipe, but I substituted the eggs with egg whites.  I also used almond milk instead of half and half cream.  I used cheddar and mozzarella cheese and still the recipe came out great. I also used low sodium bacon, chopped frozen broccoli and added a dash of nutmeg.

I hate onions so I did not add them.  Love the bite of the Parmesan cheese to an otherwise classic quiche.  Love this recipe and it is so quick to make on a busy work day evening.  I have made this twice.  My son wasn't too excited about it when I told him what I was making.  However, the last time I made it...he ate it all except the piece I ate.  Good stuff!!!

I love this recipe. Instead of the bacon sometimes I replace it with smoked salmon and chives keeping the Parmesan/Romano with it. I've also used asparagus and sliced tomato with Swiss cheese. It's a lovely quick weekend meal or I use it for an entree when having visitors.

Good basic starting recipe. I used real bacon and sautéed the onions in the fat. I made them into minis, baked at 375 for 22 mins. As the other comments stated it was kind of bland-needed something else, maybe garlic? Will try again with spices!

By all accounts, (and based on the reviews/comments of several others) I have found my quiche recipe. Or at least a definite keeper. (There are just very few recipes I have only one of...you know how it is!) Very quick and easy -- with a very tasty pay-off, too. I can see major room for improvisation here as well, which is good. I usually try to make a recipe "as written" at least once at the off-set, but I was NOT able to get my hands on any Swiss tonight (and I was too tired to consider a LOT of shopping around), so I opted for a mild cheddar with an Italian parm blend. Added some applewood smoked bacon and a frozen pepper/onion blend. VERY nice.  I was a little afraid I was going to overflow the pie crust, but turned own to be perfect (Marie Calendar deep dish, as someone else suggested). The Hubbs also gave it a thumbs up. Will definitely be adding this one to the arsenal. Thanks for a really good recipe!

I made mine with cheddar cheese mix, real bacon-about 5 pieces diced and fried and I also sauteed the onion in the bacon grease before mixing the bacon, onion and cheese together. I also added some garlic powder to the mix. Really great flavor and a great general recipe that can easily be adapted to your own tastes. Only gave it 4 stars because it didn't really work for a quick weeknight dinner, took too long.

OK.  Bacon was a little chewy.  I think I prefer somethng other than Swiss cheese.

I substituted cheddar for the swiss and used real bacon instead of bacon bits. We had to make two of them to feed my family because they kept getting more. This is great and easy dish!!!

Excellant flavor, added fresh spinach and used a mix of cheeses that I had on hand. Did saute the onions with a couple cloves of garlic in butter before adding to the eggs. Also used homemade crust as I don't care for frozen. Will be making this recipe again and again.

This is going to be my new "go to" quiche recipe!  
A big hit tonight with our dinner guest.  I didn't have 1/2 and 1/2 so I used half heavy cream and half r/f milk, crumbled bacon (not the canned bits), chives and Italian cheese blend.  It was perfect!  Thank you, Dawnrobyn, for this recipe that I could use as a good base to create a tasty dish!  I also made another one that I froze using ham, onions, spinach and swiss cheese.  I used the cream cheese/milk in place of the 1/2 and 1/2.  Really anxious now to see how that turns out.

Made this tonight. Something quick and easy to go with my "breakfast" dinner...it was great. Just the right amount of flavor and with real bacon it added just enough texture. Will def do this one again.

I double the eggs & cheese and  just mix everything together and its perfect. My family likes it with sliced cherry tomatoes, mushrooms & little chuncks of ham, and I throw in some dried chopped onions and Mrs. Dash.  I served these beauties at Christmas brunch for company and everyone LOVED it. So easy to change up ingredients, to suit your family's tastes. *****

5 stars for great tasting easy recipe.  I needed it bigger so I just tossed in more of everything and it still came out perfect.  I've made quiche before and it has never been so easy.

I haven't had quiche in years, remembered that I liked and thought I'd try this.  I made two, one with bacon and cheddar and one with ham and swiss.  They cooked for two hours trying to get the middle to set.  It just seemed like the stuff wasn't cooked and of course by then the edges were burned.  Thanks and it might have been me, but I won't be making this again.

My friends loved this easy quiche on a lazy, rainy Sunday afternoon.  It helped stretch the few eggs and bacon I had on hand and satisfied everyone's hunger.  I substituted low fat milk and added 2 TBSP sour cream along with real bacon and herbs from my garden.  YUMMY!!

Wow!  I'm newly married & just learning to cook & this recipe was SO easy and SO good. :)  It's actually the first thing I've cooked/baked that I'm proud to say I made! I did use cheddar cheese instead of swiss, but stayed true to the rest & it was great.  Some said the filling was too much for the pie crust, but I disagree.  It fit perfectly.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I dont know how fair my review is because I was looking for just a basic quiche recipe for a bridal brunch I was having so I did not follow this recipe exact.  I picked this recipe because I thought it looked pretty simple and I could easily alter the various veggies and cheeses.  I ended up making 5 different quiches using this basic recipe and slightly different fillings in each (Spinach, mushrooms, bacon and other stuff) and they all turned out great.  I had added tons of fillings so I was a little bit worried when I saw how much cheese was in the recipe but they were all great and VERY PRETTY (Sorry no photos). This will be my standard recipe from now.

Impressive! I've had trouble with Quiche in the past, and this was easy! I did cook up my own bacon, but only because I was already cooking it for a different recipe. I substitued Provolone cheese for the Swiss because I had it on hand. I also shredded fresh Parmesan from a wedge, and added a couple of cloves of garlic. It was a hit!

This is really delicious. The only changes I made were to lightly sautee my onion first and I used 6 strips of real bacon cooked crispy. Next time I make this, and I defintely will, going to use a little less cheese and add some italian sausage. YUM

This recipe is easy to follow and the quiche is easy to cook. And it tastes delicious! I had NEVER baked anything extravagant, let alone a quiche! I'm a 17 year old and known for not being a very... aware cook, but when I found myself alone for dinner I looked up this recipe and surprised everyone! I used green onions and substituted cheddar for the swiss. I made and used my own bacon (I just can't trust preserved bacon...) and I made my own crust! This recipe is a true keeper!

I'm a quiche rookie and this turned out perfect. It tasted great and was a hit. I used a blend of italian cheeses and some cheddar. Will definitely make it again!

This is a great recipe.  I used fat free half-and-half and about 3oz Swiss and 3oz Parm cheese.  The pie crust is completely full before putting in the oven, but it bakes down a little as shown in the picture.  It was delicious.  We are already planning on new additions to the recipe since it was so easy.

We took one bite and discarded the entire quiche... I think the problem was the bacon bits. Should have known better.  Next time I would definitely use real bacon slices instead and I'm sure it would have been delicious.

I have never made quiche before, and have only ate it once, many years ago, on a airplane - so you can imagine how that tasted.... but this looked and sounded very good, and it was.  I used real bacon, cuz I had it.  I used a non-frozen handmade pie crust, cuz I had it.  I used a new tomato basil cheese blend, at least I had never seen it before.  This was very yummy.  I have to say though, my DH wouldn't try it.  That whole 'real men don't eat quiche' thing was playing some sort of subliminal message I think, but he will come around, and he will love it too.  Thanks for sharing. - Just an update.  I froze the leftovers and we had it for breakfast, and DH loved it.  He asked what it was and I said it is like a bacon & cheese breakfast pie.

this is an excellent, easy recipe. Using bacon bits saves time and adds wonderful bacon taste. I use what cheeses I have on hand.

It was a great recipe. great flavor and texture. I modified the recpipe a little bit. I used 2% milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and I layerd it instead of mixing it together. I will definately  make this again.

This was my first time making quiche and my boyfriends first time eating it. I made it for breakfast with a few variations. I omitted the onions (my boyfriend doesn't like them), used chedder and evap milk instead (its what I had on hand) and used cooked bacon. It was really good except that it overflowed, luckily I had a pan under it. Next time I will only use three eggs.

This was excellent.  It was super quick to make. I made it for dinner and it was very good, but it was superb the next day for breakfast.  It also brought back memories of my favorite quiche in a San Franciscan restaurant.  Great recipe!!

Very good, very easy.  I use about 4.5 ounces of bacon instead of the 3.  I also go heavy-handed on the swiss cheese (maybe an extra ounce).  Overall, it's bomb-proof and and popular.

Long time user of allrecipes...first time reviewer!  This was so easy and simple that I just had to say so. Not only easy, but fantastic tasting!  Used foil on the pie edges until the last few minutes so that it wouldn't burn.  Will definitely be one of my go-to recipes for breakfast, brunch or anytime!  Whole family loved it!  Thanks!

I love this recipe.  It is quick and easy and tastes so good.  I added a can of well drained crab meat and fresh spinach and cooked for 10 minutes extra. My family of four really enjoyed it.  I will make it again and again.

I don't normally like to stray too much from the orginal recipe but this time I did. I made this for my newlywed cousin and his wife for their first breakfast together and they loved it so much they didn't even bother with plates. I added 1/2 can of Rotel tomatoes with chilis, omitted the individual cheeses and just used one bag of Kraft 3 cheese shredded cheese and I used real bacon crumbles from the salad Isle. Fabulous and well, well worth it. Make sure you bake it on a cookie sheet to catch any overflow. I continue to make this over and over.

This hit the spot! My very first quiche ever turned out to be awesome! I used red onion instead of yellow and this turned out to be fabulous! Definitely put foil around the edges of the crust while baking. The crust was amazing!! I also used a shredded jack/cheddar combo for the cheese.

Not the best.  I didn't have parmesan, so I used 8 oz. of swiss.  Everything else was followed.  I am trying to find a quiche recipe that I had made before but this wasn't it.

The first time I cooked it, I made it as stated. The second time, I used precooked bacon (Bob Evans, most of the package), evaporated milk (cuts down on the fat), same cheese, and green onions- Still tastes great!

Made this for an office lunch which we had today.  It was fantastic!  Every bite was eaten.  Very easy to make.  I used real bacon which I cooked in the microwave - perfect for crumbling up!  Next time I think i'll try using cheddar instead of swiss.

I really thought this was good. Nice texture and nice flavor, however, I thought it was missing something, maybe some more seasoning of some sort. Overall though it was a good dish, will make again.

I made variations of this for Easter brunch and everyone loved it.  I made a ham, mushroom and onion one and changed the cheeses in it.  Even my kids who can be picky eaters ate it and asked for more.  The recipe is quick and easy to produce and there were absolutely no worries with it.

Great recipe.  Super simple and tasty.  The only thing I might do differently next time is add a bit of dijon mustard.  Maybe!  It was really good this time though!

I have only made two quiches so I am not a pro at it, but I followed the directions and I had a hard time getting the egg mixture to set and the crust never did cook.  I did use cheddar cheese with the other 2 cheeses and the taste was great.  I just wish it would have cooked better.

Used this recipe as a base.  This was my first quiche and it turned out very good.  I only had milk on hand, and used cheddar/jack in place of the swiss cheese, plus I used real bacon.  Still very easy, light and fluffy, with a good flavor.

Instead of bacon bits, I fried 8 strips of bacon and chopped them up.  Used Cheddar Cheese in place of the other cheeses listed in the recipe because Cheddar is the only cheese I had on hand.  Everyone LOVED this recipe and even with frying the bacon, it was incredibly easy with outstanding results.  With the changes I made, I had to rate this a five. Will make this again and again!!

Very good!  On the bottom I layered mushrooms then a layer of swiss cheese then frozen, chopped spinach then cheddar cheese then cooked bacon pieces (not bacon bits) then shredded (not grated) Parmesan cheese.  To the egg mixture I added some onion powder (I didn't have any onions), salt and pepper.  Even with all the extras, 4 eggs and 1 cup 1/2&1/2 was plenty.  Thanks for sharing such a versatile recipe!

This was a really good quiche!  We didn't have any premade crusts so we made our own and it was very tasty.  We also opted to cook the onions before putting them in the quiche and it added a lot of good flavor.  This is definitly a recipe that I recomend for a brunch or even a lazy dinner.

This quiche was wonderful. Even my husband who is very picky ate it. I suggest using Oscar Myer real bacon bits and to make it easier use onions already chopped. It would be good to use chopped ham also, which you can buy already chopped.

Bacon bits do not taste very well in quiche. I think the Parmesan cheese was a mistake, at least for my family.

Will definitely make again.  Great recipe to use as a jumping off point.  Instead of the swiss parmesean combo I did the Kraft Mexican cheese blend that includes 4 different cheeses.  I didn't have a 9 in-DEEP DISH pie crust so I used a folded Pillsbury crust (thawed) in my Deep Dish stone baker.  Baked at 375 for 45 min.  My dh was very pleased, which is tough!

Was looking for an easy and quick quiche and found this one. It came out perfect at settings specified. I was short the Parmesan so I just used the Swiss, threw in a little cooked breakfast sausage. I will be making frequently?...added some pics

Love it! Great basic recipe that you can adjust to fit your taste. I’ve made it quite a few times and used Pillsbury pie crust, 5 eggs, an entire 4.3 oz package of Oscar Meyer Real bacon bits, any cheese I have on hand (it’s been good with Swiss, Cheddar, Italian Blend), added 1/2 cup of green bell peppers. It feeds my family of four for breakfast.

I tried this recipe for my first ever quiche- very delicious!! My family prefers cheddar so I used that in lieu of Swiss. Other than that, I made it exactly as written. Very easy and such a confidence booster, I’ll now be adding this as one of my go-to brunch recipes.

Easy recipe to make and it's delicious. This is also a great base recipe. I have used a different mix of ingredients, spices, and types of cheese and just kept the same egg/half and half ratio.

This quiche was awesome.  And, yes, easy.  I sauteed my onions first with a clove of minced garlic.  Used a pre-made pie pastry, put into a 10-inch pie dish, and flash baked for 12 minutes at 425F.  Mixed salt, pepper and a little thyme and powdered sage into the eggs.  All else as written.  Cook time and temperature were spot on.  Delicious!

I made this quiche for a gathering and it was simply delish! I made my own pie crust  and bacon bites. I just cooked the bacon and then put it in the food processor [you can use a blender also if you don't have a food processor].  I can't say anything bad about this dish!  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!

Made this for a brunch with our Grandson and his new bride.  It was a hit and I will make it again, very tastey.  Didn't have any half n half, so used whole milk and added 3 more eggs.  I made one of the pie crust with spinach and bell peppers.  I sautés the onion with garlic as one other suggested.  Was too much for one pie crust but not enough for the second, one reason for the 7th egg.  Just added a little more milk and another egg.

Very yummy!  I used a homemade thawed pie crust. I also sauteed the onion with some yellow peppers in some olive oil before adding.. Next time I'll add some fresh spinach and wilt it and add it to the quiche. My husband and son loved this too!

It was good.  Sauteed onions and a few large mushrooms.  Also while bacon was cooking in the oven, I baked the frozen pie crust for 10 min.  I don't ever use pre-cooked bacon.  Will make this again.

This recipes is good as is, but it's also a good basic recipe to add veggies and small amounts of various meats.  After eating a couple of pieces, I decided to freeze the remainder in individual portions...it worked well.

I have made this several times, comes out really well. It is also a great base to start if you want to change it up with different ingredients.   I make them to have on hand for several meals during the week when I am in a rush.  Heats up surprisingly well in the microwave

I added a little salt and pepper to the eggs mixture,  used "real" bacon bits, sharp shredded and shredded parmesan cheeses., as well as fat free half and half, and it was delicious.  Rave reviews from the family!  So easy.

First time I made quiche.  This recipe was very easy and I received compliments from my family.  I added a little diced red pepper to this recipe.  I also made a vegetarian version using cheddar cheese instead of Swiss.  My husband said this is a keeper.

This is an excellent quiche which is quick and easy to prepare. I omit the onion as my husband doesn't like them unless they are fried to almost black!  I use fresh parmesan and white cheddar.  I have made this quiche using bacon bits and also left over ham  and both are delicious.  This is my go to recipe for quiche...it is very good.

This was an ok recipe. I used real bacon and Monterey Jack cheese  but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I thought there were too many eggs in this as I like my quiche more creamy than spongy . It had a good taste but the texture was not what I was looking for. I may try this with less eggs and see how it turns out.

This was so easy and delicious...  Only thing different I did was layer my cheese first then added a little fresh mild salsa mix to my bacon then poured the egg mixture over it. Baked for 30 minutes on 375. Perfect. Now I have a go to dish for school teachers functions. (Btw I also made a sausage one with fresh baby spinach on top)

This is a good basic recipe and then you can customize it for your taste.  I did not have swiss cheese so used a 4 cheese cheddar with some Parmesan mixed in.  I also used half of the half and half and the rest I used milk.  Whole family enjoyed it!

This was a hit at our Father's Day breakfast. Also make a version with frozen chopped spinach (thawed and drained well), Feta cheese instead of swiss and Parmesean.

This was wonderful, even though I change almost all of it!  My first quiche making.  I had my own homemade pie crust. Used Evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.  Used real bacon, fried crisp.  Added some Sharp cheddar to the Parmesan and Swiss cheese.  I will make this again!  Definitely.

This was the first quiche I made all by myself and I loved it! Instead of using onions, I used 1/3 a cup of butternut squash. Instead of using half and half, I used half a cup of heavy whipping cream and half a cup of almond milk. I also used a 1/3 a cup of three different cheeses. It was devoured in minutes. Definitely will make it again!

Turned out great!  My husband doesn't like onions, so I sautéed some chopped broccoli florets instead.  So good!  I didn't have half and half, but 2% milk worked fine.  I can't imagine it any richer.

Thanks for a great recipe...but I made changes with ingredients based on what I had.I used two frozen pie crusts, 4 slices of thick cut bacon that I diced and cooked in a skillet, put to drain. In a little of the drippings I sauteed half an onion. I microwaved a bag of broccoli, pressed the water out of half and chopped up. In the pie crusts I added half the bacon, onions and broccoli. Over that I sprinkled cheddar cheese. I mixxed 6 extra large eggs with about a cup of sour cream, salt and pepper. Poured the egg mixture evenly over both our crusts. Baked as recipe directed, they were perfectly done about 25 min after I lowered the heat. Yummy and plenty of leftovers!

When I first made it the crust, I used 1st Street Brand from Smart & Final, came out mushy and uncooked.  My family didn't care for the raw onions still a little too firm and had a bite to it.  Otherwise had great flavor.
    The second time I par baked the crust, using the same crust as before, at 375 degrees for 20 mins covering the edge with foil. I sauteed the onions with bacon  bits until translucent, let cool. Then I proceeded with the recipe. Keeping the foil around the rim while baking to prevent from burning. This time it came out delicious!
    4 stars is because I judged it by the first time I made it exactly as directed.  And after my adjustment it's now  a 5 star quiche.

I modified this recipe slightly. I cooked up about a 1/2 pound of real bacon, pulled that out of the pan then tossed in the onion and a small head of broccoli flowerettes (sp?) and cooked for a few minutes just to soak up the bacon flavor. From there I put all of the ingredients into the pie shell and baked and it was absolutely delicious!!!

Easy to make - made with cheddar and Parmesan cheese and cooked the onions first.  I didn’t add salt, but did add paprika to it.  Was a hit with everyone that tried it, will definitely make again

Made this quiche with 4 slices of real bacon, chopped up. Did not have a frozen pie crust, so used a refrigerator
one.
Very good recipe.  I would add some salt and pepper.

I made this recipe as written except for adding a 1/4 tsp salt and pepper, and got two thumbs up all around. It's yummy, easy, and has good flavor. I was surprised that the crust wasn't soggy! I used a stoneware pie plate and will definitely make it again. Obviously you could vary the type of cheese, meat, etc. if you wished. I plan to experiment a bit, using homemade crust and bacon cooked in the microwave (between two double sheets of paper towels to make it easy and no messy cleanup) instead of bacon bits and frozen crust, just to see how it changes the flavor and texture, but it's great as-is.

I made it TODAY!!!!! It was a huge hit. I used fresh bacon and went a little heavier on it because we are all big bacon lovers. My husband's only comment was to add more cheddar cheese next time than the recommended amount. No more buying quiche for me-this recipe made me a pro!

Very good egg to ingredient ratio.  I have to admit though I used cubed ham instead of bacon since that's what I had in the fridge.

This quiche was sooooo good! I used turkey bacon cooked crispy and crumbled instead of the bacon bits, and a combo of shredded sharp cheddar and "pizza blend" cheeses (it's what I had on hand). I also added a pinch of nutmeg and paprika to the egg mixture. This is a great basic quiche recipe that could probably be used with a lot of different ingredients. Will be making again soon, and I'm going to try adding some finely diced jalapeños next time.

I've made this a couple of times. Have varied the cheeses, made it with potatoes instead of onions, but original recipe holds well compared to the adaptations. Great base recipe for a quiche with your own twist. Nice to have an easy weeknight meal.

Love the versatility in this quiche! I was planning on making it as written but my swiss cheese seemed to go missing so had to change that. I did fry up bacon slices and crumbled in the bottom of the dish. I loved the fact I could use a frozen pastry shell with no thawing time needed. A thumbs up from Hubby!

This is the second time I made it and this time my family inhaled it.  This time, I used Havarti cheese instead of swiss and fried 6 slices of bacon and a small Vidalia onion instead of bacon bits and uncooked onions from the recipe.  When your family doesn't talk because they are too busy shoveling the food down, you know it is good.

My 12 year old made this, with supervision, and everyone loved it. Bacon, broccoli and cheddar went into it. The "Little Chef" didn't know what a quiche was until today. It's now our go-to Sunday brunch recipe.

Loved this recipe. I made it for my family tonight, and it was great. The crust wasn't so good but not as a result of the recipe.

This should be 3-1/2 stars;  I liked it, but it lacked zing.  Maybe more sharp cheese, or some hot pepper sauce.

I have been making this quiche for years and it turns out great every time!  Recently I switched to using all organic products, including the piecrusts, which bumped the overall cost of making this up quite a bit...mainly because of the pie crusts.  My local Wegman's stopped carrying my favorite organic frozen pie crust and so I was stuck...I needed to make a quiche that night for dinner but had no crust.  Remembering a recipe for a "crust-less" coconut custard pie, it occurred to me that I might be able to do the same for this quiche.  So, to Dawn's recipe I added 1/2 cup of all-purp flour to the egg/half & half mixture and poured that into a greased and floured glass pie dish.  I baked as normal.  It turned out fabulous and my kids actually like it better without the crust!  I have found since doing this multiple times now that I cut the baking time by about 10 mins as it seems to set up faster without the frozen pie crust.  Might not be the same for you but for me, this has been better so that the top isn't too browned.  PLUS, now I don't have to buy those expensive organic pie crusts!

What I love is this is such a versatile recipe. I can use bacon or ham or sausage or just vegetables like mushroom and asparagus quiche. I like to add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the egg, you could add garlic or nothing. So versatile

Loved this quiche, but used real bacon fried crispy. Turned out amazing. I even made this without the pie crust in a glass pie dish and it was still great!

I made this using fresh bacon, fried and diced rather then bacon bits.  I didn't have any half and half so I use half heavy cream and half whole milk instead.  I used fresh grated Swiss cheese but only had dry powdered parmesan cheese so I used that in place of the grated parmesan cheese.  Otherwise followed the recipe as stated.  I've got to say we were both amazed at how good this tasted and you can bet I will be making this quiche again and again.  Next time I'm going to add some fresh mushrooms, a little bit of diced bell peppers and a little bit of chopped fresh spinach.  Maybe even add some diced ham as well as the bacon.  Love how you can add a few other ingredients to suit your families tastes.  I think I could have gotten away with adding one more egg and the mixture still not boil over.  Tastes so good!

Great recipe! I add drained frozen spinach as well, and it's fantastic! I use to make this with a graham cracker crust to add a hint of sweetness, which was great. However, since I can no longer tolerate gluten and am always in a rush for work in the morning.....I sprayed a muffin pan with coconut oil and made a tray full of mini crust less quiches. It's an amazing breakfast for throughout the week, that I can pop in the microwave real quick and eat on my way out the door! Love this recipe, thank you!

This was very easy to make and even my picky 9 year old loved it. There wasn't quite enough egg mixture to fill up the pie so I added an extra egg and abou 1/2 cup of whole milk. Other than that followedthe recipe exactly. It was delicious and it looked pretty too.

The bacon bits add too much salt for my taste, and I like salty food. Next time I'll try sausage crumbles instead.  But very easy and quick recipe.

I've made this three times now and by itself it's a pretty good recipe.  I've made some minor alterations and now I can even get my kids to eat it!  
I started off by changing bacon bits to bacon pieces and swapping the Swiss for cheddar.  I also added salt and pepper.  I feel like that's really missing from this recipe.   A small alteration that made a huge difference.  I sautéed  the onion with  mushrooms next.  Better still.  Then  I added the green onion and it is now sublime.

This is a quick, simple, and pleasing quiche recipe.  Made four for a church breakfast.  I used real bacon but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  This is definitely a good recipe if you need to make a lot for a crowd because of it's simplicity.  Plan to make it again.

Excellent and easy! I cube Spam instead of using bacon bits and add mushrooms. You can add just about anything to this dish and have it turn out great! I end up adding so many other things I have enough egg mixture for two quiches!

This is a delicious quiche recipe, and after reading some reviews made minor adjustments to the original recipe. I cooked fresh bacon and when crisp, cut it into small pieces. I added 1/2 cup of fresh mushrooms, and sautéed these, along with the chopped onion in a bit of butter and olive oil before combining the ingredients. I also used Cheddar cheese in place of the Swiss. I made the recipe the day before serving the quiche, and it reheated beautifully.

This recipe is excellent, thank you for sharing!  I did make it with some alterations.  I added a chopped green pepper and canned chopped mushrooms.  Sautéed them in olive oil with the onion and added to the mix.  Also added salt and pepper for additional taste.  Turned out excellent!  Will make again and again.  :-)

Changes; added green onion instead of white. Mostly for looks. I made a 2nd batch, put cheese/onion mixture into cupcake pan, poured egg about 2/3 of the way up, and made individual quiches with no crust. My kidlet can grab from fridge and eat on the go. Better than any egg-whatever on street. I added some medium cheddar to individual quiches too. For dinner, I pull out a few quiches, heat up some crusty bread and viola! Easy dinner! Just cook/steam a green veggie and it's done. Love this recipe. MM

I didn't use bacon bits, instead I fried up some rashers and chopped them. I swapped out the onions for leeks. Good recipe that you can play with. I would use this recipe again as a base.

Very nice. Recipe makes enough cheese/bacon mixture for 2 frozen deep dish pie shells so made 2 batches of egg mixture using 4 eggs and only 1/2 cup of half and half in each batch.  Hubby really liked this.  Served with side salad and cantelope slices w/cottage cheese.

I love this quiche it is so simple anyone can make this. I did add too much salt this last time around but now I know for future reference it doesn't need it. I got the Marie Calendars frozen crusts and they work perfectly!

Great recipe. Tiutned out great except for  bottom crust still raw due to cream - made it a little runny.. I'm cutting the cream to 1/3 cup and cooking the bacon1st. Also added muchrooms which I'm cooking 1st next time.

I made this in muffin cups instead of a pie crust (made about ten muffins), and added about 5oz of chopped broccoli. Cooked them for ten minutes at 400 and then eight more minutes at 350...they were amazing!

I have made this four times now and this is the base for the best quiches I have ever eaten besides the best I have ever made! The custard that is created with the eggs and cream is heavenly.  It makes me feel like a "French Chef".   I make it with 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cups half and half. I always use refrigerated pie crust and I pre-bake the crust at 400 degrees for 10 minutes to avoid a mushy crust.  Our favorite so far, is a combination of ham,  Swiss cheese, as well as  fontina cheese with lightly sauteed asparagus and onions added with the cheeses to the crust. The recipe is very forgiving so add veggies as you wish.  If you have enjoyed quiche, this one will be a prized recipe.

thought this was easy - surprised that the frozen pie shell got brown & flaky - usually I prebake it but wasn't necessary with this recipe.    was little salty without adding any - probably bacon & cheese.  would use less bacon next time but was delicious as is

Amazing!!!! I actually made two versions of this at the same time since I had bought breakfast sausage for another exile but decided not to do that recipe.
I did add a 5th egg for a better consistency. I also used fresh bacon as I am not a fan ever of using bacon bits. 
Second one I used, I used cheddar instead of Swiss, fresh bacon and also 3/4 lb of a jimmy dead breakfast sausage. 
Delicious!!!!!

Excellent dish. Made it for Christmas Eve breakfast. Subbed in Gouda instead of Swiss, real bacon, and butter/whole milk for a half and half substitute. My wife loves it and I definitely will cook it again.

I made 2, used real bacon with one and sausage crumble for the other... They were both amazing... Not sure if I did anything wrong, but the crust on the bottom was soggy... 
Oh yeah, make sure you get DEEP DISH PIE CRUST, just guessing this is probably why everyone is saying the portions can make 2 quiches with the original.

I did not like this recipe. 

I substituted cheddar for swiss, which was apparently not supposed to make a difference.  Maybe it did?

As some other reviewers said, the onions definitely could have benefited from being sauteed.  Crunchy crunchy.  Also, if I ever made this again, which I won't, I would half the onions, maybe quarter.  WAY too many.  The night I made this, we had some friends over for dinner, and they really liked it, so maybe you just have to be the type of person who eats onions like apples.

I'm a sophomore girl in highschool looking for something easy to make for lunch at school. Instead of half and half I used about 1/4 cup of cream with the remaining cup of milk. I used a cupcake pan and made a couple of individual and ready to go quiches. Delicious and super easy to make.

This recipe was super tasty, I did substitute sharp cheddar for the Swiss since my hubby isn't a big fan of Swiss. It was very flavorful and didn't require any salt or pepper. It was also super easy to prepare and make. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the cook time listed definitely wasn't enough. I cooked it for the time amounted, the cheese was browned but it was still pretty liquid. I ended up having to cover it in foil and baking it for another 20 minutes.

This was super easy and very tasty! Made this for Christmas Eve breakfast and everyone loved it, even all the picky eaters in the fam! Love how versatile it is too. Made one exactly as written and another with turkey sausage and cheddar.  Thanks for this recipe, looks like we have a new Christmas Eve breakfast tradition :-)

Tried this recipe and enjoyed the flavors.  I did use cooked bacon instead of the bacon bits.  Also added a few cherry tomatoes and a few tablespoons of yellow pepper.

I used a box pie crust- it was good but I think the frozen one called for would be better. I used real bacon and I think next time I'll use some sharp cheddar. It's a great quiche recipe

Just finished baking and eating this, it was fantastic.  I took the recommendation of adding real bacon, we used 8 slices of apple wood smoked bacon baked in the oven then cut into strips.

I love quiche, any quiche, but this one is also liked by the kid who is not crazy for broccoli quiche. I used dry minced onions(no one knows), and a lot of salt to make the bacon flavor pop. My child tried it, and said oh that's good; can I have more? Yes it is soooo good!

This quiche was amazing and so easy to make! I used turkey bacon and I cooked it before I added it. I contemplated sautéing the onions before, but decided not to and it still came out great. I will definitely be making this again soon!

I don't like bacon bits, so I used crisp half-slices of bacon, which I cook in the oven once a week to use during the week. I also gently sweated the onion in a pan so my picky eaters would not notice it. I also added a pinch of nutmeg. This recipe was so delicious and so easy. I had it ready by the time everyone else got up and I froze the couple of slices left over to use on a busy weekday morning. Thanks so much!

tried this today - never made quiche before. Used real bacon crumbled, montery jack and cheddar and a sprinkle of deli parm as that is what I had on hand. The onion was an important addition for flavour. This was good husband liked it too!

I LOVED IT.  I brought it to a party and every single person asked for the recipe.  The one thing I did do was to put the frozen crust in a deep dish pie plate before adding the ingredients because I thought it would overflow.  It didn't but it sure looked great.  Wish I had taken a picture.  Thank you for submitting this wonderful recipe.

This was a quick & easy recipe to make.  The variations are endless. I did make some changes, but only to accommodate our dietary needs.  My son works a midnight shift, so normal suppertime is breakfast for him.  He loved this quiche, and has asked for it again. Win-win for me I loved it, and so did his dad.

Just tried this tonight for dinner with a mixed green salad.  The quiche was fabulous!  I used cheddar and parm (as that is what I had on hand), added green onion to white onion, salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Definitely make this again!

I have made several times following recipe and now that son has moved on I can add other things I like. Asparagus, mushrooms, leftover chicken chopped, chopped ham leaving out bacon bits, several different cheeses. Next time will add some different veggies, cauliflower, broccoli, maybe even some Brussels sprouts. I also add minced garlic and any of the Tony Chachere's spices. Always follow to the T the first time then if something I see fit to make changes I do, but always follow exactly first for fair review. Thanks Dawnrobyn for sharing. Edit: Just made again now waiting, friends  are coming over know will become a favorite of theirs too. I make so many times a month don't even need to look at recipe anymore, thanks again for sharing.

I dont know what to say about this recipe. I guess it was okay and great as a base I suppose or maybe the texture of this type of quiche is not for us.  It was easy to make though.

I've made this quiche several times, for baby showers, as gifts, etc, and it's always received well. My only complaint is that I don't think I've ever baked it for the suggested time range, I always have to exceed or it's still runny in the middle. Not a huge inconvenience, but it means I need to watch the crust carefully to avoid burning it.

It was wonderful.  I never made, or for that matter even liked quiche before this zestful meal.  It fed 4 adults with some left over but everyone raved.  I'm going to add 1/4 cup of chopped bell pepper next time, but there really isn't too much you can do to improve upon this tasty meal.

I made this quiche - my first ever delve into the world of quiche - because I wanted to get rid of some bacon in my fridge - it was easy, delicious and I would make it again!

This was great, and easy!  I took the suggestion of another review and sauteed the onion before adding it to the mix. Kind-of a medium saute.  This really helped to sweeten up the onion and add a nice depth of flavor to the quiche.  I also added the 1/2 tsp nutmeg recommended.  I am not sure I tasted the nutmeg, but I loved the quiche, so I won't leave it out next time.  FYI, I used the Kirkland Crumbled Bacon (from Costco) and it worked great (no one could tell that I hadn't cooked it up myself).  I will definitely make this again.

made this recipe this morning. very quick. Very easy. Taste was good, but as much as I don't think this is possible, it almost seemed as though it was too much bacon & not enough egg. I even used 5 eggs instead of 4. Will definetely make this recipe again. I already have some variations in mind to try, like add mushrooms or make it a seafood quiche.

Best quiche I've ever eaten.  I used some of the suggestions in the reviews, including cooked my own bacon-6 thick slices, combination of smoked gouda and grated italian cheeses, AND I used full-fat cream instead of half-and-half.  I was going with what I had on hand, and this ROCKED!

I've never made a quiche before and this was a great starter.  Fast and easy. I used real bacon and mozz cheese; plus a little of mixed cheese that I had left over from something else.  Next time I'll reduce the onion and add more bacon.  I might try the cream cheese (light) to reduce the calories some.

This was pretty good but I wish I had sauteed the onions first. Used bacon pieces instead of bits. May or may not make again.

I made this last night. I did not have onion so I put a bit more bacon bits in it. I used the colby jack cheese since I didnt have swiss. Everything else, even the time, I did down to the letter. It was FANTASTIC!!!  I made a side of seasoned fried potatoes with it and it was an incredible dinner...the morning leftovers heated up great and  my husband is begging me to make more. Awesome recipe!

Very good!  I used ham (didn't have bacon) and a blend of cheeses (didn't have swiss)...I did use shredded parmesan instead of grated, as another reviewer suggested.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as it was.  Even my picky boys devoured this quiche!  Only thing I need to remember for next time is to make 2!

Yum! This recipe is great!! I used garlic instead of onions, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The bacon bits were so easy and adding the swiss and parmesan cheeses gives it a really unique flavor. I will definitely be making this again!

I just made this last night for my roommates and they absolutely loved it! I did make some slight changes, I put in 5 ounces of Sharp Cheddar and 3 ounces of Italian Blend, instead of the other two cheeses it called for. Also, I read the reviews before hand and decided to go the with precooked Tyson bacon and about 2 tbsp of bacon bits just to add more flavor. Came out great! Definitely making this again!

I made this for family members but a few of them don't like swiss  or parmesan cheese, so I made 2, and substituted cheddar cheese, and american cheese. 5 oz cheddar and 3 oz american cheese for one of them. Turned out great.

Fantastic!!  I needed a frozen pie shell for one pie I made for the holiday, but the store only sold shells in pairs.  I came to this site to find some recipes calling for a frozen pie shell, other than pie, and luckily found this one.   Not only could I use the leftover pie crust, but I substituted the bacon for leftover ham.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe after the holidays when I'm up to my ears in leftovers.  I also added spinach and used cheddar instead.  I feel like it was missing something, so will add some chilis or peppers to it next time since it was absolutely delicious when I covered a slice in salsa verde. Thanks for the recipe!  I'm so happy I found it.

I just fixed this recipe for a day after Thanksgiving brunch.  I LOVED it!!  The only thing I changed was 2% milk instead of half and half.  And I used Italian shredded cheese mix.  It was delicous.  And my husband really like it too.

I must say I had my doubts when I decided to change a few things, but this turned out absolutely scrumptious!! I used a Pillsbury pie crust that I placed in a pie plate and froze the night prior. I cooked my own bacon...6 strips...crisp. Sauteed the onions in a little bit of the bacon grease. Changed the cheese to about 4 oz of velveeta and 4 oz of pepper jack. Added a dash of pepper to the mixture. Used about 1/3 C of heavy cream and 2/3 C half and half and the 4 medium eggs. Ingredients filled the pie plate just about half way. Perhaps just a little bit extra of everything to fill the shell more. Super Yummy!! Definitely a keeper!

Since I left the grocery list at home and had to guess at the ingredients, I used Cheddar Cheese and 2 Tablespoons of Minced Onion. The best part of all was this took me 5 minutes to prep and get into the oven!!!! I would definitely make it again!!

Great recipe! This was my first quiche and it turned out wonderful.  My kids loved it.  I used colby  and  shredded parmesan and added garlic, pepper and paprika and and cooked my own bacon.  It was good.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.  :)

This was delicious.  I used real bacon and sauteed the onion in bacon grease before adding it to the pan.  We're a low-carb household so I didn't use the crust. I took it out of the oven about 5 minutes early. It browned up nicely. Thank you for the easy recipe!

This is a great quiche!! I especially like the lower fat content. I make it with a homemade pre-baked crust and crumbled bacon, rather than baconbits, and it always gets rave reviews.

This was a huge hit. I'm not much of a cook but I've been trying to improve my skills.  I wanted to try something easy but that would make my husband happy on a lazy Sunday morning. He LOVED this. I took the other reviewers advice and used shredded mixed parm cheese for the creaminess. I also used bacon pieces but won't do that again. It was a little fatty/ chewy and I think the bacon bits would do the trick for our tastes. I will make this again! Super easy and delicious!

Really good!  I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to add a little more flavor.  I also used just cheddar cheese and real bacon and cut it up in small pieces before I cooked it.  Very good recipe that can be modified to your taste buds!  Thanks!

This is unbelievable! This was a first time at Quiche... I substituted and realized I messed up on exact amounts but it still came out great!  I guess with good instructions you can't go wrong even with "newbies" out there!

This is the best quiche recipe I have tried. I used both Swiss cheese and the Sargento Italian mix. As others suggested, I chopped up some onion and used some cube ham as well.It's an excellent base recipe to alter to your family's taste. Thank you!

Although I never got to taste a bite (it went too fast) I heard it was fabulous!  I cut up some precooked bacon and used mont. jack and cheddar blend along with vidalia onion. I added a little more cheese than the recipe called for.  It sure did smell good when it was cooking.  I will make it again!

This was SO good.  A big Hit with my family and friends.  I used ham instead of bacon and added garlic and an onion soup mix for more flavor.  Will do this again soon!

Either there was too much onion or my onion was too strong. But still a great recipe. I will use this again!

This is a great quiche. I sauteed the onion in a little butter, and used milk instead of half and half. I also just microwaved some bacon. It was excellent and had a great texture. I liked the combo. of cheeses. I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This was soooo easy and tasty!  Instead of bacon and cheddar, I used ham and swiss cheese.  It was incredible.  I had never made quiche, but now I will make it much more often.

I make quiches all the time but I looked up a bacon one just to see. I grated the onion and I used American cheese instead. Also I added tomato. And I used 5 eggs. I never made it with half and half. Came out excellent!!
