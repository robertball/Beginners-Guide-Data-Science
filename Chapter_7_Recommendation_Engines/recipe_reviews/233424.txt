Family really liked this dish, although I did sub green & red peppers for the mushrooms as we are not mushroom eaters.  I had chicken in the freezer that I had diced and cooked.  That worked great and helped me get the meal on the table, quickly.  A nice use for tortellini.  Thanks Lisa, for sharing your recipe.

Very easy recipe. I baked the chicken, and shredded it rather than pan cook. Much more tender chicken. I substituted Shiitake mushrooms as well. Even my children liked it!

Couldn't believe I could make something this good, so simply. My husband "our cook" was impressed. I used coconut oil as my vegetable oil, added bell peppers and used some minced jar garlic when cooking the vegetables. Seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and seasoned salt when cooking. Otherwise used this wonderful recipe as stated. We aren't on the "cream" will kill you bandwagon, but cheap vegetable oils might :) Such a versatile recipe, you could choose your meat, veggie or pasta into many variations, change up some herbs. If I could give it a 10 I would. Of course cream tastes good on a bumper. Thank You!

I know, do not make changes. But, I used rotisserie chicken that I had and subbed in skim milk thickened with flour to reduce the calories. Also used minced garlic when sautéing the mushrooms. This was great. Will make this again. Good for lunch the next day. Yum.

Came out great, I added some fresh spinach to the mushrooms and some Pecorino Romano to give the sauce a little something extra and oh man! the wife and kids loved it.  Only suggestion I might make for next time is to instead of chicken, use bacon or prosciutto.

I tried this awhile ago since I had all the ingredients needed. I just added onion and garlic powder and some salt on the chicken so that it won't be blant since we're dealing with chicken breast. I also made the sauce a bit salter than the normal taste because the pasta doesn't have that much taste. It was sooo gooddddd!

This was very good but I wish I'd have added some shallots and minced garlic to it.  I did add some spinach, a 10 oz bag which I wilted with the mushrooms.  Good idea, Cochina. Thanks

It was great. Put my own spin on it. I  added green peppers and spinach along with the mushrooms.

This turned out great and it was very easy to make. I just used regular fettuccine pasta instead of the cheese tortellini and I also used dried parsley flakes instead of fresh.

Excellent recipe! It’s becoming a family favorite! I’ve started letting the sauce simmer more so it thickens up a lot. Sometimes I add corn starch too. I also prefer to use fresh garlic instead of powder.

This was one of the best dishes I've made off of here so far.I made a few changes; portabella mushrooms instead, minced garlic, diced red pepper added nice sweet flavor. I also supplemented the vegetable oil with olive oil.

Delicious! Followed recipe and someone else's idea of adding fresh spinach. Serve with a loaf of Italian bread and you have dinner!

So yummy! I used gluten free penne pasta instead of tortellini, and cooked the chicken with 2 TBS minced garlic and 2tsp salt. Perfect!

We loved this dish!  My husband who does not love tortellini said this is a keeper and went back for seconds.  It has everyday items that are in my kitchen so there was no extra purchases goes into rotation with 2 thumbs up.   Thank you so much for a simple delicious meal.

I will make this again and again!  Very good.  I instead used a 16oz bag of penne pasta and broccoli.  I added garlic to the sauce, and I doubled the sauce.  My family loves it.

This recipe turned out pretty good and had family talking about it even after the meal. Although the only thing I had a hard time with was getting the mushroom and cream sauce to thicken. I also suggest using either more of the tortellini or less chicken with more parsley than the recipe calls for Ro add more flavor. All in all though, I will definitely be making this again.
