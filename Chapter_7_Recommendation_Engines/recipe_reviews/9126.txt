Just had to try this recipe as I have an aunt who does not care for extremely moist stuffing.  These were great!  Had a nice crispy exterior and moist interior.  Best of both worlds for those people who really like the top of the stuffing (with the crust) but not the bottom (with the mush).  People really seemed to enjoy them, even the teenagers.  I made my biscuits and corn bread the night before, let them cool and crumbled them into a large bowl.  Covered loosely with a tea towel and set on the counter to dry overnight.  Then mixed everything up in the morning.  This was a really easy recipe.  I did increase the seasonings a bit as we like food with a little more flavor in our family.  I would recommend this to anyone.

I made this for my husband for his office's Thanksgiving pot luck.  It went over quite well, and it was very easy to make.

The only thing I didn't like about the patties was that there were large chunks of biscuit in them that disrupted the "dressing" flavor.  The cornbread crumbles nicely, but biscuits are much denser, and they might benefit from a quick run through the food processor before being mixed in next time.

Amazing! I decided to try this recipe because I had a pan of cornbread and several biscuits left over from previous dinners. It was like Thanksgiving dinner all wrapped up into one neat little package. Huge hit with my kids. I already had biscuits made from "heart healthy" Bisquick, so I used those, and  I used "No Chicken Chicken Broth" and Earth Balance spread in place of the turkey stock and butter and omitted the mushrooms (kids) and they were amazing. I also upped the spices just because we like a lot of flavor. I'll be making cornbread and biscuits just to make these!

This was a great recipe. Ihad to add lots more poultry seasoning for my taste but to each his own.. I was short on time and was serving this recipe for my husband squadron dinner so I put all the stuffing into a pan and baked it.  There was not one ounce left in the pan and my husband asked me to make more for our Thanksgiving dinner.  Needless to say.. no more stove top here!! Thanks for a great recipe

I made these the night before since I already had some turkey broth from a previously made crockpot turkey breast to be served with my T-Day turkey. I added a little more seasoning than suggested. The biscuit & cornbread combo is exactly what's needed for good textured cornbread dressing. I warmed them for our dinner with the rolls. Will definately make again. Scored points with in-laws!

I loved this!  I don't eat meat, so I didn't add the poultry seasoning, and I used veg broth instead of turkey, but it was great!  I liked that each bite had a bit of "crust" to it - so everyone, not just the first people to serve themselves, had that great "top layer" taste.

My Grandmother used to make dressing balls every year for Thanksgiving & Christmas. Unfortunately, I never got the recipe. These patties are pretty close to hers. They are simple to make and DELICIOUS!! A definite addition to my Thanksgiving and Christmas cooking list.

My husband's grandmother has been making this recipe as long as he can remember!  (40 years)  Wonder who originated it?  I'm glad to have it in print, because Mimi never wrote anything down!  Even with the recipe, it's hard to make it taste "just like Mimi's"!

I really liked the idea of dressing patties, but, this didn't work out for me.   I halved the recipe, but, other than that prepared exactly as the recipe stated.   I wasn't sure how long they needed to bake since it wasn't stated in the recipe, but, after about 35 minutes they patties still weren't brown.  I turned the oven on broil for a few minutes just to get slightly brown and have a little crunch on the top.   The patties did not stay together well after they were cooked either.  I had to be very careful when moving them to the platter just to keep them together.   The flavor was ok, but, I think they would have benefited from some fresh sage.  Just my family's personal preference, but, this was not a hit with us.

We didn't just love this and I'm a huge dressing fan.  I didn't use biscuits because I didn't have any, but I don't think that would have made any difference.   I added some more seasonings because it was kind of plain to us.  They did hold their shape, which surprised me as I figured they would of fallen apart.  I like my dressing moist and fluffy and these were pretty dense.  They were something fun and new to try, but I wouldn't make them again.
