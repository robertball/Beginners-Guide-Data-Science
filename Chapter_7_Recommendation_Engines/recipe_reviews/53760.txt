An excellent dessert - well received by all who tried it. I followed the suggestion to use additional raspberries, combining a package of unsweetened berries with one in a light syrup, an d then eliminated the 6 T sugar.  In the future, I would also try the suggestion from another tiramisu recipe to substitute mascarpone for 2pkgs cream cheese blended with 1/2 c heavy cream and 5 T sour cream, as the mascarpone is quite expensive for the minimal flavour it imparts.  As I was not cooking at home, I had no pastry brush available and simply dipped the coookies in the Grand Marnier syrup which seemed to work quite well. I also used fresh raspberry as a garnish and additional chocolate curls. Yummy!

Awesome...or as my little girl says "It's like heaven in my mouth!" Following other tips, I did reduce amount of sugar in berries, plus doubled the amount (works best with fresh berries). I too increased the chocolate curls as I didn't really taste the chocolate the first time I made this. Substituted Blackberry Brandy I had in house for the Grand Marnier I didn't have handy. Worked fine. The marscapone substitute another reader suggested was outrageous, even better than true marscapone! This recipe is easy and delicious! Thanks Den!!

I liked the idea of the flavors in this tiramisu, but it was way too soggy for me. I used thawed frozen raspberries, so I might not have drained them enough... so if you use frozen, make sure not to use the juice!

This twist on a classic is a very delicate dessert. I changed it a very little bit, by layering 1 layer of ladyfingers soaked in the syrup, 1 layer of the mascarpone mixture, 1/2 of the fruit (I used thawed frozen mixed berries), 1 more layer of soaked ladyfingers, remaining berries and remaining mascarpone mixture. I dusted this all with cocoa powder and sprinkled a little chopped caramelized peanuts. Delicious, but I'll give a try to the recipe as described in the recipe. From coming back from shopping to cleaning dishes, it only took 20 minutes! Oh, and, yes, it yields more than 6 servings (I'd say 8-10).

An absolutely delicious spin on traditional tiramisú, ideal for summer;  I made 1 1/2 times the amount for a party, and it disappeared.  I used the best raspberries I could lay my hands on, and they lifted the dessert into another realm altogether.  One hint though?  As much as I love chocolate, in my opinion, this doesn't need it.  And it was nothing to do with the quality of the chocolate I used - I just think it adds nothing to it, and the next times I make it will be without it.  JSPAHN, maybe you haven't had tiramisú before, because it's quite clearly not baked;  the way I see it, you're going to die anyway from all that creamy richness so you might as well not worry, but if the thought of uncooked eggs makes you nervous, there are plenty of recipes out there for tiramisú featuring a cooked sabayon (egg yolk mixture) and Italian or Swiss (ie. cooked) meringue.  Just be forewarned that you will be sacrificing some creaminess.

This was very tasty indeed. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because instead of using all those eggs I will use whipping cream added to the cheese. I also used coffee liqour because that is what I had & I didn't add water and sugar to it. I also used fresh berries and 'less' sugar raspberry jam mashed up. I also grated a little chocolate on top, which it really didn't need and added no nuts.
 Will be making this again!

Superb! Absolutely delicious!  I made 1.5 times the recipe for a dinner party but found the Grand Marnier syrup did not need to be increased.  Still had plenty for the increased number of Ladyfingers. Got rave reviews - Thanks Den!

Really easy, really yummy.  I did temper the egg yolks before beating, but otherwise follwed the recipe to the letter.

This recipe was very good and I made it for a large group so doubled it.  However it was a lot of work to do with a whole dinner party so I probably won't make again unless on a very special occasion.  I used frozen mixed berries and it was even better than just raspberries alone.  Vanilla was called for in the recipe but never saw where to add it and I couldn't figure out what the crushed berries at the beginning were for - just FYI.

I gave this 4 stars only because i didn't follow the recipe exactly. However, with the changes i made i would give it 5 stars! I could not, in good conscience, serve raw eggs so i substituted 1sm. box instant french vanilla pudding (following package directions) for the egg yolks. I whipped 2 cups whipping cream and use that in place for the egg whites. I used white chocolate on top only and didn't use the almonds at all. i also followed other reviewers and doubled the raspberries. I would also agree with previous review that this serves more than 6. I would say more like 12-16. Anyway, this was beautiful ( served it in a trifle bowl so you could see all the layers), delicious and easy to make. I would totally recommend this recipe!

I made this for a special Valntine's Day Italian meal I prepared for my girlfriend. It was a big hit. I used white choclate instead and did not include the almonds. I also put extra raspberries scattered across the top. They reminded us of little hearts. This dessert is a force to be reckoned with.

We served this after an italian lasagna dinner and 5 people asked for the recipe.  It was a big hit!  I used frozen raspberries and drained off the extra liquid from the thawing process.

This was s good.   I used frozen berries, because that s what I could get. I ran them through a sieve to take out the majority of te seeds.  The cheese mixture is easy and so tasty .  
   I put it in a clear trifle bowl and it was stunning to serve.

 I bought 3 pkgs of lady figures .

Mmm! this was good! I halved the recipe and it was still plenty for 6 people (after a big dinner!) I dusted dutch cocoa over the top instead of the almonds and grated chocolate which looks and tastes better (I think!) Will make again...

This is a very good recipe.  I have successfully made it twice and both times people loved it.  I wasn't able fluff the egg whites so I substituted the cool whip for the egg whites and sugar--it seemed to work great.  Happy cooking!

I had a couple of bags of frozen raspberries to use so I thought I'd give this a try. I am guilty of tweaking it a bit. I used Truvia instead of sugar which worked out great. I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used lite cool whip (6 oz) to mix with the mascarpone cheese(this little adjustment save me all kinds of work thank you very much)plus I added a tsp of Truvia to this mixture as well for a bit of additional sweetness.

I used two 8x8 pans and only put one layer of ladyfingers on the bottom. Then I layered the raspberry mixture, followed by the mascarpone mixture and I topped it with additional cool whip and shaved chocolate.

It tasted amazing. Not too sweet at all which everyone really liked. I also added more Grand Marnier - glad I did :-).

Really good!  I changed a little, used some Chambord liquer in the raspberry sauce.  I liked it a lot, but my husband didn't like the texture, just not his thing I suppose.

I  made this in individual ramekins using the lady fingers on sides only and filling the center with raspberry moscarpone mixture. I used the Grand Manier undiluted and even so  you could barely detect it.  My guests were very impressed with the appearance and taste. Of course they  did not know that there should have been a Grand Manier flavor!

This was very good! I was unsure at first but the next day all those flavors definitely came out.  I did cut the recipe in half and used less raspberries only because I dont like them much.  Even still this was light, refreshing, and just plain delicious.  I used every ingredient and couldnt have imagined a substitute such as cream cheese or sour cream.  I really enjoyed an alternative to the richer recipes that use espresso and such.

Very good! This is rich, so you can get a lot more than 6 servings from the 9x13 pan. I made it for a family gathering and I'd say we got about 16 servings out of it. Thanks for sharing!

This is worthy of a lot more than 5 stars!  It is delicious, just as it stands.  Living in Mexico, the raspberries are HUGE and very sweet, so the next time (very soon) I will decrease the sugar on the berries a bit.  I DID use 2 pounds of berries, as was suggested by another reviewer.  Thanks, so much, for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This recipe was AWESOME!! It didn't take too long to make and was pretty simple. I liked the no baking part as well. I made the recipe for my family and they all gobbled it down faster than I was able to serve it!! I added a side of ice cream with it and it made the whole experience perfect. Thank you so much for sharing that recipe!!

This dessert is amazing! But I will be hesitant to make it again since it has raw eggs

This was fantastic!!! We were really impressive with this tiramisu (and I don't normally like tiramisu either). We followed the recipe almost exactly, but soaked the ladyfingers in the alcohol mixture rather than brushing them. Next time, I will not only soak them, but I will also add a generous helping of the Grand Marnier mixture into the dish to give it more flavor. I would also recommend using just slightly less of the cream.

I made this for a dinner party. It went very well after an Italian dinner. Light and refreshing. Guests loved it.

Wonderful recipe!  I made this for a work luncheon and it went over great.  I love that it doesn't have a coffee flavor to it.
VERY GOOD!

I made this for a birthday. The only thing I did differently was using white chocolate rather than semi sweet. My sugar for the syrup wouldn’t dissolve so I heated it in the microwave 30 seconds at a time and stirred until it finally dissolved. This is one of the best desserts I’ve ever made the first try.

Loved this recipe! Also, an alternate for using orange juice liquor, just use regular orange juice and it's amazing! I also used strawberries in the recipe and topped it with chocolate chips, yum!

I liked making this, I substituted the mascapone cheese with 16 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 c. of heavy cream, ad 4 tbs of butter.  I found the substitution here on allrecipies. Next time, I would put a small layer o the mascapone cheese before the lady fingers, double the raspberries and also make two layers instead of the one. Over all, it was pretty good. I think I will probably make this again sometime when I have a special event

I was not too thrilled with this recipe. It was too tangy and just not what I was looking for.  If you want something with raspberries, I would try another recipe.
