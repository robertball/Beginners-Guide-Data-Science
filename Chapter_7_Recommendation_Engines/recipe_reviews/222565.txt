This recipe was excellent.  I changed a few things.  I also added some breadcrumbs and used cream of mushroom soup. I topped it with a small amount of shredded Swiss cheese and some crumpled chips

I like the concept of this recipe, but it didn't turn out for me.  Too much liquid, and it needs twice as long in the oven (or longer) than the recipe states (25 mins).  I will definitely try this again, just tweak it a bit.  Thanks for the new idea!

Simple meal and very good.  i didn't bother with the gravy but we put tartar and cocktail sauce on the table, everyone still liked it.  i made changes to the side dishes with potato salad and coleslaw which went nicely with this easy meal...ty

Taste is great! Easy to make. We love it. Cook it at least once a month.
