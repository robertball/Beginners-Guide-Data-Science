I spent a Friday night with this recipe and 3 kids and it was hit all around.  We took pictures at each stage including spoon licking for a future scrapbook page.  The kids had a blast making these and really enjoyed them the next evening after dinner on the porch - we let them freeze overnight which seemed to work very well.  We used devil's food cake mix and neopolitian ice cream - they were a little messy but they were yummy !

these were a fun treat to make and eat.  I liked that the cookie part was soft (even when frozen) so that the icecream didn't squish out.  I copied Trisha's picture and rolled the edges in sprinkles....very cute!  A tip that made the cookies more uniform and not too thick......I spooned out the batter onto the cookie sheet and flattened with the back of the spoon into a circle.  Then with fingers dampened with water, I was able to smooth out the surface of the cookies (the dough is very sticky, thus the damp fingers!).  Without this bit of smoothing out, the cookies were kind of lumpy and bumpy. I will make these again, the kids and grownups both enjoyed them.

These are perfect. I wanted something easy, and I found it. I also wanted a soft shell, so when you bit it, it wouldn't squish out so much. I just used vanilla ice cream, some with mini M&M's, mini chocolate cips, and some with sprinkles. Thanks so much, for a fun snack.

I followed the recipe exactly & they came out totally flat...they were like little flat cakes, there is no possible way I could put ice cream on them...not sure what the problem was.

I didn't think this was anything special and would not make again.  Fortunately, I cut the water by 1/2 cup or I would have had one huge cookie on the pan because they would have spread too much.  I didn't care for the artificial cake mix taste either though I used DH.  Very mushy after being in the freezer.

Refreshing and so easy to make!  Teens and adults loved them.  You can make them all different sizes too which is nice for little hands or the great big ones!

I have to rate this low because the cookies were unusable.  This recipe might benefit from specifying the exact brand and type of cake mix the author used.  My cookies were too thin to hold ice cream and they stuck to the cookie sheet, so I couldn't get them off even if they were thick enough.  I'd like to try it again if anyone has a tested brand of cake mix to use.  Unlike one of the reviewers, my batter was very thick, but just didn't turn out once baked.
