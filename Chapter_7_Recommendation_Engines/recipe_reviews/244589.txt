This was good. I have never made any mole sauce before, and I enjoyed it.  Just for clarification, the recipe calls for 2 canned chipotle peppers, not 2 cans of chipotle peppers. That means you take two of the peppers out of the one can (this of course can be adjusted to taste.)  I think I will make extra of the sauce and put it in the freezer to use up the rest of the can of chipotle peppers. I much prefer making my own sauce than buying a can of already-made enchilada sauce. Tasty!

Although the ingredient list sounded rather strange to me, these were actually really good. I can't imagine using 2 cans of chipotle peppers, though.  I used half of a can and the amount of kick was just right. I didn't have the flavored chicken broth. Instead I used the broth from cooking the chicken in the slow cooker with salsa.

I only added ONE can chipotle peppers in adobo and IT WAS GREAT!  I really like spicy and this was spicy enough for me!

Made it as directed but I used only 1 can of the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and it was FLAMING HOT!  I would make it again using a lot less chipotle peppers. I used regular chicken broth

Made it exactly as stated except for the chicken broth. Used regular chicken broth as the tortilla kind was not available. Amazing! Absolutely stellar, super flavorful without the spice occluding the flavor.  We will make it again, but this is a weekend or special occasion meal for us as it is time consuming to prepare.

Mouthwatering flavor & easy to make! I used flour tortillas, but everything else was exact. This one is definitely a keeper!
