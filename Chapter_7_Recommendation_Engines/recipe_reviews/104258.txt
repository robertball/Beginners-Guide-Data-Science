I was looking for a terrific dressing for another salad that I was making, so this review is only for the dressing.  It was fantastic and I didn't change a thing!

Love this recipe!  I sometimes add leftover grilled, sliced chicken breast to make a light meal.  I add dijon mustard and "Herbes de Provence" to my balsamic vinaigrette. Also, the apples will not turn brown if you slice them into an ice water bath with fresh lemon juice added.  Pat dry in paper towels before adding them to salad.

Great salad.  The only thing I did differently is that I didn't put any of the cheese into the dressing, because I knew I would have leftover dressing and wanted to be able to use it on other salads.  This dressing is so good and simple it is now a staple in my house for lots of quick salads in the evening!  Perfect proportions of ingredients...

I only had fuji apples on hand and I was out of garlic, so I substituted McCormick garlic pepper blend seasoning (included garlic, black pepper, green & red peppers, onion & brown sugar) for garlic and pepper in recipe.  Still turned out delicious!
