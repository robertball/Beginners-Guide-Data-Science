I cut the amount of processed cheese back by half and added in four ounces (give or take) of Helluva Good sharp cheddar. I threw in one package chopped green onions, a little hot sauce and a few spices (onion powder, garlic powder, squirt dijon mustard, fresh ground pepper). NO leftovers. This is an excellent quick pantry side--goes well with meat loaf.

I love this recipe, but I use evaporated milk instead of the soup and I add green onion. This is my favorite holiday side!
