This recipe was absolutely delicious.  To make a little less fattening, I used 1/2 cup of Hellman's Light mayo and 1/4 cup of no fat plain yogurt.  I think I will go 50/50 on that combo next time to make even lighter.  I mixed half cauliflower, half broccoli.  Used regular saltine crackers for toping.  Can't wait to pass this recipe on to friends and family.  Thanks!

I just made this for dinner for my husband and me.  Since you said it made a lot of sauce, I poured part of the sauce over part of a huge head of cauliflower(pre-cooked as directed) and the rest over some sliced,  previously baked chicken.  I put chicken on one end of the casserole and cauliflower on the other and had a delicious one-dish meal.  My husband claims not to like curry, but he told me twice how much he liked it.

This was very tasty.  I had nothing but this for dinner.  I did use less mayo/soup mixture than called for.  Also, to make it healthier, I used Trader Joe's (no affiliation) reduced fat mayo--it's eggless, cholestrol free, 70% less fat than regular, and 35 calories per tsbp.  It doesn't taste quite like regular (it's a bit more tart), but you can't really taste the difference when you mix in other flavors in it.

Didn't have everything on hand, so I tweaked this a little. I used cream of mushroom soup and low fat mayo, hot curry powder, a little cayenne because i like things spicy, half a packet of splenda to bring out the sweetness of the cauliflower, and a can of peas. The only cauliflower i had was frozen and a little freezer-burned, so i wanted something strong flavored to make it palatable. THIS WAS IT! It was as good as my favorite Indian restaurant. Will definitely make again for myself, probably won't try it with the kids until they get older. :)

I was surprised how good this was. I added significantly more curry though, and left out the wheat cracker/butter business.

Yummy - after first bite, I thought "OK", but after a couple bites it is addicting! Made as stated, but added some cooked chicken I had to use up. Also used cornflake crumbs and no butter on top.

Don't be afraid of the mayo!  It somehow blends in and disappears.  I used reduced-fat mayo and "Healthy Request" soup.  Buttered breadcrumbs instead of crackers.  My head of cauliflower was a bit small, so I added carrots, which worked really well.  I also added a can of chunk chicken.  It's not life-changing, but it's a simple and satisfying way to have a "mostly vegetables" meal.

This recipe is quite tasty and really simple to make.  I used part cauliflower and part broccoli and it turned out great.  I think I'll add a little cayenne pepper next time to give it a bit more zip.

I made this recipe exactly as written, but used saltine cracker crumbs for the topping.  It was delicious.  This recipe is a keeper!

Great as is, and sauce lends itself easily to variations. Suitable for company or a pot luck; a keeper with a good, balanced flavor. In the future, for color, I'll try adding some frozen petite peas to the sauce; maybe some julienne cut carrots.  The sauce quantity is perfect, covering all florets filling a shallow 8" x 10" baking dish. I used enough buttered crackers/crumb mix to cover the dish thoroughly.  

I'd characterize the curry taste as "mild" or "a gentle hint of curry."  Though I used "98% fat free" chicken soup, I used regular rather than light mayo and a quarter cup of butter for the bread crumbs.  The result is a slight rich character to the sauce, but I LOVED the dish and treated it as a main course.  Who'd have thought I'd fill myself with cauliflower!

I used up what we had of Triskets crackers and supplemented with plain bread crumbs.  Use crackers; they add a crunch, even when crushed, that you don't get from just the bread crumbs.  Would I use light mayo in the future?  Maybe not.  Part of the charm of this recipe (and drawback for some) is the rich character of the final product.  Once I cut the amount of butter and had difficulty getting the top to brown; stick with recipe as it is.   Do NOT add salt; there's plenty from the soup and butter.  More curry?  Depends on your preference for the spice. Pepper?  Maybe 1/8 tsp but more would change the flavor balance I think.

I really enjoyed this. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was so good. The second time I made it I tried to modify the recipe so there would be fewer calories and fat. I cut back on the mayonaise and omitted the butter and crackers. It just wasn't the same. I recommend following the recipe as is.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I slightly altered it by using 'half fat' cream of chicken soup and lower fat mayo, and it still tasted great.

I was happy that this recipe was posted because I lost my recipe for this dish.  Like others who enjoy curry flavor, I add a little more curry.  If you are curry beginner, keep it as listed.  I put the cauliflower in the microwave for two minutes in a zip lock bag or place it in raw.  I like cauliflower firm and it can get too soft in the baking process.  This great with chicken and rice!  Again, thanks for posting the recipe.

Made this the other night and it was delicious. Next time I will cut down on the mayo. I topped it with panko bread crumbs and cut out the butter entirely.

Love this recipe!  It is almost identical to my mother's except she adds shredded cheddar to the recipe (which I did) and it was fantastic!  Also, I love curry, so I added a little bit more than called for.  I skipped the butter and crackers, but I think the cheddar made up for lack of butter :-)

I have been making a similar recipe for many years but based on some reviews here, I made a few changes. I added 2 sauteed diced onions,   added  1 1/2 cups of frozen peas and reduced the mayo to a bit over 1/3 cup.  I forgot to add the milk but will try that next time.  The additions really took this recipe to the next level and everyone loved the end result.  For the topping I melted butter and added bread crumbs.

I had very low expectations for this, but it is awesome! It's not "real" Indian food any more than Panda Garden is Chinese food or Kraft is Mac & cheese. Yet, sometimes I get a craving for the cheap knock offs. This is so easy and total comfort food. I suggest upping the curry powder, adding some red pepper, and tossing in a can of drained and rinsed chickpeas. It can also be made without the topping & simmered on the stove.

I was writing down the ingredients on my shopping list when i realized i could try this recipe with what i had on hand. I'm so glad i did. It came out yummy! I had broccoli but no cauliflower so i used that. I also did not have cream of chicken..i only had cream of mushroom and celery so i went with the celery. Everything else was as stated although i did notice someone had mentioned cumin and i thought that would be good...i love indian spices so i used curry and added a couple dashes of cumin. No crackers so i used breadcrumbs and some sprinkle cheese. It was so good. I will make this again with cauliflower and cream of chicken!!!

Great blend of flavors, so easy to make!!  I added extra curry and cut mayo down to 1/2 cup.  Makes a ton of sauce... Great over chicken breasts for a quick, tasty meal.  Next time I might add some peas and carrots to the cauliflower for more color.

I just made this. It is very good! I used the 'Roasted Garlic Cauliflower' recipe on this site to roast the veg first. I only roasted for 15 minutes, then I added the sauce and baked for 30 minutes. I also added a bit extra curry. Thank you for the recipe.

Blah, I didn't like this at all. The cream of chicken and mayo made it all taste like very artificial indian food, not to mention i'm sure it's not good for you at all.

This was fabulous!  I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup lowfat buttermilk.  I cut the butter back to 2 tbls because it was way to much.  I also had some frozen broccoli that I needed to use so I cooked that with the cauliflower.  Delicious!

Very easy and tasty side dish. My four-year old loved it and asked me to make it again soon. I followed the recipe except for cutting the mayonaise in half with light sour cream and using cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken. Endless variations for this one. I'd give it four and a half, but not quite a five. Great dish, all the same. Thanks for sharing.

VERY good! First time, followed the recipe exactly, second time I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken; it tasted a bit too chicken-y for me. Also, I used Wheatables because that was all I had and it turned out great!

I have made a similar version of this for years but, no longer, this has replaced my old recipe.  Very quick and easy.  I didn't have any crackers so I substituted fine bread crumbs and used low fat soup, it was delicious.

I have made this recipe over a dozen times, and have simplified it into a one-pot recipe. I create the sauce (skip the mayo entirely) by using a can of soup and a can of milk. Add the curry powder and stir until blended. While the sauce is getting hot, I chop the cauliflower and then cook it right in the sauce. Use good quality soup and spices, or you will lose flavor! Some additions I have made for variety: diced sweet red peppers, frozen green peas (thawed under hot water, toss in at end of cooking to retain color), cubed sweet potato or butternut squash (add at beginning, cook with cauliflower). We almost always eat the whole pot, but the leftovers are incredible for lunch. I sent to work with my husband. Serve with Basmati Rice. It's the best! For a spicier sauce, add crushed red chili pepper seeds and about 2 teaspoons of sugar. Yum yum! We have this almost every week. It is that good!

Extremely yummy and a firm new entry into our list of "comfort foods".  The entire family, from A to Z, polished their plates.  This is a first for cauliflower in our home.  Thank you!!!

I was looking for something a little different for cauliflower.  WOW what a surprise.  I made it just like the recipe and wouldn't change a thing next time.  So simple and tasted great.  Made dinner for several friends and what a hit.  Filled the house with aroma and filled the plates with flavor!  Couldn't ask for more!

Really, really yummy! I actually added cooked diced chicken breast and served it as the main course. Very easy to make.

Very good. I doubled the curry powder and added canned chickpeas. I also used cream of mushroom soup because I'm a vegetarian, and skipped the butter/cracker top to reduce calories. Will make again (with my changes).

This was ok. It was definitely different than anything we'd made before.  I did make a few changes based on suggestions and what I had on hand.  First I only used 1/2 cup mayo, added a tsp. of curry powder and a dash of cayenne pepper.  Had to use cream of celery because that's all I had on hand.  I also didn't have any crackers so I used seasoned bread crumbs instead.  I will make this again as but will definitely try the cream of chicken and maybe add some other spices as it seemed to be lacking something.

What a delightful dish!  This is a great alternative to using butter to bring out the flavor of the cauliflower and the sweet tangyness of curry.

OMG!!! This is out of this world!!!! The only changes I made were: added another teaspoon of curry and used panko instead of crackers. Stuck it under the broiler for a minute or two. Couldn't stop eating it! Can't wait to make again!!!!

This was good. I used non-fat greek yogurt in place of the mayo, and added extra curry powder. There was a lot of extra "sauce," maybe my cauliflower was not as large as it should have been.

Loved it. Do not be put off by the mayo...it is actually very good.  I added more curry (per our taste) and have made it both with crackers and with Italian-style breadcrumbs.  Great either way.

After craving this ALL day at work, I went home and made it right away. I thought the base was OK; it needed a ton more spices to give it a distinct flavor. I tripled the amount of curry, added cumin, turmeric, and a touch of garlic. Finally I was satisfied and put it in the oven. In the end it tasted great, but I definitely think it needs more flavor when working with the original recipe.

This is very similar to a dish that a friend of mine makes. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken (because it's what I had on hand) and I added about a 1/2 cup of mozzarella (I think cheddar would be good too). I used one package of frozen cauliflower and just doubled the cooking time (because I didn't bother to thaw it first). My husband is addicted!

This turned out much better than I thought it would. Husband gobbled it down, which really surprised me. The only change I made was to add a small splash of heavy cream to the milk/mayo/soup. My only complaint with this recipe is that it calls for generic 'curry powder' which I'm not terribly keen on. Back in Britain, the average supermarket will stock many different types of curry powders, all with very different flavors/levels of heat/etc, eg Bhuna, Rogan Jhosh, Balti, Madras etc. Even out local Indian grocers stocks only two -'curry powder' and 'Garam Masala,' neither of which are great. Anyway, this is a good recipe that I would certainly make again. Thanks, Helen!

Really good.  I used  3/4 can cream  chicken and about  half the mayo. Sprinkled with cayenne pepper and  topped with Panko crumbs mixed with Creole seasoning (Tony's).  Will definitely make again, maybe with cubed chicken.

A little different take on cauliflower. I've made it as is (minus the cracker topping) but prefer it when I only use 1/2 cup of mayo, no milk, and add 1/2 an onion and 8oz mushrooms (sauteed first). I also add 1/2 tsp ginger and maybe 1/8 tsp garlic powder. Everyone enjoys it, and even the hubby (who proclaims to hate curry) says, if it had chicken it would be REALLY good. I plan to make it with chicken sometime soon. :) And then I'd use the crackers on top...but Ritz or breadcrumbs, not wheat crackers.

Great starter recipe. I browned some chicken thighs and then added the cauliflower and sauce to the pan. I added an additional tsp of curry powder, 1tsp minced garlic, onion, 1/2tsp cayenne, and 1/2tsp cinnamon. I substituted 1/2c lite mayo and 1/4c lite sour cream for the mayo, and ~3/4c water instead of the milk. Simmered on the stove top for about 25 minutes. It was delicious!

I had a head of cauliflower and wanted something different than the usual cheese sauce.  This was really good.  I'd give it 5 stars but I save those for spectacular recipes. 

I did make some small changes - I don't like mayonnaise or the taste that it gives to some dishes so I substituted about 1/4 C. Greek Yogurt and 1/2 C. sour cream and used about 1 T. Curry Powder because I like curry.  Hubby said it was a keeper!  I used Triscuit because that's the only wheat cracker I had and it was great - nice and crunchy!  I always liked the dishes at the Indian Restaurant that have cauliflower and they use a lot of yogurt in their cooking so the yogurt substitution stayed in character with the Indian theme.  Try it!

Several changes. This was a fantastic base sauce, and so easy! 
I made the sauce in the pan, can of soup, 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup miracle whip light (didn't have mayo), 1 cup water. 
Then I added about 1/2 head cauliflower, 1 med. sweet potato (diced), 1 cup frozen peas (thawed by rinsing in hot water), 1 red bell pepper. All veggies were RAW when I put them in the sauce. Bring to boil, reduce to simmer and serve when potatoes are done. I did add a sprinkle of salt, black pepper and about 1 Tbsp. sugar while cooking. I also added a fresh jalapeño pepper (mild one). My kids actually ate this, which was amazing. Yum! So easy and quick, made from real food... I will be adding this to our rotation. :) thanks!

Pretty Good. I followed the recipe exactly, except for doubling the curry.  Even at that, I think next time I'll triple the amount.  I will also increase the buttered crumbs or eliminate them entirely.  I liked the crunch but there wasn't enough to really make a difference.

I like other reviewers' idea about adding chick peas - I may do that next time.  I served with rice and sauteed chicken.

I made a few small to this, and it came out incredible!! My family and I couldn't stop eating... i used half a cup of mayo, and half a cup (perhaps even a little more) of milk... added a tablespoon of corn starch into the batter to thicken it up.. skipped out on the butter on top and just sprinkled the top with breadcrumbs... and instead of 2 teaspoons of curry powder i used 4! I also added a can of chickpeas in. Will def keep making this, the flavor was amazing....

My hubby and I thought this was great.  I used low fat mayo and campbells 98% fat free cream of chicken.  I also used three teaspoons of curry.  I'm on a diet so I skipped the extra calories of the cracker and butter topping.  This will be repeated.

Yum!  This was very good!  I had to leave out the curry because I was all out but I'm sure it would have been even better with it because I love curry.  In place of the curry powder I added some garlic powder.  For the cracker topping I used buttery round crackers.  This recipe came out really well.  I can't wait to make it again with the curry!  Thanks for the recipe.  :)

Very good! Even better the next day. I had this for dinner in two sittings along with some salad, and it was GONE. Added a little cayenne as suggested by another reader, and some grated Romano cheese as well.

The aftertaste of condensed soup is too strong.  Maybe it is possible to substitute with more healthier choice - a mix of sour cream and water or something similar.  Otherwise, very easy to make.

I loved this, my wife really liked it. She said she would cut the curry in half. Neither of us has had much experience with curry.  I think it was great like it was.  We had it as a side dish with Pad Thai and after a couple of bites of the main dish the Curried Cauliflower was overpowered and seemed not as flavorful.  I plan to try something similar to this as a main dish, as I think it will stand on it's own as a main course with something to beef it up.

We liked this dish very much. There was so much sauce that the next time I make it, I will double the cauliflower or add other vegetables to the dish. I would also be tempted to add some precooked chicken to the dish as well.

I have made this dish twice and love it. I gat ahead of myself the first time and mix the crackers into the mixture and it was still very good. I have also used the mixture as a dip for raw brocolli.

Amazingly yummy! I did do 1/2 mayo and 1/2 cup greek yogurt (didn't have enough mayo on hand) and three teaspoons of curry. Mixed the sauce well with the cauliflower and sprinkled with seasoned bread crumbs (giving it five minutes under the broiler at the end of baking gave it a nice crisp).

Reheated the dish today for lunch and it was just as good. Dish definitely needs salt and pepper, season as you wish.

Enjoy!

I was reluctant to try this recipe because of the mayo, but it was actually very good. I left off the cracker topping and added some chicken to make a one-dish meal. It has a good, mild flavor that can be spiced up simply by adding more curry powder if wanted.

This was a very good recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out well. However, I agree with a few of the other reviewers, it really doesn't need the crackers on top.

Super good. Unfortunately, no one else in the house is as enthusiastic about curry as I am. Next time I'll use 1 tsp. curry. Or my wife suggested trying cumin instead. I loved it tho'.

Really good!  I used half the mayo and added sour cream but otherwise followed the recipe.  With the exception of my 4 year old who wouldn't try it - we all went back for seconds!

Very good. Changed a couple things though. I used about 1/3 cup milk to thin out a bit more, carmelized 4 onions and mixed into sauce (only because i had them and needed to use them), and used Flipsides Crackers (1/2 cracker 1/2 half pretzle, was all I had). I think the sweetness from the onion balanced out the heat from the curry.

My husband loved this and requested it be added to our regular menu.  I have prepared it as written (although I did add more curry powder) and also with chunks of chicken breasts to make it more of a meal casserole.

My husband hates mayo - didn't recognize it in this dish and he thought overall it was great. I followed some reviewers instructions and increased the curry amount to 1 TBS; I thought it was a bit too much but hubby loved it. Since nothing is raw, I think it's best to taste test the mixture before adding addl spice.  I also skipped the crumb topping.

I loved this recipe...I consumed it in one sitting (by myself!) I used the lower fat ingredients for the milk and mayo and it still had plenty of flavor. I increased the curry to 1.25 tbs for more flavor.

Not complicated to make. I had all of the ingredients on hand so that made it easier as well. I added frozen peas and frozen carrot cubes to my version for a bit of color. I like a variety of colors in my meals. Even the boyfriend liked it. Good recipe-- thanks!

This was very tasty and a good way to get the non cauliflower eaters to enjoy this vegetable. I found the sauce a little thin and would enjoy a stronger curry flavour but overall a nice sidedish. I will make again.

WOW!!  i was afraid this recipe would be too salty, but it's perfect!  so crisp on top and savory.  i threw in a cup or two of frozen peas.  i think you could really add any veggies you like, and this would still be fantastic.  would make an impressive potluck or dinner party dish for sure.  may not want to make it at home alone tho.  it's really tough to stop eating this stuff!

AWESOME! This sauce was wonderful! I bet it would be good on a lot of different veggies. I must have had a small head of cauliflower, because I had a bunch of extra sauce, so I used it on steamed asparagus - very good. I also didn't have curry powder, so I used half a curry cube.

This is delicious and easy. I had all ingredients on hand but the curry powder I have is Mild, so I ended up doubling it and adding a few teaspoons of chilli powder after I tasted the sauce. Perhaps not the absokutee healthiest recipe it could be due to the mayonnaise but it really hit the spot and was a nice treat.  I will make again.

I thought this recipe was just okay. I like more spice and this seemed kind of bland to me. That being said, I shared it with some coworkers in the break room at lunch the next day and they really raved about it, even going back for seconds. I should say that the curry powder I had on hand was not one that I cared for. I think I’ll give it another shot with a different curry powder before I write it off completely.

Delicious and very easy to make. All family loved it. I doubled curry powder to give extra bite. I also added a bit of grated cheese to top. The crackers gives this dish some more texture.

Would make again, but my husband isn't a curry fan so would probably decrease amount slightly or not add at all.

We all loved it. The recipe as listed was great but if you don't have the exact ingredients or want to reduce the fat, similar consistency items will work fine as the curry is the main force in this meal.

This is a favourite is our house! I only make it on special occasions, like when I find a cauliflower for less than $8 at the grocery store. Cream of mushroom works just fine, but I generally add some broccoli or some other veggie because there's a lot of sauce otherwise. Very tasty!

this was very good.  I was looking for a main dish for my husband and me, so I browned some chicken breast with mushrooms and scallions with the cauliflower and covered it all,with the sauce.  baked at 350 uncovered for about 30 minutes.  it was a hit.  the cauliflower was crisp but tender and the chicken was moist.  I will make this again

This just became a favorite to add to my go-to recipes. To cut calories I used plain low-fat yogurt and fat free sour cream instead of mayo and 30 calorie Almond milk instead of milk. And added fresh chopped rosemary. Cooked as directed. Absolutely fabulous. I did let it get nice and Brown for that extra flavor.

I made this recipe as it is published and it was delicious. I could have made a meal of it, with nothing else. Even my hubby, who doesn't like cauliflower, said it was good. Thank you Samdee for the recipe. It's a keeper.

I love this recipe. I used cream of mushroom soup and add chopped jalapeño peppers to kick it up a notch. I also top it with a few toasted, chopped pecans instead of bread crumbs.

Made as suggested it makes a lot of sauce and my cauliflower came out too soft.  I should've only added part of the sauce I think.  We liked the crunchy drier bits on top.  :(

This is a long lost favorite recipe. Made it and it was delicious! I would give it 5 stars. I omitted the crackers and butter at the end and just put the casserole under the broiler for a few minutes.

I used 1/2 c sour cream instead of 3/4 c mayonnaise and left out the milk.  I also used bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs and added black pepper.  It turned out very flavorful, it didn't even need salt.

This recipe is like crack. It's amazing!!! Every place I make it, people can't get enough of it. I have to remind myself leftovers aren't a bad thing in this case. It's even awesome microwaved the next day, if there's any left of course. :0)

delicious, I did add cooked chicken, shredded steamed carrots, a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper and garlic powder. Doesn't need the butter or crackers. Served it over brown/wild rice. Next time will include the rice in the casserole.

This recipe is easy, tasty, and quick. If you don't have time to bake it, just warm sauce ingredients in a sauce pan and pour over hot, steamed cauliflower in baking dish. Sprinkle buttered bread crumbs on top and broil on low fro 3 minutes or until crumbed topping browns. It's superb.

We just had this for supper and it was really good.   I added a few carrots for colour contrast.  As I am typing this I realize that I forgot the crumb topping.  I put it in a clay pot and cooked it on the back of the BBQ instead of heating up the oven it worked great and went very well the steak and baked potatoes.

This a very good.  I had a recipe like this and lost it and then found this online.  I added cheddar cheese and it makes it better.  I just sprinkled cheddar cheese in.  I think my original recipe called for maybe more.  Great!

Easy and tasty! I have used 1 tsp N'Orleans Cajun seasoning and 1 tsp curry; cauliflower and carrots in proportion of 3:1;  since there was no cream of chicken in the pantry, I put cream of mushrooms. Yum!

This was SO good!  My husband and I loved it, even our picky 9 year old really liked it, and our 1 year old too!  I omitted the crumbs on the top and doubled the curry, because we like a lot of curry flavor and it always smells stronger than it tastes.  We added a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little kick too, and it was delicious.  We've made this several times now, and I have even turned it into a casserole by adding chopped, sauteed chicken breast and some chopped celery.  Great recipe, this is permanently in my meal rotation now :)

So yummy! I made changes just because we're trying to cut out some fats in our foods! I used low-sodium chicken stock instead of soup, low fat mayo, added more Curry and left out the crackers and butter! I also added some chopped parsley at the end! For the last 5 minutes of cooking the sauce did get  thick even with just the stock so all the cauliflower pieces were covered! I can only imagine how good this is when made as stated!!!!! Thanks for the recipe!!

I think I used too much mayonaise at first so with what was leftover I cooked brown rice and mixed it in.  Had company for dinner and everyone liked it.

I'm not sure if I'll make this again or not - it was good, but not very special.   I tasted the sauce as I went, and ended up using 5 teaspoons of curry powder. I also added salt and pepper once it was cooked - if I make this again I'll put those in the sauce. I wish I had stirred the sauce into the mix before baking - it didn't trickle down as well as I'd hoped.   I added about a pound of carrots that were sitting around, and it still seemed like a lot of sauce - I could have added more veggies and been happy, or cut back on the amount of sauce.

Fantastic recipe. Delicious versatile sauce. I added a lot more veggies (carrots, peas, etc) and some chicken breasts. I think next time I would use fat free mayo and such because it is a bit unhealthy... but hopefully the veggies help a bit :P

This was very nice. To make a healthy version, I totally skipped the mayo (and used 98% fat free condensed soup).  I also used 2 tablespoons of curry (I like curry flavor), and added a touch of cumin and garlic powder. We'll use this again.  Thanks!

This is absolutely delicious and truly addicting. My boyfriend and I basically finished the whole casserole by ourselves in one night. I used Japanese bread crumbs on top (no butter), which was good, but not enough crunch. Will go by the recipe & try the crackers next time.

This recipe was good for a cauliflower option. I switched a lot of the ingredients, but kept the basics. Cauliflower (added some broccoli) cream of chicken soup, some milk, some mayo, after that, I jumped the tracks.  Subbed out the cayenne pepper for Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy blend instead of curry (1. We didn't have it, and 2. We really don't like curry), put in a little spicy mustard, a couple drops of Tabasco, and to top it off, some crushed mixed nuts (Cashews, pistachios, and almonds)instead of crackers.   I also mixed the veggies in the soup mix instead of pouring it over the top. Seemed to coat the Cauliflower a lot better, and overall made for a much tastier mix.  I was worried that I had too many flavors going on, but everything just kind of blended into the background.  Thanks for the idea. We'll be using this again.

I'm a curry lover and I had cauliflower to use up, so I decided to try it. I made this exactly as directed and the flavors were not good (I am not the type to make a recipe wrong and leave a bad review). The mayo and cream of chic soup were just wrong with the curry.  I still think curry would be nice on cauliflower but next time I'll figure out my own sauce.

I thought this was just okay.  It sauce was pretty bland so I'm glad I tried it before mixing it with the cauliflower.  After I added some cumin and ground coriander it was much better.  I also cut the sauce ingredients in half because I wanted to just coat the cauliflower and serve with chicken saagwala.

This recipe was quick and easy.  I love that it required so few ingredients that I already had on hand.  I made a few adjustments.  I added carrots and bell peppers.  I used lo fat mayo, skim milk, cream of mushroom soup, cumin, onion powder, garlic salt, and a bit of brown sugar.  It sounds like a lot of changes, but this was a great base, and the changes were for my tastes.  It seemed like it was missing a little zing.  Glad I found it. Will be serving it tonight over Jasmine rice.

The only reason I couldn't give this a 5 star is because I had to modify some of the ingredients based on what I had in my kitchen.  I used 1/2 fat mayo and low sodium cream or chiken soup.  I only  had approx. 1 teaspoon of curry powder left so had to use some tumeric and cumin in place of the second teaspoon of curry.  It was fabulous!  Everybody except my 9 year old son loved it....and since the smell of curry makes him nauseous I didn't expect him to like it.  Will be making it often.

I followed the recipe exactly as written - using low fat cream of chicken soup as well as low fat mayonnaise to cut the calories. I used high fiber wheat crackers, but more than the 12 called for. It was excellent! This, on one attempt, has become a family favorite.

Would be better with chicken over rice than as a side dish.  Omitted the butter and just used saltines on top.  Used about 1.5 tsp extra curry powder.

Very yummy and, as many others have said, addicting. I made this a full meal by adding chopped red pepper, frozen peas, and chicken and it worked well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 was because I've had better quick-curry dishes (and healthier ones! Ack!) but this is certainly something I'll make again.

I'm sorry; I followed the recipe but just didn't like it at all.  It was too soupy and tasted too much like processed soup-in-a-can.  Would prefer the same idea without the canned soup.

This is an awesome suace; as suggested by other posted reviews it can be used on several different vegetables. Add more ingred e.g. grn or red pepper, mushrooms and chicken, serve it over pasta or rice. You have a meal itself. Great idea.

This recipe came out better than expected.  Followed the recipe as written, but without the butter&crackers mixture.  Sauce came out creamy and yummy. Could see it working well as full-fledged casserole with additional ingredients:  Chicken, bell peppers, onions...

I didn't care for this dish, but it might have been because I substituted yogurt for the mayonnaise. I also thought it was too saucy. You could probably use two heads of cauliflower.

This recipe was fine but didn't stand out. Also, there was too much sauce.  My husband thought it would be good as a cassarole with chicken, broccoli and red bell pepper added.  I'm not sure I'll make it again, but if I do it will be as a main dish with those ingredients.
