This was really good. I added my own touch, but overall it is a good base recipe.

I added bamboo and watercress to the veggie stir fry and topped it with fresh green onions and a squeeze of lime. Otherwise followed the recipe and loved it. The kids and family loved it too. This will for sure be in regular rotation with all kinds of different veggies depending upon what we have on hand!
