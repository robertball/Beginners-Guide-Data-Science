I did learn why you shouldn't boil at the end, not even a simmer, the milk curdles and you end up with a pot of watery curdles.

I made the recipe as stated and it came out really bland. I spiced it up with salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. After this is was pretty good, just not what I was expecting. I put the soup in the blender on the liquify setting, and the consistency I got was that of cream of wheat. Not bad, but not great either. I would give this four stars with the added spices, but I can't say I will make this again. It was fun to try it, though!
