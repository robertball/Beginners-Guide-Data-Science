This is definitely a five star recipe with a couple of changes. I added a tsp of cinnamon, a tsp of orange extract, used 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 cup applesauce. The texture is fabulous and the flavor is out of this world. Next time I make it, and I will make it again, I will use brown sugar instead of white sugar.

I like the concept of using applesauce instead of oil. I would add extra cinnamon and perhaps vanilla or orange extract to enhance the flavor of this bread. Perhaps, add more butter and use only 1/2 cup of applesauce.

I baked this as muffins dividing the batter between 12 standard greased muffin cups. Baked for bout 25 minutes and that worked well. I think it needed more orange flavor for our taste but otherwise a good recipe.

I would have liked this better with more butter and less applesauce. It came out fine, though, if a bit more dense than I expected. That's not necessarily a bad thing, just not exactly what I expected given the amount of baking powder. This recipe made 12 large muffins for me, 23 minutes at 350. Thanks for sharing!

I really liked the idea of using a minimal amount of fat in this recipe. It was tasty and not too sweet. Next time I'll add some toasted pecans or walnuts. A great little breakfast bread that will be perfect with my morning coffee!

This is a really nice bread. Very well balanced and tasty. Perfect for the holidays. I added an extra teaspoon of orange extract and half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder. I'm sure I'll bake it again in the future.

I've made it and am bringing it to work for a bake sale. I haven't tried it yet but I did make a couple of small tweaks. I added mixed peel (the kind you make fruit cake with) instead of just grated orange peel and I glazed the whole thing with orange blossom flavored icing. I'll post an update and a picture once I get it to work and get feedback. :-)

I felt the recipe lacked flavour as it is .  I made it a second time and added 1 tsp of cinnamon, increased the Orange rind, added 1 tsp of vanilla, a pinch of salt and some walnuts.  Because I only added 1/2 cup of applesauce the batter was to dry and added 1/2 cup of milk both times I made this loaf.  I substituted chopped dates for the cranberries the second time simply because I didn't have any dried cranberries. I liked the dates for a change.   With the changes I made I really liked the loaf.

I'm a huge fan of orange and cranberry together.  My aunt got me started on this flavor combination about 20 years ago and I always made an orange and cranberry bread while helping her cook and bake for the holidays. I chose this recipe in remembrance of her. Easy to make, great flavor and good texture.

We liked this quite well, although I think I would be inclined to use plain applesauce.  This will work for a diabetic friend, using unsweetened applesauce.  Very nice, indeed, thank you.

We enjoyed this bread, but for us the orange was a bit strong. I would make a few adjustments next time.

I thought this was really good!  I made it for a brunch I hosted for 17 people.  It was enjoyed with a cup of coffee. I used a little more orange peel than called for because I wanted more orange flavor.

Very good even without the egg, I did and it was no different. Try dried blueberries and lemon peel instead of cranberries and orange peel. A good variation!

Nice recipe, not sweet.  I made as muffins and they baked up in about 18 minutes.  I used fresh cranberries that I chopped up in place of dried.  I would give these more sugar and a healthy dose of vanilla extract next time.  Also more orange zest.  Will make again with my changes.

Delicious!- I used chunky Apple sauce  and added cinnamon to taste.  I added a little extra orange zest from a very fragrant navel orange and it gave a nice orange flavor.  I did  have to increase baking time.  An instant favorite!

This is a very moist and flavorful tea bread. I love the addition of any citrus zest in recipes, and the amount of orange zest in this recipe was just perfect for us.

A terrific bread with coffee or tea.  It was moist, but held together well.  Loved the cranberry in it, but the orange zest made it just a tad bitter to me.  A little butter slathered on takes care of that.  It was easy, fast, and really very good.  Thanks, Motts!!

Here's what I did differently.  I did not use the applesauce ( I didn't have any).  Instead of dried cranberries, I used whole berry cranberry sauce from Bluewater Farms and 1/2 cup of fresh-squeezed orange juice.  The tea bread was moist with just the right amount of tartness and sweetness.  I will make this tea bread again when I want a sweet treat. As a bonus, the family ate it up.

I changed the recipe up a bit and used mandarin orange slices instead of orange zest.  I doubled the recipe to make individual breads for gift-giving and baked for 30 minutes.  I have a bread pan that makes 21 individual loaves and doubling this recipe made 20.  This is a nice bread - dense and not sweet.  Very moist thanks to the applesauce.  Will make again.

I thought this bread was just ok. The flavor was very basic and it was a little too sweet. It needs salt, vanilla, cinnamon and some nutmeg to really bring out the flavor. It also didn’t hold shape when it was sliced and left a crumbly mess. I won’t make this recipe again.

This is delicious, although a very dense bread (was exactly what I wanted, but I could see how some folks would be thrown by that). I did have to bake it for about 50-55 minutes, but that was the only thing I changed.

I've made this a few times and it's really good and super easy. I use butter and since I haven't been able to find the cinnamon apple sauce, just add about a half tsp of cinnamon to regular unsweetened apple sauce. I used craisins (as I had them on hand) instead of plain dried cranberries, which I'm sure upped the sweetness quotient since there's added sugar.
