I have not made this recipe, but the chef Aarti S suggested adding 2 tsp of malted vinegar (or apple cider vinegar) at the end of cooking  to expose the flavors

Made exactly as described and my family gobbled it up.  Delicious.  Not hard to make, quick prep.

We just put in 2 serving of ground cumin instead of cumin seeds. It was very quick and easy to make, and tasted simply delicious! It was just a little bit spicy for the young ones in my family- you might want to leave the peppers out.

It’s good, it just needed a lot more salt than the recipe called for. Other than that, pretty easy and my family loved it. We served it with small flour tortillas and made wraps... an Indian family I know does it this way but they use Roti (Indian flatbread similar to flour tortilla but to me, a little less tasty).

My picky hubby who is  not a lover of spices loved this. I'm definitely going to make it again, some time soon.

Yummy, easy dish! I made a mild version and left out the jalapeños and chili powder so my kids would eat it. All four of my kids ate this well, even my 18 month old! In the future, I will add more salt and more curry powder to substitute the lack of heat when making for my family. I served this with jasmine rice and a side of sweetened plain yogurt to mix in.

- more salt and spices (although too much spice and it has a nutty bitterness)
- added mushrooms

I thought this was great, my husband didn't like it as much as I did. He found it a little bland. Could have used a little more of a kick as I think one jalapeno gets lost. Next time, I will keep it on the stove for a few hours to let the spices meld. This recipe does not allow for enough time for them to fully absorb. I scramble fried the beef separately, drained and then added to the liquid as I couldn't bring myself to consume the fat it would render in the dish. I will make this again. Thanks This One Woman.
