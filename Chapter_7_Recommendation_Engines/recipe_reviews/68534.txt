This dissappointed me very very much. Tasted nothing like a pizza, it was very sour tasting and very salty. The topmato paste and tomato soup is too much. Also did horrible things to my stomach.

I did cut the recipe in 1/2 but that should not change my review.  This was just food, nothing special

I loved this; instead of ground beef, I used extra lean ground turkey, then I added turkey pepperoni and fresh parmesan, in addition to fresh basil and oregano. This is a huge hit.

This was pretty good. I did change a a few things based on what I had on hand. I didn't use tomato soup because I didn't have any on hand, instead I found a jar of pizza sauce and used that. I'll make these again but I'm thinking next time I'll use mozzarella or the white queso cheese.
