Really a great comfort food casserole  with a yummy combination of cheeses. If you like lasagna you will love this because it is easier to make.  My husband is not a big fan of vegetables but he really liked this!  I will make it again.

Delish! Perfect comfort food. I added more sauce -2 cups instead of 1. Thatâ€™s the only change.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe.  Everyone liked it.   I was a little apprehensive at first because the kale has a distinct aroma,  but it all works together very well.  It's a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.
