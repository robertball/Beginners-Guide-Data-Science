Best tex-mex casserole.  Loved the Mexican rice.  We baked it for 55 minutes - would add another 1/4 c. liquid.

This casserole was AMAZING!  I made a couple small alterations.  One, I filled the soup can with water and used that instead of 1/2 cup and it worked great!  I also mixed some cheese in with the rice, corn, soup, salsa mix because my boyfriend LOVES cheese and it made it really great.  I suggest topping it with sour cream when you eat it!  I will Definitely be making this again!

My family loved this. Even my picky 5yr old!! It was sooo easy and quick to make also. Mix everything together in the same pan you cook it in. Less mess to clean up!! Followed the recipe exactly as written. Chicken came out nice and moist. Rice was perfect. Loved everything about this recipe. :) Not sure how people can rate this WHEN THEY CHANGE THE RECIPE!! It is good AS IS!! My kids are VERY picky and this is one recipe that they LOVE!! thanks for such a great recipe

This recipe is EXCELLENT! (with my mods of course!) To give it more flavor and color here is what I did: I used 6 breasts since I was cooking for 5 people. I cut them into strips, and then halves, and cooked them in a skillet with chicken taco seasoning. For my rice mixture I used mild rotel instead of salsa, a soup can of water, almost a whole can of corn, 1 cup of rice, and one can of black beans. Topped it with my chicken peices and then covered the entire thing with a thin layer of chedder cheese. Baked for 45 minutes, and for the last 5-10 minutes I scattered sliced black olives on top. Served with a dallop of sour cream on the side and it was AMAZING! I had 0 leftovers and eveyone raved about it. We will be making this again for years to come. Next time I might mix the cheese with sour cream and some chopped jalapenos to spread on the top for extra flavor. SO GOOD!!!

My family (husband and kids 2, 4, and 12) really like this with my changes: Cooked cubed chicken breast in a pkg of taco seasoning (in pan with oil). Then added it to the pan with other ingredients (after adding the can of water to the pan to get all the seasoning from the pan).Used 1 can of water instead of 1/2 c.  Also, added 2 cloves of raw garlic, & almost 2 c. of rice. Due to extra rice I added 1 can condensed ckn broth and 1 can water. Only added 1/2 c. of salsa due to taco seasoning and fear it would be too spicy for the kids. It was still a little spicy with taco seasoning (and I'm not afraid of spice, but my kids are picky about it) Waited till end to add cheese.  I actually thought it was better BEFORE I added the cheese. In the future I will just top it with cheese when served.  sorry, not sure if its fair to rate this with the change of using taco seasoning, but just wanted to give changes/info to others.

To those who are kind of tired of the do-or-die condensed soup recipes - in a pinch, I subbed a can of chicken gravy for the condensed soup. You don't even miss it! Tasted great! Ofcourse, you can always kick it up with hot sauce or peppers as I did too. Thanks so much for sharing!

Loved it!! I added 1 package of taco sesoning mix instead of the just the paprika and 1 can of Rotel instead of salsa. Gave it more flavor. For EASY chicken I used Tyson pre-cooked diced chicken. Also great with either chili, pinto or black beans. Very versatile recipe.

This is a quick and easy recipe took all of 10 minutes to throw it together and stick it in the oven. It was very good as is. I made it again and needed to double it so I changed it to do that. I added one cream of chicken soup and one can of cheddar cheese soup. Instead of 2 cups of corn, I  put 1 can of corn and 1 can of black seasoned beans in.  I also used the yellow seasoned rice and used more water.  If you like it hot a Jalapeno pepper would give it a good kick

I have tried this the original way and it was DELICIOUS!  But, I have made it with alterations due to the ingriedents I had on hand, as well.  I used cheddar cheese soup and a can and a half of chicken broth mixed with 3/4 packet of taco seasoning, corn, diced tomatoes, black beans, rice and cheddar cheese mixed in..........threw chicken tenderloin pieces on top and covered then put mexican cheese on top.....BOTH WAYS ARE DELICIOUS!!!  A GREAT RECIPE!

The rice did not get done.  I used store brand salsa not Pace but that shouldn't have mattered.  There was something wrong with the rice to water ratio.

My family loves this recipe.  I would suggest cooking the chicken in a frying pan.  Season chicken with cumin, garlic and pepper.  Also we add vegetables like green peppers, onions and tomatoes.  Saute vegetables in pan that chicken was cooked.

This was pretty good, I think that it could use a little something else to spice it up a little bit, maybe a little taco seasoning or something.  But overall, pretty good.

This was not very good, the rice didn't cook right and it lacked flavor.  I would rather use a box of chicken helper for something like this.

This was really good! Like everyone else, I made a few changes. I used two cans of shredded chicken for the texture (and because it was all the chicken I had!), substituted Green Giant Southwestern Corn (with black beans and red peppers already in the can), brown rice, and used a can of mild Rotel instead of salsa. To add a kick of flavor, I also added a packet of fajita seasoning and mixed the Mexican Cheese in before I put in the oven. I had to cook the casserole for an hour and 5 minutes to fully cook the rice and achieve the right level of thickness. I finished things off by serving over a bed of tortilla chips and topping it off with sour cream. Delicious!

Short version: I enjoyed this & will be making it again. Super easy, 10 min from in the pantry to in the oven. Details: I followed the recipe except for using a whole, undrained can of corn (b/c other reviewers had complained of uncooked rice for lack of moisture). Cut 4 quite large chicken breasts in 1/2 to control portion size when done. Cooked covered for 60 minutes at 375 & everything turned out great. There may be a bit too much liquid for my taste, but just barely, so I'll drain the corn next time. Also, if you're cooking for adults, use a medium heat salsa & experiment with adding some cayanne or dash of hot sauce to up the heat a bit; as written this recipe is not bland, but it IS family friendly & keeping kids in mind. :)

This is a must try recipe!  I've made it several times as stated (I don't drain the can of corn) although I've found it takes at least an hour covered baking time even if the chicken breasts are sliced.  Or double the recipe and double the time.    As others have suggested, I've also added sautéed onion and celery and a can of drained and rinsed black beans to the mix, plus a small can of black sliced olives with the cheese toward the end of baking time, then served with lettuce, tomatoes  and sour cream on the side.  Scrumptious!

If you need an easy tasty dinner for the family, this is your meal. However, we felt it needed more kick for just adults. I had to leave it in the oven another 15-20 minutes as the rice was still crunchy after 45.

We tried this recipe last night and really liked it.  It's very tasty!  I didn't change a thing.  However, after 45 minutes in the oven at 375 degrees, the chicken was NOT fully cooked so we had to put it back in.  Next time I will bake it for at least 1 hour at 400-425 degrees.

FIVE STARS!!!  This was fantastic!  VERY creamy and flavorful without being spicy (for those who can't handle much spice).  I also used the cream of chicken can to measure the water.  Forgot to add the paprika but it didn't matter... it was FANTASTIC!

I seasoned the chicken first, next time, though, I will add the recommended amount of ingredients instead of following the reviews, my rice came out a little dry.

Delicious flavor. I used skinless boneless chicken thighs. I used 1 soup can of water which was a little too much next time i will go with 3/4 cup water.

I cooked mine about an hour. 

very delicious

I used brown rice and that was probably why my rice was chewy and the sauce was soupy.  Great flavor though and the cheesy rice would make a great dip.

This was really good. I do confess that I too added a can of green chilies, a can of black beans, a med. chopped onion and the whole can of corn (14.5 or 15oz) instead of a cup.

I told my husband that I was going to try something new and you can imagine the look on his face. He was pleasantly surprised when he tried this and said it tasted really good and went back for seconds.

This was yummy, but after 45 minutes the chicken was totally raw. And I used boneless chicken tenderloins. We wound up cooking it for another 45 minutes, ordered a pizza in the meantime, and then heated it up the next night for 45 minutes. Amazingly, the chicken was still delish!  I substituted brown rice, and instead of adding water, I used the water that was in the can of corn. Next time, I'll season the chicken a little more, but overall, once it was thoroughly cooked, it was very good.

I made this recipe for my family, and they absolutely loved it. My husband and son said it was a "keeper!" I didn't change a thing but adding additional  1/4 cup water to it. I thought it was very tastey.

Made this past week. I used brown rice instead of white, one can of water like other reviews said, but it must have been because I used brown rice, it was a little too watery. I think next time I will spice it up more with black beans, green chilies or something as the rice had good flavor but the chicken needed more flavor.

This was a SUPER easy dinner and had really great flavors. I topped with sourcream and garnished with lettuce.  The only problem I had was with my rice.  It didn't cook all the way because it needed more water.  I'd recommend filling the soup can with water, versus the 1/2 cup.    Also, I really like how you could add whatever you wanted (olives, jalapenos, beans, etc) to make it a little different each time :)

This was very good. I sprinkled the chicken with some taco seasoning ,and sprinkled with cheese at the end of baking. I did find it needed about 55 minutes to bake. As other reviewers did I also used a soup can's worth of water. The rice was perfectly cooked. I actually would have liked this spicier, so will use medium or hot salsa next time. topped with sour cream and chopped green onion.

this came out delicious!  Made it just as the recipe stated except put a mixture of cheddar and mozzarella cheese on top (and a lot of it, too;  we're cheese freaks at our house).  It was filling, very tasty, and easy to make:  a great combination!  Thank you!

This was surprisingly delicious!  I only used 3 chicken breasts, and added a can of black beans.  Even the leftovers are good, and I think would be awesome in a tortilla. Will definitely make again.

I used 10 oz of water in recipe due to suggestions. I also cooked longer due to people saying rice wasn't cooked It came out great. If there we 1/2 scores I would rate a 4.5

Super easy way to serve chicken...I just cut up a pound of chicken tenders and coated them with a little chili and garlic powder for extra flavor.  I also added a can of black beans.  The kids loved it.  Start checking your rice at the 45 minute mark...at an hour the rice was a little overcooked for us.

As others have said the rice didnt get done :( which is super sad. It has been in the oven for an hour now and the rice is still not done. I mixed everything together minus the chicken and then poured it in my casserole chaffing dish and then cubed the chicken.  The only things I have/will change is to cube the chicken, add pento beans, and cook the rice separate to make sure it is cooked and serve under the bake when the chicken was done.

This is an edit... I have since taken my dish out of the oven and pretty much the rice not being done RUINS it. As is I have to rate this recipe a 1 but if your remove the rice and cook it separately it would def be a 4 or 5. its tastes great.

I love this recipe.  It is super tasty and easy to make.  Its only downfall is the way that it looks.  Instead of regular long grain rice I used a bag of a rice that had black beans and a Cuban flavor to it.  So good.

Loved this recipe. So easy and fast to put together. I made it ahead one evening for  the next day which was very busy. Have made it several times. I added the black beans as someone else suggested. When not preparing for children will also add the green chili salsa

My family & a friend enjoyed it! I supplemented the chicken breast with wings & thighs. They said the thighs and wings tasted better and was more moist  than the breast.

This was incredibly easy and SO good!  I added a can of drained/rinsed black beans, used quick cooking rice, and added a little more water.  I can't wait to make this again.  I'm happy to have found a quick-assembly weeknight recipe!

I didn't have chicken breasts thawed so I used a can of chicken instead. I also added a can of black beans and extra corn. Ended up cooking it for one hour because the rice wasn't quite done at 45 minutes.

AWESOME and EASY! I added a can of no salt black beans and because some reviewers noted it was bland I added generous sprinkles of smoked chipotle to the top of the chicken with the paprika.  I also filled the can of cream of chicken with water to add a bit more liquid. Turned out great!

Quick, easy, and delicious. Not too mention it looks extremely appetizing. I followed what other reviewers said and added a full can of water instead of the 1/2 can the recipe suggested. Simply delicious. With all the household ingredients on hand, and such an easy recipes it gets 5 stars, and is definitely a keeper for me.

Easy Quick and Yummy! I used bone in fryer and added 30 minutes. Next time I would add more rice and some black  or kidney beans - or even better one of those S&W southwest style cans of beans.  Serve w/a salad and you've got a very satisfying and delicious meal without a lot of kitchen time.  THANK YOU!

Needs to cook 55mins or rice is undercooked.  I made 1/2 recipe (2 pieces of chicken instead of 4).  Added about 1/8 cup water extra and some cheese to rice mix.  Then topped the chicken with paprika, ceyanne pepper, salt, pepper and garlic.

This was a definite keeper! I made this and my whole family loved it. Even my very picky son who always says "its okay" when I ask how dinner was. He loved this. We did have leftovers, only because we got full, but they didn't last long at all. I will be making this time and time again.

This is one of my favourite meals!  Instead of water though I use chicken broth - MUCH TASTIER!  I find I have to boil the rice just a few mins before mixing it together though.

This has become a staple in our house hold suppers. I've even been able to convert it into a slow-cooker meal and have frozen several prepped packages in the freezer. Over time I've made some changes: I substitute taco seasoning instead of paprika, sometimes I switch up the cream of chicken to a can of condensed tomato soup.

If it's in the slow-cooker:
I add chicken, soup,  frozen corn, chopped red bell pepper, one chopped onion and one package of taco seasoning to the slow-cooker and set on high for 4 hours or until chicken is cooked (I also freeze all these ingredients in a bag then take it out the night before).  Once chicken is done, I shred the chicken with forks, add 3 cups of cooked rice and mix in cheese. I sprinkle cheese on top then keep it on high until cheese is melted.

Thought it was super easy and tasty. Didn't use as much corn (only because I don't like corn that much), but it turned out okay. Maybe would have tasted better if the chicken was seasoned (with taco seasoning, for example). Good though!

I used a can of water like others suggested and baked for 55 minutes. The rice was completely uncooked.

Taste was okay but was too runny and needed something a little extra... may try it again but add more rice and something to give it a little more flavor.

This was tasty and easy to make. To give it a bit more flavor I used 1.5 cups of salsa instead of 1 cup. Most of the items I have on hand too which is nice.

I didnt have any pace or salsa so I made up the box of rice a roni spanish rice I had by the box. Didn't need to add the water and rice because of that. During the last 5 or 10 minutes of baking i broke up chips and then spread the cheddar cheese. My hubby loved it and so did I. Served with a side of guacamole and sour cream.

This recipe was great! I did make some alterations and cubed the chicken and added taco seasoning. I used 1 can of rotel, 1 can of kernal corn, black beans, soup and rice.  Topped the rice mixture with  taco seasoned chicken and topped with cheese.  Went over very well!

This was so delicious! I used Rotel instead of salsa, and blanched frozen veggies instead of plain corn, curry powder instead of paprika and 3/4 cups water instead of just 1/2 and cooked for 45 mins. It took 1-2 mins for the cheese to melt in the end. Chicken was perfectly cooked through. So good, definitely making this recipe again.

Very easy dish to prepare.  Personally I would give this recipe 2-3 stars because the soup/rice mixture did smell like puke when I was mixing it and that grossed me out but once baked my family really loved it so I have to at least give it 4 stars.  I even had to make it the next day for them.  I cut up the chicken when it was done baking so that everyone would get some chicken (we have 3 teens & 2 adults eating) and then mixed it back into the rice.  The next day I made it I added Rotel tomatoes with green chiles and a can of cheddar cheese soup as I didn't have any more shredded cheddar cheese.  Not alot of taste difference.

This was just ok, I don't think I'd make it again as directed, it was pretty blah on taste and we had to add plenty of salt to make it edible. I think adding some spices before cooking would help significantly bolster the taste.

Loved this easy and flavorful dish!  I even forgot to add the cheese on the top at the end, but it still tasted amazing!  Added green chilies for a little extra kick.  I think the 45 minutes is probably enough time to fully cook the chicken breasts (unless they are large)... My chicken was a little dry after the 55 minutes suggested by others.  I also may try soaking the rice beforehand next time.  Mine was a tiny bit undercooked, but that was probably due to the fact that I increased the entire recipe and didn't put enough extra water in or something.  Will definitely be making this dish again!

Amazing and ! After reading other reviews I added a box of Zatarain's New Orleans Style Red Beans and Rice in place of 3/4 cup long-grain rice. I also went with the can of water in place of the 1/2 cup and baked for 55 min rather than 45. This casserole had SOOOO much flaver! next time I am going to top it with a liltte green chile sauce!! :)
