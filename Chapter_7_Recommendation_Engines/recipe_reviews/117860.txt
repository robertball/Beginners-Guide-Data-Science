I was happily surprised with this salad and will make again. The only thing I might change in the future is adding less sugar. It was a bit too sweet for my liking.

Delicious.  I substituted the sugar for a squirt of diabetic-friendly sweetner, and tossed in a litte mustard to the dressing.  Wedges of boiled egg and cubes of cheddar added to the salad just prior to serving made it a complete vegetarian dinner - YUM

I made this today, but I omitted the pickle and peanuts, since I didn't have any. I also used 3 packets of Splenda for the sugar in the dressing. It was plenty sweet with just the 3 packets.  A great recipe! YUM!

I really did like this but I would say it takes more than 20 minutes to make,if you don't pre-cut all the ingredients and the dressing? well,it could be better but it's good. Try it.

Everyone raved about this recipe and wanted it.  The only changes I made was raw cashews (all I had)  instead of peanuts and 1/4 c simple syrup instead of 2/3 C sugar.

This is so good!  A friend made this and gave me a container of it, ever since my hubs has been on me to make it.  I didn't have cider vinegar so I used half red wine vinegar and half white vinegar.  I used roasted red peppers because that's what I had - one whole green pepper, and only about 1/4 c sugar and it's still delicious!  I didn't have sweet pickles either.  This is a crunchy, delicious salad!

I liked the idea but not the proportions of this salad.  I ended up using only zucchini and red onions for the salad, and keeping the dressing but with a lot less sugar and a bit more salt.  It was very good.

Delicious!  We all loved it!  I added 1 diced crisp, tart apple along with ROASTED and SALTED peanuts.  Great with anythong on the grill.  Thanks!

Followed other's advice and cut sugar to 1/3 cup.  Did not have sweet pickles so used about 1/4 cup sweet pickle relish.  Used walnuts instead of peanuts and added about 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper.  Delicious.

Awesome salad. This is so easy to doctor up according to what you may have on hand so it's different each time - I like to add edammame and shredded almonds for protein, and leave out the peppers and peanuts and pickles, just adding other fresh veggies from my fridge - shredded spinach, etc...I also recommend lowering the amount of oil and vinegar mixture at the beginning and adding more to taste.

Took less time to cut everything up with mandolin and then instead of peanuts I used walnuts and it gave it that extra kick.  Marinated it for at least 2 hours before serving.  Other than that, it was pretty darn good at the end of the season for zucchini.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup. It was still slightly too sweet for my family's taste, but we liked it. Colorful and tasty

Great tasting!  Even my kids ate it!  I did increase the chopped peanuts to 1/2 cup - and the salad had a wonderful "crunch" to it.  It's a keeper for our family.

Excellent salad!  Also added a large seeded, diced cucumber, omitted the peanuts because I didn't have any and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  DH loved it! Great way to use up whatever summer veggies you have on hand.

This was really good! We have a green pumpkin plant that looks similar to zucchini and this is a great way to use it up! The peanuts added a nice crunch. We cut the sugar down to about 1/4 cup, there's no need for more than that. We'll definately make this again. Thanks!!

What a wonderful, light, refreshing salad.  A great healthier way to use an abundance of zucchini from the garden.

I was very nervous about serving this to my guests.  But couldn't deny all the comments that people had made on here.  All I can say is WOWZER!  I got the same comments.  They LOVED it...I loved it and even my non vegatable eating sister loved it!  Thanks will make this again.

I basically made this salad as directed, and it was very good (I reduced the sugar ever so slightly and used sweet pickle relish in lieu of diced sweet pickeles).  This salad provided a nice contrast/went well with spicy mexican food.

It was a nice healthy-type salad that used an abundant ingredient. I took it to a party and the recipe was requested by a family that appreciates healthy food. I will make it again next summer. I am going to try to make it a little more exciting.
