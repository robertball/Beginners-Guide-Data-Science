I have to confess that I totally forgot the butter, so maybe the butter could take it from 4 to 5 stars. I also got impatient and didn't cook it long enough, so the texture was a bit thin. But it tasted great and my family enjoyed it.

This recipe really appealed to me.  The only change I made was to add an extra egg yolk; I like my puddings quite thick.  It smelled and tasted wonderful when warm, but not so much when cold.  It also separated and became runny when cold.  But warm and fresh, YUM.  I will try it again.

I had some very ripe bananas and was looking for something to use them in.  I decided to double this recipe and then put it in a shortbread pie crust.  I omitted the pineapple since it would have not fit into the crust.  It was delicious. I loved the orange flavoring in it,;with the coconut and banana flavors, it was very good indeed.  It was also something different than our usual pudding flavors.

11.10.15  In an effort to reduce the fat and calories, I used skim milk, light coconut milk, Egg Beaters®, and Splenda®, and it still was very satisfying.   All ingredients partner well with each other, and the pudding is very creamy.  Next time, I’ll try this recipe with lime zest which I think will give it a totally different and bolder flavor profile.  Wouldn’t hesitate to serve this to company.  Enjoyed chilled, garnished with toasted coconut and a sprig of mint and served with toasted coconut thin cookies (from Trader Joe’s).
