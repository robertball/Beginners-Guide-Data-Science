This was wonderful!!  I used over whole wheat spaghetti & my entire family loved it... even my picky eater.  I also tried it again over Halibut & it was a huge hit.  My daughter (who doesn't like fish) ate an entire piece.  I will try it over baked chicken next.  This will be a regular dish in our house.

My husband said this was "interesting" but he liked it a lot.  I added Feta to the sauce and tossed with penna.  The sauce was a little salty, so be careful about adding too much salt to your pasta, it however was very good and we loved to sop up the left over with bread.  I only simmered about 30 minutes, but don't feel it caused the taste to suffer at all.

I've never written a review, but this pasta sauce very much deserve it. I cook every day(cause I enjoy it) and so I've tried tons of recipes. After I made this sauce, couple nights ago, I was speachless how good it tastes. My husband could not stop adding more to his plate and that says it all. I cooked it for an hour and a half. I think it is a long time of cooking it, that it gives all the ingredients time to blend together to a fantastic flavor. Thank you for the incredible recipe. I will be making this dish again, very soon.

This was truly amazing, we loved it.  We cooked cubed chicken breast along with the garlic and onion, stirred penne pasta into the skillet.  The blend of tomatoes, capers and olives drove us out of our minds.  We'll be making this again...and again...

Excellent recipe!! My family loved it! I cooked it with the lid off and liked the thick chuncky sauce that resulted. We also loved the hot flavor of the red pepper. We have made this sauce several times and highly recommend it. We served it over a whole wheat pasta with reduced fat feta. Really yummy!

This was good.  I forgot to cover mine while it was simmering and it was too chunky.  If it were thinner it would have been better, but that was my fault.  I used feta and served it over pasta.

It was alright. We felt that there was to much vineger. Next time I will only put 1 Tablespoon. I also added shrimp.

This sauce was awesome! I didn't have italian diced tomatoes on hand so I used regular diced and added a little bit of italian spices. I omitted the olives because I'm not a fan but it still turned out great!

Very nice. Served it with feta over rotini ... I'm not sure the pasta went quite right with it, so next time I will try it with fresh pasta, and hope it will kick it up from 'very nice' to 'amazing'.

Loved it! Made it like a typical spaghetti, but with your ingredients, and ground lamb. I would have used Feta Cheese, but I forgot I ran out. :)

I wanted to try this but I didn't have tomato sauce or Italian dices tomatoes, I used 1 can of diced regular tomatoes and 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes both not drained. I added some Italian seasoning and did the rest as stated in the recipe. I served it with whole wheat penne and I simmered Italian sweet sausage links in the sauce. It was great! Thank you so much for this recipe. I will be making this often!

Very good.  I tried it because I needed to use some olives I have had in the cupboard.  Next time I might add more olives but it was really good.  Used a large can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced and sauce.

I didn't really care for this recipe.  It could be though because I didn't care for capers in the first place-- I decided to give them a second try with this recipe and I still didn't like them.

DELICIOUS!  The smell was amazing the whole time it was cooking! I did not add any capers as I forgot to get them at the store. I added quite a bit of crushed red pepper because I love spicy food. I simmered the sauce for 1-1/2 hours and added cubed baked chicken to the last 30 minutes and then served it over whole wheat penne. The flavors complemented each other great. Definitely loved it and will make again :)

Enjoyed this simple, versatile sauce with a hint of balsamic. I threw in shrimp, scallops and calamari, which was a nice blend. I omitted the Feta. Thanks!

We really like this and have made it a few times.  A nice twist on plain old pasta sauce.  We usually cube a chicken breast (raw) and we toss it in with the sauce to cook.  Thanks!

I have been cooking this dish for my family about twice a month for the last seven months, it is delicious. I usually serve it over linguine. The only alteration I make is I cut 1 lb of chicken tenders into bite sizes and brown them in the olive oil before adding the onions. Thank you for this great recipe!

This was delicious! I love olives, so I thought to try this recipe. I added two cans of canned tomatoes and extra olives (obviously), and I sprinkled a LITTLE sugar to cut the acidity of the tomato sauce. I also added Italian seasoning to the onions while they cooked. I’m using it as pasta sauce, but I can definitely see this working on chicken or fish (I’m a vegetarian so I’ll have to hear about how good it is from my friends!).

This was delish!  I added chopped tapenade that I had in the fridge. Loved it!  Can’t wait to make it again!!

Recipe was good. I think it could have more flavor so will make again but will do some tweaking. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Cooked my fish, a couple halibut steaks, right in the sauce while it simmered the last 10 minutes; it worked well and means one less pan to wash.  I highly recommended the red pepper to add complexity, even if you only use a little.  I was only serving two so I had plenty of extra sauce, but the leftover sauce made an excellent 9x9 lasagna!  Wish I had the feta, only has parm., but will make sure I have feta around next time I make it.

Awesome! Since my husband and I both love Italian and Greek food I thought why not. I followed the recipe but didn't use Italian tomatoes I did add 1/2 ts. Of Italian seasoning. You have to rinse the capers though otherwise too salty. I did not add any additional salt since we both are watching our sodium. My husband has to have meat with his meal so I added some frozen meatballs the last hour of cooking. Liked this better than any other spaghetti sauce recipe that I've ever made. Definite keeper!!!!

This is delish! I made it exactly as per the recipe and it was wonderful. The sauce is a lot like Puttanesca in flavor. I served it over angel hair along with chicken breasts that I sautéed in olive oil, seasoned with Greek seasoning. I took left overs to work the next day. Fabulous!

We love this sauce! I've made it with different kinds of olives, including the canned sliced black olives, and it's always good (even without the cheese because we try to stay away from dairy). I usually just use a 28-ounce can of diced tomatoes and maybe a bit of tomato paste and water instead of the small can of diced and the canned sauce (which I never have). The red pepper flakes give it a delicious kick, so add them, even if only a little.

Used my immersion blender to get rid of some of the chunks knowing that it would never go over otherwise with the family, and it had a nice texture. Not at all sure why you have to use organic tomatoes.  I did not.  Will not be making this again for quite a while.

I will add a few more olives because I like their meatiness and saltiness in this dish. I also added some feta to the sauce at the end to let it melt and add some creaminess. The red pepper flakes give it another interesting dimension. This was really good and pretty easy to make. Thank you!

Easy and delicious twist on tomato-based pasta sauce!  I left out the olives (don't like them) and didn't notice that the recipe called for ITALIAN diced tomatoes so I used a normal unseasoned can and didn't add any additinal italian herbs.  Served it with parm cheese but I'm sure Feta would be even better.  My husband thought it was good but a little too "sour" for his taste, but I liked the tang.  I may try reducing the vinegar in the future and see what he thinks.

Loved it!  We added more capers, omitted olives, and served over bow-tie pasta.  Will be making this again!

this was great! the only reason it got a 4, it was a tad too salty for even me, Salty Mc Saltsalot...just be careful with salt...the capers are salty enough for the whole dish.
