Amazing recipe. Made as written, but added cilantro at the end. Crazy good. Went perfect with Dungeness. Keep the west coast seafood recipes coming, John. You're making me look good.

Wow, this made the house smell like garlic! I upped the  servings to 3, omitted the fish sauce (didn't have), and added raw cubed chicken to the sauce as the spaghetti cooked. Tasty!

So high in calories, fat and sodium ... don't think I'll make this one!  Good idea but  as present, it would be the last meal before cardiac arrest.

Easy, yet deliciously complex. Chef John never disappoints.  I will make this many times in the years to come.

I followed the instructions and made it as directed and it turned out really very good. I used half of the 12 oz Spaghetti package but next time I will use the whole package so I can have some leftovers ( or eat more). I did add some shrimp in the final step. My wife loved it. She had passed the recipe  on to our two married children because how good it was. I think ever Ingredient added up to making the dish perfect ( such as the small amount of cheese, and the small amount of green onions), so try not to leave anything out. I almost left out the green onion because I thought it might just be for color, but it added a nice flavor for the small amount called for. I have been trying to use my wok more ( great videos on wok cooking on YouTube) and this worked great in it. This  recipe is a keeper!

Added a little shrimp stock, the recipe was much too salty. Given that  the sauce consists of soy sauce, fish sauce, and Worchestershire sauce, don't think I can adjust the saltiness out without compromising the great flavor. Well maybe I over salted the pasta water!

You need to try this!   I am a native San Franciscan and have been a devoted customer at Thanh Long for at least 4 decades. (Long before the public at large discovered it and forced an expansion or two)  Having said that, Chef John is my favorite 'go to' for most recipes because he has 'the city's' culinary blood pumping thru his veins! I close my eyes when I try his recipes and am transported home! This is relevant because I was a restaurant manager for 30 plus years in the Bay Area... This is yet another 10 star recipe that I can only gift with 5!  Easy and palate pleasing.

I had some garlic noodles at Gyu-kaku and wanted to make some. I made this as written but will adjust things next time. The soy sauce was so overwhelming in the entire plate, I needed to add more Parmesan in the end. I might have overdid it with the garlic. Next time I would put less soy sauce and garlic.

I added about 6oz peeled deveined raw shrimp at step 3. This recipe is the bomb. Other changes I made include reducing the butter by half and doubling the secret sauce ingredients. Also could not find fish sauce here in deep South Texas so I left it out, but there was plenty of umami nevertheless! I could not get the parmesan to incorporate like in an alfredo sauce, so I guess I will try again tomorrow.  This recipe is seriously great!

Only changes I made we're, I used rice ramen noodles rather than spaghetti and I didn't have the fish sauce, green onions and since I can't have spicy foods, no Cayenne or red chili flakes, and we had it with some baked chicken thighs, made a super delicious dinner for two, totally satisfying and it's great for people on a budget who want Chinese noodles, but don't want or can't afford takeout. Can't wait to whip this sauce together again for rice or noodles or just whatever we're feeling!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe to the letter and it was much too overwhelmingly salty. The next time, I cut the soy sauce from 2 tbsp to 2 tsp and added water to make up the difference. With the addition of Worcestershire sauce, oyster sauce, and fish sauce and Parmesan cheese, I may completely cut out the soy sauce all together. There are enough umami bombs to make up for the lack of soy.

My family loved this dish and said that it’s a must do again. I did stir fry some chicken and broccoli and added it to give it a more hearty, main course flare. I’ll make it in the future and play with the ingredients! Thanks Chef John!

I really loved this but I would like to know a good way to make it less salty. Is there a way to keep the big flavor but loose the over-the-top saltiness?

This was very easy to make and quick to put together.  I used Maggi seasoning instead of the soy sauce. All the flavors were good except that it was very salty. I think I might cut all the salty seasonings in half.

This dish is very simple to make. It was very delicious. One thing to remember is this is very high in sodium. By reducing any of the ingredients though, will cause a loss of flavor.

I doubled the recipe and the dish was unbelievably strong in soy sauce flavors (and I used low sodium). I tried to add more pasta water,  butter and even bread crumbs to tone it down and although it helped a little, it did not taste at all like the garlic noodles I’ve tried in several well-known California restaurants.

I’ve made this several times now. I’ve chopped up and cooked some chicken thighs with some garlic on the side and threw them in after the noodles to make it a meal. If it’s a little too savory, throw in some brown sugar to taste. Delicious!

BIG flavor for such a SIMPLE  recipe! I paired it with Crispy & Tender Baked Chicken Thighs and a California Chardonnay for a perfect weekday dinner.
