This recipe was great, I didn't tell my husband what kind of pie it was and had him guess, he thought it was banana! I added a couple dashes of ground cloves and a dash of ground nutmeg, and followed the suggestion to use cornstarch to thicken the filling-(Dissolve the cornstarch in small amount of water then add to filling while on stove)My cantaloupe was very ripe(had dents on the skin) so I suggest you use a little less sugar if your's is also and less sugar on the merengue as well. Let the filling thicken on stove considerably before you place in the baked pie crust. After the pie cooled I refridgerated it then served it chilled.

This is best when the cantaloupe is a little too ripe.  A friend of mine calls it Rotten Pie because I told him that I use cantaloupes that are too ripe to slice and would normally be thrown away!  It's also good without the meringue since it's so sweet.  I've done it both ways.

This was the first pie that I have ever made.  I was looking for something different, and this was great!  It sounds a little odd to use cantaloupe in a pie like this, but everyone loved it and begged for the recipe!

My husband just had some dental work done so I just made the filling.  This is a really great pudding!!  I didn't have butter extract so I used vanilla instead.  It turned out fantastic.  This would be a great way to get young children who think they don't like cantaloupe to try it.  I think it would change their mind.

My Mother in Law was making this 50+ years ago without the pie crust. She couldn't remember the recipe so I found it here. This is the most Awesome Pie Ever. I do leave out the butter extract, but only because I didn't have any. And I don't use a pie crust. This is as close to hers as I have found. Be sure to use a great tasting Ripe cantaloupe. Just Awesome!!!

I would give it 4.5 if I could. I omitted the sugar because I used a sweet melon and used 1 tsp cornstarch to add to thickness. I also used 2 tsp amaretto instead of butter extract. It is good. I agree with Marie C. that I will happily make it again if I have extra melon, but won't go out of my way to buy melon to make it.

This was good but it is very unusual. It would not be my first choice of pies to make but if I had extra melon I would make it again.

I am giving this one four stars because it did not set up well at all!  Soupy!  Fortunately, my family is not very picky and was willing to try it.  Tasted great.

Very good.  I would do as another user suggested and use as ripe a cantaloupe as possible.  I made some alterations in order to make it slightly healthier.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and used Splenda in the filling (not the meringue) to cut down the sugar.  I used just slightly over 1/4 cup of Splenda and it was fine.  In addition, I used vanilla instead of butter flavoring and that worked well.  Last, I used a graham cracker crust.

The pie works okay, I just really didn't like it.  I don't think cantaloupe lends itself well to this use.  The pie will get eaten, but I won't make it again.

I didn't make the meringue, we had meringue nests left over from another dessert so we used those instead and as such I can't comment on the meringue part of this recipe.
The rockmelon pie was new for us, in fact on telling the grocer what we were going to do with the rockmelon he gave us, he thought we were mistaken and suggested we needed lemons not rockmelons. 
I'm not sure which culture to credit with this pie but it was delicious. The recipe made two smaller pies (coles brand sweet pastry pie bases).
Being a family who often has to make two desserts on special occasions due to a dairy allergy this pie was fantastic. The pie base we used was dairy free and this recipe was very easy to make dairy free.
Thank you for a lovely pie.

This is really labor intensive but worth it. If your cantaloupe isn’t super ripe, you need to up the sugar. I didn’t use the butter extract but added a splash of vanilla because that’s what I had. It doesn’t taste anything like cantaloupe - which I love - but it is delicious!

Fantastic recipe, this was the first time I've made merengue and this recipe worked very well. I didn't brown mine as much as the picture shows, I like it whiter and the next time I will double the merengue recipe to mound it up even more.

Well I tried. Got it nice and thick and surprisingly creamy, but when I tasted it, I couldn't make myself pour it into the pie shells.  It just tasted wrong.  Maybe cinnamon and cloves would have saved it.
