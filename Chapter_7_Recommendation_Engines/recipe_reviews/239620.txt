This loaf was excellent! I was skeptical because of the almond flour (which I love) but the rise, crumb and texture were very good. Wonderful aroma  while it was cooking! (I should add that I used coconut oil, rather than almond oil.) My husband even commented on the aroma.  Great loaf of bread with all the extra goodness and health benefits of almond flour and whole wheat. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my second time making this bread. This time I substitute the water with skim milk. It tastes much better.

I did not use the Xanthan Gum. Could not find it in any of the stores.

Excellent bread!  I made it exactly as written in my bread machine.  Ingredients are expensive but worth it if you plan to make it several times which I have.  My husband loved it also and I plan to make one for my neighbor who tried it.

It was easy, and with the bread machine, I didn't have to heat up the kitchen. The bread is tasty and moist. My family liked it.

Great recipe and made beautifully in the bread machine.  couldn't find almond oil, but just used what I had.  also couldn't find the xanthan gum, and truthfully, I don't know why that is an ingredient.  the bread has great taste and texture - cuts perfectly.

Excellent bread, nice flavor, cuts so nicely you can make a sandwich, or toast, and it didn't fall apart.  PERFECT in every way!  Thanks!!!!  I will use it again!
