this was my first time making taco soup, and I took this as a good base point but I did make a few changes.  I used four cups of chicken broth, 1 can of chicken since I didn't have any ground beef, 1 can of black beans, 1 onion, 1 packet of taco seasoning, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, and a can of diced tomatoes.  I made this soup in the crockpot on high for 3 or 4 hours just so the flavors would meld together.  It was insanely good...i couldn't stop eating it and I can't wait to make it again.  When it was ready I crushed tortilla chips on top and added sour cream and shredded cheese.  5 stars all the way...and beware...it's addicting!!

This a wonderful dish! Give it a try. You'll love it. 

You really don't need a crock pot. Just brown the beef and saute the onion together in a skillet and drain off fat. Then put all ingredients together in a large pot, bring to a boil and let simmer for 20-30 minutes. It's that simple. 

My variation: 1lb groud beef, 1 onion, 2 cans kidney beans (with juice), 2 cans corn (with juice), 2 cans diced tomatoes (with juice), 1 can tomato suace, and 1 package taco seasoning. Put a spoon full of sour cream on each serving and toss fritos on top!  Mmmmm!

This soup is very yummy but I had to change it a little.  The soup was too thick for a soup.  I had to add several cups of water which made me add about half a package more of taco seasoning.  If I had more tomato sauce on hand I would have added a little more of that too.  It turned out very well and will make again.

i recommend using a can of Ro-Tel diced tomatoes- the variety containing cilantro and lime juice.  It makes this great soup awesome!

This recipe is great!  If you are serving someone who doesn't like beans, instead of the cans of kidney beans you can add two cans of chili without beans.  It keeps the body of the soup without the beans! CF

This was okay.. but I wouldn't call it soup. It's more like a chili.. very thick and absolutely no broth.  This would make a good topping for Nachos.. just melt some cheest on top and spread it over chips. I wouldn't suggest it for dinner.

I tried this recipe for two children that like tacos but not any new recipes.  Just the traditional tacos and they just loved it and asked if I could make it again the following day.  Excellent!!!

Easy!  I added a can of Ro-Tel with chiles and a cup of water.  Yes is was a little thick but I like that and you can always add water to thin it out.  Would use this very soon again.

I had to add a 20oz can of petitie diced tomatos to make this dish an actual soup. But OH MY GOODNESS it's the best stuff around! Family favorite dinner by far. Make it all the time and I have yet to find someone who doesn't like it. GREAT to pack along for a camping trip.

Hubby loved it. Like others have said, it was quite thick.  I added a total of 24oz of tomato sauce, plus a cup of chicken broth.  I think next time, because hubby is not the worlds biggest tomato fan,  I'll do just the 15oz of tomato sauce and 3 to 4 cups of broth and experiment from there.

This was so tasty and and easy. I substituted one can of black beans (drained/rinsed) for one of the kidney beans. I didn't drain any of the other canned things. However, I found it to be too thick, so I added one can of diced tomatoes (undrained), and after reading some similar taco soup recipes, I threw in one package of dry ranch dressing. Then it was absolutely perfect! If you prefer the thicker, chili-like version, follow the recipe exactly. If you're looking for a soupier texture, add tomatoes and some more seasonings. Good leftover - my husband and I ate it for a week and it was still really good, if not better, than when we first made it.  A dollop of sour cream really brings out the flavors - don't skip it!

This was great!  My husband and I both loved it!  I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and some fresh cilantro. I didn't have taco seasoning, so I used my own spices.  It was fantastic!  I'm making it tomorrow for my daughter's birthday party!---I did make it for her party and everyone RAVED about this.  Several people took home the recipe too, and they are still talking about it-a year later!!  What a hit!

My families FAVORITE mexican dish.  Its great.  I too added extra sauce, put it on top of corn chips, added sour cream chease, picante sauce and it was perfect.  I agree its not a soup.  Its more of a topping for nachos.  VERY easy to make.

This was a tasty recipe. I modified it just a little bit to suit our tastes. I left out the onion, exchanged the kidney beans for pinto beans, added an extra 8 oz of tomato sauce and sprinkled in some extra cumin, garlic powder and cayenne powder. I served this with mexican cornbread on the side. Thanks for a yummy new recipe to add to my dinner rotation!

I wouldn't call this a soup (it's more like chili), but I would call it good.  I did a half recipe because I had half a pound of taco meat leftover.  I used 15 oz tomato sauce and a cup of thin salsa and it was still thick.  I added extra liquid because I started the crock pot at 8:40 this morning and we ate at noon.  Family pleaser!

This was very good, the family really liked it. It was , however, very thick as written. I added an extra small can of tomato sauce and and a cup of water, which diluted the seasoning. To correct this I added another half pack of taco seasoning, a teaspoon of cumin and some garlic powder. I wanted a more tomato flavor, so I added a can diced tomatos with green chilis. This really seemed to make it stand out more. Very good all round with modifications, which I'm not a big fan of "rewriting" a recipie then reviewing, but I don't think this strayed too far from the original.

Very nice! Even super picky husband liked it. Only used 1 can of beans and added a little broth. Everyone at work came smiffing around the cubicle when I brought in leftovers. I will make this again!

I added some water to this- and it was still too thick to be a soup.  However, I added some chips, and sour cream, and the kids loved "nachos" for dinner!

Love love love this recipe. I use a can of Nalley's vegetarian chili beans with meat in them. It is so fast and easy and my kids love it. If I'm in a hurry I just toss it all in a pan and heat it on the stove.

i thought this was a great change of pace from a hearty cold weather chili. i buy bags of dried beans, soak them overnight, and cook them on high 8 hrs in my slow cooker. then i freeze them in portions to cook with.it saves me a lot of money and this was a great recipe to use some of them up. i also made my own oven baked tortilla strips the day before and kept them in a sealed tupperware(healthier and cheaper). i look forward to making this more as i enjoy eating lighter soups in the summer

I need to say this soup is very forgiving and can be modified a hundred ways.  The only thing I did different was used my own taco seasoning- cumin,chili powder, coriander..  I used black beans too.  Everyone loved this, I will make this again.

This was really good! I had to use black beans because I was out of kidney beans, but it was still great! Thanks for sharing.

This is aweaome!  I added a can of black beans and a half a bag more of taco seasoning.  So yummy! I liked it with Fritos, cheese and sour cream.  Kind of like a chili with a taco zest!

My family LOVED this recipe! If you want more of a soup texture, then you should definitely add about twice the amount of tomato sauce.  I did, and it still was really thick.  Also, if you're not crazy about beans (like me) just add one can of kidney beans, not two.  I will definitely do that next time, and I will definitely make this again!!!!!

Liked this a lot!  I browned the ground beef with several generous shakes of dried onions and a minced garlic clove.  Added taco seasoning, 1 can corn, 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can diced tomatoes, and1 can Great Northern beans (only kind I had on hand).  Added a cup and a half of beef broth, then brought to a boil then simmered about 25 minutes.  Served over crushed tortilla chips with shredded colby-Jack and a dollop of sour cream on top.  Quick and easy -- will make this often.

My husband liked this; I'm not a huge ground beef fan but the taste was pretty good! I cut the recipe in half but still used the same amount of tomato sauce. I don't like corn in my soup so I left that out. I used pinto beans as well. I made the mistake of adding about 1/4 cup water without adding some more taco seasoning so next time I won't bother with the water at all! Since I used my slow cooker I was afraid of something burning since this was so thick, like a chili, but I don't think that would've been a problem. Served with some crushed tortilla chips & low fat cheddar cheese on top. Thanks for sharing!

I usually have very good experience with recipes on this site, but this was a big flop.  The fact that it wasn't anything like soup didn't bother me, it just tasted like mushy taco meat casserole.  I could tell that the leftovers would not get eaten.  It sat in the fridge for over a week and I just pitched it.

This was a hit with husband & children!  We didn't have kidney beans, so I substitute one can each of garbanzos and black beans.  Hubby suggested we combine this recipe with our stand-by vegetarian chili, because the consistency of this taco soup was more satisfying to him than our runny veggie chili.  So I'm putting the crock pot to use again tonight with a second batch -- this time trying to add the chunks of zucchini that we put in our chili & see whether we like the tastes together!

This was my first time making this soup too. I added 2 cups of water to make it a bit more like soup. Pairing it with cornbread made a great addition. Cornbread on the bottom of the bowl + soup + crushed up chips = yum, yum!

My husband and I loved this recipe! Although i would minus the tomato sauce and add a family size [dont know the ounce size sorry] can of diced tomatos and half a bottle of la victoria mild,medium, or hot sauce (your choice). Personally the mild gave it no flavor. We love spicy food so I made it with hot and it was delicious!

Good basic recipe but like the other reviewers, I think this sucker needs some tweaking to bring it up to 5 stars but that is a great blueprint to customize.  It's too thick. I thinned with mixture of chicken broth and beer. Also, adding canned chopped green chilies, (mild) gives a nice flavor. I use ground turkey which I think is a better flavor. Other garnishes are sliced olives, sour cream and chopped tomatoes, which are also good in the soup.

This is a great recipe, however i did add a can of water, equal to the tomato sauce. Just pour in the tomato sauce then fill can with water and pour in. Instead of using tortilla chips, I bake Jiffy brand cornmeal muffins. Then, just crumble a cornmeal muffin into your bowl of taco soup and top with cheese. YUMMY!

Absolutely yummy, although I will say that this recipe adds up to more of a "chili" than a soup. I added 1/2 can of beef broth & a can diced tomatoes w/jalepenos and it was delicious w/a kick. Now I keep all the ingredients on hand for a easy recipe to throw together. Super yummy!

This was an excellent recipe to add to your dinner rotation.  I did make a few minor changes/additions.  I added a can of Rotel and a bit of extra ground beef and used chili beans instead of kidney beans.  Very good flavor.  This makes a soup that is more of a chili consistency, so it is excellent to serve with tortilla chips, sour cream and cheese on top.

One of the best taco soup recipes that I have come across.  I used lean ground turkey instead of beef cause I like the flavor better and it's more healthy.

This is yummy and my husband gave it an A! I made some variations based on another review and reviews that said the recipe as is is too thick. I did not drain the 2 cans of kidney beans or the can of corn. I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes undrained also. After browning the meat and onions in a pan, I added all ingredients to a stockpot, brought to boil and simmered 30-40 minutes. It turned out great and no need to slow cook for 2 hours if you don't have the time. I served over Tostidos Cantina chips and topped with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and chopped green onion. I would highly recommend the cheese and green onion. Will make again!

I've been making this taco soup recipe for several years now.  It's our favorite.  I add one 15 ounce can of chili tomatoes and one 15 ounce can diced tomatoes to the recipe.

This soup was so delicious! I added 1 1/2 to 2 cups of water because I like it a little soupier. I doubled it and used 2 cans of kidney beans, 1 can of black beans, and 1 can Great Northern beans. I did not double the corn. We put cheese  on it, but did not have tortillas so we didn't eat it with them.

Like DanielleB I also ended up using this as a base.  I used 2 pounds of hamburger, 1 cup of beef broth and 2 cups of water.  I still only used 1 package of taco seasoning.  I also used three cups of corn that I scraped off the cob from the garden.  I am going to pressure can it have it on hand for this winter.

Very good base for taco soup. I always add a can of tomato paste, a can of diced tomatoes , I slice up some olives and use the kidney bean juice in there as well. It comes out more soupy and with great flavor!

This is a good base to start with, but overall kind of bland. I omitted the canned corn because we're not fond of it, but otherwise did everything else it said. All in all, it's a good starting point for additions and what not, but just needs more oomph.

This is fantastic! I am sitting here eating it as I type this.  I made very few changes.  I didn't have kidney beans, so I used black beans.  I used 1 and 1/2 packages of taco seasoning, a can of green chiles, and about a 1/3 of a package of ranch dressing mix. I served it on top of shredded lettuce with sour cream and crushed Doritos on top.  DELICIOUS!! Thanks for the great recipe!!  I have to add that I will probably get seconds of this...and I rarely have a second helping of anything!!

GREAT!  Took this to a church soup supper and it was the first one to go.  Everyone wanted seconds and the recipe.  Have served it twice since and was a hit both times.  I love it because the kids beg for it and it is the only way they will eat beans. Can't wait for Cinco!

Exaclty what I was looking for!  There are so many Taco Soup recipes but I was looking for something really fast and easy.  I used a combo of black beans and kidney beans, added a can of diced tomatoes, and cut up some avocados to top it.  Everything else is as written.  Thanks!

This was a really good recipe.  We had it last night for dinner and everyone loved it, even my pickiest child.  It was a little thick, more like chili than soup.  So maybe next time I will add more tomato sauce or some chicken broth.  Served with chips and lots of cheese!

YUM! This turned out wonderful! We made it while camping. We cooked and cut up everything at our camp site, put it all a large pot, and let it simmer for almost 3-hours while we played horseshoes and stuff. Definitely put the chips on the bottom of the bowl.  Extremely tasty and very good w/ some shredded cheddar on top. Perfect for sitting around a warm camp fire. This is a keeper!

This is a very good recipe, I have made it several times, it's a family favorite! I twick it a little bit by adding Velveeta cheese as it cooks and serve the soup over corn chips and add sour cream on top.

Instead of kidney beans we use ranch style beans and instead of tomato sauce we use a can of rotel. Add a packet of ranch dip mix to this recipe and you'll have a soup that everyone will LOVE! We make this soup all the time...its sooo good, so easy and so cheap!!!

Good Base, but to thin it out use 1 to 2 cans of Beef Broth.  Love the crock pot idea.

This certainly isn't soup! It's a dip and very good but nothing that special as the other reviewers make you believe. Rachael Ray has a fine Mexican dip for chips that I prefer over this. There isn't even any water included here to make a thinner 'soup' appearance. Weird!

My 12 year old took one bite and quickly announced that this is her new favorite meal. But don't expect it to look like soup. It's more of a topping for the tortilla chips.

This recipe is great!  I don't know that I'd call it a soup as much as a stew or chili, but it was very tasty.  I used different beans and didn't bother with the green onions.

My family enjoyed this.  My 16-year old son took one look at it and said "Yuck!" but tried it anyway and ended up have 4 bowls!  It's not at all soupy--it has the consistency of a very thick chili.

MMmmmmm this was good!! I didn't have the tortilla chips, so I just tore up some flour tortillas and added just before eating.  Just delicious, thank you!
