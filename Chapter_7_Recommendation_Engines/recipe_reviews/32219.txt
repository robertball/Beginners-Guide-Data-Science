This is excellent with CHICKEN!  YOU MUST ADD 1/2 to 1 CUP OF FRESH SQUEEZED LEMON JUICE TO THE MARINADE!!!Everyone loved this, and I even impressed the inlaws who are Greek!  The cucumber sauce, called Satsiki is delicious!  Even my picky teenage son loved this, souvlaki is his favorite!  This was really good served on the grilled pita bread with onions, tomato and sauce.  Will definately make this and serve it this way over and over again.

This was nothing like any lamb I have eaten at any Greek restaurant. I marinated the lamb overnight as stated, and was disappointed with the flavor. I have two tips regarding the cucumber/yogurt sauce, and these are: 1. Spoon the yogurt into a coffe filter, and put it somewhere so that the fluid can drain from the yogurt. This result in a firmer, creamier yogurt. 2. Use English/Hothouse cucumbers instead of the regular waxy cukes. Strip the skin off with a vegetable peeler, and then grate the flesh into the yogurt with a cheesegrater.

i made this for dinner tonight and thought it was missing something...then i saw the comment about adding the lemon juice to the marinade and realized that was what was missing!  i made it w/chicken and it was great (once it threw it all back on the skillet and cooked it again w/lemon juice).  so dont forget to add 1/2 cup of lemon juice!  i used marsala wine too, because it's the only red wine i had in the house.

Tasty souvlaki, Sharon. Better than our fav Greek restaurant. I used pork and have used chicken in the past. This recipe is great with the tzatziki sauce from this site.

This dish was fantastic!  The marinade was womderful...it took an inexpensive cut of lamb and made it so tender!  The skewer went into the meat like a hot knife through butter!  And it melted in my mouth! Absolutely delicious!  I served it on grilled pita, as suggested.  I added shredded lettuce, sliced sweet onion and tomatoes. The yogurt sauce was delicious, too!  These souvlakis were better than those served at our favorite Greek restaurant!  We had greek salad on the side to help make my big, fat Greek dinner a huge success! Thank you, Sharon!

This was so very delicious.  I had guests over, and they couldnâ€™t get enough of it.
I used chicken instead of lamb, and I added the 1/2 cup of lemon juice to the marinade as others said and it was perfect!  Also, on the pita we added lettuce with the onion and tomato.  The yogurt sauce was delicious too, but made WAY too much, I would half the yogurt sauce recipe next time.  If you like Souvlaki, you will LOVE this recipe.

One word:  DELICIOUS

Okay, a few more words.  Really easy to make, and goes great with tzaziki, some onions, and my homemade pita.

Delicious!  I used pork tenderloin instead of lamb.  I also drained the yogurt and squeezed out the excess water from the cucumber.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was amazing. My husband and I absolutely loved it. Only change I made was to use balsamic vinegar instead of wine as we didn't have any. The yoghurt/cucumber sauce tasted just like at our favourite turkish restaurant.

I have tried this marinade with EVERY possible meat and it is fab-u-lous EVRYTIME. I do not add the wine with chicken and recommend skipping it all together. I have also added lemon as per others suggestions an found it was not as good.

I LOVE this recipe! Very simple to make and very flavorful; however, I've always made it with chicken, not lamb (due to cost). Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly. I'd like to try using fresh mint instead of dried. The homemade tzatziki sauce is delicious - tastes very authentic. I have made this again and again - a family favorite. I serve it with Greek style potatoes and the "Greek Salad III" recipe.

Added lemon juice, as per other reviews.  Served with sliced kalamatas, pita bread, crumbled feta, sliced tomatoes and red onions.  YUM.

I marinated chicken breasts that were cut into pieces that were a little larger than bite size.  Used fresh mint for marinade.  Did not use skewers...just put the marintated chicken on a grilling tray on the barbeque.  Sprinkled a little dried mintleaves as chicken was cooking.  Used 1 and 1/2 cups of plain yogurt for the sauce, reduced the garlic using one teaspoon of minced garlic in oil and used 1/2 cucumber.  Served as suggested with pita bread and a Greek salad.  Yummy meal...will make again...Thanks Sharon!

I made this with a pork loin.  It was really good.  The whole family loved it.  We did use red wine vinegar instead of red wine and it was great.  We did cheat an buy store made tzatziki.

This was a huge hit; and the leftovers warmed up very well.  I only made a 1/4 batch of the sauce and still had too much.

Made the meat part of this dish with eye of round instead of lamb, because my kids won't eat lamb. It was delicious and easy to do. Marinated for about 6 hours and the meat was fairly tender. Also made the tzatziki part of the recipe and it was excellent. I minced the cucumber instead of grating it, as I like that texture better and I hate when the grated cucumber gets all over everything. Thanks!

I used extra marinade to soak thinly sliced onions and tomatoes for about an hour. That, along with tsatziki and feta cheese, added enough flavor to compensate for the lack luster flavor of the marinated chicken. Even adding lemon juice to the marinade did not add up to good Greek-flavored chicken. Don't get me wrong, the dish as a whole was a success, but I was hoping for more flavor from the marinade.

I made this on Saturday and I must say that I definitely loved the cucumber sauce (will make again) but was not impressed with the grilled lamb. I've been in the middle east and this didn't taste like anything I've ever had. It didn;t even taste Greek to me. The only thing I could really taste was the red wine. I too followed others advice and added lemon juice but it still didn't do much for the flavor. I t wa stender but that's about it. Next time I am going to cut the red wine in half; add the lemon juice again; slice up some red onion and add some extra spices (including extra garlic) that are not included on this recipe and then let it marinate overnight.

Sounds great!  If you use waxed cukes - remember to scrape the seed area out with a teaspoon, then grate.  helps with the cost effectivness.

I made this recipe for my husband and a friend, and both loved it! (including myself). I made the marinade the night before, but did not use the red wine in it, and used minced garlic that I had in the fridge, instead of fresh clove. I used diced lamb, and did not put on to skewers, instead I fried in a pan on the stove. It was a little oily due to the oil content in marinade, but I drained it during the cooking process, then cooked a little longer and it turned out beautiful! Next time I will use less oil in the marinade, if cooking on the stove. Yoghurt sauce was yummy, I did not use the dill weed in it. The recipe made heaps of sauce, more than required, so next time I will use 1 cup of yoghurt and 1/4 cucumber, to make for 4 people. What a great mid-week meal for those short on time, especially for hot days, as there is minimal time spent cooking. I served it wrapped in pita bread with the salad, tasted better than any you could buy from a souvlaki shop!! Highly recommend.

Wonderful! You can easly exchange the red wine for red wine vinegar, it's not as tart as you think.

I made this for my husband and he loved it.  He said it is the best lamb dish he has ever had, even at any restaraunt. For the marinade, I used burgundy instead of red wine and didn't use the black pepper.  I marinated it overnight.  For the yogurt sauce, I halved the recipe (and there was still plenty), used an English cucumber and 1 garlic clove (since my husband has bad acid reflux). I didn't add the salt and pepper either.  Instead of using pita bread rounds, we made the "Naan" bread recipe off of this site.  My husband LOVED the taste combination of the lamb, dipped in the yogurt sauce, and eaten with the Naan bread.

Lovely recipe. The lamb looked amazing after being left over night to marinate. I made it exactly as per the recipe and it was just lovely. My boyfriend loved it.

The meal was very good with the meat tender and flavoursome. I added the lemon juice as recommended. I found the red wine flavour quite strong and made it taste different to the souvlaki flavour I expected.

I haven't tried this w/ lamb, but it is wonderful w/ chicken. I've made it multiple times & have successfully substituted white wine in the marinade when it was all I had on hand. Out of personal preference, I reduce the garlic in the tzatziki sauce.

Great recipe!  My family requests this recipe often.  Suggest draining  the yogurt in cheesecloth overnight to make the sauce more creamy.

Recipe was "pretty good"...not "bad", but prefer another recipe.  I have been cooking many years, but don't comment/post much.Had to comment on this because Never, Ever had Souvlaki without FETA CHEESE. Only read a handful of comments, but was surprised no one else said the same. This recipe also seemed like a combined recipe for Gyros/Souvlaki.I am making Souvlaki for dinner tonite, but will DEFINITELY stick to my own recipe.  Try to find time to post later and hope others enjoy. mangiare, mangiare! (pronounced Mon-ja)

Rating for the sauce 4.5 stars... rating for the meat 3 stars. The wine flavor was dominant and I didn't like it. No raves from the family. We love gyros and this wasn't the flavor we were expecting. I had to use pork tenderloin as lamb was unavailable. I cut the sauce recipe in half and I could have halved it again as it made a lot! Not bad, just not what we were looking for.

Very unique taste.  I really enjoyed this.  I wasn't able to find lamb at my local grocery store, so I did substitute pork tenderloin for the lamb.  The mint helped give the pork a lamb taste (as I usually associate the two.)  Thanks.  One last note, this makes A LOT of cucumber sauce, next time I will cut the recipe for the sauce in half.

This was pretty tasty.  It was the first time I've used lamb, and it wasn't bad at all.  I'm not sure if you can purchase de-boned cuts of lamb but I would suggest it to make it easier to cut into cubes.  The yogurt sauce that you make is pretty good but I was hoping for something a little closer to tzatziki.  Overall this is a fairly quick and easy meal to prepare - you can do much of the prep way ahead of time if you needed to.

I used pork tenderloin instead of lamb and marinated it overnight.  Served it on a plate (skipped the sauce and pita) with orzo, asparagus, and roasted red peppers.  My greek boyfriend loved it, (and said thanks for the delicious dinner!).

The first time I made this recipe, I added just a little lemon juice to the marinade as recommended by other reviewers, but it was too much acid.  Second time I followed the recipe more precisely and thought it was better. The cucumber yogurt sauce is quite good and compares favourably to other tzatziki sauces.

The marinade had a great flavor, but I wasn't completely happy with how the meat turned out - a little tough.  10 minutes on the grill may have been a bit too long.  Of course, I don't cook with lamb much, so I probably should have done a bit more homework on how to handle the meat before tackling this recipe!

I loved the red wine marinade, although it might have been a bit too strong for my anglo-saxon parents. (But make sure to use lamb that's not too gamy or else even the marinade won't help.)EVERYONE loved the yogurt sauce, but the recipe as is makes far too much. Even after spending some time in Greece I couldn't tell you how authentic this souvlaki is, but it is delicious!

Broiled the meat in the oven for 10 minutes since I don't have a grill, and it came out SO GOOD!  The cucumber yogurt sauce tasted very authentic, I love dill!  Made some flavored long grain and wild rice as a side dish.  Follow the recipe, you'll be happy.  I used "beef chunks for kabobs" from the supermarket - and didn't add anything extra.  It's a keeper!

Apparently, this recipe was not like the souvlaki my husband had in Melbourne.  4 cups of yogurt makes a TON of sauce - - 1/4 of that would be sufficient.  The lamb was very good with the marinade and the yogurt sauce complemented the lamb well.  (Our lamb was a bit tough - - no fault of this recipe, of course.)  We enjoyed the sandwiches, just not sure if I would make them again.

Absolutely wonderful! Used pork instead of lamb and broiled. Added 1/2 cup of lemon juice to marinade and made only 1/2 the recipe for the sauce (bought greek yogurt instead of regular plain not sure if it made a difference or not). It was soooooo delicious.

As good as the "Man with the Cart on the Street" in NYC!  And they make great soulvaki!  I added the lemon juice as others suggested and served it over shredded lettuce with sliced tomatos, cucumbers and the red onion.  I also put out hot sauce with the cucumber sauce since that is what is offered on the "Street".  This is a keeper!
