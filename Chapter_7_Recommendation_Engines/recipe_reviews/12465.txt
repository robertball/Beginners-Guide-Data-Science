this pie doesn't have the sweetness I associate with tarte au sucre. In addition it needed to cook for almost an hour longer than this recipe says before it was set. When it had cooled, it was like a thick syrop inside a pie crust. Not the right consistancy and was sticky almost to the point of taffy.

Not the right consistency in the filling, and it is very loose and watery after following cook time directions.
I am baking for an additional 10-15 minutes to see what happens:)
