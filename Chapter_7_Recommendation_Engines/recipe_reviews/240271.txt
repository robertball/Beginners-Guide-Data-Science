I’m sorry but this came out really bad. I don’t think the measurements for the ingredients are correct. It bubbled up in the middle & looked really good at first, but it was extremely flat & burned on the bottom. I followed the recipe to the letter so I know I did nothing wrong. I’ve made several Dutch babies in the past few weeks that have never failed, so I am going to stick with the one that works for me.

Nowhere near as good as the other dutch baby recipe I use. I had applesauce I needed to use up so I decided to try this one.

I was trusting the recipe as written, but it's definitely wrong. This recipe has you not cooking the streusel topping. It literally says "serve immediately" after putting the topping on, adding a foul raw flour taste to the final recipe. And with the mixing as written, my pancake came out extremely dense, and not sweet enough. 

Never making this version again.

I had to rate this because it seems an undiscovered allrecipies treasure. :)  We really enjoyed this one, its nice to give dutch babies a little more pizazz. I didn't add the butter at the end, but did add the strudel the last five minutes of baking.

Had some applesauce that we needed to use up and found this recipe. It turned out so good that we now by applesauce to make this every weekend! The only thing we have modified is not adding powdered sugar (doesn't need it, it is already plenty sweet), sometimes we add fruit on top like sliced apples or peaches, and we make the streusel drier by adding more flour so it is more crumb-like and we bake it with the streusel for the last 5 mins or so.
