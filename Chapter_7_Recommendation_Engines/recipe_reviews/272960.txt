Make sure the butter is soft or it won't mix in well. I cook on my days off and this held up very well. Made a very nice addition to my lunch.

I made extra sauce. This recipe is super easy and has great flavor. Maybe next time I will broil the chicken at the end to get the skin extra crispy like in the photo.

But, you should not use a throw away roasting pan.   You can line  your roasting pan with parchment paper for easy cleanup
