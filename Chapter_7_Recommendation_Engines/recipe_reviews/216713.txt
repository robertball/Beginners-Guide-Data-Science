What a wonderful recipe and so easy, too! I had a few more pieces of chicken than the recipe called for, but there was still plenty of sauce without doubling it. As long as they all fit into a 9x13 dish, you'll have enough. Instead of buying fresh rosemary, I used the dried variation from my spice cabinet. I used the same amount and it worked perfectly. I was a bit nervous that the pan drippings wouldn't be enough, but I just kept lightly scraping the garlic/rosemary mixture as I browned the chicken. I was also concerned over the strong wine aroma, but it came together and was totally delicious. Don't be afraid to use the whole cup. One thing I will suggest is to just mix the cream cheese, soup and wine right into the same pan with the drippings instead of using an extra bowl. Not only does this cut back on dishes, but it is so much easier to blend the cream cheese to a smooth consistency over low heat. I almost forgot, but I used Neufchatel insted of the cream cheese because it has less fat. The only brand that I will use is Publix, though. It tastes identical to cream cheese whereas Walmart's variation tastes like wallpaper paste would probably taste like. As the submitter has said, you will need to add some color to the plate with sides. I hope this has helped alleviate possible concerns. By all means this recipe is a keeper. Easy, delicious and suitable for company! Thank you so much for submitting this gem.

Very good and easy recipe.  Instead of the minced garlic, I seasoned the chicken with pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  Definitely in the make again category!

I made this last night and it was delicious and so easy. I used boneless chicken thighs (this is what I had defrosted) and the neufchatel cheese for a bit less fat/calories. Since the lighter cream cheese is softer I didn't add the wine. It turned out wonderful. Since I make most things from scratch, I made my own cream soup from a dry mix that I make. I don't think you can mess up this simple recipe. The rosemary adds something special. This would be great for company.

Very tasty.  The only thing I would say is that it says to cook the garlic in hot oil, and I would say make sure you turn down the heat, because I burned my garlic the first time round.  I also like the comment Mary (posted 3/26 - Thanks Mary!) made about mixing the wine, soup and cream cheese in the pan.  I agree, much easier that way.  I will be making this again, it was simple.  The part that took me the longest was chopping the rosemary.  There has to be an easier way than how I did it!  :-)

This was an ok recipe.  I would say this is an upscale Mushroom Soup and Chicken recipe.  I liked it, and the chicken was tender, but I don't know that I would make it for company.  Sorry.

This was surprisingly good for how simple it was to make. It's something I'd add to my arsenal for quick family dinners, but with several modifications. Instead of cooking minced garlic in the oil before adding the chicken, which is guaranteed to burn it, I would roughly chop it and cook it over low-ish heat to flavor the oil. Then remove the garlic and add the chicken - re-add the sauteed garlic to the sauce after removing the chicken. My chicken came out pretty tough, I think that instead of basically cooking the chicken breasts through in the skillet, then for another 45 minutes (!), they should be just briefly browned in the skillet on one side, then place them in the pan brown side up, and bake for just 20 minutes. Also I would cover the pan while baking, that will keep the sauce from crusting on top. The look of the sauce crusted on top was really, really unappetizing. But if it stayed just like a cream sauce, it would be good. I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning as well as salt and pepper and I thought it was a good addition.

I made this dish tonight for the family. Not bad at all. I used 1/2 cup of white wine along with 1/2 cup chicken stock to richen the sauce. I then used  the same pan the chicken was brown in and added the wine/stock mixture to gather the lovely browning the chicken left behind, added mascarpone instead of cream cheese with the cream of mushroom. placed it in the oven. We'll see the outcome once the real critics try it out...Thank you for sharing

Yummy!   I did not use wine though.  I marinated the chicken breasts in white wine vinegar, olive oil, and garlic for a couple hours, then tenderized the chicken (with my can of soup).  Then I used a splash of the WW Vinegar and beef broth (didn't have chicken) in place of the wine in the sauce. I served it over brown rice but I think it would be better over noodles.

I've made this recipe numerous times and have always loved it. However, tonight when I went to make it, I realized I had no rosemary or white wine. So I substituted McCormick's Italian Herb Seasoning (adding a little extra) and milk instead of wine. It was still amazing. Gave it a completely different flavor but still loved.

I always use the low or no fat versions of things like cream cheese, etc. and it was all still good :-)

I have made this chicken over & over again. It's delicious. I usually don't have white wine on hand, so I omit that and it's not missed. Everyone who tries it, loves it!

This was fantastic!  I made it with thighs instead of breasts.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  Everyone loved it!  I am definite making this again!
