This was one of the best sangria recipes I've tried.  I omitted the rum, but the apple schnapps added a nice flavor.  Thanks!

I have tried 9 of the Sangria Recipes on this site, but this is the BEST of them all.  Thank you.  I first had sangrai in Spain 11 years ago and loved it.  Since then have tried to re-create that recipe and this not only reminds me of Spain, but it's a better recipe.  Thank you again.

This is a very good recipe as it stands for a quick Sangria.  On warm days when I know we will be outdoors I add some club soda and serve over ice.

This was fabulous! I would leave out grapes next time, and add a orange & raspberries. Oh and trust me, you need to make at least a double batch.

Fantastic! I used vodka instead of rum and it was wonderful. If you leave it overnight the strawberries will lose their color, but they still taste great. Of course, you can always drink it immediately!

Oh, this is tasty stuff!  Really delicious and yep, it's potent.  How great for parties, this comes together in a snap.  I made mine this morning and let it chill up in the fridge for 8 hours so you can really taste the fruit.  Fun & festive & highly recommended!  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

Can't say this was my favorite.  I can't really put my finger on it, but it just didn't impress me like I thought it would.

Made enough for 20-30 people, added sugar and a little more red wine than suggested and left overnight to soak into the fruit....it was gone in an hour.  Haters of wine/sangria were sucking it down.
