This recipe is pretty good but being me I had to jazz it up a little, I added CinnaRaisins (from Dole) and Hersheys Cinnamon Chips. The dough was very much like a quick bread batter, very soupy so I added 3 cups of Oatmeal to make this recipe just a bit more healthy than the origional and to give it a little more body. I did chill as suggested and the cookies came out wonderful very cake like and chewy.

This recipe was unique and yummy!  I am sure the recipe would be great as is, though I did make some changes. First, I used butter instead of shortening.  Then I used 1 1/4 cups sugar instead of 2 cups.  I used half whole wheat flour, half white and omitted the walnuts (personal taste).  I also added 1 1/4 cups oatmeal and 1/4 cup wheat germ, just for the sake of trying it.  They turned out great, with a nice cakey texture to them. A day later, the cookies had dried out significantly, so maybe  cook less than usual so they remain moist (?)

Not my favorite.  I'm used to dough thickening up in the fridge; not this dough.  It looked and seemed like cake dough, not cookie dough.  The cookies spread, but not as much as I thought they would considering the consistency of the dough.  They definitely end up a cake like cookie.  I didn't think I'd like these that much because of the coffee flavor (it's sort of an aftertaste int hese) but I figured bf would.  He said they were okay.  Not really something I'd make again, but I'm glad I could try.  Thanks for the recipe.

I tweeked the recipe a bit and my fiance loved them! I used softened butter instead of shortening, and instead of cloves I use a half and half mix of apple-pie spice and cayenne pepper! The mix of spicy & coffee was awesome! Very soft chewy cookie, great for the cold holidays!

This recipe is very similar to my great-grandmother’s recipe (which I can’t find) except for the coffee - which is okay but I think I will leave it out next time. I substituted craisins and cashews for the raisins and walnut. The cookies turned out pretty good but I think I will go “back to basics” next time.

The only substitution I made was dates for raisins. I will make this again. ????
