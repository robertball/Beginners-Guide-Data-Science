Xtreme Flavor! We loved this, Meagan. So refreshing and wonderful taste. This will be placed on file in the favorites section for those very hot days on the patio. Since we love raspberries, I may halve the strawberries and double the raspberries. Otherwise Yummy!

Wow, is this good! I'm trying new ways to get my kids to eat fruit and this smoothie will defintely help. I had to modify by using 3/4 cup ready to drink lime-ade and added 1 1/2 tablespoons of lime juice. I also added a tablespoon of sugar.  It tastes like a slushy, only better!(only drawback is the seeds) Of course, you should be using frozen berries when you make this.

I suppose it depends on what you're looking for.  Today I was looking for a breakfast smoothie, so I added crushed ice to the blender until I reached the perfect consistency.  I wouldn't think that two Tbsp of frozen limeade concentrate would be enough to give you any frozen texture, so I substituted fresh lime juice.  I would think you'd end up with a glass of tasty juice without the ice, and that may be OK for some...just depends on what you're looking for.  The fresh pineapple was a good addition, and I most likely would add more raspberries and fewer strawberries if I made this again, but that's just a taste preference.  You'll never go wrong with this combination of fruit.
