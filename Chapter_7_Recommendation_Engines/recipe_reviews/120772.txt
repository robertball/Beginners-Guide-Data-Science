Oh my goodness! These are SO delicious! I doubled the recipe...made one batch exactly as the recipe was written, and made the other batch in a rectangle cake pan with no nuts. Both were amazing! Just remember to leave yourself time to let the frozen bread dough thaw. I just set mine in the fridge over night and made the rolls in the morning. Couldn't have been easier. Great recipe. I highly recommend it. Thanks!

i have made this for years.  i pour on the cream before they rise and i usually make these before going to bed. just leave on the counter and bake when you wake up.  the rolls stay soft for days if they last that long.

Oh my goodness, these are out of this world!!!! I could not find frozed bread dough so I just used the french bread in the refrigerator section and it turned out so amazing...these are actually more like sticky buns. Whatever you do, make sure to use the heavy cream before you bake instead of making your own icing because the cream is what makes these special. They are like something in a restaurant or bakery, just delicious!

I LOVE caramel rolls and was delighted to find this recipe. I had an exxtra loaf of bread dough that I was going to through out, but thought I'd try to find a recipe for it. I read through the ingredients and unfortunately, I didn't have cream. So I made this recipe with 1% milk and it STILL turned out great. Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely make this again!

These have been a family favorite for over 10 years!  They are soooo simple and soooo delicious.  Bar far better than the other recipes requiring you to make the dough yourself.  I put the frozen bread dough into greased loaf pans and cover with plastic wrap before I go to bed and in the morning whip them up in no time.  I cut mine into 12 and put 6 in each pan, I also tend to use a bit more whipping cream and it makes them all that much goooier!  YUM

This is a terrific, easy recipe for someone like me who is a little gun shy about making dough from scratch.  I made these last night and they were delicious.  One note--I took them out of the oven after almost 30 minutes b/c the tops were getting pretty brown, but you could still see a little of the cream in the bottom of the pan.  I was afraid they might be a little underdone toward the bottom, but they were just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome for moms on the go!  Nobody would even guess that these are made with frozen bread dough.  I have made these several times now, and they never disappoint.  I even tried some without the cinnamon to make caramel sticky buns.  Again, awesome!  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe - I have already got others hooked on the recipe!

These were yummy tasting.  I added 1/3C of cream to each pan as suggested by some of the other reviews...  Next time I will be adding a LOT more butter and brown sugar and maybe even more cream per batch.  They weren't ooey gooey enough for me! but the taste was amazing!!!

i made these healthier and they came out good!  i used trader joe's whole wheat dough, pam spray in stead of butter, i added blackberry jam, and almond milk instead of whipping cream.  even with all these changes, it came out delicious.  it was so easy.  i'm definitely making these again the next time i have guests!

My boys (6 and 3) loved these, as did I.  The pan on the lower oven rack had more of a toffee/caramel taste and the ones on the upper rack had more like a creamy frosting.. both were delicious.

Delicious!  This was my first attempt at making cinnamon rolls and they turned out wonderfully.  I made them the night before, stuck them in the fridge and then let them rise in the morning.  they were perfect.  My husband ate 10 of them!

Ionly got 10 out of my one loaf of frozen bread dough - but it all worked out just fine!  I love these! I did go with the 2/3 cup of whipping cream...they made them so moist with no hard edges!

Five stars for the concept of baking with cream over the top in place of frosting, which resulted in a less-sweet version of this family pleaser. After reading reviews, I upped the amount of cream to 1/3 cup according to consensus, and the cream thickened as it cooled to make a nice sauce that I spooned over before serving. Since discovering this recipe, I've borrowed the technique when making with my own sweets roll dough, and the cream topping worked equally well. But the frozen bread dough works respectably in a pinch. Either way, you can't go wrong.

These were amazing! I left out the nuts (husband does not enjoy them in recipes) but I imagine pecans would be good too. Next time I will thaw the dough earlier, and assemble them in the evening so we can put them in the oven first thing in the morning!

These were absolutely delicious and a snap to make. My little brother and I made this as-is for a Mother's Day brunch. We ended up doubling the recipe and making one loaf with walnuts and making one loaf plain. They were both VERY good. I'm not sure how they'll reheat but I'm looking forward to having leftovers later in the week... that is, if I can get there in time. All in all, I would definitely call this recipe a keeper.

These were just ok for us-they were good, but not anything special. We prefer regular type cinnamon rolls w/icing-these were gooey, sticky bun type rolls. Definately need more cinnamon too.

These are so easy and so delicious!  I have tried making cinnamon rolls so many times, but they never come out gooey enough.  The end up tasting like a regular roll with some cinnamon and frosting.  But these are wonderful!  They are moist and flavorful.  I think the cream is the secret!  I made them EXACTLY as described, except without the walnuts.  Perfect!!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Made this last year for Christmas morning. They were delicious! Didn't use the cream though. Still came out good. I also used raisins instead of walnuts as nuts dont go over to well with some folks in my family. Used a simple confectioners sugar icing for the topping for the yummy gooey factor. Sent half the batch to my in-laws next door and my FNL loved them so much that he wants them every year for his birthday! Made another batch to take to my husbands family Xmas gathering later the same day. They were gone in a matter of minutes. Yay!!! The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 star, was that the dough was hard to roll out after it defrosted in the fridge. It didnt want roll easily. Had to force it to stretch. But either way it was soooooo good! I definitly will be making these again this Xmas!

These were really good! Made exactly as written, then added a simple powdered sugar/milk glaze. These were still good later at room temperature. Great recipe!

Yum! I added more than a 1/2 a cup of the cream. I added a more about 10 min before i pulled them out. I also doubled the filling, except for the nuts. I loved them. Gooey and Yummy.

My kids cannot get enough of these cinnamon rolls.  They beg me to make them.  Love this recipe and it's so easy.  I did increase the cream and cinnamon but those are the only changes that I made.

First time I made them I loved them and so did my family.  This is a great recipe in a pinch.  I made them a second time and forgot the whipping cream, and it makes a big difference.  I made them a third time and they were so..so.  I am going to make some from scratch and compare.

Made as directed using Rhodes frozen sweet dough.  I will admit to making a frosting for them but I ate a couple before I did that and they are perfect even without the frosting.  (I added it for my sweet tooth husband.)  This is my new go to recipe for cinnamon rolls.  Thank you so much!

These were fantastic!! So simple. I will still on occasion make the dough from scratch but this is going to be my new go to cinnamon roll recipe.

Yummo!  These are wonderful and very easy to make.  I also added a powdered sugar glaze while warm.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

They were a hit with my boys! I did make some light vanilla icing and poured over them when they came out of the oven.
