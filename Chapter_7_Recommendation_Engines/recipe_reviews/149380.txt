This was a very tasty, and easy recipe to make, with just a few modifications! I used a glass 9x13 baking dish, rather than the foil packs, and used 1 1/2 tbsp. of olive oil to grease the baking dish. I used Foster Farms boneless skinless chicken breast fillets with the fat/blood/gristle cut off. I sprinkled the raw chicken with garlic salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes on both sides. (we like our food spicy!) I mixed the stuffing with 1 1/2 cups HOT water, then spread it over the olive oil greased baking dish. Layered the seasoned chicken breast, fresh chopped broccoli florets, Kraft mexican taco cheese, Oscar Mayer real bacon bits, and drizzled with Hidden Valley ranch dressing. Baked in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes, then removed foil, added a little more cheese and baked uncovered for another 6 minute. It was delicious! Stuffing was soft, but not too soggy. If you prefer your stuffing crunchy, I would recommend following the recipes on the stuffing box and placing the stuffing ON TOP of the chicken instead of below. We'll be enjoying the leftovers tomorrow! :D

We loved this recipe!!! I marinated for a few hours in Kraft's zesty Italian dressing first, then I crisped up my own bacon. I crumbled 1 strip on top of the stuffing and broccoli, and the next strip was crumbled over the salad dressing and cheese. I used 2 boxes of Stove top, since I was feeding 6, and because I didn't have the chicken flavour, I just used what I did have...1 box of turkey, and 1 box of pork...still tasted fabulous! I did only use 1 1/2 cups of water for the 2 boxes of stuffing, and still found it was a little to watery, but it didn't affect the taste. I do love the broccoli stems too, so I peeled some stems and added them with the crowns. I only realized when it was time to put the dressing on the chicken that I only had enough rach to cover 2 breasts, so I used caeser dressing for the other 4... which was also very yummy, courtesy of my son giving up a bite due solely for the purpose of this review...;D...lol. My chicken breasts were bone-in and a little bit on the thicker side, so I baked them for about 45 minutes, which was just perfect! Maybe next time I will use boneless breasts and pound them to about 1/2" and roll the stuffing and broccoli in them and still cover them in the dressing and cheese...hmmm...

This is really great!  Super easy and tastes like home.  Now that this has become a staple, no need to measure ingredients.  MAKE SURE TO SPRAY THE FOIL. Don't change a thing!

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I love the fact that it only takes minutes to prepare and it was really very tasty.  I took another reviewer's advice and cut my chicken into strips, and the cook time was right on.  I will definitely make this again, so thanks Kraft! Edited - made this again and replaced the Ranch dressing with a can of cream of broccoli mixed with milk and it was even better!

This is so yummy!!!  Cooking spray is a must.  If you put the bacon bits on the stuffing instead of on top then they act more as an accent and don't overwhelm the chicken.  Cooking time definately depends on where in the oven you put it.  I cooked on both racks and the bottom one took longer.  I like cold leftovers and these were so good.

I made this in a 9/13 glass baking dish and covered it with tin foil to bake.  I baked it at 400 degrees for one hour. In addition to the broccoli, I also added baby carrots and cauliflower.  I sprinkled garlic salt on the chicken and veggies before adding the cheese and ranch dressing-it added a good flavor.

We had this tonight for dinner, everyone liked it, I ommited the broccoli and just made a side of "cheddar green beans" another recipe from this site. That was sooo good and complimented this dish very well. I used another reviewers advice and baked in a 9x13 pan, and I the only issue I found was that the stuffing was a little to soggy for my liking, I'll just try not putting as much water next time. I seasoned my chicken with pepper, garlic salt, and onion powder. This was a fun easy dish to make :)

This was okay. It was really salty (I even used the reduced sodium Stove Top), and the broccoli was very overdone. On a positive note, the chicken was super moist and tasty.

Pros: Easy to make. Tastes good. 
Cons: Stuffing got mushy somehow. Maybe less water should be added? 

Be sure to spray foil with cooking spray or use non stick foil so the stuffing doesn't stick. So much easier to get off. 

Also if your chicken is larger than 4 oz each they will need to be cooked longer. Cooked mine for about 45 minutes.

Family loved it!  We liked all the ingrediants, but never thought of combining them.  We used real bacon instead of bacon bits.  Thanks for sharing!

I omitted the stuffing, used Kraft Bacon Ranch, cut the chicken into strips, and baked the dish in a regular cake pan for 45 min. I cooked jasmine rice seperately in chicken broth, then served the chicken over the rice. My husband and all six children liked the meal--a first for our family!

OK/good.  Prepared recipe as indicated, but put everything in foil covered pan to bake. Chicken and broccoli were very tasty, but stuffing was too soggy (plus, we're just not people who love stuffing).  Would make again but will omit stuffing next time and serve over brown rice.

Very tasty and simple recipe. I skipped the stuffing and assembled everything together in a baking dish instead of using the foil. Yummy!

Very tasty! Quick and easy too. You definitely need to use some cooking spray on the foil or the stuffing sticks. I didn't have extra large heavy duty foil so I placed the chicken diagonally on the foil so there was enough room to tent it. Works just as well.

Well, I took the advice from another review and put pam on the foil so it wouldn't stick and that was a great tip! It slid right off! I also cooked it for 45 minutes and it was perfect. My family loved it, there was very little clean up and it was fast and easy! We will be doing this again!

I don't know if it was me or the recipe but my chicken needed to cook about 15 minutes longer than what was called for and the stuffing was really mushy. Overall this is a really tasty recipe, and I am definitely going to try it again, next time without the stuffing. And maybe make my foil packets bigger with more room around the chicken ? That might have been the problem...

Flavor was great, although the stuffing came out a little mushy.  Will either add less water to mixture, or substitute stuffing for something else next time.

This was a disappointment,considering it came from the Hall of Fame Recipe Collection. No one liked this. I will say it was easy clean up.To bad it was mostly thrown away. I won't be making this again.

Excellent meal. Very easy to make. My husband (who is very very picky when it comes to taste. He adds garlic salt to EVERYTHING) liked it very much and didn't even add garlic salt. My 14 month old son liked it as well.  Will definitely make again soon.

This was REALLY easy, REALLY fast, and delicious. It's also yummy frozen and reheated. This will definitely be making another appearance at dinnertime in our home.

this is an excellent recipe. The stuffing stuck to the foil so next time I will use pam to stop that. Would definitely recommend to everyone.
