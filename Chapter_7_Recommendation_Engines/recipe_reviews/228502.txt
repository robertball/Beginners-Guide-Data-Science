I made a chocolate graham cracker crust from scratch I used a name-brand chunky peanut butter and I used reduced fat cream cheese and "light" whipped topping. My boys LOVE this pie......they must it's half gone. My son actually got up this morning and asked for a piece for breakfast! Um no. GREAT pie.

Made this for a dinner party and everyone liked it. It is VERY rich so dish small pieces! I home made a crust then melted milk chocolate chips on top to create a layer of chocolate before adding the PB mixture (I omitted the choc chips from the mixture). Very easy to make!

Excellent. Much better than expected! Photo does no justice sets up pretty. used store bought graham crust melted choc chips on crust as another reviewer suggested. Myself I wouldn't want to bite into a hard chip in such a creamy pie. Thanks for quick easy delicious recipe. Will make again.

This is a great reliable easy recipe. I used a deep dish graham cracker crust and then before serving drizzled a little Hershey s syrup and a squirt of reddi whip-deeeelish!

I have used this recipe multiple times and it is my go to recipe for a quick easy peanut butter pie. I use whatever store bought crust that I have on hand but my very favorite is Deep Dish Pie crust. Because it is so rich using this type of crust really helps to cut down on the richness. If I use an Oreo or Graham Cracker crust then I cut down on my other ingredients to try to curb the richness. Excellent recipe though!
