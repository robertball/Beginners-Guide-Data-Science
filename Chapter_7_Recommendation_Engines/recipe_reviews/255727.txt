Very good! The spice combination is very good. I used chana dal instead of white beans; it's all I had. Thank you for the recipe.

Nice creamy consistency, but the mix of flavors was strange.  The butternut squash and canellini beans were just an unappetizing combination.

I had a feeling this recipe would lack flavor without the inclusion of curry powder. I made the recipe exactly as written and it was ok, just bland. Next time will add some ginger, curry powder, and garam masala. I did like the spice of the cayenne—it’s the perfect amount. I will also include another veggie, I think. Maybe some shredded carrot or frozen peas?

This was delicious! The butternut squash took a lot longer to get soft than the recipe stated. Other than that, it was easy to make and a pleasure to eat.

Yummy!!!   The little kick of cayenne pepper at the end note is spot on!  Will definitely make it again.   Used mustard powder instead I

3/4/19: Very good! I added 1/4 cup of peanuts 5 minutes before it was done cooking to give it a bit of crunch and served it over brown rice. I left the cilantro off of my husband’s, and after tasting it, I added a sprinkle of fresh ground black pepper to mine. Otherwise no changes and we thought it had just the right combination and amounts of spices. It would also be good with some shredded chicken added. 10/9/19: Found myself making this again, but this time I didn't have coconut milk or cannellini beans so made the following changes: I measured 1/2 cup sweetened coconut flakes in a glass liquid measuring cup, then added 2% milk up to the 1 cup mark and substituted that for the coconut milk, I added 1/3 cup Jasmine rice, added right away so it would cook the entire time, I used Great Northern beans and added 1/4 cup peanuts during the last 5 minutes of cooking. I cut the salt in half and added 1/4 tsp of pepper. I did use the olive oil, but I'm thinking it's not really necessary, so next time I will leave that out to cut the calories a little. The stew was still great with these changes. I had about 1.5 cups of the stew left after lunch, and I pureed this with 1/4 cup sour cream and 1 cup 2% milk, then added the corn from 1 large ear of leftover corn on the cob and heated to make a lovely coconut-butternut-curry corn chowder for lunch the next day.

Added a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter and used yellow split peas in place of the beans since that's what I had.  Nice soup

I increased the cayenne and mustard seed a bit because I wanted it a little spicier. It did not disappoint.
