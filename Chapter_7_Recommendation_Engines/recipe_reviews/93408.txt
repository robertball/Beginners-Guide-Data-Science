This was exceptionally delicious! I like pumpkin seeds to be completely crunchy so, I baked them at 275 degrees until they had just a little bit of a golden color to them them. Then I put them in the pan with half butter and extra-virgin olive oil, sugar and waited for them to get even more of a golden color(caramelize). I liked the sweet and salty mix! They were great!

Very tasty!

I roasted the seeds on a foil-lined pan, sprayed with non-stick spray to keep them from sticking.  This made for easy clean-up, and also was an easy way to transfer the seeds to the pan.

I read some of the reviews, and decided to heat the oil and melt the sugar ahead of time, BEFORE adding the seeds.  (I used 1 T. oil, 1 T. margarine, and a drop of water with the 2T. sugar.)  I set this aside as I waited for the seeds to finish toasting, which took 35 minutes at 275 degrees.

I added the toasted seeds to the melted sugar mixture, and tossed them together over medium heat.  Then I added the spice/sugar mixture, removed the pan from the heat, and mixed all until well coated.  (I did not feel that there was a need for a separate bowl; I did all the mixing in one pan.)

I added a bit more cinnamon and used only 4T. sugar overall, instead of the 6T. it calls for.

This is definitely better than the traditional salt-only roasted seeds!

Unfortunately I got so excited to make these I didn't read all of the instructions. I toasted the seeds in the oven with the pumpkin pie spice, sugar, salt & Oil all at once. I think the outcome is the same. But made even the wrong way these are the best pumpkins seeds I have ever had. I have been doing seeds for ten years and I will always make a few batches like this from now on.

These are so good.  However I think it has to much sugar.  I only used 4 TBS and it was way more than enough.  I will make again next year.  Thanks!!

This is such a great recipe for pumpkin seeds. I left my seeds on the counter over night and I still toasted in the oven for 35min. I did double the recipe. I gutted 2 pumpkins which gave me 2 cups of seeds exactly.I just loved the flavor of the pumpkin spice. I made them for a Halloween party that is 2 days away and I hope they last that long!

Thanks Crystal

This was easy and delicous like everyone has said.  I will double the recipe next time because i ate it all in one sitting. 
PS really watch your seeds mine were toasted in about 30 min any longer and they would of been burnt

Yummy!  Instead of baking the seeds and then cooking them in the pan, I just coated and baked the seeds.  I only used 5 T. of sugar.  They were great!

Awesome! I've made pumpkin seeds every year, and every year I ask my self "Why bother?" This year though was the exception. As other suggested, I cut the baking time down to 30 minutes. My seeds weren't even that dry, I just patted them dry with towels after rinsing. I too, cut the sugar down. I only found 2 TB needed to sprinkle on the seeds when in the pan. I had great luck with a cast iron skillet-- it gives you the nice roasted color and taste that non-stick pans can't replicate.
Also, you can make your own pumpkin pie spice by mixing together 1/2tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp cloves or allspice (I like cloves) and 1/8 tsp nutmeg. I like a bit more cinnamon on these so I added a bit more than 1/2 tsp.
Thanks for a great recipe!

I never really cared for pumpkin seeds before this recipe, but I loved these.  After carving out jack-o-lanterns this year my daughter requested that I make some pumpkin seeds for her. So I found this recipe and tried it. I think I ended up eating more of the seeds than she did, and we made a double batch of them again a few days later. I can't wait until next year to do these again!

I melted a tablespoon of non hydrogenated margarine in the microwave. I stirred the spices into the margarine then mixed in the rinsed and dried pumpkin seeds. I baked the seeds at 350F (not 250 as directed), stirring the seeds every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. Once the seeds were out of the oven, I stirred them again and let them cool on the baking sheet. When cool, I placed them into an air tight container. They were good the same day, but I found them even better the second day. I can't wait to make this again next year!

Wonderful flavor!  I doubled this recipe but used 1T butter and 1T of vegetable oil and 5T of sugar with the vegetable oil instead of the 8T.  We will be making this every year during pumpkin season!

These were very good.  Cut down the sugar by about 1/4 and they were still very sweet.

I normally like my seeds salty but these were the best! I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I just used a little cinnamon, about 1/4 tsp. I will be making these from now on. Thx!

I made these for my son and he was asking for me to buy another pumpkin just so I can make more of the seeds.    I used cinnamon instead of the pumpkin spice because I had none.  They were wonderful.

Mine ended up in a giant hard ball. The taste was pretty good, but the effect was kind of like peanut brittle. I asked a friend about the results & she thought maybe I should have kept stirring until it cooled. The directions just say "until coated". Is this just something I'm supposed to know? I'd like to think I pretty proficient in the kitchen, but I guess this is my first try with pumpkin seeds. I might try this again to see if the stirring until cool works.

EXCELLENT!  My kids and I LOVED this recipe.  It makes the seeds taste like the nuts that you can buy at our mall and fair.  I cooked the seeds for 30 minutes on 275 degrees.  This would make a perfect party favor or gift for a teacher.  Just roll parchment paper into a cone, fill and tie the top with a ribbon.

Very good. I changed the process: After toasting the seeds, I heated them w/ the oil - then add everything else. The sugar melted and coated the seeds perfectly.

I guess you have to like pumpkin seeds to like this recipe. :)  The coating was yummy, but that was it.  No one in my family would eat them.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is amazing, with a LOT less sugar and I want to make sure people try it. As it stands, I could have never eaten it with that much sugar and probably would have rated it 2 stars. 

Here's what I did: I used 2 T Splenda in the coating mix (with salt and pumpkin pie spice made from the Pumpkin Pie Spice II recipe on allrecipes). In the frying pan, I used 1 T olive oil and sprinkled about 1-2 T sugar on it, stirring for about 2-3 minutes until the sugar melted. Then I tossed it into the coating mix. It was definitely sweet enough and the seeds are amazingly addictive!

Delicious!! Tastes a bit like popcorn, and the sugar and spice is just perfect. Can't believe I've thrown seeds away for years. I read somewhere that winter squash seeds can be used too. Very nutritious snack, will be making this every fall!

Although I will eat roasted pumpkin seeds, I am not usually a big enough fan that I go to the effort of making them as easy as they are (especially when my chickens enjoy them as they are). Well, I decided to try these with my family and then make them with them with the preschoolers I teach if they turned out well. I am glad I did; these were terrific! They reminded me of kettle corn with pumpkin spice and it worked very well! I am now a big fan of toasted pumpkin seeds and I know several others that now are too. I will make these each year when making my pie pumpkins and/or when carving pumpkins. I too used less sugar (cut down by 2 TBLS.) and it was plenty. Thank you for a great recipe!

So nummy.  Only made one change -- used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  It's a little healthier and adds a lovely flavor!

I wasn't sure at first how these were turning out, but when they cooled they had a beautiful sugary crust and were delicious.

My previous attempt at roasted pumpkin seeds didn't go over nearly as well as this recipe.  Even my eight-year-old gobbled them up.  I think one key is to toast them until they are light and crispy.  You can tell a difference when you are stirring them in the pan. Took about an hour for our batch.  Only problem I encountered was that the plain sugar did not really "melt" in the skillet to coat the seeds the way I imagined.  But they still took on enough flavor from the spiced sugar to be considered a success.

AWESOME...  I roasted them on parchment paper, so they wouldn't stick to the baking sheet.  I cut the sugar to 4tbsp like someone else suggested, and doubled the pumpkin spice because I'm crazy that way.

New family tradition!  Each year my family roasts the pumpkin seeds from our Jack O'Lanterns and we've used various recipes...all of which were good, but unmemorable.  This is a fantastic spin on our tradition, mixing a sweet taste with a salty kick.  Wish Halloween came around more than once a year!

These were addicting! I baked them for 1 hour at 275 until they were crispy. I followed the direction except for reducing the sugar in the spice mixture by 2 Tbsp. I think there was still too much grainy sugar on the seeds; next time I might just add everything in the pan so it actually sticks to the seeds.

I made these today...so so yum! My family loved them too. I tried making them with both white sugar and brown sugar. The white turned out better. Totally a years tradition in my house now!

My family and I loved these. We tripled the batch! :) I did do the carmelizing like someone said in one review. I used 3 tbsp olive oil and about 2 tbsp sugar and heated before adding the seeds, then when I added the seeds it made a carmel texture. I cut the sugar to 2/3 c  instead of 1 c and 2 tbsp. It was AWESOME!

Fantastic!  My  10 year old daughter found the recipe and I challenged her because we always make a recipe that is salty not sweet.  Was I wrong!!  This recipe was far better than the normal recipe I use to make salty ones!!  We did have to heat the sugar longer than the recipe said....

I only ended up using about 4 tablespoons of sugar, but these are delicious!  Oh, and I used one tablespoon butter and one tablespoon olive oil.

Not quite sure what happened, but the 1st measure of sugar solidified into sugar rocks instead of melting.  I think it would be better to melt the sugar and THEN add the seeds.  The flavors worked really well and my hubby loved them.  I liked them and I don't eat pumpkin seeds!

*The second time I made these, I forgot about my sugar problem the first time around. To remedy the problem, I just added a couple of teaspoons of water to the seeds and the sugar melted instantly. Worked great this time around.

These turned out really great.  I made a few changes. Instead of using vegetable oil I used olive oil.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I made my own with ground cinnamon,  ground nutmeg, ground cloves, and ground ginger.  They turned out amazing and several people asked for the recipe.  Just a hint to others, I didn't listen to the directions and used a plastic spoon which promptly melted.  Use the wooden spoon or you'll have to redo it like I did the first time.

It took longer than 45 seconds for the sugar to melt... more like a couple minutes and by that time the seeds were popping. I think next time I will try butter and melt the sugar before tossing in the pumpkin seeds. I'll add another review once I have tried this. Also, didn't have pumpkin spice so I used 3/4 cinnamon and 1/4 nutmeg. It worked fine. The flavor is great, just iffy on the cooking process.

This recipe did not turn out well for me. First of all, WAAAAY too much sugar! I didn't even use the full amount, and it was all caked in the bottom of the bowl. Second, if you want the seeds to taste like anything but seeds, you really must roast them WITH the seasonings on, rather than leaving it all to the end. I roasted mine plain as directed, and of course, they taste like plain pumpkin seeds with a hint of gummy sugar stuff that sort of stuck on them but mainly just fell off (I finally ran them through a strainer, just to get rid of the excess sugar). I added about double the pumpkin spice and it was still hard to taste with all that sugar. I don't know how sugar would do in the oven, (most likely would burn), so I'll stick with the plain salt and oil, brushed on while roasting, next time I have pumpkin seeds. I give it three stars because my husband says it has nice flavor, and I can see it does have potential. But I will not make again as is.

This recipe has so many things going for it: you can use seeds straight from carving, it is easy to follow, no fancy ingredients.  My husband was really impressed, thought I had bought them.  The trouble is, I'm just not keen on them so only giving 4*, sorry.

I, like many other reviewers, have never really liked pumpkin seeds.  My first grader had some at school and wanted to make them so we tried this. I am a convert!  Loved this recipe and our family ate them up quickly.  There was a lot of topping, you could probably cut back on that and still get good results

Soooo good!! I used coconut oil instead of olive oil, and truvia baking blend rather than just sugar to try to be a little healthy.  Also added coconut flakes. Amazing.

Extremely delicious!  It was hard to stop nibbling on these pumpkin seeds.  Perfectly crisp, just enough salt to bring out the sweet flavors.  Seeds for a second batch are in the oven. I don't buy pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and a pinch of cloves.  I may have been a bit generous in my spice measurements since we like it spicy.  As I was mixing, the ginger vapors were pretty strong.  If you are sensitive, you may not want to inhale over the bowl until it cools.

Delicious! I used butter instead of oil because I wanted the sugar to caramelize and I wasn't sure it was going to work with oil. Makes me want to make more jack-o-lanterns just so I can roast the seeds!

These were pretty good. I cut down on the sugar and still had a lot wasted at the bottom of the bowl, but these have a really nice flavor.

These were so good! I did it the easy way. After letting the seeds dry out over night, I just tossed them with the rest of the ingredients and toasted them in the oven at 275 for 35-40 min. I used 2 cups of pumpkin seeds and only 5 tablespoons of sugar. Awesome! I never liked pumpkin seeds until I made them this way.

Great flavor combo!  I did tweak things, based on other reviews and the first batch we did.  Ultimately the fave was using butter for the oil, and only one T. of sugar in the pan.  I also melted the butter/sugar before adding in the seeds...stirred them enough to make sure they were coated, then put them in the dry sugar mixture.  And for that, doubled the pumpkin pie spice as well as the salt.  I love savory pumpkin seeds, but this might be the family's new fave!

these are awesome.  Would have given them 5 stars but you do need to back off on the sugar by at least half.  I used exactly 3 tbs and that was way to much. Will make these again.

Never made pumpkin seeds before, and this was a great recipe to start with!!  Delicious!  I did cut down on the sugar by 2 tablespoons, and it still worked out perfectly!  A friend that never cared for pumpkin seeds before loved them!!

This was my first time roasting pumpkin seeds and they were delicious! My son who won't eat ANYTHING can't stop eating them. We used butter instead of oil and added 1 tbs brown sugar to the recipe when you coat them in the pan and mmmmmmmm yummy!

LOVE the flavor, you will eat them until your mouth hurts! Made them twice, 2nd time they came out a little burned, both times a little dry... I wonder if there is a good way to do them a little juicier....

This is excellent with a couple modifications.  I read previous reviews and noticed many said it was too sweet.  I used 2 TB of sugar and doubled the amount of pumpkin pie spice for the dry mix.  Also, instead of adding all that sugar with the seeds and oil I only sprinkled about 3/4 tsp of sugar over the seeds and also a little salt.

Fabulous!  I made 6 cups of these on a cookie sheet, so it did take 75 minutes (90 minutes total)  at 275 degrees to get it to a crispness I liked.  I then added it to the seeds and toasted a bit longer (like caramel corn recipes).  The only other changes were margerine instead of oil and I added each spice separately vs. the premixed pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, ginger, allspice all to taste, sorry that i didn't measure.)

Delicious! I made a batch of these and a batch of salty/spicy ones for a party and they went fast. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, but you can make your own with other spices you probably already have. To make 1 tsp pie spice, combine 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, and 1/8 tsp each of cloves and nutmeg. I doubled this recipe to use it all.

Made these as the recipe stated except instead of pumpkin spice I used allspice. 1 hr later the double batch I had made disappeared. My kids want to go get another pumpkin so we can make more! We will definately make these again.

These are so good!!!  I doubled the recipe, roasted about 30 minutes longer, and left out about 2 T of sugar.  These are addictively good; even my husband who isn't a huge sweets eater thought they were great.  I'll definitely make this again!

These are awesome!!!  I made the recipe with 4 T sugar instead of 6 and it was plenty sweet.  I also added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, which gave it a nice bite.  Definitely a must for the fall season!

The taste of this salty/sweet treat is even better than kettle corn! These turned out perfect using a compilation of suggestions from other reviews. I had four cups of seeds (three kids, so three jack o'lanterns). I dried the seeds overnight then roasted them in batches at 275 degrees, took about 20 minutes each. I heated 4 T. butter, 4 T. oil, and 8 T. sugar in the skillet. I added the seeds and cooked on high until the sugar was completely melted and the seeds were a little browner. I then tossed them in the spiced sugar mixture which I made with the original proportions except reduced the sugar (I used 8 T., two for each cup of seeds) and added extra cinnamon. I let them cool a little and then put some in a brown bag and took them with me while the kids trick-or-treated. I think it's gonna' be a tradition! Thanks for sharing Jani.

I have never made pumpkin seeds before.  But am beggining a new tradition, with this recipe!  Super tasty.  I only sprayed my pan with olive oil nonstick and used that to "melt" the sugar.  It was great, only used 4 tbps sugar and that was more than enough.  Great recipe.  Will do again next week!

I followed the recipe exactly but I'm not sure that my seeds turned out right.  The sugar in the pan never really disolved, it just went gloppy.  I turned the heat up a bit to try to get it right and the seeds started making loud popping sounds so I gave up and removed them from the heat.  It was very messy, had way too much sugar, and you couldn't really taste very much of the spice as the sugar was too overpowering.  The seeds are all gone, mind you!  I do love sugar, and it was hard to stop eating them.  But pumpkin seeds in general are very tough and chewey, and no amount of sugar or spice will mask that.

Amazingly easy and yummy.  We had four people over for pumpkin pie... at the end of the night the pie was only half gone, but the double batch of pumpkin seeds had completely vanished, and our friends all wanted a copy of the recipie.  They were fantastic, but next time, we'll try making them without the salt.

Wow, these are fantastic and easy!  I dried my seeds overnight in my oven (gas pilot light keeps it warm).  The crispy, sweet, caramely seeds are really delicious.  Have to add these to my holiday recipe collection!

Yum!  My very first time making pumpkin seeds and this was easy and wonderful.  I did make it with less sugar because I am trying to cut sugar and I used butter instead of oil.  Thank you for sharing.

These turned out great, definitely have to dry them first! Taste was very sweet, I used brown sugar rather than white and I think it gave it a richer taste.  I would increase the salt,but otherwise a great recipe.  Keeper for sure.

Very addictive. I had to increase to 300 degrees and use a cookie sheet to get them crispy but other then that the family is loving them. Next time I may increase the salts as others suggested but great as is.

This was the best batch of pumpkin seeds I ever made. They ended up perfectly coated, and a great balance of sugar, spice and saltiness. I did add a tbsp of butter to the oil and sugar, because it just didn't seem like it was coming together correctly. Perhaps it would have if I waited long enough. It appears that other reviewers had issue with this step as well.

Baked at 300F instead (because I was doing another pumpkin seed recipe at the same time). I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used cinnamon and ginger. In the skillet I used butter instead of oil. Came out really nice, thanks for the recipe!

Great receipe!  Definitely different from the typical salted seeds.  I mixed all ingredients together and baked them as other reviewer had and although the baking time was a little longer I achieved the same results.  I suggest using parchment paper though, as I lost one pan of seeds which stuck to the cookie sheet.

These we're 'eh'. I liked the flavor, but they didn't seem to really "roast". May try again and experiment a bit with cooking variations.

I added some allspice and ground cloves and just a dash of ground ginger.  These pumpkin seeds are excellent!  Not splintery like others and the flavor is so great!  Don't omit the salt as it really makes the flavors come together! I agree that's they're hard to stop eating!

Just to preface:  I do not like pumpkin seeds.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend, who loves them.  They were super easy to make and I ended up eating half before I was able to package them up for him.  I am officially a pumpkin seed convert; thank you!

These were so delicious!  My mom said they tasted like snickerdoodle cookies.  I like savory pumpkin seeds, but it is nice to have a sweet recipe for a change.  Even better than the sweet seasoned nuts you find in the stores!

These were wonderful! I did them all in one pan, as other reviewers suggested, stirring occasionally and spread on a cookie sheet to cool. Once cool, I broke them into pieces. They were positively addictive! Thanks so much! I am going to try this with some pecan pieces since the pumpkins are all gone! Thanks!

I made these for my husband, as he'd been wanting to try something with the leftover pumpkin seeds from the kids' Halloween pumpkins.  He said they were excellent, and he would cook - or have me cook - them again!  ;)

Fabulous. Completely worth carving the pumpkin. I will probably have to carve three or four next year, just to make sure I can make LOTS of this recipe!

Yummmmmmmm!!!! So good! THis was my first time doing pumpkin seeds ever, and I knew I wanted something sweet. This was easy and they turned out perfect!. I used butter instead of oil, and i used cinnamon instead of pumpkin spice. I am eating them as I am writing this!

This recipe is great! The taste is perfect. The only thing I changed was heating all the ingredients (except the seeds), then mixing the seeds in. I was in a hurry because the party start time was quickly approaching! :)

They were ok. I did not get the salty flavor I was looking for, and it seemed to late after to add more. They were good, but I may do something diffrent with them next time.

I made these for my family and they were a big hit.  Even my husband, who prefers savory pumpkin seeds, enjoyed them.  I want to try the same syrup technic with kettle corn and see how it turns out :)  Yummy!

Made these but doubled the recipe so there was plenty to share and the roommates finished them off in minutes! I bought pre-toasted seeds and went straight to the sugar steps and it worked great! I may add some cinnamon next time to see if it adds a bit more flavor!

Absolutely amazing! The spice/sugar/salt combination caramelizing the seeds was perfect (and I have actually never liked pumpkin seeds all that much before!). I can't wait to make these again!

These were just ok. I was pretty disappointed after such great reviews. My husband loves pumpkin seeds and said these just didn't have enough flavor. I don't think I will try these again.

When I was looking for pumpkin seed recipes after pumpkin carving, I wanted to make a few different kinds and this ended up being one. The first thing out of my friends mouth when reading the recipe was "this sounds complicated"- but it's not! Even the tradtional pumpkin seed fans who thought this sounded kind of gross really liked it! The only thing i have to say is really watch the sugar so it doesn't burn!

Delicious. I used individual spices rather than a half teaspoon of mixed spice, and less sugar but a great idea. I have never tried sweet seeds before, but I will definitely do this again. Thanks :)

Good recipe for pumpkin seeds.  We tossed the seeds with the spices/oil first and then toasted.  Took about twice as long as expected to toast up.  Also sprinkled kosher salt on the seeds about halfway through toasting.

tasty, quick little Halloween snack! I had some leftover sugar and spice pre-mixted from making an apple dessert, and just used this. When the mix hit the seeds in the hot pan, the house smelled wonderful. We aren't huge fans of pumpkin seeds, but love carving Jack O' Lanterns, and this was our favourite recipe yet!

LOVED IT!!  I never used to eat pumpkin seeds, but after this recipe, I couldn't stop eating them.  I took Parrot07's suggestion and put them in a skillet with 1 T of oil and 1 T of butter and caramelized the seeds.

This is my 3rd or 4th year making these. IMO the seed quantity is off. I have found that using 3 cups of seeds works much better with that much sugar. If you don't have that much seeds then definitely cut back on the other ingredients. Also, I use cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice.

These are the best pumpkin seeds I've ever had! This is how I'm always going to make them now! I followed the directions pretty much to a tee. Except I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I just put some nutmeg, cinnamon, and ground cloves instead. I also only mixed in 3 Tbsp. of sugar into the pan (making 5 total Tbsp. of sugar) rather than 4. It was plenty! Delicious and I will share this with all my friends!

These are AMAZING!!  I tried so hard to not eat a whole lot once they were done, but they were SO incredibly delicious, I couldn't help myself!  I hate a huge handful straight out of the pan.  Totally delicious.  The ONLY thing I did differently was double the recipe (we had huge pumpkins) and do a half/half of extra virgin olive oil/butter.  Seriously, I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  The best pumpkin seeds I have ever had!

These are good but mine clumped up so I would suggest cooling them a bit before adding to the last sugar mixture. We still enjoyed them and now you don't have to pick up one you get a whole cluster of em to eat!

WONDERFUL new way to eat pumpkin seeds - after so many years of the basic pumpkin seeds a change is well deserved.  They were very tasty - and so much better than the usual, will definitly make this way again.  I did use only 4 TB sugar as others advised, and they were plenty sweet.

Everyone loved these! The pumpkin pie spice was a nice touch. I had to bake them a while to be sure they were nice and crunchy, and I added some butterscotch chips and raisins to the final product for a "mix" - everyone at work inhaled them!

Easy to prepare, long part was the toasting of the seeds.  Just the right amount of sugar, salt and spice.  Even my husband liked them.  Would be really good on almonds too.

These were delicious and a nice change of pace.  They were so flavorful and easy to prepare.  The only change I would make next time is to use only about 2 more Tablespoons sugar when I heat them in the skillet.  I could hardly get all 4 extra Tablespoons of sugar to dissolve, and think the pumpkin pie spice and sugar mixture would stick just fine with half the amount of sugar syrup.

This was ok, but even as a sugar lover with a sweet tooth, there was way too much sugar. I used 4 tablespoons with a cup and a half of the seeds... just way too much. I would cut it back to a maximum of 3 tbsp. I also added in a few more dashes of cinnamon. Otherwise, very tasty.

Awesome recipe! I must have done something wrong the first time, as it turned out more like seeds mixed with sugary crumbles (it tasted fine and hubby and I ate it anyway). But the second and third time I tried this, it turned out perfectly, with a nice candy coating on each seed. Sooo very tasty and seasonal!

This recipe is really good. I more or less followed it except I used butter and a little oil and cut down on the sugar. I also roasted the seeds until they were golden brown.

These were awesome.  My 3 year couldn't stop eating them!  I couldn't stop eating them!  My brother who normally hates pumpkin seeds finished off the bag that I gave my mom.

If you like those almonds that they sell with cinnamon, you will like these.  They taste the same!

I did add a little cinnamon too it, along with the pumpkin pie spice.

We just finished making these and the kids absolutely loved them!  I used butter and evoo.  The sugar mixture in the pan didn't want to melt very well so I added a few splashes of water and that did the trick.  Great recipe.  This was the first time I've made toasted pumpkin seeds.  Thanks!

These were very good...We added a little bit more salt and spices and used less sugar....I would say next time I will add a little of the spice mix to the seeds at a time until adequately coated...There was too much "mix" for the amount of seeds we had...We will use less sugar in the pan as well.

These were great!  Even my 2 year old was gobbling them up!  

I did up the temperature to 325 degrees to shorten the time, sprayed them with olive oil, and stirred them every ten minutes for 30 minutes until they were toasted.  I also realized (after popping them in the oven) that I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice!  So, I used a pinch of Ginger, a dash of groung cloves, about 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and about 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon.  I took the oil and sugar and mixed it in the pan and heated them together though, they turned out perfect!  My families favorite now for the holidays!

I double checked twice.  It actually says six TABLEspoons sugar.  I barely used TWO and it was way too much.  Could do two TBSP with the recommended spices and about 2-3 cups seeds (not one) and it would be just right..

Delicious! This recipe basically makes candied pumpkin seeds, very similar to the spiced nuts you see in kiosks at the mall.

this recipe is amazing! the only thing that everyone was not so sure about was all of the sugar on the seeds. i had to double the recipe so i don't know if that's what caused it or if it was something else. otherwise they were amazing!!

Easy recipe for delicious, sweet toasted pumpkin seeds.  They remind me of candied nuts.

Super simple recipe that was easy to adapt to the small amount of Squash seeds I had (1/2 cup). I feel like the surgar could be reduced. I added just a touch of Cayenne pepper to a small portion of the seeds, love the sweet heat!

Made the recipe as is. 

I liked them, our kids didn't. Sweet & salty. Delicious!!! Only thing, I kept them in the pan until they started browning.... they tasted slightly burnt but I really didn't mind. Super crunchy for when you want a little snack!  Will definitely make these again. Next time, I'll need a bigger pumpkin!!!

These were amazing! I only used about 3 Tbs of sugar. I used 1 Tbs for the salt, and pumpkin pie spice mixture. I also put 4 Tbs of sugar in a small tea cup and sprinkled over the pumpkin seeds while cooking in the oil. I only used half of it. These are delicious and need to buy another pumpkin for some more seeds!

I had tons of seeds so I tripled this recipe.  Perhaps it's not agreeable to that. 
I agree with many other reviewers that the amount of sugar seems off.  "Sprinkle remaining sugar" is deceiving...there's way too much for a sprinkle. And it didn't budge in 45 seconds. I had to keep stirring as it smoked and the seeds browned... It never fully desolved and the seeds started getting into huge chunks (another reviewer said it's like peanut brittle...I agree). I had to finally take it off the heat because I didn't want the seeds to burn.  Then I dumped it into MORE sugar...it was just insane.  Wish it had more pumpkin spice too. 

The only reason I didn't give it lower stars is because the flavor is decent...it's just that they are clumped together with huge amounts of unmelted sugar coating them...not at all the texture I was expecting. (After posting this I went back and looked at the pictures...would have helped to do that ahead of time as most recipes looked like mine did. I guess the granulated sugar coating is the desired outcome.)

This is the first time in many years we cooked pumpkin seeds and they were actually enjoyed.  We had more seeds than the recipe calls for, but it was still plenty sweet.  My 2 year old called them "little cookies"

Love them!  I made 2 changes, one of necessity.  I didn't have enough white sugar so I put 2Tbsp brown sugar in the skillet to melt.  The other I've found I prefer butter in my pumpkin seeds so I put 1/2 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp olive oil.

Love these! I was a bit skeptical at first bc normally I would bake the sugar and spices on the seeds but I tried a recipe last year and they did not come out well. So I decided to try this one this year bc of its high reviews and wow! it did not disappoint! Sweet but with a slight salty finish. The seeds are crunchy and not chewy. Great Flavors!! I highly recommend this recipe!

These were amazing, I could not stop eating them. I am usually a savory toasted pumpkin seed girl with a little salt and some garlic powder. But I think these have changed that forever!  I also just mixed everything together with only 3 Tbsp. of sugar and baked at 350 for about  30 mins. Stirring every 10 mins. I have to go out and get more pumpkins so I can scoop out the seeds and make more of them this way!

I've have tried making a lot of different pumpkin seed recipes, this is by far my favorite!!! The only change I made is to soak the freshly scooped out and cleaned pumpkin seeds in salt water for 1 hour before drying off and spreading on the sheet pan ( this gave it the sweet and salty effect). My search is over, this will be my go to from here on out!

And I think I might start adding a little clove and nutmeg to my cinnamon sugar.

We have been cooking seeds for years with just salt on them.  This is a great twist on baked seeds with a terrific taste.  Thanks.  Read a couple of reviews prior to cooking and give it a whirl.

This was my first time cooking a pumpkin and I knew you could eat the seeds. This was really nice...possibly a bit too much sugar. Very bad for my teeth but I thought surely it doesn't matter this once? lol I enjoyed making this

I used almost 2 cups of seeds, and only 5 tbs of sugar, half of it truvia...  

The seeds weren't too crisp, so I did them for another 20 minutes at 275 degrees.

Turned out great - Pumpkin Pie Seeds!

This was awesome!  I never liked pumpkin seeds but this recipe made them tolerable!  They were sweet and salty at the same time.  Great recipe!

Delicious!  We took a bunch of these to a picnic with friends, and everyone raved.  The kids couldn't stop eating them...  One adjustment, as recommended in some reviews, we cut down on the amount of sugar during the cooking.  For a double batch, we cooked in oil with 5T sugar (not 8).  Still plenty sweet.  We will definitely make these again!

These turned out great!  I will totally be making these again next year.  I did make a few changes.  I used butter instead of oil.  Also I used a combo of cinnamon/ginger/nutmeg because I didn't have pumpkin pie spice on hand.  I also added a tad more salt.  Delicious!!

Great recipe! I'd never had pumpkin seeds any other way aside from baked and salted. This was different and very good! I DID add cinnamon to them as I LOVE a lot of cinnamon. They turned out great. My husband can't stop eating them and one of my girlfriends also liked them (who had nevr tried them this way either)! I will definitely use this recipe from now on. Wish I had more seeds to make!

Great alternative to reg. pumpkin seeds, but they didn't get as crunchy as we like.  Maybe I cooked them too long in skillet...

Made a batch of regular, and a batch of these. my son picked these as the best. I only used 4 tbsp sugar overall, but next time would use maybe only 2. I had about 1.5 cups of seeds.

I couldn't decide which recipe to make so I made 4 different ones at the same time.  I chose a middle of the road temp of 275 degrees.  They cooked for about an hour.  I really prefer the sweet pumpkin seeds over the salty/savory recipes.  Also recommend the Carmalelized Spicy Pumpkin seeds from this site.

These are good! However, I experience clumping one putting them in the frying pan. When I took them out of the frying pan, I put them back on the cookie sheet and put them back in the oven on 350 for about 5 mins (watch closely) and this helped! Thanks for sharing!!

Absolutely fantastic.  After the seeds came out of the over, they lasted exactly 5 minutes before hubby and I had eaten them all.  Great recipe!

Okay, my incarnation of this recipe was a bit of a stretch. We didn't have "pumpkin pie spice"--nor most of the ingredients that comprise it (it is made up of nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and ginger). I didn't have nutmeg, or allspice, and my only ginger was fresh. But I didn't let that stop me! I mixed in some cinnamon, paprika, shaved off some fresh ginger and... it was absolutely tasty! So I wouldn't let lack of particular spices stop you from experimenting with this recipe, you can hardly go wrong.

These were very good! The kids loved them.  Although, make sure the oil is hot enough before you add the sugar.  I don't think I waited long enough because the sugar wouldn't melt all the way.  They tasted great anyway.

This turned out really well!  I didn't have any pumpkin spice, so I just added a little bit of canned pumpkin, which worked out well.

I just finished making these 10 minutes ago... they are amazing.The only change I made was to the oven time and temp. I bake my pumpkin pies at 425 degrees for 15 mins,then turn the oven down for the remaining cook time, I placed the cookie sheet full of dried seeds(4 hours dried) on the top shelf while my pie baked, when the timer went off to turn the oven down, I took the seeds out. They were nice and toasted. Then I just followed the recipe. Like I said AMAZING!!! Thanks for sharing. This is my new and my only recipe I will use going forward.

Delicious! This was everyone's favorite batch of pumpkin seeds at our pumpkin carving party. I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice, though, so I just mixed up my own with cinnamon, clove, and a little ginger. I'd never tried pumpkin seeds with anything sweet on them before.  This was great!

Very yummy!  I used butter instead of oil when sauteing the seeds, and stirred until the sugar started to carmelize. This is a nice alternative to the salty version.

I loved this recipe! My kids ate the seeds for the first time in years! I will use a little less sugar next time because there was alot that did not stay on the seeds.

These were delicious--gone in no time. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is personal preference--I think I would prefer pumpkin seeds with a less sweet, more spicy seasoning. I, too, cut back on the sugar and am glad I did.

I liked these, but no one else in my family did.  I used less sugar, and they were still sweet.  It tasted like kettle corn.  I think my family loves crispy seeds and these weren't.

OH MY GOSH!!!  These are SOOOOO good.  I will never make any other kind again!  Once you taste these, you will not be able to stop eating them.  I would recommend making a double batch because they will go quickly!!!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I followed some advice and only used 4 Tbsp of sugar and it was plenty. But they turned out great! And they ARE addictive! We will be making these next Halloween.

This recipe was great.  I did change it a bit though.  I'm a diabetic so I used Splenda in place of the sugar and used cooking spray.  It's a great recipe!

Excellent recipe. I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup and added the sugar and spice to the oil in the pan along with the seeds then stirred over moderate heat until sugar completely melted. Break into pieces when cool. Thanks for the recipe.

This was our first successful pumpkin seeds recipe. I followed it pretty exactly, but I didn't use all the sugar called for. I also used sea salt instead of regular salt, and then added a bit more salt as I was stirring the seeds in the other spices. Very tasty!

Very good.  I only used 4 T sugar (2 T dry and 2 T in the pan) and it's still candy-sweet.  I also added a pinch of ground cloves and used virgin olive oil.  It is still very good but I would use less 1 T of sugar in the dry mix next time.

I am so glad I went with this pumpkin seed recipe!  I used a bit more spice, and it took my electric stove a bit longer than 45 seconds to melt the sugar, but slow toasting and candy coating is the way to go!

Amazing!!  I used squash and pumpkin seeds and baked them at 275 degrees because I love things crunchy!  I didn't have "pumpkin pie spice" so I used a dash of each cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom and they came out so delicious!  I'll definitely use this recipe again, I can't believe how easy it was!!

I have enjoyed 2 batches of these.  I made the first batch according to directions and thought it was very good.  For the second batch I substituted splenda for the sugar and butter for the oil and doubled the pumpkin pie spice.  Really good!

This was a great recipe.  I used it tonight along with another one for a savory pumpkin seed and I must say....I impressed myself.  I've never been a fan of pumpkin seeds but this recipe is great!  I have a feeling, my family will demand these from me.

We liked these! I had to toast the seeds for a little longer since I doubled the recipe and our seeds were big. I also sprayed them with Pam so they would not stick to the pan. But once they were toasted, things went VERY quickly. My 2 year old and 4 year old are quickly making them disapear! Next time I think I will add a bit more pumpkin spice. Thanks for a great recipe! A perfect end to pumpkin carving!

My whole family loved this recipe, the only reason I'm rating it a "4" is because I firstly cooked the sugar too long and nearly burned the batch!  The second time I watched more carefully and pulled the syrup off the stove as soon as was melted as recommended.  The two batches tasted very different!  The burned one was more like brittle!

Did as recipe stated. Everyone really like. Very good flavor. Maybe could be use with nuts instead of seeds.

These seeds came out so good - I think I over did it with the sugar (I put more than is required).  My husband could not put them down.  They were really good when they were still warm.

Holy Cow, these are the BEST!  I'm more of a "sweets" person, rather than savory when it comes to nibbles like these.  And after carving our pumpkin it's a great (and EASY) way to end the evening.

This recipe was perfect!  I needed a quick snack to take to a friends house and (along with a bottle of wine) I had all the ingredients.  Wow!  Terrific, sweet, crunch, salty snacking!  I had a bag of raw, organic pumpkin seeds in my pantry and I wasn't sure how I was going to use them, so this recipe gave me my solution! Simple and delicious!

I currently have another batch in the oven because I told my husband I was making them today, and as it stands now, there won't be any left when he gets home!  These are unbelievable!
