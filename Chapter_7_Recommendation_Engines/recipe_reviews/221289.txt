As written, this is super bland/tasteless! I ended up having to add more lemon juice and hot sauce, as well as salt and pepper and garlic...then it was good. I do have to say, that I did liked the addition of the Worcestershire sauce. This was a nice jumping off point, but it just needed more...Thanks for sharing. :)
