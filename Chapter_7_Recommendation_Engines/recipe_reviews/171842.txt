This burger is simple to make yet loaded with flavor and has a gourmet taste. We had surprise dinner guests and I happen to have all of the ingredients in my pantry. The recipe is too good not to share!

Rainy outside so I broiled instead of grilled, used Havarti cheese instead of Gouda and they still came out well. My only critique would be the nutrition info.  Wow...over 800 calories and 53 grams of fat for 1 burger.  I was surprised...

This recipe is fantastic.  The flavor of the burgers are really five star. The second time I made it I did not include the mushroom or the canadian bacon and it was still perfect.

I enjoyed these. The saltiness of the canadian bacon and the gouda went well with the turkey. I used a reduced fat gouda so it didn't melt as nicely, but tasted great. Next time I'd leave off the panko and make 5 patties.. they were quite big

To me an egg, breadcrumbs and meat equals meatloaf which is not what I wanted so I left those two ingredients out. What was left was a wonderfully delicious turkey burger that my girls and I all enjoyed. Portobellos are always awesome on the grill and they really topped off these burgers beautifully. Thank you!!

Delicious!  I skipped the smoke flavor and baked it at 375 degrees for 15 minutes on each side.

tried the turkey burgers tonight and was very pleasantly surprised.  Couldn't get my husband to try turkey burgers in the past but he really liked them.  Just a tiny bit dry but that's probably true of turkey burgers period.  The Panko bread crumbs - not sure they were needed.   I went a little light on the liquid smoke just to make sure I would like it.  Since I'm doing a diet - will do this recipe again and again.

Absolutely delicious! I suggest using a little less meat because the patties were huge and no one in my family could eat the entire thing. Also, if you're using an indoor grill like a George Foreman or a Cuisinart Griddle, you want to increase the heat and cooking time. 4 minutes on medium did nothing to my burgers.

Everyone loved this burger. I forgot the Panko coating but otherwise followed it exactly.  Burgers needed a little longer to cook and maybe a little more salt. Great turkey burgers!!

I made this for some of my friends in my little college apt. I was surprised how moist the burgers were even after i grilled them on a George Forman. I eliminated the liquid smoke and instead added some greek seasoning. It really made them taste great.  Thanks for a wonderful easy recipe.

GREAT and EASY GOURMET BURGER!  I didn't have liquid smoke or worchestershire so I used bbq sauce, my apology to Bakermom for butchering the recipe.  My "meat n taters" husband said I can make these again. THANKS FOR SHARING!

I had to make a couple changes to this recipe due to what I had on hand, and I had to change the cooking method due to the weather.  I used onion powder in place of onion, left out the liquid smoke, and browned the patties in olive oil then finished them in the oven instead of grilling.  For toppings, I used regular bacon that I had cooked until crispy the day before, gouda cheese, some mayo, and two pieces of lettuce.  These burgers had a nice meaty flavor and good crunch on the outside from the panko crumbs.  Even my picky two year olds ate some of the turkey with the cheese, which is a good compliment!!

I used this recipe for both beef and turkey burgers and it was delish!  I don't like liquid smoke but my boyfriend does- so the beef had it, the turkey did not.  Left off the panko and bacon because I didn't have any and used gouda on some burgers and asiago on others.  The egg is important to hold the turkey burgers together (egg whites only in my case).  Everyone loved it.  Served them on whole wheat buns. I'm happy to have found a recipe to make good turkey burgers!

My son said "one of your best meals ever". Just be super careful not to burn the burgers on the grill, since turkey is rather dry because of low fat content. Use low flame. I accompanied this dish with allrecipes' "macaroni and cheese III". It was a hit.

Fabulous!  We make turkey burgers frequently and I have to say...this was an easy gourmet way of making them!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!
