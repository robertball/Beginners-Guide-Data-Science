Adding cream cheese and sour cream to "smashed" potatoes is something I do routinely. Baking them after they're done is not. I really was very pleased with the end result--they are really so much more attractive this way than simply plopping some mashed potates on a plate!  I used full fat sour cream and cream cheese, and a good gob of butter as well. Threw in some chopped chives, baked them in a gratin dish, then garnished them with more chives and, yes, more butter.  Beautiful presentation for the lowly mashed potato! If I had been more ambitious, I would have taken it a step further and piped the potatoes into the dish with a decorating tip.  Next time...

This was not very good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Once it was removed from the oven it was so dense you could slice it with a knife.  My husband even tried to save it with butter and milk.  Needless to say we were quite embarassed as we served our Thanksgiving company.  No offense to the creator.

What an easy and tasty recipe! I made it exactly as written the first time, which garnered the 4 star review. The second time, however, I boiled some peeled fresh garlic right in the pot along w/ my potatoes and them mashed them all together. Oh, and I used redskin potatoes and didn't bother to peel them. SO EASY! These changes made it five star!

Wow these are very good and go great with grilled steak!  I used red potatoes and didn't pother peeling them, added a little butter, onion powder vs. onion salt, skipped the additional baking as I didn't see the need for it - creamy and delicious!

OH MY! These are divine! (Did I just say divine? Yes! I did!) They were a hit at my dinner gathering...everyone liked the slightly different texture the baking gave it. I followed the recipe exactly, adding just a few bits of butter to the top before baking. What a wonderful side dish! Don't make them TOO far in advance or the top will get crackly and a little dry. **I LOVE the subtle onion flavor. I usually use garlic, so this was a great way to get me to change it up. =)

I make these all the time.  However; I don't bake them at the end.  I just mix the boiled potatoes, margarine, sour cream, chream cheese, and pepper together and then serve.  YUM!

I always add at least sour cream to my mashed potatoes along with heavy cream, butter, salt and white pepper.  I've also made this recipe exactly and it is (cream cheese then bake) delicious! There are many ways to "dress up" mashed potatoes. Try some finely chopped salami and parmesan cheese before baking as well. DELICIOUSO!!!

This was very good.  This coming from someone who usually skipps the mashed potatoes.  My husband didn't use reduced fat ingredients and substitutes garlic salt for the onion salt.  It was a success.

These were a big hit with my family last night. I did use less sour cream & added some butter. Lots of fresh garlic & pepper. We don't eat salt (although I did buy the wrong butter & picked up salted). Everyone loved them. I made some baked carrots while these were cooking & it was great to have everything hot & ready to eat.

Came out great!  I always use butter, but the cream cheese made it super creamy, very light.  I would add a little more salt and pepper to taste, as the cream cheese doesn't give it quite as much flavor as the butter.

I made just enough to serve the two of us tonight. I boiled the russet potatoes in chicken stock with one garlic clove, which I later mashed together with the potatoes. I used reduced-fat cream cheese, full fat sour cream and butter as it’s what I had on hand. I also threw in some minced fresh chives. I piped the fluffy mashed potatoes into a small casserole dish and baked them uncovered for 35 minutes. These resulted in a different texture but pretty creamy smashed potatoes. The top of the mashed potatoes were baked crispy with brown edges and looked so appetizing. I garnished them with more fresh chives. This was rich, creamy, delicious and eye appealing (see my picture in the photo gallery). I served this with, “Chicken Biscuit Pie,” also from this website.

Prepared as is I found that the potato mixture was very thick and doughy and I was looking for a more light and fluffy potato dish.  I added about 1/3 cup milk to these before putting in the baking dish and they turned out wonderful.  I used 2 oz of light cream cheese and 2 oz of herb and chive cream cheese because that is what I had on hand and then topped the dish with some cheddar cheese that needed to be used up.  The whole family enjoyed the dish.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe made regular mashed potatoes take on a nice flavor and texture. They were very creamy and had a nice tartness from the sour cream. I didn't have reduced fat cream cheese or sour cream, so I just used the regular. I mixed the cheeses and other ingredients in a bowl until smooth and then added the potatoes and mashed them in it. Because I didn't think it re-heated that well, as it got really thick in the fridge, I will probably just make what I need for that evening if I make it again. But, that happen with regular mashed potatoes to sometimes. And, it could have also been thicker from the baking process. I would also like to try it with the reduced fat ingredients as on the recipe to see if it makes it even better.

I made these as directed except for the onion salt (because I didn't have any) and I didn't bake them. I used garlic salt instead. My husband and I loved these. I think a little chedder cheese sprinkled on top while still hot would make them even better.

Made these to go with chicken and noodles for a comforting dinner. I did add some butter and milk, only because they were really thick and I couldn't stir them! I used onion powder instead of onion salt. Yummy, but very thick and rich.

These mashed potatoes are wonderful! It was my first time making home made mashed potatoes and they were very easy to make. I used red potatoes and kept the skin on because I like the flavor better. I also added some butter and cheddar cheese to the potatoes while i was mashing them. The cream cheese and sour cream gave the potatoes a nice flavor that is not necessarily expected, but tastes great. I will definitely be making these again.

These were great potatoes. I used small Yukon potatoes and left the skin on while smashing. In addition I left out the regular salt as the onion salt was enough for my family and also added about 4 cloves of minced garlic. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I had my kids over for thanksgiving this yr - they are in their 20s and they loved these!  I would mix them a little more next time though as they were too lumpy for me -- but I only mixed them with a hand masher.  My kids didn't mind though -- they liked them that way.  I would also add just a touch more seasoning of some sort next time for a little more flavor.

These were fabulous! Will be making these for Thanksgiving this year. I used russets. Great full flavored dish, the additions just bring out the potato flavor even more. I did add 2 fresh cloves garlic to potatoes while cooking and smashed them along with the potatoes. On Thanksgiving I like to pre-make as much dishes as possible to lighten the time in kitchen on the holiday. I will be pre-making these the day before this year, put in large foil pan and reheat on the day of. I'll post how they turn out. Added edit:2/24/2012 WOW! these turned out soooo good as a pre-made dish and reheated next day! Best mashed potato recipe ever! I don't make my mashed potatoes any other way now. These are exceptional! Even when I don't have time to bake them they still are fabulous, however, the baking does lend a richer flavor to them. Thank you Megan for sharing a top notch recipe with all of us!!!

Very good flavor!  It's a little thick though.  Next time I'll add some milk to make it a little creamier and fluffier--and probably use a 9 by 13 pan.  It almost didn't fit in my 9 by 9.

This dish was amazing!  I made it as the recipe says and it was delicious.  Then I tweeked it a bit for my families tastes.  I replaced the cream cheese with shredded cheddar cheese, and used red potatoes in place of the typical white/yellow.  I suggest trying both ways!  Or maybe coming up with something yourself!  I think i'll throw in some chives next time....mmmm!

I've been doing my mashed potatoes this way for years and years. Only difference in ingredients is that I use garlic powder and white pepper.  Since I now have a very small kitchen and only one oven, I've started using the crock pot to keep them warm instead of letting them take up valuable oven space.  We all like them better this way, they stay creamier in the crock pot, the oven tends to dry them out.

These are a great mashed potato base to start from... I have never tried adding cream cheese but it was a great addition! I also added lots of garlic, chopped green onion, crumbled bacon and 6 tablespoons of butter. I also used un-peeled, baby red potatoes. With these modifications, they came out great!

Made these for dinner tonight, everyone loved them!  I followed the recipe except I added a few garlic cloves to the boiling water and mashed right with the potato's.  I didn't have time to put them in the oven, and they seemed dense enough without doing so, I was afraid they would turn out to dry. I used Idaho potato's, maybe a different kind of potato would have a different result.  I will definitely make these again and will try red potato's sometime.

I always use a recipe very similar to this for my holiday mashed potatoes.  It's a great way to get things done ahead of time when cooking a holiday dinner.  I ALWAYS use less cream cheese and sour cream than called for in the recipe and add milk until they are a little thinner in consistency than I like them when served.  They come out much better when adding the milk. KD in Massachusetts

this tasted awesome! Kids loved it! However, I'm all about less work...so instead of mashing, I used a hand mixer to "mash" the potatoes for me....you get really creamy potatoes this way...no chunks!

I add a little bit of hidden valley ranch dip powder, but they are good without it also.

Great smashed potatoes.. Just cooked them as a side dish for a neighborhood throw down and everyone loved them.

add a little more sour cream and cream cheese, delicious! I also kept the skin on and added butter, complete hit in my house!  I have been thinking of adding bits of bacon to it
