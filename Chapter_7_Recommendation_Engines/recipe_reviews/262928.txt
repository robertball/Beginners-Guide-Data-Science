This was good.  I only gave it 4 stars because the crunchy bacon made it seem like you were eating eggshells.  Otherwise, they were delicious.

Awesome, I have used old-time family recipes from both my wife's and my family's - for years. Gave this a shot for something different and we got 5 out of 5-stars from all 5 members! Excellent!
