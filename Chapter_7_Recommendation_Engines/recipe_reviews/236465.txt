Living in Arizona where  the temps reach the triple digits, this tea is very refreshing and simple to make. I like to use Splenda instead of sugar and I served it with a delicious Alfredo dinner. Seriously, try it sometime- you'll be amazed.

This is a delicious sweet tea, very refreshing and full of flavor. I used agave nectar to sweeten it  as a healthier option. My daughter helped me mash the fruit and we both drank it wishing it was summer.

I love peach tea and orange tea, so this is reight up my alley.  Even though I am not one for sweet tea, I ended up adding 1/2 teaspoon of Splenda as it was not sweet enough for me.  I would make again.
