I'm from Barranquilla, Colombia currently living in the States. I made this recipe, but I added corn, cilantro, some Tabasco sauce and instead of cassava I added yucca. That's the way my family has made sancochos all the time. It's very tasty, I really liked it. I would really suggest replacing cassava with yucca. You can also try replacing the chicken with ribs(sancocho de costilla)

Although this recipe is very good, it lacks the amount of cilantro that is normally found in traditional sancocho.  My wife is hot off the boat from Colombia and when she makes it she uses close to one cup of cilantro and adds a spice blend similar to Sazon(Goya section) that puts it over the top.

Both Sancocho and Ajiaco are Colombian soups. BTW, Panama was part of Colombia until 1903, so it should not be surprising that we share that dish. There is also a Dominican Sancocho. In any form, all these dishes are delicious. Enjoy them!

I was very glad to find a good recipe for sancocho on here!  It was one of my favorite things when I lived in Panama.  Incidentally, several people are a bit confused with terminology, so I wanted to clear this up: cassava = yuca = tapioca.  They are identical, just different names for the exact same plant.  So you don't need to substitute yuca for cassava... it's the same!  Also, it's "yuca" not "yucca".  The later is a completely different plant and not related to the one used here.

All I can say is... Yum! Very authentic. The only thing I added to the recipe is a boullion cube and corn to the soup. I serve rice and avacado alongside. Try it! It's great for a cold weather meal.

Tip: Cassava and Yucca are one and the same.  You can find frozen Yucca (skin removed & par boiled) in specialty food stores.  Goya is one brand that processes Yucca.  Just thaw and remove the woody vein in the center before cooking.

This was a good soup. Not as hearty as the Caribbean version, the one from the Dominican Republic has more ingredients: Culantro, cilantro, more root vegetables, different meats, chicken, beef, sausage. I will upload my dominican version soon.

Very good. I like the thought of eating an authentic Columbian dish. Very good, and interesting textures. Maybe a little plain though, but I think that may be the way Columbian food is supposed to taste.

Taste just like the Sancocho I had growing up in Panama! A few changes to make it more Panamanian: Leave out the onion/tomato garnish (the soup really doesn't need it), add a can of corn, triple the cilantro, and if you don't have yucca or calabasa don't worry about it add more potatoes.

I vary this recipe with different combinations of ñame, yuca, green and ripe plantains, malanga and various spices.  As for the issue of the origin of the soup, you have to go back further than pre-Panama.  Sancocho in Latin America, especially the Caribbean, evolved from both Puchero Canario and Sancocho of the Canary Islands, which were brought with "Canarios" -- Canary Islanders who emigrated to Latin America.

I do not know about the history of this dish, however I took the plaintains and sliced them, smashed them into patties and fried them on an open skillet and served them next to this dish.  No plaintains were added to my soup.  I used Yucca root in place of cassava.  They are easier to find and I believe they are the same food. Soup was wonderful!

Such a delicate flavor from such a hearty soup!  
The different textures and flavors has made this our new "Sunday family dinner" favorite.

Delicious! Very simple, good and cheap! Leg quarters are usually inexpensive and the veggies didn't cost much either.  I was hesitant about the plantain but it's good!! I couldn't find yucca but it still turned out great.  The onion and tomato topping is a must!!

FYI - AJIACO is the national Colombian chicken soup.  SANCOCHO is the national Panamanian chicken soup, made w/cassava and culantro only.  Credit where credit is due!

There is also a Sancocho we make in PR! I am not going to argue about authenticity and such...that's not important!! It's the equivalent of arguing about Dim Sum, TOO MANY VERSIONS!! Anyways... what's important is the actual review of this particular recipe. I don't care for bones (yeah, it adds flavor and blah blah) so I used boneless chicken thighs, a bit more garlic, YUCA root and CASSAVA root are the SAME THING!!!! Look it up!! The color of the sancocho is not appetizing and I wasn't 100% happy with the flavor. It was edible (got to have fresh bread to dip in the juices, in my case) and it was altogether ok.

I enjoyed making this recipe, I did add some hominy when I added the potatoes, I didn't use cassava because I used what I had on hand. Also, when making the tomato sauce I threw in some spicy peppers to give it a little kick, it was worth it. Will prob. make again. Thanks.

My husband is from Colombia and I've made this stew a few times for him before and he just loves it. He said it seems pretty true to the sancocho he used to have back at home. The only problem I've found is that 4 lbs of cassava and 2 lbs of potato is just too much. Also 4 lg. onions for the topping is exessive as well. I ended up having to use 2 lg pots to cook the stew. In the future I plan to use 1/2 the amount of potatos and cassava so I can cook everything together. The recipe really ends up serving a lot more than 6 people; we ended up getting 10 servings or so. We couldn't find leg quarters at the store but used chicken breasts on the bone and it worked just as well.

This was not a bad dish, but certainly not worth the effort involved. The cassava root was hard to peel considering that it ended up tasting like a potato.  Actually, everything in the stew (other than the chicken) tasted like a potato, only starchier. However, the chicken was delicious. My husband and I decided to remove the chicken from the bones and keep the onions and tomatoes topping. We’ll eat them together as leftovers. Judging from the other reviews, I think this makes a great cultural comfort food. It just wasn’t for us.

This is a great dish, pretty easy too, one of my friends and I made it in my dorm kitchen for a class project (really impressed the teacher).  Half a recipe is more than enough for 6 people.  Made a lot of friends with this recipe :).

Suggest cutting plantain into smaller pieces, yuca could be shaved instead of adding in chunks, and add 1Tbsp chicken bullion.

I browned the chicken (used skinless thighs), plantain and onion in olive oil first (boiled meat looks especially gross imo). The chicken turned out ok, and I didn't mind the root veggies, but the plantain was dry, tasteless, and generally horrible. I'm glad I tried this but I wouldn't make it again. Thanks anyway.

This recipe was very delicious. For one of the comments below Ajiaco is not Columbian, it's the Cuban version of sancocho but the Cuban version has corn, pumpkin, malanga and stew meats in it. Dominican sancocho is also like the cuban version. Regardless all of them are very delicious and very Hispanic/Latin American. One pot wonder. Thanks for the recipie!
