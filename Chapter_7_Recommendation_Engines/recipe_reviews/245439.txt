Wow this was good! I loved what fresh ginger did to the flavor of the squash and the apples. Such a great combination. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Perfectly delicious! I made it as written, but only used one T. of curry powder and it came out great. I will use 1 and a half next time. It served 6. I had coconut cream instead of milk on hand but it was great. The squash took 45 min. to cook in the convection oven. It was labor intensive for me but worth the effort. Note: since making it the first time I have learned not to use red curry powder as it is too spicy for my family.

To speed things up I added unsweetened apple sauce. Served with bacon bits for a non-vegan twist!

I replaced the water with chicken broth and be sure to peel the apple. Plus added rice at the end and cooked chicken. VERY GOOD RECIPE

This is a delicious and hearty fall/winter soup. I added a can of pumpkin, some Apple cider and honey to taste. Next time I would reduce the curry by 1/2. My family loved it.

Delicious! I loved the sweet and savoury flavors here. The curry and turmeric give it a bright orange color, too. I used some roasted, pur√©ed squash I had in the freezer, so this came together quite quickly. Thank you for the recipe.

I loved this soup.  Absolutely loved it.  It warms you right down to your toes and makes you thank Mother Earth for her fall veggies and fruits.

My husband and I loved this and went back for seconds.  I added the full amount of curry then tasted it before adding the coconut milk.  I was worried it would be overpowering, but after the coconut milk, it was great.  Only changes I made were using vegetable broth instead of water/salt and simmering it longer. Sprinkled some roasted sunflower seeds on top since I didn't have pumpkin seeds.  Looking forward to having the leftovers!

Really good and simple - I didn't put enough curry in, but added it after first bowl.  I always hold back to begin with.
