I will give this 5 stars for presentation!  They look great.  However, just by reading the ingredients I could tell they would be bland so I added some spices to my preference like garlic powder, onion powder, salt and Pepper to the pasta.  Because my true favorite recipe for Mac & cheese has cottage cheese and Parmesan cheese in it, I thought I'd add them too!  I am glad I did.  So, I can't really rate this recipe as written because I tweaked it too much, but baking them in the muffin pan is a brilliant idea and it went over well with my daughter who only likes the boxed process kind...untill now!  thanks.

I wanted to make something special for my son's first day of Kindergarden. This fit the bill perfectly. 

I used 8 oz. extra sharp white cheddar, 4 oz. sharp cheddar and 4 oz. grated parmesan cheese. I sauteed a little garlic in with the butter, then added the milk and eggs. For me, this made 16 large mac and cheese muffins. More than enough for a couple lunches or dinner warmups.

My son was impressed with handheld macaroni and cheese. I'll make this again for another special occasion.

EDITED TO ADD: My family at all 16 mac and cheese muffins. This was a huge hit.
Think about making it my way. You'll thank me.

The mac and cheese is no doubt bland - but, that can be fixed.  I too like the idea of using muffin tins to cook this.  Makes lovely individually sized servings and you really can't find anything more simplistic than this.  I froze them and have found they make perfect lunch time treats.  As for the mac itself, I admit that I doctored it up quite a bit to make it better.  Add black pepper, more cheese and even a dash of garlic powder.  I also added some sour cream to the noodle mixture and it comes out tasting creamy and delicious.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made these for my son's Christening, as I wanted to serve comfort food, but not a box of store-bought mac and cheese!  My husband and I did a few test runs before the big event, just to work out any kinks.  We finalized the recipe by using 3 cups of sharp cheddar (instead of the 1.5 cups) and adding an extra 1/2 cup of milk (total of 1.5 cups of milk used), because we thought they were a little dry and bland with the basic recipe.  I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika to the mixture before putting it into the cupcake pan.  To get the best results, we used foil cupcake liners, so they came out easily and were a little more individualized for our guests.  They came out amazing, and were a huge hit with everyone!  The were gooey and had great cheesy flavor!  My mom (who is known for her baked mac and cheese) asked me for the recipe for Thanksgiving!  Thanks for the fun twist on a classic family dish!  :)

First I have to say my 6 year old son gobbled this up! He loved it! However, it was a little bland for me and the breadcrumb topping was salty. I followed the recipe without any change. On the positive side it was creamy yet kept a good muffin form. Next time I will lessen the salt in the crumb topping and maybe add a little salt in the mac mixture instead. This was such a fun food! Thank you.

EDIT: I'm back to add an afterthought. I heated these up the next day and I have to say, they reheat very well. They weren't bland the next day. It seems to be that this is a great "make-ahead" meal. Delicious!

At first I was a little skeptical because of the other posts. I was expecting something super bland, but I thought I would try it as is and I actually really liked it, as did my kids. They usually do not like strong flavors/spices, so this was perfect. real easy and fun too!

This dish is always a big hit - of course, I tweek it to make it a little more flavorfull by adding garlic pepper and seasoned salt to the eggs, chicken bouillon to the boiling macaroni water, and sub one cup of parmasean cheese. I also add half the bread crumb mixture to the macaroni mixture itself to help make it more "muffin-y". If you spray the crumb topping with cooking spray before baking, it will crisp up better.

For the most part I enjoyed these, but there were less of a hit with the kiddos than I thought - a few of the pasta corners got crunchy which they did not like. I think that next time I will cover with foil until the last few minutes and see if they are more gooier.

I questioned the use of mozzerella cheese in this receipe but I tried it anyway.  The mozzerella does not melt like cheddar cheese.  I could not get it blended in.  It is way too stringy to use in mac and cheese.

The best mac'n'cheese recipe I've made.  The only thing I added to the recipe was a Tbs. of ground mustard.  So delicious!

These tasted great! My pasta said to cook for 11 min, and I cooked for 8 which was perfect. I used closer to 2 cups each of medium cheddar and jack cheese, and about 1/4 cup shredded parm. I left out the bread crumbs because I don't care for them much on my mac. I was concerned the sauce would be too thin, but it firmed up perfectly. I also covered the mac with foil and cooked for  20 minutes to avoid browning. A nice change to the casserole mac & cheese dish, but I didn't care for the clean up so I'm not sure if I'll make again...

These came out even better than I was expecting, however I took the advice of other reviewers and tweaked the seasonings a bit to avoid a bland result.  I added about 1/4 cup of sauteed finely chopped onion, a dash of garlic powder, pepper and about 1/4 cup grated parmesan in addition to the cheese in the recipe, and along with the recommended cheeses, I also used up a little shredded Mexican blend that I had on hand.  I was worried about the mac n cheese setting correctly, so I added about a tbsp of flour - no idea if it really had an effect, but the end result (after cooling) was perfectly set but still moist.  And more importantly, delicious!

Maybe it's because I like my macaroni and cheese creamy that I wasn't a big fan of this. It is anything but, but then I guess it would have to be on the dry side in order to keep its shape.  I noted some of the reviewers'  comments that this was bland, lacking flavor.  Normally I dismiss comments like that, thinking that some people forget or don't appreciate  what simple fresh flavors are or taste like.  And in this case, I wondered how this could be any more bland than any other basic macaroni and cheese recipe, since the ingredients were essentially the same.  But curiously this WAS bland, and it WAS rather flavorless, and I had even given it a good shot of King Arthur's Vermont Cheese Powder!  And again, this was dry, all the sauce absorbed during baking,  which won't appeal to others like myself who prefer creamy macaroni and cheese.  So for me the macaroni and cheese itself was mediocre, forgettable. But I'll give it five stars for presentation and cuteness.  Overall,  I'll  rate this four stars and call it a day.

Great recipe, Joplin - you're contribution rocked the mac 'n cheese snobs' world with such a great method & presentation. Thanks for sharing.    Of course, everyone enhances a recipe to their own taste, but you deserve 5 stars for a beloved American classic recipe taken to a higher dimension in it's presentation.  Very cool.

Liked them - didn't love them.  I really like the novel idea of these, but they are a bit on the dry side.  I'm going to keep playing with this recipe to try and add some moisture.  I individually froze 10 of the 15 cups.  They heat up nicely, but are still a "stiff" version of mac and cheese.  I'm going to make these again and will update if I figure out what to add to increase the moisture.  Thanks joplin_7_7_7 for sharing.

I LOVE this recipe!  To give it a somewhat 'fancier' flavor, I like to substitute half the olive oil with truffle oil - YUM.  Also, I will add a cup of breadcrumbs to the mixture itself, in addition to just putting them on top.  To serve at parties as an appetizer, I bake them in foil baking cups for easy serving and reheating (have tried both the small and large foil cups - both work great).

I halved the recipe but used the whole egg.  I added minced onion, red pepper flakes and Worcestershire for additional flavor after reading the reviews that said they were bland.  I used extra sharp cheddar and romano cheese with no additional cheese on top but just a sprinkle of Panko on top.  These are very good and a simple way to make individual portions of mac and cheese.  Thanks!  I will make them again.

super cute idea for mac and cheese!  added seasonings as did most other reviewers (garlic and onion powders, cracked black pepper), and i omitted the oil in the topped as it seemed unecessary.  these turned out to be creamy although i was worried they'd be dry.  for some bizarre reason my kids wouldn't eat them, which is so weird - they love macaroni and cheese.  but i thought they were good!  thanks!

These muffins were very tasty, and I think they may have even tasted a little better warmed up the next day. I only had unseasoned bread crumbs so I added some seasoned salt to them and that turned out well, although now that I've eaten them I would also recommend adding some seasoned salt to the pasta itself to give it a little more zip. Perhaps a little garlic powder or pepper as well depending on your tastes.  I would also recommend adding more of the sharp cheddar to the pasta and maybe a little less to the top. Overall though, they were easy to make and turned out pretty well.

I loved this recipe! I was so worried I was going to mess it up, but it ended up fabulous! My husband loved these so much! I don't understand why people in the reviews said they were bland. Maybe they did not use seasoned bread crumbs or put enough salt in the bread mixture. One thing I noted, I let them rest for at least 5 minutes. Mine slightly fell apart, but when I went for seconds they held their shape! Don't be afraid to put the bread crumb mixture or the cheese on top. The only thing I changed is I used whole wheat elbow macaroni. Great recipe!

I've only made a few changes, which is typical for my regular mac & cheese. I always cook the macaroni in water & chicken boullion cubes for a much richer flavor. I don't add the breadcrumb topping and add a little white pepper to the mac & cheese mixture. The macaroni will absorb most of the milk so if you think it looks too dry, add a little more milk or 1/2 & 1/2, just don't make it too soupy. I make mine in a mini-muffin tin sprayed with butter flavored spray and they make great appetizers!

What a great idea!  Served these at my 2 y.o. b-day party.  Perfect for tiny hands.  I was short on time so I used a packaged blend of shredded cheeses rather than grating my own.  I made these in 2 batches and for some reason the first batch crumbled apart, and the second batch stayed firm.  Maybe it needs to rest a bit after everything is combined before putting into the muffin tins.

Great Dish!  I'm trying out recipes that could be taken in my kidos lunches to school.  Made 2 changes: we don't eat eggs, so I used an egg replacement product..  Also, instead of bread crumbs, I used Panko (I also doubled the amount).  The kids thought it was great!

This is good and is a great idea.  I will doctor it up a little next time because it was a little too bland for me--I like my spices!  I usually use a little mustard, a pinch of thyme, a tad of sour cream and black pepper and an additional egg and more cheese.

These are very good, but they do come out bland so you may want to add more salt the pasta and less to the bread crumbs.

Good but bland.  Need to add some bacon and garlic salt to liven them up.  If making as an appetizers definitely use a mini size muffin tin.

As preparation for my 2-year-old's birthday party, we tried multiple versions of mac and cheese -- THIS RECIPE IS THE BEST HANDS DOWN.  Other reviews mention that it is a bit bland, and so I added a little garlic powder and Ms. Dash.  Also, I use RITZ crackers for the topping.  The second time I made them, I completely forgot to add anything extra, and we hardly noticed the difference.  They were a HUGE hit with both kids (ages 2-10) and adults at the birthday party!!  We served all finger foods, so the mac-muffins were the way to go in that respect as well.  I made them in mini-muffin tins, so they were a 3-bite type of appetizer.

UPDATE:  Maybe I was just in a Mac and Cheese mood when I previously gave this 5 stars, but I have made this at least 4 more times and it's just not as good as I remember.  To be fair, I haven't been putting it into muffin tins, just a baking dish, but it's just not a 5 star for me anymore.

For concept alone, these babies get 5 stars, LOL!!  Mac n cheese in a muffin, doesn't get much better than that!  My 6 yr old and 1 yr old especially loved these (me too!), my middle guy is a bit pickier!  I did switch up the cheese based on what I had, used some light cheese whiz to make them creamy in with shredded mozz.  I too added some granulated garlic, pepper and mustard powder to the mixture and used panko crumbs (added some garlic and oregano too).  Fantastic, I got 18 muffins out of the recipe and these will become a regular in our house, thanks for sharing!
**UPDATE 02/08/10 - have made these a few times and always add seasonings to both my breadcrumbs (panko) and some to the cheese mixture as well!  My 2 older boys (8 and 6) love them...they work beautifully in my silicone baking cups!

This turned out great - but as others suggested I added a little seasoning before baking.  Some Mrs Dash and garlic powder.  I skipped the breadcrumbs nd just added cheddar chesse at the very end on top!

I did not try the recipe as-is.  I minced and sauteed a small onion in the butter, then added 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard.  Instead of the 1 cup Milk, I added 1/2 C Half N Half to the Macaroni after draining, then added the onion/butter mixture and cheeses (I used what I had in the house which was 1-1/4 C Monterey Jack/Cheddar, 1-3/4 C Sharp Cheddar.  

Out of 3 kids the good eater among them asked for seconds.  The pickiest one said No Thanks, the other thought they were okay.  I, on the other hand, thought they were terrific which means I need to cut back on the onion and definitely leave off the crumb topping.

This was excellent with only slight modification and a very easy recipe which both adults and children devoured! Modifications: I added 1 tsp salt and 1tsp pepper and 2 dashes of cayenne pepper to the mac and cheese mixture. I also used plain Panko bread crumbs and added 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, and a dash of cayenne to the bread crumb mixture before adding the olive oil. The tiny amount of cayenne pepper gave this recipe a little more flavor without being spicy. I did not use Mozzarella cheese as that seemed strange for a mac and cheese recipe. Instead, I used 3 cups of a mixture of shredded Cheddar, Gruyere, and American cheese (Harris Teeter sells their own brand of this "mac and cheese" ready shredded cheese mixture, which I used). The recipe was delicious and EASY.

Yeah, mozzarella cheese was an exceptionally poor choice for this recipe. It got all stringy and was very difficult to incorporate. I did heat the macaroni mixture to get the mozzarella to melt and eventually got it incorporated enough to finish the recipe but next time I would definitely substitute jack cheese instead.

I just made these this afternoon. We couldn't wait until they were cool enough to taste...mmmm!!! I made them for a work cocktail party I'm hosting next week...I may have to make more. Here's what I did to change up the recipe.
Made mini cups lined with prosciutto and also without for the non meat eaters. To the recipe I added some Dijon mustard and some paprika and a little extra milk to make them extra creamy since I'll be freezing and reheating. I topped them with a mixture of panko and cheddar. I might try some caramelized onions next time. The recipe is a keeper.

I doubled the recipe thinking to make 24 muffins, but it really made 20 muffins. I added onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper and just a touch of nutmeg to the mixture prior to baking. I also added a dollop of sour cream after adding the egg to add creaminess. I have no idea why the recipe calls for so much breadcrumbs. You only need a bit with which to top each muffin -- same goes for the reserved sharp cheddar.

I added some bread crumbs into the macaroni mixture.  If it looks too dry add some sour cream or plain yogurt to make it more moist.  I also only used cheddar cheese, as that's what I had on hand.  I followed another reviewer's advice and sprayed the tops with olive oil after I put the bread crumbs on to make it more crunchy.  I make these in a mini size for a party, they were very well received.

Oh, also, add some spices to the mixture.  I think I used salt and pepper, onion and garlic powder, and smoked paprika.

This is not the best mac and cheese I have ever tasted- but the presentation makes up for it. I used all cheddar instead of part mozzarella, but otherwise followed the recipe. They turned out great- kids loved them. Will definitely make again.

I liked the idea of the muffin shape for mac and cheese.  However, this really needs a cheese sauce, held together with a little flour.  Made the way it calls for, the cheese clumped and the milk pooled in the bottom.  Although they did stick together after cooling, the top half had no sauce on the noodles.  I added garlic like another reviewer recommended, and it was a nice addition.

5 for creativity, but only a 2 for flavor.  This is a terrific idea.  The individual portions are great for school lunches.  Unfortunaely, the flavor was bland.  I think I'll adapt my regualr recipe to this method.  Thank you for the inspiration.

These were a little bland, even after I added hot sauce to the macaroni and seasoned salt to the bread crumbs.  My kitten, however, seemed to love them. I found him on the counter digging in!

OK, I have made these 3 times now and I end up eating them not my kids.  I love them.  Old fashion mac cheese taste.  Not processed enough for my munchkins because they want the box stuff.  Hopefully one day they will convert-until then, I will continue to enjoy these!

This was a hit. I was skeptical when the milk didn’t absorb well but it all stayed together in the end with the muffin shape. The only thing I changed based on comments was I added a little garlic powder, black pepper and a dash of Parmesan on top. I also used panko bread crumbs and only used 2 kinds of cheddar skipping the mozzarella.

This turned out really well. I used a little less milk, and added garlic powder and Parmesan cheese.  The muffins held together well. I used white cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. Will def make again.

12.21.16   Had to sub Six Cheese Italian blend (it has mozzarella in it) for the mozzarella, it’s what I had on hand.  I totally love mac and cheese cups for portion control, since I tend to pig out when I have a dish of it in front of me (love it!).  They are just loaded with flavor, and will be the perfect side dish for a Christmas ham dinner (they’re going into the freezer today).

These muffins have become a family tradition. Which is funny because everyone knows I normally am not allowed in the kitchen. I will admit that my family requested some upgrades to the recipe but my first two batches were original and they love if both ways!

These were ok.  Definitely a little bland so I would suggest some seasoning- we added some garlic powder.  At least they were fun but not sure I'll make them again.

We didn't love these. The muffin idea is a great one and I may use that again, but I really didn't care for the actual mac and cheese part- in the future, I will use my stand-by recipe and use the muffin cup idea. Thanks for sharing!

I give these four stars, because I made a few changes. I added cheddar, mozzarella, smoked gouda, shredded parm, and a little bit of ricotta I needed to use up. Seasoned to taste with onion powder, garlic, S & P. Held there shape well. Will make again. Thanks for sharing!

this was pretty good.  I did add a little garlic to add some flavor.  I ran out of room in my muffin pan so I used my mini muffin pan.  Great idea!  The kids loved them!  When they were a little cooler they could use there fingers to eat it. they loved it!

These individual mac and cheese "muffins" were outstanding.  I served them at a cocktail party and they were the first food item to disappear.  I doubled the recipe and added garlic powder, onion powder and some cayenne, since it wasn't for kids.  I would suggest coating the muffin tins heavily with cooking spray and allowing them to cool completely before you attempt to take them out.  I just reheated them in a chafing dish and they were absolutely delicious.  I wish I would have had leftovers.  This recipe is a keeper.

The concept for this recipe is good, however there were a couple of problems -the breadcrumb topping was pretty dry.  I think I will try a butter and cracker crumb topping instead.  Also, the cheese needs to be a bit creamier.  This recipe needs some work, but I am willing to try it again.

I'm really glad that I read the reviews before making these! I used less salt in the breadcrumb mixture and more salt and black pepper in the pasta mixture. I also baked them in mini-muffin tins so that they'd be more bite sized. I loved the crunch on the outside, it was a hit all around! Thanks!

This turned out ok, but probably would have been fabulous if I hadn't used my own homemade breadcrumbs (I overtoasted the bread!).  The muffins were very cheesy and rich.  Our children really loved them and they were even better as leftovers.

I thought this mac and cheese was very bland. While I can see this being good for some kids, I like my kids to experience more flavors. They barely touched them anyway. I think for a muffin, they're too greasy to hold. I would also have liked it to be creamier. I think putting it into muffin tins dries it out too much.

I made these last night to go along side BQ ribs .Not at all bad - but not my fave . I think if I make them again I will leave off bread crumb topping . I heated one for lunch today to see how they reheat ( pretty good reheat ) and found myself eating only under the bread crumbs & liked that much better . It made 12 pretty good size portions .

Hey everybody Jesus here!  Just wanted to say that I thought this was an amazing idea.  Now to all of my friends on this website who say that this recipe is too bland I hear you! My child Iris decided to add some garlic salt to this wonderful recipe and let me tell you:  worlds were blown; my mind exploded.  It honestly adds so much flavor to the  pallet of the Mac and cheese.  This wonderful recipe was made even better and everybody enjoyed it!  So all of you rude people giving this recipe one star you should be more creative.  Thank you for your time Jesus out

This recipe provided a great framework for me. I used it liberally, adding broccoli, chicken, onions and a variety of spices (paprika, garlic & onion powder, salt, pepper), and a wider variety of cheeses (feta, parmesan, pepper jack & aged white cheddar) along with the mozzarella the recipe calls for. I don't think I necessarily added MORE cheese, but just smaller amounts of a variety. I also used different noodles. About half of them sort of fell apart when I took them out of the pan, but everything was so delicious I can't complain.

I looked everywhere and couldn’t see how many servings the recipe is supposed to make. I had to run out and buy everything again because I didn’t have enough. Also, at the top it says 40 minutes of cooking time, but the recipe says 30. Since i can’t get basic information  I won’t be using this site again.

I've made these several times.  The first time per the recipe. They needed something. The second time I added diced green onions to some of them and cooked crumbled bacon to others and both to still others. Those additions really added a lot of flavor. I've also added some diced green chiles.  Also yummy with a little heat. Lots if combinations  come to mind. Don't know why others had trouble melting the mozzarella. Worked great for me. It helps to bind the macaroni. Not supposed to be creamy. Otherwise they wouldn't be a muffin. Also, they are better after the first day and reheated. The flavors mingle.

Needs way more cheese and definitely sharp cheddar (I used mild, do not recommend) and part-skim mozzarella. It tasted good but would need more cheese and definitely needs garlic and onion powder for sure

I made this recipe as is. And it was super dry! It wasn’t totally bland though. It just tasted like baked Mac and cheese. To keep the noodles from crunching up at the top the second time I made it, I took another reviewers advice and added another cup of cheese and another half cup of milk. If you use crushed ritz crackers rather than bread crumbs on the top you can omit the salt for the crumb topping. Next time I’ll add some garlic and onion powder. The original recipe is just much too dry.

I use this recipe as a base for a ham, broccoli and cheese casserole. I make it just as directed, but it makes food for six instead of 12. Make sure to boil and cook the broccoli for 2 minutes before adding it to the casserole.

Really good. I was worried the "muffins" wouldn't hold shape or would be hard to clean up but it wasn't too bad: letting them cool in the pan for a bit is definitely a good tip. 

The breadcrumb topping was ok but if I make this again I might use a little less and add the seasoning to the egg/butter instead of putting it all in the topping to distribute it a bit better. I might also add a few more spices, like paprika and a bit of garlic powder. 

I substituted half the called for mozzarella for Monterey jack. It definitely made for a richer cheesy taste.

I took a risk and made these along with the corn dog muffin recipe found here. They were for  a gathering of friends to celebrate the Christmas holiday. The eight of us are senior citizens but these mac and cheese muffins received rave reviews from everyone. The only change I was forced to make was at the last minute I found that I did not have the mozzarella cheese that I thought I had. I used the same amount of Mexican blend instead. Fabulous. My grandkids can't wait for me to visit, so I can make them. I sent pictures and they want to have some.

I am looking to make this with some of the mentioned changes.  I am curious if anyone has frozen these and then reheated?  We are traveling for the holidays and hosting an appetizer party.  I would like to have a lot of items prepped and ready to pop in the oven so I can enjoy our guests!!

Made these for a party and they got rave reviews.  So nice to mix the mac and sauce up all in one pot without slaving over a cheese sauce.  We now make our regular mac & cheese this way.  All we do is add a bit of pepper and everyone loves it!

I followed the recipe as written. For me, they were a little bland and dry. I liked the flavor of the bread crumb mixture, but not the texture. My 7 year old agreed, but my picky husband loved them.

I will definitely make this recipe again! I changed the recipe just a little bit. First, I doubled the recipe and I didn't put the mac and cheese into muffin holders, instead I put the mixture onto a 9x13 pan and i t worked just as well. The recipe is a must do again for our family!

It turned out great! I did Doctor mine as well.  Added hamburger meat along with some seasoning to taste.  I added cream cheese and Parmesan cheese and a little bit of Colby in place of mozzarella.  But my boyfriend and I loved them!

After looking through reviews and the recipe, I knew this would be pretty bland. So, I added a teaspoon of Lawry's Garlic Pepper to the main part of the dish and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to the seasoned bread crumbs. That little extra seasoning made this dish AMAZING! I made it for my friend's birthday; everyone wanted to recipe...and seconds! I didn't see anywhere in the recipe how many cupcakes this made but, for me, it made a baker's dozen (13). The last thing I did was, to add cupcake liners in the pan to further amp the cuteness of these Mac and cheese bites!

I love the idea of this recipe but I made this recipe as written and it needs some major tweaks. First, I would get rid of the mozzarella and use another cheese. It is far too stringy and does not melt properly. In addition it is a very mild cheese so it does not add anything flavor-wise. This was my first time using mozzarella in a mac and cheese and will most likely be the last. The next problem is this recipe is very bland. The bread crumb topping had more flavor than the mac and cheese. My family sadly didn't really like these at all.

Made this for a work party. After reading some reviews and having some limitations with a few co-workers I made some changes. I couldn't use normal pasta because of a co-workers allergy, so I used vegetable pasta instead, which worked out fantastic. Also added a bit extra cheese and a tiny bit of old bay with the salt and pepper. Delicious!

This gets a 5 start from me, because my toddler gobbled it all up!!!  I boiled wheat mac, added an extra egg, because it seemed like it wasn't enough while I was stirring the mixture.  I added and diced broccoli florets as well.  Everything mixed and bound well, but I will add more cheese next time.   Delicious!!!

My son and I bake/cook together as quality time. He and I used what was readily available in the house for bread crumbs and that was corn bread stove top stuffing mix.  We used a fork to crush the bread crumbs more finely.  Additionally we used garlic salt w/ parsley and some paprika.  Delectable!!!!! My son and I devoured them! My neighbor and mother said they were Extremely Good! Great quick dish!!!

I made the recipe as it was written, and I have to agree w another persons comment about the mozzarella being so stringy which made it difficult to put in the pan, and it was hard to get completely mixed together before that. Also I love crumb toppings usually but this one just seemed to make a big mess when transferring. Also agree w another persons comment on slightly bland despite sharp cheddar. Now I did make this one day ahead for a work party and maybe wouldn't be so critical if I had tasted fresh out of the oven. I had also made a different recipe which I preferred to this one. Love the presentation.

I loved the ease of this recipe and not having to make a separate cheese sauce. I was concerned about the egg cooking in the hot pasta so I added a little milk to egg along with salt, pepper, onion salt, nutmeg, and dried mustard. I loved that each serving had crispy edges. Hubby liked it very much, too!

Really good! I am and have always been a Mac-n-cheese lover. This is a great way to serve it up for change. I baked it in a silicone muffin pan and did not get the browned sides I was looking forward to but the bottom had the brown, crunch that was really good and the toasty bread crumbs on top were great.

These turned out great, with a few tweaks recommended by other reviewers.  I used 3 cups of sharp cheddar and no mozzarella and added paprika, salt, pepper and dijon mustard to the mixture.  I always use dijon mustard in my regular mac and cheese - it might seem strange, but I think it really makes a difference.  I also sprayed the tops of the muffins with Pam toward the end, because the bread crumbs weren't turning golden brown on top.  The Pam did the trick.  I made regular sized muffins as well as mini muffins (baked for 10 minutes instead of 30).  

The only thing I would do differently next time is not use muffin liners for the large muffins.  They really stuck to the muffins and were hard to get off.  This wasn't as much of a problem with the mini muffins for some reason.

Overall, a fun and tasty party snack!

Great recipe. I substituted the macaroni with quinoa brand elbow macaroni noodles and the bread crumbs with Ian's brand Italian breadcrumbs that are gluten free to make it a celiac friendly recipe. My family didn't even know and loves them.

I didn't care for the topping.  I think it will be better without it.  The mac 'n cheese, however, was very flavorful.

4 stars for the recipe as is, but 5 for the changes I made based off of other suggestions. It's great for my daycare babies!

Very easy and simple and reheatable for people on the go. The last time I made it I made it with brown rice pasta and gluten free bread crumbs for a gluten free take...I also forgot the entire cup of milk by accident and they still came out fine!

Made these for my boyfriend's daughter's 8th birthday party. They were quite tastey. People at the party loved the idea and they went over well. The birthday girl loved them too and she's an extremely picky eater. She basically commanded that I make them again. I'd suggest putting a little extra cheese in them tho. And next time I make them I think I'll make less of bread crumb topping and hold the salt. The topping was a bit strong and alot of people took it off.

Fantastic -- I've tried a few mac n cheese recipes that either (a) was too much work for the end result or (b) simply wasn't better than the oft-detested blue box (but which I love).  This? Still some effort but totally worth it to me!  I used Mexican blend of shredded cheese, then shredded my own mozzarella (effort!), and also added a box of frozen spinach that I zapped in the microwave (but didn't squeeze out -- will change next time).  I didn't add the excess liquid to the muffin cups before baking, since I thought the water was from the spinach; unfortch, the pasta at the cup edges dried out, but everything at the bottom was deliciously soft.  I loved this so much, I ate it all without freezing any for my daughter's lunches (my original intent in making this :D)  Yum!

SO easy and still delicious, but want to make a creamier version.  I added chopped bacon too, delicious.   Best when eaten right out of the oven, I made some in the AM and reheated them at noon for a pot luck at work and they were drier than I liked. But I think they're supposed to be like that, I just want something creamier.  They were still a hit. So fun too!   After baking them, I put them in cupcake liners, great to just grab and put on your plate.   Would be great for kids, super easy and a fun, different way to serve mac and cheese. :)

I made these for my daughter's second birthday party. The adults and the kids loved them. I made 26 of 'em (by doubling the recipe) and was they were the hit of the buffet.

This was an awesome recipe; we did a few modification though: we added garlic power, onion powder, and pepper into the bread crumbs, then we also added two tablespoons of cottage cheese into the mix. made it taste excellent. and just as a side note: I enjoy sugar in my mac and cheese! it's really good, try it sometime!

Awesome!  Although I did tweak the recipe a lot.  For starters, I made my own breadcrumbs by tearing up a piece of bread, tossing it with salt and spices and drying it in the oven on 350 for about 5 minutes.  I also used half the butter and added a tablespoon of chive and onion cream cheese to the noodle mixture and a tad less milk.  I added more salt and pepper and spices (parsley, chili powder, garlic, oregano) to the noodles.  I did not have cheddar so I used whatever cheese I did have.  Colby, pepper jack, seasoned feta and horseradish cheddar slices that I tore up.  I used a tad more than recommended.  SO delicious.  I think next time I might add some corn or pimentos or broccoli to the mix!

This is a great idea.  The recipe needs a little something though.  I made as is the first time and it tasted good.  They reheated very nicely.  The second time around I added more cheese and pepper and left off the topping and they were more to our liking.  I will be making these often for lunches and quick snacks.

Great and easy recipe to make, even with a lot of little helpers fighting to help.  I agree that it is a very basic mac and cheese flavor, but that is easily fixed by adding spices or just changing the type of cheese.  (I am trying it out with smoked gouda next.)  Also, I used crushed buttery crackers on top instead of the bread crumbs.  Delicious!

A big hit with the kids (2 & 5 yrs)!  I made it a bit healthier by using whole wheat pasta & reduced fat cheeses.  I also added some Mrs. Dash & Black pepper.  No leftovers, so next time I'll have to double it so we can have some to freeze for later.

We found these are not that great as is. I think next time I will make a cheese sauce like I usually would for mac n'cheese and then put it in the muffin tins. We made 2 batches of them and added a bit of curry powder to one batch - they tasted great, but would have been neter with a creamier sauce.
