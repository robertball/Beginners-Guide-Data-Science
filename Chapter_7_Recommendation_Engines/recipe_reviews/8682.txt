Simple recipe. Good flavor.  Not exciting though.

My friend has a recipe almost exactly like this, except she uses a box of Uncle Ben's wild rice (cooked according to package directions) in place of the regular rice.  Try that, if you'd like more flavor.  Super good!  :)

My family enjoys this recipe very much. I enjoy the convenience of it. When we have fifty million practices at night, this is a quick meal that everyone enjoys. I use already cooked chicken though and throw it in to make it even faster for me.
