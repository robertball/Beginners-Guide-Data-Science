Thank you for the great recipe!!!  I became one of “those” people who change up the recipe; only because I didn’t have apricot preserves in the cupboard.  I used a ½ jar of “plucot” / pepper sauce.  A plucot is ½ plum ½ apricot.  They turned out great and the family really went wild over them!  I will make them next time using the apricot preserves.

This is something I won't do often just because it is so sweet, but do love the sauce. I'm going to try the sauce on pork loin or chicken because it is so good. When using this with the sweet potatoes, I'm going to cut the sauce in half.
