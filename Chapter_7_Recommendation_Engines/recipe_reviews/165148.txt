Good but not great.  They were neither chocolately nor marshmallowy . . .kind of in-between.  I'm not sure what the point is in adding chocolate to the mix. Why not use cocoa rice krispies and save yourself some work?  I think the next time I want a chocolately rice krispie bar, I will look for a recipe where there are chips inside it or a chocolate coating on top rather than the chocolate being mixed all the way through.
