Great recipe! I substituted applesauce for the apples, just for ease. Don't skip the oil if you use applesauce, they won't bind together properly! Best gluten free waffles I've tried so far!

These were good!  I did not separate the eggs but incorporated the whole eggs into the batter.  I loved having the tiny pieces of apple plus the addition of extra cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg by me.  Almond milk was used since it was was I had.

The batter was made up the night before to help the morning go much easier.  One could probably make up the batter with the egg yolks the previous evening and then whip the egg whites in the morning...but sounds like extra dirty dishes to me!


NOTE:  spelt is NOT wheat-free.  It is an ancient type of wheat but with much less gluten than modern wheat.

These could have been made with less oil, they are greasy!  They are light and fluffy,.  They turn out to be a crispy kind of waffle, which I have not enjoyed for quite a while when using whole grain flours!  Good taste!

Spelt is a type of wheat and contains gluten. It does have a wonderful flavor.

This is a go to recipe for me now...beautiful with the apple and cinnamon (I also add a touch of nutmeg)...I use half the oil and about 2 Tblsp of ground flaxseed...also I usually blend oatmeal and some water to make oaty milk rather than soya for even more deliciousness :) Love that there is no need for sugar!  My favourite way to serve this is with blueberries fresh or thawed frozen and maple syrup...yum!

I used regular milk and applesauce because that's all I had on hand, but the whole family liked it.  I also added a bit of nutmeg and just beat the whole eggs in to save time, so I guess I didn't really follow the recipe to much, but as a base recipe it worked well.

Great recipe  although I switch out the soy and use EVO or avocado oil      I would like to clear up the spelt is wheat confusion    Spelt is a different grain then wheat   Spelt is NOT wheat    spelt is an ancient grain know as farro or dinkel   it goes back to bible times    it is labled on packing as 'contains wheat' because it contains gluten which the FDA has made the decision to label it this way in order to avoid confusion because people with celiacs CANNOT have spelt but wheat sensitive people can because it is WHEAT FREE!    the gluten makes it a great wheat alternative because of its elasticity unfortunately not for the celiacs !  I hope this clears things up  Bless you all!!

I've made these with and without the apple and cinnamon. They are loved by the whole family! I use either extra light olive oil or avocado oil for healthier, but neutral flavor.. Thanks for a terrific recipe.
