Amazing and decadent treat!  Made it with large marshmallows (what I had at the time) and the peanut caramel pooled around the marshmallows giving it a kind of 'rocky road' looking appearance with some of the marshmallows peeking out from the  topping.  Great both ways!

These are so good!  The local cafe has these and I watched someone eat one after another while saying how tasty they were.  Of course they won't give up the recipe, but while searching this site I accidently ran across this!  This recipe is a keeper!

These are the BEST! I never review recipes, but I had to with these. I did not change anything with the ingredients, but did have to bake the marshmallows a little longer. I brought them to a church function and everyone asked for the recipe. These are for sure a keeper!

Great and super easy to make!  A good non-chocolate dessert!  Peanut topping is excellent.  Would maybe try next time with 1/2 cup butter for the topping (versus 2/3) cup.  Not that it would make it health food by doing that, but the extra little bit probably isn't needed.  Might also try 1 egg next time instead of 2 egg yolks.  Will be making again!

These are absolutely fantastic!  I used whole marshmallows and cut them in half with kitchen shears.  I gave these out for Christmas and they were very well received.  Makes a lot, too, which is nice if you're giving these for gifts.  YUMMY!!!

Loved these. Reminded me of a rice kripsie treat but better. Didn't have any corn starch so I used 2 1/2 TBS of flour.  Also used reguar iminitation vanilla.

These are awesome! Made a half recipe in my square pan. My nuts and butter were unsalted so I added a half tsp salt to the melty topping part--gotta have that sweet salty combo. Delicious, can't wait to share these, they are very pretty too!

Very easy to make! Great sweet and salty combination. Loved they chewy combination and crunch! Don't be surprised if the marshmallows bubble under the peanut and cereal layer.

My family enjoyed these.  I love salty/sweet and even though I used salted peanuts I felt the salt level was a little low.  Next time I would sprinkle a little fleur de sal or something.  Otherwise good!

I plan to use PB chips next time, as the store didn't have them, so I used butterscotch instead. 
This is a keeper!

In a word, these are AMAZING. I've made them twice so far, and the recipe is so customizable. The second time, I used chocolate chips instead of peanut butter and honey roasted cashews instead of peanuts — different experience and just as delicious. I LOVE THESE THINGS.

YUM! I followed the recipe but did have to use peanut butter/milk chocolate chip blend because my store was out of just PB chips. I think it would taste better with just the PB chips but everyone loved them anyways.

Excellent !  I changed the recipe a tinge by using butterscotch chips instead of peanut butter chips and I omitted the egg yolks from the crust and the result was a huge hit !

Followed recipe.  YUM!  These are pretty rich and sweet.  Bars can be cut smaller.
