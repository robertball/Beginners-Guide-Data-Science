Since it was what I had in the house, I used a combination of russet and Yukon Gold potatoes.  I followed the recipe but found I needed to add more butter.  Lots more butter.

I peeled and cubed my potatoes for quicker cooing time and easier mashing, other then that I followed the recipe as written and we had very tasty mashed potatoes with dinner.
