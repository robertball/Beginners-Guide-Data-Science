This is a great recipe.  

After reading the recipe, I felt it had too much tomato paste and crushed tomatoes.  So I reduced the tomato paste to one tablespoon and the crushed tomatoes to 3/4 cup.

I blended the spices and checked the aroma.  I felt something was missing so I added between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves a bit at a time.  That improved the aroma and ultimately the taste.  

Everyone loved the chicken tikka masala.  We often visit a local Indian restaurant and they almost always include chicken tikka masala in the buffet.  My husband says the chicken masala I prepared is as good, if not better than, the restaurant version.

I have always thought that mushrooms should be included and the next time I make chicken tikka masala, I'll use mushrooms in addition to the chicken.

Thank you Chef John.

Have made twice and fabulous both times... however I made changes and also simplified the technique. used all spices as stated except cut salt in half and added a dashes of allspice and cloves. used chicken breast instead of thighs. cubed the meat, added the spices, sauteed in coconut oil (used no butter in the recipe). simultaneously I sauteed the onion, garlic, and ginger in coconut oil. once the onions were caramelized added to the chicken. the added a can of tomato paste and a can of coconut milk. no chicken stock was needed, nor was the can of tomatoes. that's it. let it simmer for 20 minutes.

This is better than the popular tikka masala recipe that I've made a few times from this site! I didn't have any ginger or cardamom, so I didn't use it, and I used regular butter, but besides that, I followed everything else correctly. The tomatoes and coconut milk have a great flavor together. The boneless skinless chicken thighs work so well with this. It was quick and not complicated. Also, I somehow made way more sauce than Chef John does in the video, but I'm not complaining about that! One of best meals I've made in a long time. Thanks Chef John.

EDIT:  This was MUCH better as leftovers a day later, with (a LOT of) steamed parsnips added to the bowl.  Maybe the sweetness of the parsnips complemented/counteracted the salty of the spice...  and the coconut no longer seems too coconut-y.  Everything married nicely, with nothing overpowering anything else.  Very yummy.

I've only had Tikka Masala at an Indian restaurant once in my life, so I'm no connoisseur. That said, my reaction to Chef John's interpretation as prepared in my kitchen is, "I don't love it. I don't hate it." What's keeping me from loving it, I think, is the salt. Whoo! Much too much salt for my palate. Other than that, the flavor is pretty good... though it doesn't have that I-don't-know-what I experienced at the Indian restaurant, that sense of "this isn't knocking my socks off, but I really, REALLY would enjoy another bite." Perhaps someone with more experience with Indian (or British?) cooking could identify what might be 'off' with this recipe, or maybe there's nothing 'off' and it's just me...  I don't know. I probably will give this recipe another try, either eliminating or significantly reducing the salt. For me, that'll be a step in the right direction.

Taste is good, but not quite up to restaurant-standard tikka masala (if you want a closer approximation of a good restaurant-style tikka masala, try the Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala recipe, elsewhere on this site). I was mainly interested in this recipe because it's essentially paleo and whole30 compliant, if you don't serve it over rice. It really is good, but it's a really high-maintenance dish that essentially ties you to the stove for an hour. I'm wondering if I can get this to work in a slow-cooker... Possible I'll revisit this and bump it up to a full five stars if it really is significantly better the next day (I'm kinda thinking it will be). Lot of work to put this together, though...

The recipe is delicious!  I made it exactly as written.  It’s going to be added to my regular rotation.  It takes a bit of time but the end product is worth it!  As a note, the spices are a little bit milder than what you would get in a restaurant.  I think that the flavors are good as a stand alone dish without trying to compare it to what I could get in a restaurant.  If you are looking for more of the restaurant-style punch of flavor, you might want to adjust the spices accordingly.

this took a little time to prepare, and we only thought it was ok.  I didn't not have garam masala, so that might have affected it, but I had some spices that are in garam masala and I tried to approximate.  Even with less (volume) of spices, my chicken was absolutely coated with spice, so I don't know what it would have been like if I had had the GM.  Also, we ended up with so much sauce that we had to throw out a lot, even after eating quite a lot of sauce on rice.  probably could have cut the sauce by half to my taste.  Another thing that makes this a not great recipe for me is that you end up with parts of cans leftover, part of a can of chicken broth, part of a can of crushed tomatoes, and if you reduced the sauce also part of a can of coconut milk.  inconvenient and expensive.  although not awful, this won't be a recipe I go back to.

This is a great recipe! Chef John is the best. I never made Indian food before so I was a little nervous,  but this is a keeper.  I made my own garam masala spices since I couldn't find any and will have it for the next time I need it. The only change I made was that I used Greek vanilla yogurt in place of coconut milk. I didn't want to pay $4 for a small can of it. The yogurt gave it a great consistency and that sweet taste that is needed.  Lovely!

Really enjoyed this dish! 

I mixed it all together let simmer just a bit, 
poured into Crock Pot, placed in the refrigerator overnight,
 so that the flavors really had time to blend, an
then cooked on low four hours.

Did not use tomato paste, cardamom, or coriander, came out just fine.

Yummy

We made this dish tonight for dinner.  It was a little time consuming to get made and we omitted the red chili flakes and use only a sprinkle of the cayenne as we don't much care for things to be to spicy.  But oh my goodness it was delicious!  My husband is an anything coconut hater but he said, and I quote "that's on point!"  This dish is absolutely worth the time it takes to make !  We will be adding it to our dinner rotation!

Other than using chicken breast meat cut into cubes and regular unsalted butter, I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be supremely tasty. I could drink the sauce for dessert!

This is a fantastic recipe, I'm not a fan of coconut milk so I substituted with half cream and half plain yogurt.  It also freezes and reheats well so I can make a large batch and divide it up for lunches later.

Pretty authentic Indian dish.  I left out the cayenne pepper & pepper flakes because the kids don't like spicy.  I also left out the tomatoes because husband doesn't like tomatoes.  I cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes & marinated it in the spices for a few hours before cooking it.  I also left out the chicken broth, but added a little cream & plain yogurt to make it creamier.  I also added a splash of lemon juice.  The kids said it tasted just like what we get at the local Indian restaurant.  I served it over jasmine rice.

The taste was close to the one in the Indian restaurant but not quite as good. Still a very good flavor. However it took me 2+ hours to make.  I am sure I am slow at some things but felt I was running the whole two hours. There was a lot to do plus I made the Naan bread also which consumed my time as well. Next time I will cut dice measure everything before I start cooking anything I do think that would make less stress. I will make it again because it was very good.

I liked the choice to use coconut milk in this recipe. The combination of spices was interesting especially the garam masala and turmeric. I didn't have ground cardamon so I substitute a pinch between ground cinnamon and nutmeg. Instead of using crushed tomatoes I used stew tomatoes which was about half of the volume of what the recipe called for. It still came out great and was good with the dark chicken meat. This is a spicy dish so you may want to cut back on a couple of the spices but I like spicy.

Made this with Shrimp instead of chicken for my roommates a few days ago. Also substituted “nomato” sauce for tomato purée... only because one of my roommates cannot have tomatoes (nightshades of any sort). Turned out lovely! Definitely a delicious recipe!

This was very good indeed and I'd make it over and over again.  My husband is the curry lover and he was a happy man.  I served it over Basmati rice.  I didn't have as much chicken as it called for, with just us two ()5 boneless skinless), but I kept most of the ingredients to the same level and I'm glad I did as the sauce was so great on the remaining rice.   Yum!

Chef John, you hit it out of the park on this one. I've been making the "Curry Stand" recipe on here, thought it was pretty good. Wanted to try something different. Your cooking sequence is more logical and straightforward. The taste is great (although I do admit to adding Curry powder and much more cayenne). So good, without the heavy creamy taste in other recipes. And people, don't substitute the ghee. The chicken browns so well in it. Look no further!

I followed the recipe the same as Chef John’s and it turned out very well. Too much for 2 people so we had it a second night.

My wife had never had tikka masala so I made this for her to see what the fuss was all about.  It tasted like the tikka masala I've had in restaurants.  Made the recipe as written with the sole exception of using breast meat instead of dark meat.  It seemed like we had an absolute bucket of sauce for very little chicken, so next time I think I'm going to double the amount of chicken in there so I don't have to drink the leftovers the next day.

This turned out really well!  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I changed was that I used butter instead of Ghee because Ghee was $16.00 for a little container.

This was delicious.  It definitely tasted like chicken tikka masala and I didn't miss the heavy cream.  The coconut milk is a genius substitution.  We had it over brown rice with green beans.  My husband loved it and asked if we can put it into the regular rotation.  Thanks Chef John!  You are a culinary master.

This was as close to tasting like chicken tikka masala as any other chicken dish.  I wouldn't even say it was reminiscent of chicken tikka.  It was pretty good, however, but I think mostly because of Chef John's choice of chicken thighs instead of breasts.

This dish was just ok in my humble opion... I wasn't bad at all, it just wasn't anything to rave over. Normally, any dish Chef John makes he could throw on the floor and I'd still eat it.( Like I know him) But on this dish, I think I would pass.

Very good!! I used chicken breast instead of thighs and I used Grape Seed oil instead of Ghee (because of a severe dairy allergy). And I used Hot Hungarian Paprika instead of the smoked paprika since that's what I had on hand.

I don't think I would change anything  except making a double batch next time so there are more leftovers!

So enjoyed this dish.  Followed recipe to the letter and will add to recipes we love.  Nice touch of heat and deliciously smooth and favorful over rice with roasted broccoli and warm naan.   Definitely a win for our family.

Loved this recipe for Chicken Tikka Masala.  I am not a fan of coconut milk for Indian dishes, so I substituted heavy cream/ water in its place. I also cut back on the smoked paprika, as I was testing a new product and had recently been burned! The flavors are very authentic. I cook Indian food about once a week and this is my new favorite recipe!

As tikka masala goes, this is pretty tasty. Not overly complicated to make and balanced. The gravy consistency was definitely good. The only complaint I have is there wasnt a huge depth of flavor. There is another recipe on here I have made that had my taste buds on a rollercoaster every bite that I missed with this one. But overall I wouldnt turn down another serving of this by any means as written. Another solid recipe by Chef John!

Absolutely delicious! My only note is it could have used more chicken thighs for the amount of sauce. The sauce is amazing and I ate a lot but I would say you could probably double the amount of chicken in this.

Yum! Lots of work but came out great! I used to feel very guilty every time I took my family to an Indian restaurant, because I know that even though the taste is great, the quality of the ingredients is sub par. This recipe came very close to restaurant taste, and my family can enjoy it guilt free!

Yes! and Yes! a bit time-consuming to make but made easier by combining the spices, chopping the onion, and grating the ginger yesterday. Covered the spice mixture in a jar and refrigerated the ginger and onions, covered, until needed today. Assembling the dish went quickly. The only changes I made were to omit the cardamon (didn't have) and the cilantro (tastes like soap to me). I substituted 8 oz tomato sauce for the crushed tomatoes. The chicken was tender and tasted great and the sauce was perfect. Served over brown Basmati rice. A wonderful dinner which I will make often. Thanks so much Chef John. I wish I could make it 4.5

Tikka Masala?? Chef John does it again! What cuisine can’t this guy master?! We have a “Chef John” type around these parts, Daryl Sunderland. Daryl thinks he knows his way around a kitchen, but no dish of his has been farther east of Hamburg(er).
I unfortunately burned my hand fairly badly while cooking the chicken in the butter. Either the butter was too plentiful or the heat was too high. I ended up cooking the rest of the meal on low heat. It ended up taking about 2 hours to cook with prep. Totally worth it though, thanks Chef John!

This recipe was really good! I didn't have coriander so I left that bit out. My opinion was that it was a little too salty and I wish it were a little sweeter but over all super good!

I’m a big fan of Chef John’s and make many of his recipes. This turned out fantastic and I will definitely make again. The only reason I don’t rate five stars is because the sauce was and would have been boring given the recipe above. Thankfully I taste while cooking and wound up adding salt I had reserved from the chicken, another teaspoon of Garam masala, and some other spices I had on my counter from mixing earlier. The chicken itself was amazing, by the way! Definitely give this a try.

I wanted to love this recipe but it just lacked flavor, gusto. I didn't find the authentic 'curry flavor' I thought it would bring.
Appreciated the braising of chicken in seasoning tips.

This is delicious! I actually made it vegan by subbing chick peas and potatoes for the chicken. I also don’t like the flavor of coconut milk in savory foods so I added a pinch or two of baking soda to neturilize the flavor and it worked perfectly. This is one of my favorite recipes!

This was delicious but be forewarned, it is quite spicy. I made several changes due to lack of ingredients on hand. Sub cinnamon for ground cardamom. Used chicken breast cubed in bite size pieces and coated before sautee. For the sauce, substituted sour cream for coconut milk (some recipes I found called for greek yogurt  which I would have used if I had it, but sour cream was all I had) and instead of crushed tomatoes I used jarred Mazzetta plum tomato sauce (which basically just has a little garlic in it). I also used dried ground ginger instead of fresh.  I know... it sounds like a completely different recipe, but really, it was outstanding.  My whole family loved it. Made it with white rice and black beans on the side and will definitely make it again with all the listed ingredients just to compare.

I've made several versions of this over the years. I usually choose to make slow cooker versions. I will not be doing that again as this has been my favorite so far!

This was some of the best chicken tikka masala I have ever had! It was the perfect mixture of sweet with a little bit of kick. I did need to add some cornstarch into the recipe though to thicken up the sauce. Thanks again Chef John for another hit!

I've made this recipe twice and it was delicious both times!  However, it is much better with chicken thighs (as directed) -- I substituted boneless breasts the first time I made it and it was great, but not as amazing as with thighs :)

It is excellent and pretty easy (I don't like taking something out of the pan only to put it back in later.) Coconut milk was a nice alternative to Heavy Cream, but I'm still a bigger fan of Heavy Cream, whenever and wherever.

This recipe is the most delicious thing we eat in our house. I've made it several times, little to no substitutions, except we always make a lot so I have to double everything, and it is always wonderful. Thank you, Chef John, from our family.

This was the best curry I have every eaten! I even screwed up a couple of steps and it still turned out great. I would recommend prepping the chicken coated with all the spices ahead of time. I also added a little yogurt toward the end.

I enjoyed this recipe, and it certainly was much easier than the recipe I usually use (marinating the chicken in tandoori paste and other spices first, then baking it).  Although very close, it didn't quite meet my flavor expectations based on my preferred recipe and many different versions of this dish that I've tried over the years.  I think I will try this again, but next time use the cream instead (the coconut milk made it a bit sweet for my tastes) , more garam masala, and maybe a little less salt.  Also, my package of chicken was larger than what was called for in the recipe (about 3.25 lbs.), but this made a lot of sauce and probably could have handled even more chicken than what I used.

I love Chef John, and I love Chicken Masala, so I was excited to make this.  And it was good.  I made it exactly as written.  But it wasn't *quite* as flavorful as another recipe that I usually use.  This seemed kind of flat, flavor-wise.  Like all the spices blended too much, or the flavor somehow cooked out of it.  Anyway, it was really good, but I'll stick to my other recipe.

I made it almost verbatim to the original recipe but I seasoned the chicken (used breast meat)  and let it sit overnight in the spices. I added mushrooms (cooked separately) and fresh tomato (at the end). I liked it a lot but I think it would be better with maybe some of the spices mixed directly into the sauce and not simply boiled off the chicken. It seemed like there was enough to coat the chicken pieces (I didn’t oil them first) without using all of it on the chicken. But enough spice got into the sauce that it had a good flavor. To be fair, I don’t eat tikka masala much (particularly from a restaurant) so maybe that’s how it’s classically made. Also, marinating the chicken in spices overnight and then thoroughly browning it made it very tender for white meat. I omitted the chicken broth because the coconut milk added enough liquid. I didn’t have red pepper flakes and it definitely had heat - if you make the full recipe with red pepper flakes, it might have quite a bite to it, so be warned. It’s hotter (without the red pepper flakes) than any mix or jarred simmer sauce I’ve tried.

Left out cardamom and red pepper flakes and decreased cayenne to 1/8 or less.

Used the pureed tomatoes as Chef John says. Loved the coconut milk. Might sauté in coconut oil next time but homemade clarified butter is so lovely.

Beautiful cast iron skillet used to fry chicken. Makes such nice brown bits. Transferred beautiful brown bits and butter to nonstick skillet and finished the rest of recipe in that as acidity of tomato and cast iron may not be best mix.

Be sure to carmelize the tomato paste in the butter/oil. Leaving out this step is a flavor faux pau! 

So much better after just a few hours or the next day!

Made as written. Did put a little more tomato paste (just used a can), and subbed cloves for cardamom. The 8 yr old AND the husband asked for it to be added to our normal menu. So wonderful and easy. Was a little time consuming, but not bad. The rice was done in the instant pot by the time dinner was done. Thanks chef John!

I have made this several times. I’ve made it as written and it was very good. I’ve made it with thighs and also with cubed chicken breasts and it works with either. I prefer it with 10 ounces of light whipping cream instead of coconut milk and way less tomato paste. Spices are perfect for my kids who like their Indian  on the mild side.

This is one of my favorite meals. The only thing I do differently is I cut the raw chicken up first THEN coat with oil and spices and fry it. This covers a lot more surface area and makes for bigger flavor per bite. As a side dish sometimes I will make coconut rice w/ currants, cashews and shredded coconut and coconut milk. And if I have time will make some naan. It’s a crowd pleaser too. You can make as spicy or mild as you like. Thanks to Chef John (my cooking hero) for this and many of his recipes.

This recipe will change your life. It goes best with some toasted french bread and olive oil. Don’t forget the cilantro!

this dish was absolutely phenomenal. I absolutely love the blend of spices that come out of it and the rice does a magnificent job of absorbing all the flavor if you made it little too soupy. this recipe will stay in the rotation.

I did a quick easy variation of this using pork roast that has been cooked and Frozen. Used Frozen chopped onion and green pepper about a half a cup total and threw in two diced potatoes scrubbed not peeled. sauteed the vegetables in olive oil to get them soft and then poured in one jar of prepared tikka masala sauce, added one regular can tomato sauce, one can heavy coconut milk and lots of Indian spice and about 2 tablespoons of sugar. I used garlic from the jar in with the onion and potato mixture. used all of the spices above except garam masala, added cinnamon and red curry powder and cardamom along with the above going very lightly on the smoked paprika. Just kept tasting until it was right. This was very good, great way to use leftover meat but must have the jar of sauce to begin with for a good base. sure it's great with chicken, frozen cooked or starting w fresh. some fresh torn thai basil as garnish would be nice in summer

Cut up a whole chicken, used breasts ( cut in 3rds) thighs and legs skinless. 
Cut meat off bones once cooked and put back in the sauce.
Threw the wings, back, and carcass in a shallow pot and make roasted chicken broth.
Tikka turned out great! Easy recipe had everything in the kitchen already. Served on cauliflower rice. Whole 30 compliant. Will go in the regular dinner rotation. Thanks, Chef John! Another easy, great recipe

I made this and like others said, it was salty and missing something. I halved the salt and put in about a 1/2 tsp of ground clove and it was perfect! I love the pieces of tomatoes and onions and the chicken was very moist! I will be making this again and again and again and again! :D

I followed this recipe to a tee, and it turned out delicious.  I made a little basmati rice with coriander seeds which I let cook in a crock pot while I was making this dish, and both items came out almost exactly at the same time.  A little naan, and what a meal!  Many thanks, Chef John for a family-pleasing dinner.

This is the 3rd time I have made this Dish, absolutely fabulous. Today I am grilling the chicken thighs that I marinated the thighs  first along with all the spices for a little extra something. It is smelling Divine.
I will be serving it over Jasmine rice.

Making this AGAIN tonight.   Two grandsons, ages 7 & 9 request this almost every time they are here.   I love any type of Indian food.   Their spice blends are what I truly enjoy.  I’ve tried several off this site.  This is the best, by far.   I follow it to the letter.  Perfection.

Pretty good recipe. I came out with a lot of sauce so if I make this again, I will add potatoes and carrots to it as well! I felt like the chicken came out salty, so I'd add less salt next time.

This is truly delicious.  I forgot to buy an onion at the store so I just added onion powder instead. Everything else was exactly as written.
I'm a little puzzled by other reviewers saying they had too much sauce.  It seemed perfect to me.
I served it over cauliflower rice so that it was lower in carbs.  
I will make this again and again.
Thanks Chef John!

Followed recipe exactly. It was DELICIOUS. I wouldn't change a thing. There were times along the way I was worried about burning the bottom or something, but Chef John's instructions proved true. All was delicious. The tomato amounts perfect. No extra salt needed. The coconut milk sweetened the mixture just perfectly by the end of its low simmer. Wonderful! If you're not getting enough flavour, check that your spices aren't expired :)

Made it how it is minus the cardamom and cilantro (didn't have it) and used regular unsalted butter instead of clarified butter. It turned out great - Definately a keeper

It is really good.  However, it is a bit too salty to my taste.  I will definitely cut back on salt.  I also opt out on chicken broth, I don't think they are needed.

I used chicken breast instead of the thighs to decrease the calories.   Marinated the chicken with all the spices plus 1 cup of greek yogurt.  Served it with farro and naan.

This dish is very good, in its own right - but it is not the tikka masala that I know.
I did not mess with the recipe at all (!). Next time I will try reducing the amount of tomato, cuz it tasted tomato-y, and also use less liquid to make it just a little less runny. Chicken thighs are great in this dish - so why is this dish usually made with breast meat which is dry, at best? (oh yeah, the sauce ...).

I used tilapia instead of chicken for this so I seasoned it and cooked it a bit then set aside.  It was really good on rice.  I've liked every recipe of Chef John's that I've tried.

Wow. I was completely blown away by this! I was afraid it wasn't going to turn out well like my last attempt years ago to make a decent palak paneer. But it was AMAZING! I added 8 oz of mushrooms and sauteed them just to add some extra veggies, next time I'll definitely throw in some fresh spinach, too. I let mine simmer longer, about 30 minutes, to make sure it was "spoon tender". I'm not sure I'll ever be able to top this as a cook, it was just that good!

Awesome!! I think the type of Gram Masala you use makes a big difference. If you have a chance to go to an Indian Supermarket, get you Gram Masala there. Substituted canola oil and butter for ghee. Also used chicken breast as I didn’t have thighs- didn’t matter.

With a few changes, this recipe can give your local Indian restaurant a run for its money. It's a great starting point, but I made a few changes. Instead of coconut milk, I used heavy cream, which I think is important in getting the taste right. Using Indian/Kashmiri red chili powder instead of paprika also helps. I also added a spoon of honey and a sprinkling of fenugreek to the sauce.

To avoid having your nails turn yellow from the turmeric, wear gloves or use tongs when coating the chicken with the spices.

My company thought this was great. I used 2 pds of chicken breast instead of thighs. I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and then drizzled it with oil and spices. I did everything up to the last simmering and put pan in refrig. When my company came, all I had to do was simmer for 15 min and serve. My prep dishes were done and the kitchen clean. Thank you again Chef John for a yummy recipe.

Dude !  How do you come up with these recipes.  OMG. Anything this good should be illegal.  Sure I had to fall back to some modifications based on what was on hand (ro-tel tomatoes and peppers since no diced tomatoes, heavy cream v. Coconut milk) but glad I ordered the Garam Masala on line.   That stuff kicks some serious butt.   I've got to make this for company.

Made this recipe for tonight’s dinner.  We all enjoyed it with a side of lentil & farro which I had a lot of.Changes made: baked chicken thighs, cut up, in a 9x12 casserole, marinated chicken overnight, as I always do-in a generous amt of salt, probably 2 teaspoons, added about 1cup of low fat yogurt (had no coconut milk or cream) about 2hrs before baking. Then used about 1 tablespoon of garam masala on each side,using McCormick’s blend. After baking 1/2 hr, moved chicken around & over & added 1/2 can of crushed tomatoes to which I mixed in about another cup of yogurt. Except for these substitutions, followed Chef John’s recipe, a good intro to Indian cuisine.

Will definitely make this again. As a professional Chef for twenty+ years, I can say that this is a very simple recipe to prepare. Just make it as written, but use FRESH spices. Not 
garbage that has been in your spice collection for longer then you can remember. People complain in their reviews that "it just didn't have much flavour". This will probably always be due too old spices and ingredients. Just buy what you need.

Good, but the family wasn't blown away.  I think we all would have preferred chicken breasts, shredded or chopped smaller, to chicken thighs.  I cut the amount of spices and the amount of sauce in half and still felt I had plenty to go with my package of chicken thighs.  Served over lemon basmati rice.  While this was tasty, I think we may keep looking for our family's *perfect* chicken tikka.

I'd make it again.  It was good and easy to make and my family, who are generally not fond of spicy food liked it.

Made it just as it’s written, very good! Next time I would up the cayenne pepper or maybe add some jalapeño. I think I would like a little more heat, but other than that, it was yummy.

My family and I have started a tradition a few months ago. Every other Sunday we fix a dish that is popular in another part of the world. I have seen several versions of this dish and this one seemed to be more authentic than others. My family has never eaten tikka masala until now and we all thoroughly enjoyed it; enough that I’ve been asked to make it again. I did add extra tomato paste to thicken it but the recipe was “spot on”.  Keep up the good work Chef John!

This is literally the best chicken tikka masala.  I did 1/2 thighs and 1/2 Breast.  Used light coconut milk.  Added a bit more of each spice and added a few ground cloves.  Also added some Thai chillies cuz we love spice. Ate it with white rice and dosai.  My boyfriend is Sri Lankan and super picky and said this is restaurant quality.  Can’t wait to make this again!

I had been looking for a dairy free version of this dish and this was excellent. It’s different than what you may be used to, but really, really good.

Amazing, Chef John! If you can put in the time and effort, this recipe is perfection. You needn’t change a thing. I do let mine continue to simmer for longer in the end, but that’s how my husband and I like it.

I have made this recipe numerous times. My family loves it. A couple tips: 1. Combine the herbs and spices in a mix that you can use repeatedly. It saves a lot of time when preparing the meal. 2. Combine garlic and ginger in food processor. Much easier than grating.

pretty tasty. Made it as is, no changes. Wife really liked it, but she likes things spicier than I do. Next time I will lower the cayenne and red pepper flakes, probably by half. Will make again.

This has a very nice sauce to it. I actually used more ginger than it called for in the recipe because I love ginger. Since I did not have chicken thighs, I used cut up chicken breast. I like vegetables in my curry so I added one chopped  potato, one chopped sweet potato, and a chopped  eggplant. I did not use the tomato paste but I did use a can of tomatoes with extra chicken broth. I will definitely make it again.

Very good recipe. Super simple. Very flavorful. I added more crushed garlic, sweet curry powder, Chinese five spice and some penzeys minced ginger. I also used half the amount of tomato. Came out perfect.

When it was all done I tasted it and 
It had a great flavor profile, but needed more spices.
So i added 1 tsp of each spice to the sauce.
Then it tasted great, just like my favorite restaurant.

Yum! Ate way too much last night thanks to this recipe.  Made three modifications. Omitted the cayenne and red pepper flakes for my spice intolerant children and added a 1/3 cup of cream to get the color I wanted. Ate four servings and the leftovers for lunch today. Yum. Microplace zester is great for the ginger and garlic.

It was great!   Used breasts that I chunked before step 1. It was perfect.  Had no cardamom.  Added fish sauce towards the end. Served with saffron rice and braised collard greens.  Yum. Little bit of a kick but so yummy.

Fabulous! Super easy to make and totally authentic. I diced the chicken before seasoning and sautéing it. Much easier. Also used regular butter and evoo as I didn’t have ghee. Making it again this weekend for guests. Totally recommend this recipe. Very flavorful.

This was my first attempt at cooking Indian food at home and I was quite surprised how great it turned out.  Hubby loved it too and had several servings.  I made a couple minor modifications to cut down on fat and based on other suggestions - plain yogurt instead of coconut milk or cream and didn't use the vegetable oil on the chicken before putting them in the spice mixture.  I also didn't clarify the butter for the chicken.  Using chicken thighs really added depth and flavor to the end-result.  I will definitely make this again.

My family and I really enjoyed this dish. I will definitely make this again!!! This dish is perfect for Whole 30 and Paleo without the rice, of course.

This was fantastic! next time I'll ads a tsp of cinnamon and a bit less chili powder, it was a tiny bit too spicy for my family.

I made this recipe but like everyone else, I had to make some adjustments. Instead of crushed tomatoes & tomato paste I used stewed tomatoes. My family eats seafood more than chicken so I also substituted the chicken for shrimp. Added naan bread and basmati rice. It was amazing!

This is really good!  I left out the Cilantro.  I wonder if the end result is just as good if you bake the chicken.  I"ll have to try it.   Great flavor, and oh so delicious!  Definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe. The only thing Do differently is add an additional pound of thighs and use ginger powder instead of fresh ginger if I don't have any on hand.  Kids love it if  I leave the red pepper flakes out. Serve with Nan or rice.

I loved how well the flavours were developed in this recipe. I used chicken breasts because I did not have thighson hand, so I brined them first to give them more flavour and moisture, and then subsequently forgot to omit the salt in the recipe. Not smart, but the dish was still delicious.

Amazing recipe! Do not deviate from Chef John's ingredients and spices (how is it that so many amateur chefs think they can out do his recipes?). The spice mixture is phenomenal and the use of coconut milk in place of heavy cream to obtain a slight sweetness contrast is genius. Thank you Chef John.

This tikka masala was so good. I made it with a combination of diced thighs and breasts and made it two days ahead of time since many reviews said it was even better the next day. I simmered the chicken for about 45 minutes, then cooled and stuck it in the fridge. My husband was very happy, reminded us of our favorite Indian restaurant. I served it with green beans, basmati rice and naan to soak up the extra sauce.

Great recipe. I tried to make it a little lighter by altering the recipe slightly. I used low salt and no salt added broth, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. I also used light coconut milk. I only used 1tbsp of ghee and honestly, I didn't need more than that. I also halved the amount of salt and didn't miss the other half. 

Added thyme and cloves. Delicious meal and I'll definitely make it again.

chef john, I'm your biggest fan and many of your recipes have become regulars in my week. but please consider reworking this recipe. I have made this twice exactly as written (thought I must have messed up somehow the first time) and this is simply BLAND. and Indian food especially should *never* ever be bland. the beautiful spices on the chicken aren't enough to flavour all that tomato/coconut milk based sauce. the result is unpleasant to eat.

5 stars for flavor, although the flavor is different from the restaurant tikka Masala I’m used to.  My husband doesn’t like coconut milk so I used half Greek yogurt and half cream.  The other thing I did differently was to use the instant pot. after browning the chicken and sautéing the onions, tomato paste and garlic/ginger I set it for 8 minutes on high. I added the yogurt and cream after that.  It is a time consuming recipe from prep to finish, but just drink a glass of wine or two while you work and it’ll be done in no time!

My changes:  Chicken breast, no cilantro, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes.

If you are unsure about trying an Indian dish, this one will not disappoint. Cook the chicken in the pan for 5 minutes and complete the cooking in the sauce and it will be tender and moist.

Great flavors. Never made something like this before and this was easy to follow. I did double the spices bc we like spicy food but the spice mix was excellent. For garam masala I followed the "easy garam masala" recipe on this site.

Used 2 lbs of chicken breast cubed to lower fat content and skipped the stock because it didn't need the extra liquid. Added sliced red pepper for a little crunch but otherwise followed the rest of the recipe as is and it was DELISH!  New family favorite. Thank you!

This dish is a very different take on Tikka masala and I did not like it at all. There is far too much tomato flavor in it; you can even tell from the title picture, instead of the dull orange ish tan color of normal tikka masala it is quite red. The consistency was lacking as well. I much prefer the heavy cream to coconut milk version of Tikka masala I now know. 

If you want a recipe that tastes like the restaurant this is not it.

Excellent!  I'm new to cooking Indian food.  This recipe was spectacular.  I added diced eggplant to the dish (added it with the chicken) and it was great.  Even my 12 year old nephew loved it and he only eats a few things.  This will be a regular at our house now.  Thanks, John, for another winning recipe!  I've come to trust them all.

Exceptional!  I made a few changes.  I didn't use crushed tomatoes, added extra chicken stock instead. I also added a couple of pinches of fenugreek seed into the spice mix.  In the last five minutes I added a generous portion of frozen peas.  The flavor of the peas was perfect for the sauce.

Increased the servings but followed as precise as I could, all I can say is omg! That was as good if not better than some of the Indian places near me, the only chance of making it better would be if I had a tandoor.  Might try some cashews and currents next time,Jay, S.S.Day Camp, class of "89"

DON'T SKIP THE GHEE! The first handful of times I made this I skipped the ghee and used regular butter and/or oil because I was being lazy. The recipe was still delish, but once I figured out how to make my own ghee and started using it in this recipe....I mean, oh my gosh, it gives the dish an exquisite flavor that regular butter or oil cannot give. It's actually not hard to make your own ghee, is totally worth the extra time and you can store any left over ghee for up to a month to use in other dishes.

Excellent. The only things I did different was to use boneless chicken breasts cut into bite sized pieces before coating them with the spices, and to use coffee cream instead of coconut milk.  Delicious.

Very good recipe though we found it a little salty for our liking. I will adjust that next time.  I did use chicken breasts rather than thighs.  Overall a hit with our family.

This is a very good recipe and will go in to my repeat list.  I found it a bit salty.  Next time I'll use a low sodium chicken broth and cut back a tad bit on the kosher salt.  I did put in about 2x the recommended cayenne which gave it a nice kick.

Made one batch with chicken and the other with tofu, and used a little extra coconut milk and left out the chicken broth to make it easier to deal with my meat eating and vegetarian family members. Went over well with everyone. treated the tofu the same as the chicken- dusted squares with the seasoning mixture and then sauteed in oil.

This was delicious!  Even my 4 year old picky eater gobbled it up!  Modifications (because I have a 4-year old) were that if a spice was a part of the garam masala mix of spices, I didn't add the additional teaspoons.  So my only spices: garam masala, 1/2 the amount of salt (1 tsp), paprika, turmeric, and cayenne.  Everything else was the same.  

Made the mistake of leaving final product on low about 20 - 30 minutes longer than it calls for because I ran out of the house to pick up said 4-year old and thought I was turning the burner off when I only turned off the timer.  I was REALLY nervous re: a burnt taste or overcooked chicken.  Still delicious.

Thanks Chef John!

Great recipe! The only reason I knocked off 1 star was because it wasn't quite spicy enough. Next time I'll build the heat up by including some chili flakes in the chicken marinade.

This is one of my favorite recipes! Thank you. The only changes I made was to omit the salt (cause I don't add salt to anything), and I substituted coconut milk for the heavy cream, based on the Chef's comments.  The coconut milk complimented the spices in the dish and added great flavour  with healthier fat  than the heavy cream. Thanks for this excellent recipe!

I make this vegetarian with a batch of chopped seitan instead of chicken. It is absolutely fabulous! Works equally well with a can of diced tomatoes instead of crushed.

I have never had Chicken Tikka before and I thought this was a wonderfully balanced, delicious, and easy to prepare dish. I did make a couple of changes. First of all, I had chicken thighs on bone and I kept them that way. I would not do that again - cut into chunks. Also, I did not have coconut milk, but did have almond milk - it did work well. Lastly I used a 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes - I knew they would go to waste if I didn't use the whole can. I used a masher and mashed the tomatoes quite easily into a crushed state. Will be making again!

Phenomenal recipe, just make sure you time it right. I was a few seconds off on the onions and they wound up burnt. If not for chef's error the meal itself would've gotten 5 stars, but the recipe certainly earns 5.

This was exactly the taste I was looking for!!!  I used the cream instead of coconut milk and added more ginger.  This dish is great when made and over the top great the next day.  I made it with chicken breast, but will use thighs next time.

All curries -- at least, all well-constructed curries -- taste better the second (and especially the third) day after making. This applies to other stews and chili, too.

This truism aside, I'm impressed; this tasted great straight out of my cast-iron frying pan.

Where I differed from the recipe as provided:

I reduced the salt by half. I added quartered baby potatoes. I didn't bother with the chicken stock. I used a full can of cubed tomatoes 'cause I can't think of what to do with a partial can thereafter. 

Curry aficionados will tell you that ginger and garlic are key to any curry. Do yourself and your family a favour: Buy organic ginger and garlic sourced from pretty much anywhere other than China; bodies don't benefit from lead, cadmium and other heavy metals (https://www.sccgov.org/sites/da/newsroom/newsreleases/Pages/NRA2016/Mondelezlawsuit.aspx).

The changes I made . . . salt reduction and potato addition, basically . . . will only affect the perceived salinity of the meal. Chicken stock (which I left out) would only improve what I'm raving about. This is a solid curry, and I confidently recommend it.

Oh my goodness....this was SO good. I had to make some minor changes, due to both allergies and personal reasons. Instead of chicken thighs, I just used 2 large chicken breasts. Way easier. Also, no ghee....used coconut oil instead (due to a dairy allergy). I also added some red peppers to the sauce and omitted the red pepper flakes (toddler doesn't like spice). Also added some leftover roasted cauliflower. Otherwise, this dish was absolutely delicious!!! Cannot wait to make it again!

I followed the recipe as it was written. I used butter instead of ghee because a jar of ghee was 7$ and I left out cardamom because I couldn't find it. Everything was so yummy and I would make it again. I made couscous to go along with it and that just added more flavor to the dish.  And like everyone else said, this taste better the 2nd day.

Followed the recipe exactly except that I substituted 6.8 oz of cream of coconut for some of the coconut milk.  Wonderful recipe.

This was the second Indian dish that I've tried from this site.  The chicken korma I made was bland but this was perfect! I ground up fresh cumin and cardamom, which I think made a huge difference.  I will definitely be making this again. FYI since then I purchased Saffron Road brand tikka masala and this tastes very similar, but better because it had more heat.

Correction:  I took a second look and realized that the recipe I made was not Chef John’s. I had been considering his and in a senior moment thought it was the one I had chosen.  Since I did not make it I am deleting my comments.  I don’t feel bad about the five stars because I know his dishes are always worth 5 stars.

I'm not sure what I thought of this.  It was okay...but maybe I did something wrong.  It seemed to be missing something.  I do think that I'll make it again and will have everything already prepped before I begin.  I couldn't cook the onion or tomato paste even close to 5 minutes each; the spices remaining from the chicken burned black long before that.  I will try much more butter (or oil) and much lower heat next time.  As other's have said, this was much better the next day.

We found this recipe to be both easier to prepare and tastier than some of the alternative popular recipes.  Using the spices as a rub worked very well, as the flavor made its way both into the chicken and back into the sauce.  Salt content and heat were very manageable as listed in the recipe.

People who do not want to use more expensive coconut milk can substitute regular milk in the same volume.  Likewise, tomato paste is great, but a little more tomato sauce works just as well.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I make it pretty regularly! It's seriously the only recipe on this site that I do not alter in any way...well except for using a lot more ghee because I am a butter junky. This is restaurant quality eating here. I took it to an Indian fella at work and he said the spices are spot on.

Loved this!!!   I made edits, just based on what I had and ease.  I cut the recipe in half using the allrecipes function.  I only did this since we were not going to be around to eat leftovers.  It was so good, that if I were home, I would've doubled it! 

I ran out of turmeric, so didn't add.  I added a dash of clove and allspice to the spice mixture.  I put the chicken breast in a ziploc with all the spices and threw in the fridge.  I did this in the morning, so it would be easy to get dinner ready after work.  I sauteed the onion, garlic and ginger and then added the chicken breast, which I cut into strips.  I should've cut the strips prior to adding the spice mix.    I  then sauteed the chicken a bit before pouring in the can of coconut milk and about 2T of tomato paste.  I had cut the recipe in 1/2, except for this, which I'm glad I did it this way.  I didn't need chicken broth and didn't need to cook the chicken separately.  I also didn't bother adding crushed tomatoes.  I know I changed this a bit but I don't think my changes were too different from the original recipe, more my chosen way to cook.  I also served with cauliflower rice, which Trader Joe's now has in their frozen section!!  Score!  We loved this meal!

Amazing! Awesome! My guests raved over this dish more than all the other dishes I have ever, ever served,  we have dinner parties at least twice a week. Only be careful with the salt,  it came out a little too salty for me, however none of my guests complained.

Thanks, Chef John for another great recipe!  I made this last night for dinner, and loved it.  Based on other reviews, I decreased the salt to 1 tsp, and added 1/4 tsp allspice and cloves.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Prep time was easy - little chopping and dicing to do.  Cook time took longer than I had anticipated, but was well worth it.  And, it created very few dishes for clean-up!  I'll definitely be making this again, with no other modifications.

My son and husband (who doesn't like Indian food typically) are fighting over who gets the leftovers!  I made saffron rice with it, and it soaks up that sauce wonderfully!!!  I didn't use the red pepper flakes because I wasn't sure about how spicy it would be.  We will be having this again for sure!

This was stellar.  My husband and I both felt it was better than what we've eaten in restaurants. I didn't have cardamom and when I looked at the price of it in the store, decided to omit it, but no one seemed to care. I loved the coconut milk, and did add a little additional spice at the end for heat. Served with home made naan bread, steamed rice, and fresh IPA beer. We were all very happy.

We loved it! I think it is a bit too tomatoey as written, so I'll cut back some next time. I added the spice mixture to diced chicken and allowed it to marinate for a few hours to deepen the flavor. Now, I think I need to invest in a spice grinder!

I didn't have enough thighs, so i also used legs and breasts. It turned out wonderfully. My usually non-adventurous wife insists i make this again every couple weeks. For her sake, I left out the cayenne pepper but it still had just enough bite.

Amazingly good! I accidentally used diced tomatoes instead of crushed and it worked out great. Also skipped the red pepper flakes only used a pinch of cayenne and skipped coating the chicken in oil before the spices. Definitely going to be making this again in the future.

I did everything that the recipe called for, except the salt.  I reduced the salt and the dish was perfect!  My whole family loved it, especially now that it's winter.  Great to eat with rice on a cold windy day.  Thank you Chef John, for posting this recipe.  It's a keeper.

I cook a lot of Indian food, being Indian. I follow recipes to the T unless I see a blatant and obvious error. I made this today, and I have to say. Once of the best Chicken Tikka Masala I have ever eaten. Perfect. I just added some red chili powder in addition to the paprika as I like mine spicy.
Impressive...Chef John.

Very good recipe. Didn't put in tomatoes and chicken stock but kept tomato paste . Enough sauce without those items. Everyone in the house enjoyed it. Served over coconut rice. YUM

I boiled the chicken, chopped and added in after simmering the sauce. Love this! Tastes just like something I'd get at a restaurant!

I made it exactly as stated. This was the most delicious Chicken Tikka we've had.  The flavour was awesome.  Next time I make this I'll double the recipe  and freeze some for another day.

Very good.  Nice and spicy,  not overly spicy.  The man was not thrilled when I told him what was for dinner, but really enjoyed it and asked that I make it again.  That is a raved review!

I prepared this dish according to the recipe and it turned out wonderfully.  I made no changes and it was just as I expected.  This was my first chicken curry and it was fun to make.  I will prepare many times in the future.

I made this dish tonight for my husband and myself.  The smell was amazing!!  The only criticism I have was it was wayyyy too salty.  I'm not sure why, but maybe the canned tomatoes had enough salt without adding the extra to the spice mix.  I will definitely make this again, just leaving out the extra salt next time!

My youngest requests (demands) this each visit home from college. Luckily Wegmans has Naan bread in a family pack which is the perfect side to slop up the sauce. I absolutely love boneless chicken thighs and this recipe has so many wonderful flavors. Keep the recipes coming Chef John!

I followed the exact recipe just leaving out the crushed tomatoes. It turned out great,  I will continue making it. I paired it with Okra and curried cauliflower a delicious low calorie low carb meal.

This is the nicest curry I have ever managed to make.  The whole family loves it and it has become one of our regular meals.  I must admit I didn't have all the ingrédients (cilanto or Pepper flakes) but it was delicious anyway!  Thank you!

Made it exactly per the recipe.  Didn't need additional salt. Like Chef John, served myself a double serving.  Just enough heat as not overwhelm others in my family.  This was a hit.

This recipe turned out great. As per one review, I added about 1/2 to 3/4 tsp. of ground cloves.
I didn’t use tomato paste at all or crushed tomatoes. I had canned tomato sauce on hand so I used about 1+ cup of that. Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe. Husband loved it, too.

I've been wanting to try Indian food so I thought I'd make some. Not exactly sure what tikka masala is supposed to taste like but this dish was good! I will make it again.
