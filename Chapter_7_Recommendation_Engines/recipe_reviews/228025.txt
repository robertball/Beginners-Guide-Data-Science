I used two tablespoons pecans instead of walnuts and almonds because that was what I had on hand. I refrigerated this overnight to have for breakfast this morning. I did sprinkle a little cinnamon over the top before eating. This is delicious! I loved the crisp Granny Smith in this overnight oatmeal--VERY good.

Very good... I have this frequently in Europe and it is intended to be soft, not 'crunchy' like granola.  Skip the brown sugar, it is not needed.  I recommend using Greek yogurt instead of the fat free, and let it sit overnight instead of just an hour.  Also, using a ripe banana is better flavor-wise.  At serving time mix in a bit more yogurt (1/4 cup or so per serving) and some raspberries or blueberries.

The traditional Swiss Bircher Muesli is made with grated apples-though there are million variations one can do with it, I have never seen it in Switzerland with chopped apples :) I make mine with milk and yogurt, and any fresh, in season, or even frozen fruit... one time with strawberries one time with blackberries or even blueberries, and I don't do all the nuts and misc. stuff (though I am sure that's tasty too). The gist of it is grated apples, oats and enough milk or yogurt to let it become softened, if you want it less mushy, add less milk, then add in whatever fruit and whatever sweetener you want (I use stevia).

The sweeteners aren't needed, the fruit makes this sweet enough!  I used fresh coconut for part of the nuts in the recipe.  Great breakfast!

Delicious. I make this on Sunday and have breakfast for the week. I like to add a generous splash of milk each morning and stir that in to get my desired consistency.

I am lost on this recipe! I thought that Muesli was like a dry cereal that milk was added to. Well, I decided to try this anyhow, with the milk and yogurt added and let it sit. That idea, just did not work. It was like oatmeal mush. The texture is just so off, being creamy and mushy. The appearance at first glance looks like tuna salad with apples and raisins. Maybe, more directions were needed here. It is possible that the milk and yogurt were supposed to be added as cereal or a parfait, and there is a misprint. It sounded good and both healthy anyway. It was unfortunately, unsalvageable though.

Wonderful!  I just made a batch of granola and mixed about a half cup of it with the oatmeal. That made it EASY!  I just needed to add the liquids and fruit.  The fruit fared well in the fridge overnight and was delicious in the morning!  
I substituted almond milk/yogurt.
I first discovered this on a buffet at a hotel and fell in love instantly.  Never thought I could just make it.  Thanks for the recipe.
Making it outright I would probably only add honey if any sweetner at all...and some cinnamon.  The granola had all that already.  

Baker Bee - this is Bircher Muesli -- or soaked.  You are correct on your description.  It is supposed to look like that.  This recipe is not misprinted.

Just made this and used organic whole oats (others are gmo's) greek 2% yogurt (cause that's what I have) agave syrup (healthy spoonful) currants instead of raisins, and instead of brown sugar another healthy spoonful of real maple syrup.  Used 1% milk and in hindsight should have tried almond milk, which I have more of ... now have just enough for a cup of tea in the morning! while I sink my teeth into this delightful looking dish!  if I remember, I'll be back to give my two cents on the tastes! (edit* just threw in some flax seed, cause they were sitting here staring at me)
It's now morning....drinking a big cupof hot tea and this is fabulous! the flax adds a little je ne sais quoi ?  yummmm   will be making this a regular!

This is not your typical dry Muesli. If that is what you are looking for, move on. This is an amazing breakfast recipe for those craving something different. I was craving something a little different than your typical oatmeal. this is a great creamy variety. I like it slightly modified: No banana, use golden raisins, 1/4 C plain greek yogurt, 1 cup OJ.

This is a great baseline recipe.  I use the regular oatmeal (not quick) but some brands are thicker than others; I like a thinner cut for this.  I tried it with Greek yogurt, but found it was too thick.  I don't use the honey or the brown sugar.  My favorite combination so far is diced pear and cranberries or dried cherries.  It's a healthy, hearty, make-ahead breakfast, and it's gluten free.

I shredded the apple, and used a vanilla yoghurt instead of  plain, which gave enough sweetness that I could leave out the other sweetening ingredients.  I have made this a few times, and will sometimes throw in whatever fruit I have around, like nectarines, for a little bit of a different flavour.  I have found that sometimes a little dash of salt can make a big improvement in flavour for this dish.

This is delicious, and easy to make. I blitzed the apples in my food processor because I wanted teeny pieces. I also halved the honey and brown sugar because I like things less sweet. Will make again!

Lots of potential, but it needed cinnamon or vanilla or something extra to give it some more flavor.  Just too bland.

I like to mix it up without bananas, but add them, along with some fresh berries or peaches, freshly each morning...I agree that it needs no extra sweeteners, the fruits do the trick! I first ate this dish on a morning after camping, we went to this little bakery and they were out of everything except birker muesli...which none of us had ever heard of,we were dubious....but EVER SO GLAD that we tried it! One of my most memorable breakfasts ever!

Delicious and good for you!  I made as suggested - hubby is swiss and this is the real deal!  I love to eat it every day - I do add the banana in while eating it as I don't care for mushy banana.

Just made this and oh my it's so good. I can't wait to taste how it will taste after a night in the fridge. I replaced the milk with Nutty Bruce Almond Coconut milk and used Greek yogurt opposed to no fat yogurt.I also added a tiny bit of cinnamon because this is how I remember it tasted for. The last time I have had it.

So delicious 
I just used honey and found I didn’t need the brown sugar .. 
and had no orange juice so just used extra milk and Greek yoghurt. 
Perfect!

I did not use honey, OJ,  or brown sugar. Instead, I used a cinnamon and stevia mixture I keep on hand.  I used only about half of the milk because I like my oatmeal with a little toothiness to it, not mushy. You can always add more milk in the morning if the oatmeal is not liquid enough for you. I also added pumpkin seeds and Craisins. I agree with another rater that grated apples are a must. That was easy to do in my Cuisinart. This was delicious. Next time I will try making it with fat free Half and Half to take this dish to the next level.

I did follow recipe and thought it turned out pretty  good.
The next day I found the same recipe online and instructions
we're different,  Yogurt and apple were adding the next morning to oats mixture that chilled overnight.  This is
Also the way I remember a friend making Swiss oatmeal.
Will follow instructions for the other Swiss oatmeal recipe next time.

This is fabulous.  I used coconut yogurt and omitted the banana.  Husband and I had it all week for breakfast.

My husband and I love this! I've made it quite a few times. It's yummy, easy, and I can prepare it in advance! I also like to expirement with it by putting in different fruits and spices.

I substituted 1 1/4 cup frozen blueberries for the banana and raisins and 2 tablespoons of maple syrup for the orange juice, honey and brown sugar.

We eat this regularly in our house.

I have made this a few times now and really enjoy it.  I am always out of bananas, so never added that into the mixture, put together as directed otherwise. It is a versatile recipe and yummy too!
