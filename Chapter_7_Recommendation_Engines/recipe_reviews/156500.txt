I have stuffed this bread with a lot of things, like chicken Parmesan,  hardboiled eggs cheese and ham, italian sausage peppers and onions as well as many other combinations. Use your imagination and just have some fun. It is fun for me to see a new persons expression when they bite into a surprise! That is why I cook.

I loved these!!!! I used the canned unfrozen biscuit dough and seemed two together. Don't put too much meat in.

This was really good. I used sliced pickles and onions, just like a regular cheeseburger, instead of minced. I also used puff pastry which was perfect. You've got a winner with this one!

This is delicious, but Pizza or French bread dough found in the dairy section would be quicker than the frozen dough.

Oh my gosh I made this for my family the other night and they loved it!! It was so tasty. Made extra and put one in for hubby's lunch the next day and it even tasted good cold. Even my 5 and 8 year olds ate all their food!! Well done and thank you! Nadey Babes, South Africa.

What a hoot this is! We loved it and it was great the next day too.  Very clever idea!  I think I'll try forming the meat into "fingers" and wrap them in dough for Halloween as Witch's fingers.  Thanks for sharing!

These were great. My grandson loved them. I have made this with hot dog baked into the bread. I just cut the top off and fill with condiments that you want. You do not have to cook the hot dog before baking.

Good stuff... A nice twist on a local tradition: Fleischkuekle. There are dozens of family type restaurants in ND that make these from scratch. All good. Especially in the winter here in North Dakota!

These were pretty good. They're no different from making regular hamburgers (except for the second slice of cheese).  These were a hit with my whole family.  The only thing I did differently was to cut the recipe in half, and I made 6 small patties.

Great idea, but I think that the patties could be smaller, such as 1/4 or 1/3 pounds each. 1/2 pounders are too big for most appetites. If you can eat a half pound of meat, you can always put two of them on your plate while others have one.

Good recipe. Calories are off the chart because you're not supposed to eat a half a pound of hamburger in one serving! Just half the amount per person and use light or low fat American cheese. That will significantly drop the calories!

These were awesome! Kids and adults all loved them..but VERY filling. I could only manage to eat half. I used rolled out buttermilk biscuits and cheddar cheese. I cooked the onions before mixing them in the burgers as well. And no oil was needed..the ground beef had plenty I needed to drain out when pan cooking them. Thanks for the idea!! I'm keeping this one in our dinner rotation!

Very good recipe with good instructions.  I did not have any frozen dough so I made some regular bread dough in my bread machine and took it out after it had risen.  I might flavor the mixture more to our tastes next time but all my 3 kids and husband loved it!

These were amazing!  Everyone in the family enjoyed them.  They were quite large, so next time I will likely make smaller patties.  I didn't have time to thaw my bread dough, so I used refrigerated pizza dough from a tube.  It turned out well.  I had extra patties, so I froze them and we reheated them later and ate as burgers.  They have a great combo of flavors all in the one patty.  This is a keeper.

We thought this was great. We loved the meat mixture and plan to use it for when we make regular cheese burgers. We used a generic bread dough (we had that on hand) and it was a pain in the butt to get it stretched out. We plan to use a better quality dough next time or something the other reviews suggested. We cut the recipe in half and it was still plenty of meat for the 4 of us. I actually think making it with 2 pounds might be a bit much.

Really good.  Had some issues with the dough but in the end it wasn't a problem.  Followed directions to a T but next time will omit the pickles, mayo and ketchup and add other ingredients my family enjoys more.  Can't wait to make them again.

very yummy:) I do agree that its not a diet conscious recipe but hey they can't all be! LOL My hubby and kids like these, that's all that really matters. We won't be eating them every day or even every week but I will be making them again.

Good twist for one of our favorites. We use the frozen bread dough for stuffed pizza, reubens pork bbq - just about everything, but had never done the individual sizes. Thanks!

Loved the chopped up pickles in the hamburger mixture and I don't even like pickles.  These hamburgers are huge and could easily be made into 8 cheeseburgers.  My oven needed about half the bake time cited.

Absolutely wonderful taste.  I split the the patties and made 8 1/4pound burgers. Half pound burgers were a bit big for my housemates and I.  If you decide to do that you will need 2 pounds of the bread dough to cover everything well, and double the amount of cheese.  I do have to say that it takes a fair amount of time to make them though.  This is defentaly a recipe for when you know your going to get off of work early or better yet a weekend when you know your going to do some entertaining.

These were fun for a "surprise" theme party. I used crescent roll dough. The next time I bring them to a party, I will probably make them smaller so they're bite-size

I followed the recipe, but I kept the hamburger crumbled and just spooned it onto the bread. Definitely will make this again! You can put *anything* in this burger! Very customizable, I will add more cheese next time for sure.

Love these growing up in the midwest the "hidden cheeseburger" is a fast food staple. We call them Runzas. I have never thought of learning to make them until I saw this recipe. THANKS for dinner!

almost like a hamburger calzone!  very good but a pound of hamburger makes 2 HUGE burgers. I think I'd make 3 or 4 with a pound next time. I'm gonna try some red hot in it next time also.

This recipe tasted good.  I would cut down on the amount of meat that is used.  It is also not so special that it makes it worth the effort.  Overall good though

Thank you so much for this recipe.  We have been talking about this burger for sometime.  Our school used to serve this burger when we were little.  It was then called the Secret Burger Day... Yummy... My children and husband are going to be so excited!

This was so good!  I used 1 1/2 lbs. ground venison and an egg in place of the ground beef.  I also used the canned french bread dough.  The entire family loved it!

Hi, guys! I tried this recipe last night! Hokey smokes, Bullwinkle! I've made beef wellington a coupla times, but hadn't ever thought of enclosing ground beef in bread dough! These were delicious!! I made the recipe exactly as written, making only one change. I made a small white bread dough in my bread machine, but that was it! Even my new daughter-in-law, who is the world's PICKIEST (She drives my son nuts!) eater, loved these! We all did! They're kinda like fun-food! Two thumbs up on this one!  Thanx, Gregg

Made these with a home made roll receipe for the bread. Turned out great. I made them mini though since I'm not a huge fan of the fat cheese burgers.

I tried your recipe. The patties didnt hold up and broke when turned over. The frozen bread dough was horrible to roll out.  The others in my family did eat it. But for next time am going to follow the reviews by others. I do thank you for sharing this recipe :)

I was skeptical before making this recipe but was pleasantly surprised.  I only used 1 lb. ground beef (which seemed to be plenty) and used cheddar cheese slices instead of American.   Next time I make, I will slit them open after they have finished baking and add sliced tomato and lettuce.

I really liked these. Nest time I make them I think I would make my patties half the size because the amount of meat was kind of overwhelming. Also the calories for this recipe are through the roof. It is considerably less if you use extra lean ground beef and light other ingredients. The taste is very good but it's hard to justify all the calories!

I made these with a hamburger mix and sliced cooked sausage - both were very good. I do have a question - my buns did not raise much on the bottom because of the weight of the meat.

Excellent!  The only thing I changed was the garlic...we added more because we love it.  Next time I will probably add mushrooms too.  It was so easy to make and it tasted even better!  Had the next day for leftovers and it was still good!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was wonderful, I used suggestions of other reviewers, like using refrigerated pizza dough.  I laid it out and sliced it into about 9 squares.  This recipe gave me so many ideas.  One that I did was with taco meat and rotel tomotoes.  So many possiblities to use this for.  Thanks Vince317, my kids thank you too!

My family and I love this!  It's great the next day too.  I use Pillsbury Simply french bread dough and it turns out great.  To cut down on the fat I leave out the mayo, use turkey burger, and cook the burgers on the foreman grill, instead of frying, prior to baking in the dough.  I bake at 350 for 23-28 minutes.

The meat patties did not stay in patty form as they were frying, so I just piled the loose cooked beef in the middle of the dough and pulled up the edges (like an empanada). It still worked great! VERY tasty!

Huge hit in my family! I also used Pillsbury biscuits, worked well. Next time I need to make patties a little flatter and cook a little less! 
Will definitely make again!!

I tried this for the first time the other night.  I thought overall, it's a very good and fun twist on a cheeseburger.  The only downfall I thought is it was it could've used more taste.  It might have just been me though, because I usually load my burgers up with quite a bit of spices.

I haven't made this recipe but my aunt use to make something similar years ago.  She used small french rolls and scooped out the inside & stuffed the burger mix inside, rolled in foil & baked in the oven.  Everyone loved them.

Very good! While eating thoughts of all the different foods I could do this with... Pizza ingredients, Ham and cheese. Even was loved by my 18 month old granddaughter.

Tried this last night. OMG It is the Best ever. Thanks for sharing.  Can't wait to try it with other fillings, thinking maybe cheese steak in a blanket would be tasty.

My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this!!!!  Want to try with veggie burgers next, which I am sure will be just as good.

I tried  this recipe for my daycare. They loved it! Something different and easy to eat. When I made it for my family, I spiced it up with hot jalapeno sauce mixed into the hamburger instead of pickles. Both recipes were great and we will use this one again.

A little time consuming but very worth it! I made the bread dough from scratch so that added some extra time.
