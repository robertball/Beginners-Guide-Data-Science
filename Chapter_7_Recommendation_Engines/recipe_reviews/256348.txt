Pretty good! I left out the butter and used a bit of olive oil before serving. This worked well with sole. Thank you for the recipe.

Was looking for a simple whole food recipe for frozen fish fillets and while I did add lots of chopped herbs (chives, oregano, thyme), used a small amount of onion powder instead of onion, this recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I did spray the baking dish based on my last experience with this fish, and added a few halved cherry tomatoes on top while baking. Thank you, this is a keeper!

Very tasty and super simple. I made the flounder exactly like the recipe except I used two tablespoons of butter instead of two teaspoons. I also cooked it for 30 minutes because I prefer my fish a little on the dry side. It came out excellent. My husband who is not a big fan of flounder actually enjoyed it!

Easy to make - 5 stars in this area.   My family enjoyed it but thought it was a little plain.  My "non fish eating" 12 year old did enjoy it dipped in soy sauce.  Will make it again but will probably add a little Old Bay seasoning.

I used Lemon Pepper and a bit of ginger to intensify the flavor a bit. Very easy prep! It might be my oven, but it took more like 32 minutes to fully cook. I will make this again!

This was so simple to make. The flavors did not overwhelm the delicate taste of the flounder. This will be a regular go-to for a simple meal. I paired it with roasted cherry tomatoes. Like another reviewer, I used two tablespoons of butter rather than two teaspoons. Enjoy!!

This was delicious! Made it with frozen  fish fillets and the family loved it. I found that I needed a little more of the butter/lemon juice/onion mixture for the fish I had, and I added a bit of rosemary as well. Served with jasmine rice and peas, just perfect! I’ll definitely make this again, thanks so much for this recipe!

My husband and I both like fish and I found this recipe. I had cod so used that. I turned the skinny end under so it would not overcook. Made no other changes. It was done in 25 minutes as suggested and was delicious. I will try this simple method with other local white fishes.
