This was terrible.  My husband attempted to eat, however, filled up on bread.  I ordered a pizza. I'm sorry, it sounded good.

Very good, I used minced clams and small baby clams for more texture

This recipe was awesome!  I increased the amount of red pepper to increase the heat and we loved it!  Be sure to make extra for leftovers!  Oh, and you can't even taste the anchovies so no worries there.

This is a wonderful recipe, especially to be so easy.  Not quite as spicy as I'd hoped for, though.  Just a touch more red pepper, maybe.  The sauce takes a while to reduce to a less liquid consistency, but I wouldn't drain the tomatoes like some of the other commenters have.  It would detract from the flavor too much.  Just be patient and cook it down.  Also, I don't put the olives in until near the end, just long enough to warm up. I have no idea what's wrong with the negative reviewers.  I absolutely love this!

Absolutely delicious. This is a great "pantry" meal since most everyone has these items on their shelves, or almost everything. I had to chop up a 28 oz. can of peeled tomatoes rather than the 2 14 oz. chopped tomatoes. Worked just the same. Other reviewers mentioned that it was watery, which I noticed while putting it together, so I didn't use all of the juice from the tomatoes, and only about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of clam juice. I also added about 2 tablespoons of tomato paste to bind it together just a bit more. Must not have read the directions all that closely as I thought it called for fresh parsley so I added that with the basil, but it did nothing but enhance it. Also added a few shakes of parmesan cheese and a pinch of salt. I used the anchovies but didn't tell my husband who's "anti-anchovy" but LOVED the dish. For an extra flavor boost you could use kalamata olives. Actually, with the fresh herbs, olives and hint of heat, it reminded me of pasta puttanesca. One other thing...as the recipe states, make certain not to add the clams until the very end or you'll get chewy, overcooked clams. I used one can of chopped (larger) clams, one of minced for variety in the texture. This one will be made again and again!

I have made this dish numerous times for my husband (and guests)...they all love it!!!  I enjoy it as well.  I have made several alterations (from time-to-time) on this recipe (I like capers over olives and I puree my clams and anchovies together in the food processor)...

I thought this recipe was good. It was really easy and quick. The sauce was waterier than I like so I completely omitted the wine/broth and reduced the sauce so that it was a little thick. My husband didn't really like the clams (too chewy). I substituted a can of Ro-Tel for one of the cans of tomatoes to make it a little more spicy. Probably won't make it again, but if you like clams, you'll probably really like this!

Very good, will make again.  I used capers instead of olives jsut because I didn't have olives on hand.  Next time I will drain the tomatos.  Turned out with too much liquid even after reducing for 20 min.

Very flavorful, I was told that it was restaurant quality.  Went with the vegetable broth and a few more anchovies than called for.  I must say that the reviewers who gave this one star and/or called it 'inedible' either did something wrong or don't like clam sauce; this is five star all the way.

I moved from South Florida to Greenville,SC and could not find a restaurant that served Linguini with Red Clam Sauce.  I shared this with my then boyfriend and now husband...hint hint guys!  He found this website and this recipe and made it for me.  It is one of the best tasting Linguini with Red Clam sauce dishes I have ever had!  To this day I am not allowed to make it...he has to do that for me.  It is just wonderful!  Restaurant Quality!  We did not alter anything...cooked as is it is fantastic and very easy!

I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer: 'Very good if you are a clam sauce liker.' It was just a touch too fishy for my liking (it was the clams, not the anchovies. I LOVE anchovies), but it was tasty, filling and elegant. I didn't have pepper flakes so I used paprika instead, which I thought was a good substitute. We had it with a green salad topped with feta, and bread sticks. I would definitely make this again for seafood-loving company. Thanks!

Great red clam sauce recipe.  The sauce turns out very light unlike a thick maranara sauce.  I added an extra can of clams for more flavor.  Very good if you are a clam sauce liker.

This recipe is off the hizzy!
My BF made this for one of our thanksgving dishes last year, and it was so delicious, I ate the leftovers the day after and it tasted great even cold!! It seemed kinda hard to make at first, but after making it about two more times on my own, I can say this is one of the most simple dishes you can make to impress anyone! It looks and smells awsome and it looks like you took a long time to make, but it is really very simple.

Made for my boyfriend w/ a few changes according to what I had on hand. He loved it and raved about it for a while. Said the only way it would have been better is if it had more clams, since he LOVES seafood.  VERY easy. Substitutions: Scaled to 3 svgs. It made 2 big meals. Omitted anchovies. Used a little more garlic; about 1/8 tsp cayenne (not pepper flakes); didn't have black olives; used veg. broth (not wine); regular onion (not scallions) towards end of cooking but before clams, etc.; dried basil (not fresh)--a bunch of shakes.

Got a clue from a previous reviewer and adapted this to  fresh mussels.  The kids loved this!  Made the sauce omitting the clams but added 8 oz. clam juice, all the anchovies and  oil in the can,and let the whole thing simmer for about 15 minutes.  I then threw in about 2 lb. fresh mussels (cleaned) and let those steam open.  I served this over linguine with  parmesan.  What a great sauce!

Excellent!!!  This is definitely a keeper, my husband and I just loved it.  Can't wait to serve it to company.  Might just steam some clams on half shells and put around the plate when serving it.
