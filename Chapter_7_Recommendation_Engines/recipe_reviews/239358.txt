Very moist and sweet. My husband loved them! The only modification was that I omitted the cinnamon.

Nice side to the white chicken chili I made.  I subbed "Cup 4 Cup" for the ap flour to omit gluten and left out the cinnamon.  I think this is a good base recipe and would love to try adding to it.  Not as moist as I would have liked, so 4 stars.

They were great and complimented my chili well. Nice and moist and they had just the right amount of sweet to go with the heat. My only issue was with the cook time. I followed it and I should have watched my muffins as it was too long and should have removed then closer to the 10 to 12 minute mark.

No changes needed.  Very delicious.  I like the flavors of the honey and cinnamon add ins.  Would certainly make again!

I like to substitute a spice mix instead of plain cinnamon....
(Allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger with 
white and cayenne pepper)

I found that these tasted very strongly of honey, but weren't overly sweet.  A bit dry and dense for our taste.

Great texture and taste. I substituted the sour cream with plain yogurt (Balkan Style) which worked out just great.

They were dry and most of what I could taste was the cinnamon.
