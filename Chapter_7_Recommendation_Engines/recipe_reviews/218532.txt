This is one of my new favorite appetizers!  I had a small crock (about 6" by 4") that I put the cream cheese in and spread it to the edges.  I didn't bake it - just put it in the microwave.  It was a big hit!  I will definitely make it again!

Very, very good.  We used a little more pesto and baked it in the oven.  The only drawback is once the pesto on top is eaten, you are left with a good bit of cream cheese.  I think I will slice it, then top it so it goes down into the block.

This is excellent as spread on pita bread or cooked and cooled crescent roll dough as a base for a cold summer pizza, too. All you do is just combine the softened cream cheese and pesto and spread on which ever dough you choose, then proceed with your choice of toppings.

Mmmm, Mmmm, Good! I make a similar dip with salsa, cream cheese, and cheddar cheese and it's always a huge hit so I knew this one would be amazing! I made some homemade pita chips coated with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt, ground black pepper, onion/garlic powder, & parmesan cheese to go with ours and it was delish! For those of you who are having trouble with the amount of pesto versus the amount of cream cheese, I have a solution for you. The dip that I make that is similar to this I let my cream cheese soften, then I take a round baking dish lined with foil, put the block in the middle, and spread it around the pan by smashing it with a rubber spatula. Spread your topping on and cover with the cheese and each bite has the same amount of cream cheese and topping. Hope this helps!! :)

Even though this recipe seems too simple to be true, it is so so good.  Takes 5 minutes to make but the result is delicious and gourmet.  I made it in the oven and I can't wait to try it on a grill.

Very easy to assemble and serve - delicious on the plate!  I've made this on the grill and in the microwave - both were great but I'd recommend the grill or oven!

AMAZING!  Instead of grilling, I just popped it in the microwave for about a minute and a half. I've made it for 2 parties now and everyone LOVES it!!!! Very easy! I served it with roasted garlic Triscuits which was a real hit.

So easy and so delicious.  I used a bit more pesto and sundried tomatoes instead of a roma.   Also made it in a disposable aluminum loaf pan which worked perfectly for the barbecue.   Took it to a barbecue party and everybody loved it, they were practically licking the pan clean.

Super easy and my friends loved it when I made it for girls' night out.   I agree with the suggestion to spread out the cream cheese.  I also substituted Parmesan cheese, which gave it a nice bite.

Super popular.  I cut the cream cheese in half so there is more topping coverage

Very good and so easy to make!! I cut the top of the cream cheese about a quarter of the way down into a checker board pattern so the pesto would fill in the cracks. Every bite had all of the ingredients!! I did bake mine instead of grilling  it and I added a little bit of onion to the tomato topping. Next time I will grill it. A keeper!!

Very good and looks pretty, too.

I have prepared this twice. The first time I served this with wheat pita chips to my friends at a girls night out - big hit!

The second time I didn't have a tomato... so I poured some homemade creamy tomato/basil soup over the pesto in it's place, and it was delicious!
