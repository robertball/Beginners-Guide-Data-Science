By far my favorite thing to make. Everyone loves them! Serve with spicy marinara and Alfredo. 

I'm too impatient to wait for risotto to cool. Just place in freezer for 10 minutes and you're ready to roll. Keep balls separate by placing each one in a mini muffin pan.
I make the balls the night before and leave overnight in fridge.

delicious!!!!!!!! mmmmmm.. every1 loved them. crispy, yet moist, good overall flavor. it took quite a while to wait for, but it was worth the wait if you have the time. WILL make again, and next time will try and make my own marinara, cuz from what every1 else sed on here, its makes it better.. which theyre already awesome. but i bet a homemade marinara would be EVEN better!! probly more for an appetizer, or for a party or event, but every1 including picky children all loved. and so did i!
once again (second time, updated) very delicious! this time, i used frozen spinach, thawed and drained; basmati rice, only chicken broth (replaced wine), and used cream cheese instead of mozz cubes (based on ingredients on hand). still hafta rate it 5.. love these! once again, so does everyone else. still wasnt able to make the marinara but theyre GRRREAT w/o. there are leftovers though (since i doubled recipe for thxgiving), and thinking about making marinara later today. will update again!

I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about them!  It's definitely a labor intensive recipe, but well worth the effort.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but the best thing I can say about it is that the finished product *looks* like it should taste good.  Also, I don't know where the "ready in 1 hour 30 minutes" claim came from.  I have to refrigerate the rice mixture for that long alone, and then give the balls another 30 minutes in the fridge before frying.  It's more of a three-hour ordeal, and while I don't mind spending that much time preparing something delicious, it's maddening to waste a good chunk of my day making something flavorless and disappointing.  The only reason this got 2 stars instead of 1 is because the risotto was delicious.  I'll definitely make the risotto again, but skip all the breading and frying.

Munching on these right now - yum! 

Sorry to say we didn't have the branded goodies listed and we exchanged the wine for white wine vinegar (it was the closest thing I had!) they taste absolutely wonderful - thanks!

This does take a lot of time to make, but it's well worth it. I actually followed each step while making this except for the refrigerating part. Like a previous reviewer, I too am impatient so I put it in the freezer, cut the time in half. I would recommend using marinara sauce or some type of dipping sauce. It makes it that much better. Overall it was another hit in my household.

I have made these twice, to rave reviews each time. My picky sister who never eats leftovers just squirreled away the last 5 of these from the platter and hid them in her fridge, so they were good enough to overcome her hatred of re-warmed food. They are delicious, and worth the effort. I bake them instead of frying them, and put them in mini muffin cups as suggested by another reviewer.

I veganized this recipe by replacing the broth, butter, parmesan and mozzarella cheeses with their vegan counterparts.  I also put some chopped mock ham in the middle along with a couple of peas, just like how it's done in Sicily.  But it's been so long since I lived in Sicily, I forgot weather I enjoyed these with marinara sauce, something else, or just plain.  I tried out homemade marina from a recipe that got high ratings, but was not impressed.  I felt that it masked the great flavor of the arancini itself.
