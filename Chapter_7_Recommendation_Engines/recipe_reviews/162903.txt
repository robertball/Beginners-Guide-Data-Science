Very good. This was quite refreshing, surprizingly. I used my own homemade irish cream. I really like this.

Great! I was trying to find a drink that used club soda, and this is a hit. It's refreshing, smooth, and the amaretto leaves a great aftertaste.

Very pleasantly surprised.  I found a bottle of Amaretto in the back of the cabinet and wondered what to do with it.  I always have Irish Cream and club soda on hand so this was perfect.  The Irish Cream and Amaretto blends wonderfully and the club soda cuts the syrupy sweetness.

I made this on a whim because I had the liquors and needed to only pick up some tonic.  I'm generally a beer drinker, but I appreciated the smooth taste of this as a nightcap.  The appearance is slightly curdled (hence the 4 stars rather than 5), which could turn some off, but didn't phase me (I'm that weirdo that LIKES Cement Mixers).  Thanks for the recipe, Evin!

I haven't been able to really drink in years due to some meds I take, but sip on my hubby's beverages from time to time.  We had a weird assortment of leftover drinks from various get togethers, and found this recipe.  Both of us liked it, and since I usually like fruity stuff and he likes stiffer drinks, it made for a happy medium.  Will try it out on friends in the near future!
