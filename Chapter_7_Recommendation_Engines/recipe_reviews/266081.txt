8.11.19 The peanut butter flavor easily dominates over the banana chip flavor which is way in the background.  So subtle, my husband said that other than the crunch, he wouldn’t have known there were banana chips in the cookies.   If I make these again, I will use the food processor to crush the banana chips because if you bite into a “not-so-small” piece, it’s sort of like chewy hard candy (just my opinion).  I used a small cookie scoop and ended up with 54 cookies.  The texture is very nice and tender, they baked up beautifully, and they taste good!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
