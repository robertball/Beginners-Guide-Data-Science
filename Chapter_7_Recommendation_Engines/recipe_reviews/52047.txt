I was looking for a recipe similar to my great aunt's "cucumber pickles" and this came pretty close. I made it for Memorial Day and my family really enjoyed it. One tip: You really need to salt the cucumbers before making the rest of the recipe to draw out excess water. I don't salt ANYTHING but I won't skip this step with this recipe. For all of the reviewers who ended up with too much liquid, I think this is why. I used 2 english cucumbers, sliced them thin and then sprinkled one tablespoon salt over them and covered with plastic wrap for 2 hours. This will sweat out excess liquid that can be poured off before proceeding with the recipe.  It is absolutely unnecessary to boil anything -just pour everything over the cukes after salting and let set in fridge overnight. I also reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. Wonderful!

This recipe was OK. Really this recipe comes down to a couple of things. The amount of cucumbers that you use and your taste. For those who like a little bite,you'll have to use more vinegar,for those who don't,use more sugar. I actually had to double both. I found that if you add the DILL into the water,vinegar,sugar mixture when on the stove, it has a better taste and mixes better. Also, adding salt and pepper to the cucumbers and onions BEFORE the mixture is a MUST. That small change makes a world of difference to the taste.

HELPFUL TIPS AFTER MAKING THIS SEVERAL TIMES: These tips are just a reminder for my old age what I did after so many test trials.  The person who recommended using an english cucumber hit the key!!  We wondered what was different about our recipe than the person we were trying to copy and that was it!!  BUT... normal cucumbers also taste great, I just could tell a difference.  Then the person who said for 1 cucumber, 1/2C white vinegar, 1/4C sugar, 1/4C water, sprinkle salt lightly after you've sliced them, and then 1/2t dill got it right!  With 4 large cucumbers,, I'd definitely double the liquids or there would not be enough liquid to soak this all up.  I always omit the onions!  I think you have to kind of know what you're about to make to really appreciate this recipe b/c before I had this... this would have tasted and looked gross on paper.  I knew what I was looking for, so there were no surprises.  It's our favorite!  ...or at least my husband's.  It's my favorite just b/c he thinks I'm the best now that I can make his mom's "secret" cucumber dish ;)  His mom also does the salt with a T in Tupperware for 2-3 hrs, rinse the 2/3C+ of water you'll have left, and then continue with recipe.  Also better to marinate overnight.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I used 4 large cucumbers.  I found that after it sat in the frig for 3 hours or so that there was too much liquid.  I am not sure if I didn't use enough cucumbers or if it needed to sit longer.  I will make it again.  It was very good.  I will just have to work out that problem.  I only used 1/2 teaspoon of dill as someone else suggested.  That seemed perfect.  If I do add more cucumbers next time then I will probably use more dill though.  The only thing I didn't like was that there wasn't any suggestion of how many cucumbers to use for the recipe.

YUMMY..To me, this is a classic southern salad that brings back wonderful memories of summertime dinners that were full of fresh garden veggies. I took the advice of others, used one english cucumber, 1/2 cup of vinegar,1/4 cup of suger,1/4 cup of water,pinch of salt, and onion and dill to taste...Thanks

One word- DELICIOUS!  What a wonderful side salad for a grilled steak dinner.  I prepared this dish a day in advance to let the cucumbers soak in all the "good stuff".  I threw in a handful of sliced roma tomatoes as well and wow!  Definitely recommend this cucumber salad- it was just the recipe I was looking for.  I remember having this as a young child and was only fortunate enough to enjoy it if I could beat my sisters to the fridge!

Delicious and so easy!!  I used four medium sized cucumbers and it came out perfect.  Although I'm not usually a fan of dill I added a little (about 1/2 teaspoon) and I loved it. Thank you, Adrienne!!

This was teriible. I added tomatoes and used red onions but that was not the problem. The marinade was nothing but vinegarized sugar water with dill. Heating the marinade did nothing but dissolve the sugar. This definetly needed salt and vegetable or olive oil for a more salad dressing flavor. Maybe some more spices other than just dill too. I won't make this again. But health nuts that don't use salt or oil might like it.

Super YUM! I really enjoyed this a lot, especially the trip down (childhood) memory lane! :) Since I was the only one eating this (my hubs does not like cucumbers), I just used one large English cucumber and less than half of a white onion. As Chef Joy did, I too adjusted the marinade ratios: 1/2 c. vinegar, 1/4 c. sugar, 1/4 c. water & 1/2 t dill. I also seasoned my cut cuke with 1/2 T salt, allowed it to "sweat" for a couple of hours, poured off the water (did not rinse) and then proceeded as directed. For those of you who think this is too watery, sweating beforehand IS the answer (FYI, salt draws OUT water). NOTE: English cucumbers are a better choice here. Although not totally seedless, they contain less of them and are therefore not as bitter as their regular, waxy counterparts. There are many differences between the two, but this is the main one. Look for English cuckes near the regular variety, wrapped in plastic. One more thing.... It is not necessary to allow everything to marinate overnight, but do refrigerate for at least a couple of hours (I marinated my salad for 5-6). Served with grilled hot dogs & macaroni & cheese, this was a delicious summer meal. I'm definitely adding this to my recipe box. Thanks JSCHMAND! :-)

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT! The recipe is all around great. I would like to say that after you gobble up this recipe. DO NOT THROW OUT THE JUICE! The leftover "Brine" or juice has the crisp cucumber flavor infused into it. The longer it sits, the better. Now I'm going to use a word that may turn some people off..Sardines. Keep reading! Don't be afraid. Take a can of boneless, skinless smoked sardines packed in olive oil. (Must be boneless,skinless). Drain off the oil. mash the sardines in a bowl and mix with some of the remaining Cucumber juice and any little bits in the juice as well, just until the mashed sardines are covered. They will absorb the liquid in 10-20 minutes. The resulting "Cucumber Smoked Fish Dip" is a gourmet treat that no sardine hater will ever know is made with sardines! Eat it straight or on crackers,toast, whatever. The two flavors combined is fantastic! Try it with just 1 can first, you'll be surprised. Thank you for the recipe and enjoy! -Natdiamond

I used a red onion because that is my family's preference. I let this marinade for several hours, doubled the recipe to serve at a cook-out and it went over so well that people wanted more. I made and did not have time to let the next batch marinade for long and it went over well. Thanks for a great, easy, delicious recipe.

A big hit - and I will tell you - when I first tasted it I was going to agree with the two reviewers that said toooo much sugar - but after it chilled in the refrigerator the cucumber flavor must have kicked in because it wasn't that sweet.  Anyway, everyone loved it, will be making it all summer since we have fresh cucumbers in the yard - if you are hesitant - try a little less suger - I think I will the next time and compare my family's comments to the ones I received today. That is the nice part about a recipe - when you have a good one like this you can always make a tweak or two to your taste.  Thanks Justin!

This is one of my favorite snacks! I have made this recipe a couple of times now with a few variations based on other reviewers notes. Both times the dish was excellent. Here are the changes I made in my most recent batch:

- First of all, I used 5 pickle cucumbers. It was the perfect amount for me, and the outcome was delicious, but I will try different cucumbers in the future to see if there is a taste difference.
- I threw a tbsp of salt on the sliced cukes and onions and let 'em sit in the fridge for a few hours to sweat out excess water. 
- I doubled the vinegar/water solution (was definitely necessary for me) by upping the water to a whole cup and adding 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar for extra zippiness. Next time I will try half the amount of ACV as the bite was a bit much for me.
- I used 10 packets of SweetLeaf Stevia instead of sugar to lower carbs and sugars (#diabetic). Tasted perfect, no bitterness or aftertaste at all.
- Despite others saying boiling the solution isn't necessary, it is for me, if only for peace of mind to make sure everything is dissolved together properly and because I feel like the initial heat helps penetrate the cukes and onions better and softens them even more. I don't know if it really makes a difference, but I'm going to keep doing it.

And that's it! I eat this by itself or on sandwiches or in salads. Pretty much anything goes with this stuff.

I've made this salad 3 times with cucumbers from our garden. My husband loves it! I usually use about 1 cucumber, 1/2 C vinegar, 1/4 C sugar, 1/4 C water, and a little dill. Although I like to lean on the heavy side with the vinegar and light with the sugar. It's even better the next day.

I followed PANCAKEONE's recommendation.  I used 1/2 c. vinegar, 1/4 c. Splenda (instead of sugar), and 1/4 c. water.  Since I used Splenda, I did not boil the sauce.  I also used four cucumbers, a little red onion, and the dill.  I really enjoyed this recipe.

Reduced to 2 servings - used 1 english cucumber & 1 Tablespoon of fresh dill then left everything else as written, adding a rounded 1/4 tsp. of kosher salt. After marinating in the fridge for 2 hours this was very tasty & truly refreshing served alongside our potato-crusted tilapia & brown basmati rice! Next time I may reduce the sugar slightly, leave out the dill & add a little fresh ginger to make it more like the Sunomono we love at the Japanese restaurants, or even add carrots & daikon & use it to stuff Banh-Mi sammies...but I'll also continue to make it just like this!

This was very good.  I made it as written, with the exception of less onion.  I used half of a small sweet onion.  It had nice flavor, and was well balanced.  But, I prefer my cucumbers to be crisp for my salad.  The hot sugar/vinegar solution wilted the cucumbers into floppy, half-cooked circles.  Next time I will try it without heating the solution.

I've been making this for years....a great cool summer salad to any cookout. The one thing I've learned here is to boil the vinegar mixture first! I've never done this and would have never guessed it could enhance the flavors so well! Great recipe! And I am a very fussy cook. Try it! You'll like it! And stop trying to change the recipe. Its great as is!Thanks Adrienne!

You can leave out the water completely if you give it a little longer to marinate.  Turn or stir occasionally.  This makes more difference if they are not all eaten immediately.  The sugar will draw the liquid out of the cucumbers and it will be very watery.  A light sprinke of salt is good.   A variation is adding really good summer tomatoes.

Very good.  I'm not that familiar with dill seasoning.  I wasn't sure if I should should use dill seed or dill weed.  I used the seed, and think I should have used the other.  I will use dill weed next time because the seeds were crunchy.  But other than that, it was great.

I added some red and yellow peppers also.  Was very good.  Used some to top off grilled burgers, yummy.

I've made a VERY similar version of this recipe for at least 50 years, and my mother made it for about 50 years before that.  If you grow your own cucumbers or have access to home grown cukes, make sure they are the SWEET SLICE variety.  Sweet Slice is almost identical to the expensive "English" cukes sold in stores, but they have even better flavor and texture.  The only difference between my recipe and Adrienne's is that I use less sugar and a little salt.  You can also add some sour cream just before serving for a creamy version, if desired.

This was great! I did as others suggested and put the cucumbers in a tuperware dish with one Tbs salt and let it sit  overnight. I mixed all other ingredients including the onions in a bowl. The next morning I put the cucumbers in the liquid mixture and let marinate. I did not cook anything and also doubled the liquid recipe. It was perfect!

love it!  I allowed the cucumbers to soak overnight with a bit of salt and then continued with the recipe.  I also did not heat the rest of the ingredients.  I just added them to the cucumbers after draining excess water off of them.

Great recipe! This was as good as my mom makes! I ran out of white wine vinegar so ended up with 1/2 white wine vinegar and 1/2 red wine vinegar. I also used Splenda instead of sugar (in quantity of slightly less than the actual amount of sugar called for) to reduce calories.  Will DEFINITELY make again. Tastes best when it sits overnight and the flavors have time to meld.

What a great Salad! Hint-The longer it sits in the fridge, the better it gets! This will be a mainstay for our camping trips since there is no Mayo!! I used my Mandolin to slice the cucumbers really thin. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loves this recipe.  I did decrease the white sugar from 3/4 c. to less than 1/4 c. so it wasn't quite as sweet.  Salt and pepper also enhance the flavors.

While I really enjoyed this dish, I did make a few changes. I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup--and still thought it was a little too sweet. Also, because I don't like dill, I used minced red bell pepper to add a little interest and color. I got a number of compliments and will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe. I also used 4 cucumbers but added red pepper and cilantro.  I also used Splenda 2/3cup instead of the sugar but next time I will try it with a 1/2cup since it was a bit too sweet.

This is a great recipie for cucumber salad.  It's just like cucumber salad you might get at a restaraunt out in town.  I used half a teaspoon of dill and half a teaspoon of cilantro instead of the 1 tablespoon of dill.  It's better if you let it marinate about a day.

This was delicious.  The cucumber salad recipe I've been searching for.  Even my ever picky husband gobbled it up.  I did use slightly less dill as others suggested but next time I might put more.  Can't wait to go pick some cukes from my garden!!

I was looking for a recipe to mimic a marinated cucumber side dish that I've had at Thai restaurants.  This one hits the nail on the head- exactly the taste I was looking for!  I use a mandolin to slice the cucumbers and onions really thin.  Make sure you make enough of the "liquid" to cover all of your sliced veggies.  You can pour off some of the liquid after it has marinated overnight as it will be quite watery. Very good flavor- whoever said it needed oil and salt are out of their minds- this is perfect as is for this type of salad!

This was good, but next time I will use 5 or 6 large cucumbers for this proportion of vinegar and sugar.  I only used two and they were swimming in the liquid.  Still very tasty though!

Just like cabbage for slaw you need to 'sweat' the cucumber first. If you don't then water from the cucumber releases into the dressing which in turn waters down the dressing. For two cucumbers I toss the slices with a teaspoon or so of salt and place into a strainer over a large bowl. Then I place this into the fridge for at least 30 minutes. The salt pulls the extra water out of the cucumber and melts into the bowl along with the water. There is very little salt taste left on the cucumber.

Nice way to use up cucumbers and get fresh veggies into my diet. I used 3 English Cucumbers,  Reduced dill to one teaspoon, subbed 1/2 cup Splenda for the 3/4 cup sugar., subbed a teaspoon of onion powder for the onion. Kept vinegar & water at 1 cup and 1/2 cup respectively. Boiled all ingredients together, then poured the marinade over the diced cucumbers. I diced thicker slices, then cut them in half so it would be easier to serve. Very tasty side dish to have on hand. I kept sneaking into the fridge to grab a few slices & I think I wasn't the only one...I'll have to make another batch to have with dinner tomorrow as I had planned!  YUMMY!

This was absolutely amazing! Very simple to make and easy to adjust if you need to (but I didn't).  I did follow the advice about salting the cukes and letting them sit for 2 hrs.  There was a lot of water to be poured off.  I tasted a cuke and it was too salty so I did rinse them.  Very refreshing salad.  Will make often.  Thank you for sharing it.

Really good, very close to what my grandmother used to make and can.  The name "salad" is a little misleading.  It is more of a "pickled" or "marinated" cucumber.  I also agree with another reviewer.  It is a MUST to salt the cucumber for appx 1 hour to draw out the moisture.  Make sure you rinse the salt off with really cold water. You do not want the cucumbers to "wilt" before you pour in the vinegar mixture.  I also recommend popping the mixture into the freezer to bring the temp of the vinegar down quicker.

Excellent!  Did not change a thing in the recipe.  I did, however, score the sides of the cucumber with a fork before slicing to give it a fancy look.  I do not use this as a salad, I serve them as you would pickles.  Often times I add other vegetables such as peppers or even green tomatoes.  When my vegetable garden is growing, there is always a covered bowl of "Adrienne's Cucumber Salad" in my fridge.

Fantastic!  My father, who never compliments, whispered to my husband, "I hope she doesn't lose this recipe"!  Subsituted half of the white vinegar with apple cider vinegar for additional flavor.

This recipe is similar to the cuc salad that I grew up with. My wife and I enjoy a little heat in many of our foods so I thinly sliced two jalepenos (these were not very hot) and added to the dish. Absolutely correct in letting the dish marinate and cool long enough. Awesome side.

I've made this since I was a little girl but lost the recipe.  The only thing I would add is to "sweat" the cucumbers and onions for 30 minutes before putting the salad together.  To do this put the cucumbers and onion in a strainer and toss liberally with salt.  This will keep your salad from becoming watery and make your onions have less bite.

Found this recipe on here two year's ago, and now every spring when the garden get's planted, we wait for the first fresh cucumber's to grow so we can make this wonderful salad. This has become a staple in our fridge. Have tried other recipes and they just don't taste as good as this one. This will stay with my family for year's to come.

This salad is so good...  I really am at a loss for words to describe just how good it was. I didn't want to stop eating it!!!  I used cucumbers out of my garden.  Salt and peppered the onion, cucumber mix and added the dill with the liquids to boil.  YUM

I only needed to make a small salad with using 1 lg cucumber for our family.   I reduced the amounts as one person suggested and it turned out great.  Note to self (as I will be making again):  1 cucumber, 1 small onion, 1/2 c vinegar, 1/4 c water, 1/4 c sugar (but try reducing to 2 T next time), & 1/2 t dried dill.  I salted cucumbers after slicing, Otherwise followed directions. Prepared in morning, served for dinner.

This is the second time I'm making this recipe this week at the request of my family. Delicious! I agree that cooking the salt/pepper/dill along with the liquid and sugar blends the flavors better. Too much liquid, but worth it. I used fresh dill instead of dried, and red onion and both work well.

This recipe was delicious! So easy to prepare and the longer it sits, that tastier it gets! I even through it on top of some greens and used the marinade as my salad dressing. Perfect summer meal. I also used 1/2 cup of sugar because my mother lacks my sweet tooth. Really great recipe and highly recommended. Thanks Jschmand!!

My husband took this salad to work last summer and this year I am over flowing with cucumbers from gardening coworkers that are hoping I will make it again. :) I salted the cucumbers and let them set for two hours, drained then added all the ingredients without cooking. Very easy.

Light and Fresh!  I added some fresh diced tomatoes from the garden and it was just right! Other reviewers are correct--sugar can be reduced to taste-it was just a little too sweet.

I'm so happy how this turned out. I used the original recipe and did not have the time to marinate for an hour. I refrigerated for 30 minutes and tasted great to guests and myself.

Delicious and refreshing.  I took this recipe to a cook out, it was a big hit.  A great recipe to use a garden's abundance of cucumbers.  I doubled the recipe and added a few fresh basil leaves. I'm making again for another summer party.

I was almost going to change the white onion to red, but I'm so glad I didn't.  We had this withdinner a couple nights ago and Hubby loved it.  The next day he ate all the leftover salad.  Since there were only two us, you can imagine there was lots leftover.  Very good, I didn't change anything.

Good, but left me wanting a stronger vinegar taste, like the cucumber salad I grew up with.  Would have loved to use fresh dill had it been available.

I was a little nervous about the amount of sugar (I used splenda for a low carb version) and vinegar, it seems like one always over powers the other. However this turned out just perfect! I brought it to work and everyone wanted the recipie, I just made my second batch this week!

I was looking for a good cucumber salad to go along side a German dish I was making called rouladen. This was a perfect side for it. Tangy and tastes like pickles.

Absolutely perfect! I left out the dill & used Cider Vinegar (what I had on hand). This was just like my grandmother used to make. I took it to a dinner party & every person asked me for the recipe. Can't wait to have too many cucumbers on hand again!

MAKE IT 0 POINTS: I've made this recipe for years, but with a couple adjustments. I use equal amounts of vinegar (I use cider vinegar), water and Splenda, instead of sugar because I follow Weight Watchers.  This makes it 0 points.  I don't salt it either.  The liquid can be used for another batch, but it won't be quite as strong.  This is great with garden fresh cucumbers and the Walla Walla sweet onions we get in the Pacific NW, but any good sweet onion will work.

Great for getting those you love to eat veggies.  I have made this twice now and used 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/2 cup water and about 4 tbsp. sugar.  It was just a bit to sweet and tangy the first time.

Very good.  We added a couple of medium sized tomatoes, and used about 2 good sized cucumbers.  It was great the first day, but better the next.  This will be great recipe to use this summer with the abundance of tomatoes and cucumbers.  Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe, I have been looking for a cucumber salad that didn't have too much of a tart vinegar taste and this is it!  I have made it twice already although I don't use the dill, I just don't like dill.
Thanks!!

This is an easy and delicious salad for snacking, but also goes great alongside roast meats. Especially pork. I have also used the cukes on sandwiches.

Tangy, sweet and refreshing! I used red onion, half white vinegar and half red wine vinegar, and added minced chives. Served with blue cheese crumbled on top, to go with my apple stuffed pork chop. YUMSTER!

This was too sweet for my tastes (and my husbands) and it needs a little more kick than just dill.

I could eat this salad all day! The heating of the marinade DOES make a difference. I salt the sliced cucumbers, let them sit an hour or so, then drain and rinse. Then I add the sliced onions, then I boil the marinade, then proceed. Yum!

These were somewhat enjoyable, but really just tasted like pickles.  Good pickles, but not really a salad that I would want to eat a whole serving of.

Made this recipe yesterday for a picnic.  Got rave reviews!  Only thing I would add is to heavily salt the cukes and let sit in a colander for about an hour to remove excess water.  Then rinse with water and drain them before mixing with other ingredients.  Pickles will stay crisper.  I used fresh dill, too.  Great quick recipe!

Really great, flexible recipe.  I followed some of the other suggestions of reducing some of the sugar and salting the cucumbers before dressing them with the vinegar mixture.  I also added some crushed red pepper for a nice sweet and sour kick!

Very good.  I agree a little too sweet for me.  Next time, I'll cut down on the sugar.  I used 4 cukes and there was plenty of liquid to marinade in.

Nice refreshing salad.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar as my first batch was too  sweet.  It is now a summer standby.

This was a really nice recipe...and that says a lot coming from me, since I tend to stay away from cucumbers due to the fact that I burp all day if I eat them!  One thing I forgot to do was to cover them when they were in the fridge and everything tasted like cucumber for days.  Especially the water and ice.  Don't forget to cover them!!  And make these again and again :)

I was looking for an alternative to the creamy cucumber salad that would withstand the heat. I omitted the onion (personal preference), used 1/3 cup water, 1/3 cup splenda, and 1/4 sugar. These were really good and so easy.

These are great - easy, simple recipes. We have a family get togeter every other sunday at my mother-in-laws and I made these a few months back and have had to make them several times since then. My In-laws are constantly trying to get me to make these. I finally just gave them this recipe. Thanks!

Exactly what I was looking for.  Just like what my grandma used to make. Never had dill in it before, and that's a great addition. I heated vinegar/sugar in microwave and poured over cucumbers, let sit overnight in fridge and just had some: flavor is perfect, veggies are crunchy, vinegar took heat out of onion.

I used red onion, 2 cukes, 1 1/4 cup vinegar, 1 cup sugar, salted cukes, omitted water since cukes will put off a lot of water.  Yum--I eat this by the bowlful.

This is quite good!  I did decrease the sugar.  A local place makes this, and it's wildly popular.  They use red onions to make it prettier, which I will try next time.  I tried adding fresh dill, but I'll leave it out next time.

A great side dish!  My daughter said it tastes like summer!

This was a great summertime recipe!  I used two english cucumbers, 3 small mini cukes, and a small purple onion.  When I poured the vinegar into the measuring cup, I left it just below the 1 cup line and added a few dashes of red wine and balsamic vinegar.  I used just a little less dill than the recipes called for. I also added just a few red pepper flakes since I like things hot.  Yummy! This was so good I'm lucky any of it made it to the refrigerator to chill!  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

This salad was awesome! I made it for my son's 1st birthday party and no one was eating it. I asked why and I was told they just weren't sure what it was. After I explained what it was, it was gone in no time. My boyfriend said that I shouldn't have told what it was so he could keep it all for himself :) I did not use the splenda, but I did use 1/4 cup fresh, chopped cilantro instead of dill and I garnished it with sesame seeds for an Asian looking flair.

I halved the recipe for 1-1/2 english cucumbers.  Prepared this yesterday, tasted it, thought 3 stars at best, then let it sit overnight in the fridge.  Tonight, it was 5 stars all the way.

Very very good!  I decreased the amount of sugar because I like it sour and added tomatoes.  I used red onions and the tomatoes and onions gave it a nice color.  Next time I will add some crushed red pepper for spice.

I really liked this recipe. I cant wait to try it in the summer when cucumbers are actually in season. I did not add the dill and cut the sugar down quite a bit. I also used a red onion instead of white. Will make again!!!

These were DELICIOUS! A neighbor pawned a few huge cucumbers from her garden off on my daughter, leaving me to figure out what to do with them. I took two of them to make this recipe. My only changes: I didn't peel the cucumbers at all. I also used about 1/3 rice vinegar, 1/3 balsamic vinegar, and 1/3 white vinegar (I was using up bottles of the first two). I prefer the taste of the other vinegars to the white. My 3 year old daughter loved the cucumbers as well! Next time, I'll probably throw some tomatoes in too.

Not bad, but a little too sweet (and tangy) for my taste.  I don't think it was a great hit with my roommates, either.  I'll try it again, but next time with a little less sugar.  Probably good with tomatoes, also.

This is such an easy recipe and it keeps for several days in the fridge (not sure how long?).  My late aunt used to call these "refrigerator pickles" and she used celery seed and mustard seed instead of the dill.  Not sure how much she used, but I'm going to try that next time.  My husband thought these were a little too sweet ("they taste like sweet pickles!") and I guess since this is called a cucumber salad he is right.  But if you are looking for something that tastes like sweet pickles this is right on.  Slice up some fresh tomatoes and what a great, cool summer salad!

This was absolutely delicious. Exactly like my grandmother used to make. This is just wonderful with most any type of meat and or as a side dish with any meal. Very cool and refreshing on a hot summer day. The measurements of the ingredients were right on the nose. The dill kicks in a light, tangy zip to an already wonderful taste experience. It is the tang of the vinegar and the sweet of the added sugar that make this such a wonderful, unique, and yummny dish. Thanks so much for sharing this!

I make this recipe quite often and I always make sure to use English cucumbers and red onions.  I also add 3 tomatoes seeded and cut into small wedges. Sometimes I use cherry tomatoes sliced in half.  For the dressing, I find that adding 1/4 cup olive oil helps to make the marinade more flavorful.

This was great! I substituted rosemary for dill (living in a non-western country, sometimes I don't have access to specific spices). I also used white wine vinegar instead of just white vinegar. I agree with the review about salting and peppering the cucumbers and onions prior to putting on the mixture. I wish I had done it last night, but I always worry about cucumbers getting soggy and/or moldy, so I'm okay with doing it about 2 hours before serving and letting it refrigerate.

I make these with very thinly sliced cucumbers and have them as pickles rather than a salad.  I like adding bay leaves and even chilli flakes for an extra bite.

This was delicious! These were served to me at my Aunt's and the recipe was immediately requested. It's a dilly cucumber and it's so yummy! My Aunt did use her mandolin to very thinly slice the cucumber and onion and I thought it was great that way. My suggestion to many of those who gave it less that 4 stars is to try the recipe as is and don't rate the recipe because if you change it, it's NOT the recipe.

Loved it! Reminds me of the cucumber and tomato salads my Dad use to make. I didn't care for tomato but would eat the cucumbers and onion out. Great to find a recipe (because I never knew how he made it) with just the cucumber and onion. Perfect summer side to have in the fridge too. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I've made this too many times to count for my husband because he loves cucumber salad. We tried about 6-7 different versions, but this was by far his favorite! I always make it in small batches since he's the only one eating it. Like some others have said, I use slightly different proportions than the original-1 cucumber, 1 onion, 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water, and 1/2 tsp dried dill. Salting the cucumbers beforehand and letting them sit for 20-30 min really helps draw out a lot of the moisture in them so they don't release quite as much into the salad later. I just toss them with the salt and let them sit in a colander in the sink, tossing them occasionally. And I find it easier to just put the dill right in with all the other ingredients instead of waiting to stir it in. Give it a try if you like a good tangy, vinegary cucumber salad!

A huge key in making cucumber salad, is that you slice the cukes uniform with a mandolin and that you sprinkle salt on them liberally to force the water out of them.  After letting them sit so the water comes out, you squeeze them dry with your hands.  This step is missed in so many cucumber salad recipes.  It makes a nice salad with vinaigrette or sour cream.  BUT YOU HAVE TO SQUEEZE THE WATER OUT OF THEM.

Have made this for years.  Best to slice cucumbers and onions and cover with salt water and refridge for a couple hours.  Drain well and then add vinegar, sugar and water.  Cucumbers and onions will be yummy crisp!

The hardest part is slicing the cucumbers.  I would recommend organic cukes if you have them.  Delicious and great for a summer potluck as it does not require reheating!

This is an excellent cucumber salad recipe.  I used English seedless cucumbers.  Like another reviewer suggested, I added 1 tablespoon sea salt to the raw cucumbers to render water.  Drained cucumbers of excess water and proceeded with recipe.

Thanks, JSCHMAND

This is really good. It made SO MUCH. I had 3 very big cucumbers, one small onion, and I followed the recipe exactly. I did salt the sliced cucumbers before as some users suggested to cut down on the liquid. Very tasty, I will make this for the next BBQ when there will be a lot of people around to eat it.

Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the cucumbers do need to be salted first, and it doesn't state to use dill weed or dill seed. but the flavors is good.

This is a good, basic cucumber salad.  Very refreshing.  I only gave it 3 stars because it needs to be eaten in a day or 2 because the cukes do get limp.

Excellent!  Made it exactly as written, but didn't add the dill because I didn't have it.  Didn't matter!  It was great!

I made this last week and my husband loved it so much, I had to make 2 batches for him this week.  I made it using fresh dill and it's perfect!! Sweet, tangy and refreshing.

Tryed this recipe the other night and i thought it was pretty good! It was my first time making cucumber salad. My husband said it was good but too sweet for him. I guess it just depends on how you like it...but for me it wasnt too sweet.

I am mostly writing this review as a reminder to how I want to try to change it next time. I only used 1/2 cup sugar and I didn't like the sugar taste, so next time I will try using only 1/4 cup. I also drained the liquid after chilling and added 1 cup sour cream for a creamy version of this salad. That came out nicely. Overall, very nice place to start!

I found this recipe when I was looking for ways to use my home grown cucumbers.  My husband and I loved it.  I think he'd like me to fix it every night.  He said his mom used to fix it.

Just like mom used to make!  I made a couple of changes to the directions just to make prep easier.  To solve the problem of too much water, just eliminate the water from the recipe and let the cucumber "weep".  And instead of boiling the marinade, just mix it together and stick it in the microwave for 1 minute or until hot.  I also added a little salt and pepper to taste.

Definitely a great summer salad.  Like a crisp but super fresh pickle without all the work.  I did not give 5 stars since I felt I had to make some changes.  Leave out the water and it is not necessary to boil the sugar mixture.  1 cup White Wine Vinegar and 3/4 cup Apple Cider Vinegar.

Cut this one down to 2 servings.  Made exactly as directed.  Thought it might be too much sugar but went with it anyway.  Glad I did because this was the perfect blend of tart and sweet.  Used a dill mix from the pampered chef.  Paired this with the "pretty chicken marinade" also from this site.  Perfect light and awesome dinner.

This is the best way to serve cucumbers to a crowd.  I never use the dill and it still tastes wonderful.  I also add a pinch of salt to add flavor.  This works well with supermarket cucumbers as well as English cucumbers, of which I prefer the latter.

This is a great cucumber salad.  I prefer the taste of my mother-in-law's fresh salad, but sometimes I need a make-ahead dish & this is it.  It's sweeter than I expected & I added lots of dill.  yum.

I did make a few adjustments, like red onion instead of white and I added green peppers as well. I also doubled my juice to completely cover the vegetables but I got rave reviews and loved this recipe. I will definitely try it again, adding a few more veggies next time!

I was given a large basket of cucumbers from a friends garden, and didnt want any of it to go to waste, so i tried this recipe and it was just what i was looking for.  i read several of the reviews first...and took some of their ideas to make my own salad.  I cut the water in half, used the full amount of vinegar (we like vinegar in our house) and cut the sugar down to less than 1/4 of a cup (mostly to taste)...i didnt want it sweet.  I would definitely measure the ingredients to your taste on this recipe...but its certainly one i will make again.  I also didnt heat the ingredients...i just mixed it all in a bowl and put it in the fridge (stirring on occasion)...but make sure to let it set overnight to really let the flavors soak in!  This was delicious and refreshing on a hot summer day!

I followed this recipe exactly.  The cukes were good...but not great.  As written, they come out VERY sweet...which is fine if that's what you like.  I prefer them much less sweet, so next time I may cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.

Excellent!  I made this for our annual soccer picnic and it was a huge hit.  I couldn't believe how many people complimented me on it. I only did two things differently: 1. I salted the cucs after slicing, let them sit for a couple of hours in the fridge to pull the water out of them and then drained them. 2. I added a teaspoon or so of ground black pepper. Yummy and refreshing!

I just now noticed that you're supposed to heat the dressing!  OOPS!  Well, it comes out wonderful even if you skip that step.  I'd also suggest to decrease the dill by half.  AND I really suggest peeling your cucumbers and they really soak up the dressing better!

Great way to use all those cukes from my garden.  I've never had cuke salad before.  It was interesting.  I made it w/ Splenda as two of us are diabetic.  Would make again.

Way too sweet for me.

More like having uncured pickles with onions in a sweet vinegar sauce.

Maybe great for others, needs some work for folks like me with a more sour palate.

I have made this cucumber salad many times and I thought it was time to review it.  I love it!!  It has some of my all time summer favorites- cucumbers and dill.  I also like the fact that there is no oil in it.  I have made it exactly as the recipe instructs and it comes out wonderful every time.  (I use 4 cucumbers)  Thanks for a great recipe.

Turned out great!!  I made this the night before... using 5 medium cukes & one medium (baseball size)sweet onion.  As recommended by another reviewer, I warmed the water/vinegar in the microwave to help dissolve the sugar.  I'm a huge dill fan, so I used about 1 1/2 Tbls in this.  It was awesome!  When peeling the cukes, I would peel a strip off, then leave a strip on... that way when I sliced with the mandolin, you got great coloring around the edges of the cuke.  Great summer salad!!

I make this recipe without heating the vinegar mixture. Marinade this overnight instead. Everyone loves this when I make it.I don't use dill either, but Im not knocking that.

This was pretty good.  I used 2 cucumbers, but had enough dressing for 1 or 2 more.  I just didn't need that much salad.  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and it was just right.  I also made this the night before to give the veggies time to soak up the juices.

This was a nice summer salad.  I do not recommend using the potato peeler to make the slices.  Although it was easier they were sure wimpy and did not hold the crunch.  They wilted after about a day and a half.  I think it would've been better to slice them at 1/8" or so.

This was a really nice change from what my husband always wants: sliced cucumbers in water and chilled.  He likes vinegar so I thought he'd enjoy these.  YES!!  They were GGRRR888!  Made them exactly per your recipe.  He loves them!  Will make again and again for him, and me, too!  Thanks Justin!

Very, very good. I'm going to try and substitute with lemon to see the difference, because when I first tried it - there was a strong vinegary zing when you swallow, but once I was accustomed to that taste I enjoyed it. My husband also did. I also left out the dill like many of the other reviewers.

Yum!  I was looking for a recipe like this.  I used kirbies instead of cucumbers - they have a much better crunch and I added 1/3 of a red pepper diced - to give it some color.  I also substitued most of the sugar for splenda and that worked just fine.

I followed the recipe exactly. But maybe it's just my personal taste buds, but I didn't like this at all. It tasted more like a bowl full of pickles, than a salad. I won't make this again.

I have been making this every week since I discovered this recipe.  I use Splenda and I add carrotts and purple onions.  I have even saved the liquid and added more cucumbers to it.
How long do you think this would keep if you made up several batches?  I like having it on hand, like pickles!!!!!!

This was the best cucumber salad i've ever had. I used a red onion like another review had suggested and the salad was so pretty. I also used my peel stripper on the cucumber to take strips of the skin off, then when i cut it, the cucumber slices looked like little flowers.

Really nice, but the longer it sits in the marinade the stronger the resemblance to sweet pickles.  So if you don't care for that after a couple hours of marinading pour it off.  I didn't mind it the longer it sat, but my husband didn't care for it the next day.
I will make this again.

Absolutly fabulous! Only thing I changed was I added 4 tomatoes. I diced everything up and added fresh dill instead of dried and used about 2 teaspoons of it. Everyeone raved about it. I mixed this in with plain rice and it was sooooooo good

This was pretty good.  It reminds me of a fresh version of sweet pickles. This is good as a side salad.  I used red onions just to live-up the dish with color.

My husband LOVED this, and I will probably use this recipe again though I will definitely reduce the sugar the next time. It's still the closest that I've found to the awesome cucumber salad my grandma always made...

This was great....It reminds me of a salad as a child called Thunder and Lightning!....In that salad there were cubes of tomatoes....So that is what I added....
Tomatoes, less dill, fresh ground pepper and a dash of salt!!..Pretty presentation, also!

Everyone loves this recipe. I always serve this when I'm having hot and spicy food.  I use fresh dill from my herb garden when it's available. It's definitely a crowd pleaser.

Very simple and lightning fast.  I usually use half the onions but I've made this numerous times and everyone likes it.  Pour out the marinade after a day or so or it will get soggy.

This would be even better with imitation crabmeat added.  I also left out the dill.

Delicious!  I found it to be just the right balance between the sugar and vinegar.  However, I don't consider this to  be a salad.  Rather, these are delicious pickles-- much like old-fashioned "ice box" pickles.  Whether you consider it a salad or pickles, either way, I enjoyed them!

This is as close to my mom's as I have found.  Growing up in the 50's...  such wonderful memories!   I doubled the recipe and used half English cucumbers and half regular.  I was glad to have read the reviews saying to "sweat" the cucumbers for a couple of hours, sprinkling with a little salt.  I poured a LOT of liquid off that didn't need to be there.   Overnight marinate before the barbecue.  Awesome!

Tried it and it is a #1 go to cucumber salad.  After eating the cucumbers and onions you can reuse the dressing again.

Made this on the spur of the moment. It was ok the first day, the second day--oh boy!I didn't salt the cucumbers but I left out the water altogether. I substituted Splenda blend for the sugar. Careful- it isn't an equal swap. I didn't heat the vinegar and Splenda, didn't need to, just stirred until the sugar dissolved. Added the vinegar and splenda to the cucumbers and onions in a zip top bag and put it in the fridge. Others that reviewed the recipe gave the heads up that the pickle was drawing water out of the cukes and watering down the pickle. Made sense to me, so I just eliminated the water from the recipe and let it do its work. It turned out fantastic for me and now my kids are calling me for the recipe! It is definitely refreshing and improves with age.

I make this recipe frequently.  It's so easy to put together and gets better the longer it marinates.  I use a little less sugar and fresh dill when I have it.  Our whole family loves it.

I enjoyed this salad a lot. I took the advice of the others. I added salt to the cucumbers after cutting and allowed them to drain, I then created dressing with a 1/2 cup of vinegar, 1/4 cup of sugar, and 1/4 cup of water. No need to heat, just mix well. I added a half cup of onions and pint of cherry tomatoes. I then poured the vinegar mixture on top and allowed it to marinate for an hour in the frig. It was great!!! Will do it again.

I salted the cucumbers (2 not 4) and onion while the marinade was heating and then rinsed the cucumbers/onions before adding the marinade.  I omitted the dill, and instead, added about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to the vinegar mixture for a bit of heat.  I like this flavor combination.  This is a good base recipe to be experimented with to suit your own taste buds!

This was fantastic. I've grown up on a couple different versions of cucumber salad (love the sour cream/dill version as well but trying to cut back on the calories!). Prior to making the salad - per my usual procedure - the cucumbers were sliced, salted with kosher salt, weighted with a plate and left to drain in a wire colander for at least an hour. I always rinse and let drain after (pressing with a clean dish towel), because I'm pretty sensitive to salty tastes. I always use English cucumbers, as well. The salad was GREAT, and has turned out equally well with both vidalia and red onions. I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup, which to my tastes was perfect.

I've been making this recipe for a while now.  Every summer we grow cucumbers in our garden, and this is a great way to use them.  I always slice the cucumbers using the blade on the side of my box grater, so that they are all thin and uniform.  I slice up a large red onion, and before pouring the boiling vinegar mixture over the top of the cukes and onions, I season them well with kosher salt.  Instead of just using dried dill, I use a 'lemon and dill' seasoning that I get online from Cherchies, and I use it pretty liberally.  The amounts for sugar/water/vinegar are perfect, and I absolutely ALWAYS make this the day before we plan to eat it for the first time.  Great recipe!

I made the recipe as listed with one exception...I replaced all the sugar with about a 1/4 teaspoon of pure stevia. It was delicious! It tastes a lot like bread and butter pickles, in my opinion. My kids loved it too. They polished off the entire batch in one sitting.

These are delicious! I did salt and soak my cucumbers first for about 2 hours. I like strong flavoring so I wanted to make sure there wasnt excess water diluting this. The only other change I made was to use 2 cucumbers instead of 4 (thats all I had), I left the amounts of everything else as written. It was perfect. My parents liked them so much that they bring me all the cucumbers out of their garden so I can make these for them.

This was a 5 star recipe even though I didn't read the instructions til just now, so I didn't heat my vinegar solution up at all. Will do next time as I know that'll infuse the veggies with even more flavor. Thanks for sharing!

This is almost identical to my grandma's cucumber salad!!  Only difference is, I peeled the cucumbers first, used a little less sugar and used fresh dill.

Really good way to eat veggies during meals or before as appetizer.  On weekends, my husband and I 'graze' with cajun roasted turkey breast gut in bitesize, some cheese bites, nuts, and plenty of marinated veggies with a glass of wine. I marinate carrots, cauliflower, cucumbers, jalepenos, garlic cloves and mushrooms.  Except for mushrooms, they keep well for several weeks in refrigerator.  You need to put carrots, cauliflower and garlic in microwave a minute or 2 depending on size cut and then immediately put in ice water to stop cooking.  Then ready to add marinade after veggies cool.  Better for you than most appetizers.

Sweet & sour, tart & tasty - my son loved this as did I - best part is, you really could add just about any fresh veggie and it would soak in the marinade.  You could have your kids eating anything...  Or just keep it as sophisticated as is :)  Keep in mind though this is VINEGAR not a creamy dill sauce...  I really enjoyed it.

My grandma always made a version of this salad. I absolutely LOVE it. My mom can make it too, but whenever I try, I feel like I don't get it just right. I think it will always never be as good as Grandma's...but this recipe is great. Tasted like home.

My husband thought this was phenomenal, I didnt' care for it at all. (so I compromised with 3 stars)  It's really all about your personal preference. I am used to the kind of cucumber salad made with sour cream. This was very simple, and I will make for my husband again.

I Liked this recipe.  They only thing I did different (after reading reviews) wasw increasded the vinegar by 1/2 cup.  Then I had to strain it because that made it to watery.  I did seed over 1/2 the cucumbers because that waters it down also.  I should give this a five star because I could not stop eating it.

I liked the recipe but was way too sweet for me. I even added more vinegar but couldn't seem to eliminate the amount of sweetness. I didn't add water I don't think it was necessary and I didn't boil the liquids to pour over the mixture. Came out fine except for that one problem I encountered. Next time I think I'll cut the sugar down to 1/8 or 1/4 cup. Thay may even be too much but it's worth a try.

More like 4.5 stars. Because there really is no need to boil and pour hot liquid over the veg. When I did that (once) it "pickled" the cuc's and they got fairly limp. I shake liquids/sugar up in a jar to dissolve. I add sliced roasted red bell pepper occasionally and use Vidalia or a sweet type onion. I also salt cuc slices, lay in colander, cover with a layer of ice and let excess moisture drain off but it's not 100% necessary. Just don't add any water to dressing ingredients if you don't remove excess Cuc moisture.
These will be similar to a "quick" pickle but I like my cuc's n onions fresh with some crunch. I also add celery seed and a few twists of fresh pepper but that's just me. Easy to adj the vinegar/sugar ratio for your own tastes. Adding in a thin sliced "garden fresh" tomato right before serving is another way to go. Fresh dill (if available) is much more enjoyable but dried works ok as long as it isn't old and tasteless. I like to let this sit in frige majority of day and then for me, it's perfect. Great hot weather salad. Make extra "dressing" in a glass jar and store in fridge so it's ready when get your next craving!

"Sweat" the cucumbers by laying them sliced on a kitchen towel w/sea salt. Blot after about 20 minutes.  Perfect counterbalance to the sugar/vinegar dressing.  I love this recipe as there is no oil needed.  Red onion is a lovely option.

This brought back great childhood memories! I added a little too much black pepper the first time, which made it increasingly spicy. Lesson learned - no black pepper! My little pickle-loving son adores these (once I pull the onions out of his bowl).

We have a surplus of cucumbers and I love cukes in vinegar.  This is a nicely balanced recipe. I used Lemon cucumbers and had a heel of a red onions so added that as well as some white sweet onion.  It was perfect after 5 hours in the fridge.

I love this recipe, but looks mean a lot to me. I used red onion and I wanted spicy ones so I threw in about 15 whole dried chili peppers and everyone raved about them. You can make 1/2 spicy and half regular. (I always make a double batch) and when I make them spicy I do not use the dill.

I ended up using a sweet onion instead of white, since that is what I had, but this still was a very simple and tasty recipe.  I would definately let this sit overnight, it tasted MUCH better then.

This is what my mom made while I was growing up! Instead of dried dill I used a chunk of fresh and what a difference! I think next time I'll cut back the sugar since I like a sharper taste. But overall, I liked it and it went over well.

We liked this salad a lot!  Could eat it room temp or cold.  I added some red pepper rings and cherry tomatoes that needed to be used and they worked out great.  I also added a bit of salt and papper.

Very yummy! My friends seem to think so, too! I took a reviewer's advice and salted the cucumbers the night before to rid of the excess water. The liquid amount was perfect.

This was easy and had a nice flavor with the onion, but I thought it was a little too sweet. Which surprised me since I have a major sweet tooth. The cucumbers got a little soggy though and lost some of their crispness in the dressing. I used cider vinegar since I was out of white and it turned out fine. Thanks JSchmand!

Great balance of sweet and tart.  I didn't boil it but did as several posters said, and just used cold.  Also did not have fresh dill so used dry.

Wonderful and super easy to make. I have made this three times. I don't salt the cucumbers before and I don't boil the mixture. I just slice the cucumber and onion and add the ingredients (mixed well of course). Does taste better if chilled first a few hours prior to serving. Big winner at our house.

This recipe is so simple and yet so delicious! I haven't used cucumbers for anything else since I tried this recipe nearly a month ago. I never did pick  up dill at the store but I didn't miss it either. I used one reader's tip and salted the cucumbers after they were all sliced,  stirring frequently for about 20-30 min. Then I strained the slices of all the natural water and then added the boiling vinegar mixture. It seems as if the cucumbers absorbed much more of the vinegar mixture and made a much tastier salad. This is a huge hit at a potluck, everyone will want the recipe! Thank you for this inexpensive new family favorite!

Excellent!  I needed a way to use some of the extra cucumbers from my garden and this did the trick.  I laid out my sliced cucumbers on paper towel and then sprinkled with salt to draw out excess water.  I also used red onions to add some color.  My family is thrilled that I found this recipe!

This recipe was good, but if you're looking for a real winner, try Dilly Cucumber Salad.  It's like this one but has twice the flavor.

YUMMY!  This is a wonderful, cold summer salad that would be good as a side dish at a BBQ or a by itself as a lunch munchie.  I am one of those that usually will change up any recipe but on this one....I didn't (and wouldn't) change a thing!

Growing up, my mom worked in a deli and brought home salads daily.  I think she made this one too.  I love this recipe.  It's easy, inexpensive, and refreshing.  I could eat a ton.  It get's better and better over time, and LOVED the last bite!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe.  It was very watery.  Even after a day in the fridge, the cucumbers didn't come close to absorbing all of the liquid in this recipe, and I used more cucumbers than the recipe called for.  My family wasn't crazy about this taste of this either.  I'll keep looking for a different cucumber salad recipe ... a lot of people liked this one, but it didn't work out for our family.  Sorry!

Great recipe!  If you don't like vinegar, this is NOT FOR YOU!  This was a summer staple in our house when I was a kid.  It's a bit sweeter than my Mom made, but still good.  Add green peppers for flavors.  This is best if it marinates overnight.

Great recipe for using those wonderful fresh garden cucumbers! We have used this recipe for years and we DO NOT heat the mixture.  Just give it several hours or overnight to chill. Good with or without the dill and also good to add some fresh garden green (and red)  bell peppers and chunks of cabbage.

This was really yummy, but I used less sugar (1/2 cup).  I'm making it again tomorrow, and will go down to 1/3 cup and see how that goes.  I grow a TON of cukes each summer, and am always looking for new ways to prepare them.  We have them almost every night.

This was great and went amazing with our seared ahi and sushi rolls.  Was a hit.  I made a few adjustments.  Red onion instead, added pepper, toms, and some ground cayenne pepper. I used 1/2C white vinegar, 1/4C sugar, 1/4C water, and then 1tsp dill.  Let sit for 3hrs and drained out most liquid afterwards.  Was wonderful!!!

Delicious! In my version, I used 4 large cukes, peeled and seeded. (Good suggestion to salt and pepper as you go then drain. Salting helps draw out excess juice and some occasional bitterness.) Then, about half of a large, Vidalia onion sliced paper thin. Marinade: a little more than a cup of white vinegar,  only a quarter cup water, 4-6 TB sugar, and dill (fresh is better). Let sit overnight in the fridge, giving it a shake now and then. This amount fits just right in a 10 c. (2.5 qt) plastic container.

The marinade left much to be desired. Way too much vinegar for my taste. I did enjoy eating it, but I will continue looking for a cucumber salad recipe that is like the one I had as a child. This definitely does not take the cake.

This was pretty good although it wasnt quite what I was looking for.  My mom use to make something like this but hers was more creamy.  I found out she used mayo in hers so I added a couple of tablespoons of mayo to it and now I love it!  Thanks for the starter recipe!

This simple recipe was just what I was looking for. I first had a cucumber salad like this at a little tai asian chinese place with a mixed asian lady owner. It seemed simple but ohhh soo good recipe. Then I saw this and it seemed to be what I wanted. A little too sweet though. And I skipped the dill. Just added some more vinegar and will use less sugar next time. Also I'm gonna grind a little fresh black pepper on it. Smaller pieces of onion were better too. Yum!

This is a good, extemely simple recipe.  I made a few changes based on personal preferences--I used red onion b/c I feel it's more flavorful; also used apple cider vinegar in lieu of white vinegar.  So easy to prepare, and it'sa good way to use up cukes from the garden!

This is a very good recipe, as is. But I add just a little pico De Gallo (made by Don Enrique) seasoning to it to give it some spice. We really like it that way.

Pretty good.  I didn't think it was sweet enough, so I added a total of one cup of sugar.  I don't like dill, so I skipped it altogether.

I made this Recipe tonight with Alaskan Salmon, seasoned red potatos, and steamed Broccoli. It was a hit we all loved it I added the dill and it was perfect i used Vidalla onions instead of white ones as thats what i had on hand. i am interested in what it will taste like tomorrow as everyone seems to enjoy  it even more the next day .
thank you for the great recipe.

A cool and refreshing side dish!  The main thing I would suggest is changing the vinegar.  I'm not a huge fan of white vinegar - too much acid - and opted for rice vinegar which has a much more pleasant taste.  I used 3 cucumbers, purple onion instead of red and used only a 1/2 cup of sugar.  One suggestion for making the slicing of the cucumbers easier - use a potato pealer.  It goes a lot faster that way and the slices are consistently thin!

Nice with changes suggested by others: I used 4 cucumbers and 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/4 water, 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 TBS of fresh dill.  Nice and cool.

I cut back on both the vinegar and the sugar and added just a tad of garlic and onion powders, plus fresh cracked black pepper. The result was a wonderful, icey cold and very refreshing salad. Thanks Justin, my family loved this side!

I gave this four stars because I loved this light salad that went well with the bbq chicken, but my family didn't care for it very much.  I would maybe put less dill next time (and I love dill) to see if that was what turned them off to it.  It was a sweet change from plain vinegar covered cucumbers!

This was really good.  I changed a couple of things...I used only a 1/2 cup of vinegar, full cup of water and I diced up two cucumbers, just because I had them on hand and absolutely loved them.  I also only used a tsp of dried dill.  Came out very good. Will be making again with my twist.

Great summer salad,light, refreshing and everyone LOVED it.  The recipe didn't say the number of cucumbers and I used three large cucumbers. I didn't have time to boil the water, sugar and vinegar but it was GOOD at room temperature. Try it!

It tastes like sweet pickles.  Very good sweet pickles, but not cucumber salad.  Since the mood was for cucumber salad and not sweet pickles, a bit of a disappointment.

I have a major sweet tooth, so I liked this recipe. My family, however, found it to be too sweet. They love "Mom's Cucumbers" (submitted by Karen). I used English cucumbers because they're seedless (less mess).

I really hate leaving negative reviews, but this salad just did not do it for me.  I thought it was much too sweet and felt that a tablespoon of dill was way too much.  I made it for a dinner party of 8 and there was one person who kept coming back for more and actually asked me for the recipe, but everyone else just politely picked at it.

very good recipe, substituted the dill for black pepper, and basil, and double up on the other ingredients to make more.  But the sinker was when my husband, whho is definitely not a salad person, asked for more. loved it!

This recipe came out just right -- tangy and a little sweet! The extra marinade is great to keep the cucumbers fresh. Still crunchy even three days after I made the first batch!

This is one of my favorite ways to prepare cucumbers.  I love to make this when we barbecue.  For some reason they seem to go so well with grilled food.  The dill definitely makes this dish perfect!  Thanks Justin.

I liked this recipe--more tart and tangy than I thought it would be--but I liked it--the kids did too! I used two large cucumbers and there was a ton of liquid--I'm guessing you could do about 4 cucumbers for this recipe.

This was very good.  I let it sit overnight to let the flavor soak in.  Great summer side dish.

Just like Mom makes! Really. My mom is out of town, so I had to go elsewhere to find a recipe similar to the cucumber salad she's made since I was a kid. This is it exactly... well, except that she uses cider vinegar. But the vinegar/water/sugar proportions are just right. I also used red onion, just because that's what I had. Exactly what I was looking for :-).

Nothing to add to the recipe. Can add seeded tomatoes or Romas, perhaps swap out red onions for the white, but otherwise, perfect as is!

I really enjoyed this, very similar in flavor to my mom's cucumber salad from days of yore. I followed the recipe exactly, just adding a couple of chopped tomatoes, a little salt, and a quarter cup of olive oil to add just a little richness.

Delicious. Turned out sweet, crunchy pickles with a nice light flavor. I followed all the ingredients & amounts exactly, except that I pre-salted/squeezed/rinsed/re-squeezed the cucumbers so they'd expel some water before soaking in the pickling solution. The type of cucumbers wasn't specified in this recipe, but I used English cucumbers and they worked well. Will make again.

I doubled the liquid. Used 2 huge cucumbers (i actually don’t like English cukes) one large sweet white onion cut in chunky bites (i don’t slice anything thin. I like chunkier cuts) 1 red bell pepper (could have added a yellow as well) and a container of grape tomatoes. Let sit over night or at least 6-8 hrs in fridge before eating. I would slice and add 1/2 tsp of salt to reduce liquids in the cucumbers. Just add salt to sliced cukes and set aside about an hr. Then rinse. Drain and add to liquid! Enjoy!

I've made it twice now, love it!  I adjusted the sugar down just a touch, but only because I like a bit more of the vinegary bite.  I use rice vinegar, not white, and I use fresh dill instead of dry.  Good stuff!

I don't really think it really needs any sugar. If any is added, it should be a lot less--for pre-diabetics and diabetics.

Quite a simple recipe, with good result. I cut the quantities down quite a bit so to avoid "aging".  I used vidalia onion.  For my first batch I discovered that I had no dill in my inventory, so used tarragon instead.  That mix was pretty good too.  Second batch was with dill, and I took the advice of other reviewers and lightly salted the cukes before pouring in the hot brining mix. Really good side salad (throw in a few cherry tomatoes when serving).

Quick and simple . We get tons of cucumbers from our garden so this is a quick addition to summer time meals. I use a bit less water and sugar.

Great as is. I do pull out water from the cucumbers by adding salt to the slices and letting them rest in fridge for a few hours. At the end I add in some fresh ground pepper too.

Didn't change a thing, we loved it. Seedless cucumbers and sweet onion. After slicing the cucumbers and putting them in a bowl with salt, after 2 hours I may have drained 2 Tbs of liquid before putting them in the liquid mixture. Didn't boil the liquid mix but mixed it thoroughly to dissolve any sugars. The dried dill was right for this. Will make it again.

I used the vinegar I had available, lemon white-balsamic, rice vinegar and regular ole white.  Used given measurements except NO water and  no boiling of anything!  Used salt  to soak cukes and onions.  Will make this weekly until the summer season is behind me.

I was looking for a recipe for a cucumber salad like my Dad made.  This recipe was perfect.  I have made it numerous times and always take this plus a non dairy macaroni salad when going to barbecues and picnics.

This is perfect just like it is.  I can make this now without looking at the recipe. I have used equal portions of apple cider vinegar with the regular vinegar a few times.  Thank you for sharing this!

My husband really loved this, I am more of creamy salad person but I thought it was good. I followed others advice and sweated out the cucumbers and used 1/4 cup sugar. I used red onion as is our preference, and added some fresh red pepper for variety. Great recipe!

This was very good,I used half white vinegar and half rice vinegar,and I like freshly ground pepper in mine,otherwise everything else the same. The rice vinegar gives it a better taste. I also never use those store bought cucumbers, but the pickling cucumbers from my garden. Much better flavor, and they don't have all that water. My favorite part of summer, fresh veggies from the garden!

I did end up with a lot of extra liquid however the taste was SO good! My 11 year old daughter could not get enough. I used green onions from my garden and still very delicious! I will be saving this recipe

excellent! I did salt the cukes first with 1T of salt and let sit. Drained off the excess water but did not rinse, then made according to recipe. Cut back on dill b/c I'm not a fan. Delicious.

My husband and I really liked this.  We used 5 pickler cucumbers fresh from our garden and took the advice of another reviewer and used 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/4 c water and 1/4 cup sugar.  I also only used a little bit of onion just to add a touch of flavor.  :)

This (or something like it) was a regular summertime presence in the refrigerator as I was growing up. I don't think Mom knew Adrienne (and I'm not sure Mom's "recipe" was exactly the same), but ... it's cooling in my fridge at the moment. Yum.

Love this!  My friends love it! I'm from Louisiana, lived in Pennsylvania, and now reside in Mississippi.  Everyone I have served this to has loved it and always asks for the recipe.  Sometimes I change it up a little with red onion, cider vinegar, leave out the dill, and add mayo for the creaminess (and they still love it).  This is my number one cucumber recipe.  ThankX!

Made this recipe as written...I used a mandolin to slice the cukes.  I did salt the cucumber slices for an hour to drain the water.  Still the finished product had quite a bit of liquid...but we actually liked it that way.  I thought about adding some celery seed, but the recipe (as is) was awesome!  Maybe next time!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

Two things, Some comments sound like they expected this to be a frigerator pickle and it is cucumber salad.  Very much reminds me of cucumbers and vinegar that my mom used to make.  Second use white balsmic-awesome-but then use less sugar.

Made this last and loved it!  I read the comments and soaked my in salt water, then rinsed.  I also cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I let set all night.  Turned out terrific!  I will use less sugar next time.

I've made this several times. It's delicious! Cut the cucumbers and the onions very thin. Do salt cukes for 2 hrs and pour off the excess water before adding the rest of the ingredients. I cut back on the onions and sugar to taste. I've also used rice vinegar for a different taste.

Wonderful! Ive never had anything like this so I had no expectations before I made it. And I will definitely make this again. I think next time I will add a bit more vinegar but the amount of sugar was fine.

I used an English cucumber and the directions given by Chef Joy.  I thought it was a bit sour for our liking...it needed the extra sugar as the written recipe dictates.  I may try to add some more sugar the next time, or try another recipe.

Absolutely perfect. Just what I was looking for. I have never heated up the sugar/vinegar mix before and I really think it makes a big difference. This will be my go-to recipe from now on. :)

I use 2 cucumbers, 1/2C white vinegar, 1/4C sugar, 1/4C water, sprinkle salt lightly after you've sliced them, and then 1/2 T dill.  Can also add 1 tomato sliced thinly and cut in half.  DH loves this!

I wanted to find a cucumber salad recipe comparable to the one at the Fresh Market because paying almost $7 a pound a couple of times a week was starting to get expensive.  This recipe is delicious and we like it even better than the Fresh Market's!  I followed the advice on another post and put the dill in with the water/vinegar/sugar and boiled it all together.  I also use red onions instead of white.

This tastes very similar to other dill cucumber salads that I've had (and almost identical to another on this site) which means that it's good!  If you're using sugar substitutes, they will work well in this recipe.

Followed recipe exactly. This was ok. Edible. But I like similar recipes better. Like Betty Crocker's Cucumber Salad. I think the key was I didn't like the ratio of vinegar to water in this. I thought this used too much vinegar. Also I  didn't think the onion was needed.

Every summer my Great grandmother grew cucumbers in her garden and there was never a day that she didn't have a bowl of this exact salad sitting either on the table or in the fridge(at least till summer ended)What I noticed different about your recipe was the lack of salt and tons of pepper. She never measured anything and of coarse was the best cook I ever knew. But she would leave the cucumber in the vinegar solution over night before it was really any good to eat...she never drained it and as the cucumbers disappeared she'd simply add more without changing the vinegar just adding more onions, vinegar, seasoning as time went on. Makes a great snack! This brought back many good memories running across this.Thank you for sharing it.

Great basic recipe. I followed Cook' s Illustrated suggestion and salted the thinly sliced cucumbers, placed them in a colander and set a water filler 1 gallon ziplock bag on top of the cucumbers. Let then drain for 1-3 hours. That way a lot of the moisture is drained and you are less likely to water down the dressing.

I just love this type of cucumber salad.  It is fresh and easy to make.  I do however sprinkle one to one and a half tsp of kosher salt over the very thinly sliced cucumbers, wait ten min, drain the water from the cucumbers (no rinsing) before adding the hot vinegar.  I also double the dry dill (I like the dill flavor) and add a couple dashes of white pepper.  Yum.  Much better than any oil based vinegar dressing and the salad just keeps improving the longer it is marinated.

DELICIOUS !!!!  I made this for a 4th of July BBQ, and everyone loved it. There wasn't a cucumber left! Marinating this overnight really brings out the flavor!!!

Even my picky 10 year old daughter enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the recipe and after all was done added sliced tomatoes on top.  I didn't want them to get soggy in the warm vinegar dressing.  They still ended up full of flavor.  The next day we added them to our meat and cheese sandwiches.  That a hit!  I think that I sliced the cucumbers too small, next time I wont be worried about doing them so thin.  A new staple in our house.

This is my go-to recipe for this dish.  The vinegar to water and sugar ratios are perfect. It's like summer no matter when I make them.  The one step I add is salting and rinsing the onions and cucumbers prior to adding the liquids.

I didn't enjoy this recipe. It might just be a taste thing. The sugar-vinegar taste did not appeal to me.

This is our family's go-to cucumber recipes. Five stars for simplicity (ingredients and process) that makes a pretty, bright, & flavorful salad with nice texture that compliments spring & summer meals. Marinates well over several days in the refrigerator.

I make these all the time, and have thrown shredded cabbage and carrots in as well. Good variations on the seasoning are including a few cloves of garlic, red pepper flakes, and/or coriander. I use whatever vinegar I have on hand--usually apple cider vinegar for a bit of sweetness mixed with either regular white or rice vinegar. I tend to keep them for a week or two in some tupperware in the fridge and use whenever I want a mild pickle addition to a dish. You can't really go wrong with these!

Fantastic recipe.  I use fresh dill to taste, because IMHO, dried dill lacks all the flavor of fresh.  Also, I cut down the water to 1/4 cup because I like the liquid to have a good bite, and the cucumbers release a lot of liquid all on their own.   I've made this recipe about a dozen times and every time I get rave reviews. Thanks!

I didn't heat the vinegar mixture at all, instead, I sliced my cucumbers super thin using a veggie peeler to make "ribbons" being careful not to get the seeds.  Then, I just let it marinate for 1 hour.  For those who said the liquid is too much, just use this recipe as a marinade.  Drain the cucumbers after 1 hour and garnish with fresh or dry dill for some color.  I used my cucumbers to garnish/compliment my chicken satay with The Best Thai Peanut Sauce found on this site also.  Thanks for the recipe, Adrienne.

AMAZING!  I usually make it with mayonaise.  I really enjoyed this. This has to be healthier.  I followed the recipe, but only added 1/2 cup sugar.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe.

Once I found this salad, in the summer of 2009 when our garden was spewing cucumbers, this was the only cuke salad I made!  It lasted forever in the fridge, and was a welcome addition to picnics, without worrying about keeping it cold.  It is reminiscent of bread and butter pickles.

Utterly delicious!!!  I did cut the cucumbers, added salt and pepper and let sit overnight to remove the water and that did help season the salad.  Will from now on always make this recipe.  Their is no need to look any further!

Nice and refreshing. I omitted the onions because my husband is allergic and reduced the sugar. All all of my friends and family ask for this anytime there is a potluck.

I love this recipe. I have made it several times over the summer. It's great to bring to BBQ's too. I only use about a 1/2 cup of sugar and it's easier to marindade using a large zip lock bag. Lots of compliments on this!

Delicious and refreshing salad that was really easy to make.  I was out of dried dill so I used dried basil and topped it of with toasted sesame seeds before serving for additional décor and taste.

This was great! I added a 1/2 tsp of celery seed. Also, I used 1/2 cup red wine vinegar and 1/2 cup white. Turned out great! Put red onion in it for color. Great recipe!

Loved this one!  I added a few shakes of cayenne pepper for a little kick and used a red onion for some added color.  It does get liquidy, but nothing that a slotted spoon can't solve.  The vinegar & sugar with the kick of the pepper was super refreshing as a side for ribs!

I haven't tasted it yet but I know it's yummy ... my mother made this when I was a child (except she used fresh dill which I can never seem to find in the grocery store and didn't use onions).  It's marinating in the fridge right now and I can't wait to eat it!

Pretty good! A little sweeter than what I was looking for. Next time I will probably use apple cider vinegar and cut the sugar substantially. All in all though a good, simple salad! (Give it plenty of time to chill!)

This was such a delicious and simple recipe!  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and used slightly less than 1 tablespoon of dill, otherwise I didn't change a thing.  Like other reviewers, I salted the cucumbers first before adding the vinegar dressing.  Yum!

This is a very easy and quick recipe for a side dish.  I made a huge bowl for a BBQ, and everyone loved it. The sugar adds the sweetness and hides some of the vinegar tartness.  Perfect for a nice summer side salad/dish.

Great recipe, exactly what I was looking for.  Nice sourness from the vinegar, sweetness from the sugar and crisp, freshness from the cucumber.  I didn't have any dill, but I'm sure it would only make it better!

This is the perfect cucumber salad recipe. My husband LOVES cucumbers this way and this recipe is perfection! I did not have white vinegar so I used apple cider and did add an extra tablespoon or two of sugar. I really was pleased with how these tasted, even though this is not one of my favorite dishes, in general. Great recipe!

I just made this two days in a row for two different parties this past Labor Day weekend. Everyone went crazy over it.  My teenage son that doesn't much like vegetables, told me about 10 times on how much he liked it!...   Thanks for the great recipe!

This is pretty good.  It's best eaten within 24 hours, when the cucumbers are still crisp.  If you liked it when your mom put vinegar over cucumbers when you were little, you'll find this even better.

I give this recipe 4 stars because the recipe is not specific enough on the quantity of cucumbers, or how thin to cut the cucumbers/ onions. Thin is a relative word. I felt it left a bit of questioning   
when preparing this food.

I also feel that this recipe was way too sweet. I would cut back on the sugar by half, and add about half a teaspoon of pepper. 

Other than that the dish was good, not great,simple,and quick.

Very Good! I used a sweet onion (that is all I had) and cut back just a bit on the sugar. Everyone loved it! A keeper.

A great cool, crunchy salad for summer! Tastes a bit like sweet pickles. I changed the proportions a little in an effort to clear out the fridge, and I used fresh dill since I had it on hand. I thought the fresh dill really added to the flavor. This does have a lot of marinating liquid, but just use a slotted spoon for serving and it's all good.

This was a very good recipe for something different. I had a lot of cucumbers in my fridge that were going to go to waste if I did't do something different. I used 2 1/2 medium cucumbers which I had enough marinade to make more. I added vidalia onion slices. Some reviewers have complained that it was too watery put I am pretty sure that it doesn't make much of a difference what you do. I tried to draw out some of the moisture like others recommended by salting and covering for atleast an hour. Take make things easier I would just recommend using a slotted sppon to drain the liquid before serving and not stress out too much about how watery this. I only rated this a four since I can only eat so much of it due to the vinegar. It is a nice side dish with steak.

Not being a terribly experienced cook, I was a little reluctant to try this recipe after reading how several reviewers had tweaked it differently with differing results... but I'm glad I did.  I loved this - especially the dill and vinegar flavors!  It would be fantastic as a side to a sizzling steak.  It would have been helpful to know how many cukes to use, but since the recipe calls for 1 onion, I assume it's 5-6 cukes.  I used about 3 med-large cukes, so I only needed about half of the onion.  I sliced both thinly (THIN is key) using my mandoline slicer, which gave a nice even slice.  I salted the cukes in a bowl for 1 hour to draw out excess water before continuing the recipe.  I definitely had to modify the vinegar/water/sugar sauce since I was only using 3 cukes.  I would recommend cooling and then TASTING the sauce before pouring over, then you'll be able to adjust to your liking.  I also found that there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the bowl after marinading the salad in the fridge, so I stirred it well and poured the excess liquid out before serving it.  Come to think of it, I'll probably make a smaller batch of sauce next time.

Great recipe. I heated the mixture to dissolve the sugar the let it cool before adding the cucumbers (I used 4 large and it seemed perfect).I did only add about half the dill and used quite a bit less sugar as my husband and I both like ours a little tart. Made it the night before the 4th and it was perfect the next day.

Yummy!!  I used 1/2 cup of vinegar,1/4 cup of suger,1/4 cup of water,pinch of salt, and lot's of dill.  I heated the mixture in the microwave and then put in fridge to cool BEFORE pouring over sliced cucumbers and onion, I let sit overnight and it was fantastic.  We ate it in two meals and then I picked more cucumbers from my garden and put those in the leftover liquid and those were great also...so I got two for one!

I did as others suggested, only I doubled it. 1 cup vinegar, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 water and a pinch of salt. I stuck with 1 cucumber. I added a few pieces of red onion. I didn't have dill. The cucumbers are a little sweet on their own, but I think they would be great on a sandwich, especially tuna! I will try it soon.

I thought that this was just an "ok" recipe. I made a huge batch, and I'll probably just end up tossing most of it. It's far too sweet. My husband hit it spot on when he said it's great for just a bite or two, but anything more than that , the flavor is too much.
Oh well, I'll try to play with the recipe a little.

I made this without onion or dill, which I didn't have on hand. My grandmother didn't use either one so I figured it was no big deal. Anyway, it tasted great and reminded me of her. If you have not had this before it will tasted like pickled cucumbers, which is what it essentially is. Although the dill and onion will add a different flavor of course. I'll make again and add the onion and dill.

Tastes like pickles.  If you want pickles, this is fine.  If you want marinated crispy cucumbers and onions, don't pour hot liquid on them.  Probably just a personal taste...

Tangy! Simple preparation & ingredients.  This tastes just like my favorite side at a local BBQ restaurant. I used three large cucumbers and had more than enough liquid, so next time I'll use four.  The recipe could easily be doubled to make a large batch for those summer family cookouts.

Very similar to a recipe I've been using for a while.  Try adding chopped red onion, 1-2 T chopped fresh cilantro and some chopped peanuts as a garnish. Great recipe - thanks for the dill idea!

This was good, not great.  It would be best with a richer main course, I think.  Overall it was a bit too vinegary for me.  The flavor of the marinade was just a little off -- needed something else, not sure what.

I used a little less sugar and a little more vinegar and was really happy with the flavor.  Just like my Missouri farm mother-in-law's.

Pretty good, it was very sweet.  I have another cucumber salad that I like better.  So thats why I gave it only 4 stars.

This was good, but I think next time I'll chop the onions and cucumbers up so it's more "bitesize." Just a preference of mine. :)

This tastes like the cucumber salad I used to eat while I was in the Army (not all Army food is inedible). I used 1 and a half English cucumbers (the long skinnny seedless ones), and about 3/4 of a small sweet yellow onion. I used 1/2 a cup of vinegar, 1/4 a cup of water and a 1/4 a cup of sugar. I also sprinkled the cukes with some salt, pepper and garlic powder while I was waiting for the vinegar to boil. My dad even went back for seconds, and he almost never does that.

Too sweet for me. I think this might have better met my tastes if I'd used salt instead of sugar, but that's just a personal thing.

A good recipe, not new though, I have found that using a rice vinehar that is somewhat sweet in flavor eliminates the nbeed for added sugar and, with out the water and the heating the salad can be made faster with pretty much the same result, minus the wilting heat induces.

This salad was great, quick, and easy.  I would recommend cutting down a bit on the onions.  Also, I went according to some of the other reviews and cut down on the sugar.  It was great.

This was good, but very vinegary and sweet - to me, it was like eating sweet pickles rather than a salad. But I think his will go very well on hamburgers. Inspired by some of the ingredients for the Korean Cucumber Salad recipe on this site, I also added some carrot slices and toasted sesame seeds (but next time, I think I will either omit the sesame, or sprinkle on top rather than having it soak as well since it made the colour strange)

This was fantastic.  I served it along with Potato salad that i had dill in so i did not put it in the cukes too.  I also had salad and chicken kabobs.  It was a great dinner.  Very little left over.  I thought it a bit sweet, no one did, but next time i'll just adjust the sugar to my own taste.  I will make this over and over.  Reminds me of home as a kid when my dad would put vinegar and cucumbers together and call it lunch.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Good and simple. next time I will cut the dill in half.  The vinegar provides enough zing.  The dill was a bit much.

Very simple and refreshing!  If you are short on time you can dice the cucumbers and onions instead of thinly slicing.  I also used cucumbers but the recipe is probably enough for 3 cucumbers

We just didn't like this - it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  We ate it for a couple of days as a side, but the leftovers just went in the trash as nobody wanted to eat it.

Yummy!  This was a hit at dinner.  I used 3/4 cup of white wine vinegar and then almost 1/4 cup of red wine with just a splash of cider vinegar to finish off the entire 1 cup.  Also only used 1/2 cup of sugar and it was plenty.  It really does make a lot of sauce, but it was pefect for 4 large cucumbers.  They shrunk down a little as they marinated, so I could have probably fit another one in there if I needed it.

This is close to the way I remember cucumber salad at family picnics as a youngster. I've tried to remember what went into it,but failed till I found this. I've tried this several times just changing a few thing each time.
 1st it was a bit too sweet so I reduced the sugar to 1/2c & as I was growing up(and still do)hot peppers were a family favorite, so I add banana peppers & tomato cut into small pieces & a pinch of minced garlic.

Very good.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because it really is a side salad rather than a salad that could be used as a main dish.  Which is what I prefer.  I used 1/2 c. sugar, and white wine vinegar with a touch of cider and red wine vinegar, and 2 large cucs.  Would make again if I had a surplus of cucumbers.

This was yummy!  I changed it up like some others had suggested.  I used the red onion for color, and used less sugar.  I made it the night before using.  It was great!  Will definatly make again.

This was a great recipe.  I cut down to about a 1/2 Cup of sugar and i also threw in some cauliflower i needed to use up.  Add the dill a little at a time, i don't think it needed the whole tablespoon.  Over all it tasted great, and got better with every day that it sat in the fridge.  Unfortunatly that wasn't long at all.

I broke my cardinal rule of not trying out new recipes on company because of the rave reviews this had received. What a mistake. We all found this too sweet - despite cutting the sugar, and too vinegary. It also needed salt and pepper.

Great salad!  I used red onions for a little more color, as a previous poster recommended.  A wonderful mix of sweet and tart- I love my cucumber salad sweet, but if you don't, just put half or 2/3 the sugar in.  Can't miss with this one, an easy crowd-pleaser!

I thought this was very good, and so did my guests.  It does make A LOT of dressing.  I used 4 large cucumbers.  This tastes kind of like sweet pickles.  I'll definitely be making it again.  Since some reviews said it was too sweet, I used 1/2 cup of sugar and I thought they were perfect!  Thanks for a great, quick, recipe!

Just as I remember from the old neighborhood.  Since my husband is diabetic I substituted Splenda for the sugar.  No change in taste.

Delicious.  Used less dill because I am not a big dill fan.  Still came out great. My daughter and I have been picking at these cucumbers all day.  May not have any left by the time our company comes.

Delicious! I think my husband was a little skeptical when I put some cucumbers on his plate with dinner, but when he tried them he looked up at me "these are really good!".  They do take like sweet pickles, and are really a nice light addition to any summer meal. Perfect as is.

Very nice side dish or starter salad. However, instead of dill I used a California Spice mix as dill tends to be a little potent.

Took this salad to a family bbq and everyone wanted the receipe.  It was great.  Fresh cucumbers from the garden.  I would definately say that the longer this marinates the better.  Not a sould complained about the salad being too sweet.  Even the kids liked it.  I will try brown sugar next time.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner (I made honey baked ham) and it was awesome!  I generally don’t care for white onions, however, I always try a recipe as written before I make any adjustments, and I was very glad I did.  The cukes and onions were crunchy and flavorful, reminded me of bread & butter pickles (much more subtle though).  This will be a regular side at our house!

I use rice vinegar for a more mellow taste. Sometimes I use the seasoned one to give it a sweet and sour taste.

I was looking for a recipe that my sister-in-law could eat, and chose this to make.  Everyone at the party loved it, including my sister-in-law. She  has numerous food allergies, so this recipe is perfect for her.  Based upon other reviews, I salted the sliced cukes, let them sit for an hour and then drained them well.  I added fresh dill to the vinegar while cooking, and I marinated the salad overnight (12 hours.). The salad sat drained all day in the fridge, and it had a wonderful flavor to it when served at dinnertime. I thought the cucumber slices were a little droopy, but will try to cut them a little thicker next time.

This was absolutely delicious. I decreased the sugar to about 3/4 of what is was supposed to be because my family tries to cut down sugar whenever possible.  It was the perfect balance of sweet and tart.

I am not a fan of cucumber, but was given a bag full so I had to find something to do with all of those cukes!  Made this and took it to a church picnic.  Had so many compliments and requests for the recipe, that I made it again for a family reunion and had the same reaction.  Before the next big gathering, I was asked specifically to make those pickles!!!  LOL, so for the lady who was not a cucumber eater, I now am  known for my good cucumber salad!  Thank you.  Easy and good.  Bonus

I didn’t read any reviews before making this.  It’s very good, but maybe next time I will salt the cukes and add a little less sugar and a bit too f red pepper flakes.

This is similar to the recipe my DMIL made here down South... I adapted the recipe to reflect some of that. I  used one finely chopped sprig of fresh dill, and substituted Vidalia onions (red onions give a bright pop when Vidalias are out of season! ). I also use apple cider vinegar for pickling,  because it adds a surprising fruity flavor. 
Our family is diabetic, so 'Truvia' in a 1-to-1
substitution is de facto.  Yummy!

I never heated the mixture before, but this turned out fabulous. The flavor really soaked into the cucumber. Especially after sitting overnight. 
I think I will keep making it this way. I used some dill spice along with dill from my garden. Great flavor. Even the onions.

Delicious and simple. I think the flavor was at its best the 2nd day after leaving it in the fridge to marinate. After day 3 the cucumbers lose their crunch.
I wanted to use less sugar, so I used 1/2 of the liquid mixture. It was still delicious, but probably even better with the recommended amount. 
I used fresh dill since it was what I had.
Will def make again!

This is so good! I made it as others suggested, by first sprinkling the sliced cucumbers with salt and letting some of the liquid draw off before making the brine and pouring it over them. Fabulous! Prefect summertime side dish!

I cut the sugar in half and still found it much too sweet.  This may be good for someone who wants a sweet pickle flavor, or great as a condiment for pulled pork sandwiches or similar.  But I personally thought the sugar and hot-vinegar blanching steps detracted from the fresh, delicious flavor of in-season cucumbers.  So I didn't care for it as a salad.  I'd modify by reducing sugar further (or cutting completely), using less dill and/or fresh dill, and salting the cucumbers more heavily.  I would also let the vinegar mixture cool so that it doesn't "cook" the cucumbers and discolor them, preserving more of the crisp, fresh cucumber taste.

Did not boil and cut the sugar at least in half. Eyeballed vinegar, water and added sugar to taste. Added minced garlic and sometimes use green onions . Sometime use rice or other vinegar.

One our very favorite recipes on this site!  The only changes that I make is that I use red onions & red wine vinegar.  In addition to the dill... I also throw in fresh oregano from our garden .  The dressing is delicious!!!

Yum. This was just like grandmas. Made it the original way first and then the second time I salted my cucumbers first and didn't bother heating liquid. I also used fresh dill. Would give 5 star after that.

I prepared this with a main course of spicy pork tenderloin, so needed a cooling touch to balance out the meal.  The only alteration was that I split the vinegar into while and coconut portions giving it a slightly more exotic taste.  Fresh dill is preferable.  The prep time is minimal but it should definitely be chilled.

This was was good but did not live up to my expectations. This does not keep well at all either. Good if you plan to eat it all right away.

Excellent cucumber recipe. I marinated the cucumbers and onion overnight. Then squeezed the cucumbers and onion prior to serving. I also added some crab to the salad. My husband said it reminded him of his mothers recipe she served on New Years Day tradition (Japanese).

I absolutely loved the recipe. I added sliced tomatoes to give a pop of color. I didn't have any dill so I replaced it with parsley. I also added at the end garlic powder, ground milled pepper and salt, to taste.

Nice, refreshing salad. Complimented the shrimp cakes beautifully! I replaced 1/4 c of the white vinegar, with rice wine vinegar to give it more of an Asian taste.

OK, this was fantastic.   I will follow the salt/ and sit / and drain recommendations next time as it got a bit soggy.  I was in a rush, so did not read the reviews beforehand. Thank you for the recipe, it was just what I was looking for.   Since I tend to cook AutImmune, I used melted honey instead of white sugar (just cut back the amount).  Yummmmmmy! Its message it to my Pepperplate recipe index.  So, it's a keeper!

Love this - a family favorite.  I also add fresh torn parsley.  Very much like what my Grandma Irma used to prepare for us when I was a little girl.

This is a great recipe, easy and so refreshing. My personal preferences; next time will reduce the sugar and I don't add water. I don't recommend allowing it to marinate more than a day, as cucumbers look washed out and they aren't as crisp. I'll definitely be making this time and time again!

This is a great recipe, I have been asked to make these many times. I use a mandoline for easy, fast, and uniform slices, and have it done and marinating in the fridge in just a few minutes. I have made it with sugar substitute to reduce the carbs with very good results, as well.

Tasty! I have tons of fresh produce from garden, so added cherry tomatoes and fresh dill. Followed others suggestions to reduce sugar and water and was glad I did- would be way too sweet otherwise. Could add to pasta to make cold salad too. I think some balsamic vinegar would be great with this too.

Dang this is good, REALLY GOOD! Made the recipe exactly as posted, except I only had time to let them chill for 20 minutes.  Still a little warm when we tried them, but still so good! Can’t wait to try the remaining left after it’s chilled overnight. Hopefully they’ll last that long.

Recipe was for a larger amount than I would make. I cut in half and found more sugar should have been added. Still was a very good and easy salad to make.

Not as I expected. The vinegar can be overwhelming and the sugar could be too sweet. Need to experience to get the right taste. It's a good thing my grandson grew cucumbers so I didn't waste any money on it.

I love this - definitely what my grandma and mom always made when I was growing up. But we add tomatoes too - it's nice to use whatever you can from the garden!!! I like to salt and drain the cucs first. And I don't find the water necessary bc u should have enough water from the cucs. The first time I made these with champagne vinegar bc that is all I had no they were delish!! Second time I followed the recipe (except water) and we loved it. Tonight I'm gonna try with balsamic vinegar. Yum!!

Took to a birthday party picnic. Lots of complements and no leftovers. I thinly  sliced  4 cucumbers, added one teaspoon of salt and let sit in a colander for a few hours. I couldn't believe how much liquid came out and the volume really decreased. I then rinsed the cukes with water so they wouldn't be too salty. I put the brine ingredients (I adjusted the amount of sugar based on my tastes-taste your brine-that's what your salad will taste like. If it needs more sugar-add a little at a time)in a small pan and heated just till the sugar melted-not a boil. Then poured over the cukes. Refrigerated over night. It was fabulous. Will definitely make again.

I used a bag of mini-english cucumbers.  I think there were six or seven in the bag.  I sprinkled them with sea salt before pouring the dressing over the top.  I'm happy with the way it turned out.

Didn't change a thing and it was wonderful! Very refreshing. Trying it on guests this weekend. My husband who always preferred his mother's version made with sour cream, loved this even more! Wow. That's a keeper! (Both the salad and the husband!)

Loved this with freshly picked garden cucumbers. Just looking at the 1 cup vinegar, I knew the 1/2 of water wouldn't be needed so I omitted. I agree with other reviewers that you can cut back on the sugar too. Even my 22 year-old son said it was too sweet. Now that's saying something. Otherwise, loved it and would make again with those modifications.
Update: The next day the salad was much more watery even with omitting the water from the recipe. So I made it again. This time I sliced the cucumber in half and scrapped out the middle with seeds then salted and left to dry in a colander for 20 min. This made a significant difference. I also cut back the sugar to 1/3 cup.

4 stars as written, 5 with modifications recommended here. I used 2 english cucumbers and a vidalia onion, and 1/4c vinegar, 1/8c sugar, 1/8c water and the dill. I cooked nothing and let sit in the fridge instead, the way my grandmother used to make it. Tastes like summer. Thank you Adrienne! I had forgotten how good cucumber salad tastes!

I have made this repeatedly both as written and adapting it for our tastes.  My husband asked that I reduce the sugar to 1/4 c because he likes the bite of the vinegar.  It was perfect for him.   I only use a teaspoon of dill because it was just enough for us.   My dad likes the sweetness so when I make it for him, I follow the recipe.  Using some salt to sweat out some of the liquid in the cucumbers does make them crisper.   I know when my husband and father get a slice of bread to soak up the vinegar and eat it, I have a winning recipe!

Would have given it 5 stars, but had to read about the salt trick in the comment section. Very important step missing from the directions. Other than that...just like grandma used to make. Delish!

I've made this twice this week because My kids, yes my kids take this for lunch now and they Ask for it! If it is green and they ask for it then its a great choice.  I use 5 cucumbers and 2 large RED onions for the kidos. After it sits for a few hours I dump the liquid or it gets too vinegary for them. Extra Dill Weed. We love the dill. And I use Raw sugar not white. part of our weekly meal plans now.

This was awesome, following the advice of others, I added salt to the cucumber slices and refrigerated for two hours and drained the excess water. I don't even like cucumber salad because of the vinegar, but I loved it and will make again.  I also used garden fresh picked cucumbers.  Cut the dill to suit our tastes.  Will be making this regularly!! Thanks for posting.  UPATED: after making this many times, I found draining the excess water/vinegar I added sour cream to taste and chilled.  Albsolutly fabulous if you prefer the sour cream type cucumbers like my hubby does.

Delicious & easy to prepare!  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  
This recipe reminds me of my Grandmother's cucumber salad.  I've made it twice & the second time I used red onion.

I've tried many different recipes for cucumber salad, and this one packs the most flavor. I guess the secret is in boiling the liquid first. Works for us!

My daughter had a grandpa that made this just a certain way that I've spent a decade trying to accomplish.  Definitely one of her favorite comfort foods. Finally this recipe did the trick with one tiny adjustment. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white. It was all I had and I was drowning in cucumbers from the garden.

Very good and easy to make.  I did omit the dill because we just don't like dill but otherwise we followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious paired with our grilled chicken breasts and corn on the cob!

I add more water, vinegar and sugar depending on our taste at that time. We grew up on these sitting in the fridge in a covered container in the liquid solution and added more ingredients as they were eaten as the summer went on. Lots of black pepper too. Just adjust to yr taste. If you don't like it this sweet cut down on the sugar. It is very easy to adjust. We like ours with more vinegar. YOU DO NOT NEED TO BOIL. just put a lil hot water in bowl to dissolve the sugar. That way yr cucs don't have time to wilt n be floppy as others have mentioned. Thanks for the measurements

Just made this for the first time for hubby and I. We loved it! I used Splenda instead of sugar since  hubby is diabetic and we are trying to watch our weight.  We like it with the extra liquid and can't wait to see what it tastes like tomorrow!

We really liked this recipe.  I halved all the ingredients since I was using only 2 cucumbers.  I used a mandoline for the slicing of the cucumber and onion to get thin, consistent slices. For us the best part of this recipe is how crisp the cucumbers remained--even the day after I made it.  Next time I will not change a thing except for perhaps trying some fresh dill.

I love this recipe.  It's finally the end of summer and end of fresh cucumbers from the garden.  I think I made this recipe about 7 times throughout the season this year.  Just can't get enough of it.

This dish has been a big hit at potlucks and in the family.  I have had several requests for the recipe!  I did salt and drain the cucumbers before using so that the marinade had a greater chance to flavor the salad later.  I used some monster cuke's from the garden and seeded them first, and it still turned out wonderful!

One tip: You really need to salt the cucumbers before making the rest of the recipe to draw out excess water. I don't salt ANYTHING but I won't skip this step with this recipe. For all of the reviewers who ended up with too much liquid, I think this is why. I used 2 english cucumbers, sliced them thin and then sprinkled one tablespoon salt over them and covered with plastic wrap for 2 hours. You wouldn't believe how much water this pulls out of the cukes. Pour all of the water off (don't rinse) and continue with the recipe. It is absolutely unnecessary to boil anything -just pour everything over the cukes after salting and let set in fridge overnight. Wonderful!

I made this and it was the best cucumber salad I had ever eaten.  Anytime I've had company this summer we have enjoyed this dish, and All company has asked me for the recipe.  I did not boil any ingredients, but made the day before and let everything sit in the fridge overnight.  I also used English Cucumbers  as I believe they have less moisture in them.

I didnt think I was going to like this, but I had to remind myself I was looking for something different than the creamier side of salads.  But I have family too so I made it.  

It was awesome and my family loved.  It's now one of my favs.

Good stuff

I did not chang a thing to this recipe.   I always try it the way they are posted, and if I think it needs more less then I do it.

Forgot to say, easy to make as well.

I used a red onion instead of white and cut down the sugar a bit. It was still too sweet. Next time I will use even less sugar.

i changed the recipe slightly. I tossed my vegetables in extra virgin olive oil and kosher salt before I add ed the liquid. I used pampered chef dill seasoning admonished with  cracked black pepper.

Very tasty.  I wanted a salad that wasn't typical and easy to make.  I made a few changes, though.  I omitted the water simply because the cucumbers make their own water even after salting them.  I substituted rice vinegar and Vidalia onions for their light taste, I added a splash of canola oil (would've used olive if I had it), and I added red, yellow and green peppers.  It turned out superb!  My 'carnivore' husband and 13 yr old even liked it.  This week it'll be easy for me to get them to eat veggies.  Thanks Adrienne!

Very good cucumber salad. I would reduce the sugar a bit next time but it was still delicious made with my garden cucumbers and a fresh onion.

I love this recipe, and have made it many times.It is easy to halve for a small batch too. I usually add extra pepper and some ground celery too. Tonight I am going to use the dressing and spices on a mix of thinly sliced onions, shredded cucumbers, and shredded cooked beets. I think it will be delish. Thanks for sharing!

Love it. Great for using up big batches of cucumbers in the fall when they all ripen at the same time.  My suggestion, lots of salt, easy on the sugar.

This was really good! We ate it after if sat in the fridge for just a little while, and I can tell it's one of those recipes that just gets better the longer it sits. I can't wait to taste it tomorrow! The tangy-ness and the sweetness were balanced just right. This was a quick and easy recipe to make and will go well with my lunches this week since there was quite a bit left. Thank you for the recipe!

My husband is a cuke freak, and I made this for him with all the extra cukes out of the garden.  It is very simple, and he loved it.  We discovered that the longer it sits, the better it is.  Since there are only two of us, it took us several days to eat it up.  The first day it was good, the third day it was delicious!  Nothing fancy, just a nice, simple salad that hits the spot.

This was different but just not my thing. I've never had cucumber salad before and decided to try it. I don't think I'd make this again. FYI--I followed the recipe.

I chose this recipe because it looked very similiar to my husband's grandmother's recipe.  To more closely imitate her recipe,  I reduced the sugar and added a little dried mustard, onion salt, pepper and paprika. I think the additional seasoning really gives it the extra flavor that might be missing in the original version.

Love this recipe! Was the closet to what my mom used to make.  Brings back wonderful childhood memories fro visiting my grandma and grandpa in Tennessee. Cucumber salad like this was always on the table. 

I only had one cucumber though.. Next time I'll make sure to have more.

I agree 100% with Lauren Garges "sweating" the cukes for one hour before making salad and I did not cook the pickling sauce as well, turned out super!  Thanks for the receipe JSchmand.

I found this recipes to be a very good blend of sweet/sour.  I use very large cucumbers (normally I would give them a toss in the garden) & white onions; let them set for a day and they excited my taste buds.  I did not have any dill seed, so I used celery seed.

Everyone liked the sweet and tangy flavor especially my kids. Everyone had seconds. I did salt my dukes and onions first for 2+hours, drained and rinsed the salt.

I don't usually rate recipes, but this one is a keeper.  I followed the recipe exactly, but left mine in the fridge for 2 days-  and they were more like a pickle than a cucumber salad,  which although not what the recipe is supposed to be,  I loved.  I will note i used baby cukes (slightly larger than pickling cucumbers,  and actually dill seed instead of dill, because I realized when i went to add it that I was out of dried dill).  the dill seed works perfectly as a side note. I am making a second batch this weekend,  and will try adding a clove or two of garlic, and reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup to make them a little more spicy. this is a great base recipe, you could add whatever you like to,  jalapenos, peppercorns, whatever you like to suit your taste.

Love the simplicity & freshness of this recipe. I scale it down to 1/4 recipe to make one serving to go with fish. Instead of sugar, I use Splenda packets for sweetener & it works fine. Be sure to taste & adjust flavors as you go along. The dressing tastes pretty bland at first, but after marinating the salad for an hour -- excellent!

After using this recipe a few times I decided I wanted to drop the sugar. I revised the recipe, no onion, white vinegar, water, sugar or dill. Instead, I went to the garden picked tomatoes, bell peppers and a couple hot peppers, diced them all along with the hybrid cucumbers (any proportion of these veggies works), added a pinch of dried oregano and basil and sprinkled just a little rice vinegar on it.  I know, totally changed the recipe, but my family loves it and so do I.

I'm Malaysian. This recipe is very similar with our traditional cucumber salad for us here especially Malays. Our secret is we have to mix vinegar, sugar and salt with onion first. Then mix well the cucumber slices. Put aside in fridge before serving.

I love this salad more than chocolate. I typically end up adding an extra tablespoon or two of water to balance the vinegar, and I don't normally heat the liquids...just let it sit longer in the fridge before digging in. This dish is fantastic in its simplicity.

I must have nailed this one on the first try, because it's just phenomonal!!  I did increase the ingredients outside of the cukes to make more liquid...  I can't stop eating it!  It doesn't hurt that I used my own home-grown cukes and onions.  Thanks for posting!

I've grown up with this as a staple side dish and have always loved it in these warmer summer months... I found the recipe here for some direction and was very pleased with the outcome...  I did lighten up on the vinegar and added young tomatoes off the vine... Great summer dish!!!!

Delicious!  I needed a quick tailgate dish.  I only had white balsamic vinegar so, I used that.  Quick, inexpensive and so yummy...definitely a dish that I will use on a regular basis!

A good recipe, but a little too sweet for my taste even though I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. I will make it again, but I'll use a little less than 1/2 cup of sugar.

Absolutely delicious!  Exactly what I was looking for.  I usually make a creamy sweet dressing for cucumbers, but we're having a bumper crop this year and I wanted something a bit different.  This was PERFECT!  The recipe was absolutely yumtastic.  I made one change...I only used 2 cucumbers instead of 4 and it was the perfect amount for us!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Too sugary (even after reducing the sugar), too vinegary (and I like vinegar) and too watery.  Like a sweet pickle soup.

Too much vinegar. If I used this recipe again, I would decrease the vinegar and the dill and increase the cucumbers.

As it would figure I made this before I read the reviews. That made me pretty nervous as to how good this would actually be...but it is great!! The only changes I made was to use 2 T of sugar and no dill (none in the house right now). I added the salt and pepper after mixing it all cause I forgot but it was all delicious!! Will do this again!!

Wow, these cucumbers are addicting! I didn't have regular vinegar, so I used rice vinegar, and I also added salt to help cut the sweetness some. Will definately be making this regularly!

I used the calculator to cut this recipe down to serve 2.  I also salted the cucumbers and let them sit for a while before rinsing thoroughly with cold water to wilt them a bit.  Hubby and I both thought it was a nice change, it was good.

Yum! I changed this a bit to make it more like the cucumber salad from Fresh Market. I used red onion, rice vinegar, and fresh dill, and also added cherry tomatoes. Came out delicious! A bit too sweet though, maybe use a little less sugar.

I have never made a cucumber salad before and I am trying to eat a little better. So this was the first one I printed out. I thought it was great. A little too liquidy and I think the next time I make it I am going to put the dill in with the vinegar, water, sugar mix.

Great and refreshing. It's just like the stuff my mother makes. The only downful is the amount of liquid that covers the vegtables. Both times I mae it I had to add additional water/vinegar solution (at least double) because it is not enough to cover the veggies.

I have been looking for a cucumber recipe for a while. When i found this one, it caught my eye. Instead of sugar i used Splenda and it came out awesome. Using the Splenda cut the calories about 75%.  (Even using regular sugar the calories were low now i can eat more without feeling guilty.)

Awesome salad, always a hit! The only changes I made were to use Bermuda Onions... the purple color looks beautiful with the green cucumbers and I did put some scallion in there as well... looks beautiful, tastes amazing! Can't tell you how many times I've given this recipe out!

This was yummy. A nice combination of sweet and tangy. I didn't have the dill and it still worked. Only had an hour and a half of marinating and still got raves from the dinner guests. I will use red onions next time and perhaps add some peppercorns to the mix!

Great recipe, I added red bell pepper thinly sliced, used fresh dill and parsley finely chopped and substituted the sugar with Apriva and this was the best salad I ever had.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I also found that it wasn't necessary to cook it but I used hot (not boiling) water to disolve the sugar.  It was neither too vinegary or too sweet.  It had the perfect blend.  It is also nice without the dill (I forgot to add it).  However, I will try it again with.

Wow - really good. I haven't even let it marinate yet and already can't keep my fork out of the bowl. Definitely only need the 1/4 cup of sugar, may reduce further the next time but great flavor.

This was a huge hit at our last BBQ.  My hubby is very critical and he even asked me to make it the next day.  I did use fresh dill as suggested by others.

This recipe is a keeper.  Just made it for company and received compliments from everyone!  I have tried this recipe replacing the sugar with splenda.  While not as good as the original recipe, it is still tasty with splenda.

Great, easy recipe! I made the following changes:  decreased sugar to 1/2 cup, used scallions instead of onion, and added thin-sliced green pepper (I had a small one from the garden). Delicious!

I have made this dozens of times. It has become my go to salad for BBQs and picnics. I normally cool the liquids before adding them to the cucs and onions. I like the vegies to remain crisp. It's great the way it is or it's fun to change the type of vinegar or use a red onion. I've even added a thinly sliced granny smith apple before for a fun twist.

Great recipe!  So easy and the kids just loved it.  I do have to remove most of the dill from the kids servings, though.  They like the taste of it, just not the look :-). Thanks for sharing!

I've made this great recipe abut 10 times.  Here's how to make it even better with fewer calories and easier to make:  Stir together in one small bowl: 1/2 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup splenda (or sugar if you don't have splenda), 1/4 cup water and as much dill as you'd like (I prefer about 3 tablespoons to give it a strong dill flavor).  Do not heat and set aside liquid.  Peel two large cucumbers leaving some of the green skin on the cucumbers for color.  Slice cucumbers thinly.  Put cucumbers in sealable plastic baggie.  Thinly slice one large red onion (again for color) and mix with your hand with the sliced cucumbers.  Pour liquid in baggie over cucumbers and onion and seal baggie.  Put in frig to cool and marinade.  Excellent refreshing salad with almost no calories.

Crispy and refreshing.  I used seasoned rice vinegar and added a little sriracha sauce, reduced the sugar, and let it sit for quite a while.  Still enjoying it 2 days later :-)

This is the best cucumber salad I have ever had. I used celery seed in place of the dried dill adding it to the brine before boiling it which helped soften the seeds.

So good, since I am diabetic I used  2 cukes, 1/2 c. white vinegar, 1/4 c water, 1/4 c. Splenda & 1/2 teasp. dill.  I did not boil the brine as Splenda desolves quite readily.  Both my husband and I liked it better than one that a friend makes.

What a wonderful and simple recipe!  My husband doesn't care for cucumber salad - but he liked this so much, he asked me to make it again 3 days later!  I also used apple cider vinegar and fresh dill.  Might try it next time with red bell pepper too...

Great, easy recipe. Served it at a BBQ and everyone liked it. I skipped the sugar altogether, used apple cider vinegar instead, replaced dried dill with fresh dill and added tomatoes.

This is such a quick and easy recipe, I used green onions instead of white because my sister doesn't do well with raw onions...and it worked out well. I may cut down to 1/2 cup of sugar next time, it was yummy but just a little too sweet for my taste.

I have done this very similar style salad the only difference with my salad is that I actually grate the cucumbers. And when possible I use English cucumbers. I have never added the dill either.

I used the suggestion about using 1 tablespoon of salt to draw out the excess water from the cucumbers.  Worked like a charm and I didn't have white vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar and put the dill in with the boiling liquid.  Added a few tomatoes.  My boyfriend at it up like there was no tomorrow.  We loved it so much that I'll make it exactly the same way next time!

My dad made this all the time when I was growing up it's one of my favorite salads. If you want to make this even easier use seasond rice vinegar instead of vinegar and sugar. That's how my dad makes it and I don't use the dill but that's just how me and my dad like it.

I love this stuff.  I salted the cucumbers with Penzey's shallot salt and after an hour squeezed out more than a cup of liquid.  I didn't add water to the white balsamic vinegar that I used and substituted Splenda for the sugar.  I took this to work for lunch and everyone wanted to taste it.  Eeeeew!  Boy cooties.  LOL I was happy to share and everyone loved it as much as I did and wanted the recipe.

For some reason, I rebelled and added a cup of sugar instead of 3/4 a cup. Mistake! Was too sweet. If i'd of done it right, it would have been perfect.  that constant sweet tooth of mine.

These were pretty sugary.  I think they are very good...just can't eat a whole lot of them in one sitting.  Less sugar would prolly get a 5 star rating from me.

I liked the flavor but I don't think I would call it a salad. My family thought they were pickles and they did taste like it. I'd serve it as a side, but not as a salad.

I love this recipe!  I have been making a recipe almost identical to it for several years now.  Instead of white vinegar, I used apple cider vinegar.  I think it has more flavor and is sweeter.  I have never added dill to this recipe before and next time I will add about half the amount.  I love dill, but it was definitely overpowering.

A bit sweet for my taste, I do like the tang though. I think a little salt might've helped a bit as well. I threw in some shrimp too - they would've added more had I marinated them in some spice. I think I'll try to make this again sometime, but probably reduce the sugar (or artificial sweetener) a bit.

I read some of the reviews and used less sugar.  I made this for most of the summer to have on hand for a side dish.  When the cucumbers were super abundant in the garden I made batches to bring to work and it was always cleaned out. Very easy and tasted like a pickle which I love.

Great taste, but too much sugar.  Next time I make this I will try 1/2 cup or less, instead of the recommended 3/4 cup of sugar.  But they held up very well for a couple of weeks in the fridge.  Tasted like the old fashioned "Bread and Butter" pickles my mom used to make.

I love this recipe but made a couple of changes.  First I used spring onion (family's preference).  Second my husband is diabetic, so I substituted pourable Splenda for the sugar and it tastes great.  I've made it both ways and can't tell the difference. Thanks for a tasty way to use up some of our huge cucumber crop! And with nearly no calories!

Very good!  I just tossed everything together and replaced the 1 cup of sugar with 1/2 cup splenda - No need for the extra calories!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful. The perfect tangy side dish. I have made this many times this summer and wouldn't change a thing!

I gave this 4 stars because my husband liked it so much, but I thought it was on the sweet side so I did not rate 5 stars. It's too Bitter Sweet for me. I think you must need a lot of cucumbers, I used about 5 big ones and still too sweet, or something...I can't put my finger on it, but possibly there is too much vinegar and I would also try it less sugar next time. Needs work.

My family loves this recipe.  I don't heat anything when I make it, just let it sit in fridge for a few hours & it tastes great! My kids eat this for a snack when I make enough for leftovers.

This recipe was good, but way too much sugar!  Next time I will try about half as much sugar.

It was very pretty but way too twangy.  Next time I will add less vinegar and more water.

Loved the ease of this recipe... Used a red onion, and red wine vinegar... Was a big hit.  Made "Peppy's Pita Bread" and " Seans Falafel and Cucumber sauce" from this site... :-)

Wonderful Salad!

Excellent easy recipe.  Made the second time with Red Wine vinegar and went light on the onions.  The family liked it much better that way.

Perfect!! Used Splenda and food processor for very thin slices so I didn't peel them. I used 3 7" cukes.

What a perfect salad for all those summertime cucumbers.  I only used 2/3rd cup white vinegar and 1/4 cup white sugar based on other reviewers' suggestions.  And the best part is you make it ahead of time!

I made this for a 4th of July get together and everyone raved about it! I used a little less vinegar and only about half the dill. It turned out great.

The Ukrainians I served it to thought it was delicious.  Although the flavor was good, but the vinegar was too strong for me and my husband.  Next time I'll try some of the adjustments suggested by other reviewers.  Overall, nice & easy salad.

Really good.  I was looking for a recipe that resembled my Grandma's cucumber salad that we had at almost every meal.  This isn't quite it, but still quite yummy.  Used alittle more dill and I just heated the sugar/vinegar/water til sugar dissolved - didn't boil.  Better the next day.

Wonderful, simple recipe.  Just like I used to have with a summer supper growing up in the South!  I don't always have fresh dill to add but it's still great without it. This is a staple for our family.

This is not a salad in the way that some people think of salads.  This is a southern cucumber and vinegar mix...my grandmother would always make something like this in the summer to have around to snack on.  This was a great twist on it and I enjoyed the taste.

This recipe is great! I used about one quarter of the sauce to season my cucumbers an onions and added a little salt. I keep extra sauce in the fridge for use anytime.

This turned out great.  I did not heat the sauce.  I just mixed the ingredients together until the sugar dissolved and poured over the cucumbers which I peeled before slicing.  I then let is marinate all day.

So glad I tried this recipe. I was only cooking for two and I only had one very large cucumber,so,  it worked out great and I can't wait to make it again. (For the onion I used a vidalia onion & 1/2 tablespoon of dill)

I left out the dill because I didn't have any -- maybe that made the difference?  Just tasted sweet to me-- but my kids (5 and 8y) loved it, probably because it was sweet.  Might make it again, just because it was easy and a nice change.  My kids will eat cucumbers just as happily plain, though, so not sure the added sugar is worth it.

I made it for all of my house-mates (there are nine!) and everyone loved it!

I would recommend using 4 or 5 cucumbers for this.

This recipe is really yummy. I changed it a little though. I don't like raw onions so I added the onions to the boiling sauce and let sit for a couple minutes to partially cook the onions to get rid of the bitterness. I also used apple cider vinegar instead of regular. 
Very yummy - will use for many more dinners.

I used two English hothouse cucumbers, cut back the sugar to a half cup, used fresh dill and a large vidalia onion.  I also didn't boil the mixture first, but rather put it all in a bowl and let everything dissolve.  It still tasted great and was less to clean up!  I still thought there was a bit too much liquid, so next time I would use three hothouse cucumbers.  Despite all of my changes, this was still a great recipe!  It's so easy to throw together in the morning--then you just let it sit and work its magic until dinner.  This was a hit--thanks for the great recipe!

This is just what a cucumber salad should be.  The only thing I change around is the dill; I use fresh.  I took this recently to a family BBQ, and it was a hit all around.

Next time I'll cut back a little on the sugar.  Very  good recipe for using up the cucumbers.  Cool and refreshing change! May 24, 2009 - Once again, made this to take to a cookout.  It was a big hit!

Just wonderful..made this salad for a family party and it was gone in no time! I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and found the longer it sets, the better it gets. I'm planning on keeping a bowl of this salad in my frig all summer.

I was looking for a vinager based cucumber salad for my fresh from the farmer's market cucumbers.  I made a few modifications such as fresh dill, and I used less sugar like 1/2 c.  I would probably even reduce that more to like 1/4 c. sugar next time.  I had to add more vinager, b/c I thought it was too sweet at first.  This was even better the next day.

Great recipe if you are looking for a non sour cream/yogurt based cucumber salad.  I used apple cider vinegar in place of the white.  I think next time I may increase the sugar to a full cup.

Yummy!! So super easy and tastes great!! My only problem, and it's not really a problem, is that I don't like the way the dill looks in this. Probably next time I will omit it all together. Thanks so much for this! It's a nice change to your standard lettuce salad.

This is an awesome summertime dish when grilling out or for family picnics! It is a good idea to scoop out the seeds from the cucumbers or buy uses seedless.  I found that the original recipe is a little on the sweet side, so I cut down on the sugar a bit.

Excellent...I didn't use the dill as I was hoping this recipe would be similiar to my grandmother's recipe that she used and it was.  Everyone loved it and is begging me to make more and more often.

This salad tasted like summer!  It does make a huge amount of liquid with it though, I used 5 large cucumbers and I had to pour some liquid away after I added it to the cucumbers.  Just a perfect salad for a bbq, especially since it doesn't have to stay as cold as most salads since it isn't dairy based.  It is much fresher and lighter than most salads, but still very flavorful.  It would go great with any bbq meal.

Whoops.  I didn't read the instructions and just tossed all the ingredients together in a bowl.  It still turned out great, the sugar dissolved nicely and it marinated well even though not heated first.  Next time, I'll heat it before dumping on the cukes!

I made a big batch of this last night to take camping.  It seemed a little sweet so I added a bit more vinegar and left it in the fridge overnight.  This morning it was unbelievably tasty.  A perfect camping salad.

Excellent recipe. The only thing I changed was leaving out the dill. Otherwise it's just like my mom used to make!
