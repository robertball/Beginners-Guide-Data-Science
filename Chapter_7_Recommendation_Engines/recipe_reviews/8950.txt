I gave this recipe 4 stars because the basis was great but it needed some tweaking.  I precooked the chicken in a skillet with a little olive oil, salt, pepper and a pinch of cayenne.  I doubled the sauce, added the green pepper, onion and added pineapple tidbits and cooked them all together for approximately 15 minutes to soften the veggies and then added the chicken and about 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  It turned out wonderfully, sweet but with a kick from the pepper flakes.  I served it with fried rice (brown rice with fresh peas, green onion and carrot) and a nice green salad.  My husband and his family loved it.

Very good and extremely simple.  I only gave it a 4 star, because we added 1/4 C of coconut milk to the sauce and it would NOT have been nearly as good without it.  The coconut milk gave it a nice island flavor that was so creamy and delicious!

I made this for 60 people that I invited to a Luau.  It was fast to make and every bite was gone! I made it the day before,cut up the veggies and cooked chicken.  made the sauce, and stored over night. mixed it all together the day of the party and put it in a pan over warmers...by the time of the party it was ready.  I didn't bake it at all.  Served it over rice...it was a big hit  Thanks Marty.  Everyone thought I spent hours on it.

This was good! It did not "WOW" me. I doubled the sauce, decreased the brown sugar by 1 Tablespoon, cooked the chicken with some garlic and onion then added the peppers in for about 3-5 minutes and added red chili flakes. Without the chili flakes I do not think I would have liked it as much. I will make it again with my changes.

I don't normally review recipes when I don't follow them exactly.  However, I hope that I might help fellow busy parents out and share the tweaks that I have made to make this a quick weeknight meal.  First I seasoned boneless skinless thighs with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder and I put them on the gas grill.  In the meantime I made the sauce as stated in the recipe. (added crushed red pepper to taste; used fresh ginger and garlic) I chopped the green pepper, onion and water chestnuts and sauteed all three in olive oil. I mixed the veggies and sauce together and spooned over the grilled chicken.  Served with white rice... Quick easy weeknight dinner in a 1/2 an hour.

This is awesome.  I didn't have pineapple juice, but I did have a 20 oz can of pineapple slices (in heavy syrup, which I didn't know at the time).  I just used that juice (plus 1 cup of water) and cut up the pineapples into it and left out the pepper.  Because of my kids, I cut the onion really small and cooked it and some garlic (instead of garlic salt) with the chicken.  I also doubled the sauce.  The only thing I had to go with it was bowtie pasta, but it was super.  Couldn't get enough of it.  I will be making this again a lot.  It was super easy to do and the pineapple chunks made a big difference.  The water chestnuts gave it a great crunch.  Once again, it was great (and great leftover - I just had some for lunch)

Tried this for my kids birthday luau and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I used fresh garlic and gingerroot and I think that made it even better.  For the kids sake, I didn't add any onions or bell peppers.  I'm sure it would have been even better with it.  I wouldn't call this recipe really quick, but it wasn't a big deal to make.  Try it!

Needs a little extra, but it is good. What I did to make it better, was to shake the raw chicken chunks in a bowl with flour and a bit of salt. Then I cooked the pieces in a skillet with a bit of olive oil. I proceeded as directed but when it was all done cooking I tasted it and something was missing. I didn't have pineapple chunks (it needs it) so I added pineapple preserves and crushed red pepper flakes. Then, it was much better.

I cooked the chicken (only three breasts) with a little salt, pepper and cayenne in a splash of chicken broth first, then added the (full amount) onions and peppers until tender.  Meanwhile I made the sauce(full amount), adding pineapple tidbits, simmering for five minutes.  Then I combined the two and added red pepper flakes.  I transferred to a casserole dish and baked for an hour, then topped with sliced green onions and sliced almonds.  The almonds were an excellent addition, the whole thing was delicious.

This is a great recipe that I will be adding to my favorites.  I made it for a luau and doubled the other ingredients but tripled the sauce ingredients so I would have more for on the side to add to the white rice if needed.  The only thing I changed was I put one can of bamboo shoots and one can of water chestnuts and used green, red and yellow peppers to equal two peppers for more color.  I would recommend this recipe

This is excellent!!
I love pineapple and took the suggestion to add Pineapple tidbits to the sauce.  It was really, really good and made lots.  I was able to freeze 1/2 of it for another day for my family of 4.

this recipe was incredibly bland. the sauce was okay, nothing bad about it, but it tasted like a very mild sweet teriyaki. 

i doubled the sauce because it didn't seem like enough, but it doubled while it was cooking, so if i ever made this again i would not double it. i put the chicken in a pan and layered bell peppers, carrots, onions and pineapple. not sure if i'd ever make this again, the sauce was just so plain! thanks anyway :)

DELICIOUS and EASY - my 2 favorite words!  I added pineapple rings with maraschino cherries in the center just to make the dish look more hawaiian and it definately did the trick.  I think next time I'll add chunked pineapples to the mix and make extra sauce.

Loved it!  Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 though is that it definitly needed the sauce doubled and a little heat from some added red pepper flakes.  Husband loved it!

Good easy meal.  I added pineapple chunks and pepper flakes to dish.  I didn't pre-cook the chicken, I figured an hour in the oven would cook it fully (shortcut).  I did double the sauce recipe.

This was good and easy to make.  Next time, I would maybe rub some ginger into the chicken before cooking it to give it a little more flavor.  Also added chunks of pineapple to the sauce to give it a little more zing.

I made this for me and my 9 year old son tonight for dinner and we both really enjoyed it. Of course I scaled it down since it was just the two of us, but I put the full amount of water chestnuts in. It was delicious!

Excellent!  I didn't use the peppers or onions - my family doesn't like them.  I browned chicken breasts that were pounded thin in a little olive oil in an oven proof skillet, then whisked in all the sauce ingredients in the pan and simmered for a few minutes.  I then added water chestnuts & crushed pineapple, and put the uncovered skillet in the oven to finish cooking the chicken - 375 for about 10 minutes.  Served over white rice.  Hubby asked me to add to the rotation!

Deee-licious!  I followed LatinaCook's recommendation and coated the raw chicken with flour and a little salt (I used garlic salt) and pan fried it in a little olive oil.  I definitely think that made a big difference!  I minced green and red peppers, onions, and sweet potato and added it to the sauce before coating the chicken.  Next time I would leave the onions sliced for a little texture/crunch.  I also doubled the sauce, and it hardly covered the chicken even with the doubled sauce and veggies.  I served over white rice but brown rice, quinoa, and pasta would work too.  I will definitely make it again - hubbie and I both thought it was restaurant quality!

This meal was yummy, but did not "wow" us.  I took the suggestions of many and doubled the sauce, added 1 extra T of brown sugar, and added more veggies.  Probably not top on our list to make soon, but will definitely try again.

This is one of those recipes that is completely over rated based on people making changes to it before rating it, because as it is, it's not very good at all.  There is not enough sauce, and the little sauce there is doesn't have enough "zing" to compensate for the blandness of the chicken, green peppers, and water chestnuts.    It's not terrible by any means, but it doesnt warrant the high rating without modification imo.

This turned out just wonderful.  My luau guests gave it rave reviews.  I tried to double the recipe and the sauce came out a little runny, but it tasted great!

Used a can of pineapple chunks. Left out the ketchup and cornstarch. Used fresh ginger. Served it over quinoa though brown rice would be good too. Turned out great and will be making it again!

I thought this was a really good healthy dish. The only thing I added was about a 1/4 cup of coconut milk, like a reviewer suggested. Very good, next time I will add some pineapple chunks!

This is a good, easy dish. The chicken pieces don't need to be cooked before you put the dish in the oven. I used less chicken (2 large breasts) and they cooked through in the casserole dish in about 45 minutes. I also added some pineapple chunks and ground red pepper. My husband loved it but the reason I gave it four stars is that I found it too sweet for dinner and couldn't eat much at once.

I am no fan of chicken so for a recipe to be good enough for ME to give it 5 stars it really needs to knock my socks off. This one did the trick.  Before cooking the chicken I infused the oil with dried chilis.  I did as others suggested and doubled the sauce. I used fresh ginger as well as freshly crushed garlic. For added zip I added crushed red pepper. I think it would have been pretty bland without it. I served it over steamed rice. I will be making this one a lot!

Thought this was a pretty good recipes.  Taste was similar to a jarred sauce but I'd still make this recipe as it was simple!  My only changes was to add minced garlic instead of garlic salt and added fresh pineapple...great flavors!

I felt like I have had this before and it could have easily been achieved with a bottled sauce.  It was definitly good, but not worth the work or the wait.

I just Love it!

To be perfect try addind a green chille(it urges for some spice)
Try also with uncooked chicken breasts instead of cooked, 1 tablespoon of ginger (instead of 1/4) and give it a final touch with some drops of olive oil just before baking. WOW!!!!

I felt the sauce was too little in both amount and taste.  It seemed promising but the finished product was not.  I wish it could have had a little more "zing" to it but was just bland.  If I ever made this again, I would probably add red pepper flakes like someone suggested but I doubt I'll try this recipe again.  Also for anyone trying this recipe, I would recommend doubling the prescribed amount of sauce.

This dish was a little too sweet for me, but I gave it four stars because it's so unusual. Next time I make it I will probably leave out the brown sugar. I think it needs a little heat.

I followed the recipe exactly, it smelled heavenly while cooking but like one of the other members I found it just missing a bit of zip, if you like a bit more spice I would marinate the chicken breast in a combo of 2 tbsp of white wine plus 2 tbsp of soy and a pinch of garlic and ginger for a while first and in the sauce I would add just a pinch of hot pepper flakes (or one small diced pickled pepper) to give it a bit more depth of flavour. My kids think they don't like onion so maybe next time I might use 2 tbsp of dehydrated onion so they can't see the chunks LOL

One word - tasty!!! My boyfriend and I are huge fans of sweet and sour chicken so I made this for him the other night. I doubled the sauce mixture and boiled it, then marinated the chicken in it for about an hour or so. I then put everything in a skillet and cooked it on the stovetop. Instead of using a whole onion, I only used about half. Also, as other users have suggested, I put the pineapple in the sauce, not just the pineapple juice. This was a very tasty, very simple meal to make. It was great with steamed rice and the extra sauce! I will most definitely be making this again - thanks for the recipe! :)

Delicious!  This was easy and wonderful.  I fried the onion and green pepper a bit with the chicken before I put it in the oven.  I didn't need to cook it the whole hour.  My whole family loved it.

this was very good. I used orange juice which was all I had on hand. I doubled the sauce and added hot pepper flakes. Will make again.Thanks Marty.Also I used 1 can sliced water chestnuts that has to be a typo and it does not say how much onion but I used 1/2 of a vidalia. I used boneless breasts and baked for 1/2 hour.

We fixed this recipe for our Luau theme meal at a nursing home.  We used boneless, skinless chicken breast instead of whole pieces, and left out the water chesnuts.  We got so many compliments!  Quite a hit!

The sauce was very good and the chicken was easy to prepare.  We used 4 chicken breasts and fried them in Pam and then cooked the sauce and poured it over.  It was good.
