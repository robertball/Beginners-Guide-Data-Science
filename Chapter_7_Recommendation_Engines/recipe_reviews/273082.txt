I would not consider this a cheesecake but it is tasty. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because the center, (although cooked all the way and the bottom was a nice golden brown) was completely mushy. If baked longer it would have started to burn. The outer part I was able to cut into squares but I wound up scooping up and throwing the center  away. This recipe has  good flavor and potential but I won't be the one experimenting with it. Sorry.

I've made this twice now, and I really like this recipe for snacks or a quick grab-and-go breakfast. The second time I made it, I added a can of cherry pie filling on top of the cream cheese mixture before I put down the second crescent roll dough. I think it came out a lot tastier, with a better balance of flavor.

I used Hawaiian bread croissant roll. It was good but I am going to experiment with other flavor of croissants.

I made this according to the recipe and it turned out really great.  To me it tastes just like a lovely cheese danish.  The cheesecake portion was lovely & lemony and not too sweet (which I like)!!  YUMMY.

I will definitely make this again, unbelievably yummy. Crisp on the outside, smooth lemony cheesecake inside, so good.

Delicious! Next time, however, I’ll refrigerate for at least one hour before serving.

I made this for our church fellowship gathering. There was not a crumb left. Members came up to me saying how good it was and could I make it again? The only change I made was I used the extra hearty  crescent  rolls. That seemed to make them easier to pick up. They were delicious!

First of all, I love it and the fact it's so easy. The only thing I did, to add was I sprinkled powdered sugar on top. Thanks for the recipe.

I gave this 4 stars because it is very similar to the Sopapilla cheesecake squares I just made and Everyone Loved them!! The difference was you melt 1 stick of butter and mix 1/2 cup of sugar with a tablespoon of cinnamon drizzle the melted butter on the top of the pastry and sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar and bake 30-35 mins 350 
Bam!! Amazing  if it is too much sugar for your tastes you can always cut it back!! I also used the whole egg in my filling and no need for egg white on top!

So easy to make and very delicious!  I followed the recipe and the only thing I would add is to refrigerate before serving so that the filling can set and it does not run when cut.  Makes it easier to tray up.   I will definitely add this to my brunch repertoire.

This is incredibly delish & super easy to make, especially if you have left over cheesecake! I used the flakey crescent rolls, softened 6 slices of Lidl cheesecake, baked for 28 min at 350* & topped with a 3x confectioners sugar/milk drizzle - amazing! My husband had made strawberry compote & I mixed that with a quart of fresh strawberries to add on the side. Perfection. My husband & 3 kids say this is definitely one to keep! Hope my shortcuts help for a quick & easy breakfast (& thanks for this amazing recipe!)

It tasted good but next time I will double the cream cheese filling. Was more crescent taste than cheesecake flavor to my liking.

Very tasty.  Inside turned out for me.  A little dry, and not too sweet.  I cut it into biscotti sized pieces and my 3-year-old gobbled it up.  Will make again.
