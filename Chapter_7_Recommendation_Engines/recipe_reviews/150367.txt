What an interesting recipe! I used fire roasted canned tomatoes instead of fresh and added half a diced onion. For some reason I really wanted jalepenos in this dish so I added 1/2 of a seeded jalepeno, diced. I served this over white jasmine rice with sliced avocado. The avocado was so delicious..the cool rich taste blended so smoothly with the acidic tomatoes and slightly bitter swiss chard. I'd like to try this with mixed beans and fresh mozzarella cheese too. Definitely try this one..It's an unusual but very yummy recipe!

This recipe was amazing.  I followed and earlier suggestion and used black bean instead and loved it! I also omitted the butter just because it felt unnecessary and it didn't seem to affect the flavor at all! It's savory, rich, but not heavy, and the lime adds a great tangy finish.

This tastes wonderful but the recipe calls for one bunch of chard and you actually need two bunches of chard. There are more pinto beans than anything in this recipe. Try two bunches to even out the flavors and a whole package of goat cheese, not just 3 tbsp.

Yum - I was looking for a recipe to use up some stuff from the garden and this was perfect!  I didn't have pinto beans on hand, so I used a can of black beans instead.  This dish has a lot of flavor and color!  I think next time(there will be a next time), I'll double the amount of cooked chard, though, so it's more of a chard recipe than a bean recipe.

This recipe is simple to prepare and tastes great. I used 2 tomatoes instead of one and served it over whole wheat pasta for a really nutritious meal.

I've made this dish a few times and my husband and I love it. We like it best when the recipe is followed exactly.  The few times I did not-it was not as good.  It is a tasty vitamin powerhouse and a great side dish to just about anything.

Quite delicious - these flavors and textures all go really well together, who wouldv'e guessed?? Very easy and quick to make too..I served this as a side with a simple grilled chicken. I seasoned the chicken breasts with some coriander, tarragon, and a roasted garlic/sesame seed oil - YUM! The spices on the chicken really complemented the earthy flavors in the chard dish...and I added a bit of coriander to the chard also - it was yuuummy :). Next time I'll add more garlic and tomatoes just for my taste, but really this recipe is great as it is. Will become a staple for us, definitely!

Followed this almost exactly and couldn't have been happier.  I omitted the butter, subbed safflower oil for vegetable oil, and used feta instead of goat cheese. Just used proportions of beans and cheese to match the amount of chard I had.  Served with eggs and fruit for a nice brunch.  Thanks!

sooo tasty! made very small changes - black eyed peas, no butter, more tomato and chopped the stems, quickly steamed in microwave before adding to saute.  although i added the goat cheese it doesn't need it IMHO. besides, without it (and butter), its is totally vegan, yay!  leftovers are my lunch & i am salivating just thinking about it...yummers!

The goat cheese and lime add a really great, tangy flavor.  This was a great healthy way to get more iron-rich food into my diet.

Fantastic!  We used black beans instead of pinto and chose to use the chard stalks in addition to the leaf.  This is a great dish and can be served as a main dish with a salad.  It would also be great with some rice.  Yum!

Perhaps I shouldn't review this because I altered the recipe.  I didn't have a lime, and instead of using a small tomato I used a can of whole tomatoes crushed and let it simmer until most of the juice was gone. I really LOVED it!  I will make as directed next time.

DELICIOUS! I used black beans, like others, because that's what I had. Also I just used butter, bc I don't need the extra fat. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I think even if you didn't make the changes I made it would still be a 5 star recipe! It's the red pepper + lime + tomato + goat cheese that's really lovely!! The chard stands up to this combo nicely, so I won't sub any other green. I think you could use any bean you wanted. Texturally, black beans, pinto beans, and white beans would all be good. We ate this as a side to white fish. I'm going to serve leftovers with white rice tomorrow, since the rice will soak up the sauce very well.

This is now a staple in our house during swiss chard season.  We sometimes use black beans and it's just as good, and we always serve it over quinoa.  Healthy and delicious!  Thank you for the great addition to our recipe box.

Great blend of flavors!  From an 8-servings version, I cut the oil and butter by 1/3 (to 2T each), added one more clove of garlic, added a third bunch of Swiss chard, cut the pinto beans to 1 1/2 cans, and added one more T of lime juice.  I used heirloom tomatoes that were purplish and very meaty.  I baked it in a 2 1/2 qt casserole dish for 15 minutes.  I took this revised version to a group dinner for 10 people and got rave reviews - and many requests for the recipe.  This could serve as a vegatarian main dish as well.  Thank you, MAHLP1.

Holy Swiss chard! This was amazing!  I used 2 bunches of chard, one extra garlic clove and several generous dashes of red pepper flakes.  I also used more goat cheese than called for (I love it!).  I used the pinto beans as called for but used the canned fire roasted tomatoes, well drained, instead of fresh.  I served this over Uncle Ben's long grain brown and wild rice (the kind in the pouch that you just heat up for a couple of minutes in the microwave) and the nutty flavor of the rice was a perfect compliment for this dish.  My husband and I, yes just the two of us, ate it ALL tonight.  We just couldn't help ourselves, it was soooo good!  I served it as a vegetarian main dish and it was very satisfying (eating all of it may have had something to do with that, however!) I will definitely be making this again and again!  Oh, and this was our first time eating Swiss chard.  It's definitely getting planted in the garden next Spring!

This recipe was just okay, not great.  I was excited because I love many of the ingredients, but it came out just tasting so-so.  It was fine, but not good enough to repeat.

This is a great recipe. I've used pinto, black and cannellini beans and I prefer the cannellini. I've added thawed frozen spinach when I didn't have much Swiss chard in the garden and it was still really good (though not as good as the original recipe). I serve over rice with hot sauce. It's good reheated, too.

I thought this was a really good, different way to use my Swiss Chard from the garden. I did use feta cheese instead of goat cheese as that was what I had on hand...fantastic flovor!

As previously recommended I switched the pinto beans for black beans.  I went a little heavier on the red pepper flakes because my husband and I like a lot of heat.  It was absolutely delicious.  I served it over basmati rice, I loved it.  I didn't put it in the oven as directed.  I thought that was a bit unnecessary.  In a hot pan you can just stir the goat cheese around and it melts just fine.

This was surprisingly delicious, and so easy to prepare! I used kidney beans because I'm not a huge fan of pintos, but I can see how this would really work with the pintos. I used olive oil, and I covered the pan after adding the cheese rather than baking the dish. I thought the lime juice would stand out, but it blended in perfectly. The only change I'd make is to add more chard and tomato. Great combination of flavors!

This was delicious.  I had some left over home made pinto beans, so I used those.  I forgot the lime, but it still tasted great.  I also used sharp white cheddar because I didn't have goat cheese.  Great recipe!

I really enjoyed the combination of flavors in this recipe.  Between the lime juice, the chard, and the goat cheese, it was a beautiful mix of taste.  I served it over a small amount of rice pasta to make it a dinner.  The flavors were a bit too strong for my BF (who prefers blander foods with lots of salt - go figure), but if you like all the ingredients seperately, try this and be pleasantly surprised!

Really delicious.  I was skeptical about how this would taste but my entire family enjoyed it very much.  I didn't have any garlic on hand so i substituted a small shallot.  It was great.

I skipped steps 3 & 4 and we put it in tortillas with Mexican cheese and it was delicious. The kids loved it as a burrito.

I think the goat cheese that I got was a little too strong for my taste. Next time I make it I may use feta, that will give it some tang but I don't think it'll be as strong.
It's a different taste but good.

ok so this was my 1st time cooking and eating chard. It was pretty good. I had to modify the recipe a bit to fit what I had on hand. I used one can black bean, 1/2 can of tomatoes and green chilies and i only had Feta. My son and Boyfriend both ate it they both said it was pretty good.

Used this recipe as a good base for using up about 12 oz of chard from a veggie bin delivery.  I doubled the beans (black), garlic and tomatoes (bean to chard ratio was just right for us at 50/50) and added about 6 oz of feta I had in the fridge.  I only added a T of lime juice, and then added about 2 T of wine to help steam the greens.  Turned out pretty good.  If I make it again - I definitely agree with another reviewer - bacon would be the perfect addition to round out the flavors.  Or some crispy pancetta - must be crispy so I would add to the top just before serving.

This was good.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and 1/8 of a teaspoon of cayanne pepper instead of pepper flakes.  I also used black beans instead of pinto. I also did not melt the goat cheese in the oven - it melted fine in the pan. It didn't look very pretty, but it tasted good.

I omitted the butter and used canned tomatoes and it turned out really tasty.  I also used a half a roasted poblano pepper that I added with the garlic. I didn't bake in the oven, but addeed the goat cheese at serving.  Will definitely use this recipe again.  Makes a good vegetarian entree.

This tasted good.  I used half a can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh.  I think the warm goat milk made my families stomachs' a little upset.

This is great! I've made it with a number of variations.I would recommend  small white beans & fresh tomatoes doubled or tripled!The white beans are more attractive than the reds or blacks. The fresh tomatoes look better too but I need more. I also add more cheese.I use canned if that's all I have. I like the fire roasted diced, drained the best.

This is our favorite way to eat chard. Over the years I've tried this various ways (switching up the beans and the cheese, adding onion, adding chopped chard stem, increasing the amount of chard), but we always like the original recipe the best. I never would have put these flavors together, but somehow it really works!!

A little goat cheese goes a long way in this dish, which is good as it was expensive. I enjoyed the flavors and colors, will make again.

I thought this was just okay. We make a warm white bean salad that is very similar to this but without a green (other than fresh parsley) and it's much better. I didn't like the texture of the chard... thought it was weird.

Excellent! Simple and flavorful. I did use more chard and more cheese. And I just added the cheese at the end and let it sit, covered, in the pan - no baking was necessary. The pintos were very good and I will try black beans next time, as other reviewers suggested. I can see this becoming part of our rotation during chard season. Thanks for sharing!

Ha!  I liked this, but did sub quite a bit: asiago cheese for goat, which I just mixed in near the end and didn't bother baking, was great! lemon juice for lime, hot sauce for pepper flakes, oil for butter, spinach for chard, and canned drained pettite diced tomatoes for tomato. Very tasty and easy!

So great! I used an extra can of beans and will add more chard next time. The flavor was delicious even though I substituted lemon for lime juice and gorgonzola for goat cheese. Can't wait to make for friends and family at our next get-together!

We've been trying more vegetarian recipes and LOVED THIS! My recommendations would be to double the Swiss chard and Goat cheese. Sometimes I use whatever beans I have on hand. Served with crusty bread and it's a great meatless meal!

We found it has too much lime. No-one was crazy about it, but we ate it. Not sure if I will try it again without changing up some things. Which makes it not this recipe if I change it.

This is fabulous with rich textures and easy to make! Love it! I roasted some pine nuts in the first phase of cooking and that was lovely....just a suggestion as the recipe stands on its own.

So far the best chard recipe I've found, but I still don't care for chard

Made it exactly as stated...except...I used dried/rehydrated pinto beans...I loved the firm texture of the beans against the soft Swiss chard and tomatoes!!

Talk about inspirational! I made this with some leftovers from our CSA and added onion and mozzarella cheese to it. One bite with tortilla chips and my husband was spouting about how good it would be in tacos, omelets, and as a chip dip (which is how we ended up eating it). Love this recipe will make it again in a heart beat. Also we did double the Swiss chard and used black beans as that was all I had, really a versatile dish.

I thought that this was very good. I like to mix things together. I used only 1 garlic clove and a large shallot. I didn't have enough lime juice so I added a little lemon juice. Because I only had one bunch of Swiss chard, I didn't add the whole can of pinto beans, and used a mixture of cherry tomatoes,(approx. 1 cup). I didn't have any goat cheese so I used around 1/3 cup Boursin garlic and herb cheese. My husband loved it, he likes to mix everything on his plate together. I think that you can change the beans, the cheese, and the greens to accommodate the season or your pantry.

I had a half can of tomato paste called for another recipe and I accidentally used it in this recipe instead of the Roma tomatoes I had planned, but one of my daughters said it was excellent anyway. Delicious with a nice kick!

I used garlic olive oil instead of the vegetable oil and butter and sautéed onions, mushrooms with the garlic and red pepper flakes. I didn't have a full bunch of swiss chard so I combined what I had left with beet greens and added approximately 1/4 cup of fresh basil leaves. Definitely a keeper and I will share with my family.

I was skeptical about this one but my family enjoyed it. I don't like swiss chard or pinto beans so I used about one bag of kale and one can of canellini beans instead. I also didn't put it in the oven at the end. I just left it on the heat a little longer to melt the goat cheese. Overall, great dish.

I loved this side dish, it had a great balance of flavors and was a nice way to use up some rainbow chard from my garden.  I used more tomato than called for (about 1 1/2 large roma tomatoes), and probably had a little more chard as well.  The only thing I would do differently is squeeze out the juice from my tomatoes before using them because there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of my pan after baking.

This recipe was ok.  Not fabulous, but a good way to use swiss chard.  I love, love, love goat cheese so I will most likely double it next time to make it a little more savory.

10-7-11: Made with double chard, as suggested in one of the comments, this approaches excellence.

I actually use a similar combination (minus the goat cheese and lime juice) for an amazing soup. Basically you add a lot more tomatoes and juice as well as 2 more bunches of chard. The trick is to boil the chard and add to this mixture of beans (use cannelloni) and tomatoes. For a little more protein, add shredded chicken. Taste as you go for salt and pepper.

Excellent recipe - my 18 year old daughter who doesn't like chard ate this and had seconds.  I made a few changes: I added the cheese at the end and left pot covered so no need to bake as recipe had suggested....I used no butter (didn't miss it), used mozzarella instead of goat cheese (still yummy), and used a 15 oz can of diced petite tomatoes instead of fresh tomato. Substantial recipe and nice textures, served it with a fish recipe and it was a good alternative to rice or potatoes with the beans.

This was really tasty. My husband had 3 helpings.  I have been purchasing new vegetables to branch out from the usual and I'm glad I found this.  I too used black beans. I did not put it in the oven.  After I cooked it on the stove, I topped it with goat cheese and covered it and the cheese melted down in less than ten minutes.  I think most any cheese would work.

I was looking for a way to use up feta cheese and found this one. Followed the recipe as written here. Fun, pretty and delicious. I would have never thought to put these ingredients together, but worked great! Used 1 roma tomato, from now on I'll use two, and experiment with different beans (although the Pinto works great). Was a nice compliment to roast pork.

I can't say enough about how incredible, how wonderful this recipe is!  I am, however, giving it 4 stars, because in order for it to be a 5 star recipe, you really have to do as many other reviewers suggest and use black beans instead of pinto beans.  This recipe has become a "regular" in my house, thanks so much for posting it!

Excellent recipe! I used a bag of mixed chard from TJ's, a can of black beans, and a can of diced Italian tomatoes.  I forgot to add lime juice, but it wasn't missed.  I liked the goat cheese, but I don't think I really need it in this recipe.  Also, I think next time I'll cut down on the oil/butter mixture, to lower the fat content.  I served it as a side to bbq ribs and it was a perfect combo.

This was very good.  Used black beans and sauteed some onions with the garlic and red pepper.  Used Feta Cheese.  This recipe is a great vegetarian mail course or can be served as a hearty side dish.  n

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  One of my new favorites!

I used black beans instead of pinto and did up the Red Pepper flakes to make it a little more zippy.

Served over whole wheat pasta. Yum!

Excellent! I ad-libbed a bit b/c of hazards of frying: I steamed the red chard/stems and separately cooked the garlic with a can of Great Northern beans over medium heat; then I mixed the greens & beans, added some butter, olive oil, freshly squeezed lime juice. Topped it with parmesan - definitely an ad-lib job, but tasted amazing!!  And took no time at all to prepare.

This was super good.  Served with rotini pasta dressed with a little bit of olive oil and red wine vinegar.  Didn't have a tomato while making it so I used about 2 1/2 tbs tomato sauce and it all turned out delicious.  Will definitely make this again.
