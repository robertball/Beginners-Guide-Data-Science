We really liked this soup! It tasted exactly like my cabbage roll recipe. I adjusted the seasoning a bit as I was concerned about the amounts. 
I used 2 tbsps brown sugar, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp vinegar, 1 tsp white sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp salt free Cajun seasoning mix. I had a can of tomato sauce that was 680 ml and I used that for the water amount as well. I was able to omit the oil as I used a non stick sauce pan. I was able to make it in a hour exactly as the shredded cabbage in the bag is fine and cooks fast. I served over rice as I make my cabbage rolls with rice and meat. 
Next time I would definitely double the recipe as we ate it in one sitting, I am feeding two growing boys! Thanks for a great new recipe :)

Everyone loved it.  Only changes I made was the addition of white rice which then needed more water.  I added a beef bullion cube so it didn't get too watered down.  Don't over do the sugar since it is on the sweet side.

I made this exactly the way recipe said to and it was so good! My husband and daughter thought it was a little too sweet, but they still liked it. Next time I will cut out the brown sugar and only add the white sugar. Personally, I thought it was perfectly sweet. It tasted just like a cabbage roll! This soup is going into our rotation for sure.

Wonderful soup.  Family loved it.  I used the chicken broth instead of water, and added about two cups of cooked rice, but besides that I made it as the recipe called for and it turned out great.

I think it best to add most of the sugars and vinegars to start, let it simmer for an hour, and add more if you want. This is fairly sweet.   And, I used beef broth, since I happened to have it on hand.  My family loved it, and I like the fact it doesn't have rice, like some other recipes. I didn't give it the full two hours to cook, being in a hurry. It was fine.

Good but next time I will reduce the amount of vingar and the amount of pepper. To overcome the strong flavor this time, I added a half cup of tomato sauce and a half cup of water.

I didn't  like the sugar in it. It was too sweet for me anyway. I'll  make this again without sugar...then I'll  update.
