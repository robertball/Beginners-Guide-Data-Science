Don't be afraid of this recipe.  I've been intrigued by it for awhile but was concerned about some of the negative reviews. It turned out excellent for me. Some tips that I think will solve other's problems: 1. You don't need water, the yogurt produces a nice creamy sauce without it. 2. If you think it's bland, add more garlic and hot sauce/cayanne. 3. To avoid the curdle problem altogether, wisk the sauce ingredients together and add to the completed dish w/out heating.  The heat of the noodles and veggies will warm the sauce plenty. Enjoy!

I think that this is a great recipe, just poorly constructed. Instead of taking the time to strain the healthy whey out of the yogurt, just decrease the water according to how thin your yogurt is. Also it is too runny to begin with, so either way you should decrease the amount of water. Also, there are tons of other options for the veggies. I also used cayenne instead of hot sauce, and added cumin. I also used an extra tablespoon of tahini. Do be extra careful to not overheat it though because it will curdle and there is no going back after that. I love it!

The beauty of this recipe is that it can include any vegetables that you like. In fact, I think there are far better choices than those suggested (and a lot more of them), including peppers of all colours, carrots, red onion, asparagus... Definitely too much water in the recipe; I use half of what's recommended. Parmesan cheese or feta cheese are both good toppings. I have also substituted 1/2 lime for the lemon and it's good. Good recipe, great taste. Leftovers also very good.

I made this after a really long, tiring day. My hunger had escalated to lightheadedness as I sat down to eat at 9:30 p.m. One bite - bleagh! I tried two bites to justify the time spent cooking it while my husband mustered down a few more so I wouldn't feel so sad about cooking a horrible meal. I ended up throwing all of it straight into the trash. No flavor. And the sauce has a strange texture to it. Like curdled milk spiked with too much lemon.

I tried this recipe because I had so much tahini in my pantry, and thought the sauce had a really great flavor (I used cayenne peppar instead of tabasco and also added a bit of cumin). It was extremely thin and runny, however. I'll probably use about half the amount of water next time. Otherwise, this was really tasty!

Great!  I did tinker the recipe (actually used the recipe as a guide and did my own thing.)  This is a keeper and it seems like one can go in many directions in terms of veggies and added spices herbs.  I used mostly the same ingredients (but for eg. used low fat yogurt instead and diff veggies) and eyeballed quantity bc I planned to use 1/2 box of ziti. I used a full bag frozen veggies. I sauteed chicken cut up with chopped onion. Threw in some chopped fresh parsley. I added cumin and paprika and ground cayenne to the sauce. Also I did not added the recommended water to the sauce I ended up saving pasta water to thin down if needed after all was mixed. The sauce I added after everything was mixed to avoid curdling as per one of the other users suggestions (avoiding heating over a flame.) It worked.  I am curious to try this with kalamata olives and sauteed red peppers or another time with mushrooms. BTW, the sauce has a tang to it.

Not a fan...thought it was very bland.  I did use less water as other's instructed, but it was still a little watery.  I will not make this again.

Very good! I mixed up the sauce without water and let it stand in a bowl, then sauteed some onions, garlic, cayenne, and smoked paprika in olive oil. Added some roasted red peppers and the cooked pasta and tossed with the sauce. Drizzled a little extra olive oil on top- delicious!

Rave reviews!
I cut the water, added cumin, chili pepper, red onion, and celery.  Fabulous, tangy, and I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.

Yummy. Based on other reviews, I don't think I used any water to avoid a runny sauce. If I added any liquid, it might have been vegetable broth. Can't remember!

Pretty good, nice change of pace from the usual pasta sauces. I didn't have pepper sauce so I left it out but will make sure to add it if I make this again in future, could have used the kick. Also, based on other reviews, I eliminated the water from the sauce completely and used a bit of water to keep the veggies moist during sauteeing. The sauce had a great consistency without water.

I was really curious about this recipe, and a little nervous about trying it, but I was pleasantly surprised by the result. I had no idea what to expect, but I ended up really enjoying it, and plan to make it again.  I did leave out the extra water, but prepared the recipe exactly as stated other wise. I had no issues with the sauce separating.  It did have a little kick to it tho, to much for my kids, so next time I will not use as much pepper sauce, and I think I will try adding onion.

I wish I would have read the comments before I tried this.  I knew it was a tough audience, my dad.  Way too much water in the recipe.  Otherwise it was good

Yeah, definitely needs some tinkering, and the it's really good.  I  also put a handful of feta cheese on top, and a handful of kalamata olives.  Hunk of italian bread, glass of wine, gotta love it.      Definitely take the advice of the other comments.  Maybe it's a bit of an acquired taste, but I think it's good...

It needs more garlic and less liquid, but then it'll taste great!  I used a lot more veggies than called for, and threw in some leftover grilled chicken to simmer.  This is a fun and different sauce I look forward to tinkering with.

My oldest daughter is always willing to try anything and I was intrigued by this recipe. I'm always looking for something different for her. I added mushrooms to the vegetables but that was my only change. Whilst my daughter liked this she said it was a little bit sweet for her tastes, although I used unsweetened plain yogurt. I'm not sure this will be on the menu again. Thanks for giving me the chance to try something different.

Tasty! I'm happy to have another use for tahini besides hummus. Per reviewer comments, I reduced the water by half and also added cumin and chili powder. Other alterations: penne instead of egg noodles and onion in place of zucchini. Adjusting the salt and pepper really enhanced the tahini/yogurt flavor. Will make again... sauce would be great with brown rice & veggies!

Used equal amounts of Tahini and Yogurt. Added water slowly until desired thickness was achieved. Cut one Portobella mushroom and added to veggies. Hubby and I both really enjoyed it.

I never had anything quite like this before, I expected it to taste sort of like hummus but it didn't.

Per other reviewers, I didn't add any water to the sauce and used the vegetables I had on hand: onion, green pepper, mushroom, carrot, and brussel sprouts (sliced).  I added grated parmesan cheese to the top and that really gave this dish the kick it needed.  The sauce was very light and a little soury, almost like a hot pasta salad?    

My vegetarian boyfriend did not like this one at all, but I'm the one reviewing so it gets four stars.

This recipe has become one of our weekly standards. Very quick, and quite tasty. The sauce is thin,(it just coats the noodles and veggies),  but has not in my experience ever curdled. I have never cooked it though, just heated it until warm - this takes less than a minute.

This was very fresh-tasting, but I agree, the sauce was too soupy.  I had to use a lot of corn starch before I could serve the sauce.  I'll make this again, but use a smaller lemon and no added water.

I thought the sauce was a bit runny and next time would add less water.  I felt it was missing something, but couldn't figure out what spice it needed.  I also added more veggies.

Delicious! I used 3/4 cup water instead, the sauce was thin but not overly so. I also had no veggies, but it was still very good. The flavours complemented eachother so well. Over spaghetti, this made for a perfect light lunch. Can't wait to make it again.

I mostly followed the recipe cutting back a little on water and not straining the yogurt.  This is a good base for lots of options.  Next time I will add mushrooms and maybe top with a little parmesan.

Great base sauce. After cooking vegetables, turned off the burner, stirred in the sauce and the al dente noodles and let sit for 5 minuets. Since there is only 2 of us, reduced the noodles to 6 oz, water to 1 cup, and used 6 oz container of greek yogurt. I will make again with more vegetables.

This is not a keeper for me.  First, it's way too much pasta.  I only used 8 oz and it was still too much.  Second, I think it needs more veggies. Easy enough to fix.  I suggest adding broccoli and onions.  Like others, I reduced the amount of water in the sauce to 1/2 a cup and I just added the sauce to the warm pasta and veggies to prevent curdling.  Both are great suggestions that work well.  It just didn't taste good and was pretty bland.  Needs more...something.

This is really good, just be sure to leave the water out ; I didn't find that it was needed but if you do you can just add some of the pasta water until its at the consistency you like. Once I mixed the tahini and yogurt, I felt it needed more tahini & garlic, so I'd recommend adjusting to your personal taste. Overall it is a very tasty and filling dish....it just needs some adjustments in the preparation. I will be making it again, thanks for sharing!
