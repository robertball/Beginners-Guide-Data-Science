This is an awesome pasta salad. Great combination of flavors and textures. Made it as written, with the exception of not peeling my cucumber, and we were very pleased. This was a perfect side to Marinated Greek Chicken Kabobs from this site. Thank you, ADZELL!

OK, I have been dying to make this and when I finally found the greek dressing (Ken's Creamy Greek) I was so excited. Today I got up and decided this was the day! However, I had to improvise a little b/c I didn't have some of the ingredients and am without a car today, so here's what I did: First, I didn't have any farfalle pasta, but I did have this really cool giant elbow shape, so I went with that. We love, love, love radishes and feta cheese, but I didn't have either so I used sliced black olives and a sharp provolone instead. OMG!!!! This salad is DELICIOUS! My 2 year old tore up a bowl of it at lunch time before it was even chilled...he loved it! It is such a wonderfully different take on traditional pasta salad and I can't wait to get some radishes and feta to make it again, b/c I know it will be even better! Thanks, ADZELL for another winning recipe! :)

I thought this was so yummy!!  I doubled everything except radishes, and chick peas. I used a whole 16oz bottle of kraft Greek vinaigrette, 5T mayo, 6 radishes (chopped super fine with food chopper), 1 whole cucumber, 1 can chick peas, and 1 can olives (which I think adds alot to the salad in my opinion), I only had 1 cup of feta so thats all I used and  thought it still tasted great.  This recipe doesnt make a lot so I probably should have quadrupled it because everyone licked the bowl clean.  Thank you for sharing.  I will be making this again very soon!

The perfect mix of everything.  I added one roma tomato but kept the rest the same and it tasted yummy!  Easy and simply, would make again for sure.

Love, love, love this salad!! I thought there was going to be too much dressing, but by the time I served it(about 6 hrs after making it), it was perfect!! This was also my first taste of feta cheese & I loved it!!

I liked this a lot.  This was a last minute dinner attempt and I didn't have radishes and cucumber on hand, so I substituted peas and chick peas. My son (who is a good eater) liked this as well. My daughters who are both horrible eaters didn't care much for it - but I wasn't surprised by that. I made a homemade Greek/House dressing (Absolutely Fabulous Greek House Dressing) also on this site. I just reduced the serving size to 5 and it was perfect for us. Thanks!

This was just okay for me.  I made exactly as is except I added olives. This had so many great reviews they all cant be wrong, so I am sure it is just my taste preference as to why I didn't go crazy over this dish.  It is worth a try but I probably wont make again.  Thank you for sharing though.

Yummy! I loved the flavors in this salad. It was a wonderful side dish on a hot summer day. I made no changes to the recipe. My family loved this as well. I'll be making this often. Thanks Adzell!

This was WONDERFUL and so easy!  I think I've found my new addiction!  Oh, one change:  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used white wine vinegar.  I did try them before making & decided they did taste similar enough that it should be fine.  This one's a keeper, thanks for posting!

Nice salad. I used rotini pasta instead of bowties and used a creamy Greek dressing. I also added red onion, black olives and grape tomatoes. I would definatley make this again.

Very good.  I made with "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" from this site, and declined to add mayonnaise because it was good enough without the extra calories.  Also added olives and fresh basil.

This was just ok.  I didn't feel that all the ingredients went well together but I might make it again sometime.  Fairly easy and healthy.

Very good! I used a homemade Greek dressing, omitted the radishes and added grape tomatoes.  I also used a basil-garlic flavored pasta for this (just because I had it on hand).  Very nice salad!

Yum!  Like others, I made the "Absolutely Fabulous Greek House Dressing" from scratch to use with this.  I added bell peppers and tomatoes, b/c I'm always looking for ways to get more vegetables and nutrients.

Wow, this is such a simple recipe, yet it tastes so wonderful! I love the combination of flavors; the Greek dressing really ties everything together. The only change I made was that I skipped the feta cheese, because I don't care for it. Thanks for such an amazing recipe, Adzell! I will be making it again!

Really great flavor! Simple to make, also. I used Great Northern beans, because I did not have garbanzos, and it turned out just fine. Thinking any white beans would work and adding additional olives may be nice.

I thought it was a 4 but hubs said 10 so 5 stars it is. With the exception of not peeling the cucumber I made this as written. I used bottled dressing that our local Greek place sells.  I was tempted to throw in some sweet onion and frozen peas and I will next time.  Great recipe that can be easily changed to suit your families tastes. Thanks for sharing.

This is really good. My only suggestion would be to use a homemade greek dressing. I use the greek house dressing from this site. Also mixed with greek yogurt instead of mayp and used whole grain rotini. I used all the suggested ingredients as well as some finely diced red onion, shredded cheddar cheese and some finely diced celery. I love the chickpeas in here! I made this for My 10year old daughter to take for lunches this week. With some fruit its a complete meal. Ill use variations of this for sunmer bbqs and potlucks. Thanks!

Best pasta salad I have made!  Substituted pitted kalamata olives for the radishes, added grape tomatoes, and used Annie's Goddess dressing.  Yummy!

Great recipe! I didn't have Bow Tie pasta so I used what I already had, which turned out to be Mezze Penne. I had just finished off my favorite Farmer Boy's Greek Dressing so I used Kraft's Viva Italian Dressing. I didn't have radishes so I substituted finely diced red bell pepper for color and crunch.  Absolutely delicious!  I can't wait to taste it again after it's been in the fridge for a couple hours.  One reviewer mentioned using peas so I sprinkled a handful of frozen peas in for fun and it made a great addition! Will make again with radishes.  Thank you for sharing your recipe! :)

This is a great pasta salad! I used black olives instead of radishes and I recommend Ken's Greek Salad Dressing after trying a couple of different ones. Ken's has a finer, more feta less oil taste.

If I made this again, I would not use bowtie pasta. It has a weird texture that I'm not crazy about. My husband complained that the dressing made the pasta salad kind of slimy. Unfortunately, no one wanted the leftovers and a bunch of it went into the trash. Probably won't make this one again.

This was great! I didn't have any chickpeas, and I love onion so I added a little bit all finely chopped, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Hopefully next time I have some chickpeas. YUM. Thanks!
