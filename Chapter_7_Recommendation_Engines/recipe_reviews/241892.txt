I made these muffins up today...I got 18 out of the recipe.  At the last second I realized I had no almond extract but by then it was too late, so I added in 1/4 c. poppy seeds and doubled the almonds, which I ground up very fine.  The muffins didn't rise very well but, as another reviewer said, it has nice crumb, the texture is very nice.  It does need more flavour so as soon as I get some almond extract, I'll make them up again to give the recipe a fair chance.  The other reviewer said the almond taste is too strong but given they are called Almond Poppy Seed Muffins, one should expect a definite almond flavour.  I will update after using the almond extract and adding at least 2 tsp baking powder.  They also took double the time to bake.

Made these at the request of my son. Followed the recipe exactly as written and they were a hit with everyone. Yield was 14 muffins filling the cups to the top with batter so they all had a nice crispy crown. A really tender and moist muffin. Didn't get very dark on top, so be sure to not overbake. Check at minimum time, but mine went 27 minutes. Included the optional added nuts and the full amount of almond extract and did not find the almond flavor overpowering at all.

The crumb in these muffins is so moist and soft--easily the best part of this recipe. My kids really liked these muffins, but the almond extract flavour was too strong for me; I'd prefer a more natural, subtle aroma/flavour from the nuts themselves. I used twice the amount of poppyseeds and almond pieces instead of slivers to make it more pleasantly crunchy. Mainly for appearance, I sprinkled a bit of ground almonds on top of each muffin before baking. Also, not sure what size muffin tin was used for this recipe but I had to use a larger size (about 2.75" at the base) to make the servings work. Thanks for this recipe.

These turned out great, though I'm not sure why it calls for so much butter/oil.  Seems like you could reduce the oil to 1/4 cup and still be delicious.
