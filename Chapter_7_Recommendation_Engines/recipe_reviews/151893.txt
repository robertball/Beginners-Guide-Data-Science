Excellent!  However I needed to extend the time in the broiler from 5 min to 10 minutes each side.  Then after cooking on crock pot I put back in broiler for 5-10 min each size and made the outside crispy...very good!

Cannot believe how great these are considering how easy they are to make.  Have made these twice now following the recipe exactly.  Maybe will try with a dry rub instead of salt and pepper.  Also, may try a drop or two of liquid smoke.

Tastes great, super easy! The only thing was that it only took about 4.5 hours, and they were a little over done! But it was a great recipe!

I'm more of a beginner cook and decided to make this for a dinner with my father-in-law.  He thinks I can cook now, so I give it 5 stars!  Seriously, it was very yummy.  I did follow the tip from another reviewer and decided to broil the ribs a second time right before serving them to give it that extra little crunch.  My husband just added a little extra bbq sauce and popped them under the broiler.  I cooked them the entire 8 hours on low (no medium setting on my pot) and did not have mushy ribs at the end.  I will be using this recipe again when other in-laws come to dinner.

I cooked the country style ribs for 4 hours on LOW setting, then added the BBQ sauce and could have served them at that point.  I kept them warm and then threw them on our grill, on foil, long enough to "grill mark" them and get them really hot. Minutes later, they were served, and loved!  If I'd cooked them longer in the crock, they'd have turned into pulled pork, which I was trying to avoid, didn't want MUSHY!  THanks for a wonderful recipe.

SO EASY! Definitely had to change a few things, but this was my first time using my slow cooker and I will be using this as a base recipe again. I broiled the ribs for 5 minutes on each side, and since my slow cooker didn't have a medium setting, I did 2 hours on high and 3 hours on low. I didn't add the water because the ribs gave so much natural juice. I also used 3/4 of a 40oz bottle of Jack Daniel's Original BBQ sauce. It had all the smokey flavor I wanted. I ended up making pulled pork with this recipe, but if I wanted to keep them as ribs, I would have just basted them with extra bbq sauce and broiled them again for a little crisp, since I don't have a grill. Definitely worth a try! Great with corn bread :)

WOW:D I love to cook, but not a big fan of Ribs.  My husband usually cooks Ribs in the smoker or the Grill. Was not an option on this day, so I looked up a crockpot recipes and found this one. All I can say is that I will be making these again.  Better than any I have add. I did a dry rub on them prior to broiling in the oven, and placed them in the crockpot.  Set the timer for 4 hours.  Removed ribs and placed on cookie sheet, basted them with Sweet Baby Rays, and broiled them till they got a good crisp.  I think my husband was little jeoulous, all we would say is "I think I'll let you cook these again" haha.  I agree with the reviews, 8 hours would of been way to much time.

good idea! this is what i did: cut up rib, serving size pieces. then salt and pepper and little garlic. boiled in a big pot of water for 30 minutes. then drained off all that foam and greased and rinsed pan. then to pan i put a 24 oz. can of beer and one bottle of kraft barbeque sauce 1 bay leaf and brought to a boil and add ribs back in and put a lid on and simmered for 1hour. removed ribs again to pot a added 1 clove minced garlic,  1/4 cup brown sugar (more for tastebuds), 1/2 cup more barbeque sauce, and 1 T of cornstarch and brought to a boil until thicken. i perpare a baking sheet with tin foil and cooking spray. basted ribs and put under broiler to camelize both sides  while basting.  perfect ribs. can't wait to put them on the grill when camping! thanks.

Never would of thought of putting ribs in a crockpot but they were excellent . I did mine bcakwards to this recipe. I cut the ribs into two rib portions and added stright to the crockpot. I added two hearty beers, 1 quartered onion, two garliic cloves,1 bay leaf, and the ribs. Left them cooking for six hours (my dog was going crazy with. The wonderful aroma). Took them out gently because they were very fragile placed them on a disposable aluminum pan and smothered with barbecue sauce. Placed them in the oven for 25 minutes to brown and help the sauce thicken. Finger licking good.

Really, really good.  I was going to finish them off on the grill, but it rained.  So even right out of the crockpot they were delicious.  And truly, you couldn't get any easier.

Very tasty! But I think 8 hours was a little bit long. By the time I got home from work they were a little dry. Next time I am going to put them on during my lunch break and eat dinner a little late. But will be making them again!!

Very good slow cooker recipe for BBQ Ribs.  Watch it after a couple hours of cooking or it will end up pulled pork.  Also don't skip the broiling step as it does make a difference.

THESE WILL NOT MELT IF YOU COOK THEM FOR THE RECOMMENDED TIME!!!    I cooked them for approximately 10.5 hours total and they were absolutely fantastic.  Came off the bone beautifully but still stayed on the bone to serve.  I used a little over a bottle of sauce and a lot more water than the recipe calls for.  I put enough water in so that it JUST covered the ribs.  I did not stir because I poured the bbq sauce over the ribs and gently added the water so the bbq sauce stayed on the ribs.  By the end of it when I got home, about 2 inches of water had evaporated and some of the ribs already had a crystallized sugar outside.  They were absolutely fantastic.  I served it with warm cornbread and corn on the cob.  Definitely thumbs up.  I'd never made baby back ribs before and it was super easy.  (I also cut the ribs into portion sizes - 3 ribs each)  Raving reviews from the hubby.  He loved it.

IMPROVEMENT THAT WORKED FOR ME  Eight hours is too long!  (I also don't have a "Medium" setting on my crock pot.)  I had these under the broiler until just starting to show some char (turning once).  I put them in the crock pot on low for four hours.  I removed them, let them cool and put them in the fridge until cold - this "sets" the meat.  From there I can EITHER grill them to get some nice char, slather with BBQ sauce when they hit 140°F, remove from hear and serve, OR return them to the crock pot with the BBQ sauce and serve when they hit 140°F.

Tasty! Have made several times, best results this past time using 5 pounds BONELESS country ribs in large, oval slow cooker. Applied Hubscrap's rub to ribs (about 1 1/2 recipe, maybe a bit less that that, subbed spicy smoked paprika for the cayenne) the evening before, refrigerated overnight. Heated large saute pan over high heat, then browned ribs on the stove top quickly over high heat (2 sides only, top and bottom). Transferred ribs to slow cooker and then de-glazed the pan with about 1/4 cup of OJ and added drippings to the slow cooker.  First 1/2 hour on high, then 2 hours on low.  Then added the sauce but NO water needed. Replaced cover and cooked 3 more hours on low. Ribs were tender enough to shred so the kids could eat on buns, but not so tender as to be falling apart, so worked well as a meat entree for my husband and I as well. Resulting sauce is tasty but full of fat so take the time to spoon off as much fat as possible before serving if time allows. The first few times I made this I also used boneless ribs, and I also used a rub, but didn't let it sit overnight.  I was surprised how much tastier the ribs were with the rub applied and left to rest; however, they were yummy even with the rub applied and immediately browned, so don't hesitate to try this recipe even if you don't have time to let the ribs marinate.

What a great new way to make ribs!  In the past, I had boiled mine for 1 hour with seasonings and then baked in the oven.  I MUCH prefer this method!  I had mine in the crock-pot for a total of 9 hours on low, and they were not mushy at all. Here is what I did, maybe it helped: after the initial 4 hours, I took my turkey baster and sucked off all of the liquid from the crock (fat and water from the meat). It was a pretty good amount-probably an inch or two that the ribs were sitting in. Then I put on the bottle of BBQ sauce.  At the end of the 8 hours, per another's suggestion, I did add a little more BBQ sauce on top and broiled them again for 5 minutes.  This added a nice stickiness and crispiness to the ribs.  They fell off the bone and were very tasty--reminded me of restaurant ribs.  Great submission GrannyLin!

Delicious..didn't take as long to cook but were falling off the bones at 6 hours.  This recipe is a keeper, the smells as they cook make everyone hungry.

I am a newlywed who is trying her luck in the kitchen. I had never made ribs before so I was nervous.  I needed a recipe that only required a few ingredients, so this was perfect.  Don't be scared by the broiling thing before sticking them into the slow cooker - this almost made me look for a different recipe, as I had never broiled anything before either and thought it might be too many "firsts".  You don't need them to "brown" as the instructions say - this confused me - just leave them for about 5 minutes each side. Easy.

After broiling, I put 3 pounds of baby back ribs in the slow cooker with onions on low heat for 3 hours, then added the barbecue sauce.  You don't need 18 ounces, seemed like way too much.  I also didn't use the water. I kept cooking on low another 2 hours.  The hubs called to say he would be home early, so even though the recipe called for 8 hours on low, I just decided to cook it on high for another hour and a half.  It worked great, and before serving them I took the advice of other reviewers and broiled each side again for 5 minutes each, generously applying bbq sauce.

I must say they turned out great, so much better than I expected, especially for my first try!!  And I didn't even follow the recipe exactly, ahhh the magic of slow cookers.  Will definitely make these again.

This was SO easy, and my family loved it!   I made it exactly as the recipe said, though my crockpot cooks fast so I left the last two hours on warm. I used honey barbeque sauce I had on hand. Seemed strange to put the onions in with no liquid for the first four hours, but it worked!  My husband usually does our ribs on the grill with a much more complicated process, but he was awed by these!  Definitely a keeper.

I just made some country style ribs in the crockpot today and wondered if there was a recipe out there for it. I found this one and decided to give my version. I sprinkled the ribs with a little liquid smoke and then grilled them on a hot grill for the grill marks. I then added them to the crock pot with a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and they cooked on low for 6-7 hrs. I didn't add anything else, but onion would have probably been good. You don't need to add water, because it makes more liquid as it cooks. The ribs I bought had the bone in them. They were falling apart and the sauce was very nice and tasty. Really easy way to make ribs.

This recipe is super easy but found that it cooks in less than 4 hours on low with my slow cooker. it is a big hit with my huge family (8) and I usually serve it with homemade cornbread muffins, corn and either mini potatoes or rice

These are the perfect ribs.  Who knew from a crock pot.  The sauce stuck to the ribs and they were not soggy.  Just wonderful.  I will not cook ribs any other way, most likely.

Since my baby back ribs were alread cut and frozen (by me ) I couldn't broil them first.  I just put them frozen on top of the onion, added salt and pepper and bbq sauce (chipotle)  and cooked them in the slow cookeron high for 6 hours. AMAZING!!!!!!

My husband LOVES ribs but is somewhat of a rib snob, and he loved these! He said they were better than any restaurant around here! I love them, too! I did do things just a liitle different though..

- Use pork rub on the ribs first.
- Sprinkle a couple onion flakes in crock pot with 1T water.
- Broil about 5 min then add to crock pot.
- Cook about 3 hrs on high, add bbq sauce, 2 hrs low.
- Remove, smother in bbq sauce, broil another 5ish minutes.

Delicious!

These were delicious. A few minor changes: I was too nervous to use the slow cooker without liquid, so I added a cup of water at the beginning. Then I placed them under the broiler for about 5 minutes at the end just to crisp the outside a bit.

Made these tonight and cooked them for 4 hours on high in my slow cooker. They turned out perfect...fork tender but not mushy at all! I served with mac and cheese and baked beans, and it was the perfect meal. Thanks!

Simple and delicious.  I seasoned with garlic, salt and pepper before broiling, then added a mix of tomato soup and BBQ sauce right away because I didn't have enough sauce and I didn't have the time to add the sauce later.  While these were good and melt in the mouth done, I think next time I will do a second broil as others suggested to add the extra crisp at the end.

This was ok and very easy.  Because it was a hot day and I didn’t want to start up the oven, I started them off on the grill instead of the broiler and then transferred them to the crock pot.  I was disappointed that the sauce didn’t permeate the meat as I had hoped.

I made this last night, it was so good and a big hit with my family. I just used regular pork ribs and I put the BBQ sauce in at the same time with the ribs. My slow cooker only has low, high and warm, so I put it on high and it didn't take as long.

Just okay. The sauce didn't stick to the ribs at all and it was really juicy instead of thick and saucy.

Made these last night. Cooked for about 5 hours and the meat was falling off the bone. (Cooked first 2 hours on high, last 3 on low). Delicious and simple!

These were good but could have been great.  I used a Kraft Original BBQ Sauce and it was a little boring.  We added Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce at the table and it made the sauce much better.  I will just use that brand next time...a good BBQ sauce is a must for this recipe.  The sauce was also a little watered down so next time I will just skip the added water as I think it is un-nessesary.  I will also just brown my ribs on the stove because in only about 2-3 minutes the ribs were almost cooked through and it would be easier to control regulate on the stove top.  I read other reviews about the time being too long but at the end of 8 hours mine were not as tender as I'd like, probably because they cooked too much under the broiler.  All in all we liked them but with some tweeks these will become a staple in our house.

I really liked the browning of the ribs in the broiler part of this recipe. I forgot to do the salt and pepper- no biggie since the bbq sauce I used is the bomb! I put the bbq sauce in at the beginning and cooked the meat in it on high for a little more than 2 hours. The meat was falling off the bone in that short of time. And it was delicious!

These turned out great!
I didn't have an onion, so I used some minced garlic in place of that.
My slow cooker didn't have medium either, so I did 4 hours on low, added the bbq sauce, then 2 hours on high.
The only other thing I did different was brush a little more sauce on them, and stick them back under the broiler for a few minutes.
They were fantastic :)

Yummmm! Made these Saturday for dinner at a friend's. Then my son called to BBQ on Sunday and I made them again! A little extra under the broiler and only 4-5 hours on low as suggested and this is my rib recipe forever! Thank you!

Good base recipe for bbq ribs if you tweek a few things.  I can not imagine cooking these for 8 hours. After 4 they were super done and anything over that and it would of been bbq mush.  If you cook for 4 hours and add more spices to your liking you should be ok.

My first time making ribs EVER and These turned out wonderful and tender. My boyfriend and I ate them with Mashed potatoes and gobbled them up!  I would use a tad less water next time around. The BBQ taste was a little watered down for my taste, but that's just preference.  I will probably add some garlic as well as I'm a garlic nut :)  I cooked them for 5 hours! Thanks Granny Lynn!

Very good, my husband and sons liked these a lot!  I agree with some of the other posts that 8 hours, even on low, is too much time.  I cooked mine on low and checked them at 7 hours and they were extremely tender.  The next time I make them I will probably only cook them for 6-6 1/2 hours on low.   I also only used about 1/2 a bottle of water; I didn't want to water down the sauce and flavor too much.

These were very tender and tasty.  I cut the boneless ribs in half, so that they would fit in the slow cooker better. Like others, I cooked these on low for 4 hours, then just another hour after adding the barbecue sauce. Served them with Healthier Chuck's Favorite Mac and Cheese and green salad. Our grandson AND his wife went back for seconds, which is the badge of success for me. 
Oh, I also used a slow cooker liner bag, which made cleanup a breeze.

I'm in my RV and made this. You know those tiny lil' ovens that come in these things...This is the second time that I've made this. The first time, I did put it in the oven, however this time, I've placed it directly into the crockpot (atop the onions) and we'll see how it comes out in 8-hours!

My family loved this. We used bbq spice in place of salt and pepper and cooked it for 1/2 hour in the pressure cooker as opposed to a slow cooker. It came out extremely moist, tender and delicious. Great for picnics or weekend fare

My family loved this dish.  I followed the recommendations of reviewers- drained liquid before adding BBQ sauce and broiling when done.  My slow cooker also must cook high, because these were done earlier than anticipated (about 5 hours).  I removed the bones at this point and changed heat to "warm".  It worked great.  I used country ribs and the meat stayed intact even after bones removed.  I will definitely make again.

Excellent! Changed it a little.  Put salt pepper and garlic powder, no onion then I put them in the oven at 400 degrees for 15 each side then drained before I placed them in the crockpot so it doesn't become soupy.  I also cut the time of cooking by two hours.
 I would definitely make this recipe again.

This is terrific! I too thought the ribs were done after 4 hours on high.  I set  the slow cooker on warm for about a half hour then placed the meat on a foil covered baking sheet.   I then put it under the broiler on high for about 4 minutes.

The first thing I would say when making this recipe is cut the ribs in half , and I think I would have added less pepper and I think the most important thing that  needs to be done, after cooking in the slow cooker is place in oven with extra barbecue sauce  I think I would cook less time in slow cooker too mine was a little dry.  Those are my suggestions

Made ribs tonight.  Put St. Louis style ribs in crock pot, added one onion (all I had), added nearly the entire bottle of barbecue sauce (Pit Happens), cooked on high for four hours.  Meat was falling off the bones, and it was fantastic.  Did not need to broil.  Super recipe, and super easy!  You can add more steps, but if you need quick, this is the one.

Hubs wanted to try boneless country pork ribs, so I thought I’d do something similar to this recipe.  I seasoned some ribs with garlic salt and pepper and instead of broiling them, I had Hubs sear them on the grill.  I then threw some sliced onion in the bottom of my slow cooker and topped with the ribs.  I cooked them on low and after 4 hours one of the ribs was fork tender, so I removed it.   The others must have been a bit tougher and I needed to continue to cook them for two more hours.  I refrigerated all the ribs until it was time for dinner.  We finished the ribs on the grill, heating them through and basting with bbq sauce.  We were both really pleased how these turned out, very tender, but still moist.  We’ll be doing these again!

It was a great recipe, so easy to do. I used Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce NUM! However, like everyone else, I did this on LOW for 4hrs and it was perfect and I really didn't need the water. I also thought it could use a little more cooking after to crisp it up and so I put on more BBQ sauce and broiled it some more.. perfect! I invited someone waiting in the hallway for my neighbor for 2hrs for dinner and she loved it too!

This worked great but I didn't have to cook them for 8 hrs. I did about 2 hrs in High and 2 1/2-3 hrs on low (no Med on my slow cooker) and the ribs were fall off the bone tender.

This was my 1st time making ribs so I was a little worried but they turned out good & tender!  Water is not needed to cooked these because the ribs will produce enough liquid.  My slow cooker doesn't have medium so after broiling,  I cooked them on high 1 hour & low for 4 hours.  (Low on my crock-pot is more like a medium setting.)  I basted w/ some of the barbeque sauce 3 hours in & after 2 more hours I put more sauce on & broiled a 2nd time. (Make sure to use a good sauce!)  These were wonderful!

Made these twice now & the first time followed the recipe exactly. Broiled 5 minutes on each side. The second time I made them I added a little more spice...made a rub of dried ground mustard, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt & pepper, and brown sugar and rubbed onto the ribs before broiling. This is a good recipe as is, but really is a good base recipe to make your own.
