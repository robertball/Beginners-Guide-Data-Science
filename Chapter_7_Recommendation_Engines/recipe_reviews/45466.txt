We didn't care for this recipe much.  Cooking the rice that long turns it to mush.  You have to add a lot of extra water during the cooking time too.  I probably won't make again but would definitely recommend adding the rice during the last half hour of cook time.

I chose this for my New Year's black-eyed pea recipe! It's pretty good- it's not spicy & is more of a mush than a soup. You really have to watch it & keep adding water- it makes a lot- use a big pot.(4-5 qt.) Good luck to all in 2005! Happy New Year!

Liked this recipe because it had all the elements that New Year's Black-eyed Peas should have; spicy and smoky. When I made this right out of the gate I added basmati rice which has a longer cook time (no mush), cumin and about 4 1/2 cups of extra water. Next time I may try to make a vegetarian version, so I can serve small bowls of it before the Pork & Sauerkraut bonzana.

I substituted some organic french onion soup for the dry onion soup and beef broth.  Also, used some sliced kielbasa in place of the sausage.  It was excellent. Will definitely use this recipe again!

This is a great base for a recipe but is missing a few key ingredients.  Here are the changes I made:
- added LOTS of liquid - a quart of chicken stock (what I had), 3 cups of water, & a large can tomato sauce
- used brown rice; it holds up better to the soup
- also added 2 cans Rotel tomatoes and chills
- also added 1 can of spiced turnip greens.  Would have added two if I had them.
- used browned bulk sausage instead of sliced smoked sausage (just personal preference)

I doubled the recipe. I used cranberry beans instead of black eyed peas since I couldn't find peas at the store. I also added 1/4 cup hot sauce, 3 cups fresh kale, & half the rice called for. Turned out pretty good. :)

We had this on New Year's Eve, 2016. It was delicious! Even my picky 9 year old loved it, called it comfort food & asked me to make it more often. I used 2 cans of black-eyed peas, drained & rinsed, rather than the dried beans. I used ground hickory smoked sausage because of an issue with chewing & swallowing meat. I added garlic powder, when the flavor needed a little something, at the end. Next time, I'll use several cloves of minced garlic, I'll add a chopped onion & I'll use a while head of cabbage, as there wasn't enough for us. You also need to check on this every 10-15 minutes, ready to add water, or it will burn. I use a gas stove & after bringing to a boil, I reduced the heat to the lowest setting. I almost burned it & it only needed to cook for 1 hour, as the rice started to get that weird sticky, mushy, thickening thing that happens when starch breaks down too much. But we truly loved it! This is going to be added to our regular winter-time meal rotation, not just to ring in the New Year! We loved it! The neighbor's did also! I would have given it 5 stars, had it not been for the changes I made

This was really, really good.  Made it yesterday to used left over rice, which I added last - long enough to heat in the rest of soup.  Overheard husband telling someone how good it was on the phone.  Will definitely make again and may add a little more "heat" if children aren't  here.

This is a really great recipe for a soup that will last a week or so for one person... And even a lot for a family.  The recipe comes out really thick so if you do want a soup I added about two and a half cups of water or stock.  Then I added a handful of frozen spinach leaves to it as well.  I also did this in my pressure cooker which took the beans about 5 minutes to prepare for cooking, and then about 18 minutes for all the rest. It's a great solution if you don't want to wait that long for a soup for a quick lunch!
