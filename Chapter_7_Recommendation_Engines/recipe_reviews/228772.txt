I just made this tonight to go with the ham and bean soup we made and its a very good recipe....I did tweak it just a bit by adding 2 tbls of sugar and I baked it in a cast iron skillet instead of the baking dish....I also removed it from the oven after 20 minutes and let it finish baking while cooling on the counter.

Super moist and tasty.  I baked mine in a cast iron skillet and the butter made the crust brown and crispy!

Great recipe, especially for gluten-free guests.  I did add an extra 1/2 cup of cornmeal because the mixture was a little runny (maybe i added too much liquid).   Another thing I did was chop up the jalapeño and add it after I had put the mixture in the pan so that I could add it too just half.  I was not sure if my gluten-free guest liked spicy food.  The jalapeño side was eaten first.  It was perfect, thanks for a great gluten-free cornbread recipe.

I made it with Jiffy Corn Meal, used 3 boxes, and skipped the corn oil, salt, baking soda, and buttermilk,instead used a cup of regular milk.
just because I had it in hand, came out perfect, thanks!

I have been making this recipe for more than 15 years, the only difference my recipe has is to put half of the cheese in the batter and sprinkle the other half on top before putting it in the oven.  My husband and his family love this corn bread!

This was SO good! I used regular cornmeal instead of yellow cornmeal and added 2 cups of it instead of 1. Because I used the regular cornmeal i left out the baking soda and salt and it was PERFECT! I will be adding this to my recipe box!

we can't get enough of this cornbread! it was perfect the way it was, but my preference is a little firmer (mine came out a little quiche like). I also wanted to make it slightly less caloricly dense...

my tweaks: upped cornmeal to 1.5 cup, lowered corn oil to 1/3 cup, omitted cheese, used only 1tbsp butter in castiron pan. it's a hit with everyone who's tried it!

I was expecting more of a traditional cornbread recipe. It was good, but my husband is allergic to egg, so I probably should have gone with a different recipe. This seemed to have more of a quiche texture, rather than bread.

I followed this recipe pretty closely and it was a disaster. Most of the liquid sank to the bottom while baking. What did I do wrong? I found the batter to be considerably more runny than most cornbread batters. Not enough cornmeal? Also, I found it to be too salty. Maybe 1/2 the prescribed amount of salt would've been better.

This is 20 star worthy but I am a professed tweeker. I used Jiffy cornbread mix, only 1 egg,1 tsp. of sugar, sour cream in place of the buttermilk and added 1/2 cup of French Fried Onions in and on the top of the bread. WOW!!! Most excellent!  Thank you Shelia this is a keeper;)

I really (I mean REALLY) wanted to like this recipe; I love cornbread and jalapenos but I must say that I was very disappointed... It didn't taste bad but it was missing "something". I will probably won't make it again.

This was my first attempt at any type of corn bread. It was a great success. Since it was my first try, I stuck to the recipe, with just a little extra butter.

This recipe is nothing like traditional corn bread. IT DOES NOT HAVE A BREAD CONSISTENCY. It bakes up like a quiche with lots of cornmeal. It very dense and somewhat oily.

So moist with a crisp buttery edge. No spice from the jalapeños even though I left in the seeds. Will try some cayenne next time. I just loved how easy this was and everyone liked the flavor and texture.  Will save this recipe for sure.

I ALWAYS use All Recipes for my meals, but have never reviewed anything. All I can say about this corn bread recipe is WOW! I made this along with a chili recipe for a family gathering a few weeks ago. My only regret? not doubling the recipe so everyone could have seconds. I used one jalapeno for the group, as to not scare them away, but the second time for my husband and myself I used the two the recipe called for. It was amazing. Very happy I found this.

a fabulous gluten-free cornbread!  Rather than standard cornmeal, I used the coarse-ground meal and let it sit for about 1/2 an hour before baking.  Although it doesn't have the traditional corn-bread texture, I think that using the coarse corn meal probably helped avoid the "quiche" texture that some reviewers mentioned.  This will definitely be a staple recipe when I need to go gluten-free!

Was a huge hit. I thought from the texture when I took it out of the oven that maybe it was some sort of spoon bread, but it wasn't. It is very light and fluffy. Hubby liked it  better than regular corn bread.

My husband and I love this dish, I have made it many times, served it to company and they love it too. I use frozen jalapenos from my garden and they work fine. If you use gluten-free corn meal (milled in a mill separate from wheat) you can serve it to your gluten-free friends.

I made this  using skim milk with a splash of vinegar instead of buttermilk.  Used canola oil instead of corn and skipped the butter. It was fantastic! The batter is very thin but it baked in the time listed and was moist and delicious. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for dinner last night, my family did not like it. It was moist and light, but not a lot of flavor. I think we are just used to the sweet corn bread.

wow, so easy to make and I liked the melted butter idea because it gave the bread a nice golden crust. I used only two eggs and it still came out just right. When I took it out of the oven, my kitchen smelled wonderful. Perfect with Chili on a cold winter day.

It needed more jalapeños and less liquid, but beyond that it was a great base cornbread recipe.

It was more like a corn pudding, too eggy/custard-y.

Not what I was expecting so was disappointed. The flavor was okay but I agree with previous comments that it seemed to be missing something (looking at other recipes I think it is flour), and it did have more of a wet quiche consistency rather than what you traditionally expect with cornbread. If I ever tried it again I would add flour.

This was really good but I wish I would have served it warm.  I made it ahead of time and I think it would have been better straight out of the oven.
