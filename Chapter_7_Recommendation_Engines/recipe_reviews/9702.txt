AFTER READING THE OTHER REVIEWS, I DECIDED TO CHANGE THE RECIPE, BY VERY LITTLE. I CHANGED THE SERVING AMOUNT FROM 12 TO 24 . INSTEAD OF 3 CUPS OF FLOUR , I USED 2 CUPS OF FLOUR AND 1 CUP OF OATS. I PRESSED DOWN THE FIRST HALF OF THE FLOUR/OAT MIXTURE INTO THE BOTTOM OF A GREASED 9" X 9" PAN, AND USED A MIXTURE OF HALF ORANGE MARMALADE AND APRICOT PRESERVES. WITH THE REMAINING FLOUR MIXTURE, I DROPPEED TEASPOONS OF THE DOUGH ONTO THE FRUIT LAYER. THIS WAY YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ROLLING OUT THE DOUGH, IT FILLS IN AS IT BAKES. I BAKED IT FOR 30 MINUTES AND WHEN IT CAME OUT OF THE OVEN, I DID A VERY LIGHT DUSTING OF CINNAMON SUGAR. WHEN COMPLETELY COOLED, I SIFTED A FINE DUSTING OF CONFECTIONERS SUGER ON TOP. HOPEFULLY, THIS WILL HELP THOSE WHO WERE HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE TOP LAYER. I BAKE EVERYDAY AND SEND THE "GOODIES" OFF TO WORK WITH MY HUSBAND. IN THE EVENING I ALWAYS ASK HOW THEY WENT OVER AND TO THESE THE ANSWER WAS "GREAT".

I need a recipe to get rid of an excess of marmalade.  This was a very good choice.  It is very quick to assemble, has common ingredients and cooks rapidly.  I have made it twice.  I eliminated the spices for the second batch because I couldn't taste the marmalade.  Very good recipe.  It would be good with any flavor preserves.  Oh, and don't cut back on the marmalade; the moisture is needed.  Thanks Allrecipes!

Wonderful! And they ARE great with coffee. I almost polished the whole pan off myself. I tried these with orange marmalade and later with apple-cinnamon jelly. Both were great! I think it would also be good with apricot jam, raspberry, or peach--though I think the orange marmalade was my favorite. As mentioned in an earlier review, the dough is a little stiff and hard to spread. So I rolled out each layer of dough with my rolling pin a bit to make it work.

I wanted to make something with orange marmalade, and when I read that these bars "go great with coffee", I decided to give it a  go. I made minor adjustments--used 1 cup of flour and 0.5 cup of instant oats, and grated whole cloves instead of ground cloves--and the bars turned out nicely. I think I might omit the cloves next time, or just use less. The almond flavouring in the crust is very nice. Unlike some other reviewers' experiences, I did not find the dough hard to manage; I just pressed the bottom layer firmly in the bottom of the dish and crumbled the remaining mixture for the top layer to evenly cover most of the marmalade (there were some gaps). Then, I pressed down lightly on top with a spatula. In the oven, the top layer spread out and covered the marmalade completely. By the way, the bars do go very well with coffee.

Very yummy, and moist.  I didn't have enough marmalade, but I'd already pumped up my three year old about making them, so we used 1/2 marmalade and 1/2 jam, and they still turned out great!  The almond extract gives them a nice flavour.

These were really great! I had a jar of orange marmalade I needed to use, and this was perfect, even if you do not like orange marmalade. I did substitute 1/2 cup of the flour for oats. Next time I will double the recipe and cover the top, but it is fine just dobbed on the top, I pressed the bottom crust in. Oh and I cooked this 30 munutes because I used a glass baking dish..Yummy will definatly make again.

I did not enjoy these bars very much. First of all, the dough was really stiff and was difficult to manipulate. The recipe didn't make for much dough, in order to correctly fill my brownie pan, I needed to make a double batch. Then when the whole thing came out of the oven, it fell, and was pretty mushy on the bottom. Not very easy to cut and serve.
The flavor of the marmelade goes well with the cookie-style dough; I think the recipe needs to work though to make the final product easier to handle.

A complete disaster. I'm not the world's greatest baker but I know how to read, and having followed the recipe exactly, there was no way it made enough dough to form two 8 x 8 layers. I didn't have enough time to make more, so I just went with what I had. Anyway, the end result was burned, dry and dense. The flavor was ok but, other than that, this was a total waste of time.

This was a good recipe and pretty easy to prepare. I used a previous recommendation and rolled out the layer of batter that went on the top. I would love to try this with blueberry and rasperry marmalade as well!

I used my own extremely amazing (I am not kidding) homemade grapefruit marmalade. The bittersweet marmalade was terrific with the sweet crust. Also made it gluten free with a combination of 2 cups GF flour and 1 cup almond flour, and I bought the good almond extract for this. Felt that I wanted the marmalade to be the main flavor, so I left out the spices. I did not fight with the dough; I just pressed half into the pan, and crumbled the other half over the top. These are crumbly, and I really like them that way. They were an explosion of flavor, well worth the sacrifice of a jar of precious homemade marmalade (that takes 3 days to make)! Now I need to make more marmalade!

I was looking for something different and quick to celebrate the (FINAL!) arrival of fall. This was quick and easy. For those who had trouble with the dough, I just took my time and gently pressed into the bottom of the pan and crumbled the reminder over the marmalade. I used store-bought marmalade, but I found it too sweet. I might try using homemade kumquat marmalade, or even sliced apples - kind of apple-pie-like . . . Anyway, the cookie part was good - light and not too sweet. This is a recipe that I think would be fun to experiment on.

These were good. Even my boyfriend who wasn't impressed with the recipe, LOVED them. Recipe calls for 1/4 tsp cloves. I am not a big fan of cloves and may consider using only 1/8 tsp the next time. Once cooled, I sprinkled the bars with powdered sugar for added sweetness.

These bars were very dry and crumbled apart as soon as I cut them apart after cooling.  The cookie part was very strong I might have liked the cookie alone without the marmalade but  I didn't like the cookie and marmalade together, way too sweet.
Will never make these again.

I made them and thought the spices are too strong tasting.  Next time I will omit the cinnamon and cloves.

This is a great recipe I wouldn't change it much but I didn't have any clove so I put in nutmeg.  It tasted great! Also it was a bit dry so I added a some squeezed oranges and also a splash of milk.  Just try it.  This recipe I agree could be great with anything but the orange marmalade is best!!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars fo the taste but would give it a 3 for directions ~ so it's a 4.  The taste is great but not not a summer dessert because it reminds me of Fall harvest, strong cinnamon/clove flavor adds for that fall touch.  The directions, not so good because this is not a dessert dough but more like cookie, roll up in a ball dough.  So I followed the tip from another review of rolling out the top half before putting it on the marmalade. Also warmed the marmalade a bit in the microwave for easy spreading. Will try this with other preserves for a summer taste.

These turned out to be quite fruity, with a nice crunchiness to the crust.  When I patted half of the dough on the pan bottom, I had to work to get it to cover, and was afraid I would wish I had made more, but after baking, I feel it came out just right.  I made half with marmalade and the other half with another jelly, since my kids are not fans of marmalade.  Both were tasty.  Good recipe.
