First one to rate it!  I wasn't sure with rice pilaf and BBQ sauce, but it turned out really good.  They did not sell Knorr rice pilaf at my store so I bought a different brand that had a longer cook time but it worked ok.  I was worried that the chicken would be underdone but since it sat for a bit it was good and not chewy.  Both kids and hubby liked it.  Nice all in one meal I will make it again.  Adults ate it with some sriracha.

Very easy one pot meal. It was just like having a BBQ.
