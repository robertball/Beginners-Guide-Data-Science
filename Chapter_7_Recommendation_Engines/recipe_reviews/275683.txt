This is a moist, very tasty recipe!
I will  definitely make it again 
 I did not frost it, was so good without.
I think if you put frosting on it it might be a little sweet for me 
Again it was very moist.

I loved this cake! The chocolate comes through at the first bite and then a faint pumpkin taste. I was going to frost it with chocolate buttercream but forgot and cut into it! I'm sure the frosting will take it up a notch. Next time I will definitely frost it. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
