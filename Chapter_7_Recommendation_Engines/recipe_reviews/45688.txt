I let the water drain out of the extra firm tofu for a half hour (placing a cutting board on top with a little bit of weight added), then cut the tofu in strips and froze them. The next day I poured boiling water over the frozen tofu for a quick thaw. I sauted the tofu in some olive oil to further firm it up, then proceeded w/the recipe. This really improved the texture of the tofu as the first time I made the recipe I found the tofu to be kind of mushy and soft.  The flavors here are great, even better the next day as left overs. Next time i make it I'll increase the sauce quantity because when serving over rice there's just not enough to keep everyone happy!

This was a fast, easy and nutritious meal. The bok choy at the grocery looked awful, so I substituted a bag of fresh spinach at the last few minutes of cooking and served with couscous instead of rice for a change. My whole family loved it. Husband took the leftovers for lunch the next day, flavors were even better,even over rice leftover from the day before. Will do this often

Fantastic spicy coconut curry flavor. I left out the green onions and basil, and it was still great. I also substituted the bok choy for green cabbage, which was very good. 4 cups, however, I think is excessive. I also fried the tofu first so it held together in cubes, and I sauteed the mushrooms in a bit of olive oil and garlic before adding them to the sauce. Served over Jasmine Rice. I ate the leftovers for lunch and they were even better than dinner, because the coconut and curry flavors had time to really develop overnight. A great recipe, thanks!

I made this for my boyfriend and his roommate (both avid carnivores) and they both liked it very much.  It wasn't quite to my liking because it wasn't solid enough (even over rice) and was just a little bit too spicy.  I will make it again, but may try searing the tofu in a separate pan to give it a solid "skin."  I used extra firm tofu and it still fell apart in the sauce.  I will also use maybe 2/3 of the chili paste, try adding different vegetables, add garlic, and more ginger.  I agree with a previous reviewer - could use some corn starch to thicken it up a bit.  Definitely worth experimenting with though!

Great recipe.  Very flavorful!  I fried the tofu in one tsp. of olive oil before I added it.  Also, do not overcook the vegies; they provide a nice crunchy texture.

My husband loved this so much he didn't notice it was vegetarian until the next day when eating leftovers!  He then said that the Tofu tasted really good and it was okay with him if we had tofu instead of chicken in this dish in the future.
This dish was so easy to make.  I used canned diced (drained) tomatoes and canned mushrooms because that's what I had handy.  I used less green onions and less minced fresh ginger (too lazy to mince more) and added a tad bit more brown sugar.  My coconut milk can said "coconut cream" but the only ingredient to speak of was coconut milk.  This came out so creamy.  I suggest adding other spices for those who want a more complex flavor. We cooked and diced potatoes on the side and then added it later.  To compensate I added extra curry and chili sauce(brand with the rooster on it).  We'll be having this dish again soon!

I had never made tofu before and stumbled on to this recipe; it's delicious.  What a fantastic blend of color, taste, texture, and spices; a feast for the eyes, nose, mouth, and belly!  Thanks Kathy for sharing this recipe and for making my first experience with tofu so memorable.  I'll definitely make this one again.

Can't believe anyone would describe this recipe as bland.  I found it quite hot and spicy.  Maybe it depends on the type of chili paste you use.  I used the kind that comes from the asian grocery that has lots of seeds in it and a picture of a rooster on the front.  Also substituted Thai red curry for the curry powder.  Really tasty and exotic. Lots of flavor for a vegetarian dish. Thanks for sharing!

Great flavor.I have to be careful about things being too spicy so I'm experimenting with amount of chili paste and curry. Most importantly, it fits with my Weight Watchers Program at only 4 pts per serving.

This was so wonderful. My husband loved it, this one will be a regular. I didn't even use any chile past (i couldn't find any, i am not sure i know what it is)Any way it was still wonderful.

Very tasty!  Kept it mild for my little ones, but added Sriracha to mine for the kick.  For those of you who do not like the texture of tofu, here are some tricks that help firm it up a bit. You can do all or one of these techniques depending on how much firmer you would like it to be.  Unwrap and drain you tofu the day before you are planning to use it. Place between paper towels and press gently then wrap in new paper towels, place in a plastic baggie and return to refrigerator until ready to use. If you do not have long before you want to use it you can drain and press as before, but then slice it and place on cookie sheet in the oven set to 150 and leave for 20-30 min.  Hope this helps.

This is a good basic recipe. First, I browned the tofu in some oil. If you add the oil and tofu TOGETHER when the pan is still cool, it won't splatter dangerously once it gets hot. I skipped the green onions and used one regular onion instead, thinly sliced. Then I lightly browned the onions in oil, added the ginger and mushrooms until soft (I like mushrooms well-done). Then, I added some broccoli, stir-fried for a few moments, THEN added the coconut milk, and other wet ingredients. I also used some veggie broth to cut down the richness of the coconut milk. (I was shocked when I realized that one can of regular coconut milk contains nearly 1000 calories!) I used "Thai Kitchen" red chili paste (fabulous stuff, but hot), and added a few teaspoons of "Thai Kitchen" fish oil. Cut back on the soy if you use fish oil, as it is very salty. Very tasty. Served it over some brown basmati rice.

This recipe was great! I made it with Chicken instead of tofu and did without the tomatoes or bok choy. It tasted amazing and even my picky siblings who were visting loved it!

This was the first time I'd ever cooked with Tofu so it may have been me but I thought it was kinda soggy. I even followed suggestions and got the extra firm and tried frying it (although no one said how long so I may not have fried it long enough). The dish did have good flavor though so I'll give it four stars.

I enjoyed the dish. It was tasty and for those who claimed it was bland, I disagree. This recipe had a lot of flavor. After cutting the tofu into cubes, I baked it in the oven at 425 for about 25 mins. (A healthy alternative to frying) The tofu is more solid and doesn't break apart this way when cooked with the dish. My biggest PROBLEM with this recipe is that it was WAY TOO WATERY! I don't understand how people were making extra sauce because there "wasn't enough". There was plenty! I had to add cornstarch to thicken it up. I served it over rice to soak up all the extra sauce.

This is a great dish--my husband even loved it and he hates curry dishes.  Next time I will not cover it to cook--we found that covering it cooks the veggies too long and renders too much liquid (watering down the sauce) taking away from the flavor.  Definitely will make this again though!!

Loved this!  I followed most of the directions.  However, I drained, diced my tofu, and then placed it on a cookie sheet in a 175 degree oven for 30 minutes.  I then browned it in a pan with coconut oil to give it a nice crispiness.  I didn't add tofu into mixture until I added the bok choy.  I used Curry Paste in place of curry powder.  We also love spicy foods, so I added about 1/2 TB sriracha sauce.  Served over Jasmine rice and it was delicious.  We are not vegetarians but like to eat vegetarian a few times a week.  This is a definite keeper recipe that we both loved.  You can easily tweak it to your liking.  Thank you very much for sharing!  :O)

This was my second recipe I tried with tofu and really enjoyed it! I didn't have bok choy on hand, so I used another reviewer suggestion of using spinach and only used about 2 cups.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a really good recipe. I like it with Napa cabbage too, if you can't get good bok choy. I did cut the soy sauce in half though, as I try to make things less salty, and it was still very good and easy. I know it's vegetarian, but I use this similar recipe poured over homemade cashew chicken and it's amazing.

Just a fantastic curry recipe! Great flavor and surprisingly healthy, especially if made with light coconut milk. I'm vegetarian and my fiance is very much not vegetarian, and both of us enjoyed it equally. Bonus- it's very easy to make.     And as a sidenote, some people have complained about the consistency, but curries like this are supposed to be thin. They're intended to be served over rice. Don't expect an American-style thick, creamy sauce.

This is fantastic!  I dredged the tofu in a little corn starch before adding it, and the sauce was somewhat thicker for it.  I used galangal instead of the ginger and a Thai curry paste instead of the powder.  I also used Thai basil for the basil.  My daughter said it was the most delicious thing I have ever made!

excellent and very easy dish.  I used dried shitake mushrooms (that I reconstituted in water of course).  For the chili paste I wasn't sure if it meant plain old chili paste like Sambal Oelek, or the chili paste that is actually made for curries and comes in a red or green variety?  I chose to use the red curry paste and it turned out wonderful.  I think next time I might leave out the yellow pepper (didn't seem to go well with the dish) and add frozen peas and bamboo shoots instead.  Served it with brown rice (which I over cooked a little....but as a result gave it a paella-like crunch) and was in heaven.

Seriously how is this recipe almost 5 stars? Maybe people who have made this have never had a true coconut curry, because this recipe is bland and flavorless. Huge disappointment.

This is a good basic recipe. As other reviewers have suggested, I used one finely diced regular onion instead of the green onions, and substituted some of the bok choy in the recipe for other vegetables such as broccoli, baby corn and spinach.  I also used only two tomatoes and used baby bok choy for the bok choy because it's more tender.  I lightly browned the tofu in some chili oil, and then sauted the onions in the oil, and added the ginger and mushrooms.  Then, I added the broccoli, baby corn and the bell-pepper, stir-fried for a few moments, and then added the coconut milk, and other wet ingredients to the same pan. After letting the mixture boil covered for a few minutes, I added the bok choy and the basil.  I used Chinese garlic chilli paste (Lee Kum Kee).  I also suggest adding more than the written amount of all of the spices because otherwise this dish would be very bland.  Just because we like our food very spicy, I had added about double the amount of the curry powder and brown sugar.  The dish tasted delicious by itself with the additional spices.  But, when I paired it with the rice, it became very, very bland and I had to add an additional amount of soy sauce.  Next time, i think I will add more soy sauce, at least 1 1/2 tablespoons of curry powder and double the brown sugar.  I think I will also follow other reviewers suggestions and add a little cornstarch to thicken the gravy.  But, there will definitely be a next time!  Overall, it was delicious!

This recipe is just great, it actually comes the closest to authentic Thai curry but without all the fat and oil. I have been looking for a healthy and lower calorie way to make curry. I also added about 1/4 cup of chicken stock so the curry wouldn't be so thick. You can also use vegtable stock with the same results. I also added baby corn. This was AWESOME, thank you. This is definetly a keeper!!!!!!

This is one of my favorite recipes on the website.  I'm a carnivore, but this kind of dish could make me a vegetarian.  I utilized the helpful hints of other reviewers (drained and seared tofu).  We couldn't stop eating this great dish.

This was so easy and so delicious.  Be careful not to overcook.  It needs less than 10 minutes to be perfect.

I used the curry as a base, then added tofu and other vegetables ...perfect taste.
My family enjoyed, and my daughter who is a Thai food lover asked me what restaurant I ordered my curry from?!!!
Thanks for the recipe Kathy

This was my third try on a thai curry.  The first two were disappointing.  This one totally worked out.  My wife just said "can you star that one?"  I used cilantro rather than basil and bok choy, because it's what we had.  I never used long chunks of green onions like this.  That was fantastic.  Looking over the recipe, looks like I skipped the tomatoes and mushrooms and used a regular onion instead.  OK.  Maybe I didn't even make the recipe exactly as it was laid out, but the spices were great.  Oh, wait, I skipped the sugar and doubled the curry powder because I didn't have curry paste.  You know what, I think I'm going to have to try this recipe out, it looks great.

This was AWESOME!!!! I also coated the tofu in flour and fried for a crunchier texture and used spinach in place of bok choy. The sauce was delish and even better the next day! My husband loved it too!

This was the first meal I made with tofu and I wasn't disappointed! Tons of flavour but not overly spicy (husband doesn't like too spicy) Only a couple changes- used 3 roma tomatos instead of 4 and 350g of tofu (as that was the size of package) and it was about perfect for us! Only change I would probably make is dice the tofu and tomatoes a little smaller. Will definitely make this again- and maybe try it with chicken!

This was a great recipe!  I used half the amount of green onion than what was called for.  I also used regular coconut milk.  Sauce was not thin, almost too think.  Other wise, thank you for posting this recipe Kathy! Will be making this again.

I really loved the combination of flavors. My husband really liked it. I think it's important to follow some simple steps to improve the taste and texture of the tofu. Using a brick or heavy can to smash extra water out of it, as well as freezing it will improve texture. This dish tasted MUCH better the next day after the flavors had a chance to meld. I will be making this one again.

I thought this was just OK (a bit bland), but my husband really liked it. I prepared it differently by sauteing the onions and other veggies (except the tomatoes) while heating the sauce in a separate pot, then I added the sauce to the veggies--otherwise it would have been like eating boiled vegetables, which I hate. I also used 6 oz of shiitakes, but I thought it could have used more. I'd make this again with more coconut milk, fewer tomatoes, and lots more mushrooms, and I'd adjust/modify the spices for more flavor.

This is such a delicious healthy fast recipe. I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used 1/8 tsp ginger powder and a little lemon juice to try to recreate the fresh ginger bite. It would probably be better with fresh ginger, but it was delicious this way, too. I didn't have bok choy, so I used 4 cups of baby spinach added 2 minutes before cooking time was over to wilt- DELICIOUS. I will definitely make this recipe again.

It was healthy, and there was a lot of vegetable added into it, but that is where this recipe ended for me. It was food. I didn't think it was remarkable.

Very easy and quick to make!
The smell of the sauce is delicious and overall it came out very good! I used spinach and green pepper instead of yellow pepper and bok choy. 
It is also a very light meal.

I don't understand why this recipe has a high rating.  The sauce is watery & bland, & if you don't follow the other reveiwers advice the tofu is pure mush. I had to add more curry, chile paste, soy sauce, ginger, and added shredded coconut and garlic powder just to get a taste out of the dish. I honestly don't know how anyone could rate this high unless they add everything I just stated and rate their own version of this dish which is exactly what they did.

I was discouraged when reading some of the bad 
reviews but after making it I've figured it out: You have to have some amount of cooking finesse to get this dish just right. If you are not naturally a good cook, there is room in the recipe for it to not turn out right. I have to admit I strayed a little from the recipe because I didn't have all the stuff for it. I also applied some common sense to make it a little better. I didn't have brown sugar, ginger, chili paste, bok choy, bell pepper or mushrooms. What I did have was green onions, white onion, potato, tomatoes, soy sauce, date sugar, chili flakes, tofu, fresh basil (a must here), broccoli, spinach and coconut milk. I simmered the sauce on the side while sauteeing the 1" cubed potato and tofu until slightly browned. Added rest of veggies except that I kept 1/2 the basil and green onion towards the end. Took 1/3 the simmering sauce, added it to veggies, then just as veggies were at right texture, added the rest of the sauce and finished it off, laying it on top of plates of brown rice. Very very good! It was extremely flavorful and anyone who says it is bland must have a dead tongue.

One of the best tofu recipes I have ever made.  I used baby bok choy which worked nicely, and pressed the water out of the tofu prior to adding it to the recipe.  The cocunut, chili paste, and basil aromas from this dish are wonderful, and it reheats well the next day.

Deliciously fragrant and ultra-spicy!  I used hot curry powder and garlic chili paste (twice the amount called for in the recipe).  I also added a diced potato and some fresh peas.  My boyfriend is still raving about it!

This recipe was very good although I thought it was quite bland. The second time I made it, I used a small canned thai red curry, stir fried that for about 5 mins, then added 2 can coconut milk and whatever veggies and it came out delicious.

This recipe is fabulous!  Some changes...after I added the basil and bok choy, I cooked it for only one more minute...and tossed in most of the green onion in the last thirty seconds.  Also, my chili paste had some extra garlic, which added another tasty dimension to the dish!

VERY good.  The base sauce for this is simple and tasty.  You can easily use this for a "leftovers" meal at the end of the week when you need to get rid of big and ends of veggies.

Well, I kind of made this recipe.  I skipped tomatoes, and simply upped the mushrooms and pepper.  I also used organic tamari instead of soy sauce, and turbinado sugar which makes this dish pretty well vegan.  Even once I'm done with my month-long vegetarian experiment, I'll still make this.

great flavor!  we only had curry paste on hand (rather than powder) and we substituted some of the vegetables for ones we had on hand.  and i accidentally left out some of the soy sauce.  still, it was excellent.  will definitely make again.

I used red cabbage instead of bok choy. It's what I had. Cook it first as it takes longer. I had cauliflower and broccoli so I added that. I used extra firm tofu I had pressed the water out of and baked slowly in the oven spritzed with Braggs Liquid Aminos. It's better for you than soy sauce and you won't be able to tell the difference. You can find it in the natural section of larger grocery stores. I used red curry paste and also so red chili hot oil paste to bring up the heat. You can add just about any vegetable you want. I also added bean sprouts. Just cook the ones that take the longest to cook first. I served this over rice noodles. Quinoa is another good choice and gives a different option than just rice all the time. I also topped it with extra scallions and chopped peanuts.

I made this recipe as is and it was indeed really runny. Good flavor, but the consistency was way off. I seared the tofu to firm it up a little more and I cooked the veggies for about 20 mins so that they wouldn't be so crunchy. I would reccommend using regular coconut milk. True, there is more fat, but the fat is necessary to hold the dish together and keep it from becoming soup. Also, for a better flavor, add some lemongrass. Just make sure to cut it finely because it doesn't soften when cooked. The brown sugar seemed superfluous and you can leave it out without any difference in taste. Also, green curry is a lot more complementary than the standard yellow if you're able to get it.

This is very good. I made the tofu separately. I drained it and marinated the cubes with a little soy sauce. Then I threw the cubes in a skillet with some garlic and ginger. I like having the tofu a little crunchy on the outside. I didn't add additional soy sauce other than the 3 tablespoons in the beginning. I also didn't add additional salt and it was still very good.

AMAZING! I didn't think I liked tofu, but now I do! My suggestion would be to add a bit more sugar and a bit less onion. This could also be made with chicken instead of the tofu.

This was pretty tasty. Nice blend of veggies and exotic spices. A great way to kick up the bland flavor of tofu and create a unique meal!

This recipe rocks! Fairly quick and easy. I would suggest either frying the tofu or patting it dry before you put it in the curry.

Delicious and easy. I made this in the early afternoon, popped it in the refrigerator, then heated it up over rice for dinner. I will definitely make it again. I might try adding fish sauce, lime juice and some lemongrass next time though!

This was good but it didn't stand out. I wouldn't really make this again unless I changed a lot of it. I did make the recipe exactly as offered so perhaps using some of the recommendations would change it around. The tofu did take on the flavor nicely and I loved all of the different vegetables but there was something about this dish that wasn't too memorable.

Very good! I took the suggestions of some prior reviews and pressed the block of tofu under a cutting board with a dictionary for about an hour, and then I cubed it and fried it in a bit of olive oil. I used 2 tablespoons instead of 2 teaspoons of Sriracha chile sauce. It was VERY hot. I couldn't find bok choy, so I used baby spinach, which was fine. I also didn't have fresh basil or fresh ginger, so I used dried. The ginger was fine, but I wasn't crazy about dried basil and I think fresh would be much better. I served it over brown rice. Overall, the dish was very tasty and quick and easy to make!

As written, this recipe is a little bland for my taste. Overall a great recipe, though; I will make this again with double the spices next time.

This tasted amazing! I ended up adding a little cayenne pepper because it seemed like it needed a little spice. Next time I'll remember to start the rice at the right time so I dont have to let the veggies go for longer than called for! lol Other than that, the dish was awesome, and leftovers were even better as the tofu soaked up more sauce. Great!!

This recipe is the best thing ever!

I was never a fan of curry but I LOVE this dish. I Love to make it extra spicy with chicken and I think the bok choy is amazing. I pile it in!!


Thanks!

I added double soy sauce, chile paste (with rooster on it), double curry powder, double salt, double ginger and double sugar.  Also, baked tofu slightly before frying so its crispy.  Added slightly steamed potatoes in fry pan, and some carrots with the ginger.  Then added to boiling coconut curry mix, along with broccoli. And at the end, I added bok choy, some nuts and PINEAPPLE!  I used half a can of pineapple, and it added a sweet flavor - delicious.

My son picked this as his first meal to make for our family (with help from mom ofcourse!)and everyone loved it!  It was a very mild curry to our tastes so we added more chili paste.  The only things I will add in the future would be garlic and lemongrass.  Overall it was excellent!

This is an easy, flavourful recipe that can take a lot of variation and is good the day it's cooked or as leftovers.  I use extra-firm, pressed tofu and saute it briefly before proceeding. I've never used light coconut milk as it thins out sauces imo.

I absolutely love this recipe and make it often but I tweek it to my liking. I follow steps 1 and 2 and in a separate pan saute the veggies and tofu together so that the flavors meld and the tofu is cooked through (in a little chicken broth or olive oil).  I chop 5 heads baby bok choi and triple or so the fresh ginger, and increase most of the other flavorings especially the chili paste and add chopped water chestnuts, but decrease the green onions and soy sauce. After veggies are semi-cooked, I add them to the coconut mixture and cook until thickened. Serve over Mahatma white or jasmine rice ... YUMMY!

Delicious! I didn't know what kind of chile paste to use, so I used some Thai red curry paste that I had instead, and it was quite spicy. I only used a few green onions, because I thought 2 bunches sounded like way too much for my taste.

My 1yo son was the only person who ate this and he just picked out the pieces of tofu. I thought it was pretty bland, even with additional spices added. I followed the recipe as written. I wouldn't make this again, sorry.

I really liked this recipe and so did my partner. He actually didn't realise that he was eating tofu until I told him. It was delicious, easy to make and the aromas wafting through our home while it was cooking were mouth watering!! I added green curry paste instead of curry powder, I used a little to much chilli so I added a squeeze of lemon juice that helped to tame the burn. I will defiantly add this recipe to my repertoire, tasted great!

This is a foolproof recipe that has great flavor and makes for fantastic leftovers!  Don't leave out the bok choy...it adds a lot to this dish.  We left out the chile paste and used green or red curry paste instead, and added a bit of chile powder...great results.

I've made this recipe about four times now, and it's become one of my favorites.  It is fantastic, and is even better the next day after the flavors have had time develop.  The only thing I would recommend is to add a little white sugar if you want more of the restaurant style, sweet coconut flavor.  Definitely worth trying.

Whenever I have tried coconut curries at restaurants I couldn't more than a few spoonfuls without getting a stomach ache.  The coconut was too strong for my taste.  This recipe has it down perfect.  I had several cans of regular coconut milk (took out about 1/2 cup of cream) that I needed to use up.  I love this recipe!

Based on what I had in the kitchen, I used regular onion, powdered ginger, pepper flakes instead of chili paste, spinach instead of bok choy.  One day before, I pressed the tofu block and then froze it to get a decent consistency.  Yum!!!

This was delicious! My husband is not big on vegetarian foods, especially tofu, but he approved! It had an excellent flavor. I left out the tomatoes, and served it over white rice.

Super yummy and very easy to make. This was my first attempt at making tofu so I took recommendations from previous reviews and drained the tofu, and seared until golden brown. I used spinach instead of Bok Choy (you need about 8+ cups of spinach). I also was liberal on all the spices. Came out great, everyone loved. Thanks!

This dish was very yummy overall.  The only things I would change next time would be to use regular coconut milk instead of light (the sauce was a bit thin), and to add more curry powder and chili paste.  Otherwise, it was perfect.  I will definitely be making this again!

I love tofu and this receipe hit the spot! I will say that next time I make this I will use half regular coconut milk and half lite.  I like my sauce a little thicker.  I left out the mushrooms and bok choy.  I used fresh spinach instead.  Also used dried basil and red peppers instead of yellow, green chile paste as well as canned tomatoes.  I did not want to have to go to the store, so I used whatever I had at home. For the tofu, I pan fried it first in coconut oil, because  of preference, and it was delicious!!! Overall this recipe is pretty darn good!

Mmmm, good!  Great, quick week night meal.  Next time I'll have hubby help with the chopping though!  :)  I only used one bunch of onions and thought that was plenty.  Next time I'll increase the chile paste because we like things a bit spicier.  I thought it was enough sauce for the rice, made a good size meal.  Thanks Kathy!

I often see "add salt (and/or pepper) to taste" on recipes and I get devastated.  I understand they're trying to tell us we can adjust the amount of saltiness as we like but if the recipe is absolutely foreign to you, it is very difficult to figure out how much is the right amount because you have no idea how it's supposed to taste like.  I always wish they would put the amount so if I like it certain way, I would adjust it from there but I usually like to try the recipe as it's written first.  Anyways, this curry was okay at first.  It wasn't flavorful as I wished.  So I doubled the curry powder and brown sugar then cooked it longer.  I think I will also double the chili paste next time.  When we had it for dinner, I wasn't very impressed by it but when I had it for lunch next day, the flavor finally came out and tasted much better.  I have many vegetarian friends so I will make this again but I'll make sure to make it at least a day before.

The whole family loved this one. Both my boys even like the little bit of heat and the tofu. I used spinach instead of bok choy as I already had it on hand. I did use a little more sugar as it balanced out the heat for the kids. I will definitely make this easy and delicious meal again.

This was good! I was hoping to duplicate the curry from our favorite Thai restaurant but this didn't even come close.  That's ok though, it was tasty in itself.  I doubled the sauce ingredients because I wanted a saucy curry.  I too, fried the tofu because from past experience I didn't like how gets mushy otherwise.  I didn't add salt at all.  Followed everything else to a T.  The green onion spears on top are a must!!! They add a nice crunch and burst of fresh to each bite! Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

really really delicious.  Halved this and had 3 large portions.  No chile paste so I used red curry paste which was quite lovely.  Served it over brown rice but will try it again next week over soba noodles!

Awesome tofu recipe.  I needed something quick for dinner and this was a big hit with my husband.  I didn't have any green onion so I used a half of a sweet onion.  I used 1 tsp of brown sugar (Splenda) instead of only 1/2 tsp.  I only used the 3 tablespoons of soy sauce in step number 2, after letting it boil I didn't feel that it need anymore.   I didn't have any bok choy so I used fresh bag of spinach.  This will be a weekly dish in our home and I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I loved this sauce, but did leave out the chili paste since I don't like spicy food. I also fried the tofu a bit first to make it firmer, then added the green onion and so forth.  I substituted mushrooms with a package of edamame since I don't like mushrooms.

This was sooo tasty (and nutritious!). I left out the bok choy because the grocery store I went to didn't have any fresh and I wanted to avoid using the canned kind. Besides that, I followed the recipe as is and served it over brown rice! Can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow

I actually altered this recipe by adding snow peas, straw mushrooms, baby corn, bamboo and chopped greens instead of bok choy.  I used an extra can of coconut CREAM to thicken it up and tripled the curry.  I also added 3 tbsp. of nutritional yeast flakes.  Served with jasmine rice. This is one of the best dishes I've made at home!  Everyone loved it.  I'll be making it again.

Great sauce!  I was looking for this sauce after having something similar in a resturant.  The vegetables in this recipe didn't apeal to me so I just made the sauce in a separate pan.  Then I pan fried the tofu in a little oil until it was golden on all sides.  I then removed the tofu and added frozen stir fry veggies.  When the veggies were almost done I added the tofu back with the fresh green onion, then poured the sauce over everything and let it warm to boiling before serving over rice.  Wonderful!

Very good.  I recalculated recipe for 4 but kept to the original 6 servings for the sauce...we like a lot of sauce!  I added extra chili paste.  Sauteed veggies in a wok separately and boiled sauce in sauce pan then poured on top of veggies.  To firm up the tofu: slice it, dip in eggs and fry it.  It holds better afterward.

This was pretty good.  It needed a lot of salt to make it taste flavorful.  I used baby corn instead of mushrooms and that was perfect!  Adding a bit of cornstarch also made the consistency just perfect.

Only giving 4 stars because I used chicken instead of tofu and didn't use green onions.  Might try tofu next time.  Other than that, it was delicious.  Will definitely make again.

A really great recipe to spice up dinner - literally! I didn't have chili paste, so instead I used red cayenne pepper. One tspn of the stuff knocked my socks off! I'll go for 1/2 next time... I only had two stalks of green onion and half a pound of tofu - which I froze for about an hour and then baked for 30 minutes on 150* - it stayed soft but held together. Really very easy, very healthy and wonderfully different!

I followed the steps but I tweaked the recipe a little bit because it tasted kinda bland. 1.) First, I seasoned the tofu with seasoned salt and I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic (minced) in olive oil and then fried the tofu in the oil 2.) I used 5 tablespoons of brown sugar. 3.) I used all of the 1/4 cup of soy sauce to the milk instead of 3 tbsp. and I also added 3 cloves of garlic (minced). 4.) I mixed the basil with the tomatoes, mushrooms and bell peppers. 5.) I added 1 teaspoon of seasoned salt. It was delish!!! My boyfriend and I loved it so much that I made it twice in one week. It taste just like the yellow curry that I order at every Thai restaurant I go to. Look at the picture...mmm...looking at it makes me drool.

Very tasty dish, that I found needed only half of the chili paste and extra garlic.  All of the ingredients turned out delicious over Jasmine rice.  
I did press the water out of the tofu and pan fry with peanut oil and garlic.

Very tasty. Freezing the firm tofu before using it is key to the texture of the tofu in this one. I halved the amount of curry paste as that stuff can be volcanic (especially the red stuff) so be careful if you don't like spicy food. Otherwise a quick, delicious meal.

This is one of the most delicious things I have ever had/made!  It was so incredible.  Thank you for the recipe and all the great suggestions.  I modified mine a bit, here is what I did:

I used purple cabbage instead of bok choy, left out the tomatoes and chili stuff and basil.  Used HONEY instead of sugar, the honey goes so well with coconut and curry!  I also had coconut paste(the cream from the top of the coconut milk)I had gotten from work(at a juice bar) I added.  I added granulated garlic and simmered for along time and baked the tofu first for firmness.  It was incredible!  Hope this helps and enjoy!!!

i did without the ginger and used chili garlic instead of chile paste and it was still delicious! i used 2 tomatoes instead of 4 since it seemed like a lot but would do without the tomatoes next time.

This was really good. At first I was a little turned off by the taste but then I let it sit for about 10 minutes so the flavours would absorb well. I served it with fragrant rice....Oh my goodness, Que rrrico!!

I have made this several times and it turns out great.  I added a little more curry and some red pepper flakes to spice it up.  I also like regular coconut milk vs. "lite".

This dish is very good and I loved the coconut-curry twist.  I agree, this recipe is not bland whatsoever. I served this receipe over Japanese noodles, but would recommend white or brown rice as it would soak up some of the excess better than noodles.

My husband (non vegan) just loved this. I didn't have bok choy so I used beet greens, and since I had some in the fridge, used shitake mushroom. It was one of the best. Plan to make it for some very fussy vegan friends. Served it with mashed sweet potato.

I liked the way this turned out.  However, the curry was very mild, and I would have enjoyed more spice overall.  Next time I will add some hot pepper perhaps.  I will make this again for sure!!  **NOTE:  I used regular napa cabbage rather than bok choy the second time I made it, and the texture was fabulous!

This is a great dish and very exotic tasting....couldn't get any better even in a restaurant. The tofu can be left out or even substituted with a different type of protein source (chicken...etc.) The flavors are so amazing together. I will make this recipe again and again.

Healthy & wholesome. A perfect comfort meal for cold weather. It is a very balanced vegetarian dish that satiates any carnivore & non-curry eater. All ingredients are easy to find. Easy prep work & cooks in minutes. Pour over brown rice. Had no difficulty cooking this recipe for the first time. Turned out delicious!

This was perfect just the way it is written. Both me and my mom loved it. It is simple to make. I also drained the Tofu and let it sit to get the liquid out of it. Next time I would use full Coconut Milk instead of the light so the sauce would be thicker.

I really like this recipe. Instead of bok choy, I used rainbow chard. Next time I will try the recipe with less soy sauce; I think 3 tablespoons will be enough. I used 1/4 cup like the recipe calls for.

Like many others, I substituted spinach for bok choy. I also added twice the amount of mushrooms. What a delicious recipe. Thank you so much! Definitely a keeper.

This was delicious.  We had to make a few minor changes based on the season and what we had at hand.  We used red curry paste instead of powder, sirachi chili sauce instead of paste and added a couple of diced thai chili peppers, and canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh since it's still winter and I can't stand greenhouse tomatoes.  We loved it.  Can't wait to make this in the summer when we can use fresh tomatoes, peppers, and thai basil from our garden.

I made this and it was delicious. I cut my tofu into little triangles and dry fried it a bit before making the recipe to try to improve the texture a little and it didn't fall apart as bad as it probably would have. I used regular coconut milk instead of light and a pinch of dried basil instead of fresh because its what I had. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly. It was delicious over jasmine rice! Would definitely make again:)

Delicious recipe! Just the right amount of heat and flavor. Make it as written except I browned the tofu in a thin layer of oil over med-high heat prior to adding. So scrumptious.

This recipe had such high reviews that I was super excited to try it, but this was a fail for me... If you make it I suggest the following (which I didn't do, but wish I had) 1) stir fry the veggies and spices in one pan 2) bring the wet ingredients to a boil in another pan with a little corn starch to thicken the sauce 3) double or triple the ginger and brown sugar 4) use less than half of the soy sauce and leave out the salt. I also wrapped the tofu in paper towels and placed a weight on top of that for 1 hour to firm it up a bit

I changed all the veggies (only had a bag of frozen zucchini and peas, 1 can diced tomatoes, and 1 carrot).  I hate soy sauce in curries and subbed in fish sauce (only ~2 tbsp).  I realize this makes it less vegan, but meh.  I also doubled my curry powder and put in my Vietnamese chili garlic sauce instead of chili paste.  Despite all the changes, this came out really tasty and could definitely point newcomers to curry in the right direction.

My non-vegetarian husband loves this dish!  It's extremely flavorful, with a great blend of seasonings.  A definite repeat recipe. **I couldn't find chile paste, so I got red curry paste for a substitute. It tastes great!

Very good and easy to make- I suggest adding a little extra salt, and red pepper flakes for those that like it spicy!! We ate this with rice, but it's hearty enough to eat without. Highly recommend!

Wow, this is delicious! I used super-firm sprouted tofu, which I cubed and pan-fried beforehand to give it a crispy "skin." I set it aside and added it to the dish at the last minute to prevent it from getting soggy. Omitted the mushrooms (boyfriend doesn't like) in favor of extra tofu, and used fresh spinach instead of bok choy because the selection at the supermarket looked a little sad. I could only find regular coconut milk, but I think the extra creaminess was worth the calories! Served with steamed rice, this was great!

Very good.  Once all the chopping is done this recipe cooks up very quickly and tastes great.  I originally gave it 4 stars but changed it to 5 because it tastes even better the next day.  I'm just loving it.

This is a very good recipe that can be versatile depending on your tastes. I did not have peppers or tomatoes, but I used snow peas.  I did feel the need to thicken the sauce a little with cornstarch like some other reviewers. I also added shrimp to mine to get even more protein into it. I did not have chile paste, but I did have chili garlic sauce (jar with rooster picture on it), and I used about a 1/4 cup because I like the spiciness. I would make this again because the flavors of the chili, curry, coconut and basil are phenomenal together!

I used this recipe as a sauce base for chicken, not tofu and it was delicious. I made many substitutions because of my limited pantry: I used chile in oil instead of chile paste, I substituted broccoli for mushrooms, ground ginger for fresh and I upped the curry powder by another teaspoon. Next time I will definitely use fresh ginger for added zip. This is a keeper - thanks for sharing!

Very easy recipe that I will definitely try again. As suggested in other reviews: I will definitely fry the cubed tofu w/minced garlic in olive oil! It will improve the texture/flavor; and, for people who aren't familiar with this type of food, serving w/a good rice is almost a must! At a good Thai restaurant it's served w/lots of liquid and a side bowl of rice to dump in. Eat it up with a spoon! All in all, this is a great recipe I will share with friends.

I liked it but bf didn't so won't be a do again. Could have used some direction on how to firm up the tofu. I figured it out too little too late.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  Our family is transitioning into a "meatless" lifestyle and this dish has really helped us learn to enjoy tofu. I sauteed the tofu with some chopped up bits of the leftover white parts of the green onion and some fresh minced garlic.  This firmed it up nicely and gave it a little more flavor. My husband is not a huge fan of mushrooms but is willing to learn to like them, I have found that whenever I saute them first before adding them to a dish he comments that they are actually good, so I did it for this recipe.  He loves this meal, we have had it with rice noodles and brown rice. Both were delicious.  We've never eaten bok choy before and love it in here, we would miss it if it were missing.

Liked this so well that I'm now at my daughter's making it for the second time this week.  We used chicken instead of tofu, added some garlic and at the table topped it with sweet chili sauce - Awesome recipe.  This will become a fav.

I did stirfry the tofu first which did make it firmer and create a skin.  Otherwise followed the recipe except used regular coconut milk and spinach instead of bok choy.  Used chili sauce instead of paste.  Yum!

This was an easy and delicious base recipe, although I mostly used it s a jumping off point. I stuck with the coconut milk (I used light), tofu and tomatoes, but for the rest I substituted the veggies I had (sweet white onion, cabbage, string beans, spinach).  I used all the herbs and spices but increased them quite a lot and added fresh cilantro. Next time I think I'll add thai peanut sauce!

This was fantastic!  One of the best recipes I have tried on this site.  I found the tofu to be unnecessary so I will leave it out next time and get protien from quinoa.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe.

If too spicy is an issue, try pondicherry curry.  It has the flavor with out the heat.  My hubby & I have this problem, he can't eat it, and I think it's perfect.

Good base recipe! Needed to add a tablespoon of yellow curry paste, and then it was tres bon! I wanted to get rid of a bunch of veggies in my fridge so instead I used half of an onion, a few mushrooms, and 3 bell peppers (yellow and red) along with the firm cubed tofu.

This was delicious.  I used a different mix of veggies (what I had on hand - squash, red pepper, shredded carrots).  I also ran out of soy sauce so I used half teriyaki.  The basil and scallions add a nice touch.  I also added about 1 tb. ground flaxseed.

This is a fantastic starter Thai recipe! I browned the tofu before adding the veggies & I added extra veggies (carrots, asparagus & chard..no bok choy) I would definitely recommend adding less soy sauce (I used the 3Tbs & no salt) and a LOT more spice. A very flexible recipe. YUM!

This was very good. I used red Thai curry paste in place of the curry powder and took the sodium down a notch by adding a little less soy sauce and no extra salt. Next time, I will add fresh coriander. I like to cook tofu about twice a month and I think this will be it for a while. UPDATE: I tried this again, using chicken breast cut into chunks (dredged in flour and browned in olive oil) and this time added the coriander.  Even better the next day!

This might be the best thing I've ever made.  It's absolutely bursting with flavor, and despite the coconut milk, this is not at all bad for you.  Eating one serving with a half cup of rice ends up being about ten weight watchers points.  I did make two minor changes.  I used spinach instead of bok choy (just because the left over spinach would be easier to convince people in my house to eat up), and I added an extra swirl of srirachi - maybe about a tablespoon's worth.  Burn your mouth off spicy, just the way we like it.  This is definitely going to be a staple in my house.  I look forward to making this again.

The first time I made this I marked we loved it but I just made it again and followed the recipe exactly and we didn't so I'm averaging it out to 3 stars. Won't be trying it again - too many other good curry recipes. I think a lot of it might have to do with the curry powder you use.

My husband and I are big curries eaters, and I have tried probably 20 or so different curry recipes (many from this site). As far as the sauce goes, this was probably our least favorite. We enjoy spicy foods, and to us, this sauce tasted like what it was . . . watered down (because of the vegetable juices) coconut milk with just a hint of curry and ginger. That said, the blend of vegetables was marvelous, and I will use the same combination again in the future with a different sauce (perhaps a green curry, for example). Like several other reviewers, I sautéed the tofu on its own before adding it to the sauce (I added a little ginger, curry, and cayenne to the tofu before sauteeing, and I opted for sesame oil). The tofu held together well and I think it benefited from the added spices. If you want to try this recipe and you like spicy foods, I suggest spicing up your tofu before sauteeing it, and when preparing the sauce, I suggest measuring your ginger, curry, and green chili paste VERY generously. [LATER...] I just made a red curry (using 3 Tbsp thai kitchen red curry paste, 2 cans of coconut milk, 2 Tbsp fish sauce, and 1/4 cup brown sugar) using the vegetables and tofu from this recipe. It was fabulous!

Loved this recipe.  The combination of coconut and curry is fantastic!  The only change I made was with the tofu.  Preparing according to the recipe, the tofu can get all mashed apart.  To avoid this and to firm it up, I drained the tofu, cut it up into cubes and then soaked it in a mixture of half water and half Bragg Liquid Aminos (like soy sauce except a little better IMO).  Then I drained the tofu and sauteed it in a tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat until lightly browned.  Then I added it to the dish only a minute before serving.  
As written, I'd give this recipe 5 stars, but I think this change makes it even better (texture and aesthetics).  This is a staple in our house of meat-eaters, and they never complain.

Was disappointed in this dish. The sauce is thin and weak. Needs something. Not the rich flavorful taste I was hoping for.

This was delicious, although not as spicy as I would have liked.  Next time I think I may marinate the tofu and add more chili paste.

Excellent recipe! I used extra-firm tofu and borrowed another reviewer's idea to drain it for several hours wrapped in folded paper towels, weighted down with a cutting board. Keep changing the towels as they get soggy. Then I wrapped the block of tofu in dry paper towels and put it in a plastic bag in the 'fridge overnight ... Perfect firmness the next day!

Never cooked with tofu before but this was amazing and we all loved it! Only thing I'd do differently is add more curry -- we like a bit more 'kick'.

I craved Thai food when I was pregnant, and now that I'm trying to lose the baby weight, it's on my no-no list...until I found this recipe!  I used green peppers instead of yellow (cheaper) and added baby corn (b/c I like baby corn). My only mistake was making this on a weeknight.  It took too long.  However, I'm definitely going to make this again (on a weekend).

This was a really good recipe but I did make a few changes that made it great! First, I drained/pressed the tofu for about 1/2 an hour and then stir-fried it in coconut oil to give it that extra coconut flavor. I also added about a tbsp of lemon zest. I think next time I'll pick up some lemongrass and really make this stand up to my favorite Thai restaurant. :D Like most folks here, I served it over rice.

Minus the chile paste, just because I didn't have any on hand, this was an excellent dish.  I did like another reviewer and sauteed my mushrooms with garlic and olive oil but stayed on track for the rest.  Really enjoyed it.  Thanks!

A wonderful recipe! Has become one of our staple dinners. We like to serve it with flour tortillas, to help cool the heat a little and because it was the closest we had to naan the first time we made the recipe.

Personally, I found the Bok Choy and Green Onion (green parts) to be a bit excessive.  Half that maybe.  Also, goes great with jasmine rice.  All in all, really really delicious though, and I don't even usually like some of the vegetables in it.

This recipe is AMAZING!
It's very simple to make.  The only thing I changed is preparing the tofu.  I froze the tofu overnight and the next day thawed over hot water and pressed the water out.  I then browned the tofu with oil before adding to the sauce.  It made the tofu much firmer.

I will definitely make this again!

I've made this a few times with the obligatory minor changes due to what's on hand and/or personal preferences.  I think it turns out pretty nicely. I definitely like to amp up the heat quotient a bit with more curry powder and chili paste. I also like to press the moisture out of the tofu before cubing it to keep it from falling apart.

Have made it twice now with two variations.  The first time I made it, it was WONDERFUL.  However, I only used one bunch of green onions, and didn't use any of the white parts.  I also didn't add the bok choy.  The only complaint I had was that it wasn't spicy enough - easily remedied by adding curry powder and chili paste.  

The second time, I followed it exactly as noted and didn't like it as much.  It turned out runny, and the bok choy and onion was overpowering.

My advice/modifications:  leave out the bok choy, go easy on the onions, fry the tofu a little bit in a separate pan before adding, and drop a little extra curry powder in there for some flavor.

should have had more direction for making, example type of tofu etc. I found that it was to salty and not enough coconut but I am going to play around with the idea of this recipe and make it into my own with some adjustments. ***add salt and soy slowly tasting along the way...

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars becuase it took SO long to make (washing, chopping and cooking veggies). I took the advice of other reviewers and sauted the veggies and tofu seperately. It was tasty, but as a few others said not a very strong coconut flavour. Also, couldn't find Chili Paste anywhere so I used Chili sauce? I had to add twice as much curry paste to give it a nice strong flavour. It was tasty but I don't think I'd make it again.

I love Thai food, and was looking forward to making this dish.  However, the dish did not have nearly the flavor of any Thai food I have had; it was definitely spicy (from the chile paste), but without any real flavor.  I do not plan to make this again.

YUMMY! If you are afraid to stir fry or make Thai food, then this is the recipe for you! So super easy to make and it comes out tasting super delicious! My local corner market didn't have bok choy so I substituted equal amounts of fresh broccoli and green beans and it came out phenomenal! I will make this again and again! My husband is not a vegetarian and didn't mind the tofu, but I could see this being good with chicken or pork or tempeh instead.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this as part of a vegetarian feast for my son and his friend, who are vegetarians, and my mom, my husband and myself, who are not. We all had seconds and thirds. At first my mother thought it was too spicy but that went away with the second taste. Excellent flavor. I made it ahead of time and heated it in the oven with the other dishes for a short time before serving.

I hoped it would be like the coconut red curry dish I had at a local thai restaurant. It lacked the creaminess and sweetness, but it was good anyways. Next time I will play around with sweetness and maybe add a little corn starch to thicken it up a bit. Also, adding some green beans and snow peas, and cutting down on the bok choy and tofu. It might be better to use soft tofu as well. I'll write another review when I try this out.

Yum! I will make this one again. I pressed some liquid out of the tofu by putting it in between 2 cutting boards with a water jug on top for 30 minutes (I got this idea from another commenter). I then coated the tofu with flour and fried it in 2 TBLS of sesame oil until it was crisp. I kept the tofu and other ingredients separate until the last minute so that the tofu wouldn't get too soft. I served it with rice and enjoyed it as much as some of the other Asian food I ate while living in Asia. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Delish. I recommend you to try. I don’t add all the chili paste. About 1/8 t.  My husband doesn’t like spice. I love spice, but, it bothers him when too spicy.

Delicious! This recipe is so easy to make. I made it with the veggies I have on hand , kale, carrots, celery, onions and it was still tasted good. I wind up adding pork meat. I sauteed the pork with the veggies and boil the coconut milk with the other ingredients in separate pot. Then i poured boiled coconut milk over sauteed veggies, meat & tofu and let it boil. My daughter really loved it. But i prefer fried tofu's texture. So next time I'll fry the tofu first.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I had to use up some chili peppers from the garden so added them as well.  Made it very, very spicy but extremely good.  I didn't add the sugar (personal preference).  Will make again.

Made this with spinach and curry paste instead of powder and skipped the chile sauce to make it milder for the kiddos. Served over rice it was very good. The sauce was thin, but could be easily remedied with a little flour, or boiling down for longer. I would recommend pressing your tofu, it lends to a better texture.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was DELICIOUS! I used fresh spinach instead of bok choy since it's what I had on hand. For the chili sauce I used one teaspoon of Siracha and one teaspoon of crunchy garlic chili oil from the asian store. So good! It had the right amount of kick and the mellow flavor of the coconut milk balanced it all out. Great healthy vegan dinner!

Love this! Good flavor, easy to make. Even my 4 year old, who is in a "spaghetti & watermelon only" phase, ate this, though she did tell me it was a little spicy (I'd cut down on, but not eliminated, the chili). And for the grown-ups in the family, it was a complex enough flavor that it satisfied :)

I made this but i dipped the tofu in egg, cornstarch, sugar and deep fried.  I only used 1 bunch of green onion, and chopped it all up fine.  Than used 2 heaping teaspoons curry powder instead.  Didn't bother dividing the soy sauce. A 1 heaping brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar, i like sugar.  Didn't have chili paste or tomatoes so i used 1/4 cup tomatoe sauce and 2 teaspoons hot sauce.  Don't add hot sauce if your curry is "hot" already, i added the hot sauce to my mild curry powder. Didn't have bok choy so i used mostly the white crunchy part of lettuce.  The leavy part you can save for salad, serve on side.  Didn't have yellow pepper.  Used a couple teaspoons of black pepper instead.  Didn't have mushrooms so i used red kidney beans instead.  Didn't add any basil.  Didn't use any salt.  It was extra saucy, first bite seemed spicy but it's so good and full of flavor so i served it over rice, soaked up the extra sauce.  NO LEFTOVERS.

This isn't the weirdest AR curry I've made - that honor goes to Keon's Slow Cooker Curry - but as I was putting it together, I still thought, "Seriously?" Coconut milk, yes; curry powder, yes; soy sauce, yes. Any two of the three, absolutely. All three together? Whoa, that's weird. The combination is a little different than anything I've had before - simultaneously both Indian-ish and Thai-ish, as you'd expect, but you know what? It's good. And really easy. And really good for you. I can definitely envision swapping the curry powder for Thai curry paste sometimes, but it's totally good as written. I had to play with the veggies a little; my pepper was mushy, and my store didn't have bok choy. I used half a bag of shredded red cabbage and some celery instead, which worked just fine. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night for my husband and I. He is a curry fanatic, he said it was a very good base for curry, he just wished that it was hotter. SO next time I will add 2 tablespoons of  chili paste. The only thing I did differently was I used regular coconut vs light. I don't do "lowfat" things, especially since you can take the can of regular coconut milk, take half of it, mix it with water... wahla!! Light! And you get more bang for your buck! This is a pretty great vegan recipe!

I also used extra firm tofu and sautéed it first in olive oil before proceeding with the recipe because I prefer my tofu somewhat crispy.  The only change I made was using a green pepper instead of yellow, which didn't make a difference.  The flavor was very good and I calculated a one cup portion to be about 82 calories, so it's a great low-cal meal.  On a personal preference note, I would have liked this to be less watery.  Also, the chile paste was very strong, so the ginger and basil flavors didn't come out.  I might recommend to either reduce the chile paste or eliminate the ginger/basil.

This was delicious enough for me to sign up with allrecipes just so I could review it!  I played with it some (added more spices, different veggies) and it turned out super tasty.  I baked my tofu beforehand to give it a better texture, used canned tomatoes & mushrooms, and added broccoli.  Fabulous!

I would add more curry and more chile paste. Also, I would half the tofu and add bamboo shoots. I loved the bok choy and the bell pepper. It was also good with jasmine rice.

One of the best things you can put in your mouth.
   
   I browned my tofu in a skillet before hand, used cabbage instead of bok choy. Chili paste can be a little hard to find so i used some tobascos, a cayenne, and a bannana pepper from my garden.  Perfect with Iced Tea.

This was awesome! Very flavorful and hearty for a vegetarian dish. I sort of cook by eye, so I may not have followed the recipe exactly, but it turned out great :). I did pre-cook the tofu, as I usually do, and I added unsweetened coconut to top it off. :)

Yummy curry, did use spinach instead of bok choy /would be probably very expensive to use that/, used canned mushrooms, and instead of coconut milk i used shredded coconut with milk. We had it with couscous.

It probably would be a five, but I had to cut back on the spice so the whole family could eat it.

Excellent!  Full of flavor and right amount of spice. We added more chilli paste to suit our tastes.  You can add other veggies as well. We didn't have bok Choy so I added a mix of spinach and baby arugula and it turned out wonderful!

delicious recipe.  I omitted the green onions as garnish because I don't like them and sprinkled some cilantro instead and it was fantastic

We did not like this recipe at all.  Very tasteless.  I even got the chili paste from our local Thai restaurant to make sure it was the right kind.  It was a waste of time and ingredients :(

Very, very tasty! We can't do spicy food too much, so I only used 1/4 tsp chili paste and it was just the right amount. We love going out for Indian food, but this recipe costs a LOT less than Indian restaurants - and it tasted just as good. I did add a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

Delicious!  I had some friends over for dinner and decided to try my luck with this recipe.  Tasted quite lovely despite being vegetarian!  I fried the tofu as another reviewer suggested, and I think that made a huge difference in taste.  Gave the tofu more texture and helped it hold its shape more.  I didn't add as much soy sauce as the recipe called for--I just added to taste.  Definitely making this again sometime when I feel like a good vegetarian meal! :)

This is a very flavorful dish.  I followed other suggestions and fried the tofu first.  i also decreased the amount of bok choy in half.  This will definitely be a repeat in our household.

This is amazing!  Very flavorful, a complex flavor.  I did not add the last tbsp of soy sauce as I thought the flavor was already salty enough.  The coconut milk is very rich and creamy but because the rest of the ingredients are so low fat its ends up being perfectly healthy AND delicious.  Served over brown rice.  Next time Ill add some eggplant, jalapeno and cilantro.

Added chicken, water chestnuts, baby corn and used dried basil.  I'm gluten free so I used San-J Tamari in lieu of soy sauce.  Served it over Thai Kitchen's boxed curry rice.  It was very flavorful and I got my Marine to eat tofu and lotsa veg!  He loved it!

I was excited to make this dish because I love thai food but I thought it was a little ordinary when I first made it. I agree with other reviewers that the leftovers the next day were much better. Although it added more calories, I sauteed the tofu in a bit of peanut oil on both sides until golden brown which really added to the flavor and texture of the dish. Will try again maybe with less ginger - only had powdered...sauce is a great base to experiment with. You can pretty much add any veggies or protein you would like.

Oh, man.  This is just what the doctor ordered, especially on a cold day!  Only change I made was to keep an extra can of coconut milk on hand, as there did not seem to be enough liquid.  If you aren't vegetarian, I'd also add a little fish sauce ("nam pla" is the proper term) for flavor.  If you're into a zippier curry, adding some Sriracha also does wonders.  (This recipe is very tasty as is, though.)

This recipe is so good, it's almost Thai restaurant quality! This was easy to make, and great for my budget! I like to add two cups of water to the recipe and make spicy Thai coconut soup for those cold days.

This was very tasty; my friend said it was the best thing I've ever made.  I skipped the mushrooms and dry-fried the tofu first to make it firmer.  Other than that, great recipe!

Delicious! Such a different flavor than the usual fair. The first time I made it was with the tofu and even my boyfriend loved it--he finished off the whole pan! However, it was just wonderful with chicken, too. Can't do much wrong here. :)

A wonderful dish!  Easy to make and quite tasty though next time I will spice it up a bit more.  I did as a few other reviewers suggested and added the tomatoes with the bok choy and basil and I also lightly sauted the tofu before adding the other ingredients to the pan.  Yummy!

This is actually 4.5 stars.  It is such a great curry.  The flavors go really well and taste very authentic.  I will probably use this as my base curry recipe from now on.  Thanks so much!

OMG what a fantastic meal! After eating this, my boyfriend said "Well I guess we can eat tofu once a week..." Can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow... only change I made was using spinach for the bok choy. Served over some jasmine rice, and it was perfect! No need to fry the tofu or anything... I don't know why everyone was complaining about it being mushy!

Very good! Did not use the tomatoes or bell pepper. Used green curry paste, snow peas and extra mushrooms. Also added chopped cilantro at the end. We thought it could stand to be a bit sweeter next time, though, and with less soy sauce.

This was great and SO easy!  The only thing I didn't have was the chili paste so I added a dash of some hot sauce.  Everything tasted great!  Next time tho, I would like more flavor, so will try getting some of the chili paste or adding more curry.  And since the bok choy is SO expensive, substitute cabbage or spinach!  Definitely a keeper!

Update 1/25/10 - made for the 2nd time, even better - I added 2 tbsp of curry, some red pepper flakes & water chestnuts.  Wonderful!

Excellent and simple.  The flavors mixed well with just enough spice to give it a true curry flavor.  We added potatoes to make the dish a little more filling.

This is a great recipe.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars because this recipe needs some tweaking for my palate.  My recommendations.  Pan fry the tofu first till the outside gets a little crispy.    Add minced garlic and chopped onions after the tofu has been pan fried.  I wanted a bit more spice so, I will double the chile paste next time.

I'm not very good at making curries, and I find a lot of curry recipes on here aren't that great.  This one is wonderful!  I messed up on the steps and it STILL turned out great.  Tasted amazing the next day!  Thanks!  I look forward to making it exactly next time!!!

Great recipe! Perfect amount of spice, flavor and heartiness.  My fiancee' is a vegetarian, and she and I sometimes struggle to find ways to enjoy meals together. This was the perfect answer.  We both love Thai foods, with me preferring more spice than her.  This was perfect for both. She does not enjoy mushrooms, so we substituted snow peas ('substitute'?!) for mushrooms and it turned out wonderfully. Used sriracha as the chili paste and everyone turned out happy!

Sooooo good. I did follow a lot of other reviewers advice and drained and fried up the tofu. I used a red curry paste and it was absolutely delicious!! My boyfriend was complaining the whole time I was cooking that he wanted chicken and then after he had a plate he went back for seconds!!!! I'm definitely looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow for lunch (surprisingly there is a serving left!!!)

I love this recipe!  I have substituted a variety of cooking greens for the bok choy and have liked those results just as well.  Delicious, flavorful dish!

Oh wow this was great! I also didnt have any chili sauce but used my thai chili-garlic sauce instead. Also, I didn't have any curry powder so I made the curry with spices my mom usually uses. I had about 1/2 tsp of turmeric, cumin powder, and a masala mix my mom had made which would mean that I also used a little garam masala as well (about a pinch). In addition I didn't have the majority of the veggies so I just sauteed my ginger, garlic and a little bit of onions (a few slivers) mixed it with the sauce, and then added fresh green bell peppers along with more slivers of a little bit of onion. This was great!

Absolutely delicious! I made this for my sister and me and we both loved it. We used the Sriracha chili sauce(with the rooster on it) and it was nice and spicy. The flavors were great and I loved the smell of it.  I used firm tofu and pressed it for 15 minutes, then fried it with some oil, curry powder, and ginger in a pan before I added it. It was still a little soft but it didn't fall apart at all.  I also added a whole vidalia onion and cut back just a little on the bok choy and green onion.  I'm definitely saving this recipe to make again.

Really great curry! Here's a tip for firmer tofu... I placed the block of tofu between two dish towels (not terrycloth) and pressed gently to get some of the excess moisture out. I cut the tofu into 1/2 inch thick blocks, then cut into triangles. I then heated a nonstick pan over md-low heat, and put in the tofu. I gently pressed the tofu so the rest of the water evaporated, and let it get golden brown, then flipped it and did the same thing. This takes a while, but you get a nice skin on the outside that won't allow the tofu to fall apart. I also thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch, as well as added some bamboo shoots that I had leftover from another recipe. The end result was healthy and great! The light coconut milk is much better for you than regular.

This was delish! Just like at my local thai place!  The only things I did differently were that I used chili powder instead of paste (only because I didn't have paste), I used chicken instead of tofu (we aren't big tofu fans), and I accidentally bought coconut juice instead of milk, so I mixed a can of juice with about 2 tbsp of regular milk and added 1 tsp of brown sugar to that mixture to give it the sweetness. With the other ingredients, you couldn't tell the difference! I also used a green pepper instead of a yellow because that was all I had, and it was still great and flavorful! I served this over brown rice, and it soaked up the juice and flavor perfectly! I will make this again! thanks!!

I didn't have all of the veggie ingredients for this curry and couldn't get to the grocery store, so had to sub some things - used a can of drained petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh, a can of spinach (squeezed dry) instead of the bok choy, and I just omitted the mushrooms.  Definitely would recommend pressing the excess moisture out of the tofu and frying it (in butter) before adding it to the sauce so that it develops a more meat-like texture and keeps its shape in the sauce. Served with basmati rice and fresh cilantro, this was delicious!

Fantastic! The flavors were as good as anything you find in a restaurant. I bought pre-cubed Extra Firm Nasoya tofu, drained it in the fridge overnight in paper towels and a strainer over a bowl. This made the tofu firmer and gave it a nice texture. I also substituted spinach for bok choy and it was fabulous. Will definitely make again!

This was really good! My husband and I really enjoyed the flavour combination.  I did make a couple of alterations to suit our taste by increasing the sugar to 2 tsp and the curry powder to 4 tsp and decreasing the chili paste to 1 tsp.  I also substituted cauliflower and spinach for the bok choy.  Also, I followed other reviewers suggestions and fried the tofu prior to putting it in the curry.  It was great!

This is delicious! I used ginger powder instead of fresh, a few shakes of red pepper flakes instead of chili paste, green pepper instead of yellow, and about 1 1/2 tbsp of dried basil instead of fresh - only because these are the things I had available at the time. I fried the tofu in a little oil, curry and red pepper flakes before adding. I added less bok choy. I also used regular coconut milk instead of light and the sauce came out nice and creamy.

This was ok. The flavor was nice andthe combination of veggies was excellent. I didn't fry the tofu quite long enough, so the texture was still pretty mushy. Will be getting extra firm tofu next time and really cook it well before hand. Also, this wasn't quite spicy enough for my tastes. I think it would be good to add some jalapeno peppers next time to heat things up. Overall, I think I'll make this again, with a few changes.

This turned out to be a great curry!  I did take the advice of others and I browned my tofu with soy sauce before adding it to the curry; this made the tofu amazing in it!  I forgot to pick up Bok Choy and used cabbage, which took longer to cook.  It tasted fine in it. IF you use cabbage, I would recommend cooking it first so  you dont overcook everything else.  I will definitely have to make this again with the Bok Choy.  Thanks for the recipe!

My boyfriend and I love this recipe, but we added more chili paste than called for (love that chili paste!). We were surprised that the coconut milk flavor virtually disappears, though we used the "lite" coconut milk, so maybe that had something to do with it. Since coconut milk is so high in fat, I think I would look for an alternative in the future. 

I pressed and then fried the tofu in peanut oil about an hour prior to beginning cooking. It tasted great, but I think I could go without frying, since the recipe includes so many crunchy vegetables. 

Also, this is not a thick dish, but it's awesome served over brown rice. It also reheats extremely well the next day (and a the next day!). The tofu really absorbs the flavor overnight.

I love (love, love, love) this recipe.  I make it for dinner every month or so, and it makes delicious leftovers for lunch the next day!  

I've never used fresh ginger in the coconut curry tofu.  I use about 1/2 a tsp of ground ginger instead of the 1 tsp of fresh ginger.  It works just fine!

Phenomenal!  It had great flavor and texture, plus it was healthy and hearty to boot.  We added a few extra veggies to the mix by including snap peas and zucchini, and I used cabbage instead of bok choy (but I scaled down the amount to allow for other veggies).  I also fried the tofu, but I added curry powder and soy sauce to the process to infuse extra flavor.  I served it over couscous, which balanced it nicely. Next time, I might get a little extra coconut milk because the broth did not go quite as far as I would like (but I tend to like a soupier curry). Definitely going to become a staple in our house! YUM!

This is an amazingly easy and yummy dish.  My husband loves to eat meat and whenever he is out of town I take the opportunity to eat some vegetarian meals.  This was one of those times and my mom came over.  We both thought this was one of the tastiest dishes we had ever had!!  This would also be great with a nice flaky fish or some shrimo we thought.

This was my first time making curry, but it turned out delicious! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and went a little heavier on the spices, less on the chili paste, and I added some corn meal to thicken up the sauce. I also added three minced cloves of garlic to the sauce, and I substituted cooked, cubed ckicken for the tofu. 

Definitely will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved it!  You can pretty much use any veggies you have on hand.
I feared that it was going to be a bit spicy for my little one so I just so I use half curry power and half garam masala. TASTY!

This recipe had a unique flavour and I liked it. I added some corn starch to the broth to make it a bit more thick, otherwise it is like a soup poured over rice. Also, the recipe calls for way too much bok choy. Half that is enough, or else it spoils the nice like coconut curry flavour. More tomatoes could also perk up the taste.

This was very, very good, but with the addition of a few extra ingredients, I think this could be excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly (though I did fry the tofu in canola oil before adding to the curry, and I also used more garlic, more mushrooms, and added some fresh green beans to the mix).  I think maybe it needs more chili paste than the recipe calls for, and maybe some fish sauce or something?  I'll definitely make it again and experiment with it, but it's a great base for a wonderfully healthy meal.

Very good! I am a huge curry fan so this was a must try for me. The only thing I changed was adding a bit of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up. Oh and I also added the tofu in the last few minutes of cooking to keep from getting mushy. Serve over calrose rice for a yummy treat!

Delicious served over rice. I try to use more liquid than food so my rice can soak up the juice. Really good!

This was amazing. I added twice the amount of curry powder and some garam masala. My 5 yr old even liked it.

Excellent. Without realizing it, this was almost an exact replication of a dish we love at our local Thai/fusion restaurant. It was very good. I ended up substituting spinach for bok choy. It was good, but I think you could also just leave it out and serve over rice, like our restaurant does.

I included everything in the recipe except the ginger because I hate ginger, and it did not live up to my expectations.  The bok choy was very bitter, so I ended up digging all of it out.  Most of the other veggies were fantastic though.  I added onions and potatoes.  I guess I was expecting a more authentic Thai dish, and this was not it.  I will not be making this again.

I love this stuff!!!!!  I didn't have chili paste in the house and called around until I found an Asian market and drove 45 minutes round trip to get some.  I'm like a lot of other people, though, in that you don't really need to follow the recipe in terms of the vegetables.  You could pretty much use whatever you want and/or have on hand--for instance, use spinach or cabbage instead of bok choy, throw in some green beans, let your imagination guide you.  Someone said that the person who submitted it didn't claim that it's an authentic Thai recipe so go crazy and be creative.  I was half-way through it, though, and I realized that I wanted more coconut milk so I added a whole other can.  Along with this, I adjusted the chili paste and curry powder by adding more.  This is a repeater for me.

This was outstanding! I did everything to the letter, then added a bit more soy, ginger, garlic, and coconut milk. I also subbed half the water in my rice for coconut milk to make coconut rice to go with it. It was a nice addition that made the meal very very good. Next time I'll try it with chicken.

I have been making this recipe for years and it is one of our favorites.  I use a bag of stir fry veggies to shorten the prep time. I also fry the tofu first.

Used green curry paste and thai ginger cause I just had it lying around. Different combination of vegetables , I used cabbage for bok choy cause didn't have any. I sauted the curry paste with ginger in a bit oil first before adding coconut milk and soya sauce. I increased the amount of coconut milk and soya sauce. Skipped the chili paste cause I used green curry paste. Good for a change combination of vegetables. Thanks.

this recipe was horrible. My daughter only took one bite as well.  It may be that we simply do not like this type of flavoring.  The tofu seemed slimy, even though I squished it for over a half an hour to drain it thoroughly.  I won't be making this again.

This recipe was fantastic!  I savored every delicious bite; I had to sub regular cabbage for the bok choy, but it worked just fine.  I was skeptical of the tomato flavor in the coconut curry base I adore, but the taste blended beautifully.  It is too bad I am the only one in my house who will eat this exciting dish (or is it???  more for me!!!)

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! I don't order curry at restaurants because they usually add too much curry spice. But this recipe strikes the perfect balance. It was also easy to make with minimal cleanup. This is now my favorite meal, my husband liked it too!

This is simply delicious.  The coconut flavor is mild, and the chile paste gives it a nice kick.  I didn't use any salt, and I only used three tablespoons of the soy sauce.

My husband loved this dish. I found it a bit bland and watery. I couldn't taste the curry, coconut or ginger. But I will definitely make it again -- next time I'll press the excess liquid out of the tofu first and add more curry and ginger. I might put not so much chili paste in though. I think it will become a favourite because you could substitute cooked chicken for the tofu if you wanted. Thanks for the recipe!

Definately NOT bland.  I used red curry paste-- I think that was the strongest ingredient.

Fantastic and simple.  I made 2 changes.  Instead of Boc Chow, I used brocolli crowns, and instead of hot pepper paste, I useed hot peper sauce and added some Gran Marnie.

This recipe is the reason i saved this site as a favorite.  It is so so wonderful and makes you look like a gourmet chef.  I am not vegetarian and i love it.  If i feel like making it a meat dish i put just add chicken instead of tofu.  the tofu still is just as awesome. ONE OF THE BEST RECIPES ON THIS SITE!

It was a little bland for me (I like my curry spicy and strongly flavored), but my husband went crazy for it.  He says it is "fabulous."  I'm just pleased I found a vegetarian recipe that he'll eat without complaining. :)

this was very good. i followed the advice of one reviewer by thawing the tofu w/ hot water, then draining it. next i fried it for about 5 minutes in sesame oil. the rest of the recipe i followed pretty much step by step. the only thing i would do different next time is add the mushrooms a little bit later so they are more crunchy. also i would probably add more curry powder and more ginger. also dont forget to add a little salt! otherwise, this is an awesome recipe, will definately make again.

The recipe was good, I used a onion instead of Green Onions because I got confused on what Green Onions were because they have different names for them in the uk, the normal onion worked fine.  I've found in the past that Pak Cho tastes bitter, so I used Spinach instead.  And I couldn't get Chilli Paste so I used a Chilli Sauce which made it a little too hot (I tasted it and the words which came out my month inbetween gasping for breath was 'oh my god') so be careful with the chilli sauce!  I fried out the tofu first - watch out because that stuff spits!  I thought it had plenty of flavour, filled me up quickly, its good for slimmers (if they don't fry the tofu), extremely easy and quick to do.

This is so yummy!  My husband loves it.  I make it up ahead of time, without the cooking, keep it in the fridge and just throw it all into the pan at once for a super easy dinner after a long day.  I also use chili oil rather than chili paste(It doesn't really matter, both are good).

Smelled delicious while making this dish!  I added a lot more extra Thai chili paste that I had on hand to liven it up a litle bit more...still don't think it was enough.  Used 2 tomatoes instead of 4, and baby bok choy instead of the regular size.

Love this curry! Was quite easy, though chopping up all those vegetables was tedious. Used 3 bunches green onions instead of 2, but next time will use 4 (we like onions). Real heavy coconut milk mixed with 1/2 cup water (more sauce), but suppose light is more health-conscious. Also used curry paste (~3 tbsp) and Chinese garlic chilli paste (Lee Kum Kee). Since we like our meat, used 4 pork chops, cubed, in the place of the tofu. Only had half a tomato, will try 2 tomatoes next time. Baby bok choy (more tender than the full grown stuff) and we were ready to go (eat)!

We like a lot of flavour in our food, so I used 3 tsp of curry, omited the sugar and substituted 3/4 cup of peas for the 4 cups of bok choi.

Very good!Very tasty!Next time I think I will add a couple Tbs cornstarch,as it was pretty liquidy.My husband liked it this way though.He said I should serve it with less rice and with a spoon next time.This will definitely be a regular!

Yum! A very good recipe overall. I only made a few changes, added zucchini & baby corn, eliminated tomatoes, salt and reduced the amount of soy sauce.

Mine turned out a little thin and I had to add some cornstarch.  Also, I didn't pay attention to the order in which I was supposed to add all the vegetables.  I just dumped them all in there.  Great taste though!

My husband is vegetarian and loved this recipe.The only variation I made is to fry the tofu before adding it to the sauce.It was quick and delicious.

I made this dish last night and my family loved it !!!  The dinner table was so quiet, there was so much chewing. I knew my husbad and myself would love it, but my 20 month old daughter said " Umm, Delicious!!! The sauce is great and it is just spicy enough. After everything is chopped, it's easy.

This had a really good flavor. It was too spicy for me and my son - and I only added 1/2 the amount of chili paste - but my husband thought it was just right.

Was good. Also, since our grocery store is lame, they did not have Bok Choy, so I used asparagus instead. I would like to add that I really did not feel the recipie instructions were very detailed so I just slapped everyting together and it turned out good. The spiciness was just right. But if you like it really spicy add another scoop of chili paste.

I made this recipe once and followed the instructions to the T. I did add bamboo shoots though. This recipe is flavorful and the lite coconut milk makes it lower in fat, however, the sauce is really watery. If I made it again I would definitely want to add something to thicken the sauce, whether that is full fat coconut milk, arrowroot powder, flour or something else entirety, I’m not sure, as I haven’t experimented with this recipe yet. I would also add minced garlic.

I love the delicate coconut sweetness in contrast with the heat from the Chile paste.  I made one adjustment,  I omitted the tomatoes.  In my opinion,  tomatoes would taken this Thai infused dish into another direction.   I can't wait to share this with my friends.  I will make this again

The first time I made it I followed the directions and I liked the way it came out.  The second time I only had chicken and no tomatoes.  I added 2 tsp. of fish sauce and about 2 tsp. of chili paste also.  And I added soy sauce to taste but not as much as was called for. My kids really liked the taste.

The recipe turned out a bit bland so I had to add more salt and doubled the amount of curry paste and brown sugar.  Was pretty good after that.  Don't expect a creamy consistency, too many veggies and tofu water down the broth.  Overall a pretty healthy meal.  I prefer a creamier curry personally.

We gotta tired of trying to figure out what meat to eat and adding tofu was something we liked with korean food so we thought we would try this... Flavors did not disappoint. We were nervous because we have never cooked with tofu before but found this to be excellent...

I just made this recipe and it tastes amazing coming off heat, I’m sure it’ll be even more so once it has sat in the fridge for awhile. As others have described, I squeezed out the water in the tofu overnight using paper towels, 2 plates, and another container on top. I then baked the tofu in oven using an oiled aluminum foil lined baking pan on 400F for 20 minutes, flipped, then another 15 minutes, which made them nice and crispy. I made several substitutions and revisions to the recipes, the main changes were: 1) I cooked the onions first, added 3 cloves of minced garlic, then the rest of the veggies, then the liquid, in order to bring out the aromatic flavors better; 2) I used spinach instead of bok choi; 3) for the chili sauce I used Sriracha sauce, and added 2 diced Anaheim chili peppers for even more of a kick; 4) I used 1T total of salt; 5) I used full fat coconut milk from Thai Kitchen brand; 6) I doubled everything. Cheers!

Outstanding.  No leftovers. I served over basmati rice made in rice cooker with a Not Chick’n cube.   I left out bok choy but plan to add either green beans or spinach the next time. Also will try some of the reviewers methods for drying/firming tofu.

Easy, healthy, and delicious. I usually find tofu to be a terrible addition to any recipe, but this wasn't too bad at all. Also the non-tofu parts were awesome.

Very good, and yes, it's spicy - which I love. Only tweaks I made were: I used Lite Coconut Milk, and spinach instead of cabbage. I also removed about 1/8c. of the hot broth, dissolved a Tablespoon of corn starch in it, then re-added it to the sauce, to thicken. I like to do this often in many dishes I make.  Gives a slight silky texture. Used another reviewer's tip and pressed the tofu, then sliced it and popped it in the oven (170)  for about 25 minutes. Was nice and meaty when done. I made wild rice with this dish but clearly jasmine rice would have been better.

What I love about this recipe is that its so adaptable! Made several substitutions, using what I had on hand. But as long as you have the tofu, coconut milk, and some spices and veggies, you can make it work. If my husband will eat tofu and ask for seconds, it must be good!

I was a little nervous about the spiciness of this recipe, but OMG it was delicious. I'm not big on spicy foods and although it definitely cleared the nasal passageways, it was hardly spicy. (Could have been the type of chili paste I used - Idk). 

This was my first time cooking with a lot of these ingredients. I followed everything basically to a T, but I did use green pepper instead and the store didn't have fresh ginger so I bought a paste as a substitute. No basil either. I, also, browned my tofu in olive oil over high heat before adding it to the mix and then I served it over brown jasmine rice. SOOOOOOO YUMMY! 

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I will continue to make it again and again and again and again....

I made it my own way. I added garlic, ginger, and dried red chilies. I sautéed that with the mushrooms then added the curry, sautéing for a few more minutes.  I then added the coconut milk and brought it to a boil. I added some frozen broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots and cooked for 10 minutes.  I then added bok choy and kale and cooked for 5 more mins. Delicious. You can use whatever vegetables you want as it does not have to be the exact ones as stated in the recipe. Drain the tofu, wrap in paper towel, and put a weight on it for one or more hours. Brown the tofu using a bit of cooking spray or coat the pan with olive oil (it's healthier than frying) Tofu done using this method tastes better in any vegetarian dish as the texture is better.

I made this with smoked tofu.  Yummm. It's a bit runny, so seems best served over rice.

It was good but not spicy enough for my taste.  I would add a bit of fresh red chile to give it some kick.

This meal has lots of great flavor! I've cooked it several times and used chicken and tofu, both were great. It is also fantastic as seconds for another day. Although, it's so good if I plan to have left overs than I need to double the recipe because I tend to pick out the first time.

I'm not a big fan of tofu but my son has decided to go vegetarian so I gave  this a try. We both really liked it and the tofu was actually a nice change from meat, and a LOT cheaper. Bonus! Thanks for the recipe, will make again for sure.

Excellent! I have been looking for any recipe made with tofu, that tastes really good. This is a keeper. I followed it. I worried about the sauce being enough, so I cooked it with the lid on the pot. There was plenty of sauce. I can't wait to try it tomorrow for lunch.

The first time through a recipe I stick to the text. This one was easy, and it did not disappoint: layers of exotic flavors!  I know we will continue to use this one, but I can easily see adding pineapple chunks into the mix! I served it over jasmine rice, and will try it over brown or brown jasmine for better nutrition.

I've made this recipe many times, and my family loves it.  It isn't a 'hot' spicy dish as is, but very flavorful.  With and without rice, tomatoes, ginger, basil-I've gotten many compliments.  The hardest part about making this is the food prep.

This was tasty! Didn't have the bok choy, so we added extra pepper; added tomatoes later so they wouldn't cook down so much; added a tsp of corn starch dissolved in cold water at the end to thicken the sauce; no chili paste, so we used a tsp of chili sauce; and sliced the tofu in 1/2"x 3/4"x 3/4" pieces (we prefer tofu with more seasoned surface area). Nice and saucy... Served it over rice. Ate the very little bit of leftover in a wrap with a few tablespoons of guacamole for lunch today... Odd combo, but delicious! ??

This is uh-mazing! The flavors are spot on and rich and truly satisfying - no anemic blandness here. I used spinach instead of bok choy because that's what I had on hand, as well as tossing in some cauliflower for some added crunch. A definite keeper, especially served over roasted cauliflower rice. I may just go vegetarian if I can find more recipes like this!

I love this!   I didn't make many changes at all, it's delicious and bursts with flavor.  Great over steamed rice.  I will definitely make this a part of my rotation!  The only thing is, I didn't have chili paste so I was concerned but it still turned out great without it. I don't have a lot of time to cook so I just threw all the veggies in my processor.  :)

I made this exactly to recipe, except that I only had one bunch of green onions. I thought that the flavor was pretty good, but I agree with the other reviewers that browning the tofu would help. I also think that I might sub some of the soy sauce for fish sauce next time, as I think it would give the dish a more complex flavor. Using plain curry powder, I thought the flavor profile was a little flat. Yes, lots of flavor, but it didn't seem well rounded to me. Perhaps using a Thai curry paste might also bring in some different tones. However, I went back for seconds, so it's definitely a recipe I want to work with again.

I wrapped the tofu in paper towels and sqeezed dry under cutting board for about 15 minutes, then baked my tofu pieces on each side at 400 degrees, until I reached the firmness I wanted. When all was said and done, I found that the sauce was bland. In a pinch, I grabbed the good ol' ketchup bottle and gave it a good squeeze, probably at least 2 tablespoons, mixed and found what I was looking for. Good base recipe to evolve  your personal tweaking.

I thought this was an easy curry to make, as it was my first curry recipe I have tried!  I loved the bok choy in it, as well as the fresh basil.  I found it did not have as much "coconut milk" taste as I like and being a spice wimp I actually would make it a bit spicier!

Very tasty!  I would use less peppers next time, but it's just a personal preference.  The sauce was the best part of the dish and I will be doubling next time.

I really don't understand how, but this recipe came out very bland.  I didn't make any changes other than searing the tofu and was very surprised at how little it tasted like...well, anything.  I guess that is not exactly true, each bite tasted enough like Thai curry at the start to get me excited, then *poof*, flavorless.  I'll try one more time, maybe with more curry powder and chili paste.

Very good and healthy!  Made w/o chili paste as I did not have it on hand nor could I find it in local grocery stores.  Curious to see what it would have tasted w/ it.  Used dry basil instead of fresh...used a little less than 1 TBS, would have like it better w/ about 1 TSP, probably.  Will make again! :)

Very good, particularly as a starting place. I've made it a few times and I put it whatever veggies I feel like eating! First time I accidentally bought "coconut creme" which had tons of added sugar, but the hubs liked it this way a lot. I had to add extra curry powder to compensate. Tip - dry roast the curry powder a little (until fragrant) before adding other ingredients, it helps pull out the taste. I agree with others that this is better after a night in the fridge!

This is a great quick and healthy weeknight dinner.  Next time I would half the recipe because it makes SOOO much. Also, I over cooked it a little so the vegetables were not as crisp which probably would have made it better.  Also, next time I won't add the tomatoes until the end, at the same time as the bok choy.  I added a can of bamboo shoots with the water drained and they added a nice variation of texture to it.

In my desperate attempt to get my family to eat healthier, I think I may have pinged onto something that worked.  Everyone (except my 6 year old) really liked this.  I made it exactly as written and was enjoyed by all (except the 6 year old that kept saying the tofu "felt" like cheese).  Really good.

This was soooo good, I made a few changes becuase of what I had in the refrigerator.-no bok choy or spinach , I used some broccoli stems and turnip greens. I served it over basmati rice and it was a huge hit! My husband, a vegetarian for over 20 years said it was one of the best veggie friendly dinners he's ever had!

This is my first attempt at making a curry dish, and it turned out great!  I fried the tofu as suggested by others and also added some spicy red curry paste.  Great Recipe! Thank You !

WOW!  This tasted like something I'd order in a restaurant!  It was fantastic.    I couldn't find chili paste where I live so I used a combo of chili powder and red pepper flakes.  I just adjusted for heat I wanted.

This seemed really bland to us.  I followed the recipe almost exactly as written (no bok choy 'cause it looked pretty sad at the grocery store).  I added some corn starch to thicken the sauce.  And when it was just too bland for my taste I added a handful of craisons- that made it good to eat- a nice contrast of sweet and a little spice.  I'd make it again with the craisons, but not as written.

Great tofu recipe!  Only changed one thing, i used frsh spinach instead of bok choy since the bok choy didn't look fresh.  Even people who were skeptical of tofu liked this.

Made this recipe exactly as written and it was great. I didn't feel like making rice so it was enjoyed by itself and it had just the right mix of spicy (curry) and cool (coconut milk). Very Nice.

I LOVE thai food and I must say this is probably the best home-made coconut curry tofu recipe I have tried/tasted! It was a huge hit in the family and my friends loved it as well. It's absolutely key to not overcook the bok choy, as its crunchiness adds that extra "yum" factor to the dish :D

Sauteed the tofu after draining it for a bit, it was really good, really tasty.  The 2 tsp of chili paste is pretty hot, so beware if feeding the little ones

Browned the tofu cubes in oil for abt 30 min turning every so often. Drained on paper towels. Sliced two boneless chicken breasts and added to oil and sauteed for abt five min. I expaned the receipe to six and added more red cuury paste than called for. My wife loved it but I could have used even more red curry paste! I'll do this again.

Guys, this is quite possibly the most delicious way I've ever eaten tofu. Be really careful that your chili paste isn't too powerful. I cut the chili in half. Also, make sure that you don't overcook the Bok Choi. Fan-freaking-tastic recipe! Thanks so much!

Great recipe! This was my third attempt at Indian food and my most successful and flavorful of all. The mushrooms, tofu and bok choy taste awesome altogether, although I expected the coconut milk to be more present in the recipe. maybe I burned off too much of the water in the milk. Either way, I will DEFINITELY make this again...

I've been looking for a curry recipe that would duplicate the expensive dishes in Thai restaurants, and this is awesome!  I prepared everything as stated for the actual curry sauce, but I used dried chives instead of green onions just because I had those on hand instead.  It's the sauce that makes a curry recipe, regardless of the veggies you use.  Those are merely a vessel to get the sauce to your mouth.  :)  Of all the veggies listed, someone in my house doesn't like one of them, so I just added cubed potatoes (boiled fork-tender first) and pad thai noodles (again, already cooked) to the sauce, refrigerated overnight and served for dinner the next day (leftover curry's always best!).  That gave the flavors a chance to blend and absorb into the noodles/potatoes and--WOW!  What a hit I had on my hands!!  My family wants this on a regular rotation!

This was good, but I think using regular coconut milk and regular soy sauce would make it so much better! I'm used to the curry at my favorite Thai restaurant being so much more flavorful and creamy with the coconut.

I loved this recipe! It is the first time I made a curry and thought it was as good as at the Thai restaurant. I used Thai red curry paste as my curry and I increased it a bit. I also, cut back on the amount of veggies so there would be more sauce. I also added a bit of corn starch to the sauce to make it thicker. It was wonderful! I will certainly make this again and experiment with different veggies and quantities. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have to say, this is one of the best things I've ever done with tofu!  I'm eating it right now actually.... I substituted bok choy for spinach and it's great!  (I'm not a bok choy fan).   It makes white rice actually have flavor!

I have used this recipe for a few years and every time it turns out perfect - I do change a few things though. I follow the recipe for the base (coconut milk, brown sugar, ginger, curry, red chile paste, soy sauce) and tweak to taste. then I add cubed potatoes, broccoli, carrots, green onions, peppers and anything I have on hand. I only cook till the veggies are tender crisp and serve over basmati rice with lime slices. it's wonderfully flavorful - sweet and spicy!

I loved this dish!  This is the first time that I've attempted a tofu dish, and even my husband (the meat-eater) thought that it was great.  I had no chili paste, so took the advise of several of the reviews and used red pepper flakes; I also froze the tofu and braised it in soy sauce before adding it to the dish.  This is definitely five-star.

What a relief! This recipe was SO much better than another curry tofu recipe I found on this site and tried last night. I loved the bok choy and the sauce was a nice flavor. I didn't have fresh ginger or chili paste so I used ginger and chili powders instead. I think I may have forgotten a few other ingredients, but it still came out great!

AMAZING recipe, appealed to everyone (even those who prefer meals with meat). I made this for a soup event at school for about 30 people, and it was a huge hit. It has a nice sweet taste from the coconut milk with a spicy aftertaste from the curry and chili powder.

Yum, even though I didn't have everything and needed to make modifications, it was still yummy. I used dry basil and ginger powder, added toasted coconut and cashews, and used green onion, carrot and green pepper. This is a forgiving recipe, as long as the basics are there it seems easy to modify successfully.

I only made the coconut gravy (for my bean patties) and it was delicious!  It would be great with a little fresh cilantro sprinkled on top!

Wow! Delicious flavour - very authentic!  Instead of tofu, I used chicken and made sure to add a bit of cornstarch to help thicken it up as many were saying it was a bit watery.  Also, I fried up my veggies first, then the chicken, then added the sweet chili sauce and continued frying for a minute or so more and then added the coconut milk, etc. mixture.  Anyways, great recipe will definitely use again!

Great recipe! I kicked it up a notch by deep frying the tofu cubes. I also substituted bok choy and yellow bell pepper for eggplants and baby corns. I also added a little cornstarch to thicken the curry sauce. My guests cleaned up the pot and asked for the recipe at the end of dinner.

Excellent base recipe, but made a few changes...

1. I drained the water from the tofu by squeezing it, broiled it in the oven for 20 minutes, and fried it in oil for 7 minutes.

2. I thought that there was not enough liquid for all the veggies so I added about a cup of light cream

3. I also added avacado, zucchini, and subbed bamboo for the bok choy

Excellent recipe! I did tweak it a bit. I didn't use bok choy because there wasn't any available. Also, I added pineapple and zucchini as well as summer squash, and used grape tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes. Oh! I also fried the tofu first and then added it in during the last 5 minutes.

I like to try different things, but this is not good at all. I suppose it was easy to make, but it was not tasty in the least. I pretty much hated this dish, so did my husband. Next weeks list will be good ol' American food once again.

This recipe is awesome!!! Tastes great, very colorful, and easy to make! If you're slow with a knife, like I am, it definitely takes longer than 25 minutes to prep, but it's worth it! 

As with any recipe, adjust ingredients to your taste buds. I like basil a lot, so I used about 1/2 cup coarsely chopped basil. Also, remember that all curry is not created equal. You may have to adjust spices based on the potency and flavor of your curry. That being said, I added a little more brown sugar than called for after tasting the sauce before adding any other ingredients. I also used baby bok choy and a Hunan Red Chili Sauce instead of a paste because that's what I had on hand.

The one complaint I have about this dish is that the coconut flavor is a little weak. I will probably add a little fresh grated coconut next time.

This was pretty good - didn't have a few of the veggies so I substituted with what I did have and it turned out well.  I think next time I would add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce, a bit too liquidy for my liking but the flavor was good and it was easy and pretty quick.

A curry is only as good as the base you use to make it.  I have several different kinds of chili sauces and currys.  I used a medium red curry seasoning from a jar instead of a powdered curry seasoning.  If I had made it with substandard ingredients it would not have been nearly as good.  But, with the good fresh ingredients I used it was YUM-EE!

EXCELLENT dish!  I would give 7 stars, if I could.  Only thing I changed was added cumin.  I also added more bok choy and mushrooms.  It was SO good.  Our whole family loved it!  Thank you.

We thought this was a good curry recipe! It reminded me of thai curries since it was more liquidy like they are. We served it over brown rice. We changed the veggies a bit to use what we had on hand (peas, spinach, bok choy, onion, yellow pepper) with tofu but it tasted good. I thought it had a lot of flavor and I used the same seasonings as in the recipe. Our hot paste was sambal which adds quite a bit of heat and we only used 1 tsp so maybe that helped it a bit. OVerall, we enjoyed it. My husband did not want it again however because he does not like watery things.

I thought this was very good, but could be improved upon. I would like more coconut flavor, which would probably come from using regular (not lite) coconut milk. I didn't have chili paste (what is it????) so left it out, and thought the flavor was a bit bland. Upon reheating, I added raisins and it was much tastier!

This was really good! It was easy to make, but slightly time-consuming chopping all the vegetables. I pretty much followed the recipe, although I stir-fried the mushrooms and tofu together in some stir fry oil before adding them to the sauce. I hoped this would avoid the tofu falling apart like others said it did, but it still crumbled slightly when stirring the sauce. No matter, though- it was delicious and very filling. TONS of vegetables! We served this over white basmati rice. Thanks!

Sinced I deleted a few ingredients (didn't have green onions/basil) I base review not on taste (though it was good) but on very thin sauce- I even boiled down for extra time and was still watery.

I really like this recipe, but modified it a fair amount.  Didn't have any curry powder so used 1 tsp garlic, ½ tsp coriander and ½ tsp cumin.  Left out the  tomatoes.  Used frozen cut green beans instead of the bok choy.  Came out great.

When I read thru the ingredient list then the  reviews I couldn't believe anyone would find this bland but I have to agree.  Perhaps it was my curry powder that was too mild?  My jar of chili paste said hot but it wasn't for me. It's a great base recipe thou.  I put the coconut milk and spices plus white onion parts in the saute pan and heated then turned it off to let the flavors blend for a little over an hour.  When  I tasted I knew it needed more as once the veggies were in the flavors would fade even more.  I held back the soy sauce at the end and gave a few good splashes of fish sauce. Added 4 heaping teaspoons of Sambol, 1 teaspoon Sircaha, an extra teaspoon chili paste and because it was in front of me on the counter, a  teaspoon of smoked paprika and 2 teaspoons minced garlic.  I was low on bok choy so added in fresh spinach and had some sprouts to add as well. Served over brown rice. With the additions I really enjoyed it and would make it again, will try new/different curry and chili paste this time.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe.  I cut the tofu into cubes and stuck them in the freezer for about an hour.  I used canned mushrooms, canned tomatoes, frozen pepper strips, green cabbage and no basil.  It was easy and delicious!

This was my first thai recipe that I ever tried and it turned out excellent. I also used green beans with other vegetables in the recipe. I stir fried firm tofu separately and then added to the curry, this way tofu didn't separate. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This recipe was really good although my curry didn't look as pretty as the picture.  I would also have to suggest draining the tofu and browning it before use (I let sit out only cause I was preparing other things but I don't think it made a huge difference).  It was a bit to spicey so I will cut the chili paste in half next time.  It was also super easy!

It was good, but I didn't think the flavor was strong enough.  But that could be because it was tofu, as opposed to meat.  (This was the first time I've had tofu curry.)

I don't like cooked tomatoes, so I substituted in yellow onion.  I also substituted the garlic for the ginger.  That all worked out.

I will definitely make it again.  Next time, I'll probably try it with more coconut milk, more curry powder, and more chili sauce.

Awesome!!! My boyfriend and I had this last night and we absolutly LOVED it!! I followed the recipe almost exactly as is. The only difference was that I roasted some garlic in olive oil and sauteed the tofu in the flavored olive oil before adding it to the sauce/veggie mix. I will definately be making this again... soon! Thanks for such a great- healthy recipe!!!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. To match my own personal tastes, I used cabbage instead of bok choy, omitted the brown sugar, and used garlic in place of ginger. The tofu turned out a little too soft, despite the fact that I sauteed the tofu in advance. Next time I will probably cook the tofu separately, because I like my tofu really crispy.

This is my boyfriend's FAVORITE recipe- he really likes his food spicy though, so the amount of chile paste called for may be too much for some. Wonderfully colorful, and great as leftovers if you can resist the temptation for seconds and thirds!

One of the best meals I've had in ages!!
I didnt have the chili paste, so i just added a little cyan pepper for some heat.
I also had not peppers, and didnt add mushrooms, because im not a big fan.
But it was wonderfull still! even if I had added mushrooms it would have been delicious.
great recipe!!

I realized halfway through making this dish that I had Indian curry paste, not chile paste, so I used the curry paste, curry powder, and chili powder since I had no idea what I was doing anyway.  I left out the bok choy and served it over basmati rice, and it tasted like really good Indian food.  I don't think it was supposed to come out this way, but it was really good.

This dish was ok – kinda spicy but not flavourful.  My partner and I enjoy Thai food regularly but I had to coerce him into eating the leftovers.  The 3/5 stars likely reflects my love of tofu (which I pan fried before adding to the dish) and the assortment of vegetables.  Otherwise the rating would have been lower.  We also both found that this recipe had way too much green onion garnish!  I think this recipe has potential but currently has the wrong combination of spices... I may tinker with it a bit or throw it out completely (not sure yet - still recovering).

Amazing recipe. Made this yday for a group of 15 among which atleast 8 were vegetarians. Not only did they like it but even the non vegetarians were all over this dish. Served it with just plain rice and whole wheat pita. I did want more sauce so added little bit of water when cooking the dish and also had to simmer the dish for more than 5 mins since I had to increase the quantity of the vegetables and I wanted the mushrooms to cook a little longer. Thankyou for this wonderful recipe :-)

Fabulous, I have been looking for something just like this since we moved out of the city and had a baby.  My only change would be to use less bok choy (or make sure it is very fresh) - mine wasn't, which produced a bitter flavor.

I agree with those who said this had no real flavor. It was spicy, but bland. I the curry I get at a local Thai place is flavorful and complex. This was not.

This was so good!  It had plenty of flavor.  I used dried basil but other than that I made it exactly as written.  I think next time I will add fresh basil instead.  Oh, and don't forget to drain your tofu well first!

I added a little honey to make it a sweet spicy instead of just spicy.  I think I might try adding some corn starch next time too, so the sauce will be a little thicker.

My boyfriend enjoyed this one more than I did.  The only substitutions I made were: slighty less soy sauce (and it was still pretty salty), and compressed, spiced tofu rather than "firm".  Compressed tofu is drier and has the texture of real meat.  It was a nice dinner, I just thought it was lacking something.

I was disappointed with this recipe. It was bland, and the important flavors (coconut, ginger) were missing. The tomatoes and peppers gave it almost a mexican feel to me. I wouldn't make it again.

This was missing something, I agree with a lot of the other reviewers.  It def. had a kick (from the chilly paste) but didn't have that "curry taste" I enjoy so much when going out to Thai restaurants.

Outstanding recipe.  Easy with great coconut flavor.  This will go into the rotation.

Coming from a Thai food fanatic....this was incredible!  I took the other reviewers suggestions about cooking the tofu and veggies separate from the sauce at first.  The sauce would be awesome with any veggie combination, or shrimp, etc.  The only thing missing was the chopstix.

This was a really disappointing recipe. Like some other reviewers I was expecting something that was rich in flavor and would smell heavenly. I followed the recipe exactly as posted and found that it was an odd lookng dish with almost no smell. Worst of all it was almost completely tasteless.

Great dish!  2 bunches of green onions is A LOT of garnish (the 2" green tops). Next time I do this, I'm going to use 1/2 the onions, and substitute some yellow or white onion for the cooked portion.  Also, I thought this recipe was a little bland.  Next time I cook it I'm going to sautee some of the veggies in a little oil first, to bring out some more flavor.  Bottom line is that I AM going to cook this again, many times!

I thought this was ok.  I agree with the other reviewers that the smell was much better than the taste.  I didn't find it offensive, and the soy protein it provides is really good for you, so I will probably make it again...just not with the same level of anticipation I had this time.

This was incredibly rich and good. I substituted cabbage for bok choy and omitted the garlic and peppers. It was still quite good, especially over rice.

Sorry, I didn't like this recipe at all.  I was expecting the flavorful coconut curry that I get at restaurants, but it didn't smell, look, or taste anything like those.

My family loved this recipe and didn't find it bland at all.  I followed the recipe almost exactly- I used Dynasty Brand Thai Garlic chili paste and White Wave Baked Tofu, Thai flavor.  The White Wave Baked Tofu comes in a variety of flavors and my four kids will eat it hot or cold, right out of the package, because it doesn't have that mushy, tofu texture.  The big change I inadvertently made was to print out the recipe on two pages and not see the "bok choy" on the second page.  I used fresh broccoli instead and my husband and kids all seemed happy that I made that mistake (I love bokchoy, but in deference to them I will continue to use broccoli).  With fresh, high quality ingredients (I also make my own curry powder), this is a fantastic recipe!

I couldnt agree more with the reviewer who described this as tasting like "nothing, literally nothing."  I even doubled the spices as suggested.  The dish looked lovely and smelled flavorful, but that was quite a facade.  We didnt bother even trying to eat it after the first few bland bites.  I'd give it 0 stars if I could...

We must've done something wrong, because I thought it was a little bland as well.  Every once in a while we'd get a bite that you could pick up the different tastes in, but overall - I wasn't thrilled.  I guess I expected it to be sweeter or have more curry flavor.  Followed the instructions to the letter.  Not bad, but not my favorite - my husband liked it though!

An awesome recipe that makes for plenty of yummy leftovers. The prep time on the recipe is wrong or I'm just really slow.  But it takes me more than 25 minutes to wash and chop all the ingredients.  Make sure you have a deep pan or wok for this recipe.  Highly recommended.

Very good! In fact, I will be making this at my friend's birthday next week!

I didn't have any chile paste, so I used chili flakes instead.  Also, I could't find bok choy, so I used savoy cabbage.  Next time I will use bok choy.  Thank you very much for this recipe!

Ok, I'm reallly confused...I tried this and it tasted like nothing, literally nothing.  It smelled and looked delicious while cooking, but came out with NO flavor whatsoever....I read where a couple other people said it was bland, but everyone else seemed to have enjoyed it, so what am I missing???  The leftovers, though, tasted like a low/no-fat brand chinese t.v. dinner (not much improvement).

It was a great quick meal. I would use less tomatoes and more chile. But overall the taste was amazing.

I made this last night and must warn anyone who may try this recipe.  It is sooooo bland!!! Tasteless!! It smelt great while the sauce was cooking but that was it.  It was a huge disappointment and I do not recommend this one!!

My wife and I made this and it was indeed easy and incredibly tasty.  We are not dedicated tofu eaters, but this was great.  We used chopped spinach in place of bok choy, because it was not available, but the recipe was still wonderful

This is very healthy. It is like a soup. I enjoyed it better the next day.
