These are to die for good. I was worried that the filling would run all over the place in baking, but it didn't. It stayed just fine. I must have used too much filling because I ran out of filling and still had a lot of dough left, so next time I make these, I will make 1/3 more filling (I could put less filling in the cookies but the filling is awesome and I don't want to skimp on the filling quantity)

I didn't have much luck with this dough even after refrigerating for several hours.  It just didn't roll out right and keep sticking to everything even with powdered sugar dusted on the surface and my rolling pin.  I haven't made many rolled cookies made with molasses other than a gingerbread men recipe that I have used many times from this site.  The lemon and gingerbread is a weird combo and it tasted ok even though they looked terrible.  I ended up making lemon bars out of the filling (the lemon and coconut is a great flavor) and molasses cookies out of the remaining dough.  Those were good.  Maybe the dough needs more flour or something. Maybe I am rolled-cookie challenged?
