Easy and delicious!   Definitely cut sugar back to 1/2 cup, and give cake several hours to cool before cutting. Texture is fairly dense and quite moist.   Flavor is amazing! The perfect  addition would be a scoop of vanilla or coffee ice cream!

Such a delicious cake, and so easy to make. I took everyoneâ€™s advice and only half a cup of sugar, and it was plenty.  My 16 year old nephew, even told me he loved it. It sort of reminds me of ginger bread.  I will be making this often.

Cake mixes already have lots of sugar, so I didn't add any extra sugar.  Cake came out just fine and tasted great without it.

Great cake.  Cutting back on the sugar didn't affect it at all.  And it was very moist.  Definitely a great dessert, and very quick to make if you're short on time.

Super quick and easy! Not too many ingredients to over complicate. Took it to the office and it was a big hit! Will keep this one in my back pocket for sure.

I baked 50 minutes, used 1/2 cup of sugar, covered it before it was completely cooled. It is super moist, not too sweet, super good. I could use a little more of the pumpkin taste.
