Three stars as written, or maybe a generous four stars, as this dish, as written, needs some pizzazz-ing up.  By the time I was done with this, Hubs thought it was “professionaI.” I sauteed up some bacon to which I added shallots and fresh, minced garlic.  Tossed in some fresh baby spinach and cooked it just until wilted.  Once cooled, I mushed that into the cream cheese along with the mozzarella and some chopped, roasted red peppers.  What a boost of flavor those few additions gave this!  I could have eaten this concoction all on its own, spread on some crostini!  But I didn’t.  We needed dinner.  Instead of crushed Ritz crackers I used seasoned bread crumbs – another layer of flavor!  Finally, instead of commercial spaghetti sauce I used tomato sauce I had put up from my garden seasoned with some herbs.  I served this over penne pasta.  This was unquestionably the most delicious and delectable dish I’ve had in some time. Thanks to Kraft/Philadelphia Cream Cheese for the basic “canvas” with which to create my own masterpiece.

This was very good, BUT because I used BLSL chicken thighs, it was too fatty. DON'T DO THAT. Use chicken breasts like the recipe states. I will say that I doubled the coating because the amount called for wasn't quite enough, used fresh spinach that I cooked down in a little EVOO and I made my own sauce. I also added a little italian seasoning to the filling. Little changes like that really make it more personal and make this dish even more flavorful. I'll make this again. Combo of everything together was really tasty.

Great little recipe that's a wonderful creamy, cheesy take on traditional chicken parmesan! Plus, the filling is a great base for add-in's so get creative and adjust to your own likes or use what you have on hand.  I used fresh spinach that I sauteed with a little garlic just until wilted along with some baby portabella mushrooms. I also added in some sun-dried tomatoes that I had on hand. I didn't have Ritz crackers, and even if I did I still opt for Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  For the pasta sauce, I used "Bertolli Marinara" that I added a little white wine to along with some fresh basil. Wow - this turned out to be a really awesome dish that was perfect for Sunday dinner! Great with a side of angel hair pasta and a garden salad - YUM!

THIS WAS SO DELICIOUS, EVEN WITH THE SPINACH MY CHILDREN ASKED FOR MORE. I USED LOW FAT CREAM CHEESE AND KEPT EVERYTHING ELSE THE SAME. I WILL DEFINATELY MAKE THIS AGAIN.

In the ingredients it says "6 (4 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to 1/4-inch thickness"
This was very good, thank you for the recipe.

This is surprisingly delicious. I only made enough for me so I changed it a bit, but followed the same flow. 3 tablespoons cream cheese, 1/8 cup mozzarella, and 1 tablespoon of parmesan.

I also used fresh spinach.

The flavor was delicious, and I will definitely be doing this again.

I didn't have any spinach and didn't use the sauce, but this was a great weeknight meal.  Fast and easy and my whole family loved it!  I am definitely putting it on the rotation!

Pretty good dish. I made my own red sauce with fresh basil and roasted garlic, and I served with sauteed vegetables topped with grated Parmesan. For me cooking time was about 45 minutes, but every oven has its own personality, right? I also cooked my own fresh spinach with a little garlic salt and olive oil. I highly recommend this; it really brings out the flavor of the dish. All in all, a good recipe, but nothing to write home about. Might make again.

So GOOD! I sauteed minced mushrooms and garlic and added that to the spinach mixture. I poured the sauce over the chicken and topped with shredded mozzarella the last 10 minutes of baking time.  My only issue was with the sauce i used. It was Bertolli Italian sausage. To salty for my taste, but not awful.

I made this tonight for dinner. I didn't have any crackers, so I dipped the chicken bundles in flour, egg, and bread crumbs. Then I fried them until golden brown and then stuck them in the oven with sauce and shredded cheese on top. I served them with a side of pasta.
My family and I decided to give this recipe an average rating of 3 stars. Honestly it was not worth the effort to pound out the chicken, make the spinach filling, and then carefully roll the bundles. The spinach filling had a very neutral taste and we hardly noticed the difference between this and ordinary chicken parmesan. I filled them quite good too! The taste was still very good for chicken parmesan (which I would give 4 stars), but the recipe is average. Bottom line: It was too time consuming to end up with a bland spinach stuffing. Next time I will save a lot of time (skip the spinach mix) and make my ordinary delicious chicken parmesan. It was still fun to try! Thanks!

DELISH! We served this to a group and EVERYONE loved it! I forgot mozzarella cheese so we used some provolone we had and it was GOOD! I recommend letting cream chz warm up a bit so you can mix it all. (We nuked it for a couple seconds) That makes it more spreadable. Also, make your own or don't skimp on a great red sauce. We used a not-so-great one and next time we will make or buy a fantastic one. Will make it even yummier! Definitely keeping as part of our main recipies!

While this recipe was liked the first time I made it, I think i will change some things next time. It needs a little bit more favor. Maybe some more spices to the ritz or ritz crumbs inside it would be good too.

I just made this recipe last night for my boyfriend and a few friends and everyone talked about how delicious it was all night! I also made a few minor changes, I used fresh spinach leaves and ground them up in my mixer with a full block of cream cheese and the mozz & parm that the recipe calls for and I added some garlic. Also I did not use the marinara or extra cheese on top because I did not think it needed it at all. Overall it was great and I will definitely be making it again!

Amazing recipe!! I tweeked it alittle , I used Breast tenderloins so they were already thin. I spread fresh spinach mixed in with Philadelphia cooking cream/italian style. I also used italian bread crumbs and after rolling the chicken and dipping it in the egg and breadcrumbs I sprinkled a little of Mrs. Dash italian seasoning on top. I found in order for the bread crumbs to brown on top , I used the smart balance cooking spray and sprayed a little on top of the chicken. I also made my own sauce, used 1 can of diced italian tomatoes, cut up 2 more fresh tomatoes, fresh basil and parsley, brown sugar  and mushrooms. stewed that together with a little vinegar. After everything was done, I put the chicken on top of penne noodles and surrounded the chicken with the sauce. Didnt really think it needed it on top. sprinkled a little mozzarella cheese and WOW, got rave reviews from the family. Awesome recipe , hubby rated 9 out of 10 stars lol..and he's a hard judge!

This dish had all the ingredients I was looking for in tonight’s meal. However, instead of frozen spinach I used fresh spinach. I sautéed a bag of fresh organic baby spinach in olive oil with minced garlic before adding it to the reduced-fat cream cheese w/shredded mozzarella cheese . I opted to use Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of ritz crackers. I served the chicken with,"Homemade Tomato Sauce I," from this website, that I made today with fresh herbs and roasted garlic. I topped it off with some sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and served over a bed of, "Garlic Angel Hair Pasta," from this site. We all enjoyed this very tasty and satisfying meal. Next time I might add mushrooms to the spinach mixture. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I was preparing the recipe & realized that I didn't have the spinach but these were still good.  Will definitely add spinach next time.  Used fresh grated Parmesan cheese and a mixture of Mozzarella with Romano & Fontina. I think they would be great if the chicken was cut in to smaller pieces and served as an appetizer with the sauce on the side for dipping. I also added a little bit of chives to the sour cream mixture.

This was so delicious and so easy to make, even my picky 4 year old loved it. The only thing I did different was mix the cream cheese, mozz cheese and spinach together in a food processor until nice and creamy and put a slice of asiago cheese in the middle before I rolled up the chicken. I served it with penne pasta and garlic bread. One of my new fave meals

Really liked, although a little messy to make.  The only change I make was that I used fresh spinach instead and sauteed it in a tbsp of olive oil, since I don't like using canned or frozen spinach.

Interesting textures. The flavor was good. We ate it with pasta but wish we could have come up with a different side instead. It was too much of the same taste.

This is a nice twist on the chicken parm I usually do.  My only complaint is I put too much spinach in my cheese mixture and felt that overwhelmed the gooey cheese taste that I love OH so much. I'm going to half the spinach next time, maybe even omit altogether. Not trying to diss Kraft, but using fresh grated cheeses and not packaged will enhance the flavor of the dish ten-fold. Will definitely make again

I'm not a chicken fan, but I was so surprised at how good this tasted, I'll be making it again. I made minor changes: Ritz crackers - I used the vegetable crackers because it was the only thing I had and I added a little bit of salt, pepper and garlic powder to the chicken breast before rolling it up. It was simple, fast and delicious!

Easy and fairly quick.  We all loved it, the chicken breasts were very moist.  My only changes were fresh spinach, and some italian seasoning mixed in with the cracker parmesan cheese breading, and i used fat free cream cheese.  I served it with whole wheat noodles on the side.  Will make again

As-is, this is a 3-star recipe.  To give it more flavor, I used Italian Herb flavored cream cheese (the new Philly Cooking Cream), and seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers.  That made it a 4-star recipe.  My boyfriend loved it, although I think I need to play around with it a little more to perfect the flavor.  Its a great base, and I'm sure I'll use this with different flavors of cheese and different veggies- maybe chopped artichoke hearts next time.  Definitely potential for a 5-star recipe if you suit it to your tastes!

Pretty good.  I didn't have any spinach on hand, so I just used the parm/mozz mix and added some oregano for flavor.  My family loved it.  I also skipped the crackers and just used Italian bread crumbs with parmesan and it turned out delicious.

Thank you for the great recipe and the boost to my confidence. I have never tried a recipe that called for rolled stuffed chicken. I have also never cooked with spinach before. It turned out great. It tasted wonderful and looked great. I did however use an alfredo type sauce instead of a red sauce. I served it along side of a quinoa pilaf. After such great success with this recipe I am now going to try chicken cordon bleu. I have always been to intimidated to make it before. I will also make more use of spinach a much neglected food in my house. Thank you so much.

Loved, loved, loved this recipe! It couldn't have been any easier and the entire family thought it was great. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, and seasoned Italian breadcrumbs in place of the Ritz crackers. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely be making this again!

Fantastic recipe!!  The cream cheese blend is a little thick and bland, so I add the entire package of cream cheese and a tablespoon or so of minced garlic.  I have made this several times, but this time I added shrimp and sliced mushrooms inside for my fiancée and it was a perfect!

I thought i try this out since my family has been asking for something different and all i had was chicken. Over all everything was amazing and everyone loved it. I did need more then 10 ritz crakers and add flavor to the ritz so they werent so dual. Everything else was as fallows. Will be making this one again

As written I would give this 3 stars. I made this again substituting ricotta for the cream cheese, using fresh spinach   and bread crumbs for the coating. I also add salt, pepper and parsley to the filling mix. I always use my own homemade pasta sauce. Amazing!!!! I'll submit a new recipe with these ingredients.

Very nice.  I used fresh spinach sauteed for a bit with garlic, along with sun dried tomato in the filling.  Next time I'll add a bit more cream cheese.  Overall it was easy to create and enjoyed by all!

I've made this twice for my family - instant hit. I used Panko instead of ritz, and added a little garlic salt to the filling. Definitely adding to my family dinner rotation list! Thanks for sharing.

Soooo good!!! I did what a lot of other reviewers did and used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. I also used thin cut chicken breasts so I didn't have to pound anything. Also used a lot more cheese. My husband couldn't get enough! Will make again very soon!!

I made this for dinner tonight minus the spinach since my family doesn't like it and they loved it. We didn't have any left overs. When I got home from work tonight my daughter asked me what I put in the middle of the chicken I told her cheese. She said it was really good and asked me to make it again tomorrow. These are the type of recipes I love to find.

SUPER TIME CONSUMING BUT SUPER DELICIOUS!!! I USED TOWN HOUSE CRACKERS and made extra spinach/cream cheese to put on angel hair pasta. Left over chicken became sandwich. Even my 2 year old loved it!!!

These were so good!  I generally like my food a little saucier, so I adjusted it to my own person tastes (incresed the amount of cheeses).  This was a great was to get my kids to eat spinach.  The whole family loved this!

These were pretty tasty! I think next time I will spring for the real cream cheese instead of trying to cut calories with fat free. The mozzarella had a nice flavor, and the crust cooked perfectly around the chicken. These appear to be very fancy when you are done. My parents were down for the weekend and really enjoyed this meal. My dad wanted the recipe! It complimented our family marinara sauce well!

My kids and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did not put the sauce on top, but it tastes great without it.  The Ritz crackers are the key.  I will definately keep and use this recipe again.

DELICIOUS!! I used fat free cream cheese and I didn't use any breading to cut down on carbs and fat.  I also cooked the spinach and added mushrooms in olive oil and garlic.  A very tasty and quick meal, and pretty health conscious when a few little tweaks are made.

Super yummy! I added a whole package of cream cheese however..didn't think a half was enough. Chicken turned out super moist too! My family loved this recipe! Even my boys who do not even like spinach! :)

Easy! Added paprika and garlic powder to the cracker and parm mix for extra flavor. Didn't use the past sauce because the chicken was so juicy it didn't need a sauce at all. Served to my in laws and picky husband with rave reviews!

The cream cheese mixture needs some doctoring for more flavor. I used fresh baby spinach sautéed in butter and fresh minced garlic. I had 4 large ckn breasts I used but should have cut them down for smaller bundles. Like the idea of seasoned breadcrumbs vs ritz crackers as they would stick better. Use a good, tasty pasta sauce!

For the part that I did make it came out good very tasty feeling. The pasta sauce not so much even though I warmed it and gave it more flavor and let it sit on the stove it came across as Acidic. In the future I will use a Richard pasta sauce that will help elevate the flavor of everything not bring it down and I also  jazzed up my cheese filling in the future I will use a Richard pasta sauce that will help elevate the flavor of everything not bring it down and I also had to  by adding some cayenne and crushed garlic.  I also season the chicken last night with some Italian seasoning so we could have some type of flavor.

Tried a slightly altered version of this last night and YUMMY! I added chopped up pieces of cooked bacon, garlic, & sundried tomato.  I had no Ritz so I used panko bread crumbs.  Once it was all cooked through, I topped the chicken with a bit of the sauce and a handful of mozzarella and baked it for a couple of minutes more and served it over whole wheat angel hair pasta.  It turned out AMAZING!  The entire family loved it.  Planned on leftovers for lunch today but there wasn't any left!
