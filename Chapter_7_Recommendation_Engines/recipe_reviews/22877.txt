After looking over the recipe and before I even read the reviews I knew that just plopping caramels on the batter would be a concern. Having said that, I made these with a couple of easy and minor changes--melt the caramels with 1/3 c. evaporated milk or half and half, stirring frequently.  Keep warm. Place half of the batter into the pan and bake about 5 minutes, then let cool a couple of minutes.  Dribble the melted caramel over the top, then sprinkle with 1 cup of chocolate chips (I also added a half cup off chopped nuts). Drop the remaining batter all over surface, spreading together carefully with a spatula.  Return to oven and bake 18-20 minutes. With this method I had a delicious, fudgey brownie, with a perfectly gooey and soft caramel center.

Instead of using the whole chocolate bar, you should break it up into little pieces
then they will not sink to the bottom of the pan, and stick.  I also had a problem with
the carmel sinking, it would work better if you melted it then poured it on top.

Oh My!!! This was soooo good! Very rich and gooey. I used a fudge brownie mix. Poured 1/2 in the pan, topped with 1 jar of Caramel Ice Cream topping (no problem with caramel melting, being too chewy, etc...), srinkled a couple of large handfuls of semi sweet chocolate chips, and then the rest of the brownie mixture. Baked until set and then drizzled more caramel sauce on top before serving. It was great and all 10 people loved it! We will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

This is a really rich treat!  I made this for my caramel-crazed boyfriend and he really liked this dessert.  The brownie baked up perfectly and the chocolate bars melted wonderfully.  If I make this again, the only change I will make is to melt the caramels down before pouring them over the chocolate bars since they did not melt down during baking, but instead maintained their cube shape.  Melting the caramel down will allow it to be more evenly distributed.  Also, I only had room in my 13x9 pan for 6 chocolate bars, even though the recipe calls for 8.  I used plain Hershey bars.

These did not turn out as well as I expected.  The caramel needed to be cut with milk or something similar.  I was expecting gooey caramel, but the caramel basically ends up harder than its original state.  Some people might like that, though.  Way too chewy for my taste.

This recipe was GREAT and easy to make!  I modified it a bit by using chocolate chips instead of candy bars and melted the caramel with 2/3 c. evaporated milk over the stove and then pouring the caramel mixture over the chocolate chips and first layer of brownies.  I also added miniature marshmallows over the carmel and then topped off with the remaining brownie mix.  It was REALLY YUMMY!

This was awesome; as a hint for the caramel - I used the "rolled caramel" circles that are used to do caramel covered apples with; that worked great and I broke it up so it's not so chewy.  Also, I used a brownie mix that had peanut butter cups in it.....Wow.

How can you go wrong with delicious chocolate brownies?  We keep kosher and I had a hard time finding kosher caramels, so I used Rolos.  Cutting them prior to putting them on  would have perfected the brownies, but they were quite delicious.  And, my 3 year old enjoyed helping prepare the recipe.

Delish and rich! Instead of a chocolate bar I used chocolate chips because it was all I had. As for the caramel, I used caramel ice cream topping. The brownies turned out so chewy and gooey, and rich! Thanks for the recipe!

Caramel pieces were too hard and chewy, stayed in the same shape. The brownies took much longer to cook than 20-25 minutes. Almost impossible to eat or cut without heating up the brownies up. Will melt the caramel and pour over chocolate pieces next time. Also, instead of candy bars, I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of candy bars, which worked great.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. It tasted good, but it was a big mess and difficult to eat. I would make again, but only with some modifications.

These are such good brownies. I seldom have any kind of mix in the house so I used the recipe One Bowl Brownies by Jody Shannon. Her recipe calls for a cup of walnuts. Instead I added a cup of lightly chopped pecans, then a half of cup over the caramel before pouring the top batter on. I thought this would make a good turtle brownie. I also melted the caramels like naples34102 suggested. They are a delicious pan of chocolate sin!

These brownies came out really fudgy and rich, but the caramel was a little chewy for my liking.  I followed the advice to melt the caramels for easy distribution, but didn't have any half and half or evaporated milk.  I will try these again with that modification.  I also only used about 10 oz of caramel and 4 hershey's bars.  I can see how chocolate chips could be easier than breaking up the bars into pieces, but the sweet milk chocolate really makes a difference.

Prep is very easy. I used box brownie mix, poured 1/2 in pan, poured a jar of caramel topping over mix, sprinkled 1/2 bag choc chips on top of caramel and put remaining brownie mix on top. Baked 30 mins. The flavor is great, however, my only complaint, they are extremely gooey so very hard to remove from the pan and even harder to send as a treat in a bag lunch. Next time, I'll put all the brownie mix in first, then top it with the caramel & choc chips. I think this may help so the gooey isn't all at the bottom.

My family loved these brownies.  I used 1 bag of milk chocolate chips instead of the candy bars, and then I did add 2/3 cup of evaporated milk to the caramel when I melted it.  I also added pecans on top of the caramel.  They were a big hit!

I made this recipe as listed. It is the best brownie my family has ever had. I may try it next time with my homemade caramel recipe. These brownies are definitely better warm as the caramels become super chewy again once cooled.
