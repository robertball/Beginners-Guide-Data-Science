A deliciously simple dish to make. I made it straight away instead of storing it. After the chicken baked and pasta was finished, I put the pasta and topped it with the chicken and baked it for a short while to let the noodles absorb some of the chicken's flavor. The sun-dried tomatoes are a beautiful and tasty addition.
