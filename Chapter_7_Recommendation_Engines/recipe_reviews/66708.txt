This is the first time I have ever rated a recipe.  This cake is just fantastic.  I made it exactly as the recipe indicated except I used milk chocolate chips on the top instead of shaved chocolate.  The cake was light yet moist and just delicious.  I have a feeling it will be even better tomorrow!

More of a spice cake, than a pear flavor. This is by no means is a bad tasting cake and it is soft and moist, but I was hoping for more pear flavor and should have known better since the pears are just on top. I followed the recipe exactly.

This cake is great for the holidays.  The spices, orange, pear, and chocolate are a great combination and the cake itself is moist and not too heavy.  This is one of the best cake recipes I have gotten off of this site.

This was a big hit at my Christmas party. The arrangement of the sliced pears on top looked so beautiful too! I don't know if it really needed the chocolate, but everything else was delicious!

This was very yummy! I used sugar instead of molasses but everything else I left the same. This was so quick and easy. I chopped the chocolate really small and could hardly taste it. I will make it bigger chunks next time. I will be making this again

This recipe sounded so simple so I had my doubts..... I took it to a birthday gathering and it was a huge hit, everyone asked for the recipe.  I did not change a thing .... it turned out beautifule with the arrangement of pears on top ... looked like it came from a bakery.  Thank you for this simple recipe.

Delicious!  Made exactly as suggested.  I was surprised that even my 5 year old liked it.  I thought the spices would scare her off.  I think I went over 1TB on orange peel but it was great.
