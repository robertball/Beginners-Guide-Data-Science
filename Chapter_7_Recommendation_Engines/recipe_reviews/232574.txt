This was really tasty!  I used Good Seasons Garlic & Herb and less olive oil due to personal preference.  It was simple and quite flavorful.  Thanks for sharing - I wouldn't have thought to do this!

I have tried a lot of broccoli recipes over the years because I am determined to *like* broccoli, but this is my favorite (and probably the healthiest and easiest) by far. Salad lovers should enjoy this recipe even if they don't love broccoli. I like that it can be easily modified using a variety of dried salad dressing mixes--and that you can make dry mixes to suit your own tastes. I think will be trying a ranch vinaigrette version made with homemade ranch mix next.

This is an interesting recipe.  While it's not something I'd *crave*, I did find myself picking at it while waiting for the rest of dinner to be ready.  I don't think I'd plan to make it again, but would use it if I found myself w/broccoli that needed used.  I will greatly reduce the EVOO, though, because I had a pool of oil on plate.   THANKS for the recipe!
