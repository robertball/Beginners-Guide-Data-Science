A couple of notes:  I love how allrecipes cleaned up my recipe!  They changed a couple of minor things, though, which I understand.  

Steps 5 and 6 in the directions are a little different that I would do it too, thought it might work as described. However you do it, always keep the dough covered when not working it to keep it from drying. A very light dusting of flour (I just brush the sheets with a flour-covered hand) will keep the sheets from sticking to each other) The way I make the dough roll is just to roll all the dough through the machine til very thin, then one at a time, stretch the dough from one end, brushing with fat and rolling until I get to the end, then start the next piece, overlapping them just enough to keep the sheets together.  This way, the dough doesn't dry out. Either way, you should be able to stretch the dough to at least twice the width it was as a sheet after its last trip through the pasta machine.

YEAH! This is exactly the kind of complicated, multi-step, can't-find-locally kind of recipe I totally geek out on. First off, this was really fun to make. When I sliced into the dough log after it chilled, I exclaimed, "COOL!" because it looked like a big fat leek, with all the dough layers visible. I used homemade candied orange peel--with a recipe this fancy, why go halfway? I also don't think I stretched the dough enough after rolling it through the pasta machine. Oh: and rather than rolling the dough immediately after mixing it in the Kitchenaid, I wrapped it in plastic and let it sit on the counter while I made the filling. I did use the extra 2 teaspoons of water and the dough was still very tight; I wanted to give the flour time to absorb the moisture. When I did roll it out, it had a lovely, plastic texture. Like I said, my dough wasn't thin enough because the pastries were very, very crunchy--like the edge of the lasagna noodle that sticks up and gets dried out during baking. It wasn't unpleasant--but I wanted it to be thinner, more tender, like phyllo or strudel pastry. While I should probably just make the recipe again and see what happens, I also think I'd like to try adding just an ounce of fat to the dough to make it more extensible and tender. I didn't use all of the butter-lard mixture, and I some filling left over, which I froze and plan to use in breakfast pastries or for a yeasted coffeecake or something. Thanks for this great-tasting project!

I can buy sfogliatelle ricce from the Italian bakeries where I live, which are made like this recipe. I have to admit that I am not a fan of the baked ricotta filling after having tasted the American version of the sfogliatelle, the lobster tail at Mike's Pastry in Boston. I have searched high and low and cannot find a lobster tail locally, so I resorted to making my own and used this recipe for the dough. The difference between the traditional sfogliatelle ricce and the lobster tail is that the lobster tails are not filled and baked with the ricotta filling, but are instead filled and baked with pate a choux (eclair paste)in order to expand and elongate their shape, which will resemble a lobster's tail. Then, after they cool, they are injected with a creamy filling that is basically diplomat cream (pastry cream mixed with whipped cream). 
I can vouch for the quality of the dough in this recipe, but I did not use the ricotta filling, so I cannot comment on that. I definitely had to add more water, even more than the recommended 2 teaspoons to get the correct consistency. After forming the shells, I filled them with choux paste and baked at 425 F for 10 minutes and at 375 for 10 more minutes. The choux paste forms a hollow cavity that can be filled with anything you desire. I do recommend the diplomat cream, but would try others in the future, such as sweetened mascarpone and whipped cream with chocolate and cherries; a chocolate diplomat cream; or a hazelnut cream.

I followed the directions to a T and they came out perfect, dough especially. If I had to be critical, I might use less vanilla and cinnamon, only because i am trying to replicate Libby's in new haven. Dough is easy to make and filling also. I used a blender for the filling and mine might have been too smooth. The rolling of the dough takes some getting used to, cause mine kept ripping but it didn't seem to matter. Most important is trying to keep your roll nice and tight so when you cut it, the layers won't separate. I watched many YouTube videos before attempting and I would suggest the same. Some are in Italian but all you need to see is the technique for rolling. Also the shaping of the cone takes some practice but once you get one right, you'll have it down. Avoid flattening the disc like I saw some videos do, you really need a cone shape to have the clam shell shape. Making the candied orange peel was time consuming. Do it the night or even weeks before to save time. Took all day but I've always wanted to make them!

Definitely a complicated recipe, but I consider this a home cooks web site.  The directions are not very clear about the size of the dough.  If in the end I am supposed to get 20 1/2inch peices then my dough should not be any longer than 10 inches?  Mine was at least twice that length.  I ended up using all the butter/lard.  When I checked on them in the oven they were swimming in grease.  I had trouble understanding the "flatten into a cone" direction.  I had lots of filling left over and was unable to close them but it did not run all over.

Third time making sfogliatelle, but first time using this recipe. Pretty much followed the recipe. Used my Atlas hand cranked pasta maker down the second thinnest setting. Dough was very easy to work with. Nice crispy crunch as they should have. I make these once a year and always worth the effort.

Delicious.  The filling was spectacular in particular, and it is NOT necessary for the orange rind to be candied.  Fine grating works fine ;-)

 If I were to suggest two improvements, indicate the salt measures (at least) in tsp.  My salter doesn't measure well at low weights.  Also, I couldn't initially grasp how to roll the dough, but your comment is VERY helpful.

Biggest problem with this recipe is the measurements for the dough.  Needed to convert all dough measurements to metric then weigh them out.  Dough recipe did produce a finished product as thin as commercial bakeries but used different recipe for balance of batch we made and enjoyed.

I've made this many times and this is the best dough recipe I have used so far! Converting everything to metric to get proper weights was time consuming but totally worth it! Now, onto the filling. It tastes absolutely amazing but I wish that was by weight as well. It didnt stand up as much as previous batches and I think that's because the ricotta is too much at the state after it's been food processed. I used the amount measured after processing when I should have used that amount prior.

Oops, what a mess. The filing spread all over the baking tray.
Real tasty, but a bomb for the desert as planned.
I will review a few YouTube tutorials and try it again. I will say that it has certainly improved my pasta making, that dough is now silky smooth. But this recipe bombed.

I did follow the instructions and the result was awful! 
I am Italian and believe me I know the taste of a good Sfogliatella!
