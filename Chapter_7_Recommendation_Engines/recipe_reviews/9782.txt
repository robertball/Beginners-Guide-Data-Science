I made these cookies for my niece who is in college.  Here is what she said: (also, my husband loved the chocolate, coffee taste)

Dear Auntie, 

I got cookies today!  And they're so yummy---thanks a bunch!  What kind are they?  They're very different...I've never had anything like them, but boy are they addictive.  Yum.  They're sort of coffee/cinnamon-ish.  Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I got them and they're wonderful and thanks a lot!

Love, 
El

Can't comment on the cookies, just the chocolate dip. It was perfect for shortbread cookies; I dipped it in the chocolate then rolled them in toasted pecans. A hint if you don't have chips: 1/2 cup morsels is about 3 oz of baking squares. 3oz and 1 Tbsp was enough for 1 dozen medium sized cookies. Also, I found it easier to just microwave the chocolate and shortening for a few minutes, stirring every so often. Thanks!

I make these every year at Christmas and they are always a hit.  I lost my recipe, but you have saved the day.  The name of my recipe is "Cappachino Flats" but the ingredients are the same.

I made these for a cookie exchange this week and they were very yummy.  The coffee taste is so light that we all liked them, even though we aren't coffee drinkers.  I just dropped them by the spoonful on the cookie sheet rather than forming a roll and cutting slices like the recipe says.

These cookies where so good, and I thought the recipe was very easy to make. The coffee taste was not very strong next time I will add  1/2 to 1 tbs more or instant coffee. I highly recommend this to all the readers

Not great, not terrible.  Probably won't make this again.  The rounds weren't very flavorful, and really not good at all without the chocolate dip. The dip was great, very simple.  May be better with a little more sugar?  Mine also turned out a little crisper than I like.

These are great cookies!  Although they took a little effort to put together, they were fun, very tasty and perfect for a chocoholic like myself.  Even those who weren't huge chocolate fans loved these cookies.

These cookies turned out well, but I wasn't impressed with the taste.  I think a nice twist would be to dip them in white chocolate.  I probably will not make them again just because they took so long to prepare and I just didn't like the flavor.

These were ok but they didn't have any special "wow"-feeling to them and honestly - quite boring!

Fabulous.  I made the dough and kept it in the freezer since I made this several days in advance.  It sliced up fine frozen.  I also used instant espresso powder instead of coffee...

These cookies were on my Christmas baking list for years but I lost the recipe during a move. They are very popular with my family, loved by all with the exception of my sister who does not like coffee. Thank-you for sharing your recipe!
