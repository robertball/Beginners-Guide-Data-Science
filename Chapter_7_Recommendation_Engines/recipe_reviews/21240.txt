I remade this recipe & did some revising.  In the end, my husband loved it while my teens liked it.  
Here is what I done.
(1) I used only 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth (Use less if you want firmer or bake at 350 for 20 minutes if it's to soupy.)
(2) I omitted the yogurt & added 1/2 cup sour cream.  Big difference in taste.
(3) I added another can of cream corn to mix.
(4) I used garlic powder instead of cloves.
(5) I used margarine instead of butter.
(6) I added 4 tbsp of sugar for a sweeter taste.
(7) I scooped everything into a micro safe dish and nuked on high for 5 minutes for extra firmness. Much quicker then oven. (Make sure to use a big enough bowl or it will spew over.)

With this revised...I can give this recipe 5 stars!  Takes about 30 minutes to prepare alone.

This is definately Not Southern style! The only veggies that a true southern cook adds are, onions and celery that have been sauted in butter. Also the only spices that should be added are, salt,ground black pepper, and Sage

An amazing recipe. I have made this 3 times now and have decided to make the following changes. Only 2 1/2 cups of broth needed. I also put the stuffing back into the pan and bake in the over for about 20 min. to brown the top. I agree with others that this is sweeter then I would of liked but have grown to like it that way. I add a bit more spices to help c/a the sweetness. I add fresh chives as well which adds some nice flavor. Makes it a bit savory. Very good recipe. I think all will enjoy. My company and I always do!

I used one dry cornbread mix and used dry cornbread crumbs.  I used creole seasonings (in the produce section, Fresh Garlic, onions, celery, red bell peppers, and parsley).  I also used sour cream instead of yogurt.  Good!

I first reviewed this 12/5/05 and I've made this a lot since then.  I have only one problem with this recipe, my 23 y/o daughter insists that we have this every single holiday.  I'm ready for a change, but my family won't let me.  Well I'm off to make the cornbread now.

A new Holiday favorite in my family! I used less Cayenne the second time I made it and did without the green bell peppers. This recipe is SO good!

This is a great recipe that can be modified to your liking. I was hesistant about using yogurt but glad I did. I substituted a can of cream of mushroom for the corn,omitted the green peppers, and added 2 cups of dry stuffing mix. I seasoned my cornbread before baking in addition to the seasonings the recipe called for. I also re-baked the stuffing itself for about 35 mins after combining all the ingredients - which resulted in a very moist but firm stuffing. Everyone loved it including my 4 & 6 year old girls, I received lots of compliments. I look forward to making this side dish again.

I like the fact that it does not call for sausage as many other cornbread stuffing recipes do. The only change I made was only adding 2 cups of chicken broth, and it was still very moist, 3 may have been too much.

I just made this for Thanksgiving. I increased the recipe by 50%. Added green onions instead of regular onions and a red pepper instead of a green pepper. It made for a very colorful side dish.

I didn't use the green peppers, but I've already gotten compliments from the pitch-in about the little bit of kick that it has. Great Choice!

I took the advice of other reviewers and used a cornbread mix that wasn't sweet. Big mistake! More than half of it was left and my hubby commented that it would've been better with a sweet cornbread and without the corn. I have to agree. I will make it again, with a mix like Jiffy instead. I also used sour cream instead of yogurt (I happened to have some already in the fridge) and left out the bell pepper (forgot to get it from the market and it was Christmas Day so the market was closed). I also think it's too much liquid - it was a little mushy.

Great recipe. To make it heartier I add a pound of ground sausage, just brown it separate and drain then mix in and put the dish in the oven on 350 for 15 to 20 minutes to brown the top and to remove some of the moisture because the original recipe comes out a bit moist for my liking.

Okay, this is a great recipe for the cornbread itself.  You can even make it Parve!!  But  being from the south, I know this recipe does not cut it.  It can be salvaged.  Here is what I did. First of all, leave out the green pepper!  Once you have combined the cornbread and broth mixture, add two beaten eggs.  Put it back in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20- 30 minutes!  I do love the spice the cayenne pepper adds to this recipe.  Good luck!

This is the recipe I have been searching for. This reminds me of my childhood. My family loves this recipe. I will use this for many years to come. I did use sour cream in place of the yogurt.

Oh my, what can I say about this easy recipe that was such a hit. My 16 y.o. daughter asked if she can make it for me and my family loved it. She has been asked to make it for several family members.

This was great!  Everyone loved the new stuffing this year and while I always make stove top for my picky brother, he even wanted more of the cornbread stuffing and said I didn't need to make stove top next year!  I did only use 2.5 cups of liquid and then put it back in the 9x13 at 350 for about 20 minutes to harden the top a little bit.

Great recipe. I did not like the sweet cream corn because it my the stuffing too sweet for me. So I made it again. using regular corn. Also used sour cream instead of yogurt. Used vegetable broth-vegetarian friendly. Next time I will use 21/2 cups of broth.

I browned it in the broiler for a few minutes, and I used red onion which gave it just a pop of color. I got lots of compliments on this dish at my office Thanksgiving dinner. Very yummy!

Great taste and flavor, but strong. I would have liked more cornbread in it to mellow it out a bit. Also, this was way too much liquid. I had to put it in the oven for almost an hour to dry it out. I think next time I make it I will add more cornbread and that will solve both of my issues. Otherwise, people really liked it and it was delicious.

Followed the recipe exactly, came out great!, only thing i did differnt was used just 2cups of broth instead of 3... i think it would have been "watery" if i used all 3 cups. but other than that everyone seemed to love it!

Absolutely wonderful! I went ahead and made the cornbread the night before so it was easier to work with the next day. I only omitted the green pepper, but kept everything else the same.

This recipe was really good! I followed the recipe almost exactly...I used sour cream instead of yogurt (personal preference) and did not add the cayenne pepper because I didn't have any. I used Jiffy cornbread mix & it was just the right amount of sweetness. I made it the night before Thanksgiving and my husband & I tasted it and thought it was so, so. On Thanksgiving I put it in the crock pot for 2.5-3 hours on high to heat up and it was absolutely delicious! I think the extra heating time allowed all the flavors to blend together better. Great recipe....and all of our guests loved it too!

This stuffing was the best by far!  

I did however make a few changes as other reviewers suggested.  I omitted the yogurt and instead used 1/2 cup sour cream, and omitted the cayenne pepper entirely. I placed in the oven on 350 for 20 minutes for extra firmness.

Hmmmm way too many spices, ended up being HEAVILY spiced.  I used half the amount called for and was still a bit much, would cut spices to quarter, with exception of salt, and use 1-1/2 cups broth instead

Very good... Oregano flavor slightly overpowering and you should definitely bake for 20-30 minutes longer after mixing in cornbread.

I tried to make this recipe vegan. Don't do it. Find another recipe. It was a mistake to use Hodgson Mills cornbread mix with flaxseed/water and so delicious yogurt. That cornbread started out less desirable. Then it was a big mistake to add 2 tsp of salt AND 2.5 cups of veggie broth. The result was edible, but a bit salty and not tasting anything like the stuffing i made 2 years prior when I wasn't a veg*n.  Giving it three stars because it might have tasted good if I didn't change it.

This was an excellent recipe.  Add liquid slowly to your liking. Be careful with the cayenne pepper- it might sneak up on you.  I doubled the recipe and used Marie Calendar's mix.  I did not think that it was too sweet.  I found it to be a nice balance between sweet and savory.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  Everyone left it on their plate.  I followed recipe exactly.  We have been laughing about it since Thanksgiving.  I don't know what went wrong. Maybe the corn, maybe the cayanne pepper.  I did not mind it but everyone else ask me where the stovetop was.

I hadn't made the stuffing for Turkey Day because it was my husband's grandmother always did it. Well as they canceled Thanksgiving this year, I got to cook and I chose this recipe for my stuffing, revising it to some of the sugestions in reviews I'd read. It's WONDERFUL! I used sour cream in place of the yogurt simply because I already had sour cream in the house. I also used only 1/8 a tsp. of cayenne, and 1/8 tsp. sage. When I picked up the corbn muffin mix I got 2 different kinds, one white and one honey golden, just for giggles. My husband LOVES it (and he never ate much stuffing before)- I love it too except I think there is a lil too much oregano, so I will probably halve that next time I make it, but I WILL be making it again.. .it is now "THE" stuffing recipe for us.. in-laws or no!

This recipe was not good at all.  Also had to use too many pots and baking dishes.  I will use Stove Top until I find a worthy cornbread dressing.

I had two problems: one, I thought the resulting mixture was too sweet, and, two, I must have made a mistake with the cayenne pepper, because it was also overwhelmingly spicy. I managed to remedy both problems more or less by dumping in some generic stuffing mix which I happened to have on hand, adding more broth to compensate, and finally throwing in some turkey sausage, finely chopped. The result was an interesting flavor although the texture a bit mushy due to the extra broth. I did bake it twice, which I'd do even if I hadn't improvised. If I make it again, I'll probably try cornbread mix instead of the muffin base. I skipped the green pepper (no one likes it in our family) but next time would probably use red pepper. I also left out the creamed corn only b/c it sounded so unappealing....maybe that was a mistake. But maybe it was worth it, because my daughter loved it, husband praised it and our guests seemed to like it. Once modified, the cayenne gave it a nice kick, so I'd say that's a keeper. (Honestly I think I put in 1/2 tsp by accident, it was that spicy.)

This was really good. I used veggie broth instead of chicken stock. The flavor was great. My boyfriend pretty much ate the whole batch overnight while I was sleeping. Definitely making this again.

This recipe had good flavor & I liked how you are able to make the texture you want. However, it wasn't my favorite. I probably won't make it again so I'm giving 3 out of 5 stars.

Okay but a bit to spicy for me.  I was hoping for more cornbread taste and it definitely had a kick to it.  I may make it again and pair it with a spicier meat dish.  It really wasnt bad it just wasnt what I was going for.

This was very easy and very good! It has a nice twist of sweet and spicy.  Even my fiance and his friend who don't like stuffing really enjoyed it. We ran out of onions  so I had to leave them out and i added a bit more paprika. i'm not sure if making the cornbread ahead of time, letting it and then adding the broth might make it keep a bit more structure, but I'm thinking of trying that the next time.

As a base, this is the best!!  It is very easy to "tweak" for your own personal tastes.  I've found that adding several sliced mushrooms, and adding some cider vinegar to the mix make it even better.  This has been requested as a regular for future holidays.

Made it,  but after I mix it, I bake it at 350 for 30 min or so.

Very liquidy and not Southern at all to be honest. For it to even be edible I had to cook it for 1 hr 30 min at 415 degrees after the initial 45 minutes at 350.

Love this receipe! I always add creole seasoning  to the broth mixture and the corn bread mix for some extra flavor. And sometimes I will add extra cream style corn. Tastes great and my family loves it.

This was such a hit at Thanksgiving with my family! I? was specifically asked to make cornbread stuffing. I? had never made it, but this was super easy and yummy! I? added the chicken stock a little at a time to get the consistency I? wanted.

Loved it.  This was my first time making stuffing and I followed the recipe but cut the spices in half and left out the green peppers. It's amazing!!

My mom and I made this for thanksgiving this year. This recipe is the bomb, the family loved it! Will definitely make again. We used the entire 1/2 cup of yogurt and baked the stuffing for 30 minutes after it was mixed. Watch the amount of liquid you add to the cornbread; use less for a more dry stuffing. Maybe use half the amount of spices called for (my mom's advice, i prefer full amount) it depends what you like.

Delicious. The only changes I made was adding sage and poultry seasoning. Also, sour cream instead of yogurt.

I have been making this recipe for about 5 years. The only change I have made is to bring the cayenne pepper to 1 tsp rather than 1/4 tsp. Though not a change, I use Jiffy every time. I am asked to make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas, so there are times when I make 2 or 3 batches. throughout the seasons. We are from Texas and I have not found anyone that did not like it. Thank you for a great dressing recipe!

To be fair, I added shredded chicken to this recipe and forgot to get green pepper from the store, so it likely would have changed the flavor a bit.  But, I think I can give a fairly accurate rating based on what I made.  The sweetness of the creamed corn contradicted the seasonings.  To me, it was too sweet and the spices just weren't right.  I guess I'm used to the dressings that taste more like... Thanksgiving... with spices like sage, marjoram, and poultry seasoning.  I just couldn't wrap my head around this one.  I will say that it was very easy though.

I did not care for this recipe as written. Despite how many vegetables I cut up for this, in reality, all I could really taste was the cornbread.  There was absolutely too much chicken broth called for, among other things. 
I could just as easily made the corn bread and mashed it up with a couple of sauteed vegetables.  
I would highly recommend reading, and going with, one of the altered versions of this.

This was  my first time making stuffing and I thought it was great and very flavorful for as simple as it was. It is strong..but it all depends on what you prefer.  A lot of pple mentioned using less broth...but I used all 3 cups (of mushroom broth) and I thought it was a perfect consistency. We will see how the family likes it tomorrow!

Delicious! It's especially moist, unlike boxed stuffing mix.  I couldn't stop eating it out of the pan.  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was gone in a heartbeat.  I will be making this every year from now on.

Received great reviews from family. I used cream of mushroom instead of the corn and only about 2 cups of the broth as other reviewers suggested. First time ever making dressing and it turned out great!

I made this today and we were not impressed.  It had a very strong Italian smell and taste to it.  The consistency of the cornbread was more like mush even though I did add more cornbread to help with the fluid.  I do not believe we will be having this again.

I used Marie Calendar's cornbread mix and made the recipe without changes. My husband (NOT a cornbread stuffing lover) raved about both the cornbread and the stuffing it made. He told me to keep this recipe.

Delightful!  Just made it as a trial run for Thanksgiving.  Husband said the more he ate, the more he liked it.  I added a few slices of broken up toasted bread because we are used to more of a bread dressing.  The mix of bread and cornbread was just right for us.  Great recipe and measure of herbs/spices.

This was pretty good, but wasn't crazy about the oregano, and maybe should have used sour cream instead of yogurt?  Was still good though, and not many left overs!

This came out pretty well.  I followed some of the recommendations regarding cutting the cayenne down and I regretted it.  I think next time I will put in the required amount baked right into the cornbread.

The cornbread itself was great...much moister with the yogurt.

pretty good but 1) cornbread makes it quite sweet, probably too sweet for my taste for stuffing and 2) in the end it's pretty mushy so maybe dried out cornbread would work much better I think.  Also I only did a little chili powder but not much because kids were eating too

Our family and friends loved this recipe.  Some said that they don't normally like stuffing because they don't like cooked onions but this was great.  The cayenne gave it an unexpected kick!

Was very easy to put together and the taste was wonderful.  Had a lot of compliments on how tasty and moist it was.

This recipe was excellent.  It is very moist (which I love).  The only thing that I did differently than the recipe directed was to add sage.  I love sage in my dressing.  Also because I forgot to buy the garlic cloves, I only used one that I already had at home.  So my recipe was minus 3 garlic cloves.  Next time I plan to not forget the rest of the garlic (another one of my favorite ingredients).  Again this recipe is great.
