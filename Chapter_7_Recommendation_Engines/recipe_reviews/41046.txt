This is an Excellent chocolate candy.  I used mixed nuts and they are wonderful!  It was very easy and quick and a definite go for next Christmas.  The other ingredient I would like to try with this recipe is to use milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet chips (which were very good by the way) and to somehow incorporate peanut butter into the recipe (because I'm a PB fanatic).  Anyhow,  Thank you!  These were really delicious!!
