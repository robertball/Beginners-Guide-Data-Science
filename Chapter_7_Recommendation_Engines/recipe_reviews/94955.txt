This is the first recipe I have tried on allrecipes.com.  Wow!  It was awesome.  My husband loved it and asked to add it to our normal rotation.  FYI: I did double the amount of Horseradish because we really like horseradish.  It would also be good over bluefish.

This is a wonderful way prepare Halibut.  Its very rich, but delicious!  I din't have any 'regular' hoarseradish so I used Wasabi instead.  It worked well.  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe.  The flavors are good and the halibut turned out nice and moist.

LOVED it! Only suggestion I have is to make sure the dijon sauce is spread evenly over the filet surface so you don't get a thick spot in one bite. We will definitely make this again!

Used salmon and didn't have horseradish on hand, but it turned out great!  Will definitely make again and again.

This was a great recipe. I didn't have horseradish(but I really don't like it)so I just added in a tablespoon of roasted garlic.I didn't have halibut so I used Ocean Perch instead. Everybody liked it I will be making this again and will try different fish with it. Thanks for this recipe

Excellent as is. My only change was using a single piece of halibut, which was over 1lb, so I increased the cooking time by about10 min. Very tender, & well liked by all.

Searching for a recipe for halibut I found this, and while it at first looked appealing, it also looked vaguely familiar.  Sure enough, I found I had previously made a nearly identical AR halibut recipe for thisâ€“ and neither Hubs nor I cared for it, finding the topping just too overpowering for the delicately flavored halibut.

I left out the horseradish to make it more kid friendly. Both my kids liked it - one of whom doesn't really like fish. I love recipes like this that are quick but taste like they were a lot of work.

Obviously liking the strong flavors of dijon and horseradish are musts to enjoy this dish!  I actually used the exact recipe except substituted haddock for the halibut due to no halibut fillets being available at the store.  Tasted excellend and I would use haddock again, or halibut next time if it's available.  I actually cooked it at 375 for 18 minutes and it turned out moist and the dijon topping really complimented the haddock.

Everyone including the kids loved this!!  I scaled back the horseradish so it wouldn't be too spicy.  The kids complained it was too tangy.  I think I would also only put 2 tsp. of lemon juice.

This was really good.  Instead of halibut, I used tilapia (my son's preference) and decreased the horseradish a bit.  The fish was moist and very flavorful... will make again.  Thanks!

OH MY!! This was sooo good! I'm not a fish eater, but am trying to eat more. I made this and I honestly think this will be a regular recipe for me. Use Lite Mayo for less calories/fat, etc.

This was fantastic! We're on a low cholestoral/fat diet, so I made a few adjustments. I used fat-free plain yougurt in place of the mayo; made my own breadcrumbs with whole wheat bread in the food processor; omitted the butter; and used just a small sprinkle of cheese on the top. I cooked it at about 390 for 18 minutes. It was perfect. The sauce also goes well on the plate next to the fish, just be sure not to contaminate it when your coating the fish. Oh, I coated the filets on all sides with the sauce, then the breadcrumbs, then sprinkled the cheese. Served it with broiled tomatoes and broccoli. Seriously, yum!

This was so amazing.  We absolutely loved it.  The only thing I changed was I used 2 tsp hot horseradish instead of 1 Tbls and I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs because that was all I had.  We will definitely make this again!

Delicious!  When husband brought home 2 halibut fillets that cost almost $18.00, I surely hoped this recipe would be a success...didn't have any horseradish, so I reconstituted some wasabi powder in water and used panko instead of plain dry breadcrumbs.  Baked at 400* (convection) for 20 minutes, and it was seemed perfectly done.  So it was definitely a success, but at that price I think I'll be substituting a less expensive fish next time.

Husband likes!  Quick and easy too.  Last time I didn't have any horseradish, so I added some crushed red pepper instead to give it some kick.  Thanks!

I love this fish recipe!  Very delicious, lends a great flavor to the fish.  Instead of halibut, we used cod, since my husband does not prefer halibut.
