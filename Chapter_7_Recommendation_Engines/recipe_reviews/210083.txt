I was looking for a recipe that would make drop dumplings as easily as Bisquick but without the Bisquick's fake ingredients.  This is it!  Perfectly soft and puffy.  Only change I made was to use butter rather than shortening.

I forgot to make bread with our stew yesterday which was a tragedy so we decided to throw in some dumplings instead. My three year old calls them ducklings and he thought they were great. We didn't have any leftovers so I'll definitely be using this recipe again. Very tasty and really easy to make. Thanks!

We like dumplings in beef stew and I've never been able to make really good ones.  Until yesterday.  I made them too large really but it didn't matter.  They were perfect,  light and tender all the way through.  My only change was to add coarsely ground pepper. I'll halve the size next time but I'll use this recipe.

These were great.  Made them dairy free due to dietary restrictions in the family.  Used 3 Tbsp ground flax seed and 2 Tbsp canola oil for the shortening and 3/4 cup rice milk for the milk.  They were delicious!

Good old fashioned bread dumplings! Simple and perfect for stew. I added a tablespoon of dried parsley flakes for color but that's it. You can add other herbs but why ... the simplicity of this  dumpling compliments and doesn't compete with the stew's gravy. After plopping mine on top of the stew I covered with a lid and turned heat to the lowest setting for 10 minutes and then turned off the heat and left them rest while still covered for another 10 minutes. They puffed up nice and had a wholesome goodness to them.

These were really good dumplings, a bit too fluffy for my liking though, I like them a bit more dense.

This is exactly the ingredients my mom and grandma used to use for drop dumplings in boiled chicken. Thank you for this recipe, as I did not get it from them. I've been looking for a drop dumpling recipe like they used to make.

SOOOOO easy and soooooo tasty.  I have always bought the yellow box of biscuit mix to make dumplings.  These are far better and the texture is less heavy.

Perfect! The exact recipe I was looking for.  I added some herbs and spices before mixing in the milk and they were fabulous in stew. Thanks for sharing :)

I sauteed carrots, celery, onions, garlic and a bay leaf together and then added some diced chicken breast. Thickened with cornstarch added salt and pepper to taste and then made these dumplings. They were great. They did not turn out as pictured but maybe my broth was more bubbly. Still they were chewy on the outside and bread like in the middle which is exactly how I want my dumplings. I did use butter instead of shortening. Thank you for the great recipe I will use over and over.

Followed the recipe. Very good. Was able to reheat the dumplings by very carefully removing them from cold soup, heating soup to a slow simmer and dropping dumplings back on top for about 10 minutes.

I used butter for the shortening and just a pinch of salt, followed the directions and ended up with exremely light melt in your mouth dumplings my family loved. Don't forget always eat your dumplings with a fork, if you cut into them with a spoon it flattens them and they lose that "aireness".

Very fast, easy, and delicious; a must-have for winter stews and soups! The only thing I changed was to use butter instead of shortening, and cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp since the butter I used was salted. My husband told me he would love it if I served these with every soup or stew we eat.

Used these in the Slow Cooker chicken and dumplings, I didn't want to use refrig biscuits. Added a little chopped fresh rosemary and made small balls which I elongated so they looked like little footballs. I think next time I will leave out the rosemary but these were very easy and good!

This is so much like my Mom's dumplings. The only difference is that she added one egg to the dough. Her dumplings were light and airy and so delicious.

Very simple and yummy.  Made it for chicken and dumplings.  My kids like it better than baking powder biscuits--it's easier and faster too!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

These dumplings were delicious! I used self rising flour, used butter instead of shortening, added finely shredded colby jack cheese, about 4 tbs, garlic powder and parsley flakes. I did not add any salt. Awesome on top of my lemon chicken stew!

We all loved these! I used butter instead of shortening. I baked the leftovers just like you would biscuits and my family devoured them. I'm looking into using this recipe as a dry mix so we can have dumplings/biscuits at the drop of a hat.

Just so you know....this was Great Gramma Viki's recipe from so long ago, & I've loved it all my life ( and I'm almost 70, so it's OLD!).  However, a dumpling is a "gentle" thing.  If you have the heat too high, or "boil" the poor thing, it WILL disintegrate.  Don't have to thicken the soup anymore, but I LIVE for those dumplings!!!  "Gently simmer", please!  !!!  

HTH!!!

Aptly named, yet so very good, this is definately a keeper.  The family gorged themselves on my chicken and dumplings.  I will try some in a stew next.  Keep in mind that these will thicken your broth.

I have not made this specific recipe yet.  I plan to as lost mine.  If your dumplings break up, try having your soup/stew simmering and not at a rolling boil.  Cook  the same, I do lid on for 10, then lid off for 10.  * Before scooping up the dumpling dough, dip the spoon, I use a serving spoon, into the soup/stew and then scoop a spoonful of batter and gently place into soup/stew by putting spoon into soup.   Then dip spoon again, and repeat.  This prevents the dough from sticking to the spoon.

These were wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly and had to add a little more flour as the dough was very wet but the came out fluffy and perfect.  I had baked a turkey and used the drippings plus a can of chicken broth and additional water.  The best recipe I've found.

Very easy to make. Didn't have baking powder so I used self rising and omitted salt and baking powder. Turned out fluffy and delicious!!!  My husband and kids love it!!

Never tried to make chicken and dumplings before, but I found a recipe last night for a crockpot version. However it called for refrigerated premade biscuits... Which I neither had on hand, or wanted to use based on the various reviews. Found this recipe this morning while it was cooking. So happy with it! Forgot to read the number of servings so I have more dough then needed, but it's a simple recipe with cheap ingredients so I'm not too upset. I did substitute margarine for shortening simply because that's what I had on hand. Which from what I've seen is a pretty common substitution. Atleast in my home ;)

Finally, the dumpling I remember my mother making! My dumplings were always lead balls. The secret I was missing is in this recipe. Shortening - not cold butter. Made my dumplings light and fluffy! Like Mom's I added about 1 teaspoon nutmeg. Ah, back to my childhood!

Excellent, however, mom taught me to save a bundle of time and effort by following the directions for dumplings on the side of the bisquick box.  This is exactly what you get.

Love this recipe. I did change it up just a bit. I used kosher salt and  whole buttermilk. I also dropped the dough by half teaspoon full. I lightly peppered the dumplins when done. They were wonderful. I will never use another dumplin recipe ever again.

This recipe is a keeper for me. I made it last night using butter and goats milk...then added it in globs into my Beef Veggie Soup covered it for about 20-30 min and it all was delicious. I was going to withhold the full amount of salt at first but I did add all the salt. A keeper. thanks for sharing.

Very good and easy to make.  The second time I made them I added some herbs and formed them into balls with my hands instead of just spooning them in because I like dumplings a little denser.  They were delicious.

I would have given these 3 stars, but I think it just comes down to personal preference.  I like my dumplings a little denser, these were a little fluffier (dry) on the inside.

This was the first time I ever made dumplings and I must say they were awesome.  Thanks for this easy recipe.  Although I had to look up how to cut in the shortening, but it was easier than I thought.  I ended up making a sausage soup to cook these in and that turned out great too.  I cut the salt down to 1/2 a tsp because of the salt in the chicken stock and the sausage.

These are definitely simple dumplings.  They made great chicken and dumplings.  They puffed up nicely and were nice and gooey on the outside.

These dumplings are excellent!  I have used the same recipe for years, but now I will switch.  These are lighter and fluffier than mine.  It doesn't make too many though, next time I might try doubling it, three hungry boys eat lots of dumplings!

The dumplings turned out great. The dumplings didn’t thicken up as much as I would have liked. My next batch I will use 2 cups of flour. 1 1/2 cups for the dumplings, with the remaining 1/2 cup to be mixed with a little butter and added in as a thickening agent. They should be great!

So easy, and tasted great! I used butter as the shorting, and a little less salt, but other then that made as written. 
I put this one in my recipe book for using again.

Wonderful, light, tender dumplings, with just the right flavor. Of course, I use butter instead of artificial fat, but otherwise, make it just as written. Reminds me so much of my grandmother’s dumplings!

Just made a half-size recipe for chicken noodle soup for one.  I took another reviewer's advice and cooked covered, with the soup simmering, for 10 minutes.  Then I turned off the burner and left it covered for another 10 minutes.  Perfect!  Will make this again, very soon.

I make this almost every week. It's a great alternative to pasta or bread. The key is really cutting the butter into the dry ingredients. Drop these into your perfectly seasoned broth by the tablespoon. Any larger and they may not cook evenly. If you don't cut the butter properly, like some have said, the dumplings aren't very good. If you prefer herbed flavor, try adding thyme or rosemary into the dry ingredients. A pinch goes a long ways!

These are truly delicious, and they're just like biscuits. We have them regularly in my household. They're light and tasty. I sometimes like to add parsley, garlic, or even some cheese!

Hard to rate this recipe as is since I modified it based on my lack of shortening. I used three tablespoons of butter instead and maybe a 1/4 cup of milk (I eyeballed it as I was looking for the right consistency). I cooked them in slightly salted vegetable broth for 6-7 minutes and they came out good. Ate them with part of my turkey stew. Hubby loved them.

I lost my mom's recipe for dumplings and tried this....it delivered! The same melt in your mouth wonderfulness of comfort. I used the recipe as written and just added a little freshly ground black pepper at the end as a topping. I used them on creamy chicken stew. I am married to a Jamaican, and after 15 years of his hard dumplings, it was heaven to come back to these little clouds of dumplings like mom used to make! This recipe is a keeper!

Great dumplings just like Mom used to make.  The only thing I change is I substitute butter for the shortening but other than that it is perfect and super simple.  The only problem with these dumplings is I always have to double or triple the recipe cause my guys can't get enough of them.

I have tried and tried to make good dumplings, like my mom made when I was a child. I have never been able to do it. This recipe is awesome!
I did sift all of the dry ingredients, before mixing the rest of it. I also added some parsley, just before they were done.
Perfect!!Thank you!! Yum!

This is as easy as any boxed mix.  I used butter instead of shortening.  they were great in my chicken and dumplings.

I cooked chicken yesterday and discovered I was out of Bisquick. I used this recipe and we loved it. My husband ate more for his breakfast this morning! I will hang onto this one! Thanks. MP

I used butter instead of shortening (personal taste), but these dumplings are pure heaven. I cover the whole top of the roaster with them then brush them with rendered butter once the tops firm up. Thank you Zen K for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

Very good. I use this as my go-to recipe for dumplings. I do however, add an egg to help keep them together. Otherwise they tend to dissolve away in my chicken and dumplings.

This is really good, but I use an easier way to make dumplings. I  use Pillsbury biscuits that come 4 cans to the package. Just tear them into small pieces and drop them into the boiling liquid as you tear them. So easy and so good!

Made these for chicken and dumplings (as I didn't want to use biscuit mix like the chicken and dumpling recipe suggested), and these turned out extremely well. They're also really easy to make. I will definitely be keeping this around as the go-to dumpling recipe around here! They worked with that recipe, and would work well in pretty much any stew recipe you might want dumplings for.

These dumplings tasted great and were extremely easy to make. I used them in my chicken stew last night and they came out so fluffy. I did follow the suggestions of the some other reviewers and used butter instead of shortening, added some black pepper as well as I cooked it covered on a low simmer for 20 minutes. My family really loved these and this will now be my new go to recipe for dumplings

This is the dumpling recipe I've always used, it's also in the old Betty Crocker cookbook. You can't go wrong with it, so good on beef soup/stew on a chilly fall evening!

This was very simple and tasted like Bisquick dumplings. Will make this one again!
