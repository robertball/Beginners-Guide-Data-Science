I love English muffins and I love fruit and yogurt but this combination just didn't do it for me. I used vanilla yogurt and fresh pineapple along with the fresh strawberries. It's not bad for breakfast, but I think I'd stick with having these items separate.

You could use pineapple flavored cream cheese instead of the yogurt.... My 3yr old didn't eat the english muffin.. just the fruit off the top...

What an easy, new twist to breakfast.  I used strawberry yogurt instead of pineapple yogurt.  Honestly, I'm a cream cheese fan so I think I prefer using different flavors of that BUT the yogurt is good too...a nice change. I also added a couple slices of bananna but then again, I think you could use a variety of different fruits if your willing to experiment. Thanks Joan!

These were awesome!  I wouldn't change a thing!  I served it with dinner as sort of a dessert item, but think it would be even better for brunch or lunch, especially on a hot day!  Thanks, Joan!!

The texture of the english muffin just doesn't mix well with the fruit and yogurt. Better off having fruit and yogurt.

Yum.  I like the flavor combo in this along with the crunchiness of a toasted english muffin. Would be a good topping for waffles or pancakes, too.  Such a simple idea but very tasty.  I have fresh pineapple so I just used that, and no pineapple yogurt--used strawberry instead.  Would be good with vanilla yogurt as well, which I have too.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a nice little snack and helps me get some fruit into my diet!
