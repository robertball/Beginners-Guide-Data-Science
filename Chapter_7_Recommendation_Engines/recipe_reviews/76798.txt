it was a very strange substance.  extremely strong and didn't have any caramel taste to it at all.  I was expect something more sweet than strong...definatly something to be drinking if you were looking to get buzzed not a social drink.

How can this be called a caramel martini when the only caramel is on the glass, not mixed in the drink?  This is really not very good, and we won't make them again.

It does not have a caramel taste because the vanilla vodka dominates.  the correct way should go as follows:  

Caramel apple martini:
1 granny smith apple sliced paper thin - float in marting glass.
1 martini shaker
2 jiggers premium vodka
2 jiggers vanilla vodka 
1.5 jigger butter schnapps 
1/2 jigger apple pucker
1 jigger cranberry juice

always taste before serving and adjust flavors to your liking. 

if you want a sugar rim i recommend melting a few carmels, ligtly dip your martini glass in the caramel sauce and than dip in sugar or splenda.

i actually liked this.  it looks cloudy, so it's not super pretty, and i was hesitant about the tea, and really, the whole recipe, after reading the reviews..  having said that, it actually tastes good, and i'm not a real "hard liquor" person.

Too strong.  Won't make again.  It might be better if you use equal amounts of vodka and butterscotch schnapps and maybe double the amount of iced tea.

a MUCH better recipe uses Caramel Kissed Vodka, Baileys Irish Cream - Caramel flavored, and the Caramel Ice Cream Topping - mix as above and pour. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!

I had this in a bar but they called it "sugar cookie martini" not caramel and it didn't have the caramel sauce.  I liked it though.
