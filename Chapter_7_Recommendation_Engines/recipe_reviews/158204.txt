This is my own recipe and I do want to say that the reason why I posted this was because of all the compliments I got after making this for many people. I would definitely say this is a good chicken recipe to serve when you have alot of people who are going to eat. Its a good finger food.

I used the seasonings to a T and marinated for 24 hours. Then, in an attempt to make this healthier, I grilled them instead of the flour and frying them. Not exactly chicharrones anymore, but the flavor was still great.

The 1/2 cup minced garlic made me doubtful! But I made it because this was a food I enjoyed in Dominican Republic  - great beach food, & great for a late night snack  on the "Malecon" (main road along the ocean)! I followed it exactly except I made up a version of the Goya Sazon seasoning based on its label's ingredients. (I love Goya's products, but their Sazon is mostly MSG, salt & artificial colorants!!)  I WILL make it again, next time with Sazon,  & I WILL update this review with the results ~ & hopefully give it more stars. (To those concerned about the rum in this, know that recipes having alcohol which are then cooked means the alcohol will evaporate.) UPDATE: I made this a 2nd time, exactly as written, using Goya's Sazon this time & Daisy Martinez' Dry Adobo seasoning blend (from another site) - except I did let it marinate about 20 hours. The 2-inch chunks were fried at 300 F for 3 minutes. When eaten freshly hot, it was steamy & the rum's flavor was obvious, but the garlic was not overwhelming. We did prefer it at room temperature. It is very tasty in its own right, but tasted nothing at all like all the Chicharrones de Pollo I had in Dominican Rep. The only similarity was the fried flour coating, but I remember a thicker & seasoned coating, so try some chunks double dipped in seasoned flour. Even though Dom. Rep. is a rum producer, I know they don't use rum in the Chicharrones' marinade. I'll still give this 4-1/2 stars, as it was very tasty in its own right.

I made this recipe last night for my 3 roommates and they loved it! It was great! Next time i make it i might use a little less rum but it was delicious nonetheless!! I made white rice with it and boiled it in chicken broth instead of water....added a lot of flavor! Thanks for the recipe :)

Really good stuff. A different twist on fried chicken. I'm new to this type of cooking, but really liked this.

This recipe was SO good, thanks so much for sharing! I only had time to marinate it for about 1.5 hours, it turned out delicious!

I did the recipe, step by step and did not come out as expected.  The only way I was able to enhance the flavour was with Lime (lots of it).

I made the recipe exactly as specified since it was my first time making it minus the goya sazon.  I made my own sazon (ground coriander, ground annato, salt, garlic powder, ground cumin, onion powder) since I can't have msg, but this turned out to be quite delicious.  The chicken came out so crunchy yet tender which was perfect.  Since I live in NYC and grew up around Dominicans, I disagree with the review which disclaims this recipe as not truly Dominican.  This recipe tastes very authentic to me, although I do recognize that there are many variations for the chicharrones de Pollo recipe from my experience.  Save a restaurant quality recipe, this is definitely one of the better versions I've had.

My family gobbled this up - including my boyfriend who is Dominican and normally hates fried chicken. I followed the recipe exactly (except I was out of adobo so used garlic salt instead). Next time I'll probably add some seasoning to the breading and marinate the chicken for longer.

I have never had Dominican food before but was looking for a Spanish Chicken recipe to serve with Spanish Rice and Tostones.This was so good and different.My family of 5 ate it all up and they are usually kinda picky.I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have Corn Oil so used Vegetable Oil for frying instead.Thanks so much for sharing!

Used Bacardi Limon instead of rum and then squeezed some lemon on top. Loved it!!! Fried it in deep fryer.

Tasted ok... But being born and raised for a good part of my life in the DR, I will say with 100% certainty, Dominicans back home do NOT ever add Rum to the chicharrones! and I mean EVER!  we do have some of the best rum, but we just do not add to this dish
