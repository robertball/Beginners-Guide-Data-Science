Great flavor and easy to make.  I made just half of the marinade recipe and then used only half of that to marinate chicken (so 1/4  of original recipe).  Place the remaining 1/4 recipe   Of marinate in a sauce pan and simmer to reduce .   Dissolve 1 1/2teaspoons of cornstarch  in  1 Tablespoon of water; stir into sauce, bring  it to a boil and stir until thickened. Serve  Chicken  over basmati rice, drizzle with sauce and sprinkle with toasted sliced almonds and coconut .
(Since I only used half of a can of coconut milk for the marinate, I had plenty to use for the rice - just replace equal amounts of water with the coconut milk)

This was really, really good.  The first time I made half the marinade and used the full amount of thighs.  I made it again tonight with thighs and breasts.  I use the remaining half of the coconut milk for the rice.

The marinade was ok.  Traditional shoyu chicken does not use coconut milk. It congealed when boiled. So I ditched the marinade sauce and used traditional marginal in a 4 inch deep skillet with a lid. Just as tender. You can decrease shoyu and sugar and come out with just as food of an effect. I used more sliced ginger. Was not impressed with this recipe.

Definitely makes a lot of marinade - could easily get away with half. But the recipe was tasty! I like what the other person recommended: saving some marinade, adding a little corn starch and reducing on the stove to thicken the sauce.

First off, there is way too much marinade and I even cut it in half.   Personally, there is too much soy sauce as it was the predominant flavour - couldn't taste the chicken.  I used breasts and cooked in the oven at 375 for about 30 minutes.

I really liked this recipe. My boyfriend and I both did. It's not something we would add to our regular rotation but for a treat it's great. A little too sweet for me  on a regular basis. Yummy!
