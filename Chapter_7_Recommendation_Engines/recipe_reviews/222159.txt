Maybe Scott's limes are drier than mine but 6 limes to 3 large tomatoes is way over the top for us.  I added a finely diced jalapeno, which the recipe does not call for.    This could easily be adjusted and is similar to the way I usually make Pico de Gallo but as written, it isn't for us.  Thanks though.

"Make it look like the flag of Mexico" I was taught.  Excellent recipe.  It is made hundreds of times each day for the family tables and Mexican food restaurants of south Texas.  Some thoughts about the pica (bite)--add finely
chopped, seeded jalapeno or serrano or can also leave recipe as is but add a spoonful or two of a picante sauce, Pace--made in San Antonio--is excellent.    To make true Texas style--make plenty--you'll need to taste to add the chile you want. Allow it to sit so flavors can marry. Buen provecho.

This was great!  I would prefer jalapenos but for non spicy lovers...perfect :) Served on top of refried bean and chicken nachos.

I realized if I followed the recipe I’d have a ton of pico de gallo! As it’s just me, I chopped up 2 tomatoes, 3/4 of an onion, half a bunch of cilantro and squeezed two limes. Delicious!! And it’ll still last me for days!

When it comes to pico de gallo, I'm a purist. I love the slight crunch from the onions and jalapenos, and the tangy lime notes, so I appreciate the fact this recipe doesn't include additional spices such as garlic or cumin (although if you love them in your pico, add them!) This a great base recipe to make as written, or to tweak depending on your tastes. I'm a taster cook, so I use what looks right and go from there. If 6 limes seem like too many, try 2 or 3 and add from there. You can't go wrong with pico, however you like it! This one's a keeper for me!

But I'd like to address the lime issue. I bet Scott used Mexican limes. They are really small, like half the size or smaller of a regular lime. That would explain the large quantity. Thanks, Scott.

This was great just as it's written. The only change I had to make was using concentrated lime because I was out of limes. Fabulous!

When I made it as written, it was too juicy.  I drained it before serving.  Might be the salt is taking the liquid out of the tomatoes.  So if I make again, I will leave the salt til just before serving and I will add a bit of garlic.  Nice starting place for individual tweaking.

This basic Pico recipe is exactly what I needed.   My wife and daughter both loved it.  It turned my nachos into the best I had ever made.

I only added 1 lime juiced and I only salt to taste. 6 limes was way too strong and citrusy. Everyone loves when I make this. My Dad even tops his pizza with it. I use roma tomatoes and vadilla onions. This is a crowd pleaser!

This was amazing! I made it to put on carnitas and it made the entire dish. Even my husband, who hates cilantro and typically won't even try anything within 5 feet of cilantro, absolutely loved this pico. He was even telling his friends about it! lol

Definitely a recipe to keep, however I cut down on the lime and added some Jalopeno for some heat. Turn out well!

An easy, tasty recipe, though I do agree if I had used the directed amount  of limes it would have been WAY too much. A great quick recipe, just don't be a stickler for precise measurements - adjust things to personal preferences. Even so, a great recipe.

very easy to make, just the right amount of kick. the only thing I'd change is the amount of lime.  recipe called for 6 limes and I only had 4, and that was good, but still a little much.  Maybe 3 next time.   another keeper....

I  used 5 limes, roma tomatoes and half a bunch of cilantro( ~ 1/2 cup when chopped).  Something was missing and it wasn't the lime. I added 1 tbs of vinegar, 2 tsp of sugar, and a finely chopped  jap.  It was perfect after that!!! This is my new go to recipe for Pico.

Nice & Simple. I added extra tomatoes & still found the quantity of lime juice to be overbearing. Next time I will use 4 as well as add a jalapeño or two.

Add the lime juice 1 tablespoon at a time. 3-4 Tbs (1-1/2 limes) was good for me. 6 limes and I think I would have irreversibly puckered inside out. I did add 1 seeded & stemmed jalapeno.

I made this using 2 Tablespoons of lime and it was delicious. I'm not sure how big a typical bunch of cilantro is but I think I used too much. I will make this again using less.

Okay I have to admit we loved this pico but I didn't come anywhere near close to using 6 limes for juice. I used one and that was good for us when tasted but thats really a matter of personal taste. I can't imagine 6 limes ever working for whats called for here but start with 1 and work your way up from there for your own perfect taste.

This Pico was awesome when put on Black Bean and Rice Burritos!!! As a chips and salsa style Pico, though, it was too limey for my family's taste.
