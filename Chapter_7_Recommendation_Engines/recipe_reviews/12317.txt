This pie was fantastic! We used frozen berries and I knew that I would need more cornstarch.  I used about 3 tablespoons.  I was unsure of the brown sugar as I have always used regular sugar.  It was great!  We have our own crust recipe that we used.  Cannot wait to make it again!

I love this website and this recipe! The only thing i did differently in this recipe was mix honey with the remainder of the egg white and use it to glaze the top of the pie to give it that nice flaky give. Thanks!

This was a great, simple pie.  Next time I will use a little less sugar, I found that sugar over powered the tast of the raspberries.  Other than that it was great.

This was delicious!  I liked the brown sugar with the raspberries.  Everyone ate it up! I had a ten inch pie shell, so I doubled the recipe and used 3 tablespoons of flour instead of the corn starch (I don't like the cornstarch taste).  It was perfect.  Don't use frozen, grocery store, freezer section berries for this recipe.  They are too moist, you don't want to use raspberries frozen in a solid block, not good for pies.  Make this pie with fresh berries, when they are in season. Or use your carefully home frozen, fresh picked berries (Freeze fresh berries on a cookie sheet and transfer to a freezer bag after they are frozen, Do this within a day, don't freezer burn the berries.  This way you don't have a big nasty frozen block of berries:)  Good old fashioned recipe, will make again!

Excellent!  And lower in fat than many of the other raspberry pies listed.  Thanks! Even works great when you simply buy the pre-made pie shell crusts in the frozen section of the grocery.

YUM! And I hate berry pies! I had never made a pie before since I don't like them (was for the fianc√©) and I was able to make this easily! I used 2 1/2 cups frozen blackberries and 1/2 cup frozen raspberries because I am a college student on tight funds. Still yummy! I would add a bit more corn starch if using the frozen berries since they have more water, but still just great! I used it with the Basic Flaky Crust Recipe on this site. Highly recommended!

I dug through the snow up here and found some raspberries to make this berry, berry good pie, eh.  Like, it was easy to make and lower in fat than others.  Suprisingly good with a slice of Canadian cheddar, eh.

This is the first raspberry pie I have ever made and I thought it was good.  I think I could have used another cup or two of raspberries and gotten away with it, though.  My husband is the one who requested it and he certainly liked it.

A disaster. It was like a soup inside. Completely liquid. I followed the directions exactly. I don't know what went wrong. I think the temperature (400) may have been too high - at that level, I think the berries probably quickly liquified. And I did cut several slits in the top crust to let steam escape. Maybe you should mix the berries with the sugar and corn starch in a bowl first so the corn starch can actually work and hold the filling together. Really, it was a waste of the berries that I picked.

Wow! i am a very accomplished cook, but i really dont' bake so much - this was the classic 'less is more' recipe --- and wow, it was GREAT!!!! It is my first raspberry pie, based on a mega amount of fresh berries in my back yard --- i increased the corn starch to 3 teaspoons - it seemed good. the problem with this recipe is that 2-1/2 cups is NOT enough berries - i used almost 5 cups and that filled the pie shell - otherwise it would have been droppy. i didnt' increase the sugar - so next time i might add a few more tablespoons.  It was PERFECT other wise. took about 10 more minutes to cook then was stated, and i used foil to keep the edges from burning, WOW!!! thank you for an easy delish recipe, worthy of 10 stars! MMMMMM

This was so simple yet delicious!  I will definitely make this again.  The brown sugar in this was really good.

I made it with frozen berries (raspberries and blackberries) and took the advice of using 3 tbs of corn starch, which worked out well.  I would put in about 3 cups of berries though because they settled as the cooked and I ended up with a half-full pie.  It also took a little longer to bake because it started out cold.

So easy to make, but still really yummy!  I wish I had known it was so easy to make a homemade berry pie.  Also, it was healthier than some of the other recipes.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it was a little watery--another tsp or 2 of cornstarch should do the trick! Thanks for the great recipe. :)

Can't even begin to describe how good this pie is. First one I've ever made and it turned out great. Used half raspberries and half blackberries, both fresh. Amazing!

Pretty good pie! I used frozen raspberries, so I KNOW the flavor was not as good as it would have been had I used fresh berries... thats my fault! However, the filling thickened up nicely. I was surprised since the frozen berries were pretty watery. I did use 3 tbsp of cornstarch as suggested by another reviewer and let it sit for 2 hours after it came out of the oven. I also felt that I needed extra berries - again, maybe just because I used frozen instead of fresh and they aren't as plump. All in all, a very good recipe, very easy, good mixture of ingrediants. I will make it again, but I will use fresh next time! Thanks!

I made this recipe awhile ago and thought it needed more brown sugar so this time I added a cup instead of half a cup. It was great! The reader that said it was too sweet must have sweeter berries than I do. :o)

This is a great tasting pie and very simple to make.  Next time I would use 2 or 3 tsp. of cornstarch as 2 was a bit on the runny side.  I used fresh raspberries.

This was the first time I've made a Raspberry pie and I think mine turned out awesome!  I had read a couple of the other reviews so I made some changes to the recipe and I think they turned out well.  First off, I used frozen but I thawed them first.  I ended up not having enough raspberries in the one package but I had some strawberries so I used about 1 1/2 cups of raspberries and 1 cup strawberries (I also drained as much of the juice off that I could since some had said it could end up being soupy).  I also mixed the berries in a bowl with the 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 3 teaspoons of cornstarch (not 1 teaspoon).  I forgot to add the butter and I think my pie was excellent without it so I'm going to eliminate it all together.  After adding the top crust I dusted it with a little bit of white sugar.  I think it worked out and I would recommend this recipe!

This recipe was great!!! It even worked well with a gluten free pie crust! I used 3 tsp of starch like the reviews said and i took the pie out of the oven 10 minutes early cause it was looking a little too golden, but it worked out perfectly. delicious!

This is a great pie.  It tastes just like a raspberry pie should.  Raspberriey.  Beautiful and simple.  Love it.  I would suggest that the crust needs to be a nice flakey number, not one available in a box.  Never use those horrid things...

If you like eating your pie with a spoon go for it! It is a juciy mess! I do like the idea of brown sugar. The flavor was good but it needed way more cornstarch!

FANTASTIC!  Even with store-bought crusts and Sam's Club berries on special, this was an amazing pie.  We kept sugar a bit low, but otherwise did this exactly as written.  Wonderful!

WAAAY to sour. We all took one bite & puckered up! maybe because i used raspberries picked  were from the backyard, but they were definatly ripe.. i ended up putting sugar & powdered sugar on top, then it was ok. Also, very very runny. Should have added tapioca to the mix to help make it firmer. but .. it was an easy recipe!

I loved the ease of this recipe - was worried maybe it was too easy but my worries were quickly dismissed! This pie is delicious! I added a bit more corn starch after reading all the reviews and it was perfect! it will be a hit for the holidays!

This is a delicious recipe! I used frozen raspberries and increased the cornstarch to 1 T. and it worked well. It's important to note to adjust the sugar to the tartness of your berries.

Couldn't be easier, especially with premade crust.  I have to agree that this pie is AMAZING after it has refrigerated over night.  I have to eat it with ice cream when it is hot out of the oven, but the next day, I couldn't keep my fingers out of it.  Raspberries seem to do much better with the brown sugar.

The flavor is good. Be warned, though, that with about 20 minutes of cooking time left, I had to pull it out and cover the edges with foil to prevent the crust from becoming too done. In addition, I used a few Tbs of flour instead of corn starch (I'm just not thrilled with CS), and it did come out a bit soupy. However, we enjoyed it because we served it over ice cream; it was like raspberry topping with crust bits. Very flavorful, and I'll make it again!

This pie looked great when I took it out of the oven, but when I cut into it, it was just a soupy mess. And that was even after I doubled the cornstarch and let it rest on the counter a while. It was also a bit too tart, it was better after sprinkling some sugar on top. I would not make this pie again.

This pie was wonderful.  I made the Better Homes and Garden double pastry crust for it, and it was so good and flaky.  I dont like raspberries, but it was all I had around the house to make a dessert with and even I wanted seconds of it!

Taste wise, this pie was quite good. However, the inside was so soupy and runny that I ended up having to scoop it out of the pie plate with a ladle. I used a swirled top crust, so I know that there was adequate space for steam to escape. Not sure why it turned out this way. But, all in all, the pie was alright. I might make it again, but if I do I will use more cornstarch.

I made this for my brother and took the advise of others and used 3t of cornstarch.  It smelled wonderful and with a top crust looked wonderful.  When my brother cut into it it was like soup!  Did not thicken what-so-ever.  He did say the taste was amazing.  If anyone has any other suggestions on how to thicken this pie it would be greatly appreciated.

This was a good pie, and very easy! I did-however-make a few changes. Instead of 1 teaspoon of cornstarch I did 2 Tablespoons of flour. I also brushed the bottom pie crust with egg white AND the top of my lattice top, and sprinkled sugar on top. I will definitely make it again!

Very good, but personally I like straw-rhubarb and apple better.  Just my taste.  I did mix the berries with the other ingredients and cooked at 350 not 400.  Used 3 T flour.  Came out Perfect!

I made this recipe using almost 3 cups of fresh raspberries and thought it came out pretty tart.  I did not mind so much but other people thought it was almost too bitter.  Maybe I should use more sugar, or white sugar next time instead.  Or maybe they just don't really like raspberry pie that much.  Anyways,  the consistency was great and it baked up fine and looked wonderful, just wasn't sweet enough for the masses.

I've made this pie several times and it always turns out fantastic. Like others, I increased the corn starch from 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon. And instead of a crust, I make a crumble top. I also increased the berries to 3 cups.

I've made this twice. First time with fresh berries   was perfect.  Second time with frozen berries I added a tablespoon of corn starch. It wasn't enough. Pie had too much liquid but still very good.

Easy enough to  make, but like everyone else said, not enough berries and too soupy.  I light of that, I made it again with 4 cups of berries, 1/4 c. brown sugar and 3/4 c. sugar, with 3 T. of cornstarch.  Still too liquidy, but it was better.  Also baked entire time at 400.  This recipe needs some modifications.

I made this pie with fresh Raspberries from our garden. Followed the recipe exactly. The pie looked beautiful, smelled great, and I had high hopes for it. It was the first Raspberry pie I'd ever made.  Unfortunately, was very disappointed.  The flavors were very good - the Raspberries shown and it was just enough sweet/tart for us. But as some other bakers/reviewers have written, it was like soup! My husband was really looking forward to a piece of pie, and I, instead had to serve this in a bowl, and even then it didn't hold up as a cobbler might. It was just JUICE.  Had to use a ladle to dish it up. Potentially really good recipe BUT ABSOLUTELY NEEDS MORE CORN STARCH!!! Very disappointing effort this holiday weekend.
