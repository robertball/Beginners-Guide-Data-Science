I went out to the garden to get fresh rosemary. This is the first time I have planted it or used it in a recipe. I must admit, when chopping, it is very fragrant. I must admit, I really loved this dish. I did use Bow Tie pasta also. If your onions didn't turn out you may have under-cooked them. If your cheese clumped or got stringy, you didn't stir it in fast enough. Also, adding the cheese should be done after pulling off the heat.

This was FANTASTIC.  I followed the recipie but used soy butter instead of real butter(my daughter has food allergies), dried rosemary instead of fresh and bow tie pasta. When I was making the sauce I thought I may have used too much garlic and then I thought the sauce would be too runny but when I mixed it with the pasta, everything was perfect!  NO LEFTOVERS!!!

I  loved this!  Easy to make a lot of it at once and very tasty.  My boyfriend and his roommate really liked it!  I used dried rosemary though and would use fresh next time.  I also added some fresh oregano and parsley. If you wanted to make a lighter version, I felt the last two tablespoons of butter were unnecessary as the mixture of onions and stuff was enough to fully coat the spaghetti.  I'll try wil olive oil next time too.

This recipe was a huge hit! My friends said it was restaurant quality! I did change a few things thought. I used garlic powder instead of cloves and it turned out fine. I also added chicken. I cut it up into bite sized pieces and cooked it most of the way through, then added it when I added the chicken broth (I used canned Swansons-I'm such a cheater!)

Definitely tasty and easy to make! I prepared as written with two additions: 1.)I added about 1.5 lbs chicken breast. I diced it and rubbed it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I added the chicken with the stock and rosemary. 2.) I added about a tablespoon of lemon juice as the sauce was reducing, which really rounded out the flavor! The dish was very rich and enjoyable, but I would agree that it doesn't translate well to leftovers, so make it when it can all be eaten in one sitting.

This is a very simple, delicious recipe. Tastes great with added sauteed mushrooms and topped with fresh diced tomatoes.

This was good, but not fantastically good.  I added an extra clove of garlic, halved grape tomatoes, and a splash of white wine.  Quick and easy, great rosemary taste.  I'd make it again, and judging by my husband's FOUR servings, he'd like it again.

This is good but I felt it needed something.  So I added lemon zest and lemon juice. That is what it needed. Delicious! Garlic, Rosemary and Lemon...yummy!

Not only does it taste good, but it smells amazing while cooking. My husband's band member's kept commenting on the good smells coming from the kitchen. One tip though, only make what you can eat in one sitting. The pasta dries out quite quickly, which bothered me when eating as leftovers..

This was very good, however I don't recommend halfing the complete recipe.  I did, and ended up having to add more broth because it completely disappeared.  Thank you for sharing, this is a keeper!

HMMMMM. Fantastic. I added broccoli, artichoke hearts and baby bella mushrooms. Seasoned with Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb. Used Barilla Plus elbows instead of spaghetti. Served with roasted pork tenderloin. Dad ate Three Helpings! Glad I could make his tummy happy after coming over to help me with chores. Next time I need to make sure to grate the Parmesan finer, the larger grate (from the salad shooter) ended up clumping together somewhat.

We did not like this.  I followed the directions exactly, but I think the amount of rosemary was too much!

I know everyone hates when you change a recipe and review it, so I will review the sauce first. The sauce is so good on pasta. so what I did to make this a hearty meal, first I cut 3 bonless chicken breat halves into strips, then coated them in  seasoned flour and cooked them in a skillet with olive oil. I boiled a pot of water and used ziti instead of spaghetti, I cooked some fresh broccoli in the same pot at thesame time the ziti was cooking. when everything was done, I mixed it all together.  Yumm! beats any restaurant chicken broccoli ziti dish!

The most delicious pasta ~ i know I will be making this again and again.  I did not have any rosemary either fresh or dried so I used Italian herbs.  Followed the rest of recipe exactly.  Turned out perfect, I served this with the Slow cooker Chicken Stroganoff off this site.

This recipe was a huge hit when I cooked it for my family. Everyone was so tired of the old Pasta and Tomato sauce. I'm glad I tried this recipe. It is one of my favorites! I recommend this recipe to anyone looking to spice up their pasta dishes.

Absolutely wonderful! Two tips, do NOT use dried rosemary, I did the first time I made this it was not nearly as good. And don't use a garlic press definitely chop the garlic.

I heeded the warnings from other reviewers about blandness and so used the full amount of rosemary.  I love rosemary, but this was way too much. Not only was the taste overpowering, but it affected the texture as well!  I used 3/4 cup chicken stock plus 1/4 cup white wine as well as a splash of lemon juice and the sauce taste was good, notwithstanding the rosemary!

This was a wonderful recipe! I used rosemary straigt from my garden and added chicken and it turned out great.  My dad, who doesn't even like spagghetti had thirds!  Everybody in my family loved it.  I would suggest turning the heat up to medium when cooking the onion since they don't brown at low heat.

This was excellent and rated by my wife as a definite "do again"!  The only variation from the recipe I made was to use 1 tsp SuperiorTaste's "Better than Bullion" chicken stock paste with a cup of water from the pasta when it was about half way done to make the stock.  This is a little trick I learned that makes the sauce better adhere to the pasta.  Great Recipe!

Okay I thought I was at Brio!  This was easy and super quick.  I didn't have the rosemary so I used dried thyme, basil and sage.  I also made sauteed chicken breast, as my husband is a meat eater.  He loved it and so did my 3 year old son.  I could have easily had this alone as a meal.  I gave this five stars because it was quick and delicious!  I will make this over and over!

Based on all the excellent reviews, I was expecting so much more from this dish.  It was just good, as in good for the family, but I'd go with something else for a "company worthy" meal.

As the recipe submitter, I would like to point out that the amount of pasta called for in this recipe is incorrect. The correct amount is 8 oz, not 16. Try it with half the amount - I'm sure you will love it as much as we do.

I made 1/2 the recipe because it's only me. I pretty much followed as written (1/2 portion) except I added some precooked shrimp and blanched asparagus. Well it was an OMG meal! I love rosemary but usually with chicken or roasted vegetables and I wasn't sure I would like it in a pasta dish--well not only did I like it, I could not stop eating it! It will now forever compete with my favorite penne pasta pesto dishes! Thanks for posting!

This was great, and quick and easy.  I didn't find the 2 Tablespoons of rosemary overwhelming, the only reason I'm giving it four stars is because it could have done with a tablespoon or two less butter, it started to get a little greasy.

I love this recipe. Yes, I did add a little more garlic. I did heed the warnings about less rosemary, about 1/2 a tsp. I added some salt and pepper with chicken. And it definately good!

This dish was SO easy to make and SO yummy to eat!  It a huge hit with my fiance and he is incredibly picky.  I added a splash of lemon juice to the sauce and it gave it a nice, refreshing twist.  This recipe will become a regular in my house!

Good and easy. I like the idea of replacing the butter with soy sauce, I'll try it next time.

This was really good. I used whole wheat pasta, used only about a TBSP. of fresh rosemary, should diffently use 2 TBSP. I'll diffently make this again.

if you like Olive Garden's chicken scampy dish try this: cook marinated chunked chicken breast (2 breasts) in skillet until brown. set aside. make this sauce as directed in the same pan the chicken was in but instead of rosemary use a teeny tiny pinch of basil. just before you take the sauce off the stove toss in about 1/4 to 1/3 of a green pepper sliced in 1 in slices and your chicken. cook for a couple minutes to tenderize the peppers and then put on your pasta and toss together. SO GOOD!!!

I love this recipe; it's a great base. I'm usually only cooking for myself so I halve the recipe, use vegetable stock instead of chicken to make it vegetarian, and add a little lemon juice to the sauce. Lovely and easy.

I won't be making this again. Knowing that people can be quite critical, I decided to try it based on the majority, but I'm sorry that I did. I always try to be kind with my reviews, but I just can't with this one.

This was just OK.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken stock to make it vegetarian, and I also had to omit the rosemary since I didn't have any.  The dish looked very blah.  I added some cut tomatoes on top for some color, and I wished I'd had some broccoli or something.  We couldn't even taste the garlic.  The only flavor came from the cheese.  Next time, I'll quadruple the garlic.

Loved this recipe, we were in Mexico and cooking for ourselves, but it is difficult to find familiar ingredients! this recipe fit the bill as we could get everything we needed at the local market. I can't wait to make it at home now!

Simple and delicious. We used fresh Rosemary pasta and added chicken and broccoli as suggested by others. Did not have to deal with the rosemary amount (that others speak about being too much). I added very little since I had the Rosemary flavored fresh pasta.

I added roasted garlic along with all the other good stuff,and it just gave it an even garlickier taste, which we loved. I also added some lemon juice as another reviewer suggested. Really Really good.

I cut down the recipe to 4 for my boyfriend and I (so we could have leftovers) and there's NOTHING I would change about this. Well, I did add oregano...but you don't have too. We just like it. This was beyond delicious.

This was good but needed a lot of added seasoning...salt and pepper and definately more garlic.  I used less rosemary as someone stated we should do...but if you like bold and strong flavors as I do...LEAVE IT IN!!!

I LOVED this, and I am a bit surprised by my own reaction because I usually don't like pastas like this without tomato sauce.  But it has a great combination of flavors--LOVE the rosemary.  I'd argue that it could use some more garlic, but I tend to want more garlic than called for in recipes anyway.  I subbed mozzarella for parmesan bc I don't have parmesan right now--but I think it would be a great addition.  Quick, easy, and excellent.  Thanks!

I scaled this down to 2 servings & Mandy Sue is right...if you scale it down, you will need more chicken broth than called for. For 2 servings, it called for 1/4 cup of broth & I used 1 full cup. I used roasted garlic (didn't add it until I added the broth & rosemary) & I just added sphaghetti until it was enough. This tasted very strongly of carmelized onions so if you don't love those (I do) then this dish is not for you. Topped it w/ additional parmesan. Thansk for a tasty lunch kelcampbell!

This is exactly what I was looking for!  I added some fresh basil and quartered cherry tomatoes at the end to give it color  and mixed it with cooked cheese tortellini.  My hubby and I loved it!  It was even better the next day because all the sauce soaked into the pasta.

Great flavor.  16 oz of spaghetti is way too much.  Next time will add chicken to give it a little more substance as a main dish.

This recipe is so tasty, and so easy to make. It's a good recipe for when the pantry is nearly empty, as it takes so few and simple ingredients. Ever since I found it here, I make it about once a week. My husband loves it too!

I used spaghetti since it's all I had but will use bow tie or ziti next time, loved it!! Which onions are best to use with this? I only had boiler onions and cooking with the garlic really stung my eyes.

I was looking for  a pasta recipe w garlic and rosemary and so came upon this one.  For some reason never use rosemary w pasta...Also wanted to use capers which I like w panko.   Being a veggie ...this what I did.  Steamed some broccoli 2min. and put aside.   Fried about 8 cloves of fresh garlic/thinly sliced..in EVOO...w the fresh rosemary more than 2 T...went to the garden to cut more...added some panko and capers.   Next added added some Trader Joe's Chicken-Less Strips  cut small and some  Earth Balance Organic Roasted  Garlic and Herb Butter (dairy free).  I liked the readers' comment to add some lemon zest and juice and finally the broccoli.   I realize technically changed the old recipe, but isn't that what cooking is all about...what you have and what you like...OOPS...since I had parsley and basil in the herb garden I added those since they are so good for you!   Rosemary is expensive where  I live so if it is not in my garden ...I would not use it.  For me all herbs need to be fresh.

We really like garlic, so I used about 14 cloves. Very glad I did, because I don't think the flavor would have been strong enough without the extra. This was so simple to prepare, using things I always have on hand. Very tasty and satisfying.

Really good.  Other than adjusting the recipe for only 2 servings,  I used dried rosemary.  I added the rosemary to the frying pan before the chicken stock till it got fragrant.  That helps with the flavor of a dried herb.  Will make again.

A little bit bland tasting.  I would cut back on the rosemary and only use 1 tablespoon.  It was okay.

I love how garlicy this is!!!! I use it atleast once a week, making adjustments to fit what pasta or herb i feel like using. My fav way is to cook chicken with the onions. I omit the rosemary and throw it all together with a spinach tortallini that I get from Trader Joes!

The sauce really needs the roasted garlic advertised in the recipe title.  Adding a bulb of roasted garlic saved this dish for us, but I'm only giving 2 stars for the recipe as written.

This is a keeper! I wanted a hardy side dish to go with steak so I added portabello mushrooms sliced fairly thick,and fresh broccoli in very small pieces. I incorporated these after doing the onion and garlic. We like onion so I used red onion and didn't slice it real tiny.  I substituted 1/4 of the chicken stock with white wine which I added a few minutes before the chicken stock. I used  whole wheat rotini instead of spagetti. The flavor was amazing and it was a great compliment to the steaks.

This is delicious, although it was very mild flavored and needed more salt. It is a nice option from traditional tomato sauce or meat pasta. I used fresh thyme because I had no fresh rosemary.

We made this as written and I'm taking it out of my recipe box.  The bland taste was only slightly masked by the bitterness from the rosemary.  Our parrots love pasta and they wouldn't even eat it.  They tossed it on the floor for the dogs to eat!

I liked it enough but hubby didn't care for it so it gets 4 stars. I don't think he is too keen on rosemary but maybe made with another herb would be good for him.

As I was making this, I thought it was going to turn out bland. WRONG! It popped with flavor.  It DOES, however, need fish or veggies of some sort.  I think next time I'll try it either with scallops or green peppers.    Oh, and it's incredibly easy to make!

Instead of chicken stock, I used white wine and added some extra garlic. My onions had gone bad so I had to use some minced onion and this recipe was still awesome.

I used dried rosemary, but next time will try fresh. I replaced half the butter with olive oil. Served with Sweet Potato Gnocchi from this site and it was a great combo.

This a great alternative to a red sauce.  As suggested I used it as a side for chicken marsala and it complimented it very well.  Chicken Marsala is a stronger tasting dish and this being a bit more mild worked very well.  Next I think I will increase the sauce by about a quarter but other than that wouldn't change a thing.

I didn't put as much rosemary as the recipe called for, I probably could have though.. It was good, I would have preferred it to be a little thicker however.. I also added sundried tomatoes! YUMMY!

If I had made this as written, it would have been a very boring side dish at best.  However, I added more garlic, some tomatoes, mushrooms, lemon juice, extra parmesan, and italian seasoning and my husband loved it.  The rosemary tasted great (I had to use dried).  I don't suggest making this as written unless you have picky kids who don't like vegetables. :)

I WAS LOOKING FOR A QUICK AND EASY RECIPE FOR DINNER AND I HAVE FOUND IT.  SO SIMPLE, THAT I CAN MAKE IT ON WEEK NIGHT.
I DID MAKE SOME ADDITIONS, I ADDED CHOPPED BROCCOLI, TOMATOES AND PEPPER FLAKES.
WAS A BIG HIT WITH MY HUSBAND.
WILL DEFINITELY BE MAKING THIS AGAIN.

Great as a side!  In order to make it a meal I sauteed some chicken in butter and onion powder, steamed some broccoli and carrots, and tossed it all into the pasta.  I made this for the in-laws and they devoured it.

It's just a matter of personal taste but I thought this pasta had way too much rosemary. It overpowered the dish. I used olive oil instead of butter which we enjoyed but if I make this again I will cut the rosemary by at least half.

This is a good base recipe and an excellent use of rosemary. Just add whatever veggies you're in the mood for, serve with a green salad, and you've got yourself a good weeknight dinner. I do agree with one reviewer's take on the leftovers, though. Either eat all of this in one sitting, or be prepared to add some olive oil when you reheat the leftovers.

The rosemary was overpowering. I might try making it again with a lot less rosemary.

This was good.  During cooking I realised I didn't have any chicken stock so I used vegetable stock instead.  Husband loved it (I added some prawns for him), my toddler and I had it plain.  I thought it was just okay - a good base but needs something more.  My toddler GOBBLED it up and asked for more and he never asks for more!!!

This was great. I used shells instead of spaghetti and cut the rosemary down to about half, (it can get to be too much for us), and it turned out awesome. My kids loved it and were asking to eat up the leftovers the next day.

Family liked it. I added asparagus, cooked chicken strips and called it a meal. Very easy and quick to make when you need dinner in a hurry. Will probably keep it as a rotation for meals with different veggies(red pepper, sugar snap peas, etc)

Whew, too much rosemary for me!  It was okay, I guess, but I probably won't make it again.

This was a great alternative to our normal tomato or garlic oil sauce.  I used scallions in place of onions and bowtie pasta.  The pasta held the sauce wonderfully!  Also instead of shredding the cheese I food processed it so it was chopped into small chunks rather than fine shreds.

This was an OK side dish.  A change from the buttered noodles, but not so different that kids won't eat it.  I liked the rosemary flavor.  There are better pasta recipes out there though.

Really great flavor - really enjoyed this dish even though I'm not a fan of onions.  Great over lingunie with some mushrooms!  Tastes like something you get at a restaurant. Thanks for sharing!

This was simple but went nicely with Chicken Marsala for a dinner party.  It's a nice alternative to plain pasta.

This stuff is amazing! It's good with whole wheat pasta, too. Make sure you don't use too much pasta, and use a bit less of whole wheat to let the flavor come through.

I don't cook with Rosemary often so I was suprised at how strong the flavor was. I found it very overpowering. I also didn't think the onions "meshed" well with the dish. It may have been b/c I used white onion but I probably woudn't make this again. It reminded me a bit of Mizithra noodles if you like those then you would like this recipe.

This dish was excellent, and my husband loved it too!  My stovetop tends to run a little hotter, so the only thing I will change next time is to start the pasta a little earlier, so as not to overdo the time on the sauce.  Thank you for posting such a wonderful recipe!

I am not a picky eater, generally I enjoy almost any food, but I can't agree with the other reviews for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and my onions did not brown at all, it was VERY greasy and the parmesan cheese just got lumpy. I also think that there was way too much pasta for the amount of sauce that it made. Maybe with some tweaking it could be a good meal, but I'm not sure.

Easy to make and tasted delicious.  Last time I made it I added some sliced chicken into the sauce as it reduced.  I'm going to try this again with some colored pasta for presentation, along with some canned button mushrooms.
