This was an outstanding recipe! Loved it, and next time will absolutely top it with a fried egg. I added shredded carrots to give it a tad more veggies. The sauce is perfect, as was the amount of kimchi to use. So easy & quick...your family will think you picked this up on the way home from work. Perfec weeknight meal or weekend lunch!

this is my new favorite quick dish! I also left out the Sriracha and bacon and added carrots. Fantastic dish!

Super quick and easy and very yummy! I used oil instead of bacon to make it vegetarian and sauteed some julienned carrots first for a couple of minutes. I also omitted the sriracha sauce like bliu suggested since the kimchi adds enough spice. Next time I'll probably add some more vegetables. Will definitely make again!

This was so easy to make! I skipped the sriracha sauce because I don't like spicy foods and thought the kimchi was enough. My husband liked it and he loves spicy foods and he didn't need to add hot sauce. This recipe was so flavorful and will definitely make it again. I think I will add extra veggies next time like carrots and/or maybe celery.

I cooked some chicken breast with the garlic before adding the noodles. I will stir fry a couple eggs in next time too.

Yummy and easy! I recommend going lighter on the sriracha if you have anyone in your family who likes less spice, then you can always add more to the individual dishes.
