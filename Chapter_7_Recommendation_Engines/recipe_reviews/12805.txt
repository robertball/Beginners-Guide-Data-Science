I fixed this for a husband who LOVES fish and two 8-year old picky eaters. There
were no leftovers! I served it with yellow rice and mixed vegetables. The whole 
meal was done and on the table in less than 30 minutes. At last, a great fish dish
that does not require dredging and deep frying fish. I just wish I could give it
more than a five card rating!

I made this last night and it was very good.  I used the remaining liquid  from the fish to make a sauce by adding a little cornstarch, milk and parmesan cheese.  It turned out suprisingly well. Thanks!

Couldn't be simpler. You really don't need anything else, though sometimes I like to add some salsa as a topping.   Works just as well with limes.

I rubbed the fish with EVOO and then coated with lemon pepper seasoning. Was not bland at all this way. Oh, and I baked it - 400 for 10 mins. Kids loved it (of course they though it was chicken)!

This was great fish.  I didn't not have a lemon so I used lemon juice.  I distributed 1 tbsp per piece of fish on each side.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable.  Will definitely make again.

I've made this twice in the last week. First time was as written, got rave reviews. The second time I used butter instead of oil, got even more raves. This dish is what I call 'stupid simple', and results in perfectly cooked, beautifully seasoned fish. DH wants it in my regular rotation. Great recipe!

Simple, basic, foolproof - and easily customizable.  I used lemon pepper plus a little bit of lemon juice. Everyone salted it on their plates for their own taste.  It is a simple recipe and helps people who have absolutely no experience with fish. Everyone can do it, so it is a solid, basic guideline and thus a good recipe. 5 stars!

Super easy and delicious, and works perfectly with any mild fish. I usually marinate the fish in lemon juice for about an hour for a little more flavor. It also doesn't hurt to top it with a bread crumb/Parmesan mixture then broil for a couple of minutes. Thanks!

I'm sure I'll make this again because it's so simple, and the taste is so simple my picky 7 year-old ate it.  It is somewhat bland, so I added a sprinkle of dried dill to it.  --update-- I make this a lot with both cod and tilapia. It's quick and tasty. I now use 1 T butter and 1 T veg oil. If I don't have lemon juice, I sprinkle on lemon pepper instead. It's great served with a pasta side dish and a veggie.

Very Good.  Incredibly simple.  It would be easy to tweak the flavor to exactly your liking.  Definetly give it a try.

Super simple and delicious. I use a little more lemon and pepper than the recipe calls for. When cod isn't available I use tilapia.

It was good - and super easy.  I used olive oil and lemon pepper in add'n to the other ingredients.  I will definitely make it again because I love to cook really healthy, easy options for dinner.

I don't usually care for fish, but between the mild flavor of fresh cod and the lemon, it was enjoyable. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and fresh cracked pepper from the grinder. We also squeezed half of a lemon each on top as we were eating.  1.1 lbs of Alaskan cod fed 2 of us perfectly.

Simple and easy, just the way cooking should be for a busy Mom. Real taste of white fish which is not too strong anyway. And I love the use of lemon. Will be recommended to others.

I thought this was really good.  I did add a little bit of garlic with parsley, and it turned out great!  I did not add the vegetable oil though.  Wanted to cut out some of the fat!  Thanks for the recipe.

We did not care for this recipe.  It was bland and the cod was tasteless. I even added lots of lemon pepper and some butter to the pan.

So simple and quick. The only change I made was to add a Tbsp or so of butter with the olive oil to enrich the flavour. Yum! With garlic mashed potatoes and a green salad a perfect meal.

This was very nice and subtle.  I wanted to eat fish and taste fish and that is what this recipe did for me, it seasoning did not overpower the fish.  Will make again.

This was soo easy and simple and the flavor was nice. I added some garlic salt with the pepper and it worked well. I loved it, but my daughter wasnt so sure.

I read all of previous notes stating that the fish turned out bland so I added a little paprika. I also didn't have enough lemon (only had 1/2 a lemon left) so I used some lemon pepper. It turned out really good! The cook time is perfect for this fish. I was a little worried I had underdone it but it was great.

Was looking for a simple recipe I could use to help clean out my parents' freezer. Made this recipe as is EXCEPT for adding a little garlic salt. Delicious, and sooo simple. I think next time I may try with lime juice just to compare.

What a great simple recipe.  I would add a pinch of salt to each filet, but that's me.  Don't skimp on the lemon juice.

My husband and I both thought this was okay, but not great.  My children each took one bite and refused to eat the rest.  I thought they would like it because lemon pepper tilapia and trout is their favorite meal and they eat as much of it as I can give to them.  This just didn't appeal that much to us.

This is only fair.  I added Parmesan cheese and more garlic, but it was still not anything exceptional.  I love codfish but this recipe is not the one.

This recipe looked perfect. Unfortunately I was in a hurry by the time I goofed around and read awhile and by that time I needed to eat right away! I preheated the oven to 375° F. Put cod (any fish will do) in pan that had been generously sprayed with regular Pam, seasoned fish with salt, pepper and lemon pepper then sprayed with Butter Pam and put in oven. When fish looked slightly brown on top, removed it, flipped fish and repeated seasoning. Put back in the oven and when the cod smelled extra good I took it out and ate nearly 5 ounces right out of the pan before I even got a side dish going! I’ll do this again when I get in a pinch and will definitely try the above recipe too!

This was a light and easy cod dish to make. Instead of juice from a lemon, I used lemon juice.  It tasted real good. Instead of rice pilaf and salad, I used Birdseye Hawaiian Blend rice.  I would make this again in a pinch.

This is my go-to fish recipe. To step it up a notch I add capers and cherry tomatoes while it’s cooking. Then at th end I throw in a few handfuls of spinach. My husband loves it and he’s not a big fish eater.

This fish is really quick and easy to cook! I would suggest adding several different seasonings for added flavor (salt, garlic powder, sea salt, onions, etc).

I added dill infused olive oil and added garlic salt and dried dill, a bit of spray butter and Everglades Seasoning. It was delicious

I tried this recipe. It failed miserably. I’ve tried a few recipes on this app and have never had a problem until this one. I have to get this one start because I followed the directions to a t, and wasted to perfectly good fillets.

I made this exactly as the recipe and instructions said. Except I used lemon juice since I didn't have an actual lemon. It turned out great. Couldn't be easier.

This was so bland and flavorless, we tried adding lemon pepper flavoring which in turn made it TOO lemony. The only thing that saved this was a little hot sauce and even then it was horrible.

I was looking for a cod recipe that wasn't beer battered or breaded and this was perfect.  I fried some veggies in the pan after I made the fish and served them over rice. Yum! Next time I might add paprika to give it a little kick.

Very simple and tasty! Covered it with a lid and turned off the heat right after it was done, so it would be more juicy and tender. Will make again!

Simple simple simple, tasty tasty TASTY!
Be careful to not over salt the fish, just a dash. 
And don't cook it too long. Really, 4 minutes a side, as long as you're on medium high, and it's good. If you want to be sure, either cover it when you turn it over, so it steams, or check w a thermometer.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written and  was amazed that this easy dish was so flavorful.   My husband said it was perfect ....and I thought it was very good, too.  I will definitely make it again and will play with adding fresh herbs next time.

This tasted good, if a little 'blah' to look at.  We had a lot of "juice" come out of the fish as it cooked, so it really didn't fry, as in get crispy.  We did add some garlic, mushroom, and cream to the leftover oil and juice, and it cooked into a nice sauce, which we ate with pasta and the fish.  Definitely easy and quick to make.

I was looking for heart healty recipies and tried this one.  I was amazed at how delicious this was for such a simple recipie.  I made it on the BBQ lined with foil.  I just rubbed the filets with olive oil and laid them on a preheated grill at medium temp and followed the recipie from there.  It was a hit and went pretty quickly.  My husband LOVED it. and the kids did too (i didnt put any pepper on theirs).

This was a really good, really simple recipe.  It took no time at all to cook.  I think next time, I'll use butter as opposed to the vegetable oil, just for a little bit more flavor.

Great recipe to start with. Now this is how to make this good recipe a smash I added garlic powder, olive oil rather then veg.oil. After I squeeze the lemon I threw the lemon in the pan for added flavor. Super easy.;)

Was a little bland, but I think it was that I didn't add enough pepper.  Pepper is a very strong spice, so I didn't think I should add a lot.  Make sure you add a lot of pepper and lemon.  Depending on how much you like pepper or lemon

I really liked this recipe.  It was really simple but yet, I really liked it.  I added a little fresh garlic but not much.  I also used some of the juices to pour over the fish cause I like fish with some dippings :-)

This is one of the easiest recipes I have ever made. Dinner was done in less than 30 mins! I added a little garlic salt and red pepper flakes to the fish and, when it was almost done, topped it with some (I can't believe it's not)butter soaked panko and broiled for about a minute. Served with rice & veggies. Delicious!!!

It was good, But I think I used a bit to much lemon juice and pepper. Was to spicy for the kids but my husband liked it. My Cod was really thick so it needed to cook longer, I suggest adding more oil if this is the case and it needs more, not more lemon. Haha, my mess up there! Definatly worth a try and this is the first time I ever cooked white fish!
