This recipe is a fairly simple but delicious and healthy one-dish complete meal.  I've made biryani rice dishes before but never one with such rich, complex flavor and such a marvelous fragrance. After cooking, our home was filled with a subtle, exotic aroma that lingered for hours. NOTE: This and other biryani recipes are adaptable to simplifications and time savers, such as using thawed/steamed frozen peas;1/8 teasp crushed red pepper instead of seven whole peppercorns; crystallized ginger and dried garlic; and pre-diced onions, carrots, and potatoes.  Of course, the dish is best and most authentic with the freshest ingredients -- but better a "quick" biryani, I think, than no biryani at all at the end of a long day!  Depending on your preferences, you could eliminate some vegetables, but keep the onions, garlic, herbs & spices, broth, and rice. The turmeric imparts a lovely golden hue and sublime flavor.  I've had great success adding mushrooms as well. I advise a great mango chutney as accompaniment, with yogurt or sour cream.  It also keeps and reheats nicely for next-day dining!

Simple to make and a perfect side to any curry.  If eaten as a main I would suggest some cashews and raisins and perhaps a few green cardamon pods toasted in the begginning.  Good quality spices (not some old spice jar forgotten at the back of the cupboard) is key and makes the difference between  a mildly spicey rice and a truely authentic dish. As one other reviewer said the recipe is best with fresh, good quality ingredients (except for the peas which are usually sweeter when bought frozen), there are many shortcuts you can take with the veg but there is no compromise with the spices.

I thought this was bland. The flavors were not nearly as strong as the biryani I've had in restaurants. Next time I will use ground spices and double or even triple the amount of each of them.

I used red chili flakes (1/8 tsp) in place of bay leaves, substituted corn for carrots (didn't have any carrots), added an extra 1/4 tsp of garam masala for kick, an extra tsp of salt (it needs the extra salt!), and served with cucumber raita (Indian yogurt dish).

This is a delicious starter recipe - we modified and added spices/peppers to give it a kick. The recipe is very mild on spice as is. Tip - water took 10+ minutes to evaporate in step 1, and rice was done in 20 minutes. Thank you!

Excellent recipe. Did follow up on another recommendation in the reviews and increased the amount of spices in the recipe. I basically doubled all the spices. The resulting biryani was wholesome and robust. Felt good to my Indian taste buds, yet did not overwhelm my non-Indian friends!

Delicious! I had to use red curry paste since it was all I could find by me (and didn't have time to run to the Indian market). I left out the red pepper as a result since it was already in the paste. It came out incredible! Even better the next day.

simple and tasty and the spices make the kitchen smell soooo good.  The only thing I changed is that I cooked the potatoes a bit longer (added them with the tomatoes) and sauteed bell peppers with the frozen peas and added them at the end, after the rice has simmered, so that they keep their color.

This was a disappointing recipe. Perhaps in step 2 the instructions should not say to simmer until the water evaporates. The biryani ended up fairly dry. Also, even though the biryani had multiple spices, the spices were so subtle and blended together, leaving the dish bland. I gave this recipe two stars rather than one because it was easy to make and did not taste awful. The dish was edible just not enjoyable. I will not be using this recipe again.

Dish was very flavorful and I would definitely recommend if you're a fan of Indian cuisine.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but found that it takes 10 minutes for the water to boil off and rice was done after 20 minutes (similar to other reviewer).  It called for a 1/4 teaspoon of red chili pepper and I ended up using red (cayenne) pepper, which made it a little too spicy for my daughter.

I have made this dish several times and my family loves it.  It's a great vegetarian dish with tons of flavor! I don't always have the whole spices called for but have substituted ground spices instead. Don't be timid with the spices! For variety I have tried adding almonds or cashews,raisins, or red lentils.  Smells delicious, tastes wonderful, and is great for leftovers the next day.

For my taste, it could have used some more spice.  It was good, but I will add a little more chile pepper next time.  It was definitely a good start though.

I have saved it to make. I love Biryani and could it it for a life time. My first time was having it when  I moved up  North and Then fell in love with it. I also tried to make it but it never came out right with  the spices part i guess. Being originally a Southern girl I like pakistani food . anyway i plan to  get the things i need to make this and will rate it another time. Thanks again I cant wait to try this

I have made this twice now, and doubled the recipe both times.  It freezes very well!  I used olive oil both times, but at some point I would like to make it with ghee.  The first time I used canned peas and carrots, canned potatoes, and jasmine rice.  This was very good using canned vegetables.  This most recent time I used a small bag of frozen peas and carrots, a medium russet potato, and basmati rice.  There was more than  frozen peas and carrots than 1 cup each of the frozen peas and carrots, but I used all of it and it is perfect.  I also didn't use garam masala, as mine is a bit old.  I used a biryani spice blend that I purchased at a market, and I made my own ginger garlic paste.  I will continue to make this recipe, as I have served it with lean, sliced pork, grilled chicken thighs, or alone.  It's very fragrant, and my husband loves it!

I've made this twice, once was great, once not so much.  I used 2 tsp of ground cinnamon instead of cinnamon stick, used 1 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp turmeric, 2 heaping tbsp golden raisins, 1 tbsp coriander, and a bay leaf.

Followed some other reviewers and doubled the spices (except the red chile pepper and salt) and added more salt to taste. Didn't have fresh tomatoes so I just used a small can of diced tomatoes. Also added chicken to make it more of a meal. Definitely a great recipes - very tasty and easy to make!

I couldn't find ginger garlic paste so I used 1.5 teaspoons each of ginger paste and garlic paste.  Also added a cup of golden raisins in the last few minutes.  Delish.

Made this as written and added diced dried apricot, sultanas, currants and chopped toasted peanuts as I like some sweetness and crunch in my biryani. This was as good as my local Indian restaurant! Thank you! Thank you!

Very good recipe, but bland. I doubled all the spice amounts, tripled the salt, and mixed in some cooked ground beef. Next time, im going to add more peas, carrots, and potatoes then the written amount. Thank you for the recipe Asmaa.

Wonderful!  Very easy and very adaptable, using what you have on hand as needed for substitutes.  I used fresh red chilies, dried ginger, and no added salt and it was just fabulous.  As all the other posters have said, the aroma is just perfect.

I made this for some friends, and not only did I love it, but my friends said they'd never had better in any restaurant.

The best EVER!  When it came time to add the rice and water I realized that I had used a pot that was too small.  I halved the rice and water amount, and it was amazing.
