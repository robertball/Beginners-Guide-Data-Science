Served it the first time to company...they loved it!  I added about 1/2 cup more of chopped apples...I like the moisture it added and I also used 1/2 bag of caramel bits that you can buy, instead of cutting caramels.  For a glaze I made a powdered sugar glaze and then added the same amount of caramel syrup (for ice cream) and drizzeled it over top.  Fabulous!

I found this cake to be very sweet, and the caramels didn't melt well.

i completely agree with adding more caramel candies...  this was really good - i did not try it with a topping, and i think it could use one - it was wonderful when put in the toaster over for a  few seconds...  
it takes a long time & the cake is very heavy, but if you have nothing to do on a stormy weekend day - then this is the project for you!!!

I made this cake for my family but my kids did not take to it too well. The cake is heavy; like a pound cake.
My husband and I enjoyed it however and I took what we didn't eat to the teacher's lounge at the school where I teach where it received rave reviews and several requests for copies of the recipe.

This seems to be a love it or hate it recipe!  it seems OK I guess, but I've had better.  I cut the sugar back by 1/3 cup (I also used granulated instead of icing sugar - 2C).  I increased the apples to 3 medium granny smiths - but didn't chop them fine enough.  I should have added the whole bag of caramels too.  I note that there is no leavening agent in the recipe, which is why most are saying that it is heavy.  2 tsp of baking soda fixed that - the cake is not heavy.  I also added 1/2 tsp of salt for flavoring.  The cake is not too sweet now, so I am adding a caramel frosting to improve the flavor.

My family really did not care for this cake.  Because of cutting up the carmels, it took a very long time to make.  It was very heavy and did not have a very good flavor.   I would not recommend it.  Skip the cake and just eat the carmels by themselves!!

I HAVE TO AGREE WITH ONE USER THE CAKE IS VERY HEAVY. I REALLY WAS NOT THRILLED WITH IT. FOR ONE THING IT TAKES ABOUT 20 MINUTES CUTTING THE CARAMELS AND YOUR HAND HURTS AFTER. I BROUGHT IT TO A HALL CLEAN-UP DAY AND WAS NOT REALLY A HIT. IT TASTED REALLY BLAND TOO. I THINK THE CARAMELS WOULD TASTE GOOD IN A LIGHTER CAKE. I'M SORRY BUT I WILL NOT USE THIS RECIPE AGAIN

While it does take a while to make (especially cutting the caramels) this recipe is well worth it!  Keep in mind it is sweet and dense but really good - smaller portions recommended.  One of my husband's single guy friends even buys me the caramels so that I will make the cake!
