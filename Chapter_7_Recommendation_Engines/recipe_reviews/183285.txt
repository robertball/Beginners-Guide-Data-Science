Wonderful easy recipe for the holidays!  To ensure the sugar crusted on the rim, I made these the evening before with red and white sugar crystal's and let them "sit up"!  Preparing ahead of time, allowed the sugar to last through more than one refill of champagne! Beautiful, festive, fun and turned an ordinary glass of champagne into a work of art.  Guests definitely felt special when sipping these!

I gave my sister in law the task of making the Christmas brunch cocktail and she came in with this little gem! Oh my it was so good that 3 of us drank the whole pitcher ourselves.  Oh and don't skip the sugar rimmed glass it gave it the right festive touch.

OH HOLY COW!!!  These were outstanding!!  I served these New Years eve and they blew the $50.00 bottle of Gruet Champagne out of the water! I used Patron Citronage, and Turbinado sugar! There were requests for these for brunch!! Alas I was out of champagne... will definitely make again! This recipe is a keeper!!

A great drink to celebrate Mother's Day (or any occasion for that  matter!). These are easy to prepare and a tasty twist on traditional mimosas. A definite make again.

Made this recipe for our Christmas brunch.  We have a big family so I recalculated the recipe for 36 servings and made it in my 3-gallon drink dispenser.  I rimmed the glasses with red and green sanding sugar (like you use for Christmas cookies) and put one marachino cherry in the bottom of each glass before serving.  It was delicious!  Be careful with it since it goes down so easily!  Thanks for the great recipe!

We’ve never had a mimosa before, so we really didn’t know what to expect. It was tarter than we thought it would be. In a separate little sample, I tried to add a little more liqueur to sweeten it. That did make it sweeter, but it made it too strong in alcohol; therefore, I left it as the recipe stated. I used turbinado sugar for the rim and did it the night before. It worked very well—looked, tasted, and stayed on great. Once we got used to the tartness we liked it. It definitely was a hit and most everyone had seconds. The mimosa added an elegant touch to our Christmas brunch.  I’m giving it four stars because I think we would have liked it better a little sweeter. Thank you for sharing.

This is a great twist on the mimosa!  It's crazy stupid great and something that I can drink all night long.......or at least 1:2 the night!  It's simply amazing and incredibly delicious!  If you will excuse me, I need to get back to my mimosa!
