This was nice and creamy, but it was too sweet for my taste.  I would decrease the sugar to 1/4 cup and increase the mustard to 2 teaspoons.

Great dressing!  I needed a new recipe for Potato Salad and tried this one.  Everyone loved it.
Very creamy, easy to make and tasted wonderful.
Will use this again!

This is a nice alternative to mayonnaise-based potato salad.  This tastes very similar to the dressing that my Father put over dandelion greens when I was a child.  It's just a little too sweet for our taste, so I will try 1/4 cup sugar next time, but this is a good recipe.

Delicious, though took suggestion and reduced sugar to half, and used balsamic vinegar instead of regular.  Was yummy

Too much vinegar for my taste.  I really wanted to taste the mustard more.
