I made a few changes, since my family doesn’t like shrimp, did pork and chicken.  Used Bok Choy instead of cabbage.  Otherwise recipe went about what was written.

So easy and a good way to use up leftovers! I had some smoked tri tip and coleslaw left from last night so I decided to give this a try and it turned out great! I cut up my tri tip and sautéed it in a small pan with a little water and added in some BBQ sauce when it was heated through. It was delicious! Thanks for sharing!!

Barbecued pulled meats and coleslaw go hand in hand. I used pulled chicken for these great little appys. I also like to add some sliced red onions to my slaw.
