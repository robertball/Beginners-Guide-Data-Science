This actually came out pretty good.  I added some extra veggies (eggplant, summer squash) and added mushrooms and onions to the tomato sauce.  As written you would only use 2/3 of the ricotta mixture, so I think the directions should say to use 1/2 of the mixture instead of 1/3.  Cooked on low 2.5 hours and high for last hour (for the eggplant to cook).  Yum.

Made this 1/28/13 for Recipe Group. Made it as written, with a couple slight changes. I cooked it for 1 hour on high, then 2 more hours on low. I was also excited to find whole wheat lasagna noodles. As I was layering, I ended with noodles and topped those with mozzarella - then had second thoughts and used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes that I had on hand to top the noodles before adding the last of the cheese.  I brought this to work, and the boys LOVED it! Ben said he couldn't believe he was eating vegetables - lol! - [in reference to the Swiss chard]. Chris asked if there was enough for seconds (= I did think about draining the tomatoes, but I thought the noodles needed the extra liquid. Apparently not. My only complaint about this was that it was very soupy )= Not sure how I will try to fix this next time. Maybe drain one of the cans of tomatoes. Or maybe use tomato sauce in place of one of the cans of tomatoes. I'm sure I will make it again, but I will try to thicken the sauce somehow next time. Five stars for flavor and method. Three stars for the watery sauce.

Delicious, relatively easy, and my 2 year old is eating chard and zucchini, what more can I ask for? I used a jar of sauce instead of the tomato mixture called for in the recipe, and added 1 lb sauteed beef to it. I also chopped the chard and added grated zucchini to it. I also added 1/2 jar of sauce on the top, before the last layer of mozarella.  I cooked it for 1 hour on high, then 2 hours on low. Turned out perfect, not too watery or dry.  Only change I would make next time is to add more cheese, both ricotta and mozarella, because the last layer was a little skimpy.

Recipe Group Selection: 26, January 2013 ~ Making this recipe was the first time for me using Swiss chard and flat-leaf parsley. This is one of the reasons I enjoy participating in RG – it takes me out of the box with trying new ingredients. After reading Heather and gammaray(= reviews, I was a little worried about the “soupiness” of the recipe. So with that in mind I used 1 (28oz.) can of diced tomatoes and 1(14.5oz.) can of tomatoes and 2 fresh tomatoes. I kept all the other ingredients at the listed amounts. After washing the Swiss chard and the parsley, I spun out the water in the salad spinner. I assembled the recipe as listed but cooked it on high for 1 ½ hours and turned it to low for 1 ½ hours. I then cooled it completely and put it in the fridge overnight. Today, it cut in beautiful slices and reheated very well in the microwave. I think if I had let it rest about 20 minutes before dishing up when it was hot, it would have held its shape nicely. I think cutting out the additional 14.5oz. of tomatoes with juice and adding fresh tomatoes instead really helped. I made this in my 6qt. round crock-pot and it was almost to the top before heating.  After cooking it was between ½ and ¾’s full. It serves a lot more than 6 servings. I could also make a meat lasagna (DH's favorite) using this recipe as the cooking times worked great for me and the noodles were perfectly cooked. Make sure to spray the inside of the crock-pot with cooking spray for quick and easy clean up.

I used 2 (24 oz) jars of spaghetti sauce instead I the diced tomatoes. I am glad I did for more flavor. I would also double the ricotta and add mushrooms and olives next time.

I added 1lb of ground beef to the diced tomato mixture which I believe helped soak up some of the extra liquid.  My husband loved it, and even my boys loved it and have asked me to make it again soon!

My family really enjoyed it and I have a couple of young finicky eaters in the house.  Two tips I would recommend.  One is to cut up the chard (which adds flavor) into smaller pieces so that it blends more into the meal and hides it from the kids when they eat it. Second, I cooked it on high for 2 hours and then low for 2 hours.

Reads wonderfully and I plan to try the recipe , as is, this week. We have Swiss chard as our best success crop this year... too big a crop and I look for uses.
thanks

We loved it. It was a little watery however the second day was amazing! I used a few different ingredients. Rather than swiss chard I used fresh spinach, mushrooms and grated zucchini. I also added an 8ounce can of tomato paste. I started it on low for 2 hours then high for one and a half almost 2.  Everyone loved it!

Used 1/4 cup of tahini (instead of 1/3 cup) and blended with one lemon's juice till smooth. Added all the other ingredients (except the beans) plus a pinch of cumin. I used 2 tsp minced garlic as did not have cloves. Blend all this then add the chick peas (And yes peeling the chickpeas makes it very smooth).  Added them, blended and added a tbsp of water and a drizzle of olive oil. Very smooth and yummy.

Pretty good recipe. I read the reviews and drained some of the juice from the diced tomatoes and I felt it was a little dry. After it finished cooking I removed the pot from the crock and let it sit for about 30 minutes and it thickened right up and came out looking like regular lasagna. Husband loved it, kids wouldn't touch it - go figure - red and green and gooey looking :)

I need to add a few more spices to the marinara and more cheese. But otherwise it was a good choice for dinner. Thanks.

Very bland and WAY too soupy. I might try to tweak it.  Also, there were WAY too many tomato chunks for my taste, which I should have realized before I made it.

Drained the tomatoes, used only basil and subbed fresh spinach because it's what I had on hand.

I added ground beef to the tomato mixture and did 2 hours on low then 2 hours on high. Easy to assemble and good taste, however ended up with so much liquid it ended up with more of a steamed texture.
