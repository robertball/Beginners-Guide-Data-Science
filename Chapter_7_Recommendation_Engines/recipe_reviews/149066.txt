Love it.  May try making a regular graham cracker crumb crust next time.  The crackers didn't hold together very well.

I couldn't try these personally (peanut allergy) but I brought them to a BBQ and they were a huge hit! In fact I have been asked to make them anytime I go over to my friend's house. It's amazing how a simple recipe can be this popular!

Oh man these are good! I could not fit my 9x13 pan into the microwave so I just put the marshmallow/graham cracker layer into the oven at 400 degrees until they were puffy (they just started browning at that point). I used granola instead of rice crispies. Yum, yum, yum! These won't last - they taste great!

Very good! I will use a bit less butter next time. Other than that, it's perfect as is.

Made this tonite. Sprayed the bowl, rubber spatula and the pastry cutter that i used as a knife with Pam.  Made clean up easier.  3 cups of the cereal didn't seem like enough, so I added at least 1-2 cups more which "used up" more of the chocolate. I also decreased the amount of corn syrup to 1/2 cup and used cinnamon graham crackers.  It was still a sweet treat but not overly sickening with the modifications. Will make again.
Update:  I made for fathers day  but ran out of graham crackers and used lady fingers instead. Still worked but the graham crackers give it a firmer bite.  Will stick to graham crackers

Great and so easy/quick to make! I barely even followed the recipe, if you just throw the ingredients in it still comes out great!

I loved these!  I used the oven method and I added 1 more cup of cereal than called for.  Delicious and fun to make with the kids.  I will definitely make them again.

Love this recipe----fast, easy and delicious! Made them for Christmas gifts this year and these recieved better reviews than the macaroons I slaved over; will definitely make again. For the 2nd batch I made I had run out of peanut butter & chocolate chips so I used 1/2 c of PB chips and only used 1 c of chocolate chips and 1 c of PB chips for the filling--still turned out great! Yummy!

We had these at a family reunion and my kids fell in love!  I didn't get the recipe but was happy to find it on here.  I find them very sweet and I'm not much of a fan of marshmellow.  I will make them again because everyone else loves them:)

We love this recipe - it is always a hit with both adults and kids. I made a dunkin hines brownie bottom and followed the rest of the recipe - my chocolate-pb-rice krispie topping was a bit high - i also drizzled white chocolate chips melt with corn syrup over the rice krispie layer, and then drizzled chocolate chips melted with corn syrup over the white chocolate chip layer.

Love it! Love it! Love it! So do my kids, husband, nephews and grandparents. It's great for kids of all ages. I can't wait for a big family event to make these. Easy, simple, fast. Just make sure you DO have time to chill them at least an hour...so they cut much easier.

these were yummy and easy.....the chunky peanut butter really works in this recipe because the saltiness of the peanuts helps counterbalance the super-sweetness.  I liked the texture too:  chewy but not too hard to eat.

So easy and a really good variation to the standard rice crispy treats!  My almost 3yr old loves helping me in the kitchen and these were great to do with her.  I had to pass along the recipe to my sister after sending some over for my niece and nephew - my brother-in-law scarfed them down!  They are pretty sweet though, so make sure you've got your glass of milk ready!

These were very easy to make, but too rich for my taste. If you like very sweet this recipe is for you. I do not recommend storing them in the refrigerator before eating. They taste better at room temp.

This is an easy recipe that people really seem to enjoy. I would recommend using name-brand graham crackers to get the best flavor.

These were incredibly wasy to make. I didn't have miniature marshmallows, so I quartered regular marshmallows and put them on top of the graham crackers. It worked well. They were delicious and, the fact that they were easy, made them a hit in my household.

These are such a great spin on the basic Rice Krispy Treat.  So easy to make and are ALWAYS a big hit.  People will definitely be asking for the recipe.
