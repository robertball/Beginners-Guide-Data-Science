My husband and I really liked this chicken. Things I did to make it better were... Chopped the cashews finely in the food processor, so they were fine enough to stick to the chicken.  Pounded the chicken breasts to a little less than a half inch, so it was more tender.  Then I cooked the chicken on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet lined with aluminum; this kept the bottom of the chicken from getting soggy.

Great tasty, easy recipe!  Some other reviewers thought that there wasn't enough taste.  I found that you have to pour the extra sauce over the chicken before serving, and that adds the taste you need.  Also, I omitted the curry and used garlic powder and a dash of teriyaki sauce instead, and substituted well crushed peanuts for the cashews.  The sauce came out like a nice tangy duck sauce.  Orange marmalade would work well in this recipe.  Next time I will try jellied cranberry sauce, port wine, and cinnamon or allspice for the sauce, with minced walnuts as the crust.  Thanks Brennan for a great recipe!

While this wasn't "bad," my company & I all thought the "pistachio chicken" and "bourbon pecan chicken" from this site were both 10x better ...and a better choice of nut w/chicken.  I highly recommend trying them if you like nuts!  They'll leave your tastebuds tingling!  This is coming from people who prefer and love cashews the most!!  So, we won't be putting this on our regular cycle of dishes for our weekly get-togethers.  Didn't pass the taste test in our cooking club that meets monthly either.  I tried several times to give this a chance.  It's just okay at best.  Sorry!

Outstanding! I wasn't sure how I would like this, just, cooking chicken in apricot preserves sounded a bit to sweet for my taste. But, it tastes a lot better than the ingredients sounded in my head. This is one of the better recipes I have found here and will be cooked repeatedly in my house. Everyone, including the kids, gave it 2 thumbs up!

Just tried this recipe, and it is to die for! Even with boneless chicken,however, this recipe requires a full 45 minutes to bake.

Yum!

This recipie was fairly simple although the chicken was not quite as yummy as I had hoped.  I was surprised by how little of the cashews you could actually taste.  I used raw cashews so I may try roasted cashews next time.  none the less it was a good way to make chicken and I will definately work with it again, maybe try different types of nuts.  It is worth a try for those of us who like chicken but have run out of ways to cook it.

GREAT recipe - and so easy!  I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces, which cut the baking time to 25-30 minutes.  Also added dried Chinese chili peppers to add a "zing" and make it more Asian.  Quite delicious.  Thanks!!

My husband and I REALLY enjoyed this! I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. I read that some other reviewers did not add the curry... HUGE mistake! The curry powder blends in with the flavors from the apricot and dijon PERFECTLY and I truly feel if you leave it out, you're missing the best of this dish. Even people who say they don't like curry will enjoy it here because it doesn't over power, but rather it enhances the flavor. I used a brand of apricot preserves that was "Sugar Free" and it worked out great; no one would ever suspect. I spun my cashews in a mini food processor and just sprinkled them over the chicken rather than roll the meat in the nuts. The chicken was nice and moist and the flavor was spectacular! This is a restaurant quality recipe and it will go into my regular rotation. Thanks for submitting such a tasty and simple dish!

This was really good! Even my husband raved about this one. I served it with saffron rice and steamed broccoli. I did cut this recipe in half since it was only the 2 of us .. I wish I hadn't though because I would have loved some leftovers. The only change that I made was that I added a little extra apricot preserves to the sauce before dipping the chicken in to it  (I tasted it and it tasted to much like mustard for my liking). I also added a dash of chili pepper to the sauce just to give it a little kick. I did follow other reviewers advice and I seasoned the chicken with a little salt, pepper, and garlic seasoning. I put the cashews in the food processor until they were finely chopped. This really helped the cashews stick to the chicken. I baked for 20 minutes then broiled for 3 so the cashews were crunchy. I reheated the sauce and brought it back to a rolling boil so we could use it for dipping - wonderful!!! The sauce really made the dish. I will be making this again for my hubby and I. Next time I will make extra for leftovers though :-)

This turned out pretty well!  If the chicken breasts are very thick, add 5 mins. to the cooking time. There was an abundance of sauce left over. Might could cut in half. needed twice the ammt. of nuts. besides being sorta of sticky, it was pretty easy and yummy.

At first glance, this seemed like an odd combination of flavors but it ended up being one very tasty dish.  I used crushed almonds as that is what I had on hand, but I am anxious to try it with different nuts.

The sauce burned very easily, and the amount of dijon mustard is too overpowering. My bf liked it though, so I think next time I'll just add the sauce after the chicken has cooked a bit and half the amount of dijon mustard.

I can't fairly give this 5 stars because I used Macadamia nuts in place of the cashews (it was all I had).  I thought this was very good.  Maybe the Macadamia nuts made it taste better than it would have with the cashews, since there have been a lot of negative reviews.  Both my husband and I liked it.  There was plenty of sauce and neither one of us thought it was too sweet.  My kids weren't too fond of it, but they're 5 and 10 and unless it's chicken along the lines of chicken nuggets they're not interested!  As I made it, I would give it 5 stars!

This is a staple in my family. It's an incredibly mild sweet curry that's fantastic with brown rice - or white rice if you prefer.

Very good and very easy to put together.   I really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce; just wish I had gotten the nuts a little finer to help them stick better.  Next time I'll throw them in the food processor.  Thanks!

Loved this.  We didn't have preserves, so I blended canned apricots till they were smooth.  I added a touch of sugar and som allspice.  The sauce was not too sweet and not too tart.  Everyone who tried this loved it, and it was really very easy.  Will absolutely make again.

I served this dish for a small dinner party I had, and it went very well. Unfortunately, I read the recipe too fast and bought chicken breasts on the bone instead! Worked out fine, though. I didn't have enough cashews for a total coating, but there was enough glaze to cover all the breasts. (Also, I couldn't find apricot preserves, so I used Saucy Susan instead. Again, worked great!) One of my guests asked for the recipe. A compliment?

My husband and I loved this dish!  Very very easy and very very good.  Nice for a change!  I did like one other reviewer said and crushed the cashews very small and put the chicken on cooling rack on a baking sheet to allow the chicken to stay crunchy everywhere.  Will certainly make this meal again.

We all loved the glaze but tried it with cracker crumbs instead of cashews and love it more. Also used the glaze with pork chops - yummy!

This dish was great. Instead of using dijon mustard, I used 2 tablespoons of honey dijon mustard. It gave the chicken added flavor.

I substitute chopped pecans for this recipe, and it is awesome.  I have never tried the cashews, but can't give up the pecans.  I boil the sauce for a few minutes and serve over steamed rice and a vegetable.  It's hard to keep the nuts on when you roll the meat, so I sprinkle some on the top.  I foil line my pan for easy cleanup.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this about a month ago before the picture was posted. It was very good.  The sauce was wonderful.  The only problem I had was that the cashews on the bottom of the chicken got soggy. I had planned to just coat the tops the chicken the next time I made this, but now that I have seen the picture I will cook the chicken with some seasoning and pour the sauce over the  top with rice. Thanks for the recipe.

It was alright.  It could definitly be tinkered with more.  The most delicious part was the caramelized preserve mised with the cashew that stuck on the pan.  That was really good, but otherwise the chicken was rather bland and the apricot totally overpowered the casheews.  Perhaps if the cashews were roasted, it would enhance the flavour.  I think perhaps next time I will try just sauteing small pieces of chicken and then adding the sauce and the cashews.

Excellent recipe! I accidentally used more apricot preserves than were called for, but the sauce was delicious anyway. I recommend pounding the chicken breasts fairly thin before dipping them into the sauce, and be sure to keep a watchful eye on the extra sauce that you boil in the pan afterward---it becomes gummy if it's heated too long.

This recipe was a little disappointing to me. I thought it sounded great, but it didn't turn out as I expected. I tried using partially defrosted frozen chicken breasts and the chicken didn't seem evenly cooked. I will try again with fresh chicken and crushed cashews.

This recipe was delicious.  It did take a little time to put together, but the all the different flavors together is what made this recipe unique and delicious.  Also, I substituted apricot for raspberry because I did not have apricot in the house.  It was good.  Thank you!

Tried this chicken on my adult children and it was a great success.  It was easy, tasty, and would serve very well for company.     Be careful not to leave too long inthe oven, as it will dry out and loose some of its flavor.  I have told several friends about this easy to make treat.

This was very easy to prepare and was pretty yummy.  I used extra cashews.  I did not boil the extra sauce & serve with the chicken because I forgot to set some aside before I dredged the raw chicken in it!  I think the extra sauce would've made it taste even better, so I recommend doing that.  I cut up the left overs & put them in my salad for lunch & it was delicous!!  I will be keeping this recipe.

Tasty and easy. I made this with two chicken breasts and 3/4 cup cashews and the amount was perfect. I think I may keep some of the mustard seeds in the apricot mix rather than strain the all

Um... THANK YOU! I followed the recipe and it was SMASHING. Totally scrumptious. I lined the cookie sheet with foil (like everyone else) and this helped for easier cleanup. I served with white sticky rice & steamed aspargus. So stinkin good!

I made this with Panko bread crumbs instead of cashews and it was still really good.  Loved the sauce - I did add a bit more curry than it called for because I love the flavor.

taste ok. but until i figure out how to get the nuts to stick to the chicken (and not to me) i will probably not be making this again any time soon. reduced sauce was wonderful however and i will keep it in mind for other dishes.

I've made this twice now.  It tastes great and is so simple to make.  The apricot preserves took a long time to melt down completely and smooth out.  I got impatient and dipped the chicken into the not-quite-smooth preserves.  It still stuck to the chicken, and the cashews (which I crushed up a bit), stuck well to the preserves.  Tin foil in a baking dish made for easy clean-up.  I seasoned the chicken with a little salt, pepper and curry powder before dipping in the sauce.

This was an OK recipe.  The chicken was hard to coat in the cashews.  My cashew mixture got very clumpy.  The flavor was good.  Watch the cook time as mine was a tad bit dry.  I am not sure this is worth the effort or the cost (the cashews cost $6.00).

hmm... tasted good, even after I modified based on what I had on hand (orange marmalade, yellow mustard with a little horseradish) but the cashews didn't stick at all. good enough to try again though, so next time I'll try grinding the nuts in a coffee grinder rather than chopping them. I also thought it needed salt, even with salted nuts. it went really well with Sugared Asparagus (from this site).

I have tried this several times, very good.  Made this with doubling the sauce so it will satify extra for serving over rice.  Also prepared this with Prok Chops without the cashews. 1st serring the chops and cooking in a covered pad on the stove top.

A great recipe! This was simple and very, very tasty. The chicken is wonderfully flavored and comes out very moist, not dry. It is also very filling due to the cashews. I cooked the chicken at a higher temperature, 200ºC or 400ºF.

Using low-sugar apricot preserves makes it less sweet. Using unsalted, chopped macadamias makes it richer. Can be assembled ahead, refrigerated, and baked in the evening for dinner. Easy and delicious recipe.

It was alright.  Not one of my favorite chicken recipes.  My kids weren't crazy about the sauce and I'm not too much of a curry person, but I'm willing to try anything once.  Probably won't make again.

I loved this recipe, but my husband and son were a bit less enthusiastic (my son scraped all the cashews off his chicken breast).  I'll definitely make this again sometime for a hopefully more appreciative audience.

This recipe is as good as it gets.  I've combined it with the "Harvest Rice Dish" for my next dinner party.  I expect them both to be a big hit!

Wonderful.  Tangy sauce is perfectly complimented by the slight crunch of the cashews.  Great flavor.

We served the chicken with rice.  There was leftover sauce and rice, so my sister put the sauce on the rice before putting it in the fridge.  When my teenage brother came home, he really enjoyed the leftovers.

This was a great recipe, I really loved it!  Just remember to chop up the cashews really well...I didn't, and they didn't stay on the chicken pieces which was a bit frustrating.  It didn't matter though because we scooped up the pieces and ate them with the sauce!  Yum!  :)  The dish wasn't too sweet, and it went really well with white rice.  For variety, I think I'm going to do what some people suggest and throw a few chili peppers in the sauce next time.

Wonderful! I did modify it though. I used pecans instead of cashews which I finely ground. Also, I used the whole seed Dijon style mustard and I poured the marmalade mixture on top of the chicken after it baked.

This had my 2 year old screaming, "More chicken! More sauce, Mommy!" Hubby and I loved it too. Used salt and pepper cashews that I ground up (hubby thought it was crackers) that really kicked up the flavor. Am definitely going to double sauce for dipping next time! Easy and delish!

It was super easy to make.  I added a table spoon of garlic and a teaspoon of cumin to the sauce and poked a lot of holes into the meat with a fork before baking and it had plenty of flavor.  Made green beans with a citrus vinaigrette and garlic mashed potatoes as the sides. My boyfriend almost licked the plate!

I replaced the apricot preserves with orange marmalade because I like orange flavor better, and I was happy with the taste. I put the cashews in a food processor and chopped them fine for the crust, and cut the chicken down to tender size. They cooked in 20 minutes.

This wasn't bad, but the cashews didn't really add much flavor. I did however love the sauce.  Think I'll keep the sauce to serve with my panko chicken.

Very easy to make and very delicious also nice a light, didn't feel guilty for cleaning my plate or to heavy.  Only thing i changed was i used about 2 cups of cashews and i crushed them instead of course chop, added any remaining back to the sauce for use with serving.  YUM YUM YUM!!

Very quick to prepare and very good.  As suggested by another reviewer, I chopped the nuts briefly in a food processor so they would stick better.  I couldn't really discern that cashews were used in the end, so I may try it with peanuts next time.  I decreased the Dijon mustard a little as I am not a big fan of its flavor.  In place of the curry (don't have it), I used garlic powder, black pepper, and parsley flakes.  Next time I would also add some fresh minced garlic in the sauce as it boils.  This recipe doesn't call for any salt and doesn't need it.  This is a great recipe if you are pressed for time, but still want something a little out of the ordinary.

This recipe has a nice combination of flavors and lends itself pretty well to tweaking when it comes to ratios.  I've made it about 5-6 times and never been disappointed.  The first time, I followed the recipe to a T and was bothered by rolling the chicken in the cashews.  By the third chicken breast, the cashews were covered in apricot mixture and they just wouldn't stick anymore.  So, my modifications to the recipe.  I use about 10 or so ounces of apricot and 1/3 cup spicy brown mustard.  For the chicken, I have done it whole with the cashews sprinkled on top as well as cubed in the mixture and cooked on the stove.  When cubed, I put the chicken over white rice and sprinkle with the cashews after toasting them in the oven for a few minutes.

Very good.  I used a 10 oz. jar of Smuckers "Simply Fruit" instead of the preserves (less sugar), and it turned out just fine with plenty of sauce to my liking.  I cooked the chicken breasts for 40 minutes though.  Will make again, thanks for sharing!

Very yummy, but somewhat sweet.  I think it needs some spice for balance.  Perhaps Ill add chilli flakes or use a stronger curry next time.

This recipe was very good.  I had some issues with the cashews falling off.  I think I'll try putting them in a processor next time for a finer chop.  I took another person's advice and broiled it the last 2 minutes.  It was moist and sweet.  Yummy...will make again!

This recipe was a great change from the usual. The apricot, dijon, and curry dressing gave the recipe an elegant presentation along with the crushed cashews. I did back off on the dijon using half of what was called for to reduce the bite of the dejon. This will be a 'do-it-again' recipe for us.

Not my choice for a recipe.  This was too sweet and the sauce took away from the taste of the cashews.  If it wasn't for the apricot preserves this might be a good recipe.

OK so I didn't follow exactly and I hate when people rate without doing so, but the only substitution I made was I used orange marmalade for the apricot preserves. It's what I had. Anyway, this makes a great sauce. I'm a cashew lover, but they didn't seem to do anything for me in this. Enjoyed the chicken, but I put the leftover sauce over a porktenderloin stuffed with a cranberry sage dressing and it was even better! A great addition to pork!

Instead of chopping, I roughly crushed up the cashews with a pestle and mortar. I used quite a bit more Dijon, and I wish I had added a little s&p. Not bad though. Thank you, Brennan!

I'm not really sure what to think of this recipe.  I really liked the crunchiness of the cashews, they were the best part, but my husband and daughter scraped them off.  The sauce was good, but it was extremely rich.  You couldn't really taste it on the chicken and I thought the chicken was a little bland, but I did reserve some of the sauce before dipping the chicken in it and drizzled it over the top after the chicken was cooked.  This was a good dinner, but it was bland without the sauce and a little too rich with it.  I would eat it if it was served to me, but I personally wouldn't make it again.

Really good dish! The cashews combined with the apricot/ mustard sauce ( which we put a good amount of extra on top ) give this dish a bit of an Asian taste.

It was OK if you don't mind a sweet fruity taste to your chicken.  Not sure if we'll make this one again.  But on the bright side it was very easy to make!

Very good! This is a really strong sauce, so I paired it with just plain mashed potatoes. Instead of rolling the chicken in the cashews, I just sprinkled them on and pressed them into the chicken breasts after they were dipped into the sauce. I will make this again.

Excellent!! Made for Christmas Eve dinner and not only did it disappear quickly, but my husband scraped the baking dish clean. I've made it 3 times since then and it's absolutley delicious. I wouldn't change a thing.  Update:  This is such a hit in my house that I make it in mass quantities.  I prepare as the recipe states - WITHOUT cooking the chiken.  I wrap single pieces in freezer paper, and then place in a freezer zipper bag for later use.  It saves time for a quick week-day meal.

I was so excited to make this but when I opened my pantry all I had were macadamia nuts and an Asian Plum Sauce.  But it turned out great - the chicken was very moist!  Now I'm going to get creative and try with other sauces and nuts.

This was a winner in our house. Great texture.  Next time I'll try two modifications: baking it on a broiler pan so the chicken juices drain away and  don't make it soggy, and less curry powder.

My friends and I loved this! Super easy, fast and delicious. Perfect for a weekday meal. The extra sauce makes it, but you don't need a whole lot or it does get a little sweet. I was impatient to let the preserves completely melt - you really don't need to. Serve with light sides - cous cous and sauteed zuchhini. A perfect Fall meal.

This dish is very tasty! I used orange marmalade insted of apricot preserves. This dish reminds me  of chinese chicken.  I had this dish with rice pilaf and peas. I would make again. Huddy loved it!

Easy and delicious! The original recipe from the April/May 2015 magazine states to roast the cashews, which I did. I don't know if it made a big difference, but the recipe sure was a hit.

Made this tonight with some of my homemade ginger-peach jam reducing the recipe for 2 chicken breasts, but made the full amount of sauce.  Served over white rice with steamed broccoli  on the side.  Very good!

This dish turned out great! I didn't change much...just added extra cashews at the end on top and some diced red peppers for color. I think you might be able to cut down slightly on the apricot preserves if you prefer less sweet dishes. It's quite delicious as is though!

Chicken itself was bland. Nuts cost a lot here and so does good chicken, so I won't be wasting these ingredients into an only OK dish again.

I made a version of this since I didn't have all ingredients... I used pecans since I didn't have cashews and peach jam instead of apricot. Turned out very yummy! Can't wait to try it with cashews and apricot! 
Sometimes you just get tired of all recipes you have and branch out to try something new. This was one of those times. Same concept just slightly different ingredients since the mother of creativity  is need.

Came out perfect! Only thing is I didn't have enough cashews for all the chicken, so the last two were coated in bread crumbs.

What started out as a great recipe,  I questioned it being too sweet? I made a few changes that made it restaurant worthy! Crushed and sautéed 3 cloves of garlic in 1 tsp of butter before adding 8oz of apricot preserves instead of 12oz. added the same dijon mustard but added a generous tbsp of prepared mustard as well as two cranks of sea salt and the original tsp of curry. Used 3/4 cashews to 1/4 chopped almonds. Served with brown basmati rice cooked in 1/2 cup of sautéed sweet onion and a little salt. Baby carrots rounded out this delicious meal!

This is a great and flavorful recipe! I love the extra sauce on the side, which I spiced up with a small touch of sriracha. Then, it got me thinking about trying this with jalapeno jelly. Hoooollllyy!! If I do this again, I will mix apricot and jalapeno jelly or Harry and David's onion pepper relish.

This was amazing!  I was skeptical when I read the ingredient list but I thought I'd give it a go anyway and boy, I am so glad I did.  I followed this recipe almost exactly.  I did a little bit of tweaking but not too much.  My  list of changes were... I used chicken tenders instead of breasts.  I seasoned them with salt, pepper and garlic powder before I dipped it in the sauce and nuts.  I cooked them on a cooling rack like a few others suggested to keep the bottoms being soggy,  25 minutes finished them just fine.  My last little change was when it came to boiling the sauce I added a pinch of pepper flakes to make it a tad on the spicy side.  This was yum yum yummy!  Served with garlic quinoa and steamed broccoli!

This was tasty, but it needed a little salt.  It was a little messy to make.  Instead of using curry, I grated some fresh ginger in with the mustard and apricot.  I served it with applesauce and maple glazed carrots.

The sauce was great; the chicken was nothing special without it. I think the cashews should have been toasted or the baking temperature higher to achieve some kind of crunch. Bake time also needs to be more like 40 minutes unless you pound or butterfly the breasts.

It was very good, tender and moist, but I thought the flavor was a bit lacking. I will definitely make this again, but I might change the ratio between the jelly and mustard. I also might experiment with other jellies. Overall, it was still yummy for my tummy :)

Excellent!  That's all I have to say.  My husband and I both devoured this.  I had made extra for lunch tomorrow and we both went back for seconds.  Oh well.  The tastes are so different yet so wonderful together.  I highly recommend it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy chicken.  I am a big fan of nuts in my cooking so this was a must try.  I am thinking about subbing the Apricot jam for some Raspberry jam the next time.  I loved the flavors of the mustard and the jam together in the sauce.  It was so easy.

Delicious, Easy and Fast!  However, for a little bit more flavor I added the following ingredients 3/4 tsp. garlic powder, 3/4 tsp. onion powder, 1 tsp. ground red pepper, 1 tsp. fresh black pepper, and I increased the curry powder by 1 tsp.  I baked the chicken as directed but then the last 2 -3 minutes I broiled it on low to make the crust a little crunchy on top and light golden brown.  I served this with steamed asparagus and roll!  YUM!

Good flavor combo of sweet sauce and cashews.  I added garlic powder to sauce, may try a thai curry paste next time instead of curry powder for a little kick.  Good with smashed cauliflower as a side dish.

At the end of baking, I put under the broiler for just a few minutes (3?) to crisp them up a bit. I served for our staff Christmas party (15 people) and it was a major hit!

This is a great recipe to make when you have no time to prepare a meal. Fast, easy and very little ingredients. I would give looks and presentation 5 stars, and taste 3.5 stars. Very good change though. Will make again. Thanks

I was a little skeptical about the combination of Apricot preserves and Dijon Mustard, but this was delicious and the cashews added a really nice, crunchy texture to the dish.  My only complaint was in the execution.  I was hoping this would be quick and easy, but it took forever (about 20 minutes) for my preserves to melt down, and even after 20 min it wasn't completely smooth, and I had a terrible time getting the cashews to stick to the chicken.  Well worth the effort though, as the results were fantastic.  I'll definitely make this again, with a few small changes suggested by some of the other reviewers.

This is now one of my quick dinner staples. It is easy to make and very tasty. There are times I make it and omit the cashews. Still delicious! Also tastes great if you substitute the chicken with pork.

i used an apricot-ginger preserve for this dish; i doubled the whole recipe and let the chicken sit in the sauce for a hour or so before cooking it all together. i made this for a large dinner party at my parents house, and it was a raging success. thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic. The sauce is VERY sweet - I did as otehrs suggested and spooned the remaining sauce over the chicken after baking, however I thought this was a mistake - much too sugary for my taste. The sweetness is already baked into the chicken - no need to add anymore. Overall a great recipe though!

FAN-FREAKIN'-TASTIC.  I found this recipe for my husband (who ended up making the dinner, not me) and we LOVE it.  We haven't changed or added a thing and have passed it on to others.

The sauce was very good (tastes a lot like sweet & sour sauce), but I couldn't get the cashews to stay on! The apricot preserves are pretty expensive too (you need 2 jars).  I will probably make this again, but only as a dipping sauce.

This was SO easy and delicious! I especially loved the extra sauce to put over the top. The only change I made was that I used chicken tenders instead of breasts. I will DEFINITELY make this again and again!

FANTASTICO!!!  When I first stirred up the apricot/mustard/curry sauce and tasted it, I was apprehensive, but after everything was cooked, the flavor "softened" a bit and was one of the most perfect sweet & sour tastes I'd ever had.  My husband loved the flavor and the cashews were such BONUS flavor, texture and crunch!  My only change was I used boneless, skinless thighs, which ALWAYS cook up more tender and juicy since they are dark meat.  This chicken is delightful and oh-so-simple...its officially in our dinner rotation now!

I loved it. Used chicken tenders instead of breasts. Found that the cashews did not 'stick' well to the chicken however in the end it wasn't a major problem. Once chicken was in dish, just poured the rest of the cashew/sauce mixture over them. Might suggest not cooking up the sauce for dipping after raw chicken has been dipped in it - may not be healthy. Served it with mashed potatoes, covered with cheddar  and put under the broiler. A dollop of sour cream served on  mashed portion is wonderful. Highly recommended.

Yummy and super easy to make! This is going to become a regular on our menu! I am surprised at those who said it was messy. Duh, whenever you coat chicken in anything stuff may drip on the counter! My only recommendation would be to use a food processor to crush the cashews, it just helps to have them as small as possible when coating the chicken. Also I made a side dish of broccoli and drizzled the leftover apricot sauce onto it. Yum!

The first time I made it was for a small dinner party that included one of my husband's co-workers with a reputation for being a very picky eater.  Everyone loved it . . . plus, they were amazed to watch this person eat every bite and ask for the recipe.  It's very easy . . . and it'll be fun to play with the recipe to see what else is possible.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic and so easy to make!  I recommend using Bonne Maman apricot preserves for the sauce; they're more expensive, but well worth it.

I was a bit disappointed with this.  I expected great things from it, it sounded so good.  The cashews weren't as crispy as I had expected.  It was OK, but I won't be making again soon.

Simple made even easier.  I mixed up the sauce, flattened the chicken a little.  Then I poured a little sauce in the bottom of the pan, layed the chicken on top, and poured the rest of the sauce over the top.  Sprinkled the cashews on and baked as directed.  Yummy.  Loved by hubby, 9 y/o daughter and myself.  13 y/o didn't care for it, but it would be easy to bake a plain chicken breast alongside for her!

I didn't have high hopes for this recipe but it was really good.  The crunch of the cashews and the tangy sauce combination was great.

Company good!  I followed the recipe exactly making sure I chopped the cashews very fine.  I baked it on a broiler pan as someone suggested but it still came out rather gooey on the bottom.  Next time I won't waste the cashews on the bottom and I'll add a little more curry seasoning.  Otherwise--yum, yum!

This was a good recipe--a few recommended changes: flatten the chicken breasts first for more tender chicken. I also recommend chopping the cashews more finely so they truly "stick". Finally, you probably shouldn't serve the excess sauce on the side if you dipped the chicken directly into it--reserve a separate portion for coating the chicken.

Other than omitting the curry powder(do not like it) I followed this recipe.  It is an excellent chicken dish. Thanks for the great recipe Brennan!

I've made this several times and love it.  Very easy and different way to make chicken (which I'm always looking for).  I also made extra sauce which I recommend.

I fixed this after work for a small group - one has spent many years as a caterer. We all loved it. I put the extra sauce around the chicken before I baked it -- made the meat very moist. It was great!

I don't know what I did wrong but it didn't taste good at all. I'm not that smart so I might not have followed the recipe.

This is a very sweet recipe but it is nice.  Go light with your side dish.  I just made a light salad and used the extra sauce as a hot dressing for it.

I thought this was yummy but my boyfriend thought it was just ok (said it was a bit too sweet).
The cashew nuts went brown and crispy and tasted great with the jam sauce. Will make again for sure but use a little less jam next time for my fussy man!

I didn't like this recipe as much as I expected. I love cashews but surprisingly there just wasn't enough cashew flavor. I think it was upstaged by the sauce. I served the chicken with extra sauce over the top as others suggested but my husband and I both found it to be way too sweet. If I make this again I will skip the extra sauce.

I am a vegetarian, but have the task of preparing meals with meat for my family when we get together.  This is a common request.  I use some of the apricot sauce on tofu with good success, and there are no complaints by the carnivores either.  My picky hubby loves it.

This was good...but something about the texture just wasn't right for me. It might have been that the cashews didn't crisp enough in the oven. Anyway, the chicken had a great flavor with the sauce. Overall, I would make it again.

This recipe was amazing.  I don't care for mustard or apricots but I loved it.  My husband also loved it.  I followed directions to a tee and can't see anything I'd add or take out.

It's quite good, although not out of this world. The apricot flavoring is very strong, so make sure you like apricot preserves.
