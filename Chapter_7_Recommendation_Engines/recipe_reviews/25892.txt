One change - I used "roasted garlic" flavor cream of mushroom soup.  The dish was delicious - a big hit at a pot luck, with several folks asking for the recipe!  Quick and easy, I'll definitely make this again.

Suggestions:
* Increase the spinach!  Could easily double.  Otherwise this dish is way too creamy.
* Add lots of fresh spinach!  Helps with taste.  You should actually add after removing from oven (don't worry it won't be crispy).
* Decrease the cream of mushroom soup.... not such a great taste, the sweetness of the cream cheese is hidden.
* Add a dash of black pepper.
* I didn't use the french fried onions.

Yum!  I really liked this.  The onions really stand out and accent the spinach perfectly.  Just make sure you whip the cream cheese first, or it won't mix well.

Very good recipe!!!  Make sure to use minced garlic in this casserole, it gives it that needed "extra punch". I also added a few seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan cheese to the top because I ran out of the fried onions.  I will not to have do this again because I ran out, I will do it because it made it so good!  The parmesan cheeses and extra seasonings topped it off perfectly!

I used fresh spinnach which made it much more bulky and mixed cream cheese (reduced fat) with cream of broccoli separately- then added torn up spinnach.  Next time I will soften cream cheese.

I love spinach, and this was great.  I did use 3 times the amount of spinach called for (and a combo of fresh and frozen that I didn't squeeze dry), and it was still very creamy. Any excess moisture cooked off and it had a great texture.

We had this as a side dish.  I added a little velveta to it before baking so my husband would be more likely to eat it.  I think we will be adding moz. cheese next time along with some more seasoning.  It was bland, but I enjoy spinach so I didn't mind.

My friends & I loved this. After making it according to the directions the first time, it was a little bland, so I modified it: cook 1/3 lb. cubed bacon, drain grease; zap cream cheese 6 min. on defrost in casserole; add well drained spinach & cream mushroom soup to cream cheese & mix with a shortening creamer or wire style potato masher; add 4 [pepper mill] twists of black pepper, a couple of shakes of onion powder & 4 shakes of Mrs. Dash Table Blend; fold in a small drained can mushrooms, 1/2 of the fried onions, 1 heaping Tablespoon jarred minced garlic, & the bacon; top with a thin sliced layer of any cheese you like [I used american & swiss because that's what I had] & top cheese with remaining fried onions. Bake as directed. Rave reviews!

I LOVE this recipe! Plus, whenever I make it, I get rave reviews. It has now become a regularly featured side dish for entertaining and for home meals. 

Whenever I make it I double the recipe to ensure that have enough. I make sure I really drain the spinach well--I squeeze small amounts through cheese cloth. I use the 1/3 fat cream cheese, too. You can't tell the difference and it comes out just as creamy, just with a little bit less fat. I add more french friend onions than requested to the body of the casserole for a little bit of added texture. Finally, on top along with the onions, I sprinkle on some powdered Parmesan cheese.

I've made this recipe once so far and it was fantastic! Easy and quick to make, a great side dish! The only thing I did differently was use garlic cream of mushroom soup. This dish even reheats really well.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a very good recipe, but I am a very picky (organic) eater, so my modifications are... I made a big batch of cream of celery/mushroom soup with onion and roasted garlic from scratch (seasoned with sea salt, gourmet pepper blend and basil).  I leave the cut up vegetables in the soup, many people strain them out.  I used part of the soup to mix with the cream cheese (saved the rest as soup), then drizzled that over fresh spinach and used a fork to work it in a little.  When it was almost done baking, I sprinkled the surface with a mexican 3 cheese shred blend.  I did not use the fried onions.  Nothing wrong with them, I just never have liked them :)  Next time I might sautee some bread crumbs in a little butter and sprinkle on top of the cheese, then broil briefly.  That would probably be a very nice finishing touch... if you don't care for the fried onion topping.

Delicious! I would recommend making a few changes based on what flavors you want to stand out. I like the taste of spinach so I used nearly double the amount, including fresh spinach. Next time I would use a little less than the whole can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup because the garlic taste was overpowering. I also used only about half the can of French-fried onions and that taste was plenty strong enough. I topped the casserole with parmesan and the dish was gobbled right up. I've since made it with lots of veggies - mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots - for a more healthy, hearty casserole. Tasted good but I think only spinach is best.

This was very good. Be sure cream cheese is completely softened. I did not totally squeeze out all of water from the spinach, I believe that kept it somewhat moist. Watch salt. I should have used low sodium soup. Recommend using better brand of ff onions.

I actually use 2 bags of fresh baby spinach instead of the frozen.  No need to even cook the spinach first!  Tastes great and my non-spinach eating husband loves it too.

Quick, easy, fairly healthy and the whole family enjoyed it!  This was to be the main course, so I added some grilled, shredded chicken (3/4 of a boneless breast), a half bag of shredded Mozerella, a few spoonfuls of "Bush's Black Bean Fiesta" and used the Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup.  It's a keeper for future "Daddy Days".

Excellent recipe! The only thing I added was a dash of salt and pepper. Note: make sure your cream cheese is fully softened before adding or it doesn't mix well. Can't wait to make it again!

I was trying to make something that I had before at a buffet and it tastes verrryyy similar so I am very happy. Added a little onion powder because idk and I used colby-jack as a topping but I'm not sure if I should have let the spinach first because it was kinda cold and I had to mix it a little and put it back in. Also someone said it was too creamy so I took out a tablespoon of cream cheese and maybe I should have reduced the mushroom soup a bit more. But yeah anyway, good stuff.

Really yummy, albeit with the variations I made.

I didn't have creamy mushroom soup so I sauteed some mushrooms over butter, and gradually added a little flour and stirred in some milk which formed a thick and creamy mushroom sauce.

I also didn't have fried onion so I used plain ol' bread crumbs. It came out really well though, although the bread crumbs on top did not brown and the appearance was unappealing.

I have made this recipes several times and my family loves it! I add a little more french fried onions to it and it is delicious! Everyone whose tasted it loves it and asks for the recipe and they're always blown away by how simple it is.

Yummy!  Even my 11 year old said it was good (a miracle!).  One change - I sprinkled the onions on the top for the last 5 or so minutes so they did not become overly browned.

Really enjoyed this. Used it as a side dish at Thanksgiving. Great because you could make it ahead of time and pop it into the oven for the 20 minutes that your turkey was "resting" before you cut it. The fried onions added a lot of flavor.

This is yummy but I made some modifications.  I didn't have the fried onions so I diced some an onion.  I also added two cups cooked rice to make it a more full-bodied casserole to feed my 5 kids.  I cooked it for 25 and it was fantastic.  I had my 3 year-old crying because he couldn't have seconds...I offered him double dessert and he wanted the casserole more!

Excellent recipe! As suggested I used the "roasted garlic" flavor cream of mushroom soup. I also substituted chive and onion flavored cream cheese spread for the cream cheese. It's the bomb!

Everybody really liked this one.  I did make some substitutions.  I used fat free cream cheese and I cubed it instead of softening it and incorporating it. I used 3 frozen spinach boxes.  I used 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup.

This dish was wonderful! My 5 year old described it as "Yummy" and said "I love it"!  Since I'm all about a one dish meal, I added bite-sized turkey breast chunks and it was a dinner casserole.  I did also add a good bit of garlic and parmesan cheese to the mix and then sprinkled cheese on top.  YUMMY, YUMMY!

This recipe was delicious.  I don't like spinach per se, but the whole family was amazed at how good this was.  I plan to use it as a side on Thanksgiving.  I did add about 3 pinches of dry minced garlic and sprinkled some Parmesan cheese in the mixture before transferring it into the casserole dish.  This was quick, easy, and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe =]

This turned out very good, I had a big bag of elbow macaroni I wanted to get used, also wanted to warm up the house by using the oven for something other than cake or cookies.  
I added a can of chicken breast as well as a little cardamom.  It makes alot, a 9x13" pan FULL/ which means leftovers for days

It’s more a soufflé than a casserole in my opinion. I added garlic powder, thyme and nutmeg. I also added bacon as a garnish with the cheese topping in the last ten minutes of the bake. A wonderfully fluffy and sophisticated dish that can be a meal on its own and is great as a reheated leftover for breakfast.

This is REALLY yummy! I made it as another suggested - used roasted garlic  cream of mushroom soup. Panicked, thinking maybe I had OVER-flavored it with that tweak, given the french fried onions, but it turned out so creamy and delicious - drooling just thinking about the leftovers waiting for me! : )

Add bacon! This is a great recipe  - as is - but for added flavor I substituted Cream of Bacon soup. Next time I might add some bacon bits too. I also agree with others who have suggested this is too creamy -  - - -  use 3 - 4 pkgs of spinach with the same amounts of other ingredients.

I used about 10-oz bag fresh spinach because I didn't have frozen on hand. I halved the cream cheese and cream of mushroom soup. Just eye-balled the french fried onions. Turned out very tasty. Next time I'll use a little more spinach.

I made this recipe with a bag of fresh spinach (6 oz), 4 oz of cream cheese and half a can of cream of mushroom soup. I added some cooked bacon pieces into the mix along with the fried onion rings. Then topped with more onion rings. Using fresh spinach gave this dish a different spin...kind of wilted spinach with all the other yummy ingredients.

I changed this a lot but used all the ingredients. I sauted onion and portabella mushrooms in Olive oil. Then added 4 cubed chicken breasts cooked all in a large skillet with garlic, seasoning salt, and pepper. I made rice cooked in chicken broth. Mixed all ingredients together with the cream cheese, spinach, doubled the cream of mushroom, and added mozzarella cheese. Put it all in a 9x13 baking dish and topped with the onions. I baked it for 45 minutes. Very tasty and filling.

Fantastic recipe! It is the perfect comfort food, and so easy to make. My only tip it to make sure to get as much water out of the spinach as you can. The drier the better to keep it from seeming soggy or too creamy. One of my all time favorite recipes so be sure to give it a try.

A nice thanksgiving substitute for my traditional brocolli casserole.  I used cream of brocolli soup since my daughter won't touch mushrooms, doubt you could tell the difference.

I've been making this for years.  I find it too creamy with the 8 oz of cream cheese, so I have modified by using only 4 oz of neufchatel cream cheese (the lighter cream cheese, but not the fat-free stuff).  I also use cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom as my husband hates mushrooms.  I let the cream cheese come to room temperature while I'm thawing the spinach.  I have also subbed canned spinach in a pinch, but the chopped, frozen spinach is preferable.

I followed the directions to the letter. Unfortunately, this was not a hit with me or anyone in my home. Something was missing with the flavor. I'll try to make it again in the future, because I love spinach, but with adjustments.

I used two bunches of fresh spinach and steamed them in chicken stock along with some baby bella mushrooms (sliced). Yum!

Loving spinach and those little crispy onions I thought we would really enjoy this dish, but perhaps the soup was overpowering - possibly from having fresh ingredients in other spinach dishes we have made?  Maybe I just don't care for canned soup recipes? Sorry, still searching.

Even better than I thought it would taste as I'm not a huge spinach lover.  I used Cream of Asparagus soup since many in my family don't like mushroom.  I also added some dried garlic and some grated parmesan cheese.  I didn't make any other changes to the recipe.

If I make this again, I will either add another 10 oz spinach or some chopped onion and tomato instead.

really think this recipe is 3.5 stars...  Definitely add some seasoning to your spinach.  I used garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper.  I also added a cheese layer on top- Swiss and mozzarella- which really added something to the recipe. I will more than likely make again and will consider bacon to make this even better!

Scaling apparently doesn't go lower than one (1 can, 1 pkg, etc.), so attempting to halve the recipe and use one package of spinach, I accidently used double the amount of soup and cream cheese as were recommended.  I also added a clove and a half of garlic, and only used 4 oz of onions, which were plenty.  This got rave reviews, anyway.
