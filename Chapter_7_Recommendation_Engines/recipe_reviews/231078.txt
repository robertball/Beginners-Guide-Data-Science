I thought this was a good dressing and liked that it made just a small portion. It does taste like salad dressing and not honey mustard as it doesn't have the mayonnaise. It has a little bit of a tart bite though. It was a different change to an oily or creamy type dressings.

this vinaigrette was very good!  Be aware that the recipe is a little more on the Dijon side than the sweet side so it's got kick to it.  I just added more honey to balance it out and it was delicious :-)

I made this twice (the yield is small, and I had some red wine vinegar to use up), so I had it on a bunch of salads for lunch. I'm kind of conflicted - to me, the taste was just OK - I'm not a big fan of mustard. But I see that others think this is great - it certainly looks good on paper. It was worth trying, anyway.

I doubled the ingredients as it makes a small amount. Good and simple recipe.

Incredibly quick and easy to make, tasted great.  Glad to find a recipe that didn't include mayo.

Simple (and quick) to make, but full of flavor!  My wife tends to like things tangy, and I tend to like things sweet -- we both enjoyed this as a salad dressing.  (I suppose if someone felt it was too tangy, they could just up the honey content...)

I've been looking for a dressing like this in grocery stores forever!! The ones I purchases from cheap to gourmet, did not even compare to this one.  I could almost drink it was so delicious.  Next time, I'll increase the serving size.

I am a big fan of tangy dressings and love Dijon, so, I knew this would be a good recipe for me!  I served it as a sauce to accompany  roasted asparagus, but, it I will be making it again to drizzle over salad.   This was not your typical honey mustard because it definitely had more of a tangy zip than a sweet flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  I doubled the recipe, and added more honey to make it a bit less tangy. Went really well with my roast turkey breast and Gouda cheese garden salad!

Flavors did not meld, and wine vinegar was too strong.

I liked it, but needed to add a bit more honey for my taste. Otherwise, this is a keeper.

It was very tasty for a healthier dressing. I added 1 T of honey instead of 1 tsp. very quick and easy to mix up.

This is fantastic... I made it with steamed broccoli,  fresh red onions,  and radishes,  as a cold salad....I had to make more!  My friends are snobs....and it went over so well.  I love garlic,  I have about 7 bulbs of it at all times.  I used jarred minced garlic.  It made it slightly sweeter...which balances the bitter of broccoli,  and the sharpness of the onion and radish
