People who claim this eggnog has too much alcohol need to understand that this is the New Orleans version. This is the only eggnog I like. I'm thinking about eliminating the amaretto and reducing the amount of nutmeg for a more traditional taste.

This is AMAZING eggnog!  The best!  There is a real chemistry as to why it takes 30 days to mellow. Enjoy!
