This was very good. I had some leftover Three Cheese Garlic Scalloped Potatoes, so I used those. I only used 8 eggs and even then we had some left over. I used onion powder instead of onions, 1/2 teaspoon paprika instead of 2 teaspoons, and threw in a teaspoon of dried cilantro instead of celery salt. I sprinkled some shredded parmesan/romano cheese over the top during the last 5 minutes. I like the way it puffed up on the edges, and the flavor was very good. I think it would be better with cheese, and I think I'll try it next time with some Gruyere. Thanks for the recipe Frances!

This was very good and so easy to make!  I used one bag of Bob Evans home fries (20 oz. bag). I also used egg beaters instead of eggs (can't tell the difference), and I layered mozzarella on top of potato/onion/bacon/ham and then poured egg mixture on top of that.  I left out the beef b/c I didn't have any.  Next time I would use only 2 tablespoons of parsley and add cilantro or garlic powder! Thanks for this recipe. I will make it again and it was so easy. I used a calphalon 12" omelet pan and that worked very well. Was in oven for 30 mins.

Whenever friends come over to stay with me, one of the first things they ask is if we are having this for breakfast the next day. I adore this recipe.

I made this for a UCONN Tailgate party and worked out great for reheat and eat. I added some cheese and little veggies the second time i made it.
