Excellent crust! It was very soft and easy to roll out, but nice and chewy once cooked.  I used the footnote also for the dry active yeast.
**I've also now made the recipe as written with the Rapid Rise yeast twice and it's so easy and delicious.  Since the price is the same for dry active and rapid rise, I'm now buying the rapid rise.  I also made 2 batches last time and used one for breadsticks by pressing the dough into a small cookie sheet pan, scoring with a pizza cutter and brushing on olive oil, dried oregano and basil, garlic powder and salt and pepper. I baked them for about 20 minutes at 400° and they were delicious!

I could not believe how wonderful this dough turned out.  My husband's family has made pizza every Saturday night for decades.  It usually takes between 2-2 1/2 hrs to complete a pizza.  It's always delicious, but sometimes you need pizza faster!  So I threw my hand in with this dough and it was so yummy.  Crunch on the outside, soft in the middle.  Make my own pizza sauce, put some garlic salt and parmesan cheese around the crust and VOILA!  Very good!  Will use often.

No complaints here. I made this recipe in my Kitchen Aid, using the bread hook to knead the dough. I did not use the cornmeal, only because I forgot. I spread half the dough out onto my cookie baking sheet (for a thin crust) and prebaked it for 5 minutes before topping it. My boys ate two pieces each in less than five minutes. I would say it was a hit! Next time, I'll try the garlic herb version.

For a very basic dough that's easy to make and extremely soft after baking, you're definitely in the right place. I found, however, that just the plain dough was a little too ordinary, so I spiced it up a bit and added some minced garlic, basil, and a little bit more salt when the dough was being made. After I put it in the pan and had all the toppings on it, I brushed the crust with some melted butter and sprinkled garlic powder and Parmesan cheese before putting it into the oven. Amazing.

this is the only pizza dough recipe I'm using now , the crust is chewy in the middle and crispy from the outside . the only change I make is to let the dough rise for 30 min , I use air bake pizza pan which makes the bottom crispy , but in my oven it take only 15 mins . try it with " Exquisite Pizza Sauce" recipe from this site it's my favorite one . if U make pizza and bread more frequently like me try to buy the rapid yeast from a whole club sale like Sam's club , Costco and Smart and final it's a large package but it's way cheaper , just keep it in the fridge after opening . one envelope of yeast= 2+1/8 teaspoon of yeast from the large package.

I love this recipe. I have done "lots" of stuff to the dough, ie additions like, minced fresh garlic, roasted garlic, herbs, you name it- it takes it all and is always consistent. I found with my oven the cheese would start to brown before the crust was done so now I sauce and top the pizza (9x13, deep dish style on parchment paper) bake for 15 min, remove, add the cheese and bake until the crust is golden and the cheese all melted.  PERFECTION!!!! I don't even have to look up this recipe, its committed to memory- so easy and so good. If your looking for a pizza dough recipe try this one. You'll be very happy with it.

My family and I were delighted with this recipe. I made a 14", cheese pizza and it only took 10 minutes to cook. I followed the footnotes for using dry active yeast.

To make the dough, I used regular yeast (not rapid rise), following the footnote directions. It was very simple to make. However, I dont think the recipe calls for enough salt. Also, 2.5 cups of flour was too much.... I only ended up using about 21/8 cups of flour.

This is a very good and easy pizza crust that made the perfect foundation for the simple toppings I used of sauce, sun dried tomatoes, sautéed onions and mozzarella cheese.   I prefer to cook the pizza on the grill to mimic the brick oven flavor.  If you decide to cook it on the grill, oil the grill, use half the recipe at a time because it’s easier to handle, cook one side about two to three minutes, flip it over and then put on your toppings on the partially cooked side.  Cook it covered until the mozzarella is melted.  It’s delicious.

I have tried numerous pizza dough recipes, and just loved this one! If you prefer a chewier/crispy crust, this one is for you. I did use a 12" pan, so my crust was a tad thin. However, I don't care for thick/soft bread like crusts, esp the ones with sugar. So, it worked perfect for me. I actually felt this was going to turn out, so I doubled the recipe. I used one dough ball and froze the other 3 in separate bread bags to use later. That was very handy. NOTE: Make sure to use RapidRise yeast with this recipe. I normally use ActiveDry, but will make this one acception from now on for pizza crust. It not only made a tasty crust, but I got to go from mixing to using it right away after it sat for only 10 minutes. It had no affect on the crust either.

I made this recipe last night and used the garlic herb option.  I used 2t of Italian seasoning, 2t of minced garlic, & 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese.  The crust was soft and very flavorable.  Would like to try this again using a whole wheat flour or adjusting to a multi-grain recipe.  Big hit with the family...Try it for yourself!

I followed the directions to the t, but realized after I was done that my yeast was the regular kind, so I let the dough rise for 30 min instead of 10.
It came out FABULOUS, and my husband and I had a hard time not wolfing it down like beasts...

Perfect for Breadsticks!  Used this recipe exactly as stated for active dry yeast, per the footnote, and made amazing breadsticks!  I flattened them out on a baking sheet, made sticks with a pizza cutter, sprinkled on some garlic powder and italian seasoning.  I took them out before they were brown so they would still be soft, coated them in melted butter, parmesean cheese, and a little extra garlic powder.  My husband said they were the best breadsticks he'd ever had!  I couldn't believe how good they turned out!  We can't wait to try it as a pizza crust!

Delicious! Very easy and soft!
 I double the dough and I saved 2 pre-cooked pizzas in the the freezer. I didn't have RapidRise yeast and found the footnote on how to use the Active Dry yeast confusing... So I just proofed my yeast with the warm water then I added the rest of the ingredients. I used my mixer to make the dough.

Really good; I doubled the recipe, however it was a bit too much flour using the scaled amounts, about a half cup less. Made 4 pizzas, but on the smaller side. Would have been 3 good size pizzas. Added garlic and onion powder to dough just for an extra bit of flavor. Baked at 425 degrees for 15 minutes on  a pizza stone; gave it slightly chewy texture with a nice crisp on bottom.

So very easy to make, easy to spread to cover the pan.  I make the dough as directed, however, I cook it differently.  I have made an alfredo veggie pizza and also a bbq chicken pizza and it was great for both types of pizza.   I start with cooking just the dough in the pizza pan brushed with just a very light bit of olive oil and a sprinkle of italian seasoning.  Bake at reccomentded temp about 5 min, it will feel "dry" to the touch.  I then add the toppings (I have used pre- cooked toppings) and reduce the heatto 350 and bake until cheese is melty and slightly golden... crust will be a light golden as well. This makes the crust soft, as this is how I like my crust.  It is done throughout, not "doughy" in the middle.  It even stays soft after being refrigerated!  Also, the pizza crust doesnt take that long, probably an additional 10 minutes after adding the toppings.

This is the only pizza dough recipe I use. As written, I think it's amazing. However, I've made some modifications to make it even better, over many, many times of making the recipe: 

I use bread flour, for one. This makes a crust with an even better texture than the original. I sometimes omit the olive oil, or of I do keep it in I cut it down to about 2 tsp. I often add in a tsp or so of garlic powder as well. I never use cornmeal, as I have a pizza stone and that works great. Additionally, in my house this makes two pizzas--one the day the dough is made, while the rest of the dough is frozen until the next pizza night.

Overall, this is a really great recipe, even without the changes.

This was the best dough recipe I've found on this site. Put it in my bread machine and the dough was remarkably easy to work with when I rolled it out. I was able to get it thin like I like it! This will be my go-to from now on!

This crust turned out ok, but I don't think it's the best to be used with a bread machine.  I doubled the recipe (which then made 2 big pizzas).  In the beginning, I had to add almost a whole cup of extra flour because it was too wet.  Then after the process in the machine, I had to add more flour to be able to roll it out without it being too sticky.  I didn't see any other reviews that had this problem, so I'm assuming it's either because the recipe can't be doubled or because I did it in the bread machine.  I did bake it at 400 for 25 minutes, but in order to get the dough to cook enough, the topping had to brown more than I would have liked.  I still gave this recipe 4 stars though, because the taste of the crust (I did add some garlic powder and dry herbs) is very good and it has a crunchy outside and soft inside.  I probably won't use it again though, just because I like to use my bread machine so I'll have to find a better recipe for it.

WOW...FANTASTIC! This is definitely one of, if not THE BEST pizza dough I have ever made. I did need to add an extra 1/2 cup flour to get it to the right consistency, but that was my only change. I mixed it all up in the kitchen aid, making this even easier to make than it already is. The dough is beautiful to work with. This is my new go-to dough recipe~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

A really great dough to work with!  I put the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook, and it did all the work.  I added the sweet basil flakes to the dough, and it was a nice addition.  I've made this crust a few times.  I've even made it and froze the dough in a ball.  I just let it rise as it thaws and roll it out on the pizza pan.  No complaints at all with this crust.

We used to buy 'just add water' pizza dough mix in a pouch...no more!  This is soooo much better and less expensive.

Made this tonight to turn into garlic knots, another recipe from this site, and it was fantastic! I can't wait to make it again for pizza or calzones. Because I made this dough for another recipe I did season it up with granulated garlic, dried basil and oregano and it worked really well. I did add a bit of honey to the warm water when I proofed my yeast and will do so again next time I make this dough even if I go back to the original recipe (ie no spices/herbs added). All in all a fast, easy, quality recipe.

Best dough I've had, be it in a restaurant or at home! It's very light, so be prepared to make a thick crust if you intend on using a healthy portion of toppings.  I've used both Rapid-Rise and regular yeast, and both result in a similar product: the only difference is that the regular yeast must be prepped (with warm water and sugar) before being added to the flour. With the Rapid-Rise yeast, this is done very quickly, almost quickly enough that you can preheat the oven after kneading. I used a KitchenAid dough hook for the kneading work, and it worked just fine; you may want to add the extra 1/2 cup flour slowly with this method, though. This will help keep extra dough off the bottom.

This is THE best pizza dough recipe I have found and deserves more than 5 stars.  I have made it many times and it always turns out great.  I start with 2c of flour but add more until the dough is soft and rolls out well.  I usually add some garlic powder to the dough for a little extra taste.  The crust tastes just like fresh baked bread.  We have not ordered pizza delivery since I have discovered this recipe...as I can now make my own (and better tasting) pizza in about the same amt of time it takes me to whip up this dough and add the toppings!  The slices seem to fill you up more than a regular pizza slice does though.. I am stuffed after 2 pieces.

This dough is a great base for whatever savory dough you need. I added Italian seasonings, garlic, and some honey into my dough and made 4 personal calzones. Amazing!!

I've made this 3 times and the whole family loves it.  I've tried at least 5 other dough recipes  and this is simple to make, it rolls out easy, and tastes great. It rises up nicely in the oven. I usually doctor it up a bit by adding dried herbs, garlic powder, and onion powder.

I've been using this recipe for my thin crust pizza for about 4 years, but, and there is always a but, I usually use 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose, then, I roll out this crust to make 2 - 16" round crusts. Each crust has a little over 1 cup of flour with 1/2 whole wheat. A low carb pizza crust????

Amazing recipe! The dough is smooth and elastic, making it really easy to work with. Once it's baked, the inside is soft, yet the outside is crusty. Perfect! I made some for supper last night, and everyone loved it so much, that I made it again for lunch today. Definitely a keeper.

Great recipe!! I made this for my 12 year old's birthday slumber party and the girls gobbled it down. Inexpensive and fast!! I added: oregano and garlic powder. Will be making my BBQ chicken pizza on this dough next. Delicious!!

I have been making my own pizza for 25 years.  This is the first dough recipe I've found that doesn't need to rise.  It is my new standard recipe.  My kids, esp. one son, are picky eaters, and they didn't leave any leftovers.  The temperature is very important, use an instant-read thermometer.

this dough was like magic. When I made the dough, I held out 1/2 cup of flour for kneading and thought "boy, I'm going to need more flour",however this dough was so beautiful and I used every grain of the flour, but that was all I needed. It was so beautiful to work with and I have been making pizza for 40 years. Don't hesitate to use this. Roll your dough very thin because it will rise and be "too doughy".

Very good for a tender crust.  Did add some crushed Italian seasonings with the flour.  Made 14 inches and rolled out very easily.  Precooked about 7 minutes before adding toppings and then only 10 or so, until cheese was perfect.

This is a great, quick pizza dough recipe.  I added a little more salt (1 tsp) and some dried Italian seasonings to the dough and it made a difference in the flavor.  Also, I would definitely recommend following the recipe and divide the dough to make two medium size pizzas.  I've tried using all the dough and also 3/4 of the dough, but the middle part of the pizza doesn't cook enough (by the time the outside edges are brown), so the pizza cooks more evenly when the dough is divided and made into two medium size pizzas.

Truly a great recipe for a perfect pizza crust.  It was just the right amount of dough for two deep-dish 10" pizzas.  Made wonderful chewy and soft crust.  I always use Fleischmann's yeast.

I normally buy fresh dough at the market but they were totally out and I needed to make calzones and spinach pies for superbowl Sunday. I used my kitchen ninja to mix all of the ingredients together and it came out perfect.  a 5lb bag of flour will make 6lbs of dough.  we even had enough dough left over to make a white truffle pizza. No more store bought dough for me !!!

Finally a not good but great homemade pizza dough!  I'm new to making homemade pizza but I've gone through far too many okay doughs,  I  was ready to give up.  Today I wanted pizza so thought I'd try one more try and wow am I glad I did!   Thank you so much for sharing.

I have tried this recipe and give it 5 stars.  If you like a crust sturdy enough to pick up and eat...you'll love this one.  Also quick for a homemade crust.  Just tasted like a traditional pizza crust should taste.

OMG this was good and easy.  I used the first footnote method with Active Dry Yeast. After the punch down I rolled 4 mini pizza crusts and froze the other half of the dough.  And then we grilled one side of the dough for a few minutes, brought them inside and added the toppings.  Finished our individual pizzas back on the grill until the cheese is melted.  YUMMY!

This crust was everything I was looking for...crusty on the outside and chewy inside.  I used high-gluten flour which made all the difference for me!

Superb crust. I make this recipe in the food processor, I'll make three of four separate batches and wrap each dough ball with plastic wrap, then foil, and then into the freezer. A ball will defrost overnight in the fridge or an afternoon on the counter, or remove foil and use 10% defrost in the microwave--check every 30 seconds  until dough is defrosted and softened. 

For the freezer crusts I don't bother to warm the water, I use a full teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons of rapid-rise. i never make anything the same way twice and this week I made doughs with one cup AP flour, one cup of bread flour, a half cup of whole wheat and added in as much extra bread flour as was needed to form the dough ball. Hubs loved this batch.

I made the recipe with the directions for the regular active yeast and added rosemary and garlic.  Nice to work with.  However, once baked (on a pizza stone), the texture felt more like breadsticks than the NY style pizza I am used to.

Quick & easy...doesn't need much rise time and it still comes out pretty soft. If you let it rise more, it will be fluffier.

This is my go-to, quick-and-easy pizza to make at home. The recipe is simple and easy, with room for additions (no heavy non-bready flavors fighting each other if I decide to put some roasted garlic into the crust, for example) but good enough on its own.

If you do let it stand a little bit longer than suggested, the dough becomes a bit more airy and light, which I happen to like.

I've tried several pizza doughs lately in search of a keeper. This dough hits the mark with simplicity of preparation together with a good flavor. While there are fancier doughs out there, this one can't be beat for how easy it is to prepare and the good flavor that it has.

I have used this many times with consistent results. I love yeast dough and love not waiting for it to rise twice even more. The right amount of sweetness to use for a calzone and ideally flavored for breadsticks with a hint of rosemary. Perfect for our family, Thanks!

Yum!  Wanted to throw in another great review for this pizza crust - it's easy and delicious, and I live in the NYC, the pizza capital of the world!  Came out perfectly just as written.  Surprised more people have given this tip thought - I pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes, and then put the toppings and cheese on before popping it into the oven for another 10 minutes - this way, the crust was nice and crisp, but the cheese was perfectly melted (not  burned).

Other than that, the instructions are precise, and the taste is amazing!

I'd give 4-1/2 stars if I could but not quite worthy of 5 stars, in my opinion. Super fast & EASY but next time I'll use a full teaspoon of salt & hopefully that'll give it a bit more flavor. I also just thought the texture wasn't quite right...good but not as chewy yet crispy as I like.

Love this pizza dough.  I used regular yeast not rapid rise but did everything else the same, just let rise for an hour before baking.  Delicious and so easy!  Will definitely be making again.

Love this recipe! Just a few ingredients but such a great crust! I follow the recipe as is until the very end. I like a golden crust on my pizza so I usually egg wash the crust and then sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Light and fluffy on the inside but crispy on the outside... overall delicious! An added bonus is you don't have to wait an hour or even longe for the dough to rise... just make it and in the time it takes for you to get your toppings out of the fridge it is ready to use!

Very good recipe (a 3 star ranking means that we would make it again, a 5 means that this is the best we've found - this is a solid 4). We've tried about 10 different pizza dough recipes and this has been the best (so far).  Definitely worth making (and, incredibly easy).

This was really easy and quick to prepare, but it didn't turn out very well for me. The dough was chewy and more like bread bowl texture than the light tender airy crispy pizza crust I was hoping for. This was a little salty but no one mentioned it, so maybe it was just me. We voted not to have this one again as our usual (Jay's signature crust) is soooo much better. Sorry but we just didn't care for this one. As always I enjoyed trying out a new recipe :)

Totally amazing and easy dough!!! LOVE IT, this is going to be my staple dough from now on!  Thanks for sharing!

UPDATE:  Another fantastic turnout!  Kids say this dough "ROCKS". Super easy and super fast pizza.  Faster than take out, healthier than take out and tastes better than take out!  Big savings too, because a pizza here in the Arctic costs $45 bucks and I can make it for less than $15!!!

Very easy, followed directions as listed. Did not need to use footnote, and it came out excellent. Rolled out very nice. Used 6 string cheese cut in half, and made stuffed crust pizza. Pricked dough with fork, brushed with olive oil, and brushed with crushed garlic clove also. The cornmeal on bottom is really good. Is a really easy and good crust, will make again.

I've been using this recipe for our pizza at home for a couple of years.  This is by far the easiest recipe I can imagine is out there for pizza.  It's easy to make this to your liking - thick, thin, one pizza or stretch it to 2.  I now add about 1 tsp garlic powder and 2 tsp basil to the dough mix which really makes this tasty.  This dough is hardy enough to use any sauce or toppings you desire.  I love this homemade pizza!  Delivery doesn't compare to what you can do at home with this dough base.  We haven't ordered delivery since I started using this recipe.  Try it.  It's easier than you think.  And by far, fresher tasting than you'll ever get from a chain pizza place.

This it's my go to for pizza crust.  I live in Florida and have issues with dough rising.  I have to use 2 packages of yeast to get what I would get in the Midwest.  It is an incredibly versatile crust.  If you don't want to use sugar use honey.  If you want a more flavorful crust add fresh garlic and Italian seasoning.  I tend to use most of the dough on one pizza and then make a smaller one with the rest.  U have a 16" pizza pan.  I also have to heat up the granite countertop with a heating pad to let it rise.  I love this recipe.

You need way more flour than it says or to use less water. It was way too sticky to even use.

This is so easy! The crust comes out nice an crispy. I doubled the recipe and made pizza with leftovers from the fridge. The BBQ pulled pick was the favorite. Looks like we might be adding this one into our regular rotation.

The taste was very bland. Next time I'll add more salt and maybe some spices. The texture, though, was pretty awesome. Despite rapid fire mixing, kneading, sticking it on a sheet pan, covering it in toppings, and baking, it was perfectly fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Thrilled it works in less than the usual two hour minimum for most pizza recipes.

I've made it twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and loved it.  The second time, I replaced half of the flour with whole wheat flour and it tasted the same, but I loved it more because I knew it was healthier.

one word....Fabulous!  Easy to make, soft delicious crust.  I used the footnote for the active dry yeast and my kitchen aide blender with the bread hook.  My family has tried many pizzas and many crusts, this was one of the top 5 of all time and I live in NY where they make some of the best pizza in the world.

This crust is very easy and quick to make.  I do like that, but it just tasted so plain. Next time I will need to add garlic butter around the edges or something.

Excellent recipe. Cooked all the way through. Chewy, yet crispy. Leftovers are great. Didn't use cornmeal. And next time I might bake the dough for 10 mins without toppings, then add the toppings and bake for another 10 or so mins (just to experiment) I can't wait to make more (I have a lot of sauce). ...unless I freeze the sauce. And I used the 'Easy Pizza Sauce 3' from this site; with a few variations.

I use this Recipe weekly at my church for the men's and youth groups that meet there.  I am making anywhere from 5-9 "16 Pizza's weekly.  
The dough has great elasticity, and can be hand tossed or spun without the need for rolling first. the crust is perfect for a 16" pan pizza.  I have not used it to do a deep dish, but the dough is just fantastic so I can't imagine anything other than perfection.  I love the fact that there is no perishables in this recipe, and I still get a fantastic wholesome product.
I did need to do some conversions from volume to weight (Create consistency for making it in volume and makes pricing out the recipe easier, something I am used to doing anyways),  but on the whole,fantastic easy recipe.

FANTASTIC recipe! I used my kitchen aid and bread spiral to make the dough and it came out great. I also used garlic infused olive oil to give it a little extra flavor. Very soft dough and it cooked perfectly.

Quite good!  but have a hard time getting the bottom crust to brown but that might just be my oven.  I always use regular yeast and only let the dough rest for 10min - hubby and I prefer a thicker, softer crust.

I add all the ingredients (using cold water) into the bread maker, and put it on the dough setting for 20 minutes, give or take. Always turns out perfect.

This is a great recipe! I'm 15 and it is very easy to follow and create. I use it every time I make pizza for dinner and everyone loves it! I even substituted half of the all purpose flour with whole wheat and it still tasted great! I recommend to cook it in the oven for 23 minutes for the best results (although other oven temps. might be a little different).

Absolutely hands down the best crust I have ever made! The only "Extra" I did was brush the side of the crust with a little melted butter and sprinkled it with parmesan cheese. It was Excellent, this will be a staple for sure! It rose perfectly, had the perfect texture crispy yet chewy and soft on the inside and the bottom withheld all of the topping without getting soggy at all! Hands down 5 star rating!

This is my go to recipe, easy and fast, I add garlic,oregano and onion powder to the dough and I like it better than take out. I have pizza at least twice a month and always have half recipe in freezer.

Very very good.  I used pizza yeast and added a small amount of sugar but rose lovely and cooked amazingly.  Also used mushroom and sage infused olive oil that have it a lovely flavour.

We all loved this crust!  I didn't do any of the variations in the footnotes except to follow the directions to use active dry yeast.  Next time I will give the garlic and herb dough a try, I think it will be even more delicious :)

This is an excellent basic pizza dough recipe, and easy to put together for a last minute meal or snack.   Since I like variety, I've also added various herbs to the dough. Usually 1/4 teaspoon each of chives, basil, oregano, garlic, rosemary, thyme....whatever you like in whatever combination you're in the mood for. The herbed-up dough makes for great pizza sticks for dipping.

This is an easy quick recipe. I preheat my pizza stone while preparing to dough. I followed the recipe but added some garlic and extra salt. I pre-cook my meat (sausage) and veggies but not all the way because they will finish cooking in the oven. I do this to get fat, grease or excess water out so the pizza doesn't get soggy and heavy. Then I roll my dough and put it on the stone. Next I put sauce, meat and veggies on first, brush crust with olive oil and bake for 10 minutes. Then I add fresh herbs and cheese and cook it another 8-10 minutes. Cooking times will vary depending on your stove or whether you use a pan or stone. Our crust was thin and crispy and delicious.

I made this with regular yeast and mistakenly used the rapid rise recipe but it still came out beautifully. Excellent recipe that I will use from now on!

Very Delicious! I have made this dough two times already, and I am getting ready to make it a third time. I let the dough rise in a warm spot for a little over an hour. I find that it is important to put the dough in a greased dish and cover it when it is rising. I tried letting it rise on a  floured surface, but my dough dried out, kinda like play-dough. Also- I tried using whole wheat flour in the dough and it didn't turn out too well. Every time I make this for my family, the pizza turns out great and it is gone in a flash!

W O W !!!! Not enough adjectives to describe how good this is. If it comes out wrong or blah, it is completely the cook's fault as this recipe is flawless. I don't have a pizza stone (but will be getting one after this) so used a round cookie sheet and pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes @ 400. After adding toppings, I returned the pizza to the oven, still at 400 for 15 minutes. I then brushed the crust with melted butter/garlic powder mixture and cooked it @ 425 for 5 more minutes. Crunchy and soft, amazing flavor (I added garlic powder and dry grated parmesan cheese while making the crust). EVERYONE said it was the best homemade pizza they ever had! So thrilled to have found this recipe, there is no going back. Thank you so much for sharing!

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe exact (used the active dry yeast). This crust is good for the BBQ as it holds together great on a BBQ pizza pan.

I gave this 4 stars because I tweaked the yeast method.  I prefer to let the yeast rise before adding it.  Other than that, the recipe is great.  I used it to make a stromboli,  the dough was very light and rolled out easily. The quantity is just enough to make a large pizza. This will be my go to recipe for homemade pizza.

I didn't have yeast and it turned out ok. I added 1 cup flat beer instead. Had to add more flour to make the dough roll softer. Used my hands to knead.  That's it!

Easy, and tastes great. What more could you want. I usually don't have time to wait as I tend to prepare on the fly too often so I try to pick recipes that are quick. This recipe is quick and it doesn't compromise the crust whatsoever. I use grape seed oil instead of olive oil and it works wonderfully.   Never had a complaint and don't believe I ever will.

My husband has been complaining that I can't make pizza.  We decided to try this after reading all the great reviews.  Everyone is right.  This turned out great!  

I put it in the oven for a few minutes to brown before putting the toppings on.  I also found it a little plain so next time I will be adding herbs to the dough.  Guess what we will be having for Super Bowl?

Wonderful recipe! I doubled the recipe, added dried herbs and garlic powder. I used rapid rise yeast. By the time I finished prepping the toppings (about 15 min) the dough had risen beautifully. It made enough dough for 2 large pizzas and a large breadsticks. The resulting pizza crust was amazing: slightly crispy/ chewy on the outside, soft on the inside, and flavorful. I will use this easy recipe over and over!

I have been using this recipe for a few months now. It's easy and fast to make. I made two changes that have made the crust just like fresh from the pizzeria . First I added 2 Tblsp gluten flour to the mix. I use my kitchen aid and I knead the dough on med for 6 minutes or so. I also found that if I have my water at 120 and not 126 - 130 my dough was way more tender. The most important thing I do is I cook my pizza on the bottom rack of the oven at 535 degrees  for 12 to 14 min. It turns out crisp on the outside and chewy and light on the inside. So yummy! We make pizza at least three times a month now! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent crust.  Mixed up very well and rolled out perfectly. I brushed the crust with garlic butter and sprinkles parmesan cheese on it.  A definite keeper.

A winner every time. I use half whole wheat instead of all white flour and it's still great. This is now my go-to recipe when we have no idea what to make!

We make pizza every Friday and this is by at the best recipe. It's nice in a time crunch, but you can also let it set for a bit. The dough is light. I also added garlic olive oil and parmagean around the crust. Perfecto!

Great pizza dough. I used regular yeast and the outer crust was pretty hard when it first got done. Next time I will try the quick yeast.

Delicious!  I used this dough for Easy pull Apart Pizza Bread and my kids love it.   I tried Pizza Dough I recipe and it was too dry.  I decided to try this recipe (Master Pizza Dough) and it was much moist and more delicious.  I highly recommend this recipe than Pizza Dough I recipe!

This is a great Pizza dough. I use a 16" pizza pan.I roll the dough out in the pan using a smooth glass drinking cup sprayed with pam on the outside of the glass. Roll from the center out.Also wipe a thin layer of shortning on the pizza pan,before shaking on the cornmeal.This gives a nice tan crust under the pizza.

Best pizza dough I've ever made.  I use the kitchenaid to knead.  Makes two thin crust pizzas, I precook them for five mins on a pizza stone, flip them and top the "flat" side.  Brush with oil and a little salt before topping.
Shredded cheese, shrimp scampi(precooked and sliced in half), green onion and a little julienned prosciutto...best pizza I have ever eaten, litterally.

I love this dough! I ended up using the whole 2.5 cups flour but used bread flour not all-purpose. I found I needed to only bake it 15 min in my gas oven at 425 degrees. Delicious!

This was the easiest way to make dough that I have tried! It is by far the least time consuming and produced the best results! I add about two Tbsp of sugar for a sweeter dough. The cornmeal made the dough easier to roll out as opposed to just using flour.

Turned out great, I added garlic powder and Oregano to the dough. I made some roasted garlic by making a pouch of garlic. using an entire garlic clove flurette  chopping off the the top end pouring a tsp of olive oil on and wrapping in tin foil. Make sure it's sealed oven at 400 for 30 min. Then before I put the sauce on I wipe the roasted garlic across the crust. Then sauce then cheese then toppings delicious!

Wonderful, Simple & Versatile! I have made as originally printed numerous times and enjoyed but have now incorporated my own twists which I prefer.  I use it for all types of dishes that require a savory crust and vary the herbs/spices to dishes. I only use 2 c. A.P. Flour, Rapid Rise yeast, 3/4 c. warm (temp checked water 120-130F), add 1/2 tsp. of sugar to dry ingredients, (split 1/2 tsp. salt & 1/2 tsp. garlic salt, add other herbs/spices, whisk all dry ingredients & yeast, add 3/4 c. water, mix it with a wooden spoon to incorporate all flour, then pour in the olive oil, slather my clean hands with olive oil & start kneading in bowl to mix in oil & get glutens working about 5 to 7 min.  I make it the evening before, oil it, wrap in plastic wrap & Lg. Ziploc bag & put into fridge to slow rise.  (can sit about 3 days in fridge) About 2 hrs. before I am ready to start using it, I will bring out, divide into portions on floured parchment paper.. brush with oil flatten/stretch a bit, oil with olive oil, then cover with plastic wrap & allow to rest.  When ready to use, flour clean hands, pick up dough and place into greased pan & shape with fingers or use rolling pin over plastic wrap while sitting on counter. (Roll out fairly thin, it does rise a fair amount.)  When making small pizza's/calzones, I use my toaster/combo oven & bake @ 450 on greased parchment paper dusted with cornmeal, place on a pre-heated upside down pizza tray (no pizza stone). Awesome results always!

I failed to noticed this recipe called for "rapid rise" yeast (no wonder my dough looked so small!) but it still came out delicious. I didn't not use any cornmeal since I don't have any and I did lightly coat the dough w/ oil before baking although it still stuck to the foil on the pan. Good recipe & quick!

I have made this several times and it's very good pizza dough and easy to make. I used 1 Tbsp. Veg oil and 1 Tbsp Olive oil. I don't seem to have much luck with the regular yeast, so I use the rapid rise and it works great.

So easy even my children can do it!  This is such a good basic recipe, and rolls out perfectly.  I roll it into a "jelly roll" pan. I doubled it, and made one crust to put in the fridge for a later date (which happened to be two days).  It was great then too, and made for a super quick dinner.  Next time, I will freeze one, and see how that goes.  Highly recommended recipe.

Great recipe!  I doubled it and made a pan pizza using a cast iron skillet and bread sticks. I oiled the skillet and formed the dough added BBQ sauce, cheese, onions and shredded chicken.  Put the skillet on top of the stove with a high flame to warm the cast iron then put it in the hot ove to finish cooking. The pizza cust came out super crispy and had great flavor.

This was the best pizza crust I have ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly (almost-- I added a tsp of sugar).  I did let it over rise- because I was waiting on DH to get home.  I punched it down and divided it in two for the two thin crusts.  I used a pizza stone that was pre-heated with the oven.  I used oiled parchment paper to roll out the dough with my fingers and then added the toppings.  I then pulled the preheated stone from the oven and slid the pizza onto the stone, leaving it on the paper.  It turned out crispy and thin, and was browned perfectly on the edges of the crust and even underneath.  Great kudos received from DH.

Great recipe!! I used "unbleached flour" and Fleischmann's "Pizza Crust Yeast"  and the yeast was ready in FIVE minutes.  Wow I was so impressed with this yeast.  I covered my dough with light kitchen towels and I let the dough rise for 45 minutes.  Perfect for sure.

Didn't have the rapid yeast so followed the instructions for the regular one and used the herbs in the crust.  Thought it was pretty good.  It was a little bland so next time I would add more salt and maybe a little sugar/honey.  I made it a little thicker than I wanted so next time, I would use a bit more than half for thin crust.

This is the ONLY recipe I've used for pizza. It's fantastic. I only use whole wheat flour and I make it in my food processor. From start to finish it's 10 minutes and then think of all the toppings you can put on from your pantry. Enjoy!

This was a delicious tasting crust.  Nice and crispy.  My pizza was a 4, but I still gave this a 5 because I think it was the rapid rise yeast and I made it to early so it didn't have the second rise....Pizza was a little thin. But that would have been my fault.  It was still the best tasting crust I have made.

This was good. :) Edited to add: I keep making this. I don't know why. It always turns out well, especially on my silpat. I like to add 2 cloves of garlic and a few shakes of italian seasoning to the dough as it's mixing. I always double this for our family of 7.

This is my first home made pizza I make and this recipe is a keeper. The crust turned out to be very soft, although to me a little bit too salty (next time I will use less salt). I didn't have rapid rise yeast, I used reg. yeast and it's winter, so I let it rise outside under the sun (covered with stainless steel bowl), still it rose beautifully. Definitely will make again. Thank you for the recipe.

This is fab! My 17 year old daughter who won't eat any leftover even asked the night after I made this is there was any left. She ate the leftovers of this pizza. I used is to make Margaretta pizza. After it was layed out into the pan, I baked the crust for 10 minutes and then put olive oil, garlic, tomatoes and lots of pizza cheese on top. Placed it in the oven and baked for another 15 minutes. It is yummy!

This pizza dough has really nice texture and the right amount of fluffiness. I did the original recipe version first, and it wasn't anything special taste-wise. I then did the garlic-herbed version (I used 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tablespoon of rosemary). The bottom tasted like foccacia. Heavenly! The ordinary version is a 4; the herbed version is a 5.

For homemade pizza dough, this one is the best. I have tried many, many homemade recipes and this one has the best taste and texture. I used olive oil. It is easy to work with. It makes 2 large round pizzas with a medium sized edge crust. YUM!

I added 3+ cups of flour, and the crust ended up more like bread.  Oops.
I added in 2 tsp Italian seasoning and 2 cloves minced garlic.  Next time I will make the garlic into a paste.

Pretty good stuff! This was my first ever attempt at using any type of yeast and I was freaked out! I only had some bread machine yeast but I found it worked just fine. 
I was happy with the outcome of the crust and it could not have been any easier to make even for a newbie. I do think that I'll play around and add some spices or something to it next time though because it didn't really have much flavor. The consistency made up for the lack of flavor for me though. I believe this is meant to just be a starter recipe and you can play with it till it's just how you like it. Thanks SO much for getting me to finally try a recipe with yeast and for starting a new weekly tradition at my house!

I was able to make two large sized pizzas.  The crust was delicious.  I added 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning to the flour mix prior to mixing it with the wet ingredients. I was sad we were leaving town for 2 weeks and had to throw left overs away :( This is my go to recipe for pizza crusts!

Very easy pizza dough.  I have made several times--once exactly as recipe was written.  Turned out perfect.  Next I made w/ a few changes--soaked the yeast in water before adding to flour, added Italian seasoning and garlic and used my Kitchenaid to knead the dough. This made a very tasty crust.  I highly recommend this basic dough recipe for a perfect pizza!

This recipe tells to put the yeast dry in with the flour. I did 2 diferent batches. One I soaked the yeast , One I did as it tells, dry. My biggest suggestuion is to soak the yeast in that 1cup of warm water for 10 minutes then mix. Your Crust will rise better and after baked it holds a better texture too.

Really good recipe! easy, quick and still tastes great. I made four personal pizzas for each of my four kids (they loved that) I made two thin(er) crusts and two average crusts and each were terrific. I did add garlic and oregano to two crusts but the original was just as good. Will definitely use this recipe again!

This was easy to work with and the end result was a chewy but not too thick, soft crust.  I found the flavor to be very good - not bland like some homeade doughs.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  The best results I have had with a dough that you can have in the oven within 20 minutes of starting the meal.  I split the flour evenly between regular and whole wheat and added about 2 teaspoons of white sugar.  Delicious.  I also oil the pan not so "lightly" with olive oil and skip the corn meal.  But that is a matter of taste.  Great recipe!

This crust was wonderful and easy! I used regular yeast and it rose fine, but I will buy the rapid rise in the future to save time. I made this with the basil and oregano herbs. It was a nice touch. I made this with Easy Pizza Sauce III from this site. Delicious! I will not be making dough out of a box again!

This recipe definitely rates 5 stars for taste and ease of preparation.  If, like me, you've been afraid to try making your own dough, put your fears to rest and try this.  I will never order in another pizza now that I know how easy it is to prepare.

I used yeast instead of eggs but other than that, everyone loved the pizza. In fact, my baby sister asked for more the next day. I'm going to try it with a huge baking sheet to see if I could get at least one slice this time. Everyone ate it last time before I finished cleaning up. Ultra easy just remember to roll on a heavily floured counter and it will be perfect. At least perfect on a thirteen year old girl's standards.

Good! didn't rise as much as i would have liked- probably my fault, yeast is so tricky. I did the herb bread & sprinkle with parmesan cheese, made into breadsticks. good- will make again!

Just made this for dinner! My family loved it. It came out a little thin for me, so next time I will allow the dough to rise for awile first. Great flavour. I added 1.5 tsp. of salt and 1 tsp. of sugar to the dough.

Excellent and very easy. I tired a different recipe and it didn't turn out. So then I tried this one and it was perfect. My kids loved it so much they asked if they can bring their friends over the next time I make it. EVERYONE loved it.

Quick and easy. I didn't use Fleischmann's(Registered Trademark) Yeast but it still came out all right ;) I covered the crust with a lot of olive oil, basil and oregano, but my family's Sicilian.

I made the option for regular dry yeast (not fast rising). It was Great !  Easy - Fast to put together. Texture was Very Good. I will make it again. Would recommend this to anyone that like home made pizza.

made as directed, exactly! This one is a keeper, we loved the crust, it was soft but not droopy, and about 1/4 of an inch thick after being baked in a 10 x 15 inch cookie sheet. Made a pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper and onion, with primo pizza sauce. Topped off with grated motzarella and parmesan.No more frozen pizza!

I found this recipe quick and easy. I followed the recipe as stated. I tried it on a weeknight and it satisfied my pizza craving and then some. 

The following times, I've added Italian seasons into the dry mix, whole wheat flour. Turned out great!

I made this recipe the first time on Christmas Day and it was awesome. Put garlic salt and parmesan cheese around the crust as suggested by another reviewer and it made it even better. Now making it again today for all the grandkids. Thanks for a great simple pizza dough. ?

I've made this several times, I've made this exactly like the recipe says to.  It's a great recipe.
My first few times I messed up because I didn't understand about kneading the dough.  I kept kneading and adding more flour until it was easy to knead, but what I was really doing was creating a hard crust by using way too much flour.  The trick is that you really don't need much more than the 2 1/2 cups the recipe calls for.  Knead and knead, understanding that your fingers will be sticky with dough during the process.  As you get closer to the 6 minute mark in kneading, the dough just doesn't stick as bad to your hands.  You still have a slightly sticky mess, but you shape that into a ball and cover it for 10 minutes and you suddenly have pizza dough that you can roll.  I had to look at videos on how to knead pizza dough, lol!  This recipe is so good!

Excellent crust, not too chewy and delicious flavor. I made a white pizza, just plonked the cheeses on the unbaked crust and it came out great; just as good reheated.

all i had in the cupboard was low sodium salt and it definitely needed more salt.  i thought yeast dough needed sugar to rise properly, so i added 1/4 tsp per the yeast package.  it rose like crazy!!

I love this crust but please revise recipe to start with 3-1/2 cups of flour. When made as directed it’s a mess so I always end up adding another cup of flour.

Very easy and quick to make. Just a little bland so make sure you add a good amount of spices to the dough when your done. Really amazing considering you don’t have to let it sit for more then 10 Mins!

My garage sale bread machine died. Up until then I depended on it to make pizza dough for me as it seemed like so much voodoo to make dough. This came out great and we loved the texture of the dough. If you let it rise a bit longer you’ll get a thicker Chicago-style crust. Very easy. I just may try baking bread on my own now!

So I wrote a huge long review and this app crashed before I could finish. Well, to say it short it was perfect, fast and easy. I used half the dough for a pizza I baked on a cookie sheet, 25 minutes on the bottom rack. I’ll always use this recipe.

Very easy to make dough!  I pre-baked the crust until almost done, then added toppings to make a Garlic Chicken-Bacon-Ranch pizza.  Baked until nice a golden brown.  It was a great dinner!

Wonderful, versatile, and simple dough recipe that works for anything you try. I used it to make an Italian-style, thin-crust pizza. I put a little dash of pepper in the dough as well to really make it pop. I also used normal Walmart Active-Dry yeast since I couldn't get my FLEISCHMANN yeast to open, lol. Definitely would use again, and plan too.

Wonderful, easy recipe. Granddaughters ages 5 and 8 made their first pizza from scratch using this recipe.  Five year old needed lots of coaching. Eight year old created a masterpiece!

 Parents and sibs all enjoyed the pizza party!

Made this for our friend's group weekly gathering, they absolutely loved the crust, it came out crispy on the outside and soft and lightly chewy on the inside. Definitely gonna keep this as my go to pizza crust recipe.

Fast, easy and tasted great! The recipe didn’t say how much yeast, just one packet of Fleischman’s. One packet is 1/4 oz or about 7 grams of another brand.

This is our favorite pizza dough. We make this almost every Friday night in my house. I use 8” round cake pans to make individual size pizzas and we top them each how we like. Sometimes I’ll substitute half of the water for a light beer, like Stella.

Wonderful crust!  Thank you!  I need to go to the grocery store and didn’t realize just how badly until I started to make my pizza.  I was out of corn meal and I soon discovered, also out of plain flour! Haha! So, I put mine in bread machine (dough cycle), used more than 50% whole wheat flour (because I ran out of plain flour.) and baked on parchment paper.

This is the only pizza crust recipe I’ll ever use again. I followed the recipe precisely, and obtained flawless results. I like my crust super thin, and this worked out perfect using a fifteen inch pizza stone, also lending to a superior crunchy crust.

This is the best pizza crust I have made and I have made a few.  The dough goes together beautifully and you don’t have to proof for an hour just 10 minutes.  A lot of recipes call for lots more flour which is too much dough for two people.  I know you can freeze it but I don’t like it after it is frozen.  This is my recipe from now on.  Thanks.

I’ve made this dough a few times now and I have to say I loved it! We usually make two personal pizzas for the kids and use the leftover dough for knots. Then we make another for the adults. This dough is quick we than my last recipe and tastes wonderful.

We tried three different types of pizza crust in a taste test at the school I teach Culinary Arts.  This one hands down. It was fast and easy to make. It was crisp on the outside with the right about of chewiness on the inside.

my family loved this crust! probably one of the best pizza crust I have ever had. I used bread flour versus all purpose flour. And I used regular active dry yeast versus the rapid rise. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. The dough was nice and fluffy/airy. Absolutely delicious! I will never use anoyher recipe.

I used Caputo "00" flour I had on hand and it was a smooth, soft and airy dough. I also added some sugar to the Active Dry Yeast to help it proof, per a reviewer suggestion.

While the flavor was a bit lacking if you wanted to stand alone bread, the texture for pizza (it's purpose) was wonderful. Next time I'll try their suggestion to add some basil to the dry ingredients.

I call it a keeper, for sure. Plenty of room to adjust to personal taste.

I made this with the Exquisite Pizza Sauce on this site and it came out a lot better than previous dough recipes. I like that this doesn't require bread flour as all purpose is cheaper. I baked it at 450 for a on a pizza stone for a crisper crust and it almost tastes like my old favorite pizza shop in the Chicago suburbs.

This recipe is missing the 1/2 tsp of sugar to add to the proofing yeast.  The little bugs like to eat the sugar and they become more "active".  Also, if you don't use bread flour, then just pack it up and order out. Unless you like a cardboard tasteless crust...like the Bisquick recipe.  Sorry, but this recipe is too basic. A few more and/or different ingredients would help it.

Light and crispy.  I used an extra 1/4 tsp of yeast because it’s been in the fridge for a while.  Let it rise in the oven with the light on for a couple of hours and then in the fridge overnight.  Prebaked for about 5 minutes before toppings.  Next time, I will make a double batch and divide it into 3rds.  Half was too small for two of us.

This is my go to pizza dough recipe. I live in a small town and the only way to get a good za is to make it yourself. If you want you can add a tbsp of honey or sugar, but it'll turn out for you without.

Dough was a little too bread-y for me. If you make a bacon pizza, consider using some of the bacon grease on the edge to add extra flavor. Also, enjoyed this crust better with cornmeal sprinkles on the bottom.

It’s a great basic dough that doesn’t take forever. My 6 year old declared it the best pizza he had in his WHOLE life. I thought it was somewhat bland so I’m going to add a pinch of garlic and italian herbs next time. 5 stars  for speed and simplicity, 3-4 stars for flavor.

My first time attempting home made pizza. This dough was easy - I did the Active Dry Yeast option because that's what I had on hand. Made one large pizza that filled a cookie sheet. The crust was nice and firm, not crunchy or crispy, and not too doughy or chewy. Just what Goldilocks would have liked I think! I will definitely make this again!

Easy and fast.  I did add a small bit of sugar to the yeast/warm water because that's what I do when I make bread.  Other than that, it was exactly as written and it worked perfectly.  We did a double recipe so my son could make garlic breadsticks w/ the extra.  That was good too!

This is such a great dough!  I did as others with the rapid rise and separated 1/4 C of the 110 degree water, sprinkled it with the yeast, about 1/2 tsp white sugar and stirred.  Once the yeast had bloomed I mixed it with already combined 2 C all purpose flour, salt, garlic powder and italian seasoning and added the olive oil to blend.  I just kept dusting the surface to knead with the remaining half cup of flour until it didn't stick to my hands and was smooth.  Followed other directions otherwise.  I've tried a lot of other pizza dough recipes and they've all been a little difficult to form into a round, but this one was light and fluffy...it was so easy to work with.  This is my new go-to, thank you!

Loved this recipe, but suggest pressing it out into a lot more for bigger pizzas. It tends to grow a bit more than I expected. Good dough though when you want to make a pizza from scratch in a “hurry” without waiting a few hours to proof it.

Easy crust that I can whip up in my ninja blender. I added a shake of garlic powder but otherwise I kept to recipe. Makes a huge crust but it's so easy I always make 2.

It was so easy to make!    It rolled out very easy and just makes a really good pizza crust.   I divided the dough and rolled the second half and froze it. So we will see how that bakes up.   I also will cut baking time by a couple of minutes.

Fabulous crust! I stretched it out by hand so it was odd shaped but very thin. It was crisp and had a delicious flavor! My husband loved it! I did bake it at the highest oven temp I could get which is above 500 degrees. My pizza brick is in storage so I used my cookie sheets. Wonderful pizza crust in spite of my changes! Will be using this recipe over and over!

Absolutely loved this recipe!  I added a few shakes of garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and crushed bay leaves to the dough mixture.  My husband who can be a picky eater said “This pizza is delicious”.  I have to agree.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Love this crust! I've made it as directed and also with the footnote instructions. Used this dough to made bread stick knots and bread sticks. It comes out perfect every time! Thank you for an amazing recipe!! I make a really yummy garlic butter that I brush on the edges after baking that makes everyone very very happy! So tasty

Great recipe. I found adding about a tablespoon or two of sugar (I used baker's sugar) gives a much fluffier dough. It's also worth substituting garlic salt for regular for extra flavor.

If you want the kind of pizza that has those awesome bubbles in the crust, this is the perfect dough to accomplish that with. All you have to do is cold ferment this dough for about 48 hours, and bring it to room temperature before using it.  

Just make sure that you have followed the directions up to the point of letting it rest. After it rests, knock it down and then cover it tightly with plastic, stick it in the fridge and wait 48 hours.

I have made this dough so many times, and it is just wonderful. It's easy,  fast, and so much better than store bought. I have made this exactly as written in the recipe, and it's fantastic as-is.  But I like to change it, depending on the toppings. Usually, I like more of a "multi-grain" style pizza dough, so instead of 2 cups of white flour, I usually use 1/4 cup flax meal, 3/4 instant oats, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup white flour---and then I flour my bench with white flour. I also usually add a tablespoon or two of either honey or brown sugar to the mixture because my family likes a touch of sweetness in the dough. I dissolve the honey or brown sugar in warm water with the yeast, just to proof it first. Then I mix the flax meal, oats, whole wheat flour, white flour, salt, and little dried oregano together in a bowl before adding the yeast mixture along with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. I follow the recipe's directions from that point on. I highly recommend using the Rapid Rise Yeast over the Active Dry Yeast, as it cuts your baking time in half (this is true not only of this pizza dough recipe, but in homemade bread recipes as well). This dough is so good, so versatile, so easy to make; that I just can't praise it enough. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

We live at a higher altitude so I adjusted the temperature to +25°. I cooked the dough on my pizza stone. I preheated my stone then added a little Olive oil. After that I sprinkled cornmeal. Added the dough, my goodies and cooked. It was awesome. No pizza delivery where we live so this will be our dough each week for pizza night.

It was a very good dough and made a delicious pizza. My only complaint would be that I could not print the recipe with the footnotes, which I needed since I was not using the rapid rise  yeast. I had to do a screenshot and that made it necessary to print two pages. It would be helpful if that feature were fixed.

Very easy to make and turned out gorgeous. The only thing the recipe didn't make clear to me is that while kneading I needed to sprinkle flour on the top continously until the dough stopped being too sticky. It turned out super light and tasted like a takeway crust.

We liked the taste and texture, but it rose quite a bit during baking and turned out as " thick crust" pizza. It is great if that is what you wanted.

I mixed the dough in my mixer with a dough hook.  I added some herbs to the dough for extra flavor.   It was crispy on the outside but soft and chewy in the center.  I will make this again.

I've made this for calzones about 1/2 a dozen times now.  It's great tasting even though for some reason I was a little worried at 1st.  It's easy to work with and follow the recipe.  I'll certainly continue to use this in the future!

Doesn't get any easier than this. Made pizza pops and apple pops with this recipe. Used 100% whole wheat one time, 50/50 whole wheat and white the next, didn't matter, worked perfectly every time.

The easiest dough ever! I made the herbed version using minced garlic and Italian seasoning, that really gave it a nice look and an extra layer of flavor. I will leave it in the oven for another 5 minutes or so next time. I started with caprese pizza in mind but added a few pepperoni anyway. I used fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, shredded Italian blend cheeses, fresh tomato, and Ragu sauce. My pizza loving Maltese even loved the crust...oh, and my pizza crazy husband loved it as well...lol!!

very tasty, thin and crispy if you use the one recipe to make two 12"  crusts.

Super easy to make and dough was super easy to handle, but tasted more like bread than pizza dough. More dense than the chewiness I was looking for.

Needs a little sugar. Otherwise, it's a very easy recipe. I think that next time I'll let the yeast work a little longer, primarily for flavor. It is a little bland without a little time for flavors to form. Easy, easy.

Make these changes: 2/3rd cups milk with 1/4th cup water. Add 1 tbs honey or maple syrup or sugar to the liquid mix. 

Otherwise it's delicious and fluffy.

It was absolutely amazing, my very first time making my own pizza too.

I did the instructions a bit differently tho, I mixed all dry ingredients together then water and oil and kneaded by hand then let it rise for over an hour,  also only used 2 teaspoons of olive oil, it didn't need any more than that at all. I'm not into herbs but gave it 2 teaspoons of oregano as well. 
I don't have a 14"  pan so I used a 12" one, the crust was a bit thick which I don't mind at all, it was baked to perfection after giving it 10 extra minutes.

This recipe was perfect and will definitely do it all the time from now on. If there was anything I would suggest is to reduce the oil to no more than 1 tablespoon.

Will definitely

This dough was really easy to make and work with (used the fast rising yeast).  I agree that for my preference it needs more flavour ingredients - as other folks have shared here.  Our new family "go to" pizza crust recipe.

That was awesome pizza dough.  I used whey from my yogurt in place of the water,  and added a bit of Italian seasoning to the dough.  I don't use instant yeast,  so I put my yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm whey and let it sit for 10 minutes before proceeding,  then let it rise for 45 minutes.  Rolled it out and let it rise on my pizza stone for 30 minutes before topping. Delicious.

It wasn't terrible, but it didn't meet my expectations based on the reviews/ratings here.

I will try it again probably, because it was so easy and to see if experience with the dough would help me improve it.

Very good but could use a bit more salt. Excellent consistency and chew, not tough but crisp and tender. I pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes. Sauce and cheese on the bottom, toppings on the top. Baked at 400 for 15 minutes then raised the heat to 425 for the last 15 minutes. Perfect crust, golden brown, cheese and toppings browned beautifully. Well received by everyone.

Wanted pizza for dinner but had no pizza dough so found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. Turned out great and my husband really liked it. Will definitely make it again.

Have made twice.  Excellent recipe!  Might hold let it rise a little more the next time (personal preference only - I like a thicker crust).  The family loves it!

This is a great crust.  I made a double batch and froze in small sizes for future dinners when we are busy and don't know what to have for dinner.  Grab it out of the freezer and toss in the fridge to thaw for the day and you are good to go.  I did add some  Italian seasoning to give it a little flavor.

It was okay. Not bad, but just okay. It was too dry and flour-y but it's entirely possible that I added too much flour to the dough. I'll also use more sauce next time.

I added some spices to the dough, garlic and onion powder and oregano.  It was delicious, my family couldn't believe it was so good and was so quick and easy to make.  I kneaded the dough with the hook on my kitchen aid, turned out better than when I had a break machine.

Turned out fantastic!!  I had to use slow yeast (1teaspoon) and let it rise for 2 hours, put it in the pan, stretched it out and let it rise for another 20 minutes ( I was not in a hurry). By far, this is the dough recipe to use from now on. I put the spices directly into the dough ( paprika) and a chicken-ranch base with lots of vegetables.

Made this as a last minute meal and it was great! Decided to go with whole wheat and it didn't disappoint.

Great recipe! Like others, I flavored it with a lot of Italian seasoning and garlic powder. Also, brush the crust with all of oil before you put toppings on for a prettier crust and maybe just a little garlic powder on top of the crust edges as well. Put cornmeal on the pizza stone to help the crust as well. I recommend prebaking the crust for five to seven minutes if you like a crispy crust otherwise you'll end up with perfect toppings but doughy crust, or burned toppings and crispy crust. I made three batches the same night and that was how I ended up.  That said,  my kids devoured every single pizza.

Loved this recipe! We made it in the food processor and it came out perfectly crunchy and soft in the inside. Better than any pre made crust.

This pizza dough was extremely easy to make. It requires very simple ingredients.  Since I don't use packages of yeast, one package equals 2.25 tsp of yeast and a pinch of sugar. I used my mixer with a dough hook to mix. I did use 2.5 cups of all purpose flour. I also let the dough rise for couple hours since I didn't need to bake the pizza right away. The dough kept rising and the final result tasted so great. The dough was very easy to manage. I used a roller and a little flour for the board. I placed the crust with stuffing at the very bottom rack in the oven for 10 minutes at 500 degrees and then move the pizza up to middle of the oven for the remaining time. The crust is crunchy at the edge and hold the shape of the pizza excellently. Definitely will make it again!

Terrific tender crust that holds together with LOTS of toppings.  It takes just a few minutes to mix up (love my KitchenAid mixer), and the voila! A perfect dough. I took the recommendation of another reviewer and brushed melted garlic butter on the rolled crust edge when it came out of the oven.  Pesto, chicken, red peppers, lots of fresh mushrooms and mozzarella on ours.  What about yours?

We really liked this crust. It was a nice soft crust and slightly crispy on the outside. I'd definitely make again. I did use the footnote to let it rise for 30-60 min before adding toppings.

Have been trying a few different pizza dough recipes lately. My fiance is super picky about pizza crust, and this one won out of previous trials. We live in NYC, so there are all kinds of pizza we've tried in the city, and this homemade batch tastes wonderful and professional. 

I would also recommend adding a bit more salt to the dry mix, as well. Wonderful texture, nonetheless.

Excellent.    I made a couple of pizzas with this.   One was a regular size crust, which puffed up nicely and was really delicious - near pizzeria quality.  The other was a thin crust (I don't often make thin crusts but I was running out of dough).    If you're considering a thin crust, note that it didn't puff up at all and was very hard and crunchy so I wouldn't recommend it for this purpose.

I've been using this recipe for years when I want a quick basic go to recipe. It's a master recipe because you really can make it your own by adding herbs and flavours to the dough. As written it's basic, but still 100 times better that takeout or frozen. If with addition of your favourite flavours it's amazing! I like to add fresh herbs like basil from the garden in summer. Dried herbs work wonders as well. Making it again tonight

This one is a keeper!! Crispy outside, chewy inside. Perfect. Used it for bbq chicken pizza. Loaded the unbaked crust with toppings, baked in a 475 degree oven for 15 minutes. Voila!!

I love this recipe and use it at least once a week. It works well using 1/3 ratio wheat flour, I often add herbs or onion and garlic powder for additional flavor. If you have time to let it rise for 45-60 minutes it will be more crispy and light. Thanks for the recipe!

It tastes like it's homemade, because it IS homemade!  A great recipe.  I make it at least once a week.  If you like thicker crust (like we do) just let it rise a little before baking.  This is my most-used recipe on Allrecipes!

The recipe is good but I do not like a super soft crust so I only put in half the oil and it could even use less so over all it still was a good pizza crust.  I also was in a hurry and did not let it sit or rise, for the 60 minutes,  I just rolled it out after the 10 minute rest and it turned out great.  Thanks

Super easy to make, easy ingredients.  Used my Kitchen Aid and dough hook, needed a little extra flour.  Let rise a little longer until I was ready to use it.  Cooked on a pizza stone at 475 for about 14 minutes.  Great basic recipe.

Made it straight from the recipe on the back of the packets. It did not mention cornmeal though. There is however a recommended change, learned from a frequent dough maker friend of many years. Replace the water in the recipe with Sprite. (Still warm it up) The Sprite doesn't really affect the taste but the sugar helps expedite the yeast as its already dissolved. Spread it nice and thin on the pan and it was the best crust I've made to date.

Perfect pizza recipe. We rarely order out anymore. This is BETTER than most pizza shops. I like to cover it in Boss Sauce, bacon and shredded chicken.

I love this simple dough! Though when I press it down to the pizza stone, I spread it as thin as I can. I prefer the crackery-crispy crust.

I don't even order pizza anymore. I just make it at home because I know that kitchen doesn't skimp on the toppings!

I followed the directions to a T! Divided the dough into two parts, one went in a cast iron pan, the other into a cake pan ... figured one would turn out great ... baked them, they looked awesome in the oven, and took them out ... it is bad when kids absolutely won't eat something, nor will their dad with an iron stomach ... we ended up going to McDonalds. What a waste of time and ingredients!!!

Great crust, but always instruct people to add a bit of honey or sugar to the warm water used to proof the yeast. It does make a difference in both the time it takes to proof and in the quality of the crust.  This is my standard pizza dough recipe and it works every single time.  The amount of flour needed really does vary depending on the weather; you have to go by the texture of the dough. I don't have a standing mixer, so I mix and knead by hand every time, which isn't a big deal at all.  It also helps you get a feel for the proper dough. Maybe one day I'll have enough space in my kitchen for a nice mixer with a dough hook. A girl can dream.

Could not have been any easier to make! Love making homemade pizza dough, then I know what ingredients are in the food I'm eating. From start to finish less than one hour and we had great homemade pizza on the table for dinner.   I made two nice size pizzas with this recipe on my pizza stone on the bbq.  Nice and crunchy on the outside, very chewy on the inside. Hint of the yeast taste which I like also.  And the smell was like homemade bread. 
Will definitely make this again.

I used 3 cups flour to make two twelve inch pizzas. I proofed the yeast with sugar as per instructions. I allowed to rise for three hours in very warm air while covered. If I want pan pizza I use an
aluminized 9x9 for half of the dough. I use corn meal for my round pizza stone and evo to grease my go to bake pan.

The perfect pizza dough base, even microwaved leftovers are delicious! I have made it exactly as the recipe is written, and the whole family loves it. After some experimenting, I like to add 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1-2 tsp minced garlic, and 1/4 c flax meal. Using only wheat flour did not come out right, so I generally substitute 1 c wheat for 1 c white flour as the recipe suggests. By tripling the recipe, I can make enough dough for five 12" pizzas. After the pizza is made, but not cooked, I freeze them for quick meals. The frozen pizza comes out just as perfect as if I had just made it. After trying many, many pizza dough recipes from this site, this is the only one I recommend to friends.

I ended up using a lot more flour than the recipe said it required. I also proofed the yeast prior to adding it to the dry ingredients. The dough turned out ok, and was tasty. I wish it had been thinner, and crispier, but I'm sure I can tweak it to suit.

I have used the base of this recipe nearly every Friday for the last 16 months.  We love it!  Periodically I switch things up and add garlic and/or other various Italian seasonings for extra flavor.  Easy and fast compared to other recipes, AND it's versatile!

I did this twice now. I picked it because it looked easy and i HATE BAKING. the only problem i had making this recipe was working the dough into my pie shape pan. once it rises, it's so sticky and difficult. i guess, as aforementioned, my inexperience with these problems is my own fault. it came out great though. a little thick the first time but the second i actually kneaded for 4 minutes. it's my go-to now. oh also i like to add flax seed just for the fiber boost and health benefits. you can't really discern a taste difference when baked.

My husband and I have been looking for a pizza crust because we love making our own pizza.  We're tried no yeast recipes without success.  This one "takes the cake!"  So easy and we'll be using this again!!  We added some oregano and basil to the dough.  It was crispy yet chewy.  Loved it!!

Great pizza dough!  First thing I made with my new kitchen-aid stand mixer.  Family said they liked it better than the pizza we order for delivery.  I made pan pizza in a cake pan.  It was very doughy, but everyone wanted more.  Will divide between two cake pans, as suggested, next time.

I have been looking and looking for the perfect pizza crust dough and this is definitely it! Crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. I added some minced garlic and rosemary to one batch...amazing...and minced garlic and oregano to the second, right in when the dough was mixing...amazing x2! Definitely a keeper.

This crust is perfect! It is so full-tasting and crispy. I love how you only need to leave it out for 10 minutes while most crust recipes tell you to leave it out for a couple of hours. The only change I made was how I prebaked the crust. That way it was more crispy and golden. When I first made this crust I didn't prebake it and it was white and not very crispy. But other then this, I wouldn't change a thing! Just make sure you prebake the crust.

This crust has a really great consistency and is a great base to flavor with other herbs and spices or leave plain. I made mini pizzas and froze them for daughter to take school and heat in the microwave for lunch; she loves them and says the crust still tastes really good and doesn't get hard after reheating it. Definitely my new "go to" recipe for pizza dough!

Really simple crust. I had no problems. I used it for a deep dish, cast iron skillet pizza. Cooked evenly and had a nice crust. Next time I will probably add some garlic to the dough. The thicker bites were a bit plain.

Amazing, really good pizza dough. The only adjustment I made was to use a cheap baking stone instead of a baking pan and it gave me a crispier pizza.

I like this recipe the crust turned out well, I did use 1 cup of wheat flour. I think it would be better with all white flour.  The best part of the pizza was the toppings.  After I roll out the dough I put on the cheese (cheddar and mozzarella), ranch dressing, homemade hot sauce, Canadian Bacon and mushrooms, bake, cut and eat. Yummy !!!

Great. Use kitchen aid. Try some olive oil and herbs on crust. Try melding with other recipes. Could go 25 minutes on crust but Lauren liked 20 minutes. Could top w anything.

Great easy pizza dough recipe. I followed this recipe to the T and I was able to get two 9x13 cookie sheets crusts. I overlapped the trays with parchment paper made creases outlining trays. I placed the parchment paper on counter put 1/2 the dough on it put aother par. Paper on top and rolled it to the shape of the 9x13 rectangle and put the paper with dough back on tray. I put sauce and toppings on with out worrying about it getting on tray because of the overlapping parchment paper. I cut the excess paper so it didn't touch oven rack put it in oven and repeated the same thing for the vother 1/2 of dough. My pizza cooked perfectly in 19-21 minutes. Kids and hubby loved it and much cheaper and easier than picking up a pizza!  Thank you for sharing recipe. God bless our home cooking:)

I decided to stop spending $40 every Friday on delivery and make my own pizza. I've used this recipe for several months and it never fails. The kids love making it too, and I use it a slumber parties where they all help to throw it together. Quick, easy, and never fails.

Very easy to make - I mixed it in the Cuisinart.  Very easy to roll out - did not snap back like most dough does - I did not have to fight with it.  It tasted great and was soft yet chewy.  This is Fleishman's own recipe so you know it's coming from the experts !!

I made this last night with the variation of half whole wheat flour and adding the herbs and garlic. It was sooo good! I love the texture, more crisp on the bottom than other pizza crusts I've made from scratch. I'm going to be making pizza more often!

This is a great quick recipe. Quick and simple. Will it rival your local pizzeria? No. But on a weeknight when you want to throw together a quick homemade pizza and you don't have a lot of time this is a great recipe. The only thing is, maybe I did something wrong but 2 1/4 cups of flour is not enough. I usually end up adding an extra cup.

Once I read and followed the correct instructions for the RapidRise yeast(accidentally followed the dry yeast instructions the first time lol) this crust turned out excellent! It's really easy to add in your own flavors while mixing the dough ingredients. I added some oregano, basil, and minced garlic for some extra flavor. The dough is crunchy on the outside but thick and soft on the inside. The aroma had my roommates hovering nearby. This will be a new staple for me!

Absolutely delicious!  I add a bit of Italian seasoning in with the flour and it gives it an extra pop of flavor.  The first time I used this recipe the dough was still pretty doughy and the toppings were really done so now I bake the crust for 10 minutes and then add the toppings and continue baking.

I've tried so many pizza dough recipes but this one is my favourite.  I used active dry yeast so I let the dough rise for about 30 minutes until it doubled in size.  My friends and I made 4 thin crust personal pizzas.  I will definitely be making this recipe again, and again.

OH MY GOODNESS. I made two pizzas for dinner tonight using this recipe... and they were both SO amazing! I followed the instructions under the recipe for using regular yeast, and I needed to add probably 1/2 cup flour to make the dough manageable... but WOW. Super airy, but filling and yummy. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

This was my first successful attempt to make pizza from scratch. I followed the recipe as is and the pizza came out great. This is a recipe for a basic pizza dough and possibilities are endless. I topped the pizza with lots of fresh veggies. My family loved it. I have been using this recipe every weekend for my kids. Thanks !!

This was delicious. Like the other reviewers i did spice up the dough a little bit with some seasoning. I used garlic powder, oregano, parsley. I would prefer if it was just a little bit chewier. But all in all it was very impressive

This was the best so far. I added garlic and itlalian seasoning which added more flavor. I baked it for 30, but should of baked it for only 25.  I used some of the dough for breadsticks, and they turned out great.

Awesome crust!  In an effort to try to eat healthier I decided to make a homemade, low-cal version of my favorite meal.  The pizza turned out great.   I actually cheated a bit and decided to treat myself to a stuffed crust with my 12" pizza pan.   (Yeah I know, I'm contracting myself....anyway I digress)  Next time I'm going to make a deep dish pizza.   The sides rose sooooooo nicely.  Dominos and Pizza Pizza I'm taking you off speed dial.  Lol

Sorry I'm not showing the whole thing.  The picture is an after thought.   :D

Very basic dough that tastes wonderful. I had no trouble at all making this recipe....very simple. I used the Active Dry yeast instead of Rapid Rise. The crust turned out perfect, better than a restaurant-style pizza!! The toppings I used were: mozzarella cheese, chicken, and spinach over Classico Sun-Dried Tomato Parmesan Pasta Sauce. SO simple and SO DELICIOUS. The sauce worked really well....mmmmmmmm.

I used regular (non rapid rise) yeast and dissolved it in the warm water with just a teaspoon of honey before adding all of the other ingredients.  I let my KitchenAid mixer do most of the work and then turned out the dough to finish kneading by hand.  It rose beautifully covered on a flour-dusted board in 30 minutes.  Rolled it out, added toppings, and baked on preheated pizza stones in a 500 degree oven - yum!  This dough was some of the easiest to roll out thin than other doughs I've tried and it also tasted good - I would definitely use it again.

Delicious! I followed suggestions from other reviewers and added some Italian Seasoning and garlic salt to the dough. I also substituted one cup of regular flour for one cup of whole flour in a double recipe. The double recipe made 2 large cookie sheet sized pizzas, enough to feed our family of 6.

This dough gets 5 stars for being very easy to work with. For taste I would give it a 3 but my picky son loves it so I compromised with a 4.  To me it is edible but I have had better. Thanks for sharing this.

I made this tonight because my husband LOVES pizza. It was awesome! I used the Fleischmann's pizza dough yeast and added oregano, basil, garlic salt & ground coriander to the dough. It's way better than the frozen or refrigerated dough I have bought in the past. I really liked the way it got crispy on the bottom but stayed nice and chewy-soft on the inside.  I will be making this dough every pizza night from now on!

I avoid recipes with yeast due to the rise time that's required. RapidRise yeast? An *amazing* convenience! And the dough turned out great...despite my baking the pizza a wee bit too long. Even so, the interior maintained it's softness. I'll be making this one again.

Wonderful recipe.  I substituted the salt with garlic salt and added freshly shredded parmesan and romano cheese.

This was an easy recipe and on it's own it makes a great starter dough. It was very doughy but I think I will stretch it thinner and make several pizzas with the dough. I also would like to add garlic, parmesean, or other seasonings to the dough to make it more flavorful.

I thought this was very good. I sometimes will throw in 1/2 cup wheat flour to make a more Artisan dough and like it for a change.  I didn't need to add any more flour and it worked out well. It is a keeper for me.

When I was younger and had more time, I made pizza from scratch with regular yeast.  I am so excited about this rapid rise yeast!  This recipe is fun, easy, and perfect for a quick meal.  I put ground venison, italian sausage, onions, peppers, blended cheeses and pepperoni on mine and my meat lovers pizza was, as my daughters said, "Awesome!".  I've made this pizza dough twice now and am going to make this a weekly meal, trying new toppings each time.

Best pizza dough I've tried, and I've tried alot!
The only alteration I made was an addition; I made/melted my own garlic butter with crushed garlic and parmesan cheese and brushed it on the dough before baking, added amazing flavor!
Next time I'll bake for a few minutes before adding the toppings though, the middle was a little soft, but still delicious!

Delicious! I have made this a few times and it always turns out great! :) I have precooked the crust before topping it, and also topped it first. Both ways work! I used regular yeast and added a tsp of sugar while to the yeast when I proofed it.

Very easy and I made it and there was more dough than I thought! I made a giant pizza and my husband loved it. 

I used just active yeast instead of the rapid. I had to wait a little but it was good. It gave me time to clean up and prepare other stuff in the meantime :)

The only thing I did different was add seasonings to the flour. I added garlic and parsley.

This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious and simple.  the only thing I did differently was to brush my crust with olive oil and garlic before adding the cheese since my son won't eat bread with sauce.  Made a great cheesy bread recipe!

This was so easy to make! I never made dough in my life! Ok so I didn't have Fleishchman's yeast but I did use the store brand fast rise yeast which worked awesome for us.  Next for the pizza toppings, We had to use what was in our home! I am so glad we did! We used;four cheese Del Monte pasta sauce,  skillet cooked ground turkey with green onions &  diced fresh garlic , white onions, bell peppers, tomatoes,  and cheese (individual slices dice up so we could sprinkle them). Last we seasoned with a mix of oregano, garlic salt, herbs and spices randomly and voila, we created a pizza out of this world! My daughter was my helper she helped me knead the dough!

This was AWESOME but ALOT for one person- Next time will cut recipe in half but it was AWESOME! Sprinkled the top of the dough with a pinch of garlic salt and Italian seasonings and cooked for 5 min before adding my sauce and cheese..Used normal yeast and let rise a hour before cooking per footnotes- Not sure how I could ever buy premade dough again- This was so yummy

This is a great recipe! It was fast and easy. I prefer a more flavorful crust so I added dried herbs and a sprinkle of garlic powder to the flour, pre-baked with a little Parmesan and the result was EXCELLENT!!! 
Also since I'm only coking for myself I divided the dough into thirds and still got 3 nice sized pizzas (9 or 10 in each). This is a keeper :-)

My son asked for pineapple pizza for his eighteenth birthday. Thought I'd splurge and buy a Baboli (sp) but saw this and thought I'd give it a try. For some reason I've got a fear of yeast! Anyway... (I go for the throw it all together recipes usually) it was great! All my men raved. This added to our great day except I started crying when I realized we probably won't be together next year on Jonny's bdy. he'll be in college... oops there go the tears again.  Thanks for an easy, great recipe.

This was more of a crisp crust, but it worked well and I love that it can be made up so quickly.

The best ever.  The is the first time I've tried a recipe where you don't mix the yeast with the water prior to adding to flour. I was afraid it wouldn't work, but it did.  This is definitely my "go-to" recipe for pizza dough--how easy can you get and so much better than store bought!

Yum!  I liked this dough for the same reason some people didn't:  it's similar to bread dough, and I love a doughy, thick crust.  I thought it worked well with the Sausage Breakfast Pizza I paired it with. I baked it for 10 mins, then added the toppings and it worked extremely well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a new pizza crust recipe for my husband who is pretty picky when it comes to pizza.  He loved it!!  I made it exactly as posted except I doubled the batch.  It made one 14" round and one rectangle on a large cookie sheet.

Great recipe!  I added just a little bit of sugar, maybe a tablespoon to give it a little sweetness.  I also put some herbs on the pan with the oil and cornmeal.  It turned out great!

This recipe was great!  I used the instant yeast  and needed in a little oregano, and slathered on sun dried tomato oil and garlic and topped with our fav sauce, caramelized onions, green pepper, jalapenos, red pepper flakes and organic sweet Italian sausage...No Cheese!  We are dairy free...I used a large round vented pizza pan and cooked for 22 minutes.  The dough was so easy to spread in the pan and baked up nicely.  I will definitely make this again.  Really yum topped with home grown baby spinach and a little home made vinaigrette.

Prepared as directed and the dough was still rather sticky. I didn't want to add too much extra flour so I used extra cooking spray on my hands to spread the dough out in the pan. Final product was very good. I will make this recipe again.

I made both a thick and thin version with oregano added and both turned out great. The thin version turned out with a nice crisp to it and the thicker was chewy and both tasted so good!

The BEST pizza dough recipe! I've tried so many pizza doughs and have been very disappointed, but this one is restaurant quality. Makes a great deep dish, thin crust, or pizza roll.

Very nice dough!  Rolls out beautifully and bakes nicely on a regular crisper pizza pan.  I am sure it would be great on a pizza stone, but if you dont have one this recipe will be just as good on your regular old pan!

The recipe is simple and the dough is great.  After cooking the center of the dough was still a little soft for my taste, but I loved that I didn't need to let the dough rise.  Plan to use this again and again.

This is the third recpie for pizza dough I have tried and it's by far the easiest and best.  I substitued whole wheat flour for half of the all purpose flour, and I added a teaspoon of italian seasoning  and a quarter teaspoon of garlic powder.  I rolled it out instead of shaping on the pan, and it was easy as pie.

I have made pizza dough weekly for a few years now and thought I'd try this recipe for a change. It is so simple and the hand kneading is key.  It gives you a lighter crust.  Great recipe.
