This was SO delicious. I did tweak the recipe a bit - before I stuffed the thighs, I drizzled the greens/garlic with a little olive oil and mixed in some grated parmesan. The result was a flavorful, juicy piece of chicken. Yum!

I really enjoyed this chicken! Hubby is traveling, so I was looking for smaller portion recipes.  I made two chicken thighs and wow, very impressive! You can really stuff a lot under the skin, so don't be afraid of the amounts! I think next time I might rub some seasoned salt under the skin and all over the chicken. 1/4 tsp was a bit much for my taste for just sprinkling on the top.  This would make a nice meal for company, since it looks impressive but takes very little effort. Thanks for the great recipe!

OMG...this is one of the easiest and quickest-prep dishes I have ever made! Love, love, loved it! I used all spinach because I didn't have any arugula. Before stuffing the chicken, I drizzled a bit of EVOO on the spinach, added garlic and Parmesan to it, then mixed well to coat the spinach. I lightly sprinkled the stuffed breast with seasoned salt and black pepper. The chicken was moist, the skin was crisp, and my husband loved it! He thought it belonged in a restaurant. It was so good and EASY! We will be making this again and again.

This recipe was fantastic! After trying the original, I put my own spin on it. I put seasoned salt and black pepper under the skin as well as on top. I also mixed garlic and crumbled feta in the greens prior to stuffing. You can't go wrong with this chicken dish!

I cooked it for one hour.  It was swimming in juice.  It was very very juicy.  I'm not sure where all the juice comes from but it was good.

Easy and delicious as is. Stuff as much arugula and spinach  as the skin allows. The more the merrier.

This is easy peasy to make and yummy!  I made 12 thighs for a dinner party I hosted and it was a smash!  I also tweaked the recipe.   I did not use kale, rather two bags of spinach.  After washing the spinach I dressed the leaves with olive oil, fresh minced garlic, fresh grated parm and a sprinkle of salt (as per other reviews).   After stuffing the spinach under the skin, I brushed the remaining oil mixture (left over from the dressing) onto the skin and sprinkled with the season salt.   The juices created from this was amazing!!!  I made a thickener using flour and it made the best gravy, of which I added no other seasonings to.  This was a great dinner which will be made again & again.

There was no flavor to this dish. I only gave it the two stars, due to the fact that the spinach/arugula was the "healthy" to this dish.

Really easy!  I  didn't have arugula so used kale instead. Drizzled some olive oil and crushed the garlic. Put the seasoning inside the skin as over suggested. It did turn out wonderfully moist and delicious!  I will make this again!

When I make it, I'm at least tripling the spinach and using chunk chicken.  The latter as a convenience.  

I love spinach! and it's so good for you.

This is a very good recipe and easy to make.  I used home-grown spinach, which is plentiful now.  I didn't use arugula at all, just spinach.  I added olive oil and grated parm.  My husband liked it too.

I used chicken quarters instead.  Chicken was really moist, cooked for 2hrs at 350.  I made 8 servings.  I think I'd rather have the spinach on the side, not sure if it did anything for flavor.  Really good dish.
