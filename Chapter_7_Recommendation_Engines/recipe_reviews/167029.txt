My husband and I have both been put off by sweet potatoes our entire lives due to everyone always adding lots of extra sugar. I knew there had to be something out there that would make a savory sweet potato dish, and dag nabit, this is it! The dish is still sweet, but thankfully not overbearingly so. 

We added some prepared creamy horseradish and some fresh grated parm to the top before popping it into the oven, but otherwise did everything to spec. Next time will omit the cream cheese and add a little chicken broth. We will be makeing this again!

These are good - and garlicky!. Depending on the size of your sweet potatoes, you may want to add the sour cream slowly. Mine got a little looser than I bargained for. The cayenne is a nice touch, but go easy unless you know you love it. Thanks for the recipe!

Smooth and rich.  I was concerned about the garlic taste combined with the sweetness of the sweet potatoes, but they go together well. The cayenne pepper adds warmth as you eat them.  This will become a Thanksgiving favorite for us!

Superb!  These potatoes were absolutely wonderful, and met my expectations.  We enjoyed the combination of the sweetness of the potatoes, and the strong garlic flavor, complimented by the heat and spice of the seasonings.  I wasn't sure about trying to peel the potatoes after baking, so I peeled them first, and wrapped each one in foil.  This recipe is a definite keeper!  Thank you Kelly for introducing me to some unique ideas I never would have thought of!

Great idea, way too much garlic. I cut the recipe in half: two sweet potatoes and one head of garlic. I honestly could barely taste the potatoes through the overwhelming garlic. I'll try this one again but I'll use three or four sweet potatoes per head of garlic.

This was a good change from your typical cinnamon spiced, sugar laden mashed sweet potatoes.  The flavor was very nice, albeit a tad on the rich side.  When I make this again, I'll cut back a bit on the sour cream.  3/4 cup was a bit too much for my taste.

It's a savory sweet potato dish unlike the traditional sweet potato casseroles with cinnamon & sugar.  It was not my absolute favorite dish, but it was a nice change of pace.

It may sound like an odd combination, but it's delicious. You can cut down on calories by using reduced fat or fat free cream cheese or sour cream. Use fresh pressed garlic for sure. Yummy!

I followed the start of the recipe closely, only adding fresh ground pepper and sea salt before "roasting". When I went to mash them, I decreased the cream cheese just a bit and added one more tbsp. of butter. I thought these were quite good, though very rich. I served this with Kielbasa and Cabbage, which was a nice pair-up. The roasting really took the dish up a notch.

I had made this for Thanksgiving since I don't care for sugary sweet potatoes.  It is very good but as it sits for any length of time the garlic becomes too overpowering even when I cut the amount of garlic in half.  And I am a garlic lover.

Made this as the directions instruct and found them to be really heavy. Made second time without sour cream and cream cheese. SO SO SO GOOD!

I had 2 sweet potatoes  and was looking for a recipe that wasn't loaded with marshmallows, sugar, nuts, etc.  Too sweet for my taste!   Anyway, I found this recipe and decided to try it.  I peeled and cut up the sweet potatoes ad boiled them on my stovetop along with some roasted garlic.  Once they were ready, I drained them and mashed them with low fat Sour cream, butter, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper.   I think I might have been a little heavy handed on the cayenne, but otherwise thought this was really good.   I did not add any cream cheese because of other reviews and I don't think it really needed it!   I will make this again, for sure!

I didnt see this recipe until after I had already cut up the sweet potatoes and placed in a pan of water and two cloves of garlic. I boiled them as if I was making garlic mashed potatoes. I followed the recipe from there but did not add the cayenne pepper. I wisb I hsd allong with one more clove garluc. It was a nice different way of eating sweet potatoes. I also added fresh parm cheese on top on my plate. Yum!

Even though I don't like sweet potatoes, this recipe sounded so interesting I had to try it. It was surprisingly good, and the only sweet potatoes I've ever actually liked! I was a little concerned about the large amount of garlic, and even though they are garlicky it wasn't overkill. I didn't add the cayenne pepper because of my small children, but I bet it would have tasted good. Very creative recipe!

I didn't follow instructions well and I'm betting this could have been better but the combination is very nice... adds alot of interest to an otherwise rather uninteresting veggie. Probably a 5 star as written. To summarize, the flavors work well together. I steamed the potatoes, along with the minced garlic, as though doing mashed potatoes. Then added butter, sour cream, salt and tabasco sauce and blended to the consistency of mashed potatoes. Very good. My family would not do the marshmallow or brown sugar versions of sweet potato. This worked well for us. Don't follow my recipe. Just know that, though an odd sounding combination, it really works.

A good beginning however we felt the cream cheese (and to an extent the sour cream) was overpowering. It was difficult to taste the sweet potato. Were I to make this again I would make these more along the lines of regular garlic mashed potatoes...we'd not use the cream cheese or sour cream and instead would use heavy cream or even buttermilk. The cayenne was a good touch so we'd keep that.
