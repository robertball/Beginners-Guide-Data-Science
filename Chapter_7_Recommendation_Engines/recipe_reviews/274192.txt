Thank you for this recipe!  It was delicious and my family looooved it!
I was in a rush so I only used the frying pan to cook the chicken first, add the cream sauce and finish off with parm cheese, it was amazing!!

Love this dish! Try not to overcook between the browning in the pan and the baking, very high heat brown.

Delicious!  I didn't have artichokes and used only spinach and it was still very good.  I can't wait to try again with artichokes.

Tasty!  I used the exact recipe except I baked it in the same skillet rather than dirty a baking dish.   You can make extra topping and use it as a dip with crackers.

This is an excellent recipe!   Company worthy!   Used chicken thighs (personal preference) did not pound them.   Browned thighs in olive oil in cast iron skillet, added the artichoke mix and baked for 18 minutes.   Perfect!

I didn’t have the spinach dip so I substituted a local grocery store’s pecan, jalapeño, cheese Dip and added mayonnaise and green chili’s to it. Yummy!!

This was absolutely delicious and my chicken was cooked perfectly! 10/10 recommend, next time I am going to try fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder however :)
