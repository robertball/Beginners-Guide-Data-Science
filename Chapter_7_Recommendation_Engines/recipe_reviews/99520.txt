I used this for a chicken pot pie.  My family loved it.  The texture was quite different then usual crust recipes, but its chewy/crunchy texture was a nice compliment to the recipe.  There was a slight sweetness from the squash.  I love low fat recipes, and have finally found a way to make chicken pot pie under 4 grams of fat a serving, believe it or not.

i've made this a few times now, this time i added 6 mushrooms into the food processor to give it extra flavour. i had to add an extra 3/4 cups of flour because of the extra moisture, but it blended up perfectly with the pastry. it gave it a more grey colour than normal but the taste is fabulous. i have found that rolling the pastry thin and having a more moist filling makes it just like normal pastry. it wasnt tough or hard to digest, and compliments any filling perfectly. i used it with chicken and mushroom pot pies, and the sauce i used was a normal bechmal sauce with chicken stock added and garlic. i laced the chicken with it and it was so moist, light and amazing. its definately a regular on my table.

I LOVE this recipe, but not as a pie crust!    After reading the reviews, I made this experimentally as a crust for a pumpkin pie. We'll skip to the end of that and say, like so many others that it's just not terribly good for pie crust. It's rather chewy and tough.  Quite a bit like a pasta noodle actually...  So! Since it yielded enough for two crusts and I only made the one pie, I realized that it's a very similar consistency to pierogi dough. Since I had quite a bit of squash left over, I made squash pierogi from it using a simple pierogi recipe. Added chopped walnuts and nutmeg to the mashed squash to dress up the filling just a little.  So delicious!   Freeze them and they're probably good for months, though they never last long enough to find out in my house.    I make this every few weeks now, it's a new favorite.  Delicious fried up in some butter or, served with alfredo like ravioli. Would probably be tastey with other sauces as well.

The taste is awesome! I used it in chicken pot pie, too and loved it. It makes a very heavy crust, though. I will experiment with it, but will definitely make again.

This crust was a little bit tough to tackle the first time we tried, but we found: not using a food processor and mixing/kneeding by hand and flouring the rolling surface and rolling pin *very well* ended up in a lovely crust once rolled very thin, my mother(who normally doesn't like the extra trouble of my "healthier" recipes) even liked the crust better than traditional Crisco crust once we got it right the second try and we used it in Cherry pies both times so it doesn't work only with savory/meat pies but seems to work with sweeter pies as well.  I don't think we'll be making the traditional Crisco crusts anymore, we just have to make sure we roll this crust thin and not overbake or it'll be hard and chewy.  Thanks Sunflower for coming up with an alternative to Crisco!

Kudos to the chef for trying to make a healthy pie crust, but this ain't getting it. I am totally mystified as to how other posters said their family couldn't tell it wasn't a regular crust Thing was tough and bitter-tasting.

I love this crust! Substituted somewhere around 1/3 to 1/2 cup buttermilk for the egg (adjust flour to proper consistency), kneaded the dough in the bowl for a couple minutes, then refrigerated for an hour or two. Used to make baked Samosas with potato and green pea filling. Make sure to use plenty of flour when rolling out dough, it is sticky! Brushed with plenty of oil before baking, came out with just the right amount of crunch around the edges. The flavor is lovely, just a touch of sweetness.

This crust rolled out very nice, I got it very thin.  Looked pretty, nice orange/yellow color.  Had a nice flavor.  Was rather tough after baking.  Most people in my family did not eat the crust.  Probably won't make this one again.

I cut this recipe in half and mixed it by hand. After reading about tough crust, i tried to mix as little as i could. I got it to working shape and stopped. My crust came out good. I used it to make a butternut squash pie. Although the dough seems kind of bland, once you have sweet pie with it, it serves it purpose as a vehicle for the pie filling and does a good job..If its not overworked, it has a good texture.

I tried out this recipe and it was great. However, I did make a few changes. I used 2 1/2 cups of flour for a cup of mashed butternut squash. I also used 1/2 an egg, half a stick of butter, 1 teaspoon of salt and hand mixed it. The dough is very sticky so you have to use flour while rolling it out. The dough was not hard at all.

I agree with most, in that this makes a tough crust.  However, it adapted quite well to homemade pasties, which is what I wanted it for, in the first place.  Definitely use it for savory recipes, or maybe pumpkin pie. I think I might try making it with half shortening/butter and half squash.  A little fat might be needed to create a flakier pastry.

I would give this 5 stars as a healthy alternative to traditional pie crust.  I liked the flavor, but it comes out very tough & chewy -- hard to cut.  But, I found that it gets better over time -- probably due to contact with the pie filling (in my case, pumpkin pie).  I will definitely use it again, just don't recommend it if you want a flaky, easy to cut crust.

Over all I really enjoyed the taste of the crust. But found it chewy and crusty.  I think although I'm looking to keep the fat out of most of my life changing journey I will probably try to add some butter or shortning into the recipe to not make it so doughly.  But it would make a great crust for jamacian beef patties, because I think the fat in the beef would keep the crust moist.

My family loved this. The best part is that no one could even tell that it wasnt the standard pie crust and theres no fat. Just remember to grease you dish well so that it doesnt stick.

loved the idea but needs approximate cooking time.   I used these to make a pie. followed the pie recipe and the crust ended up WAY overdone.

When this first came out of the oven, the crust was pretty tough, as others have said. Mind you, I didn't take any extra effort to make it thin or anything. I put it in tupperware and stored in the fridge for a couple days, and ater the crust was softer and had a nice consistency for a savory pie. I think the moisture of the filling, sealed in by the container really helped. Not really sure how to alter that when I bake though  :S

I made the crust and will say it was the prettiest looking crust I have made, easy to roll out and  
it had a nice texture in general.  However, the top crust, as thin as I rolled it, was difficult if not impossible to eat.  My small serving caused incredible indigestion and I felt like I had a 10 lb weight in my intestines. I will never make this again and I threw the pie out.  I used a light filling of chopped chicken, carrots, celery, shallot, mushrooms with no fat added. My dinner guest also remarked on the tough dough but he did not have any discomfort afterwards.
