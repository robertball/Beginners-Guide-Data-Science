I've never found a recipes that freezes like this one.  I made them back in March for an "appetizer party" and forgot them in the back of the spare freezer.  Here it is, August, and they were marvelous! A great recipe.  Rolling them in the sesame seeds was a bit messy, and it took a little longer in prep than I expected, but this is one I will keep!  They are not too heavy, but filling and very, very tasty.

I've made this three times now.  Each and every time, I've had all my guests rave over it.  Even those who don't like seafood!  The only adjustment I made, unlike another person on this site, I ADDED more sesame seeds which I like immensely.  If you make this recipe correctly, it's gonna make you look like a star!

This was a great recipe to make ahead of time and keep in the freezer for the unexpected guests or parties.  I added some old bay with the butter and cheese.  It gave the roll a lot of flavor.  I had some people who do not care for sesame seeds so I just rolled it in butter and they loved it.  I served the rollup with cocktail sauce.  For next time, I would add less butter with the cheese and some minced onions.

This is a recipe I have used for years! It's always a big hit. Freeze for a quick save during holiday season. No one will believe you can toss them in the oven and serve them 5 minutes later!

These tasted great, although I had to add to the cooking time. I used less sesame seeds than the recipe called for--only two ounces and they were fine. I used much more bread than it called for and still had left over cheese mixture. They were a hit at a party and then my toddlers devoured the leftovers the next day!

I made tried this recipe for a holiday appetizer.  My family loved it!  It was a bit messy to make but well worth it.  I used less sesame seeds and they came out great.  I will definitely make these again.

I made this for my Christmas open house. It was a terrific hit - everyone raved over them! I used nacho cheese, and they were great. My husband thinks they are the best appetizer he's had. Thanks for this great tasting & simple recipe!!!!

I love it.  I use Wonderbread white large loaf because its so squishy and rolls out into big squares.  I ran out once and Brownberry wheat works nice as well.  My mother taught me to use the bread bag as storage after you cut the rolls up to save in the freezer so if you are short on freezer bags, rest easy.  You can freeze these and bring em to a party later.  They take such a short time to cook that if you bring a throw away baking sheet its easy on these hostess.  Go to the bakery at your grovery store to get sesame seeds in bulk, their as costly in jars.  Make sure to get all white meat crab.  All brands were no created equal in crab.  I like Geisha brand the best.

These were fantastic and easy!  Everyone loved them!  I took another reveiwers advice and added a little Old Bay to the butter and just brushed them with the mixture rather than dipping them.  Great recipe!

Just too much butter for me.  I will try again and brush with butter instead of dipping in the butter.

This was delicious! Although I did make a few changes.. I found the mixture to be a little bland so I seasoned it a bit more. Also, I'm not a big fan of seseme seeds so Instead I used italian bread crubs and it came out super crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.

I LOVED THIS and so did my party guests. :]

Holy Butter! But maybe that is what makes this recipe so tasty!! I remember my mom making these when I was younger and I made them this past weekend. I only broiled 6 rolls and will keep the others on hand in the freezer. I may try to cut down on the butter in the cheese mixture as it looked like more butter than I needed. Love them!!

I'm not sure why I expected processed cheese and white bread to taste like anything other than just that, but I was disapointed. You couldn't taste any crab, and they were very messy to make. I won't try these again.

Easy, fast, and freezes well. What more do you need in an appetizer? This is a great recipe to make on a boring day and then freeze until you need them. I think they'd even make a good kid's snack. Just don't tell them there's crab in it until after they've eaten the whole plate!
