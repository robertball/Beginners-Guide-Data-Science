Very nice, simple recipe. I used extra long grain basmati rice. Pre-soaked the rice for maximum length and fullness. High quality rice and rose water make this one pop!

This was delicious and so easy to make with such few ingredients.  Perfectly sweet.  I used basic plain white rice and the texture was perfect.  Not a solid mass but not soupy.  Sets up very nicely.  Great served with fresh fruit. I would like to try it by switching out the rose water with orange blossom water next time.

I thought this was very good. I liked the rosewater addition. I used skim milk as that was what was in the fridge and it came out fine. I used Uncle Ben's Jasmine rice and Sugar in the Raw to make this
