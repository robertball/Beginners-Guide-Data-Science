7.7.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/240756/white-chocolate-chip-ginger-cookies/ ... This is more of a spice cookie than ginger.  Even though I added all of those four spices, I was still expecting a ginger cookie.  'Can't say I much enjoyed a spice cookie with white chocolate chips, but I think I would a ginger.  'Had to add more flour.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
