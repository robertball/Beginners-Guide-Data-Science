This is great!  I read the recipe a little differently than the other reviewers because I didn't finely crush the graham crackers.  I crumbled them into small to medium pieces and mixed them with the remaining ingredients.  After baking, the graham cracker pieces were almost caramelized and delicious!  I spread it out on a well greased cookie sheet and underbaked it a little.  Next time I will definitely bake it for the full 15 minutes.  I will also add a little more graham crackers because there is plenty of brown sugar mixture.  The graham crackers are good enough just to snack on.  I skimped a little on the salt but will use the full amount next time because the little bit of salt that you get every now and then is great with the sweetness of the brown sugar.  This is a must try recipe!

This was a great way to use up an almost empty box of graham cracker crumbs! I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup of the graham cracker crumbs that you buy in a box. This topping was great over out homemade vanilla ice cream, but it didn't get too crunchy until after it had cooled completely. Still, I think it tastes 100 times better warm. To heat up the topping, simply heat it in your toaster oven in a small metal tray or on aluminum foil. This topping tasted a lot like the crumbly topping on many apple pies and also had a hint of a toffee flavor.

Good recipe, but I like my instructions to be a little more specific so I minimize the chance of screwing things up. I finely crushed most of the crackers, leaving a few bits bigger for contrast. I shouldn't have dashed it with salt - I used salted butter and it seemed a little salty - my mistake. Also, I underbaked based on other reviews, and the fact that I pre-made it for later in the day, so I could reheat it before dessert. After initial prep, and before baking, it seemed a little sweet, so I added one more graham cracker. Go ahead - it can take it. I also don't think you need to sprinkle with the white sugar, but if that's your thing, go for it. It tastes like a very sweet graham cracker crust (key lime, cheesecake, etc.). I think next time I'll cut the sugar topping out, bake it lower and slower for more crunch, and throw them in a homemade s'mores ice cream or cheesecake ice cream recipe. That would be tasty, because most graham crackers dissolve when mixed into ice cream. Not bad!

Awesome! I will definitely make this again! I stirred this into icecream and milk and made a "milkshake". The only change/ suggestion i would make for this recipe is to only bake it for 10 minutes instead of 15 . I baked it for the entire 15 and it tasted slightly burnt.

Yummy--be sure to not overcook.  Had trouble making the topping last until put on the ice cream--even good plain!

A little too sweet, but so different from the usual ice cream toppings.  It adds variety to an ice cream sundae bar.

Very nice. I've made it in the oven, as well as in a skillet on the stove, and it turned out well either way. I served it over "Five Ingredient Ice Cream" and it made a welcome change from our regular company desserts.

It didn't wow me so I don't think I will make it again unless I need a bunch of toppings if having people for ice cream. It was ok & I liked the crunch with the ice cream & that was about it. Served it over marshmallow ripple ice cream with chocolate saice for a s'mores like sundae

This was yummy for our ice cream social.  I doubled the recipe and should have given it extra time.  Received many compliments and people asked how I made it.

This really is a great way to use those last graham crackers and crumbs that the children sometimes never eat--just open another box (grrrr).  The flavors are just right.

So delicious! I used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to suit my tastes and it was perfect. I made no other changes and stored extras in a tightly sealed jar. Served over cheesecake ice cream with caramel sauce. Amazing combination of flavours. Will definitely be making this one over and over. Thanks for sharing.

This would have tasted so good if I hadn't mistaken the Celsius for the Fahrenheit temperature, and baked it for 175 degrees for 15 minutes! Once I realized my mistake, I tried again with the correct temperature but then it overcooked... it tasted GREAT before I cooked it though! I'll totally try to make this again sometime in the winter maybe. Thanks! ~Bae 0:-)

We called this graham CRACKer topping! Very tasty and it tastes good at room temp too. A friend that tried it suggested it would make a great pie crust and I agree.

Very delicious - highly recommend this recipe!  I used it as a filling layer in a layered cake.  Also used the leftovers as an Ice Cream topping!

Changes I made:

- Omitted Cinnamon.
- Doubled recipe and used 1 cup (3.9 ounces) Graham Cracker Crumbs
- Sprinkled with Toasted Granulated Sugar.
- Used India Tree Dark Muscovado Sugar instead of Brown Sugar.
- Baked for 24 minutes, stirring every 8 minutes.

Great topping for sundaes, as well as on yogurts. Just store in small plastic storage bowl.

I used 4 graham cracker sheets instead of two, but I used the same amount of the other ingredients and sprinkled it all over as a crunch topping for a 13" x 9" pan of noodle pudding.  I kept watching it because the noodle pudding had to bake for 1-1/2 hours, so I was afraid the topping would get too done or burn....but it didn't!!  It was perfect!!!  Will be using this recipe again!

This was awesome!! I used it on my pumpkin pie as a topping with powdered sugar for a holiday dessert where some family is allergic to nuts (pie recipe has a nut topping), and everyone loved it- even better than the nut topping. And, any extra is fun to eat as "candy."

I used this for on top of my strawberries stuffed with cheese cake filling. They were gone in no time.
