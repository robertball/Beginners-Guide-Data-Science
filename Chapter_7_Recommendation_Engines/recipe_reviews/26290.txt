Hi, this is Corrie who posted the recipe. Just a few corrections. Ground Italian sausage is best in the recipe, not sliced. Also, be sure to use canned Italian style tomatoes and crush them beneath your fingers as you add them to the sauce. Bon appetit!

Outstanding!  We try to stick with the recipe as written whenever possible, but with ingredients on hand, we made a minor adjustment or three.  We had a pound of Italian sausage (I guess you'd call it "sweet"), so we browned (in cast iron skillet) and drained it well.  Then, we added 2 T olive oil before adding the onions and 8 cloves garlic.  When all this was browned, we added the Merlot wine to help loosen all the good stuff carmelized in the pan, then combined everything in a separate pot to simmer.  We don't like the flavor of higher acid foods like tomatoes when cooked in cast iron.

This was a starter for me. I changed it around quite a bit from the original. I went to the local pizza place and borrowed some of their sausage topping. I omitted the wine for lack of having it on hand. I used scallions and cilantro. And 4 garlic cloves (I love garlic).Threw it all together in a flash. It was way better than the jar variety.

LOVE this recipe!  This is the only way my husband and I will eat spaghetti now.  I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.  It is delicious and flavorful just as is!

After reading the reviews I am wondering if people realize just how much their selections of ingredients affects their recipe. If you use Del Monte whole tomatoes and then use another brand later you get a different sauce. And the suasage....wow, talk about variation. Half the fun of cooking a great meal is searching your area for the best sausage that YOU like. Ask around, ask grandma which butcher knows how to make sausage, which brand she likes. Isernios out of the package is pretty lean as sausage goes. The stuff you buy in the meat counter as the grocery store is silly.  Look for a independent meat market where the butcher make his own. Or better yet, get some nice lean Pork Butt, grind it up and get a good recipe here on the web....its silly simple. You don't need perfectly good pork wrapped in a casing to call it sausage. Where did that casing come from? Is it natural? It is adding to the flavor of the sauce?  And the wine. Do some homework and try several kinds of wine. Find one that suits you, you're eating it. Lastly, when making your sauces and trying them out, be sure to write down the little things that make one sauce different from the other. Make sure the recipe as the brand of ingredient, time of year purchased or whatever you will need to make that sauce for company. If you don't take notes you will not likely get the same exact ingredients next time and when company comes and you are expecting a certain taste....well you get the point.

My husband said this was the best homemade sauce he's had.  It's now my favorite recipe.  I doubled the recipe (but not the wine) but used 1 can crushed tomatoes and 1 (28 oz) can whole peeled (and crushed them with my hands); I also used hot sausauge and added 1 Tbs of sugar.  After browning, I cooked everything in a slow cooker on low all day (8-9hrs).  DELICIOUS!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was an interesting starting point, but only that.  Not enough flavour for the time it takes, in my opinion (simmering time to cook sausages, that is, not effort - admittedly the recipe is easy).  Frying sausages might improve flavour a bit, I don't know.  Could also try adding some different spices or fresh veggies, perhaps some fresh tomatoes along with the crushed ones from a can.  I guess I just like more complicated tomato sauces!  Followed recipe exactly, simmered about an hour on fairly low heat.

This is a very tasty spaghetti sauce.  The wine gives it a distinctive taste.  I did use less wine than called for, and I added a can of tomato paste and some Italian seasoning. And I added a little extra garlic.   Everyone raved over it.

This was very good but felt it needed "something".  Think using hot italian sausage and some italian seasonings would be a nice addition.

Very, very good. Added a little bit of salt and fresh ground pepper. Simple = Great. How much better than that. The leftover merlot went great with the pasta.

I liked it.My kind of ingredients for spaghetti sauce. I'm planning on using the leftover sauce for pizza. Next time I may add Italian seas. & another can of tomato paste- I like mine thick. Might simmer longer next time, too. I used sweet Italian turkey sausage, not links.

This made a great sauce.  I did make a few changes- added about a tablespoon of sugar, a teaspoon of Italian seasoning, some seasoned ground pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Served over home made spinach cheese ravioli (also from this site).  Got rave reviews and mmmmmmmsssss  all night.

This is the absolute best recipe I have found, ever! My husband and I are not drinkers but we had leftover merlot from company and I made this recipe. My husband does not like spaghetti because of his past but he gave me two thumbs up and requested I make it again. Not something he does. I put the sauce in the crockpot for 4 hours on high and added cooked macaroni noodles right before serving to make more of a goulash. I did add only half of the merlot recommended because I knew it would be strong of a flavor for non-drinkers.

Very good but I used less wine, more garlic, Italian seasoning, anise, a bit of water, NEVER use green peppers in spaghetti sauce (definitely not Italian style) I took the casing off hot Italian sausage then crumbled it into the sauce so the flavor penetrates as it cooks - YUM!

Although fast and easy to prepare, I believe it would have been more like a restaurant style if you used whole sausage links and didn't slice them in.  Otherwise it was great.

I added about a tablespoon of sugar, maybe a bit less than a tablespoon, because I found it lacked flavour and was too zesty, probably due to the wide variety of italian sausage availiable on the martket, and this just made it superb.  It definitely has a special taste, and I would be skeptic about serving it to guests because it sure isn't your ypical sauce, but I will make this again for myself.

I loved this sauce, I did add a bellpepper, other than that kept it the same, Second time I made it, I made a double batch and froze half, I made stuffed shells and poured this sauce over it, and it was the bomb! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Not sure why this got "best" reviews.  I followed this recipe to a "T".  I splurged on $8.00 per Jar "heirloom" tomatoes from Italy and did the "exact" recipe.  My sauce separated when I served it, watery on bottom, chunky on top (simmered in Crock Pot all day).  Also was very "sweet" which I like but this was a total disappointment.  Sorry!

Very good!  I used Italian style turkey sausage and Chianti instead of Merlot because that's all I had.  I also added some Italian seasoning.  Will make again. Thank you!

As it cooked down the sauce kept thickening so I little by little added some more Merlot.  I'd say I ended up using a cup as the recipe calls for.  Excellent recipe.

The sausage may impart a little of oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, and fennel seed, flavors but not enough.

Excellent!  I made a few changes:  I omitted the Merlot and sausage. I increased the garlic to 6 cloves.  I added 1 cup of vegetable stock, a pinch of oregano, 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, a pinch of garlic salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of Italian salad dressing mix.  The Significant Other said it was the best he ever had.  I will definitely make it again but next time I think I'll add some mushrooms as well.  Thank you kindly for this delicious recipe.

Needs more Italian flavor. I added another garlic clove, 2 tsp dried basil,  and 1 tsp dried oregano. Also 1 tsp salt, pepper and 1 tsp sugar. I like the addition of merlot and sausage but prefer ground.

Love the fresh taste and the Italian sausage really adds so much. Much better than ground beef. I have a feeling leftovers will be even better!

Absolutely the worst sauce I've ever made!  Had to keep adding ingredients to try to save it!

Very good! I used1 lb of Italian sausage (loose) , added about 1/2 T. Oregono and 1t. Basil and 1t. Sugar.  Let it simmer a couple of hours....makes the House smell great.
