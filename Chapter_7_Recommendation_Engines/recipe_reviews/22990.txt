I made mocha cupcakes, and they were really good.  I didn't use coffee liqueur, but I used a Dutch chocolate liqueur, and it was very tasty.  They weren't dry at all, but this is probably because I checked them quite frequently, since I didn't know how long they should cook.  I'd definitely make it again, especially for one of my vegan friends!

This was just ok.  The cake had a nice flavor, but was very dry.  The frosting was good, but it needed a lot of tweaking to get the flavor/consistency right (I just kept adding a little more of everything until it seemed right).  I don't think I'd make this again.

I used Bailey's Mint chocolate liquor, as what was on hand. The cake was a "little" dry, because of the burn off, of the alcohol. The frosting recipe was off... it was way too thick, so I ended up mixing in a 1/2 cup of butter and more coffee to the right consistency. Over all the flavors were present.
