I luv this recipe! Great for us because we don't use enriched bleached products. I didn't use nuts or chocolate chips. I close creamy almondbutter, but I will be using this again! Thanks

Very very dry.  The first batch I did, I forgot to put the cookies on the lower rack for the first 5 min and cooked them the entire 10 min on the upper rack and they came out ok (but very dry as I already mentioned).  For the second batch I did what the recipe said and cooked them on the lower rack the first 5 min and then on the upper rack for the last 5 min and they ended up burnt on the bottoms.  I would suggest making sandwich cookies with these and filling the middle with fig jam or mashed dates to add a bit of wet to them.  Also, if I were to redo them, I would only cook them on the upper rack for 8 min to keep them a bit more moist.

Yum!  I used toasted almond slivers (chopped a bit) and a 50% more vanilla and salt, though it probably didn't need it. For fun, I made 15 bigger cookies and undercooked them by a couple minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe with spelt flour!

Loved this recipe..because I used my Vitamix to blend the wet ingredients, some got trapped near the blades, so I had to add a little extra butter to get the entire batch wet. 
They are a tad on the dry side but if you like a chewier cookie, try reducing both the time and the temp.  
I did do 4 min on the bottom rack and 4 on the top and they had a crunch that was nice.
They taste pretty awesome.  I ate 4 tiny cookies and had to force myself to put them away.  I will make these again.  Didn't miss regular flour at all:)

Very dry so added 1/4 of a cup of water in then it was fine. I made it into 1 giant cookie, put goji berries on the top and used truvia instead of the sugar so I didn't really follow the recipe

Great Cookies! I made a few minor changes.
First I added 1/2 TSP Vanilla Extract extra, then instead of the optional Pecans, I used Toasted Large Flake Coconut. These changes were just made due to personal preference.
Next, I lowered the temperature to 175 Degrees C, and I did not change from the lower shelf to the higher shelf. 
I made these changes because I have a  ridiculously tiny oven (pretty much a European apartment standard) that runs hot and the higher shelf is practically touching the top. 
So even with that, I would still take them out after only 8 minutes when I cook them next, which I definitely will!

Delish!  I tried these as a healthier/better for you/more filling lunch box option for my kids and these had great appeal because of the higher protien of spelt, where most healthy recipes lean on nuts (which isn't an option for kids going to school ).  My kids loved these (and I even added wheat bran and germ and hemp seeds) which is a stunning achievement because my kids like virtually nothing at all.  I'll be making these forever I bet.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great simple wheat free cookies. Be sure to use unsalted butter, otherwise they are a little too salty.They are lightly sweetened, which is nice, but I may add an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar next time.

I enjoyed this cookie.  I didn't have spelt flour so I used whole wheat and milled flax seed.  Tasty, crispy, and not too sweet.  They spread a little too much, though.
