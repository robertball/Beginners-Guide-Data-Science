These turned out super cute and tasted like cotton candy. The recipes was easy to follow. I had never made meringue before and was leery of it after I tried to make macaroons but these were perfect. They will be a nice addition to my holiday plates.

I loved this recipe! Super easy to make, which since this was my first time making meringue, was appreciated! I decided to put more red coloring and not do the sprinkles. I also let mine cool outside the oven! Great job!!

I made this exact recipe from the Family Fun magazine back in 2004, I am still making it.  They are super easy to make and liked by all who eat them.  The second picture is the one used in the Family Fun magazine...They are SUPER CUTE!!

Horrible recipe.. Very little guidance about how long to whip it for and the first time I made it, it came out so runny I had to toss the whole batch and start over...don't waste your time unless you are experienced in making meringue.
