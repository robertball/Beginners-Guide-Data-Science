This is the best cole slaw I've ever eaten!!  I did change it just a tad though... I used vegan grapeseed oil (veganaise) instead of mayonaise, and I cut the amount of sweetening in half, replacing the sugar with local honey.  I then blended all in a food processor.  INCREDIBLE!!  I gave 4 stars because of the changes.

This was great!!  I reduced the sugar to only about a tablespoon, and it could actually be omitted all together.

I made this almost exactly as directed. I needed a quick cole slaw recipe and after searching for one that used the vinegar I had on hand, I found this one! It's perfect, even though I omitted the bacon (We didn't have any in the house) and I also omitted the celery seed because I'm not a big fan but I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone! Will for sure try with the bacon next time!

I made this according to recipe. Kids wouldn't touch it, husband was indifferent, I thought it was too sweet. This will be good on ham sandwiches tomorrow, but I don't know that I'd make it again.

Awesome! I made this the night before and it was so easy... only change I made was to use garlic flavored red wine vinegar since that was all I had on hand. so good!

Meh.  This really wasn't impressive to either my husband or myself.  The bacon was just kind of weird.  I just wasn't super impressed.  Thanks for posting, but I won't make it again.

I made this for a family party and it was terrific!  My family loved the addition of bacon.  The slaw was sweet, but that's the way we like it.  I'll make this many times with absolutely no changes!

Great recipe so easy :) But did make some changes, halfed the dressing blend (mayo, vinegar, sugar) and used white wine vinegar.  The bacon makes it special thank you.

Great recipe! Everyone at our tailgate party loved it. We did make some changes due to availability of ingredients. We used cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar and sweet onion instead of the green onion. It was terrific even with the changes. We will definitely make this again!

This is delicious. My family is very picky about delicious cole slaw, and this one was a hit. I used rice vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and cut back just a bit on the sugar as others has suggested.

This was great. So simple and so tasty. I love the fact that you don't have to let it sit in the fridge for 24 hrs. before serving. Will be making again.

Skipped the celery seed, reduced the sugar to 1/8 cup and the mayo to 2/3 cup (our bag of broccoli slaw was only a 12oz bag) -- but otherwise made recipe as written -- absolutely fabulous!  Will definitely become a staple here!  Thanks!

Surprisingly, I really enjoyed this.  It is so simple to make and the bacon is a great addition.  I did not have celery seed so I added a little celery salt which cut the sweet somewhat.  I will make this again.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe.  I served along with some burgers and tater tots.  The only change was that I used white wine vinegar instead of red because that was what I had on hand.  I thought the flavor was better the next day.

I cut this recipe in half because it makes too much for a pound of cabbage. I also left off the bacon and cut down on the sugar. I sweetened it to taste so it was still a bit tart. Great recipe!!

Fantastic slaw! Without the bacon, it's got the perfect balance between sweet and tangy! The bacon adds the perfect smoky / salty note to take it to the extent level! Wow!

I added: grated small onion and left out the green onion, black pepper, more mayo, red wine vinegar.  Used 2 packets of truvia instead of sugar. Doesn't need salt. Fine Grated carrots and coarser grated cabbage, and celery seed. Didn't use the bacon but one day I will. It's delish. Just adjust ingredients to your taste. I do that with all cooking except baked goods. That's my mamas department. :)
