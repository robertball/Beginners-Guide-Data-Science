Fast and easy.  Think it needs some green beans as well.  I'd use chicken stock and only one cup of tomato sauce... and in summer a chopped fresh tomato or two.  I'll throw in some leftover homemade pasta which cooks super fast.  This would also be great with beef marrow ravioli!

From the description I thought I would love this recipe. I like the vegetable ingredients, but the spaghetti sauce overpowered the soup. I'll try it again, and when I do I'll cut back to half spaghetti sauce and half chicken broth.
