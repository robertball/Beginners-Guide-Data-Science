This is absolutely amazing.  I didn't have Jasmine rice, and couldn't find it at the store, so I used white rice.  It was creamy, the chicken was PERFECTLY cooked (I used frozen chicken tenderloins and cooked them at 8 minutes as posted), the cheese was the perfect amount....there was nothing bad about this recipe.  I served it with sour cream because sour cream makes EVERYTHING taste better!

I added fresh bell peppers to the chicken.  This was not only ultra easy and very yummy

Not my favorite.  The chicken and rice were cooked perfectly but there was way too much lime juice in it. All I could taste was lime. My husband liked it okay but I will not be making this again

I didnâ€™t expect it to be soooo good!! I already had rice cooked so I put it over that. Great leftover for lunch the next day! Will make again regularly.

awesome recipe! I used 6 thighs though. At first I blended 2 Roma tomatoes 1 jalapeno lime juice garlic powder, salt, pepper and pressure cooked it for 15 minutes with the chicken and added mushrooms. I then used the rest of the juice for the rice.

Loved this!  I'm sure it is great as written but I like to use fresh garlic. So I used fresh garlic in place of garlic salt and extra lime juice.  I did use (as suggested) hot salsa instead of medium.  We're having it over brown rice for dinner.  Will definitely make again

I've made this a few times and it's always a hit.  The lime is a nice balance with the tomato.  When I remove the chicken after cooking, I typically have my toaster oven warmed up and use a small serving bowl covered with aluminum foil to keep the chicken warm while the rice is cooking.

This was so good! I'm new to Instant Pot and I'm always searching for recipes. The rice was very flavorful. I used thighs, because it was what I had in the freezer and they were fall-apart tender.  To go from frozen to table in less than an hour? How can you argue?

First recipe in my new instapot!  It came out delicious.  However, I had to improvise a lot because of what I had available.   Used thighs instead of breasts,  a can of dice tomatoes, I didn't  have any salsa.  Added Chipotle pepper and some cilantro flakes.  used regular rice and it was perfect.

White rice works great! Also the sour cream suggestion helps too. Family loved this and it's easy.

It was alright; nothing special. Tender.  Didn't save time over the oven. I didn't make the rice in the pressure cooker because I didn't want the chicken to get cold or dried out if I kept it warm.  Made extra sauce and cooked rice in it in a rice maker.

It was pretty good. Extra juicy but I replaced the tomato sauce with fire roasted tomatoes.
