I have tried these a couple times and the kids love them. What I really suggest is that you slice the potatos thin and then soak in HOT water for 20 minutes. This removes quite a bit of starch. then dry well before frying. Tonight my wife dug some old potatoes out that had actually gotten eyes sprouting on them and they turned out better than fresh potatoes. The starch level was much lower and they turned out golden brown and crispy! thank you for the recipie!

Im sorry, but I have to say that my family didn't even get to try these.  As fast as I was making them, I was eating them.

The only problem that I came across with the recipie is my inability to slice anything paperthin.

I did two half batches.  One that followed the recipe, and the other one where instead of soaking the potatoes in water I soaked them in vinegar.  Both turned out great.  I only soaked the potatoes in vinegar for probably ten minutes max, as I felt too long may take away from the original taste.

Thanks for the great recipe.  I'm going to keep this on hand, and next time when I make them I will most definately make the batch a lot bigger.

I love this recipe, because it's basic enough to add to.  I felt comfortable making changes to suit my taste.  For example, i soaked the potatoes overnight in a solution half vinegar/water (I love vinegar chips).  I also made a batch with sweet potatoes following the recipe, including salt soak, but then finishing with a cinnamon-sugar shake.  Enjoyable and easy.  Highly recommended.

Incredible! I followed the recipe exactly. I used vegetable oil to fry these in. I used a slicer that has 5 slots on it- it is just like a flat cheese grater. It works great! Do make sure the potatoes you slice are paper thin. The whole "chip" will not get golden brown which is fine but as previous rating stated do wait for them to get a slight golden brown. I also have put these in a plastic bag to store them in. Use very very little salt if you resalt these after frying. These taste like Lays regular potato chips. Thank you sooo very much for this recipe! No more store bought potato chips for this family!

Fantastic! After using my French mandoline to slice 3 potatos to nearly transparent slices, it looked like more than enough chips. I reduced the salt to 2 tbls. These fried up beautifully. Only thing I'll change next time is to lightly salt them right out of the fryer. Also, I placed chips onto a paper-towel lined cookie sheet and kept in the oven at 275 degrees until all the batches were fried. Came to the table hot and crispy. Thanks!

I remember having these at home growing up.I just want to add,be sure to blot-dry the potatoe slices to prevent oil splattering.We skipped the salt soak.The important thing is cold soak to rid of excess starch.

Simply devine! I'd have to agree with the other cook who used the budded potatoes.  I had a bag full that has started to grow little buds and hated to throw them away.  My hubbie made these chips and they turned out devine!  We didn't need to soak them because most of the starchiness had been used up when the potatoes started sprouting eyes.

where else but allrecipes would you find a recipe for potato chips, this one was great and came out nice and crunchy even though we(my boyfriend and i) could not get all of the chips paper thin we made all kinds of variations the first time because 4 potatoes turned out to be a lot of chips we did the original recipe with the salt we also did vinegar but that needs setting over night because it did not have a strong vinegar flavour after the hour. next we tried a blackpepper red pepper and garlic sesoning we found in the cupboard this one in my mind came out the best because it had a really intense flavour and thats the way we like it in the caribbean. the last one we tried was a mixture of maggie cubes the blackpepper garlic seasoning and barbeque seasoning that one is still in the fridge we already had enough chips and we were eating while they were frying.we put the leftovers in a zip lock bag and two days later we ate them and they tasted as if we just opened a bag of chips nice and crunchy.

We did a taste test between this recipe and the microwaved potato chip one.  This recipe won hands down.  We used regular vegetable oil with some sesame oil added for additional flavor.  Very good recipe.

These weren't bad at all! I gave up trying to slice them with a knife, and used the potato peeler instead - worked really well. They tasted great with a little sprinkle of salt. They aren't so good when they cool though. Thanks!

Yum! I made just made these and half the batch is gone already. Like an other reviewer, I used my potato peeler to make the slices and it worked out just fine. I did two batches with different seasonings, one with salt and vinegar the other was bbq. I just mixed sugar, smoked paprika, garlic powder and a little salt and they were slammin'. Thanks for a delicious easy recipe!

Made as recipe states and they were great. Then made again and used sugar instead of salt in the second soak. This made for a crispier chip. Finish with whatever seasoning you like. Everyone enjoyed them.

I live in an area of the world where I can't just run out and by a mandolin or a food processor, or even a potato peeler. I was envious of all the reviewers who were raving about these chips. Then I remembered that I had a Ginsu knife and I thought I'd give it a try. Well, the Ginsu knife worked wonders! Only half the chips ended up on the plate... it was one for the cook, one for you, one for the cook, one for you. They were delicious. However, I need some tips on keeping them crisp. After they cooled, the chips were limp. I tried heating them in the oven. I tried cooking them longer, cooking at a higher heat, cooking at a lower heat, drying them on a towel, on a cooling rack... all with the same results. The only way I could enjoy a crispy chip was to eat them immediately from the fryer... which wasn't so bad!! I live in a very humid climate. Any ideas??

I went chip crazy.  I had a 10 pound bag of potatoes that was budding so went in search of a recipe and found this one.  Since other reviewers said that potatoes that were sprouting eyes made better chips I thought this would be a perfect use for those potatoes.  I'm not totally insane, I only did 5 pounds of chips.    I didn't peel the spuds, but sliced them all on my mandoline, making 1/2 of them paper thin and the other 1/2 slightly thicker and crinkle cut.  I left the salt out of the water because I planned to experiment with a lot of different toppings.  I soaked the potatoes as instructed and changed the water several times. I saved a small batch of chips for vinegar and salt chips and soaked them in a vinegar and water solution for a couple of hours.    For the oil, I mixed olive oil and canola oil.  The chips turned out great and I topped them with everything from plain salt to my dry rib rub, which turned out surprisingly good.  The best concoction was shallot salt from Penzey's. The only failure were the vinegar chips.  For some reason, the potato slices soaked in vinegar retained the oil and they were really greasy.  They might have tasted OK, but they were so greasy that I didn't even want to try them.  Overall, this was a great recipe and the chips turned out great.

I grew up on these tasty chips and it's great to see the recipe in print for others to use.
Definitely dry the potatoes before frying. I always lay them out on a lint-free dishtowel and press them dry. It's quicker than blotting and since the chips are seperated before going into they oil they cook more evenly.
Keep an eye on them though as they brown really fast!

I just finished making a batch of these and wow, they are so good!  I'm making them for my husband so I tried to use some self control while sampling them.  It would be fun to experiment with different seasonings!  I used the thick side of my cheese grater, they really were 'paper' thin and I think that's probably the best way to make them.  Also, be sure to really dry your potatoes off before frying them...use a towel though, paper towel will stick to them (learned that the hard way).  Delicious!

Crispy-Krunchy! Just a few changes/revisions-lower temp and longer fry time makes the center as crisp as the edges. Garlic chips are my favorite so we dried the slices then soked an hour in garlic salted water, dried then fried and then tumbled in garlic powder. Went over big at the tailgate party

This was my first time trying homemade chips, as well as using my new fryer! I also used potatoes that had started to "eye", and I had them in water for only about 20 minutes before towel drying them and frying. I also did not soak them in salt water, just tap water. I don't have a special tool for slicing them, so I used a potato peeler to make the slices. For us, this was the perfect consistency and chip size. I fried each batch for six minutes, and it was perfectly golden/brown. I put them onto a plate with a towel, and then salted them immediately. My whole family devoured them! My six year old daughter said that they were the best chips she'd ever eaten. Really great!

These were fun to make and really tasted like Cape Cod Russet chips. I did use russet poatoes cut lengthwise in half and ran them through the food processor.

Making potato chips at home is a fun and easy with this recipe.  My fiance and I made these almost everyday for a week because we were hooked.  The first few batches came out alright but we played around with a few ideas and they came out heavenly.  We experimented with the thickness of the slices and the temperature on our deep fryer as well as the soaking time for the potatoes to absorb the flavor of the vinegar.  We realized that the thickness of the slices did not matter as long as the temperature was low (340 degrees) enough to cook the potato all the way through so it would be crispy without burning the chips.  As for the soaking time, it varies.  Of course the longer you let it soak the better, if you really want a strong vinegar flavor, we did not dilute the vinegar.  While the chips are cooling on some paper towels, we sprinkled some sea salt and the rest is history.

So easy, yet so good!  I used one large baking potato, which I peeled into potato ribbons, soaked cold for about 10 minutes, dried, then fried in about 1 inch of oil.  I found that I did need to salt them as they came out for added flavor, and I can't wait to try other seasonings.  This was the perfect amount for 2-4 people as a side dish...a little less than you would get in a gourmet/regular size chip bag.  Sweet potatoes are coming next!  Thanks!

This is my FAVORITE recipe for potato chips.  I have made them several times but they never last long enough to get a photo.  The important thing is to cut them paper thin.  I did not peel the potato as I think the skin gives it more flavor.  Thank you Almalou for sharing your recipe.

Love 'em!  Simple, easy & fantastic.  We like our chips with seasoned salt & pepper on them and then dip the chips in ranch dressing.  Delicious!

I just made these for the first time, and I kept it simple, but I wanted to pass on the technique that I used: I washed and removed eyes from 4 red potatoes, but did not peel them. Some of my taters were sprouting from their eyes already. I sliced them with my pampered chef mandoline slicer, so it only has the one thin slicing blade. I soaked the slices in cold water, changed the water several times, and the last soaking I added a hefty amount of salt. Rinsed them again, laid the slices on kitchen cloths/paper towels, and patted them dry.
I heated my 10-inch cast iron frying pan, added about 1/2 cup canola oil, and brought it up to heat (level 8 out of 10 on a gas stove). I added potato slices so they could float freely side-by-side, not stacked on top of each other. I found that using 2 long-tined dinner forks were perfect for moving them, turning them, and removing them to a waiting paper-toweled cookie sheet, where I sprinkled them with salt. They were delicious! 
The first bunch were probably undercooked, as I was afraid of burning them, but the later batches were crispy on the edges, barely soft in the middle, perfect! I will make these again! I wish I had some malt vinegar to sprinkle over them right now!

I followed cmatlock's advice to use HOT water, because it made sense. And used a veggie peeler to make the slices. Came out PERFECT! (and this could be a problem...couldn't stop eating them...) also, I used grape seed oil for two reasons: it's a healthier fat & it has a very high burn point. I use it for all of my frying.
Thanks for the recipe!

These were great, important to slice them as thin as possible....I used my kitchen Aid stand mixer with teh slicer attachment, and it wasn't thin enough. still tasted great, but could have been alot thinner.  next time I use the mandolin slicer. I agree also, soak in water to remove starch, or use older potatoes.

I have been making these for years, and the only thing I would like to add is to slice them thin I have been using a cheese slicer.  The one that looks like a small spatula with a slotted blade in it.

HOLY MOLY! I didn't believe this would work, but it did! I just bought a slicer & thought I would look into a potato chip recipe. My husband & I were both really skeptical that these would turn out. My whole family LOVES them! We did what one reviewer said and used cooking spray instead of oil in the bag. Sliced the potatoes, put them on a paper towel (they only stuck a tiny bit after cooking-easy to peel off) sprayed the spray on, put salt/seasoning on them and nuked them for 3-4 minutes until brown. PERFECT! I tried using a plate to cook them on and all the heat went to the plate and it didn't work. Definitely use a paper bag/paper towel/paper plate to 'cook' them on.

This is what my mother made for us at home when we were kids!  Funny, these are our favorites now and at that time we wished that we could get "store bought" potato chips!  Go figure!  I've made these for years.  Some variations like sprinkling on thin shredded cheese and bacon crumbles.

these were really good.  My only suggestion is that if you do the salt soak, don't add salt after frying.  They would be way too salty at that point.

I don't have a deep fryer-I skimmed some reviews to see if anyone had made these without one & I didn't see one right off. So, I thought I might as well try... They turned out fine from the iron skillet, but it took FOREVER to fry them all! I should have cut the recipe in half! LOL!...Anyway, they tasted great! They did get soggy once cooled-I reheated them on a cookie sheet & they were crispier again.

Not bad.  Don't have a mandolin so my slices were uneven sizes, and I used red potatoes.  Also found out my deep fryer was broken after the potatoes were prepped so I made them in a large pot on the stovetop.  Just didn't taste spectacular to me though.

Thanks for the share.  The chips were delicious and easy to make.  The biggest problem was my lack of willpower to refrain eating chips before finishing latter batches.  I used a lil generic seasoning salt from F&E and the kids ate it all. I didn't have a mandolin cutter and instead used a peeler, it worked perfectly (just be careful).  :)

Great basic recipe that allows for a lot of personal taste adjustments! However, without a mandolin slicer or some serious knife-slicing skills (which I lack), getting the potatoes paper-thin is a real challenge. I ended up using the vegetable peeler, but be aware that because the potatoes lose a lot of bulk during frying, the thinner peeler slices will end up like a handful of crumbs from the bottom of the potato chip bag. :-( Also, don't make the same mistake I did and be too hasty to pull them out of the fryer or they will be soggy. Be sure to let them cook until a very *visible* golden brown; in fact, better to go too long than too short IMO. You can always adjust the cooking times for the other batches. We'll be making these again as soon as I can find my mandolin! :-)

Great! I don't like them too crispy so I cut them with a regular kitchen knife rather than a mandolin or the food processor blade. I reserve the salt for right after frying and I use sea salt. Delicious!

Fun! I actually made these several times ages ago, and I forgot to review them. :) Instead of slicing the potatoes, I used my vegetable peeler to peel off slices. I then followed the rest of the recipe. They turned out awesome! Be sure to stir the slices a bit once you put them in the fryer so they don't clump up. Thanks for sharing, Almalou!

I've been making a recipe simular to this one for years. To make it easier to slice the potatos I bought a slicing kitchen tool designed for this very thing. The only thing I do differently with this recipe is to add a light dusting of garlic powder, salt and a tiny bit of peprica for color. These are SO much better then any store bought chip brand and with this recipe you'll know exsactly what's going into it. If you are going to eat chips at all, make them at home!

Unbelievable!!!  Who knew you could do that!  I used PAM spray and lightly salted with Lawry's Seasoning afterwards.  I made 2 batches--one I cut on my box grater, and the other I pulled out the slicer on my Kitchenaid.  Without a doubt, the thinner slicer from the food processor were better.  they were done in 3 min and light and crispy!

I've made these for years and they are always a hit.  Some of the seasonings I've used have been malt vinegar, dill, and onion powder.  My family also loves Johnny's seasoning salt and a bit of chili powder on them for a little cajun-like taste.

I made these for the first time tonight, July, 17, 2014.  I was always afraid to try home made because I could never cut the potatoes thin enough.  I have an inexpensive mandolin that is perfectly suited for thin slicing. Once this was done the rest is easy!  My husband raved and said they were as good as Lays!  I know he was being kind, but I will take that compliment any time.  I finally got to try the last batch I made because I never brought them out to him!

When I attended a Tupperware party, I won this gizmo that spiral cuts potatoes, so I finally used it with this recipe, and they were just like we get at O'Charley's! So good and so addictive. They weren't all super crispy, but kind of like french fries. Yummy. I used red potatoes. Cooking took longer than expected, nearly 5-10 minutes/batch. So we started eating dinner while the 3rd (final) batch fried to get them before they got icky. I'm wondering if sweet potatoes would work?? I got my picky little kids to eat potatoes, anyway. Of course I ate a lot more than they did, probably about 2 (red) potatoes worth!

Always good when you make it at home. So simple with just 3 ingredients. I like to bake mine instead of frying them to be a bit healthier. I also add some chipotle seasoning to spice them up. And to add an "EXTRA KICK" I add Manchego cheese on top. So good.

good flavor, easy to make, but very time consuming.. One large potato is all you need for two people.  These are not good cold.

WOW what a great recipe this is! I have never tried to make homemade potato chips and I must admit that after following the recipe to a 'T' these were consumed as fast as they came out of the fryer. Poor chips never stood a chance! Next time I will definitely try other seasonings/brine.... maybe seasalt and vinegar MMmmm....

I have made these and they are to die for.  Yes make an extra large batch and "if" you have too many store them in a brown paper bag.

I've made these several times.  I always use my food process to slice the potatoes with skin on.  Much faster and more uniform slices.  My favorite way to serve is hot out of the deep fryer with Lowery's Seasoned Salt.  YUM!!!

These were great!  Something so simple, and yet so delicious.  I did not soak the chips, because I had some russet potatoes that were budding.  I used my Kitchenaid Food Processor on the small slicer and these were perfect for me.  I deep fried them in vegetable oil as that was what I had on hand.   I have a Fry Daddy and I was singly putting these in one layer and frying them and it was taking forever.  I decided to speed things up, by putting two layers in the oil.  What I did was, the frying ladle that came with my Fry Daddy, I kept playing with the chips to make sure that they were separated and weren't clumping together.  This worked perfectly, so I could fry up more chips per batch.  As soon as I saw that they were turning color I removed them to let them drain. (I don't personally like darkened chips)  I immediately sprinkled Mrs. Dash's Original Recipe over the chips as I cannot tolerate too much salt. These beat in gourmet chip that I have ever add.  I love Kettle Chips and Cape Cod, and this even tastes better than those.  I will never buy store bought chips again.  Thank you so much for sharing such a simple and delicious recipe.

The chips were amazing! Even though I didn't slice them thin enough, a few more minutes in the frying pan cooked them thorougly. Next time, I think I'll try putting the potato chips in vinegar and I would add a little more salt, because I really like salt. :)

I love these chips!  I did follow the recipe as written and would have changed one thing... the temperature of the oil.  I sliced my potatoes paper thin on the mandolin and for some reason, when cooked at 365 degrees, some potatoes would brown and have the burnt effect before others finished cooking and were still white / slightly raw.  I'm not sure of the solution for this except for maybe trying them at 350 degrees which I will do next time.  Regardless... great tasting chips and I will use this recipe again and again. I  used a steak seasoning and celery salt as a finish while they were right out of the oil and it was awesome!

These turned out pretty well, although I think my oil was too hot, because I had to cook them until they were pretty dark in order to get the middles crisp.  I sliced them with a potato peeler, so they were really thin.  It takes a lot longer to fry them all than I thought, even though each batch cooks fairly quickly, because it made a lot.

So easy and turned out so good! My family loved them. The recipe kind of reminds me of Cape Cod brand chips more so than Lays, which is perfectly fine with me.

My suggestion for this recipe is to use a mandolin to get the thin cut on the potatoe, it worked great.  Everything else went great.

One of the easiest 5 stars I've given.  As we were eating dinner, I realized that I hadn't even touched my sloppy joe I was so concerned that if I stopped they would be eaten by everyone else.  

My husband and I never fry food, but we decided to make these once a week from now on.

I really enjoyed these chips. Very easy to make and I especially like that it's a quick snack. Eat them while they're fresh/crispy; otherwise, it'll taste like a soggy chip...

Okay, I just finished cooking the first batch of thse, and they are absolutely amazing!  I couldn't get them quite paper thin with my vegetable slicer (they are about the thickness of the cardboard used in cereal boxes, maybe even a little thicker), but they still came out crispy and very tasty.  I have been cooling them on wire racks with a cookie sheet placed underneath to catch any stray oil, but so far there hasn't been much since most of it drains back into the deep fryer.  I hope the rest of the family gets to try these as well - they are disappearing fast!

I thought this was great - and so did my teenager.  It took us a couple of tries to get it right but the slices turned out crispy - just like the thin potato chips you buy in the store.  Be sure to keep them thin and cook until browned.  They do stick to the plate a little, we just used a butter knife to pop them off.

Great recipe.  I soaked the slices in salt water for 1 hour, then in a mixture of cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, and pepper for another hour before drying and frying them.  Also, I had to use a filet knife to slice the pieces (which worked GREAT).

Not bad chips are pretty basic when it comes to cooking. The one review just seems petty they can't cut the potato thin so they left  a bad review.

Hallelujah! Fried potato chips from the comforts of home. No need to go out to the sporting clubs or sandwich shops for these crunchy delights. I topped off my batch with a smattering of delicious Kerry Gold Pure Irish Butter. Kerry Gold  simply has no competition when it comes to consistent spreadability and smooth creamy finish. I may fry the things in the stuff for round two!

Perfect chips.  I sliced them thin with a mandoline and then fried at 360.  No need to even salt them as the salt solution provided enough seasoning.  I will making these again.  Not that great for my waistline, but so tasty!

I made these once last night, and again just a little while ago. My family and I LOVE these! They disappear faster than I can make them! Lol. I sprinkled some seasoned salt on them with black pepper. YUM!!!

These chips came out great. I have a good mandalin so they were nice and thin and I added some vinegar to the final rinse to avoid potatoes going brown. I also spread them all out on a towel to dry them out a bit for about 30 minutes on a hot day. Next time I will add vinegar and salt to the final rinse and not rinse after that

I hand sliced the potatoes very thin with a filet knife, skins on (I prefer them this way) and rinsed until the water was clear then soaked them in cold water, no salt, for a few hours. Patted them dry on paper towels before frying so as to not have any oil popping. I used peanut oil. I also tossed them in a bowl while sprinkling salt on afterwards, while they were still hot.

This is the best basic potato chip recipe. I did make some some changes as most people do.  I sliced them on my cheap mandolin on the thinnest setting, perfect by my standards for chips.  I soaked them in a sugar/hottest tap water mix for a good 10 minutes, drained and rinsed. Then returned to a ice cold salt water bath for 30 minutes.  Drain, rinse, and dry thoroughly. Fry as instructed, however, remove to a cooling rack so they don't sit in the oil dripping off. After all are done, fry once more for a minute or so for the super extra crispy.

Chips turned out great.  Cooking time is 5-7 minutes depending on how crowded your fryer is.  The chips will quit bubbling, which is a good sign that all of the water has been cooked out as steam.

I soaked according to directions.  I also pulled a handful off to the side and soaked in vinegar (according to reviewers). I used a mandolin and played with 2 different thicknesses... (paper thin and thin)  . just crisp them up according to directions.  

as far as playing in flavors,  I haven't really tried.  but the possibilities are endless.... like taking that powdered marinade meat rub,  or taking a spray bottle of vinegar.  

i can totally see making these for fish and chips.  

btw, ranch chips?  what about sprinkling that popcorn seasoning on them???

Came out great! I will definitely make them again. It did take a little longer to fry them since we like chips golden brown.  Next time i will sprinkle with black pepper too.

Made these per recipe & they are fantastic. Frying took about 5-6 min per batch & I made sure to check oil temp before adding a new batch. It's been 3 days (stored in brown paper bag on counter) & they are still crispy & fresh!

I used peanut oil and a mandolin to slice the potatoes extra thin and soaked in cold water 20 minutes and then dried well.  This made wonderful chips which after pulling out of the oil and allowing the oil to drip off onto a paper towel I sprinkled salt and a cajun spice mix that I made on top.  Wonderful home made chips, everyone enjoyed them.  There was not one left.

These chips turned out awesome. I only had small red potatoes but they worked amazing for this recipe. I let them soak in warm salt water for 1 hour before rinsing them, and dried them out for half an hour. They turned out super crisp, and I made them real thin with my food processor which is a MAJOR plus. Overall, this is one of the best recipes for potato chips I have ever made, and my family sure seemed to enjoy them too!

This worked well and tasted great. The toughest thing is getting the potatoes slicedthin and evenly.  Will definitely do it again.

I've never made homestyle chips before, but I thought these turned out pretty awesome! Plus any excuse to break out the mandolin to cut some waffle chips is a bonus.

These are wonderful. I didn't change anything, but I did soak them longer because my husband was delayed so I ended up soaking them for 2 hours. Mine were so crispy, I have never made homemade chips that crunchy before, Awesome! I saw some remarks about other peoples not being crispy enough, my suggestion would be take your time slicing the potatoes, don't rush it, slowly slice them as thin as possible, so thin you can almost see though it. This makes them perfectly crispy in the end. Enjoy! We did !

These were delicious. I seasoned with garlic salt and lowreys seasoning. I used vegetable oil and sliced by potato super thin with an awesome knife I got from Sweden.

Awesome in its simplicity! I received an air fryer as a gift and have been testing it out for various potatoes. For this one, I used a mandolin to slice 3 white potatoes as thin as possible (I can't slice anything paper thin with a knife without losing a finger). I then soaked the slices in cold water. Not sure if it would have been better soaking them in hot water so that is an experiment for another time.

It takes some time and patience, but an easy way to get paper-thin slices is to just take your potato peeler and peel off little slices.

Also, I like throwing some cayenne pepper onto the chips after taking them out of the fryer

I used a mixture of purple, baby reds, and yellow gold potatoes. I used cavenders Greek seasoning and cooked these in my cast iron skillet. Beautiful, crunchy potato chips in less than 5 minutes.

Unfortunately the attachment on my food processor could not help with this so I had to cut very thin slices of poatoes. So, prep took a bit longer but not a problem. It only took about 5 minutes in the the deep fryer. After removing them from the fryer, drained, salted they were great fresh and warm. The consistency did not hold up when they cooled off. Maybe an error on my part. I would recommend this as a fast way to fry potatoes but not as chips. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it will make a great fast way to fry potatoes.

Turned out great, only one problem: I had trouble drying up the potatoes well, since the slices ended up really thin. What happened is the oil from the fryer  started to burst out a bit, so had to do quite the cleanup. Otherwise, great results.

I don't have a fryer, so I used a deep fryer thermometer and a heavy sauce pan.  I have one of those slicer dicer things and used the thin blade.  I kept the oil at 350° and fried a few at a time until they were brown. . using a slotted spoon I transferred them onto a salted paper towel, then transferred them on a brown paper bag. this will keep them crispy.   they are quite good! yummy!

I didn't have a problem getting them thin enough, they came out nice and crunchy. I  Left the lid up on my deep fryer. You got to keep your eye on this like it's bacon. Doesn't take too much to burn them.

Fun thing to make with the kids on rainy days. Go to the popcorn section of your store and there are flavours like Sour Cream & Onion you can sprinkle on them. Home made flavoured chips YUM!

Delicious...and so crispy.  I used a vegetable peeler to get the potatoes paper thin.  I added a little more salt than the recipe called for in my water and they were a tad too salty so beware.  No need to add salt at the end either.  We will definitely be making these again!

Very good recipe.  I find if I don't peel the potatoes they cook better with no overcooked edges.  Also, found the red potatoes do not make as good chips as the "old" potatoes do.  Forgot to add that drying the slices between tea towels is needed for chips to cook properly.  If not they tend to cook unevenly and the cooking oil becomes diluted with all the moisture from the potatoes.

These were good. But I need to practice more on learning how to cut the slices super thin. They didn't come out as everyone shared so I still need try different approaches. My boyfriend, however, enjoyed them.

I was surprised that I could make potato chips that tasted like store-bought. But it is a lot of effort and is a bit messy. I did eat them faster than I could fry them.

Awesome recipe! All I have to do is find the right thing to make the right sized slices, other than that it was perfect. Everyone loved them and we can make them however we want!

i made this and i say this is an easy recipe...only it gave me hard time to slice it paper thin, because i used the peeler in slicing them...i suggest maybe we could bake it instead of deep frying it because it is very oily...nevertheless it is a fantastic recipe.  i made this for my husband's birthday party and his visitors all loved it...served this with cheese nut ball.

Yum!  I sliced them a little thick (the thinnest slicer I had, though) and it took *much* longer to fry each batch than I thought it would.  Add salt and vinegar and plan on no leftovers.

OK so I wasn't sure if my husband would like these or not...had them for dinner with hot dogs...he then went back to the bowl for seconds and finished them all off!!! He wants me to make them again for his lunch!

These were really really good. They were great with BLT dip. They probably would have been better if I could have sliced them paper thin.. but still very yummy!

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe! This turned out well! I loved that each family member could sprinkle on their favorite salt as the chips were done. Where else can I get garlic salted potato chips? :) Thanks for the post!
