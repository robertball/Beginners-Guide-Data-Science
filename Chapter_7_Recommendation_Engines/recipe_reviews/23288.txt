This was a beautiful cake.  The presentation looked quite professional. The mint flavor was not very strong however.  I may add more mint next time.  Still very yummy though.  It reminded me of a Suzy-Q.  Also with the whipped cream it needs to be stored in the fridge.  Will make again!!

this cake is delicious.  the mint flavor is subtle and not overpowering.  also, you can subtitute other extracts for the mint.  next time i think i'll try it with orange.

This is some of the best cake I've ever made! I can't even put it in words as to how delicious it was. I made it for my brother's 22nd Birthday and there was not a crumb to spare. I followed the recipe except for subtracting 1/2 cup of sugar (I figured it would be rich enough and wouldn't need to be overly sweet) and added about 1/4 cup of mayo to give the cake extra moisture.

I just used a boxed chocolate cake to save time and so It only really made 3 good layers, but for the first time of me making a layered cake, it turned out great.

Overall very easy to make, just time consuming waiting for things to cool in between steps (took about 4 hours start to finish for me).  Next time I would bake the cake pans the day before and then whip the cream/assemble/refrigerate it the day of.  I added a drop of green food coloring to the whipped cream to give it a slight tint, and crushed pistachios to the garnish for additional "green" color and crunch.  Everyone liked it, but I thought the cake layers were a bit dry, and the glaze turned out a bit thick for me (didn't drip over the sides as much as I expected).  Also, I might try using peppermint extract, since the regular mint extract added a spearmint flavor to the whipped cream and kept making me think of toothpaste!  It was enough mint flavoring for me but my husband would have liked even more.

this cake was not what i expected at all.... it just looks so cool. kinda like a bunch of oreos stacked up. i dyed the filling a light green and it looked awesome and professional. im definately gonna make it again sometime, and next time i think ill use more mint.
