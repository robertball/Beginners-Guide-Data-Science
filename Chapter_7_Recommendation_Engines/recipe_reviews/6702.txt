I too added extra cinnamon and added some cloves and nutmeg.  I like to cook everything with olive oil and I didn't have any problems with consistency.  If you want to add a special touch (both for the eyes and the tongue), blend 6oz of cream cheese with 1/4 to 1/2 c. white sugar (depending on how sweet you have made the bread and how sweet you want the cream cheese to be) and 1 egg or 1/4 cup of egg substitute.  Put 1/3 of the batter in the pan, then 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture, 1/3 of the batter, the rest of the cream cheese mixture, and the rest of the batter.  You can take a butter knife and run it through a few times if you want a swirl.  I made muffins and reduced the cook time to about 35-40 minutes.

This is a quick and easy bread.  It makes a nice, sweet, slightly crispy crust.  I used regular canola oil since I didn't have sunflower oil.  It makes it a little heavier but it is still very good.  I also made a maple cream cheese spread to go on the top.  I will make this again.

I've baked this a bunch of times, and it always makes a delicious loaf of carrot bread--really good with whipped cream cheese. Since I like spice cake, I add a bit more cinammon and a little ground ginger. To make it a low-carb treat, I substituted 3/4 cup of Atkins Bake Mix for 1 cup of the flour, reduced the oil by 1 tablespoon, and used Splenda instead of white sugar--the results were excellent! This one's a keeper.

I liked this.  I used a bit more carrots, more cinnamon, a dash of ginger and ground cloves, and left out the nuts.  Keeps well in the frig, and tastes better as it ages.  Thanks.

I substantially changed the ingredients, in an effort to make this bread healthier.  The result was excellent!  My BF (who usually rates most recipes 'pretty good') said it was excellent and a definite 5 out of 5.  Not bad for someone who hates vegetables!  Here is what I did: 1/2 cup splenda 6 tablespoons brown sugar 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce 1 cup all purpose flour 1 cup whole wheat flour 2 tsp baking powder 1 tsp baking soda 2 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp nutmeg 2 eggs 2 pinches salt 2 cups shredded carrots (big shreds) 1/4 chopped nuts 1/4 raisins 1tsp vanilla. I baked it in one loaf pan at 350 for 53 min. This version ended up being only 160 calories and 2.6 grams of fat per serving

A very "light" bread.  I used raisins instead of nuts.  I will definitely use nuts next time--it would probably be good with both!  Good bread!

This recipe was both easy and good! I put a light cream cheese glaze on mine. Next time I'll use more carrots.

Delicious! A perfect bread for a cool, autumn day! Instead of shredded carrots, I boiled and pureed fresh carrots. This bread was super moist, so I think that took care of the dryness that some people had mentioned in their reviews. I added a touch extra cinnamon, and didn't add the nuts to this (family preference). Thanks for the post!

this recipe is wonderful.  Perfect for my 10 month old son, as long as I leave out the nuts.  The flavor is nice, added a little nutmeg to mine, but it would tasty without.  A keeper!

This is an awesome bread! Not too sweet, just right! I used double the recommended grated carrot because I had a lot of carrots to use up and it was perfect. Lowered the fat content by only using half, and applesauce for the remainder. Family ate half the loaf just trying it out. A real keeper!

I altered this so much, it hardly resembles the original, but it is great!! Here's my alterations: 1 c all purpose flour, 1 c wheat flour, 1 c applesauce,1 1/2 c finely shredded carrots, 2 tsp cinnomon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves, 2 egg whites,1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown sugars. Follow the same mixing and baking directions. So moist and yummy!(and healthier!)

I was worried that I had done something wrong because after mixing all the ingredients, it was not pourable. It made a very dense mass that I had to spoon into the bread pan. It baked just fine though. I thought this was a little too sweet so next time I will cut the sugar down. Don't get me wrong, it's delicious, but I was looking for a healthier carrot bread. This tasted more cake-like with the amount of sugar called for in the recipe. I increased the carrots to 2 cups. Overall, very good.

This braed is good, however I followed it exact and but it was a cookie dough consistency..so obviously there is a missing ingredient.  I looked up other carrot breads and saw a 1/2 cup of milk used, I did that and it came out great

I thought this had a very "floury" taste - and rather bland. I did like the texture of the crust - a bit of a crunch. I did not have sunflower oil and used canola - don't think that made much of a difference to the flavor. I'd add more cinnamon, maybe some nutmeg, maybe another egg - although, I don't plan on making this one again.

I've had an abundance of carrots lately so I've tried quite a few different carrot bread recipes in the past week.  This is the first one I loved.  This is the kind of quick bread I love - dense and moist.  I did add about 1/2 cup sour cream and I didn't have any nuts.  Those were the only changes I made.
This is definitely a keeper for me.

Overall a yummy treat, but I had one problem with it. When I mixed everything together, the "batter" was so thick that it was more like dough. A half cup of milk fixed that problem. I also used whole wheat flour, left out the nuts and added 1 tsp each of nutmeg and ground cloves. I like my carrot bread with some spice. =)

After reading all the reviews, I reduced the flour to 1 and a 1/2 cup, increased the carrots to 1 and 1/2 cups. Also, I realized that the batter was a tad dry, so I added 1 tbsp and 1 tsp of milk to moisten it. I baked it around 30 mins, and it was baked just right!

Great! I will definitely be making these again. In an effort to make them healthier, I substituted Splenda for the sugar (left the brown sugar the same...) and unsweetened applesauce for the oil. These turned out moist and delicious. I have to hide the pan from my 17 month old because she could eat 3 in one setting!

This recipe was wonderful and a great hit with my co-workers! I had recently bought a juice extractor and had all this carrot pulp from making carrot juice...So I modified the recipe a little: rather than using shredded carrots, I used an equivalent amount of carrot pulp plus 1/4 c. water or milk for each cup of carrot pulp, I used canola oil rather than sunflower seed oil and I halved the oil, replacing half with unsweetened applesauce. I also doubled the cinnamon and added about a tsp. each of nutmeg and allspice plus a quarter tsp. cloves. Lastly, I added 1/2 c. raisins....delicious recipe!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe for two loaves, doubled the cinnamon, left out the pecans(just because I didn't have any on hand), and used regular vegetable oil (again because that is what I had). I really like this recipe, simple and quick with great results. I will definitely make this again.

as a healthy eater, i made several changes and this turned out really great =) I used only 1/2 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup applesauce instead of oil, only 1.5 cups of flour, 2 tsp of cinnamon, 2 egg whites, and 3/4 tsp vanilla extract. for the carrots, I used 2 cups, but I chopped them and boiled them for about 10 minutes, then made CARROT PUREE in a blender (with about 1/4 cup of water or more). needless to say, it turned out great! i sprinkled some extra white sugar on top and served it to my family; it was gone pretty quickly!

Me and my famil loved this. I did make a few changes based on others suggestions. I add more cinnamon and touch of ginger. I also added yellow raisins. Otherwise I followed everything.   I had trouble with the cook time. It got really crisp on the outside when the inside wasnt finished yet. I think i overcooked it a bit but it was still yummy with a little butter on each slice:)

The taste was excellent, but the texture was too dry. Next time I may add an extra egg or a 1/4 cup more oil.

This bread was nice and light and easy to make. I followed the recipe except doubling the carrots and the family, kids and all, loved it. My baking time was only 40 minutes for a loaf though and 18 minutes for mini-muffins.

Yummm!  What a wonderful recipe, I finely shredded the carrots in the food processor and used a bit more than a cup, still couldn't taste them that much, may use more next time. I also used more cinnamon and some fresh nutmeg. Also I wanted to make it even more moist, so I added about 1/4c of crème fraîche (sour cream would work just fine) and it turned out sooo moist and delicious!!  (didn't have nuts, will use them next time) thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

This is a great recipe! Just took them out of the oven and had them for breakfast. The batter was very thick, but I refrained from adding milk and I'm glad I did. I put them in a 12-muffin tin for just under 30 mins at the suggested temp. Didn't have sunflower seed oil, so I used canola oil. Also, I ran out of white sugar - used just under 1/2 cup of that, then close to 3/4 cup brown sugar. I think I'll stick to those measurements next time because the muffins really are SO good. Also added a dash of ginger, chinese 5-spice and nutmeg. Didn't have any pecans, but used between 1.5 - 2 cups grated carrots. The only thing I would consider changing for next time is possibly adding even more carrots. Thanks so much for such a delicious muffin recipe!

Yum! A real winner! 
Love the crunchy crust.
I also substituted canola oil, didn't have sunflower seed oil but bet that would make this 5.5 stars out of 5!

I LOVE this bread! My family, even my kids, really enjoy this as a breakfast bread or snack. Great way to use excess carrots too.

I have to be honest when I mixed everything together it didn't look right but once baked it was fantastic sweet crispy on the outside and just enough cinnamon. So yummy! Love it

This is very tasty. I made it healthier by adding raisins (soaked in a little plain water to plump back up); reduced flour to 1 1/2 cups, and 1/2 cup of that was a wheat germ/milled flaxseed combo; & used 1/4 c. canola oil and 1/2 c. applesauce for the oil. I also think the method for putting this bread together can be improved; I sifted my dry ingredients together first, and added my eggs to the wet ingredients before adding dry ones in (saves a bowl, and it's just plain right to sift your dry ingredients to avoid clumps of baking powder etc.) I do not, however, taste any cinnamon. In fact the dominant taste here is the juicy raisins, which are great, but were not in the original recipe. So minus half a star for the method being kind of silly, and minus another half for just not enough flavor without making changes of your own. It deserves all 4 stars for holding up to the "healthy changes" though. I'd probably double the cinnamon if I tried again :)

This recipe is good but needs a little tweaking. It had a noticeable baking soda taste, so I will try halving that next time. It seems to have enough baking agents. Otherwise this makes a tasty loaf.

Very good, very moist, I only used 1 1/2 cups of flour like others had suggested and mine came out very moist.  Next time I will cut down the sugar, a little too sweet for my taste and then I will add nutmeg and I think this will be a perfect recipe!

what makes this a carrot "bread" instead of a carrot "cake" is that this has a little less sugar and twice the amount of flour than cake (making this more dense and less sweet.) 2 cups of flour still seems like too much flour. I cut it to 1 1/2 cups and thats perfect (doesnt make the bread sooo dense.) other than that, this is a good recipe. serve slices with butter if you want a "bread" , serve w/ cream cheese frosting if you are wanting a "cake!"

I replaced the sunflower seed oil with 1/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and added 2 T. skim milk and 1/2 t. nutmeg. In the end my husband and I thought that it tasted like carrot cake that was a little too sweet. Next time I will cut out 1/4 cup of sugar as well.

Delightful!  I was a little concerned about the consistency of it, but it was still delicious.  I added quite a big of cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, and only put in 1/2 cup white sugar.  Oh, also, it didn't make as big of a loaf as I had expected.

I tried this recipe to use up my extra carrots. Tastes great and forms a wonderful crust. I would have put walnuts in it or on top of it as well. I didnt end up using any nuts and used vegetable oil instead. It could have also used some more spices like carrot cake. Might taste good with butter or a spread of some sort.

The dough for this bread came out way to thick and was bland.  I added an additional teaspoon of cinnamon, plus a teaspoon each of nutmeg and ginger.  I also added 1/4-1/3 of milk to bring the batter to a traditional consistency for a quick bread.  It baked up well and made a good carrot loaf with those changes.

This recipe is easy, but I doubled the recipe, added 1 cup of evaporated milk, added raisins, left out the nuts, and used 3 loaf pans and they are perfect and delicious! Big hit with the fam. I think the nice thing about this recipe is it is versatile. You can change it up to suit your ingredients (raisins vs nuts) and it still turns out great. The reason I added the milk is b/c I live in the desert, and things tend to dry out easily here, so I always add milk to my quick bread recipes.

very quick and easy to make.  I added raisins instead of nuts, added more cinnamon and added nutmeg and ginger as others had recommended. Also cut back on the amount of sugar. Taste was pleasing. two loaves disappeared with in the day so would have to say the family loved it too.

I made this and actually loved it, I gave it 3 stars because of all the changes I made.  I substituted 3/4 of the oil for unsweetened applesauce, used whole white flour, added raisins and added nutmeg and allspice.  I think next time I will leave out the allspice and add more cinnamon and nutmeg.  I'm eating some now, I love it!!!

Despite this being the first time making the recipe, I took the liberty of making my alterations (changing the amount of sugar to 1/2 c. each, using whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, using walnuts instead of pecans, adding 1/2 c. of raisins) and it turned out great :) When I just had the dry ingredients with the sugar and oil, it got really dry but the eggs and carrots add a LOT of moisture.  I also added a bit of nutmeg, but I think I added too much... might try 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and ginger next time...

I really like this bread, even though I modified it to make it healthier. First, I used oat flour. I cut the sugar to 1/2 c. I used blended tofu and a little canola oil instead of all that sunflower oil. The bread turned out moist, and I could taste the carrots.

I was HIGHLY suspicious of the batter/dough that I ended up with, but the bread turned out a really wonderful texture and the flavor is also quite good. Very subtle spice flavor. Though I don't notice the carrot at all. if you want a strong carrot flavor, definitely add much more.
I used vegetable oil instead of sunflower seeds oil, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I highly recommend giving it a try!

I'm not sure why, but mine came out very raw in the middle after an hour even in dark pans. Could use 1 hour 15 to 1.5 hours. Kids loved it though. Mixed in some white chocolate chips for New Years Day.

This is an old recipe from when we got the TV guide in the mail and they had a stars recipe each week.  This was Jill St Johns.  I lost it and am so happy to see it here!  My bread was super moist and the only thing I did different was toasting the pecans which wouldn't change the moisture of it.  I also have a new electric oven so I would say to the people who had a dryer bread it is because ur oven may be baking too hot.  I have had it where it wasn't as moist and I have to tell u I prefer it that way!  lol. I may bake my next one longer because u also get a crispier brown sugary crust all around if u overbake it.  This one here was as moist as a cake and I don't think it was meant to be that way.  It was however very good and I do believe using the sunflower oil does make a difference.  I doubled the recipe and am going to freeze it and give it to my sister.  She loves this kind of thing.  Next bake will be at 375 instead of 350!  Oh I did add 1/2 teaspoon more of cinnamon because I like it!

Never thought of doing carrot cake as a loaf cake before! This cake/bread came out moist with a nice crispy crust, which I LOVE. The only changes I made was using all brown sugar, adding extra spices, and adding an extra cup of carrots. It turned out dense, but light (if that makes sense). Next time, I will try it with a cream cheese frosting :)

I don’t understand why this is called a batter when the consistency was far more like cookie dough. I was perplexed by the texture after mixing all the ingredients as prescribed, but after adding 1 cup milk! and baking as directed, it came out great.

Substituted vegetable oil (no sunflower seed oil in our little town), and walnuts for pecans.  Made it in mini loaf pans, and put two pans in the oven at a time, 30 minutes. Noticed that after the last two mini loaves cooled, the parchment paper slings had an oily shadow. I don't know if that was because they were waiting longer to go in the oven or because they were from the bottom of the bowl.

Well this is a wonderful recipe, but I must confess I made several changes and additions just for fun and because I am on a low-carb diet as well. I used Swerve Brown and white sugars, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 cup canola oil, nearly 3 cups of carrots ground fine and 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut-also ground fine. It made  big beautiful loaf and I iced with Cream Cheese Frosting using Swerve Confectioners Sugar. What a treat!!! The pecans made it extra special. Could easily be a Holiday Dessert!

I left out the pecans and added an extra half cup of carrots instead, since pecans are definitely not something we usually keep in the house and if I put them in, easily half my family would not want to eat it, and put in a little more cinnamon, as well as swapped the sunflower oil for canola oil (I am not even sure where I would find sunflower oil), and it turned out perfect. Everyone in my family loved it (save the seven year old who notoriously dislikes baked goods of any kind) and said that we should add the recipe to our list of family favourites to make more often. Would definitely make this again.

I viewed EKRUDERT's suggestion for the cream cheese layer inside, and it AMAZING!  It's essentially a cheesecake layer inside the bread.  I added 1/4 cup sugar to the cream cheese instead of a 1/2 cup, and it was perfect, but more would be too sweet.  I added 1/4 cup more sugar to the bread, and it made it perfect.  Before, it was not sweet enough, and this made it perfect.  Got many requests to make it again.

The basic recipe is a very good base for a tasty carrot bread. I read several reviews before making it the first time, and I used many of the modifications suggested. I doubled the carrots and added more cinnamon. The second time I made it, I  added 1/2 of a can of drained, crushed pineapple, which makes this bread taste more like a carrot cake. It's delicious! I've been using this recipe for 4 years now. Thank you for sharing it!

I have problems adjusting recipes to high altitudes (like 5000' here in Reno). This one was good when I added 1/4 cup more flour and baked it at 365 F for 40 minutes.

After reading a lot of reviews this is what I did- I used half the oil and used apple sauce of the other half; doubled the cinnamon and added a half tsp of cloves and nutmeg; added a chopped apple; plumped 1/2-1 c raisins in hot water and added instead of pecans; used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour.  Lastly I added about 1/2 c of milk to thin the batter. I doubled the recipe and baked 12 muffins and 1 loaf. They were a tab dry but over all good flavour.

Just bake this.  Used more carrots, about 1-1/2 cups, added 1 tsp. ginger, 1/2 tsp. ground cloves, and 3/4 cup Turkish apricots.  Instead of putting into a bread pan I used six mini bundt pans.  Had a little too much batter in each but turned out nicely.

Made this today. Had no nuts, so left those out, had only olive oil so used that in place of sunflower. Did add 1/2 cup milk, (because I made muffins), more carrot, nutmeg & ginger. They had a nice texture, made nice looking muffins, but to me almost resembled a corn muffin in sweetness & seemed more savory. Two of my kids liked it, two didn't, although 1 finally ate some because he got hungry. I think I would make them again, only with something to make them sweeter.

I made this recipe today from carrot pulp left over from my juicer.  It was a huge family hit.  I put an extra egg in because the carrot pulp was a little dry.  I added extra nuts also.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  It will be part of of our baking favorites from now on!

Tasty!  We ate it with maple whipped cream cheese for breakfast.  I think I will add more carrots next time but, otherwise, the recipe doesn't need any change.  It didn't take the whole hour to bake.

Living in the West Indies for Peace Corps, I made a few changes to adapt to the local food availability (and to add a little Caribbean flava):
1/2 c. wheat flour, 1/2 c. white
I c. shredded carrot + pulp from one very ripe mango
1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. granulated
I used soya oil instead 
Added nutmeg, ground clove, and fresh grated ginger, raisins, and toasted sunflower seeds.
This bread turned out surprisingly moist and had a pleasantly not-too-sweet, spiced island flavor.  The mango wasn't noticable -- I'd add a few more next time to see if that made a difference.  
I recommend this recipe, especially if you like to stray from the original to add your own touches.

I made a few modifications including sub-ing applesauce for some of the oil, omitting nuts and using a different oil. I also added some ginger and nutmeg and sprinkled the top with oat bran. I had to cut more than 10min off the suggested bake time and the outside still burnt. It still turned out pretty good. Next time I'd add more carrots.

Just ok, IMO.  Have made much more moist, flavorful breads.  Definitely needs more spice and maybe some raisins.

I used raisins in place of the nuts (due to an allergy). It turned out pretty well. It had a little bit of a charred odor to it even though the center was barely done, but that may be the fault of my oven or pan rather than the recipe.

Very very good! I made one and then had to make two more because the first one disappeared so fast.

The best carrot bread receipe ever and a little more healthy option for family desert.
I substitute plain flour with whole wheat and white sugar with brown - it tastes as well. My husband likes it served with a mango vanilla yoghurt.

The batter texture is weird, dry and very grainy-looking, but the end result is great! We added just a bit of sour cream to the batter because it was so dry but we may not have needed to. Anyway, it was good.

This was very good.  My husband asked me how I got the crust to taste so good.  All I did was follow the directions and bake it!  Very easy and very yummy, I will definitely make this one again.  Thanks

This was a bit dry, but if a spread is used, it's fine.  I used butter instead of oil, doubled the cinnamon and still couldn't taste it; next time I'll add more.  My kids liked it so it's a great way to get them to eat carrots!

I always try to find a recipe that is different than the ordinary recipes that everyone has.  I think I have found one for Carrot Bread!  This is GREAT!!!  It is a little crumbly, but it may be because I used Vegetable oil instead of sunflower oil.  I too added more cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg to the recipe.  Thanks to the founder of the recipe.

I followed the suggestions of the other readers and added more cinnamon, like one of the others I was a little concerned about the consistency, it seemed very dry but it turned out great.... spread some pineapple cream cheese on it or plain its a keeper

This bread was terrific!  I accidently added a little more of both sugers, and I deliberately added more cinnamon as several other reviewers suggested.  My Mom was visiting and took home the recipe.  Wonderful stuff!

This bread turned out very well.  Next time I'll add a little more cinnamon.  The nuts gave it a great texture and the top is just a little crusty which was a nice added touch. A yummy way to use extra carrots from your garden.
