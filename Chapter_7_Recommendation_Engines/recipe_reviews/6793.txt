Very good.  I was skeptical, even after having read all of the great reviews but they truly are very good.  The bread is moist and tender, not hard and with using the bread maker, this is a pretty easy recipe to make.  It takes time due to the required rising but other than that, it's quick and easy.  I did do a couple of things differently -- I added more cinnamon, 1 tsp was not nearly enough; I omitted the powdered milk; and I used cream instead of ice cream.  Next time I'll add nuts and they'll be perfect.  I'm glad I didn't heed the advice to double the caramel, they were quite sweet and quite gooey with the recipe as it was.  Try 'em, you won't be disappointed.

These are absolutly the best cinnamon rolls!  I have made them for everyone this holiday season and all have loved them.  The only thing I did different after the first batch was divide my dough in half and bake in 2 8x8 pans.  The center rolls wouldn't shrink then, and they looked gorgeous :)  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Happy thanksgiving to all. I am glad that this recipe has been enjoyed by so many. Someone said they weren't sure of the size triangle to make.  I think 12 X 17 is about right.  When I cut the rolls into 12 to put in the pan they are about 1½". What I do is, cut the long roll in half and then each half into six.  They come out pretty uniform. Thanks for all the good comments about this recipe.  It is indeed a "keeper".  Kathy Nowell

YUM! YUM! These are Soooo good and I can't wait to make them again! I doubled the caramel part and added pecans to the caramel recipe. I read a couple reviews saying it was dry. Mine was not at all dry. When taking from the oven, turn upside down on a platter and all the caramel will be on "top".  I also frosted with cream cheese frosting. 1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/4 cup butter, softened, 1 cup confectioners sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 1/2 teaspoons milk. These were WONDERFUL! Thank You soooo much Kathy!

I have tried at least 25 different recipes for cinnamon rolls to find ones that were moist, soft and gooey.  This is the only one that I've been wild about.  I make them for our clinic about 2x monthly and they're gone by 9AM.  I'm careful not to add much or any extra flour and work with the extra-soft dough as it keeps them "melt-in-your-mouth" textured.  I mix mine in my Kitchen Aid while making the caramel sauce (which I only cook for about 1 minute or less so it's not so stiff after baking.  We like them oozing the caramel.  After cooking the sauce for 2 minutes, we found it to be too caramelzed after baking and we had trouble getting it unstuck from our teeth.  I never make less than a double batch.  It's the first thing family, friends and associates ask for when I say, "What can I bring?"

These cinnamon rolls are a hit anywhere I take them.. work, family gatherings, etc... they are awesome!  I like to make them the night before, let them rise while I'm sleeping and pop them in the oven for fresh out-of-the-oven cinnamon rolls in the morning.

Simply, hands-down the absolute BEST cinnamon roll recipe EVER!  Even better than the clone of a cinnabon recipe that's so highly regarded.  I've tried both, and NOTHING compares to this recipe.  I do tweak the recipe a bit, though.....I bake the buns in a pan with the caramel sauce on the bottom, and when done baking, I then flip the pan over into a slightly larger pan.  That way, the gooey caramel oozes into all the cracks of the buns.  I also put a cream cheese frosting over the whole shebang (the one from the clone of a cinnabon recipe).  I always get rave reviews when I make this!

Oh.My.Gosh. Just Wow. This is the BEST cinnamon roll recipe I ever made, or eaten for that matter!  I was just about to give up hope because I wanted big fluffy, yummy, gooey cinnamon rolls and just couldn't find a recipe that gave me anything other than little cinnamon hockey pucks.  I would recommend this a 1000x over. (I didn't have vanilla ice cream so had to substitute 1/2 cup whipping cream & 3 Tablespoons gran suger. Also, used 1/4 oz [1.5 tsp] packet of quick rise yeast.)

Great recipe, Kathy! The only change I made was to add 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the vanilla ice cream mixture since my family loves liberal amounts of cinnamon. Served them at my Mother's Day brunch. Everyone loved them and no one guessed the secret ingredient in the caramel!

This is a great "sticky bun" recipe.  We wanted a caramel roll so I didn't frost these and they were fabulous.  I didn't have any instant yeast so I used 2tsp regular yeast, and they were perfect. I also put them in the fridge overnight and baked in the morning as others suggested.  YUM YUM YUM!

This recipe was awful.  The dough was way to stick to handle.  Most of it stuck when I tried to roll it out.  I ended up throwing it out and finding another recipe.  If your looking for a good cinamon roll recipe- keep looking.  This isn't it.

These are by far THE BEST cinnamon rolls!
I was really hesitant to try these just because of the ice cream that was listed in the sauce ingredients.  I’m sure glad I got over that!
Because of a major winter storm that is brewing, I wanted to bring nice warm cinnamon rolls into work today.  So what I did was last night, after rolling them out, cutting them, and placing them in the goo, they went in the refrigerator overnight.  This morning, I took them out let them set for 1/2 an hour then put them in the oven while it was heating up.  They turned out GREAT! They went so fast that not everyone in the department got one and the pan was still warm!  Five stars just isn’t enough for this one.  THANKS for sharing this recipe.

These were lovely and soft.  I made a simple butter, light brown sugar and cinnamon filling and did not make the sauce.  Also, I added a powdered sugar and butter frosting.  I took some to work three weeks ago and they were gone in an hour.  We are having a bake sale next week and I have had SEVEN requests so far for them.  They are a hit! Yummmm!!

Absolutely unbelieveable. I still can't believe that I can make something that tastes this good in my kitchen!  I do not have a bread machine or mixer so I made them by hand. In order to do this I used 2tsp active dry yeast which I proofed in a glass with 1 tbsp of sugar and the 1 cup of warm water until a nice foamy head had developed on the water (about 10mins). In the meantime, I mixed the dry ingredients in a large bowl and made a well in the center. Once the yeast was developed I poured it into the well and also added the softened butter and the egg. I then stirred the wet ingredients in the well letting the dry fall and mix in slowly. This makes quite a moist dough. I let it rest for about 10mins while I made the caramel and then I started vigorously mixing/kneading the dough with a large plastic spatula.   It was at this point that I realised the magic of using powdered milk. The protein in the milk really activates the gluten in the flour and as I continued to mix the dough it began to bind together really nicely into a onderful smooth and manageable elastic dough. My tip to those making this recipe by hand, follow the amount of ingredients exactly (do not be tempted to add any more flour!) and just let all the chemical bonding do its magic. The dough was incredibly easy to roll out and not sticky just wonderfully elastic which makes these rolls light and cakelike and incredible.  Thank you Kathy!!  p.s. I did not even ice these. They are perfect.

This is definitely one of the best cinnamon roll recipes I have ever made or eaten.  The rolls were easy to prepare (I did add 3/4 cup of flour extra) and the dough was perfect.  They came out very gooey and extra sweet.  My actual prep time was very little, maybe 15-20 minutes, and they were perfect!

This was my first time ever making cinnamon rolls. I was a little worried about how my husband would like them, since they are not traditional cinnamon rolls, but he LOVED these! He's even asking me to make up a batch for his coworkers tomorrow. :) The dough was a little too soft, but I may have made a mistake, since I have no machine and had to do these by hand. I can't wait to make up my own small variations on this recipe!

This is one of the only things my brother would have an appetite for when he was terminally ill 8 years ago. I've probably made this 50 times and it never disappoints! Only thing I would recommend is to double the goo (mmmmm) and use vanilla bean icecream only. (I prefer turkey hill natural or breyers vanilla bean). It definitely makes a difference. I'm making this for Christmas breakfast as it has been requested by all the kids. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Thanks Kathy, you have just given me a SUPERB reputation as a baker with this awesome recipe. My first attempt using a diffent recipe flopped, so I was quite hesitant to try it out..but glad I did! I used my new bread machine and regarding the question of adding flour, yes, I had to add maybe 1/2c more. The trick is really to watch your bread machine during the first 5 minutes of the kneading cycle and see if the dough forms a ball or not...mine started out really soggy, so I kept adding 1 Tbsp of flour at a time till the dough became one solid ball. Slightly sticky is fine...since too much flour makes the bread too heavy. I also added chopped almonds and made 16 rolls instead of 12 --just a nice size to feed my troupe of 2 & 4 year olds!!! I also served it in my Bible study group with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on the side..and they all raved on how "sinful" but yummy it was. I even convinced 2 of my friends and my mom-in-law to buy their own bread machines because of this recipe! Thanks again!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!
That being said, these are more of a caramel roll, and a little less of a traditional cinnamon roll. I would recommend the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe if you want a traditional cinnamon roll.
Also, I used regular milk instead of the powdered milk and they came out great. However, I needed to add quite a bit more flour to make the dough workable. I think even without the addition of regular milk, it may have needed more flour .
The Dough is hard to roll. I recommend following the instructions and simply patting into a rectangle. This way the dough will stay soft also. I patted into approx. 12 by 6 rectangle, which made 12 rolls.
I think doubling the caramel sauce would also be good. And, I cooked the sauce only 1 minute as another suggested, which was a good idea. It kept the sauce softer. Don't know that I would ice these, although I did consider it. Next time I think the double caramel sauce will suffice in keeping this a traditional caramel roll.
I used a little more than 1 tsp of yeast. I don't know why all cinnamon roll recipes say that the dough will rise in 30 minutes. Mine never ever do. It usually takes 2 hours.  However, I recommend BEING PATIENT.  The last 2 times I made Clone of Cinnabon, I got impatient and tried sticking the dough in a low heat oven, and it ruined the dough.

This recipe is delicious!!  I must confess I tried it last weekend and I found it horribly sticky and the dough didn't rise. It was a flop.  I figured it was me and my ingredients which included dated yeast.  Determined to get the results I had read about I went shopping, bought new bread dough and instant fresh yeast and presto!  The dough was great, and the buns rose as I expected.  This is an easy and yummy recipe.  For those of you trying for the first time just make sure your ingredients are fresh!!

I loved this recipe! It was so easy to make and the rolls were delicious! This recipe is a keeper! The only thing I'll do differently next time is double the caramel recipe and put half at the bottom of the pan like the recipe says and put the other half on top of the cinnamon rolls after they're baked (probably right when you serve them). It'll make them more moist.

Oh my, my, my!  You'll never try another cinnamon roll recipe after this one!  To be fair, this really is a caramel roll, but who cares?  It's divine!  I ended up cutting them into 12 rolls and putting them in two 9 x 9 pans overnight.  I pulled one of the pans out the next morning and let it rise 45 minutes.  I saved the other pan for the following morning and they were JUST as good!  My husband likes pecans on them so we added chopped pecans to the top after they came out of the oven, and I inverted them.  I can't wait to make them again....soooooooo good!

This recipe is a keeper! I've made it several times and it turns out perfectly every time! My family prefers the rolls without the caramel sauce so I make them plain and then glaze them right out of the oven with an icing sugar and milk mixture. Just wonderful!

Great recipe! I've made them several times and each has been a hit. We like more "icing," so I have doubled the caramel recipe and even experimented with other ice cream flavors, and all were a success. I have cut down the butter used in the filling a bit, with no loss in taste or "mouth feel." To avoid dry "tops," dip the top in the caramel and then reverse them when you place them in the pan. Another hint: make two "logs" instead of one, slice about an inch thick and bake in mini-sized muffin cups, or in a regular baking pan. And you can make them the night before and pop in the oven in the morning. This is a very easy, very satisfying, and very flexible recipe. Thank you Kathy!

Way too good.  My husband followed his nose into the kitchen, then he and our 3-yr old proceeded to polish off two rolls each before I knew the pan was out of the oven.  yummmmmmmmmm

Everyone loves these rolls!  The ice cream makes this recipe unique as well as tasty.  My only recommendation is to double the amount of topping!

These are great. To prevent the roll from seperating, I skip the softened butter and substitue milk before dprinkling the cinnamon on top the unbaked dough.

Very good, and so easy, especially if you use the bread machine.  We were at the mall yesterday and bf wanted cinnamon rolls after smelling the cinnamon rolls from CinnaBon.  I agreed to see if I could find a recipe for "gooey, soft cinnamon rolls".  Bf approved them, and they are definitely gooey and soft!  I baked in two different pans, and I think that helped with getting the middle ones done at the same time--something I've always had trouble with.  I almost didn't make the caramel bc I didn't have vanilla ice cream, but bf sacrificed the ice cream part of two ice cream sandwiches for the cause.  :o)  It worked just fine, and the caramel sauce is easy but so worth it.  All in all, these are excellent cinnamon rolls that are worth the time and effort--not that there is much effort, but the time spent waiting is worth it too! I, too, flipped the rolls out onto a plate and they are great that way.  I don't think they need anything else at all.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe.  What a great idea of using the bread machine.  I made these t-nite and they were wonderful.  I did omit the powdered milk and added 1-2 tablespoons of regular low-fat milk.  I also omitted the caramel on the bottom of the pan.

Very good. My first attempt at cinnamon rolls and I was pleased. Didn't change anything but did make them the night before stuck them in the fridge and baked them the next morning, they stayed nice and moist. I just have to learn to cut and roll them more uniformly. They weren't the prettiest but they smelled and tasted great. Thanks for the recipe.

I added Raisins and subbed 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat.  Because of the whole wheat flour I also added a little more yeast and let them rise a bit longer than recommended.  Didn't measure too closely with the fillings though and wow, they were yummy!!  I was worried they'd be heavy with the whole wheat flour but not at all.

This is a good recipe and very yummy! Although, I did not have milk powder so instead i used regular 2% milk. I used 3/4 cup warm water and 2 1/2 tablespoons 2% milk. I let the dough rise longer and the dough was great! I also had no ice cream, so i melted some butter in the microwave and added some brown sugar, white sugar and cinnamon until it was consistency of the caramel they use in this recipe.  They turned out great!

these are heaven.  My family made these after reading a Tinker Bell Fairy book.  In the book, they make cinnamon rolls.  These turned out better than I could have expected.  The only thing I did different, was we made them the night before and then placed the pan in the fridge. In the morning, I took the pan out of the fridge and let it sit to rise for about 1 hours.  Then into the oven they went.  HEAVEN for sure.

This is the best cinnamon roll recipe ever.  Every time I make them for a function I get many requests for the recipe.  I do not own a bread machine.  Instead, I use one packet of regular yeast and mix in one cup of warm water.  I then throw everything into a Kitchen Aid mixture for about eight minutes, let the dough rise, and follow the recipe from there.  I absolutely love this recipe - they are beyond compare!!!

Better than the family recipe I've been making for 30 years!  I should have paid attention to the bread machine to add more flour while it was mixing.  Ended up having to knead flour into a very sticky dough so I could roll it out.  Added pecans to the caramel sauce and had to cover with foil and bake a little longer to get the bottoms done.  Excellent flavor!

The recipe for carmel is superior!  I doubled in and used it in combination with the "Best ever cinnamon buns" recipe which I used for the dough.  Now that combination is truelly the best ever! Thank you Kathy!  Who'd have thought of vanilla ice cream?

Oh my gosh, I could not stop eating these!!!!!!! They are soooooo good and pretty easy to make. I did half bread flour, half whole wheat to make it a tiny bit healthier, and they were still delicious!!!!!!!

I had never made cinnamon rolls before trying this recipe.  It's absolutely incredible even without the topping.  There's no need to look further, this is hands down, the best recipe! The only changes I made were to let the yeast rise in the warm water with a teaspoon of sugar before putting it all into the bread machine and I added a couple tablespoons of Gluten flour to the white flour.

I LOVE the caramel in this recipe!! I could eat it all day. It's amazing! I didn't have ice cream so I used heavy whipping cream instead.

Works well. I used a different icing so I can't rate that, but the dough was very nice.

I never made cinnamon rolls before trying this recipe.  I've made these a few times now and they come out perfect every single time.  The dough is very easy to handle right out of the bread machine and can be refrigerated overnight for a shortcut in the morning.  When you use white bread flour, these come out very light and fluffy and uber delicious.  With white wheat regular flour they are not as light and fluffy but still very delicious and, of course, healthier.  We like them best fresh out of the oven with cream cheese icing.  Sometimes we flavor our icing orange with orange peel and natural orange flavoring.  I bake these in a 9x13 casserole dish and they are always gone in a flash!

One of my favorite Cinnamon Roll Recipe.  
It is easy to make, and it doesn't require a whole lot of baking skills.

Best cinnamon rolls ever!! The only thing is that I needed to use more flour, maybe because i used normal flour...and the dough was sticky. But they came out perfectly!! I Will do them again sometime :)

Yummy! These are delicious! I omitted the powdered milk, doubled up the caramel sauce, and flipped the cinnamon buns onto a plate after baking so the caramel drizzled through. Next time I would add more cinnamon and brown sugar to the dough. My family loved them!!! Thank you

Have a Bread machine or not, this is hands down the best, best, best cinnamon roll recipe out there. These are every bit as good as bakery rolls (if not better). I'm admittedly, a recipe tweeker, so here's what I tweeked. instead of the dry milk, I used 1/4 c buttermilk Used a full packet of active dry yeast, its a bit more than called for I used leftover whipped topping instead of the icecream and added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to pan syrup  and I upped the amount of cinnamon for filling to 2 T cause i like alot of cinnamon I frosted mine, with a mixture of 2cups powdered sugar, 3 T marg, 3 T cream cheese, and 2T pecan pancake syrup (chocolate milk syrup would work too)   oh man u cant go wrong even if u tweek like me.  these rolls are high, and light and have just the most Perfect texture. Thanks so much for a great recipe

I have made this recipe and "Moist Cinnamon Rolls" from this site. I like the dough part on Moist Cinnamon Rolls better but love this caramel version. Instead of ice cream I use 1/2 C. heavy cream and I double the recipe also adding pecans. It is great. Sorry, this dough version just isn't to my liking.

Perfect recipe!  Simply out of this world!!  Didn't really know how large of a triangle to pat the dough out into, but I guessed at it.  One question though, the recipe called for a teaspoon of yeast; however, with 3 cups of bread flour, that would normally "signal" a whole package of dry active yeast.  I used a whole packet of yeast and it was just fine.  I can't wait to prepare this recipe for my family.  I agree with other users that this recipe should be named "Caramel Rolls".  I also added the pecans as one reviewer suggested. I will use this recipe again and again and again and again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you so VERY MUCH Ms. Nowell!!

In a word, AMAZING! I have made this a few times now, the first two times I botched it completely, this time only a little.   As always, they came out great!   This recipe is so adaptable, I have found myself without a lot of the ingredients but was still able to pull it off.  I have used vanilla flavored dried coffee creamer(Coffee Mate) instead of the dried milk and heavy cream instead of the ice cream.  I also don't own a Bread Machine, but use my KitchenAid mixer instead.  I just use the dough hook and let it go for about 15 mins or so, then let it rest for about 10 before I roll out the dough. Always perfect, just like the ones you get in the mall!  MY pickiest eater, a 3 year old devoured them! And he never eats!

This recipe was real easy using bread machine.   I made it a second time using orange peel and sugar for filling, omitted topping and frosted with orange frosting. Great when slightly warm. Thanks for this easy one.

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten. Cooking them in the caramel glaze makes them so chewy and sweet. The won't last long around your house.

My mother-in-law has made these for years! She used heavy whipping cream instead of ice cream but I like the ice cream best, plus I don't always have heavy whipping cream on hand!   They were not as caramely as hers so will double the recipe for the topping from now on!  These are always a hit and don't normally last more than a day!Only gave 4 star rating because of not having enough caramel!

Terrific. Just remember to flip them upside down onto your serving platter. I agree with the adjustments that include a bit of frost or glaze as is pictured. These were very moist and tasty. Yum! Enough to distract my Weight Watcher relatives into a bit of indulgence and say "it was worth it!"

This is my favorite cinnamon roll recipe ever.  I have been making it for years and everyone always love them.  I wouldn't measure the filling - just cover with butter, crumble brown sugar and cinnamon.
If I don't have ice cream I substitute heavy cream

These are the best cinnamon rolls......better than my mom's and that's saying something.  My only problem was the amount of flour was way off.......needed about 1 1/2 cups more than was listed.  Plus who preheats an oven for almost an hour before baking?  I modified things a bit, like the flour but other than that this is an awesome recipe........a bit time consuming but if something is good the wait is worth it.

This is fabulous!  My 12 year old son said "this is one of the most beautiful things I have ever put in my mouth!"  I didn't have any ice cream so I used some heavy cream that I had left over from another recipe so I used that instead.  Other than that it was all according to the recipe.  I did immediately turn the pan upside down and emptied it onto a parchment paper lined cookie sheet when it came out of the oven.  Excellent!

After reading all these great reviews I had the highest expectations. What went wrong for me was that I accidently added about 50% more sugar to the dough, so I just had to let it raise for much longer. Also I don't have breadmachine but I'm not new to baking, I followed all the steps as I should have. They were tasty when they first came out, but now not even 24 hours later they're not half as nice. not bad, just not as good as I expected!

Fantastic.  Especially when combined with the pecan/caramel mixture from Cinnamon Rolls II.

I looked a long time for a cinnamon roll recipe that tasted like my grandmother's cinnamon rolls.  She was one of those amazing cooks who never wrote anything down.  This recipe is by far the closest I've gotten and everyone loves them.  The only thing I do differently is prepare the dough in a bread machine.  It works just as well.

I'd rate this six stars, if I could!  I've finally found a cinnamon roll recipe that fits what I've been looking for -- soft, gooey but not overly-gooey, not overly-sweet, and not crusty.  I didn't even put an icing sugar or cream cheese glaze on my first batch and they were fantastic just like that.    I did use more than 1 tbsp of cinnamon and after they were done baking, I did brush them lightly with soft margarine.  I would also recommend that they are cut apart and removed from the pan within about a half-hour before the caramel on the bottom dries and they get stuck.  I'm glad that I took mine out when I did to prevent ripping them. I did see that a reviewer recommended that the sauce only be boiled 1 minute, so I'll try that next time.  I also loved the tip about flipping the pan upside down onto a platter so that the rest of the caramel oozes down onto the rolls.   I would recommend that the recipe instructions be written better though.  There is no point in making the caramel until the dough cycle is nearly done, or it just cools and stiffens.  The approximate size of the rectangle should be in the recipe.  I saw that was addressed as being about 12X17.  Also, there is no need in preheating the oven before the buns are prepared and have risen for the 45 minutes.  A person could preheat the oven at 40 minutes into the rising instead.   My husband is going to be one happy camper when he gets home from hockey and tries these.  They were love at first bite for me!  lol!

I had high hopes for this as all the reviews seemed so good, but when I made it the dough was more liquid than dough.  I rechecked the proportions and I did it right. I had to add at least an extra cup and a half of flour to the machine to make it so I would be able to handle the dough at all once it came out.  Even then, it was super sticky and difficult to roll up and cut. I let it sit in the pan in the refrigerator all night, then in the morning let it sit for 45 minutes at room temperature before baking.  I had to bake it for 30 minutes instead of the 20-25 listed, and the center parts still seemed not quite done, while the outside and top were a bit overdone. The caramel topping was great, and the flavor of the dough was good too, it just seemed like the proportions for the recipe weren't quite right. Next time I'll either tweak this more or try another dough recipe but keep this topping.

I'm getting ready to make these for the 4th time in 2 weeks!

These are by far the best cinnamon rolls I've ever made. I followed the instructions exactly, except for the ice cream. The first time I made these I only had a little Baskin & Robbins Pralines & Cream for ice cream.  Nooooo problem!  Next I bought carmel pecan ice cream and used that. My son and I ate an entire pan in 2 days instead of 1 day because we were trying not to look like pigs.

I used my favorite sweet dough recipe with the caramel glaze recipe listed. It was fabulous! I was worried it would make the rolls soggy. It didn't. next time I will increase the caramel sauce. I also added pecans in the pans- delicious!

These were fantastic!  I made them as written except I only spread 1/4 cup of butter on the dough.  I will make some changes next time, I will do either 1.5 or 2 times the caramel sauce, and I will also not cook the caramel sauce for 2 full minutes, it got a little too hard.  Also, they did not rise in the refrigerator overnight for me, but they rose the next morning when I took them out, and rose even more when they began baking.  I will definitely make these again, they disappeared!

The flavor of these cinnamon rolls is fantastic. My husband, who is fussy about these things said, "If you put a white, icing sugar glaze over the top, it would be as good as any I have ever tasted". Did I mention that he has a sweet tooth? LOL

What a great recipe.  I made these for Christmas morning and it couldn't have been easier. I made a couple of changes though.  Instead of the full three cups of bread flour, I used two and substituted a cup of Whole Wheat flour for the third. I also didn't have any vanilla ice cream and instead used light half and half in the caramel sauce.  It probably didn't turn out as creamy as the original, but since none of us had eaten the original recipe, nobody noticed. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

Look out Cinnabon!  These could put you out of business!  I added extra brown sugar and a little more butter.  Leave them to rise in the fridge overnight.  I topped with cream cheese icing (softened cream cheese, confectioners sugar, and vanilla).  Oh my God!  Heaven!

OMG, these were SOOOO delicious!!  However, I rolled these up starting from the short side of the rectangle by accident, so the rolls were pretty huge across and I only got 8 (1-1/2") rolls from the log.  But that's OK, they fit in my 9x13 pan perfectly and made jumbo-sized sticky buns.  :)  The dental floss cutting trick worked like magic!  I've always had problems cutting my cinnamon rolls and this way was a breeze and didn't smush the rolls.  I started these last night and let them rise and bake this morning for my husband for Father's Day and he...I mean WE ALL...loved them!  I did use a 1/2 cup more flour right off the bat as suggested, increased the caramel sauce by 1/2 and also sprinkled a cup of pecans over the sauce before placing the rolls.  Definitely invert the pan of rolls onto a large serving dish after baking, and scrape every bit of that delicious sauce over the rolls.  These were so easy using the bread machine and I will certainly make these again!!  Yum!

I was told i was the best MOM in the neighborhood if i would make these everyday. 
Takes a little time but definately worth it

mmmm...excellent stuff! i like to make 1.5 times the caramel sauce (it's just so good), use pastry flour instead of bread (a lighter bun) and add chopped pecans to the pan (crunchy!)...easy to make (even though i've never worked with bread and yeast before). everyone loves it and my feelings go beyond love ;^)

Wonderful!  This was my first attempt ever at making cinnamon buns, and am I ever glad to have discovered this recipe!  Made it as written, except I melted the butter and used a pastry brush to brush it on the dough, and I added a couple handfuls of raisins.  I found the dough to be very soft, but manageable.  My friend told me about using dental floss to cut the roll of dough, which worked like a charm.  Everyone enjoyed these.  I will definitely make them again! Thanks Kathy, for sharing this recipe!  It's a keeper for sure!

This recipe makes the best homemade cinnamon rolls I have ever had.  I do find, like some of the others have said, that it needs a little extra flour.  I usually just add about 1 cup extra right from the start.  It is a very forgiving recipe, so whether you modify it or not it turns out great.  My family and friends love it with the Cinnabon Icing recipe from copykat.com.  Thanks for the great recipe, Kathy!

These are definitely the best cinnamon buns I've ever made! I omit the powdered milk (don't have any), slightly reduce the butter and sugar spread on the dough, and when I don't have any ice cream on hand I substitute skim milk with 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract for the sauce and it's *almost* as good. As soon as they're out of the oven I immediately loosen the edges with a spatula and invert the entire pan over a cookie sheet so some of the sauce runs back down into the buns. They do tend to get a bit dry by the third day, but they rarely last that long! These freeze wonderfully so I often make a double batch and freeze half of them individually (that way I can pull one out of the freezer in the morning, pop it in the microwave and in 45 seconds I've got a hot and gooey breakfast - yum!!).

This is an outstanding recipe.  I did make a slight change in that I made 1-1/2 times the called for amount of caramel mixture.  I wanted to be able to flip the pan after baking and have enough caramel to "ooze" down the sides of the rolls to cover.  Also, I found a totally successful resolution to rolling out the sticky dough.  I patted it out onto my Silpat cookie baking mat!  No sticking whatsoever.  If you don't have a Silpat mat, buy one.  They're the greatest invention ever for those of us that bake a lot of cookies.  They run about $15-$19 each and cover the cookie sheet so you don't have to grease it.  Excellent roll recipe!

I made this recipe today and was really surprised! I bake on a pretty regular basis but have never done any yeast items so this was a first for me. Even though I don't own a bread maker or think that they rised suffiecently, they came out fabulous. I did tweak the recipe a bit though. :)  I followed the breading recipe to a t, and thought the dough was a little wet but it was still workable. On the caramel recipe, I added a little more brown sugar and butter. Once I lined the pan, I sprinkled chopped pecans on it. On the filling, I melted a whole stick, added more brown sugar, around a teaspoon of cinnamon, and a little white sugar. I made extra so I could pour it over the cinnamon rolls once I got them out of the oven.  These are ooey gooey goodness! I just love them. They are moist and light! Fabulous recipe!

These have to be the best cinnamon rolls my husband and I have ever had.  I halved the amount of brown sugar cinnamon filling.  Instead of the cream cheese icing, I used half a cup of powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp. of 1% milk, and 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract.  They were wonderful!!!

Incredible, addicting and satisfying!  I'm rating the dough, because I used other recipes for filling and topping.  This dough turned out perfectly tender, moist and fluffy.  Used regular flour--needed an extra cup; omitted dry milk, used cream. Baked at 350* for 30 minutes.  We devoured it while watching the fireworks.  We were delighted and thought it was wicked and very dangerous! ;)  Definitely will make again.

So I've been making these for years now and just now reviewing. These are pretty perfect. I almost ALWAYS have problems with the caramel sauce-it gets hard as rock in the pan after baking. I've used different ice creams, sugar, butter, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong there. But the dough is such a dream to work with, very tender and soft, easy to roll. I have to always add extra flour also, but use less than the whole 1/2 cup of butter during the spreading process. In addition, I make the "Cinnabon" cream cheese icing just in case they weren't already bad for you.

Very Very Very Good
Here is what I changed in the recipe---Use 3 3/4 cup bread flour, 2 tbs cinnamon in place of 1, Use 1/2 heavy cream in place of 1/2 cup ice cream, add 1/2 cup walnuts to filling, after baking turn upside down on platter and add 1/2 cup walnuts on top of caramel.------this is the best cinnamon rolls ever, will never buy them in grocery store again.

I printed out this recipe years ago, and just tried it today. I prepared the dough in the breadmaker, made the rolls, let them rise in the baking pan for 45mins, then refrigerated overnight.  Left it out of the 'fridge for 30mins while heating the oven, and ended up baking it for 27mins in a 9" x 13" pan.  Great recipe.  I do agree that 1/2 cup more flour would make it easier to handle the dough, it was a bit sticky.  I might try it with pecans the next time, and may increase the caramel then, but without nuts the amount of caramel in the recipe seemed fine to me.  Definitely a keeper!

These rolls were terrific, but the caramel topping didn't turn out right for me. The dough seemed to get a little mushy. I will try them again to see where I went wrong. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very good. I added 1/2 cup flour to the dough and some cinnamon to the ice cream mixture. Used frosting from the clone of a cinnabon recipe. yummy.

Good but dough came out of bread machine very sloppy, had to add in about 1/2 c. flour to get it to handle well enough to pat out. The carmel topping is easy and very tasty. Will use that in my cinnamon roll recipes in the future. As far as this recipe goes, I may or may not make it again. All in all though very good cinnamon rolls.

I think this is the best sticky bun recipe ever.  The caramel topping is simply delicious.  For those who felt the dough was too sticky to work with, I would suggest spraying your work  surface with PAM, as well as your rolling pin before  rolling out the dough.

I was just reading the ratings on this recipe. I  am sorry some of you are having trouble with it. I believe the difference in flour can affect the outcome. I have always made this recipe in a bread machine and used bread flour, I check it after it mixes a little and add a bit more flour if it is a little sticky. I put a little shortening on the counter top and pat the dough out into the rectangle. Sorry...

The pastry on this one is excellent; moist and very tender, and it browns beautifully. The caramel soaks into the bottom of the rolls, giving them a great sweet/gooey flavor/texture. I really liked that I don't need to ice these. I'll definitely make these again.

these were AWESOME!!! i used my own bread dough recipe because it calls for fewer ingredients (it is a variation of the Best Bread Machine Bread recipe from this site). since there are only 2 of us i used 1/2 the dough for these and used an 8x8 pan. (the other 1/2 will be used to make burger buns later in the week). i added some orange juice and zest to the caramel sauce. i also added some raisins to the "swirl" layer. i loved the flavor of the vanilla in these. what a great way to use up some old ice cream from the freezer.

These were delicious. My wife raved about them.  My kids were polite about it, but it was clear that they're more traditionalists when it comes to cinnamon rolls. They like the goo on the top, rather than on the bottom.   I followed the recipe to the letter, *except* for one thing.  I didn't have any powdered milk.  So I used powdered 'instant breakfast' (vanilla) instead.  I was a little worried about it, but it doesn't seem to have done it any harm.

This recipe is so easy and tastes much better than store bought.  I used the frosting recipe from clone of a cinnabon in addition to the carmel sauce for extra indulgence.  These cinnamon rolls also freeze well.

Wow!  I have finally found my cinnamon roll recipe...I thought the dough needed an extra cup of flour as well.  As is, they reminded more of a sticky bun.  Will try the cream cheese frosting next time.  My 4 kids devoured them!

I messed up the topping because it was more jell like, but that was my own fault.  I found this recipe way too sweet even for me who loves sweets.  Although they rose well, I thought the dough was rather "pudgy" and not too my families liking.  Jean Pare has an awesome Cinnamon Buns recipe in her Potato Cook Book.  Nice texture as mashed potatoes are add to the dough. Definitely Cinnamon flavour as opposed to Caramel of this recipe.  Also, time wise, Pare's recipe makes 36 buns as opposed to 12 in this recipe and takes the same amount of time with a much nicer Cinnamon flavour, great texture and beautiful rise using regular flour and they freeze great. Raisins are a really nice addition to Pare's recipe.

Also do not like the 1/2 cup of butter in this recipe.  Had to double check to make sure I was reading it right. That's one hang of a lot of butter.

Sorry but I won't make this recipe again.
As always, to each their own.

I used cream instead of ice cream and added raisins prior to rolling and they turned out fantastic. Definitely the best cinnamon bun recipe I have ever tried

My husband and I loved these.  The only thing about them was that it took longer than 15 minutes to cook.  We weren't sure when they were finished and so after putting on the frosting and trying to eat them we discovered that it was still doughy. In spite of that we are planning on making them again really soon knowing what to watch for this time.  Absolutely wonderful.

I love my cinnamon roll recipe - but this was a great change for more of a caramel sticky bun. These were FABULOUS - I added more cinnamon (personal preference), but would not change a thing in this recipe. I made these on Christmas eve, and baked them Christmas morning. This was a wonderful treat for my family. Thank you for sharing this recipe! This recipe gets 10 stars from us!

VERY soft and tasty rolls.  Double the gooey stuff.  Only criticism is in the name of the recipe...these are NOT cinnamon rolls...they are sticky rolls. Some reviewers have iced the rolls...I think that would be a bit much.  The rolls are very sweet as is.  Lastly, you can make the recipe the nite before and keep it in the fridge.  In the morning, let the pan sit outside for 30 minutes and then bake as the recipe indicates.  If your family loves sticky rolls, this is a wonderful recipe.

First of all, there is no need to double up on the caramel...there is more than enough. Secondly, if you have a breadmaker, you don't have to wait the full two hours to make the dough. Just until it's done mixing. Rolling the dough was a little tricky, but totally do-able (I was worried from the reviews) Spread a little extra butter on the inside of the edges to seal it. It was absolutely fabulous...very gooey and very moist. (don't bother adding more than a couple of tablespoons of extra flour)

These are GREAT!! I had a little trouble getting a decent rectangle, and mine didn't look as perfect as the picture, but they tasted divine! I didn't have any icecream so I used heavy cream. Next time I think I will soak some raisins in tea overnight and add them prior to the roll-up stage. Thanks, Kathy!

This recipe is a winner.  I added pecans and when the oven timer went off I left them in the oven so that the bread wouldn't be doughy.  Warning though, don't make them and then go out of town for a day, my friend that fed my dog ate them all.  I didn't get a one.

These were great!  
I didn't have ice cream on hand, so used whipping cream and white sugar as someone else had suggested.  I also didn't have milk powder, so just used warm 2% milk.  I did add 2-3 Tbsp. flour. (I live in a very moist climate and often have to add a little extra flour.) The dough was still real tender, but that took away the stickiness.  I didn't have any trouble working with the dough. I only used 1/4 cup butter spread on the dough, and that seemed like plenty.  I also put in some extra cinnamon because we love it!  
I made the dough up on Christmas Eve, left them in the fridge until Christmas morning and we had hot rolls for breakfast.  Delicious! 8 year old son hopes I make them every year for Christmas morning.   Made another batch the 27th as a gift for a neighbor.

I was kind of dissapointed after having read all of the wonderful reviews. I followed the steps and my rolls turned out all gooey and uncooked on the bottom due to the caramel. The flavor was very good and I actually think that if cooked without the caramel bottom these could turn out awesome, just save the caramel for the topping as usual.

These are terrific!  I am making my fourth of fifth pan of these rolls this morning.  I agree with those who have said you need to add additional flour, but I've never used a whole additional cup of flour...maybe a half cup.  I usually make a half recipe for breakfast for two with bacon/sausage and fruit or eggs.  Give it a try but don't add too much additional flour or my doughs get too 'solid.'

WOW~~ these are fabulous.. and really easy!  The dough does need more flour than the recipe calls for.  I live above 6500 feet and ended up adding about 1 1/2 cups more flour.. but don't make your dough too stiff.  The beauty of these rolls is the softness of the dough, and the ice cream in the caramel sauce is genious.  I have made them two times in the span of two days.  They didn't make it to the evening!  YUM!!  You will keep this one in the front of your recipe box for sure.  Highly recommended!

This is a wonderful recipe. My family loves these. In one weeks time I have made 4 pans.  I did do a couple of things alittle different though, One I added about 1 cup more of flour, and secondly I made a icing to go on top as well it makes them extreamly sweet but everyone who has ate them loved them.  The icing I did was 3oz. of cream cheese, 1 and 1/2 cups of powder sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 cup of butter, and 1/8 tsp of salt. Wonderful recipe!!! Thank you for sharing!

Mmm-mm.  My husband gave these a perfect 10! Following suggestions, I did double the caramel and was glad I did.  I kept 1/4 of it in a bowl for dipping as it was a little too much to have in the pan.  Plus, I used part cool-whip instead of all ice cream and it worked just fine.

I was dissappointed in this recipe.  First off it should be called caramel rolls instead of cinnamon.  They were very time consuming to make and dough was very difficult to work with.  Not a favorite at my house.

This has become my favorite go to recipe.  I am famous among family and friends for these.  The only thing I do differently is I don't do the caramel for the bottom of the pan, because it's just over the top and too gooey.  Without the caramel, people rave about these and always ask for the recipe.  I use a basic butter/cream cheese/powdered sugar/vanilla recipe for the frosting.  Yum!  Also, I love the ease of using a breadmaker for the dough.

I've always thought that the cinnamon roll recipe that I've used for years was the best. This recipe blew it out of the water. I even thought I ruined them when they didn't seem to raise very well. Fortunately, they sprang up in the oven and turned out perfectly. I followed another reviewer's advice and inverted the pan so that the caramel ran down the sides and covered the whole roll. I'm embarrased to admit that my husband and I finished off the entire pan in one day! By the way, I liked the caramel sauce so much that I'm going to use it as a quick ice cream topping.

These are so good, that they are dangerous!  I have made these 5 or 6 times and they always come out great.  I just follow the recipe... It does seem like too much butter, but if you cut the butter, there isn't as much caramel, and they don't get as gooey and dry out quickly.  When I use all of the butter in the recipe...they are even better a day later! Oh, I also add crushed walnuts or pecans before I roll them up... fantastic!

These rolls were great.  I substituted the ice cream with whipping cream and they came out well.  The rolls were moist, had lots of flavor and the sauce was the 'icing on the cake'.  Will definitely make these again.

Fantastic recipe!  Mine needed the extra 3/4 c. flour.  On my second time making these, I made the dough and rolled them out at night.  I stored the pan in the fridge, took them out for about 30 min. in the morning, and baked.  Fresh, hot cinnamon rolls for my birthday!

These were absolutely delicious when hot from the oven. I thought the amount of topping was perfect. I was really surprised at how easy it was to work with the dough. I didn't spread on the full amount of butter and added raisins before rolling it up. They were a little dry the second day, but most bread products are. I don't know if using the full amount of butter would have kept the bread more moist.

Wonderful recipe!  Loved them so much and so did the whole family.  Definitely a favorite of ours, so much so that we added it to our recipe box for future bakings!!!  Thank you!  These reminded me of my Great-Grandmother's handmade recipe!

What a wonderful recipe!  My family devoured these rolls in no time flat.  My husband says these are the best cinnamon rolls he's ever had.  Thanks for the great recipe!  We will make again & again.

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made.  They were easy to make with the bread machine and the ice cream topping is just right. I am already making my second batch of cinnamon rolls.

The 'icing' on this recipe is baked on the bottom of the pan.  It seemed to almost bake into the rolls and made my family think something was missing.  The top (or bottom after you get them out of the pan) dried out.

I don't have a bread machine, so I made this recipe manually. Turned out excellent. The caramel sauce is wonderful...I intend doubling the quantity of the sauce next time and dipping the rolls once again after baking.

These are the best cinnamon rolls i have ever tasted in my whole life. The bottom turns out really well and is so addictive. I used chocolate ice cream instead and doubled the syrup mixture.

I had my husband make this up today and he liked the end results but did not care for the fact it did not seem like enough flour so he added more.  

But the end results were great and I added a glaze icing to the top of the rolls to make it sweeter.

These were very good.  Very soft, the texture reminded me of honey buns. Mine didn't turn out pretty but very good.  I didn't have vanilla ice cream so I used 1\2 cup of heavy whipping and some vanilla extract.

These turned out very much like the picture shows, and the consistency was light and the flavor was good.  I baked them in a glass pan and inverted the pan immediately after baking onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  The rolls came right out, but I had to use a spatula to get some of the caramel topping out of the pan, but that wasn't a big deal.  I made them the night before and in the morning, I took them out of the refrigerator and let them set for 2 hours before baking.  My husband and daughter liked them, but I had made two kinds of rolls, and all three of us preferred the other rolls as our favorite.  These rolls, with the caramel topping, are quite sweet, but I really can't say there is anything lacking in the recipe.

AMAZING! My family lived these!  I made as the recipe states except I added a few pecan on some of the rolls because I like them but my family doesn't. I made and baked these in an afternoon, these are incredible right out of the oven warm!   They are just as incredible warmed up in the microwave the next morning! Not dry or 'day old' tasting!  I gave these as a gift to some friends and they loved them!  Easy and incredibly yummy!  A breakfast staple now in my house!

I followed recipe exactly (unusual for me).  Next time I would use a little less butter on top of rolled dough because when I rolled it up some of the butter/sugar mixture squeezed out.  I flipped over while still hot and you could see all the carmel oozing down into buns, but then they seemed to collapse a little.  Not sure what causes that.   I also think I like them better with frosting.  But either way, still pretty good.

These buns are awesome!!!! Soft in the middle and kinda crunchy on top! Everyone raved! I didn't make them as buns, instead I got mini ramekins and put caramel in the bottom of each one. Then I put brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. I took balls of dough, put them in the brown sugar mixture and put them in the ramekins. I then spooned the remaining caramel on top. They were delicious!!! Thank you!

These were great.  My daughter helped me make them and we had a blast.  I love the flavor of the dough and the caramel is yummy.  I cut back on the butter by half and used 2 tbsp. of milk and 1 tbsp of powdered vanilla pudding to replace the powdered milk and it was great.  The only reason we are giving it 4 stars is because it is NOT a cinnamon roll, but a sticky bun or caramel roll.  Great recipe Kathy!

This is hands down the BEST cinnamon roll recipe I have ever made! I added more sugar to the rolls, but that was the only change. I made this and took it to work and everyone LOVED them!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Fantastic recipe!  On getting to the "sprinkle cinnamon on" part I realized I didn't have any cinnamon!!!!  I just carried on with the recipe and called them caramel rolls ;) and everyone absolutely loved them, thank you!

These are absolutely wonderful cinnamon rolls.  I added the extra flour to the dough and it turned out just right.  Next time I will double the caramel topping because it was so good!

This recipe was so easy!  The rolls turned out perfect, nice and light with a delicious caramel sauce.  They were a little dry the second day, but 20 seconds in the microwave softened them right up.  I will be using this recipe often!

Very soft dough -- requires rather more flour than indicated.  I tried the author's suggestion of greasing the rolling surface.  It helped a bit.  My review's not completely fair, since I substituted soy lecithin for eggs.  I was satisfied with the resulting texture, and the kids LOVED the rolls -- but husband was picky and could tell the difference.  Using bread machine saved a lot of time.

This is a GREAT recipe.  We made it for Thanksgiving morning and it was a smash.  For some added zest we chopped about 1 cup of pecans and sprinkled into the caramel mixture.  It turned out GREAT.  I suggest this recipe to all Cinnamon Roll lovers...Cinnabon...Move over!

I'm sorry but this recipe produced cinnamon rolls that were just not sweet enough for me.  An earlier reviewer suggested doubling the carmel sauce.  I would increase it by 50%.  After the rolls are cooked I advise adding icing for an added, but different sweetness.

Really good!  I think I should have kneaded the dough after I took it out of the bread machine...it was a little soft and hard to handle.  They still came out wonderful, though!
