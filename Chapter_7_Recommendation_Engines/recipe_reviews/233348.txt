This is an excellent sauce!  I used fresh herbs, from my garden, in place of the dry.  I had homemade sausage I used and it was enough to sub for the beef as well.  I added at least a tablespoon or so of crushed red pepper because we like a little heat.  I toasted Allison with a glass of red wine and one for the pot in her honor.  I opted to use 3 29 oz. cans of sauce. Two 29 oz and one can of water for the 76 ounces of water as we like a thicker sauce.   The sauce was flavorful and meaty.  Wonderful aroma and I could not resist dipping some crusty bread into it; just to *test* it :)  The recipe makes quite a bit so I used half over some linguini and froze the rest to appreciate another day.  Peace and blessings, Allison.

I have to wonder how this recipe turned out for some and not others. I followed it EXACTLY, right up until it came time to add the water. I had serious doubts about the volume called for, which is A LOT. So, I hedged and only added half. Am I ever glad I did, because even three hours of simmering in, it was still trying to thicken up. I kept at it for another couple of hours, with the lid off to keep reducing, and it did finally thicken. We still ended up with a small pool of liquid below the pasta on each plate though, so wishing I had stirred in a 1/4 cup of cornstarch at the end, to mitigate that. The flavor of the sauce was really nice but if I were to make it again, I would double the whole recipe and only add in about a cup or two of water rather than the 72 ounces. The recipe description said to expect a LOT of sauce but we only got two meals out of it, and that was for two kids and two adults.

The water is dependent on the type of tomato puree you use. Some brands will be more watery than others. Use San Marzano puree as it is much thicker than most brands. I am sure the original recipe is old, and most likely from Italy, so it would make sense to use that much water with Italian tomatoes. The original recipe stated to use the cans to fill up the water, 2 29 oz cans of tomatoes, and one can of paste for the water. So the amount of water would be far less if it had some puree and paste still left in the can, as well as most people would not fill it to the top when they add water to a can and transfer it to their pot! After letting the meat and onions cook, I transferred the rest of the ingredients to my slow cooker, (fit perfectly in my 6 qt.) ,and simmered for 5 hours on low. I have made this several times, and it is fantastic. My family of four can easily get two full meals out of it. Thanks Allison (dog fish head) for sharing your recipe, your legacy lives on! May you rest in peace.

This is the best Spaghetti Sauce I've ever had or ever made! I put ALL the spices in my Magic Bullet to completely blend and pulverize, then added them as per the directions. Other than that I made exactly as written. It has the texture and flavor of an "HOURS" cooked sauce. I do believe the trick to this recipe is the minimum of 2 hours simmering with the lid OFF! It came out perfect. I fed 4 Granddaughters, my youngest son and husband & myself. There wasn't one drop left. I will be making this again and will make for gifts and canning too. Really the very best Spaghetti Sauce ever!!! If I could, I would give this 10 STARS!!!

Oh my!  This is the WORST spaghetti sauce I have ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly and after two hours my sauce looked like a thin soup.  I decided to let the sauce simmer longer (for 6 hours) and it still never thickened!  By that point I figured I would try it anyway hoping the flavor was good.  Nope!  The sauce was very acidic and the tomato flavor was very strong.  I had to add some sugar to counteract the acidity and tomato taste.  I also had to add more garlic and other spices to get the mix right.  The only reason I rated this a 2 and not a 1 is because after my doctoring of the sauce it was edible.  I will NEVER make this sauce again.  If you choose to make it, I suggest using much less water (and less tomato paste), adding sugar, more garlic, less rosemary.

I can't believe it took me this long to try this, this is GREAT sauce!  I made this yesterday.  everyone says it makes a lot.  it takes a big pot to make it in that's for sure.  I made a few changes:  used 1 can (29oz.) crushed tomatoes, and 1 can (29oz.) tomato puree, filled 1 can with the water called for. used extra garlic (family preference), added fresh rosemary, fresh oregano, and just a touch of Savory.  along with all the other spices it called for.  (my mistake) was using Chicken Sweet Italian sausages I had on hand. Not realizing that they were fully cooked, and had sun dried tomatoes in them. That being so, the sauce still came out great!  The 3 of us ate large portions and still had 3 16 oz. containers to put into the freezer for later.   So next time I will use a mild Italian sausage, and ground beef. also will use extra garlic still. and as many fresh herbs as I can. but will cut back the butter just a bit.  (personal thing)   Thank you Dog Fish Head for sharing such a wonderful recipe with us!

Absolutely delicious meat sauce. Omitted the butter as the olive oil was plenty to saute the onion and garlic. Simmered for 3-1/2 hours and had a thick, hearty sauce. The seasonings were spot on. Mushrooms would make a good addition, also. Thanks, Allison. RIP

Family thought that this was a good recipe but I had to do a few tweeks.  First I only put in 6 cups of water (recipe calls for 9 1/2 cups) and still found it to thin so next time will cut back to 4 cups.  Found that the tomato taste was strong but correct that by adding sugar and I also added 1 tbsp of garlic powder and an addition tbsp of Italiam seasoning.   Will be making again.  RIP Allison and thank you.

I made this when it was still a personal recipe and rated it 5 stars....Very easy to make and the kitchen smells so wonderful! The sauce has great flavor, very hearty! I didn't use the butter and I used half hot and half mild sausage. Will definitely be making on a regular basis. I am only sorry I didn't make this sooner. Thank you so much for sharing, Allison.

Just finished dinner & this sauce IS awesome! I'm not a fan of rosemary but decided to make it as written the first time(but I did sub all ground beef instead 1/2 beef, 1/2 sausage). I'd halve it(rosemary) next time. It's pretty prominent. Totally my preference, tho!

I have made spaghetti sauce for many years, I no longer need to look at a recipe .  The hamburger usually cooks off enough grease to brown the onions and garlic.  I find that using a half cup of butter and some olive oil is ridiculous.  I usually end up pouring off grease most of the grease from the hamburger after the onions have been sauteed because I don't  want the finished sauce to be oily or greasy.  Oil and grease do not add the the taste of the sauce.

We love this spaghetti sauce recipe.  I usually just make the sauce, omitting the meat and make Meatball Nirvana recipe for the meatballs.  This recipe is great as-is, but is also so versatile, that I now usually make it with the tomato puree and two large cans of San Marzano tomatoes, coarsely chopped. I sometimes skip adding the tomato paste and adjust the water amount to 1/3 of the amount called for.  Just awesome!

After I poured the water in the meat mixture, I had serious doubts but as it cooked, a wonderfully textured sauce developed.  It was DELICIOUS.  I didn't change a thing except to cook it for 3 hours instead of 2.

Made this for the second time, made 1 1/2 times recipe; used Italian sausage and added dried parsley and only about 1/3 of the water called for in the recipe.  Love it!!

OMG!!! 76 oz of water??!!!

Like a fool I followed the recipe right down to the 76 oz of water, and that's where an otherwise good recipe ingredient-wise fell apart.

I started preparing it at 4pm, had it ready to go at 5pm. I knew when I put the water in something did't seem right. Forget  "simmering" for 2 hrs- you'll be simmering for several days!

I figure 6 hrs on a near-boil to steam off all the water. Then it is the way it should be. I say "figure" because it is now 10pm, and I have at least another hour to go.

My suggestion is to FORGET the water, or use maybe a cup of water or beef broth, and all will be well.

Yes I will make it again but without the water. Stupid me, and I'm Italian, and should know better.

Outstanding, no tweaking.  Makes a ton of hearty thick sauce (oops, I forgot the water!) but you can freeze it or give some to a friend!  RIP Allison, you'll be toasted every time this is made.

I have put this off in the past due to the butter, but yesterday I was reminded that one should enjoy every day.  I made a half batch, no skimping on the butter, and my homemade crushed tomatoes weren't quite as thick as puree so I added a little extra paste to compensate. The only other change was my homemade hot Italian sausage, as I had no mild left. Thanks for the recipe, Allison. I'm sorry I didn't try it sooner, but it is a definite keeper. Thanks for sharing your gift...June 26, 2013

This is very rich but oooohhhh sooooo good!! I followed this for the most part but did add some favorite seasoning and herbs. Don't be afraid of all the water, it cooks down and helps soften the flavors as it reduces. This make 3 2lb deli containers for the freezer. Loved it!

FANATSTIC! I did halve all of the spices b/c we do not care for a 'strongly spiced' sauce, and that was perfect for us. I simmered mine about 3 hours and it came out wonderfully thick, and super flavorful. I thought about Allison the entire time I was making this, and that made me smile...This is a new family favorit~YUM! Thank You, Allision, RIP.

I did change a little but not too much.  No butter for the sauté just a wee bit of olive oil.  Thank you for this recipe, I wish I could have told you how much I liked it when you were here.  Everyone loved it at this house!  It is a keeper!

Being an Italian I must say this is a good base recipe for sauce. The trick is in the LONG cook time. Good Italian red sauce simmers for hours to let all the flavors meld. Also- please DO NOT add any sugar for goodness sake. That's an american thing. If you want the sauce sweeter then use san marzano tomatoes (very sweet) and red onion or sweet onion. No need for sugar. My grandma usually adds fennel to her sauce (she's from Napoli), and you could easily do that. Also red pepper adds a nice kick. Good 'go to' recipe!

Delicious sauce.  This will forever be my basic red sauce recipe.  I made two changes:  (1) ghee instead of butter and (2) San Marzano crushed tomatoes instead of puree.  Ghee gives it more richness and depth. SM crushed tomatoes have less water and are more flavorful; reduces wonderfully.  Crushed instead of pureed as I like a more rustic sauce.  Many thanks for this excellent recipe.

This was an amazing recipe, with a few modifications.  I did not omit the butter as some others have done, but halved it (I think it adds depth).  Instead of 9.5 cups of water, I added 7, along with 1.5 cups of red wine and the liquid from reconstituted wild mushrooms (about 1 cup).  Also added chopped wild mushrooms, halved kalamata olives, capers, and about a tsp of Umami paste.  I was dubious of the rosemary in this recipe but it blends perfectly.  Definitely recommend adding the salt, though it says optional.  I also simmered covered for 1.5 hours, then uncovered for another hour to reduce it down.  Beautiful!!!!!

I've been making this recipe for years and it's still the best one ever!  I use hot sausage instead of the mild and sometimes I'll add extra rosemary.  It makes a lot and freezes very well!  This is the secret to my awesome lasagna!

wow, this is delish. I saw Allison's photos and when I told hubby I was making this. He asked me to make it chunkier with meat because that's how he likes it. So I added about 3/4th of a pound more hamburger. It was thick and hearty just like my hubby likes it. I will make again. The aromatics in the house smelled amazing and wouldn't change a thing other then keeping the amount of meat in it, that I did. Miss you Dog Fish ;-) and thank you for sharing your recipe here for others to try. I will keep this one close to my heart and always in my recipe box!

Confession time: my husband is so darn picky that I typically use spaghetti sauce from a jar because it's not worth my effort to make homemade sauce that he won't eat.  I'm not sure what came over me, but I decided to try this recipe and am so glad I did.  It is easy, delicious, and it makes enough for multiple meals.  Although initially I was scared by the amount of butter, it did give the sauce a terrific mouthfeel.  (How can you go wrong with butter and sausage?)  I'm glad to report that my husband liked this recipe, but even if he didn't, I would make it again for myself!

We think this is a 5-star recipe!  It lends itself well to whatever meats you care to add because you can always adjust the seasoning to complement them.  In my case I used up a little al fresco chicken and apple sausage that I had to go along with the hamburger meat, so I knew it needed a heavy dose of Italian seasoning--a little more oregano and fennel.  I thought the base of this (tomato/water/garlic/onion) was right on the mark!  Obviously Allison had worked long and hard to get this ratio just right!  Well done!  This will be a go-to recipe for spaghetti sauce!  And I love that I can freeze part of this for those nights I just don't feel like cooking!  Thanks, Allison!

Do not use the 76 oz of water! I used 32 oz and it was still quite thin, had to simmer for 5 hours.
This is a basic sauce recipe, we like more vegetables so I added celery, carrots, mushrooms and green pepper. We also like our sauce a bit spicier so I used hot Italian sausage and added a 1/4 tsp red hot pepper flakes.
I added a few tbsps of brown sugar to even out the acid from the tomato paste and omitted the butter and used 1 tbsp olive oil.
This can be customized to your taste, just the water amount is way too much.

The sauce was very good, but when it was combined with the 
al dente pasta it lost way too much of its flavor. In addition, I only added 20 ounces of water and the only other exception is that I used 2.5 pounds of 90/10 ground beef since I don't eat pork. I then followed the recipe exactly for the remaining ingredients and directions. I will definitely be revisiting this recipe again, but will probably double the spices along with adding some mushrooms, bell peppers, and black olives.

To the folks that said their sauce turned out thin and watery, don't cover it while cooking. The lid keeps moisture in and adds to the sauce. Try it without covering

I loved this recipe. I used sweet and spicy venison 1lb and  and 3/4 lb rib eyes. I followed suggestion for. A thicker sauce with the 2 cans of purée and one can of water. I did still use the three cans paste.

I used this recipe as my base and I really liked it! I didn't have butter so I used all olive oil and sauteed my onion and garlic (and some red pepper flakes) before I added the hamburger and italian sausage which I doubled. I used all tomato sauce instead of paste and puree as I didn't have that on hand. The italian seasoning that I used had lots of rosemary in it already so I left out the extra rosemary. After I cooked it I transfered it to my crockpot on low for about 4 hours.  Every one was ravng about it and it was even better for lunch today after sitting overnight.

Do yourself a favor and use the butter!  I made a half batch of this because I was skeptical of the rosemary and the butter..I was wrong!  This was wonderful!  I was forced to use half of the meat for meatballs because of the family, but I fried them in butter to keep the same flavor profile.  We will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe yesterday exactly as written.  The sauce never did thicken after a long cooking time.  I found that there was far too much sauce for the amount of meat.  Although it had a decent taste, if I made it again (which is highly unlikely) I would reduce the water.

I'm sure, to a young bride, this recipe seemed huge.  But as families grow, so do the size of the appetites. This is very similar to one I have made for years, because I'm the Irish Girl who likes to cook Italian.  (old commercial)  Only difference is, I double the Tomato paste, (3 12 oz cans), and only use a pat of butter,  I do add a good sprinkle of basil too.  The water proportion is the same, 2 cans of water for each can of paste, and one can of water for the puree.  The more you cook, you adjust to your family's tastes.  This is a very tasty sauce, and thanks to Dog fish head for writing it down.  But please, don't add cornstarch to a red pasta sauce to thicken it, simmer a little longer. Remember, the quality of your ingredients will determine the quality of your sauce..

Very good. Hard for me to leave any recipe alone so I did change it up a bit. Added a cup of red wine instead of water, and some beef broth. A teaspoon of fennel and half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes went in as well. Next time I'll use less butter.

I'm always baffled how some of us have great results with a recipe and others find it horrible.  This was a win for me.  My husband is half Italian, and we make gallons of his family's traditional sauce recipe yearly, but we always like to try a new one now and again.  I was shocked when he said he thinks this might be better than his family's!  Only three changes: left out the butter (and honestly, I might switch to the family method of starting the meat browning and then adding the onion and garlic without olive oil - I drained a lot of fat before adding the liquids), a bit of sugar partway through, and the recommendation of another reviewer to sub another can of purée for part of the water.  I also used the frugal Italian housewife method of rinsing the cans with hot water to flush out all the contents and making that part of my added water.  My husband always thinks his sauce tastes better the next day or after freezing, so he's interested to see what flavors develop with this one.

I agree with one of the other reviewers. This has way way too much water. I doubled the recipe and you can't see any meat or onion. I had to go back to the store to buy 2 more pounds of beef and 2 more pounds of italian sausage. I plan to cook it all day and hope that it thickens. I am so aggravated by this recipe, hope it tastes good as there is a lot that went into it.

I've made this twice now. Once according to the instructions & once amending the recipe. The first time I used canned tomato puree which is always to sweet for my tastes. The spaghetti sauce was also insanely watery. I let it simmer for 7 hours and still it was more like a watery soup than a sauce.  Today I made a second batch, amended. I started with making my own tomato puree. It's incredibly easy to do.  I made the rest according to the instructions except I used about a third less water, used spicy Italian sausage and squeezed half a lemon into the sauce so it was savory rather than sweet. I also cooked & drained my meats before adding to the sauce.  Since I used the lemon I was able to skip the added salt which is much healthier. Spectacular!

I make this sauce and freeze it in smaller containers so it only takes 10 minutes for the pasta to cook and the sauce to microwave for 2 minutes.  I also buy 5lbs gr beef and freeze that in portion containers for sauce meatloaf hamburgers chili and taco's etc......

DO NOT! I repeat DO NOT use 76 oz of water. That is 9 1/2 cups of water. It is TOO MUCH for this recipe. I recommend using about 2 1/2 to 3 cups of water depending on how thin you want it..

Given others' notes, I reduced the amount of water, using 32 oz. water and simmered the sauce, uncovered, which provided a nice consistency.

Instead of 76 oz water I used 64 oz beef and chicken broth. Next time I will cook the meats separately to drain off the fat then combine the onion and garlic.

Best spaghetti sauce ever. I use it for lasagna and manicotti. Every one in my family think I'm the best cook in the area. The only thing I change in the recipe is I don't add as much water as it calls for.

Savory and delicious.  I only used 1 tbs butter and 1/2 cup of water which was plenty- figure I could always add if I thought it was necessary, but I like my spaghetti sauce somewhat thick.  Even my picky 3 year old loved it!

I made sure to make the recipe exactly. Be careful to use tomato puree and not tomato sauce. It did have to simmer for over 3 hours, but that was probably my fault. I was worried about it burning so I may have had the heat a little on the low side. It tasted even better the next day when I used it for my lasagna!! This ones a keeper!! When I make it again, I will skip the butter. I thought it was a tad greasy, though no one else seemed to notice. And I will have to add some mushrooms to the mix!!

This was a really great tasting sauce. I used it on spaghetti, but I think next time I'd make mastaccioli with it. I made it in a crockpot and froze the leftovers. It makes a lot! I was expecting it to be a little bit thicker, but maybe that's because I did use the crock pot. Next time, I'll try on the stove to compare. Wonderful recipe!

This recipe was absolutely delicious! We halved almost all the ingredients (expect for the onion and meat) and only added about 15 ounces of water and it turned out nice and thick like we wanted. Even after halving it there were leftovers for two days. Would recommend to anyone who likes a good bolognese.

A very good basic sauce. Hearty and delicious. I prepared it according to the recipe's instructions. Two hours of simmering time produced the perfect consistency.

This is an excellent sauce recipe! I made it exactly as written. Don't skip the butter! It adds a depth of flavor that is really special. For those who said the sauce did not thicken, I wonder if they covered the pan while it simmered. My batch started out somewhat thin, but after two hours of simmering, UNCOVERED, it was rich and thick, and the meat had really melted into the sauce beautifully.

I love this sauce on spaghetti and for lasagna! My hubby says it's better than his grandmother's homemade sauce. I did make a few changes though, I add the salt but i only use 1 teaspoon, add 1 teaspoon of sugar, and use only 4 cups of water. Other wise i leave everything the same. thanks for the great recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe! Very flavorful but not overpowering. The first attempt at making it, I followed the recipe to a t and it was amazing. The second time I tweaked it to our family's taste by adding sautéed Bell pepper and mushrooms, 2 bay leaves, tossed it all in the crock pot and omitted about 1/3 of the water so I didn't have to simmer so long to thicken. I think no mater what you do with this sauce it is perfect, as is or by adding your favorite veggies.

I love this sauce!  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding one additional can of tomato paste as I was concerned with the water comments and it turned out fantastic.  I had enough sauce to give out to some friends as well as freeze.  Everyone loved it!

Fabulous recipe. Have made this a number of times and the family and extended family beg for it - as is. This last time, I substituted a glass of Chianti for a cup of water. For those that say it is too watery... you can’t rush this.  This is also better after letting it cool for a bit and then reheating prior to serving.

I made this recipe exactly as written with one exception, as it was very similar to a recipe given to me by a woman I met while staying in Italy. The amount of water cooks off during the 2 hours, and I was left with a thick hearty sauce. I wonder if people covered the pot during the simmering process to keep the sauce watery? I didn't have enough bulk sausage, so I used 1.5 pounds of ground beef and a half pound of sausage. I will make this again definitely!

Reduced servings to 22, as I had 3/4 lb each of ground beef and sausage. Also only used 4 cups of water. Still a little thin--likely go with 2 1/2 - 3 cups next time. Liked alot, though--will def make again. Thanks to OP and other reviewers for sharing.

Didn't use the butter, used fresh basil, red wine, and 1/4 c. sugar to omit the acidity.  I really liked the consistency of the sauce.  I also omitted sausage to reduce calories.  I'd make it again. Have fun with seasoning.  That's the best part of making spaghetti sauce.

It was very good sauce once I made a few edits. First I reduced the water since I didn't have the time to let it simmer for hours.  Second I added some additional once all the other ingredients were combined. I added 1 tsp sugar, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp basil, and 1 tbsp parsley.

This sauce was really good, I would make it again. I used 2 additional cans of tomatoes to substitute some of the water. I also like my sauce with veggies so I added diced red and green peppers as well as some mushrooms. It was great!

The taste is  wonderful!  The amount of water in the recipe is ridiculous, and makes me wonder how this has not been corrected in the original recipe -- it pretty much ruins it as a "sauce."  Use half of the 9.5 cups of water in the recipe.

This was just OK, way too watery for me. The flavor was acceptable, but there is no wow factor with this sauce. Frankly, I've had better spaghetti sauces from package mixes, such as Lawry's and McCormick.

It's a good basis for a recipe but you have to be careful because the portions are a little bit confusing with this one. I used less tomatoe pure and paste (little bit more then half compared to the recipe) and only used about 16 ounces of water. After adding the water I simmered it for an hour and it was done. I was also careful with the spices because I felt they are too much as well. It is a good frame but you need to know your stuff a little bit more because you can't just rely on these instructions. Thanks for the upload anyway.

I’ve made this recipe twice. The first time I followed it exactly, way too much water and olive oil. The second time I made it I completely left out the olive oil and the water. The second time it was perfect. The water and olive oil are totally unnecessary.

This is a delicious and easy sauce that I make often.  I like to use 1 # hot Italian sausage and 1# of sweet Italian sausage for more flavor and add 1/8 t of cayenne pepper for a little heat.

Awesome sauce!! This has deep rich flavor. I used a little more garlic (5 cloves) and used less water (54 ounces). 
I used this sauce for my baked eggplant parmesan and it was fabulous. The first time I made this with hamburger and mild Italian sausage and it was very nice. The 2nd time I made it with elk hamburger meat and it was amazing. Thank you for sharing this.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  Finally a sauce (gravy if you prefer) that my Italian husband LOVES!  The only change I made was to add 1/4 cup of sugar to sweeten it for the hubby. I was worried that the sauce would be too thin for him, but it thickened up nicely the next day. The taste was amazing!

Amazing sauce. I halved the water and only used 4 cups. After cooking the meat I put them in my instant pot and add the rest of the ingredients (tomato sauce and paste...etc) and cooked it on slow cooker setting on high for 6 hours.

Amazing flavor to this spaghetti sauce, however 76 oz of water was too much the first time,  it made it too thin for my taste.  I cut that in half and it was much better.

I have seen where people have said that this sauce has too much water. I used diced tomatoes in tomato puree (that's what I had) but I ran them through my processor to puree them. I only added 48oz of water instead of 76 and I let this cook down with the lid off for about 3-1/2 hours. It turned out amazing! Very rich and even though it looks thin, you can put a slotted spoon in it and it will not drip out of the spoon, so thick, too! I am not sure how it would have turned out with the full amount of water but with the 48oz, it came out perfect!

This recipe is amazing....the only thing I had to change was add more meat and an extra can of tomato paste. The first night I made it it was a very thin sauce with little meat. Although the flavor was delicious and over the top!! 
My family likes thicker and meatier sauce so I just fine tuned it to their liking...I highly recommend this recipe!

Great recipe....but one ingredient & quantity had me confused....the amount of water.  I made it exactly as directed, except for the water....I added only about a 1/2-3/4 of a cup oily...not the 9+ cups as indicated.  This was perfect for me as I like my spaghetti sauce to be rich and meaty (not runny).  Great flavor and rich & meaty.

This sauce was fantastic and easy to make. I followed others suggestions and used 3 large cans of tomato with 1 can of water. It would have been way too thin and watery with the 76 ounces of water and only 1 large can of tomato sauce. I used a really large onion and think that it needs to be a bit smaller (GI Upset for everyone who ate it). Add some red pepper flakes and it is perfect! Makes a huge pot! Great for a dense noodle. I will freeze the large remainder after eating noodles and sauce for 2 days and use it for lasagna in the future.

This is very good. But I am also very glad I read other reviewers. The butter adds a wonderful flavor, but it is more than enough. I did not add the oil. Sauteed the onion and garlic and then browned the meat. I used turkey and ground pork sausage because that is what I had. I also drained after the meat was browned. Very glad I did otherwise it would have been very greasy. I did three  8 oz tomato sauce instead of Puree. I also only did 1/2 cup of water. I would maybe go up to 1 cup,  but never the amount  of water listed; would have been way too watery.  I also added 8 oz of mushrooms. Put the whole thing in my crockpot for four hours on low.  My husband wished for more garlic, but otherwise really liked it.

I have been spent the past 20 years - yes 20  years - searching for the perfect spaghetti sauce. One with flavor, substance, and something that would make both my husband and I excited to be having spaghetti for dinner. 

This recipe is THE ONE!  I made a few adjustments, though. I added mushrooms, green, red, & yellow bell peppers, and bay leaves to the sauce. I used 2 of the smaller cans of tomato paste, 1 large can of crushed tomatoes, and 1 bottle of Spring water.  I let it all simmer on the stove top - uncovered - for 4-5 hours.  It turned out absolutely perfect! 

My husband couldn't get enough and actually asked to have some for lunch tomorrow!  He's NEVER asked for spaghetti for lunch the next day!  So I had to cook up another pot of pasta!  

The recipe made enough for our evening meal, 2 lunches for work the next day, and I still had enough sauce left to put in a 1 gallon Ziplock plastic bag to store in the freezer and it filled about 1/2 of that bag. 

Thanks for sharing this!  It really is a wonderful recipe!

If you like a thicker sauce....reduce the water by half. The flavor was great but it was far too much liquid for our liking.

I made this sauce for my wife on her birthday. My wife is a spaghetti fiend, and she was very impressed. I got major points, thank you very much. I like that the recipe was so simple. I did add a tablespoon of red pepper flakes for a little kick and a little more salt. I added water one can at a time and let simmer about 30 minutes in between each addition, in order to keep the consistency we like. I think I  ended up leaving out about 8 - 12 oz. in the end. I added black olives to mine and we both topped it with cilantro as always. All in all a really good, easy spaghetti sauce.

I made this exactly by the recipe except for using all ground beef and no sausage. The end result was absolutely delicious! However, I ended up simmering it for 5 1/2 hours uncovered in order to get it the right consistency. Two hours would not have been anywhere near enough time. If I make this again, I will add less water, hoping to simmer only a couple of hours as the recipe says.

I made this sauce twice and like it very much.  Since it makes a large amount, I froze it in containers.  When I thaw it out, the water separates and I have to drain it out.  It leaves me with only half of the amount of sauce.  Why doesn’t it freeze well?

Nope, as stated in many comments, way to much liquid. I didn't even add it all but was fully prepared to in case the other comments were wrong. Anyhow for all the effort it lacked taste & was to watery. Never will make again. No one liked it

I have tried many different recipes of homemade sauce.  This is the best sauce I have ever made.  My family begs me to make it so I can give them containers to take home. The secret is to simmer the sauce with the cover OFF.  The water evaporates leaving only the richness of the tomatoes.  Simmering the meat with all of the spices instead of adding spices to the sauce also adds to the flavor.  The only change I have ever made is to add a little more meat depending on the size of the packages available.  The is really a gem!

Wow, this is good! I used hot Italian sausage and added fresh basil. I used only half of the water since we like a thicker sauce. This will be made over and over again.

Made this several times now!! So so so good! Takes a bit of effort but well worth it. Makes a big batch, I usually have 2 extra bags worth that I freezer save and they taste just as good when I made it, yum!

My grandmother and mother are Italian, and, so, it would feel almost like  a sacrilege to five-star this sauce, but, having said that...I, verbally, give this sauce 5 stars.  This sauce is REALLY good!  I was VERY concerned about adding all that water, but since I know how annoying it is to read reviews of those who rate a totally amended version of the recipe, I followed it to the letter.  

While the sauce is somewhat thinner than a very-thick sauce, it is very nice;  even with the ground beef and sausage, it is like a beautiful, delicious marinara!  Will make again—next time, for our potluck after Holy Mass.

In making this wonderful Spaghetti sauce I pair a Chorizo sausage instead of a Kielbasa sausage with the hamburger.  Otherwise, I stayed with the recipe.  Great flavor and plenty to freeze some and have another portion for later.  I will make this again and share.

This is very similar to my wedding gift spaghetti sauce except mine uses I large can tomato juice, 2 cans tomato sauce and 2 cans tomato paste.  I do rinse out the cans with a little water.  I simmer for 3 hours.

Most flavorful source I’ve ever made. But glad I started it early in the day because it was too watery and I had to cook it down for 4 additional hours. If you don’t start early, reduce the water.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! I don't think I can eat sauce from a jar ever again...my daughter said the same thing. I will say, the first night, the sauce was a little more runny than I like (but still tasty), but the next day it was thick, wonderful, and tasted even better! I froze half and used the rest to make lasagna. Just the best!

I pretty much followed the recipe as written with a few exceptions: I used a pound of hamburger and a pound of mild sausage, I used fresh garlic, rosemary and oregano (instead of dried), I inadvertently forgot one can of the tomato puree in the pantry, and I only added 43oz of water. (Only because the 76 oz seemed like it would be a runny mess in my head) I put the whole thing in my crockpot and cooked it on low for 6 hours. This was my first time ever making spaghetti sauce from scratch and it turned out AMAZING!!! Made it for dinner for 4 people and had enough leftover to send for lunches and another dinner for 4. It was even better the second day!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Horrible! I am not much of a cook so I follow directions to the T. But even I kept questioning 76 ounces of water! I went ahead and did with the recipe called for....and ended up with red flavored water...I was very disappointed and wasted a lot of money! not happy at all!!!

Best spaghetti sauce I have ever tasted, have fed it to my entire family and most of my friends and they all ask for it when they come over for dinner.  I substituted 29 ounces of tomato sauce and subtracted 29 ounces of water, turns out perfect every time for those that like the sauce a little thicker.  5 stars.

I'd recommend cooking the beef first. Then use the hot olive oil to saute the onions and garlic, like 2 mins. Once they appear translucent add the beef, tomato sauces and herbs. Let simmer for about 15 minutes and boom perfect meat sauce with no burnt garlic or soggy onions.

After reading the reviews about the water, I used 2 12-oz cans of paste (instead of 3 6-oz cans) to give me a little more thickness.  I stuck with the 29 oz can of puree.  Then I waited to see what kind of water I should add.  I ended up using 4 1/2 cups (that's 36 oz, or half of what the recipe calls for).  I used fresh herbs from the garden and adjusted the salt while it was cooking. I found this to be a rather refreshing sauce.  It's very tomato-ey, which is good since it's a tomato sauce. The spices are not overwhelming.  Next time, I think I'll add half again as much meat of both the beef and sausage.  I also might add in some red pepper flakes and increase the fresh herbs.  Otherwise, this is a perfect sauce!  Just watch the water. Oh, and I might add that I have 5 2-serving containers in the freezer. Yep, this makes a LOT.

Once I cooked the meat with the herbs, I put it through the food processor.  Then put it all back in the pot and added the tomatoes but added only half the amount of water, adding more as needed.   It was an amazing sauce!

I used Italian sausage. Because of so much liquid, it had to simmer w/no cover for 5 hrs to thicken.  Probably won't make it again although when thickened, it was tasty.

It was really the best spaghetti sauce I ever made and really quite simple .  I had a little leftover caponata and added it to the sauce.

Very good. However I put meatballs in oven for 20 minutes before putting in the sauce.

Sorry...it didn't work for me. I followed the recipe exactly except cooked in the slow cooker for 5 hours instead of on the stove for 2. From the beginning it was soupy and bland. In the end, I added more salt and garlic and strained the meat out for the spaghetti.  I must have missed something since it was not a keeper at all.

This has been a top hit in my family! Everybody loves this pasta sauce, seriously, they could eat it every day and never get tired. Just don't add water! A thick consistency has better flavor and all the tomato has enough water, if anything, I won't add more than 2 cups of water to the mix.

Really really good! The only thing I didn't do was use nearly that much water. I used only a half a cup at most.

Outstanding Sauce. I let it cook several hours longer than recipe called for. I also recommend reducing the amount of water used. Other than that it's fantastic.

My family loved this sauce. I did double all the ingredients except for the water to create a thicker sauce. I also added a 1/2 c of brown sugar to cut the acid from the tomatoes. Made enough sauce for three pans of baked pasta!

This sauce is fantastic!!! My 22 year old son who is not crazy about red sauce, was eating it by itself in a small bowl. He was telling his friends how great it was and how great the house smelled. I made it as is, just doubled the spices and 1/2 mild & 1/2 hot sausage (that is just our taste). At dinner time I had both of my sons friends and girlfriends ready for dinner. The whole pot of sauce, 2 lbs of noodles, and 16 pieces of garlic bread later, it was gone. I got hugs and kisses the rest of the night. We all thought it was the best sauce ever!!! It will be "our" sauce from now on. Thank you so much.
