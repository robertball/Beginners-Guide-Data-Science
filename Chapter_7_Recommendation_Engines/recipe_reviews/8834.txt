This absolutely delicious!  Takes a little bit of time to make...but it is well worth the wait.

This was delicious. Living in an apartment I couldn't grill, so I cooked in the oven at 350 for about 50 minutes. Well, that was too long, probably about 40 mins would work. I also followed another review that suggested frying the onions, garlic, and peppers first. It was delicious, and easy enough to make. I will make again.

I used turkey bacon as well as turkey sausage rather than pork sausage and bacon.  It tasted great. This meal goes great with double baked potatoes.

really good meal idea.  just make sure you watch the grill all the time, the bacon grease catches on fire pretty easy.  also very filling.  great for the nights when you want something different.
my kids liked it too, which is great.

These were easy to make and delicious!  I substituted turkey bacon and added some chopped bell peppers (simply because I had some on hand that needed to be used).  I doubled the recipie to freeze them for lunches, and they reheat wonderfully.

Excellent recipe.  In order to make it 4 chicken breasts, I use 1 jalepeno, a 1/2 cup onion, and 8 slices of bacon.  Everything else I leave the same.  "Lil' Smokies" work well for the sausage.

This was very good. I ended up baking in a 350 degree oven for 50 mins elevated on a rack, and broiled for 5 mins to crisp up the bacon on top. The bacon was still softer than it would be on the grill, I may make in the oven again but think it's best suited for grilling as written. The two bacon slices to wrap the breast secured it really well. I added cheese inside, but it melted out: if you want cheese with it I'd suggest serving it shredded on top, almost like on a baked potato. The slight issue I have is with the chopped peppers/garlic/onions, I really feel the flavor and texture would improve if you give them a quick saute together and then put on. The bits are so protected by the bacon/chicken/sausage they crunch and taste like they are still raw. Thanks for sharing.

This was amazing!  All of my favorite flavors in one dish!  The only thing I found was that it took me longer then 30 minutes to get the chicken cooked all of the way through.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good indeed. I am from the Big Easy (New Orleans) and so to add my own cajun taste I made some adjustments to this recipe  to make it work for our taste buds. It came out AWESOME! 

My adjustments: 
For the pork sausage links I used Patton's Hot Sausage (I don't live in LA anymore, but get this sausage shipped from home all the time, no one else sells it and I've lived in 5 other major cities and haven't seen it).  

The sausage is hot so I didn't need the jalapenos. I omitted them. 

I opened the casing of the sausage and sauted them with the onion, garlic, some chopped green peppers, and green onions...and a chicken builloin cube. 

I seasoned the chicken with Zatarain's cajun seasoning and added the sausage mix, some monterey cheese, and crumbled bacon to the inside of the chicken breast. 

Wrapped the chicken with remaining bacon and put extra stuffing in the pan and baked it on 375 for 30 minutes. This was awesome. Served with some broccoli cheese and rice casserole. YUM

This was a hit at dinner last night. My family doesn't care for sausage so I substituted cream cheese. Baked at 350 for about 50 minutes. Delicious

A perfect tender and juicy chicken breast. I used a whole jalapeno and sausage with diced red onions. A true spicy delight. I use an instant read thermometer to check for doneness in order not to over or under cook these.
