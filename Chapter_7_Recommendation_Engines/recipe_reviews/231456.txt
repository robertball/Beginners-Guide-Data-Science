My "go to" dessert recipe for company. Easier than it looks and always impresses with it's presentation and flavor.

I loved making this recipe.  It turned out exactly as the recipe says.  Great use of all the rhubarb in my yard!

Simple recipe that does the job - great feedback from tasters. One thing I would encourage is doubling the amount of fruit to 4 cups for the filling. Since I had two pie crusts, I doubled it but the filling was *still* only enough for one galette.
