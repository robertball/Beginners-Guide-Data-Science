I had just a small amount of duck fat I had been hoarding and this was was a great way to use it.  Is duck fat necessary?  No, but it adds just that  little extra bit of flavor.  Thanks, Chef John!

We had barbecued a goose (!!) and I rendered the goose fat, so I used that instead. Iâ€™m also a tad adventurous with spices, so in addition to the standard salt/pepper/cayenne, I used ground Szechuan peppercorns and a hint of cumin. The hot oven is really worthwhile. They were crispy and delicious. Definitely hit a more interesting note than business as usual.

We had just made some bacon...delicious local smoked bacon! So I used the fat from that instead of duck fat. Yum

This was one of the best things that has ever come out of my kitchen. It really was good room temp like Chef John says. As with all of my recipes I have made of his, I trust blindly 100% in his measurements, and it came out amazing (and it was Thanksgiving)! I mixed all of the ingredients in a ziploc bag to thoroughly cover.  I also used store bought duck fat from a specialty food market. 5 Stars! Thank you!

This is good!  Duck fat is one of my new favorite things and luckily they sell it at a new high end store by me, since I have never cooked with duck to get the fat :)  I was not able to cook the sprout at 450 because I had something else in the oven as well.  Still turned out good, but will try at the higher temp. to see if I get them a little crispier.  Thanks once again Chef John!!

They came out perfect, and were the best version of roasted brussel sprouts I've tried. This is probably be my go-to version.

turned out very well, used olive oil instead of duck fat.

I made a duck for thanksgiving and used the fat for these Brussels sprouts. My husband and I loved them. Such a simple recipe but the duck fat makes them taste gourmet.

I am a Chef John fan, but this one was just OK. I make roast Brussie's all the time and these were not special.

Tasty, but not terribly distinctive, the duck fat notwithstanding.  I personally like the flavor of onions and butter with sprouts.

A good recipe, but probably not different with duck fat than butter.
