I made these for Halloween and everyone loved them. One thing I would change. I put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes before cutting them. It made it so much easier to slice.

Loved this recipe. Instead of ranch dressing I used cream cheese with chive and onion. yummy. I took these to a birthday party and everyone asked for the recipe.

These were very yummy, my only problem was getting them off the foil.  Probably won't use foil next time.

Easy to make and a great snack.  Used herb and garlic spread rather than ranch dressing.  Definitely use real bacon crumbles.

Easy, low cost, and oh-so yummy!  I made these for a football party and they were gone in 60 seconds. Everyone raved over them.  Definately put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes before you try to cut them or you will have a big mess.

This recipe was very easy to make and was so good!  Like some of the others that left reviews I too added more bacon and it was fabulous!

Super good! Couldn't figure out how to roll it up, so it ended up being more of a pizza thing. I also added some shredded chicken, to make it more meal-like. Also, I used peppercorn ranch, and brown sugar bacon. so yummy! Was gone in a few minutes flat!

Yum! I added a little bit more bacon. They are very good! Next time I will probably do double the amount of ranch... but they are very good and very easy to make!

Excellent items. I actually added a little more bacon and cheese (how can you go wrong with that) and they were delicious.

Ok, maybe it's me, but the instructions for rolling out the crescent rolls was disastrous.  If you make two long rectangles out of 1 tube of dough, it's impossible to get 8 slices by rolling from the short side.

I made these for a family potluck get together, and they went FAST!  I used the recipe exactly as shown.  However, slicing was an issue.  I guess chilling the dough would definitely help.  I ended up using a piece of string and 'scissored' them like when making cinnamon buns which I will probably do again.   I'm making a triple batch this weekend for another get together, can't wait!!

Mmmmm! These are great with more cheese and bacon. I used chive & onion cream cheese instead of ranch and just spread a thin layer on. It probably amounted to 3-4 TBSP (I didnt measure) Went soo well with our cheesy potato soup at lunch today!! Definitely stick in the freezer for 15 or so minutes prior to attempting to slice! This one's a keeper!

Well, mine sure didn't look like the picture but they were very good.  They rolled theirs from the short side and I made mine from the long side.  Now I think I know how to do it from looking at the picture again.  Anyway, the flavor was very mild and that was what I was looking for.  Thanks for posting.

Super tasty and kinda fun to make.  Definitely easier to pop them in the freezer before trying to slice them.  Can't wait to try variations on the "stuffing".

These were very good. I made a double batch as a party take-a-long. I think everybody liked them, as they were gone pretty quickly. 
I only did two changes- I sprinkled on about 1/3 cup total finely minced leftover ham with the cheese. (A very good addition, by the way! I think it made the difference between this recipe being just good and REALLY good.) We find that cooking crescents to browning always makes them taste burnt to us, so we only baked them just through so they were still soft all around. They were good hot AND cold later from the buffet.
I also used a ruler to measure the size, and rolled and folded the dough between two sheets of waxed paper, to the correct size listed. This helped significantly to make the cut lines disappear, and made the dough much easier to handle later for rolling up.
I used a very sharp knife to cut them right away, and had no issues.
Next time, I will add just a little bit, not a lot, more dressing and cheese.

I followed the recipe, using advice from a reviewer to use onion and chive flavored cream cheese instead of the dressing.  They tasted really good, but by the time I got them prepared, the dough warmed up, making them a nightmare to cut.  The finished product wasn't pretty, but tasted good!  I recommend putting in the freezer for a few minutes before cutting.  Otherwise, really good!

These were not inedible, but they were not fantastic either. The ranch flavor is non-existant. They were very dry. I see that some people used the chive flavored cream cheese, that may help the flavor some. Won't make these again.

My boyfriend made he followed the recipe as it was written.  They were very dry, they'd be good to use if ther was something to dip them in, or if there was cream cheese or more dressing for the filling.

Delicious!  Double the ranch dressing, add more bacon and cheese, and definitely put in the freezer for 15 minutes or else you will be in for a treat trying to cut the rolls.

Used onion & chive cream cheese instead of ranch since husband doesn't like ranch.  Everyone loved it.  Eat it while it's hot as it is not as good once cold.

These were alright. I used cream cheese instead of ranch dressing. These were good when they were hot but when they cooled down they were not as good. I would make these again though, just not as many.

Make SURE you press the cresent rolls together to make a single sheet before you begin. I didn't do it perfectly and it became a huge mess. However, even though they weren't perfect pinwheels they still tasted delicious!

Very good. I made this for a family get together and everybody loved them. I made some with and some without green onions for the pickier members of my family, and I also used some garlic butter flavored crescent rolls that added more flavor. Will be making this again in a few days for Christmas.

Followed the recipe verbatim- quick and easy, great for a weeknight with soup on the side. They were good but not 5-star good, maybe with some tweaks ;)  Thanks for a great idea, we enjoyed!

I love this recipe!!  I tried it with minced jalapenos instead of green onions for a kick and it was delicious.  I'm going to keep experimenting with different cheeses and perhaps a breakfast-version with sausage, egg, and hashbrown.  This has so many possibilities!

Made as directed for the kids...for the adults I chopped up some jalapenos for an added kick.  They were a sensation.  :)

These are good, not fantastic. Next time I'll use more cheese and use minced ham instead of bacon.

Hosted a 'movie night' last weekend that included heavy hors d'oeuvres and peach bellinis. Each guest brought an appetizer type dish. I prepared these and a few other things and have to say as simple as this dish is, it was the first platter empty. Got several requests for the recipe. The only subsitution I made was to spread savory chive cream cheese on the crescent dough instead of Ranch Dressing. A tip from another review made cutting these a cinch. After rolling up, put in the freezer for about 15 minutes and then cut with a bread knife. Perfect results! Try these, and I am sure you'll agree that for such little effort, the resulting dish is incredibly tasty. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Oh my gosh these were so easy to make and so delicious! The only thing I did different was spread cream cheese on the crescent dough before adding the rest of the ingredients. It was a hit for breakfast!!!

This is always a huge hit! I use 2x the green onions and I buy bacon from a local butcher and make my own bacon bits. I have also used dijon mustard and sage sausage as a filling as well so I'm not always serving the same thing.

SO good!  Mine did not turn out beautiful as the perforations kept popping apart, which made it difficult to roll these tightly.  But regardless, they were FABULOUS!  I used 8 slices of turkey bacon and omitted the onion.

To me personally, these were just so-so.  However, many people at the event for which these were prepared raved about them!  I guess I was expecting more flavor.  They looked nice and were easy enough to make.  I added a tad bit more cheese and bacon.  Definitely stick the rolls in the freezer a bit before attempting to cut them.  I will make them again, but will either use more ranch or cream cheese instead of the ranch.  I need to figure out something to give these a little more of a "kick".  Perhaps I will come up with a dipping sauce of some sort for these.

If I make these again I would consider adding something to them. The 'ranch' flavor wasn't as strong as I would have liked it to have been even though I used the proper amount. This recipe was just okay.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were ok at best. My husband will eat anything in the world and he didn't like them. My two toddlers wouldn't eat more than a few bites of one. We will not be making them again. Thanks though :)

These were messy to make. The crescent roll dough didn't seal well and was floppy and hard to roll up. In the end, we just made them into regular triangles. The ingredients inside were good, but no rocket science--the scallion/bacon/cheese combo is pretty normal. Good but messy and not very impressive :(

Realy easy and tasty!  I put the rolls back in the fridge for about an hour before cutting them.

Next time I'm going to set some ranch out for dipping!

I just made a batch of these and omg...they are fantastic!!! I used cream cheese mixed with the dry ranch seasoning instead of a liquid ranch dressing because thats what I had on hand. Also, I didn't have green onion so I used a vedalia onion. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and put them in the freezer for 15 minutes before slicing and they sliced nicely. I will definitely make these for our next party...YUM!!!! A KEEPER.Thank you for sharing.

I made these for a meeting last night and they were yummy!  I used the reduced fat crescent rolls, and I think that using the regular ones would've been easier to work with.  They gave me some trouble rolling up and such, but they still tasted good.

These are so good and to go way too fast. I have made them with and without the Ranch dressing and they are great either way.

Great recipe! Made this for Thanksgiving and the kids loved it. Instead of pre-made bacon bits, I made my own, frying up the bacon with some green onions. I'll definitely be making this again.

Update: I made this with crescent rolls and it worked out great in a pinch!

This is a great snack. We even made them for dinner by spreading refried beans on the crescent roll rectangles and then sprinkled cheese and taco meat. After they baked we topped them with salsa and sour cream - WOW, they were great!  We're going to make them again for Christmas Eve and try another alteration by making them with cheese and browned sausage - sort of an easy "sausage ball."

These are pretty good.  No one was blown away by them, but they have a basic taste that most people would like fine as an appetizer.  I added more ranch, but the crescent roll itself was still the dominant flavor.

I made these for my annual Christmas Eve drop in, and everyone raved over them.  I used the seamless dough sheets, and I also fried thick sliced bacon and chopped it up, instead of using the packaged bacon pieces.

These were good, but I will make one without the green onion the next time.  I think my oven shut off at some point because they did not rise correctly.  I will definitely try again.

They were good, but need to be served right away and put in freezer for 5-10 mins before trying to cut as the dough is sticky.

Just made these for a football game and my husband and daughter adored them. I did add a little extra bacon and cheddar. I must say, if I was rating from my opinion alone, I would give them only 3 stars. The crescent roll taste can be overpowering in my personal opinion, but the rest of my family strongly disagrees with me. I think my taste is just a little more sophisticated than my husband and daughter:)

I made these to take to my parents' for Thanksgiving. We always have the same old appetizers, so I figured I'd give these a try for something new! I used the Lay's ranch dressing in a jar, because I thought the thicker consistency would be great for these (and it tastes amazing). I also used reduced fat cheese, and made my own bacon bits from fresh bacon from the deli. Four or five strips is plenty for this recipe. Also, I didn't have any green onions on hand, so I sprinkled a little garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper on top of everything. Came out great, tasty and made my whole apartment smell wonderful! Great for a quick, easy app or even a fancier hors d'ouevre. Wonderful!

I tried these out last night before the holidays.  They were wonderful!  A very nice warm appetizer or I served them as "bread" with my chicken & wild rice casserole.  I'm seeing these at superbowl most definately this year!  Only problem.....i think they are better served warm...........so i suppose putting them in a warming roaster pan or something would work for parties.....regardless they were yummy!

Very cute but tasted okay. My kiddo loved it though. I also have to agree with 'paxerit' about the crescent taste dominating the flavor. To get more pieces, I rolled it the long side.

It's sort of hard for this recipe to taste bad with such few ingredients. But, having said that - My family is not a fan of bacon but these were a huge hit! They were devoured before all the other appetizers. Made on Thanksgiving and plan to make again in the future. If you're looking for a simple yet tasty appetizer..this is it!

Easy and looks fancy!  Rolling them out on a silicone mat made them easy to roll without sticking everywhere.  I froze the roll for about 15 minutes before cutting, as another reviewer suggested, and it did make them much easier to slice.

These were great!! I used a little more bacon than the recipe called for because my boyfriend loves bacon more than he probably loves me. But one thing I did discover the second batch I made (he and his friends destroyed the first batch in like 3 minutes and demanded more) was that they sliced a lot better if I refrigerated them after I rolled them up. I put all the toppings on, rolled it up, sealed the edges, and refrigerated them for about 20-30 minutes until they were pretty cold and had firmed up a little more. I used a serrated knife to kind of saw them into the slices and it was much easier than the first round that I just cut right away after rolling. And that batch turned out nicer looking because they stayed together nicely upon cutting. SO YUMMY!!

This was a nice change from a traditiona roll at our Thanksgiving table.  We followed the recipe exactly, only used the ranch dressing with bacon for a little more bacon-flavor..   Overall assessment is that these are easy and tasty, but not anything stunning.

These were quite good, but didn't rise much.  I liked the suggestion I read about freezing them for a short while before slicing....I'm sure it would of made the task much easier.

I made one roll as stated and the other roll with pepperoni, ranch and cheese since I didn't have enough bacon. Delicious. No leftovers here. Making for turkey day too.

This is great!!!  I must admit that I did not have any crescent roll dough on hand, so I made some dinner roll dough in my bread machine, and it worked great!  This is such a versatile idea and can be used in many different ways - marinara, pepperoni & mozzarella for pizza pinwheels; bacon, egg and cheese pinwheels, etc.  Thanks for the idea!!!

Used cream cheese with added seasoning instead of ranch dressing.  Added chopped ham instead of bacon.  Delicious with cream cheese.

I followed the recipe, using a little more cheese and bacon. They were pretty bland. Maybe some minced garlic would help?

These are delicious, easy, and very filling. I personally think it's better with more green onion than the recipe calls for, but other than that, it's delicious. Just make sure you remove them quickly from the hot pan when they come out.

Great starter recipe! I made pinwheels based on this recipe for a potluck this last weekend. Used my pizza dough (4 cups flour) and divided in half after the it doubled in size and punched down. Spread the dough out on the bread board as far as I could get it to go (about 20x8 or so) and then spread mixture on the dough leaving about 1" or so along the top edge (longest side). I rolled starting with the longest side so the finished pinwheel could be sealed. wasn't too big. (I wanted more of an appetizer size) I also used 1/2c bacon, a vary generous heaping 1/2c of sharp cheddar and just enough ranch dressing (about 3T or so) to hold it together to spread. I did this mixture for both halves of the dough. After each was rolled up I cut them about 1" thick and placed them on parchment with about a 2" separation and let them rise the second time for about 20 or so minutes. Backed at 400* for about 13 minutes or until just getting golden brown on the edges. These tasted great and went over big at the potluck. These would be great to make up and freeze for a quick snack!

These were good but not great.  If I make them again, I will add more bacon and possibly a flavored cream cheese in place of ranch dressing.

I decided to use up some leftover Alfredo sauce instead of ranch dressing. Tasty!

Yummy! A hit with my family. They look harder to make than they really are and they look very appetizing! I'll try glazing them with egg whites next time I make them to see if if I can get a nice golden brown color.

These were pleasantly delightful!  Planning on making them again for Thanksgiving and Christmas for appetizers.  We made them exactly according to the recipe only we put them in the freezer for 20 min before cutting.  Turned out to be a great mother-daughter treat in the kitchen!

These were a fun alternative to traditional dinner rolls- and were a huge hit. I used cream cheese and real bacon pieces for the filling- and in about 1/2 of them added green onions as well. Not an overly strong flavor of bacon, cheese or green onions- just a nice touch of each to make them yummy!

Instead of putting these out as an appetizer, I served them as the bread portion of the meal.  Everyone really enjoyed them.  Two suggestions; make sure your bacon is diced really small and make sure your dough is sufficiently chilled.  Makes for easier cutting.

These were very disappointing.  I added extra cheese and bacon as suggested, but they were still very bland and tasted too "bready" according to the kids.  Also, very difficult to cut as the dough was getting warm.

This was a simple and yummy recipe.  As I pulled these out of the oven my son and his friends walked in.  One asked if they were mini cinnamon rolls...Hmmm, I thought this could easily be converted by changing the middle incredients to butter and cinnamon.  I may try this.   I paired the bacon cheddar pinwheels with the Cream of Celery Soup (Wonderfalk) and had a nice light dinner last night.

I cooked these last nite for my husband & he loved them. We had them for dinner then rewarm for breakfast. I used my favorite dressing,precooked chicken,bacon,onions,& cheese. Use what you like. The dressing is what add the most flavor. WE LOVED THEM!!! May want to watch video 1st to make sure you make them right...you got to love when a recipe comes with a video. Freeze before you cut or they will fall apart.
