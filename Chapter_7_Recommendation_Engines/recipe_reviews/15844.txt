Make sure you spread the cream cheese across the platter.  It is absolutely wonderful and I had no leftovers!

Add a little chopped fresh cilantro for a festive look and a nice zippy flavor.  Very good with low fat cream cheese.

This is a quick and easy dip recipe if you are short on time.  The last time I made it, I used wasabi cocktail sauce, and the kick really blended well with the cream cheese.  Sometimes I use neufchatel cheese, for a lower fat option.

So good! Who would think such simple flavors work so well together! I used the tiny salad shrimp when I made it and it worked just fine.

Great recipe that I've made for years, except our family uses Chili Sauce instead of the Cocktail.  Super easy and super yummy!

My family has loved this for years.  I make it just as this recipe reads and it's always gone quickly.  Many parties with lots of people have proven this to be a hit with most people.  I've not used the lime before, but am going to add that to our Christmas Eve party.  Thanks for posting!

This recipe is AWEOME! Such a simple to make appetizer. I used a can of tiny shrimp & mixed it with the cocktail sauce. It was delish. Gone in no time at all. I will be anxious to try it with small fresh shrimp. Give this one a try..thanks for such a great, simple recipe. Loved it...

this recipe has been in my family for years! As an adult I make it at every party I go to and people love it.  I make it by spreading cream cheese, spreading cocktail sauce then layering shrimp on top.  It's a great unique dish to bring to a party.

I wasn't that impressed.  I think it needs something?  Too plain for me.  If you decide to make, be sure to use the brand cocktail sauce.
