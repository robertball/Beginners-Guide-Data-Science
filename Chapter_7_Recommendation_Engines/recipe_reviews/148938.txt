This wasn't bad but you really need to play around with the spices to get it how you like it. For people not used to this kind of food, I suggest adding a little at a time, and taste - alot of Indian spices are a real acquired taste. I personally added way more garlic, and also some Patak's garlic chutney. It was good but not something I would make again.

As-is, this is a solid base recipe for easy keema. I made it with Patak's mild curry paste and it tasted alright before I started adding more spices, much better after following some commenters' advice and poking around to see what the more elaborate keema recipes recommend. I added cumin, garam masala, chili powder (I like it spicy), and cinnamon a little at a time, to taste. The cinnamon was the MVP, it smelled heavenly and tasted great! The only change I'll make for round two - I like a more finely ground lamb than what I got from my local Kroger. Will go to a butcher next time around to get the consistency right.

This was tasty and satisfying, but as another reviewer noted, it's missing something. My grocery store was out of the mild curry paste, so I used the hot one - not really that spicy to my palate, but it did add a little zesty note. I also used three cloves of garlic - one clove is NEVER enough, lol. I will save this one and tweak it more to our tastes.

I really liked it but I think I'll either use less tomato paste or chopped fresh tomatoes next time also green curry paste instead of red curry paste. Great easy recipe!
