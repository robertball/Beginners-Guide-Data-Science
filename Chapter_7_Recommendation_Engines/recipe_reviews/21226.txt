A quick and easy Catfish stew!  For a fresher taste, I have adapted the recipe, but only slightly. I use catfish nuggets and Ro-Tel tomatoes. I use fresh celery, onion, garlic clove, a strip of lemon peel and fresh thyme, when available.  I use hot pepper flakes, instead of hot pepper sauce, and no salt.  Diners are able to add salt, or not, to their own taste.

Easy and fast! Tasted wonderful, will be making again. I added red pepper flakes and used diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil. Added okra too. It was fabulous.

Well, I guess I've never tasted the original recipe. But this sounded good, so I tried it. It was very fishy & nobody would eat it, including me. Sorry to say I wasted alot of money & alot of catfish, only to throw it down the drain.

I used Basa instead of US catfish, minced garlic instead of powder, and omited the onions.  Turned out fabulous.  Excellent flavor!!  This will be used again and again in my house!

This recipe was wonderful.  Really easy and the catfish was tender and delicious.  I have a rice cooker and so simmered the tomatoes etc until the rice was done then added the fish to the pan.  The seasoning melded together very well.

This recipe is so easy and fast.  I used tomatoes with jalapenos already in it and deleted the hot sauce.  My husband loved it and so did I.

Changed this a bit, very good outcome. First off, if you don't 'love' fishiness in your whole recipe, fry your fish separately. I rubbed my fish with oil then garlic powder, salt and old bay seasoning and fried a few minutes per side on my cast iron griddle. For the tomato part I chopped up 2 cups fresh tomatoes, frying them lightly in a saucepan, added the seasonings mentioned ( a little more generous on the garlic and oregano doesn't hurt). I couldn't taste a bite with the amount of hot sauce either, so tweak that at the end if needed. I let the tomatoes simmer on low with a cover for 10 min then mashed them in the pan with a potato masher, and added some chopped olives. I served the fish over rice, with the sauce over the top. This tasted very Mediterranean to me, have no idea if it's authentic creole or not. But I really enjoyed this, and that's coming from someone who can't eat fish very well unless its deep fried. A simple, fast, tasty keeper!

This recipe was a little bland and needs some salt, but it was very good for a quick, light dinner.  I will probably make this again sometime.

I tried this recipe out and my bf who isnt a big fan of catfish liked it a lot.  I liked it as well.  The only reason why I didnt give it a five star was because it was still a little to fishy.  It has a very strong taste, good but strong.  I might try this recipe out again but with tilapia.

This was an awesome low calorie delicious recipe that my family loves.  I used tilapia when I did not have catfish and added shrimp and it doubled the deliciousness of it.  I come to this site regularly to get new recipes and this has been the best so far!

Fast, easy, healthy, and delicious!  What more could one want? It had a richer flavor that the ingredients would indicate and the catfish tasted somewhat like chunks of shrimp or crab. I used a can of diced no-salt tomatoes and  a low sodium liquid bouillon so added a bit more of the seasonings than called for. It was delicious and we will be having this regularly.  Thanks for sharing this Dakota.

I used all the ingredients as called for except long grain rice. I ended up using spanish rice and prepared as package suggested. Still adding the seasoning and this turned out great. Thank you so much for the recipe and will definetly make again.

I didn't have everything on hand to make it as written, so I subbed chopped fresh tomatoes & small amt double concentrated paste for the canned. I also added thyme & chopped celery, as another reviewer suggested. It's true that I strayed a good deal from the written recipe, but I do believe a good recipe allows room for adjustment - according to tastes & what one has on hand. Thanks for a quick, easy & very good recipe! It's a keeper!

An incredibly simple & lovely fish stew. I did a little twist by substituting oregano with thyme leaves as I just ran out of it. And it turned out beautifully.

I've made this several times now, and it always turns out great. I make it just as the recipe says except that I use tilapia instead of catfish. The flavors blend wonderfully, and it goes great over rice. Even my 3-year-old will eat it. Yum!

i decided that one can of tomatos wasnt enough, so i added about 3/4 of another and it was just enough, so i also added more seasonings, it was good but the amount of hot sauce didnt make the whole dish spicy so we added to our bowls

Not a bad quick meal.  I tweaked it by giving some diced onion and celery in some e.v.o.o. a quick saute.  Added some chopped garlic instead of powder, a dash of cayenne, a splash of lemon juice, and two boullion cubes.
I wouldn't say this would feed a family of four, maybe 3 if you have only one serving each.  No fishy taste at all, "used fresh frozen" catfish nuggets instead of fillets.  I enjoyed it, let's hope my picky husband does as well.

This was pretty good. The only change I made was to add a lot more hot sauce to make it more creole and less like fish marinara. Next time I would add some veggies, maybe celery and okra? I loved how fast and easy this was after a  long day.

I loved it.  Regarding former reviews, I left the salt out.  My kids didn't want any extra, so kudos for them!

I added 1 can of Rotel and 1/4 of a fresh green bell pepper with some creole seasoning. My wife and I love it. But we really like spicy food so this was right up our alley. Great recipe for catfish.

This was tasty, although it really needed salt, and due to the varying tastes of family members, I did not put the hot sauce in while it was cooking, but on the table to be used as desired. It is another handy way to cook catfish.

This was very easy and tasty. I did use real onion and celery as another member suggested. I also added two chopped chile serranos to add a little kick.

Sorry!  My husband took 3 bites and said he couldn't eat it.  Just tasted fishy to him.  I ate it, and had more the next day for lunch.  I think the flavors blend a little after it sits, but I'm not going to get through the whole pan of leftovers!

Had more fish, so nearly doubled the tomatoes.  Used one can with jalapenos, too.  Eyeballed the rest of the ingredients and it was a hit.

This was pretty good for a really quick weekday meal, but definitely needed some "doctoring" as some of the other reviewers mentioned.  I used sauteed onion, garlic, (and also celery) rather than using the minced dried stuff.  I added some cayenne pepper and went heavy on the hot sauce, but found it still needed a few splashes more for serving.  The fish stays really  moist and tender...a definite "plus" for this recipe!  Will make this again and play around with it some more.

This was just ok.  It was good, but nothing that wowed us.  I would also give a 3.5 as its not terrible, but not a 4 for us.

Really, more of a 3.5 star.  This was pretty good, though hubby liked it better then I.  Used catfish nuggets and added some frozen mixed veggies to the stew and it was tasty.

I substituted 4 tomatillos for the tomatoes, because that's what I had on hand. It was a very good easy recipe. If it tastes too fishy, you probably need fresher fish...
