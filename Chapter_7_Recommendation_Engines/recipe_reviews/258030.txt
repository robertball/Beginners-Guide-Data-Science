I have used this sauce with many types of proteins/pasta and it is still one of my favorites. So easy, and there are never leftovers!

This was excellent! Made as written and I wouldn't change a thing. I only had raw shrimp on hand so to cook them prior to adding them to the rest of the dish I simply sauteed them in a skillet with a little bit of oil for a few minutes. This one is sure to impress who you serve it to.

Loved it! I did things a little different because I was using what I had on hand. I used diced tomato, grated Parmesan cheese from a bottle and shrimp that I had just peeled. One thing I did was cut the shrimp into bite size chunks and I dropped it into the boiling water for the pasta for about 45 seconds, then I put it off to the side until I was ready to use it in the sauce. Also, I used Moscato instead of regular white wine. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe!

Used regular pasta cooked el dente instead and thought it tasted great. Will be on our regular weeknight menu because it is quick and easy.
