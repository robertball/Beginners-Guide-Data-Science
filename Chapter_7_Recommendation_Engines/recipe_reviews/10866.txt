I gave this one three stars because it was a 50/50 for the people I served them to. I personally wasn't crazy about them, but some people really liked them in the end. It must be an acquired taste - almost everyone's first reaction was, "these are okay," and then they'd finish the cookie and say, "they're growing on me." Half the people continued to pick them up and after three or four cookies I was hearing, "you know, these are pretty addictive - I think I really like them because they're just so different!" The flavor definitely evolves from the first moment you put them in your mouth, to the aftertaste. I really liked the aftertaste, but I didn't like the initial taste. If I make these again, I think I'll decrease the sugar by about 2 tablespoons and see how that goes.

This recipe caught my attention because it was so different. The taste makes it a keeper! It was quick to make, and while the taste is not your typical cookie taste-it's different and I think better.
Wish I could describe the taste for you, but, I think this is one cookie recipe that if you think it sounds good, you should follow your hunch and give it a try.  Enjoy.
