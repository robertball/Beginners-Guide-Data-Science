I loved this. The only thing I did differently was to cook it all in the crock pot and it was delicious!  The meat got really tender and the flavor was great.

I made this dish last night and it was pretty good. Neither my daughter or I had ever had Swiss Steak but it is something that my hubby had once and requested I master (LOL). I made both noodles and mashed potatoes to see which we liked better and they both liked the noodles better but I didn't care either way.

Here are the ways I changed it up though, and it worked for us...

I deglazed the pan after browning the meat with beef broth and added about 1 cup because my hubby always likes extra "sauce". It was still really skimpy on sauce and I started to worry about the tomato to beef flavor ratio so I added 1 - 15 oz can of tomato sauce. It turned out great and my hubby and DD requested to have it again soon! :o)

This was a great recipe for Swiss Steak.  I love cooking with wine, so I added 1/2 cup of Burgundy and thought it added a lot.  Also, I had to simmer mine for just over an hour until the meat was tender. Throw this on some mashed potatoes and you have an awesome comfort dinner.

Easy and delicious. One of those "stuff your face until you pop" meals. I make homemade mashed potatoes instead of noodles and make a pile on the plate, stack the steak on top and then pour the gravy over. Fantastic!

This had great flavor and was easy to prepare. It has a real comfort food feel. I made it on a weeknight after work, and we still ate at a reasonable time! I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed because it's what I had in the pantry. My husband kept saying "this is really good..." while he ate :)

Yum!  So easy, too.  I put this in my crockpot / slow cooker for 9 hours on low.  Came out perfectly tender.  I did add onion powder and garlic powder.  Will definitely make this again.

This one's good. I made it one night right before we left for hockey and let it simmer for about 90 minutes on low.  We returned home to the wonderful aroma, made some noodles, and devoured it!  But the best part about it was the leftovers........um!  I had it for lunch the next three or so days and it was fantastic.

I put all the ingredients in my crock pot. It turned out very good. I served it over rice. I just wish the sauce were more like gravy - it was very soupy.

We loved this recipe! I didn't use the onion since my husband doesn't like onions, I used a little onion and garlic powder. I cooked it in my slow cooker on low for 9 hours. The meat was very tender.I served it over bow tie pasta.

My family thought this was just ok. If I were to make it again I would add a chopped bell pepper, a little soy sauce and maybe half a packet of onion soup mix.

I made this with ground beef and seasoned it liberally with Lowry's seasoned salt. It was it hit! I think my family liked it better than anything I've made in a long time. Really, really good.

Not like my mom used to make at all. Kids and husband ate it, but I guess they were expecting something different. Kind of looked like a mess on the plate. I did try this twice and had the same results, which is sad because usually swiss steak is easier.

Excellent.  I did add seasoned salt to the flour before dredging.  Other than that followed to a "T".  

Good flavor, cube steak was quite tender.  Served with Mashed Potatoes instead of egg noodles.

Thanks for a good recipe!

I made this last night for dinner, and used venison cube steak instead of beef.  I also used canned mushrooms (all I had).  Cooked it in the slower cooker and served it over brown rice.  Very tasty and very filling.  Since I used venison, it was very low fat also.

This was a pretty delicious dinner. I only used 1 can of diced tomatoes (my family members are not huge tomato fans at all) and then supplemented w/ filling the now-empty can (from the tomatoes) with tomato juice & then rinsing the can w/ about 1/3 full of water & added that to the mix. Everyone loved this dinner. I'm also saving it for my niece who is newly married & on the lookout for recipes to fill out her bag of tricks with.

Seared the cubed steaks. Put them in the crockpot with the onion, salt/pepper, gravy mix, stewed toms. Left out the mushrooms (not a fave). Left it in the crockpit for 3 hours on high and then on low until dinner time. Served it with Idahoan mashed potatoes, roasted brussel sprouts and Sister Shubert's yeast rolls. To die for...

Everyone loved this!  I only used 2 cube steaks, and left out mushrooms.  Used onion powder instead of onion.  Ended up simmering for maybe 45-50 minutes because I got distracted.
ETA:  I made a second time with only one can of stewed tomatoes, and one diced.  Added some celery flakes and fresh chopped green pepper.  The pepper was not as tender as hoped (put in with the meat and sauteed) but it definitely helped reduce the salty taste and was still well received!

This was really good!  I did not have brown gravy mix so I just used beef broth and flour to make a gravy.  I also used top round London broil/ steak.  I did brown the meat first and then cooked it in the crock.  I always find the meat is tastier and not as tough when you brown it first.  Next time I'm going to add carrots and green beans to make it a one dish meal!

Very delicious. Similar to beef stew. The meat comes out very tender, and it is easy enough for my husband to make! I didn't bother to brown the meat because I was throwing it together in a crockpot at 7:30am. It was still amazing anyway.

This was easy as promised and tasted great. I also used about a 1/4 cup of cabernet sauvingon wine to deglaze and then 1/2 cup more while it was simmering which really added some depth. The brown gravy mixes were .87 ounces (couldn't find the 1.2 oz bags) so I just used 1 bag and it was fine with a little bit of salt.  Definitely comforting and it would be awesome on top of mashed potatoes as others have mentioned.  Didn't' use the cube steaks as had a round steak roast on hand - that came out tough, so if I am stuck with that again, might throw it all in the slow cooker (with the onions towards the end).  So glad I found this recipe!

This was so easy and amazing.  I added some read wine to deglaze my pan and the family raved.  Great addition to any meal plan.  Quick, easy and no one would know it didnt take you hours.

This was so easy!  I did not season the meat because the brown gravy and stewed tomatoes pack a lot of sodium.  I cannot say it enough...easy, easy easy!

This dish was delicious - wouldn't change a thing. My husband and I do not mind leftovers, and so re-heated the next night - tasted just great. The swiss steak is going into My Recipe Box and will definitely make again!

Yummy!  I cooked the mushrooms and onions first, then added the steak and browned it.  Didn't use flour so I added two packets of brown gravy instead of one.  I loved it, my 10 year old gobbled it up, my 11 year old picked but really liked the noodles.  He doesn't like anything, so I don't rely on his vote...  I made peas and corn separately on the side (picky boys) and mixed them in with mine.  I think I'll add them next time!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

The mushrooms and onions were a little overwhelming so I reduced it my second time making it. It's a family favorite but we prefer serving it with rice instead of egg noodles.

I really liked this. We are on a TIGHT budget right now so I was looking for a good cube steak recipe. I don't believe I changed anything besides adding a little soy sauce (love that stuff!) and just putting mushrooms and not the tomatoes and such.
Only problem was the recipe didn't say whether to follow the gravy packets instructions with water etc, thankfully I DID. Would have liked to see that stated in the recipe.
I also didn't cook it THIRTY to FORTY FIVE MINS, my gosh, saw no need. Maybe about 15.
Served it over mashed potatoes and had corn and bread. The picky husband liked, victory!

This is EXCELLENT!  Doubled the recipe and added lemon pepper to the flour when dredging.  Used italian style canned tomatoes and the crock pot.  Could not ask for a better cool weather meal.We had noodles this time, looking forward to mashed potatoes!

My family thought this dish was terrific.  As the cook, it was easy to prepare.  I added some diced celery and chopped green pepper.  Just a personal choice for me.  Will definitely make this one again.

We did not like it. I followed the directions, and de-glazed the pan with red wine like some suggested. It was gluey and bland.

Done per Helene's directions, this recipe IS as titled: Swiss Steak--Quick and Easy.  The complexity of this simple recipe is the balance of having a red sauce tasting dish AND a brown gravy tasting one; adding just a touch more of either can serve it up your way---and still ring true as a family and guest favorite down home comfort food dish. Try it w/ a nice cuts of steak or pre-cut stew meat and get artsy with on hand veggies.

This was just ok... hardly any flavor so I added chipotle to spice it up. The tomatoes were not really jiving, and I love tomatoes. I would try cooking steak like this with another sauce.

I omitted the mushrooms and the stewed tomatoes I used weren't very juicy so I added a bit of tomato juice.  Also I used a cast iron Dutch oven. Cast makes everything better.

I followed it exactly, except added a bell pepper and garlic, and it was GOOD - but tasted like gourmet Hamburger Helper.  With cube steak being $6/lb and me feeding 7 people, I could have saved quite a bit of grocery money going a different direction.  Again, good recipe, just not the "wow" factor for the cost.  Back when cube steak was cheap I may have had a completely different opinion about the recipe. :)

Quick and tasty. I added some red wine to deglaze as suggested by others. Cooked it entirely on the stovetop. Doubled the sauce so that there was more to go on the noodles. Mine still needed a little more flavor so I added some beef stock and tomato sauce.

This was excellent.  I added a tablespoon of brown sugar and a bit of worcestshire sauce that I had seen in another recipe then cooked it in the crockpot on high for four hours. It was very tender without falling apart and the sauce was great.

I made it just like the recipe and I had all of the ingredients in my cabinet or freezer.  The aroma in the house made my stomach growl the whole time.  This is just like the title, "quick and easy".  This recipe is a keeper!

This is a very good recipe! I did take the advice of other viewers and added garlic (2 cloves). I also added 1 cup of water to the recipe, as I was scared that if I hadn't it might be to thick. It turned out great and was even better left over.

Very simple...I started out following the recipe but there was hardly any sauce so I added another gravy packet. (taste was really good as is but I added 1 tsp minced garlic...just because I like garlic), still didn't think there was enough gravy so I added another 2 c. of beef broth then finished simmering. Finally I thickened it all up with a little argo...served over egg noodles. Everyone loved it. Easy recipe for a weeknight. Next time will try it in the crock pot.

One of my childhood favorites!  My mom put a can of peas in this instead of mushrooms and served over mashed potatoes!  Great comfort food - thanks!

I liked this recipe...I added a little water to it because it was thick, BUT I think it would have worked fine without the water.  I put the salt and pepper into the flour, but the mixture needed some spices I was just nervous with the gravy mix thinking it would be salty.  Very tasty over egg noodles.  Thanks for sharing.

Giving this 4 stars because I didn't care for it but my husband thouroughly enjoyed this, had seconds and everything!  He said this recipe was a keeper.  I did have to cook it for at least 2 hours though to get the meat tender.

This was very good, my hubby loved it. I chose it over chicken fried steak because it is lower in fat and calories. My husband is from a cattle farm and we get free meat and I never know what to make with the tenderized steak and I think we found a keeper! I did change a few things based on what I had in the house and personal preference but this was a great guide and we have a new favorite! Served over garlic mashed potatoes.

Thanks for the recipe!

Not bad, but not great either.  Rather bland, like something was missing from the recipe.  Will try again though

MMMMMMM!  I had never attempted swiss steak before, and I'm so glad I found this recipe.  What a simple, economical, and delicious meal!  I made only a few changes.  I deglazed the pan, with the tomotos and a bit of water, before adding everything else in.  I also added in some celery, a carrot, and a bell pepper... the more veggies in the pot... the more my toddler will eat!  I served with mashed potatos.  We had a cold and rainy day here... this was perfect... EVERYONE loved it.

Fantastic!  Made this with sirloin steak cut into strips - it was all I had on hand.  Everything else I followed the recipe and put it all in the crock pot to cook all day.  What a quick, easy, delicious meal!  I'll definitly make this one again. Thanks for posting it!

Made with a few alterations.  I added some paprika for one. Since I didn't have the gravy mix, I used some chicken bouillon and made a gravy thickening.  Just let it simmer and was excellent on mashed potatoes!  Quick and easy.....and GOOD!!  Make again!!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I made a few variations.  I used cube steak in place of the round steak and I baked it in the oven for @ 350 for 1 1/2.  I also covered it with foil while it baked.

I've made this recipie a couple times and it's now been added to my husband and my "favorites" box. We don't have a Dutch oven, so we used our slow cooker and it turned out great! Thanks for sharing it!
