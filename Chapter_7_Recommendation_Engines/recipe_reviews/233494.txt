Here's what I did and would do next time.  It has potential in terms of being really good and also healthy.
I chopped/minced the squash instead of grating, no butter, used about a cup of coconut milk instead of  coconut extract.

The thing I thought was a little odd about it was the texture of the squash.  I think next time I would puree the whole thing and say it was a coconut cream pie and serve with whipped cream.  Good way to use up yellow squash.  Will try again next time I need to use some up.

Added lemon zest and lemon juice, omitted coconut flavoring, added 1/2 tsp. vinegar for a chess pie result. and made it crustless to cut calories. Very rich and flavorful! I'll add crust next time.

I have made this before, I boiled the squash cut it up in circles after it was soft ,I drained it and took a paper towel and smashed the water out (I drained it in a collider and smashed water) using my hand mixer mix all ingredients then pour into pie shell....I canâ€™t remember if I prebaked the pie shells or not,,,
