Tried it this way and was very good. The traditional staple at our parties, though, use a jar of grape jelly. Experiment. Any fruit jelly type arrangement with the chili sauce should be good. I do think I prefer our grape jelly/chili sauce combo though. You can also use cocktail weenies. Our recipe calls for making and cooking in crockpot on low--much better blending and "together" flavor than this 15 minutes.

So simple and so delicious! I have made this a half dozen times and always a crowd pleaser.  I use the cocktail size frozen meatballs.  I cook the cranberry sauce and chili sauce on medium heat until well blended.  Add the frozen meatballs and cook for @ 15 minutes and then transfer to a crock pot.  Good to go!

I'm going to make this tomorrow but I am skeptical that 24oz of frozen meatballs can be Cooke through in 15 minutes.  I'm guessing this is a post from somebody at Johnsonville.  I'm sure any meatballs will do.    I'll update my post tomorrow.

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years.  It is very crock-pot friendly and is a big hit at our church luncheons.
