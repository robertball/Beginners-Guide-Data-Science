I loved this recipe (with some additions from the comments) - I reduced the oil, increased the juice, used rice wine vinegar, added the garlic and ginger and some sugar for the dressing - ABSOLUTELY necessary additions or else you're basically just pouring juice on your salad. - I also included red peppers in the salad and it was a HUGE hit.

I just served this to a party of 100 for a Hawaiian Luau.  Lots of people asked for the recipe and said this was delicious.  I made some changes to the vinaigrette.  I used Rice Wine Vinegar instead of Red Wine Vinegar and added fresh ginger and garlic to the dressing to add depth to the taste. Also added a little sugar to balance the flavors.

I made this recipe for my gourmet group in which I was doing a Luau theme. Everyone loved it. I made several changes, though. I increased the pineapple juice to 1/2 cup and used extra (fresh only!!!) cutup pineapple on each individual plate. For presentation, I also used some star fruit on each plate (looks pretty and adds more color). Also, I decreased the onion to 2, and upped the coconut to 1/2 cup.  I really wanted to bring out the tropical flavors of this recipe.  I would definitely make this recipe again!

Great salad! Such a delicious combination. I used ready-made real bacon bits and they worked fine. Upped the amount of pineapple juice because I wanted more of that flavor. Also used canned pineapple tidbits. By using the canned pineapple and precooked bacon, I saved a ton of time. Also, used macadamia nuts (they were salted so I rinsed them off because toasting. My daughter liked it as well even though she doesn't like coconut. I have made tons of salads using various fruits but never have dabbled with pineapple in this kind of combination. This is my new favorite and I am going to say the best salad I have ever had in my life.

What a great salad!  We loved it, even kids, and will make again.  I omitted the bacon (didn't have any), increased the pineapple juice to 1/2 cup as suggested, and had to use the sugar-coated almonds rather than the macadamias.  The toasted coconut is so good on this salad!  Thanks, Marianne!  Delicious!

LOVED this salad!  All the flavors came together and made for a very elegant, yet tropical salad.  Once the dressing goes on, you have to eat it - the leftovers became soggy overnight.  Eat what you make!

At first I wasn't sure if anyone would like this different salad.  However, it was a hit at a luau I attended.  It's even better the next day!

This was a really tastey, light, and easy salad to make. I'm always looking for more salad recipes that encorporate fruit and greens. Everyone liked it. I had some butter lettuce, and baby spinach on hand, so I mixed that in with the romaine lettuce, and it made for a nice salad mix. Makes a bit too much dressing for the size of the salad, but there was absolutely nothing wrong with the taste! It will be something I make again.

Once again my hubby is not one for fruit in his greens but he had to admit that this salad is superior.  A perfect combination of flavors with salad ingredients and dressing.

Very tasty!  I made this for a tropical-themed dinner party for my fiance and future in-laws.  Enjoyed by all - but I do wish the flavors were more pronounced.  I think next time I'll add some more tropical fruit on top...

This salad was even better than I expected from the rave reviews! It's a great combination of flavors and not too sweet. I used baby spinach + romaine, almonds + macadamias, decreased the pineapple juice, added a few shots of jalapeno sauce to the dressing, and upped the coconut. Delish.

I was completely shocked by this salad!  I had a group of friends over and everyone loved it...even my husband who hates sweet foods.  I was kind of wary about making it and even a friend of mine who cooks well was hesitant as I was making the vinaigrette...but it rocked!
Toasting chopped macadamia nuts was very quick on the stove, and the coconut took like a minute to toast in the microwave...I forgot all about the green onions and it was fine.
I was craving it so badly the next day that I made it again, only without nuts, and with canadian bacon and I used the green onions...and it was amazing again.  Also, I used bagged salad, Spring Mix.  And I put the bacon on a cookie sheet and baked it in the oven...crispy and less time consuming.  
Thanks for an awesome salad!

A wonderful salad!  Interesting combination of flavors.  I rarely use a recipe without changing it, but I did not adjust this one, and it was great just as it was.  Thanks!

I made this for our Rally day at church.  Everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe, toasted whole almonds that I chopped up, used canned in its own juice pineapple, fried up real bacon and added 2 teaspoons of sugar to the vinegette as I had used the juice from the canned pineapple.  Great recipe.

Very different and a good base recipe. However, I mixed up the dressing as written and it tasted very bland without much pineapple flavor at all. I added a few extra ingredients to knock it up a notch - pureed pineapple, Dijon mustard, garlic, fresh ginger and sugar. Also cut EVOO to 1/2 the amount. I made the dressing a day in advance so the flavors could develop. I know the salad ingredients would be fabulous as is and did use all ingredients listed, but I did add a few extras because I felt they would compliment the salad very well - fresh sliced strawberries, sugar glazed pecans, and crumbled feta. Instead of tossing all together I layered everything and sprinkled toasted coconut on last. I did not add dressing until just before serving, then just drizzled over it all. Excellent refreshing salad. Makes you feel like you are sitting in the tropics!

This is such a great salad.  I brought it to my sisters Luau and it is now a staple for the yearly event.  The pineapple, greens, veggies and nuts compliment eachother so well. The dressing is nice and light and very refreshing.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I had a lot of fun making this and my girlfriends really enjoyed the tropical taste! A bit time consuming to make, but worth it in the end. Definitely a great alternative salad for the summer. Especially good with fresh pineapple--I added extra  coconut to really bring out the tropical flavors. Woudl most definitely make again.

Very good salad (4 stars) except for the dressing, which was far too oily with virtually no other flavor (0 stars). So to it I added 2 Tblsp more pineapple juice, 1 Tblsp pineapple juice concentrate, 1 Tblsp more cider vinegar (ran out of red wine vinegar), & a total of 1 tsp. salt & 1/4 tsp black pepper. Better!

This was an awesome salad!  It's so light and fresh tasting...it will be one of our frequent summer salads for sure.  My husband and very picky daughter loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a 1/2 cup pineapple juice for the vinaigrette and added 2 cut up tomatoes and extra toasted coconut.  Taking it to work Monday for Nurses Week.  Thanks for the great salad recipe!

This is one of the *best* salads I have ever had!  The only downfall is there is a lot of prep work in toasting the coconut and macadamia nuts, etc.  But it is well worth it!

Oh wow.  We've never really been a salad family.  A salad to me is a bag of prechopped salad topped with store-bought Italian dressing.  This was amazing, and both of my parents especially liked it.  Fresh pineapple is a must, and I subbed toasted almonds, which I toasted a bit first, then added the coconut and finished toasting, and then threw it in the mix.  Light and tasty, but surprisingly filling.

Served this salad, with tiny sweetbread sandwiches,to 25 women and every plate came back empty!! I used shortcuts---canned pineapple tidbits, Hormel's real bacon chunks, untoasted coconut---but heads of fresh romaine. It is a fabulous keeper!

I love salads, and this was easy and so delicious!  I used pre-cooked real bacon bits, canned pineapple chunks, and regular (not toasted) sweetened coconut - to cut down on prep time.  Took me 5 minutes tops.  I had seconds!  Can't wait to make this for company!

Two of us showed up at the Hawaiian party with the same salad.  Both of us ran into ingredient 'glitches' so mine had cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, hers had slivered almonds instead of macadamia nuts.  You could barely tell the difference.  Right Linda?

We absolutely loved this salad.  The flavors were spot on, even though at first it seemed like they wouldn't work.  The only thing I did was sub cashews for macademia nuts, because I didn't have any.  The toasted coconut was awesome, and I'm not even a fan of coconut.  I will definitely be making this quite often this summer.  Thanks for the delicious salad recipe!

Fantastic! Like other reviews, I added a minced clove of garlic, about 1 tsp grated fresh ginger. I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes. I didn't have quite enough pineapple juice, so I added orange juice to make up for what I was lacking. It was perfect. We had it with Jerk pork chops and coconut rice. Mmmmm.

this was a refreshing change to salad. I did what was suggested and put garlic and ginger and sugar in the dressing. Letting the dressing sit with the spices in it for a couple hours is a MUST! Paired it with white rice/sauted veggies with left over dressing!) and a bag of maui style rib meat from Trader Joes! Quick and lovely. thank you thank you!

This salad was wonderful.  My guests who normally skip salads, ate so much that I was only left with scraps.  Next time I know to make much more, because they wanted to take some home.

This was pretty good.  Our biggest problem was keeping everything cool since it was SO hot the day we made it.  I used turkey bacon, but next time I'll use bacon bits instead of cooking bacon.  We also used fresh pineapple, added a bit more juice to the dressing and used candied almond slices.

Because we had a vegan guest, I left out the bacon and forgot the onions, but was still told it was the best dish I made all night. Also, I used spinach in place of romaine because I always prefer to use spinach when I can. Fantastic.

I will put in 5 stars because I changed the recipe and it wasn't perfect - I found the dressing bitter.  However, I used orange juice instead of pineapple juice so that was probably it.  Here are my changes (used recipe as starting point): No bacon; used a small handful of ham for each bowl instead, idea from Ham and Pineapple Ranch Salad on this website; OJ instead of pineapple as mentioned; tore my own romaine...save money; sliced almonds instead of macadamia (based on what I had on hand); and no coconut, which would also have made it taste less bitter.  So, what I did I would give 4 stars...great idea to have pineapple and nuts in a salad, anyhow.

I had a vegetarian and three carnivores for dinner last night.  Made this salad, ommitting the bacon and substituting slices of chicken marinated in teriyaki sauce, pineapple juice and garlic.  I left the onions on the side, but put everything else on.  I also added some of the unused marinade to the red wine vinegar mix, and the result was incredible.  The coconut was the BEST idea!

Excellent combination of flavors!  Even those who don't eat salads will love this one!  No time to cook the bacon: use pre-cooked, diced pepperoni (found with the lunch meats) as a just-as-tasty alternative.

I was a little bit skeptical at first, but the flavors blend beautifully. What a way to complement my fresh, farm-bought greens! The bacon is essential, but vegetarians don't have to lose out: meat-free bacon "substitutes" add similar depth to the taste.

I tried this recipe for my supper club.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I found it fairly simple to make. It does take a little time to toast the nuts and coconut.  I also used canned pineapple.  I would make it again, however I would decrease the amount of juice in the recipe.  C. Williams

Very good, but I did change the recipe quite a bit.

I reduced the oil to 2 teaspoons, and the vinegar to 2 tablespoons, and added 2 tablespoons of coconut milk, and increased the pineapple juice to 1/2 cup. It was less tangy, and more creamy

I have to admit that I didn't actually make the salad, but I mixed up just the juice, red wine vinegar, olive oil, and pepper.  I served it over romaine along with some dried cranberries and sugared walnuts--it was delicious!  It's a great vinaigrette that's light and not too tart on the tongue.

I was nervous about how people would feel about this salad, but I made it anyway I needed a tropical salad for my themed dinner party.  This salad was a hit!  It's probably my new personal favorite and will become a regular lunch for me!  Yum!  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

What a great salad! I made this just as it was written and tasted the dressing beforehand. It did seem like it was lacking something, so I added 1 tbsp. splenda for some sweetness and 1 tbsp. dijon mustard, as suggested by another reviewer - and it turned out perfect! A wonderful mix of flavors - I'd give it 4 stars as written, 5 stars with my additions. I bet it would be even better with some sliced grilled chicken breast or grilled shrimp on top - I will definitely be trying that!

Loved this recipe! I only found sweetened shredded coconut in the baking aisle so I purchased a fresh coconut and grated it. Made a great difference! I will certainly make this again. Great texture and balance.

I served this for my family on my birthday, rather than doing some boring old salad again. This tropical twist was a total hit! I toasted my coconut and almonds with brown sugar, and incorperated all of the coconut, rather than just some. It was fabulous! Thank you!

This was very tastey!I made it without the coconut flakes and the pineapple chunks.I think next time I will make it just as written.I thought it would make it too sweet but now I know it would of been better.I would also double the dressing if you like alot of dressing.I will surely make this again.It has a unique taste...Great when you want to impress your guests!!!

I like pineapple, and I had high hopes for this salad.  The thing that I think was the weak link was the dressing.  It had very little flavor, I had to try and kick up the flavor without any luck, the foundation of the dressing wasn't great.  It was to oily, and the pineapple juice really wasn't the best option for flavoring a dressing. I think I would do a sweet poppyseed dressing, and use all the other additions if I did this again.

Really unique and relatively easy recipe HOWEVER I agree fully with all the reviewers that the dressing is "too much" to put on the salad - way too runny and I wish I'd known this before as it sort of ruined the overall appeal of the salad as people served it and saw how much dressing was left on the bottom. So I'd recommend either making half as much dressing or serving it on the side. Otherwise, wonderful and goes with so many different cuisines.

Wonderful!  I used raspberry wine vinegar (didn't have any red wine vinegar, but the raspberry gave it an extra fruity taste!), and I also added chopped, cooked chicken to turn it into a main dish salad.  The toasted coconut gave it a great flavor!

Honestly, I didn't expect much out of this recipe (I mean, it's just a salad, right?), but I was soooo wrong! This is great! I didn't have any macadamia nuts, so I just added all of the other things. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent!  I did adjust the dressing.  I added chopped garlic, soy sauce and ground ginger. I also felt it was too tart and added a couple of tbls of sugar and just a touch more pineapple juice. Additionally I grilled the pineapple and added grilled chicken that had been marinated in a soy marinaded.  Was a huge hit and would be a great main dish salad.  Especially in the summer.

Served this to my boss and his wife, both with very discriminating taste and they LOVED it. I did add the dijon mustard to the dressing. My hubbie, that is not a salad fan by any means, ask me to make it again the next night. It was a huge hit all around.

Good salad!  I used almonds instead of mac nuts, and to make it easier I just used real bacon bits instead of frying up bacon.  I used fresh pineapple and I love the pineapple juice in the vinaigrette.  I did think it was missing a little something though.  Maybe some finely chopped garlic or onion in the dressing? Or dijon mustard?  Just some ideas to try....

I didn't have any romaine lettuce and had to use a mix of dandelion greens and arugula from a tiny local store!  I also fried torn-up pieces of ham sandwich meat since I didn't have bacon. While I'm sure the original ingredients would be a better compliment to the vinaigrette, it is such a good salad that even mine was still delicious!

Surprisingly, this is extremely delicious! I make it for potlucks all the time and everyone is always surprised at how incredibly yummy it is, since it seems like an odd combination and a little weird as a salad! It's a little harder to make than a garden salad but WELL worth the time!! Thanks! This is going in my permanent recipe box!

Taste better than it looks. I wish the appearance was better. Even though I waited just before serving to toss dressing in, the salad still seemed soggy. Must be the pineapple. I drained it but you have to really have it dry. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. It went well with our Hawaiian style dinner.

What a wonderful salad!  My family liked it so much they requested that I make it again this week!  I made it to go with "Chicken and Pasta in a Mango Cream Sauce" (also on this site) to have a Caribbean themed night since we were all sick of winter.  Therefore I deviated from the recipe a bit to use up extra ingredients I had lying around.  I added cilantro to the salad, and I added juice from half a lime and some fresh grated ginger to the dressing.  The dressing was divine!  I almost didn't add the toasted coconut because I was a little skeptical.  Don't leave it out.  It pulls the flavors of the salad together.

FANTASTIC salad recipe. I made this to go with kalua pork. I was nervous thinking this recipe might be too sweet, but the bacon and the savory green onions offset it. I used less oil than it called for, and blended it in the blender to mix well and just moistened my salad with it so that meant there ended up being some left over (so I'd cut the dressing in half next time.) Also, I used real bacon bits and canned crushed pineapple to save time and it was still perfect. I'll make again!

This was soooooo good! I always improvise on this salad, adding whatever veggies I have on hand (i.e. carrots, tomatoes, green pepper, broccoli, etc.), and I don't usually use bacon bits. I love it!

Great salad. Easy to make and elegant with just enough sweet, tart, and salty. I used Canola oil in place of the olive oil (husband hates olive) and Yves veggie bacon in place of the meat. I used slightly less oil and more pineapple juice. I will make this again for sure.

This was a hit with my bunco group. I would reduce the amount of vinegar and increase the amount of juice.

This is wonderful. I left out the onions, used rice vinegar,  canned pineapple (in juice,  which got used in the vinegarette), and used bagged real bacon bits, because I'm lazy. :) It was still delicious, though I can see where fresh pineapple and crumbled crisp bacon would really kick it up a notch. But even the "lazy way" it goes into rotation!

Loved this salad. Seems so simple, but the flavors are just different enough. I used apple cider vinegar in the dressing, and added garlic powder and parsley to it. Rather than tossing all ingredients, I built each salad individually (only serving two tonight!), leaving nuts off for allergic DBF and using honey roasted almonds on mine. He said it was an awesome salad :) (I'm not gonna tell him there was coconut on top heehee).

Delicious surprise!  had two pineapples to use up, so tried this.  Used slivered almonds instead of macadamias and toasted them along with coconut. Forgot to put the bacon in...think we liked it better without! it was fresh and woke up the taste buds! delicious and will be baking it again....tonight!

Okay, I'm no phenomenal cook as I will quickly wrote how I screed up the recipe. Lol I was unable to find flaked coconut or macadamia nuts. I accidentally put in a have a cup of pineapple jibe so I kind of doubled the red wine vinegar. My family lives the salad dressing. Just they way I planned it. Lol. Well use this recipe again, my version but I'll let my wife make. Loll

Took it to a friend's house for a bbq, and it was very well received.  I would definitely make it again.  I didn't have macadamia nuts, so I substituted sugared pecans.  Also added dried cranberries for some color.  Red bell pepper would probably have worked as well, but we liked the craisins.

I made this years ago but must've done something radical to the dressing, bc back then I gave this 5 stars. I tried it again this week with the dressing as written and it's not good. It's just sour and loose on account of too much acid and not enough oil. I even emulsified it and it didn't take. The dressing as written was a big flop, I had to doctor it a ton this time and still wound up throwing it out. The combination of raw ingredients though is fantastic, I still loved the tropical flavors. I do add cooked chicken to it and make it a meal, too!

I thought this was pretty good.  I thought the vinaigrette had too strong of a vinegar taste, I tried to compensate by adding more pineapple juice, but it didn't work for me.  As expected, it's not very good for leftovers the next day.  It was a nice side to serve with Ham & Swiss Stromboli.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Marianne G!

I loved the flavor of this salad. Sweet and savory! I grilled pineapple wedges a couple of days ago and was looking for a recipe to use the left overs. I didn't have any pineapple juice so I pureed a couple of grilled pineapple wedges and added it to the dressing. And the toasted coconut really added to the flavor. Will make this again!

I tried making this with iceberg lettuce and I felt like it was too thick to absorb the flavor of the dressing so deffinitely dont try to substitute the romaine with any other type of lettuce. Other than that, yummy!

We loved this salad! After reading through the reviews, I opted to add a little something to the dressing. I added about a teaspoon or so of dijon mustard and that was perfect for us. I used sliced almonds only because macadamia nuts are way too expensive. I will definately be making this salad again, and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this for my friend (who is also a health nut haha.) she said it was great. I used toasted macadamia nuts and reduced the juice in a saucepan to make the flavour more subtle. I also added some dried papaya and halved mandarine segments on top. The viniger was a little bleh. so I mixed a viniger mix with cider, balsamic, and rice wine. I find that there's a little more depth in the flavour. I also downed a little on the oil because i think it would have been a little too greasy for a salad.

I love the idea of this salad, as well as the ingredients on their own.  But I honestly don't understand the 5-star reviews.  I used all fresh and, when possible, locally grown and/or organic ingredients--and thought it was insipid-tasting and not worth the trouble.  I gave it 2 stars cause it was edible.

Perfect as is or add shrimp for a meal!  To make this salad an appetizer or meal try this:  Clean jumbo shrimp, (shell, devein, tails on), wrap each in a slice of prosciutto. Marinate for 30 minutes in a bit of the pineapple vinaigrette. Skewer with fresh (never canned) pineapple chunks and red bell pepper.  Make salad according to directions. Grill or broil shrimp kabobs until prosciutto is crispy and shrimp are opaque.  Toss salad with a bit of the vinaigrette and plate. Place kabobs on top of salad, drizzle with a bit more dressing, and serve. YUM!

Made with canned pineapple instead of fresh and used a red onion in place of the green onions to add a bit of color.  Also added garlic and red pepper flakes to the dressing.  This was so good I made the recipe amounts as written for 6 and 2 of us ate it all!  Served with Ham and Pineapple sandwiches from this site.  SO GOOD!

Absolutely yummy! I made this as the recipe stated, other than subbing red onions for green (because I didn't have any) and toasted pecans for the macadamia nuts. This was fantastic!! The dressing with all that flavors works well in my opinion. I will definitely be making this again! 5+ stars!

This is certainly interesting and refreshing, but somehow the flavors just didn't appeal to us. The dressing certainly needs more kick, I followed reviewer Terri's advice cut the oil in half, and added garlic powder, ginger and a bit of sugar. Since I keep kosher, I used imitation bacon bits to get the same flavor.

My dad loved this salad! This is such agreat salad, because plain green salads aren't very popular at our house. But since this salad not only has meat, nuts, and coconut, it has pineapples, which makes it like a fruit salad, making it the most popular salad in the house now! I used almonds, as well as macondaias, and cooked all nuts with coconut and already fried bacon! Which the bacon turned out good, and crispy, while it starts to burn in the pan! Everything tasted great blended together, and the sauce was great with the salad! Thank you for this recipe!

I was hesitant to try this one, since I am somewhat of a salad traditionalist. We had guests from Hawaii however, so I thought "what the heck". I will never shy away from another unique salad again. Our guests raved as they discovered each taste in the salad. The coconut...the macadamia....mmmm! They even asked us for the recipe. Thank your for sharing this unique...and REALLY delicious salad!

This was a nice light different salad.  I doubled for Mother's Day and used almonds instead of mac nuts and served coconut on the side.  I also cheated and used real bacon bits instead of frying my own bacon.  My MIL loved it!

My oh my...I made this for Easter and it was a HUGE hit.  The only thing I did differently was use balsamic vinegar in place of red wine vinegar simply because that's what I had on hand. Oh! I also used honey-roasted macadamia nuts (pulsed in the food processor) because they were on sale. What a yummy, yummy salad, I will definitely make this again and again!!!

Wow.  This is so original and SO delicious.  Make this if you want to WOW your friends.  I think you could add a little sesame chicken to make it a meal.  FANTASTIC!

I knew from all the reviews that this would be a great recipe!  It turned out fantastic!  I took this to a Luau and it was a hit!  I followed the ingredients exactly and loved it!  I didn't use all the dressing on the salad, as it would have drenched the greens, but it was soo good as it was!

A yummy salad!!  I tried this recipe last week, and I'm making it again to take to our family potluck for Easter.  Quick and easy to throw together and great flavors.  I did use almonds instead of the macadamia nuts, to cut cost.

Very good salad.  Nice for a change of pace.  We made teriyaki steaks to go with it and the pairing was excellent.  I did add some garlic and ginger paste to the dressing and it was fabulous.  I recommend you eat it up because it won't leftover well.

I made this and everyone loved it.  I made a few tweaks...I used the bacon grease in lieu of olive oil and added a bit of garlic and honey.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

I am sure the recipe as is is great as is but I can't help but mess with a recipe. I followed some of the suggestions here (less oil, a little sugar, added ginger and garlic) but I also added blue cheese.  
 I know it sounds weird but it pairs amazingly with the pineapple. I also added about half of a Thai chilli  and a red bell pepper.

This salad was a really big hit at a luau party I threw. The dressing is delicious. I did omit the bacon and coconut. Also, I’m not a fan of macadamia nuts, so I put sliced roasted almonds. I also added blueberries. Yum!

This was a little bland for us. It's definitely a good concept, but I think I would add more coconut next time and do something to kick up the dressing a bit.

Tripled the recipe for a bday party with pineapple theme. Used toasted almonds and left out the coconut. Added 2 tbsp honey mustard and used Apple cider vinegar for the dressing .  The salad was a HUGE HIT.

I love this refreshing salad. From reading the other reviews, I did make some adjustments. For the vinaigrette, I doubled the pineapple juice, used rice vinegar, reduced the oil (although I feel it would have been fine the way it was), and added dehydrated garlic and ground ginger (I didn't want to deal with fresh). I also used canned pineapple, added bell peppers and chicken and used almonds instead of macadamia nuts. I will definitely make this again. I do make all my salads in mason jars. Layered in this order: vinaigrette, pineapple, bell peppers, green onions, chicken, bacon, almonds, coconut and greens.

This is now my new favourite summer salad, beating out the old traditional greek salad.  I just use bacon bits though and add chicken breast.  I can eat a whole bowl myself... and have.

These flavours really went well together, and it's worth it to toast the coconut. I froze the leftover coconut in a ziploc and sprinkled it on foods as I needed it throughout the week.

Such a refreshing salad!  Made as is (well, it was for a weeknight, so we used canned pineapple even though fresh must undoubtedly be better - and, even though my husband loves bacon, since I can't have any, he nixed having bacon even for his!!!!!...., and, surprisingly enough he loved this anyway, so much so that he doesn't even want to try adding the bacon in later???? that's really saying something, coming from him - usually he feels deprived if bacon is on the menu and he doesn't get 'his share'..... (silly boy!)...   ME?  I want to sub in turkey ham next time, cuz I love the sweet and salty flavors suggested in the recipe - hubby was looking at the Christmas bills coming up and he just didn't want to open the package tonight...? *sigh*).  Anyway, with those two small changes, the salad was very refreshing indeed.  I must say that I do want to try some of the suggestions made by other reviewers, such as adding in garlic, ginger, red pepper, and much more toasted coconut.  Also want to try the dressing with the rice vinegar as a couple of reviewers suggested.  The red wine vinegar is awfully pretty if you want to serve the salad elements all separate as we did.  Served this alongside Key West Chicken from this site, all with some grilled pineapple, onions, & green peppers (grilled via a grill wok), as well as a good bit more toasted coconut.  Yum!  Plan to serve this monthly in that combination.  Thanks, Marianne G!  I think this will make great memories for our children!

I made a double batch of this for a party. While it was tasty, it was very soggy - perhaps because of all the juice from the pineapple? I would probably cut the dressing down by half next time. The combo of pineapple and bacon was yummy. The cost to put this together was a bit pricey though. Macadamia nuts at $13/lb., whole pineapple $4, bacon $4, etc. Something to keep in mind! :)

Yum, Yum, Yum!! I double the recipe and my husband just about ate it all!! I had an extra mango and avocado I needed to use up, and it worked pretty well with everything. I used a fresh pineapple, so the extra pieces went into the food processer for the “juice” part of the dressing. I also added some ginger root and garlic like some others suggested, but there is NO need for sugar!! The fruit is sweet enough, anything more might make it too sweet. I will be making this again very soon.

I served the salad for a Hawaiian Luau theme progressive dinner.  Everyone liked it.  I added the sugar , dijon mustard, garlic, 1/2 amount of oil, and ginger as many suggested and used spring greens. also used real bacon in a bag.

Great Salad!  I was a little disappointed that the dressing wasn't sweet at all!  I thought it would be!  It just tasted like oil and vinegar.  Love the salad part though and will be making it again!

Perfect combo of sweet & salty with a nice cruncy.  I always serve it with Hawaiian Grilled Chicken, either on the side or chopped ad added to the salad.

This salad was a hit at a Hawaiian themed shower I went to.  I did not put the pineapple in the salad, the vinagrette was enough pineapple flavour for me.  For presentation value I put edible flowers on the top.  It was really beautiful and tasted great.  Oh, I had no macadamia nuts so I put in some almonds.  Though straying from the theme they worked fine.  This is a tasty, simple salad where the dressing and lettuce (I did not use bagged lettuce for this, but locally grown romaine) are complimented opposed to being overpowered by too many ingredients.

This was pretty good.  I did make a few changes to speed up the preparation of the salad: canned pineapple and real bacon bits.  Also, I increased the pineapple juice to 1/2 c. and I'm glad I did because I think the dressing would've been too oily otherwise.  I used almonds and left out the green onions due to personal preference.

A good blend of flavors, although it's missing something. I didn't figure out what it was... but this is definitely a side salad to a main course...would pair nicely with a fish or chicken dish. I'll keep looking...

Excellent!  My family loved and devoured it.  Because my older daughter is allergic to coconut, I omitted it, but it wasn't missed.

After reading all the reviews, I must say I was very disappointed.  I gave it 3 stars because it was okay, but I wouldn't make it again.

I made this for my "luau" themed party. I doubled it all. I followed all but left out the pineapple.Just my choice. I also used toasted almond pieces. A huge hit at party. Went well with the slammin' salmon. Oh, I also used red onion for the color. The vinaigrette is perfect. I put the dressing in a small container and shook it before adding it to the salad. Thank you for sharing!

Super great!  I rate the recipe as written 5 stars and with my changes 10 stars.  I added feta cheese and dried cherries to the salad.  I also added a few shakes of garlic powder and red pepper flakes to the dressing for some additional kick.  I took the salad to a party and people flipped over it!  I made it again with broiled chicken which was also fantastic!  Be sure to use the freshest ingredients for huge success.

Love this salad, this recipe is a keeper.  I used the fresh pineapple but I grilled it before chopping and adding to the salad, if you've never ate grilled fruit you will be surprised at the flavor enhancement.  I also cut the oil in half for the dressing.  I served this with my ever so famous Spicy Chipotle Turkey Burgers.

I'm into salads with fruit and nuts...this was a hit at the birthday dinner I made for my best friend. I liked the rice vinegar suggestion (fitting).  It went well with BBQ'd butterflied leg of lamb. This is a keeper!

I made this for a pot luck with a Hawaiian theme.  The only difference is I used a large can of chunked pineapple and the juice from the can and omitted the nuts for my allergic neice.  It was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it and it went great with the pulled pork and mango salsa, and hawaiian sweet rolls.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for the recipe!

This salad was just what I was looking for to prepare for a large crowd at a tropical theme picnic!  It sounded so good that I didn't read the reviews, but I added more pineapple juice as well as a little Splenda to the dressing.  I used macadamia nuts and almonds.  It was a hit!

Yum-o!

I skipped the bacon, because some of my guests were vegetarians. I also added some extra vinegar because the dressing seemed a bit oily to me. The salad came out so delicious! I served it at a luau themed party, but will put it into my regular summertime rotation :)

I wasn't too crazy about the recipe for the dressing. I ended up adding a bit of sugar,lots more pineapple juice, and half the oil. The salad with the pineapple and bacon and coconut was delicious, so altogether it was okay.  I would probably try it again.

Light & absolutely delicious!  The only changes I made was to prepare salad for 50 people & only made enough dressing for 30.  Just perfect amount of dressing! Compliments galore!  Definately a keeper recipe.

YUM! This was delicious. Just the right salad for my summer dinner party. Everyone loved it. I tossed the salad and served it on my salad plates with the macadamias and toasted coconut as a garnish. That way, it didn't get too soupy, as other reviewers had mentioned. It was a beautiful presentation, and, many compliments later, this is staying in my recipe box!

I made this for my work and everyone loved it.  I emulsified the dressing the day before and refrigerated it overnight.  I used the Organic Spring Greens from Costco (16 oz).  I would definitely make this again.  I think it would taste great with grilled chicken or salmon

Made this for my wedding dinner,it was a total hit. I did emulsify the oil in the dressing so it would not separate. I toasted the macadamias and the coconut on foil and used precooked bacon strips that I used my handy chopper on. I also used bagged spring mix and cut up pineapple from the deli so it was superfast to prepare and clean up and looked so good!! Even my father and husband loved it. I wish I had made more, because they scrapped the bowl clean.

I thought this salad was absolutely wonderful! It was very light and tastes great! I didn't even bother with toasting the almonds, and it was still good! I did add a touch more pineapple juice to the vinaigrette to make it a bit sweeter.

I used canned pineapple & juice, subbed white wine vinegar for the red wine vinegar, spinach for the romaine, red onion for the green, and sliced almonds which I toasted & sugared, for the macadamias.  Nice delicate dressing for this salad; we enjoyed it.  Thank you for the recipe, Marianne!

I made this right after we returned from a trip to Hawaii and this was great!  I subbed in 6 tablespoons of real bacon bits which worked really well and I bought the fresh pineapple that was already cut to save some time.

This dressing was a little oily I wouldn't put in the whole amount of olive oil maby 3/4. It was still wonderful despite that. The bacon and pineapple where delicious together. I loved it.

At first, I thought that the vinaigrette was a little strange but once the flavors had some time to meld, we just LOVED it.  I left out the bacon to cut back on cholesterol.  Deliscious!

The dressing was a little runny but other than that it was pretty good.
