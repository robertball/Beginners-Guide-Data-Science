This didn't really turn out as well as I had hoped it would.  You really couldn't taste the ranch flavoring with the amount called for in the recipe, and you definitely did not need the milk.  Also, fresh vegetables would have been much better.  I won't make this again, at least not without several changes.

This is better if you omit the canned veggies and milk, add 2 Tablespoons minced fresh onions, 2 tablespoons of sweet relish, and a cup of frozen petite peas.

This definitely helped me to get started.  I used frozen peas, no carrots.  I posted my own version.  Look it up under Cold Tuna an Mac Salad.

This was okay (wouldn't want to use canned vegetables though).  I used fresh carrots that I boiled the last 5 minutes with my pasta and thawed frozen peas.  Instead of the mayo, milk and mix, I used prepared ranch dressing.  Along with salt and pepper, I added onion salt and garlic powder.  It was a little bland, but it made a good lunch.

I used frozen peas and fresh carrots instead of canned (I figured it would taste better). Pretty easy to make however slightly dry.

Loved this recipe, however I did change it up a little bit.
I used two packets of the dry ranch dressing mix.  Did NOT use the carrots.  Used frozen peas, diced cucumber, and diced red, yellow and green pepper.  Super easy and the whole family loved it (even the most pickiest member!).

Did everything according to the recipe except add the carrots (didn't have any) or the milk (didn't need it). We liked it! The ranch flavor is not strong but it did give it a subtle tang that my old tuna salad was lacking. And in answer to people saying that it was too dry, I've never made a mayo based salad that didn't dry out over night. They all do! It's pretty good and I'll probably make it again.

I am sitting here eating this while it's still warm because it's so good.  I didn't have any canned carrots so I omitted them.  The flavor is wonderful and I can only imagine it will get better over the next day.

I followed the reviewed did frozen peas and no milk. It was 4-5 stars with those revisions! I didn't add any salt but I did add in a little bit of pickle and onion at the very end and that made it even better! I think this would be great with more pickle and even some celery! It'd give it a nice crunch.

I try to keep sodium low as possible so I used 1 frozen package of peas and carrots instead of canned. I added no salt and pepper because there is enough in the ranch dressing mix. It was delicious!

I omitted the carrots and used thawed frozen peas instead of canned. I didn't add the milk and mixed the mayo with a  4oz dry packet of the BUTTERMILK RECIPE Ranch dressing. It had a better flavor for this dish IMO than the regular ranch dressing packet. Taste tested them both before adding to the mayo. Also added 1 scallion (green onion) white and green part, thin sliced. With those minor changes it turned out good.
