Made it as shown and it tasted great.  I always make a recipe the way it is written first time or not at all.  For the reviewer that left out the garlic, parmesan cheese, and the nutmeg...what is it that you think you made?  Whatever it was it was not Alfredo Sauce.  Sounds like an easy Bechamel...without the flour; again what is that?

What the heck is the point of an Alfredo sauce without garlic and Parmesan cheese? Seriously? You are very wrong! Sorry, but it's true!!!

This is my secret weapon for staying on Keto/Low Carb program.  Try it on spaghetti squash or zoodles.   Excellent!

I always judge a recipe by asking myself: would I pay for this in a restaurant? And the answer for this sauce is ABSO-FREAKIN-LUTELY! This sauce is PHENOMENAL! Way better than almost any Alfredo sauce I’ve ever had in any restaurant.  Bonus, it was incredibly easy as well. I will NEVER use a jarred sauce again.

This is an amazing recipe! Altho, I highly recommend NOT using the nutmeg. IMO, it just tastes better without the nutmeg. But my husband and I use this recipe all the time!!!

made it twice in one week! Surprised at how hard it got in the fridge, but gets gooey after heating up just fine. Delicious.

I omitted the nutmeg since I was out, and instead added Rix Mix (locally made, awesome spice mix from Fargo,  North Dakota) and a little cayenne pepper for some kick. 
Also added broccoli,  and cajun shrimp and even with a double batch I barely had enough left overs for lunch!
My son's loved it on noodles and I enjoyed over zoodles

Absolutely amazing! Eat over zucchini spiraled noodles with shrimp. Best dinner ever. I added more garlic because I'm a fan of garlic, and used Shreaded parmesan cheese, not powder. Would highly highly recommend!

I never rate recipes...probably because they never turn out THAT great! (My culinary challenge - not the recipe I'm sure.) 

But this is SO easy that I couldn't even mess it up. I'ts a keeper for sure! My non-keto family LOVED it. It's good over chicken of course, but also quite tasty over beef. I missed in a little of the natural juice  - yum!  Warmed up great too!

I followed the recipe almost to the T! I did replace a little of the cream with chicken broth just because I was running low. It was the most delicious alfredo I've ever eaten! I used spaghetti squash and added grilled chicken. Delicious. Thank you!

I did not make any major changes.  I used Asiago and Parmesan cheese, 1 3/4 cups.  Everything else was according to the recipe.  Absolutely delicious.  I put over sauteed broccoli and sauteed pulled rotisserie chicken.  Yum!

This is so yummy! I am single so I was glad there is lots. Added Oregano as I plan to make Paleo pizza with some of it. Zoodles tonight with cheesy garlic bread.

I will definitely make this again.  Being on Keto I get bored with the same ole stuff and this is just what I needed.  We had this alongside pork piccata which was also amazing.

I made this tonight with zoodles and chicken.  It was delicious!! I'd highly recommend it! Super fast and easy!  I had already precooked the chicken breast, so dinner was ready in 20 minutes, tops.

I hate Alfredo sauce but my husband is on this keto diet and made this recipe. I'm in love with this Alfredo. I put it over asparagus and baked it and now don't want it any other way!

I had my doubts, my  hubby can be picky.  I left out garlic, parmesan cheese & nutmeg.  Total hit!!!
