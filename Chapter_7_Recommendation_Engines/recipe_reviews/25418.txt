So easy to make and has a great mildly spicy flavor. You must double the recipe to fit a regular loaf pan and double the cooking time at 375 degrees.

I used 1 lb. of lean ground turkey and doubled the rest of the ingrediants.  It took about 50 minutes to cook and I also added fresh basil leaves to the top of the loaf about 3/4 of the way through cooking and a some sliced roma tomatos at the same time, made it look good plus the fresh basil tasted good too.  As recipe said, I added lemon pepper to taste and this loaf is healthy and tasty.  A winner.

For all the not so positive comments made about turkey loaf I have to say this...I have not made this loaf yet, but like the idea of the salsa so I will be trying it.  I do however ALWAYS and ONLY make meat loaf using turkey.  I also only use wheat germ to hold it all together (instead of bread crumbs or crackers or something).  Just substitute same measuring.  Some may not like that texture, but my little family loves it and we usually eat the whole thing in one meal.  I also use one pound of turkey, and still one egg.  Just play around with it, you will figure it out.  Just keep in mind that it is REALLY good for you and can make it just as yummy as your other meat loaf.  I also have added lots of garlic or worchestersire sauce.

I was a bit skeptical about this, but it came out really good.  As suggested I doubled all of the ingredients except for the egg and baked it for 60 minutes at 350.  Also, I mixed a little bit of ketchup and worcestershire sauce and brushed it on the top before cooking, which made a nice glaze.  Would definitely make this again.

My family loved this one.  I likewise used 1 lb. of turkey for an hour.  Also, instead of eggs, I used egg beaters and homemade salsa.  I was so deluged by compliments and request I had to make a second one before the end of the week!

I've made this meatloaf for friends and family several times now, and it's always a big hit.  I double the recipe, and it's normally done in about an hour.  Great with pineapple or other fruit salsa.

Extremely yummy and easy!  I basically tripled the ingredients because I used one-and-a-half lb's. of ground turkey.  I made a nice big meatloaf and fed a family of four, including 1 very hungry hubby, and 2 very hungry teenage boys.  There was only 1 sliver leftover!  I served it with the "Green Beans with Bread Crumbs" recipe listed on this website, and both dishes were a huge hit with the family!!  Will absolutely make this healthy dinner again and again!! :)

I love this meatloaf. I used 1 lb of turkey so I doubled the ingredients. It was a little too runny, so I added more bread crumbs and baked for 45-1 hour. It was wonderful.

Pretty good, but had to cook longer, like 40 minutes instead. Tried a 2nd one with some light bbq sauce poured across a "ditch" on the top... and wow.. that was good.

This high protein, low-fat recipe was great!  Very moist, and tasty!  I doubled the recipe, and had to cook it for about an hour, and I raised the temperature to 400 to reach the safe 165 degrees for turkey.  Really liked this, will definitely make again soon!  The only thing:  mine didn't look so pretty, did anyone have better luck with presentation?

This was moist and delicious.  I did however double the recipe, subbed 1/2 c. egg beaters for the egg and wheat germ instead of bread crumbs.  I also sauteed my veggies in e.v.o.o. before mixing into the turkey mixture.  It was deeeelish.

This was absolutely delicious! I had to hide the leftovers from my fiance or we wouldn't have had anything for lunch today! 

I used 1 lb of ground turkey, diced 1/2 a red bell pepper and 1/2 a yellow bell pepper, added seeded/diced jalapeno, 1/3 cup salsa, no egg (we didn't have any), 1/4 cup bread crumbs and seasoned with garlic, salt, black pepper, and lemon pepper to taste. (If you want it spicier, add crushed red pepper) It came out delectable and much less runny than the first time when I used both the egg and the salsa. I suggest using one or the other. 

Cooked for 40 mins at 375. Perfect ????

I followed the original recipe, but cooked it with 2 lbs. I ended up cooking it in 2 one pound loafs at 375F for 50 minutes a piece. I checked the internal temperature of the loaf after it was removed from the oven and it was cooked throughly after 50 minutes. The only change I had to do was add some more bread crumbs because the salsa and eggs made it a bit runny. Other than that, this is THE best turkey loaf I have EVER made.

Very easy to mix, I doubled the turkey and bread crumbs. Baked it for 45 minutes at 400 degrees. Nothing amazing, but propbably I'd make this again.

This was very moist and easy to make, choses because I had all the ingredients on hand. Like others, I also increased the cooking time to 50 minutes for a doubled recipe-shaped in a loaf, but put in a 11x13 pan.  My husband and I liked it fine, our somewhat picky children did not...even after I picked out the pieces of peppers.

Not sure why there are no spices indicated in the recipe - turkey needs it, even with the salsa.  Rather than bread crumbs, I used wheat germ. I quadrupled the recipe to 2 lbs turkey (big family) but kept the egg at 1.  Took 90 min to cook through.  Also mixed together ketchup and worchestershire sauce-- spread on top.  Very tasty!

Excellent recipe, really tasty for being so healthy.  The salsa adds a nice kick and really adds to the flavor.  I also doubled the recipe to accomodate 1lb of ground turkey (7% fat; read that ground turkey breast does not work as well) and increased the temp to 375 and cook time to 45 minutes.  Topped with mushrooms with soy sauce glaze (recipe from this site) and it was very good, although next time I will make a mushroom gravy or glaze the loaf with bbq or ketchup.

I am always skeptical of ground turkey...but this was actually really tasty!!! I put some ketchup on the top of it in the last 15 minutes of baking. Also...25 minutes is not nearly enough time. I recommend baking it at 375 degrees for 50 minutes.

This meal was mediocre.  Not because it wasn't a great idea or because it's a bad recipe, but because ground turkey just isn't a good substitute for ground beef in regards to a meat loaf.  It tasted okay when warm, but don't dare take a bite once it's gone cold, or it will taste like cat food. I bet this recipe would be outstanding if lean ground beef were used instead of ground turkey! I've been trying to find good ground turkey recipes but just haven't had much luck.

Great flavor and good portion size for our family of 4. I didn't have any bread crumbs ready so I took the advice of another reviewer and added tabouli, it had a flavor packet in the box with dried herbs so I threw that in there too and it was wonderful and moist! We'll be adding this to our "regular" menu, thanks for sharing!!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I substituted the lemon pepper with some fresh garlic and worcestershire sauce and it turned out fabulous. I also spread some extra salsa over the top of the meatloaf towards the end of the cooking time and it gave it a little extra bite. The other thing I do with meatloaf (and you'll probably think this is weird) is that I place 3 or 4 (unshelled) hard boiled eggs in the middle of the loaf so that when you slice it, every peice comes out with a fun little egg circle in the middle. It also beefs up the volume a little and the twice-cooked eggs turn out really flavourful. Enjoy!

I also chopped up and added some green bell pepper and also sprinkled in some Lawry's Low Sodium Seasoned Salt along with the lemon pepper.  I preheated my oven to 375 degrees and cooked for 1 hour. About 5 minutes before it was done, I added some Sweet Baby Ray's honey BBQ sauce on top and placed the loaf back in the over for the remaining 5 minutes. So delicious.  Yum!!!

I was so glad to come across this recipe. My husband doesn't like beef but I love meatloaf, so this was a great compromise. It was delicious. I used 1.25 lbs of turkey to make one loaf (not sure how a loaf could be used with 1/2 lb) and it made 5 hearty servings. I cooked at 350 for 55 minutes when the turkey reached nearly 180 degrees. I doubled the bread crumbs and added another egg, and served with ketchup and corn on the side. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

This tasted okay but I was not happy with the consistency. It was not a "loaf" like I expected. I let it cook for 45 minutes and it never set up. I doubt I will be making this again.

For a healthy meal, this was exceptional!  It was flavorful, meaty, and moist.  I took the suggestion of most and doubled the meat and veggies, the baked for 55 min.  I also drizzled a sauce (1 T of ketchup and 1 T of woisteshire sauce) on top before baking it.  We put it with egg noodles.  Super yummy!

AMAZING!! soo delish.I changed a bit though; 

I had to double ingredients bc I had 1 lb meat. I did not use lemon pepper and instead of 2 whole eggs I used 1/2 cup of egg white beaters and only one red bell pepper. I also put a bit of bbq sauce on top and then put in the oven. Great Recipe!

I was nervous about making this. I couldn't believe that something made with such simple ingredients could be so delicious. I brought left-overs to work with me the next day. I'm a teacher and all of my students were very jealous of my delicious lunch. haha. They said it smelled amazing. It was very yummy, and healthy too!

Eh - I didn't think this was very flavorful at all.  There are much better recipes out there.  I prefer the one on the back of the onion soup mix box (just substitute ground turkey).

This was VERY good - I was skeptical at first with the mixed reviews, but I was very happy with the result.  Since I only had about 8-9 ounces of ground turkey (cooking for just my husband and myself) I couldn't double the recipe like everyone had said, but it was the perfect portion for two.  I didn't use the peppers, but I did add some garlic powder and ketchup to the mix.  I also put ketchup on the top when it was cooking and it came out great!

I didn't have any salsa on hand so I substituted a can of drained rotel into the mixture (I doubled the recipe) and added thinly sliced roma tomatoes on top instead of ketchup. This is definitely my go-to for meatloaf from now on.

This was the first meatloaf I've ever made and it was excellent!!  I doubled the recipe and substituted the 2 eggs for 3 egg whites.  I also cooked it for an extra 10 minutes to give the top a little crispiness.

I loved this, but the rest of the family was not too impressed.  I normally don't like a lot of peppers, but I thought the flavor was just right in this.  This is another one of those recipes that I probably would have never found had it not been for a recent picture and review by CC, so thank you.  I don't know that I will make this one again because of my family's opinions, but I did really enjoy this at dinner tonight.  Thanks!

I have to say I am very surprised at how good this recipe is.  I am a new ground turkey convert, so I am still rather skeptical when I taste a "ground beef make-over dish."  This turkey loaf is quite moist and flavorful.  I doubled the ingredients, except for the egg, and made it 8 servings rather than 10.  Delicious!

This recipe was very tasty! I am constantly looking for new ways to prepare ground turkey and this recipe is definitely a keeper. As other posters have stated, I doubled the recipe and cooked at 375 degrees for 55 minutes. I also added a clove of minced garlic and a  touch of cilantro. I also used all red peppers because that is what I had on hand. I spread bbq sauce on top of the meatloaf about halfway through the cooking time to keep it moist and to keep it from browning too much. Great recipe! I will definitely make again! Thanks for posting!

The only thing I substituted was Complete Seasoning for the Lemon Pepper.  Amazing flavor and juicy, but yes, I had to leave it at 375º for an hour.  Presentation was fine for me, good in consistency also.  I'll definitely be doing it again and soon because I received lots of compliments on it.  Thanks.

I was skeptical about trying this recipe, however I am so glad I did. I had been wanting to make a meatloaf (craving it) but I wanted something different and healthy because of dieting. My husband said that this was the best meatloaf that he had had in along time. 
I used 2 lbs of ground turkey and proportioned the rest of the ingredients. I did have any bread crumbs, but I had a box of chicken flavored stuffing mix. I crushed the stuffing and measured enough for the turkey.... it turned out great. This is definately a keeper! Thanks Sue.

I really enjoyed this, and yes, it's best NOT to compare it to a beef loaf. I think the amount of flavor depends on the type of salsa you use. I used medium Pace salsa and it was very effective (I've also used the walmart-brand medium salsa, and that was also good.) I did have to cook it for longer, but my oven can't make up its mind as far as accuracy goes. I have served it with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.

I thought this recipe was absolutely awful.  My husband, who will eat almost anything in the world, took one bite and said, "PLEASE don't ever make this again."  My kids refused to take one bite, and I couldn't make myself choke down any either.  It was truly one of the worst recipes I've made in years.

Healthy and delicious alternative to regular beef meatloaf.  Like previous reviewers, I doubled all the ingredients.  The only exception was that I didn't have yellow or red peppers, so I just used the green that I had on hand.  It came out great.  Also, I cooked it for an hour on about 360.

I made a few modifications to the recipe based on other reviews.  I doubled the ingredients except the egg it was super moist and delicious.  I also used oatmeal instead of the breadcrumbs.  for a glaze I used ketchup and brown sugar, my husband loved it.

I (and my husband) was pleasantly surprised at how good this was. I was worried it was going to be a little bland but that was not the case at all. I used a full pound of ground turkey and used seasoned bread crumbs. Other than that, I followed the recipe exact and had very little left-overs!

Yum! I used a mango peach salsa and this recipe came out great. I cooked the loaves in 2 pans (1.3 pounds of turkey) for about an hour.

This was not too exciting. I have only had ground turkey a couple of times before this, so it may be that I just don't like ground turkey. But I thought it was kind of bland. Putting ketchup on it made a big difference, and it tasted much better after that. Also, it took a lot longer to bake than the recipe says, probably about 45 minutes. I probably won't make it again.

I liked that this recipe was healthy but it lacked any real flavor.  I am grateful that I decided to make a sauce for the top (1/3 cup katsup, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp worchester sauce)and put it on at the last minute.  I think the sauce made it better.  Next time I would add more spices.  Using the exact measurements, this did take about an hour to bake.

Wonderful recipe for our low cholesterol diet. I used egg substitute and didn't have peppers so used chopped celery and shredded carrots. I baked it for about 30 minutes. It turned out wonderful.

My husband and I really enjoy this meatloaf recipe.  I make giant cup-cake meatloaf muffins.  It's a great twist because I can easily bring them to work for lunches or even freeze them!  They freeze well too.  I do double the recipe which makes six big meatloaf muffins. The cooking time is 25 mins. in my oven.

Like others, I doubled the recipe. I also added minced garlic, lemon peper and worchestire sauce. Then the last 5 mins before taking it out of the oven I topped it with fresh basil leaves and shredded "mexican mix" cheese.

This turkey loaf won high praise from my  family.  I did not have salsa on hand so I added a 1/4 onion, 2 cloves garlic, and 1/2 can diced tomatoes.   I also split the loaf into 4 small loafs and cooked in mini meatloaf pan.

This was super easy to make and very delicious. Both my children ate it (1 and 3), which is my overall goal when cooking. We ate it with carrots and mashed potatoes. Very yummy and will be making often!

I was looking for a healthy way to fix my ground turkey and came across this recipe.  I've made meatloaf with turkey before but thought this would be a nice change.  It turned out really good!  The only thing I did different was that I used a can of Rotel tomatoes with habenero chilies because I didn't have salsa & didn't want to go to the store.  I made individual servings in a cupcake pan - for a single person, this works GREAT!  Just grab & go.

I had 1.3 pounds of meat, so I used double the ingredients plus a little more.  I cooked this for about 1 hr. and 10 minutes, although it was cooked through within 1 hour.   This is definitely healthy and tastes great dipped in ketchup...I felt that it was a little bland, so I think next time I would add ketchup into the mixture.  However, everyone else that ate it thought it was great the way it was!

This was suprisingly delicious! I don't eat beef so I was looking for a nice substitute -- I've found it. Since ground turkey isn't readily sold here, I chopped up raw turkey breasts and incorporated them into the mix. Also, I used corn flakes instead of bread crumbs. I took off a star for the end result being a little dry. It did help to put some ketchup on top but I would like the loaf to be more moist, especially if serving to guests.

I have not made meatloaf for awhile because I was not having the best luck with the recipes I was using.  After making this tonight and seeing my husbands eyes light up with delight, I know I can make meatloaf again!  Plus using turkey and adding the veggies and salsa makes this so healthy.  I followed other suggestions and doubled everything except for the egg.  Covered the top with a mix of ketchup and Worcestershire sauce, baked uncovered at 375 for approximately 50 minutes.  Served with steamed fresh green beans with salt/pepper/shredded Parmesan cheese and potato wedges.  So delicious!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Even my son 3 years old loves this.  I think it looks a little wierd and so we pour some salsa on top.  We always double it so it makes a regular size loaf.

Very impressed! I always use ground turkey for my meatloaf, but wanted something different - this fit the bill well. I pretty much doubled the recipe & added a layer of salsa to the top 10 minutes before it was done cooking.

Will definately make again!

Turned out great. Substituted Stove Top Stuffing for the breadcrumbs. Baked 50 to 60 min. And covered the top with 1/2 cup chile sauce after 30min. Lots of flavor and still low cal.

This was my first attempt at a turkey loaf. I wasn't really sure what to expect. I had 1lb of ground turkey so I doubled the recipe. I made my own salsa from vegetables from the farmers market. I did not have any dried bread crumbs or the time to make my own so I used crushed crakers instead. I had read the other reviews about the not so great appearance of the loaf so I layered the top with sliced tomato. I adjusted the time since the recipe was doubled and used a meat therm. to make sure it reached at least 165 degrees.  I wasn't really impressed with the texture of the loaf, very mushy, but I am sure that was because I didn't use the bread crumbs or I didn't add enough crushed crakers. Overall the flavor was great. My picky three year old and extremely picky husband loved it. I will make the recipe again but I will be sure to adjust for the texture.

This recipe was great. There is an Italian deli by my house that sells flavored chicken patties that are great but expensive.  This tasted just like them for a fraction of the cost. Healthy & Delicious!! Will definately make again.

This was delicious! I followed other readers' suggestions and doubled the recipe (1/2 pound would not feed my family), however I did not double the egg, I still used just one and it stayed together just fine. I used more peppers than the recipe called for, just because I always try to get my vegetables into my meals. I increased the oven temp to 375 and they were done in about 50 minutes. The only thing that I would change, is that I will add in salt next time, I had to add some to the finished product at the table.

Great flavor, I added a little bit of minced garlic and cilantro. Loved the flavor and texture. It did take a lot more time than it says. I did the 25 mins on 375 degrees but increased it at 400 degrees for an extra .It was worth the wait. My husband loved it = happy wife!

Delicious! I will definitely be making this again. It was moist, flavorful and super easy to put together. I was surprised at how it did not need any salt at all. If you want healthy, flavorful and affordable this is a good one.

My husband is a meat and potatoes guy and I like to eat healthy so this recipe satisfies both of us!  I have been making it for several years now and he is hounding me because I haven't made it in a long time.  I think the lemon pepper is the secret ingredient in this one that really makes is stand out.

It's a keeper!  Adjusted the recipe to accommodate 2 pounds of ground turkey and followed the recipe to the letter.  Delicious.

AMAZING!!! I had to improvise since we didn't have all the ingredients. Instead of peppers I substitued cucumbers and the salsa I had had corn and some other veggies. I didn't use onions. I also had to double the batch since I had more ground turkey and I used 2 eggs.  I baked it for 40 min at 400 then for the last 10 min I added ketchup and worcestershire sauce ontop.  My husband and I LOVED this!! I will def be making this again!!!

Wow, pleasantly surprised with how much flavor this had! I have to admit I was skeptical about the Lemon Pepper, so I only added a couple shakes of Mrs Dash Lemon Pepper...somehow it just works. No salt or regular pepper needed. I used 2 lbs of turkey to fill the pan, 2 eggs and crushed up a little over a cup of whole wheat saltines to bind it....350 for an hour...can't wait for my lunch leftovers :-)amazing!

Not my favorite. Taste was ok. It really matters what food looks like and this did not look appetizing so it's hard to be excited about the taste.

This was very flavorful and moist, maybe a little too moist so we might try adding less salsa to the mixture. Thank you for a wonderfully tasty dish.

I was pleasantly surprised! This tasted just like meatloaf made with ground beef. I doubled the recipe, but forgot to increase to 2 eggs so mine kind of fell apart, but tasted great! Will definitely be making this again!!

This is an awesome recipe.  A great substitute for beef meatloaf.  We omit the peppers and just and a bit more salsa and throw in some onion and garlic powder for taste.  We also mix some ketchup and regular BBQ sauce together and put it on top of the loaf before cooking.  And some tang and flavour to it!

Excellent turkey loaf! My husband, who doesn’t really care for turkey, actually liked this recipe. I used 1½ pound package ground turkey breast, and also, doubled the rest of the recipe. I used ¾ cup old-fashioned oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs. Thank you for sharing.

This was a great, great recipe.  As everyone else said the amount had to be doubled.  I cooked this at about 45 minutes (reached the 165 point before forty but I like it a little crispy on top).  Also I added a little Cayanne pepper subbed egg whites.  Great with BBQ sauce.  Will definitely be making this again VERY soon

This was great!  The only change I made was to double everything and I used all the ingredients listed.  This had an awesome taste, I will be making it again.  The only thing I would caution others about is to be sure and get a lean turkey if you are watching your calories.

Favorite Meatloaf Recipe!!  My husband and I are trying to lose weight and so I was trying to find new ways to use ground turkey.  I came across this recipe and had everything on hand so decided to try it...let me just say I'm so glad I did!!  I've never been much of a meatloaf fan because it always tastes so greasy.  This was not greasy at all, however was still really juicy!  The salsa gave it great flavor, along with the diced bell peppers!  I doubled the recipe and it easily fed my husband and I and our three kids.  Thanks for the tasty and HEALTHY recipe!!

since turkey always seems to shrink so much during cooking I always use at least a pound or more to feed us all. i didnt see lemon pepper at the bottom of the ingredients so i left it out but it sounds terrific.

I loved this recipe! I tweaked it a bit because of the reviews I read, because another recipe also appealed to me, and because of the ingredients I had on hand, and I took it to a party where it was a hit!

Most significantly though, I had to cook it for 90 min before the inside reached 180 degrees, and that included cranking my oven up to 475 for the last half hour.

Changes I made:
- Added allspice, thyme, and 3 minced cloves of garlic
- used italian seasoned bread crumbs
- used italian seasoned ground turkey
- I coated the top with some ketchup

And it went great with mashed potatoes and gravy.

I actually made this just as it's written, without doubling it as most did, simply because I had exactly a half pound of turkey to use up. I chose to bake individually in muffin cups (at the suggested time and temperature). The yield was 6 'muffins'. Quite nice flavor from the salsa and peppers. Moist as well. I would make this again, but it does make more sense to double the recipe and use a full pound of turkey, which is what I would do.

I thought this was a very great and easy recipe! The ingredients are things that I would normally have on hand which made it a perfect quick dinner. I threw in some chopped tomatoes, dried basil, minced garlic, and a little garlic salt to taste and it turned out really great. I also had to make it in a muffin pan since I didn't have a loaf pan for about 35mins thanks to another reviewers recommendation.

My husband couldn't get enough of this.  But I do have some important notes.  Many people use will double this recipe since some packaged ground turkey comes in 1 lb. and 1 lb. also fits a loaf pan.  If you double the recipe, be sure to stick to the exact doubled measurements or it will overflow.  You also have to increase the oven temp to 375 and increase time to 50 - 60 minutes.  I also made a ketchup mix (with worcestershire and salsa) and put it on top with some more sliced onions.  It really is delicious and EASY!

I doubled the recipe and added two cloves of garlic and a few shakes of worcestire sauce. Only used one egg. I put individual portions into a muffin tin and baked in a convection oven on 325 for 37 minutes. It tasted okay - I thought it could have used a little more spice, but I topped with salsa so it was fine. It would be a good idea to top with ketchup or something before baking.

followed recipe as is and ended up with a doughy flavored waste of ground turkey. not being one who waste, had to dump a serious amount of catsup to make it slightly edible.  An example of trying to be healthy and ruining the taste of food to encourage bad eating choices.

Fantastic! I used a black bean and corn salsa.... and also tripled the recipe because we love leftovers. I had never used ground turkey before, but found it very flavorful. The only downside was it didn't hold together as well as a ground beef would- still tasty though. I too mixed ketchup, bbq sauce, and Worcestershire sauce for a glaze on top!

This meatloaf recipe is so simple yet surprisingly good.  I made it exactly as the recipe states, adding a half teaspoon salt to the mixture and spreading barbecue sauce on the top about 15 minutes for it was done.  Delicious!

I thought it was rather boring.  Very little flavor.  I wish I would have added the sauce on top like some of the other reviewers mentioned.

I subbed zucchini and carrot for the bell peppers, Whole Foods 360 marinara sauce instead of the salsa, and doubled the recipe (including the eggs).  I didn't have a loaf pan, so I shaped it "loaf-like" on a baking sheet and cooked for 45 minutes at the suggested temp.  At the end, I added more marinara sauce and havarti cheese.  Fantastic recipe and husband didn't miss the beef at all.

FYI...If this loaf makes five servings and you are only using 1/2 lb. (a.k.a. 8 oz. of meat), each person will get a little over an ounce of actual turkey meat.  In other words, this recipe makes about 5 appetizer-size bites.  I recommend at least doubling the recipe to get 4 servings.

Pretty tasty and very simple, quick to prepare.  I substituted oatmeal for bread crumbs and only had red bell peppers, but it still turned out yummy.  I doubled the recipe to fit in a loaf pan and found that 1 hour at 375 degrees was perfect.

My boyfriend and I gobbled this up for one meal! We ended up doubling the recipe. We also added about 1.5 times the vegetables that the recipe called for. Lastly, we made a sauce to go on the side, with 1/2 cup ketchup, and 1.5 tbsp worcestershire sauce with a few dashes of tabasco sauce. Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful! Not only is it a healthier alternative to beef meatloaf, it has lots of flavor too, especially with the brown sugar and ketchup sauce that we topped it off with, and my family loved it! The praises rang all throughout the meal.

I was impressed by this, however I think it needs more seasoning. As others suggested, I doubled everything but the egg, and baked at 350 for an hour. I also added ketchup and worcestire on top for the last 20 minutes. Also, I used brown rice bread crumbs instead of regular and I liked it much better. I served this with homemade mashed potatos, sweet peas, and broccoli and squash. Very healthy and I will make this again!!

We are on the Zone diet for crossfit and this was perfect. I used about 3/4lb. ground turkey. Only had green pepper, but will use red and or yellow next time. Used fresh bread crumbs (and only about scant 1/4 cup).  Baked for about 40 minutes. Plated it with fresh spinach. Yum. My husband said it was his favorite "zone" meal.

I loved this!  I doubled all ingredients except for the egg, and cooked 375 for 55 minutes as suggested by others.  Very moist.  Good flavor.  I can't wait to put it in a sandwich tomorrow.

I used chicken mince, (all I had) instead of turkey and added some extra ingredients and it was incredible. I only had about 500grams of chicken mince, so I needed to bulk it up and I wanted to add veges into the meatloaf. I used about 1/2 cup of diced frozen veg, 1/4 cup of frozen peas, 1/4 diced bell pepper, minced garlic, a whole egg, lots more breadcrumbs and some splashes of light soy and worcestershire sauce. I spread a tomato, brown sugar mix on top and it was amazing served with a warm beetroot salad and baguette. Kids ate it all and dh was so quiet over the table...too busy eating.lol.

Very tasty!  I used a pound of ground turkey, added chopped jalepeno (love spicy), woozy sauce, and topped it off with a dallop of salsa. They baked up nice and crispy on the outside in the muffin pan.

My family loves this meatloaf! However I do beleive that the amount of turkey called for in the recipe is a misprint because 1/2 lbs is not even a burger size in some households. So to make this loaf for our family of 5 (3 adults, 2 small kids) I used 2 1/2 lbs ground turkey. And it made a normal sized meatloaf. Also, because we have a pepper dislike in our family I just used the salsa and added a little garlic powder and basil leaves to the mixture and increased the eggs to 2.

I've recently started taking an interest in cooking and I have much to learn. I have also been trying to clean up my diet with healthier meals and I must say this recipe is not only healthy but delicous, it came out quite well. I used a medium flavored salsa which gave it just alittle bit of spice and taseted great. Just dont make the same mistake I did if you double the amount your making don't forget to double the cooking time.

I'm not really a big fan of traditional meatloaf, but am always looking for new ways to use ground turkey and thought I'd give this a try.  It was really good!My husband loved it, so I'm sure I'll be making it again.  After reading the reviews, I doubled the recipe to fit in a loaf pan.  I also doubled the amount of bread crumbs to 1 cup and had no problems with the consistency of the loaf.  I baked it for one hour and it was nicely cooked through.  I only used green bell pepper instead of red and yellow, just because that was what I had on hand.  Instead of lemon pepper I added some fresh, minced garlic for extra flavor.  Halfway through cooking, I brushed the top of the loaf with pasta sauce.  The result was delicious.

this was absolutely amazing.  My boyfriend was skeptical when I told him about this recipe but we both loved it  - this is hands down one of my favorite recipes.  I changed it a little by adding a dash of worchestershire and a clove of garlic.  Also it took much longer to cook for them than listed here, probably an extra 45 minutes so watch carefully. We served it with green beans sauteed in olive oil and fresh mint and my mashed potatoes.

Husband and I loved this. I did add peaches & pineapple salsa to the turkey. It is sweet and very spicy. Added some lime and garlic salsa to the top of the turkey loaf with a little ketchup to the top of the loaf so it did not burn. Added a little red pepper cut up fine needed to use before it went bad. Very good. Also I used whole wheat bread soaked in orange juice and then torn up as the bread. Very good. Husband liked this one the best ever.. Thank you

Just made this for the first time, and my husband and I loved it! We did double the recipe, and made a few substitutions:
- cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs
- tomato and onion tossed in the food processor instead of the salsa and bell peppers
- Southwestern seasoning, red chili powder and mustard powder instead of lemon pepper
It was delicious and since I recently started Weight Watchers, I was delighted that it's only 2 points per serving!

It is hard to believe that this has 5 servings from 1/2 lb of ground turkey.  I use 2 lbs to feed my family of five...though we usually have just enough leftover for a couple sandwiches.

this was really delicious, increased turkey to 1 lb and left it in the oven for about 50 minutes, also subbed the yellow pepper for green since that's what I had, and used red onion ! also, formed a loaf but put it in a shallow pyrex dish to bake, turned out kinda crunchy and yummy !!

We really liked this.  At the suggestion of others, I doubled it so it fit in the loaf pan; this increased the cooking time to 45 minutes.  I used a green chile salsa and roasted garlic bread crumbs, plus I threw in some garlic powder for good measure.

I really like this recipe, it was easy to prepare and very flavorful.  My husband liked it too, which is pretty surprising - he doesn't like "healthy" foods!  This is something I will definitely make again in the future.

Unfortunately, this was not a hit in my home.  It lacked flavor and we cook with turkey all the time.  Probably will not make again although it does seem like a very healthy recipe.

I was really impressed!  This meatloaf was very tasty - who could believe it was healthy as well?  The best part was that my 2 yr old son gobbled it up.  Definitely a meal for the whole family. (BTW - I substituted ground chicken.)

I've made other recipes for turkey loaf, and my fiance loved this one the best. The salsa made it stay moist, and the best part is that it is healthy!

The recipe was really good.  Not quite as good as beef - but so much healthier.  I added some mustard, extra green and red peppers, and a little more salsa for extra flavor!

Great recipe for a "non-beef loaf"! Mild flavor but with a little tang. Serve with ketchup or salsa or add a little spice to the recipe. Very tasty with a festive appearance!

So delicious! I made this for my family and they absolutely loved it. Great taste and great consistency. I was worried that there would be a lack in taste, typical for a turkey substitution, but it was packed full of flavor. I doubled everything except the egg. Decided to bake for 50 min and made a sauce of 1 Tb Worcestershire sauce and 1 Tb ketchup which was poured over the loaf 5 min before taking it out of the oven. Also, instead of the lemon pepper seasoning I added garlic and wine seasoning. The only thing different I would do next time is triple the recipe as I didn't feel as though it filled the tummies of all 3 of us. At least not mine!

My wife and I have failed miserably when using ground turkey in the past, but this one was a success. We used 1.25 of ground turkey which filled loaf pan. We doing bled plus the ingredients and added garlic powder a little Tony's and cooked it 375 for 45 minutes, very easy and very tasty . This will be done again

I made this using my muffin pan and even my 1 year old loved it!  It was really easy to make and took 30 min start to finish including making a side of veg stir fried rice (rice was already cooked from previous meal so just had to stir fry).

This wasn't too bad. I can't imagine making a meatloaf only using 1/2 lb of meat though. So, I doubled the recipe to get a standard size. I ended up having to cook it near 50 minutes like my ground beef meatloaf. I did about 45 minutes in the oven, on the temp suggested, and then browned the top on a low broil for about 5 minutes. I still found the center a bit watery with all of the vegetables. I did 1/2 tsp of lemon pepper. It doesn't say. My only other change was adding about 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder. I lined a sheet pan with foil, sprayed with PAM, and just shaped it on there. Saved on clean-up time. When done this badly screamed for some type of tomato or other sauce for the top. I am sure this will all be eaten, but I am still on the hunt for the perfect meaty turkey meatloaf.

so, this is not your 'ol style meatloaf BUT it is super tasty, super moist and my picky husband fell in love with it!  it has been requested as a weekly dish in our home.  as a trainer, i approve!  i used whole wheat breadcrumbs and Mateo's salsa. Also, I double or triple the recipe since i have five kids...and divide into two loaves in one baking dish.  i bake for 60-70 minutes.  This is awesome warmed up or cold as leftovers...LOVE IT!

We LOVED this! Used hot salsa, made it very spicy and wonderful. However, I did have to bake for about 2 times as long as the recipe says. Made just enough for two people. I also recommend adding a ketchup glaze to it :)

Pretty good! I followed others' suggestions and doubled the recipe and changed the cooking time to 50 minutes. Next time I would probably beat the eggs before adding them to the mixture. I'll be making it again:)

I made this meatloaf and it was delish. I just added a teaspoon of minced garlic, some onion powder, garlic powder, a little salt, and black pepper instead of lemon pepper. I also used liquid eggs pace pico de gallo. I must say it was delish again.

This has been made and re-made so many times in my home I cant even count, best turkey loaf recipe. The only adjustment I made was I doubled the recipe and used only 1 egg & I added a 1/2 cup of chopped potatoes to keep everything moist. Must try!

It really wasn't very good.  The flavor was odd.  As my husband said, it was "interesting".  I've had worse things, but if I had to place it one side or the other of good and bad, it would fall on the bad side.  I definitely won't be repeating and wish we didn't have leftovers for meals this week.

This was my first time making a meatloaf and I loved it!  I added various powdered spices and doubled the recipe, which resulted in a very flavorful meatloaf. I also poured a little bbq sauce over the meatloaf during the last 10 mins of cooking time. The only thing it lacked was the yellow bell pepper because I didn't have any. I am definitely going to use this recipe again.

I decided to double the recipe before reading the reviews and used 2 eggs, when I should have clearly stuck with one.  Other than that it was pretty good.  My husband liked the texture the peppers added and I liked the fact that even though it was falling apart it was moist instead of dense and dry like the other turkey meatloaf I tried to make.  I topped the meatloaf with another recipe from this site (Bob's BBQ) and we really liked what that added too.  We'll be giving this another try for sure.

This was easy to throw together and pop in the oven with some baked potatoes.  A good hearty meal.  I added some italian turkey sausage (half pound) to bulk up the amount and add some flavor.

Oh wow!!!  I had high hopes for this and wasn't disappointed one bit.  I couldn't find ground turkey at the grocery store (huh??) so instead I bought turkey sausages and crumbled them up after removing from the casings.  The additional spicing of the sausages put this OVER THE TOP yummo!  I too doubled everything except the egg, and just before popping in the oven I put another lick of salsa on top.

Like everybody else, I doubled the recipe except for the egg, and baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  Used green bell peppers only and hot salsa.  There is no way that the original recipe is 5 servings...our "10" servings was enough for 3 adults (although one went back for seconds).  Very very good, and very light.  Will make this again and again.

ETA: It's important to use 99% fat free ground turkey and regardless of how long you bake it, make sure the internal temperature is 160 degrees. Both help with the crumbling problem others have mentioned.

I doubled all the ingredients including the egg. We like a lot of peppers and onions at our house so I doubled those again. Ended up with a cup of onion and a cup of green pepper instead of the red and yellow. This turkey loaf had a good flavor. It was a little bit crunbly but not so much that I won't make it again. Left out the lemon pepper. Baked at 350 for 1 hour in a 5x9 loaf pan. Very delicious considering how healthy it is.

I did the same as other reviewers and doubled the recipe but used only one egg.  I put a couple of splashes of worcestershire sauce and a sprinkle of garlic powder but other than that followed the recipe.  I did have to cook for about 50 mins.  This came out delicious - my husband and I both loved it.  It's a keeper!

First, I doubled the ingredients just to fill ONE loaf pan. After putting it in the pan, I refridgerated it for about 2-3 hours (I had other stuff in the oven) and the loaf got really juicy and soggy. When I tried to get it out of the pan to serve, the whole thing fell apart in a mushy mess. Flavor was okay... I think I'll stick to my other turkey loaf recipe.

Loved it. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled all ingredients except the egg. I also added extra vegetables -- green and yellow zucchini and mushrooms -- and tripled the salsa as suggested by one reviewer. After one hour there was too much liquid remaining, so I stuck the loaf back in the oven for another 15 minutes. Next time I will still double everything, but won't triple the salsa. I topped the loaf with ketchup and some grated cheese. It was delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent recipe!!  I've never enjoyed using turkey meat for my meatloaf but this was amazing.  I doubled everything except for the egg as others suggested and I also added a few shakes of worcestershire sauce and some creole seasoning for extra flavor.  Don't skip this one!!

I doubled the recipe, used green pepper instead of the red and yellow because it was more economical, left out the lemon pepper entirely but added some fresh mozzarella cheese to the mix and topped it with ketchup (what is meatloaf without ketchup, right?)  I would make this again in a second, very moist and not too expensive.

Good flavor, but was very mushy.  Maybe I did something wrong. I was not comfortable serving as is, so I chopped it up and quick pan fried it to get some of the excess juice out.  Then wrapped it up in tortillas for dinner.  Everyone loved it, but it did not work as planned. :(

I've made this recipe several times and think it's delicious!  As others have said, it's good to double the recipe (I do double the egg, unlike many other reviewers) and bake for ~50 minutes; it'll fit nicely in a loaf pan.  DON'T LEAVE OUT THE SALSA.  I just accidentally did that this most recent time (I'm eating the resulting product now...) and the loaf turns out much drier.  Plus, the salsa adds great flavor.  I usually serve this with ketchup, which I squirt on after baking.  The recipe is great as it is!  Flavorful but not too heavy or fatty :)

Delicious! This dish is a big hit with my whole family. I doubled the recipe, used egg beaters and green bell peppers because that's what I had. I baked it at 375 for about an hour. I will use more bread crumbs next time because there was a little extra liquid.

Fantastic! One of the best recipes I've found on this site.  I doubled the turkey, though I still used just one egg, and cooked it for about an hour.  So easy and tasty.

Very moist!  Did not use a sauce because the flavor was so good without anything!  When I doubled the recipe, the time to cook doubled as well.  Maybe try going to 375 to shorten the time. I also only used a 9x9 pan instead of the loaf pan.

I've made this before, but always in the oven.  This week I tried it in the slow cooker and it was much better!  I put a few crumpled pieces of foil at the bottom of the slow cooker (enough to keep the meatloaf off the bottom) and it turned out beautifully!  This is how I will make it all the time. Oh, and I poured salsa on top of the meatloaf at the beginning.

major hit with my family!  Amazing taste!  I used 2 pounds ground turkey and I doubled the egg and salsa and used 2 full sleeves of saltines, crushed.  Super good!

This is a very good recipe.  The only changes I made was to use all green pepper (didn't have the others on hand)and added a bit extra bread crumbs (as others suggested).  It turned out very good!

I really enjoyed this!  I added Italian bread crumbs instead of plain.  It added a lot of spices.  I too made this with 1 lb ground turkey, and it needed to be cooked a lot longer, closer to 1 hour.  I loved it, and will be making it again and again!

I doubled this recipe, used green peppers instead of red and yellow, used only one egg, and added an extra 1/2 cup of oatmeal in addition to the bread crumbs. I  a little katsup and Worcestershire sauce and topped the loaf before baking, and baked it for 50 minutes at 400. It was awesome! I made it for company (there were 4 of us total, including 2 big guys, and we had not left over!

This was really good.  I doubled the recipe (cooked for 1 hour).  I used egg beaters, but only 1 eggs worth.  The only other change I made was that I added 1 clove of garlic and several good shakes of Smoked Chipotle Tabasco sauce(which adds a great smokey flavor to anything!).  About half way thru, I added ketchup mixed with salsa to the top to make it look better.  Truely a fantastic low fat meal!

This is a great recipe for ground turkey loaf.  I changed it a little and left out the salsa.  I used tomato sauce and doubled the tomatoes, bell peppers, and onions. It won't replace the taste of beef meat loaf, but its much healthier and still tastes good.

Just finished it!  Wonderful.  I used a little over a lb. of meat (93% lean), and doubled everything except the egg.  And because I like things spicy, (omitted lemon pepper--had none), I added about 5 dashes of the following: crushed red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, pepper, and dried basil.  Also used salsa with black beans.  Cooked at 375 for 45 min.  I doubt it's healthy in the amount I just ate!!

LOVED IT!!! I made mine in a cupcake pan. I only had to cook them for 20 minutes and they were perfect serving sizes, plus it was really fun. I doubled the recipe and it turned out scrumptious! I am having left overs tonight!

I made the healthy turkey loaf last night for the first time...I was concerned because my husband is a 'meat and potatoes' kind of guy and I didn't think he'd go for it.  He LOVED it! We'll definitely be using this again.

I really liked the taste of this and the fact that it is more healthy.  I took the advice of using wheat germ instead of the bread crumbs and enjoyed that.

Like many others, I had a pound of turkey so I doubled the recipe. I was disappointed in the lack of flavor and the consistency of the loaf - it fell apart when I cut into it. I'm sure it's healthy, but I doubt I'll make it again.

I added parmesan to this recipe, kind of defeating the healthy part, but it was very tasty. It just took a little longer to cook with the extra moisture the cheese produced. This was great out of the pan, and again the next day when I crumbled it and added it to a pizza I made.

surprisingly delicious!  my only complaint is that it isn't terribly attractive (kind of olive-loaf-y).  i will definitely be making this again, and might try some kind of a tomato-based glaze on the next one to make it a little more attractive.

I give this one FIVE stars!  It was really good and VERY easy!  I have been trying to find ways to eat more lean meat but I DO NOT eat beef.  This is perfect!  I used Pepperidge Farm dry stuffing in place of the bread crumbs, used a whole bell pepper and added a bit of garlic too and -wow!- really good!  I'm so glad it made enough for my lunch today... yum, yum!

If you compare this meat loaf to a loaf made with ground beef, maybe you will be disappointed.  But for healthy eating and great taste, it's a definite winner.  I doubled the recipe and was exceptionally happy with the results!  It was moist, tasty, and for those that appreciate such things, nice looking.  The colored peppers contribute a nice appearance and add to the taste and consistency.  I had left over turkey loaf on whole wheat bread for a delicious lunch sandwich yesterday and expect to do the same again for today!

This needs a much longer cooking time. My oven is very accurate, and I had to cook this almost twice as long. Tasted good, though.

I really liked this recipe. I added some mushrooms because they needed to be used. 
By varying the types of salsa this can be different every time. 
This time I had Trader Joe's pepita salsa. Delicious!
Thanks for a new go-to recipe!

Loved it. Changed it some. Used 2 shallots along with the onions. Doubled the recipe. Used 1/2 jar of Harry and David pepper relish in lieu of salsa. Added 1 package sweet Italian turkey sausage. Cooked for 70 minutes on 375. So flavorful. Really great. Thanks

Fantastic!!! Doubled the recipe and added a small amount of ketchup on top for taste. Quick to prepare and came out REALLY good. Nice healthy take on one of my favorite comfort foods.

I made this for our Mothers Day dinner and it was really good! I can’t eat peppers anymore so I had to eliminate them from the recipe. I added mushrooms and hominy instead. I love lemon pepper so I added a bit more. Hubby really liked it! (He ate 2/3 of the loaf!) Thanks for the recipe! I’m making this again!

I made it for the night before and for a potluck dinner at the church I attend and people loved it. I threw in about half a cup of freshly cut spinach and I thought that went well. I think I might have to give this recipe to some of the ladies at church. :D

It took a lot longer to cook than stated but I did cook it in a loaf tin. It was more like 50 minutes at 200 degrees centigrade. Also I added some paprika and chilli to the mixture for a little kick as I find turkey quite bland.

Great recipe and pretty easy, even my picky 4yr old asked for seconds.  I sauteed all my onions, and bell peppers together and i added fresh diced jalapenos to 1/4 of the loaf since i love spicy. Super delicious!

I was quite surprised how delicious this turned out.  This is the first time I had made a meat loaf with turkey.  Fortunately I had read some of the other comments about how different turkey meat is to cook versus beef.  Had I not read these I would have put it in a loaf pan like beef, which means it would have been a disaster.

I have a turkey meatloaf for a long time.  But I add 1/2 # of ground chuck  and this seems to dry the excess grease left by the chuck.  I make my own breadcrumbs with winning Dixie garlic cheese croutons  by crumbling them up in my blender.  Instead of using  bell  peppers I use pimento (a small jar) but I drain the juice.  I like your recipe but I also like to experiment with recipes.  My husband and I are diabetics so we have to watch sugars and carbs.  So this way we get a great recipe and different vareasons( spelling sorry).  I have made Meatloaf's out of salmon and grouper, cod, and other types of fish.  We live about quarter of a mile from Henry Neeley lake in Alabama and croppie, bass and bream make good Meatloaf's or muffin tin meals.  Meatloafs do not have to be just beef, turkey chicken or fish but also deer.  Try it.  Don't be afraid to experience with any recipe.  Have fun.

I used 1 lb of ground turkey and doubled the other ingredients. It took a little over 50 mins. It's really yummy. Next time I think ill add more lemon pepper. Good recipe, thanks!

I make this everytime instead of beef meatloaf. The salsa gives it a nice spice. One of my favorite recipes I've tried on here. I slice up some onionrings  to place along the top with a little ketchup.

I make this and bring it in to the office for lunch. Every time, with out fail, coworkers want to try it because it smells so amazing. It is pretty tasty. I add onion powder and garlic powder to enhance the flavor. Today, I added cumin to see what that does to it!

Used ground turkey. Needed WAY more time than 45 minutes. It was wet and the turkey wasn't close to being cooked at 45 min. When we finally took it out it was quite tasty. I think next time I will not put the salsa in the mix, add more on top and use more bread crumbs.

I really like this meatloaf!! I use organic turkey, organic peppers, organic salsa, an organic egg and Bob's Red Mill wheat germ for this recipe.
I also cook it for 40- 50 minutes at 375 degrees. Thanks for posting this recipe on this site!!

I made this with a 20-oz package of ground turkey, so I multiplied everything by about 2.5, except the egg (still used only one). And I used Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, which were the only ones I had. The lemon pepper I have is salt-free, so the salt in the crumbs wasn't too much.

I made a loaf, smeared ketchup over it, and baked it for an hour, just as I would for a beef loaf. It was kind of soft, but it tasted yummy. Next time I might increase the bread crumbs to stiffen it up a bit, but that's all.

This is a very tasty version of meatloaf. I also doubled the recipe. I also hard boil 3 eggs and lay them whole unshelled in the center of the loaf. My mom did it to her meatloaf when I was a kid and it's so tasty to have a piece of hard boiled egg in the center! I make a glaze for the top with ketchup, BBQ sauce, and Worcester sauce.

My favorite thing to make. I use the Jennie Os taco seasoned ground turkey to give it a little more flavor but it is great. My family and fiance love it.

I thought it was pretty good, however I am not one to follow recipes to a T and instead get ideas of ingredients together and work it out myself.  So my version was three packs or Costco ground turkey, one red pepper, one yellow pepper, half an onion, 4 cloves garlic, two eggs, a 1/4 cup salsa and some bread crumbs (and crackers as I was low on bread crumbs).  I did them in muffin pans so I could freeze them individually to grab throughout the week as needed.  Also I sautéed the veggies first. I cooked at 350 for about 35 minutes.  Everyone here enjoyed them.

Amazing turkey meatloaf recipe! The only change I made was that I used a jar of roasted red peppers instead of a single red one since I didn't have any on hand. The lemon pepper was a perfect addition and I will be making this again and again.

This meatloaf is amazing! I too doubled all ingredients except the egg. I was able to make 3 mini loafs in 3in X 5in loaf pans. The meatloaf has tons of flavor and is very moist!

Quick, easy, tasty, and makes  the perfect amount for 2 people. It makes a nice sandwich the next day if you have leftovers. The only thing I did differently was I used all green peppers because that's what I had on hand.

This is a perfect meatloaf to satisfy those old school comfort food cravings.  To make it a bit more healthy I substitute the breadcrumbs with 1/4C quinoa (and then I cook it) as well as adding another few tablespoons of uncooked quinoa to the mixture to soak up all of the juices.  Wow, it tastes fab and has a totally normal texture.  You dont miss the breadcrumbs at all and you have just saved yourself a bunch of carbs.

I used ground turkey and quick cooking oats instead and it turned out great! Next time I'll need to use 2lbs of turkey to fit the pan but other than that I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was amazing! I was a tad skeptical at first (probably because I am that way whenever I cook/bake anything), but it turned out wonderfully! I also used a full 1 lb. of ground turkey, which was "extra lean," doubled the rest of the ingredients, added some green bell peppers in addition to the red and yellow, and doubled the cooking time to 50 minutes. I liked this better than regular meatloaf, and I don't feel guilty about eating it! Will make again...once the leftovers are gone :)

Very good, definitely took more than 25 min to cook though. I used 1lb of ground turkey and it took 45min at 375. I was worried about the recipe being too bland so I added cumin, oregano, garlic, worcestshire sauce to the meat mix and a glaze of ketchup/mustard/sugar on top of the loaf before baking. My only issue with the final product was that there was quite a bit of liquid in the pan after baking, not sure how to fix that. Overall very good and will definitely make again.

Low calorie, healthy, good protein.  I like preparing these and storing in freezer for a quick meal.  I add half a jalapeno pepper chopped, no seeds. Cooks for me in 30 minutes in 8 x 4 x 2.5 disposable loaf pan. Be careful not to undercook.

I really enjoyed this healthier meatloaf option, and it is packed with great flavor, something different and a nice changeup from the same old meatloaf all the time. I made it for a work potluck the 2nd time since everyone is trying to lose weight at the office. It was definitely a hit!

This was the first time making anything with ground turkey, but been looking for healthier foods to try. I had last minute company coming over so I decided to give it a go, I made 2 lbs for 2 families so I changed the amounts in the ingredients, I doubled the peppers and onions, added 3 eggs, 1 1/4 cup salsa, and added the breadcrumbs until I got the texture I was comfortable with probably around 2 1/2 cups I really wasn't measuring. cooked it on 400 degrees for an hour and 10 minutes, It was absolutely DEVINE!!!!!  Everyone liked except some picky kids but overall complete success.  Thanks for posting this,in the future I won't be afraid of ground turkey recipes, because we love it sooo much better than regular meatloaf!!!!

I doubled everything, substituted granulated garlic for the lemon pepper and used a 12 x 8 pan instead of a loaf pan and it was done in 50 minutes. I usually smother my beef loaf in ketchup before baking, but this was flavorful all by itself. My husband raved!  Yay, I found something healthy that we both like!!

Made this today.  I used 2 lbs of Turkey and that gave me 18 large cupcake sizes.  So, definitely do not use only 1/2 pounds, won't feed 4 people.  I used one red bell pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper, 1 onion, cup of Salsa, cup of cooked quinoa instead of breadcrumbs and a package of  mushrooms which I first sautéed, plus about 1/4 cup of chopped celery.  3 eggs.  Delicious, will make again!

Good fora healthy version of meatloaf, but really was not attractive to eat. Then again, as long as something tastes good, it doesn't really matter too much what it loos like.

nice and quick meatloaf.  Sometimes I make it with half turkey half extra lean ground beef.  It seems to bind better that way and everyone in my family likes a  non- crumbly meat loaf.  I use red bell peppers not both colors because it hides from the kids better that way. They will totally pick out the yellow ones if I use them.  I also usually grind up flavored croutons instead of just using plain bread. This is a great "use whatever is on hand" recipe.

This meatloaf is fantastic. I doubled the recipe and increased the cook time by 15 minutes. Highly recommended.

This is a good base recipe. I lightly sauted the onion and bell pepper first and also added garlic into my saute'. To hold in flavor I add a spaghetti or tomato sauce to the top. I also season the entire mix w/ cilantro, basil or whatever I'm in the mood for!

This is a pretty tasty meatloaf.  I usually find that turkey needs quite a bit of seasoning, but the recipe had quite a bit of flavor as is.  The only change I made, per the suggestion of another reviewer, was to made a shallow "dent" or a line run down the meatloaf where I put bbq sauce.  Mixed bbq sauce and worchester sauce for a glaze on the top.  My husband used bbq for dipping afterward.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved the recipe. I did double it and cook it for one hour on 375 as someone previously suggested. I also added a tomato glaze on top. But even without the glaze it was moist and juicy.

What a delicious and easy dish.  The salsa gives it an nice flavour and it was very moist. I also used the recipe to make turkey burgers instead of a loaf - yum!

I doubled the recipe except for the egg and baked for about 1 hour. I had left it for my husband to eat because I was gone, and he told me he couldn't eat it because it was "slimy". I tried it the next day for lunch and ate half the loaf! I thought it was great for as healthy as it is! I don't know what his deal was (he's had turkey meat before), but I vote it as delicious- better than I was expecting! Definitely worth a try, and I will make again- he can suck it up!

The ingredients from your recipe sounded very good.  I should have put in double the salsa.  It was just too dry, but I thank you for this recipe anyway.

This was great! I loved it, my toddler loved it, and my meatloaf-hating husband actually liked it too. The original amounts in the recipe was enough for my family of three. I used bruschetta mix instead of salsa since that's what I had on hand. Turned out great!

My husband and I both think this is a great meatloaf!  Sometimes I put pieces of jalapeño cheese within it for a sneaky surprise!  Great recipe; good served with rice cooked in mexican style canned tomatoes.

This was really good. I didn't have any salsa, so just used ketchup and no yellow pepper. I just used red and green bell peppers instead. Will definitely make again.

I have to say my family and I did not care for this meatloaf. I doubled all the ingredients (including the egg) and it did not hold together well. I even cooked for much longer than rec but it turned into mush on our plates.

Easy to make, and my husband really liked it. I don't see how it could possibly feed 5 people, though with the amounts listed. I would think it would be more like 2 servings. Delicious, nontheless. Thanks!

i doubled the recipe as was suggested and added a handful of shredded carrots. it was great! very easy. i made it in a loaf pan in the toaster oven, 350 for 40 minutes. also, i omitted the red pepper (the ones at the store looked gross) and doubled the yellow. next time i'll try leaving out 1 egg.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I substituted the onion soup with a few seasoning choices of my own and went ahead and made it with Ketchup inside the Loaf, then topped it with the Salsa.  I have family members alergic to peppers and onions so I needed the Salsa to be optional for those who wanted it and those that didn't.  
I cooked it in the slow cooker and it turned out really well.  you wouldn't know it was turkey instead of beef.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. It was excellent. I did follow the recipe, but did make adjustments. I added red onions and diced fresh mushrooms to the recipe. I also added a crumbled vegetable bullion along with crumbled 12 grain whole wheat bread. Finally I topped the loaf with worstershire sauce. My beef eating husband loved the meatloaf. I will definitely make again.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I added 1 packet of onion soup mix, and excluded the bread crumbs.  I also baked these in a muffin pan so I could have pre-measured servings.  I will definitely be making this more often.  This also tastes great on a sandwich!

This was really good. I added grated carots, and used egg beaters.  and also put about 1/4 pound of ex. lean hamburger to help it bind a bit better, and tops with ketchup and sprinkles a little low fat cheese on top.   Yum !!

The think I've found with turkey meatloaf is that it tends to be dry so I combine a leaner cut of ground beef with the ground turkey.  Works well for burgers also.  Another problem that I've had with using ground turkey alone is the lack of flavor so doubling up on seasoning is a must for us.  If your using only turkey be sure to use enough seasoning so that you can actually smell the aromas before it's cooked.  I've also used a bit of liquid smoke flavoring and it comes out quite well.

This turkey loaf was VERY good. I wasn't sure what to expect, after reading the reviews, but if you are trying to eat healthy and on a diet, then this will taste awesome!!! I did double it and cooked it longer, if you are feeding more then one person, I really suggest doubling it!!

This meatloaf was excellent, very flavorful, and I don't even like ground turkey.  I took the advice of some other member reviews and doubled the recipe in order to get a whole loaf.  I also added a little cheese to my meat mixture before baking.  If you're looking for something lean, this is the recipe for you.

This was so good!!!! I didn't have either peppers and it was still good. I doubled the recipe and added some garlic powder and a little brown sugar. Cooked it at 375 for 55 minutes. This is way better than ground beef. Loved it and will make it a part of our favorite recipes.

Awesome!  My fiance and I are on a diet and this was an excellent meal!  He's hard to please but he really enjoyed this dish.  The only thing I did differently was that I doubled the bread crumbs.  Made it stay together nicely which may have been the problem in some of the other reviews I read.

I followed everyone else's advice to double the recipe and bake at 400 for an hour.  Someone else suggested added sliced tomatos on top which I also really liked.  I also added cilantro for a little more kick.  It was flavorful and had a great texture.  It also made really good leftovers.  Even my anti-health food boyfriend loved it and wanted it again the next week.

Great recipe, one of my staples now.
DO NOT ADD WHEAT GERM (as other userssuggested)- TASTES HORRIBLE!

This was okay but pretty bland.  I followed the recipe to a T and I had to almost double the cooking time, too.  I think I'll go back to my old turkey loaf recipe that I keep in my head - no salsa, add mushrooms, garlic, worchestershire, cayenne pepper - YUM! Wish I had stuck with my standby but live and learn, right?

This recipe took longer to cook than anticipated more like 45 minutes.  After waiting that long we were not impressed.  I will not make this recipe again.

good starter recipe that can be tweaked to ones preference.  i added a couple of tablespoons of cottage cheese.  it sounds wierd, but it helps to keep the turkey moist.

Excellent recipe!  It can be hard finding healthy recipes that taste good, and I'm so glad I found this one.  Hubby absolutely loved this and enjoyed leftovers for lunch the next day!  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent.  I made this for my 88 year-old grandparents rather than my usual beef & sausage meatloaf and they loved it.  I love it, too.  Red & yellow peppers from last year's garden made it perfect. It definitely must be cooked longer than 25 minutes (more like 45 minutes).
