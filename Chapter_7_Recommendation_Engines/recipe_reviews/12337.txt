As the previous reviewer noted, this is Very Dry, But, that is how it is intended to be. I have a similiar version of this recipe that has been handed down Many generations of my Husband's family which uses "Basket" or "Farmers" Cheese. Hard Salami, Peppered Ham and Pepperoni. Ours does not include the Pasta (although is does sound interesting!) It is a Tradition all of us girls get together to make for Easter.

This was very dry.  I think the whole family would like it, but you REALLY need to add some pasta or pizza sauce.
