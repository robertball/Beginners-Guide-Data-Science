Not enough spices for me.  I added garlic after I sauted the onion, and then added more basil, and some oregano and some parsley to it.  I thought it was much better after that.  I also don't like my pasta overcooked, so I added uncooked pasta to the soup base during the second step and let it cook together for about 30 minutes.  I also don't like overcooked celery, so I added that in at the third step.

This was kind of bland but, once I got the season's put together it was all right. Something I will make again but, next time I think I will use chopped tomatoes with spices and stuff in it and not whole.  It's great if you don't have any money (as I often do) and nothing in the house to eat.

This was great for a base recipe, but pretty bland on it's own.  I added hot sauce to it for flavor.

I enjoyed this soup. It is almost like pasta e ceci, without the carrots. I did add extra vegetables but not any spices or seasonings. As written, the recipe delivers a simple and traditional style Italian soup meaning that it doesn't contain a lot of spices instead allowing the flavour of the ingredients to shine through. The flavours of the tomatoes, onion and celery are evident and "gustoso". Adding a few more veggies added some flair. Thank you Rachel for your recipe.

Read the reviews before I made this so I also added garlic, carrots, used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of water  and 1/2 cup of uncooked pasta. Delicious,

The second time I made this recipe I used cooked lentils instead of chickpeas and I also added some greens from my garden (specifically tat soi). I enjoyed it better this way.
