Absolutely the best crisp I've ever made.  I used about ten medium Cortland apples, which are kind of tart, I added a tsp of vanilla, and I made one and half times the amounts for the crisp part.  It totally filled a Pampered Chef 9x13 stoneware dish.  This recipe was just wonderful.  I served it to company who couldn't get enough, I shared with neighbors who raved, and my family ate it for dessert a couple of nights in a row.  Just lucious!!  Try this one - you won't be sorry!

Bingo! This recipe works. OK, it’s roughhewn enough for we guys to take a hack at it, here are some guy tricks to cover a variety of Macho Mistakes. You forgot to set out the butter for 10 minutes so it can soften? Recovery: Place the BIG mixing bowl on the stove over the oven that’s heating. That will soften the butter as you mix. Get the BIGGIST whisk you have and use it to knock the chunks of butter down to pea sized bits. Stop mixing at this point. DO NOT pre-melt the butter. DO NOT whisk the butter until you have a smooth mixture. This stops the crisp and makes dough. Recovery: If you do the dough thing, serve with bigger glasses of milk OR use more cream on the dish. HINT: If you serve the dish warm, then put the cream you’re going to pour on it in the microwave on 40% power for 1 minute to knock off the chill. DO NOT boil the cream. More HINTS: (1) Cut slices no finer than about 1/4” thick; it helps them to retain “apple-ness”. (2) After you put the bottom layer of crisp in the baking dish and pour in the apples, PRESS the apples down into the crisp and then press the top layer of crisp dough down into the apples as well. DO NOT crush the apples. The apples will flavor the dough a bit, and there’ll be a better crisp to apple slice ratio as well. (3) DO hold about a ¼ cup of the sugar to pour directly on the apple slices in a bowl and then mix well. (4) DO NOT bake till crust is brown. STOP when apples are tender. Manly Kitchen Mess Rating: No better than 2 out of 10.

I used 1 1/2 cups of flour, 3 quarts of Gala apples and tossed the apples with a sugar and cinnamon mix. Very good recipe! Also learned to slice the apples  not so thin otherwise they become to tender and mushy. Thank you for the recipe!

Being a novice cook/baker, I followed this recipe to a "T".  Well, the other reviewers are right...it definitely needs less flour, and it could be a little sweeter.  Needs more apples, too.  I think this recipe could be a 5 star with a little tweaking.  Follow the advice of the other reviewers;  they're right!  Less flour, more apples.  It was good, but I definitely wouldn't say it was excellent.

SOOOOOOO GOOD! I used 11 med apples (a combo of Macintosh, golden, empire & granny), and 1 1/2c flour. I added chopped pecans to the topping. Everyone at work loved it! I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  I won't bother ever using another recipe. THANK YOU!

I have a good stand-by recipe for apple crisp but wanted to try something new.  This turned out to be a delicious alternative! I did make some adjustments: I used 4 medium-sized apples (with a little lemon juice, vanilla, cinnamon, and brown sugar tossed in) and a bag of frozen mixed berries. I used 1 1/3 cups of flour and 2 1/3 cups of oats, as another reviewer suggested. Turned out very tasty!

It was the crunchiness I was looking for, and the subtle sweetness that apple crisp should have!  I scaled it down to only 6 servings, and it was still wonderful.  It was so easy too!  Between the amazing taste and ease of this apple crisp, I'll never try another recipe.  I've found my favorite.

I made this dish to take to potluck at church and everybody loved it and it was not dry.  When I was making it, I thought the recipe had said 1 1/2 sticks of butter, but it says 1 1/2 cups of butter.  Maybe others who said it was too dry misread the recipe.

Fabulous!  I have had people tell me that this is the best apple crisp they ever ate!  I love to make it is huge batches, because it never lasts very long around here no matter how much I make.

My boyfriend asked me to make him Apple Crisp for his b-day instead of cake because he hates cake. I was a little nervous because he's picky about his apple crisp. He said it was the best apple crisp he has ever had in his life. I used a little less flour (maybe 1 and a half cups instead of 2) and tossed the apples in cinnamon and sugar about an hour before I made it. That brought out the juices in the apples more. I also sprinkled cinnamon on the top of it all before I put it in the oven to give it a nice brownish color. The crust on top and bottom really made it because isn't that the best part of apple crisp anyway!?! I will never make another crisp recipe besides this one again! Thank you so much!
****UPDATE***I still make this recipe for my HUSBAND now....he still brags about it to everyone!

I gave this recipe a 4 because I changed a few things. I baked the bottom crust on 350, for 10 minutes, by itself. Then in a bowl,I combined  1/2 C.white sugar,1/4 C brown sugar, 4 T.Cinnamon. I tossed the apples in this mixture,making sure all of the apples were coated well. Place in baking dish. Then I melted 1/2 C butter and then added 2t.lemon juice together. Drizzle over apple mixture. Then add crumb topping,which I doubled.  I baked  in a 9x13 baking dish. I always receive raves reviews. Thank you

Best Apple Crisp recipe of them all.  Family loves it.  Will make it tomorrow for our belated Thanksgiving.  We like ours a bit thicker so I make in a 9x9 instead of the 9x13 and follow all the other suggestions.

I was looking for a "different and hearty" apple crisp and used this one since the oatmeal appealed to me. I only gave it 3 stars because I used the recipe more as a guide since I could tell it needed more. I knew it would be dry as others have stated since nothing is done or added to the apples. The instructions are vague and assume the cook knows exactly what to do. If a beginner followed this recipe I could see a lot of errors happening.

Here are the changes I made: I cut the flower down to 1.5 cups and increased the oats to 2.5 cups. I love cinnamon so I increased it to 1 Tbs. I used the full amount of butter but used it cold cut in 1/2" cubes like you would in pie crust and cut the mix as you would a pie crust to pea size crumble. I used 10 med. apples (considerably more than 2 quarts) and tossed them with 1 Tbs. of lemon juice, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 Tbs. of cinnamon. I rested the apples to form liquid and strained out the liquid before adding the apples over 1/3 or the crumble slightly packed on the bottom of the baking dish. I whisked 3 Tbs. of corn starch (I would have used tapioca but didn't have any) to the strained liquid and drizzled over the apples before crumbling the remaining 2/3 of the crumble over the top. I baked it longer at 1 hour and rested the crisp for an hour before serving.

It came out AWESOME!! Very juicy thickened sauce. I found my new apple crisp recipe! The family raved and said it was the BEST they ever had!

I would talk more about this fabulous recipe, but I'm busy shoving this delicious apple crisp into my pie hole! Mmmmmmmm. I followed the recipe to the "T" and it is absolutely luscious. Don't CHANGE a thing--unless it's to add more apples & cinnamon. This is wonderful. Thanks!

I don't put the topping on the bottom anymore because it got soggy, and I add vanilla and brown sugar to the apple layer. Excellent Recipe!

I couldn't decide whether or not to make the Apple Crisp II, or this recipe, since both got good reviews.  However, it seemed like everyone was changing the Apple Crisp II recipe to make it better.  I decided to combine them!  I made the topping for this recipe (just added some pecans)and loved the double layers on the finished product!!  For the apple layer, I just tossed them with 1/2 C sugar, 2 T flour, and 1 tsp cinnamon before adding them.  Doing this gave the apples more flavor.  I might even increase the flour a little next time to help with the small amount of liquid that cooks out of the apples.  My whole family really loved this recipe, even though they usually think a dessert has to be chocolate.

This is just like the one I already made but the measurements were different, It made more topping so that was a plus. For a twist, add butterscotch chips to the apples and you have a caramel apple crisp, kids love it.

I halved this recipe and made it in a 9x9 dish. I used white sugar instead of brown because that's all I had (will use brown next time). I baked at 400 for 30 minutes because I didn't want to wait almost a whole hour (had company) and it turned out incredible!  What's best is that I had everything on hand to make this at the last moment without a trip to the store. It was devoured! Will be making this again for sure!

This is very good.  I gave it four stars because I did take a few suggestions from the other reviews.  I cut the flour by 1/2 cup, used only 1 cup of butter and one cup of sugar...I just felt like 1 1/2 cups of sugar was way too much.  I used 5 green apples to balance out the amount of crisp this recipe yields. I also tossed the apples in lemon juice and sprinkled white sugar on them before putting them in the pan. 
It turned out well, the crisp was crisp and the apples were tender and juicy.  
Overall, very yummy!!!!

As is, I'd give the recipe 3-stars. I think this recipe makes a good guide for apple crisp, though.  I followed the instructions as written the first time. It was a bit dry and not much flavor. After making some adjustments it was definitely a 5-star recipe. I sprinkled the apples with lemon juice and tossed them with cinnamon and sugar. I didn't put any of the crumble mixture on the bottom, and just put the apples in. I like a lot of crisp, so just put all the crumble mixture on top. The apples were very juicy and had lots of flavor. The crumble was perfect and crispy. My son loved it! I also brought it to work for a pot luck and it was a big hit--there were no leftovers to take home! I made it several times this way last year, and I can't wait to make some more after I take my little girl apple picking this year!!

Not only was this wonderful with apples, I also tried it with pears and it was delicious.  Since I had a lot of fruit on hand, I made several of each and froze them unbaked in aluminum pans.

Exceptional recipe. Taking the advice of other reviews I cut back on the flour. The difference in turn-out as reviewed by others probably more to do with the type of apples used. Some have more moisture than others.  Here's a great tip: After putting 1/2 the crisp on the bottom of the pan, add finely chopped nuts for the top.  I used both pecans and walnuts. What a delight!

INCREDIBLE WITH THESE TWEAKS. Instead of 2 cups of flour use 1/2 cup flour and 1 -1/2 cup of Panko, add a 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves and 1/8 to a 1/4 cup of sliced almonds.  Use 15 medium apples. With these changes the reciepe could be served in a five star resturant.  Place in a ramkin that has been sprayed with non stick spray.

This was really delicious.  I only had 4 apples so I halved the recipe and baked in a 8x8.  Although it could have taken another apple or two, it was awesome right out of the oven with some warm caramel sauce drizzled over the top!

Try using Apples & Cinnamon Instant Oatmeal instead of regular Oats. It adds a little something extra to the taste.

I made this recipe but tweaked it a little.  They should change the recipe to read *3* sticks of butter, so to cut down on the confusion.  I like my apple crisp to be sweet and thick so I added 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup cornstarch to the apple mixture.  It gave it a more "apple pie" consistancy.  I used very tart granny smiths from my back yard so they needed the extra sugar.  This was an awesome turn out-no left overs!

Great recipe, my family loved it.  Lots of topping and oats, which we love.  I cut the flour to 1.5c and added 2.5c of oats.  I also cut the butter to 1c (2 sticks).  I thought the amount of butter was fine, not to dry.  I also tossed the apples in cinnamon and added 1c of cranberries.  I used about 10 apples.  I'll try adding a touch of vanilla next time.  This is a great base recipe that you can tweak to your liking.  Enjoy.

This was pretty good.  I halved everything and used an 8" square pan.  Might not be a bad idea to spray the pan first.  After I put the apples in I sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar.  Might cut back a tad on the butter next time.  Thanks for an easy throw together recipe! :)

I always read reviews prior to baking anything from this site.  I followed other's advice and used 1 1/3 cup flour and 2 1/3 cup oats . . . I also tossed the apples in lemon juice, cinnamon, brown sugar, and a little nutmeg.  Loved this part of it . . . a definite must!  THe crumb mixture was way too "buttery" and not crumbly enough so I added in at least another 1/3 cup flour and 1/3 cup oats.  I used real butter too and wonder if that made a difference.  I added and mixed until I had a moist crumb.  I personally thought the two layers were too much. I did use lots of apples per the other's advice. I put in at least 9 cups of apples.  I will next time use lots more apples and put a thick crumb mixture on top only . . . I think it will be plenty! Other than those changes the taste was great. Don't hesitate to add in a pinch of allspice!

This is a very good recipe if you like lots of crust, which I do.  You have to add lemon juice to the apples, with a little water and cornstarch. Cook until nearly boiling and pour over bottom crust.  I also added pecans to the crust!!

This was absolutely wonderful!  I did go ahead and add some sugar, cinnamon, and a little flour to my apples to give it the flavor that my family of sweet tooths prefer.  It turned out great, I'll be making this again and again!  Thanks!

The best ever! Just came out of the oven - cooked perfectly. Cut the flour by 1/2 cup per many reviews, and mixed the apples with some lemon juice, sugar and cinnamon before layering between the crisp mix. I also added a lot more apple and sliced them thick. So GOOD! My new favorite fall recipe.

This tastes just like my mom's Apple Crisp .. I reduced the flour a bit and added a little more oatmeal. I also omitted the nutmeg and I sprinkled a little brown sugar and cinnamon on the apples before I put them in the pan. It was very good .. especially with vanilla ice cream  :)

This recipe looked easiest and most similar to the version I grew up with. I ended up about 1 cup shy on the apples, and I'm amazed that people say it needs more! I think it was absolutely perfect the way I made it! I had trouble, after emptying my dish of it, tearing myself away from the pan--I just kept wanting to eat more! This one will be taken to family gatherings--thank you!

Not too shabby, however I decided to mix some of the brown sugar in with the layers of apples to make it a bit sweeter. Otherwise it's a pretty good recipie.

Delicious!! This is a very good recipe, made half of this wish I had enough to make the full batch. I followed a few reviews, I put cinnamon & sugar on the apples because I like saucy things and I used tart apples, I ran out of brown sugar so I used some white sugar too. I think next time Im going to make more of the cumble for the bottom. My boyfriend said "you need to make this once a week!"  Its definitely a hit in our house! Thanks!

Was very good but still needs tweaking to fit my family's taste.  I had no problems with dryness as many others stated but my apples were a bit too tart and recipe doesn't specify which type of apples to use.  I Used 6 Granny Smith apples and 1 Gala.  I sprinkled lots of cinnamon and sugar on the apples before adding topping as others suggested and it was still pretty tart.  SO, if you are using Granny Smith DEF. add more sugar than you think it needs when mixing with apples.  I will add more next time!   As for the "crisp" part on the top only.  It was good but not as crumbly or crisp as I'd hoped.  I know this recipe has potential to be a 5 instead of the 4  rated it and I will update when I get it right! :)

I have to say that I am generally one of those people who like to try to original recipe as listed FIRST and will make changes from there before rating anything- seems only fair to me!  :D  This recipe is a GREAT recipe as is!!  The alteration that I made was totally unintentional, but I LOVED the way it came out, so I thought I would share.  I was planning to make this recipe as is, since it always turns out great that way, however, when I went to add the oats, I found that I was OUT!!  Dessert had already been promised, and hubby had been sent to the store for ice cream...  sooo... I looked around in the pantry and saw  Quaker Simple Harvest instant oatmeal in Maple Brown Sugar w/ pecans flavor.  I decided to try it- added same amount as recipe called for (5 packets I think...) and it was AMAZING!!!  The oatmeal, I actually DIDN'T like for breakfast...  but I will be buying it again just to use in this recipe!  Enjoy!  :D

So delicious!  The easiest apple crisp I've ever made and the best. I do agree it needs more apples. I made mine in a 7 x 11 glass baking dish and recalculated the servings to 12 and used five large apples and it could have used at least one more. The double crust is fantastic and was just as crisp the next day. A real keeper.

The crumbly mixture was good, but the apples were not cooked down very soft and were still rather crispy. I didn't slice them very thin, like another reviewer suggested. I think if I had tossed the apple slices in some sugar and lemon juice, it would have drawn out the juices more and cooked it down better. But it was very easy and my 4 year old and I had fun making it together. Topped it with a scoop of ice cream and everybody loves it!

Excellent! We made a couple small changes: added 4 more apples, and left out 1/2 cup of flour. Next time we might add a little more cinnamon. Best apple crisp ever!

This was really a great recipe.  The only modification I made was a trick my grandmother used to do.  I added a little fresh lemon juice to the apples, then coated them with a little extra brown sugar.  Thanks!

Very good.  Some of the reviews I read cut back on the flour.  I don't recommend it as I think the topping would be to sticky.  My apples were tart, so the tossed them with sugar and cinnamon.

Made this Saturday and I was really pumped about it.  I used four Granny Smith apples and cut them in chunks. I loved the topping/crust but the apples was too mushy.  I'm weird like that, I like them a little firm or whatever.  I had them in there for the exact cooking time.  I will make again but don't want to leave it in the oven for too long.

Very good. I just thought it needed more cinnamon-probably sprinkled on the apples. Liked the creamy filling.

YUM! My favorite apple crisp recipe by far! I cut the "crisp" part down to 1c flour, 1.5c oats, and 2 sticks butter (with a couple dashes of the nutmeg and cinnamon). I also tossed my apples with cinnamon and sugar to give it a bit more flavor. Will make this recipe over and over!

I even followed the recommendations to reduce flour and it was still doughy!  I did not like this at all.

Oh this recipe was awesome!  I had only about eight apples - mixed variety - that I had misfortunately dropped and severly bruised as soon as I brought them home.  This cooked for a little over an hour and it was well worth the wait.  Phenomenal.  I hate baking as I never measure anything; however, despite that--I CUT BUTTER IN WITH A PASTRY CUTTER and I WILL make this again.  I am from the South and this is better than any Southern apple cobber/dumplings I've ever had.  WELL DONE!  Thank you!!!

This recipe has turned out GRAND!!! just make sure NOT to melt the butter as I did ( accidently) but in cooking there really cant be accidents! :(  if melted butter is used ..... your dessert will come out oily and chewy!! Other than that I have had no problem, This is a Family recipe now! Rhonda you rock ..... your recipe is a great HIT!

Very good. I modified by using oat flour instead of wheat flour (just blend oats in the blender) so my daughter, who's allergic to wheat, could eat it too. I also prepped the apples by adding a 1/2 c of apple cider, 2 Tbls of lemon juice, 1/2 c brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to them prior to putting in the pan. I also added more cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust mixture, along with a pinch of cloves. Very very good.

I loved this recipe.  I followed some of the other reviews and my grandma and I just loved this.  She thought it was a bit dry without the ice cream, but it was just right for me.  I'm the kind of person that likes less filling but more of the crust, so when I only had 6 medium apples in the fridge that needed to be used, it was okay.  I first let the peeled and sliced apples sit in enough lemon juice to make a little puddle in the bottom of the bowl, and sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon (to your taste).  I stirred the apple lemon combination periodically while I was preparing the crisp.  For the crisp I used only 1 1/2 cups self-rising flour (didn't have all purpose, but it worked just fine), 2 1/2 cups quick rolled oats, 1 heaping teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon allspice.  Hint:  for those who don't have the patients to continue cutting the butter into the dry mixture, try mixing and mushing it together with your hands until mixed and then use the fork to scrape into little pieces.  This worked really well for me and it sped the process up.  After I assembled the bottom layer of the crisp and the layer of apples, I took to lemon juice mixture that was in the bottom of the bowl and spooned it over the apples, then I sprinked the apples with more sugar and cinnamon before adding the top layer of crisp.  Baked for about 47 min. and YUMMY!  Couldn't stay away from the pan!  Next time I will try to use some of our home canned apples and see how that turn

This was an awesome recipe. The whole family just loved it. The crisp on the bottom is what made it extra special. I used a little less butter to try and make it a little healthier. I just made a second one and this time I tossed the apples with some cinnamon, nutmeg and 2 tbsp white sugar. In reading some reviews I see that some recommended to use less flour, so I tried this batch with 2/3 c less flour and increased the oats by 1/3 c. Absolutely delicious!

I took the advice of the other reviews to cut the brown sugar down by 1/2 cup cups and to also cut the flower down to 1-1/2 cups.  The other thing I followed from another review was to let the apples set in some lemon juice, cinnamon, and 1 tbsp of Vanilla before putting them in with the crisp.  I also added some splenda to the apples (I used Cortlands cut about 1/4" thick) ahead of time to let them sweeten up a little. The things that I added turned out amazing.  I took about 1/2 cup of toasted almonds and corsely ground them in my food processer.  I sprinkled 1/2 of the almonds down on top of the bottom layer of crisp, put the apples down, then I used 1 cup of dried cranberries in with the apples.  To keep the apples moist in the baking, i took some honey and just went back and forth a couple times over the apples.  Put the top layer of crisp on, then Sprinkled the top with the remainder of the almonds. This turned out amazing!  I made it for a football party, and it was the first thing gone!  The Almonds added a nice cruch and nutty flavor, the apples were nice and sweet, and the whole thing was nice and moist.  I will definitely make this one again!

Three words. YUMMY! Crispy! Chewy! The perfect combination of flavors with not gooey cinnamon/syrup to complicate the apples. Our new family favorite!

Tasted great but thought that the crumb mix only needed to be on top and not on the bottom of the pan. That would mean less fat.

This is the best apple crisp I have ever eaten.  The topping is the best part so instead of putting half the mixture on the bottom of the pan, I just put it all on top.  Fabulous!

I have to tell a story about this one!!!  We are currently living in Israel, and I have a Russian friend here who "never eats homemade cake" (I think you have to be Russian to understand this!  Oh, and any dessert is "cake".) After a mutual friend finally convinced her to taste this recipe at a potluck, she said (in Hebrew) "Now, I understand everything!"  and had a big serving of it.  As far as I know this is the first time my cooking has ever made anyone see the light! :) Thanks, Rhonda!  Oh, and I loved the double crust.  That's what you eat apple crisp for, right?

This recipe was delicious. I decided to toss the sliced apples in a half cup of brown sugar and a couple spoonfuls of cinnamon and it definitely added an extra kick to it. However, I ended up cooking the dish an extra 30mins to get the right crunch and the apples tender enough. I used red delicious and it was delicious indeed!

I only gave it four stars because I didn't follow the recipe to a *T*. But what went in my mouth was DEF. a 5 star!! : ). The only two things I changed were in the flour and butter. I added 1 cup selfrising white and 1 c whole wheat. In the batter I cut in 1 1/2 *sticks* NOT cups of butter, then on the very top I melted the other half stick and poured in on the top. My children have asked me to PLEASE make again ;). Thanks for the recipe!!!

Very nice but I made a few changes that were suggested by previous reviews. I used 1.5 cups of flour instead of the suggested 2 cups. In addition, I added 1 tsp vanilla. I cut my apples a bit too large and they were pretty crunchy when eating but still very yummy. I plan to make this again soon.

Yummy!  I suggest after taking it out of the oven, let it sit for 30 mins to firm up.  Some portions were still soggy but crisped up when I let it sit.

I loved this recipe...but I made one small change.  I did not use the bottom layer of crumb mixture, only the apples and a top layer, which allows you to make half the crumb mixture.  Otherwise I thought having two layers was a little too sweet.

Delicious! I cut the recipe in thirds so that it only serves 6.  Only used 1/2 cup of flour and 2 granny-smith apples along with 2 fuji apples.  Very good.

I used only 1-1/3 cup flour and 1-1/2 cup oats, as noted by other reviewers and the crisp came out really great.  I thought it needed a little something, though, so that's why I gave it only 4 stars.  Next time, I may add some apple pie spice.  Also, I mixed Granny Smith apples with some small Red Delicious apples.  The Granny Smiths needed about another 15 minutes of cook time to soften up.  Other than that, it came out really good.  Thanks!

Love this ...you can even make it in a pie dish  and you have a beautiful pie without a bottom crust. It was even better the day after, cut into wedges and served as a pie. I'm even going to try this with half peaches and half apples. I used farm fresh gala apples. Thanks, great recipie.

this was quite delicious - even though I made with low cal margarine and added a bit of wheat/oat bran to the rolled oats - if you cook with butter, i'm sure you'll find this outstanding!

Great recipe! Only reason I am giving it four stars instead of 5 is because I found there was a bit too much crisp and not enough apple (for my taste)

I thought this is an excellent apple crisp recipe. It was buttery and delicious.  I think this recipe as too much topping to apple ratio.  Maybe this is why other reviewers said it was dry, or too much flour. It is a "crisp" after all and should taste like crumbly cookies I guess. If you cut back on the flour and oats and keep the butter the same that will not work.  I don't but a bottom crust on which means I had even more crust.  Anyway it is delicious and now my go to recipe for a crisp.

Amazing.  Simply amazing.  I didn't have nutmeg on hand so I added a pinch each of ginger and cloves and it tasted wonderful.  My 15 year old son and 3 of his hollow-legged friends just consumed half the pan for an after school snack.  :)  This will definitely become a permanent recipe in my family's cookbook.  Thanks for posting!

This crisp was delectable! I used 10 apples, and my family and I looooooved it. I'm not great with measurements like quarts :D but I saw other used 10-11 and it turned out great. Totally delicious. I don't know why other people didn't like it. Mine was awesome and I followed the recipe to the T.

This is amazing, absolutely perfect.  I did cut back on the flour and add a little more oats, but besides that, I followed it exactly and it was terrific.  I used Golden Delicious apples cut in 1/4" slices - be sure to cut them thck so they hold their shape and don't get mushy, they are so much better like that.

Wow, finally a recipe that I didn't have to modify in any way, right down to the time in the oven. Everyone gobbled this right up and I found myself going for seconds after the guests left.  I served hot out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla bean ice-cream.

I think this is very good. Perhaps a little too sweet for some people, but my family and I like it that way. Great as a side dish for parties or a dessert for any meal!

I made this for a friends birthday party, he loves apple pie but I wanted something a bit different.  It was a huge hit.  I soaked the apples in cinnamon, sugar and half of the nutmeg in the refer for a couple of hours. Made the granny smiths wonderfully juicy and sweet. I will continue to make this for any occasion.

This is my new favourite recipe!  I make mine in the food processor.  I just halve the recipe for the bottom and then add in the second half for the top.  It makes mixing the butter so easy!  I also change out the fruit to whatever I have on hand.  Today it will be a can of blueberry pie filling with fresh apples and cranberries!  YUM!

Everyone loved it paired with vanilla ice cream. I dumped all ingredients into my food processor and pulsed till I got the consistency I liked. Then I dumped that on to my peeled, cored, and sliced apples and delish!  One tip. I used red delicious because it was what I had on hand (rookie mistake)  Granny smith is what I'll use when I make this again and again!! The tart of the Granny Smith against the brown sugar and cinnamon should be perfect. P.S. I doubled the cinnamon and added a teaspoon of real vanilla extract to appeal to my families taste. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was fabulous.  I used about 9 medium sized macintosh apples (they did get very soft after cooking) and like the other reviewers, I only added 1 1/2 cups flour, and it turned out perfect! Took to a potluck and everyone raved!

The thing I love about this crisp recipe is that the best part of the crisp is the topping (for me at least!) and this is the first one I've seen that gives me a double layer of it!  I'd sadly never thought to do that myself.  I followed other reviewers advice and only used 1.5c of flour, turned out perfect!

The "crisp" part of this recipe is tasty but a bit too much "crisp" and not enough apple.  It was very dry.  I think crisp on the top only would be better.  I used Macintosh apples and they were juicy when peeling them, but the end result was dry.

Great recipe with a lot of potential, i.e. different prep ideas. I sliced 6 or so fresh apples, some oj dashed over to keep from browning, just basically 'thew' the other ing. in there without much measuring. Great idea! Next time I will try pressing 1/2 oat mix on bottom.

I made 1/2 a recipe for 6 people and it was more than enough. I didn't layer it, and I did add lemon juice to the apples. Everyone raved about it! I made it the morning of the dinner, and then put it in the oven to warm while we were eating. Don't forget the 2X churned low-fat vanilla ice cream, wonderful with it!

This is the BEST apple crisp recipe I have ever tried, and I have tried many. Wouldn't change a thing. This is my new recipe and I can stop trying new ones. Thank you so much! The crust on the bottom is so nice and stays crisp, which is the problem with so many apple crisp recipes.

I followed the other reviewers' advice and cut the flour in half. I also cut the recipe in half and baked it in an 8x8 dish.

Other than those changes, I followed the recipe. It's extremely yummy.

The best recipe for apple crisp I have ever tried! Easy and perfect, my family loved it.  I'm tossing my old apple crisp recipes and replacing them with this one.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe b/c I had too many cut and peeled apples left over from another recipe.  I halved the recipe b/c I already had a pie baking.  It was delicious!  Just the right amount of apples, crunchiness and sweetness.  Def would make again and again!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I scaled the recipe down by half. It made the house smell absolutely wonderful!  I followed some of the recommendations suggested by some of the others and it turned out perfect.  I tossed the apples in vanilla and cinnamon sugar and added a little more cinnamon and brown sugar to the crust.

This recipe was the best, I would personally make a little less crisp. Also, I made it with only 1 cup of MELTED butter, instead of 1 1/2. But this was sooo good and sooo easy.

This was excellent!  I cut the recipe in half and made it in an 8x8" pan.  For the half recipe I used 1/2 Splenda Brown Sugar Blend and 1/4 cup Sugar Twin Brown Sugar Substitute and it turned out perfect.  Thank you for a KEEPER!!!

Absolutely DELICIOUS.  I've already heard requests to make more.  I was a little concerned at first because my butter wasn't crumbling very well and tended to stay in big clumps, leaving some of the topping looking very floury before baking.  But it all turned out wonderfully.  I did use most of the adjustments suggested by other reviewers, including 1 1/3 c flour, 2 1/3 c oats, and tossing the apple slices in lemon juice, cinnamon, vanilla and brown sugar.  I will use this a LOT!

Yum!  I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan, used whole wheat flour and cut back on it by a quarter like other reviewers suggested.  I used the same amount of spices like I would have if I was making a full batch and substituted pumpkin pie spice for nutmeg.  It was very thick the 8x8 would have easily served 6 people, maybe even 8.

I am not that big on baking and this recipe was great. I  do love to cook and this was super easy and tasted great. My whole family enjoyed it. It's a great alternative for homemade apple pie and a lot easier and  less time comsuming.

MikePhx said to press the top layer of crisp down into the apples... I'd be a little careful with that cause it can make the topping go hard when baked instead of nice and tender and crumbly.  I suppose it does need to be patted down a little so as to hold together, just be careful not to press is down too hard.

This was probably the easiest apple crisp that I have ever made. The crust like layer on the bottom of the pan is a really simple idea. It ensures that you get some "crisp" along with each bite of apple. I wondered if the 9x13 pan would be too much, however, the panful didn't last long at all! It truly is tasty either warm or cold. Definitely will be my new go-to recipe.

I was in a hurry so I used canned apple filling for apple pies, so I didn't need to do all the prework to the apples. Really all you have to do is make the crisp part, add the canned apples and then top it and cook it.I also doubled the topping recipe and put it on top and bottom! I topped it with a vanilla ice cream and a drissl of carmel. My family loved it.

This is an excellent recipe. I did make modifications due to the fact I didn't have fresh apples on hand. I halved the flour/oatmeal mixture and used one can of apple pie filling instead of fresh apples. I spread the apple pie filling in the bottom of a one and a half quart round pyrex baking dish(you could use a 9x9 baking dish), then I sprinkled the flour/oatmeal mixture on top and baked it for 15-20 minutes in a 350 degree oven. It was delicious and I'm not a huge apple fan! If you like apples, definitely increase the apple pie filling to two cans. Using the canned pie filling also makes this quick and easy. Serve warm with whipped topping...mmmm yummy!

I halved the recipe except for the apples and only put the mixture on the top. I softened the butter in the microwave until it was almost all melted. Used a mix of Granny Smith and fuji apples. Sprayed the 9 x 13 baking dish with PAM. This was a big hit at church, and received compliments from young and old. This was a hit with the friend who can't have dairy and two other friends who wanted something with fruit. 
My mother used to make apple crisp when I was a kid and this is the closest recipe I have found.

Very Yummy with vanilla ice cream!

I stewed the apples first by simply boiling in water and white sugar. This cut cooking time right down and sweetened the apples. I only used the crumble on the top only because that's how I'd always had it.

Ok, I tried to make this even healtier. I used brown sugar Splenda and whole wheat flour with organic oats and didn't use all the butter and really was still quite good. Will make again.

I followed the recommendations of othes and reduced the amount of oat and flour -- big mistake.  Not enough topping and didn't give that "crisp" feeling.  The next time I used the full amount and I think its important to note that the recipe calls for 1.5 CUPS of butter NOT STICKS...with 1.5 cups, you need as much topping as the recipe calls for.  I just worked the butter into the crumble with my hands until it appeared uniform. (I don't have patience to "cut" the butter in).  I used 1/2 honey crisp apples and 1/2 gala...it was crisp and delicious!!!

Should of read the other reviews, not sure what I was thinking.   Too much flour was dry topping.  I substituted a couple apples for a couple pears.   I will defiantly try this again see if I can tweak and get it to that five star rating

I've made this recipe for YEARS and my family and I absolutely love it. For a fun twist, sometimes I'll add a layer of butterscotch chips.

We had a lot of leftover fruit after a birthday party.  I had a half gallon bag of diced apples and kiwi.  I used this recipe minus the nutmeg and switched the brown sugar for white sugar.  SUPER YUMMY.

The ratios for this recipe were perfect.  It was the right amount of topping, and it gave the right amount of sweetness.  I cubed the apples instead of slicing them, but no major changes other than that.

I can never seem to get apple crisp quite right. But for me this recipe was perfect. My husband thought there wasn't enough apple but he still really liked it. I will be making this again for sure.

My new favorite apple crisp. I did cut down on the butter and flour as suggested by other reviewers. I think next time I will bake in a deeper dish so there is more apple filling in each serving.

Winner. I used 4 Granny Smith and 4 Gala apples and that pan was packed as full as possible. Mine had to bake an additional 25 minutes for the apples to get tender, but once they were it was fantastic. Definitely eat this warm, and definitely do not make ahead. I did that. I made it the night before and it just got a bit soggy, but still good heated up.

I accidentally made this with 1 1/2 sticks of butter initially, but read a couple reviews and it seemed to be a common mistake.  Once I realized I didn't add enough butter, I grabbed a stick, chopped it, and threw it back on the top of the dish.  I put it in the oven for an additional 5 minutes and it was still delicious!  I will surely make this many times!

This recipe is absolutely delicious and also tastes fabulous with blueberries. But I only use 1 1/4 cups of butter. That makes it crispier which I prefer. Also you have less calories as a positive side effect. YUM

Everyone loved it! I chose to put less butter (2 sticks instead of 3) and put a little apple sauce instead to make sure it was all moist.

Yum, everyone I have served this to loves it :)  Classic simple and delicious.  I made the recipe as-is the first time, but the second time I melted the butter first and then added it to the mix.  I also used whole wheat flour (you can't tell at all) and added 1/2 tsp salt.  PERFECT!  I think this is my new standard crisp recipe.

I made this exactly as the recipes is presented and it is the BEST!  No kidding.  I consider myself to be a pretty good baker, but my husband doesn't seem to LOVE anything I make,but he devoured almost the entire pan.    Take the time to mix the butter in really well, that's the key!  Best served hot with ice cream, or cold with coffee.

Made this for a fall fair get together with my son's homeschool group.  Everyone loved it!  Next time I might add some cinnamon & sugar to the apples to give them a little sweetner.

I admit I sometimes have trouble with my apple crisp/pie being dry so I did an experiment when I made this. I made half of it with Granny Smith apples and half with Fuji. The half with granny smith turned out moist and the half with fuji was dry. I guess this could be better using baking apples although the recipe doesn't specify.

This crisp got rave reviews from my camping friends.  I cooked this in a charcoal-powered box oven, and we couldn't have asked for a better dessert on a chilly night.  I prepped the apples the day before: peeled & chopped Granny Smith & Empire apples, added some lemon juice, lots of cinnamon and some turbinado sugar... put this all in a gallon ziplock and  kept it chilled.  I also prepped the dry ingredients a day early, I didn't use nutmeg.  At the camp site, I added Earth Balance margarine to the dry ingredients - mixed it in the bag.  I baked this in a disposable aluminum baking dish.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I only had to bake mine a bit longer because of the apples I used but other than that, I did not change a thing. People who have said there is too much flour are likely not incorporating the butter enough into the dry ingredients....takes a bit of time and I usually end up using my hands to do it. Just make sure your BUTTER is cold (butter, not margarine). My family thanks you for the great recipe!! :)

OMG this was THE BEST apple crisp ever!!! Followed to the letter and it turned out perfect, I agree with some of the other posters... if it turned out wrong, you did something wrong. The recipe is perfect.  For those having a hard time with the crumble my advice would be using the exact amount of ingredients cutting the butter in with two knives or the proper utensil and then finishing it off by  hand... yes, it's messy but it's the best way I've found.

I just made this crisp and I believe it is exactly what I was looking for. The crunch and texture was perfect. I made it with Macintosh from Maine, I cannot wait to try it.

Even using less flour, this came out awfully dry.  I think I'm used to a recipe that has more liquid in it so I probably won't use this again.

Epic Fail. This is not a recipe for apple crisp. It is a recipe for apples covered with oats and sugar. It left our mouths and hearts dry with disappointment.

This was quite good, but not the best ever. I prefer mine a bit sticky/gooey and this is more of a dry crisp. I am still on the lookout for the perfect apple crisp!

Definitely the best apple crips I've ever made! My husband agrees. The double crumb layer is PERFECT!  I only made one change: I reduced the butter by 1/4 c. with no problems.  Might try reducing it by a full 1/2 c. next time to lessen the waistline guilt.

I really liked it, cut the flour down to 1 1/2 cups, added a little more brown sugar because there was only a small amount left in the bag ;D  I only gave it four stars because I felt that it was a little dry.

I would give this 2 1/2 stars.  It was very dry and the topping just clumped up.  The bottom was better because the apples moistened it.  What I would suggest is maybe tossing the apples in an apple cider or apple juice and sprinkling it with cinnamon sugar before putting them in, as it could be a little sweeter for my taste.  There also has to be some way of keeping the topping from clumping, but it did not spread out very well over the apples and as a result tasted pretty much like flour.

Made it with peaches and apples (because I had some of each to use up) and it turned out great. Simple and quick...most time was spent chopping.

I followed the recipe as written and got something resembling apples with a cement mixture on top.  For some reason the "crisp" was teeth-snappingly tough.  Nobody liked it- EVEN with ice cream!  I'd probably cut some flour next time. Live and learn!

I served this to a hungry group of high school kids, and of the three desserts available, this one had the most left.  It tasted okay, but it just didn't look appetizing.  The topping was not quite the texture I expected it to be.

Great apple crisp recipe. Fun, fast and easy- made with ingredients we have right around the house. To add a floavor kick, we used flavored oatmeal and allspice instead of the spices called for- its a delicious contrast with vanilla icecream- I substituted 3 packets of strawberry oatmeal in place of plain oats. Also, to infuse the flavors a bit more, the crumb mix was not only put in the pan before the apples and to coat the apples on top, but we layered it with the apples and sprinkled a bit of brown sugar between the layers with a hint of allspice. We also drizzled a 1/2 tsp of butter on top. Overall, was a joy to make and I will be using this recpe with my variations from now on!

My husband and I didn't think this was that good. I used braburn and granny smith apples and it definetly needed more sugar. It is still sitting in my fridge days later. We ran out of vanilla bean ice cream and it doesn't taste good on it's own.

Too much topping, and I even cut down the flour to 1 cup.  Not "crispy" enough for my liking, but my husband throughly enjoyed it.

I followed this recipe to a T, on a whim, because I had the ingredients. We all thought the end result to be more tart than sweet and very dry in comparison to the juicier crisps we enjoy. I think I will try a different version next time. Thanks.

I love this recipe. I have been making this for about 2 years and it has become my signature dish for potlucks and parties! I usually use 1.5 cans of apple pie filling as opposed to preparing fresh apples, which makes it even more convenient and easy!

This was really good.  I have not made apple crisp before but this one appealed to me since it had so much of the crisp part.  I did add sugar, cinnamon and lemon juice to my apples as other reviewers suggested and it was plenty juicy.  I did overcook it a bit as the topping was so thick it didnt seem done at 1st.  It was still wonderful. I will make this one again next time I have apples to use up.

I made this recipe with summer camp kids. We made one crisp with Granny Smith apples and one with Macintosh and then voted for our favorite; the result was 50:50! Everyone agreed that it was delicious no matter the kind of apples! :)

This was just what we were craving! The only change I made was I had to almost double the mixture so I had enough for the top and bottom of a 9x13 pan.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla as suggested and I didn't peel the apples.  Was delicious no need to try any other apple crisp recipe after this one!

I seemed like too much "crisp" for our tastes, so we cut the recipe in half and just put a nice thick layer over our cinnamon coated Cortland apples.  30 minutes at 375 degrees and it was perfect.

This was the best apple crisp recipe that I have ever made... and I have tried a lot of them!  My husband and kids couldn't get enough!  It is a great recipe made as the directions are.  It was perfect!  I will make it again and again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really good apple crisp recipe.  I halved the topping recipe because I only wanted to make enough for a 9x9 pan.  The topping was really good and I liked the idea of putting some of that on the bottom for a crust.  The only thing you may want to consider is to add a little sugar to your apples if they are really tart.

Very tasty and very easy to make.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  I think the true secret to this recipe is that quality of the apples used.  My apples were pretty good, but I think if they were freshly picked from an orchard it would be better.

This just came from the oven, made with apples I picked this morning. I didnt have lemon juice to bring out the best of the apples. I recommend to those who choose to make this recipe to use the lemon juice because this is EXTREMELY dry.  Some of the reviews state that the apples were not cooked.  I cut mine in small cubes.  The apples came out fully cooked and even cut back on the cooking time by ten minutes.     The taste is good and I will make it again.  Although this particular one will not be served to guests, it will be good warmed in the microwave to serve over vanilla ice cream within these four walls...lol.

Good flavor, but too much crisp to apple ratio for me.  When I make this next time, I'll cut the crisp part in half and just put on top or under the apples, not both.  The only alterations to the recipe I made was half white flour, half whole wheat which was nice for flavor, and my apples were going to sit for a while, so I added a little lemon juice and white sugar to them to keep them from browning too much.

I did this with bliueberries (had no apples) and it was amazing.  My neighbors and their children loved it.  I will make this again using a variety of fruit.  Thanks Rhonda.

this is one of the easiest dessert recipes you could ever make - great for last minute dinners. i scaled this recipe down to 9 servings and rather than using 4 cups of apples i used 2 medium apples, 1 asian pear and 1/4 cup of cherries.  liked the idea of an apple crisp but wanted something that was sweet/tangy. it turned out delicious, with the different fruits creating a layer of flavors. another helpful tip from one of the reviews was to cover the fruit in sugar (i used 1/2 cup splenda) before putting the second layer of crumble on top. this really brought out the sweetness of the fruit.

This was amazing...made the whole meal!  Reduced the flour to 1 1/2 cups, and also reduced the butter to a little over 1 cup.  Used Granny Smith, Jonagold & Braeburn apples, and added white sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and the juice of 1 lemon...let all of this 'marinate' while putting together the crisp.  Will definitely make again!

I have made other cobblers, but this one was really good--my fave so far. I liked how it has equal amount of crumble mixture below and on top of the apples. This is a keeper. Serving with ice cream makes it incredible!

Unbelievable.  I am NOT a baker but was having a large family dinner and thought this would be nice to make for the gang.  Everyone LOVED it.  I did add a tsp of vanilla and tossed the apples with a bit of white sugar & cinnamon as suggested.  I will make this over and over again.

I didn't think this recipe was very good.  Instead of being crispy, the topping turned out dry and a little chewy.  The sweetness level was good if you could find a way to add more moisture to the mix.  I didn't like it enough to try to adjust it though.

This was DELICIOUS!! If you make it as the recipe states, you will still be satisfied.  However, I made a few modifications and will make a few more next time I make it.  First thing: DON'T BE SCARED TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY! I think the best way to make the crumble mix, was to just get in there and use your hands.  I kind of kneaded and crumbled until it looked right.  Also, I ended up having to make another 1/2 of the crisp topping at the end when I realized I ran out.  Next time, I will make 1.5 times the amount of crisp and use as much to my liking.  Also, definitely need to add more apples than the recipe states.  I will use 3 quarts of apples next time.  Also, I had a cinnamon/sugar mix in my cabinet so I added a little to the apples and mixed it around.  I will definitely do this again.  Because there is so much crisp, make sure the apples are ALL OVER the pan and A LOT of them.  I will absolutely make this again but it did take a lot of energy, and a bit tedious peeling and coring the apples, but it was definitely worth it in the end!!

This is very good. I have cooked it several times now and the only adjustments I have tried have been 1/2 cup less flour, adding more cinnimon, lemon juice and vanilla. It all worked and there is never leftovers. :) If you try this recipe just adjust for your families tastes and you will be fine.  Next time I am going to try adding boysenberries to give it a juicer finish. Thank you for a great Apple Crisp recipe!

This turned out really dry.  We won't even eat it.  Maybe I did not put enough apples in or didn't crumble the butter enough, but this is inedible.

LOVE this recipe!  My mother-in-law had this on the counter for us when my husband and I returned home from the hospital after our daughter was born.  We could not refrain from eating the entire thing in a matter of a few days.  The topping is absolutely delicious!  It tastes like an oatmeal cookie!  Definitely our favorite apple crisp recipe!!  She used McIntosh apples, which I also loved!  EDIT: I made this recipe as well and accidentally chopped the apples instead of slicing them.  It took a bit longer to bake, but it was still good.  Although it was a tad dry and I feel like it was partially due to the chopped apples instead of sliced.  So I'll definitely have to remember to slice them next time as the recipe calls for.

I don't eat apple crisps or fruit pies of any nature, however my family loves them and I love to bake, works out. This recipe got rave, rave reviews. Will make again, and again. I did double the crisp as other reviewers had suggested. That's the only thing I did differently.

This was good, but very dry. I like my apples with a bit of liquid. The topping was good. I scaled it for just one apple. Used Splenda Brown Sugar. Next time, I'll try & figure out how to get some liquid in the apple part.

This is a good recipe, although I think the 40 minutes of bake time was too long.  The crust/crumble on the bottom got over cooked and was a little hard.  I will make this again, but next time I will cook it for a shorter amount of time...watching it and checking for doneness.

This was not the best recipe. It definitely has too much butter. I used 1 1/2 cups of flour and about 2 1/2 cups of oats and I think that is what made it edible. With that much butter, it was greasy and instead of being slightly crumbly it became doughy. If I try it again I will probably use half the butter.

I've got to agree with all the other reviewers. THIS IS GREAT! This yummy apple crisp is a suitable dessert for any autumn dinner. I used my Cuisinart to blend the crust/topping. I put all the dry ingredients in the blender bowl. I then dropped pieces of butter in through the top with the blade running. Worked like a charm to create the best crust and topping. I suggest serving this warm with a generous scoop of good quality vanilla ice cream. Oh boy!

Would have been better if I had made it.  My mother baked this, and the "Crisp" turned into more of a huge, soggy, oatmeal cookie on top of apple slices.  Would have probably been delicious.

Great recipe - loved every bite and was a big hit in my house.

Take care to ensure that the topping is 'crumbly' before putting on top of the apples - I found that the parts that didn't mix with the butter didn't get moist when baking and caused it to taste a little gritty.

A huge hit and still good cold. Use good quality oats. My best effort used organic rolled oats from Bear Naked and a 1/2 cup less flour.

This was just "ok".  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used more apples and made 1-1/2 times the crust.  I even stirred some sugar and cinnamon in the apples. It just wasn't as sweet and flavorful as I'm used to...it was lacking something...maybe needs more spices?

I followed the recipe to the letter, it was great.  This is the first review I have written and althouigh this recipe has been reviewed many times I wanted to add my comments.  I think the variety of apple might make a difference in how juicy or dry this crisp turns out.  Mine was absolutely moist and yummy.  I will make this again and I am no big fan of cutting in butter.

I was worried that the apples would be dry or plain with no sugar or sauce, the crust locked in the flavour and made a perfect crist. I will hold on to this recipe.

I thought the top and apples were dry. Maybe I need to divide the crisp part in two before mixing.  Or put less crust on the bottom.  Too much oatmeal not enough butter.  I don't know I know I didn't like it.

YUMMY!! This was delicious! I ended up using 4 granny smith apples and making a bit more of the crumb mixture (as I didnt feel as if I had enough) I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar just to vary the sweetness and I took the advice of another reviewer and tossed the apples in some additional cinnamon-sugar before placing them in the dish. I also added a bit of milk to the bottom layer of the crumb mixture because I feared the crisp would be too dry without it. Turned out GREAT! The bottom was nice and chewy, the apples were sweet but still tart, and the top was crispy and golden brown. Will definitely make again.

I've tried many different apple crisp recipes but never seen one with a double crust. Altho this is good, it's too much like an apple square because of that...will make it again with other fruit tho, as a square. Thanks for the recipe.

The Gala apples I used were still crunchy after baking.  I recommend pre-cooking the apple slices just a bit if you're using this variety of apple.

The recipe should state a certain number of cups of apples, or a certain number of apples. It's hard to judge a quart when you buy apples by the grocery bad full like I do! It had to bake about 10 min. longer than the recipe to get the apples done, but that could be the variety of apples. It's good but will probably not make it very often. It needs a few walnuts and raisins in it as well.

Recipe is similar to one I've been making for 50 years. I add one squeezed fresh lemon to the apples to keep them from turning brown. Then I add spices/sugar and sprinkle over apples then continue.

This recipe is just like my grandmother made.  I baked it a little slower with foil over the top so it didn't dry out.  It was very creamy but the top still had the crunch that we all look for.
This will be added to my menu at my restaurant.

Fantastic recipe!  I made this last night for my coworkers and they loved it!  Make sure to use regular oats as opposed to quick oats if you'd like a crunchier topping.  

*i added a bit of hot buttered rum drink mix to a smaller version I made.  It gave the filling a bit more depth and was delicious!

I used 2 lbs. of fresh rhubarb in place of the apples and used a bunch of extra cinnamon per my family's preference.  No other changes.  Made it quickly for company and everyone enjoyed it.  I covered the pan with foil for last half of baking for fear of crisp getting overly brown.  The bottom "crust" was wonderful for the rhubarb as it tends to get watery when baked.  Next time I may add some apples or strawberries in with the rhubarb.

If so many people are saying this is "dry", then why the great overall rating? I made this with Breaburn apples (4) and McIntosh apples (2)thinking the McIntosh's would make the crisp juicier. They didn't. It was still dry. I have made crisps many times that turn out great...this one is below  and was very disappointing.

Very good! Perfect comfort food! I only gave it 4 stars though, because I had to agree with some other posters that it was a little dry. I think next time I'll soak the apples first. It is really good hot, with a little bit of milk though! Would be great w/ some vanilla ice cream. I also tossed 2 T of sugar into the apples before adding them to the baking dish. I liked the crumb topping just as it was. The bottom crust got a little doughy. I think next time I might try to bake that for 10 minutes or so, then add the apples and the remaining topping. I would definitely make it again!

I made this recipe as is and it was wonderful. The crusts (top and bottom) were crunchy and everyone raved over it.  You could probably add another cup or so of apples if you wanted to, but the recipe is great!

This is a perfect base recipe. I halved the recipe due to the amount of apples I had. I at LEAST doubled (if not more) all the spices and added about 1.5 tsp of ground clove-to the halved recipe. We like our pies spicy. The clove really made this for me! Also, despite advise to the contrary, I had no trouble with softening the butter in the microwave before cutting into  the mix. All in all, very successful. I'll use this for peaches too. :)

My husband loves this. Heck, even I love it and I'm not big on apple desserts. I followed the recipe with the exception of only placing the crumb mixture on top and adding a couple shakes of pumpkin pie spice. It is so good. The apples came out soft on the bottom (I may reduce the cooking time the next time and see how it would be with firmer apples) and the topping tastes just like an oatmeal cookie. This was fantastic served warm with some vanilla ice cream (or just out of the oven, or cold for breakfast...). This recipe is a keeper!

I made this tonight and it was a HIT. I quartered the recipe to 4 servings as I only had two apples that I needed to use up. I diced the apples into small peices instead of slicing them and it worked great. I think it could have done with just the "crumb" on the top, making it even healthier. Next time I will just save the extra crust for another time - because their will be another time. Hubby said to add it to the "keeper" pile. I will try to use some wheat flour next time as well.

This was a bit dry.  I will try again adding brown sugar, cinnamon, and a little allspice to the apples then let them sit a bit, this should bring some juice to the apples.

A great recipe, really rich and tasty. The default amount makes a ton of crisp, so I shared it with a lot of friends.

Tasty, but for an apple crisp it had a little too much of an oatmeal flavor and not enough 'crisp' to it.  Would probably try a different recipe next time.

I agree with lots of others.  I took this to a church pot-luck and had more than half left over. OUCH!  Too dry.  Apples needed sweetening.  Too much flour.

I just made this according to directions and it was superb.  If you want a real lovely flavor use real nutmeg and grate it yourself - a big bang for the buck with this spice, kind of like the difference between real garlic and dehydrated.  I used a combo of blackberries and apples and it was delicious!

wonderful!  a very easy apple crisp.  My family likes more "apple" than "crisp", so I cut the "crisp" to 1/3 of what the recipe called for, and just sprinkled it on the top.  Planning to make this one in a dutch oven on our next camping trip.  Thanks for sharing!

I resized this for 12 servings and used a 9 x 7 deep dish which worked out beautifully.Following the advice of others, I decreased the flour and used thicker apple slices (and more of them!)  I am sure I will make this again & again...

My guests loved this but I didn't like it. It didn't have that rich buttery crispy flavor that I have had before in other apple crisps. I think it was too dry maybe. I should have cut down on the flour!

I made this Halloween Night, my guests liked however I did not.  I did cut back on the flour like suggested, used 1 1/2 cups but I thought it tasted like flour and oatmeal.  More chewy than crisp.  Sorry!

This crisp is delicious!  I'm very picky about apple dishes and this is a great one. I used Macintosh baking apples, but I'm sure any baking apple would do fine!

I used margarine (I Can't Believe It's Not Butter) instead of real butter for this recipe - I'm sure it would have been much better with real butter.  I was a bit confused by "2 quarts of apples" measurement - I used about 8 medium to large Cortland apples. I also took the advice from previous reviews and tossed the apples with cinnamon and sugar and cut back on the flour. I made it twice - once in a glass baking dish and once in stoneware bake dish from Pampered Chef (I'm not a dealer - but do think the product is good).  The stoneware made all the difference in the world with the crispness of the bottom crust. Great recipe!

I've made many crisps, and this is the best so far--using some of the oat mixture as soft crust/base is what really makes it tasty.  I made it with fresh peaches and raspberries and it was delicious! (Also, substituted some of the butter with shortening b/c I ran out--still turned out great).

Made this a couple of times and everyone enjoyed it!  I thought the apples were not sweet enough and tossed the apples in white sugar & cinnamon before placing in the dish and it turned out much better.  I really like the crisp on the bottom and top - it was like eating apple crisp on an oatmeal cookie!  Will make again.

I was too lazy to make a pie tonight, so I gave this a whirl. We loved it! I halved the recipe, and used about 7 small Granny Smith apples. We served it warm with vanilla ice cream. I wouldn't make any changes, I thought it was just perfect!

this has got to be the best apple crisp I have ever made or eaten.  It was quick and easy.  I used my apple peeler, corer, slicer and had this in the oven in less than 10 minutes.  I noticed others mentioned this recipe was dry.  I used a compination of Johnathon and Red Delicious apples and it wasn't dry at all.  It was simply wonderful.  Thanks so much for this recipe Rhonda  I will make it again and again.

This is a Very Good recipe, however, I agree with Lisa, ice cream should be an ingredient because it is a little dry, or maybe cut back on the oatmeal amount.  Still a very good crisp!

This is a VERY GOOD recipe, however I believe there is an error in it. It says to press one half of the dry mixture into the bottom of the pan, and never tells what to do with the other half. I put all of the mixture on the top of the fruit. (I used peaches...Mmmm!)

Better than most apple crisp we've had in restaurants.  Crispy and crunchy with just the right amount of sweetness.  The butter adds a decadence that is memorable.  Thank you.  Because of the ease of this recipe as well as its great taste, it has become our favorite to take to gatherings or to present to guests at our home.  Makes a tasty treat for breakfast too :)

My own recipe is similar to this one and I make extra topping because we like it firm on the top rather than crumbly and I do not put any crumb mixture on the bottom. My favorite baking apple is Northern spy but also use Mutsu which is more available. I also add cinnamon and a little brown sugar to the apples before putting them in the casserole dish.

I believe it needed less flour, or juicier apples.  It turned out dry. The 'crisp' was very tasty, liked having it on the top and bottom of the pan. Was happy to have some ice cream for some moisture though. Will try less flour next time.

I loved this recipe. I didn't have nutmeg the first time around so increased the cinnamon, it was awesome. The second time I used the nutmeg and decided that it was much better using just the cinnamon. I also increased the apple a bit, but over all I will continue using this recipe.

I absolutely loved this recipe!!! I used a less firm apple (Macs) because I like my apple crisp to be more mushy... this recipe was soooo good! It was like a cake with a delicious apple filling inside. I will always be using this recipe!!!

This recipe is excellent exactly as printed.  I used a mix of apples, and it turned out fantastic.
The second time I made it, I used pears.  I tossed the pears with 1/2 tsp of ground cardamon before layering them with the topping, and that was fabulous, too.

It was a great recipe. I doubled the amount of apples and reduced the crisp, to make it a little less sugar/caloric and it still is great with vanilla ice cream on top.

My daughter brought this to a family picnic over the weekend and everyone literally raved on and on about it.  She used Fuji apples, maybe that is one reason it was SOOOO good!  Going to make some for myself a little later today.  I also think the combination of cinnamon and nutmeg was perfect!  Thanks Rhonda, this is the BEST!!!!!

My family and I love this recipe.  We make it every year.  We do tweak the recipe a bit  by not using as much flour or oats, we just play that by ear. We also mix sugar/cinnamon with the apples as others has suggested.  Goes over well every year.

this recipe is awsome!! I especially love how it has sorta a bottom crust. Cuz I have a small fam I half the recipe and put it in a 8x8. Plus i for tge oatmeal I did 3/4c. Plain oats and 1 pouch of maple brown sugar oatmeal. Then mixed in about 3 tbls. Brown sugar with the apple slices before I put them in the pan. Baked it for about 50 min, until the apple slices in 
the middle were tender. Served it up with a hefty scoop of 
vanilla ice cream. I can honestly say that it was THE BEST apple crisp me and my family have ever had!! Hope everyone elses' turns out  just as delicious!

This is a great old recipe - we used to make it when we were kids.  You can put it together in about 10 minutes.   The recipe we used ) added a 1/4 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp b.powder, which gives it just a little puffy, lightness.  I usually press a very thin layer on the bottom of the pan.  Try any fruit- blueberries, peaches, cherries- all wonderful!

I gave this a 3 way too much topping for the apples I want apple crisp not crisp & a few apples. So I just cut down the topping amount. Tasted much better the second time around. First time I was embarrassed to serve it, 2nd time perfect!

This would have been a lot better if I had used Granny Smith apples, or another tart variety. I happened to use whatever was in my fridge, and while the outcome was good, it wasn't something I'd serve to guests.

This is by far the most fantastic cobbler or crisp recipe I've ever made. I don't have any luck with pies, so this is a great substitute as it forms a bottom and top crust. The recipe makes plenty of the crispy stuff that everyone loves, so there is no need to double it as I do with other recipes. Also, I baked it in a smaller but deeper dish.

This was a tasty addition to our Christmas feast. We used thinly sliced granny smith apples coated with a little sugar and cinnamon. We felt the topping was a little heavy on the butter and will use a little less next time. Overall we loved the dish and will make it again!

I've made apple crisp so many times I can't even count because my family loves it.  This recipe is by far the best recipe I've EVER made!  I did sprinkle the apples with some cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar as well before putting them in the pan.  It was AWESOME!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe for the past 3 days at different family and friends houses. there was nothing left by the next day. Some people said to add more apples, as there was to much of the crumbles, but I really like the crumblies and to have it in a double layer, who'd of thought. awsome, awsome recipe. The only differences that i did was, I spinkled white sugar and cinnomin on the apples first, then added it to the pan. At my moms house we didn't have the rolled oats, she only had the inwstant oatmeal that there was the different flavors as well as the original,there wasn't enough regular oatmeal, so i used 2 packs of the maple and brown suar flavor, it did give it a great taste as well, next time I will use more of the maple flavor on it. Also added walnuts. either way, THIS IS TOTALLY A GREAT RECIPE AND EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT!!!! If I was able to give more stars I would. Totally melts in your mouth.

I made this crisp for a huge gathering of 60 people so I used the serving increaser in allrecipes. I followed it exactly and it came out pretty yummy. I did add a little sprinkle of cinnamon and brown sugar over the apples after it was laid out. I made it into two huge pans and it cooked out perfectly at 45 minutes. Some soft, some a little crunch. I used granny smith apples. I would say that this recipe came out well and tasted great but it wasn't ridiculously amazing. It was good for a party but not blow your mind good, hence the 4 stars.

Great recipe! I made this for the first time about a week ago. Came out great! I used Jonagold apples. I love how it is layered because I love the crumb topping more than the apples themselves! I changed a couple things to make it healthier. I used half whole wheat flout and half all purpose flour and used Smart Balance buttery sticks. I also added about a half tablespoon cinnamon to apples. The second time I made it, I used full butter sticks and only all purpose flour. I also used about 9 cups of apples(mixture of Jonagold, Crispin, and Ida Red) instead of the 8. I have to say it was better the first time. I think the real butter is so rich that the texture comes out not as crumby...more gooey. I may decrease the amount of butter next time even if using Smart Balance buttery sticks just to see what happens with the crumb topping. Still...a huge hit!!

I added about 1/2 cup of white sugar and a little extra cinnamon to the topping. I also cooked it for about and extra hour. you want it to be bubbling and the apples to start getting smaller.

This is the best crisp I have ever made, and it comes very close to to Mom & Dad's.  I used Cardamon, Vanilla and Cinnamon in the topping, mixed 1/4 of it with the apples and put the on top.  It took a bit too long for the apples to cook through so I might try pre-cooking them so that the crumble wasn't quite so hard.  A little milk took care of that and it probably would have been even better the next day.

FANTASTIC!!! I just pulled it out of the oven and I can't wait for it to cool just enough to eat some. I've made it a couple times now and its the only recipe i'll ever need. The only chances I made was following other reviewers and using less flour and tossing the apples in a cinnomon sugar mixture. Other than that its amazing!

I have made this several times and it is a huge hit! This is the perfect recipe for people that love the topping almost more than the apples.  I have added some cinnamon to the apple mixture because the apples can get a little lost in there but it is definately a great recipe that gets requested often. Thanks for posting!

As written, 4 stars, but I made it a 5 by tossing the apple slices with more cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. THEN it was great! Another family favorite in our house.

Very Moist! Who ever made it and said it was dry didn't use the right amount of butter. I only used 1 pound of margarine. 3 sticks in the oatmeal mixture and 1 cutup and placed on top. The only thing I didn't like was I used Gala apples and they stayed firm. Otherwise great Apple Crisp!

Delicious!  I'm replacing this recipe with my usual one.  My apples were a little soggy but I think it was because of the type of apple I used.  Even with that this was amazing!

I think this recipes is very good. I took it to a family reunion and it got devoured!!! I did do some tweaking on it though. I put in 1 TBS of cinnamon, 1/4 t of ground cloves, 1/2 t. of nutmeg and left out all the white sugar( although that was a accident, I was glad I did it was plenty sweet) and added 1/2 C. of walnuts. Warm w/ ice cream and some caramel over it. WOW delish!!!

LOVE IT!!!! Tossed in 1 tsp vanilla and a few extra sprinkles of cinnamon to my cut apples. I left on apple peels. Served hot with vanilla ice cream. Next day served cold just as good.

Excellent! Added more apples. Didn't add the nutmeg. I am a cinnamon lover and 1 tsp wasn't enough so I added 1tsp of cinnamon to the topping mix and another to the apples. Will use this recipe again!

Excellent base recipe find! I made this for a crowd for a bbq, and it was a huge hit. I did make a few adjustments based on suggestions in previous comments. I used about 10 cortlands (I think this was almost double the apple), less flour ( 1 1/3 cups), more oats (2 1/13 cups). I also tossed the apples with some cinnamon, vanilla, and brown sugar. Baking time was about 1 hr 15 mins (probably because of more apples). I also added some blueberries on top of the apples, below the top crumble.

I thought this recipe was very easy and tasted very good, just like my mom used to make. I followed the other reviews and used only 1 1/2 cups of flour. I thought 2 quarts of apples were way too much. I used about 5 golden delicious apples in this recipe - maybe up to 6 if you like is saucier. I might cut down on the butter to make it a little more crispier and less dough-like. Thanks for the recipe.

great basic recipe.  I followed the advice and cut back on the flour, added a few more apples.  Also substituted a little of the butter for applesauce.   Yum!  Will make this again.

Very good recipe and a great way to use lots of apples. I made the mistake of not reading through the comments before making this. My crumble, i melted/soften my butter, so my mixture was like cookie dough. But I still used it and this was so good! Next time I won't over mix it, but for a first try my mistake was pretty tasty.

Truly five-star!! My 13 year old daughter made this last night. I was skeptical of the nutmeg, but it was the best recipe we've ever had! (She even used gluten-free flour with a half tsp. xanthan gum.) The layers of crust mean plenty in each bite! Excellent! Next time, however, I would try slightly reducing the butter.

Great! I used only one cup of butter and added a tablespoon of water for the crumble mixture. I also used canned prepared apple filling to save on time.

Fantastic! I added some vanilla and a bit more nutmeg and cinnamon because I know I like those flavors. I was looking for a recipe that was like the one I grew up with and this is it! My husband loves to take an apple to work everyday so  I buy the big box and most of the time I have a few left over that get soft and I  use them for apple crisp. This will be my topping that I use from now on.

This was good.  We don't like our desserts too sweet so it was sweet enough for us.  I did use Splenda brown sugar and it turned out surprisingly well.  I didn't really measure out the apples we had a bunch so we just kept peeling and slicing until we filled up the pan.  I did add a little lemon juice to the apples to give them a tart taste.   This is a good basic apple crisp recipe.  I really liked having a layer on the bottom of the crisp as well as the top.

Just wasn't to our taste.  The apples were too firm and I cooked longer than the recipe stated, but I did't want to burn the topping which was quite good.

Made it 4 days ago and craving it again already. I like mine a little tart so I added a little lemon juice to the apples I had that weren't tart. I also was out of nutmeg but it was still fabulous.... Off to make another.

Love it! By far the best if you love a lot of the oatmeal mixture. Makes for a more substantial dessert and looks better when served.

Perfect!!!  My friend and I made this when they came over, and everyone raved about it!  Both of our families really enjoyed it!! Will definitely make it again.   We used 10 McIntosh apples and followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make it again!  My friend even took a copy of the recipe home to make again for her family!

Nice! Very straight-forward standard recipe that yields a pretty standard crisp. While there was certainly nothing to complain about, it seemed to lack something. Perhaps the type of apples used would make this better (or worse) depending. I'd definitely add nuts next time, perhaps more cinnamon, and maybe a dash of lemon for a tart little zip.

Made two batches - one with apple pie filling and one with cherry.  The first batch, I followed the recipe exactly - the crumple was mush (but used it anyway and it made a yummy crust!).  For the second batch, I only used two sticks of butter and it crumbled just right.

I followed the directions and I wasn't too excited about the end result. My apples weren't soft enough and the topping was too strong in flavor. It was definitely still good, but not the best I've ever had.

Mmmmm this was very good. The topping had the perfect amount of spice and was the perfect ratio with the apples.  My husband rates all the dishes I make from this website and he gave this a thumbs up and 5 stars.  Since there are only two of us, I cut the ingredients in half.  We served it with vanilla bean ice cream and it was the perfect dessert.

This was the best crisp I've ever had and I've had many.  I've made 2 so far and have gotten raves both times.  The bottom crust is a great idea.  I did read the reviews and incorporated a few tweeks.  I did not peel my apples (used a dozen Fuji).  I diced them into medium sized cubes and sprinkled about 2 t. lemon juice, a good dash of cinnamon, and 1 t. pure vanilla extract on them and let them sit while I mixed the crust ingredients.  I also decreased the flour to 1 1/2 cups and used 1/4 t. nutmeg and 1/4 t. pumpkin pie spice in place of the full amount of nutmeg.  After pressing half of the crust into the pan, I poured all the apples and any juices that were created and then topped with remaining crust.  Baked until golden brown.  It was perfect!

Excellent, easy apple crisp.  I had a little bit of a hard time with getting it "crumbly" but it eventually worked.  I've made this 3 times now, twice with apples and once with cherries, blueberries and raspberries.  Turned out great every time!  When I make it with apples I always use 4 packets (2 c.) of raisin and spice oatmeal- I love apple crisp with raisins in it! :)

WOW. This just came out of the oven and I stole a bit from the corner. Perfect texture, amazing flavor. I used 6 mediums sized Gayla apples and baked it for 45 minutes. The only change was that after I cut the apples I mixed some cinnamon and vanilla in them to add a bit more flavor. I'm sticking with this one.

Honestly, I thought it was average. It seemed like way too much butter once it was all mixed so I added a bit extra oats and flour and even then it just wasn't quite right. The taste wasn't bad, just not awesome. Tasted good hot with vanilla ice cream....

This is absolutely fabulous!  Rave reviews from my family.  The only thing I did different was make a double batch of the mixture one on top and one on the bottom(my family loves the apple crisp part).  I have made this a lot and everytime I make it it is huge hit!  You won't be disappointed!!!!

Overall this was good, but unless you serve this with ice cream or whipped cream-it appears a bit dry compared to other apple crisp recipes. There is no "sauce" really that forms from the apples. Next time I will cut back on the brown sugar in the crumble and add some white sugar directly to the sliced apples like I would for a pie.

I made this this weekend for my in laws while I was visiting them and got rave reviews! Everyone rated it 5 stars! It's really easy to make and I used the apples off my mother in law's tree, and served it with vanilla ice cream on top. Yummy! My brother in law said he would have rated it 6 stars if it had one more scoop of ice cream on it!

I brought this to a dinner party last night and everyone raved!  I followed to a T - except that I am not sure I used 2 qts of apples - I filled a 9x13 about 2/3rds full and I used only 1 cup of oats.  Then I took half out, put half the mixture, layered the rest of apples and added the rest of the mixture.  Yummy!

I read a bunch of reviews that suggested cutting the amount of flour in half.  The first time I use a recipe, I always follow it to a T.  The crisp was very dry, and the apples were pretty bland, too.  I tried an apple before I put them in and they were very tasty.  Some people suggested lemon juice and sugar.  I agree.  I don't think I will make this recipe again.

Great Apple Crisp!  I cut the flour, sugar and butter down a bit and increased the amount of apples to really fill the pan to the top (didn't measure, just kept adding until full).  Next time to make it healthier, I will only make 1/2 the oatmeal mixture and only put it on top.  I suppose when I want to splurge or make it for company I'll put it on both the bottom and top but I don't think it really needs it my opinion.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again!

Made for Sunday lunch today---as compared to all apple desserts I've had, "just OK". Mainly, it was too dry. For me it could have also been sweeter. Didn't think that bottom layer added anything special. Not bad--just not that special.

Tasted great!  Will cook longer next time -- apples were still crunchy after suggested time.  I was reluctant to use 3 sticks of butter (it just seems like alot of unneeded calories and fat in an otherwise somewhat healthy dessert), but followed the recipe.  The crumble part was delicious!  As a special treat, this was great.

Delicious!  I halved the entire recipe, and then halved the flour amount again.  I sprinkled lemon juice, cinnamon, and sugar on my apples slices while I was preparing the rest of the mixture.  It came out terrific!  My husband raved about it for days.

This was pretty good... a bit much butter for me... I didn't melt the butter, but I did soften it, and the end result was a bit too buttery and rich for me. I will also try the some reviewer's tips and add lemon juice next time, because the apples were a little dry (although soft), and I could have used a bit more tang to the apples. I do have a pet rat, though, and she came up and stole a piece from my plate... so at least it's rat approved! :O

Yum! I had read previous reviews, so I cut the flour down to 1 1/2 cups and I did not measure the apples - just used my Pampered Chef peeler, corer, slicer and cut until I had a medium bowl filled. I tossed the apples with lemon juice and additional brown sugar. Everyone in my family loved it and it turned out nicely. We have 5 people and barely dipped into the pan. Lots of yummy leftovers!

My family did not enjoy this.  I cut the recipe in half and we found that there was just not enough apples!  I've never had an apple crisp that has a bottom 'crust', I don't think I'll be making this version again.

I made it as the recipe stated for the crust.  It did not have too much flour.  I think the key is to use cold butter and cut it in with a pastry blender.  I also used my Pampered Chef large pan that is very deep.  I filled it to the top with Honey Crisp.  I wish I had sliced them a little thinner as the apples weren't done as much as I would have liked with the extra amount I used.  I increased the cooking time by 15 minutes because of the extra apples.  It was still absolutely delicious.  I was surprised that the crust stayed dry!  (Maybe the Honey Crisp?)  It was even better the second day.  With the extra crust on the bottom this feeds a lot of people!!!

This was my first attempt at apple crisp.  I followed others suggestions of more apples and less flour and it turned out really good.  I had sprayed the pan with non-stick spray, but I still had issues with the crisp sticking to my glass pan.  My mixture turned out more like dough and less crumbly, so maybe I would have been better off with more flour?

Don't be like me and try to make it healthier by lessening the amount of butter and using all whole wheat flour.  It still tastes good, but it's not crisp!  Also, do yourself a favor and go buy a pint of vanilla ice cream to go with this.

This recipe was terrific, with only a small adjustment.  I used 1 1/2 cups of flour, as someone else suggested, and it was just right.   Lots of cinnamon on the with the flour/oats.  Don't skimp on the apples.  My family devoured it and wondered why there wasn't any more!! Will definitely make it again.

This recipe is great!  I have made it several times both in a baking dish and in individuals ramekins with a little vanilla ice cream on top.  Everybody loves it!  I have also have substituted blueberries or blackberries, which is great too.  This is a hearty delicious comfort desssert!

This was okay, but I think it needed A LOT more cinnamon. As I was following the recipe I thought, "That's it??" In my opinion, apple crisp should have a stronger cinnamon taste. Not sure if I would make this one again.

By far my new favorite apple crisp recipe.  I usually use Jonathan apples in crisps but haven't found them in my local store this year.  I used about 8 medium to large sized Braeburn apples and it was wonderful.  The last time I made it I used about 10 smaller Gala apples and it was awesome.  I coat my apples with lemon juice while slicing and some brown and white sugar before putting them in the baking dish.  FIVE STARS!!!

Excellent.  I cut the recipe in half, did less flour (as indicated in some of the reviews)and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  Loved it.

awesome!  Took advice of others and used only 1 1/4 cups flour, added an extra apple.  Also added a 1/4 cup flaxmeal for added benefit.  Yummy recipe!  Thanks!

I can't honestly speak to this recipe as it is written, but I used it as a base for my usual experimanting. I ground up oats in place of regular flour, added more spices, used some honey instead of sugar, but did add some brown sugar too, and just added a pinch of this and a pinch of that untill it tasted right to me. (I can never just leave a recipe as it is! Lol) Thanks for the base though!

Delicious.  I made it with apples and frozen blueberries.  What was great about this dessert is that it kept its shape when cut into squares, so looked good on the plates.  Unlike other crumbles, which... crumble. :)  The base was fantastic, I will try it as a base for cheesecake.

This is the best! We add rum soaked raisins to ours. Also when it comes to mixing the topping I use my hands to make sure it is throughly mixed and is the consistancy I want.

I really liked this recipe. I halved it and used whole wheat flour instead of white. I couldn't fit all the apples into the pan though, so ended up using almost 1 cup less. My only complaint is that the apple filling seemed to be pretty dry. Maybe I'll put a couple TBS of water in it?

I made this apple crisp for my niece and she loved it.  The only changes I made was to cut flour to 1 1/2 and oats.  Added more cinnamon 2t. I will make it over and over again.

I had a total of 2 quarts of mostly apples, a few pears and a bag of frozen mixed berries. I also doubled the crisp part, and I'm glad I did. My husband and I loved the crisp part of apple crisp. I also added sugar and cinnamon to the apples, and doubled the spice part of the crisp. The dish was piled HIGH with fruit and topping. I can't imagine anyone needing more apples and less topping. It was WONDERFUL!!

Was ok. Used some of the suggestions on using oats.  Only had red delicious apples and it came out too sweet. Will try again using tart apples and sticking to the original recipe.

This was very good.  I did add more apples and double the crumb crust mixture.  Sprinkled a bit of sugar and cinnamon on the apples.... and added caramel... (I know that should be a sin...but oh so good). The whole mix was a bit dry however, that's how I remember it growing up.  It's supposed to be dry, not cakey.  If you're looking for cakey,  you're looking for a brown betty or cobbler or something like that.   It's called "crisp" for a reason.   This is great served warm with vanilla ice cream or with a bit of milk/cream poured on it.  Will make this my "go to" base recipe for any fruit crisp.  I've tried blueberries too...very good.

very tasty.  I didn't follow it exactly as the kitchen I had to work with didn't have nearly enough supplies (three single guys, so figure).  It still turned out great though, recipes where you can bend the directions are the best.

This is yummy.  It does need the cinnamon and sugar with the apples.  I peeled the apples, and as I was doing that I put them in a big bowl of lemon juice and water, to keep them from browning,  I used 7 lg granny smith apples and made 1 1/2 topping mixture, using the reduced amount of flour as suggested by others.  As I was layering I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar.  Reserve more of the topping for the top.  My pan was quite full so I needed to bake it longer than stated.  It was about 70 min.  Once topping was browned I covered with tin foil to pervent burning.  It is sweet and tart at the same time.  Oooh can't wait to serve this for Thanskgiving with ice cream.

This is a terrific recipe!  I generally add a teaspoon of vanilla to the apples, because I think vanilla adds to just about everything.  And I use 2 sticks of butter instead of 3, which makes a more crumbly topping.  Over the course of baking the juices from the apples meld with the topping to make a delicious crust, top and bottom.  

My kids beg for me to make this when we buy apples, and my sister-in-law has requested a copy of the recipe.  

Tailor it to fit your family, but this one's a keeper.

This recipe is delicious and relatively easy! It's not overly sweet, but it has natural-tasting sweetness, not sugary. I made it twice and plan to make it a standard item! I used golden delicious and granny smith apples, about 7-8 large apples in all. The 2nd time, I used 1 stick butter and 1 stick Smart Balance 50-50 butter blend, and it was just as delicious as the all butter version.

I used 1c of white and 1c of whole wheat flour. I also added 1 cup of a flax seed/wheat germ/wheat bran mixture. To moisten up the crisp with the extra dry ingredients, I smothered the tops of the apples with apple sauce. I also only used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of butter. Serve with drizzled honey!!

Fast and easy! I ran out of butter so used 1/2 butter, 1/2 peanut butter. Also, 10min before it was done, I sprinkled some honey on top.

Absolutely delicious. I didnt have rolled oats so I used 4 bags of instant oats and it turned out excellent. 1 1/2 flour is the way to go. A little on the sweet side for those of you who dont like super sweet deserts.

This is a really great apple crisp.  I brought it to a potluck and got many rave reviews from professed apple crisp connoisseurs.  I followed the recipe as-is and it came out great.  The only thing I changed was that I used 12 cups apples instead of 8 cups(2 quarts).  Since I had extra apples, I added just a little extra sugar (about 1/3 C.) and a dash of cinnamon to the apples before placing them in the baking dish.  Highly recommend!

very easy to make, came out great!  We didn't have regular oats in the house, I substituted 4 packs of instant Maple Brown Sugar oatmeal and cut the brown sugar in half - it still came out great and the maple flavor was a nice little extra

i didn't read all the reviews at first, it wasn't until after I tasted it that I went back and read "more" reviews and saw that others like myself thought this needed less flour. Despite this set back, it was overall ok. I added nutmeg to it just out of personal preference.

This is my first apple crisp recipe, and I love it! It is definitely a little more crispy and a little less apple-y, but I really like it that way. I soaked the apples in lemon juice and sugar mixture, which was great. I also used 2 sticks of butter, 1 cup sugar (but I think 1 and 1/4 would have been perfect) and 1 cup of flour. Overall, delicious!

I've never made an apple crisp that had a "bottom crust." I LOVE the crisp parts so I thought I would give it a try. To be honest, I didn't really care for the bottom crust, nor did my husband or step-son. After reading the reviews of "dryness," I decided to had 3/4 cup of apple cider, "not sweet" I added brown sugar to the apples to help for sweetness and apple pie spice for flavor, added minute tapioca to reduce possibility of runny sauce. Over all it came out okay, but I don't necesarily think this is the recipe for our family.

This is tasty and super duper easy.  It's not apple pie, of course, but pretty darn close and SO much easier.  I make mine in an oven safe bowl and add extra apple filling.  I like making it with oatmeal, it's a healthier alternative to other desserts :)  Great recipe, definitely a fall/winter staple when you want something sweet.

This was good, although with the rave reviews I somehow expected something more bombastic. This is a bit heavy on the crisp. The apples need some cinnamon and sugar added to them to give them a bit more flavor, and you can use oil instead of butter and cut it in half. I still far prefer the Apple Crisp II and Apple, Cranberry and Pear on this site - they are both fabulous.

First time I've made apple crisp and it was delicious. Followed the recipe as is, but sprinkled the apples with lemon juice to prevent browning, as an earlier reviewer suggested. Turned out fantastic. Easy, great recipe.

This recipe was awesome!  I substituted brown sugar Splenda for the regular brown sugar, as I have family members with diabetes.  It tasted wonderful.  I would also suggest just using your hands to mix the crumbly topping.  Ours turned out nice and crunchy on top.

This was a huge hit.  I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings and put in about 1/2 the flour per other suggestions of needing less flour. I also added apples until I thought it was sufficient...about 1/2 cup less than what was called for. It turned out great. Very tasty! Thanks!

i enjoyed this recipe, but with modifications:  i used 1 1/2 cups of flour, 2 1/2 cups of oats, the full amount of brown sugar, and i added more cinnamon and nutmeg as well as some allspice to the topping, and i soaked the apples in lemon juice, sugar and salt before adding them (i used five big granny smiths and two big red delicious apples.)  i also baked mine in two pie pans so i could take half over to my neighbor. halfway through baking i checked it and it looked pretty dry, so i melted some butter and added golden syrup and drizzled that over the top, and that saved it, and the golden syrup gave it a nice caramel-y flavor. we had it with vanilla ice cream and yum!

If you are looking for a moist crisp, this is a great recipe. I have used it with various fruit fillings. My favorite is a pint of blueberries, 3 cups sliced peaches, 2 tbsp flour, and 2 tbsp sugar mixed together. A little extra baking time doesn't hurt when making this recipe to brown the top more. I usually bake for an extra 5 minutes and then turn the oven off and let it sit.

mmm... I just love apple crisp it is just so yummy and easy to make!This recipe is very good but I like to slice one apple and then put it in the oat mixture. It is much better that way! Also when I am in a pinch and really want a treat I just whip up the oat mixture really quick and eat it! When I do make the full recipe I like to eat it warm with a scoop of vanilla icecream on top! Even though chocolate is my favorite icecream it is still good with vanilla. choclate just taste kinda weird with apple crisp! but o well I can have a scoop of chocolate icecream later. well I guess that is all I have to say remember it is really good if you just use one apple! I REALLY DO SUGGEST YOU TRY IT MY WAY!!

My daughterinlaw brought this to a family get together last night and it was absolutely wonderful.  Instead of fresh apples she , of necessity, used three cans of Comstock Apple Pie Filling. I can't imagine it any better, but I will try fresh apples next. Thank you for an easy Apple Crisp.

I used 1/2 cup flour less as suggested. Added more apples, sprinkled a little sugar on top of them and used a 8x12 pan. This is an excellent dessert! Will use again, especially around the holidays.

Great recipe.  My family loved it.  I used 1/2 cup less flour and doubled the cinnamon.  Will definitely use again.

I absolutely love this recipe as is. 

My sister needed some extra sweetness so we rubbed the apples with just a little brown sugar and vanilla.

I enjoyed this recipe. I cut the ingredients in half except for the apples to fit in a 9x9 bake pan to make in my toaster oven. I also used two 12 oz packages of already sliced granny smith apples from the grocery store that were on sale saving me time. I just had to peel off the skin.  Each package was about 1 QT. It took 60 minutes to bake and came out tasty. I had to try it while it was still warm. I will make this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

This was great.  I also took another persons suggestion and baked in a smaller pyrex dish.  I put the crumble in the bottom and pressed it up the sides like a pie crust.  Turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is EXCELLENT! Exactly what I was looking for. I used canned pie filling though.
 This recipes makes alot so as is it's great for potlucks or serving groups but for family dessert I'd recommend doing a half recipe.

Fantastic!!  I followed some other people's advice and put the 'crisp' mixture only on the top and it turned out exactly how I hoped it would.  I served it with a topping of mascarpone cheese, honey and cream.  Delicious - this is a keeper!

Yummmmy! I halved the recipe and used an 8 inch square dish. I used half whole wheat flour and half white and instead of butter I used Becel. Totally yummy with less guilt! Try this recipe you won't be disappointed.

Excellent recipe! I've already made it many, many times. Often, i make more of the dry recipe and store it in my fridge. Then cut apples whenever i feel like eating apple crisp and put it in a smaller glass pyrex. It's perfect for quick, freshly baked apple crisp for two! 

I reduce the flour just slightly and everything else is perfect!

Thanks for the recipe!

I put the crumble on the top only...divided it between 2 big pans of apples. It was delicious! I did sprinkle the sliced appes with cinnamon sugar before putting the topping on.

Very tasty receipe and when we took it out of the oven and served it with vanilla ice-cream, my family loved it, as well did I.  I did add a little bit more brown sugar to make it more sugary.

I felt good eating this crisp because it is a healthier version but didnt like it otherwise...not sweet enough and very dry (i actually added water to help it)...the only other thing that helped was after it was in the frig for 3 days it seemed to moisten up a bit. I enjoyed the easy apple crisp recipe from this site much more which uses a cake mix, very easy but I am sure not nearly as good for you.

For those of you taste testing differnt recipes...I also made "Easy apple crisp" from this site and this one won by a landslide. I used Gala apples in both and these tasted much sweeter in this recipe. The only thing I changed was to use 1/2 reg sugar, 1/2 brown sugar.

Great tasting, easy to make, and entire office loved it.  I did cut back the flour to 1 1/2 cup as suggested in another review.  Added pecan chips on top for additional flavor.  Small bag.

This recipe is awesome!  The best part of a crisp, is infact, the crisp!  I too reduce the flour to 1 1/2 cups, and I leave the apples sliced thicker so that they stay firm.  I also add dried cranberries, cherries or golden raisins.  Sliced almonds are delicious mixed in with the top.  I will also pop it under the broiler for the last few minutes to really 'crunch' up the top.

Excellent! Couldn't stop eating it! I did as others suggested and cut the flour in half. This is a good idea but BE SURE to also reduce the butter in that case. I once made the mistake of not doing that, and the dish was waaaaay too greasy. Another idea is to add toasted pecans, which is really nice. Great recipe -- no need to look for another one, with these modifications.

I chose this because all the great reviews.  It was excellent.  The family loved it.  I listened to other reviews and cut down on the flour.  It could still be cut back to 1 1/4 cup.  We are making it for Thanksgiving.

Fantastic! I made it into one deep-dish style dessert by using a 9x9 inch pan. Baked for 45 minutes. I barely had a chance to try it myself - it was gone in seconds!

I cant imagine how anyone could give this recipe anything other than 5 stars.  I served this at a luncheon and everyone loved it.  The "crisp" was crispy and the apples were moist and delicious.  This is the only apple crisp I will EVER make again.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This was the worst apple crisp ever. There was way to much flour in this recipe. There was no crisp to this apple crisp. We followed the recipe and were very dissapointed with the outcome. If you like the crisp and the sweetness of real apple crisp then I don't recommend this.

This recipe is better for people like me who like the Crisp part of Apple Crisp better. Quite a bit of the crunchy-sweet stuff. I love it! Always gobbled up in seconds.

Absolutely awesome! I made it to take to my parents house for Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone that had it raved about it!  My Dad won't let me take home the leftovers (he doesn't know I made a second one to keep at home!).  Thanks very much for sharing this great recipe!!  Will most definitely make this a regular in our house!

This is the best apple crisp I have ever tasted. I have had a hard time not eatting seconds. I added half a cup of sugar to the apples like somebody suggested and it turned out great. I will absolutly make this again. Thank you Rhonda for a great recipe.

Very delicious. I did, however, add some nuts and raisins. Adding a dollip of ice cream on the warm crisp was out of this world.

Recipe is very good! I think, however, that ice cream should be listed as an ingredient, because dish is a little dry without it.

Very good. I used only 1 cup of flour and increased the oatmeal to 2.5 cup. Also I cooked the apples with 1 cup of sugar and 1 tsp of Cinnamon and thickened with cornstarch after the apples are tender.

Four stars because there’s is far too much topping for the amount of apples. I actually doubled the apples and halved the topping and it was perfect. Also I took one reviewr’s tip to toss the apples in a bit of cornstarch and that worked well. The nutmeg adds a nice flavor.

Not fond of apple anything but this is one of the best I have ever eaten. I love this cobbler topping on any kind of fruit. I have blackberries and used this topping and it was sure a hit with my husband and son in law.

I followed the recipe exactly as instructed. Sorry, not impressed. I have been making apple crisp for 35 years and I thought I would try someone else's recipe and see if it was better. Nope. My suggestion is to cut the oats by 1/2 cup and add more butter. But I prefer the topping to be less crunchy than this. If you like a really crunchy topping this may be fine for you.

I make this often on our house, using whatever fruit is in season.  Today, Red Prince apples were on sale so I thought I'd make apple crisp for dessert tonight.   I got home and discovered I had no oats left in the house...so this time I tried it using those packages of instant apple cinnamon flavoured oatmeal.  It came out really good, and as I used apple flavoured oatmeal, it had lots of apple taste and dried pieces of apple in the topping.  Next time I may (on purpose this time!) use a Maple flavoured oatmeal.  Just a tip if you are short on oats!  Anyways, this is always a hit, I love the bottom crust too!

Cut out 1/2 cup of flour. Also reserved 1/4 cup of the brown sugar and sprinkled over the apples mixed them together then placed them over the crust on the bottom then topped with the remaining. It Is really good.

I assumed regular oatmeal when making this.   You probably want to try quick oats.   The 40 minutes cook time didn't cook the oats for me.  I left it in for another twenty minutes, and they still weren't cooked.

Totally yummy and pretty fool proof!  No idea how many apples I used but it came out perfect! Prepared it on the weekend a few baked it on a Tuesday. Delicious and perfectly sweet. We're tart apple lovers so the amount of sugar was just right. Can't wait to make more!

I added a bit more oats (about 1/3 of a cup)  as I found it was sticking together a bit much. It is delicious and just the right crumble texture.

In theory, I liked the idea of the topping also being on the bottom, but in execution, I'm not so sure. I might use more apples if I make it again.

I just sold a little bit of caramel over the top of it after it was done baking it was a really good.But I would recommend that before put in the apples in to mix them with cinnamon and sugar otherwise they don't have much flavor on the apples.

This is the best apple crisp I have ever had. I used Cortland Apples. I served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream the night we made it. I ate leftovers for breakfast.

I think the next time I will use a little less sugar. It was a little runny right out of the oven but it was just right when cooled and absorbed some liquid. Loved it! Very good flavor and not too much cinnamon.

I made this delicious crisp and the only substitution I made was I used peaches instead of apples.  It was awesome, even my husband who doesn’t really like oatmeal asked for seconds and then asked for leftovers the next night! This is now my go to recipe with whatever fruit I have on hand, thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious! I have made it 2 times now. I used white whole wheat flour and reduced the sugar down to 1 cup. It was easier to justify eating it for breakfast this way. Plus my apples were pretty sweet. I highly recommend this crisp recipe! We ate it with home made whipped cream from this site. Yum!

I made this and followed the recipe exactly except I did coat the apples with a cinnamon/sugar mixture before putting them in the pan. I got rave reviews from my dinner guests. Everyone loved the extra crumb crust on their piece. I also used 3 different kinds of apples and everyone liked that too.  I'll be making this again.

This was not the best...too much crust and I didn’t even add all of what I made, i threw some out. It was also dry, I had to let my ice cream melt over it to moisten it up a bit.

I made this as I could not locate my regular recipes. I follow the instructions etc and I am sorry to say that I did not care for this. It was rubbery, dry and was missing some sweetness. Needs some improvements, I may go back to this recipe just to figure out whats missing, but will not make it again as is to serve for a gathering.

Good but not the best I have ever had. The recipe makes 18 servings which I did not catch until I was mid recipe. It was a ton and a lot of butter but not all that rich. It definitely needs more spices. Lacked flavor and was just sweet. I used Granny Smith apples. Followed directions exactly. Just okay for us.

Easy recipe that can be converted to a gluten free recipe with very little effort if you have gluten free flour alternatives and certified gluten free oats. 
There is quite a bit of the crisp mixture.  I found that I prefer the crisp on top and not on the bottom. I added a splash of apple cider to add some moisture to my apples.  I usually use a combination of Granny Smith, Cortland, and Macoun apples. 
This is my go to recipe because it is so easy to follow and is always well received by those to whom I serve it.

Very very good! Needed salt, which is my fault for using unsalted butter and forgetting to add it back into recipe (add about 1/2 tsp of salt to oatmeal mixture  IF using UNsalted butter) I also added toasted pecans. SO GOOD!

This apple crisp was yummy!  I really liked the bottom layer of crispy “topping”.  I added an extra tsp of cinnamon to the topping mix and used Honey Crisp apples.  So good!  Thinking next time I will serve it with a caramel drizzle.

I made this apple crisp for a family Thanksgiving dinner and it received rave reviews from everyone! I made it with 1/2 apples and 1/2 pears - delicious!! This most certainly will be  a regular dessert at my table.

It was delicious! I used about 16 cups of thinly sliced Macintosh apples and generously sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on them. I also slightly melted the butter.

My grandson requested apple crisp for his dessert the night before he headed off for his junior year in college. I decided to try a different recipe than I normally use and found this one.  Everyone loved it!  I used 1 1/2 cups flour to the 2 cups of oatmeal, doubled the cinnamon, and omitted the nutmeg. I used a little over 3 quarts (13 cups) of Granny Smith apples.  Since Granny's are quite tart I lightly sugared and added cinnamon to the apples.  I also doubled the topping recipe because I used more apples and baked it in a 10x15 baking dish.

This was really good, though not as much like pie as the recipe I usually follow.  The nutmeg added a nice warmth.  I served this with a scoop of ice cream and it was perfect.  I might try it with plain yogurt too.  Only a couple changes:  cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups; doubled the cinnamon; added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

I used peaches and a few blueberries and old fashion oats instead of quick oats and it turned out great. I would half the butter next time because 3 sticks of butter is not needed!

Made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it.   Mixed the crumble in the food processor.  Turned out perfectly...not too floury at all.  Used Mac apples.  
Absolutely delicious.

I've made this recipe twice now, once as written, and once in an attempt to improve on the original, which isn't as sweet, rich, or flavorful as I would like.

The recipe didn't specify, so I used Granny Smith apples both times, which I consider the default baking apples. I recommend you toss the apples with a bit of white sugar and cinnamon, though, if you're using sweet apples, the sugar probably isn't necessary. 

I recommend slightly increasing the amount of butter and brown sugar in the recipe to 1 3/4 cups of each. This will make the recipe richer and sweeter, but it won't get too crumbly when you cut in the butter, as the mixture will be closer to oatmeal cookie dough, so don't keep mixing expecting crumbly. Also, if you're using unsalted butter, add a teaspoon of salt to the mixture to make it more flavorful.

One more note, base the cooking time exclusively on the apples. Depending on your pan, they might be severely overcooked in 45 minutes, so start checking them early. When the apples are almost done, if you want a crisper topping, turn the oven up to 400 degrees for the last five minutes or so.

Doubled  this and baked in 9 x 13 dish for an hour.  Almost missed the direction to put half the topping in the bottom of the dish, then the apples, then the rest of the topping.  While the flavor was good, it felt like an awful lot of  topping.  If I make again, might double the apples but not the topping, and only put topping on top.

I was not happy with this recipe.  It was dry.  It needs more apples and more flavor.  I had to run out for ice cream and use it as a topping.

It will be hard to finish the pan.  It is mushy and seems like a lot of butter and sugar on apples rather than apple crisp.  I won't make this again.

I liked this, but had a few issues. Something seemed a bit off with the topping. There was way too much butter, it got a bit greasy and soggy. And the topping was not as "crumbly" as most other crumbles. It tasted great but I didn't love the texture. Next time I will cut down on the butter and the flour and see if that's better. I will also slice my apples THICKER next time so they don't get so mushy.

I really liked that there is an oatmeal crumb mixture on the top and bottom of this crisp.  I did end up needing more of the oatmeal topping for the top.  I also added a little cinnamon and sugar to the cut up apples before putting them in the dish to bake.  Overall a very good recipe.

Followed it exactly and there's wayyy to much flour and oats... I should have probably read the "Most Helpful Critical Review" first and saved myself some ingredients

I liked it, however couldn't get over how much butter and sugar added.  Very unhealthy!  But it tasted very good -- what wouldn't?

I made this with Granny Smith apples and thought it was wonderful. The sauce gave the right amount of sweetness for the apples.  Next time I will double the crumble mixture.

Good, but I'd make sure to cut the apple slices thin. I cut the apples in 8 slices cause they were small but I would do even more next time.  I'm giving it 4 stars cause I believe 1 1/2 cups flour is more appropriate and this recipe calls for tons of butter.  I used 15 apples in a granny smith/golden delicious apple mix.  People were overall pleased with the taste.

It was my first time making apple crisp so I followed the recipe almost exactly. I tossed the sliced apples with a little bit of lemon juice.  I should have followed some suggestions made by other reviewers about using less flour and oats. My crisp came out a little on the doughy side but at least there was a little "crisp" to the top at the end of baking. Ate it with ice cream and it was delicious!

Good recipe. Thanks! I especially appreciate the nutmeg and the oats.

Instead of cinamon I used chinese 5-spice. I also added some lemon rind to the crisp. Very nice! 

Sour apples combine the best, I think.

This recipe has WAY too much crisp. I should have halved the amount for the crisp part and just put it on top of the apples.

This recipe was easy and tasted great!  I scaled the recipe down to serve 9 (cut the recipe in half) and served it for dessert last night.  I teach a homeschool baking class and was trying this recipe out for next weeks class.  When I make it with the class, I am going to cut the flour down by half.  The apples stayed moist, but their was no ooze of juices anywhere.  Probably just my preference.

Average.  It was definitely a way to use a dozen small apples, but the flavor was disappointing.  Needed substantially more moisture.  Will not make again.

Very good! Although I only made the "crisp" topping and used it on some apple pies for Christmas. DELICIOUS. Great recipe Rhonda. :0) (With that being said...this is makes a LOT of crisp!!! I even scaled it in half).

This was so YUMMY, I changed it alittle buy adding dried cranberries, added about an 1/8 of a cup brwon sugear on the top just before putting in the oven. Aslo let it set for 24-36 hrs before cutting. Thats what made this crisp. It was easy to cut and serve as a pie, you could see all the apple layers and it was a very nice presentation. Next time I will add blueberrys too!

Easy basic recipe. I used Stayman Winsap apples and tossed them in sugar and cinnamon and set aside. I also soaked some raisins in rum for about 40 minutes, drained them and added them to the apples. I also added a little extra cinnamon, a touch of ginger and nutmeg to the crumb mixture. This went a lot farther than an apple pie and was great!

This makes a fantastic apple crisp! I cut the recipe in half since I didn't need to make that much and baked it in a glass pie pan. I also doubled the cinnamon, added 1/4 tsp of ginger, and added a tsp of vanilla and a few shakes of cinnamon to the apples slices. Very good. My only regret is that I did not have any vanilla ice cream to serve with it, but I'll be sure to remedy that tomorrow...if there is any left.

Good recipe, especially if you don't want something that is too sweet.  After peeling and slicing the apples I mixed in some cinnamon and sugar, not too much, to add some extra flavor to the apples.  Tastes the best served warm with vanilla bean ice cream!

I followed this recipe exactly. I don't know what happened but it was dry and disappointing. The topping never really seemed to come together and remained a sandy texture. The only think that saved it was the scoop of vanilla ice cream I served with it. I am glad I didn't make this for company because I would have been really embarrassed. I was missing that moist apple pie type center I was looking for.

This recipe is wonderful!  I cut the recipe in half and it still made a lot.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  Only thing I did was used 3/4 C. flour instead of 1 C., tossed the apples in sugar, and baked it for 1 hour.  I used 6 Cortland apples, so that was probably a little more than the 4 C. called for....remember I made a half recipe.  Very good.  I will make this again and again.  Served with Walmart's "Homemade Vanilla" ice cream.  YUM!

Decent & Edible but nothing to brag about. I used 1.5 cups of flour and mixed in vanilla with the apple.   Not worth the calories.

This recipe is delicious!  I added a couple of drops of vanilla to the crisp mixture as was recommended, as well as tossed the apples with cinnamon and sugar.  We enjoyed every last bite!

No complaints here- followed to a T!  It's not super sweet so if thats what you're looking for then follow the other reviewers advice.  Personally I think its just right- not too sweet but a perfect dessert.

Pretty dang good. I added cinnamon, sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla to the apples. (Granny smith). And some salt to the crumble. It was a teensy bit dry, but thats my own fault for not cutting the butter into the crumble better. This would have been five stars had the recipe had the things I added. =)

Delicious! Per others' suggestions, I added a little vanilla and cinnamon sugar to the apples before adding to pan. Otherwise, followed recipe. I brought it to work this morning and it is fantastic! One co-worker said it's an A++!

This was a nice simple recipe but not the greatest.  I think part of the problem was my apples weren't very tasty. Might try again with better apples but will probably stick to my regular crisp recipe.

This is the best apple ccrisp recipe by far!!  My family has been making this exact version for over 20 yrs. now...I do always double up on the crisp part because I like more crisp than apple BUT it is so easy to make and smells so good and of course tastes so so so yummy!

SO DELICIOUS! I love the layers! Made it as is (except I only had apple pie spice on hand, not plain nutmeg, but it was fine) and used both sour and sweet apples. I'll keep this recipe around!!!!

By far the best apple crisp ever! It was a little too sweet and I'll reduce the sugar a bit next time, but there will be anest time because this is too good not to make again! Thanks.

I have made this twice now.  The first time did not work out, as I found the amount of oats & flour to be a little excessive.  I prefer the taste of the apples & seasoning to be more than the crust.  The second time I made a smaller batch of the oats & flour, still found I actual had some left over.  Not the best tasting apple crisp I've had.

Will not make this again, way too much butter, turned out like a gooey clump of butter and oatmeal, had reduced the flour, but then had to add more. Tasted like a dish of all oatmeal, butter and flour, yuck!!!   Found a recipie in Betty Crocker cookbook that was much better

I thought this was very dry...even while it was in the oven I added a few slivers of butter on top as well as some water in the pan.  I did not like this at all and my family was disappointed in how dry it was.

This is a fabulous apple crisp recipe.  Especially good when re-heated in microwave for 10 seconds then topped with Vanilla Bean Breyers ice-cream.  Oh wow.

I halved the recipe for an 8x8 pan.  I used dehydrated apples that were sitting in food storage and needed to be used up.  I just re-hydrated them in some water then drained them and only cooked it for about 25 minutes.

I used granny smith apples and it was too tart for me. I was not really impressed with the crisp part either.

This is wonderful!!!  the only thing that I changed is the butter, I used 2 sticks and I still think that it needed a little more.  I will also probably mix the apples in some sugar and cinnamon as to my husband and myself they seemed to be missing something.  I usually tweek all of my recipes.

I don't know what the deal was. The recipe was way, way, way to dry.  It was all crisp, very little apple. Don't get me wrong, I do like a lot of crisp, but this was a little over board. I probably will not try this recipe again.  I just prefer my apple crisp a little more moist.

Excellent flavor!  Would make this again and again.  I doubled the spices and brown sugar to compensate for the amount of flour that the recipe calls for (you can also reduce the amount of flour, as recommended by other cooks).

I tried this tonight for my husband and kids,  I used hard margarine instead of butter andd also used my food procesor to mix it all up (my family does not lke the texture of oatmeal).  This will be made again.

I really don't know what people are raving about.  I make this recipe exactly as written.  The apples were dry and there was no sauce on the apples like other apple crisps I have enjoyed.  It was definitely lacking something.  I would not make this again.

I reduced the amount of flour by 1/2 a cup as suggested by another review - and found the mixture a bit to sticky. I would suggest keeping to the amounts in the recipe.

This was the worst apple crisp I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly. The crust didn't have enough flavor. The only reason I have given it three stars is because the kids liked it, so at least it won't be wasted.

Great crisp!!  I had a few apples to use up so gave this a try.  It was fast, easy & delicious.  I halved the recipes as I only had a few apples and it was perfect.  I did leave the nutmeg out because it isn't a favorite flavor of mine but that is just personal preference.  Thanks, I'll use this topping with other fruits too!  Peaches, berries, pears, yum!!

Great recipe. Make sure you use enough apples. I didn't have enough on hand and it turned out to be mostly crisp, but the flavoring and everything was nice. As I made it 4 stars, but I think if I followed the recipe exactly, it would get all 5.

OMG!!!  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!  I have used the same recipe (my Mom's) for years, but this one is now my go to recipe.  I did make one modification: I mixed 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/3 cup of sugar into apples before layering them in the pan.  I think they would have been too tart without it (I used McIntosh).  I used 1 1/2 cups flour, instead of 2, and left out the cinnamon and nutmeg in the crust mixture.  Delish!  Thanks again :)

Delicious!  I've made this twice now with radically different results, but both were good.  The first time I thought it needed more apples and less sugar, and the second time I used a huge heep of apples and needed a bit more sugar.  Just be mindful of the type and sweetness of the apples you're working with and adjust accordingly.  Another something noteworthy: both times I've made it, I've reduced the amount of butter by a third and it still worked into the struesel fine and tasted great.  I haven't missed that stick of butter even with a larger batch.

So good Apple Crisp has been one of my favorites since I was a kid. I've never had one with the crust on the bottom. This was maybe the best I've ever had. However, I was talking on the phone while putting this together and forgot the sugar and cinnamon on the apples, I didn't even miss it and it may have been too sweet with it just perfect without. My 3 year old son loved it as well, I served with vanilla ice cream.

This is my fault, but I got out the butter, frozen, in about 2 1/2 hours advance. I had to microwave it a bit. the butter would fold into the crisp, so I had to microwave the whole recipe. once I baked it, it wasn't very crispy. But it tasted DELICIOS!

Simple & perfect.  It's my go to and favorite autumn dessert.  I have tried it with one type of apple and a variety of apples.  I think the variety is a bit more fun with the different textures and flavors that come out.  It's hard not to eat the whole pan.  Thanks for sharing!

I tried this apple crisp for my first effort. It was made for my step mom's Halloween birthday. I didn't have enough crumble for the top so I had to add more.  I will next time double to make sure I have enough. Also not sure what I did wrong but the top never browned like I thought it would. The inside and bottom was good but I over cooked it since the top looks so light. I will try again if I can find out how to get the top crust to brown and be tasty like the bottom. My boyfriend liked it a lot and ate the left overs I brought home. People liked it but I was not happy with the end result.

This is the worst apple crisp recipe I have ever baked in my life- the apple mixture was so bland- it had no flavor at all- very disappointing- I really thought this would be a great recipe after reading the reviews but was not at all pleased.

I used 2 granny smith, 2 McIntosh apples and 2 honey crisp apples. It was wonderful. Not enough crisp, but easily fixed with doubling the crisp ingredients.

This is the first time I have ever made apple crispand I looked for a recipe that would work for my family. I had some leftover sliced apples from a work meeting that I wanted to make something out of and this came out fabulous!!! I made the apple crisp in a 13x9 pan and took it to work the next day. Oh, my goodness, but it disappeared in a big hurry!!! This was such a hit, that I am now making it for Thanksgiving with my new in-laws!

I have to agree with those who felt this is too dry, uses too much topping (and bottoming) and a load of butter.

Very good, except I thought it was a little dry. Next time I will add a little water before baking it so that it creates juice for the apples.

Fuji apples provided and excellent flavor and texture for this dish!  This is an easy recipe to 1/2 successfully if you're just baking for a few people.  I cut it in 1/2 and baked in 8 inch square baking dish. I didn't follow the recommended amount of apples in halfing.  Instead I heaped the pan and it worked out great!  I served it warm with vanilla bean ice cream and everyone loved it!

I felt the double layer of crumble was too much, if I make it again I will halve the dry goods and just crumble it on top of the apples after I spray a dish with nonstick spray.  Also I tried to cut down on the (HUGE) amount of butter this recipe calls for and started with only 1 cup, but it was way to dry looking and I ended up cutting in the other half cup, and still wasn't thrilled with the texture after baked, seemed too floury.  Good basic flavor but could use some tweaking.

I'd never made apple crisp before I tried making this, and it was quite good!  It just turned out a little dry, but that is likely because I reduced the butter without adding applesauce or anything in its place. Overall it's fast and delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I thought this was just ok. I reduced the flour to 1 1/2 cups like other reviewers recommended but the "Crisp" part of it was still too cake-like and not crispy enough.The bottom layer soaked up a lot of the apples' juice so they apples dried out a little more than I like.

I loved this recipe.  Especially the 'sandwiched apples' in the crumble. I had 11 medium sized Jonathan apples that made 2 pans of apple crisps.  Had to call the my sister to come and get a pan or I would have eaten it all.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Very disappointed. Always make a recipe first as written and then make personal adjustments if we like it well enough to make again -- won't happen with this one -- extremely dry and bland.

well 475 people can't be wrong, It was great I did add cranberrys which I'm sure didn't change the fact it is a goooood recipe for apple crisp. Next time I will not use granny smith, something  little sweeter and softer maybe and use quick oats but as written is great

I read this recipe over, because I thought I must have done something wrong.  I didn't...it lacked moisture.  I think the apples needed to be tossed around in some sugar & water or something.  It was very dry...like bakes apples with dry dry crumble on top?

The cumbly top-and-bottom crisp mixture is fabulous. Made a great, family dessert with vanilla ice cream. Even good the next day for a decadent breakfast! Everyone loved this, but the apple slices never really got soft enough for my taste. Next time, I will definitely cut the apples into smaller pieces rather than thick slices. I will also toss the apples with a bit of orange juice (trick from Ina Garten's recipe) before adding them to the dish.

This received rave reviews from my husband, my son, and my co-workers. This is the first apple crisp recipe I've tried (and I've tried more than a few) that tasted just sweet enough. Delicious!

i read several of the recipes before choosing this one.  it was the only one (that i saw) with the "crumbles" on the bottom as well as the top... such a good idea.  first time i made it, i did it exactly as instructed (but i cut it in half).    the next time i added freshly diced peaches.  are you kidding me?!? my mouth is watering just thinking about it. :)    it is amazing hot, but maybe even better cold the next day (if it makes it that long)....  :)

Summary of the changes I made: use tart apples, cut out the water completely, cut out some of the brown sugar since the topping seemed a bit too sweet, and add a touch of nutmeg and vanilla.  Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and this crisp is the best!

This was a hit in my house! I made it to surprise my girlfriend, and she has not talking about it since! VERY EASY TO MAKE! I took some time to learn how to properly slice apples so that they would not become soggy, once I got that together, GREATNESS! I added lemon juice, cinnamon, sugar, and nutmeg to the apples and tossed them around in the bowl, gave apples GREAT FLAVOR! Get some vanilla ice cream, and caramel sauce, and enjoy!

This is my second time preparing this recipe. Both times I substituted the brown sugar with splenda brown sugar (BS). While I was peeling my apples I used a lemon juice wash to keep them from browning. I also sprinkled cinnamom and a little splenda BS directly onto the apples before I put them in the baking dish. A dash or two of allspice into the flour/oats mixture too. Thank you so much for the recipe. In the past I have never used a bottom layer and its make it so much better!

I have wild blackberries all over my neighbourhood, & had picked several buckets.  Looking for a crumble recipe to utilize them, I came across this one, so just added blackberries to the apples, definitely upping the content of fruit as other members suggested.  The blackberries added so much juice I didn't feel the need to decrease the amount of flour, but I did sub in some flax flour, whole wheat flour, even a scant 1/4 c of bran snuck in there!  A big hit with my family, & even better after the first day! Oh, I did add a pinch of salt to the crumble mix, & lemon zest. Sooo juicy, I highly recommend the addition!

made only 1 layer of crumbs at the top, added a little bit of flour and cinnamon to my apples first. I would cut my flour a bit next time since the butter didnt cover everything. otherwise was very good, everyone raved.

I used a 8x8 pan instead of the 9x13 and layered it (three of the crisp, two apple) and with an extra bit of cinnamon on top, this turned out great.  I'll definitely make it again.

Followed the recipe *almost* exactly (ran out of butter, so we were short 1/4 cup).  Mmm-mm-good!  MUST be eaten w/ a scoop of ice cream or frozen yogurt.  I'm 4.5 months pregnant and I swear Baby wiggled with pleasure when I was eating this for dessert!

I really wanted to like this as much as everyone else.  I made this for a family dinner, and was embarrassed because it came out SO DRY.  Interestingly, my boyfriend's 16 y.o. step-brother LOVED it and begged for the leftovers.  Hmm.  Anyway, may try this again and add a bit of cider...?

It was okay, but it definitely needs more apples and I won't be using a bottom layer next time. Tossing the apples in cinnamon and white sugar will help a lot too I'm thinking. I'll be sure to make those adjustments next time.

Easy, fast and delicious recipe.  I made a 1/2 recipe to fit in a 9x9 and it fed 4 adults perfectly with some vanilla yogurt.  Would be good as leftovers for breakfast with yogurt and some nuts. I'll make it again!

Made this at Christmas time for my husband who wanted apple crisp. The top was very nice, crispy. I felt it was too many apples, but thats just my opinion. Needs a little more flavor, might want to add moe cinnamon. 1 tsp isn't very much for the amount that this make! Next time I am going to sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on the apples as well and reduce the amount of apples by 1/4.

Disappointing.  Made it as a desert, but it just lacked flavor and richness.  I think the apples were sliced too thin, used a food processor.  Could use some salt and something to make it less dusty...more cobbleresque.

This dish garnered rave reviews from everyone who ate it.  I made it a little differently in that I did the apples in a frying pan with a little butter, brown sugar, cinnamon until they were just about ready.  Then I made the crisp with the brown sugar and cinnamon that the recipe called for.  Baked it until the crisp was nice and ready and then pulled it out.  (about 30 minutes)

I halved the recipe and didn't layer it, just used it as a topping on my fresh apples. I didn't add the nutmeg. Wonderful, perfect and a delicious recipe. I added nuts to the crisp and it turned out great. The only crisp recipe I will ever used. I tried others but this is my favorite, not to sweet just right.

I couldn't find my apple crisp recipe, so I used this. I didn't peel the apples; just cored them and put them through the Cuisinart slicer. Baked at 375 to speed it up, so from start to finish it probably took around 50 minutes. The crisp smelled good and the kids liked it, but it tasted a little bland. If I made it again I would add more nutmeg and maybe more sugar.

The final product is really tasty. I think I may have used a bit too much apple and some of them were a little dry but the crumb mixture completely made this recipe worth the work. I dotted the top with a little butter about halfway through baking and it seems to have helped the dry apples. I will definitely make this again.

This was so easy and GREAT! I made it on a evening that was freezing. We had it with hot chocolate and it was yummy! My husband assumed I spent a long time on it because its so tasty. I will make it again when we have guests over for sure. They will be as impressed as my husband was.

I used grapefruit for about 1/4 of the fruit volume, which added enough sourness and moisture to be perfect for my taste.

Absolutely the best apple crisp recipe ever! I cut down on the butter (2 sticks instead of 3, because 3 is just too much!) and melted it instead of cutting it in, it makes the streusel MUCH better and more even! I also doubled the spices which never hurts. I've made this a couple times now and will continue to use this recipe.

I did not care for this recipe.  It was dry and bland. Had I known, I would have doubled the apples and cut the topping by half.  I know that the topping is the best part, but in this case, not good at all.

I served this at a party and heard nothing but compliments.  Easy recipe (apart from the apple peeling) and delicious-especially with a dollop of vanilla ice cream!  I used Granny Smith apples and 1/2 cup less flour as recommended by other reviewers.

Made this crisp but used 1/2 the flour and added fresh lemon juice.  I did not use enough butter the first time so ended up melting butter and pouring over and baking again to warm up.  Was very good and would make this again.

This recipe has great flavor, but is very dry. My suggestion would be to cut the flour by 1/2c or add frozen berries to give it some liquid.

very yummy.  got back from our local ochard today with extra apples and wanted to make a good fall dessert.  I doubled all ingredients but the butter because I ran out @ 2 cups, which was plenty.  I also cut the apples very thin and only baked for 40 min.  excellent apple crisp, thanks for the recipe.

This is a very good recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to use Apple Pie Spice in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg.  It turned out great!  My daughter absolutely LOVED this Apple Crisp!  I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This went over GREAT at a friends gathering! It was easy to grab one and go with the extra layer of oats. My friends want me to make this again, but this time add raisins and nuts for that little extra something. Pretty good the next morning for breakfast too!

Followed the recipe exactly, but came out dry and a little too sweet.  It might be because I adjusted the serving.  Will probably try it again but adjust the amount of apples and cook a little less.

The apples that are placed into the Crisp make the biggest difference! My crisp turned out to be a bit too dry because the apples that I chose didn't cook in its juices. Golden Delicious and Macintosh are wonderful to use, to compliment the drier thick, oatmeal batter.

Pretty good. I used organic brown sugar which added a nice taste. I did think that there was too much topping and would add more apples to it the next time. Also needs to cook a little longer than recommended in the recipe in order for the apples to be soft. But it still tastes good with crunchy apples.

I made this for my guy friends when I went home from college for Thanksgiving.... now every time I go home or any of them come visit, they beg me to make it for them... They absolutely love it! It's great. I made a few changes, like mixing some of the sugar in with apples before adding them.

this recipe is healthy (when you sub butter for a healthier alternative!), quick and easy to prepare and a hit w/ everyone.  instead of apples, i used 4 cans of cling peaches in a light sauce.  yum yum!

Taste is good, texture was a bit dry for our family's tastes.  Apples also didn't cook down as much as we like in the time it was cooked.  The crisp wasn't really crisp... it was more pasty in texture, likely too much flour or not enough butter.  But taste was good as far as flavor goes.  Just wasn't the texture we were looking for.

This is a great base recipe but needs to be modified quiet a bit. I followed others advise with the flour and oats, and adding more apples, cinnamon, lemon and sugar. BUT it is lacking moisture. I would make this again, but would have to saturate the apples so that it isn't so dry.

Quick, easy recipe. Having been gifted with 50 lbs of apples, I've used this recipe several times and have modified it a bit. I agree with the reviewers below that the amount of flour should be reduced. I reduced the amount by about 25%, and increased the amount of oats a little bit. I also added more cinnamon. All in all, very good recipe, especially after you take out some of the flour.

I made this last night because we had a lot of extra apples and it was a disappointment. I had followed the suggestions of other reviewers but to no avail. It was not sweet enough and the crisp was soggy. Will not be making again.

This is so easy and tastes so much better than pie.  The crispy top and bottom make it special.  I used a 13.5x2" round Pampered Chef stoneware bake pan (rather than 9x13) and it comes out fabulous.

This is the best apple crisp recipe to date. I made it for company and it was a hit with everyone. I followed the suggestion to reduce the flour by 1/2 cup and that worked out well. Due to the amount of topping, next time I would either cut the recipe in 1/2 and just put it on top or add more apples.

This was very good, though the topping didn't get as crisp as I would've liked. I used 2/3 the topping amounts since I was short on ingredients, and that was a good amount of topping for the 2qt of sliced apples.

Very dry. Stuck to the bottom of the pan, tasted too floury, I thought it should have had a bubbly thing with cooking. Probably won't try this one again. Sorry

Excellent...I get compliments on this everytime, sometimes I add some strawberries for a little extra flavour and colour. I also add a little extra cinnimon and brown suger too, just for a little extra spice.

I thought this reciepe was wonderful, I brought this crisp to work and they all loved it. One of the girls father (a retired baker)heard how good it was and insisted on having the recipe.  I did add a bit more sugar, that is all the changes I made. I'll make this one again.

I live in Peru and was looking for an Apple Crisp recipie for a meeting. I baked this and brownies.  The apple crisp was a hit compared to the brownies and I got many compliments on it, including a request for the recipie.  I did cut the flour to 1 1/2 c. but other than that it turned out awesome. I will use it again!

Very Yummy.  I halved the apples (there's only 2 of us) but kept the topping amount the same.  Like other reviewers I only put in a fraction of the water.  Will definately make this again and again and again.

This was very yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a tiny bit less nutmeg because I don't like it that much.  It was perfect, and I got rave reviews from my friends! It was very easy, great with vanilla ice cream, and also filled the house with a delicious scent while baking!

Yummy! I loved the two layers of crisp, there never seems to be enough crisp but this one was perfect! I ran out of brown sugar so I used one cup of white sugar along with the half cup of brown, and I substituted apple sauce instead of apples (I always do that).  My baking time was less since I didn't have to wait for the apples.  I'm keeping this recipe! Thanks!

I had a big bag of old soft apples left so I put a couple TBLs of lemon juice on them.  Half way through baking I thought it looked dry so I poured a bit of water in.  Results were the best apple crisp I have ever had in my life.
I will always use this recipe.

This topping is great. I make a double batch and store it in my freezer. Then it's easy and quick to make a delicious dessert. I only use it on top and often mix apples with pears, peaches or dried cranberries.

This was exactly the kind of recipe I was looking for.  I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 pyrex dish.  It was exactly sweet enough without being too sweet.  I would reduce the nutmeg by a little the next time I make the recipe.  The topping was not terribly crumbly, but was still very, very good.

Pretty good, I found, like others, that the recipe calls for a bit more flour then is actually needed. I added extra cinnamon and served warm with vanilla ice cream.

The topping was really good and the apples stayed very firm.  I used all Gala apples, next time I will probably mix in a more juicy type of apple also.  This easy recipe made quite a bit of topping, I made a 9x9 and 8" round batch from this recipe, and I used more thatn 2 quarts of apples.  Next time I will try mixing some of the topping in with the apples.

This is definitely a hit and very easy as well!  I've had good luck varying the fruits as well.  I agree with others--tossing the apples with cinnamon sugar before baking makes it better.

This was an excellent recipe!! it was all gone the first night. Used a little less flour than called for, and more brown sugar... esp if you like it sweet. overall A+++++!!!

I love this recipe.  It is so easy and it is delicious!!  The first time I made it, I didn't change a thing.  This time I had a smaller crowd and made half the recipe in an 8x8 dish.  I warmed it in a 200* oven while we ate dinner and served it with coffee and ice cream.  There is no need to try any other apple crisp recipe!

This is a good recipe if you especially enjoy the topping of an apple crisp.  The only thing I would change is to cut down on the amount of flour used, as it does tend to have a strong flour texture and flavor.  I took other reviewers advice and tossed my apples in cinnamon sugar before baking.  Be forewarned, it does make a lot!  We were eating this for days!  Overall a good recipe for a weeknight dessert.

I was a little disappointed.  I like the crisp to be a little more sugary and less floury than this was.

I have tried many apple crisp recipes and this one is absolutely the very best!  My whole family loved it and asked for more.  One slightly improvement I made to the recipe, is that I added a bit of flour, sugar and cinammon to my apples....ummmm so good!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This was sooooo good.  I loved it with the topping on the bottom also.  I did add some cinnamon and sugar to the apples though prior to adding them to the dish.  WIll definitely make again and again.

We have an apple tree which produced many pounds of fruit this year.  This recipe was the answer to what do I do with all of them?  Several people have said that it is better after sitting for awhile.  Not in this house!  There never is any left over.

This is a great recipe. I omitted the nutmeg and used about 1/4 cup more oatmeal and it turned out great.  I have made it 4 times in the last 3 weeks.  YUM!!

After a long day of lots of apple picking,I was looking for the perfect apple crisp recipe--and I found it!   It's quick to prepare (though I'd get the butter to room temp first it's easier) and halves easily.  A definite keeper--and I'll never look for another apple crisp recipe again. It just melts in your mouth.

Was really good but I didn't find it quite sweet enough.  I would add a little more brown sugar next time.  It definately got better the longer it sat:)

This is a wonderful recipe!  Its quick and easy and tastes great.  For those of us who thinks the crumb is the best part, this is the best recipe.  It has two layers of crumb.
