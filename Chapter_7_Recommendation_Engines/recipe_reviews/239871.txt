Thank you for this recipe; yes, recipe.  And to all of you elitists who dissed it:  shame on you.  We're not all gourmet cooks as you must be.  Let's be positive and encouraging as we review.

Egg sandwiches are a staple in this house - in many shapes and forms. I was curious to try this one as it had the addition of mayonnaise and mustard. I used toasted whole grain bread and opted to add a slice of cheese. I liked the mayo and mustard combo, but will probably go back to my old standard...ketchup. My husband enjoyed his and of course had to add some bacon! Overall, very good especially with a side of fresh fruit and OJ. Definitely one of those "don't knock it until ya try it" kind of recipes - and I'm glad I tried it!

I made this using the same ingredients, just different method;) I cooked the egg, mixed with a little milk, salt and pepper, in a bowl in the microwave for about 1 min 30 seconds. While doing that I toasted my bread in the toaster. When the toast was done, I set both slices on a cookie sheet, I turned on the broiler, and added the cooked egg and a slice of cheese to one piece of the toast. To the other slice of toast, I spread some mayo and mustard on it, and then added a couple slices of honey ham. Then I broiled the open faced sandwich for about 3-4 minutes to melt the cheese:) Once done, I put a few drops of red hot sauce on it, and put it together:) It was absolutely delicious! Never had an egg sandwich with mustard and mayo, but I'm hooked now! I usually just used ketchup, but the mayo mustard gives the sandwich a new, unique flavor! ??

Egg sandwiches are wonderful. I have been eating them for about 3 decades. Most people say that sounds nasty, but you just have to try it and taste it to understand just how delicious they are morning, noon, evening and night. Good eating??

This is an interesting take on an egg sandwich. I have fried scrambled eggs like this before to put on a sandwich, so the cooking method was familiar to me.  I usually just use butter or melted cheese on my toast. The mayo and mustard gave it a bit of an "egg salad" flavor. (I used much less than the 2 T mayo--I just spread a thin layer on each side.) Also, I added a sprinkle of shredded cheese to mine. It was good, but I don't know that I'll make it again, but I can see some people really liking this.

I have been eating scrambled egg sandwiches for over 50 years.  I like to slice the green blades of green onions and a little finely minced jalapeno pepper to enhance the flavor. I like the mayo/mustard combo but also like a mayo/catsup or a mayo/horseradish sauce combo.  When I have leftover boiled crawfish I add about a couple of tablespoons to the beaten eggs.  Heavy cream instead of milk gives a delicious creamy texture if you cook the eggs slowly and stir slowly to form big curds.  Don't forget to take the eggs up slightly before they reach the doneness you like since they will continue to cook a little.

Surprisingly good! I thought I'd hate it, as I'm so fond of my very loose scrambled eggs. But these were soft and fluffy. The mayo tones down the mustard and adds to the creaminess. And the mustard adds a nice tang. Try it!

My favorite sandwich growing up was scrambled eggs. My mom always made it with mayo, ketchup and dill pickles. Today this is my favorite go-to meal when we are short on groceries. Everyone else thinks it's weird, but the ketchup and dill pickles make it pop!

I've been making this for years and didn't know it was odd!  The only slight difference is that I add a slice of American cheese, and leave out the mustard.  The eggs do really well scrambled in a microwave.  And a tip- if you spray the bowl with cooking spray first, clean up is super easy.

Made as recipe for two , doubled the ingredients. I will make this very good sandwich again.
Turned right around and made two more as recipe, only added a slice of pre wrapped cheddar to each. With or with out cheese the sandwich is very good. A tip on cooking the eggs if thay spread out in a larger pan just cut down center to form two half moons, put half  of one half moon on toast than fold over other half. If using cheese place slice on bottom half and than fold over other half this will also melt the cheese.

Having grown up in an Italian family  this was a staple in our home. There were many variations  adding pepperoni, taylor ham (pork roll) ,  bologna,  peppers and onion,  potatoes. Not all at the same time mind you. Over 50 years later we enjoy this as a dinner with some soup on those days when not in the mood to cook anything fancy. My difference from Nona is I prepare my eggs the same way as the author. I rated this 5 stars not as a recipe cause there really is none perse but cause it's a reminder of much better times and the simplicity at which a good meal can be made. Thank you.

Wait, I thought I invented this sandwich although mine is a little different. I use fresh market Baloney about 1/4 in thick. Fry it . I put some mild cheddar in with the eggs, make an omelet, add tomato slices and no mustard. I absolutely love this sandwich.

Thank you Tom, delicious! If you're in the mood, try adding dill pickle, a thick slice of tomato, and a little lettuce. And if you want to go nuts, sliced thin onion!

This is an old "bachelors special" that stands the test of time. Personally I prefer to add a slice of cheese & usually use horseradish rather than mustard. Garlic salt is a good substitute for regular salt. Also adding chopped fried onions is good as well.
 Great when you are pressed for time or are just too lazy to prepare a "real" meal.

My take was a little more complex but oh baby.  I dispensed w/the salt, used a slightly sweetened dijon that I mixed into the egg mix before cooking.   I chopped up 2 sweet onion slices and 3 mini sweet peppers (red,yellow, and orange).  Nuked those  for a 40 sec..  Added it to the uncooked egg mixture w/ fresh dill and basil leaves chopped with scissors nixed in. 

Now nuke 2 minutes and serve on the mayo-ed toast.  Bam!  Good eatin.

It helps having that summer herb garden;-D

Good stuff. My take on this are two over-easy/medium with
bacon (and a few napkins, for the few lost drops). Mayo and
no mustard, but add a little horseradish to the mayo:)

I've always used mustard & mayo on my scrambled egg sandwiches. Add grated pepper jack, sliced tomatoes or avocado -depending on what's on hand. We have this several times a week!

Kick it up a bit and add some hot sauce or even use a little ranch dressing instead of mayo. Another variation is add a slice of cheese in the egg just after turning it. One more option is to add a little garlic powder to the eggs before cooking them.

A few years ago a friend was making egg sandwiches for her children and offered me one.  When she asked if I wanted mustard along with the mayo I wrinkled my nose at it until she reminded me that many people put a little mustard in egg salad for a little zip.  Made sense to me - I tried it and loved it.  I bet most everyone will also.

This has been my "go to" recipe for egg sandwich for as long as I can remember, including Mayo and mustard. I use to add a bit of ketchup but since dropped that (because of fructose corn syrup) and occasionally add a slice of cheese. LOVE IT!

I substituted ranch dressing for the mayonnaise because I don't like mayonnaise and Dijon mustard for yellow mustard cause I prefer Dijon. I also added a slice of processed cheese and a squirt sriracha into the eggs before cooking.

I've made egg sandwiches using mayo all my life. I also butter my toast before adding the mayo. Mustard for me is optional. I also like cheese melted on top of the eggs or a lot of the time I sprinkle shredded cheddar in with the eggs then scramble. The eggs can be cooked a number of different ways as long as you don't over cook them or let them get any brown crispy spots. Eggs should be cooked gently.

Glad I found this.  I mixed it up some... made it all on an electric griddle.  Buttered bottom of bread and put cheese on it like making a grilled cheese, then cut up a couple sausage patties and spread on top of melted cheese, spread some mayo/mustard and topped with the eggs (I used 3).  I make egg sandwiches all the time, usually fried.  This was excellent!

I make this ALL THE TIME!  Didn't realize it was a thing!  I make my scrambled eggs and then put it on toast -- no mayo or mustard, just because I do this at work, so it's a but more to carry into the office!

The reason I decided to try it was the reviewer that remarked it was deviled eggs on toast.  It was tasty and quite easy to make and I think I'll make all my egg sandwiches like this from now on.  I did think 2 eggs per sandwich was a little too much, but one scrambled egg seemed just perfect.  Luckily I have a frying pan about the size of a sandwich.  Thanks so much for turning me on to something nice in my advanced age of 75.

Been doing this for years. I change it up most times by adding sausage or bacon unless I don't have either. I always usually add a slice of pepper jack cheese and some sriracha sauce, tomato, onion, yeah, I like to spice it up a bit.  Sometimes I add all the above to my sandwich and sometimes not because sometimes I don't have a ripe tomato.  I love just plain old onion with mayo and mustard and sometimes just with mustard. Have you ever tried that?? If you love onion, you'll love the onion sandwich, too.

08.03.17 ~ Another egg sandwich for breakfast, this week.  This is pretty much how I make an egg sandwich, although I have never added mustard.  I liked the mustard, but still prefer it with just the mayonnaise.  Paired it with a couple of slices of cantaloupe and I was good until supper time.

I will definitely make it again. The only change I made was  to add shredded cheddar cheese on top of egg in skillet just before taking out to place on toast.  The next time I make it I will probably add jalapeños!

I've  been making egg  sandwiches like this for over 50 yrs, tho originally we used miracle whip in place of mayo. This is the simple version but my dad had his own specialty scrambled egg sandwich. Cook bacon & toast bread. Put mustard on one slice & then layer w/sliced dill pickle. Homemade chili sauce & bacon on other slice. Scrambled egg in middle. Pure heaven. My mom would never try because she said the thought of eggs, dill pickles & chili sauce together cuddled her stomach, but it's another gotta try combos.

First time I made it Exactly as listed.   2nd time I added onions and cheese per my husbands request.  Was a little nervous on the mayo and mustard, bu he loved it.  I normally make him a breakfast burrito but thanks to running into this recipe, this is what I know make every morning with his bacon.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

I liked this recipe but I, unfortunately misread the ingredients & used ground mustard which I mixed with the egg mixture.  It tasted great.  I think I may prefer the dry mustard to the yellow mustard, but will try again as written.

Delicious! I followed the recipe as written - but added a few drops of tabasco sauce on top of the egg. Thank you historiker.

Really quite tasty......mayo & mustard give it a nice zingy flavor.  I fixed them for our lunch and served with fresh garden tomatoes.  May reduce the mayo a bit next time. My husband is a fan of fried egg sandwiches and he really liked this .I will make again.

This was a staple at our house that my mom made when I was growing up.  Through the years, I have modified it to the heartiest seed and grain wheat bread toasted, two eggs broken into a buttered skillet and once the whites start to set, the yolks are broken with the spatula and when the eggs are more set, flip and cook through.  Fold over the eggs and place on a buttered piece of the toasted wheat bread.  Salt and pepper the eggs while in the skillet, it desired.  I don't like mayonnaise and I can't imagine mustard on my eggs.  Slightly different recipe, but a great sandwich!

My grandmother used to make the same thing when we walked home from school for lunch in the mid sixties, but without the mustard. First I was hesitant about the warm mayo, but till this day, love it!! I put mustard in my deviled eggs and egg salad, so now I have to try it on this. Thanks for the memories of true comfort food, can't be any easier than that!!

We love this in my house, its a quick easy breakfast.  It's a simple recipe, and  I think because it is so simple and easy, it's something that most people wouldn't think of trying.  It IS however,  worth it to get to try a wonderful alternative to those boring plain eggs in the morning.  I love  this recipe as is and with alteration :) hot sauce! bacon! horseradish in the mayo! so much to do with this, thank you for posting!

Good, but mine is better.  Try a BLT (bacon, lettuce, tomato) with a fried or scrambled egg as you like your egg, but use mayo on one side of the toast and peanut butter on the other piece of toast.  The peanut butter really turns on the egg sandwich...more than mustard!

I have been having these scrambled egg sandwiches for over 40+ years.  My mom used to make this for me.  I like it with Helmans mayonnaise only.  My mom likes to use mayo with Dijonaise.

This was very easy to make, made it exactly as printed.  I didn't have a small fry pan which  cooked the eggs larger then the bread, which was ok just had to flip to bread size when adding it to the toasted bread.  The mayo and mustard was just the right combo which gave it a great flavor.

Shorter cooking time is the only difference I would suggest, otherwise, this is spot on. As can be seen from the many comments, lots of variations are good too, personally I like Miracle Whip in place of the mayo, but to each their own.  If you're in a hurry, untoasted bread is good as well.

Nothing scrambled about the egg in the pan. Mustard and Mayo are standard in deviled eggs.  I would just scramble the eggs in the pan to avoid flipping.  And keep them soft and moist.

Eggs and may go together like peanut butter and jelly (think egg salad or deviled eggs).  I have never made an egg sandwich without mayo, unthinkable!

I've been making these for over 50 years.  We call them "Jailhouse Sandwiches" because our city jail used to serve them for breakfast to the overnight guests.   I've tried all kinds of variations but simple is the best.  Use white bread, toast it lightly, spread with mayo, add a slice of American cheese and a piece of crisp bacon, then layer on the scrambles.  Delicious!

5 stars  -  I also have been using this for many years. Great to make for those drives to work or where ever. I sometimes add herbs or chives and change up the cheese. Try smoked Gouda or Swiss with chopped ham and left over veggies. Different breads too.

Just a serving suggestion some may not have thought of: after the eggs are cooked, cut them as you would a pie into four identical pieces (like a circle with an x on it). Then, when you put the eggs on the bread/toast, fit one square corner of each egg piece into a corner of the bread. No trimming, no "hangout," and the eggs are distributed more evenly.

I'm giving it 5 stars simply because you've reminded me to make egg sandwiches more often!! This recipe is the quintessential home style recipe in my family. I'm from SoCal and grew up on these (I'm past the 1/2 decade mark)... Any bread'll do, but one of my two kids prefers it with a slice of bacon, slice of cheddar and on a VERY lightly toasted buttered English muffin.... But that's a bit more work :-) Thanks for posting

I don't put mustard on it .  I just use the mayonnaise. We make all kinds of egg sandwiches, scrambled, fried, open face poached, and egg salad sandwiches all with just the eggs and mayo.

Grew up making scrambled egg sandwiches and still a favorite comfort food. We buttered the bread, added shredded cheese to the eggs and added 2 strips cooked bacon when assembling together. Just made this for my grandson yesterday.

I've always done mine with ketchup and mayonnaise. It wasn't until I met my husband and he added mustard to the mix. Sometimes we'll put American or cheddar cheese. Delicious and simple.

I've had egg sandwiches throughout my life (and I'm 61 years old!).  I usually fry up a couple of eggs, cook them over/medium and put them on toasted bread that's been spread with Miracle Whip.  Salt and pepper to taste and that's it.  A neat little breakfast sandwich with very little work.

I've been making this since I was a kid. (50 years ) but I don't like the mustard and mayo. I use plain old bread or toast with butter..  I also add onions peppers...ham sausage  sometimes. But just plain old scrambled is awesome. Simple and easy!!

I've been eating scrambled egg sandwiches for almost 50 years. The only difference in my sandwiches are I use Miracle Whip and at times I butter my toast. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I did not care for the mayo.

This is a staple for breakfast in our house. I add fresh spinach, sautee first then add the scramble eggs.   Fresh basil will work as well.

I have been making egg sandwiches since the age of 7 !! I make them for my husband TOM, my way is to use whole wheat bread, crust trimmed off (he doesn't like it toasted) with mayo, slices crisp bacon.  
We love egg sandwiches.

I cooked the  beaten egg mixture in the microwave for 1 min 30 seconds in a paper bowl.  Mixed the mayo and mustard together, put half on each slice of toast.  Removed the egg from the microwave I added a slice of cheese and a thin slice of  ham, then put back in the microwave for 30 seconds until it melted the cheese.  Put between the toast slices.  Yum.  Great way to not heat up the kitchen on a hot morning.

I have made egg sandwich that way all my life and I am 81. I break an egg in the skillet..'kill' it with a knife and make the yellow run and turn it once. They I put mayo and mustard on two  pieces of  bread and Voila...fried egg sandwich..and remember you use mayo and mustard on boiled eggs when you stuff them so what's the difference..and a bag of Cheetos and you have a breakfast sandwich on the run..

This is going to be my new go-to fried egg sandwich. I didn't change anything, and it doesn't need any changes. I use a mayo/mustard as a sauce on chicken sometimes, never thought of using it on eggs. Really good.

Simply  replace the mustard with catsup and you have the classic egg sandwich.

We lived on these in the college days.  Delicious, but minus the mustard which I don't care for.  The eggs and mayonnaise are perfect together on toast.  It's definitely a comfort food.

I have been eating egg sandwiches for over 40 years.  I started calling them Egg Pie sandwiches to distinguish from scrambled eggs on toast.

I have been making this breakfast sandwich for years.  It's my go to recipe for hurried mornings.  The only thing that I do differently is add one slice of American cheese to the warm egg.  Yummy. Definitely do not omit that little bit of mustard because it makes all the difference between ho hum and really good.

We enjoy the egg sandwich fairly regular around here. We skip the mustard.  We  add green chili and serve it in a flour tortilla to give it a southwestern flare.

I've used same ingredients but with a boiled egg.  Give egg a rough chop and add Dijon mustard light mayonnaise and a bit of Siracha salt and pepper. Mix it all up. Spread it on toast or saltine crackers.... Yummmmmmy!!!

My Mom made this for me as a kid and I've been making them ever since (I'm 44)!  Sometimes I toast my bread and sometimes I don't.   I also add a little butter to the frying pan to cook the eggs in.  Love them!  Also try making the exact same sandwich with sliced boiled eggs instead of scrambled eggs (Best hangover cure ever)!!!!!

I have made these for years. Never used mustard. Will have to try that.  I like to stir the eggs and put a slice of cheese on it when it almost done so it melts a little.
