We loved this recipe and I really don't care for cauliflower.  The only change I would make is double the seasoning.

This is really good and I am not a fan of riced cauliflower. Only recommendation i would suggest is a smaller pan size. Spread this thin it can get a bit hard. I only naked mine 18 minutes so that wouldn't happen.
Glad I have it a try.

Everyone loved this recipe. I did the steps a little different with the meat and onions together. I also used a head of cauliflower chopped up small- same taste. Used taco seasoning- it was filling and yummy! :) Will make it again.
