A nice twist on cooked fennel. Serve extra "dressing" on the side; it's delicious as a dip for bread too! :-) Thank you for the recipe.

This was delicious. If you like fennel, you'll love it and even if you're not a fennel fan,  you'll still love it!  Dressing is perfect and goes so well with the fennel.  I used some extra dressing as a pasta dressing with some butter.  Awesome!

Delicious! I also used the dressing on some squash I grilled along with the fennel. Will definitely be making this again!
