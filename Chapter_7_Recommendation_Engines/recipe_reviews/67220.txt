I made this for our 3rd annual "friends"(no family)Thanksgiving.  I always want a cranberry dish for some color and I have made some cranberry dishes that do nothing more than look pretty.  I was really pleased how well this went over.  It got 2 thumbs up from quite a few guests. I will make this again and for more than just Thanksgiving.

I put the apple chunks(with peels on) and cranberries in the food processor to chop them up.  Then served with vanilla ice cream as a dessert.  It's like an apple and cranberry crisp but is heavy on the cranberries--which is good!!!  I actually cut the white sugar down to less than a 1/2 cup.  That seems strange for a dessert but the ice cream adds plenty of sugar and sweetness.

Absolutely delicious.  Hearty and sweet.  My family loved this for Christmas dinner.  My Aunt couldn't stop eating it.

Thank you, BRITTM! What a great recipe. My mother and I both adore it. I scale back on the amounts of sugar and butter in the recipe, and I add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping. I buy fresh cranberries on sale after Christmas, store them in the freezer and make this recipe all winter long.

Okay recipe.  I'd make it again, but don't think I'd serve it to guests.  Not sweet at all, which is good.  I liked eating it warm with some low-fat vanilla ice cream on top to cut the tartness.  Liked the nutritional value with the fruit and oatmeal.  A good breakfast food or snack.

I'm not sure what "glop" means, but it doesn't sound particularly appetizing. To the contrary, this dessert dish *is* very good. It's similar to apple crisp, but because of the tartness of the cranberries, it's has a bit of a sweet and sour vibe. The chopped pecans make it pop. Another reviewer suggested adding dashes of cinnamon on top, which would probably be a nice embellishment. We served it with French Vanilla ice cream, which was great. Whipped topping or a Cool Whip type product would also be good. After it cools, you can warm individual servings up in the microwave for 45 seconds or so for just the right warm up time.

This was good. I chopped up the cranberries briefly in the food processor instead of leaving them whole. It was missing just something, so we sprinkled cinnamon on it to serve. Also we had whipped cream on top.  Those two adjustments made it just right.

I had a bag of cranberries and didn't know what I wanted to make with it. This recipe was wonderful. LOVED it! I used walnuts only because I didn't have pecans. I also chopped up the fruit as other reviewers recommended. I will definitely make this again.

With a mix of sweet and tart, crunchy and tender, this dish made a surprisingly good dessert at a recent potluck. It was so easy and tasty, I'm making it again soon.

I wasn't really impressed with this dish nor was my family. Maybe it because we were having stuffing which was the same consistency.  I did make fresh cranberry sauce just in case and boy I am sure glad I did.  It still sitting in the fridge and I rarely have leftovers!

We all loved it.  It was easy to make.  I made it for the guy who gave me the cranberries and the comments around him during break time at work were. "It sounds like he is having sex."  He liked it a lot.

The “glop” in the title makes this recipe sound unappetizing, but this is really good.  I added a smidgeon of cinnamon in the topping as recommended by other reviewers and topped the dessert with whipped cream and also vanilla ice cream.   Also, I combined the flour and brown sugar before cutting in the butter for better distribution, then mixed in the chopped pecans and oats.

Delicious! My one critique is the areas of the topping that wasn't dotted with butter didn't bake well. I made it again,' melting the butter to mix with the oatmeal topping before spreading over the top, and I liked it much better that way. Excellent recipe!

Great recipe with a fun name... I turned it from a dessert into an awesome workday breakfast by using coconut sugar, whole wheat flour, and serving with plain yogurt instead of ice cream. It was a fine dessert with ice cream too! Was worried it might not be sweet enough, but autumn glory apples made up the difference I think. But on workday mornings I can throw some in a bowl, warm in the microwave oven, and plop on some yogurt to eat while I do my email... ??

reduce cooking time by 20 minute when you use apple pie filling and whole-berry cranberry sauce. no cover needed. remove from oven when flour-oat topping is fully cooked and slightly browned on top.

I have made this twice in one week! I substituted almond flour and Splenda both times. It was delicious! I did add cinnamon to the topping and some orange zest to the fruit. I will make this whenever I have cranberries!

I would have added some spice to the topping as well as I would have incorporated the butter into the topping mix.  I plan to make it again with those modifications.  Overall it was good and quite simple to make.

I used frozen cranberries (accidentally got at the store). Reduced the amount of white sugar as well as butter.  Also used coconut flour instead of regular flour.  It was delicious.  Will make again for sure.

I am making this AGAIN this year for our family friends Thanksgiving dinner.  I have many who asked me to make it again.  This will become a mainstay and alternative to the canned cranberry side I grew up eating.  My daughter said it’s good for dessert as well and after seeing others say the same  , there will never be any leftovers of this fish!  Love it and simple to make!

It's a good concept, but it was unpleasantly sweet. The topping to filling ratio was way off, and there was simply much too much sugar all around. If you doubled the amount of fruit  and decreased the sugar in the filling, and used less topping, it would have promise.  Also, it would be better to mix the butter into the crumble mixture. It makes a lot (even halving the recipe) and it was too sweet for us to finish.

I made this recipe with some homemade cranberry sauce that never set up and was forgotten in the fridge during Thanksgiving dinner. The sauce recipe was a bag of cranberries, 1 cup of sugar, and some water.  So I started with that and then followed the recipe  with the apples and topping, except I added about a cup of slice strawberries I had on hand and I didn’t use the whole half cup of butter.  It turrned out really well, though I would definitely go back down to 3/4 cup sugar if starting from scratch. This was delicious warm with a scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt on top!

Made this the other day to get rid of my leftover fresh fruit and it was very simple to make.  It was delicious especially while still warm served over vanilla ice cream.  I think next time though I will add a little more sugar due to the tart berries.

We didn't have pecans so I used chopped almonds. It was a very good side dish. A friend of mine serves this along with chicken or beef meals instead of as a dessert.

I added a dash of cinnamon but other than that - it turned out great.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year, because traditional cranberry sauce is not much of a hit with my family.  Everyone enjoyed this, and even the leftovers disappeared quickly.   Was not too tart, not too sweet. And it still worked in turky/stuffing/cranberry sandwiches next day.  So, I think this recipe is a keeper.

It was delicious, thank you. I made it without the nuts since kids have allergies and still was heavenly, Just the right combination, but i will add more apples next time.

Super good - Everyone including my three and five year old nieces loved it.  Only change was adding cinnamon to the apple/cranberry mix.

My family loved this especially with ice-cream.  It was gone in two days.  It had a tart taste but the ice-cream gave it that sweet taste.  Very good.

So GOOD!!!  I took advice from other reviewers, made it sweeter (used both white and brown sugar) and added cinnamon to both the fruit mixture and sprinkled on the top.  Also sprinkled a bit of nutmeg.  I couldn't tell from other reviewers whether they considered this a side dish or a dessert, but it's definitely dessert the way I make it.  Best cranberry/apple recipe I've found.

I agree with another reviewer who stated that "glop" isn't an appetizing choice of words...for what turns out to be an absolutely delicious (and not too sweet) dessert. I'm not a dessert person, but do enjoy fruity desserts when I have (or make) them and this one is definitely a keeper!

Good for what it is but it is very sweet and I was really looking for something a little more like oatmeal crisp and this is more apple crisp plus cranberry.

Delicious.  Next time I will add a little more sugar to the fruit, since I'm not serving it with ice cream. This is easy to make.

Loved it but we ate it as dessert since it was sweet, its more of a cranberry crumble.  Very yummy!!

This was good but it needs cinnamon and more brown sugar 1 cup or more you want it to be like pie.
