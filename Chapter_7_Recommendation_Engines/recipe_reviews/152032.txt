Loved this!  The broth was the best part.  I doubled the recipe and served with white rice, cilantro, limes, hotsauce and tortillas (to sop up the juice).  I will be making this again and next time plan on trying the tostones with it.  I also wanted to mention that I made this in the slow cooker; after marinating I placed everything in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours and it was so tender and flavorful.  When I walked in the door after work I was drooling. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

Very authentic tasted like my mothers.  I felt the marinade was not a enough so I added two cups of broths and 2/3 cup of vinegar.

This is one of my favorite dishes EVER! I love garlic so I always add a bunch more than called for. Sometimes I also add a bay leaf in there while it is simmering. Using sirloin ensures that your meat will be tender but traditionally cubed steak is used. Sirloin has a better texture though!!! I highly recommend it! (Serve with arroz blanco and tostones)

Authentic, delicious, and fast!  In the morning, I just put all of the ingredients in a plastic container.  Then when it was time to make dinner, I poured the entire meal into a pot & cooked for about an hour.  I didn't have any beef stock, so I used water & chicken bullion.  It was delicious!  I served it with white rice & the entire family loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Very easy to make. Meat was very moist. I cut a london broil that I didn't have time to grill. The only downside was that the vinegar gave it such a tangy taste. I had to add a pinch or two of sugar to calm the taste down. It worked though. I served it over rice. Not a spoonful left in the pan so I think it went over well!

This is my favorite meal that my grandmother makes.  I wasn't sure if this was the same recipe she uses because she doesn't use beef stock, she uses water instead.  She also uses cube steak because it "soaks" up the marinade better.  Aside from that, the smell and taste was the SAME!  I will be making this again and again!!

Thank you thank you thank you for posting this. I lived with my ex in Puerto Rico for a year and this was one of my favorite dishes. However not speaking spanish and having no idea how to pronounce the dish people looked at me like I was crazy while trying to remember how to make it..... By the way, how is it pronounced?

Delicious! I followed the directions to a tee, except I did add a little bit more vinegar and marinated overnight. It tasted so much like my grandmother's. Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe.  I used a beef chuck pot roast and cut it up into cubes instead. I marinated it for about 5 hours.  This one is a keeper!

My boyfriend is Puerto Rican and does not cook but misses his native food. I have been looking for recipes and found this one. I made it along with sofrito black beans. The only thing I did differently was add 1/3 cup of sofrito. My boyfriend love it. He ate all of it! What a smile this dish put on his face. Thank you for sharing.

Good flavor, tried without beef stock and still had wonderful flavor, but I like my onions more tender so would cook longer.

The only additional things I did was add a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste and a whole tomato to give this a richer color. Amazing!

This recipe was just ok. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't use this recipe again. I doubled the spices called for and my family still found it to be too bland.  We also found the meat to be dry even though I used ribeye steaks instead of sirloin. This recipe is definitely not like any Puerto Rican food I've ever had.

I made this recipe for a Puerto Rican friend of mine who requested "Bistec in Salsa" - steak in red sauce. I bought stew beef for the cut, marinated overnight, and then cooked at a simmer for several hours with the lid on. I added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce (Goya brand) in the last hour, which increased the amount of sauce and added really great flavor and color. I served this with white rice, and black beans as directed by the package (dried beans, soaked, cooked with onions, garlic, green pepper, and sazon, simmered for a couple of hours). 

Would definitely make again and I am excited to share this with guests!

I made this as written and was a bit worried it did not make enough marinade.  However, it turned out perfectly and I have a great new recipe to add to the rotation. 

I left the marinading steak in the fridge for a day before cooking and served over some white rice with a bit of lime and cilantro added.  (Adding lime to the side of rice or each bowl of stew istelf will be mandatory whenever I serve this because, as others have said, it really adds something special to this recipe.)  

Thank you for sharing!

This was such a delicious recipe and so easy to follow, it was my first time ever making it at home but it came out perfect!!! I served it with tostones and white rice. Just a note, I did double up on the marinade as suggested in the comments and I tweaked it slightly by using a packet and 1/2 of sazon and some adobo. (I also didn’t use full tsp of salt since the sazon and adobo already has salt in it) Thanks for sharing I will definitely be making it again.

I would rate 3, but my husband would rate 4 stars. However, he did not initially taste it alone as he consumed it with yellow rice also seasoned with sazon and tomato sauce. When tasting the meat alone, he felt it was bland. Despite adding some cubed potatoes in the cooking process, I still noted a vinegar taste in both meat and potatoes. The vinegar is not overpowering, but is noticeable enough. As with other reviewers, I recommend doubling the amount of marinade ingredients, except for vinegar (reduce vinegar by ½). When I dumped the contents of the bag into the skillet, there was not enough liquid and in 40 minutes cook time the liquid would have reduced too much and the meat would have been way overcooked. I decided to add extra stock, which is when I also chucked in some cubed potatoes. Otherwise, the only change I made was making sazon instead of using the packets and adding ample amount of salt (I cannot have MSG). Overall, a good dish, which is easy to make and definitely one we will make again! This will go well with white rice or Arroz con Gandules (without the pork or ham). Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Best marinade ever! I made it for my family and we literally scraped the last morsels off the pan. 
I followed the recipe except for the broth. 
Everyone in my family complimented me. And my toddler ate it so easily, which always makes me happy. 
I highly recommend this dish with white rice on the side. We broiled our meat (shoulder clod) at 200 degrees for 1hr and it was extremely tender. 
This will definitely become a family dinner staple.

Very easy and tasty.  I doubled the beef stock as another reviewer suggested (actually, I just used an entire 15 ounce can).  I also added some diced yuca, which went really well with the flavors. Served over mofongo, will definitely be doing this again!.

excellent flavor!  i used cube steak, which i marinated for 1 day before cooking.  the meat was very tender and the fork went right through.  i wish more of the flavor from the broth was in the meat, but it was amazing as is.

I made it as the recipe called and the flavor was a little weak. The little you could taste was good but not strong enough. Maybe if the marinade was doubled as others suggests it would be better.

This dish was very good. I served it with white basmati rice, tostones, and a simple green salad.  I put the ingredients together to marninate in a large plastic container with a lid in the morning and started cooking in midafternoon for an early dinner. I decreased the amount of olive oil to 1/4 C based on personal preference.  I used water because I didn't have any beef broth.  I added a sliced green pepper to the onion mix.  I omitted the sazon seasoning because it contains monosodium glucamate and I try to avoid that.  I also threw in a few olives just for fun.  Since it's just my husband and myself, there are plenty of leftovers.  I'll probably freeze some to enjoy at a later date.

This was pretty good and simple. I didn't measure and just eyeballed everything. I also added all- purpose seasoning, bay leaf, orange bell pepper, and bouillon cube.

Made it last night. I made it exactly like the recipe called for. The steak was very tender, didn't need a fork to cut it. The only thing I will do different next time is add a bit of the brown gravy powered mix that I buy and make the liquid a bit thicker. Otherwise this recipe is a keeper.

Awesome!  Is classic Puerto Rican food and we followed the recipe.  My only device is to make it your own only after you’ve giving the original a try.  It can only get better based on your taste.  Good luck and enjoy!

Absolutely loved it! I used filet mignon and added green bell peppers and red onions. It was a refreshing change. I will make this again. I might try adding little minced tomatoes next time.

3,5 stars. This isn`t a bad recipe, but not a great recipe for us. Maybe I had a strong vinegar but the taste of vinegar was overpowered. The meat had a tangy flavor although it was very moist. Very easy to make too. Probably won`t make again.

I modified the recipe from the onset as I am not a fan of heavy vinegar, so I used 2 tbsp of the white distilled vinegar instead. I only had 1 lb of steak tips to use. I don't have oregano anymore apparently, so I was unable to use that. I added additional chili powder and cumin to taste as the sezon balance was off (flavor wise). I did not marinate the onions (I used yellow); I caramelized them prior to cooking the meat marinade mix. 

It was quite tasty and fairly simple to make.

Very good, I put it all in the slow cooker then put it in the fridge overnight then cooked it on low for about 6 hrs. Topped it off with some cilantro, lime, avocado and some corn tortillas.

The key to this recipe is the 1 cup beef stock- I have made this same recipe before without it.  With it is much better, keeps the steak moist.  I used cube steak.  Next time I will pound the meat because the thicker pieces always come out too dry.

My husband is Puerto Rican and i'm always trying to cook meals that his mother would have made him.  He LOVES this and asks me to make it at least once a week. He says its just like home. I agree with the extra vinegar for the marinade.  I add like enough that it's tangy to the taste and figure the more liquid for simmering the better.  We used beef that had been tenderized by the butcher and it works MUCH better.  Very tender and melts in your mouth!!!!!

Bistec Encelloao Haiku: "5 stars for the ease, but I should've doubled sauce. Broth was the best part." Guess I should've heeded some of the reviews who made more of the marinade than directed. But gosh, this was so easy; throwing it all in a bag the other day, then dumping it in a pot this afternoon, fixing some rice, then blammo! Dinner's ready! We liked the broth the best, which made the rice all flavorful, but the steak just didn't absorb enough of the other goodness. I wouldn't say it was bad by all means, just not as great as I'd have wanted, but again, the simplicity of prep was a definite score.
