these were pretty good.  I made a few substitions based on what I had in the cupboard, first off, I didn't have any matzo meal, so I subbed bread crumbs.  I also didn't have cottage cheese, I did have ricotta (so weird, it's not like ricotta is something I regularly buy) I mixed the ricotta with honey instead of the white sugar and also mixed in a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg.  The only downside is that after being cooked, these have a short shelf life, they turn kinda mushy after a couple of minutes and definitely tasted yeck, when I tried to eat one I'd placed into the fridge for later.  Oh well, it was a simple and easy, last minute treat.  I think they would be even better with some fruit mixed in, maybe a little spoonful of blueberry preserves or even better, fig jam.

Excellent. We use cream cheese (no added ingredients)for the filling. My husband's family has for many years. Memories of Grandma Millie's "Fried Crackers" has been talked about much this summer since she passed away last month. I am going to try the filling in this one though. Sounds yummy!

My grandmother served these with cream cheese. I make them once a month for quick breakfast.
