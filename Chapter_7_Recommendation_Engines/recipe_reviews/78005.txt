Everyone loved this recipe. It was easy and easy to clean up since you only use one dish for everything! The only things I added were, 2 cloves minced garlic to the sweet potatoes, orange zest on top of the salmon, because there really was not much marmalade to spread over that much fish. I also salted the whole dish after it was baked and added lemon on the fish which really made it delicious!

Absolutely fabulous!! My guests almost licked their plates. The presentation was elegant...toasted almonds and italian parsley...and the pan-fried asparagus with parmesan sprinkled on top...almost too pretty to eat!  Ah ah, I said almost!  My guests and I say thank you Jean Carper!

This was very easy & I like the flavors.  I would cut down on either the OJ or the marmalade next time.  A little too sweet for my tastes - though my boyfriend loved it.  I would, instead, add more garlicky, salty seasons to the sweet potatoes.  The salmon turned out beautifully & remember - TOAST the almonds.  I did...and they tasted excellent with the dish.  Toasted almonds have such a fuller flavor.  I will make this again but probably not until the fall, when the colors of this dish really accent the time of year.

I really wanted to love this recipe, but sadly, I thought it was just okay.  Although my husband liked it a lot more than I did, I thought it was a tad bland and suffered from too much orange juice flavor. I guess I am just not ready to give up scalloped meaning it has some naughty dairy product in it!

i was disappointed by this recipe. It doesn't do much for the salmon... the potatoes and the overwhelming orange flavor carry the dish. And I used fresh-caught wild Alaskan red! I think a salmon dish should bring out the flavors, not bury them...

Altogether, I would say this meal was "ok."  If you like salmon, it's hard to go wrong here.  I felt that it was a little bland.  If I were to try this meal again, I would add more ginger and possibly experiment with some other spices.  A big positive is that the meal was simple to prepare, so if you're short on time, this one might be a good pick.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!! It's my new recipe for Salmon.  For a Low-Glycemic Diet you can substitute the Orange marmalade for No Sugar Added Orange marmalade.

I served this to my Dutch husband and stepson, and his new Croatian girlfriend, and everyone liked it quite well, even my husband and me, who don't really care for sweet potatoes!  I followed the guidance of other readers and reduced the orange juice to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup of water to that.  I also reduced the orange marmalade to 1 Tblsp to the sauce and 1 on the salmon.  I added a chopped clove of garlic and used powdered ginger instead of fresh, as I was all out of fresh.  I left the salmon steak in one piece, so it took an extra five minutes to get it cooked all the way through. We served it with a fresh Belgian endive salad (w/ apples, oranges, walnuts, and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing), which was a very good complement to the potatoes.  Overall, a very good recipe that we will enjoy again!

I took the one suggestion of adding garlic; otherwise it was made as suggested.  We loved it!  Our son, who is quite a good cook and loves salmon, had dinner with us and he was a big fan, too.

I didn't make the salmon, I just wanted a sweet potato side dish that wasn't packed with brown sugar and suffocated with marshmallows. They're good as is, but need tweeking. I used about 2 tablespoons oj concentrate, real maple syrup, 3 cloves of garlic, dried ginger, butter, thyme, salt, and black pepper. I may try the salmon later, but will definitely be making these potatoes often. Thank You!

I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I loved, loved, loved this dish.  If you are looking for heavy, cream laden potato with sugary topping, pass on this.  If you are looking for a taste sensation, you will not be disappointed.  This is one terrific recipe.

Delicious!  This recipe has become my favorite salmon recipe.  The only change I made was to add double the ginger and once the veggies were cooked,I placed them on top of the salmon.

Love the potential of the dish yet felt something was missing. I think I would rather just have mashed sweet potatoes on the side instead of trying to replicate the "scalloped" taste.

This came out really, really well for me.  I  will definitely be using this one as a standard salmon recipe.  The potatoes were excellent, too.  I think I used a little more ginger than was called for, because I like it, and it seemed just right to me.

Easy, healthy, delicious, and presented beautifully. I followed the recipe to the letter. It was simple and quick enough to make on a weeknight, but beautiful enough to serve to company. What's not to love? Thanks!

This was fantastic! My husband and I are not big on fish at all, but in trying to spice up our dinner menu I thought I would try this. I added garlic and had to use sage powder. I had to cook the salmon an extra 10 minutes due to the size I bought. Even the kids loved it. I will be maiking this again - it's even guest worthy!

This recipe is good if you're on a diet. Be careful not to put too much ginger because the taste is powerful! 
I would add some heavy cream to give consistency to the dish.

We tried this recipe when we first saw it and it has become a favorite.  We adapted the recipe and used it in our microwave oven and it is just as tasty, although you need to work a bit on getting the heat distributed evenly.  We lost our clipping from USA Weekend and were very disappointed.  Thanks for helping us recapture this excellent dish.

Really liked this, added garlic as previously advised, increased ginger & pepper, substituted canola oil for margarine, reduced orange juice & added 1/2 thinly sliced cabbage.  Lots of changes but still great.  Will make this again.

my family didnt like it. i think they expected a sweet taste when i mentioned there would be sweet potato's in it,. it was very bland.However, it smelled devine and it was fun to make.
