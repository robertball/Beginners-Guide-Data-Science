I watched the video and made this recipe before reading the reviews.  I wouldn't have tried it after reading all the negative comments, but I'm so glad I did.  I made this for company and we all loved it!  I did have to bake longer than 35 mins (probably closer to 50) and the croutons got very crunchy on top but it was fantastic.  My husband took leftovers to work and many colleagues asked for the recipe because it smelled so good! I've very rarely make Chicken Parmesan because of the time it takes to prepare, but this will be one of my regulars.

First, let me say that I followed the directions as written for the most part.  I only had half the amount of mozzarella on hand, I forgot the red pepper flake and I used chicken tenders instead of breasts.  Very, very good recipe.  I only have a couple of suggestions.  First, use chicken tenders, they cook faster and they're easier to portion.  Second, I will grind up the croutons next time and add them on top of the cheese.  I could probably use bread crumbs for that, but I like the buttery taste that the croutons give.  I wasn't missing the red pepper flake that I left out.  I was also perfectly happy with half the amount of mozzarella, and I'm a cheeseaholic.  Also, I used a variety of our store's brand of pasta sauce (because it's really, really good).  Thanks Chef John for a great recipe I will use again!

Yum! With a little tweaking, you can make this super fast and easy without having to thaw your chicken breasts first. What I did was coat the bottom of the pan with sauce, place the frozen chicken on top, then cover with the rest of the sauce and spices. Baked for about 45 minutes, added the cheese/breadcrumbs and let that sit under the broiler to crisp and brown up for a couple minutes, and viola! Perfectly moist, flavorful chicken and no thawing required! Lovely recipe.

I did NOT watch the video for this recipe. This was pretty good--it helped flavor-wise that I made my own chunky vegetable marinara. Four really big chicken breasts were enough for me. We all liked it--the garlic croutons on the top was one of the best parts of the casserole. Next time, I'd cut back on the parmesan cheese by at least half and also season the chicken before I sauteed it. I served this along side fettucini noodles and a big leafy salad. I'd make this again.

This is a definite keeper! WOW! I sprayed my glass 9x13 dish with Pam, trimmed the fat from 6 chicken breats and laid them flat, sprinkled them with garlic powder, red pepper and poultry seasoning.  I covered them with one jar of Prego Light spaghetti sauce and a slice of mozarella cheese over each breast.  Topped that with crushed up garlic croutons and some parmesan cheese.  Cooked it at 350, uncovered for 50 minutes.  DELICIOUS!!

I also found this recipe originally through Pinterest, and made it last week - my picky toddler & preschooler really liked it, as did my pickier husband! It's pretty clear from the recipe that it's not really chicken parm - it isn't breaded for one thing. It's more like a deconstructed version of the dish. We loved the croutons, and would probably add a bit more sauce. I used chicken tenderloins, and ended up using about 1.3 pounds of them. Served with linguine. Really nice and easy dish overall - thanks!

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE,  ONLY I THINK IT JUST NEEDED A COUPLE OF CHANGES.  I BROWNED AND SEASONED THE CHICKEN FIRST, ADDED SAUCE ON BOTTON AND MORE ON TOP, I ALSO COVERED IT AFTER IT HAD BACKED FOR 15 MININTUES,(JUST AS SOMEONE ELSE HAD SUGGESTED), TOOK COVER OFF LAST 5 MINUTES OF BAKING WHICH DID TAKE ABOUT 10 MINUTES LONGER TO BAKE.  IT'S A GOOD REDIPE THAT ONE JUST NEED TO MAKE OVER TO THEIR OWN TASTE.

After reading the reviews, *** I sliced the breasts in half lengthwise so they were thinner.*** They cooked up fine.  I used 3 cloves of garlic, quite a hefty pinch of pepper flakes, and a nice spaghetti sauce that my family likes. It was delicious! It is best straight from the oven so the topping will be crunchy - microwaving leftovers does not work. The crouton topping is very hearty and NOT for weight watchers... a lot of carbs... may try again without the topping to save some carbs and calories. Also, adding all the cheese at the beginning is not what I do - I cook the chicken most of the way through before adding the cheese... otherwise, it turns brown from overcooking. But the dish was tasty, and easy to make.

My family enjoyed this. I used Prego pasta sauce and Italian blend shredded cheese instead of plain mozzarella. I also put a thin layer of sauce and cheese on the bottom before adding the garlic and crushed red pepper. I also covered it about half way through cooking because my croutons got toasted pretty quickly and I didn't want them to get too brown while the chicken was still cooking. We'll make it again.

Yum! My hubs and I thought this was pretty good. While not "traditional," this is perfect for a quick weeknight meal. Having said this, only a few tweaks are required to take this from good to GREAT! Because I had extra time on my hands (and because I viewed John's video FIRST), I browned my chicken in a T of EVOO until browned on both sides. I then poured the pan juices over my chicken as suggested. I used chicken cutlets instead of breasts (I feared they'd cook unevenly otherwise) and this caused my chicken to DRY out! I should have known better.... Thin cutlets cook quickly! I have a few suggestions for those wanting to give John's recipe a try. First, DO NOT pan fry your chicken (as per Chef John's video). This step is totally unnecessary, IMHO. Second, add the basil (if it's in season). It definitely kicks this up a notch. Finally, use smallish sized croutons. I purchased Marzetti brand garlic & onion croutons and although tasty, they were very LARGE. I had a difficult time covering them (with cheese) and the ones that were exposed got a little too brown for my liking. :( I suggest that you semi-crush your croutons to avoid this (and cover your casserole with foil for at least HALF of the time it is in the oven). With these changes, your recipe will become a regular staple at my house. Thaks for sharing, Chef John! :-)

I was really nervous to try this recipe, based on all the negative reviews. I decided to cut the recipe down to 4 servings, just in case it was terrible. Too bad, too, because this recipe is delicious! When I was heating up our leftovers today, my husband exclaimed, "my mouth is watering!" 

NOTE TO GLUTEN-FREE COOKS: I used Glutino brand gluten-free "bread sticks" and crumbled them on top, instead of croutons. I also served it on a bed of quinoa pasta crumbles (because let's face it, quinoa pasta never holds together) with butter, salt and pepper. Turned out great!

I have no idea how much or how little cheese, sauce or basil (dried) I used. I just eyeballed it. I used a bit more garlic than the recipe asked for because my husband and I both love it. Also, I ended up baking it for about 40-45 minutes (and I only used 4 halves). GREAT recipe! We'll definitely be having this again.

I have tweaked this recipe...cut the breasts in half, cover and cook without the croutons and top cheese for 20 mintues, then add croutons and topping cheese and bake another 10 mntues. I make it all the time.

Very easy and tasty! We like garlic so I used four big cloves. I have two little girls so I omitted the hot pepper flakes but I would add them if I were cooking for adults. I also cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. It was quicker and neater to cut them up for kids before they were coated with sauce and they cooked faster. This smelled so good while baking I couldn't wait for it to finish and I wasn't disappointed. No, it is not traditional chicken Parmesan but it doesn't pretend to be that. It is an easy and delicious casserole that I know we'll enjoy again and again. Thanks Chef John.

Unfortunately, I beg to differ.  This is NOT the best parmesan chicken.  I had hopes to make for a large group, but no dice.  Back to the drawing board.

Let me preface this by saying that I did change the method in which this recipe was put together, but did not alter any of the ingredients or quantities. The bad reviews for this made me not want to try it, but I thought I would give it a chance anyway.

It seemed odd to me to layer the bottom of the baking dish with garlic, oil and red pepper flakes so instead I sliced the chicken breast into 1" strips and browned them in the olive oil along with the garlic. I sprayed the baking dish with Pam and then added the chicken/garlic mix and then followed the recipe as written. I also crushed the croutons into pieces slightly larger then crumbs.

The flavor was phenomenal, however, I also used homemade spaghetti meat sauce in place of the marinara, which may have enhanced the flavor as well.

I made this recipe as shown and found it to be a fast and easy fix. This recipe has potential but I would make a few changes the next time I make it. First add some bread crumbs to the bottom of the casserole. It was a little soupy on the bottom so this should soak up liquid better. Second, add 1/2 the marinara over the chicken, add the croutons, then cover with the rest of the sauce and top with cheese. Croutons are already dry and baking them on top with half the cheese made them even harder. Covering with a little sauce and cheese will allow the croutons to soften a little and give it just the right crisp/tender texture you want in a good chicken parmesan.

I don't think I can even give this a star. I found this recipe on Pinterest and it was definitely not even close to the best parmesan chicken bake. My family did not care for this at all and they're not picky eaters nor do they complain when I try something new. I will not be making this again as I can't even begin to think of what it needs to be improved upon.

I almost didn't make this based on other reviews, were my croutons going to be soggy were they going to be like rocks??  They were awesome...exactly as promised...soaked in sauce on the bottom and cheesy crunchy on the top.  Mmmm Mmmmm Good!  I made exactly as stated (watching the video).  I browned the chicken first.  Deglazed the pan with a little white wine and poured it over the chicken.  I'm not really sure what a "good" crouton is.  I usually make my own croutons but I didn't think they would work in this since I usually like them chewy crisp so I bought Rothbury Farm Italian Style croutons and they were fabulous in this dish. Oh, I also used the recipe from this site "The Best Marinara Sauce Yet"  as my marinara sauce.  So glad I did.  I cooked my chicken for 40 minutes and should have stuck with 35 and I will next time. Thank you Chef John for another winner recipe.

This is the first time I have rated a recipe and the best thing I can say is that the chicken came out tender.  Otherwise, it was a waste of time and good ingredients.

I'm rating this 4 stars because I changed some things to make it taste better. I used chicken tenderloins and marinated them in italian dressing overnight. We like alfredo over our chicken instead of marinara sauce especially with it cooked this way. I omited the pepper flakes and used panko italian bread crumbs instead of croutons. I also used a 5 cheese italian blend instead of just mozzarella and parm. This came out great. I also followed other users advise and covered it until the last 5 min. I served this over mostaccioli. My family loved it and my husband said I need to make this a regular meal.

As a novice cook and chicken parm taster, I have to say this was an extremely easy and delicious dish. I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9 and had to add about another 10 minutes to the cooking time. I also forgot the red pepper flakes but no one seemed to notice!

Fresh basil made ALL the difference. I did cut the chicken breasts in half so they would not be so thick. I skipped the first step based on all the reviews and just splashed about 1/2 cu of sauce in the pan and coated the breast halves in it, then proceeded with the recipe except I did not put the (crushed) croutons (butter & garlic flavor) and last layer of cheeses on until I had baked the chicken for 25 min. covered. I added the croutons and cheeses and baked another 10 min. uncovered. Fabulous was the rating by all 6 people. It is a good casserole for hungry people. Oh yeah, I added crushed red pepper flakes before the last layer for 1/2 of the casserole because there are spicy food lovers in my family. No leftovers - darn.

I'm sorry, but neither my husband nor I cared for this.  I watched the video and followed the recipe exactly.  At 350 degrees for 35 minutes, I had almost burned croutons on top and almost raw chicken.  I continued baking it with foil on top for almost an hour longer.  The flavor was so-so and the croutons were hard as a rock on top and mushy on the bottom.

I made this last evening and it was a huge hit!  I followed the recipe exactl, except for using thin sliced chicken breasts and crushing the croutons just a bit before adding to the dish. I didn't turn them into crumbs, just crushed them in half so they were in smaller pieces.  It looked more like a crust and less like a bunch of croutons, but the flavor and texture was amazing!

My family and I loved this.  I liked the bit of spice the red pepper flakes added.  I also really liked the flavor of lots of fresh basil.  I made mine in a 8x8 pan since there are only 3 of us.  I had watched the video a few times so pretty much just followed what he did rather than measuring everything.  This will definitely be made again in our house!

This was very good!  Hubs and I both really enjoyed it.  I deviated just a bit, but not much.  First I pounded my chicken to about 1/2" so it would cook more evenly.  I skipped the oil and sprayed my pan with non-stick cooking spray, then sprinkled in the crushed red pepper flakes.  Rather than put the garlic in the pan, I put it in my sauce, which was a spaghetti sauce.  Topped the chicken with the sauce and sprinkled on the fresh basil and the first layer of both mozzarella (mine was actually a mozzarella/provolone blend) and parmesan cheeses, just eyeballing the amounts of cheeses.  At this point I covered and refrigerated it until dinnertime.   When I was ready to bake this, I uncovered it and topped it with my own homemade croutons and the remaining cheeses.  I baked this for about 40 minutes.  Remember if your croutons begin to brown too quickly, lay a piece of foil over the dish and continue baking.  Not only was this very tasty, but a snap to put together.  We’ll be making this one again!

I have made this twice and other than using chicken breast tenders instead of full breasts, and Ragu spagetti sauce instead of marinara sauce have left the recipe as is.  It was a hit both times and soooo easy.  Tastes like you fuss but you don't.  My family loves it.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I've never had traditional chicken parmesan, so I can't compare this recipe to a traditional one. I really liked this though! So easy to make, throw it in the oven and forget about until it's done baking. I think you could sub cooking spray for the olive oil on the bottom of the casserole dish. I crushed my cheesey garlic croutons and sprinkled them on top. Only had mozz cheese. I would make this again. I used frozen Kroger brand chicken cutlets (they are flattened out for you already)and added 10 minutes to the cooking time since they were still frozen. Perfectly cooked.

Don't be fooled- Think about what you are essentially eating here chicken breast with tomato sauce, cheese and croutons on top.  It was easy to make but so is Mac n Cheese which is much better tasting.

I thought this was excellent! I was a little leery of making it considering it had a lot of negative comments, but I am glad that I did. The only thing I did different was I browned the chicken for just a bit first and then assembled it. I baked it for about 40 minutes and it was wonderful. Yum!!  A keeper!

Delicious and easy! My husband loved it, and he is very picky! I made this with frozen chicken tenderloins (smaller than breasts)  I had to bake it for a little over an hour. I would recommend covering the top with foil to avoid overbrowning of the cheese/crutons, which happened to me. But it was still delicious! I served over angel-hair pasta.  Making the usual parm. chicken is such a hassle, this one tastes just as good!

This is my first time making chicken parmesan.  My changes were: dredge the chicken in egg with a little salt and pepper and coat with finely crumbled Town House Crackers.  I omitted the croutons.  Served with fettuccine noodles and a summer salad.

It was perfect.  My husband is an executive chef by trade - he loved-loved it.  Will definitely make it again.....

Quick and easy substitute for the real thing.  The key for me is the sauce.  Use a sauce that your family enjoys.  Break the croutons into smaller chunks and make sure they are covered well with cheese.

OMG this was sooooo good.  I would highly recommend covering w/foil until say last 5 min.  after 35 min. w/o covering my chicken was still pink on the top.  i covered tightly w/foil for another 20 min. and the chix cooked in the sauce/juices and came out super moist.  You can always hit broil for 5 min to toast the top after it's done.  Thanks for sharing will DEF make again

This was great and... quick!  Not exactly gourmet, but a great substitute for a casual casserole.  Chicken turned out tender and my family all wanted seconds.  I made the recipe as written, but cut the breasts into 1/3 instead of 1/2, as they were rather large.  I will make this again, but next time I will crush the croutons, as they were a bit overwhelming the way they were.  Maybe the croutons I used were larger than the recipe intended.  In any case, I think it would be better with smaller croutons.
Overall, great dish.

Oh my gosh. This is ridiculously good! I ate way more than I should have but we both loved it. Can be made healthier with low fat cheeses. I used an arrabiata sauce so I didn't include the red pepper flakes.

This is the dish I serve when I have company over for supper. Super easy casserole and everyone loves it!
My suggestion would be to use 2 jars of marinara sauce which is about 3 1/2 to 4 cups of marinara and 2 bags of crutons I don't find that one bag is enough! I love to use red pepper flakes but if you have picky eaters beware as it can make the dish very spicy depending on how much you use. I cook in my oven at 350 degrees for at least 50 minutes. I add grated cheese (cheddar or mozzarella) sprinked on top ten minutes before end time. I serve with spaghetti and garlic bread. Thanks for a great recipe Chef John!

This is a good recipe. I used uncooked cubed chicken breasts and crushed the croutons roughly. Probably chicken tenders would work well.  Next time I would cover the dish with foil and cook for 30 mins. before adding the additonal cheese and crushed croutons.  Then uncover and cook another 10 mins.

Great recipe!  I didn't use the red pepper flakes, garlic or basil.    I pounded the chicken to make them similar in thickness.  Next time I might use spaghetti sauce instead of marinara, like others said it was the brand of marinara sauce I used that I wasn't crazy about. For the croutons, I used my favorite brand 'Rothbury Farms garlic cheese croutons' bought at Walmart. I tried crushing the croutons as some suggested, won't do that again, it was too mushy.  Even so, everyone liked it.  It's a keeper!

I have made this recipe many many times!  My whole family loves it :) The only changes I really make are to use chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts; take out the crushed red pepper flakes (my kids don't like spicy anything); and use a dash of dried basil instead of fresh basil when I can't make it to the store.  Very good!  I usually put this over angel hair or spaghetti.

I think if you don't like this dish, you have to blame your brand of marinara. If you have a delicious sauce, you're going to have an easy to fix, one dish baked delicious meal!  So easy & great tasting! Loved it! Thanks for another winner, Chef! I love your recipes - we apparently have the same tastes!

I loved this recipe and will make it again! Here are my changed for next time though. No olive oil in the pan, I had extra Alfredo sauce that I made from scratch so it shouldn't stick. Plus the cheese has oil. I sprinkled broccoli on top and it was awesome! So really my BIGGEST suggestion is to sprinkle broccoli, to your desire, on top of the Alfredo sauce then add your cheese. Give it a try!

This is an interesting and tasty recipe, but certainly not chicken Parmesan as you expect it to be.  I prepared the dish exactly as written, except I salt & peppered both sides of the breasts b/4 putting in the baking dish. I put it in the oven 30 minutes earlier anticipating the extra cooking time so many reviewers said was needed.  As it turned out, the meat was done in 35 minutes as the recipe stated. Perhaps this was because I made sure the chicken was at room temperature before cooking it. If prepared right out of the fridge, cooking time will be significantly longer. At any rate, I will make this again for variety, but if I'm in the mood for chicken Parmesan, I'll stick to my traditional recipe.

I made this twice, both occasion I learned something. First you definitely need to double the marinara sauce. It will not dried out the next day. Second of all, cut the chicken breast to make it thinner in width. Thick chicken breast is not good at all. Or use chicken tenders like one of the reviewers suggested. With the two changes, It will be in your menu every other week.

Cooking time closer to 50 minutes.  I recommend to pound the thick parts of the chicken breast.  It will help to cook the chicken more evenly.  Next time I will use more tomato sauce -- I (and my husband) would have liked more sauce for the pasta.  Excellent flavor.  Easy one dish meal!

I participate in a supper swap and this is EXACTLY what we are looking for!  It is so tasty and tender, yet not hard to make or store.  I big hit with all five families that are part of the supper swap.  The only change I made is I did not do the red pepper flakes, because it made it to spicy for us.  Other than that, it's perfect!

This dish is excellent!  I took the advice of others & browned the chicken in a little olive oil after first seasoning with a little garlic salt & black pepper.  I also crushed the croutons.  My kitchen smelled amazing.  I think the key is using fresh basil, not the dried basil.  It was a big hit with my brother & his family.  Will be making again this week!

The first two times I took this out of the oven, the chicken was still pink.  By the time the chicken cooked, the topping was burned.  The premade garlic croutons made the topping far too salty, and the chicken, while moist, was pretty tasteless.  Next time I'll make real chicken parm, instead of cutting corners.  I'd suggest unseasoned croutons or bread crumbs, and smaller pieces of chicken.  For me, a poor choice of croutons ruined a lot of good cheese.

Wow, this was good!  Plus the assembly and prep were easy and did not take a lot of time.

The only thing I changed was due to not having croutons in the house when I began cooking (oops), and so I substituted panko, and cut in the last bit of fresh basil and garlic.

The cook time was more like 60 minutes because the chicken breasts were reading under temperature.  Next time I'd flatten them.

It was so tasty I wanted to have it again just a few days later, but Christmas came, so I did not.  =)  New Year's week for sure!  By the way, I think having the fresh herb and garlic was the key to the wonderful taste in this recipe!

I was not happy with this recipe. First it took about an hour to cook. Then the croutons made it a soggy mess. I seasoned the chicken quite a bit and it did turn out good, juicy and moist. It wasn't a total loss, but I probably wont make this again.

THIS IS THE BEST!!!  Super easy and the entire family absolutely loved it.  The croutons on top make it very special.  It is a very forgiving recipe.  I used dried basil and jarred spaghetti sauce and it was delish.  Thanks for sharing - it's a keeper!

I was disappointed with how this recipe turned out. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. I just did not like the texture of the top layer, and frankly thought it was extremely too salty. I used the normal brand of spaghetti sauce I usually buy, and bought "premium" croutons. Just not my kind of dish I guess. If I made this again, I would definitely cover with foil for the 1st 30 minutes, and uncover for the remaining time.

This was very good. Made it with chicken tenders as others suggested and used dry basil (1 TBLS) instead of fresh. Baked 30 minutes, then added the 2nd layer of cheeses and croutons. continued baking till cheese was bubbly and croutons slightly browned. Served on top of angle hair pasta. Very yummy, hubby really liked so have put it in my favorite file. Thanks Chef John :)

This was pretty good.  I used "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" for the prepared marinara called for.  I liked the croutons, but I think next time I'd crush them up, as I would've liked more even distribution.

I think if I was going to make this again (which I probably won't) I would crumble the croutons before baking. The chicken itself was fine, but nobody liked the croutons.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  The croutons started turning black after 30 minutes so we covered iit with tin foil.  Bad mistake, all that did was turn them soggy, I would suggest adding them later, because this took close to 50 minutes to cook. Other than that the flavor was very good and very eazy to prepare.

Good. I salted the chicken too much. Didn't have garlic croutons so I had to use Caesar. Didn't see that you were supposed to use all mozz at once so I put the rest on top. Only had shredded parm. Would def make again with a lot less salt, Flavor REALLY did taste like chicken parm. Thanks Chef John

I made this dish today and it was a hit!! Here are some simple things that I did differently: I added a little more garlic at the bottom of the pan, I also added mushrooms on top of the basil.  Also, instead of using one 8 ounce bag of mozzarella I also used an 8 once bag of blended cheese that has shredded Parmesan in it. As stated by another user, I also seasoned my chicken with season salt and I cut the chicken in half to thin it a bit. A simple recipe that was easy to follow. The croutons really made it a hit! Next time I'll add some fresh spinach to the layer.

I love Chef John's recipes! I make his traditional chicken parmesan recipe all the time so I was keen to try this because it looked so easy. 
 
I was so glad I decided to try this recipe on a day that the plumbing in my kitchen went haywire, it was so easy to put together and I dirtied almost no pots and pans in the process.
 
I made a few changes based on the reviews: I used thin sliced breasts and salt and peppered the chicken before I slightly seared them on the stove. I melted a bit of butter and added it to the wine to deglaze the pan and poured it over the chicken before topping it with the sauce. I used Bertolli tomato and basil pasta sauce. I didn't feel like mincing fresh garlic so I used dried minced but I did use the fresh basil. I used some brand of croutons made from Texas toast and tried to break them up into smaller pieces. I added a bit to the bottom of the dish with a few spoon fulls of sauce before adding the chicken. I added some cracked black pepper on top of  the cheese before the croutons went on and I added a bit of olive oil on top of the croutons before the last layer of cheese. I covered and baked for about 30 min then 10 uncovered.

 It came out perfect!! Super tasty and an excellent substitute for traditional chicken parmesan without all the fuss of breading the chicken first.

Thanks Chef John!

I never review the recipes on here, but I do use this site for EVERY meal - I HAD to review this one. This is SO easy to prepare, and so delishious! I used chicken tenderloins, LOTS of fresh pressed garlic, and LOTS of sprinkled red pepper flakes. I also crushed the croutons and sprinkled them on top. Cooked under foil for the first 20 mins, then without foil for 30 min. SO YUMMY!!!!

So Good! My husband declared it a "keeper"! I did add lightly brown onions and chopped red pepper to the olive oil in the bottom of the baking dish. I took another cook's advice and browned the chicken before baking. Those were the only changes I made. This is a wonderful EASY, FAST dish to make. I am looking forward to sharing this with company.

I made this for a Sunday family dinner get-together.  None of the kids liked it (and they all love chicken parmesan), and most of the adults agreed it was OK, but nothing to write home about.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I found there was little marinara sauce and the croutons were mostly mushy. It also took my chicken breasts 1-1/2 hours to get done. I most likely won't make this again.

I couldn't wait to make this recipe after I saw the video.  I was really disappointed with the result.  I thought the crouton idea was "genious," but it really didn't work for me.  Glad others enjoyed it, but I won't make again.  (And I really love Chef John!)

I had high hopes for this, but it just wasn't that good.  Even the cheese was ruined due to the croutons being too big and dry.

Great chicken dish.  I followed the directions pretty closely.  I did brown the chicken breasts, which I cut in two (filet). I used rosemary, garlic olive oil in the bottom of the dish. After placing the chicken, marinara sauce, fresh basil and half the cheeses in the casserole I covered it and baked it for about 40 min. I then uncovered it and added the rest of the cheese and garlic croutons, which I crushed .I turned the broiled for about 5 min and it was done.  I let it set while I prepared buttered rotini and a tossed salad. I put a bowl of extra sauce on the table.  This was enjoyed by everyone.  Thanks for a great receipt.

We really enjoyed this. I made it as is and it was good- my marinara was homemade though. It did brown a little too much because I had to cook for longer- about 50 minutes as well. Chicken was moist and juicy- it was really tasty. 

Next time, I will put the croutons and some cheese over them during the last 5-7 minutes of baking. I will also cover the pan with foil while cooking until the last 5 minutes.

I served this with pasta tossed with Olive Oil and garlic. 

Thanks for sharing!

I halved recipe for 4 adults and 1 child and we had a few bites leftover which I have sent over to brother for further testing ;). Followed recipe for 1/2 recipe, used my favorite marinara sauce recipe and I must say that is recipe is fantastic. Just the right amount of seasonings, moisture, cheese. The smell in the house was mouth watering. We didn't need knives to cut the chicken! Only thing I did different was to crush up some of the bread crumbs, left some whole. Absolutely tasty, everyone was impressed. I made some garlic cheese bread and some sweet peas to finish off meal.

I did not watch the video, but I found the recipe very easy to follow.  I have three little ones and I was able to get this meal in the oven very quickly.  I'm not sure if the video says, but I think the dish would be much better if the croutons were crushed.  I would add a little more sauce if serving over pasta, and I might wait and add the cheese and croutons 10 minutes into the cooking time, so the croutons do not get too brown.  I thought it had a great taste and was very easy to prepare.  Thanks!

My husband who is not very fond of baked chicken loved it.  Easy, delicious recipe.  I especially liked it because the items were readily available in my pantry and frig. Like others, next time, Will add a little sauce to the bottom of the dish.

This is similar to something i already make i just leave the cheese off until the last few minutes to let it melt without turning brown so its more gooey and the chicken is cooked

I adapted this recipe a little so that I could use up some my left over roasted chicken (Indriani’s Simple Whole Roasted Chicken) I shredded the left over chicken and put it in the bottom of the casserole dish, (I didn’t add the chili flakes and garlic here because I added them to my sauce) I used the cheap no-name tomato sauce and heated it on the stovetop adding the garlic, chili peppers, and some pepper, onion salt and Italian seasoning. once the flavors were combined I poured it over the chicken. Then added the 4oz shredded mozzarella, and the 1/4 Parmesan cheese. I then put 5 oz of Italian bread crumbs on top (didn’t have croutons) and followed with the remaining cheese. I served it over rotini. The family LOVED it!!! I know I didn’t follow the recipe too closely but I thought I’d share anyway Incase anyone else was wondering what to do with left over roast chicken :)

I've actually made this twice. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. The flakes of red pepper were way to hot for us! So the next time instead of putting red pepper flakes in the bottom of the dish, I put dried Basil leaves and Soul Seasoning. This was much better, still delicious!

I have the world's most pickiest husband and let me just go straight to the point... he didn't even taste the chicken because he saw croutons on them and immediately said "croutons are for salad. NOT FOR CHICKEN." And that was that. But who cares, I ate the chicken and my my my... DELICIOUS! I will make more and invite my husband's family over so they can all brag about how deliciously this dish is to his face. :)

The chicken parmesan flavor was there with the cheeses, sauce, and basil. My breasts turned out very tender. But the deal breaker for me were the crispy croutons that were soggy on the bottom. I'd figure I'd give this a try and keep an open mind, but it reminded me of eating refrigerated salads with croutons that soaked up all the moisture. -2 stars

I didn't brown the chicken either beforehand.  If I were to make this again, I would do that since mine lacked more flavor then I expected.

This was a success and the kids came back for seconds but if you don't pre-cook the chicken it gives off too much water.  Next time, I think I'll cook the chicken half way, drain the water, and then add the ingredients.  Also, I'm not sure how to make the croutons work out but mine turned soggy and had to be scooped out:(
Also, I used a homemade marinara.  I would imagine that this dish will only be as good as the marinara you use since that's where you get most of the flavor.

Made this for dinner last night, it wasn't bad but it just didn't do it for us.  Guess that's why there are multiple recipes with the same title.  Anyway, we found it bland, needed more spices - salt and pepper at least.  I made the whole recipe so that I could freeze half for another meal.  Not going to eat it again as is.  Will take out the chicken and use it in a salad or for soup.  Kind of expensive to make so I am disappointed that it didn't have the zing we expected.  All in all not bad just not to our liking.  PS I did hold out the croutons and 2nd layer of cheese and put on in the last 10 minutes of baking.  The croutons that did not stay on top got soggy and the others didn't get burned.  Just a suggestion for anyone reading this review before making.

This is wonderful! I work very long hours and I am the one who cooks, so to be able to throw together Chicken Parm in minutes, is amazing! I diced the chicken into cubes and browned in olive oil and galic, instead of using whole breasts, so the chicken will absorb more of my sauce. I make my own marinara sauce in huge batches, so with that, I can throw this together, bake it and serve within 45 minutes, so no one has to wait for weekends for this heavenly dish! The croutons to create the crispy breading, is brilliant!

This was incredibly well received by my four boys and my husband.  I would definitely use a spicy marinara because we like heat and do use GOOD croutons.  (I made these with an over flavored kind and it was not  great)  Also shred your own Mozzarella.  The pre-shredded kind does not melt as well.

Super easy and flavorful!  Modifications for next time:  I used thin-cut chicken breasts, but think it would be better to use thicker breasts cut into chunks as recommended by other reviewers.  In mine, it didn't seem like there was enough chicken to compliment the topping of sauce, cheese and croutons.   The croutons I used were delicious but highly seasoned.  Next time, I think I'll buy a milder/less seasoned crouton. Also, my croutons were the large sized but I pounded the in their bag to break them up.  That worked well.  I served it with steamed broccoli and salad on the side.

So easy and so delicious.  I didn't have croutons so used Italian Panko and sprinkled on top instead of between cheese.  This gave it a nice crunch.  Only took 5 mins prep time and 30 mins to bake.  Added to my favorites!  This is a crowd pleaser.

This was a very good Emergency Dinner.  I had everything on hand.  Son wiped out on skateboard, possible elbow fracture.  Dr. won't have report back until after weekend.  Didn't want to drag said son all over the grocery store with a swollen arm in a sling.  Raided my freezer and pantry.  Followed recipe and noted reviews that said to season and brown the chicken first and crush the croutons.  Best Husband Ever was coming home from a business trip, so I wanted a hot, home cooked meal on the table that was also easy for me.  Everyone loved it.  Used Trader Joe's Tuscan Marinara in the 14oz can which was the perfect amount and for sauce from a can, it rates highly in my book.  Best Husband Ever said I could make this anytime.  And, I like the fact it's not fried.  The cheese did brown quickly on the top, so keep an eye out and tent with foil as soon as it's browned to your liking - I almost overshot the runway on that step.  The crushed red pepper flakes and garlic on the bottom is a brilliant idea - added just the right kick without being too much for my 11 year old.  Not necessarily a dish I would choose for a dinner party, but it's definitely a keeper for a weeknight, quick, yummy dish.  We skipped doing any pasta with it and no one missed it - the crouton topping does that job just fine for us.

Super easy and delicious! Will definitely make again! I basically halved the recipe by using about 1 lb of chicken breast tenders, halving the other ingredients and by baking in a 6 cup Pyrex baking dish.

I followed another's advice and cooked it 50 minutes, adding the croutons and cheese the last 20 minutes.  This is so good.  Just feels like good, comforting 'home cooking' to me.  And Chef John's right - the croutons are what make this dish special!  I know my grown daughters will love the ease and flavor of this dish too.  Thanks

I'm giving this five stars because it is an easy, satisfying dish to make when you are in a big hurry.  It's great when you know ahead that you have little time to prepare dinner!  I needed it to be done in an hour, so I left the chicken breast halves whole along side of the chicken thighs.  I put it in a cold oven, turned it on, and put a sheet of foil across the top to keep the croutons from burning.  When I got home, I removed the foil to let it brown up and it was done!  Perfect for us!  I will make this again sometime.

This was absolutely delicious!  I was very skeptical that a recipe this easy could be this good!  I used and additional cup of cheese for the top and followed the recipe exactly.  The chicken was tender and delicious and I couldn't believe that the croutons didn't dry out terribly, but they didn't...they tasted a lot like the breading on CP!  I just used my favorite spaghetti sauce and it took 45 minutes to bake through.  I will most definitely make this again and again!  Thanks for the quick, easy, and tasty recipe!!

Easy and Yummy! 
The only thing I did different was add approximately 1 more cup of sauce, so that we could serve it over spaghetti noodles.

I left out the crushed red pepper because we don't like it. I made homemade marinara and homemade GARLIC croutons. The chicken cooked an addtl 10 min. and came out very tender. Next time I will use more cheese to cover the croutons and I will undertoast them to keep them from browning as much. Otherwise, this was a wonderful recipe and we will make it again. Thank you, Chef John for all of your great recipes!

I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor is delicious except that it's way too salty and oily. I suggest that you NOT add the olive oil to the dish, and that you NOT add salty croutons if possible. The parm is extremely salty already, as is the prepared marinara sauce from a jar (usually). Maybe homemade croutons are the solution. Other than the oil and saltiness, this is a delicious recipe.

I made the "best marinara sauce" with red wine 3/4 cup, fresh basil & parsley, brown sugared onions, fennel tomatoes and garlic- oregano tomatoes- and followed instructions for the rest. Poured a layer, put pre cooked pasta, poured a layer, put pre cooked chicken, poured a layer, put two cheeses, put pepperoni, put croutons, put cheeses

Alot easier than traditional chicken parmesean.  The croutons and cheese almost made a crust on the top (which was a lot harder than I expected it to be).  There was enough sauce to put on spaghetti noodles as well.  Had good taste and was simple, so Im sure I'll make it again

Made this last night for dinner and it was incredible! It smelled so good while cooking and tasted just as good as it smelled. My husband and boys loved it, as did I. I made my own fettucini florentine to accompany it. This was a very easy and deliciously satisfying meal!

Too much sauce for one, and two, the croutons got a little to crispy, even when I did half covered, and half uncovered. Probably won't make again

For the amount of time and effort, this meal *really* gets the job done.  Chicken Parmesan isn't something I would order dining out so this dish isn't anything unique.  I'm not even a huge fan of "Italian" cuisine.  However, like I said, for the amount of effort it is certainly tasty and gets the job done and in a nutritious way.  So that's why I give it 5 stars.

The tomato sauce I used was flavored with garlic and basil so I was fine using dried basil.  I used a square glass baking dish and used only 4 breasts, perfect size for my family.  It all turned out great.

This is a recipe I will definitely be able to make from memory.  So while I'm at the grocery store fretting about dinner, I can easily remember all the ingredients and whip it up in no time.

This is so easy and delicious, I can't believe it tastes as good as it does.  It is not your typical Chicken Parmesan, however, let me just tell you that this is so tasty you won't care.  Another reviewer is correct in that when you reheat any leftovers, the croutons will not be crunchy, as they have now sat in the sauce, etc. and turned soft, but for me that was ok.  It was still a yummy leftover meal.  I used stuffing since I had no croutons, and they worked just fine. Thanks Chef John!

I thought is was OK, not great. If I have a real taste for Parmesan I'd rather take the few extra steps and make the real deal. It wasn't bad though!

Fabulous recipe!!  Wish I known about this recipe when my kids were little and I had little time to put together a healthy dinner.  I did cut the chicken breasts in half so it would bake faster.  I sprinkled bread crumbs instead of croutons because that's all I had.   My family loves this dish and it will be a regular at our house.  THANKS Chef John for another great dish!!

This was FANTASTIC and will be a weekly staple in my home.  It was SO easy to make and my kids ate it up.  They fought over who got more of the yummy croutons!  I left out the red pepper flakes to make sure it would be kid friendly and used chicken tenderloins.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Delic!  Thank you!

This was very good and so simple to prepare.  Kids loved which is a plus! I pounded my chix breast to approx. 1/2 inch thickness for uniform baking.  I did season the breast with salt and pepper and added a dusting of seasoned breadcrumbs to the tops prior to adding sauce and cheese (only used 1 cup of parm-this was plenty).   I did have to bake approx 50 minutes for the chix to be at correct temp. It was super moist and the croutons are what makes this dish. I will make this often.

I made this for my daughter and I, she's one, and we both enjoyed it immensely. (I took the crunchier pieces off of hers) It was very easy to make, even with a one year old in and out of the kitchen! I didn't have the fresh basil on hand, but it still came out great. I will be making this again.

We made this dish last week using all the same ingredients suggested, only thing we did different was browning the chicken first in a skillet 2-3 minutes per side. It was delicious to say the least. Thanks Chef John. We are making Your extra crisp onion rings tonight to go with our venison burgers!!

I found that the cooking time was shorter than it should have been. Fifty minutes to an hour is more appropriate. Other than that it was tasty after being cooked enough.

Absolutely fantastic! This is such a quick and easy meal to make and can be made ahead and served for company. The only thing i recommend is to pound your chicken cutlets so they are not so thick. My kids and husband love this recipe. I have given this recipe to many friends...everyone agrees...its fantastic!

This recipe is a keeper, it's easy, quick, and taste delicious. Chief Jon says the secret is the crouton but I have to respectfully disagree, the secret is in marinara sauce. The marinara sauce gives this dish it's fabulous flavor.
Next time I prepaid this dish, I will dice and per-cook the chicken before placing it in the casserole dish. That way it will be easier to serve and I'll be certain the chicken is fully cooked.
Thanks Chief Jon for another delicious meal option for me and my family.

It was okay. My husband was not a fan, so I won't be making it again. Way too much cheese, the combo of parmesan and croutons made it too salty.

it was good, and not nearly as much of a mess as the real thing, but for people to say it was the best ever...well maybe they don't get out to really great Italian places much.  Pound out the chicken first and marinate in some italian dressing first as well.  I'll do this the next time.  
Make sure you have a pot of marinara sauce ready to top it with and to pour on the spaghetti to finish things off.

Quick and easy to prepare.  I pounded the chicken and cut it in thirds.  I also lcooked it briefly in a pan with a little oil to brown it slightly before assembling in the baking dish.  As other readers suggested I used small croutons ( fat free Caesar ) and crushed them slightly .  Use fresh basil and your favorite pasta sauce.  Baked for 20 minutes.  Delicious !

I found this dish to be just great!
I make chicken Parmesean normally from scratch and although I still think the from "scratch" recipes will usually always be better this comes 2nd for me. Amazingly fast and easy and the red peppers were not too spicy at all. I fallowed this recipe to a T. and was not disappointed only that there was not much leftovers ;0( Can not wait to try this on company and get there feed back. (I used Prego as my sauce)
Chef John is becoming one of my Favorite chefs. THANK YOU CHEF JOHN!!!!

Because all the reviews expressed oncern over the chicken not having enough time to cook, in the morning I put 6 chicken breasts in the crockpot. I cooked them till tender and then removed them to the fridge in the afternoon. That evening I put the recipe together, taking the cooked tender chicken out of te fridge. I was a little worried the chicken might dry out, but it didn't. It was ver tender, moist, and this recipe was great. The top did start to get too dark and I put tin foil over it. My family loved it. My picky boys had second helpings.

I actually used more garlic and a little more red pepper flakes and still found this recipe to be quite bland.

I don't care for chicken Parm but I loved this! I used the Texas sized croutons and they were too big. I will crush them next time. I will also pound the chicken breast. Super easy! Company worthy!

I gave this recipe a 4, my hubby 3.5, but he doesn't love chicken parm anyhow. I LOVED the texture the croutons gave. they were crispy on the top, soft against the sauce. Yum. I loved this recipe for what it was. and it was super easy! I used newmans own organic marinara sauce, and did everything else according to the recipe. I did salt and pepper the chicken breasts thought. Would definitely make again

I make chicken Parmesan the old fashioned way but didn't feel like mucking about with breading.  I make this with my own home raised chicken,  home made croutons from my home made bread and home made mozzarella cheese made with my goat milk.  It was a stunning dish

So easy to put together and was a hit with the family. We used chicken tenders vs breasts to speed up cooking time. I used more basil than what was called for and might add even more next time. I couldn’t figure out how the red pepper would fit but it totally does. Just a hint of spice really adds a lot. I used Texas toast croutons. Great with pasta for an easy and family friendly meal. Thank you chef John!!!

Yum! I don’t know why this recipe has gotten any negative reviews. I have made it several times now. I do crush up the croutons in a ziplock and use about half the amount of mozzarella, but this is delish! Love it!!

My family loved it.  It was a very simple recipe and had a lot of flavor.  Next time I will cover it with aluminum foil for the first part of cooking .  The cheese was a little overcooked.

Just made this for the first time, I usually make my own chicken parm that takes twice as long after pan frying coated chicken breasts, topping with sliced mozzerella and sliced tomatoes yada yada, but I wanted to make a quicker recipe for my wife. The ONLY deviation I made was I added about 4 oz. of goat cheese with the first layer before the croutons, kept all other cheese amounts the same, came out fantastic. Highly recommend this dish to anyone! (Try with the goat cheese too and maybe add some sun dried tomatoes, you wont be disappointed)

If this guy says make it like this - then make it like this.  I've NEVER had a bad lead from this chef.  If you can't improvise some and adjust it to your liking, then you best get out of the kitchen and stop complaining.  There is nothing that can go wrong with this 5-ingredient recipe.  DUH!

I am always eager to find new one-pan meals and this is a keeper. I am not really a parmesan chicken fan, truth be told, but found this dish to be tasty.  My husband, who IS a chicken parmesan fan, declared it delicious!  I made it as instructed in the recipe.  I used chicken breasts already cut thin as my chicken source.  This made cooking consistent.  if time allows, you could also pound the chicken into consistent thickness. I loved that it had a true homemade taste in a short amount of time!!!

This really surprised us! The croutons truly made it taste like chicken parm. I suspect using good croutons and good sauce has a big impact on that. The one thing we'll change next time is to either cut the chicken in half or pound it. We didn't do that this time and although it all cooked, it was harder to dish out and eat.

Funny my son thought it was lasagna and couldn't figure out why the "noodles" wouldn't cut when it came out of the oven!
Made it just as recipe reads....will butterfly the chicken breasts next time so will be done in 35 min instead of 50.  Very tasty!

I have tried it both ways. With the full breast and a breast cut into pieces. I like the pieces best. Each piece gets coated with flavoring  while I fry them up. I follow the recipe exactly after that. Easy and tasty.

I used the very thin cut chicken breast meat and 35 minutes was perfect timing. I followed the recipe exactly other than adding salt and pepper to chicken and leaving off the mozzarella cheese because I can't eat it due to bariatric surgery. I can't believe how quick and easy this was, and oh so tasty! Definitely a keeper!

This was really easy to make. I suggest using the smaller sized croutons. I used large ones and it made it difficult to cut.

I thought it turned out excellent!!  I did a few changes, since I had only two chicken breasts. I cut them in medialians 3/8" thick, tossed in flour and placed in a 9x9 then sprinkled bread crumbs on top. Then I spread some homemade roasted  marinara sauce on top with the cheeses on the sauce and a final sprinkle of bread crumbs on top.

We really enjoyed this. I used a jarred spicy marinara and used a little more garlic than called for in the recipe. I cut up my chicken into bite sized pieces and browned them before adding them to the casserole dish. It took 35 minutes to cook.  My kids said I should try meatballs in the casserole next time and I could see how that would be good but I would leave the croutons out if I did that. I cooked some whole wheat rotini and topped it with the casserole, with a salad  and garlic toast on the side. Great meal!

The only thing I did different was I used less chicken and I cubed it instead of halves. I also left out the red pepper flakes simply because I didn't have any. All around it was very tasty.

Love this easy "Chicken Parmesan" styled casserole. I've made this exactly according to directions(and it's awesome) and I've also altered it many times. I find now when I make it, I brown the outside of the chicken breasts first in a frying pan in some oil to lower the cooking time in the oven. I also never have fresh basil in the house so I use the dried stuff.  I probably use way more cheese than the recipe calls for and probably double the pasta sauce.  It's super easy to make and the croutons give a good crunch rather than having the breaded coating on the outside. I love serving this over rice as I'm not a huge pasta fan. I wouldn't say it would replace my traditional styled chicken Parmesan recipe but I've definitely made this way more times than the old recipe since it's convenient and tastes great.

I made this pretty much according to the recipe. I had chicken from Sam's Club which are large, so sliced them into 2, lengthwise. I used more cheese, pepper flakes, seasoning, marinara and croutons than called for. It was extremely well received and the family made me promise to make it again soon. I served it with linguine.  Having read about the problem with reheating, I cut the leftovers into chunks, including the cheese and croutons and then mixed it into a box of newly made linguine. I added more marinara so it stayed somewhat wet in the reheating. It was just as good as the original when reheated this way. Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought it was okay, family loved it.  Beats the heck out of frying chicken though.  My compliant is that I didn't like the texture of the chicken, I think it needs to be browned first.  Other than that it's okay.

This recipe is great!  It's delicious and quick and easy to make, perfect for a busy mom like myself.  I made it exactly as is and it took the chicken about 50 mins to cook thoroughly.  The only difference I will make next time is to mix the croutons into the sauce before layering.  I think that will provide the perfect crunch, leaving them on top was a little too dry.  Make this you will love it!!

I made this for the first time tonight... I did as directed, except I only had thighs instead of breats. I did sear the thighs first. Boyfriend and really enjoyed, it will be a regular in our home.

Pretty good.  Next time will cut chicken into cubes (more of a casserole ) cover dish for the first 40 min. and then uncover to brown.  Used jar of Emerill marinara sauce and liked that.  But chicken was tender after cooking for app. 60 min. uncovered to soon (after 30 min.) so croutons were really brown.  Still something different!

I sauteed the chicken in butter and garlic.  Chicken was very moist and tender. I didn't have any bread  
crumbs. I used the bread cubes from a box of Stove Top Stuffing instead. Don't laugh it turn out pretty good .

This recipe was so easy and baked up really delicious. I added fresh basil and that took it off the charts. Even my picky husband loved it.  Hearty and rich and savory. And no heavy breading or frying!

I have made this for guests and my family several times. Everyone loved it, wanted the recipe. It is one of my favorite when I WANT TO HAVE GUESTS FOR SUPPER.
The only thing i did differently was add a little more sauce. My chicken breasts were fairly large and I like to have more sauce to cover the breasts.

This was a super easy and quick meal to put together. I used chicken tenders and Italian bread crumbs instead of croutons. It only took 30 minutes to bake and was perfectly done. We love chicken parm but it's such a time consuming meal to make-and messy. This is a fantastic substitute and was absolutely delicious!

This was easy to throw together and tasty. Based on the reviews I made just a few small changes in the way I combined the ingredients. 

I cut the chicken breasts in half and browned them with the garlic, basil and some dried minced onion. I put a layer of sauce on the bottom of the baking dish before adding the chicken as well. I deglazed the pan with a jar of marinara before topping the chicken. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Only other change was that I "semi" crushed the croutons, which I would definitely recommend, but that could just be a matter of personal taste :)

I will make this again!

Excellent, easy meal that feeds the family! Some things I did differently was tenderize the chicken (flattened it) so that it cooked more evenly and quickly. I did fry the breasts before putting them in the casserole dish. I did not add any red pepper flakes as the recipe calls for, as my kids don't enjoy spice. I sprinkled on Club House "Italiano" seasoning lightly to give some extra flavor. My kids don't like croutons, so next time I will try some panko bread crumbs on theirs, but I used garlic and butter flavor ones on mine and it just tasted delish! Also very easy recipe for the kids to help make in the kitchen :)

I made this recipe as is. We loved it. This will definitely go on the monthly meal plan. Only minor thing I did is I made my garlic crutons instead of buying store bought just because it's not to hard to make them. :)

It was okay, someone pointed out to watch the video, it suggests browning with a little seasoning first, I'll have to try that again.

Perhaps a different sauce would help, but I also plan (if I make this again), to cut some slits into the chicken so that the flavors get into the chicken.  Made per directions, all the flavor is on top and when you near the bottom of the breast, its just chicken flavor.

I first made this recipe a few months ago while I had gestational diabetes during my pregnancy. Not only did it keep my glucose levels within the normal range but it was also tasty and easy to make. I have since made this dish several times with consistent results. I usually bake for an hour: 30 minutes covered, then 30 uncovered. I've even made it with eggplant - just sliced and layered. It also freezes well. Love this recipe!

I diced the chicken breast because I was taking the dish to a work potluck and figured it would be easier for anyone who wanted a smaller portion. Everyone loved it.

I liked it. It was super easy and the red pepper flakes gave it a great flavor.  My son is super picky and he ate more than I thought he would. I'm not an experienced cook so I followed the recipe exact except for I added extra garlic and red pepper. That part came out well. I felt it was too much marinara sauce. If I make it again I would definitely use a bit less and I think a different style bread instead of croutons. Over all pretty good

I made this, and my family loved it. I made it the night before, but waited to add the croutons so they would not get soggy. My husband added the croutons and baked it covered with foil. He did bake it closer to an hour. I came home from work as my son was going in the house, and I could smell it from the driveway. It was amazing.

I made this almost exactly like the recipe says, I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin on top of the chicken with salt and pepper and I probably overdosed on the cheeses but this was delicious and easy and it'll be added to my list of favorites for sure.  I cooked it for approximately 45 minutes and only used 4 breasts.

Very, very bland and tasteless. IF I were to make this again, I would try cutting the chicken into bite-sized pieces before baking. Otherwise the chicken is pretty uninteresting.

It was very nice and simple. Once you have the chicken cut the way you want it, the steps after are pretty much layering. I cut the chicken breasts into four, cutting it in half so that  looking from the top, the breasts still look whole but are actually thinner, then down the middle so they are like thin patties. I also crushed the croutons and only added them after the chicken had cooked for ten minutes. Everyone liked it!

Had high hopes for this.  Absolutely love Chef John and usually love all of his recipes.  Followed all suggestion, browning, quality ingredients, etc. but the dish was bland.  I even added crushed Aleppo peppers to the sauce but it wasn't enough to save this dish.  I'm not sure what the purpose of adding the garlic and pepper under the chicken but I wanted to follow the recipe so I did it the way it was shown.  I would not suggest seasoning this way to anyone trying the dish.  Season the chicken, not the baking dish.  Probably would have been better if I had cut the chicken up to spread the flavor of the sauce.  Too many other great recipes to choose from, won't be making this one again.

I loved this recipe. I used garlic and cheese croutons instead of garlic croutons and it was amazing. I didn't measure the cheese because I feel you can never have too much cheese. Everyone in my home loved this and I will continue to keep making this. YUMMY!!!

This was delicious!! I sautéed some mushrooms in olive oil, butter, 3 garlic cloves, and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. I removed those from the pan and used the same pan to brown the chicken tenders. I used some pasta sauce on the bottom of the pan rather than the olive oil. It turned out really well, and the chicken tenders cooked within 30-40 minutes at 375. If you plan to eat this with pasta, plan on having an addition jar of sauce on the side.

This was easy and quite good. I took the suggestions from the video and seared the chicken before placing it in the baking pan. I used almost the amount of cheese recommended in the recipe and did everything else as per the recipe. Yum!

Love, love, love this recipe.  I make it at least twice a month. I make my own sauce, (Best Marinara from AR) and spoon a little in the bottom of the pan with the olive oil, garlic and red pepper.  I follow the recipe for the rest. Yummy!... and the leftovers are freezable so there is enough for a later date when I don't have time to cook.

Wonderful! This turned out delicious.  I was a little worried about the croutons but they really made the dish.  Some were soft and others were crunchy.  Just very good.  I like the added red pepper flakes, I used the hot and it really gave the sauce a bit of a boost.  Overall, this recipe is outstanding and it is going to be made again and again.

I made this tonight. Cut the recipe in half because there's only 2 of us. It was wonderful other than I goofed on the Basil, I measured it out like the recipe said then remembered while I was putting the Cheese on it should have been half. Turned out delicious anyway. Thanks for this one, will be keeping this for our regular menu...??????

We loved this dish. I used chicken tenders and added fresh spinach and sliced mushrooms. For the croutons I used crumbled up Parmesan crackers. Served with a green salad, it was a hit!

I used chicken thighs at my husbands request and the take too long to cook so the cheese got overlooked on top.  I want to try again with chicken breast as the recipe calls for.  It was real yummy anyway

I had the ingredients in the house and needed to cook up a large pack of chicken breasts. This was so easy, so rich and delicious & so impressive looking. I served each person a half breast on top of some lightly buttered thin spaghetti. Delicious and easy. This is going into the favorite recipe book for good!

I made this dish yesterday, and it came out very tasty with few modifications.  Here's what I did differently:  1) used chicken thighs which I seasoned and sautéed before continuing with the rest of the recipe. 2) baked for 20 minutes covered with foil, another 15 minutes uncovered.  In the future, I will use smaller croutons or partially crumble the croutons.  It tasted great, but the croutons were large and clunky and didn't look as pretty on the eyes.  See my photo.  I wouldn't swap the croutons out for breadcrumbs though because the garlic croutons were perfectly garlicky and buttery.

Delicious. Easy. Family loves it. Have made twice.
Second time, I added pepperoni slices to top of chicken before the marinara sauce. Loved the  extra flavor.

This dish completely filled my 9 x 13 inch casserole.
Topping the dish with the remaining mozzarella and parmesan cheese caused too much browning prior to being entirely cooked.  I noticed that there are no instructions regarding covering while cooking so I took it upon myself to place a sheet of tin foil over the top for the last 10  minutes or so of cooking.  Also I may reduce the amount of red pepper flakes as children like this dish.  I'll make this again.

Made it just as posted. I may add mushrooms next time. But whether I do or not it was truly excellent just as it is. I used Barila marinara which I've never had before & I feel like that really made it. Really easy too & betting it will be even better as leftovers.

It was pretty easy but needs lots more seasoning, it was bland when made as the recipe states. Also I would recommend bumping up the cooking temp to 375 and covering for the first or second half of the cooking time so the top doesn't burn.

Rating the recipe as-is, the chicken lacks flavor and some of the croutons get mushy. I should have known better than to try to cut corners on a chicken parm recipe.

Excellent recipe!  My son-in-law had two helpings!  I increased the serving size to 3.5# chicken and used a 24 oz jar marinara (Paul Newman's).  I increased the cheeses & basil accordingly.  My only advice is to use caution using the crushed red pepper.  A little bit goes a long way.  The trick to this recipe is to not overcook.  My dish was in the oven for only 35 minutes.

I was worried making this after some reviews I read, but let me tell you. not only did my house smell wonderful (thanks mainly to the basil) but this tasted wonderful ! I never really measure anything, and I used chicken tenders (personal preference) instead of breasts. I partially crushed up the croutons because I couldn't figure out how good that would be, but it was wonderful and my whole house was raving about it! I will definitely make this again !

I made it exactly according to directions, including searing the chicken first as suggested in the video.  It was easy to make and delicious, although too much crushed red pepper for me.  The reason I gave it 3 stars is A) because it was a LOT of cheese and bread product relative to the amount of chicken, so not as healthy as I'd like, and B) the croutons in the  leftovers got soggy, so not so good.  I will make it again, but next time I will make only 2 portions for my husband and me, and I'll reduce the amount of cheese and croutons.

I thought it was quite good the only thing I would do next time is instead of using a full chicken breast is to cut up the chicken into small pieces so you could scoop it more easily and not have a full chicken breast. I also think it's better for kids that way

I think this recipe would be better if the chicken was rolled in crushed seasoned croutons or seasoned bread crumbs, then placed in the pan as described without putting whole crotons anywhere in it.  Maybe even better still if the coated chicken was baked a little bit in a some oil or butter for a few minutes on each side to crisp it up, then add the other ingredients and continue baking for up to an hour total.

I made this without watching the video, and this might be my favorite dish. I kept in the oven for 40min to ensure that the chicken would be fully cooked and to make it a little extra crispy and it turned out amazing

Entire family loved this, including our 3 and 7 year olds, who are typically pretty picky eaters. It is so easy to make and we all thought it was delicious. The only thing we weren't fond of were the croutons. They quickly became soggy so I've since skipped them.

This was really good. Kids and husband really, really liked it. Served it over garlic mashed cauliflower and potatoes. No fault of the recipe, it turned out a bit over salted--I seasoned and salted everything per our usual preferences, but never stopped to consider how salty croutons tend to be. Overall, good mom moment!!

It was very good but 45 min in the oven dried out my cheese and made most of the croutons too crunchy to eat. If I make it again I will Precook the chicken before combining so it only needs 20-25 mins in the oven. I think this will be just enough to soften the croutons and melt the cheese. I will also cube it to ensure more surface of the chicken is coated with sauce and cheese, especially if using large breasts.

I did not alter the recipe, but I did slice the chicken breasts in half for shorter baking time. Baked for 35 minutes and it was fabulous. Served over buttered fettuccine with a side salad.  The croutons really make this recipe. Thanks Chef John!!

First time I made this recipe exactly as described, but found it did need just a lil tweaking to our likings...  First thing I did was brown the chicken in some olive oil & garlic b4 I put in the 9x13" greased tin foil lined pan.   Then I put  bout 1/2 cup of sauce in bottom of pan as described w/red pepper flakes, garlic salt & some Italian seasoning... I sprinkled cut up chicken (in about 5" chunks) over that, then poured the rest of the bottled Bertolli pasta sauce,  sprinkled bout 1Tbs. of  Basil (we luv the taste of basil!), 1/2 tsp of garlic powder & 1cup of  lil bit crushed up  Panko bread crumbs.  Then..added .the 2 cheeses... I bake it  covered w/foil for about 45min.   Then, took foil off & let it brown about 3 min under the broiler.  Very good flavor throughout the chicken & moist & tender.  Everyone really liked it.... A LOT!!!

This recipe was so so so good!  It has amazing flavor with an easy to follow recipe. The only thing I did differently was to use sliced mozzarella.  The crouton thing was awesome!!!!

This was a very nice way to do chicken parm , with the twist of bread cubes. I forgot the bag of croutons at the grocery store checkout so.... I improvised with Italian garlic bread that I had frozen ,so I toasted it and then cut into cubes,I also pounded out the chicken breast so they would cook more evenly in the time frame.of thirty five to fourth five minutes. Thanks Chef John for an easier way to do a family fav.

Made the recipe as instructed, and even followed the suggestion to brown the chicken slightly in a skillet first.  I would give it full marks for ease of preparation and the flavour is great, but I found it took much longer to cook than indicated.  Perhaps my chicken breasts were much larger although I'm not certain that this was the case.  In any event, highly recommended!  This was also great as leftovers.

The easiest and quickest dinner to  make.  I've set it up in the pan and left in the frig so my son can put it in the oven before I get home for work.  The only thing I did is left off the   bread crumbs.  We prefer to eat it with garlic bread instead.

This is a great meal that can be prepared very quickly. We had nothing planned for dinner with our crazy schedules and pretty much had all ingredients on hand except for croutons. Everyone enjoyed. We'll be making it again for sure.

Other than it needing more garlic and to use Romano instead of Parmesan this is a teriffic and extremely easy dish to make. Just remember to use a meat thermometer since different chicken breasts have different thicknesses and you may have to bake it longer.

I made this last night and it was the easiest recipe for chicken parmesan I ever made. I decided last minute to make this and needed a speedy method. I checked my file and came up with thiis one. I didn't read the reviews or I would not have tried it. I'm glad I did because my husband loved it and it was  fast, easy and good

I'm usually a pretty big fan of any recipe I've ever tried by Chef John but I have to say, this is not my favorite and I probably won't repeat it.  I didn't much care for the croutons at all. They started out crispy but pretty soon they turned to mush.  Maybe it was the store bought marinara sauce that overpowered everything else but whatever the reason, I just was not thrilled with this chicken casserole.  It was really easy to put together so for that reason, I'll give it 3 stars.

This is delicious and quick.  The only change I made was to eliminate the red pepper flakes (we really don't like those!), and cut the recipe in half (there are only two of us. I sautéed the chicken as directed in the video, which really gave the dish a nice flavor, and work the extra few minutes.  I can see adding mushrooms and/or green pepper to this as well.  I served it over vermicelli and that was just enough pasta to soak up the extra sauce.  Will definitely make again.

My whole family loves this recipe.  My husband asks for it every weekend and it's about one of the only meals I can get my picky 2 year old to eat.  I've made it with whole croutons, but we prefer crushing them before topping the chicken.  I've also found that with the right sauce there's no need for the extra seasonings.  Truly an easy and delicious recipe!

Awesome!!  My husband and I loved it!!  Recipe is great as is!!  Only thing I did was use tenders instead of breasts as they cook more evenly and stay more tender in the oven in my opinion.

Delicious!  Watch Chef John's video for helpful tips.  My only problem is the sauce/cheese/crouton topping falls off in a big chunk when you try to cut into it, but just cut it up on the side and portion it off with bites of chicken.  Maybe it would work better if you chopped up the chicken and made it casserole style (adjusting the cook time).  So good!  I used Barilla tomato and basil pasta sauce and served it with some bowtie pasta and extra sauce.  This one's a keeper!

Not my favorite chicken casserole. The chicken was bland. Perhaps seasoning or browning it would help. The mozzarella got too hard and crusty on top, not oozy through the chicken as I had hoped. The sauce became very watery which made the croutons mushy. Love the concept, but the execution didn't stand up.

This was a big "fail".  The croutons sucked all the flavor and moisture out of the cheese, so there was a big glued together crust of dry cheese and bread on top. It turned out to be a lot of work for very little satisfaction.  Also, cutting the chicking into 2" cubes would have allowed the meat to absorb the marinara.  Next time, I'll skip the croutons and put the parmesan UNDER the mozzarella - if there is a "next time".

This was awesome served over linguine.  I did add fresh parsley and extra sauce on top of the croutons so they absorbed it and didn't dry out.  The crouton topping is the best part! I also butterflied the chicken breasts into cutlets first. Using a chunky sauce is a must in my mind. I forgot the garlic so sprinkled garlic powder on top after everything else and it came out great. Will be making this again!

This was a very good recipe even though all I had were the large Texas Toast croutons so the top wasn't completely covered.  Will have the correct size next time.  Definitely worth taking a few minutes to sear the chicken first.  Depending on who I am cooking for I might sprinkle crushed red pepper across the top of the casserole too.

Made this tonight, with Classico marinara.  Also, I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing first to give it a little extra taste.  Turned out pretty good though a little salty for my taste, but not sure what part of the dish was at fault for that.  Maybe plain croutons next time.  Also, even though I cut the huge pieces of breast in half at a slant it still took a good bit longer than 35 minutes to cook through.  Served it over penne pasta.

This is delicious.The only changes I made was using homemade marinara sauce, homemade garlic croutons from lo cal bread and part skim mozzarella to save on some calories and carbs.I will make this again.Thanks Chef John.

This is my new go to chicken parmesean recipe. It's so easy to put togther. I love the garlic flavor that came throughout the chicken. Such a smart tip putting the oil and garlic on the bottom of the dish.  I didn't bother with exact measurements and I was out of basil so I used italian seasoning and it was still good and not a bit dry.  I also love that it's not breaded and fried.

I made this for supper tonight and loved it! So easy to put together...throw it in the oven and forget about it! I made a few changes so I wouldn't have to make a trip to the store. I used Kraft 4 Cheese Italian Blend shredded cheese...and since it had parmesan in it I omitted the parm. Next time I'm going to use a few boneless skinless thighs too, since that's what I prefer. This recipe is a keeper!

Sauce became way too watery. I used chichen tenders that I marinated in italian dressing. I should have lightly brouwn the tenders first because the jucies from them turnd the entire dish into a mushy mess. I ate it but salvaged the chicken tenders to use later and threw out the rest. Will NOT make this again. Real chicken parmesan for me next time.

Used 4 tsp dry basil (didn't  have fresh)
Used classico roasted garlic and onion sauce
used Italian seasoned bread crumb (didn't have croutons)
used kraft grated parmesan (yes I know.. didn't have fresh parm)

With all these substitution, it still tasted great!  I can only imagine how much better it would tasted if I used fresh ingredients listed.

One thing though is I would pound the chicken next time to flatten it out more so that there's more surface for the nice tasty crust that forms on top!

Very tasty and good. Easy too. I used frozen chicken tenderloins so had to bake it longer than time stated. I also sprinkled a little salt and pepper on the chicken too before topping with sauce and cheeses. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was delicious, and a smashing hit with the family. I used Wildtree's Garlic Grapeseed Oil both in the skillet to brown my chicken, and in the bottom of the casserole dish. I also deglazed (sp?) the pan as Chef John's video suggested. I highly recommend that step! It did take longer to cook than I expected, and I did cover it about halfway through with foil so that my croutons and cheese wouldn't get too crisp, but I had a couple thicker cuts of chicken that I didn't sear for long enough in the skillet, so I know what to change next time to make it a bit faster. I served it over linguine tossed in the homemade Alfredo sauce that we always make at home (a household favorite). I will definitely make this recipe again and again. You rock, Chef John! My husband and I are big fans! :)

This is great!  While it's not the best chicken Parmesan, it is the best chicken Parmesan BAKE that I have ever had.   I went into this knowing it wasn't going to taste exactly like chicken Parmesan, it's suppose to be a quick, easy, and better for you substitute.  It really is good, the kids devoured it.

Very easy and quick for a week night meal.  Use more sauce there is no harm doing that only more yummy topping for the pasta of your choice. I crushed up the croutons and made sure they had plenty of cheese on top.  (The first time I made it the croutons were exposed and baked to the point of not being able to bite into them, everyone had to leave them on the side of their plate.) Brought this to a neighbor and they absolutely loved it, Wanted the recipe the next day!

I made this last night as a last minute put-it-together kind of meal. My 9 year old had her very Italian BFF over for dinner so I was a little nervous because that age can be brutally honest. She came into the kitchen and said "It smells like my Nona's (grandmother's) in here." After one bite she smiled and said "Are you sure that you're not Italian?" SUCCESS! I served with a side of penne and a green salad and everyone (including my hubby) went back for seconds. I followed the video by browning the chicken and adding the juices from deglazing the pan. I sprinkled the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder prior to browning. I did not have any homemade sauce on hand so I used my go-to Rao's bottled marinara. I used butter and garlic flavored croutons and shredded mozzerella and a shredded 6 cheese Italian blend. After dinner my daughter told me to add this recipe to the "make it again" list.

This recipe was okay. I found the chicken was not very tender, and the way it is arranged on the garlic gave it kind of a strange flavor. If you try this I would recommend thighs not breasts.

I think I will use chicken tenderloins next time. I used really big pieces of chicken and it took too long to cook. I will also cover it at first then let the topping get toasted because mine got cemented with the cheese and too brown. Over all it is a fabulous recipe with great sauce and the fresh basil made it wonderful.

It's really yummy and really easy. I honestly don't understand any negative reviews. I will say this. The chicken did take a bit longer to cook. At a certain point I decided to throw a bit of tin foil over the top to prevent excessive browning. I recommend checking the internal temp for doneness. If you use a good sauce you wont be disappointed.

While this was super easy to put together, the croutons and cheese got way too dark even though I followed the baking directions. It also was a little dry and I used 28oz of marinara sauce. But with those exceptions it was tasty and I will definitely try it again and maybe do a few tweaks (i.e. cover with foil until last 15 minutes, then brown croutons and melt cheese) to see if I can get better results.

Oh my word! This was awesome. We love some Parmesan chicken around my house and this is a nice substitute. No it's not just like it but its close and a lot less fattening. Come on people! We can't eat fried food every day! This is a delicious meal!

Pretty good but be careful not to use thick, huge chicken breasts because by the time the chicken isn't pink, the topping is starting to burn!

I thought it was great. I made my own meatless marinara sauce and I think that would have made the difference. I had my son and his wife over and they loved it as well. Everyone agreed that this recipe has "repeat" written all over it.

This was ok.  I took the advice of some of the reviews, and crushed some of the croutons then poured additional sauce over the croutons -- It gave it a bit of a soggy texture.  The taste, however, was very nice.

I made this recipe for company and it was a great hit. My picky 3 year old even liked it. I did it exactly like the video said. the only change I made was cutting the breasts in half. Oh and I had to cover it with foil toward the end because the cheese was getting a little burnt. Something I will change for next time would be to add more sauce, Maybe four cups. I will definitely make this again.

I used 4 chicken breasts and cut them in half because they were big. I put it together exactly like the video showed. It didn't even take 15 minutes to prepare...did it between school & racing my kid to basketball practice. Left it in the oven to start cooking at the end of practice. When I returned from practice, I got nervous because of some of the reviews and decided to cover it for about 15 minutes in the middle of baking...that was unnecessary and I won't do that again. It was done in 35 minutes. I invited my husband and a friend to eat this CASSEROLE and they loved it. If I had told them I had made them Chicken Parmesan, they might have been disappointed...but they loved Chicken Parmesan CASSEROLE. Will definitely be making this again.

This is an interesting substitute for chicken parmesan.  It tasted really good, though the croutons seemed to be alternately soggy or way too hard.  My husband LOVED it.  I will definitely make this again!

Have made this many times. So tasty and simple. Only variation is I give the chicken a "tan" before baking.

Fast, easy and good.  This is not gourmet but it is a GREAT weeknight meal when you need to feed everyone quickly.  Breadcrumbs work as well as croutons. I often use cubed chicken which shortens the cooking time drastically.

I used chicken tenders instead.  Flavor was good.  However, some of the croutons were still too crunchy.  Next time, I will make sure they are submerged with liquid.  Very easy to make for a busy week night.

Execellent. I made this recipe almost exact at it was super easy and came out excellent. I was worried due to the bad reviews but trust me and ignore them. My changes. Basil olive oil instead of regular, and a thinker than marinara sauce, and I covered with foil for most of the time so I didn't burn the croutons. Oh and I crushed them up a little. When I make it again I will make it exactly the same. It is four stars solid for taste and gets 5 since it is sooo easy to make. Served with a little whole wheat thin spaghetti. Just try it. And others please quit whining that it isn't exactly like Chicken Parm, it tastes pretty much like it and is much much easier.

This was exceptional. I would cut the breasts in half thickness wise or pound it out next time but otherwise excelent. The marinara sauce is important. I used a cabarnet one, yum!

I made this according to the directions with maybe a bit extra garlic. I also used pepper and poultry seasoning on the chicken after placing it in the baking dish. As I had really large breasts, six filled a 13x17, I cooked for 90 minutes, covered for the first 45. This was very different and exceptionally good. Perfect for company. Served with corn and parmesan potato wedges. This will be made many more times! Thanks!

Tried this last night and it was a big hit.  It was super easy to make, and the croutons gave it a nice crunch.  A much healthier version of chicken parm!

My whole family loved this one and it was super simple to make!  I made almost exactly as written.  I pounded the chicken breasts out to be pretty flat so they would cook evenly. I used garlic butter croutons and poured a little sauce and cheese over them so they wouldn't get too crunchy, as others have said. I made some pasta as a side and poured the extra sauce over them.  This will be a regular in my house. This will be especially nice to make during the busy week-nights as it is quick to throw together.  Thanks for the recipe!

it tasted great! i was a little frustrated because i had to put it back in the oven 3 times before the chicken cooked, i was also worried because the croutons and cheese were turning brown but it was suprisingly a success. i will definitly make it again it was so easy to put together too! my suggestions, maybe brown the chicken prior to putting it in the dish or use smaller peices of chicken.

Loved it for how stupid simple it was with all ingredients I always have on hand.  I had the larger frozen chicken breasts but did cut them in half and they baked in about 35-40 minutes.  I think this is one of those recipes that is going to be as good as your ingredients so having a sauce you like is key.  I also used the whole jar of sauce since I was serving it with spaghetti.  Kids cleaned their plates and that's worth 5 stars in itself!!

This was so quick and easy to put together.  I did as suggested by other reviewers and cut the chicken up into pieces to speed the cooking time, but it still needed a longer cook time than 35 minutes and mine leaned more toward the hour.  It was wonderful.

It was wonderful. I didn't have any marinara sauce so I used spaghetti sauce instead. I added minced garlic and onion in a 2:1 ratio. This gave a wonderful flavor.

I made this recipe a little healthier by skipping the croutons.  I also cut the cheese and just eyeballed how much I thought would be good.  The whole family loved it!  I did use the chicken breast tenders and it took about 35-40 minutes.  Thanks!

Followed the recipe after adjusting it for 4 servings. (We used two large chicken breasts and sliced them in half.) This tastes absolutely delicious, and the croutons add a nice crunch and taste to the chicken. My husband LOVED this meat dish -- definitely making it again!

This was easy to throw together and delicious.  I didn't use the pepper flakes (don't like) or the basil (didn't have) and I messed up the order of the cheese and sauce layers, but this recipe is pretty much goof proof and very forgiving. Forget the marinara and just use whatever favorite flavor of sauce in a jar you have on hand. Adjust your cooking time to the size of your chicken breasts, and if you cook too long, the croutons just get more crunchy. Don't expect "gourmet", just tasty, fast, and only one dirty dish.

Quick and Easy to prepare. Great flavour I cooked for 50mins used 4 thick large breasts flavour even better reheated next day. Ideal to make in advance for guests. Will be using this recipe often. Cheers

My family loves Chicken Parm. I hate the time, the mess and the frying for hours, so I had to try this. My husband made a face when I told him LOL - but I made it anyway and last night my hubby and two boys loved it! I loved it - it was easy, it was healthier and I didn't have to cook for hours.  I watched the  video first and went from there. It honestly tasted just like the Fried, breaded chicken parm - Try it We loved it!

This was the easiest recipe I've ever made and my family simply LOVED it!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. (Except I pounded the larger breasts down before putting in pan) This will become a regular in my household for sure.  I didn't think 35 minutes would be long enough, but it turned out very crunchy on top and so moist and tender below.  Just perfect! 

Thanks Chef John for the video on preparing this dish.  That's what hooked me in the first place.

I can't wait to make this!  :)  
For those of you who had problems with the croutons, try crushing them and sprinkling them on top.  Or use Panko.  Also, try adding this closer to finishing time.  It should work wonders!  Bon appetit!  ;)

*5 stars given due to my excitement level.  I will adjust rating, if needed, after I prepare this dish.  :)

My family really loved this recipe.. I'm always trying to find new interesting ways to cook chicken.. I prepared the recipe exactly like the video.. I had really large chicken breasts so I cut them in half..  Besides tasting great it was so easy to make. Everyone loved the croutons too...

The chicken was good. I think the reason I only give it 4 stars is due to my own personal dislike for soggy texture in what I'm eating. I kind of knew that was pretty likely going into making it. The croutons get soggy from the sauce but everything else about it I liked.

This is a really simple recipe. I have made it countless times.  I try adding different flavored marinara sauces or cheese.  Everyone seems to like it.

This dish was delicious.  I used Trader Joe's marinara sauce and put some at the bottom of the dish.  I also added extra red peppers (because we like spicy) and an extra clove of garlic.  I love the flavors.  Will definitely make again.

Tired this for the first time tonight!  My husband and son whom hate chicken actually rated it at a 7 & 5 and said we can have again!  So I believe it was a success!  Just a few minor changes needed.  Use Chicken tenders instead of breast!

I've made this dish several times, my boyfriend loves it! I made it using the costco crutons which were a little large so some were half crispy half soggy, but still delicious. The next time I made it I crushed them up a little and it was amazing.Very good, will be making this again and again

I followed this recipe just as written and I found the chicken to be too bland. It was tender, but didn't have much flavor. I'd season it with salt and pepper first. The croutons get really soggy in spots and it's really an off putting texture for me. My husband really love the dish though, so I will keep making it. I use thin sliced chicken breasts. They cook faster and it's a more appropriate serving size than an entire whole breast.

I made this, minus the croutons. as I am low carb person. It was really good.  Might have had more crunch if I had used croutons.

This really is delicious!  I have made it a few times and it is always a hit.  If I happen to have any leftovers it is fantastic to make a panini with it.  Just slice the chicken breast in 1/2 length wise so they are a bit thinner.  Then place on sliced sourdough or bread of your choice.  Add some of the sauce and extra cheese :) cook and then viola!  Dinner is served.

Not only is this an easy recipe to make, it is DELICIOUS!  My husband loved the topping so much he ate the leftover cheese sauce and crouton topping.  The only change I made was to add more sauce since I made rigante as the side.  It did not look like the picture because the cheese and croutons baked together more.

This was good.  Very nice flavors, and easy to adapt the quantity of breasts or size of pan if you simply keep the ingredients and layers in place and adjust using common sense.
I do however agree with the comment that next time I would use a mallet or rolling pin to break up the croutons into smaller pieces (like stuffing mix) The very large cubes are stay too hard and don't mingle with the cheeses as well.

We loved this....everyone gave it 5 starts...they wanted to give more.  I pounded my chicken to even them out since they were large breasts.  I used 5 cloves of garlic...we love garlic.  Everything else I followed as written and it was great.  I put tin foil over it after 30 minutes in the oven and continued cooking for another 15.  Don't skip using the fresh basil...there's no comparison to the dry.  Thanks for the easy wonderful receipe.

Excellent recipe! so easy to make and tasty to boot. I used fresh garlic paste on the base and mixed the garlic croutons with plain so as not to overpower the chicken. The crunch and chew of the topping is outstanding. Highly recommended by the whole family!

This was super easy and great. I added diced onions & bell pepper to it for extra veggies, and used 1/2 the amount of the cheeses it called for... but it was great. Sooo easy! What a great idea!

Made for fam n they devoured it.  Made a few changes, but cant remember them all, made it a few weeks ago.  Used more spices im sure, italian cheese mixture instead of just plain mozz. Used Panko bread crumb topping with butter n parsley flakes mixed in.  Im vegetarian, so i couldnt taste the dish, but fam luv'd it.  I will make this again!

Delicious and easy. Got large croutons that I will smash a bit next time to make more of a "breading" texture rather than chunks.  My husband said he liked it so much he wanted to add it to the weekly rotation.  Thank you!

I watched the Video and printed this recipe, I did not change the recipe,, I used Fresh Mozzarella and parmesan cheese like in the video. I also Seared the chicken in the pan like in the video.... Then cooked it at 350 for 35 minutes exactly and the chicken came out moist... the cheese was melted perfectly! This was a huge hit, and it was so easy.... i served with broccoli on the side for a perfect dinner. this will become a regular at my house!

My husband and I loved this for a weeknight meal!  I watched the video, so I seared the outside of my chicken before placing it in the baking dish.  I though the cheese would be too much, but it wasn't.  This is now in my rotation of handy weeknight recipes.  Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent, everyone in the fam loved it!! Next time I think I'll coarsely crush the croutons just to get the crunch and flavor evenly spread over chicken, it's a keeper!!

So easy to do and yummy, too!  The croutons added a nice crunch and buttery flavor.  The chicken breast was so tender...my "dark meat only" guy even loved it.  I agree with other reviewers...I had to cook for closer to 50 minutes to cook the chicken through.  Will definately do this again and again.

My family really liked this, especially the kids, quality croutons and a good sauce are key, and of course fresh basil. Easy weeknight meal, I also covered it about 20 min into it.would make again

It was tasty but turned out a little too dry to our liking, the sauce was probably absorbed by the croutons.  Will grind up the garlic croutons into crumbs the next time when we bake it.

This is my first review and I am not a cook but I did love this recipe. served it for lunch and seconds were given.  Chicken came out moist and I did cook it for 45min. I left out the pepper as I don't like any kinds of pepper and used a tomato sauce with cheese.   joybells

This was actually a 3.5 star dish for me but since I think that was due to my own variations I'm giving it 4 stars.  This seems more like a "deconstructed chicken parmesan" than a true chicken parm, particularly since the chicken was not breaded and browned before baking.  But it sounded tasty enough to give it a go.  Flavor-wise it's a solid 4 stars.  I think thatwill have a lot to do with whatever marinara/red sauce you choose since that's where the main flavor punch comes from.  I used thin-sliced chicken breasts since that's what I had on hand and they were kind of lost amidst the sauce/cheese/croutons.  My mistake.  Next time I'll use larger chicken breasts.  Also, I chose to top everything off with a bit more sauce befor epopping it in the oven.  Unfortunately that made for more soggy/less crunchy croutons.  But again, that was *my* mistake.  One I won't make again.  The flavor was great, though, so I'll definitely try this again.

Personally, to me this is a 4 and half stars. I did take other reviewers advice, sliced the breast thinly, and baked cover for 35 mins covered and one minute uncovered to brown the crust. One other thing I did differently, was to marinate my chicken in garlic butter (just a little,  italian seasoning and saltfor 30 minutes before assmbling the dish. Chicken was very tasty and flavorful. Definitely a "will do again" because of how tasty and easy it is to make.

great recipe.  The only thing I did differently was I cubed my chicken instead of leaving it whole breasts.  It worked out really well and the family loved it.

Awesome!!  Chef John you did it again!  Baked it for 50 minutes, as I used large breasts as well, served it to company with an italian red wine and I am still getting compliments weeks later.

My family loved this. There was only a little bit left over and my daughter had it eaten by lunchtime the next day. I would recommend this to anyone. The thing you have to be careful with is what marinara sauce you pick. I happened to pick one that was a little on the sweet side and my family asked me to look for a different one next time.

Great, easy take on chicken parm!  I crushed up the croutons, browned the chicken on the stove before putting in the oven, and ended up cooking for about 45 or 50 minutes.

Very good and easy...served it over a little pasta. You can't compare it to actual Parmesan Chicken, though. This is just a very delicious casserole dish. I do a rough crush of my croutons.

Completely DELICIOUS!!!! I did not use the crushed red pepper flakes and I added more cheese and garlic than called for.  I also crushed the croutons as I could not visualize the dish with whole croutons. My alterations aside...DELICIOUS!!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was very good. I should have read the reviews before cooking though. When I took it out of the oven after 35 minutes, the top was very brown but the minute I put the chicken on the plate, I could tell it was not done. I covered the dish with foil and put it back in the oven for 15 more minutes. The next time I make it I will either slice the breasts thinner or use tenders as others have recommended. Also, I think I will crunch up the croutons a little. I used large croutons and they got very crunchy. I think the type of sauce you use makes all the difference in the taste - be sure it is a sauce that you and your family like. All in all, it is a wonderful recipe and I will definitely make it again!

As the other reviews have stated, you will need to tack on some more time to the cook time.  I was also hoping for more crunch to the crust than was yielded from the directions.  Although the preparation steps were easy, I will most likely consider making chicken parmesan the old fashioned way next time

My Family loved this dish.  I had to cook the chicken twice as long but the breasts were on the thick side.  The recipe was perfect and I will use again and again.

This recipe is just so easy, and so good. We tried it and decided that this was going to be a family favorite. I made the mistake of putting the sauce on top of the croutons,and it was still good. I also left out the pepper flakes because I didn't have any.

Good Recipe my family says to make it again. I made a few changes...when I first read the recipe I was skeptical that 35 minutes would completely cook the chicken instead of trying it out I thougt I'd cook the chicken in the microwave, shred in the food processor with the stir blade and serve over spaghetti noodles. I also used butter instead of olive oil and omitted the crushed red pepper. I usually just buy prego and add my own spices, sweeten it with sugar and add more italian spices and other seasonings to taste. I made sure the sauce completely covered the chicken not sure if that was 2C's tho it may have been more.

I have this recipe on constant rotation. I feel like I will never make regular chicken parmigiana again! This is way easier to make and tastes absolutely delicious! My family cleans up their plates every time I make this. I follow the recipe as is and it's a hit every time! So thankful for this recipe!

Very good, the family liked it! I cut the chicken into strips  as some others suggested and I crushed up the croutons a bit. It was done in  40 minutes and the chicken was tender.  I'll add more mozzarella on top and use bread crumbs or further crush croutons next time. This was an excellent dish for ease of prep and the generous amount it made.

This was truly awful.   It's not something I would usually make but it looked simple and had great reviews and Chef John has a great reputation here so I figured it  should be pretty good.  Wrong.  The garlic on the bottom of the pan just gave everything a raw garlic taste, and the croutons wound up almost dissolving completely in the sauce.  It was like eating unflavored chicken with raw garlic, cheese, and tomato bread sauce.  I can't remember the last time I tossed foo without even attempting it for leftovers, but I couldn't even finish dinner.  Ugh.

This is delicious.  I made it once according to the directions - YUM!.  The 2nd time I changed it up as follows:  2 C Elbows-al dente; Stirred in: 24 oz. Bertolini's Vodka Sauce, 1t. minced garlic, 1 lb. of chopped rotisserie chicken, 1/2 C chopped fresh basil, 1 C mozzarella.  Put in 9x13 pan & topped with 1 C mozzarella and 1/2 cup slivered parm cheese.  Quick, easy & yummy.

Excellent !  After reading the reviews I baked the chicken and marinara 30 minutes with foil on top , then took the foil off and added the cheeses and croutons.   Used garlic & cheese croutons and crushed them up just a bit smaller     Husband lives the recipe and we have great leftovers.

Made no changes. Excellent dish! Served with pasta. Had leftovers. Thought it wouldn’t be as good when croutons were no longer crunchy, but boy was I wrong. Keeper recipe I will definitely make again and again. Gonna try gluten free next time.

Really good...I would use less croutons next time. I loved them but kids didn’t eat them and would be less carbs for me! Live the red pepper flakes on the bottom.

This is a good recipe, but we unfortunately used bigger pieces of chicken, which didn't really work out well for this. I would recommend using thinner pieces of chicken in this recipe.

I was not crazy about it. I put it in my convention/microwave oven and about half way through the cheese and the croutons were burnt. I left it in a little longer because I wanted to make sure the chicken was cooked. Chicken was dry and way over cooked. Lesson learned. I will try this dish again in my regular oven and see if it will be better.

This was absolutely delicious and I loved the ease of preparation. With 4 boys who all play sports, I need quick but tasty dinners to feed my hungry brood. This took approx. 30 minutes from start to finish. To shorten the cooking time, I used chicken cutlets. I also took other reviewers advice and added the crouton/cheese mixture during the last 10 minutes and chopped the croutons into smaller pieces using a mini chopper. My go-to sauce, if I am not making my own, is Rao’s Marinara. I added a thin layer on the  bottom in lieu of the olive oil/red pepper flakes. They gobbled it up and and everyone was happy! Now off to hockey practice.....

So easy and delicious. Gave me a chance to use up some leftover spaghetti sauce I had in the refrigerator along with some jarred sauce . I also had a couple pieces of garlic bread leftover that I cut up into cubes to top the casserole.  Served with some oven roasted asparagus, green beans and some orzo pasta

I liked this recipe a lot.  It calls for no serious effort and bakes up nicely.  My friend made it and added a splash of red wine vinegar and some cumin to the sauce, which was good.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which I think improves the flavor (and reduces the cost.)

I  think that it’s a good recipe. My family likes  traditional chicken Parmesan better. However, this is quick and easy. If I were to make it again, I would use chicken tenders, add way more garlic, more sauce, and more cheese, and top with seasoned breadcrumbs or put the croutons in the blender to make breadcrumbs.

I added a smidge more garlic and instead of chili flakes, I used chili powder to thinly cover the bottom of the pan.  I used strictly 2 cups of garlic marinara from Trader Joe’s (which was a perfect amount because my toppings didn’t get soggy in too much sauce).  I used a little extra cheese and grated the good Parmesan over the whole thing.  Of course, I salted and peppered.  I didn’t use basil, but I sprinkled some parsley.  Lastly, I crunched up the croutons to create the crunch.  Cooking at 350 took a bit longer than I wanted but it was so worth the wait.  The chicken was cooked thoroughly AND moist.  My family LOVED it!  I also had a primo italiano bread to dip with and a side salad.  I will be making again.

I made it as presented except that I used pecorino romano and asiago cheeses amd granulated garlic - probably not quite as much as indicated. It was good and enjoyed by all. It begs for some experiment next time though.

followed the recipe for ingredients winged the measurements, baked for abou 40 minutes then stuck under broiler to get cheese a little browned, the croutons got a little dark, but I like it that way.  I can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow.

I added crushed red pepper, garlic powder and tuscan seasoning to the oil in the pan.  Used chicken tenders  and did not cook them first.  Used a chunky, spicy sauce and used rolling pin to break up the croutons (not crushed).  Added lots of fresh basil and a little fresh thyme and a sprig of rosemary.  Took about 40 mins to cook.

Wow! The whole family gobbled it down and bragged about how good it was. Delicious easy recipe that I will definitely make again. I didn't have any store bought croutons in the pantry so I made my own from a sourdough bread loaf that I had. Worked great.

very good.  added croutons last 10 minutes or so, definitely don't add to begin. chicken tender. add red pepper to your taste.  I like hear, but I made for others and some commented it was tasty but spicy. actually,  I added more pepper! definitely will make again.  so much easier than traditional chicken parm. basically the same. no need for oil, just used sauce with olive oil and garlic. 2 birds, 1 stone, as they say. tu for recipe.

The instructions do not include all of the steps. The video shows the chicken being cooked prior to being put in the oven. This is not included in the instructions. The instructions also do not say whether or not to cover the pan with foil.

Loved this recipe! My roommates and I wanted pasta with this so we just added it on top of the marinara sauce then added more cheese then sauce and finished with cheese croutons and the last layer of cheese. Turned out great. We did brown the chicken and garlic on the stove before putting it in the pan. A thick sauce will be better here!

Decided to make this for dinner, then my kids had friends unexpectedly show up. A 15yr old, 13yr old, 12yr old, 11yr old & 9yr old. They demolished it. I give it 5 stars  because they all had seconds and it was extremely easy to make. The only change I made was to use chicken breast tenders. Took 40-45 minutes to cook. Great recipe!!

Easy and yummy! I took the advice of another comment and used chicken tenders. The dish cooked much faster in the oven. I also crushed the croutons a bit to break them apart. In the last 10 min, I covered it with foil to help the croutons not burn. It turned out great! Hubby and kids loved it, too! Definitely making it again!

If I could give it more stars I would! It is super quick & easy to make & delicious! I did break up the croutons as they were quite large. Next time I will bake it with half of the cheese & add the croutons and remaining cheese during the last 5 or 10 minutes. Fantastic recipe. Thank you

This is really good, quick, and easy way to make parm chicken. I cooked the chicken and first layer of cheeses for 30 minutes and then added the croutons and second layer of cheeses and cooked it for another 20 minutes. At that point I also started cooking wheat noodles to go with the dish. Everybody loved it.

I would make it again with chicken fillets. The chicken breast meat was too dry. Sauce flavors were better the second day.

Very tasty option for Chicken Parm.   I did not have the Red Pepper Flakes, but followed the directions for everything else.

Recommend reheating in a Toaster Oven, not a Microwave, to get/keep that crispy top which made this dish a 5 star instead of a 4 star.  Crushed croutons on top definitely the way to go!

I made this for a dinner party, and it got rave reviews. I used lots of extra garlic (because I LOVE garlic), and I used extra basil. I love that this recipe doesn't require me to cook the chicken prior to sticking it in the oven, which ends up taking a lot of extra time. I used chicken tenders because it's what I had on hand. The chicken came out very tender, juicy, and flavorful. This is a keeper for sure!

This is a great dish to make when you don't have a lot of time to prepare a meal.   The chicken was delicious, however, the cheese on top was too over cooked.  I will make it again, but I will add the cheese 10 minutes or so before complete.  All in all I enjoyed making the dish and the family enjoyed it as well.

Made this for dinner tonight and it came out good. I made it as per the recipe,  but added a little diced onion and oregano as well. Had a little too much sauce and cheese,  and cooked closet to 40 minutes, but otherwise it  was very good.

Looked much better than it tasted. I did use pasta noodles in it under between the layers of marinara sauce but I doubt it would make a difference. My issues with it were

1. The croutons got soggy and disgusting when I tried to cover it. I tried to meal prep it and it did not go well. It would be okay if you ate it immediately w/ no leftovers and don't cover the dish.

2. The chicken was completely raw and I cut it very thin. If attempting to make it keep in oven for atleast an hour.

I think the recipe would be decent without the croutons and if it was left in the oven for an hour or longer to fully cook the chicken. I gave it 2 stars because I'll still eat it, but I'm broke and don't believe in wasting food so that should be taken into consideration.

I think this is a great recipe but the time allotted for baking was way off...I ended up turning up my oven to 450 after 40 min and still baked an e tea 20 min as my chicken was still pink. It was fresh chicken; not frozen.

This was delicious and super easy to make!  My family loved it.  Next time I will probably chop up the croutons a bit so they are not so chunky, and add another half jar of marinara.  We served it over spaghetti and it was great.

I served this on a bed of spinach, since I didn't feel like firing up my pasta pot.  I also used an Italian shredded mixture of mozzarella, Asiago, Fontina, provolone, and Parmesan cheeses.  Some extra garlic just because we love it.  I froze half of it for an easy dinner later.

Delicious, and so quick and easy.  The only thing I would change is to add more marinara and perhaps another clove of garlic...otherwise it's a keeper.

This was delicious. I eliminated the red pepper flakes (don't like them) and used black pepper instead. I forgot to add garlic on the bottom so I put garlic powder on top. Also I added some onion flakes and a little oregano and I  used chicken breast tenders and baked it for 45 minutes (I was talking lol) salad and garlic bread and it was excellent!

This exceeded my expectations. It was so good! I used homemade pasta sauce from my freezer, and made the Garlic Croutons from this site.  It took 50 min to cook. I kept foil on for a little more than half the cooking time to prevent the top being too browned.  I know a recipe is a hit when my kids actually thank me for dinner and they did for this.

YUM!!!  We tried this recipe because it was fast easy to make a and easy to make gluten free.  We have had this twice now!  The second time we did not do the croutons and it was much better.

I made this delicious and easy dish. The only thing I did differently was when I added the croutons I crushed them instead of adding them whole. I would definitely make this again.

Used thin chicken breasts and bread crumbs as this is what I had on hand, no red pepper flakes as we don't care for that kind of heat.  Result is.....meh.  I see why you would use croutons, but you will definitely want to crush them a bit.  Breadcrumbs are mushy and lost in between cheeses.  Next time, I would use spiced panko crumbs.  No need to "sandwich" the crumbs with cheese either.  Cheese first, crumbs on top.  Cooked 20 minutes with lid, 15 w/o.  Even so, recipe is still meh.  No pizazz, but edible.  If I do again, I will use panko, with pepper jack cheese.  BTW, served on buttered wheat spaghetti with chopped spinach mixed in.

I did not like this dish.  I've had chicken parmesan and it is nothing like that.  I did use chicken breast tenders and cooked them first in the sauce.  The mistake I made was putting the croutons over the chicken first and then the cheese.  Maybe I should've tried using breaded chicken tenders and less croutons.

I really liked this recipe, it was very easy, will make it again.    The only thing I will change next time is to use croutons that have a mild seasoning or plain.  The garlic flavor of the croutons I use were too strong.

I made it for dinner huge hit with family and friends! I also found that it had to be cooked for long then said, had mine in the over for nearly an hour! I swapped out the croutons for stuffing (the corner store ran out) but I loved them, I think I’ll make it that way next time again!

One of my favorite recipes. I've frozen it ahead of time to make later (except the croutons). It's part of our regular rotation of meals.

This was good. Chicken, cheese, Italian sauce. Nothing special, but super easy.

More sauce would work better, say two jars. Still it was great served with pasta.

I will definitely be making this one again and again.  I only made one little change and that was I crushed the croutons while still in the bag. I was going to grind them real fine due to a review of someone else who had made it and that was how they did it. I actually am glad that I only coarsely crushed them. I liked the texture it gave it. This was easy to make and so tasty.  I cooked some Bow Tie pasta and served the chicken on the pasta!!

Loved it!   Made as written, except I  didn’t have basil, and it was fine without.   I pushed the croutons down in the sauce as shown on the video.   Looking forward to the leftovers and making again.

Very good recipe. Would make again, easily. The idea of baking the chicken, and without breading, makes this a much healthier option that I enjoy.

This was a nice dish but I made two crucial mistakes. I used chicken breasts that were just too plump. Choose ones that are smaller. The second mistake I made was using croutons that were too large and Chef John cautions against this in the video version of this recipe. Smaller croutons disperse better into the sauce and crisp up nicely while the larger ones tend to stick out of the sauce more and harden and burn. This would have been a great dish if I hadn't made those mistakes. You can always count on Chef John to introduce us to great dishes. Thank you Chef John.

I really liked the garlic powder on the bottom - it gave it a nice crunch/flavor where you don't usually have any. I didn't have any croutons handy, so I just used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. It took a lot longer in the oven than I was expecting, so I'll definitely allot more time when I make it next. (Probably 70 minutes, and that was at 375º, covered, for most of it.)

This was just OK not "The Best". It didn't have much flavor to us. And I did use some excellent Parmesan Regiano cheese. Maybe I didn't use enough.

I made this recipe exactly as written for a family dinner night. We should have greased the pan for easier clean-up. The flavors and textures were very meh. Everyone ate it but no one wanted seconds or to save it for leftovers.

I have made this 3 times now. It's a great casserole to make for a large group, since traditional chicken Parmesan would be too time consuming to make. My guests loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I cut my large chicken Breasts in half. That way, my guests had the option of taking a small portion or a larger one. The first time I made it, the top got a bit too dark and crunchy. The subsequent times, I loosely covered the pan with foil, and removed the foil for the last 10-15 minutes to prevent overcooking the cheese and croutons on the top. I serve this with pene or another pasta.

This meal turned out good, but I do reccomend cooking your chicken a bit and then adding the cheeses. If you cook it following the directions by the time your chicken is cooked the cheeses will be burnt.

I listened to reviewers and did make several changes.  Added a few more spices,  covered about half the cook time (in the middle), crunched up croutons and covered them with the cheese.  Oh and put slim layer of sauce on bottom of dish.  It was really super!  Everyone ate it and liked it.  Served on pasta with extra sauce.  I think only changes I would make is to add a bit more sauce and make more. I don't have any leftovers!

My husband and I agreed that it was delicious! I covered the dish for the first 40 minutes with foil then removed it for the last 20 minutes. As suggested I used real parmesan and it was worth it. Will be making this again for sure!

My family loved it! My chicken breast were big and not defrosted. Another user said that she made hers with unthawed chicken breast, so I tried it. I cut them in half after baking them in the oven for 45min in the marinara sauce along with fresh garlic, basil and just a little bit of pepper flakes. Then I topped them with the layers of cheese and croutons and baked them for another 20 min. Served it with spaghetti and salad! Delicious!!??

Easy to make,  and took about 30 minutes  to bake after I seared the  chicken breast meat.  It was a little on the salty side, otherwise everyone enjoyed eating this.

I seasoned my chicken with garlic powder and onion powder before I put the sauce on and I added extra sauce as the very last step. It turned out great and was so easy!!! I will make this again!

I am vegan, but I made this for my non-vegan family and they loved it.  I used oven roasted/seasoned frozen chickbreast cubes (Meijer). I put marinanra sauce on the bottom and mixed the garlic and pepper flakes in it. Then I followed the rest of the directions for the most part. I did put a little marinara sauce on the croutons so they would not be so hard.  Like I said, they really loved this, and I will make it for them again.

Was a bit dissapointed that the cheese on top was over cooked.  Will cover the dish while cooking next time.  I ground up the croutons using a rolling pin and it made a nice coating.  Thanks for the dish.

Delicious! I added grill mates Montreal chicken seasoning and a little adobo to the chicken and left the red pepper flakes out completely. Are used homemade sauce. Next time I will crunch of the croutons little. Everyone loved with egg noodles and salad.

It turned out great! I used fresh pesto basil, eggplant, and tomato from our garden. We loved it.  The basil turned it up 2 notches for a great flavor.

Truly a quick recipe! I put most of the spaghetti sauce on the bottom, then added some of the mozzarella cheese (I didn't have any parm) with basil. 3 chicken breasts were next. Topped with more sauce, and mozz cheese mixed with parsley and oregano with bread crumbs. I didn't use any measurements, just covered the pan. Half the time I covered with foil and it needed about 45 minutes. We're happy with the results!

I don't like chicken parmesan but I love casseroles and I thought I'd give this a try. I have obviously tweaked this up in method or ingredient use but essentially used Chef John's recipe. I'm pleased to say not only do I love it, I've made it several times and my family and I get excited when this dish is on the menu. Thank you for giving me a chicken parm I enjoy and which feeds a family of five with leftovers!

I've made this a few times now, and I absolutely love it. However, I do have a question that I hope someone can answer. (Tried to find a way to message Chef John, but couldn't find a way to). 
Is there a reason why the cheese and croutons on top slide off  of the chicken easily whenever we try to cut into a piece? It makes it a bit difficult/frustrating to eat. I've followed the recipe to a T every time. Tonight I tried crushing the croutons thinking that would help, but it ended up making the cheese sliding off the chicken even worse. Help!

As I am a vegetarian I did not eat this but made it for the rest of my family. They liked it very much. I had a bag of pre-made breaded chicken strips that I used instead of chicken breasts and baked for 25 minutes   I will definitely make this again

Definitely disappointed. I should have followed my instincts to cover with tinfoil but I follow directions exactly. Croutons and cheese are burned on the top and it still isn’t cooked after an hour.

This was given five thumbs up by my family and will go into the rotation!  That being said, I did make two changes; I cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and used Prego sauce in place of marinara (time constraint).

I like everything I've ever made of Chef John's with excellent results but this one was just okay.  My husband liked it, but I wouldn't make it again.

I used chicken tenderloins instead and cooked it for 45 minutes in a 9x9 pan. My sauce was cheap, my mozzarella was icy, and I used dried basil instead of fresh. Nonetheless, it still came out delicious and I had enough left over for chicken parmesan sandwiches the next day. Will absolutely make this again.

I freaking loved this! It's not "the best parmesan chicken", but it's a killer casserole with all of the flavors of chicken parm and a fraction of the prep.  I had it in the oven in under ten minutes, and the only reason it took an hour to bake is that my chicken breasts were large and still slightly frozen. Otherwise, this would be going in my "quicker than delivery" collection.  I'll be making this again for sure.

I made it according to the video instructions, browning the chicken before putting it in the dish. I used a marinara sauce with basil rather than adding fresh basil because of the time of year. It was excellent! My family loved it--I will definitely be making this one again. I may add some sliced mushrooms next time to complement the flavors.

I made as written with the exception of fresh basil, the store was out so i used dried. I don't think that would have made that much of a difference though. My husband's exact quote was "it's better than nothing" and my 16 year old son only ate the croutons and cheese with pasta  that i made with it. Won't be making it again.

Made this exactly except I did cut the breasts in half, and I only had mozzarella and parmesan (no romano).  I browned the breasts first as suggested in the video. Then added a dry white wine to the browning pan after the chicken was put into the baking pan and added the marinara to that frying pan before putting on the chicken in the baking pan.  Hubby gave a thumbs up and it was really pretty Easy!  Thank you Chef John for another great recipe.

I used shortcuts.  I used 5 frozen chicken patties from Costco (defrosted and cut in chunks).  Put in a 8x8 pan (lightly greased), chicken chunks, poured jarred pasta sauce on chunks and coated, used a bag of shredded mozzarella cheese (2cups).  In a separate bowl,  I took about a cup of croutons, crushed them and added 1/4 c. of bread crumbs, added 2 tbs of melted butter, mixed well.  Spread topping on top of chicken and cheese sprinkled with 1/4 c. Parmesan cheese.  Cook at 350 degree oven for about 40 mins.  I suggest a bigger pan (lightly greased), cover with foil and remove last 10 mins of cooking time.  Overall, it was easy, delicious and fast.  Served with garlic bread and salad.

Top was cooked and browned after 35 minutes, chicken was RAW the whole way through. I’m so annoyed that I didn’t scroll through to read the comments and realize the star rating was inaccurate.

I made this as is with my own marinara sauce.  My Hubby loved it.
We then made it for the super bowl crowd.  I fillet the chicken breast and made them in smaller.  Very inexpensive.  It's a keeper.

I was underwhelmed by this dish.  While more work and more mess, the Easy Chicken Parm recipe that requires pounding, breading and frying is way better....worth the extra work.

Love Chef John’s recipes. This was a great meal - trimmed and cut chicken breasts in strips. made my own sauce and lightly breaded the chicken, browning in hot oil on each side for two minutes each.   Browning added flavor although added to time it took to make i (but I think worth it).  Otherwise followed recipe exactly.   Thanks Chef John.

Very surprised how good this was!  I make my own CP but didn't feel like putting all the effort in.  I followed the recipe near exact except I used my own leftover sauce and dried basil - fresh is hard to come by this time of year.  Husband was a bit confused over the croutons but actually liked them.  I'll make this one again!

I watched the video first so I did brown the chicken. I sliced two of the larger breasts in half and then followed the recipe as is. We really liked it and I thought the leftovers were delicious too!

The idea is great simple and quick , needs more spices & maybe more layered cheese . I also think some Italian bread crumbs would be better than plain bread .

Pretty yummy! I read the reviews first and made a couple of small changes. I  put a little sauce in the bottom of the pan along with the oil & minced garlic. I also sprinkled minced garlic over top of the chicken and some salt & pepper too. I used croutons BUT I crushed them in the bag so that the pieces were much smaller (and some powdered-like consistency). Lastly, I used cut up pieces of thigh meat so that the recipe would cook more quickly. Everyone loved this!!!

This was ok for an easy dinner without having to bread and fry the chicken. I used bread crumbs instead of croutons. About half cup. If i make it again I will add more. Also I  put sauce at bottom 
With the garlic but may try putting the garlic on top of the chicken. My son really likes this

It was ok. Would not serve to company. It's not too great looking when finished. Even covered  for part of the time, mine dried out on top. But we ate it.

I was looking for something yummy and easy for the members of my psych rehab day program to make for lunch, and I found it! Absolutely delicious first time out. I've already told my wife that this meal will become our new Christmas Eve tradition later this week.

Over all we enjoyed this, the only thing I will do differently is to crush some of the croutons before adding on top. I chopped up the chicken instead of doing whole breast, but followed the same steps to prep it. Per the reviews on here I covered in foil until the last 10 minutes. It's great left over.

I used boneless chicken thighs I breaded them browned them which omitted the croutons do you think if I made it earlier in the day layered it then baked later that night would the breaded chicken be soggy

This recipe was very easy. I did sauté the chicken first, but did everything else per the recipe.
I will make this again, but maybe add more garlic, basil and a little salt.

I doubled the chopped garlic, browned the chicken breast and deglazed the pan with white wine (per video). I only had to bake for 30-35 min. My husband and I really liked it. Quick and Easy!

This was super easy to make and the family very much enjoyed it.  I used more garlic, thinly sliced chicken breasts and more fresh basil as well as a little bit more marinara on top.  I will make it again.

This was fantastic.  My 5 year old gave it "10 thumbs up".  I used a basil infused marinara sauce and parmesan petals layered on top of the mozza.  The mix of textures was great and the flavour was out-of-this-world.  I very rarely go back for seconds at supper time and I did with this recipe.  Delicious!

This is wonderful, and especially quick and easy because I had leftover sauce (frozen) that I'd made for the complicated breaded and fried version.  It took no time at all and was delicious  Thanks again, Chef John!

After reading a few reviews, I browned the chicken and did not use the mega-breasts sold; cut them in half.  I used the marinara as a base, no spray.  The  garlic and hot peppers went on the chicken instead of at the bottom of the pan.  Crushed the croutons.  Covered during the baked and then took off to brown cheese/croutons.  Use real cheese - it makes a difference and this is a keeper!

Perfect quick weeknight dinner! The kids loved it!  I did leave out the croutons though when I started cooking and realized we didn't have any! Just added some Italian seasoning and to make up for the flavor from the croutons.

I've made this recipe several times, and it is always a hit! The only changes I make is that I chop the chicken breasts up into bite size pieces and cover the dish with foil for the first part. Otherwise, it's perfect!

It was okay. My husband didn't really like that some of the croutons ended up really mushy from the sauce, while others ended up really tough and hard. The chicken had great flavor though, and wasn't dried out.

I have made this time and time again but forgot to review it.  So here goes:  this is a really delicious dish.  Hubby and teenaged son love it.  I don't make any changes but I would imagine it is very adaptable if you wanted to add sliced mushrooms, spinach, etc.  I serve it with mashed potatoes and broccoli, carrots, or Brussels sprouts.  Don't skip the croutons because that is kind of a big deal.

I made this and it was yummy! I used 4 chicken breasts and next time I will try garlic bread crumbs instead of croutons. The croutons are good however they are a little bulky.

My family loves this, we make it every few weeks. We leave half of the pan without croutons as reheating makes them a little soft. I typically use more sauce, as well.

I made this Friday night for my fiancé and myself, I added a little bit of sugar to my Ragu sauce to cut the acidity of the sauce and  used tenderloins instead of the chicken breasts, also used minced garlic instead of cloves. This came out great! Very moist and tender, great flavor. Would def do this again!

This was just ok. I followed the recipe, but it came out bland. I liked the croutons and cheese though. It was easy to make, but I think I’ll stick to traditional chicken Parmesan.

Love this recipe! My entire family will eat it (which is a very big deal :) ) and it’s easy. I usually have all of the ingredients on hand. Add a salad and it’s a winner of a busy weeknight meal.

I followed the recipe and I liked it. My wife thought it was too salty. Seemed like the croutons were the saltiest. I used cheese and garlic flavored. Next time I may just use the plain ones. But I would make it again.

I have made this dish twice already. I love how simple it is. I thin-slice the chicken breast and lay them on a bed of basil-tomato sauce over olive oil, fresh minced garlic, and then add a can of Italian style diced tomatos. Next I add a nice thick tomato-basi marinara sauce. The thin-sliced chicken makes the whole dish cook a bit faster and it gives the chicken more flavor. After I add the cheese, I top it all off with homemade croutons or add small cubes of French or hoagie bread. They toast nice on top of the cheese. Lastly, I sprinkle the top with more basil and a bit more pepper flakes. Me and my husband love this dish, and it makes superb leftovers.

This was really good.  I had homemade spaghetti/pizza sauce I thawed from my freezer vs marinara.   Also homemade herb croutons from ends of herb bread that I had made.   Used a little feta with the other two cheeses.  My chicken did need 50 min.    We made a side salad with Italian dressing, and Bow tie pasta tossed in parsley butter.  I did cover for most of the baking time because I also noticed croutons were crisping up quick.  Will make again for sure!

I made one adjustment by cutting the chicken into chunks. Other than that I followed it exactly. It has been a big hit with my family and at those potluck functions where everyone needs to bring something.

Fantastic flavour and aroma, and super easy! It became a family favourite immediately. We make it with thighs, as we enjoy the juicier meat - just as good.

Really enjoyed this. Super easy to make including making my sauce. The sauce will make the dish so buy or make a good one. The kick from the flakes is a nice touch but didnt go down well with kids!!! Staying in my favourites. Oh yes, i used chilli flakes, lol. Couldn't get pepper flakes.

I made exactly as stated and it wasn't very good.  I ended up rinsing the chicken breasts off and using them for salad.  I truly wanted to really like this recipe due to all the other awesome reviews but it just wasn't very  good for me.

Easy & tasty. Took others suggestion & crunched some of the croutons, but next time I think we'll crunch all of them. May try dicing the chicken or cutting in the middle & put some of the mozzarella cheese also for a change. Very filling.

I'm not sure why people had a hard time with this. It was perfect. I did what was shown in the video. I browned the chicken first added my own touch of my favorite seasonings, garlic powder, truffle salt, and fresh ground black pepper. I lined the bottom f the dish with sauce then fresh garlic and pepper flakes. I arranged the browned chicken breasts. Then in this order sauce, bread crumbs, cheeses, fresh basil leaves and oregano I added. I used Bread crumbs instead of croutons only because I wanted less breading but I'm sure the croutons taste awesome too! Thanks for the recipe! I added it to my favorites.

We all loved this!  I don't understand the bad reviews -  did almost everything as listed except I sprinkled Italian bread crumbs on top instead of the croutons because that's what I had in the house.  It did take about and hour  for me because the chicken I used wasn't thin cut.  I would definitely recommend fresh basil over dried, if possible.   I will be making this again!

For those reviewers disappointed in this "chicken parmesan" -- this is a baked dish, not the traditional.  And so quick and easy! As written, the results were perfect. For small chicken filets, the 35 minute cook time is spot on.

Was good. I prefer Chef John's other recipe for the actual parmesan chicken , but this recipe is great if you want to make a great tasting parmesan chicken without taking  a lot of time.  I used a jar of prepared spaghetti sauce ( Prego garden vegetable) instead of making my sauce.

Followed directions to give fair feedback.  Taste was good other than slightly salty prob from croutons.  I did not have chicken breasts, I used tenders but I adjust baking time for that difference.  This was easy and I would prob do again but would break the croutons so not so large, and use a little less.  I would use half the sauce on chicken layer and then other half  just before croutons so that they are a little crunchy but not hard. Overall, just ok for us

For as easy as this is, you cannot go wrong!  I used the entire jar of marinara sauce (28 oz).  Instead of the chicken breast halves, I bought packages of chicken tenders.  I took it to a potluck so I thought the smaller pieces would work better and it did.  I didn't have any croutons on hand so I used Italian panko, which worked great.  I will definitely make this again.

Followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of spicing it up some) and my sauce turned our very runny and watered down.  It was good, but I think next time I'll try browning the chicken first to see if that helps with the runny sauce.

Good made as written the first time I made it.    Subsequently, I have started adding an 8 oz. can drained black olives and, if I have it, green or yellow bell pepper, chopped.     I normally only put the top layer of croutons and cheese on half if I am saving the rest for the next night's meal.  The top croutons are soggy after sitting overnight in the fridge, so I just wait.  If I am planning smart, I will put each half I  its own 8 x 8 foil pan and bake one of them covered and without the croutons and cheese.  Putting the toppings on  just before baking works better.

Delicious. Embarrassingly easy! Will make again...and again...and again!! I followed the directions closely but did add some sauce with the olive oil and garlic on the bottom of the baking dish. Served with Porcini pasta. Over the top great!

This is amazing and so good.  My family loves Italian but the from scratch recipes, ( that are the best ), take a lot of time. When I came across this recipe I knew it was going to be a winner at our table. All that great Italian taste and so little work! ---- I just tweaked it a little----
*** Be sure to cover with a tent of foil until last 15 minutes of cooking and my total cook time was 50 minutes, I cooked my chicken breast first, then followed the recipe from there. I did add one forth of a cup of chopped onion. (I add onion to everything). I believe sauteing the chicken in olive oil with the onion and garlic made it so nice! Also with the leftovers the next day I cooked a little pasta and served the casserole on top, ( to make it go further). 
***Update to my review: I forgot to mention that after I cooked the chicken, I diced it into about inch sized pieces. I found it was easier to serve that way. If you want to serve a whole half piece to each person then don't cut up chicken, but for kids this worked better for me.

I made this almost exactly as the recipe said using quality ingredients and it wasn't very good.  The croutons were a yummy touch and the dish was flavorful, but cooking the chicken as directed led to it being tough and pretty bland except for the bites smothered in sauce.  I would maybe try it again but I'd doctor it up quite a bit and use smaller pieces of chicken or try searing them first as other reviewers did.

I thought this was delicious; my husband said he's not a "Chicken Parmesan type of guy", oh well.  
I used thinly sliced chicken (what I had on hand), sautéed it as shown in the video.  I used gluten free Italian bread crumbs instead of croutons, but otherwise  followed the rest of the recipe as written.  It baked for 30-35 minutes and was very moist.  I especially liked the addition of  the red pepper flakes.

Made it by following the recipe before watching Chef John's video.  It was simple, quick (work night quick), and flavorful.  After watching the video I will definitely tweak the written recipe using techniques Chef John demonstrated.

I changed the recipe up a little bit since I use this as a make ahead meal. I use chicken breast tenderloin since it is easier to cook all the way through. I use olive oil, garlic paste, basil paste and the red pepper flake to coat the bottom of the pan and it infuses the chicken with those flavors. I hedge my bets a little bit and use a pre-made marinara sauce that is tomato and basil. I add oregano on top of the marinara sauce to give it an extra Italian flavor. This is very easy and it comes out moist and with incredible flavors. BTW, it freezes well too.

Awesome recipe.  My son said it is as good as any restaurant.  Just didn't bake it with croutons on top.   Was afraid they would be soggy.   I served it with a Caesar salad that had croutons.  Chef John is the best....

I am so thankful for the recipe. I hate making dinner. But I have reached the point of hating take out more. This was perfect. I didnt use red pepper flakes but I did season the chicken with salt n pepper. And instead of croutons I poured some seasoned panko over the dish and it was great. Ty!!!!!

This was a huge hit! It's so easy to make and absolutely delicious. I would change the type of croutons I used to a smaller size, but the proportions of everything else was perfect?

Wow!! Amazing and so simple!! Now I did alter it a bit, and can't really call it a Parmesan recipe as we did not have any, but have a well aged KerryGold cheese and used Mozzarella too; and it worked well! And we used a good quality pizza sauce instead of just plain marinara, but made sure to add parsley (dried), fresh garlic and added onion powder and garlic powder too. However we don't eat grains so I chopped up pecans very fine and spread on top towards the end of cooking (35 minutes; could have taken out earlier) and put the broiler on for about 4-5 mins. It was delicious!!! So much that I feel like I have finally, once again, found something that takes like it has carbs in it but doesn't! I felt like I was eating pasta, without the pasta! lol Accompanied with steamed broccoli! Great paring! Oh and a 21 month old LOVED it, although she is a super great eater but definitely showed her love all over her face!!

Delicious!  The garlic croutons on top really make this dish!  The only thing I would change is that I would use chicken tenders instead of the breasts.  Will definitely make this dish again!

This was absolutely Delicious! It was very easy to prep and I did take the time out to sear the chicken prior to baking and it totally sealed in the flavor! I made the recipe as is and did take the advice of adding chopped basil to the sauce...WOW! We will be making this again, again, and again! Thank you Chef John! You are Brilliant!

My family really liked this dish!  My son loved the croutons. I didn't have chicken breasts so I used thighs and they worked out well. I watched the video and I liked browning the chicken prior to placing it in the pan. This is surely a keeper!

This recipe tastes wonderful. Everyone who I made this it for loved it so much they ate it for 3 meals in a row. I didn't add the croutons so it would be more low carb and it turned out great. I recommend watching the video because the chef recommended searing the chicken first, I think this made a difference because the chicken wasn't dried out and super juicy.

too much topping going on. my cheese and croutons burnt to a crisp before the chicken was finally done. I even followed the recipes measurements and temperature to the T. took me an 1 hour and 30 minutes for the chicken to cook and by that point the cheese and croutons blackened and slid right off. might have to experiment with a few quirks to perfect it.

This was really good! It was supper easy. I used boneless, skinless thigh. I had to cook it about an hour for 8 thighs, just test your temp of the chicken for 160 degrees.

I would suggest buying smaller chicken breast halves as when you use the huge ones, you need to bake it for an hour and the crust gets too brown.

Pretty good.   I used mozzarella slices because that's what I had. Croutons didn't harden 
 Baked 40 minutes. Covered the last 10 min since top was done but chicken needed a few more minutes

Two words.  DELICIOUS & EASY.  My whole family (picky kids included) loved this dish.  It was easy to prepare and the chicken was nice and juicy.  I browned the chicken breasts (seasoned with season and onion powder) before putting them in the dish to bake.  Adding this one to the rotation, its a keeper!

I was tasked with a VERY last minute potluck main dish, and I chose to make this.  Very quick and easy, and I'll make it again simply for those reasons.  I used 1.5 lbs chicken breasts which I cut into smaller "tender" sized strips.  I crushed the croutons down a bit because they just seemed so chunky.  Other than that, made it as directed.  Not the GREATEST recipe, but sure got the job done and everyone enjoyed it.

I substituted stuffing for large croutons because I don't like stuffing. The croutons were a little soggy but good. Next time I would put croutons in near the end.

Tasty and easy to make.  The red pepper flakes added a little bit of bit to the chicken.  Very filling.  If I made it again I would not add so many croutons.  I served with spaghetti on the side.

I'm not a big fan of chicken parmesan, but I really enjoyed this version.  I followed this recipe exactly, with no changes, and it turned out delicious!  I really like chicken thighs, so I think I'll give them a try next time I make this.

I made it as written and it was delicious paired with linguine.  Mine was a bit watery in the pan but was good on the pasta.  I agree that nice Parmesan is key.

I made this with some alterations and it was horrible. To be fair, I am not criticizing this recipe because I took the idea and made it my own way - I did not follow this recipe. I love chicken parm, so how could I go wrong? Well, I will tell you - I substituted Brownberry stuffing mix instead of using croutons and when I was done it looked delicious, just like in this picture. I used chicken tenderloins using of full chicken breasts as well. After letting it cool, I took my portion and expected the best. It tasted like turkey stuffing with spaghetti sauce. The stuffing mix I used was garlic and herb and with stuffing/turkey it would have been pretty good but with chicken and spaghetti sauce it was bad. I ate one dish and threw the rest away. I don't know if I will try this again, but if I do, I will follow the recipe.

Super easy, and delious.  I added more Mariana sauce, and  seasoned the chicken before cooking it. Served with pasta.
Cover with foil for half the cooking time, then uncover to brown the top.

Simple, easy, quick. I made it with 4 breasts, half the cheese, and half the croutons, and I'd go a little heavier on the cheese next time.

This was surprisingly good and much quicker than making traditional chick parm (less mess too).  The only addition I will make next time is to add more sauce. I served over spaghetti and was scraping the casserole dish for more sauce when serving. Other than that, it was great. A keeper!

Surprisingly good! Instead of the fresh basil, I used dried Italian seasoning. I used jarred sauce and lightly seasoned the chicken with garlic and onion powders, as well as salt and pepper. Then I cooked it with tin foil over the top (to speed up cooking) for 30 mins. I then added pre-shredded cheeses, a can of sliced black olives and topped with a bag of croutons,  then I baked it for an additional 15. I turned the oven off, and switched over to the broil setting and broiled the top for about 4 mins. I can't believe how easy this was, and really good! I would eat this on the regular, thanks!

Excellent recipe. Easy to make and tastes great. Perfect for invited guests. We found the pieces large so next time will use either smaller pieces of chicken or cut them up.

This was great. I think the garlic and red pepper combined in the olive oil on the bottom of the pan help create a nice flavor in the chicken.

This is a fantastic chicken bake, it's a dish I'll make repeatedly. It would scale up for a crowd really well too. If I can address some of the issues in the reviews: it is NOT a substitute for classic parmesan but has a lot of the flavors and even textures with the cheese and croutons. I did not precook the chicken, I don't think it's needed for a great dish. The croutons are KEY to this recipe. Thanks very much for sharing this great recipe!

I haven't made it yet, but your direction left out browing the chicken breasts first and using the juices  to pour over them before adding the other ingredients.  I am going to use chicken thighs.  Breaststroke have a tendency to get dry.

I followed the recipe  and it was nice and easy.  I had 2 huge pieces of chicken breast.  I cut them in half, pounded them out and proceeded as the recipe was written. Also served sautéed spinach and ciabatta bread. We are looking forward to leftovers with pasta and salad.  Definitely making this again.

According to the video, this is THE recipe on the internet.  I don't quite agree.   However,  it was good and can be added to the rotation of meals since it is so fast and easy.   I was worried about the top getting hard and that's what happened.   I did put foil on it  towards the end, but if I made this again I would try covering it the whole time and take the foil off towards the end if need be.  I'll update this the next time I make it.  I did crush the croutons so they would mash into the sauce more.

This was so fast and easy!! I used chicken tenderloins (1# package) and used all the rest same amounts (it was not too much cheese for us). Baked in an 8x8 brownie dish. My 6,4,&3 year olds scarfed this down (as well as my husband and I). Definitely going in the rotation!

It was okay, My family thought it was rather dry.  The croutons soaked up all the moisture.  Won't make again.

We enjoyed this Chicken Dish.  I used thighs instead of breasts and tostitos salsa as the tomato sauce. The time had to be increased significantly however, by 20 minutes at the temperature indicated in the recipe.

Okay I'm starting to seek out Chef Johns recipes because they are always fantastic & this one was no different & I didn't even have fresh basil & had to use dried.  But I did use homemade marinara sauce.  Followed the recipe exactly.

This was really good. I used three chicken breasts and pounded them down to about 1/2  to 1/4 and inch. Three breasts filled the pan after a good pounding.  This helped cut down on the cooking time. Next time I will use more marinara sauce.  I cooked it for 30 minutes then covered with foil and cooked an additional 10 minutes.

I liked it. My 12 year old son liked it as well, but it was too spicy for my daughter (too much red pepper). I added pepperoni but otherwise followed the directions. I think I would crush the croutons a bit next time.

We made this almost exactly as directed, and it was amazing!  The only change we made was using basil in a jar instead of fresh because there is none to be found here and this was delicious. It was also much easier to make than regular chicken parmesan. We will definitely be making this again!

This was very easy.  I used thin sliced chicken breasts. It was fork tender and delicious.  I served it over fettuccine egg noodles.

Well, my baad!!! This was certainly easy to prepare and looked appetizing when done.  I took the foil wrapped package to work to share with my coworker.  After heating in  the microwave for 3 minutes, placing it on the serving plates, I was embarrassed to find that the meat was still pink on the inside ...What went wrong??? I followed the instructions perfectly. My oven usually doesn't fool me. Well, the difference was that I substituted 2 large chicken leg quarters for the boneless breast.  That made a huge difference.  After recovering from my shock, I placed the dish back into the microwave for 3 more minutes and we both enjoyed a healthy and delicious lunch!

My family gave this recipe mixed reviews. I thought it was good but they didn't really like the croutons. Some were crunchy, and some were soggy. I guess if I made it again I would try to crush up the croutons some or use a stuffing mix. It was easy to make though and flavorful.

I really like this recipe because it is very simple and easy.  However there are a couple of things I did wrong.  I wish I had flattened the chicken breasts so they were consistent thickness.  Then the croutons I had were a bit chunky.  I would smash those next time so it was a more even topping.

I liked it better the 2nd day. My kids friends LOVED it and my picky kids thought it was decent. I used 7 organic chicken breasts and they were not exactly even.  I just upped the other ingredients a bit more. I DID use fresh mozzarella and that was awesome. I forgot to add the basil until the end and I tried to tuck it inside the best I could and it was fine.  I heated it up in the toaster oven the next day so the croutons were still crunch. Yum.
The next time I made it, I cut up the partially frozen chicken into big chunks and didn't use fresh mozzarella which I missed. I also used a panko mixture and fried onions instead of the breadcrumbs. I liked the breadcrumbs better.

I used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breasts which were easier for portion/serving control. I seasoned my tenderloins with Italian seasoning. Icovered the dish in the oven for about 15 minutes then uncovered it for the rest of the time. My boyfriend and I LOVED this recipe! I will definitely be making this again. Some of the croutons do get a little soggy, but it still does not take away from the flavor!

This recipe was a good idea, except my family did not enjoy the croutons which became mushy.  If I make it again, I think I will add them with the second layer of cheese more as a topping during the final minutes of baking.  The flavor was good though.

This was delicious!  Chicken breast came out moist and very flavorable. Used marinara sauce with Basil and garlic so did not add any additional as it was winter and no fresh Basil  was available.

The croutons were soggy after baking the dish. Also, it was OK, It looked like it would have more flavor than it did. Not bad, but I don't think I will be making it again.

I generally use a different parmesan chicken recipe but thought I would try this one as it seemed quick and easy. I used chicken tenderloins in place of chicken breast and my kids loved it! It was nice and cheesy! I gave it a 4 star as even though my husband and I enjoyed it, we did not like it as well as other parmesan chicken that we have had in the past. This one, is a kid favorite.

I followed exactly as stated, except I used Father Mark's Caesar Dressing by Father Mark found on here too! Added cut up frozen Garlic Bread with cheese on top and it was so delicious! Hubby wants this made more often as he stated while eating it. Thanks for sharing Chef John!

Definite hit at my house.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and crushed them up slightly so the topping was a combination of 'crumbs' and bigger crouton pieces.  Only other change I made was spraying dish with olive oil Pam rather than using real olive oil.  35 mins was perfect bake time for the chicken breasts I had!

I used Rao's marinara sauce and it was perfect.  The croutons get nice and crunchy and adds a little extra to the dish.  I served with thin spaghetti.   Delicious.

Made this tonight. Wish i would've watched video first, but it still came out great tasting! Had to make substitutions for what i did'nt have on hand. Cut my recipe in half with only 2 chicken breasts -  Also garlic powder in place of cloves -  seasoned croutons in place of garlic croutons. -  and Ragu (sweet Italian- sausage & cheese) spaghetti sauce in place of marinara sauce. I don't listen to negativity too much,because everyone's taste will be different  so i always try the recipes. My husband didn't care for it because he's not a spaghetti sauce eater, but he did enjoy the tenderness and juiciness of the chicken minus the cheese and sauce.  Smelled, looked and tasted great I loved it! I will make again just for single serve.

This was just ok the chicken takes a while and is not that tender and the croutons make this cumbersome, they fall off and so you eat either chicken or a giant crouton.  We ate it, the flavor was fine.  but family voted no to making it again lol

Very tasty dish. I simplified by using rotisserie chicken, which cut the cooking time down to about 25 minutes. Served with baked spaghetti squash, which was a yummy pairing!

Super easy, all-in-one dish! I recommend some extra seasonings and spices on the chicken, like salt, pepper & Italian seasoning, along with the garlic and crushed red pepper.

I thought this dish was just o.k.  It was lacking the crispness I love in a traditional chicken parm.  It sure looked good in the picture but was a little too soggy for my taste.  I loved the idea you could make it ahead of time so I might try it again making some adjustments.

Cooked it using the recipe except for the crotons. I used herb seasoned stuffing mix. (smaller stale cubes)I cut the chicken boneless breasts in half and cooked for only 40 mins.  The flavor was nothing less than amazing.

It really was just ok. Make your own marinara and leave off the breadcrumbs and it would have been better. I would recommend browning the chicken breasts first in a little olive oil and fresh garlic and instead of the breadcrumbs, dot butter over the parmesean cheese and fresh, finely hacked fresh parsley. Now you have a real winner!

I made this recently to stir up my dinner routine. Flavors were great, my only reservation was that the chicken looked "bald" at bottom of pan once the sauce, etc. were pushed away.. so If I made it again I would most likely shred chicken to spread the chicken throughout & make it more eye pleasing. Bug flavors & ease were spot on. Will make it again, but definitely shred chicken next time around.

This was a great no mess, one "pot" meal. I did make my own marinara and substituted dry basil for fresh. The breasts I used were small  and  cooking took 50 minutes. It's not a substitute for good old fashioned fried Chicken Parmesan, but it is much healthier and way easier! My family loved it.

This was an easy dish to make.  I watched the video, then followed the directions given.  I seared the chicken breasts before assembling the dish.  I did put some sauce in the bottom of the dish along with the oil, garlic and pepper flakes.  I served this to company, and everyone enjoyed thoroughly enjoyed it.  Next time I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces, as many people suggested.  I will also add more sauce or heat some sauce separately, because I served the chicken over fettuccine and needed a bit more sauce.  I will make this again.

Delicious! My hubby who doesn't like leftovers, SUGGESTED we have the leftovers! Made it just as written and very happy with the results. Baked 
For 45 minutes and the chicken was tender and moist. Will definitely make this dish again. Would be perfect for company!

I have made this twice.  First time I did not have the croutons so I used seasoned bread crumbs.  Result was very bland so I thought I would give it another try using the croutons.  It was a little better, but still fairly bland and unimpressive.  I gave it 3 stars because it was definitely easy and edible, but I will not be making this again.

This was kind of bland, even with some crushed red pepper added. Served with angel hair pasta and added more sauce. It was just "okay" but probably won't make again.

I didn't have any Parmesan and deliberately left out the croutons; I liked the texture and flavor, and it was a hit with the family.

Very good recipe. I found the video helpful as well. My girlfriend and I loved it. My only recommendation is to consider crushing your croutons while they are in the bag. I made it twice and it seemed to turn out better when I did this.

I did not have fresh herbs so I used dried. It still turned out great. Very easy too. Really took about 10 minutes or less to make. Definitely will try again. Thinking about a layer of mushrooms next time!

Thank you, Chef John. Another winner recipe for my family. I made it exactly as the recipe indicated. Added fresh basil as well. Everyone enjoyed it and request that I make it again, which is music to a busy mom's ears.

My husband kept telling how good this meal was and I' m so pleased with the ease of preparation.  I made a couple of minor changes. First I sprayed the bottom of my glass baking dish with Pam to cut down on fat, and sprinkled  2 cloves of crushed garlic and about 1/4 tsp aground red  pepper on the bottom of the dish. Next I laid my six chicken breasts on top (next time I'd definitely slice them in half length wise, or better yet slice them into tenders ), followed by a 24 oz. can of traditional Hunts spaghetti sauce. I then sprinkled about 1/8 c. Fresh parsley and 1/8 c. fresh basil. Next put 1/2 the cheeses. Because Im gluten free I coarsely crushed some almond rice crackers on top, sprayed them with Pam and sprinkled with about 1/8 t garlic powder. Then the rest of the cheeses. I baked them  for 20 minutes, covered them with foil and baked again for 20 more minutes.  Excellent and easy. Next time I'll add more marinara and serve it on spaghetti. Thanks for the recipe!

Family loved it. I seasoned and sautéed the chicken breasts. Put a large spoon full of the tomato and basil pasta sauce my family likes on the bottom of my baking dish, sprinkled chopped garlic and pepper flakes placed the sautéed chicken breasts on top followed by slices of Mozzarella cheese and croutons. Sprinkles more chopped garlic on top of that and covered with the remaining sauce. In a 350° oven covered for 45 minutes and uncovered 15 minutes because the breasts were so large. Served on top of angel hair pasta "nests"

Easy and very good flavor and texture. I put foil on the pan while it baked and liked the outcome of the croutons better. They were not to soggy and not burned in top.

I made this recipe per the directions. The chicken turned out pretty good and had good flavor. I think if I were to make this again I would make it without the croutons. I didn't really care for them in this recipe. Over all, it was pretty decent. However, my family wasn't too crazy about it so not sure if it will be a repeat for us.

This is the second time I made this recipe.  My family loves it. We are low carb eaters, so the only change I make is extra parmesan cheese on top and no croutons. Both times I doubled the recipe and baked in two seperated 9 x 13 dishes. I froze one for later quick meal.

My marinara sauce was too watery, I didn't have enough Mozerela (you need lots) and I needed more crunchies.  My family is gluten free.  I tried corn flake crumbs, but not enough.

I'll try it again and try to fix these things before I class it as a keeper.

We loved this! I used chicken tenders and omitted the red pepper flakes because I didn't have any. I used jar spaghetti sauce and crushed up the croutons. I baked it covered for 30 minutes and then added the crouton and cheese topping and put it back in for 10-15 more minutes to brown. I will definitely make it again. YUM!

I will make this again. I didn't change anything other than to cut the chicken into cubes and I put some sauce on the bottom of the pan. If you are looking for authentic chicken parmesan this isn't it but if you are looking for quick casserole that uses the same flavor type then you will enjoy this dish.

I really enjoy this recipe and so did my family.  Instead of hot pepper flakes, I used hot sauce on the bottom.  I also used deboned chicken thighs since I didn't have breasts on hand.  The rest was exactly like the recipe.  It was very tasteful and moist. I will make this again.

This was good and worth making again, my husband liked it.  I did serve it with a little spaghetti underneath the chicken.  I didn't however, coat the bowl with croutons  I used 2 breasts and cut them in half for a serving. I would definitely make it again.

The first time I made this it turned out very good.  I used my favorite, good quality bottled sauce bc I was in a hurry.  I, literally, put this recipe together in less than an hour, cooked it, and took it to the party location. My husband's family of 14, were guinea pigs for this recipe - All loved it!!  I'm making it again for my daughter's birthday for 25-30 people, her request.  It may not mimic traditional chicken parmesan, but it's very flavorful. I think the ingredients used make the difference in a successful casserole (not traditional) chicken parm.  Bon appetite!!

Was able to make this quickly and was asked if I could make it again. Very good and quick to put together.  Chicken was very moist and tender.  Was thinking it might work to add pasta or rice and some extra sauce right at the start giving a full meal in one pan.  Has anyone tried or considered this option?  Told friends and they were making also.  Definitely will be making again.

I give this 4 stars for flavor and 6 stars for ease. I didn't have fresh basil, and used spaghetti sauce instead of marinara (which could be why I felt it needed a touch more sauce).

I also had to cook it about twice as long as suggested. Like many others, I definitely feel I could twerk this to be a super easy, simple, and quick family favorite. Next time I might try and pound out the chicken breasts reduce cooking time.

Put sauce on bottom of chicken.  Browned outside of chicken in pan prior to baking.  5 stars with a good marinara!

I followed the recipe with one exception - I used bread crumbs instead of croutons.  This is really tasty and very easy.  I served it with a side of buttered spaghetti noodles.  I will definitely make this again.

It was great..it was the first time I tried Parmesan bake...the only thing I did different  was I made smaller pieces of chicken because I didn't have much time..in addition I also used pepper jack cheese to add more flavor... Turned out so yummy...took about 20 minutes to cook...yummy!!

I have made this dish twice. The first time I added pepperoni slices which gave it a pizza like taste. The second time I didn't add any and it was very good. I always season more than what is called for. I find that if I use suggested amount the dish is a little bland for my liking. I will be making this a regular.

Very good, followed the recipe, but wish I had watched the video. My chicken was of different sizes. I didn't pre- fry them. Very good nonetheless.

It came out pretty good. I followed the directions exactly the only difference is I used a whole jar of pasta sauce.  I baked it for 45 minutes. My complaints are that the chicken was a little bit dry and the cheese hardened and became very stiff. Maybe adding the cheese the later would work better.

I used 3 large chicken breasts and baked this covered for 30 minutes and then uncovered until is was golden brown on top (about 15 min.).  My husband declared this his new favorite dish.  It was delicious as leftovers too.  I am keeping this in my favorite list.  YUMMO!

This has been my go-to chicken parmesan recipe. The croutons make it! I don't always have fresh basil on hand so I usually skip that step but it always comes out delicious! Make sure you DO NOT get cheap, tasteless croutons. I have made that mistake before and the dish completely changes. Get a good, flavored brand.

Used 2 boneless breasts, fileted into small slices. Put layer of sauce, chicken, seasonings, more sauce, cheeses, CRUSHED croutons, cheeses. Baked approx 45 mins (last 15 uncovered). Used jar sauce...but strained out some liquid first so as to cut down on juice under chicken when finished. Quick, easy.

So easy!  Came out so DELICIOUS!  I might consider making it for a larger crowd.  Side of spaghetti and a salad went perfect with this dish.  I followed everything to the T, except my croutons were seasoned and not Garlic like the recipe called for.  That gives me an excuse  to make it real soon again.   All I can say is WOW, TRY IT! *****

seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and basil before adding the marinara.  Added provolone slices on top of marinara, then followed with panko crumbs and croutons.

I would have to say this had to be one of the easiest recipes I have ever made.  It came out with very robust flavor, moist chicken, and who could not like all the cheese.  I only substituted one thing.  I didn't have any croutons so I used Progresso flavored Italian bread crumbs and it was great.  It is so nice to have a recipe with about 4 ingredients that tastes so good.  This could go on my regulars list because I keep everything that is in it all the time. I can't post a picture....we are it all.

I will never make parmesan chicken any other way now. The croutons absolutely make this taste awesome! I changed the temperature on it to 400 for 30 minutes and it was still great.

Meh... I was excited since I love chicken parm and this was just so much faster. Disappointed. More of a textural thing; the croutons didn't cut it.

Made the recipe as is and we really loved it.  I used the thin sliced deboned chicken breasts and baked 40 minutes, which was perfect.  Served it over whole grain pasta with a side salad and garlic bread.  It was VERY easy and quick to put together.

Pretty good! All but one in the family liked it, but that is due to pickiness. I added extra garlic and cheese. The croutons got pretty soggy,  so that is the reason for the four stars. If I were to make it again, I would try to keep the croutons on top of the chicken, and not mixed in with all of the sauce on the sides.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this for our Valentine's Day dinner and it was a bitter disappointment. I'm not sure what I expected, but the naked chicken breasts just didn't work with the pasta sauce, and all the breading on top was just a mess. Traditional parmesan chicken with the breading directly on the pieces of meat has a much better blending of flavor and textures. Definitely won't make this one again.

it took a lot longer to bake, which caused the top to burn. do not use aluminum foil pan, i tried and it had a horrible taste compared to when i made it in casserole dish. apparently the sauce reacts with the foil, and gives it a very bad taste;-(

I made the recipe as is and it was okay (3 stars).  IF I were to make it again I would recommend the following changes:  

1.  Pound the chicken to be thin. 
2.  No garlic - too over powering
3.  More sauce, it felt a little dry

This dish is simple and delicious. We used 4 cloves of garlic instead of two and one cup of Parmesan cheese instead of 1/2 cup.  We served it with a tossed salad, it was a hit! We'll definitely make this dish again.

The taste did not live up to the reviews.  Had really wanted this to work as an alternative to lasagna, but no go.  I was able to save the chicken only and throw the rest away.

Made this for my family for dinner the other night and everyone loved it. As Chef John said, no breading or frying so that definitely saved a lot of  time. I did brown the chicken before putting in the oven so that it wouldn't need as much time in the oven. Glad I did that since it did cut back on time. Will definitely make again.

I used a spicy spaghetti sauce instead of marinara sauce and it added a lot of flavor.  I may omit the fresh basil next time as it's something I don't usually have on hand.

Made this for my picky eaters and it was a hit! I marinated the chicken in an Italian marinade overnight which made the chicken super moist and more flavorful. I used dried basil which worked out just fine. Next time I will use more marinara sauce and will serve with a side of pasta.

I seared the chicken before baking. Perfect baking time is 45 minutes. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of croutons. Fresh basil and garlic on the chicken is a must! Everyone loved it.

Made it just like the recipe except used chicken tenders like one reviewer said for better portioning. Otherwise would have cut chicken breasts into strips. Used buttery garlic croutons and regular tomato sauce. I absolutely loved the cheesy bready gobs with the sauce and chicken. So good left over too. Great recipe!

I was uncertain about this recipe after reading it, but forged ahead and was pleasantly surprised.  I followed the recipe, using my homemade sauce and croutons.  I chose to cut my chicken breasts in half as they were rather hefty (to reduce oven time) and I also sauteed briefly per the Chef's video.  Served with angel hair pasta and additional sauce.  I would make again and can imagine additions and variations.

This was a really easy and tasty dish.  Everyone in my family loved it.  Here are the changes I made:

I used a whole jar of sauce.

I highly recommend using thin sliced chicken breast, OR pounding the thick ones out thin. 

I baked mine at 400 for about 35 minutes, it came out perfect.

I followed the recipe as stated for the first time without reading the reviews. Never again. The sauce was ok but the chicken had NO flavour. I had to season it after it was cooked and stick it back in the oven for a few minutes. Basic salt and pepper would have gone a long way. I would have to play around with different cheeses, seasonings, etc. For this to be attempted again.

Super easy. Very delicious. Great dish to make ahead (uncooked). I'll leave off the croutons next time and replace with breadcrumbs and butter it the last 5 minutes under the broiler.

This was good and a lot healthier than the original fried chicken parm.   I used a lot more garlic on the bottom and could have used more.  I used gluten free croutons because that is all that I had.  I am sure the garlic croutons would have been better, but I can't eat them.  I did add extra garlic and spices on top of the sauce, but could have used more.  I didn't have fresh basil either, so I used dried.  Fresh would have been better.  My rating would stay the same.

I didn't use croutons, but instead made my own breadcrumbs from a couple of slices of  multigrain bread.  I also butterflied three chicken breasts to ensure the chicken would cook through in 35 minutes (and save on the cost of the dish too).  Other than that I followed the recipe and everyone loved it.

I should've just taken the time to make chicken Parmesan. It was ok for a quick dinner though.

So simple and easy!
Important keys are the quality of the sauce that you use, and the crutons (I just used some I had on hand, but garlic would have been a real improvement).   Probably not the best chicken parmigiana, but surely the easiest.

I used thighs that I marinaded all day so that helped with tenderness.  Cheese amounts about right.  Great as a leftover as well.  Best thing - easy!

This dish was so good! Even my daughter who is a picky eater loved it. The dish is better the first night, but if you have left overs, I suggest reheating in the oven not the microwave so the croutons stay crunchy.

This was SO QUICK and EASY!!! And it was so tasty that everyone was arguing over who got the leftovers! Served it over spaghetti and it was a HUGE HIT! Made it exactly as the recipe said except cut it down to 3 and it was plenty for 3 plus leftovers!

This was a great casserole. My husband and I both enjoyed it. I used chicken breast tenderloins (about 2.2 lb), poured some marinara in the bottom of the dish before adding chicken and crushed the croutons as others suggested then added garlic powder and Italian seasoning mix to the top layer of marinara.

Excellent and looks delicious, too. I used fresh, toasted bread instead of croutons. I also added the amount of fresh basil and garlic, using 6 cloves. Time in oven was 1 hour.

Not one of my favorites, maybe i used to much sauce but the cheese seemed to be completely melted into the sauce.  Croutons were just mushy. I did have to bake a lot longer then 30 minutes.  Probably won't try again.

This was just ok. I was looking for a quick and easy recipe and this sounded like it would fit the bill. However, my chicken was overcooked on the thin part of the breasts. The flavor was just so-so despite using a high end marinara. At this point in my  cooking life, I think I am going to stay away from recipes that call for a chicken breast that is not a cutlet or paillard. I find that   pounding the breast flat is the best way to maintain even cooking and juicy chicken breast (roasting a whole chicken notwithstanding).

The key to the success of this dish is watching the video first! Browning the chicken before adding to the casserole dish makes a world of difference. It won't take nearly as long in the oven this way which saves the croutons from over cooking. This was delicious and a great weeknight alternate to regular chicken parm. Don't give up on this one, with a few small tweaks it's a great dish!

Came out OK, but next time I'll rub my chicken with some garlic, pepper, and a little salt.  The topside of the chicken came out a little bland.

This was very good, however I used Stove top stuffing in place of the croutons, because I didn't have any and it made a little to salty.  Next time I will be sure to use regular croutons.  I also added Mushrooms to my homemade marinara sauce.  I really loved the crunchy topping.

I really loved this. It was exceptionally easy. My children complimented me on how good it was. We all have Celiac's and I didn't have GF croutons, so I threw in the GF stuffing mix I didn't make over the the holidays. It was so nice the have the easy bread component.  I will absolutely be making this one again. Thank you for this easy and tasty recipe.

This is very easy and very good! Everyone loved it. Its hard to transport though because the crouton crumbs will be totally moist from the marinara if you cover it as all. I recommend if you're cooking ahead or transporting to toast the crouton crumbs separately and pour them on top later.

Quite good.  I made it  for a friend who needs to go gluten free and this fit the bill since I left out the croutons and served it over rice.  We both loved it.  Husband had the leftovers  and he loved it too.  I'm glad I tried it and will make it again for sure.  Oh I forgot to mention that I did not add the cheese until the last 15 minutes as I didn't know how long it would take for the chicken to get done and didn't want tough cheese on top.  The chicken took almost an hour so I'm glad I held the cheese until the end.

this recipe is awesome. Since I have small children, I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and fried them first,  careful not to overcook them.  Put it in the baking dish, poured the sauce over top, then spaghetti,  and the cheeses on top.  Baked that for 20 minutes and then turned on the broiler until the cheese was browned. So yummy and quick!

This was great to make on a week night when you have activities after school.  I prepared it ahead of time and then just popped it in the oven.  The kids loved it so much I'm making it for dinner tonight again!  I didn't have the pepper flakes and I used garlic powder.

Easy and tasty main dish!  The second time I made it, I modified it slightly by cubing the boneless chicken; this made serving much easier, and the whole dish was pretty much a casserole.  Very good recipe!

split the cheese combo up with mozzarella, parmesan, and romano which added some flavor.  no fresh basil on hand, so I subbed 1 teaspoon of dried for the 1/4 cup of fresh.  served over garlic olive oil angel hair pasta....a very tasty dish!  and no frying!

This recipe has been a huge hit in our house, I made this kinda on the fly and it turned out amazing!!!  To have a meal that good you would think you would have to put a lot more time and effort into it, but you don't!!! This will be a usual in our house from now on.
Thanks Chef John!!

This was ok.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and browned the meat beforehand.  Unfortunately, what we ended up with was fairly bland/dry chicken, with a crunchy flavorful topping that would slide right off.  Not the best.

Very tasty and simple to make.  Next time I'll follow Chef John's advice that "less is more" regarding the tomato sauce.  Also, since I cut my chicken into smaller pieces, I'll mark them (maybe with a toothpick) so they are easier to find in the yummy sauce.  Definitely a winning recipe!

I made this last night and it was fantastic! Super easy and delicious and my husband can't wait to have leftovers for lunch. I didn't have any croutons so I cut up a couple buns and lightly toasted them. I also used Blue Parrot spaghetti sauce for the marinara. This one will be a go to recipe in the future.

As usual, another fantastic recipe found on this site!! The only thing I did different, I used my homemade marinara instead of store bought. (My Spaghetti sauce, so it has olives and mushrooms in it) I also used bread crumbs (per another review) instead of the croutons. I ended up baking it for 45 minutes. Served with garlic bread of course. Delicious!!!!

Turned out good and I would make it again.  The croutons were too mushy for my liking so next time I'd use smaller ones.

I had always heard/read that poultry should be cooked to at least 165 degrees?
This was okay It possible could depend on the brand of marinara sauce that changes the flavor.  I dont use much marinara so I guess I haven't found one that really stands out.

I follow the recipe preaty close but I add 1/8 inch slices of eggplant to mine. I will wrap the chicken into a large slice or 2 of rinsed eggplant (slice the eggplant at a 1/8 " thickness on a Madeleine, place the eggplant in a colander and sprinkle with sea salt and let sit in the sink to drain and leach the moisture for about 30 to 40 minutes, then rinse the salt off  the eggplant and pat it all dry on thick absorbent paper towels.

next I sprayed the bottom of the baking dish with olive oil pam, then added my favorite spaghetti sauce, for me garlic and basil.

I add the chicken thighs and breast to a large cast-iron skillet with 1st press olive oil and 6 large clove of roasted garlic, {I always roast off 4 to 6 LARGE whole garlics wraped in tin foil sprayed with a little pam olive oil and some course sea salt, like pink a Himalayan, or a Flure De Lure...is how the last is speeled I hope it's in French and I'm jusy and odd hay seed ??. you want to crisp in the natural juices with a high hot burner setting...be very careful of the grease spray back.
once you have finnished the chicken place on the paper towel re-pat to remove excess oil & grease.

place chicken into the backing dishadd chicken broth to the dish to come up on the chicken about1/4 of the way.
top with a mozzarella and parmesan, a little care free application of Panko bread crumbs mixed with chopped fresh parsley and parmesan cheese and a cool crisp garden salad, and perhaps a cauliflower and broccoli potatoes

The picture posted is so misleading. Mine looked nothing like that. I should have taken a picture. Maybe I'll take a picture of the leftovers I threw in the trash. I followed this receipe to the letter, just leaving out the red pepper flakes. I only baked it for 35 minutes & the croutons & cheese were burnt & hard as a rock, so you couldn't eat that. All that was left was the chicken. It was okay, but I've had better chicken. I won't be making this dish again. It sucked!

So good. I cooked the chicken before. (Cut each breast in half, seasoned with Montreal chicken seasoning, and baked for 20 min). Then chopped it up and added the rest. I didn't add the bread crumbs but added turkey pepperoni to give it a pizza flavor. So yummy. Thanks

Had a very good flavor but I really did care much for the croutons. I will probably make it next time without the croutons.

I used chicken tenders because that is what I had on hand, also I crushed the croutons a bit. Very easy and tasty recipe.  I would definitely make this again.  Thanks

Wow! I've never been a huge fan of chicken OR marinara sauce, but for some reason I decided to try this. I'm so glad I did! I loved it! I froze a few portions to save for later, so I hope it freezes well.

My whole family loved the dish and that is very unusual. It had the perfect amount of crunch without having to fry the chicken. Quick meal to make after a busy/long day at work. Leftovers are just as good (if you have any leftovers).

I like that it was easy to make, with little mess, and didn't take long.  It was very good.  I would recommend using more sauce and dishing it on a bed of fettuccine.  I plan to make it again.

Pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I pounded out the thick ends of the chicken breasts a bit, and then cut each piece into two for more even cooking (and to make smaller portions since we have kids). It smelled freaking amazing in the oven while it baked! I let it bake 40 minutes and the chicken was done perfectly. It tasted great. Only problem was that I ended up with a lot of liquid at the bottom of the pan for some reason. So I used a slotted spoon to dish it out and it wasn't too much of a problem. Everybody quite liked it. Served over fettuccine with a big salad. I suggest putting extra marinara sauce on the table for spooning, if serving with pasta, as the casserole doesn't yield much sauce.

Turned out great -- chicken was perfectly tender...entire dish was extremely flavorful. I doubled the recipe (we had guests), and while the fresh dish had exactly the right 'bread crunch' the crouton bits swelled considerably in the leftovers. Next go 'round I will probably reduce the croutons and cheese by 1/3 each (especially if cooking with leftovers in mind). Guests also seemed to prefer a tablespoon of fresh marina on each serving (diced tomatoes, olive oil, black pepper, fresh basil, dried oregano...left to simmer while main dish baked).

Excellent. Chicken was moist and the croutons are a nice added touch. Maybe next time I'll crunch them up.

Yummy, cut 3 large breasts into tenders, cooked about 40 min was perfect. 1Tbs. oil 1/4 tsp red pepper, 1 tsp. crushed garlic, swirl it around the pan, then coat both sides of chicken with oil mixture. Use a whole 24 oz jar of sauce over chicken, use about 2 cups rough crushed croutons, if you leave them whole it's to big

It was a good quick meal for family (while I was cooking New Year's dinner ahead of time.)  Used chicken tenders (cooked faster) Didn't have croutons so used leftover cornbread dressing (sorta dry) for top.. worked well! Kids ate it up, sorry no photo, it went too fast. p.s.We liked the  red pepper flakes! hotter the better for us! I would use this as a fast busy mid week meal, but not for company.

This was quick and easy and good tasting.  I served with leftover spaghetti noodles sautéed in a skillet with olive oil, butter, garlic and seasonings.  Loved the croutons.  I will be making this again as every item is usually in my pantry.

I have made this recipe for years (but I do the croutons and additional cheese for last 10 mins. of baking). We love it. 

P.S. - I am half Italian and make a lot of Italian food.

This turned out great. I added about 1/4 ricotta to the mix. I made 3 chicken breast in an 8x8 glass casserole and cooked for 50 minutes and they came out perfect. I will definitely be making this one again.

My kids ate all of this, amazing. Did not watch the video first, though I probably would have made the same adjustments even if I had.  Proportions weren't exact (more chicken in total and a mishap resulted in too much red pepper), but it was still good. I used thin cut chicken breasts, fat free mozzarella, and Romano cheese. I did not pre-fry the chicken, and the whole casserole was juicier but still ok. Also had some older cheese bread from Wegmans, which I cubed and left out for a few hours to dry (instead of croutons).  Only change next time is I'll make two pans. I double layered the chicken in a 9x13 and they were a little hard to get out individually.  Will definitely make this again (likely will leave out the red pepper altogether) because it was good and super easy.

This was amazing! I used extra thin chicken breasts. I did not use the pepper flakes. I also used a whole jar of marinara. I used a good jar of marinara, don't go cheap on the sauce it made the difference ??.

Ok, but some flavors were a, little overpowering.  Needs some work.

This was very good and very easy.  The only change I made was using chicken tenders and I did crush up the croutons a little.   My husband really liked the crust on this.  I will definitely be making this often!

This tastes good and is kid-friendly.  It is not that difficult to fix.  The  only change I made was to use the whole bottle of marinara sauce (28oz).  Even with the additional sauce, the final product was not too "saucy".   The directions note that bake time will vary according to thickness of the meat.  Mine took 40min.  I will be fixing this again.

If anyone else had posted this I would have instantly dismissed it as some medagon travesty but because it's Chef John and me & my husband so enjoy his videos & have loved so many of his recipes I decided to give it a try mostly to use up some sauce from our previous pizza night. It was pretty tasty & a pleasure to make without the breaking/ frying mess that I've grown so weary of. Thanks Chef John. Keep 'me coming!!!!!!!

Great recipe. Easy to make and egg free. I made this for a large group of teens and one of them has an egg allergy. Everyone loved it. Will definitely be making again!

It was really good!  I made by the directions with minor changes.  It will only be as good as the sauce and croutons you use.  I used Vitoria Tomato Basil premium sauce and a bag of Olive Garden Garlic and Romano croutons.  The only change I made was to use boneless chicken thighs, because I prefer them.  I put a thin layer of sauce on the bottom.  I did brown the chicken and deglaze the pan as in the video with Marsala wine and used sliced fresh mozzarella and Kraft shredded Italian cheese blend.  I pushed several croutons down into the sauce and broke up the rest used on top and patted them down.  Served it over some angel hair pasta.  I will definitely make again.

My boyfriend and I loved it. We made some pasta on the side and was a perfect meal.  I browned the chicken first and my sauce had basil and garlic already so I didn't add either of those (as suggested in the help video). Will make all the time. Thank you!

I love the giant crunchy, moist bits of croutons.  I couldn't find garlic, so I used ranch ones.  Still came out amazing.  Definitely making again next week.

This was exactly as advertised - super easy prep and delicious result!  I think some of the reviewers expected the result to be more like homemade chicken parmesan, which requires a lot more prep time/ingredients.  This was the perfect quick weekday meal, between work, soccer practice, etc.  Kids and husband asked for seconds.  I followed to the letter and the only thing I would do differently would be to crush the croutons before putting them on top.  Let's face it, you can't go wrong with marinara, cheese and garlic croutons!

Followed recipe as printed and this turned out great! The croutons were really a nice touch and added that nice crunch. I even made sure some of them were partially in the sauce and that really added a great texture.

Made this recipe as written half the chicken breast so the would bake in a 30 minute time.  It was easy and delicious.  The negative reviews may not be experienced cooks so they made some errors to call it a failure. This recipe is a good one to prep before church and then bake for 30 min.afterward.   Try it over pasta, with salad and rolls.  It company worthy.   Bless you all!

I've made this once.   The only thing I did different was to cut up the chicken in small bite-size pieces, easier to eat.   I also used my own home-made tomato sauce.   It turned out very good.

Everyone has their own tastes, but I did not like the croutons in it at all.  When I asked my husband about the dish, he replied, "I'm not crazy about it."  I would make it again, but I would totally leave out the croutons, or I might would consider mixing panko crumbs and parmesan cheese for the top.  The croutons did not blend in with this dish and the next day it was just soggy.

I've made chicken parm often, and this recipe is a winner!  Make sure you use fresh basil and fresh parmesan for best flavor.  I also crushed the croutons to a finer texture to spread evenly over casserole.  It was great, just by itself.  Will be making this one again.

Would try with stuffing mix rather than croutons they were a tad too large and crusty for my liking

It was really good and I didn't watch the video first so I didn't see the tips on browning the chicken breasts first, etc. BUT in spite of me following only the written directions and kind of tossing it together quickly because I was late getting started on the family dinner, it turned out very tasty and looked pretty good in the glass baking dish!!!  I did have rather large chicken breasts so I sliced them in half, lengthwise and then arranged them in the pan.  Not so sure about the use of the croutons and when I went back in and watched the video I noted that Chef John used a lot more croutons than I did so maybe next time I'll try to add more.  I was guessing because I buy the croutons in large, bulk packaging so didn't quite know how many croutons equaled 5 ounces.  My family really liked it and I served it with a salad and some pasta.

Easy to make. Really delicious. Next time I'll go easier on the tomato sauce. If you use too much sauce you end up boiling the chicken.

Made this the other night and my husband loved it...and he is a very picky eater!  Simple and fast to make.  The only change I did was to sear the chicken for a couple of minutes on each side in extra virgin olive oil before putting it in the casserole dish,  Tasted Great!!

I'm not sure what the fuss is about. I made this tonight. The flavors and textures were good, but the presentation isn't. Once you lift a chicken breast out of the pan, the cheeses kind of slip off and the croutons do too, so it isn't pretty. The croutons in no way mimic a parmesan-chicken type texture. The recipe tastes exactly like what it is: croutons over chicken and marinara sauce. I probably won't make this again. Real chicken parm is not much more work and it's so much better.

I would add more spice to the sauce and use bread crumbs instead of croutons.    Italian seasoning, basil, dash of cayenne....

It just seemed kind of tasteless. I'm wondering if maybe marinating the chicken prior to cooking might help.

I don't know what everyone is complaining about, I thought this was good!  
I had leftover chicken from a crockpot chicken I'd made the night before, used that on the bottom.  Also, added my spaghetti noodles to the sauce layer.  But otherwise, followed the directions.  Used foil on top for 30 minutes, 5 minutes without.  BF loved it and said it was the best dish I'd ever made (although this kind of offended me, since I'm 100% Italian and home cook every night)

Will definitely make again, next time I have leftover chicken.

I followed this recipe as given except for using spaghetti sauce rather than marinara (and using about 1/3 more than the recipe called for so I could use up the jar); and using chicken tenderloins rather than chicken breasts.

I watched the video first, and sautéed my chicken first like the video showed. But if I'd seen the video before buying the ingredients, I'd have looked for a different recipe because sauteeing is an extra step that makes it less quick and convenient. Sauteeing was NOT mentioned in the written recipe, which I found shoddy. Nearly 800 reviews and that discrepancy hasn't been noticed and corrected?!

It was an "okay" dish, but my family usually gobbles up seconds and they did not refill their plates. . The croutons seemed not the best choice. Just kind of fattening and weird, not adding any great pleasing crunch. Why not instead use a starch like rice, noodles, or potatoes to make it more of a full meal casserole instead? Better yet, include a green vegetable too and have a whole meal in one pan for your trouble. I'd overlook that if it was an exceptional recipe but it was not.

This dish smells heavenly while cooking.  I followed Chef John's video and recipe. I did not have the small garlic croutons and sent my husband to the store for them. He came home with large Caesar croutons which I lightly crushed up before adding them on my first layer of cheese. I intended to brown the chicken as Chef John recommends, but also states is not necessary.  I  followed all other instructions to a tee. YES...  this is not true chicken Parmesan, but it gives the same flavor and is a moist,  flavorful chicken dish. It is also very quick and easy to prepare. All five members of my family agree, this is a winner! Next time I'll try browning the chicken and de-glazing the pan as chef John suggest. Thank you for another amazing recipe!

This is a great recipe for chicken parmesan flavor without all the fuss. My husband's favorite dinner is Chicken Parmesan; he orders it frequently when out in a restaurant. He raved about this dish after the first time I made it, and it has been a regular  on our dinner table ever since. When I make it for kids, I cube the chicken and then brown it very lightly in olive oil, garlic, and a a tiny bit of red pepper flakes. It makes it easier for small hands to manage. We are so glad we found this recipe. Absolutely love!

It turned out very tasty. I used boneless chicken thigh's instead of breast's, and cut them into bite size pieces. Cutting up the chicken should eliminate any issues with it taking to long to cook. Also, I added more Parmesan than the recipe called for. I also recommend using fresh Parmesan. Some of the croutons down in the liquid were a little soggy, but it was still good.

This was excellent. Both my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I didn't have fresh  basil so used dried, which worked well.  Otherwise I made it as per the recipe.  It was extremely tasty and very easy to put together.  I cooked it for about 45 minutes which was enough.  I would definitely make this again.

I thought this was just ok. Not delicious but not terrible. I added sausage to the dish to give it a little bit more variety. I also added noodles. I think it would've been too bland by itself. I also don't know how I feel about the croutons for a crunchy top. I probably would've normally used panko bread crumbs or something that would've added a little more to the dish. I'll be changing it up a bit if I make this again.

Delicious and easy to make. I used thinly sliced chicken breast like Chef John suggested in the video, and browned them a bit before baking.  I also lightly crushed my croutons with a rolling pin. My  hudband liked it and the leftovers were amazing.

I made this on Thanksgiving because my family is not a big fan of turkey. It was great, very easy to make, and everyone loved it. It did not last very long. I made it again and used it in containers for lunch at work. It was still very good reheated in the microwave for lunch. I will definitely be making this again.

Finally... a very easy, great recipe that my husband (who can't eat onions or peppers) can eat and enjoy.

It is quick and easy to make. It would work great for surprise company. I used boneless thighs because I prefer dark meat. Thank you!

This was pretty good, especially considering how easy it was to throw together. Since my chicken breasts were on the thicker side I let it bake for 40-45 minutes. This caused my cheese topping to get a little too dry and crispy, next time I will cover with foil for the fist 30 minutes to keep it from drying out.

I will definitely make this again! Yummy! and much easier and lighter than the traditional Chicken Parmesan recipe - just like the recipe says - and I did pan sear the chicken first as in the video for extra flavor.

The flavor was good, but I did not like the whole croutons on the top. If I were to make it again, I would crush the croutons first.

Fairly easy and a nice change to pasta and sauce. Made a half recipe. Put tomato and basil Classico sauce on bottom of pan. Defrosted 2-3 chicken breasts,  sliced in half (thin way), and put on top of sauce. Generously sprinkled spices on top of chicken (red pepper flakes, poultry seasoning, garlic powder and basil).  Then pour rest of sauce on top of chicken. Baked at 350 for about 50 mins. Then put mozzarella and shredded parmesan cheese on top, along with broken up croutons (add extra croutons). Broil for 1-2 minutes. Can serve alone or with pasta. If eating with pasta, use extra sauce.

The overall concept is great!  I sliced the chicken breasts in half horizontally then  brushed both sides of each breast with a mixture of the olive oil, crushed garlic and red pepper. I let the chicken sit for an hour to absorb the flavor from the garlic and red pepper then proceeded per the  directions.  Recommend slightly crushing the croutons.

I made this almost as written. Doubled the cheeses and used thighs instead of breasts, added mushrooms. Definitely a keeper!

This is really good, and I'm definitely going to make it again. The croutons were too crunchy, and it made eating it difficult. But, I think that is a really easy fix. Next time I'll either use smaller croutons or put them in a ziplock and break them up a bit first. I also think mixing them in the sauce instead of just pouring them over the top might help. All in all the flavor is really good, and I'll be adding this to the rotation.

Has anyone tried this recipe with chicken thighs instead of breasts? Chicken thighs are a hit in our house lately.

Otherwise, I think this recipe will now be in our weekly rotation. My husband and I both liked it. My two year old son loved the croutons and will hopefully eat more as I make it more often.

Being there are just the two of us, we made  a half portion in a cast iron skillet  and just eyeballed the ingredients. Wow, can y'all say, stuffed? Next time we will try adding mushrooms and maybe tweak it a little bit, but maybe not. She's puttin it up now so I'll stop nibbling on the leftovers.

We made this exactly like the recipe and it was amazing. I took it to a work potluck and everyone was complementing on how good it was.  It was also very easy to make.   Will definitely make this again.  The only thing I will change is to cut the chicken breasts into smaller chunks so the sauce absorbs more into the chicken.

This was simply awesome and super easy. I made the recipe exactly as written and I have to say the croutons and fresh basil made this dish! It was prepped and on the table within 45 minutes. I used somewhat thinner cutlets. I may use crushed croutons on chicken for the rest of my life...haha. Thank you Chef John!

was kind of surprised at how low-maintenance this recipe was. I'm wondering whether or not bread crumbs could be used instead of the croutons?  No matter, thanks for the recipe!

I don't know why anyone would give this less than 4 stars. It's delicious! Even my VERY picky husband loved it! The one and only change I made was using a jar of Prego Garlic and Herb spaghetti sauce instead of marinara sauce. I used fresh basil from my garden and really good buffalo mozzarella that I cut into slices because it's hard to grate. I baked it for about 40 minutes and then served it with buttered spaghetti noodles, salad and garlic bread. This recipe is a keeper for sure!!

Yummy. I did use about one half cheese, based on other's comments,  was still great.  Leftovers are exceptional as well. I will make again.

I cut the chicken breasts up smaller and brought it to a pot luck at work. everyone seemed to like it. I thought it was simple to make and tasted good reheated. Next time I will probably get smaller croutons (the ones I got were fairly large) or crush them up a bit and definitely add more cheese!

I liked this recipe everything came out good the only thing I would do differently next time is cut up my chicken. I'm not a big chicken fan and the next time I make this I will put the oil at the bottom of the pan then lay the cooked penn noodles  then lay the cut up chicken over the noodles, and complete the rest of the steps. I'm pregnant so I did add a layer of bacon after laying the chicken and it was the best.All n all it was really good and my family loved it.

i made this tonight and it was great! I flatened the chicken with a meat mallet then cut them in half and seasoned with garlic powder,  onion powder, salt & pepper. Then  I cooked them for 2 minutes  per side in the skillet  just to speed up the cooking time. Baked for 15 minutes.Allso doubled the chicken but not the cheese or sauce and it was perfect, VERY cheesy!  i know i made a lot of changes to this recipe but the original one would be amazing also:)

This is awesome. My picky kids loved it. The only suggestion I would make is to chunk the chicken so you can scoop it onto the plate and not have to hunt to find the separations between the beast.

I made this recipe for my husband and I. 4 large skinless boneless chicken breasts were just perfect instead of 6. Next time I make it I'm omitting the Red Pepper Flakes (which were too spicy for my plaet, my husband loved them) 
Also I might grind the bread crumbs, but overall we loved this dish.

This was amazing!  I didn't have any fresh basil so I smeared pesto on the chicken before pouring on the marinara sauce.  This was the only change I made and it turned out superb!  Definitely adding to our dinner rotation.

Delicious! Very easy to make. The croutons add so much flavor.  The only difference I made the second time I made it was to make the croutons a little smaller by pounding them a bit.

This was delicious! I was not sure about the croutons so I only used a few and wish I had used the whole bag. I also used breadcrumbs and cheddar cheese. 
Made some noodles and this was a huge hit!

I made this according to the recipe and was quite disappointed. Surprisingly, my 6 year old liked it, but as it was I was not to fond of it. After reading some of the reviews though I may try it again. My first thought was to crumble the croutons a bit, and I also like some people's suggestion of using chicken tenders instead. I'll probably give it another shot, take some of the advice I found and re-review accordingly.

This was quick and easy. I used my favorite homemade marinara sauce and served it over thin spaghetti. Next time I need to butterfly the breasts though. So good!

Terrific recipe.  I did take the advice in the video and seared the chicken prior to assembly, and it was worth it.  Very good take on Chicken Parm.

Unfortunately I found this recipe very disappointing. I followed it exactly as written. It simply didn't taste great - a crouton topping just isn't enough for parmesan chicken. Stick to a classic recipe for chicken parm.

It was OK.  Not as flavorable as I thought it would be.  I'm not a huge fan of chicken breast.  May try again with chicken thighs.  Thanks for the recipe!

IF ANYONE TRULY  KNOWS HOW TO COOK YOU'D KNOW THAT THE INGREDIENTS COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER AND IT'S UP TO YOU TO ADJUST HOW MUCH RED PEPPER,SALT BLK PEPPER, GARLIC, CHEESE ETC.... I USED THIGHS BECAUSE THATS WHAT I HAD. CHEF JOHN WHO EVER HE IS CAN REALLY COOK. AND YOU'D NEVER GO WRONG WITH HIS RECIPES. I ADDED FINELY CHOPPED JALAPENOS TO THE MARINARA SAUCE BECAUSE I LIKE IT HOT!!

This recipe was fast to assemble and while it was cooking I made spaghetti and paired it with that.  Great weeknight meal - and great flavors.  I'm going to make it until the cheese and croutons for some guests coming next week on a weeknight.  I'll essentially have to finish the layers and throw it in the oven and done.  Great recipe!

I wish I had watched the video before I made this. The video browns the chicken first. I think I would have enjoyed it more that way. The only change I made was to cut the chicken into pieces instead of leaving the breasts whole. This was good, but not great. I will make it again and brown the chicken next time. If that changes my review, I will update it. I think pieces of pepperoni scattered on top of the chicken would also be an interesting addition.

I made this tonight and followed some of the tips from other cooks out there. I covered the baking dish with sauce, and placed the chicken on it and proceeded from there. I used a garlic seasoning spice that we like and dehydrated basil as mine is done for the year. I had used 2 large chicken breasts and cut them into smaller and thinner portions. It took 55 minutes until the chicken was done. Next time I would cover the dish for the first  30 minutes or so, and then uncover it and let it brown. The top of mine got too dark brown but not burned. It was tasty enough but I think it would taste even better if the chicken was more tender.

Quick and easy to make, everyone loved it. Definitely a good suggestion to cut chicken breast in half first. Next time I will probably add a  second layer of breadcrumb. Thank you.

Super easy and very tasty!  I did have some extra time on my hands so I opted to brown my chicken first to help seal in the moisture.  Served with spaghetti squash for a healthier twist.

Holy cow was I shocked at how good this was. I went a little heavy on the garlic and red pepper, and basil too now that I think about it, but other than that - kept to the recipe.

I was surprised at how flavorful this was. I was worried it would taste just like I dumped a jar or marinara sauce into a pan and baked it - but it ends up being much greater than the sum of its parts.

I made this the other night after a hectic day.  It was quick and easy to put together.  It tasted great.  Improvise with your own seasonings.  My family enjoyed it very much and it made for great leftovers.

Love this recipe! I followed it exactly and then added oregano with the basil and sprinkled onion powder on top of them before they went in to bake. I used Panko breadcrumbs and they are as amazing as what others claim them to be. Crunchy and tasty. Thank you for the recipe! I will be using it for quite some time.

Teenage boys and husband all enjoyed. I stretched it by using thin sliced chicken breasts (2 vacuumed packs from a big box store large pack). Spread almost single layered in a 10x15 pan and I'm sure I used more of the cheeses than the recipe called for. I DID brown briefly first and only baked for 18 min. Quick and satisfying!

It was yummy but I think it might have been better if breasts had been pounded.  Company loved it though so happy with it but might pound next time around.  Used White Linen marinara which was perfect!

Made this a bit differently, I added rotini pasta on the bottom of the casserole,topped that with fire roasted diced tomatoes then added ingredients according to directions. My 9 year old is extremely picky about food and she approved this one, it's a keeper! Yummy

Super easy and I had no trouble tripling it for our small group dinner. The flavor from the croutons definitely made it taste like fried and coated chicken Parmesan.  I will make this again, definitely.

Very good!  We crushed the croutons before adding. Next time we make this dish, we would use 3 cups of Marina Sauce. It needed more sauce.

It is great! Easy to prepare and I know I will adding this meal to my favorites! I recommend it highly. The only thing I did different was that my jarred marinara sauce was 2 1/2 cups so I used the entire jar.

This is so easy and delicious! It is our favorite go-to meal... I honestly feel like we just count down the days until it's acceptable to put it back into rotation. We usually pair it with spaghetti squash to feel extra fancy - and it is an impressive meal for company!

We found this to be really good. However, I did omit the croutons since we aren't fans of them.  I baked the breasts for 45 minutes since they were a tad bit froze yet in the middle.  They came out moist and tender.  Super easy to put together.  Will be sure to do these again.

Loved it! I was a little skeptical about the croutons, but they were the best part! I used boneless chicken thighs instead and they were so moist and tender. My husband loved it and so did my 3 year old. Definitely will make this again. Yum!

I love Chef Johns recipes!!!  I watched the video and made this exactly as instructed.  It was just ok. All the cheese stuck to the croutons and the croutons became hard and unpalatable.  So we ended up with baked chicken in tomato sauce with basil.  I might try again using bread crumbs instead of croutons next time, only because my 8 yr old really loved it and she's the picky eater in the family.

This turned out pretty well.  The rating is due to a lack of crunchiness in the topping, but perhaps if I cooked it longer the croutons would have been crunchy.  I made a few changes--I only used 5 chicken breasts (and still fed myself and 6 kids).  I skipped the red pepper flakes, opting for ground black pepper.  There was no fresh basil so I had to make do with dried and also added some Italian seasoning.  I did crush the croutons in a bag before sprinkling on the top.  I only cooked this for 40 min since I had sliced the chicken in to strips.  We all enjoyed it and yes, I would make it again.

I reduced the number of servings as I was only using 2 chicken breasts. I pounded the chicken so it was of even thickness (about 1/2 inch).  As shown in the video, I did lightly brown the chicken that had been seasoned with salt and pepper and a little crushed red pepper,  in a little olive oil.  I added a little olive oil mixed with a small amount of the bottled organic pasta sauce, then placed the chicken pieces on top.  Spooned some of the sauce on each piece of chicken, then topped with some chopped fresh basil, oregano and minced garlic.  Added some of both cheeses, then placed in the pre-heated oven covered for 20 minutes.   Took it out of the oven, added some homemade garlic herb croutons (small sized) and topped with the remaining cheese.   Baked for an additional 15 minutes and until the cheese was melted and slightly browned.

I served this with a side dish of zucchini, onion, garlic and pasta sauce that had been simmered until the zucchini was crisp tender.

I enjoyed the flavors but thought the texture of the croutons with the chicken was off.  I would have preferred it if I had crushed the croutons instead of leaving them whole even though they were small.

Very tasty! The only change I made is that marinara sauce gives my husband heartburn, so on his half I used alfredo sauce, but we both loved our respective dishes - thanks for the yummy recipe!

Outstanding! 1 dish prep, I used the chicken tenders as well and added a little more cheese.. The garlic and red flake make the spicing easily variable and add just enough flavor. I crushed the croutons to about half their size and used the foil for added moisture.. 35 min bake time for me

I did add a sprinkle of Oregano between the gravy and the cheese.  I didn't have basil accessible to me, so that was my substitute. Otherwise, did everything the same.  Didn't crush the croutons, which I questioned if I should, but it was fabulous with them whole.

Thank you for this AWESOME recipe. Made it last night and we all loved it. I especially love how EASY it is to prepare. I will definitely be making this more often. So simple, delicious and a tad bit healthier than the traditional chicken parmesan!

This was nice and easy after a long week as I made it on Friday night!  My husband loved it and we both liked the crunchy topping on the chicken.  The only thing I would change is to cook is much less than 40 minutes as almost too dry.  I would try 20 minutes next time.

I pre-cooked the chicken on the skillet ~ 5 min.  Changes: I used dried basil and multiple cheeses (mozz, 4-cheese italian & parm).  Crushed up the croutons to top the chicken breast halves.  Then baked at 350 for 25 minutes (note to self: bake at lower temp next time - I overcooked the chicken a little).
This was pretty good.  thanks!

This recipe was soooo good. I took leftovers to work and people were barging into the break room to inquire about the garlicky wonderfulness coming from the microwave! Hmmm, I wonder if this will work with eggplant?

It's pretty tasty but I would pound the chicken a little thinner and crush the croutons into smaller pieces.  Overall it's a hit here in our home

Perfect quick and easy way to make chicken Parmesan and sooo delicious! This is something you need to eat the day it's made preferably because the croutons will get a bit soggy. But not bad for leftovers. I baked with foil covering the baking dish.

Husband and son loved it, even had second helpings. Used more fresh minced garlic and chili peppers on the bottom, and onion flakes, and garlic powder on the chicken. When serving added more marinara sauce and topped with a slice of provolone. Served with fresh broccoli, butter and salt & pepper. Yum!

I made this for dinner tonight; unfortunately it was not a big hit.  I followed the recipe as written and I have to admit it did smell wonderful while baking.  But to be honest this wasn't anything special.   No second helpings for anyone and that is nearly unheard of for my husband and son.

So easy. So fast.  A hit with my each member of my family.  It's so easy to double and share.  My favorite pasta sauce is Prego Traditional.  The croutons add such an easy, flavorful and crunchy topping.

This recipe is delicious and SO EASY!  You really just can't mess this up.  I used a little less chicken than the recipe calls for (not sure how you can fit 6 chicken breasts on the bottom of a 9x13 dish...) and a little more marinara sauce, and it turned out great.  I ended up baking for 45 minutes instead of 35, but I probably could have gotten away with just baking for 40.  The only I didn't like was that some of the croutons got a little soggy from sitting in the marinara sauce.  We ate this with plain linguini pasta.  I will definitely make this again!

This was okay...nothing outstanding.  I made this to recipe except for the croutons and I don't think it would have made any difference.  Maybe adding a can of Ro-tel to the marinara sauce would have added the punch it needed?  May try it this way if I ever make this dish again.

It was good but not great.  If I make it again, I'll put more seasonings directly on the chicken breasts and make sure the croutons stay on top.  Some got in the sauce and was soggy.  However, the chicken was very tender.

This is a HUGE hit in my house. The kids prefer the croutons soggy so I simply put them between two layers of sauce and VIOLA! (We also omit the red pepper flakes due to said children lol)

I made this with minimal changes.  Just added a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of the pan and covered it after 15 minutes of baking.  It was tasty enough but doesn't keep well enough so I doubt I will make it again since repeatable meals are what I am all about.

This is one of our new favorites. I scaled down the recipe to 2 servings (but used a whole clove of garlic), used my own leftover spaghetti sauce from the night before and the Italian croutons I had on hand.

EDIT for Novice cooking friends: I didn't measure cheese or time it. I used what I knew we'd like like and took it out when it began to brown.  I put more of the cheese on the chicken layer than the crouton layer, so that the croutons would have more crunch. I think the poor reviews came from people watching the video and trying to replicate everything so exactly.

This was wonderful! I made it tonight and every bit of it was quickly cleaned up by my family.  The only thing I did different was to make my own gluten free, low carb croutons ahead of time to use.  This is a keeper and I will definitely make it again.  The one thing I think I'll change next time though is to cut up the chicken into cubes. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed recipe exactly except used 4 larger Chicken breasts-maybe I sautéed them too long because they were a bit dry-also the croutons got really dark. Just ok.

This was fantastic! I made it exactly as the recipe was written. I used homemade marinara sauce. The only change I will make next time is to serve this over pasta. Very quick and easy to make!

This  was so quick and easy for a baked parmesan. I used a progresso tomato and basil and still added the chopped fresh basil anyway.  The variations for this recipe are infinite in respect to which sauce you use. Will definatly make this again with my own sauce as well as others. Cant wait to try it with one of Newmans Own marinara.

We really enjoyed this. It was quick and easy to make. I did alter a few things. Per others suggestions, I did pan fry the chicken in butter before adding it to the baking dish. I also put a little bit of sauce in the bottom of the dish and crushed up the croutons. I omitted the red pepper flakes to make it more appealing to my little ones, but if it was strictly for adults I probably would have added it. Overall it was a hit.

I made this last night for my husband and myself. I used more cheese than what it called for and I left out the crushed red peppers and opted for more garlic. I used oregano rather than basil and we both loved it! I think everyone is getting hung up on the name because it isn't fried and crunchy like chicken parmesan; however, It is a fabulous dish and a good alternative to spaghetti or lasagna. I will be making this again!

I thought the flavors were good, chicken was juicy and tender, but did not like the croutons on it. Maybe it was the ones I used as they were kind of big. Or, they would have been better crushed. I took as many off as I could when I reheated it. I think I prefer the regular chicken parm over this one.

I am saving this one for sure!  It was easy to make and a hit with everyone. I  really don't like having to go the extra effort (and more dirty dishes) of breading and frying up the chicken beforehand in typical chicken parmesan so this was PERFECT.  Delish!  I served it with noodles and for myself; spaghetti squash instead.

Definitely make again. Extremely easy. I sprayed bottom of glass baking dish with Pam, then spread my homemade sauce on bottom of baking dish. I browned the chicken first in olive oil, put in dish and put fresh basil on chicken after I covered cutlets with sauce. Baked 40 minutes.

Easy to make, absolutely delicious!  Wife is gluten sensitive, so omitted the croutons, but it was still fantastic.  Recommend you pound the chicken breasts to tenderize them.

This was a quick, easy recipe. I suggest using whatever brand of spaghetti sauce you prefer, as well as adjusting the spices according to your taste. I used more parmesan cheese than the recipe called for. I'll make this again. Great taste with very little effort.

Made this last night and the hubs declared it a keeper.  I used chicken tenders, didn't bother browning them, and baked for 35 minutes.  Next time I'll use more marinara.

This is the perfect super-easy replacement for traditional chicken parmesan.  The red pepper flakes add a spicy bite to each mouthful, while the garlic croutons give intermittent mouthfuls of savory crunch and sauce-drenched deliciousness.   I chose to slice my chicken breasts into tenderloin-sized pieces to allow for smaller servings to be taken.  The combination of cheeses layered between the chicken and croutons and for the topping was the perfect way to meld the whole dish into a hearty, satisfying main course that is quick to put together and got a "thumbs up" from everyone.  Paired with a green salad, this makes a great option for a week-night dinner.

We love this! My son loves chix parm and this is so much quicker, cuts down on the calories by not breading/frying. My changes: instead of croutons I use gluten free breadcrumbs (my daughter has Celiac disease) and with my mozzarella I added some provel, that's a St Louis thing :)

I watched the video before making this recipe.  Did everything the same except used chicken tenders instead of breasts.  It was FANTASTIC!  I highly recommend this recipe.  4 kids and 2 adults all gobbled it up!  A much simpler way to prepare chicken parm and very tasty!

This was really good.  I wish I would have watched the video first, however, because he browns the chicken first. If I would have done that it would not have had to bake as long.  Also, after 35 min I checked it and my croutons were almost burned but the chicken was not done.  I covered it and baked for 10 min longer and it was done. But the croutons would have tasted better if not almost burnt.  I will try this again though.

Omg.... Best recipe I've ever made. It's delicious ... I used more Parmesan cheese than mozerrella because it was what I had... I made fresh croutons...  I used spaghetti sauce and I cooked my chicken all the way on the stove and let it cooked in the oven maybe 15 minutes. This is by far my favorite recipe ??

I made a double batch of this recipe. One for my husband & me and one for my son & daughter-in-law. It was a hit! My son loves chicken Parmesan and this filled the bill. I used pasta sauce instead of marinara because that's what I had on hand. I also used Italian seasoned croutons instead of garlic. This will definitely became a "regular" at our house.

My family was not a fan of this recipe. The flavor was good but the croutons were mushy on the underside so the texture was really bad. We wanted to like it but it just didn't work for us.

This turned out really good but I made some changes:
Cut up the chicken breast into bite size pieces.  
I only had dried basil and cut that down to a little more than 3 tbsp. No croutons so I used 1/2 cup plus of Panko bread crumbs (I think that really set this dish off!) It did have some liquid on the bottom when it was done and think I'll maybe add some lasagna noodles first so it can soak it up.

I browned the chicken briefly before adding it to the baking dish. My family loved this recipe!

It was a tasty recipe. I used panko instead of croutons. Works just fine. I'll make this again as a weeknight meal as it is tasty and relatively healthy.

This was absolutely fabulous!  I cut the prep time by using store bought minced garlic & a store bought marinara sauce with sweet basil. So I didn't have to try to find fresh basil plus  have to chop it.   I used a combination of grated parmesan & shaved parmesan which added an extra melted crunch to the topping.  Would definitely make again.

I don't know what other people are saying. I loved this recipe!! The only change I would make is to put the croutons on top of the sauce before putting on the cheese instead of doing half cheese then croutons then the other half of the cheese. This is a great recipe for beginner cooks

Very easy and tasty. I made some changes, but since where I live we have no lo-fat mozzarella, I used lo-fat white cheese, ready tomato sauce but not marinara, seasoned croutons not necessarily garlic croutons and it still worked. Next time I want to add mushrooms and grated lo-fat yellow cheese. Good recipe.

I made this for dinner last night and it was fantastic. What an easy and tasty recipe! The only changes I made included doubling the garlic and skipping the croutons as I prefer less carbs. It was a delightful dish that I will definitely be adding to the rotation. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe! -Jill

The chicken breast at the bottom of the pan was undercooked, even though the two cheeses on top were overcooked. If I made this again, I would pre-cook the chicken first.

I was honestly skeptical about how "chicken parmy" this would taste, but after my first bite I was honestly shocked. Simple and delicious.  My wife and son loved it.

Good not great dinner. Doesn't replace chicken parmesan - croutons i used were a bit overpowering for the dish but in terms of flavor and made the dish too crunchy.

I made this for my family and my boy's teenager friends. Is was very easy to make and cleanup was quick. I served a salad and topped the salad with a version of Bruschetta that was awesome. The boys all had seconds! What a joy to cook something easy and delicious!

Family loved it!  Quick and easy --  my favorite part!  Next time I make it, I will probably season the chicken prior to baking it so the chicken would have a little more flavor.  It will be a "go-to" menu in my house!

Great flavors! A very simple easy DISH that allows the cook time to visit guest and impresses them with great food. This would be a great novice cook recipe and also a great DISH for a large group. Note that the additional details in the video are great embellishments to this dish. Thanks Chef Jon

This turned out much better than I thought it would!  After reading other reviews, I also put some of the marinara on the bottom of the dish, rather than the garlic.  I put the chicken down and seasoned with red pepper flakes and garlic, then layered the marinara and mozzarella.  I crushed up the croutons which made it easier to cover the dish and covered it with foil for the first 25 min of baking.  This took about 50 min to cook rather than 35 min but my chicken was fairly thick.  Delicious!

One of hubby's favorite meals!  I didn't change ingredients, but did change the method a little.  However, I only use 3 chicken breasts.   I cube the chicken.  I follow directions up to the sauce and first layer of cheeses, then bake for 20 minutes.  If it seems watery, I remove the water with my turkey baster.  I then put on the croutons, and the remaining cheese.  This keeps the croutons from getting soggy. Then bake another 15 minutes.

Hands down best chicken parmesan recipe!  It is much better to use fresh basil if you can.  I also made my own croutons with garlic oil (You could use butter and garlic powder).  I added some extra Colby jack cheese on top because I like it cheesy and that's the cheese I had on hand.  Now a regular at our house!

Very yummy! Be sure to watch the video, because it doesn't mention in the recipe you should put salt and pepper to taste on the chicken and pan fry it for a few minutes each side first. I think it helped :-) I crunched up the croutons and it actually made the top layer of cheese fall off. So next time I will stick to the recipe. Love this!

I am not the best cook so I love finding something easy to make.  I made this for my parents as well as my immediate family and it was delicious.  I will have to say 35 minutes was not long enough.  I would say an hour was about right to bake it.   I also think the next time I make it I will make my own sauce and try it with that.   The fact that it was so easy to make ahead and then to have it ready to throw in the oven was perfect.  I am going to make it for Christmas Eve.

I made it and would change a few things. I would season the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Also I would crush up the croutons and drizzle with a little Evoo... Otherwise it was easy and good.

I really enjoyed this recipe - and so did my entire family.  I made it just as is - except I used a jar of spaghetti sauce - since I didn't have any "marinara" sauce.  The only thing I will do different next time is add a little salt and pepper (or other seasoning salt) to the chicken before adding the remaining ingredients.

It was so EASY - and quick.  Glad to have a yummy, home cooked meal after a long day and several evening activities.

Thanks Chef John - you have definitely come through again!

I don't know why this recipe got so many negative reviews; I thought it was pretty good AND easy to make!  HOWEVER, definitely add the croutons and the cheese after baking, and then broil it for about 10 minutes as other people have stated.  I used chicken tenders too so 35 minutes of baking was fine.  I might cut my chicken up into bite sized cubes next time just to make it easier to eat!  Overall, it was easy, tasted pretty good, and I'll definitely make it again!

The only change that I made was to cut the chicken breasts in half to reduce the cooking time.  The chicken was flavorful, tender and juicy.  I served it with a side of spaghetti.  I will definitely be making it again.

Very good! I cooked the spaghetti separate. The dish did not have enough sauce for a full pound of spaghetti, so next time i'll add 2 jars or have some sauce on the side. Flavor was VERY good though, everyone liked it. The crushed garlic croutons were definitely the thing that makes this dish stand out compared to classic chicken parms. Great for pot lucks- will make again. Thanks for sharing.

It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. Don't follow the helpful tip about foil.  Foil makes the croutons soggy and gross. I was really excited about this recipe, but sadly it wasn't a hit in our house.

I added about 1 cup more cheese and substituted a jar of spaghetti sauce.  After cooking, I cut the breasts in half and served with whole what spaghetti.  Our family LOVED this dish!

I loved it but can only give 4 stars because I made two changes:  I added sliced mushrooms and didn't have croutons so I sprinkled panko crumbs on top.  The panko crumbs came out very crunchy and I will continue to make this dish with the panko because it adds the crunch that I like but without the bulk of the croutons.

Super easy and the kids really liked it.  Its does not compare to real chicken parmesan but if you are looking for something simple and tasty this does the job.  Croutons on the top really worked pretty well but next time I would skip the Garlic variety.  To me it added a bit of an strange taste.

THIS WAS DELICIOUS!  I followed this recipe to a "t" ; used prego traditional sauce, and added a little oregano.  Everyone at my dinner party raved about this dish.  Highly recommended!

This was a very tasty dish.  Hubby and I both like it.  I didn't read the recipe right and used grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese instead of plain parmesan cheese.  It turned out great!  I will definitely have to share this one with family and friends.

Very easy to make and tasted delicious -- would make a couple of changes next time.  I would crush up the croutons a bit and sprinkle a few table spoons of sauce over them before adding the last of cheese.  The croutons were super crunchy and chunky . . .this would have been a bit more parm like and easier to eat if the croutons were smaller and some were softer.  I used 1lb of chicken breast tenders, a jar of Paul Newman plain marinara, Italian seasoned croutons, and dried basil  . . . tasted great.  Because I used tenders . . . I only needed to bake for 35 minutes.  I also added a bit of garlic powder, pepper and salt to the tenders before adding sauce.   Looking forward to making again.

I'll definitely make again.  I didn't have any croutons so I just used breadcrumbs instead.  I also sprinkled a bit of garlic salt on top because the croutons were supposed to be garlic, but my breadcrumbs were plain.  This will enter our chicken rotation as it's good and easy.

I follow and try all of Chef John's recipes and he never lets me down. This recipe was by far the best ever (I did make my own Marinara sauce). My husband told me this was by far restaurant quality or better.  As my husband said "this is a keeper" and it is the best Chicken Parmesan I've ever made. Thank you

Perfection!! I used a tuscan flavored olive oil in the bottom. I used a whole jar of sauce - why not - you only live once! I seasoned the chicken on the one side before I poured on the sauce. I sprinkled the chicken with dried oregano, dried basil and garlic salt. I didn't have any fresh basil. Those spices really added a depth of flavor. Everything else was the same, except for one more sprinkle of dried oregano across the top cheese layer. We fell in love! Important to not use super fat breasts - I used regular-sized breasts. Made a big difference in the final product. If your breast are huge (tee hee), you might want to cut them in half to make them skinnier. Enjoy!

Made two Sundays in a row.  Didn't brown the breasts in advance, we like them moister and I'm trying to cut fat.  I sliced them into pieces, followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. Served with a side of spaghetti to sop up the extra sauce.  The croutons are genius!  It's not as good reheated, since you lose the crunch of the croutons, but there were very little leftovers both times. This one is a keeper.

My family and i loved this recipe! I did make a couple of tweeks though.........i sprayed the baking dish with PAM instead of using oil and i sprinkled it with garlic powder instead of the chopped garlic (mostly cause i was too lazy that day to chop garlic!). I had to bake it for about 45 mins for the chicken to be done and by then the cheese was really hard and the croutons had started to burn but it still had an awesome flavor.  When i make this again (and i DEFINITELY will) before i add the cheese and croutons i will bake the dish about half way then add the cheese and croutons. All in all........awesome recipe and super quick to make!!

This was really good. I did not watch the video; I just followed the directions which I thought was easy enough. I actually like this better than traditional chicken parm because the traditional has too much breading for my taste. Use quality ingredients and this will make a fabulous, quick-and-easy weeknight meal.

I rarely follow recipes but I followed this one because I didn't have time not to. It was really good. I was skeptical about the croutons but used them anyway.  They were great. My entire family lived it and I will make this again.

I made this and it was great!  The only thing I did different was crush the croutons in a food processor.  I reserved a few crushed croutons to sprinkle on top, also.  Gave it a light toasty crunch to the finished product.  The family enjoyed and I will definitely make it again.

Good.  Made as written.  Six breasts was too many after pounding thin.  The thinner the better.  I cooked for 45 mins.  It was a little too long.  Husband said it tastes just like regular chicken parm.

This is good but could use some extra spices; I'm not exactly sure what yet, so I'll have to play with this recipe a little bit in the future.

This recipe is perfect for a quick night meal!  It is so easy to put together. I've made this at least 4 times.  My 7 yr old son who is a picky eater loves it.
This one is a keeper for my household!

Tastes great, (even better 2nd day) easy to layer, good for potluck!  The breasts cover the pan and then just a couple of layers and you are ready for the oven.  Once cooked can be cut into individual servings, maybe 12 or so.  The fresh basil and a good quality marinara make the dish!

I made this recipe as is, although I did break up the croutons a bit. I ended up cooking mine almost an hour, with it covered the first half hour. Came out perfect! So very tasty. I may have had just a touch more garlic, but not by much. Just the right amount. The marinara sauce will make or break this recipe, so make sure you get one you like and don't skimp! Oh yes, I used a whole 24 oz. jar, my husband said It still needed a bit more for the fettuccine noodles I served with it. But I don't think I'll put it in the chicken. Hubby & very picky 8-year-old loved it!

Followed the frictions exactly and the chicken was raw. Cooked for another 45 minutes, and it was just okay.

I did not watch the video but just went off the recipe (minus the croutons and red pepper flakes because IMO that doesn't sound good). With such few ingredients this dish requires high quality ingredients. Fresh basil, good quality parmesan,  good mozzarella and a good sauce and you really can't go wrong. If you do, then there is something wrong with your ingredients. Extremely simple to make, tasted good, and is a dish that the family has asked me to make again in the future.

So...I am not sure about this. I didn't realize there was a video, and I watched it after. I did actually prepare it correctly though, just as the video directed. I had thought I didn't do correctly because the croutons were so soft. I didn't sample directly, because I am vegetarian, but asked my family who did eat. 4 stars because they did like the taste; so, maybe I will try again. I actually used 15 oz of sauce vs. the 16 oz in recipe...I'll try reducing just a bit to see if it makes the croutons less soggy. We love chicken parmesan normally so I'd like to make it work, as I have never thought of using croutons.

Everyone loved it!!  I might try to use this as a crock pot recipe, adding the last layer of croutons and cheese just before serving so they will stay crunchy.  Also, because I'm also looking for any opportunity I can find to put vegies into a meal,  I might try to add a layer of spinach leaves into the recipe. I'll let you know how that goes.

Made this by the recipe. Used chicken tenders and browned them before putting them in the casserole. Family thought it was just okay. Other than the heat from the pepper flakes it was pretty bland. Couldn't put my finger on what was missing but it needed more flavor. Might try again.  Will keep looking for another recipe.

Once again chef John has a terrific recipe. I made this for my family and it was voted a keeper. This is a great recipe for a working parent. It requires common ingredients and is a breeze to put together. Definitely one to be repeated.

This was a very good dish.  I liked the flavor, but it was a little dry for my liking.  I wish there would have maybe been some pasta incorporated into the dish to make it a one dish dinner.

Love this recipe!  Even my 5 1/2 year old, whom has become a picky eater, loved it and even had seconds.  The only thing I changed was a little less sauce and cheese, but other than that this meal will definitely be made over and over in my kitchen.  Thanks.

I loved this recipe but I altered it. Here it goes...
I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, olive oil, fresh garlic and salt for about three hours. Used my favorite jar sauce without any added ingredients. When the croutons peeking out of the cheese started to get too brown I covered it with foil. Cooked for 45 minutes total. Was amazing. I cannot wait to make this again. So easy.....

We made this in Tuscany, Italy and yes made changes because we worked with ingredients available. Used pecorino and Parmesan. Chopped up crusty stale italian bread for croutons. Was a big hit.

Absolutely delicious.  My family loved it.  It took an hour and a half to cook as the chicken breasts were thick.  The only change I would make is to cover the chicken for the first 45 minutes and uncover for the last because the top got overdone.  However, it was still wonderful.  Will make this a regular in our home as its so easy to make!

I cut the chicken into 1/2 or 1/3 depending on the size of the breasts.  This made it a bit easier to serve.  Very delicious!  Fool proof and healthy!

!!! That was good. So good! I seared the chicken and used fresh parm and Rao's Arabiatta sauce (I think the trick is quality sauce. Are you naysayers using Ragu or what?). The basil really popped and this had so much flavor! I couldn't find smaller-size croutons, but it still worked. I've already told everyone I know about this recipe. Thanks!

Yummy!  I would use more sauce next time.  I put sauce on the bottom and just salt and peppered the chicken breasts, no pan frying.  Served with pasta.  Smashing the croutons is necessary as well.  I only used 1/2 the bag and baked only 4 breasts.  Used TJs organic basil marinara.

I followed the recipe exactly for this but didn't have fresh basil so omitted it.  (It was also omitted in the video).  I thought it was pretty good and came together fast, but I couldn't really get past the fact that I was eating a bunch of croutons.  The chicken breasts I had were pretty thick so I did end up cutting them up into large pieces and that worked out well.  It's worth it to get real fresh mozzarella for this instead of the stuff in the bag.  Will probably make again but only once in a while.

Wonderful!  I did use some tips from other reviewers, sliced the breasts across as these were very large, then I marinated them in a mix of basil infused EVOO Italian seasoning and balsamic vinegar.  Didn't bother to seer them.  Didn't have the red pepper flakes but I added some minced roasted garlic on top of the prepared glass pan before adding a little sauce, then the chicken, sauce, a bit of smoked paprika, the cheeses.  I typically buy the large restaurant size croutons, so I did use a rolling pin to crush them down in size while still leaving chunks.  I decided to use convection baking until the sauce was bubbling, added the remaining cheeses and baked another 10 minutes.  Total baking time was 30 min.  My husband kept asking how long until dinner as he said it smelled GREAT!  This was SO moist and flavorful, I will use again for us, but it's going to be a company dish as well!  THANKS Chef John, and other reviewers!

I made this the other night and my family really liked it.  I used all the same ingredients in the recipe (I made my own marinara sauce), but I just eyeballed and didn't measure anything exactly.  I did use more mozzarella because my family really loves cheese.  The only other think I did that was a little different from the recipe was sprinkle garlic powder and a little black pepper on the cutlets instead of on the bottom of the Pyrex and I omitted the crushed red pepper.  I also crushed the croutons.  It was super easy and very tasty.  However, keep in mind, this is not chicken parmagiana, but it is easier and yummy.  Thanks for sharing.

Sorry but the crouton topping just did not make it at all as a chicken parm dish.  There was so much topping on the chicken, it was hard to find in the dish.

I made this just the way it said.  It was ok. Putting the garlic and red pepper on the bottom seems to be a waste of seasonings, as you really don't taste them. (The house did smell of roasting garlic while it was in the oven.)  The croutons were just weird, a very odd crunchy bite in the middle of the chicken.  If you do make it, be prepared to eat it all the first night.  The croutons soak up the sauce and become nasty, soggy bread lumps when leftover.  It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't great, and definitely not the "Best".

After reading all the bad reviews, I decided to make this anyway.  It was a decent dish I thought.  I liked the addition of the croutons as some got crunchy and some got mushy... very much like a chicken parm hero would be.  My advice would be to get croutons that aren't too salty.  I cut my chicken breast in half to make serving easier.  I would make again.

Pretty nice. Needs small croutons for best effect. Chicken itself was a little bland. Maybe try marinated Italian Breasts next time.

So this is not chicken parm but it is a great & easy meal. I made NO changes except for using thighs instead of breasts. And it was delicious. We will definitely be having this again.

Absolutely delicious. My family loved it, a put crushed garlic on the bottom like Chef John suggested along with the crushed red pepper.  I also sprinkled oregano on top of the sauce to jazz it up a little.  Either way it was fabulous. Thanks All Recipes for another great one..

This is seriously so simple. I even had to re-read the recipe to make sure I had not forgotten any steps because it was that simple. There is a new video out from Chef John that updates this recipe a teeny bit which includes cooking the chicken for a few minutes on both sides to get a yummy golden crust. I was lazy and didn't feel like doing that, so I threw the breasts in raw. I used canned tomato sauce (again, lazy), and didn't have any fresh basil, so I used basil olive oil across the bottom of the casserole dish as well as drizzled a little across the top of the chicken before spreading the tomato sauce. I did season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and a little bit of garlic powder before dousing them in tomato sauce, but the rest of the recipe stayed true (with the exception of the missing basil). Mine cooked for about 50 minutes and it was perfectly done. One dish wonder. Who would have thought to use croutons for the "breading?" Chef John. My husband said "this is amazing." In our house, nothing exceeds "pretty good." This will most definitely be going into the regular rotation in our house!

the base is there and you can do so much to ad to this to make it better!  I made my own sauce with tomatoes from my garden, fresh basil and egg/breaded my chicken and pan seared it for a min/side first to make it crunchy....
recipies are not written in stone...use your imagination to make it yours.

made this last night for dinner & eating leftovers right now for lunch.  Warmed up very good.  I used a whole Sam's size bag of chicken tenderloins thawed.Spread some spaghetti sauce on bottom of pan (will use aluminum foil next time) and poured chicken over top.  Sprinkled with garlic powder & basil then poured rest of sauce on top.  I used almost a whole big jar of sauce and we actually had to add more to our spaghetti on the side (I'm assuming it's bc I used way more chicken).  I covered with cheese & Parmesan and croutons (which I broke in half) & then more cheese.  Didn't quite use the whole bag of cheese.  Cooked about 35 min covered then broiled a few minutes at the end (I was worried about the croutons burning as others mentioned).  Everything was delicious - 13 yr old loved it.  Served with zoodles for adults (spiralized zuchinni  "noodles") & spaghetti for the kiddos

I thought this was great. I wanted chicken parm, but instead of making the whole casserole, I just did a small version with one very large chicken breast. I followed the recipe, but I didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic powder. It still turned out great. I was a little skeptical about adding the croutons, but it was good. They softened as they baked and added flavor and texture. I will definitely make this again.

Easy and delicious!! This might be my go to dish for company and church meals. Besides the basil I added just a little Italian seasoning. Skipped the red pepper this time. I did cut up my chicken breast and precooked it approximately 15 minutes, wasn't thawed completely.

Soooo fantastic as is! Hubby says it's a keeper and rarely says that. Red pepper flakes are a must, to add that special something different.  I did crush some extra garlic, but I didn't brown the chicken and it turned out absolutely yummy!! Served with angel hair pasta and wala! I made this a second time and baked it without covering it which dried it out too much. I recommend to definitely cover it at least for the first 1/2 of the cook time, then take cover off towards the end to brown the croutons.

Some of the croutons turned to mush, lacked of flavor. The parm baked to a crisp on top, chicken was tasteless, dry rubbery.

Even my picky 14 yo and 11 yo daughters loved it!  I added sliced raw mushrooms to it.  Placed them on top of the raw chicken.  I also substituted Italian Seasoned Breadcrumbs for the croutons because it was what I had on hand.  This is a definite winner!  AND---nice enough for company!

We loved it. We didn't add any pepper flakes, used only the garlic in the bottom of the pan. I crushed up the croutons as I saw suggested in another review. This will be going in my winter menu rotation.

I seasoned the chicken breasts and seared on both sides in olive oil. Added water to fry pan and cooked down. Poured juice over chicken to help keep juicy. Followed directions as indicated. Cooked for 45 mins. And it was perfect! We loved it.

Made as directed but used seasoned salt on chicken prior to assembly.  The dish was flavorful and my picky family liked it which is a top priority for this busy mom.  Only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is due to sogginess of some croutons.

I loved this the only thing I would change is the flavor of croutons. I used garlic and it might have been too much next time I will try a different flavor !!!

I guess I'm a chicken parm snob!  I felt this was very plain and really lacked flavor vs a breaded parm.  And, we both thought the croutons were a very odd addition.

Quick, easy and delicious!  I pounded three large chicken breasts to thin them and shorten cooking time.  Kroger Private Selection Spicy Marinara is perfect in this.

I used chicken tenderloins and grated (not shredded) parmesan cheese. It was delicious. Though, next time I'll cut up the tenderloins into bitesize pieces.

Wow. I have made some great chicken parm in my day, and this one is right up there! I used boneless, skinless breasts, and did not cut them or pound them to thin them out.  I used my family's fave sauce, Bartoli Organic garlic and olive oil. I did not have croutons, so I used breadcrumbs between the layers of cheese. I baked it for 50 minutes. 
Thus was delicious and much easier without breaking and frying. It did NOT lose anything in taste or presentation. A must make!!

This is so easy, simple and just tastes great.  It's a family favorite. I rarely have real garlic or basil, but dried works just as well.

I wanted to make a chicken bake that didn't require preparing the chicken and this was perfect. I didn't have all the ingredients at home to I swapped some out. I used garlic powder, very little red pepper, and McCormicks roasted garlic and herb seasoning for the base. Instead of mozzarella I used provolone and made my own croutons with breaking pieces of bread. I baked for 45 minutes. This is now one of my favorites!!

This is good for a weeknight dinner as it comes together fast. I seasoned the chicken with black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, basil and oregano then seared for a couple minutes on each side. I then proceeded with the sauce, parmesan cheese, Italian cheese blend and croutons, I covered with foil so the croutons would not be rock hard. I served with vermicilli that I tossed with butter, garlic and parmesan cheese and a salad. Making it in the one pan cut down on dishes and I think gave the chicken a nicer flavour, I am not a fan of putting raw chicken in a sauce it reminds me of the soup casseroles that I don't like either.

This is such a great recipe, delicious!  I cut the chicken breasts in half (or thirds if it was a huge one) and browned and seasoned them with garlic powder, italian seasoning and a little seasoning salt before adding to the baking dish.  I used three cloves of garlic and crushed up a mixture of garlic butter and garlic cheese croutons to sprinkle over the top.  Cooked for about 40 minutes and the chicken came out perfectly cooked and so juicy.  Yum, the whole family loved it.

Very tasty and easy. This took ~45 mins in my oven. I cut up the chicken into small pieces and served over spaghetti with extra marinara and with a side of garlic bread. Make sure to pick a marinara sauce that isn't too sweet if that is your preference.

This was very good. I browned the breasts as shown in the video. I would only tweak things a little next time. I would slice the breasts in half or pound them thinner because the best bites were the ones that had a fairly even balance of topping to chicken breast. I also had large croutons so I broke them up some before adding them to the dish, and I think it would be even better if I crushed them more next time - not completely crushed into bread crumbs, but crumbly with some chunks so it's easier to get them spread evenly over the breasts.

My family loves chicken parm, but I certainly do not love the work of breading and cooking the cutlets.  When we want a quick version for a weeknight dinner, I've been making just chicken baked with sauce and cheese.  So tonight I decided to try this version, and everyone gave it an enthusiastic thumbs up. I used garlic and cheese croutons, just the store brand.  It is true that after they bake and soak up some sauce, you can cut up your piece of chicken, and take a forkful of chicken plus some of the baked croutons, and you get a flavor of breaded chicken parm. So this simple addition to my quick meal worked out very well for us.  
I didn't give it the full 5 stars only because it really isn't "the real deal", and there was some unevenness in the outcome of my crouton layer - some had taken up sauce and were tasty, but others hadn't really gotten any sauce.  So to get the desired flavor you need to cut up and stir things around to mix the chicken, sauce and croutons together. 
We'll definitely make this again, and maybe with some repeat experience with it, I'll get more consistent texture throughout.

Great recipe family really enjoyed it. The only things I will do different next time is crush up the croutons a little and cook the garlic just a bit to remove some of the heaviness of the raw garlic.

I was so disappointed.  I went and bought quality croutons and the chicken pieces all the same size as suggested. I baked the dish for 35 min. and with the meat thermometer it was registering at 140 increased the cooking time to 10 more minutes and the croutons burned a little.  The dish tasted to salty and the crouton and chees topping didn't mesh.  It kept separating with every bite.

I have made this with both fresh ingredients (homemade marinara, fresh basil etc) and with prepared items (caned sauce, dried basil) and both ways are delicious. Plus it doesn't take long to prep so its a go to recipe.

Followed the recipe as written. It not only looked great, it tasted fabulous. Jeff John - I love your flavors. This is the second of your recipes I have made ( the other was your Hungarian goulash).  Both were a hit in my house.  I love cooking when the outcome is even better than what I was expecting. Thank you.

Loved this! I did brown the chicken slightly and crush up the croutons per a few suggestions, but otherwise just threw it together and it was DELICIOUS. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because my chicken was a bit chewy but I think thats because I used frozen chicken instead of fresh. Otherwise this was FANTASTIC!

My husband and I thought this recipe was great as written. I might crumble my croutons a little next time because I was never sure if I was biting into a crouton or a piece of chicken until it was in my mouth! Definitely a keeper and easier than the 'real thing' (chicken parm).

I wasn't sure if I was going to like croutons in this (I'm a chicken parmesan purist!) but the idea of no breading and frying intrigued me.  I'm glad I tried it!  It was super easy to make and everyone loved it so it'll go into the rotation.  I'll still make traditional chicken parm when I have time but this is perfect for a weeknight dinner!  Thanks chef John!

I stayed true to this recipe and was frustrated because I had problems with getting my chicken done. I didn't serve it right away because I pulled the chicken out at 160 like the video said and it still didn't get done so then I needed to microwave the individual chicken breasts The cheese turned leathery and the croutons were too hard. I believe that probably I'm mostly to blame for the complications . I am going to try it again But with changes. I am going to slice the breasts into strips and use fewer croutons. More then likely I will leave the cheese and croutons  off until the last 15 min of cooking. I give it 4 stars because the flavor was worth making this recipe work for my family

This was good.  The croutons and cheese formed this delicious crusty layer, though it didn't stick to the chicken at all. I bought Texas Toast brand croutons which are bigger than other croutons and the larger size made it more difficult to eat.  Next time, I'll look for a smaller crouton and use a smaller pan too; 9 x 13 was a bit large.

Made it nearly exactly as written. I omitted the red pepper flakes because I don't like my food spicy at all. It was definitely easy...so based solely on that I'd give it a higher rating. However it was just ok. Not a bad recipe, but not one I'll make again. My husband seemed to like it but none of my three kids would eat it. I had cut my chicken into large bite sized cubes to make it easier for the kiddos to eat and to simplify serving. It baked about 40 minutes and that was plenty of time. The croutons were soggy on bottom and crispy on top, which really bugged my kids. I should have just kept the croutons off, cooked up spaghetti, then used the sauce over spaghetti and let the kids top it with the croutons. I think it would have better received.

Super easy and very good.  Didn't have fresh basil.  Everyone liked it a lot.  Second time had fresh basil from pot outside.  Bone in took about an hour to cook.  Really good with the fresh basil.  This is a family favorite.  Love Chef Johns recipes!!!

Prepared this to the exact recipe as stated and maybe it's just me and my taste buds but I wasn't impressed at all. I didn't enjoy the flavor and the chicken itself seemed slightly rubbery. I'm an experienced cook so I know it wasn't about not cooking it long enough.  My husband actually liked it but, for me, this recipe isn't good enough for an encore. Wish I could give it a higher rating, I really do!  Maybe I'm just more of a traditionalist when it comes to Chicken Parmesan.

I made this last night, and the whole family enjoyed it. This will go into my rotation as one of my easy, convenient suppers that I know my family will eat. There are few ingredients,and it's super quick and very tasty. It's "homey" comfort food like baked ziti or something like that. Serve over healthy, whole grain pasta with a nice, green salad. If you use quality chicken and your favorite pasta sauce, I don't see how you could go wrong.

First understand this is not regular parmesan chicken. I used Hunt's pasta sauce with roasted garlic and instead of parmesaan cheese I used Pepper Jack with red and green jalepenos.  We like spicy.  It was delicious and everyone enjoyed.   Oh yeah I mashed the croutons into smaller pieces and added some of the pasta sauce on top.

I watched the video, but really didn't need to. The recipe was easy to follow. The entire family loved this. We will be making this again/ I baked mine for 50 minutes and it turned out perfect! Thanks Chef John!

we loved this meal.  Easy to cook and taste great.  The only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 was because there seemed to be more croutons and topping versus chicken.  I know i could add more, and next time i might try dicing up the chicken.  Great taste!

I halved the recipe with three breasts and a 9x9 dish, but otherwise followed it exactly.  I thought the breasts I used were thick, so I baked it for 45 minutes.  The chicken was a little overdone, so I will try 35 next time.  A whole breast is too big for one serving, so I will also cut them into large chunks.  I used Texas Toast garlic croutons, and they were really good, but I will crush them a little next time.  I used Newman's Own Tomato and Basil, which was awesome.  Real parmesan chicken is a lot of work for a novice like me, so this is an easy way to get a similar flavor and texture.

I found this absolutely delicious.  What could be easier?  Yes, mine took 15 minutes longer to cook, but that depends on oven and size of chicken breasts.  Hands down, this was a great, easy flavourful dish!

Made this as written and my family loved it.  I used the recipe on this site for Best Marinara Sauce Yet.  Next time I will probably use more sauce.  I served it over thin spaghetti and my husband likes alot of sauce.

Tried this recipe tonight. The croutons burned. I had turned the heat up like I had read in many of the reviews but I found that to be a mistake. I turned the temp back to 350* and finished the back. Taste was fabulous. I guess I would say, always remember, all stoves are not the same.

I like the ease of preparing this tasty dish, but we wouldn’t call it a chicken parm.  It was very good though and ideal for a busy day.

We really liked this dish. My daughter gave it two thumbs up, I can't remember last time that happened to a new dish. Had to cook it closer to an hour for the chicken to be fully cooked though, which burnt the crutons. I will definately follow the advice here and brown the chicken first next time. Except for that it was excellent.

Loved! Super easy, didn't bother measuring anything. I followed what some other reviewers did by putting sauce under and on top of the chicken, seasoned and browned the chicken, and crushing up the croutons. The only other thing I would. Do is try baking without the croutons and cheeses and waiting until the last few minutes to put them on to brown, just because the croutons were slightly soggy.

I watched the video and was so excited to make it. It was easy to make but the croutons underneath were mushy! The cheese was over-cooked yet I had to keep cooking it to make sure the chicken was cooked thoroughly.

It was very easy to make and the butter/garlic croutons I used added a nice crunchy touch. I will add more sauce next time maybe 3 cups but the recipe as is was delicious provided you use thin chicken breasts. I used 5. I also cut back on the mozarella/parmesan cheese and served it on top of whole wheat spaghetti pasta with green beans and  texas toast garlic bread on the side. It was plenty for a party of four!

We loved this simple, flavorful recipe. As we did not have fresh basil on hand, we used a generous sprinkling of dried basil. We will definitely make this again. Next fall when my husband asks if I want to pot up the basil and bring it inside as we put our vegetable garden to bed, the answer will be a resounding yes. Thanks, Chef John!

I liked this, but my family thought it was so-so. I liked how it was all together in one pan and very simple, great for a busy week night. I did add more red pepper and garlic (love both) and served noodles on the side for the kids.

The chicken needs to cook longer.  I had Tyson chicken breasts that I bought from Wal-mart.. They were thick and one of them did not get done.
The croutons were in bad shape...dark brown.  I have a electric oven and used the speed bake setting...this might have caused the croutons to be in such poor shape.  My wife told me not to make the recipe again.

It was okay.  The croutons burnt, making it look less than desirable.  The taste was good.

Sooo!  Good!   The combination of the croutons being crunchy on the top and soaking up all the goodness on the bottom was the best.  My recommendation though, is to not use the cheicken breasts that are cheap and have a bunch of water or juices infused with them.  That stuff ends up cooking out of the meat and watering down the sauce.  Use real chicken breasts.

Made this for 2 picky boys and they both said it was very good! I did exactly what it said- the only thing different was I used spaghetti sauce as I didnt have marina sauce on hand. Plus we love garlic so when I was preparing the chicken I had added extra garlic and my seasonings on the chicken as well as in the dish.  It sure is a keeper!

My family loved it.  Next time I plan to use smaller croutons.  I think the ones I used were too big.  I plan to use more mozzrella cheese too.  We're cheese lovers.

Delicious! The thought of cooking usually intimidates me, especially when cooking for extremely picky eaters. But this dish was so simple and had such great reviews I had to try it! Everyone loved it! I cooked mine for about 45 minutes and came out perfect.

This receipt was great!  I made it exactly as stated and my husband asked for thirds - that NEVER happens!  My daughter and grandson had leftovers and couldn't eat fast enough.  I gave her the receipt to take home.  I think the croutons make the whole thing.  Easy and awesome - thanks for sharing.

I liked the topping, but don't like chicken.
Any suggestions what I could use in place of chicken?

This was easy to make, but the croutons get too soggy and taste a bit mushy.
