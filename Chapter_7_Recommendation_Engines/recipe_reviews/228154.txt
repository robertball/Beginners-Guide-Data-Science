The onion I used was a sweet onion. I did toss a touch of crushed red pepper flake into this sauce with the salt/fresh ground pepper. That was the only change I made. I tossed this sauce with hot fettuccini noodles. My family has fallen in love with this sauce--I really should have doubled it because everyone was bummed there were no leftovers. This is one of THE BEST "alfredo" sauces we've had in a LONG time.

I made this recipe for my family and they loved it. My husband can't stop raving about this recipe. I added the half and half to the blender with the mushrooms, onions and garlic to make it easier to puree the veggies. I will be making this recipe often. Thank you.

Tasty base recipe.  The garlic was really overpowering!  I added more mushrooms to try and mute the garlic.  I did also sneak in a couple additional veggies into the blender.  The kids ate it and had no idea that they were eating healthy.   I'll make it again but with half the garlic.

I didn't get much out of sauteeing the mushroom paste in butter, but I also cooked this meal pretty quickly and perhaps didn't give this step the proper attention. 
The result was still very good, and I'll likely make it again.

4 cloves garlic is too much. I also added parsley and lots of milk til it was at the right consistency. I think a pinch of paprika would be great too. Lovely recipe! We made it for Christmas dinner over fettuccine and shrimp.

It had a nice mushroom taste but as it cooled all it tasted like was cheese, but that was fine the problem I had was that it turned out to thick and turned into a giant sauce blob.

This is delicious!  Cut everything by half except mushrooms and cheese. Used portobello mushrooms and cornstarch instead of flour. No need for so much butter, I used 4 tsp instead of 4 Tbsp. Will definitely make again! Enjoy...

I have done this many times and it is delicious!  With relatively easy steps it was like eating at a restaurant (and I'm not a great cook). Goes well with a dirty martini! ;)

Sorry, but this is a no-go.  The directions can't be followed since, for starters, in a regular blender, those vegetables aren't going to budge ... I ended up with a stringy, non-alfredo-tasting mushroom paste.  :/

This sauce is amazing! I literally wanted to bathe in it. It was difficult to stop myself from eating it by the spoonful! I wouldn't change a thing.

Easy, excellent dish!! I added extra garlic and sliced about 6 of the mushrooms; added them with the half  and half and let sauce simmer until mushrooms were softened. Also used fresh fettuccine. The dish s a keeper!!

I didn't love this as much as the previous reviewers.  In fact, I'd have given it "3" stars for "ok", but Mr. LTH (unsolicitedly) commented he enjoyed it, so that bumps it up to "4".  To me, it was kind of bland.  It had a nice earthy flavor, but still a bit bland; I found myself really enjoying the bites w/the fresh parm I'd added to the top.  I couldn't get the mushrooms/onions/garlic to puree in my blender w/out adding some liquid, so I added some of the pasta water.  THANKS for the recipe, evilcookie007!
