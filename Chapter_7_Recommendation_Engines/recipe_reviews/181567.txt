Do NOT believe that these are easier than buckeyes to make!  The proportions are way off, making these cookies extremely messy.  The chocolate mixture in step 3 was more like a sauce, and after trying to harden it for over 2 hours (I even put it in the freezer) I gave up and trashed it.  Overall, this is not nearly as good as a buckeye and takes a huge commitment for something that should have been a breeze.

These are very good.The first batch I made the cookie mix came out a bit dry.The next batch I made with an extra egg and I sweetened it with 1/2 cup powdered sugar.It was alot more chewy like a brownie.To make the indent inside the cookie dough,I used the back of a wooden spoon and pushed in and made a circular motion to open it up for the filling.Very good!

I didn't really know how to rate these because I didin't exactly follow the recipe.  I made these into a really easy version on Martha Stewarts Peanut butter surprise cookies (which are delicious but time consuming).  So - I made the chocolate cookie dough as stated and made the PB filling as stated.  I took 2 walnut size dough balls - flattend them out then sandwiched a ball of PB in between the 2 chocolates and pinched closed.
Yummy!

A friend of mine made these tonight for a Christmas party.  They were amazing!!!  One of the best desserts I've ever had!  She said they were a lot easier to make than buckeyes.
