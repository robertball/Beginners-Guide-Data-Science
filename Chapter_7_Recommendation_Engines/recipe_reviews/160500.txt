Super yummy! Saw a couple posts about these being bland. I added about a 1/2 tsp or so of seasoning salt about a 1/4 cup of Panko and used 1/4 cup dehydrated onions instead of the fresh onion and they tasted awesome! Definitely not tasteless. Wonderful for a relaxing Sunday brunch!

I doubled the recipe for my family of five and they ate the entire thing. Instead of green onions I cooked a chopped yellow onion to golden brown. I also cooked the bacon first before chopping - too difficult the other way. Added salt and pepper to the batter. I served these with corned beef along with sour cream and sauerkraut

These are so good and tasty I add a wee bit of dehydrated onion to it. The only issue I have is I can't finish one! They are so filling like really. I had 3/4 of one at brunch and I am good for the day. My son asks for these every other Sunday.

Our version is an OLD family recipe from waaay back. It's been adjusted over time - like switching to bisquick when it became available - but other than one ingredient left out and one ingredient used completely rather than discarded it's the same. We've never used the cheese in ours which is the one removed ingredient but I learned this recipe from Mom aaaaages ago. We actually mix the grilled onion bits into the mix too - that's the ingredient competely used rather than discarded - and we use a bisquick-type mix instead of the flour etc. but it's basically the same dish. We LOVE to use leftover boiled or baked potatoes and just hash them into the rest of the already mixed batter & then mix in the onion too. Cook just as described in here and they're usually eaten around here as soon as they're cool enough to handle LOL! Oh and the bacon bits end up in salads later too!

This was so yummy even my son who is picky about eating breakfast loved them!! I made mashed potatoes with an instant potatoes mix I had on hand and I used pancake mix instead of the baking flour because I didn't have any flour left lol. It turned out fantastic anyways!!! I'll definitely be making these again so easy peasy to make!!

Made this recipe with my highschool cooking class and it's great! My family always made potato pancakes without flour so the texture of these was a refreshing change. Goes great with a little sour cream on top!

Great recipe simple and delicious breakfast! Since I try not to eat prepackaged foods I grated a medium size potato myself and had some leftover mashed potatoes I cooked last night I added a pinch of coarse salt and used Swans Down cake flour since I was out of baking mix. Served with sour cream. It was very good but I think next time I will not use mashed potatoes and will double the raw grated potatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

My boys live this recipe. It is very easy to make and filling. (My 8 year old loves them topped with butter!)
