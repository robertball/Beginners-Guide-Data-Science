This was nice for a change! This dressing has a very fresh flavor, and I liked that. I didn't have any white wine vinegar, so I used rice wine vinegar, and no peanut oil, so I subbed 1 tbsp. sesame oila dn 1 tbsp. canola oil...it gave this a nice, toasty flavor in the background. I made this earlier in the day to allow the flavors to blend. You can really taste each flavor, which is nice. Served this over a simple salad w/ chow mein noodles. Would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

It was good but I had to add more carrots, honey and olive oil to make it more mild as the ginger flavor was very, very strong. I added the juice and the zest of a small orange and one clove of garlic too.

as is it is very simple, I finally added orange zest to give it some flavor.  I ate this, but will look for a more flavorful alternative.  also, it made quite a bit more than I expected, but it  will depend on the size of your carrots.
