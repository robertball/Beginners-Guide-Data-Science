9-20-2018 ~The fortuitous events of Hubs (who doesn’t like halibut) being in Canada and my having more halibut the other night than I could eat in one sitting led me to this recipe. What a winner!  I didn’t have lemon, but that didn’t stop me from making this – I’m one of those rare individuals who doesn’t like lemon with my fish anyway.  I didn’t have Italian blend cheese (don’t use it), but the shredded blend I had on hand worked just fine.  I also used half the amount of Worcestershire called for, which I did because it seemed like overkill to me.  Good call, at least for my tastes.  I served this over Maque Choux and it was awesome good.  Just wish I hadn’t let the frying time get away from me – it goes from just right to overbrowned in the blink of an eye!

Used leftover Halibut.  It was a big hit in our household of non-fish lovers.  Will definitely make again.

I made it with leftover grilled halibut, so it  was very fast and easy. And very flavorful.

Yes. I added celery and a pinch of Cayenne.
I made 6 patties- nope not next time- I’ll make 10!
They are very good, they just fell apart when I fried them so I’m thinking they were too big. Awesome!

Made it as is. Didn't have Old Bay Spice so used Roasted red pepper seasoning.

Fantastic way to use leftover halibut.  Only change I made was to use celery instead of onion, because onion doesn’t agree with me. Yummy and I’ll definitely make it again! Thank you for sharing, Lori.

Pretty good. Used leftover cod and fried a little to long. But I still liked it
