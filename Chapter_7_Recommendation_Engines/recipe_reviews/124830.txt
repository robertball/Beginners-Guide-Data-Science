This was really good and very simple. Pies are not my specialty so when they turn out as gorgeous as this one did its pretty fool proof. I did have to play with the flour and sugar amount since the pears I used were very juicy. It's texture reminds me of peaches and cream desserts. Very pleased with all aspects. Will use from now on when my pear crop comes in. :)

The reason I picked this pie is because I LOVE the story behind it.  This was a good pie but I thought that the lemon extract was a bit overpowering.  Next time I make this I will either reduce the lemon extract to 1/4 tsp or use real lemon juice.  Thanks for sharing this recipe,Kathryn.

Delicious!  This is a fresh spin on the classic fruit pie, and it is pretty and tasty.  I used cornstarch instead of flour, to make the filling a bit smoother.  I also was out of almond extract, so I subbed coconut extract and it added to the creamy flavor.  I also sprinkled just a touch of cinnamon on the pears and that added a nice kick.  The Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this site makes an excellent base when you add 1/4 c. white sugar to it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really good, but maybe more topping is needed. Instead of lemon extract, I used 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. I also could not resist adding a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. I just sprinkled them on top before putting the topping on.  My son absolutely loved it.

This is the first pie I've ever made it in my life, and it came out perfectly!  My family is quite partial to apple pies, but when I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner, there wasn't a crumb left (and I made 2!).  Don't ad lib people... you really do need the lemon and almond extracts, it really flavours this pie quite nicely.  Thanks for the recipe!

Quite good - Had its own unique flavor without detracting too much from the natural deliciousness of pears. Best yet, it was easy. It seems there could be something of a debate going on around her as to whether or not the extracts were the right amount. :] I personally found that the extracts were a bit much, and plan to try a little bit less of the almond/lemon next time without taking them out altogether. My topping also was a little too squishy, I think, and there wasn't enough of it, but with some extra flour this was no problem. I also think some cinnamon might go nicely in it and will include it next time. Overall a good pie - Will definitely make again. Thanks!

This recipe was very original; who would have thought of a pear pie? It tastes very good chilled--flavors of all three extracts are accentuated, so it would be better not to omit them, especially the almond extract. We also decided to dice the pears into cubes, which makes each bite much easier than had they been wedges of pears. Overall, good pie with subtle taste.

Simply delicious! After reading the reviews, I took the advice of several and added a pinch of cinnamon to the creamy mixture. I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream and doubled the topping. I will try substituting tapioca for the flour next time. (In my opinion the flour gave the filling a glue-ish texture/flavor.) I also used the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" recipe from this site with the addition of 2 Tblsp sugar. Overall a creamy delicate flavored pie!!!!

I make this pie often for my family at Holidays heavily modified with Apples (instead of pears), 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup cream cheese, no lemon extract, toss apples with some fresh lime juice, sprinkle a few dried cranberries and add a little cinnamon to the topping and it turns out great!

This was good and pretty simple. I used a mixture of bosc and d'anjou pears. I did think the lemon extract dominated a bit, so I may try something different next time.

Loved this! I did not add any sugar at all to the filling or topping and the flavour of the pears shines through splendidly! My husband can't have sugar and I don't like fake sugar, but this recipe was fantastic without. I also threw in about 1/4 cup of oats to the topping since they have a bit of natural sweetness and work well for crumble toppings. Like others I wish there had been more topping!

Creamy AND Dreamy - and simply the best. Thanks for all the hints, Reviewers . . . cubed the pears, doubled the topping and added cinnamon. What an outrageous flavor - delicate and full of flavor. A Real Fav.  Thanks, Kahryn! xoxoxo

This was great! My Dad, son and husband went out and picked about three bushels of not really ripe pears and have been bugging me to make them something with them. All three of them loved this pie, and thanks to AR for the advice of baking a pie in a paper bag, it was golden and beautiful too!

This was really tasty. Quite a pleasant surprise. The almond extract really enhances the flavor of the pears. I don't have lemon extract so I substituted 1/2 tsp of lemon zest. I had to double the flour for the topping to get it crumbly, so I doubled the sugar as well.  Make it slightly ahead as it's good chilled for a bit and is easier to cut. Thanks for sharing, and for the mental gymnastics required to remember the recipe! :)

I really liked this.  The first taste was a surprise of flavor, but then I couldn't get enough.  I craved a second piece!  My husband, not so much, but he doesn't really like trying new things.

The pie was easy to make and quite tasty.  Unfortunately the pears were too hard so I'm not sure if I need over ripe pears to make this recipe work completely.

The pie was just "okay".  The creamy texture from the sour cream was very nice.  The almond flavor really came through but I could not taste the lemon.  The topping was very good.  Overall there was still something missing for me.  If I make again, next time I will add more sugar, add cinnamon and double the topping.

I made this recipe as is, and it was delicious. I think next time I will try adding nuts to the topping to give it a little crunch.

Great recipe! I've tweaked it over several times of making it b/c of personal taste but still really good as originally written. This will definitely be a stand by in my box for our pear harvest each year.

Yummy flavor!  My pears weren't ripe enough so it was a little crisp, but I will make it again.

Very good!  I added more flour to the filling (pears were VERY ripe and juicy), used lemon juice instead of lemon extract, and sprinkled dried cranberries over the crust before pouring the filling in.  I added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon to both the filling and the topping.  I also doubled the flour and sugar in the topping.  This was very tasty and a big hit!

The almond flavoring in this is NOT needed.  I think i will try this again but half the other flavorings as well, overall, good recipe, and great way to use up some pears!

I thought this was good. The topping was yummy. I put the filling in a deep dish pie crust and it worked perfectly. I had never made pear pie before and was surprised at how easy it was.

I'm a novice baker and mine didn't turn out so well.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but my pears never got mushy (and I kept it in the oven as long as I could without burning the crust--55 minutes total).  Any ideas why? Are there some kinds of pears that work better for baking than others?  That said, even with my crunchier pear pieces this pie is delicious.
