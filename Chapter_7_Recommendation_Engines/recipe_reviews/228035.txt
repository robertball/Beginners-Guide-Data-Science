I'm giving this four stars, but in fairness, I made so many changes I don't feel qualified to rate it as written. **Please Note** the serving size is only TWO!!  I didn't notice this until I was putting it together, and realized I needed more food,requiring me to make so many changes. Also, I wasn't sure what a 1Qt baking dish was, so I improvised and not sure if that affected the outcome. Overall, the taste is good; lasagne-ish. I will try to make this again with the right proportions by adjusting the servings before getting started.

This was delicious! I am doing Weight Watchers so I made it a little more "point friendly" by skipping all that oil. I used low fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta and low fat mozzarella. I only had dried basil and garlic and I didn't have the worcestshire sauce. It was soo good! I got 3 good sized servings at 2 points each. This one is a keeper!

I made this recipe for the first time last night. I have never made eggplant before and it was a hit with my husband and I. Easy and very good! I did substitute the ricotta cheese for cottage cheese so I didn't have to make an extra trip to the store.I also added a little extra cheese and garlic. Very good!!

This was a pretty simple and light recipe to throw together.The only important adjustment I made was to season this mixture with salt and pepper.This makes a wonderful and healthy vegetable side dish to your meal.
