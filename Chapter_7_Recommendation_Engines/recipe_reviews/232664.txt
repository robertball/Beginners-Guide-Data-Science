O.K., I’ll admit it, I still like a whole egg frittata better than an egg white frittata, but this was pretty good.  I bought a container of liquid egg whites, and they worked well.  The single thing that boosts flavor is the thyme.  This may be a compromise for many, but if you’re watching your cholesterol or just trying to eat healthier, this recipe is a super star!

The flavor of this is ok. The texture is a bit less pleasant. I added hot peppers and topped it with some habanero sauce at the end. Thank you for the recipe.

I had to flip it in parts instead of whole. I’ll keep trying. It was delicious. 

I sautéed the onions and zucchini with olive oil and added a little butter in the pan before adding the eggs. I also added some shredded cheese before I flipped it. I used Zatar seasoning.

I scrambled the egg. Was better that way for me.
