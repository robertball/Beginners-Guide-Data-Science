These are a great cookie both for those who prefer a less-sweet version (as-is), and for those who like sweet (iced with Icing for Sour Cream Cookies on this site).  I agree that they are almost like little scones (not a moist cookie, and they don't spread). I found that they cooked in much less time than noted - my oven temp is accurate, and 13 minutes was plenty, so watch carefully.  Love that they're packed full of nuts, and I used golden raisins in my version - a little more subtle flavor.  Will definitely make again.

This is an excellent recipe. I baked these for a party and the cookies were a hit! The icing recipe for these cookies is excellent,too! Thank you, Celeste for a great recipe!

I baked several kinds of cookies this year and these were by far the easiest to prepare and the best tasting, be sure to use the sour cream icing.

These are easy to prepare and very tasty. I do wonder about the one teaspoon size cookies, however. I used my 1 Tablespoon cookie scoop and made 50 cookies. They baked in about 18 minutes at 350 (my oven is accurate). Instead of greasing the cookie sheet, try using parchment paper. Just throw it out when finished and clean-up is a snap!

I mistakenly bought light sour cream and the cookies turned out fine.  Wouldn't know I used the light in them.  I made the first turn plain because I was afraid they wouldn't be any good and didn't want to waste my pecans and raisins.  Hubby said to add the rest as the cookies were fine.  So the last few batches we had pecans and raisins in them and used the icing that goes with the cookies.  Thought the icing would be too sweet as I didn't even use all the sugar in it but because the cookies aren't sweet, the icing went well with them, though we used it sparingly.

My family has been making these for Christmas for over 40 years. They are always a crowd pleaser, and even the naysayers who dont like sour cream love them. They freeze well too. We have never iced ours though, will have to try that and we have never added nuts or raisins. I am not sure why, as it sounds delightful, but almost always add a bit of extra sugar and vanilla, as I like mine sweeter. The lumpy shape is a nice contrast to the typical "Cut out" cookie...

I have made these cookies for Christmas
and I know that I will be making these at any time of the year!  These are a wonderful little cookie.  Not to sweet but very moist.  They turned out to be a favorite!  Instead of using the icing, I chopped walnuts, and mixed them with sugar and cinnamon and put them on top before baking, and it was great!

Yum-yum, five stars!  They are kind of like a scone, as another reviewer said but that's fine they go great with a cup of coffee!  And the Icing for Sour Cream Cookies from this site really makes the difference!

I only thing I changed about this recipe was I used whole wheat flour, didn't use pecans or raisins. But I did use different mix ins. I added some oatmeal, chocolate chips, and peanut butter chips to half the batch and cinnamon chips to the other half. These cookies were cake like and I found them to be more than sweet enough plain. This is a great base recipe for those whole like cake cookies. These stay super moist.

Pretty much the only reason why I made these cookies was because my name is also Celeste, so I was excited to find someone else with that name! And, well, the cookies - they were great! I will defintely make these again!

These are a good not too sweet cookie. They wern't as good the next day though. I used a buttercream frosting. I thought it was a good combo. My 20 month old loved them! I will make again.

Made these for dessert and they were AMAZING. I made the following alterations: I used whole wheat flour, half the amount of pecans, craisins instead of raisins, fat free sour cream, and margarine instead of butter. Their texture right out of the oven was reminiscent of cornbread and naturally sweet - and I used the frosting from this site and it tied the whole experience together. 

I will definitely be making these again. Next time though I will be using good old fattening regular sour cream and lots more craisins.

These are definately more of a "biscuit"  (with a hint of sweetnest) than a cookie. My family liked them alot though. The only problem I had was with them burning so I turned the oven down to 325 and did not grease the cookie sheet (used a non stick) and they came out great! I strongly suggest icing them, the extra little bit of sweetness makes them that much tastier!!

Thought these were very good but not sure if I made a mistake as they turned out more like mini scones instead of a cookie. The icing does make the difference although if you wanted a little something less sweet the cookie would be fine without the icing.

I was disappointed. I had been told by a friend that these were very good. They just seemed rather blah to me.

Delicious cookies with the recommended icing for sour cream cookies on this site. I did reduce the pecans to 1 1/2 cups chopped. and used 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup coconut oil. Also my all purpose flour was all purpose whole wheat flour. And I used golden raisins which I soaked in the beaten eggs ahead. So raisins and eggs went into fat and sugar mixture together. I refrigerated dough several hours or overnight. That was just convenient for me. These cookies have a lovely flavor and texture.    Patrizia 3/25/2014
