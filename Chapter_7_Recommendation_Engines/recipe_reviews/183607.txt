I just made this (my neighbor has made it before and shared and it was incredibly good!) but mine just wasn't as great, BUT my oven's heating element was on its way out and I think I overcooked it trying to make up the difference. The quality of the salmon will make a difference here, and dont overcook. Otherwise, this simple recipe makes fantasic salmon! You dont taste the teriyaki much, just awesome salmon.

I used 1 cup of Mikee Teriyaki sauce instead of Newmans t. Sauce and 1 cup of BBQ sauce. I added some fresh garlic and sprinkled the top with sesame seeds. I let it marinate for a couple of hours and kept it covered while it baked in the oven for about 20-25 minutes. It was really good!

This was good.  My 5-year-old even ate it.  I had to cook it a lot longer than the 7-10 minutes, even with thin pieces of salmon.  It was actually closer to 20 minutes.
