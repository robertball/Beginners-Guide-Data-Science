Not too bad. I read a review that said they'd use this for a festive touch and was confused. Until I tasted it. The orange liqueur I used (an upscale triple sec) really did add something that reminded me of Christmas or Thanksgiving. Very interesting! I added a splash of club soda and will add this to my list of drinks.

Very good, but a tad sweet for me.  Next time I'll use plain lime juice versus sweetened, which I'm sure will make it perfect!
