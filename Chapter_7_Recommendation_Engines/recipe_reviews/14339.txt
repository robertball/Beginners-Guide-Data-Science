In making this recipe, I realized what my mom did differenty.  Here are the changes I made according to her: Use LIMEade concentrate instead of lemonade, a 24 oz. container of frozen, sweetened strawberries, and omit the sugar.  It will still be sweet, but I think it has a nice sweet/tart balance. Freeze in individual clear plastic cups so kids can help themselves.

My family just loves this!!  It's very refreshing on a hot summer day.  For the 4th of July I added a cup of blueberries for added color. It looked great and tasted great.

My whole family loves this fruit salad.  It's a great winter recipe since most fresh fruit is out-of-season in PA during that time.  I make it every Christmas with sausage crepes.  I've made it lots of times and I cut back the sugar to at least half of what the recipe lists.  It has lots of natural sweetness and the extra sugar is really not necessary.  Also it must be taken out of the freezer at least 30 minutes before serving or it will still be totally solid.

Not only was this a delicious dish, it was also very pretty !  I brought it to a potluck and it was a huge hit amongst fussy eaters ! As far as preparation, it couldnt have been easier unless it made itself ! I will definitely make this again! I wouldnt change a thing about it.

I also love this! I do make many changes, however, to suit my taste. I omit the sugar altogether. I also add diced canned peaches and fresh grapefruit sections. I freeze it in my silicone muffin pan-- the salads pop right out! Leftovers are put into a freezer bag and work welll for a quick, healthy breakfast.

What a keeper!!!  I've made this about four or five times this summer. My family just loves it and always goes back for seconds and thirds...usually serves as a dessert for us, but also makes a refreshing side dish!  Here's what we've done to "tweak" it:  I reduce the bananas to 3, and add two small cans of mandarin oranges...quite yummy!!!

This is one of my favorite salads!  Kids and adults both love it and it is refreshing any time of year!  I put liners in my muffin tin and then freeze individual servings of this salad.  Once their frozen, they can be popped out and stored in a freezer bag.  Do allow some defrost time, as another person mentioned, or else it will be impossible to cut!

Delish!  I also cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup as one reviewer mentioned.  I poured it into small springforms (individual size), which made for a nice presentation. They popped out very easy once the spring was released.  I served it with a quiche and hashbrowns for brunch.

Fantastic!  I added a pinch of ground cloves to the mix and froze in individual ramekins.  I served it with Christmas Breakfast Casserole and warm buttered toast.  What a great way to wake up!

My mother-in-law made this for my son's borthday party. It was a great hit kids and adults alike loved it. You can also change up the fruit by adding whatever frozen fruit you like.

A past teacher used to make this for the students when I was in high school and i've been looking for this recipe for a long time.  She used to put it in plastic dixie cups for the ease.  I absolutely love this recipe!  I cut a bunch of grapes in half and also add it to the mix.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very Delicious!  I just served it to my co-workers for lunch and I received many compliments and requests for the recipe.  It does take a while for it to thaw decent enough to cut, I cut it after about 30 minutes.  It doesn't turn to mush right away either, I had it sitting out for an hour and a half and it was still frozen. I re-froze it afterward and there are people calling dibbs on an afternoon snack slushie.  I did not alter the original recipe and I thought it was great, I will try some of the other fruit concoctions though!  Yum-o

Loved it. My 7 year old cut up the bananas while I thawed and mixed everything. Doubled it and put it in 13 16 oz. plastic cups and froze for breakfast for my daughter's birthday party sleepover.

I've been making this recipe for years, and it is always a favorite. Like the others, I omit the sugar. This time, I will also omit the bananas, and strawberries, replacing them with peaches and blueberries, because I am serving this at my wedding, and my groom can't have seeds, and I want to do it a bit further ahead, and am not sure how well the bananas will hold up, in the freezer, for the three weeks, until then. But, if I find out they won't brown, then I may leave them in, and still add the blueberries! I am also going to try the limeade, instead of the lemonade, this time. I know this will be a huge hit, at our reception. I'm almost afraid it will upstage the cake!

My daughter loves this.  I never add the sugar and have only used orange juice concentrate because my grocery doesn't sell the smaller cans.  The first time I made it I didn't want to use the sweetened sliced strawberries (didn't want the sugar) so I had to buy whole strawberries and they did freeze up rock hard.  It's pretty easy to slice the frozen whole strawberries (it seems like thawing and refreezing them is best avoided) and they are MUCH easier to eat when sliced.  I bought a pack of five 1-3/4 cup glad containers and the salad fits perfectly in them.  My daugher wraps them in ice block and takes them to school for lunch.  Her friends are jealous and I feel good for giving her a healthy side for her pb&j!  Even though I don't add extra sugar and use the unsweetened strawberries it's still plenty sweet for us (and my kid loves sweets).  The juice in the pineapples is super sweet already.

This was excellent except that the strawberries freeze too hard and don't thaw  quickly enough to eat. I will leave them out the next time. Very good flavor. I don't know what you could replace the strawberries with that wouldn't freeze so hard. maybe raspberries.

This was yummy. Next time I make it I will use less pineapple. I like the  fact that this would taste just as good with other kinds of fruit.

This is very easy and the kids love it, so it gets 5 stars! I poured it in popsicle containers and they love that there is real fruit in it.  It is kind of sour for my tastes due to the orange juice and lemonade.  Just personal preference though!  Oh and I forgot to add the pineapple and it was still good!  Might be even better with it.

This was very good.  And I'm making it again today.  However, I think it takes a bit longer than the 1 hour listed for freezing time.  Just to let you know in case you're in a hurry :-)

The taste is wonderful, and you can do many variations. I added blueberries. However, it is a little messy to eat. I may do this again and make them as popsicles.

This receipe was very easy and pretty - though way to sweet. If I make this again I would omit the 1/2 cup of sugar. With the remaining I blended and added water to balance it out. This version was a great hit with the kids!

Prepared for July 4th brunch.  Added fresh blueberries as was suggested by another reviewer.  Prepared on a Wednesday for a Friday morning event.  The recipe does not indicate how long it takes to "freeze" until firm.  I guess the intent is that you are preparing and serving the same day.  I removed the dish from the freezer about 25 minutes before serving and it was still rock hard.  If you are going to prepare this in advance, plan to remove from the freezer one hour before serving.  The flavors were wonderful and I will make this again.

Overall good recipe.  I served this as part of our family's Christmas brunch and it was a nice sweet treat.  I used part orange juice concentrate and part limeade concentrate.  I also added some frozen peaches cut into thirds which was yummy.  I used our upright deep freezer to store this dish which froze it solid!  I set it out for 40 minutes and then resorted to popping it into a cooling-off oven in order to make it soft enough to eat...so if you use a deep freeze - beware of the thaw time needed!

This certainly was refreshing, and it looked nice in muffin-tin portions, but I found the juice concentrate made it a bit overly tart and sickly sweet at the same time.

This is a great fruit dish! It's easy to make & healthy. It does take quite a while to freeze, and then you need to allow plenty of time for it to soften up to serve it.  I enjoy taking a small portion to work for a snack and it's defrosted just enough by the time I'm ready to eat it. I added a can of mandarin oranges.  This makes a lot!

I made this last year for Christmas and boyo was it great! It made ALOT and WAS very sweet. So this year I omitted the bananas and added 2 c. frozen ALASKA blueberries. I also decreased the sugar by 1/2. (1/4 cup). I can't wait to pick blueberries next summer, just for this recipe! Thanks Rhonda!

I'm hoping to remember this, come summer.  It is sweet-tart, tasty and refreshing.  I did not add additional water or sugar, and the only added sugar I used was in the lemonade mix.  I used frozen whole strawberries, and I let them thaw slightly so I could slice them.  I recommend freezing this in a muffin tin, so the servings would be more attractive on the plate.  I like it, and my family hopes I will make it again!

I have used a recipe similiar to this. We spoon the fruit salad into individual plastic punch cups and freeze. Easy peasy.
