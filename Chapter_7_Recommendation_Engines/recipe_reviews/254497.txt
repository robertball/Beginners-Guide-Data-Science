I basically cut the recipes in half using a pound and a half of green grapes and 2 sliced banana since I did not have red grapes. I also substituted half a cup of  pecans in place of 1 cup of walnuts and added a tsp of vanilla. It was good but I prefer cream cheese - sour cream dressing instead of a straight cream cheese dressing.

Way too much of the cream cheese and agave nectar.  The grapes and nuts were drowning in it.  Might make it again with brown sugar but might not.
