This was too die for with the following changes:

Omitted frozen spinach and used fresh spinach (2 c.) and added to the oil and garlic mixture during last 4 minutes of cooking then added alfredo sauce etc... Also added 2 tbls. pesto to Alfredo Sauce.   We topped pasta off with Asiago Cheese which is what MADE this recipe.We also accidently fried the sauage but would be fine broiled as recipe calls for.

This recipe is very good and easy to make. To give the jar sauce more of a homemade taste, I added white wine, Romano cheese, and water from the cooked pasta. I also added a can of diced tomatoes (seasoned with Italian seasonings) with the pasta and spinach. This recipe would also be good with chicken.

Simple and delicious!  After reading the reviews I made some additions and modifications. First, I just took the sausage out of the casing, crumbled and browned it in a pan.  Then, I sauteed some fresh mushrooms in the olive oil and garlic.  I also used a bag of fresh baby spinach instead of frozen and wilted that with the mushrooms.  I used Classico Roasted Garlic Alfredo sauce and added in 2 TBSP of basil pesto.  Next, I mixed in some petite diced tomatoes that I had drained and then added in the cooked sausage.  Let everything cook for a few minutes and served over bow tie pasta.  Deliciouso!

This was excellent! I am always looking for easy to make pasta recipes that my husband will love and did!! I make the alfredo from scratch... a must and so easy! I just melted butter, cooked the garlic in the butter as directed, added teh heavy cream, parmesan, salt and pepper, brought to a boil, reduced to simmer and let it cook down. Then I just follow the recipe as is. It is a great way to get some spinach into a very rich, delicious meal! I will make this probably more than chicken alfredo, thanks!

This was REALLY good!  The only thing I did different was I added fresh mushrooms to it and it was excellent.  My husband loved it.  Because I added a lot of mushrooms, it sucked up a lot of the sauce leaving the noodles only lightly covered.  Next time I might add just a little less noodles to make it slightly more saucy.  Other then that, it was great.

Broiling the hot Italian sausage really brings out the flavor.  Make sure you break up the chopped spinach before you try to add it to the pasta or you will get clumps of spinach that you will have to break up before you can serve.  The end result though is DELICIOUS!

This is my lazy night pasta dish. Incredible flavor! I use the Classico Garlic Alfredo jarred sauce. I stretch the jarred sauce by making a roux with butter/flour/garlic/salt/pepper then add milk....and then I mix the jarred sauce into that. I just like my pasta with extra sauce. I've tried it with mild italian sausage, and also pork link sausage and the flavor is just not the same. Stick to the Hot Italian Sausage. Yum!

Really good and super easy. I made my own Alfredo (didn't have jarred sauce) by sauteing 3 cloves garlic in 2 tbsps butter, adding  tbsps flour, and then 2 cups half and half, stirring in a bunch of parm towards the end, and black pepper to taste. 

Really liked the combination of creamy pasta and spinach with spicy browned sausage.

I made this one night after a long day at the pool. Was quick and easy. My WHOLE family ate it, from my husband who said "Is that spinach? I dont eat spinach." To my 4 year old who never eats anything. In fact, everyone had seconds. I added about a cup of water from the pasta like suggested in previous reviews. Definately will make this again.

Awesome dish, the only items that I added were 1 cup of sliced portobello mushrooms, 2 roma tomatoes, 1 sprig of fresh rosemary, doubled the garlic, and added extra alfredo sauce to ensure that the extra ingredients were well coated and used 2 cups of fresh spinach. Awesome meal on its own!

Wow! Everyone really enjoyed this. I changed just a couple of things...I didn't want to heat up the kitchen so grilled the sausage (added great flavor). Meanwhile, cooked and drained the pasta and reserved about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking liquid. I didn't use fresh garlic because we had purchased Bertolli Garlic Alfredo Sauce and I didn't want to over-do the garlic taste. After draining pasta, placed it back in the pan and added approx. 2 cups of fresh baby spinach and tossed and covered to keep warm. Sauted a red pepper (for color) and the sliced sausage for a couple of min. then added the Alfredo and pepper. Put the 1/2 cup pasta water in the Alfredo Sauce jar and shook it up and added that. Then added the pasta and spinach. Warmed for just a second and served. This was on the table in less than 25 min. Served with Garlic Bread. This is a keeper. We will use the often. Thank you for sharing!

This is a home run.  Tastes great.  Easy and doesn't take long. Great change from using tomato based sauce. Can be a complete meal on it's own or served with great bread and a salad.  Easy to make little changes.  I made a bit too much pasta so I added a little white wine to the sauce.  I also had some chopped, canned tomatoes I wanted to use up so I added those.  Both are good suggestions from other reviewers (or maybe it was one other reviewer). Mushrooms might be good to add when sauteing the garlic.

Family really liked this one. Use sweet italian sausage instead of the hot one. Doubled the recipe added mushrooms, place in a baking pan topped with cheese and baked at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.

In order to make this recipe quicker and less spicy, I didn't use hot Italian sausage.  I cook the sliced sausage in the skillet in olive oil, cook the frozen spinach in the microwave, drain it and add it to the sausage, pasta and sauce mixture.  I then add a lot of garlic and onion powder.  It turns out great and it's quick.

Very easy to make and tasty. Will def put into rotation at my house. I made with turkey sausage to make it a tad healthier. Also used sweet because spicy is to much for the kids.

Just made this for dinner tonight, it was delicious! I did use fresh spinach and loose hot Italian sausage as per other reviews, otherwise followed all directions. My husband hates any pasta with spinach and asked for seconds! Already saved to recipe box! Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this with Sabatino's Artichoke with Mozzarella and Garlic Sausage (Costco) and it was great. I also sautéed mushrooms with the garlic and added about 3 1/2 tablespoons of diced tomatoes. Served it with garlic bread and a salad. Oh, and when I make again, I'm going to use just a little less spinach!! Super easy and pretty fast.

I used mild italian sausage removed from the casing. It really released the flavors through out the dish. I also added fresh tomatoes at the end of the cooking process (just to warm them threw). Good and easy to make.

Delicious! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, cooked it with the garlic, in which I also added fresh mushrooms. I cut up 2 Roma tomatoes and added that to the sauce. We will definitely be eating this again!

Great recipe!  This is the first time the kids ever liked spinach and they all gave it 5 stars!  I used a bit more pasta (whole wheat bow ties) because my package was 16 ounces.  I topped with fresh parmesan.

Not a bad recipe, can't get away from the fact this is a jarred Alfredo Sauce (so use a good quality sauce). Used fresh spinach and added 1 cup of sliced baby bella mushrooms.

My family really enjoyed this meal, well, my son didn't care for the spinach part. Oh, well.  It was very good.  I opted not to use the spicy Italian sausage and used mild.  Still very yummy!!

I made this the other night with collard greens instead of the spinach. I sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese on the top. It was very satisfying and rich. I would like to try this with tortellini next time. Thank You for a really nice dinner!

This was delicious. I had to make this using frozen broccoli because, despite my efforts, the hubby hates spinach.  I would love to try it sometime with spinach because I think it would be great.  I also sautéed the sausage with garlic instead of broiling.

This was very good AND quick!  I cooked my sausage (with the garlic and oil) in a large skillet instead of broiling.  Then just added the sauce and pepper.  Came out great.  I will make it again.... Thanks!

This was great!  I found it by the "ingredient search" feature here on AllRecipes, in order to use some spinach and Alfredo sauce.  I fried my spinach and garlic in olive oil and added some mushrooms to that, just because the family likes them.  Even people who claim not to care for Alfredo sauce liked this dish. That's a testament to a good recipe!

This was so simple, easy and fast to make.  It was delicious!!!  I didn't have sausage so I used chorizo instead and it was awesome.  I will definitely keep this recipe to make again!

I was cleaning out the fridge and had sausage, spinach and some fusilli that I wanted to use up.  Luckily, I ran across this recipe.  I crumbled the sausage and browned it in a saucepan along with sliced red onion for additional flavor.  It was delicious.

This was a hit. Tweaked it by adding mushrooms and red peppers instead of tomatoes. Also I used two jars of Prego's  Alfredo Sauce one the Basil Pesto made with Romano Chesse and the other Roasted Garlic Parmesan.....---Rabbit

I really enjoyed this recipe!  Of course I didn't rate it 5 stars because I did not have all the ingredients to rate it accordiingly.  I did not have the alfredo sauce so I used an 8 oz block of soften cream cheese.  I used ground mild Italian sausage, and one Johnsonville precooked sausage link.  I followed the recipe best as I could with what I had on hand and I absolutely love it!  I've noticed sometimes the jarred alfredo sauce can be a little over powering in some dishes. I loved it my way!  Give it a whirl! I used spiral pasta as that is what I had on hand....

Yum!  This was a hit with the whole family!  The only reason it didn't get five stars was there was too much spinach.  I'll cut that in half next time.  And there will be a next time!

Had a roll of italian sausage, so cooked that in a pan until almost brown before adding the garlic and 10oz fresh spinach (didn't use olive oil).  Cooked until spinach was wilted, added pepper, then made the "Quick Alfredo Sauce" recipe from this site right in with this recipe. Substituted large elbows for the bow tie pasta.  This was a GREAT, easy, and fast dinner, even with making our own alfredo.

Excellent, very tasty recipe.  I did use fresh spinach sautéed with the garlic, and I used sweet Italian sausage.  Hubs and I both loved it, and I'll definitely make this one again.  So easy and truly delicious.  I don't mind using a good jarred Alfredo sauce....I used Barilla roasted garlic Alfredo, so I did cut the minced garlic back to only one clove.  With freshly-grated parmesan on top...it was just great.  Thanks for this one.

This meal is AWESOME. It's my hubs' new favorite. I added mushrooms to the sauce and used smoked sausage. I still broiled the sausage even though it's pre-cooked, but the crispy skin makes it even more amazing.

I love this recipe. It's easy, fast, and totally delicious. Instead of alfredo from a jar, I used the Cream Cheese Alfredo Sauce (by Mommy Bakes) found on this site. 

Put this one in your recipe box. You'll be glad you did.

LOVED IT! I had some cooked bulk sausage in the freezer, so I just used that. I did have to add a little milk to thin it out a bit cause it was way thick, but other than that this was GREAT! I will be making this again for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good!  My kids even ate the spinach.  My three year old wanted more!  I have made this dish so many times and I can not think of anything I would change.  It is so good.  My family loves it.  It has quickly become a family favorite!!  Do not change the recipe, just try it the way it is supposed to be and you will not be disappointed!!

Excellent flavor.  I took some advice from a few other reviewers.  I used fresh spinach and sautéed it in with the oil and garlic. The Italian Sausage I used was a little too spicy and threw off the balance of the dish, but that may just have been the sausage I used.

I wasnt expecting this to be good but it really was!  I added sauteed fresh mushrooms w/ onions and actually used 2 jars. It was perfect and not too saucy even .

This recipe was great! Easy to make and I believe I only spent around 10$ to feed a five person family with left overs. I am not a spinach eater and I still loved it, as well as my 6, 4 and 1 yr olds. We ate it with garlic toast and used beef bratwursts instead for the kids and it was great!

Super easy and quick.  Loved the flavor.  Though I hate to see reviews with an "I changed it..." comment, I did add a little brandy to the sauce.  It was amazing!  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe that is sure to be a family favorite.

I did this recipe except with tomato sauce (my husband doesn't do cream sauces).  It turned out really well, although it might be better with mild italian sausage--I think the acidic sauce kicked up the spiciness a little too much.

This was a good quick recipe.  I bought jarred sauce and then added, extra garlic, butter, cream, and Parmesan cheese.  I also used fresh spinach.  My family loved it and didn't know they were eating spinach until I told them.  I will cook this again!

This was a hit with my whole family.  I used Newman's Own alfredo sauce and followed the recipe exactly.  Next time, I'm going to try to find a way to reduce some of the fat.

This has become my family's favorite new dish, my husband loves it.  Only thing I changed was adding a can of petite diced tomatoes in the sauce and using fresh spinach.  It tastes even better warmed up as leftovers.

Will definitely make again.  I didn't have any spinach so I used two small cans sliced mushrooms that I sauteed with the garlic.  I also added a little bit of parmesan to the sauce.  I will make this with spinach when I have some.  This recipe is all about the flavor of the Hot Italian Sausage...it's the one thing to not alter.  I think I will add sliced green olives next time also.  I think that would be awesome.

When I say "I made it", I actually made a modified version of it.  This was certainly the inspiration though.  I used sweet Italian sausage, which is spicy enough for my young kids.  I took it out of the casings and scrambled it, instead of slicing it.  I did not have the Alfredo sauce, but I used freshly grated parm and some chicken stock and it did make a nice light sauce.  I also diced a large red bell pepper to add color and the extra veg for the kiddos!  Everyone loved it, will definitely make again!

This was pretty simple and easy to make! I did, however, make a few changes. I don’t like Italian sausage so, I used smoked sausage instead. Added some sun dried tomatoes and crushed red pepper when sautéing the garlic. Like some of the other reviews, I also made my own Alfredo sauce. This was delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

I used fresh spinach because I had it and wilted it in the oil with the garlic. I increased the garlic quite a bit because we love garlic in our family. The only thing I would do differently next time is a diced roma tomato or two.

Yummy! I was looking for a new recipe for Italian sausage that did not have red sauce and this it the bill perfectly. I used sweet Italian sausage (family does not like hot), fresh spinach and 2 jars of Alfredo sauce. Tastes great re-heated too.

This was an excellent, quick meal.  I used green onion sausage that I bought from my Butcher (a Cajun Specialty).  I grilled the sausage first, rather than broiling it, and otherwise followed the recipe to the "t."  One of the best meals I've made in a while.....

I used a bag of fresh spinach and mushrooms. Also added petite diced tomatoes that were flavored with the sausage. I cooked the sausage on the stove top. I used an Alfredo sauce from trader joes. It came out super yummy but made me feel bad heartburn while eating it. I am not sure if there was too much salt in it or if I should have used a less spicy sausage. Husband loved it.

We inhale it!!!  It was delicious!  Though, made several changes..  Used fresh baby spinach and instead of Italian sausage, I used Eckrich Sausage.  Totally a repeat in my family!

I made this dish for my husband and 6 yr old son and we all loved it. The only changes I made was I used grilled chicken instead of sausage and I seasoned my chicken and Alfredo sauce with Italian seasoning and some parsley. I prepared everything else to the recipe and it was delicious. We all had second helpings. This was a quick and easy dish and its definitely a keeper.

I thought this was a great recipe! Instead of store bought alfredo, I made my own and used minced garlic. Hubby and the little one agree this is a keeper.

Very good meal. Quick and easy. I added an onion and six sliced mushrooms. I cooked the pasta in one pot. In another, I put a tablespoon of olive oil and shredded the uncased sausage into it with the diced onion, garlic and mushroom until it was all cooked well. Then I added the cooked pasta and a bunch of fresh spinach to the sausage until the spinach became wilted. To that, I added the jar of Alfredo sauce and some black pepper. Voila! Simple and delicious.

Awesome for a busy weekday meal! I did a couple of things differently because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand and we love a little bit of a kick in our dishes. I didn't have the bow tie pasta, so I substituted Barilla veggie penne instead. I didn't have any italian sausage links so I used Butterball turkey sausage. When I broiled the sausage, I cut it into bite size pieces and then put it in the oven for about 4-6 minutes while I cooked the pasta according to instructions. After sauteing the garlic I added the broiled sausage and then added Prego Savory Bacon alfredo sauce. Added some cajun spices and tossed the pasta in the sauce. I know my review sounds like a commercial for all these brands, but I just wanted to be specific in case anyone wants to try the version I made.

Made this for my husband and his friend one night. Used Sweet Italian sausage. Just split open case and cooked up. Made my own Alfredo sauce. It was a great meal and we enjoyed it.

My family loved this!  Great way to sneak in a super food like spinach.  However, instead of adding the spinach to the pasta I let it simmer in with the sauce which infused the sauce with the spinach flavor.  Delicious!

It was excellent. I didn't add spinach but added mushrooms instead. I found a recipe for low cal Alfredo sauce on this site. My husband and I both loved this. Excellent recipe.

This was YUMMY... I used my own very easy Alfredo recipe which did not increase the time it took to prepare this dish, but definitely made a difference. When everything was done I broiled it with parmesan and mozzarella for about 3-5 minutes so it was bubbly and light brown. My Husband LOVED it!

This recipe turned out awesome! never of would have thought that spinach will make this dish taste so better. The dish turned out nice with colors, only thing I would change is the amount of garlic the recipe requires other than that it was very tasty, I would recommend this dish to the many of those who love similar dishes like this and isn't afraid to try something new.

This recipe was easy to follow and turned out great. The sausage tasted great and went well with the pasta. Instead of sausage links, we ended up getting ground sausage. So instead of broiling it, we threw it on a Skillet and cooked it that way. We would have used 2 large pots (we only had one) so that the noodles would be warm the whole time. The final product looked great and just like the professional picture. I would definitely  recommend this recipe to someone because it turned out great and tasted divine.

one thing that turned out well was the spicy italian sausage. the directions were very easy to follow step by step. our final product looked very similar to the professional picture. i would change the grounded italian sausage to regular chopped up sausage. i would recommend this dish to someone else because of how well it turned out and how tasty it was.

This dish was delicious and impressive. I made this for company and they thought I this was an old favorite dish! That's pretty good when the first time makes you look like an old pro:) The flavor was great, but I had to add more Alfredo sauce for our taste.

I made a dairy-free version of this. Instead of using a store-bought Alfredo sauce, I used 4 oz. of vegan cream cheese, about 1 cup of original flavor soy milk, and 2 cups of diya mozzarella cheese. At fist I didn't add any salt and pepper, but it definitely needed it.

Delicious and easy! I made this exactly how recipe was written. The only thing I'd change is the jar of alfredo sauce because it was a little salty, however, all the flavors came together nicely! thanks always looking for a non-tomato way to serve pasta!

YUMMY!!!! My husband and 6 yr old ate this up, he wants me to make it "every night" I added some basil tomato sauce to the alfredo (both of which was made from scratch) and it added another dimension to the dish but it would be so good as is.

This was awesome! I used mild Italian sausage so my two-year old could eat it. She loved it! The whole family did. I also followed another reviewer's advice and added pesto to the alfredo. It was amazing. We all wanted seconds but there wasn't anything left! I will definitely double this next time. Overall, it was delicious!

This was fantastic! Turkey sausage is the way to go! It's so healthy and tastes great! I definitely recommend using fresh baby spinach instead of frozen. Also, instead of plain alfredo sauce, I used 16oz of a four-cheese blend and 8oz of a roasted red-pepper blend. The outcome was much more flavorful! My family loved it and I put it in my recipe book for later!

DELICIOUS! Both my husband and I loved it. I made a few small changes though:  1. Fresh spinach instead of frozen 2. Added mushrooms 3. I used campanelle pasta instead of bowtie because that was all I had stocked in the pantry; campanelle tasted great, but I think the bowtie would be even better.

Excellent recipe.    I was looking for something different to make for dinner, instead of the same old stuff.  This was a hit and will make it again soon.

I made this and brought it to a New Year's party last night.  Everyone loved it!  I doubled the recipe with a few exceptions. I used sweet Italian sausage and threw in a few shakes of crushed red pepper.  I also used fresh baby spinach (in the bag...I used 3 for a little extra greens).  I used 3 jars of LIGHT alfredo (instead of 2) and nobody knew the difference!  I will definitely be making this again!

This was really good, with a few modifications.  First, I used bulk mild Italian sausage that I browned in a skillet.  I removed it from the skillet and browned the garlic in the sausage oil for about 30 seconds before adding marinara sauce (I'm not a huge fan of Alfredo) with pepper.  I let that simmer for about 10 minutes and then added  the thawed spinach and the sausage back before folding in the cooked pasta.  My husband loved it-we both had seconds, plus it was very quick and easy.  I will be making this one again.

This dish was easy & delish! I made my own alfredo based off of another reviewer's tip & used sweet turkey sausage. We all loved it & I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for such a great, easy, quick recipe!

Very good and easy dinner!  Broiling the sausages was a nice touch and something I will definately do in the future!  The only thing I did different was add some red pepper flakes to the alfredo.

Loved this - easy to make and everyone enjoyed.  I've made several times and haven't changed anything other than added mushrooms a few times.  In addition this is a great recipe to throw in a slow cooker when finished and take to a pot-luck.  It is always a hit!

Excellent recipe! We substituted 2 cups of fresh spinach as the review below did and it was delicious.  I also added Parmesan cheese to the sauce.  My whole family enjoyed it, we will definitely be adding this recipe to our favorites.

Good and spicy. This was something I think I could use some cheese with, and I first cooked it w/o spinach, so definitely next time.  Some way to reduce the number of dishes I have to wash would be nice, but this is a great recipe to take for work lunches.

This was pretty easy to make and tasted great. I ended up frying the sausage, and then I added some baby bella mushrooms too. I would definitely recommend adding more sauce, the noodles soak it all right up, but other than that it was great.

Mmmmmm......I had never broiled sausage before and that was the key to flavor in this dish! I use fresh spinach and added portabella mushrooms as per one reviewer. Will add either more sauce or less pasta next time. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was quick and easy.  and reheated the next day really well too.  I did use turkey kielbasa instead of hot italian sausage - should have then added some red pepper flakes as well.

This meal was excellent! I used fresh spinach (chopped) also. Only thing I would change next time would be to add a little milk and parmesan cheese to alfredo sauce to make more sauce.

I am NOT a cook and thought this would be something easy to try that I couldn't screw up too badly :) It turned out very well. I can see myself making it again. I used Kraft Alfredo sauce and next time would maybe get a bit more so the sauce isn't stretched so much.

Glad I didn't have company coming over for this recipe. It wasn't horrible but wasn't great either. I used turkey Italian sausage and the only other change was that I added a can of diced tomatoes. The tomatoes helped! I'm not a huge fan of the jarred alfredo sauce but the one I bought was pretty good - it had mushrooms in it.Sorry but I don't see what was so fabulous about this recipe - very heavy - if you can make a meal of it you must have an iron stomach.

Loved it! Made this tonight and it was so good. I used turkey Italian sausage to lighten it up a little and I used broccoli instead of spinach because my family does not care for spinach. I also used another half of a jar of alfredo to make it a little more saucy and added some crushed red pepper. It was perfect. Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe is so amazing! My husband loved it and said that it tasted even better than something he would get in a restaurant! He wants me to make it all the time now.  The only modification I have to the recipe is, add mushrooms if you like them and sautee them in with the garlic, olive oil, spinach mixture.  So good! Broiling the sausage is brilliant, I would have never thought of doing that, ever!

Was great! I  used broccoli pieces instead of spinach because that's what i had but it was really good. My husband even ate it all and he "doesn't really care for pasta" (yay for spicy hot sausage!) If you serve huge servings it may only serve four, but we got way more out of it!

I gave this four stars because I changed everything but the ingredients. Here's what I did:  1. removed sausage casings, browned and drained sausage.   2.  saute garlic, mushrooms, and spinach that I had thawed and wrung out really well in a tiny bit of olive oil. 3. added the sausage and let it all cook for about ten minutes. 4. Make homemade Alfredo sauce with cream and milk. 5. add sausage mixture and pasta and stir. Fantastic!

This is a great recipe.  I've made it several times changing little things here and there.  I've come up with what works best for our family.  I use Hot Italian Sausage, casings removed, add onions, garlic, diced green and red peppers and I use heavy cream and Parmesan to make my own sauce as opposed to jarred Alfredo sauce.  Frozen or canned spinach works just as well, though I admit fresh gives it a bit better flavor - especially if you cook it up with minced garlic!  I've also tried it with angel hair, rotini and penne.    Thank you!  This meal has remained in our weekly rotation!

This recipe was so good and super easy! I didn't use the extra pepper and I added sundried tomatoes for a little extra something. I also had to broil the sausage more like 12-15 minutes to get it done. Will definitely use this one again!!

This ROCKED! I used red bell pepper instead of spinach since I didn't have any, but I can tell fresh spinach would definitely make this superb. I cooked the pepper pieces down a little before adding the garlic then threw in the broiled sausage to brown a bit more in the pan. I deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup white wine and cooked that down a little before adding the sauce, 1/4 cup Romano, and water from the pasta.

I really liked this, but the proportions seemed really off.  If it's four servings, they must be HUGE.  I cut it back to 1/2 lb sausage and 8 oz of pasta and 7 oz of spinach.  I kept the 16 oz jar of alfredo, because I love having lots of sauce.  It still made four big servings.  As written, you'd get at least six.  I used turkey sausage and lite alfredo for dietary reasons, and it was really good!  I think fresh spinach would be outstanding in this.

This was fantastic! Everyone went back for seconds! I used ground italian sausage instead of links by crumbling and browning it. I also added a splash of white wine and some starchy pasta water to the sauce to spread it out a little. It's not a super saucy recipe but, it covers the pasta nicely. If you want more sauce I would recomend using about 1/2 of another jar...try this, you'll love it!

This recipe is a definite keeper.  My husband loved it.  I made it exactly as the recipe is written and it was delicious.  Next time I may try with chicken italian sausage and look for a low fat alfredo to reduce the fat a little bit.

Could be a little more saucy.  However, very tasty and very unhealthy, especially the sausage bits.  Very easy to prepare.  Good to impress the men in yr life.

Fantastic! I made it for a pot luck and got great reviews!

I will definitely make it again and will try it with chicken.

I wish I would have added some Romano cheese on top. 


Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great dish!  I followed someone else's suggestion of adding diced tomatoes...I added a 15 oz can to the sauce.  The only thing I can say about the recipe is that 8 minutes is NOT enough time to broil the sausage.  I had my broiler on high, and kept turning them every 5 minutes...I would say it took about 20 minutes total.  Perhaps my oven rack was too far away from the broiler flames???  Anyway, the taste of this dish is superb!

Good recipe. I used half spicy sausage and half regular. Next time I will use all spicy and remove from casings, then brown and add rest of ingredients. I didnot add pasta water but used a diced can of Italian tomatoes with juice. I used a bag of fresh spinach. Thanks for the good, quick and easy recipe.

This was great! I made a few modifications: I used ground italian sausage instead of links, added red pepper flakes to the sauce for a nice spice, and added the spinach and sauce in with the cooked sausage and let it simmer before adding the pasta. It was terrific and seemed to make more like 6 servings.

Took the skin off of sweet sausage and cooked in a pan on the stove.  Broiler is too much work.  Used 3/4 jar of alfredo and added a bit of water to save a few calories (as other user suggested).  Used 2/3 pkg of spinach to avoid spinach overload...good way to sneak spinach to those that don't like it.

Prepared this dish yesterday; was a great hit with my wife. Had to use dried sausage, as I could not get the Italian sausage. It tasted great, but I would recommend you use about 1/2 of the recommended weight when using dried sausage. 
Made the Alfredo sauce myself; also great!

I was looking for a recipe with frozen spinach and tried this.  It's packed with flavor.  I took the advice of adding the white wine, grated pecorino romano cheese and pasta water to the bottled fettucini sauce and it was great.  It's rich though and a little goes a long way so I got much more than 4 servings from it. I suggest a green salad with it.
