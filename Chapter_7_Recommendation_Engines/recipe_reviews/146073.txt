I made these into mini muffins, and they went fast!  I used currants instead of raisins to keep with the mini idea.  I used baking powder instead of baking soda due to personal preference, and it worked out great.  The spices and wholesome ingredients have given me another recipe to make again!  Thanks!

Easy to make. The combination of these great spices gives the muffins a unique taste compared to the typical muffin recipe. Family loved it.

They are decent muffins.  I would probably make them again.  I would add a half cup of brown sugar or at least double the molassas and raisins.

Instead of the yogurt, I used half sour cream and half evap milk.  Also, I added 2t. vital gluten.

These muffins were fantastic! I was looking for something with great flavor without all the sugar.  I used grape nuts cereal since I didn't have any wheat germ and it worked just fine.  When I make them again, I will probably add some chopped walnuts or pecans.

Love these healthy muffins!!  I left out the egg, and used a single serving of applesauce, because my son is allergic to eggs.  I cut down the raisins to 1/2 cup and added 3/4 cup brown sugar.  STUPENDOUS!!!

For me, these turned out really.......wet. I mean, they were moist, but it wasn't as firm as most muffin recipes I make. They kind of fell apart, really. I followed the recipe closely and made no changes other than adding a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of baking powder. There might be a little too much molasses and I'd cut back on the yogurt next time. I even "soaked" the wheat germ and oats in the wet ingredients before folding in the dry. Good starting point for me to play with and try again. I think it has potential. NOTE: For me, this made more than twelve servings. I got 12 regular sized muffins and 12 mini muffins. Not a huge deal but when the recipe wasn't as successful, it's a huge bummer.

Very moist and tasty for such a healthy muffin! I didn't have any plain yogurt so I used vanilla instead. For my own taste I would add a bit of brown sugar (1/4-1/2 cup). . . but I loved that there was no sugar since I made them mainly for my toddler who LOVED them as the recipe stated. Definitely a keeper of a recipe.

These are delicious!  I've been on a bit of a "healthy muffin" kick lately (they're great for a quick breakfast, but I'd rather not be eating glorified cake every day), and these are among my favourites so far.  The only changes I made were to replace the butter with applesauce, use 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chunks (SO GOOD), and because the batter tasted somewhat bitter to me when it was all mixed up, I added 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup brown sugar, based on suggestions from other reviewers.  I will absolutely be making these again!

Overall these turn out good, although you need honey or jam to make them tasty. What I like most is they are healthy, high protein and low sugar. Because I used Greek yogurt, the dough turned out really thick so I had to add half a cup of soy milk to make it workable. Which meant I then had to add 1/4 tsp baking powder too. The only other modification I made it was add half cup of raisins and half cup of walnuts, instead of a full cup of raisins.

9.4.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/146073/molasses-raisin-muffins/ ... I "soaked" the oats & raisins in the yogurt for a while to plump them & added 2T milk because of that..  Tasted the batter & it didn't seem sweet enough so I added 2T more molasses.    I've noticed wheat/oat/bran, more sweetness is needed.   I thought these might be too "brown" tasting so subbed half cup of the wheat flour for white..  The molasses flavor isn't predominant & the spices aren't really detectable either in these heavy muffins; pretty though.  On the other hand, E, 21, had two & the about half cup molasses wasn't too much.  'Not as dry the next day, but still more than preferred

I added 1/4 cup brown sugar, pumpkin seeds, vanilla and I used 1 cup of yogurt and 1 cup milk since I didn't want to use up all my yogurt since I doubled the recipe. I also used grapeseed oil instead of butter. They were very moist!  They needed a little more spice for me and I would of added some apple.

I will be making them again. Very good molasses flavor. I made a glaze using brown sugar, a little water, and some chopped pecans - cook til clear and thick. Spoon over warm muffins. The caramel soaks into the bread giving the muffins a sweeter flavor.

Really loved these.  Made these into mini muffins.  I made half the batch as written and the other half I added a few tsps of brown sugar.  Both batches were nice and were equally good.  My kiddies have devoured most of them already.  A good no added sugar snack.  Will make again.
