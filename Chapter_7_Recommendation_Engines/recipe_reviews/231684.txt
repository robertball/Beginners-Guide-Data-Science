This made delicious biscuits though I did change a few things. I omitted the sugar altogether, used 1/4 Earth Balance + 1/2 C coconut oil and added a few herbs since I was making biscuits for biscuits and gravy. The biscuits are moist and yummy!

I altered the recipe with the following ingredients: 1 cup white flour, 1 cup white whole wheat flour, I also added a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar (or white or lemon juice) to the soy milk (instead of almond) to make sour milk. I also used a whole cane brown sugar instead of Stevia (I had no idea what was Stevia). The biscuits came out great! My coconut oil was in liquid form. I wasn't sure at first if that would work, but it worked great! I made a nutritional yeast gravy to go on top and they were delicious! Both of my sons, ages 4 and 9 months loved them too! Good recipe! Thanks!

Really good, but be aware of what kind of stevia powder you have. I have pure stevia extract powder with no additives, and 1/4 of a tsp makes pretty sweet biscuits, maybe a tad bit too sweet for some. I don't know what powder the writer used, but if I used a tbsp of my extract, it would be equivalent to 3-5 cups of sugar (which would make the biscuits sweeter than pure sugar in the shape of biscuits).

I made these yesterday without any high hopes, but boy was I impressed! I even received high praise from my picky eaters.

I used skim milk in place of the almond milk and only about 2/3 c. since it is not as thick, and read the reviews about these not rising much and added about 1/2 TBS vital wheat gluten. I was very happy with the outcome. I was looking for a recipe that didn't use shortening and this is IT! Thank you for a great recipe!

I needed something dairy free so I tried these. I was very pleasantly surprised!  I love using coconut oil and I had some almond milk that I had made.  I didn't have any stevia so I used a little coconut palm sugar.  They don't really rise much so don't expect that.  They are very good, though.

Great recipe. I subbed soy milk for almond milk and it ended up being a bit too much liquid so I added extra pastry floor. Also made this with sugar instead of stevia. Overall the biscuits came out moist and fluffy and my family loved them.

I chose this recipe because it does not use shortening, and I was pleasantly surprised by the result. They came out as slightly sweet, fluffy biscuits with just a hint of coconut and almond flavor.
I did not roll out the dough, but cut in the oil using my food processor, then put the mix into a large bowl and quickly worked in the milk with a spoon. Then I made patties by hand, just gently patting the dough into shape - worked very well and was quick.

I also made a second batch (at the same time), using half coconut oil and half lard (from cooking bacon), and added some onions and bacon bits (I cooked cut-up bacon and onion in a pan before adding). And I did not have any more almond milk, so I used buttermilk instead, about 2/3 cup. They came out great, too, but I think the bacon flavor does not harmonize so well with the coconut flavor, although everybody in my family still loved them. The "original" batch was a nicer, more rounded flavor overall, and if you add bacon, leave out the sugar.

Made em! Omitted stevia. Used regular whole wheat flour. Subbed cashew nut milk with a drizzle of apple cider vinegar for the almond milk. As per previous poster, they didnâ€™t seem crumbly enough after adding the 1/4 coconut oil, but I went with it and thought they tasted & tetured pretty good, all (whole wheat, vegan) things considered. Great with vegan gravy (that was breakfast) or maple syrup (that was dessert).

Had to add much more coconut oil than resume stated to get it crumbly.  I must be use to butter as an ingredient, because these biscuits lacked the "melt in my mouth" flavor.  Or it needs more stevia.

made them today with some changes. I used all white whole wheat flour. I used almond milk and added a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to make buttermilk. The biscuits are delicious light and fluffy.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Diabetic Friendly-I was out of Almond Flour so used White Whole Wheat (a softer flour than Whole Wheat) love that STEVIA! - a Diabetic best friend - I use half as much Stevia as I would sugar and Stevia is from a leaf so makes no impact on my blood sugar!! Tasty Biscuits!  Thanks for the Recipe!

I will definitely make again.  I cup of almond milk, subbed soy, was too much so had to add more than 1/4 C more flour.  Not as good as the white buttermilk ones with butter I used to make in a different life, but very good.  Used whole wheat pastry flour and the biscuits did rise.  Ate two while still warm.
