This was a very good recipe. It reminded me somewhat of the allbran muffin recipe. Not too sweet. These are muffins with substance, oats and raisins, yum! I did double the cinnamon and allspice because I love those spices. I only cooked mine for twenty minutes and they came out perfect.  I will make these again!

Since my husband is a diabetic, I used Splenda Brown Sugar replacing the sugar according to Splenda directions.  I used 2 TBS of wheat germ and skim milk to cut down on the fat a little.  This is a knock-your-socks-off recipe!

I really liked the idea of caramelizing the oats before adding them to the mix, but this recipe just didn't do it for me. They came out really dry and without as much flavor as I expected, even though I doubled the spices. They were edible warm and covered with apple butter, but it's going to take us a while to get rid of them all.

with two 2/3 cup more flour, they become fluffy and more muffiney.  the basic recipe is good, but comes out looking like flan, very jelly like.

Good flavor, slightly chewy, loaded with raisins. I doubled the amount of wheat germ and used skim milk in place of evaporated. Family loved them! Will definitely make again.

I own a bed and breakfast and these muffins passed the test of my picky guests.  As a note, bake the muffins the night before, after cooling, wrap in plastic, or just cover with a plastic bag.  The next morning they will be very moist almost like a cake.  At that time, warm up and serve with butter. Yum, muffins they keep me in business.

I love the carmelized idea.  These muffins were tastey with a nicely puffed and toasted top.  I also substituted soy milk.  They were however a tad on the dry side and I wanted them a little sweeter.
Batch #2:  I added 1/2 cup of sour cream and they came out a bit more moist. I also added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar.  This recipe makes a great base for adding variety like bananna.

These are very good dense muffins, sure to fill you up! I wasn't about to open a can of evaporated milk to just use the one cup so I just grabbed the regular milk out of the fridge.Despite the fact there's a cup of sugar in them they really aren't very sweet - try them with some peanut butter....YUMMM I will be making this again!

These muffins rose well, the recipe yield and cooking time were accurate, but the the caramelization was rather time-consuming without a big pay-off in flavor.  I always use unsalted butter, and this recipe does not list salt in the ingredients.  I feel a pinch of salt would have improved the flavor.

I really liked this!  I put in one apple, cored and sliced. I just made sure I coated the apple with flour. I also ended up using 3 packages of instant oatmeal (I realized too late it was all I had) It turned out dense and very sweet.  Oh, I also used 1 cup of vanilla soy milk instead of evaporated.  Perfect for the breakfast on the go!

tastes nothing like oatmeal cookies, if you like not so sweet muffins, this might work for you, needs more spices and sugar, mine came out very flat, dry and dense

I made it. I posted it. I gave it at five star, and I wouldn't change anything on this recipe.  I had a hot muffing with a little bit of butter with a tall cold glass of milk, and wow; this is awesome, even for breakfast. Thank you. I'm definitely going to make it again.

Very good and moist. Doubled the spices and only baked for 20 minutes.also, I like my raisins plump, so simmered them for five minutes in boiling water, drain and add to mixture.

The Caramelized idea appeal to me,  but to be honest they were not what I expected,  I found them very bland even adding extra spice,they did not have any flavor,   dipping them in applesause got them used up,  I would not ever make these again...

This recipe is spectacular! Changes I made: I didn't bother coating the raisins with flour, and I used powdered milk in place of evaporated. These tasted wonderful and I am adding the recipe to my collection.
