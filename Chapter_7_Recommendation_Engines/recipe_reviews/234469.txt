Hi, I'm birdkitty. The recipe should say to store "left over" icing in the refridgerator. Let it come to room temperature before using again, or use a spoon to eat it when it's cold, taste like peanut butter fudge, yum!! Sorry for the mistake, getting older, you know. LOL!!

This recipe was so amazing! I use it on top of my favorite brownie recipe. It tastes amazing! One problem- I tried to store my leftover icing in the fridgeâ€¦but after 24 hours, it turned hard and crusty. I wasn't able to use the leftovers :( So, definitely make this icing and then use it right away. Other than that, this icing is PERFECT! I definitely recommend it!!!!!!

I love this recipe! Delicious and easy! After following the directions, mine was the consistency of softset fudge, so I slowly added about 1/4c. more milk, and a dash of kosher salt.

This was very tasty but a bit runny. When I make it again I will cut the milk amount in half, use 1 c. peanut butter, and more like 12 oz. of sugar.

I liked this recipe, but ended up not using all the sugar and adding more peanut butter and milk to it.  It was to sweet and didn't have the peanutty taste to it before adjusting.
