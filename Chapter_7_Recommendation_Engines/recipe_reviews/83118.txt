I simered my ribs in water for about 1-1/2 hours and then put them on the grill.  Did not salt or pepper them.  Very tender and delicious!

This came out just perfect!  My mom raved that this was the best BBQ Ribs she'd ever had and my sister agreed... and trust me these 2 ladies are as picky as they come.  The only thing that I did differently was simply as a matter of taste, I added a little oregano when I seasoned with salt and pepper... DELICIOUS AND EASY!
