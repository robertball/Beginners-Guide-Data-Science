The chicken cooked really well. Unfortunately nothing else worked out. I don't know what I didn't wrong with the sauce but the taste and texture were off. I thought it was a waste to add the mozzarella because I couldn't even taste it. It was calories for nothing.

I used a red Zinfandel and I do not like any wine but it was great.

I loved this recipe except for one thing the amount of oil and butter is way more then I needed I ended up skimming 1/2 a cup off the top of my gravy and then using a paper towel to soak up the rest. I will use this recipe again no doubt in my mind I will lower the oil and use extra dry vermouth as I did this time because I had no zifindel on hand.

Loved this it was easy and even though I used red Zinfandel instead of white it was great. My husband even liked it and he always complains about chicken dishes.

Was delicious! My hubby loved it too. Cooked it exactly as called for. Was tender and flavorful. I may cut back on the oil next time as it seemed like a bit much.
