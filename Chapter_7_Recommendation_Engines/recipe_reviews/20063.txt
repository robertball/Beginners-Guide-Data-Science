Once I finally got these cooked properly, they were very good, although I can see why some people either cut the hot peppers in half or changed them for something else entirely. I used whole jalapenos, and they were extremely hot, although the cream cheese had the effect of cooling them down. Like everyone else, I had problems with the bacon being too uncooked. Next time will try using the broiler for this. I agree with some of the previous reviewers that these would also be great with regular peppers, tomatoes, onions, or some combination of those. Will try that next time.

I don't like spicy foods so I sauted onion and green pepper in butter. My sister inlaw suggested using a thin sliced piece of roast beef from the local deli would be easier and broil to cook bacon not bake. I cooked even longer than required and it was still uncooked. Evey though they didn't turn out very well, I do have to say that they are delicious and I will work with the recipe to perfect it for myself.  I give the flavor a thumbs up.

I have made these several times and my family loves them.  I buy thin steaks, and for the filling, I cream the cream cheese with diced chili peppers, spread it over the entire steak and then roll them.  I have also creamed the cream cheese with Jalapenos for a spicier meal.  If I have cream cheese left over, I put it on top before I beak it, which makes a nice sauce to go with them.

This was very good! I had some trouble finding bottom round, but when I did I had it tenderized. I also used yellow banana peppers, and only 1/2 pepper (seeds removed) per rollup, which was plenty hot. I salted & peppered each slice of meat before rolling, but it still lacked a little flavor. Next time will add some garlic salt. I also wrapped each rollup with 2 slices of bacon and cooked in the oven.  The bacon didn't get too crispy and no one wanted to eat it that uncooked, so I had to take everyones bacon and microwave it to get it crispy. Next time I will turn the broiler on for a few minutes or cook them on the grill over charcoal. Overall it was good, and didn't really take too long to fix. The next day we broiled the leftovers and the bacon got crispy! VERY GOOD!

We enjoyed this recipe. I gave four stars after looking at the other reviews. I added six cloves of chopped garlic, along with six seeded, chopped Serrano peppers to the cream cheese. I also tenderized the meat, used garlic salt and fresh ground pepper. Good recipe.

Four stars for the actual recipe, five for the potential. Due to the comments of others I used garlic powder and a little celery salt for flavor, but I was concerned with it being too spicy, so I blended some wax peppers with my cream cheese before pouring it on the meat. Maybe using the peppers it calls for would have given it a stronger flavor, as it was still a tiny bit bland. With that being said, the flavor that was there was delicious.

These were the best things I have made from this website so far. I was able to make about 10-12 of these from the size roast I had and went away for the weekend hoping to get some when I got back they were gobbled up in ten minutes so I was told. Also I rubbed the roast with tenderizer, salt, pepper, fresh minced garlic and parsley and put in a bag over night.

I made this for my parents in law to be, with stuffed tomatoes for a starter, i substituted the chili peppers for red, green and yellow regular peppers as they are a bit sensitive on the spiciness of things, it turned out absolutely wonderful! I sevred with potato gratin with an onion sauce (which complimented the steak perfectly) and mushrooms boiled in garlic and white wine.
deliciouso!

Extremely easy to make. I marinated the beef w/ rub made from minced garlic, meat tenderizer, blk pepper and parsley & let sit in bag about 4 hrs. Used raw jalapeños, well seeded w/ veins removed for inside the roll. I baked 20 mins as suggested, but then broiled on low for 10 mins per side to crisp bacon. I was pleasantly surprised that the rolls stayed in tact w/ the toothpicks. Got rave reviews. I will definitely make this again.

I liked the idea more than the specific recipe...  I used thin sandwich steaks followed a couple of others reviewers ideas. For one I creamed the cream cheese in a blender and two I sautéed some garlic and onion instead of the pepper. I laid a couple of spinach leaves down and putt a blob of the cream cheese onion garlic mixture on too then sprinkled with feta and added a couple of capers finally I rolled then wrapped with turkey bacon. After 20 min in the oven I turned on the broiler for the last 5 min to crisp the bacon. I then added olives to the cream cheese mixture (still in the blender) and blended again till just barely mixed and spooned over top for a sauce.

I found this recipe while looking for a unique way to cook steak.  YUM.  I used tenderloin and poblanos.  It was delicious.

I use deer steak with different variations (onions, bell pepper, mushrooms). I also prefer the meat marinated. Best ever!

This only gets 3 stars from me.  I substituted green pepper for the chili's, so maybe that was the problem, but other than that we found this recipe to be just - blah -  Won't be making again any time soon.

This was a nice change of pace for round steak.  I used green, red and yellow pepper pieces in place of the jalapenos and it was excellent.  Fortunately, we buy our beef from a local grower and my round steak is usually pretty tender to begin with.
