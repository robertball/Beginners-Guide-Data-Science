Leave it up to a 20 year old 'shab' to give a recipe for Koushari and run the risk that the 'rest of the world' will never fully appreciate the greatness of this dish!  First, it should be mentioned that the elbow macaroni is not the typical elbow macaroni that most americans use...it is a much smaller version.  Secondly, the onions should be coursely chopped and fried over med high heat in about 1/4 cup of olive oil for about 15 minutes; turning often.  You could season with a little cumin and red pepper, if you like. When the onions are nice and brown, add about 3 Tablespoons of tomato paste them and dilute with about a cup of water and simmer for 5-10 minutes.  Finally, on a large tray, thoroughly mix all of the ingredients together.  (I think some Egyptians actually serve it in layers...but I find that is too much trouble for my large family).  Put the koushari on a serving tray and serve it with a nice arabic style salad, some olives and of course, Jarjeer on the side (argula...in English.  The salad is very important!  Of course, don't forget salt and pepper as you cook.  Thanks greeness024 for letting the rest of the world in on a great dish!

My husband is Egyptian so I decided to attempt this easy dish. It takes a lot of TIME to cook, but it's really easy. He said typically the sauce is pureed, so I blended 1 can tomato sauce, 1/2 chopped cup parsley, 1/2 cup chopped cilantro, 1 tsp of cumin, 3 cloves of garlic & 1 tbsp olive oil, then simmered it for 10 mins. I'm telling you, the flavors seem simple but the dish is AMAZING! The texture with the noodles, rice and lentils is so good. Just be sure to really brown the onions and put on top. Thanks for sharing!!

I followed another reviewer's advise and added 1/2 cilantro and 1 tsp cumin and blended the sauce in a food processor.  Yum!  If I hadn't added the extra seasoning, this recipe would only be 3 stars.  My friend who had lived in Egypt said it was very similar to what she'd eaten there.  Also, put lime or lemon juice on top.  Yum!!!

great recipe. Instead of mixing everything up, I layered (more traditional that way). Really browned the onions and added cumin to the rice/lentil mixture.

good the way the recipe is written, but fantastic with fire roasted tomatoes, and cilantro and cumin on the side.  also, be very careful to FULLY brown the onions and garlic, as that is really what makes this pop!

Great meal!  We served lemons on the side and it added a lot.  It's hard to believe such simple ingredients can have such a great complex flavor. We're picking a country a week to sample a meal from and this was our Egyptian meal.  I'm a veg so it worked great.  All four boys ate it and the 5 yr had three servings!

We love this. Over the years I have changed it just a little. I add cilantro and kalamata olives(sliced) right before serving. I always put the crushed red pepper flakes on the table; just in case anyone wants a little more heat.

I liked this, but I think I liked it better than everyone else. It was a little bland, so I added a little here and there to spruce it up. Had it with naan, and it was good!

This was delicious after the alterations I made. Can't give any real quantities because I just eyeballed it, but I added lots of cumin, salt, pepper and cilantro to the onions and garlic while they were sauteeing. I also added a small can of tomato paste. Blended that all up to make the sauce smooth and I couldn't stop myself from second and third helpings.

I haven't tried this particular recipe although I make Koshari fairly often. I serve the tomato sauce (dakuse) on the side and don't mix it with the onion. I fry the onion to a crispy, golden brown. I mix the rice, pasta and lentils and serve the dakuse and onion on the side. The onion is my favorite part.  I make the dekuse by boiling a can of rotel (choose your level of spiciness), I add a couple of cloves of garlic and then puree it.  This sounds like a strange dish but it is delicious! Great for vegetarians! Glad someone posted it.  BTW: I also cook rice, lentils and pasta separately then mix together.

This was certainly something different, in a good way, it could certainly feed a big family on a tight budget... I am not sure if I will make it again, but it is certainly worth trying at least once.

The flavor and texture of this dish were great.  However, if I make it again, I will double the sauce, as I prefer a less dry dish typically.  Overall, a unique and yummy dish.  I had everything in the pantry so it was easy to throw together.

I made this recipe using orzo pasta instead of elbow macaroni, and added an 8 oz can of no salt tomato sauce at the end (for a double batch) but other than that cooked it exactly as instructed. It came out excellent! Good thing I made a double batch, I can tell this is going to disappear fast!

This recipe is missing a very key ingredient that corrects for the blandness. Egyptians use a spice mix called Baharat, which is a combination of cinnamon, cumin, nutmeg, coriander, pepper, and paprika. Recipes on other websites for Koshari either list the ingredients of baharat or provide a link to a baharat recipe. The baharat is used twice, once as an ingredient in the tomato sauce, and then more is added to each plate to taste. My household ate a helping without realizing the tomato sauce had most of the spices and flavor, and yes it is very bland and starchy without the sauce, spices, and fried onions to provide flavor and texture.

You absolutely cannot leave out the fried onions. Everywhere in Egypt serves this with crispy caramelized onions on top and most places have hot sauce and a garlic sauce that you can add, which makes it better (not as bland).  In fact, whenever I order this in Cairo I always ask for extra onions.

So wonderful! I used tomato paste & veggie stock to thin it out instead of diced tomatoes.  I also added cumin as suggested by another review.

Made this after a friend from Egypt told me about it. This recipe sounded closes to the one she was trying to explain to me. It's actually more filling than it looks/sounds. Our family loves this cheap and tasty side dish with falafel.

This looks SO GOOD that I'm sure it tastes awesome. The reviews helped a lot too. I'll definitely try this during this season, it seems perfect for colder days. Yum! I'll be back with a true review. Thanks for sharing!

Try this for a healthier twist: 
I got confused and used black beans instead of lentils:-)
instead of rice, use Quinoa
Use whole wheat elbow macaroni

Now the trick with delicious Koshary is the sauce that you drizzle on top:
- first, brown the onion in olive oil very very well, when very brown, add the tomato paste/sauce. then add LOTS of crushed red pepper, a dash of cumin, and salt/pepper. after it's cooked and your afraid the onion is going to burn, turn it off and cover the pot. Then in a separate very small saucepan, brown crushed garlic in olive oil. while it is cooking, add some ground coriander. when the garlic is very golden, turn of the flame and quickly splash with a little red wine vinegar and then take the whole thing and splash into the tomato sauce and cover it quickly. After a few seconds, open briefly, stir with a spoon and cover again. Once you've layered the Koshary in the serving plate, drizzle the sauce over and serve immediately.

The authentic Egyptian Koshari is a great street food, and you can find vendors all over Egypt selling it.  Typically, the sauce is served to the side.  Egyptians us ditalini pasta and also add chickpeas.  I soak the chickpeas overnight, and then add them to the lentils to get extra cooking - they will be slightly crunchy.  This does require every sauce pan I own to make, plus my skillet, but the results are yummy!  Jordanian Koshari does not have the pasta.  You can also make this with less rice and more lentils if you are concerned about carbs.  I've seen this made on the streets of Cairo, and they use quite a bit of dried pepper and cumin.  It should have a spicy afterbite.

I was really excited when I first found this recipe because I love the Egyptian culture and was ecstatic that I would be able to sample some of the authentic cuisine from Egypt.  So I was extremely disappointed when this recipe flopped completely at my house. It was just way too starchy and way  too bland.  In fact, I've never eaten something this bland before. No amount of extra tomatoes, garlic,onions or salt seemed to make it any more flavorful, it just made it overly salty.  I feel bad about the poor review, but I will not be making this again.  :(

First off the amount of water to lentils/rice is completely wrong.  I had the original 4 cups of water which was completely gone by the end of the first 25 mins. So when I added the rice I added an EXTRA 2 cups of water.  It still cooked off all the water and burned before the rice was finished.  Further more, the sauce as called for is bland.  I ended up adding tomato paste and curry powder to it before it had any flavor at all.  This dish is also severely lacking in salt!

This was really good and satisfying! I did not have any diced tomatos so what I did was while the onions were cooking I added 2 1/2 tablespoons of hot red pepper paste and after this cooked I added everything together and it was so yummy! The family liked it and so did a couple of my co-workers. Thank You!

I followed this recipes almost exactly with the exception of adding a little bit of cumin to the onions.  Its a good recipe but I really didn't think it was spectacular. I felt like it needed something else.  I'll definitely make it again just because its a simple lentil recipe and I'm always on the look out for new ways to cook lentils.

I tried this recipe, but followed other reviewers suggestions than the printed recipe.  Although I've tried a variety of Middle Eastern and other recipes, this one looked very strange and I was reluctant, however, it was wonderful.  The olives made it spectacular, and I ate it almost bite for bite with salad and olives.  Great dish.  It makes me want to travel to Egypt!  Thank you!

The texture was different, in a good way. But it was kinda tasteless, and very spicey. I followed some of the reviews, and added lemonslices to serve, added cumin and blended the tomatosauce. But this dish wasn't for us.

Sauce was good, I added my own twist of cumin and cilantro.   It still seemed to lack something.. Maybe I'll double up the sauce next time?

The scent of the meal cooking was fantastic, but it came out quite bland actually. That was even after I added a tsp of cumin like some of the other reviews suggested. The recipe needs more tomatoes because the amount of rice/lentils/noodles is far too much which lent to it being bland and a bit dry after mixing it all together. For the look, I would definitely recommend adding some parsley to give it a nicer presentation. Probably won't make it again unless I figure out how to develop the spices into a tastier dish.

Decided that including the elbow macaroni would be excessive carbs: good idea! Recipe is great with fresh tomato and mushrooms added.

This was a good base recipe. It was very bland to me, but Spouse added Kalmata olives and said that improved it dramatically. We'll keep it in the rotation playing with it to give it some supporting flavor.

I followed UmmOmar's instructions (under reviews)..but used 6 tsp of tomato paste and two teaspoons of cumin, added 1/4 tsp. of coriander. Added a bit more salt to taste. For a meatless dish, this tastes pretty good. The texture was a bit soft and some might find it too pasty. My 16 year old son said it was "good" and ate two helpings. We are trying to eat less meat and this meal provides protein with the lentil/rice/macaroni combo. I will probably experiment even more with this recipe in the future. It is healthy and delicious.

Wasn't a big hit. I would have to have authentic Koshari tell the difference. Husband ate it, kids did not and leftovers are still in fridge. Maybe pureeing the sauce will help or maybe more sauce and less noodles? Probably won't make it again.
