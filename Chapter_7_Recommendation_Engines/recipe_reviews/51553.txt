Its very good and moist, and simple enough to make again. TIP - Make sure the chicken is dry, dry, dry before you run it through the wet ingredients. I also use freshly grated parmesan rather than the stuff in the can. I think I can tell the difference.

Tasty!!  I used Italian-style bread crumbs instead of regular.  I also doubled the amount of dijon and evaporated milk and added this to the casserole dish.  Next time, I think I will triple the amount of milk and double the amount of dijon.  Even though I doubled the recipe, it didn't leave me with as much sauce as I had hoped it would have.  One thing to watch out for if you decide to add the excess sauce in with the chicken, I would advise cooking the chicken by itself for a few minutes (to oven-fry it) before adding the sauce...I didn't and the bread crumbs became a little bit soggy.  I also added some sliced mushrooms to the sauce.  I served this alongside some parmesan pasta and fresh veggies....so low in fat and so yummy!!  I will pass this recipe along.

This is a great recipe. To make the chicken moist, I marinated it in the mixture for an hour before cooking.

Simply the best Dijon chicken I've had. I pounded the breasts, used Panko crumbs, and made a light white sauce which included Dijon and mayo to spoon over the breasts. My dinner guests all raved! Another great from Nestle Carnation!

This was pretty good. Hubby didn't care for it much though. I think it was just that he didn't care for the dijon taste.  Be sure to double the sauce. I also marinated my chicken in the mustard/milk sauce for a couple of hours before baking. When baking, I laid my coated chicken in the dish and poured the remaining mustard sauce around the chicken. This kept the topping crisp and the chiken moist.  Ok, but I doubt I'll make it again due to my hubby's distaste. If you like mustard though, give this easy recipe a try!

5 stars because I had everything on hand and it was really quick and easy.  Double the mustard sauce (you can use regular milk too) and the parm/bread crumbs.  I always go overboard on the breading and putting exta sauce on my chicken but my hubby doesn't like it with too much breading.

I liked this...although the taste was a bit strong and the chicken was a bit dried out.  I may take another reviewer's advice and put the mustard milk mixture in the dish while cooking.  Thanks for posting.

Easy and low calorie. Had to use honey mustard and regular low fat milk instead of canned. Tasted great.

I was worried because I was a little short on the dijon mustard but I (and my family-especially the kids), loved this recipe. It was very fast to make, although my chicken breast were vere large, (and took an extra ten minutes in the oven).

It was good chicken. The taste was subtle. I left it in for 30 minutes instead of 20 but other then that, I stuck to the recipe. It would have gotten five stars from me had the taste been a bit stronger.  It's definitely an easy, tasty recipe to try though.  :)

Very good. However, I didn't like opening a can of evap. milk to only use 1/4 of it. After baking for 20 min, the breading was not browned. So, I popped it under the broiler for a few. Served with onion/garlic rice and broccoli with cheese.

mmm! I made this with a cheese and garlic crouton breading and it actually tastes great with honey or dijon mustard. Even with a mixture of both. A little different, but a lot good.

Easy and tasty.  Next time I'll increase the bread crumbs a bit.  I added some extra dijon for dipping.  I baked at 475 for 25 minutes.

WOW!  Oh so simple and delicious!  I pounded the chicken with a mallet and marinated it in the mustard/milk sauce for about 3-4 hours, then breaded and baked.  I used panko bread crumbs, a personal preference.  Tender, moist and lovely flavor.  A real keeper!

I have made this twice now and my fiance and I both love it. I use gluten-free breadcrumbs as I am gluten intolerant and I also used grated cheddar when we were running low on parmesan (still tasted great). As suggested by other members, I pour the rest of the dijon/milk marinade into the pan during the cooking. It means the underside of the chicken is more soggy than the top (which is crispy) but it prevents the chicken from drying out. It's a quick, easy recipe that works well during a busy week.

I was looking for a recipe like the Dijon chicken they used to serve at the Ram and this was it!  I did used boned chicken since my family is picky and they all want to choose if they get legs, thighs, or breasts; I just had to adjust the cooking time.  I found that it had just the right amount of Dijon flavor for my family.  I was worried because Dijon mustard is such a strong flavor but even the kids liked it.

Amazing!!!  Even my picky 5 year old ate this!  I had to do a little improvising though.  Made homemade bread crumbs using sliced bread and spices.  Didn't have any parm cheese.  Doubled the Dijon mustard but used the same amount of evap. milk.  Great flavor and moist!!!  Will make again and again!

I altered the recipe due to gluten intolerance. So instead of using bread crumbs or panko, I just coated the breasts in shredded parmesan cheese. 
Here's what I did:
I used 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream and 1/4 cup dijon mustard mixed together. Then marinated the breasts for an hour in it. 
Then, leaving the breasts coated with the creamy mixture, I covered them in shredded parmesan cheese. Placed two breasts in a greased baking pan, drizzled them heavily with honey, spooned the remaining mixture around the edges of the breasts, sprinkled on some more parmesan for good measure and baked at 475 until no longer pink inside. Scrumptious! The extra sauce is wonderful on the potatoes that can accompany the meal. Be careful the cheese doesn't burn on the bottom though.

We loved this recipe.  I doubled the ingredients and stuffed the chicken with ham and swiss cheese.  It was so moist and delicious  (not to mention quick and easy to make).

Wonderful! Fast, easy and super flavorful. I thought the mustard might be too strong but everyone loved it. The cheese gets a little bubbly and crisp on the bottom and that makes the flavors even better. A keeper!

I really enjoyed this.  I did marinate the chicken in the mixture for about an hour and doubled the milk and mustard to coat everything.  But, other then that I cooked it as directed.  It's a keeper!

We loved it ... my 7 year old had 2nd's!  I had to use skim milk in place of the evaporated and mixed in some stone ground dijon with the regular to get the full amount needed, but it came out great.  I also used panko bread crumbs because its pretty much all I ever use.  Fantastic!

This was a mixed bag for our family.  One person loved it, one person hated it, and one person thought it was okay.  I had a hard time with the breading on the bottom of the chicken just turning into goop and sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Not sure how to combat that.  I'd probably give this recipe one more try and if it still gets mixed reviews it won't be added to the dinner rotation again.

This was really easy to fix and wasn't bad. It just wasn't as good as we had expected. The dijon flavor wasn't too strong either like I thought it would be. Not bad, we all gave this one 3.5 stars.

I gave this 4 stars for being an easy and tasty recipe that my whole family liked.  It's not fancy but everyone from my husband to my 15 month old son liked it.  It was a snap to put together, although I made 2 modifications: italian seasoned breadcrumbs and used chicken breast tenderloins as I think they cook more evenly (I didn't change the cook time and they came out perfect) than whole chicken breasts that can tend to be too thick to cook well.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent! I loved how easy it was to make! I used boneless/skinless chicken breast tenders and they came out surprisingly moist.  I used deli mustard because that is all I had, but the flavor came out great! My teenager wasn’t hungry the following night until she heard we had left over Dijon chicken! Will defiantly make this again.

My husband and I both enjoyed this. I will double the milk/mustard mixture next time and add an extra tablespoon of the mustard. Very good though!! Took about 25 minutes for 3 large chicken breasts to bake. Served this with baked potatoes and salad.

After reading the reviews I tried this using chicken thighs and legs as I didn't have chicken breasts in the freezer.  Also, I used Italian Seasoned bread crumbs, added some pepper to the bread crumb, parmesan cheese mixture, and poured the remaining milk, mustard mixture on top of the breaded chicken then baked at 400 degrees.  This kept the chicken moist and it took only 20 minutes longer to bake.

I substituted evaporated milk with 2%, and it tasted great. The chicken breasts were whole, so I baked it 30 minutes total. This is low in carbs and fat, and I will certainly make it again for guests.

This is a great low fat recipe.  It's not too hard to make and cooks easily.  I poured the remainder of the milk/mustard sauce in the pan and it seemed to keep the chicken moist and flavorful!  I'll make this again!

This was actually really good and really quick and really easy.  I will definitely make this again.  I feel so bad having to waste a whole can of evaporated milk, though, as the recipe only calls for a fraction of what a can will give you so maybe you can substitute with a dry-milk variation or find another recipe to use the rest of your milk with, etc.  Oh and make sure you make more of the breading mixture than what the recipe calls for.  You will probably need it. I followed this recipe exactly and used 3 breasts and ran out of breading mix.... Enjoy!

Simple to prepare & so good! I bake this on a rack, so both sides get crispy.

Excellent recipe! I used full chicken breasts with skin removed. I added lemon garlic salt to the crumbs. I only had skim milk so I added a tablespoon of lowfat mayo to the mustard/milk combo. I left the chicken marinading for about an hour before coating. Nice moist chicken.

Good but we weren't crazy about it either. IF I made this again, I might try an earlier suggestion about pouring the excess milk/mustard mix in with the casserole dish to ensure moist chicken.  Or maybe the problem doesn't lie with the recipe itself but just our tastebuds...maybe we just don't like dijon mustard as much as we thought? Thanks anyways.

This has become a weeknight staple for us; quick, easy, and yummy! My personal preference is to use panko breadcrumbs but, still good if using regular, plain breadcrumbs.

I thought this was great. My husband said "pass the ketchup" so I'll average it and call the rating 4 stars. On top of being flavorful and crispy, it's pretty healthy. I added a little lemon pepper to the crumb mixture. I really didn't taste mustard in the finished dish. I just used 1% milk with the mustard and it came out fine. It took more than 20 minutes for my chicken to be done, but I think the chicken breasts were bigger than 4 ounce. I did check the temperature often and took them out as soon at they reached 160 so they remained tender and moist.

This was pretty good. I did place a dollop of dijon mustard on each plate because the chicken just didn't have a strong enough dijon taste for me!

Pretty easy and the taste was nice.  Different, but nice.  It didnt make dinner super special though. My husband hates parmasean cheese, so I used Shake and Bake for chicken for the breading and it came out great.  I also put minced garlic all around the chicken before cooking it.

This was very easy to make. I'm only giving it 4 stars becaue it WAS a little bland. I doubled the wet ingrediants and let the chicken marinate for about an hour before breading and cooking it. I also used Italian Bread crumbs instead of plain. Next time I'm going to use plain bread crumbs, but add Cajun seasoning to it to give it a spicey flavor. It was still good, and I WOULD eat it again, but I'm a spicy kind of girl as is my husband.

Great recipe! Quick & tasty!  I was afraid the chicken would be dry, so to make sure, I let the chicken soak and marinate in the mustard/milk for an hour before I put it to bake.  It came out juicy and the flavor was really delicious!  My husband raved about it all night.  You have to try it!

I didn't have any evaporated milk on hand, so I substituted in some white vinegar and a splash of milk. I also used sweet & hot mustard and Italian seasoning bread crumbs. Turned out wonderful. I'll definately be cooking this again.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Quick  easy to do. I followed the recipe as is, except that I lowered the oven temperature to 450 degrees to roast potatoes alongside the chicken. The breadcrumbs and cheese mixture added a nice coating to the chicken. The mustard gave it a nice tang.

This was a very easy recipe.  I was surprised my husband liked it so much.  He keeps begging me to make it again.  This one is a keeper.  I changed it a bit by not adding the grated cheese by put the shredded cheese on top. :)
