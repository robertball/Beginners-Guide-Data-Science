My husband is out on the trail often for his job and it is mostly "backpack" style. He loved these and said they are filling, compact, yet tastey. The have just enough sweetness but not over powering. I strongly recomend them just as the recipes calls for them to be made

My husband and I needed some trail bars that weren't so overly sweet that they tasted like candy bars. The store bought granola bars just have way too much sugar.   This recipe was perfect. It's quick, easy to make, and turned out so well, I have to make another batch for this weekend. Everyone ate them before I even got them packaged.   They are sweet to taste, but not cloyingly so. They are very filling, and dense.   I used plain raw almonds, instead of blanched ones, and it was fine. I toasted my own wheat germ, using untoasted (aka the cheap) version. I put it on a baking sheet for 5 minutes at 350F. Perfect.

These are great!  Not too sweet, and completely portable, as long as they aren't being crushed.  I can see many ingredient possibilities with this recipes--sub pecans for the almonds and add mini chocolate chips for a German chocolate version, add chopped dates or raisins for another.  Thanks!

Great taste!  I was out of Wheat Germ, so I substituted an equal amount of ground flax seed.  It adds a different flavor & it tastes great!  Very quick to make. I will shorten the cooking time a tad because my edges were VERY dark.

These camping bars are a great snack around the house and also for long hikes. I added a cup of chocolate chips and a large spoonful of peanut butter. So yummy! The people who I shared them with loved them and asked for the recipe.

My dad an I just got back from a six day backpacking trip in the Beartooth mountains in Wyoming. I had made these before I left because they sounded good and were healthy and full of protein. These ended up being the favorite part of our breakfast every morning. The taste of the orange and the consistency of the almonds and cocoanut made for a fantastic start of our day. I am 100% bringing these on every backpacking trip I go on from now on and at home for my triathlon and marathon training. They are light weight and can be individually wrapped for whatever activity you need a healthy snack on. They helped power is through the day while carrying 60 pounds up and down mountains and are good for any occasion!!!!
