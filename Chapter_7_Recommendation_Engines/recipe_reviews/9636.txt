This cookie is cake-like, nice and soft.  I made two batches for my son's 1st grade class.  The first batch was with good tasty granny smiths, the second was with red delicious.  The granny smith batch was a bit wetter and much more flavorful, while the red delicious batch was very low in flavor.  I recommend using good tasty apples.  I also used butter instead of shortening and 1 1/2 c. of finely chopped apples in each batch.  This was great for the kid's apple fair at school.

I love this recipe.  I just made it for a sick friend.  Did change it a bit, because I cannot see using soo much shortening - it's gross.  I used butter instead...same amount.  And then substituted an oriental pear instead of the apple.  Used Almond slivers instead of walnut.  All the rest was the same.  It came out yummy.

These were WICKED good! I was looking for a good recipe to use leftover apples in.  These bake up really well - the dough puffs out nicely when cooked. GREAT flavor too - nice combo with the nutmeg, etc.

I read all of the reviews before baking these and I adjusted a couple of things. I used 2 tsp. of cinnamon, 1 tsp. of nutmeg and added 1 tsp. of vanilla. Also I found it to be very moist when mixing, so I added another cup of oatmeal.  I really think they turned out great. Moist and flavourful. I gave it 4 stars because of the adjustments.

Fantastic cookies! 
I used whole wheat flour instead of the white flour, added about 2 Tbsp of whole flax seed and 1/4 cup ground flax seed, and instead of the nuts, I just used 1 1/2 cups of finely diced apple. I sprinkled them with cinnamon/sugar before I baked. Turned out great! I'll definitely make these again!

I have been looking for a moist oatmeal cookie recipe for years but have failed until this one caught my eye.  Reading all of the reviews I took their advice and used butter instead of shortening and added chocolate chips too.  Instead of dicing the apples I chopped them in my foodprocesser and my husband RAVED!!  Thank-you so much for this great recipe!

I'm not sure what went wrong with these.  I followed the recipe exactly and I was left with a thick, sticky batter.  When I took them out of the oven they had gotten as big as pancakes and were just as flat. The flavor was bland and dissatisfying.  My family ate them just to be nice, but I will most definitely not be making these again.

These were wonderful cookies.  I did change a few things -- margarine instead of shortening, omitted nutmeg for more cinnamon & added chocolate chips.  I made these for my daughter's Kindergarten class snack and everyone loved them!  I will definitly make these again.

I made these today - I substituted splenda for the sugar, and in place of shortening, I used 1/4 cup butter, and the rest applesauce to cut down on fat/calories.  I doubled the cinammon and nutmeg.  These were awesome cookies!  Next time I'll triple the batch to have some for the freezer.

WELL DONE.  This is a GREAT apple cookie recipe. Easy to make - as you will probably have all the ingredients already on-hand: All you need is to get some fresh apples! When I made these, I didn't think that there was enough dough to hold together all the walnuts, oatmeal and apple. But I was wrong-  they bake up perfectly. I only got 2 dozen out of this recipe instead of the 3 dozen it claims.  I will double this recipe next time. It's a good recipe - great combination of different ingredients make it a wonderful apple spice cookie.

Loved these. Moist and delicious. I didn't have walnuts so used raisins. Had to cook longer than it said and I only got 12 cookies instead of 36 but they were great for my toddler!

These were delicious, however missing something so I added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to give it a little extra flavor.  Make sure you keep in refrigerator afterwards for storage.

This was delicious, it makes a very light and fluffy cookie.  I did add a little more cinnamon than the recipe called for and left out the walnuts, but they still turned out wonderfully.

From the ingredient list and a lot of the reviews, I expected great things from this recipe and was totally, totally disappointed.  I did use butter instead of the shortening but that was the only swap I did from the posted recipe. The batter was very, very moist.  It cooked up flat, stuck to the pan and were rather tasteless especially considering the amount of nutmeg, cinnamon and apples in it.  They easily fell apart as well. I won't make this recipe again.

I made this recipe with the following changes, as suggested by other reviewers:  2 tsp cinnamon, butter instead of shortening, 2 cups of oats and almonds instead of walnuts.  The cookies needed more sugar and were bland.  I won't make this recipe again.

Never made these before. Added butter instead of shotening, and added a TSP of vanilla and 1/4 C of raisins. oh my gosh!!!!! These were more than good! I made homemade whipped cream (which took 2 seconds to make) and that was the icing on the cake so to speak. Will for sure be making these again. The husband and 6 year old kept asking for more.

Yum! Great way to use up some apples.  I used 1 stick of butter as I am a farm girl :)  I chose pecans over walnuts.  I also used some apple pie spice, about a 1/8tsp.  I upped the oats to 1.5 cups.  Cookies rise nicely, kind of like a little apple crisp in a cookie.  Bake a bit longer if you like more crunch.  I topped mine with cinnamon chips and crushed graham cracker crumbs. Great Recipe Laura, thank you for sharing!  These are going to be a favorite, I can tell already! These are really fail proof, change the spices or topping to your personal liking but the recipe itself is perfect!

We really liked these cookies.  I am not a fan of shortening, so I used organic butter.  The next time I make these, I will chop the apples smaller, and perhaps add a few raisins.  It's a great way to use up those apples that are past their eating prime.  Definitely a keeper!

These were delicious! The texture with the apples and the walnuts was lovely. They're fluffier cookies than I expected, but I really like that about them. Easy to make. They smell amazing when they come out of the oven. I've definitely got to bake these again!

Most delicious HEALTHY cookie EVER! The only thing I changed was instead of walnuts I used pecans. I felt they were better suited. I another thing is, that there almost like a bread (in texture). When putting them in the cookie jar they were so moist that they would stick to eachother when I would take out. For a more soild cookie I'm going to leave out for a few hours after I bake. Other then that this recipe is going in the vault forever.

The apples make the dough around it a little wet.  And when you bite into the cookie, it tastes kind of like some hunks of dough didn't get cooked.  Otherwise, very tasty!  The batter will be wet and sticky, but have no fear!  Just drop them onto your pan and they will come out nice!!

I've made this recipe over a dozen times, and I just love it!  I omit the walnuts, and I substituted margarine for shortening because I rarely have walnuts or shortening in the house.  Also, I double the cinnamon because I just LOVE the flavor it adds to these cookies.  They're absolutely delicious!!

very good cookie!  i used 1/4 c margarine and 1/4 c shortening, and switched the rolled oats for "fruit müsli", which gave me an assortment of raisins, nuts, and grains.  light and fluffy, great for the fall!

I really liked the added apple. It gives the cookies the unusual taste (to my mind). Cookies are soft, not crunchy, but that's what my family really liked. No cookies are left for tomorrow, which means next time I will bake double portion!

If you like a crispy hard cookie, pass this one by.  Otherwise it is simply the best cookie I have had in ages.  I substituted pecans and on the last batch added semi sweet choc. chips.  "GREAT"

This recipe is GREAT!  It was quick to make and tastes wonderful!  One of the best cookies I have ever made.  They came out soft and unlike most cookies I've made in the past, they didn't come out flat.  I left out the nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon (personal preference.)

I found them to be a little too cake-like and not crunchy enough. P.S. -- Don't use butter-flavored Crisco -- it turns the cookies a strange color.

I just made these delicious cookies for my toddler and boy I wasn't disappointed!!- I wanted a recipe that was somewhat healthier for him and didn't want the same old oatmeal raisin ones so I tried these. Now my 2 year old usually hates apples but to my surprise he devoured 3 cookies in 10 minutes!!!!!- Definitely a keeper for sure!
The only thing I did differently is I used butter instead of shortening and put about a tsp of vanilla otherwise I stayed to recipe!

This is a great recipe for a moist cookie. My only change was using half a cup of brown sugar and a quarter cup up white sugar. Macintosh apples in my second batch were the best!

I added an additional cup of oatmeal used butter instead of shortening  and a half cup of chia seeds ( trying to be a bit more healthy in this house we are the family that would eat half the batter before we baked the cookies) I also made a simple drizzle frosting for the top .. Powered sugar, milk and a little almond extract ! They were a hit even the very picky 3 year old eat them up

They were nice and moist like cake batter, held together very well, came off the pan very easy and i loved the fact that they wern't so sweet but when i followed the recipe i found that they are tastless and considering all the spices that were added i find it to be a big disapointment and i couldn't taste the apple so next time i make them i will add more of the cinnamon and nutmeg, add some vanilla extract and maybe try a granny smith apple in place of the maccintosh i used.

I substituted butter for margarine, and doubled the oatmeal. I think next time I might try using agave nectar or honey in place of sugar, but this time they turned out great! Delicious.

These cookies have been like crack for me and my son.  I used butter instead of shortening, half a cup of sugar instead of 3/4 a cup, and almonds instead of walnuts (we used the last of our walnuts in some zucchini bread last week).  Yummy!  We called them Michaelmas cookies, but I don't think any will be left come Michaelmas.  We'll have to make more!

I halved the recipe and substituted sugar for Splenda and added a little bit more than what was dictated. The texture was very nice, but the resulting "cookies" tasted like buiscuts. Next time I'll add some vanilla and more cinnamon.

This recipe was just what I needed. We are GF, and SF so I used Pamela's for the flour, GF oats, etc., and a combo of xylitol and stevia for sweetener. Also subbed butter since I do not keep shortening. They do spread a bit more with butter, but the flavor is still good. Not overly spiced nor too apple-ish. Thanks!!

Our family loves these. They are a nice and moist cookie. I made one double batch with shortening and the other double batch with butter. Both are good. But, the next time I make them I'm going to use shortening and add a cup of mini choc. chips. I think it would add even more tast with a little twist. ;-)

I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written and they came out more like little cakes than cookies.  They rise quite a bit and are somewhat dense.  They do however taste very good, the apples and cinnamon go great with the oats.

These are a really flavorful cookie! I used a red delicious apple, and 2 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, no nutmeg. I also substituted raisins instead of nuts and butter for shortening. My batter looked great; I don't know how other reviewers ended up with a too-liquidy batter. They did fall a tiny bit short of what I was hoping for, texture-wise...I love oats, but there seemed to be either too little or too much of them in this recipe -- they don't have that firm texture of a true "oatmeal" cookie. (Also-- This is supposed to make 36 cookies, but I got less than 20 so I must have made them too big!) 15 minutes did the trick for mine.

these were AMAZING!! even my dad who usually doesnt like sweets loved them with a passion and i will definitely make them again. i used butter instead of shortening like the other reviews advised and a bit less nuts and it was great. baking wise, i just let them become golden around the edges, and the result was a cookie with a crispy outside and a nice soft inside

I just pulled these out of the oven 20 minutes ago and they are DeLish!  Not a big nut fan so i added twice the amount of apple and cooked them 7 minutes longer and they were perfect.  Also, didn't have Nutmeg so i used Pumpkin Spice and it was YUMMY.  Husband said that i could make more when ever:)

I wish I could give it 10 stars!  This recipe is so easy, and impossible to mess up.(I forgot mine in the oven for about 5min too long, and they still turned out amazing!)  Not too sweet, and very fluffy. Great "breakfast" cookie. I added extra cinnamon, because I like mine really spicy.  I also made a brown sugar cinnamon glaze for them and everyone thought I spent all day baking!  Next time I will add dried cherries to make a "Michigan oatmeal cookie"

These cookies were very good but not excellent.  Not very flavorful but nice and moist.

Nice cookie!  Very muffin-like, although I think I used quick oats.  If I had read these reviews before I probably would have made some alterations as well (maybe more cinnamon and butter instead of shortening), but still a nice cookie.  Not too sweet, and my 3 1/2 year old loved them! Thanks for sharing :)

I substituted whole wheat flour, Splenda for the sugar and no sugar added applesauce w/ a little Enova for the shortning.  Ended up being a nice South Beach (phase II) snack or dessert.  They ended up a bit dense, but tasty and my 2 year old loved them too!

I didn't like the "cake-like" texture of these cookies as much as others, but the flavor was good.  I liked knowing I was feeding my kids oatmeal, apples, and raisins.  Overall, they were pretty good, but not great.

This is a terrific cookie: moist, not too sweet, a good keeper, and freeze beautifully.
BUT make a double batch as these will not last long.

Good flavor but definitely too cake like. If (big if) I made again I would use 1/2 tsp being powder. I also made a wonderful glaze using powdered sugar and apple cider.

In the oven right now. I had to do 1/4 cup walnuts and 1/4 cup pecans because it was what I had. Added 1 teaspoon of vanilla because it was almost like a reflex I couldn’t ignore to add some vanilla. I also added caramel chips just for fun. Might be a liiiiitle too chock full of goodies with the chip addition, but still DELICIOUS! I can tell they would be delicious without my changes/additions.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I made some changes. I used margarine in place of shortening. Instead of nuts I used raisins and added a bit more cinnamon. I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on Apple's before adding to other ingredients.

I'm sure these cookies would be good without my changes.  I just made changes based on my personal preference. 

These are a nice cake like cookie and very tasty.

I made two versions, one according to recipe and the other "healthier" one which is now our go-to breakfast cookie.  Both are great.

For the breakfast version, I used butter instead of shortening, 1/4 cup brown sugar (instead of 3/4 white), 3 eggs instead of two, and almonds instead of walnuts.  These are a huge hit for breakfast in our household.

I made this recipe and it came out great! I did use oat flour instead of regular flour. I used more apples (I used opal, as those are the ones I really like), oh...and I added cranberries and they came out so good!

Everyone loved these! I subbed in 1/2 cup of butter in place of shortening, 1 cup chopped almonds instead of walnuts, 1.5 tsp of pumpkin spice instead of the nutmeg and cinnamon, and threw in a 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips. Baked for 13 minutes and they were perfectly soft and chewy. Would definitely make again!

These cookies were amazing! I took the advise from most of the comments and made them with butter and not shortening and 2 cups of sliced apples instead of just one. I also added a little applesauce to the mixture before I made them. They came out super moist and my boyfriend wants me to make them again. Would be even more amazing if we had white chocolate chips.

I was pleased with these, but made several changes so I cannot give five stars. I used whole wheat flour, and, as some other reviewers, used 1.5 cups of oats. I also reduced the sugar, using a quarter cup each of brown and white sugar. I also subbed in a combo of butter and natural peanut butter for the shortening. Finally, I added more spices; two tsp of cinnamon plus a dash each of allspice, cloves, and cardamom. I left out the walnuts since I was already using peanut butter. One thing I might change next time is to reduce the salt. However, these are a nice, healthy snack! I got thirty cookies out of these, and with my changes, two cookies have 150 calories with just eight grams of sugar, two grams of fiber, and four grams of protein, and they satisfy my need for a cookie!

I needed a recipe for cookies with apples.  I used this one and the only adjustment I made was a little more cinnamon and no nutmeg.  My hubby likes soft cookies and he loved them.  I will definately bake them again.

After reading reviews, I, too, made small changes to the recipe.  I did not use the nutmeg, but increased the cinnamon  by that amount.  I added 1/4 to 1/3 cup more oats, and 2 snack size boxes of raisins.  I used one small granny smith and one small gala apple, which amounted to 1 and 1/2 cups of finely diced apple.  I also used cooking spray on the cookie sheet and had no trouble at all getting them off the pan.  We like the cookies very much.

Mmm! I used brown sugar instead of white, butter instead of shortening and about 1 1/4 c of quick cook oats and these came out awesome! Think more like an apple bread cookie than a chewy oatmeal cookie.

Came out great, added some extra cinnamon too, like previously posted.  I would recommend getting them off the pan fast, they stick.  I used a small amount of cooking spray after the first two pans, worked much better.

Love the cakey texture. Subbed 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c applesauce for crisco. Might be able to do less butter and more applesauce. Might be able to cut sugar to 1/2 c. I added chocolate chips to some, but I like it better without. I made sure to dice apple really small. I also listened to others and removed cookies from cookie sheet right away.

super moist....delicious but i tweaked it quite a bit since i like to experiment....i added a handful of shelled raw sunflower seeds, some chocolate chips (which i may leave out next time) and i added brandy which i like in cookies and vanilla essence and put only a pinch of cinammon and nutmeg since my husband is too particular. great success! p.s i mixed the apple chunks with the oatmeal so the oats would soften while i prepped the rest!

I just made these cookies, instead of shortening , I used smart balance margarine. The cookies were absolutely delicious!

Really good, my kids loved them.  I added a bit more apple (granny smith) and 1 heaping T. of apple sauce.  Cake like, but not heavy.

I followed the recipe exactly.  These cookies are really good.  It's very important to remove the cookies onto the wire racks within two minutes or so of them coming out of the oven.  Otherwise, they tend to stick to the tray. I will use butter i/o shortening next time.

This recipe is outstanding!  Unlike some reviewers, I did use shortening.  I also doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg, and added 1/2 c. of raisins and 1/2 c. of crushed sliced almonds instead of the walnuts.  They are easy, delicious and disappear fast!

I made these cookies exactly to recipe using Jonagold apples.  When I put them into the oven, they melted into a single sheet of goo.  What a horrible mess! It took forever to clean the mess up.  I should have read more than the top two reviews, because scrolling down now, I see this had happened to other users.

My husband loves them! Like others, I used butter instead of shortening and added roasted flex seeds and more oats for some crunchiness. The cookies do not look cookies, but taste really good!

These were fantastic.  I added 3/4 cup caramel bites, and it was heavenly.  I tried making them without all of the oatmeal and I would not suggest doing this, they were to creamy.  But if you are short on oatmeal, double the dry ingredients and they will turn out fine.

These are easy, moist, yummy, and can be fudged if you don't have exactly the right proportions. I've made them several times with the Spartan apples from my tree and oh boy, they disappear so fast!

Followed the recipe except for the nuts and these cookies came out Perfect, Moist and Delicious!  I put the apples in the food processor, but I think it might be better to have chunks instead.  I will definitely make these again!

These were ok when they came out of the oven. They were pretty cakey as others mentioned.  They turned really gooey the next day in the cookie jar and all stuck together in a big gooey-apple mess.

i dunno what happened with the one's who disliked this recipe.  i used this recipe as a fun project to do with my 10, 7, & 5 yr olds today.  i WILL say that i added an extra tsp of cinnamon, but that's only cuz i'm a "cinnamon finatic"!  i thought it was easy enough to do with kids, yielded exactly what it said it would, n the kids thought they tasted great!  (i did too)  i WAS skeptical too about the consistancy.  but i figured i would trust it this once...i'm glad i did n didn't add more oats.  they baked just fine, n came out soft n delicious.  i will use this recipe again...prob for thanksgiving.  thanx for the great recipe!

The nutmeg flavor is too much. I followed the recipe exact, but the dough was way too wet. I had to add almost 2 cups extra oats. The texture was ok - kinda cakey, but I won't make this again.

If you are not looking for an extra sweet cookie this is a good choice. It is rather bland and does not have an explosion of flavor but I still think it is a good tasting cookie. I made it with the shortening and I think they came out wonderful! My 4 year old daughter loves them. All in all a great way to make use of some apples that are sitting around!

These are about the worse cookies I ever tasted.  They are bland (as was said in another review.)  They are gummy.  They taste like they are missing something.  I even added raisins to mine and almost another cup of oats.

These cookies are sooooooooo DELICIOUS!  I think this is my new favourite cookie recipe.  I made a couple alterations though.  I used butter instead of shortening, and raisins instead of walnuts.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I used 1/4 cup margarine and 1/4 cup shortening instead of 1/2 cup shortening like suggested and omitted the nutmeg in favor of more cinnamon... thought the cookies tasted too bland, very soft and crumbly... was disappointed!

These were good, but nothing special. The oatmeal cookies I usually make are better.

I've made these twice.  First time they were good; this time great!  Difference is the type of apple, I think.  Try using a Fuji as they are very juicy and don't turn to mush in the cookie.  A keeper for us! Thanks.

This batch made 3 dozen, and they only lasted about 3 hours.  They are soooooo good!
