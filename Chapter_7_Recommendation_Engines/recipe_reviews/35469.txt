I don't understand all the bad reviews.  My 5yo daughter loved this dinner.  I made it with 2 cups of rotini and used chicken broth instead of wine.  The entire family and dinner guests thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  We served it with crusty buttered bread to soak the sauce up with and it was delicious!

Sauce was too rich - too cheesy with definite wine taste!!  It overwhelmed the chicken and pasta, instead of accenting it. I would have preferred macaroni & cheese to this for less cost and better flavor!

I tried to stay true to the recipe but sub what I had on hand to keep the food budget down. I browned raw cubed chicken breast in a little evoo/butter before proceeding with the recipe. I didn't use as much butter/flour as called for, just a teaspoon of each that I cooked to a light brown before adding the milk, cream cheese, milk and wine. The cream cheese I used was Philadelphia's cooking cream, which made it SO much easier to work with. I used French's chardonnay dijon mustard, omitted the extra salt and I added a teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder and couple good shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. The cheddar cheese I used was extra sharp. The flavor of this casserole was out of this world BUT our issue with it was it was REALLY thick. REALLY thick. And kind of gummy. I think this would be excellent if it had a little more milk, maybe about a half cup or so. Then it might be perfect. My kids absolutely loved it, thickness aside. I'll make this again. I served steamed broccoli on the side but next time, I might just stir it in. I think it would be a great all-in-one casserole dinner.

I first made this using the original recipe and it was ok.  The second time I made it I left out the nutmeg, used Honey Mustard instead of Dijon and used 2 Tblsp. of white wine and 2 of chicken broth.  Also cooked chicken chunks in butter, seasoned with salt and pepper.  Used the left over broth to simmer chicken in once it was browned.  Also added a little minced onion and was very generous with the rotini.  Family loved it this way.

I thought this casserole was rich and delicious.  I served this up for a Sunday dinner, adding mushrooms and broccoli florets to the casserole to round it out.  The cheese sauce was comforting but was different than normal due in part to the wine.  I used penne pasta, and would recommend a tube pasta with ridges to hold and soak in the cheese sauce.  This doubled easily and the leftovers were just as tasty.

This was delicious!  I added 1/2tsp of fresh ground black pepper a package of frozen mixed vegetables and doubled the pasta.  It was a lot of work but this is a new family favorite!

This didn't turn out very well for me and I'm not quite sure why.  It seemed kinda pasty or something... perhaps too much flour?  It was too rich and heavy, as well.

I noticed when making this recipe the rotini seemed like a very small amount but made it as specified anyway.  My boyfriend and I still liked it very much.  I noted before adding this review that it should have been more rotini after all!  I would make it again but leave out the wine and mustard and possibly even use more pasta than the 2 cups uncooked specified.  Very rich tasting cheese sauce.

Not sure why the negative ratings - my boyfriend walked in and glanced at the recipe while I was cooking and said "oh...so it's like mac n cheese with chicken".  The ingredient list and directions make it pretty clear that's what this is.

It is a thick rich sauce, but very good as far as my family thought!  I skipped the wine since my kids don't like anything flavored with wine and I thought this might taste too much like it.  I used chicken broth instead.  I skipped the nutmeg and the parmesan (I don't like them), and added extra crackers on top.

Very tasty and comforting on a snowy winter day.  It made our menu rotation!

This was a great recipe!  However, it was a little dry, almost thick.  There really wasn't any sauce to speak of.  I think next time I will add a little more chicken broth (my substitute for the wine) to thin out the sauce before pouring it over the chicken and pasta.  Excellent recipe!!!

Delicious.  I made it without the wine, mustard, and nutmeg (because I didn't have them handy) and substituted a quesadilla cheese mixture for the cheddar and it was still fantastic.

To me this was a glorified mac and cheese.  A lot of work for nothing spectacular.  My 2 year old daughter cleaned her plate which is always pleasing, but I probably would'nt make this again due to all the time and work.

Too much of a flour taste in the sauce and too leavy of a sauce too.  If I wanted this type of dish again, it would be must easier, and less expenive, and (I think) better tasting to make a "premium mac & cheese w/ spiral noodles" from a box and just add my own chicken.  But layer it and do the topping as suggested here in this recipe.

Way too much sauce--and a rich sauce too.  Add more pasta and chicken.  Suggest adding mushrooms.  I probably won't make it again--there are too many other cheese and pasta recipes to try.

My family liked this.  I too skipped the wine and used chicken broth instead.  I would recommend a scant tablespoon of mustard...the taste was too strong for me.  I also doubled the pasta and chicken.  We will make this again.

This was not for our family.  I made the recipe exactly as stated.  There was way too much sauce for the amount of chicken and rotini.  The sauce was way too pasty.  3 cups of cheddar cheese seemed like an awful lot but I added it and it really does not need that much cheddar.  Needless to say my family did not eat this and it all went to waste.

This was quite complicated to make and rather disappointing.  It was too thick and not creamy.  I doubt I'll make it again.

Fantastic!  Can be made without the butter crackers and additional butter (in the topping) for a little less fat and its just as good.

I added more milk cause many said it was dry.  It was still dry. The sauce tasted really good until I reluctantly added half the called for amount of nutmeg, and for me it ruined the flavor.  I won't make this again!!!

This tasted all right with a very VERY rich sauce, but make sure and check out the nutrition info before you make!  Good Lord!!!  You could gain 10 whole pounds from just one serving!  Not at all healthy.

My husband loved this!  I substituted the low fat cream cheese and sprinkled a little more cheese on top when I backed it.  The only thing though (a mistake I made) is used White Zinfandel for the white wine which I thought gave it a funny taste, next time I need to use a dry white or omit it.

There was way too much sauce. I could hardly find, let alone taste the chicken or spirals. A lot of good cheees were used, but after adding the other things the sauce tasted like a jar of cheese whiz....sorry, we will not use this recipe again

I thought this was really good, but it takes more than 30 minutes "Prep Time" to make.  Slight changes I made:  I only used half the cream cheese as I felt guilty using that much.  Didn't bother with the wine or the nutmeg.  I added a little brocolli, too.  I think the amount of cracker topping is a little on the skimpy side, so I added more crackers.  
Very cheesy and a very good flavor.

Just made this recipe I switched it up a bit but it was really good. I did not add the wine, mustard or nutmeg and I used 12 oz of cream cheese instead of 8. I also sauteed the chicken in some onions and garlic and added in some frozen veggies. Will definitely make this again and again!

This recipe was not very good.  My husband & I both agreed that the taste is not at all what we expected.  He thought the sauce was too cheesy & think.  I think the wine made it stink & left a bad taste in my mouth.  I will not make it again.

Sauce seemed to thick.  Did make a lot.  Warm the milk before adding to speed up the sauce.  When adding ingredients to make a sauce/remove from heat to help make a smooth sauce without lumps.

We love this recipe.  I mixed it all together and then put it in the pan and used ziti(because that is what I had),  I also added a jar of pimentos, it just seemed rather colorless, but after adding the pimentos I noticed that it looked better and they added flavor.  I will make this again.

My teenage son isn't usually into casseroles but, second only to pizza and cheeseburgers, this is his favorite meal! It's a flavor step up from more traditional mac'n'cheese recipes and the crunchy topping adds interest as well.

My older daughter called this "the best macaroni & cheese ever!"  I made it pretty much as written, though I do think I would add more pasta next time around.  It seemed a bit light with just a smidge over 2 cups.  I think I probably did throw in more chicken and cheese than called for.  We didn't find the mustard or wine overpowering at all - but then I usually do add mustard powder when I make a cheese sauce, so they're used to the taste.  Will be making this again, especially when I have cooked chicken to use up.

So good but so heavy!  Good for a cold winter meal. I didn't have cream cheese or butter crackers, so I subbed sour cream and cheese-its. Will make again but will try and make a healthier version. Hard to enjoy knowing how much fat is in it.

We loved it. I did use the measurements as stated above however I did heat the first few ingredients and then turn down the heat to add the cheese, mustard, and wine. It seem to be just enough to cook off the wine taste a few disliked. We also just added our veggie to it and baked it just to make it a one bowl meal. We will be adding to the menu more often. It is really rich and cheesy

It's kind of a bland meal. Really tastes like dull mac and cheese.
