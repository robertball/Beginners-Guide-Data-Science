This recipe was so simple that I kept on passing it up - didn't seem much different than a lot of other roasts that I make.  Well I was wrong - this gets 5 stars along with some of my other pork favorites!  Made no changes other than to put the seasonings on the meat and wrapped the meat in plastic wrap for a few hours 
(I do that with a lot of my roasts if I have time so that 
the flavor seeps in).  I also put slits into the roast and inserted slivers of garlic in the slits (which I always do 
with pork roasts - my preference).  I decided to follow 
Vini's cooking directions exactly and my 3 lb. pork 
roast was cooked PERFECTLY!!!  Just slightly pink - as 
it should be!!  Soooooo moist.  Also decided to make 
the gravy as Vini suggested rather than doing it my 
way which is work intensive and sometimes can be a 
disaster if you are cooking other things at the same 
time.  Vini's gravy was EXCELLENT - Novice chefs will 
love his recipe for gravy - you can't go wrong! Since it 
was Columbus Day and everyone had to work except 
for me I made this roast and all the trimmings - 
mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, Stove Top Pork 
Stuffing, Asian style green beans, the last of the 
summer tomatoes, and apple sauce.  Well we feasted that night - and just like Thanksgiving - we enjoyed the leftovers the next night since the meat remained so moist!  Thanks Vini!

Vini, I don't know how you came up with this recipe... but we think it is most definitly 5 star. I had a 3.25 # roast and checked at 90 minutes, and it was to right temperature. We are cutting carbs so I left out the cornstarch and went for some more flavoring for a "gravy".  I added some broth and some red wine vinegar and boiled it a few minutes with the left over juices and added water. I served by slicing (very important to let it "rest" for about 10 minutes before slicing) into 1/2 thick slices and pouring the thin sauce over and letting it set in the juices covered in a warm oven while I made side dishes. Wow! moist and great flavor. Thank you, for probably the best recipe I have tried(And I have tried QUITE a few) on this website.

We thought this was excellent. I was running late and didn't make the gravy, but it was delicious without. I will definitely make this again (next time with the gravy). I also added some potatoes to the pan to roast along with the pork.

One of the best pork loins I've made.  Save yourself an "outside" piece.  The spices form a delicious crust which counterpoints the meat and is just fabulous.  I followed the roasting instructions to the "T."  My four pound roast finished in almost exactly two hours and the inside meat temperature was 160.  The meat was a little pink on the inside, which I fixed with a brief stop in the micro.  The gravy was simply tremendous--like I knew exactly what I was doing (I didn't have a clue).  I served this with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes, available on this website, Bavarian sauerkraut, garlic bread sticks, and tossed salad with homemade blue cheese dressing.  You bet I deserve a medal!

Too salty.  Next time I will cut back on the salt and the cornstarch.  The gravy needed something....maybe some garlic powder?  Good recipe with some minor adjustments.

i bought a pork shoulder butt roast (yeah i know that sounds like an oxymoron or whatever) at the grocery store and was just looking for some simple seasoning recipe that i could do quickly with stuff i had. i looked at this and 'herb roasted pork loin and potatoes'. i put the sage in a bowl and smelled it and it just smelled like thanksgiving stuffing, so i added onion powder, garlic powder, sea salt and fresh ground black pepper until the seasonings smelled good, then i rubbed it all over the meat and cooked it at 350 for 30 mins per pound. when it was done i immediatly wrapped it tightly in foil and placed it on a dish in the microwave while i finished everything else. *****the tip i have for the gravy is to mix the water and cornstarch in a salad dressing shaker then add to the drippings, that way your gravy has no lumps!!!***** i served this with homemade mashed potatoes and sliced up apples into a frying pan with some butter, brown sugar and lemon juice (i read that on the other recipes suggestions) oh with some dinner rolls and a salad this was one of the best meals ever! i will use a pork tenderloin next time but oh my god! this is now a family favorite!!!

I loved this! I rated a 4 due to the salt. Next time, I will cut amount in half. But that just affected the trim of the roast. I almost skipped the gravy because I was so hungry & in a hurry but glad I didn't. (I don't know what browning sauce is so that didn't make it in.) Even though the pork was tender, it added just the right amount of flavorful juiciness to boost the meat. Easy & my fiancee was "wowed!" Paired with easy mashed pots & buttery spinach with mushrooms/tomatoes made a Sunday-best meal. Thanks Vini!

I've used this recipe over and over again.  It is a bit too salty for our taste so I cut that back a little.  Otherwise, I'd give it five stars.  I don't make the gravy.

A great recipe!  I added red potatoes to the roasting pan instead of going to the work of mashed potatoes and it turned out great.  For side dishes I made glazed carrots and apple/cabbage kraut (with caraway seeds).  Everyone raved and I was asked for the recipe... which is the best compliment of all.  The only change I will make next time is to reduce the amount of salt.

I thought I had lost this recipe.  It was passed to me by a friend.  Every time I made a pork roast,  l looked for it to no avail.  Today, I saved and printed it.  I reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp and follow the rest of the recipe exactly.  I love carrots and a green vegetable with it.

This roast was fabulous.  The best pork loin I ever made.  I had a 2.88 pounder that I tied.  I baked it for 1 1/2 hours and let it rest while I made the gravy.  It was cooked to perfection.  I didn't have browning sauce but I used the drippings and 1/2 and 1/2 apple cider and vegetable broth and thickened it with the cornstarch.  I added a few more seasonings to it but it was good.  The real star was the pork.  I did use fresh sage instead of dry and I drizzled a little EVOO over the top so it wouldn't dry out.  What great flavors together.  Thank's for this great recipe!

I loved this simple and delicious rub! The caraway was a welcome departure from the spices I typically use and was a beautiful compliment to the pork. The cooking directions were spot on and it was so nice to have gravy and potatoes. So often I cook meat and potatoes but don't have the drippings for gravy.

Good flavor, although I had to sub rosemary for the caraway seed so will try again with caraway.  I followed reviewers' suggestions and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Used beef broth instead of water in the gravy for more flavor since I didn't have browning sauce.  Would definitely make this again!

Very nice!  Like others, I mostly left recipe alone.  Didn't have browning sauce and didn't need it.  I did put slits in roast and added chopped garlic.  Then I added garlic powder and olive oil to the spices, spread the paste on roast a few hours ahead, wrapped it in saran, and tada--our family was pleasantly surprised at how much they enjoyed caraway.  It was flavorful and moist--and as the cook, you should definitely sample an outside piece too!

Tasty pork roast.  Served the gravy on top of mashed potatoes with some sour cream & garlic.  Yum.  The only change I'll make next time is to use less caraway seed.  My husband doesn't like them so much.

This was really succulent.  I did make the gravy but because there were so little pan drippings, the gravy was kind of lame.  The pork truly did not need the gravy, and even obscured the wonderful flavor of the rub. I did cut the salt back to a tsp - it was still a touch salty.

This was an excellent reipe for pork loin. I took the recommendations of the other reviews and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. It was just right. I roasted it on a rack for the recommended time, but at 350F. We loved it. The slight crust that formed was very tasty and the meat was moist and tender.

This was  one of the best pork meals I've made.  It  was different than the Rosemary I usually use.  I served it with German Cabbage.  I would submit that recipe if I knew how.  It was the perfect side dish to serve with it.  I will makethis meal over and over agian.  We are looking forward to the leftovers.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was bland, and didn't brown at ALL in the oven - so it looked undercooked, even though the internal temp registered oterhwise. I don't think I'll make it again, but in retrospect, I wish I would have browned the meat before tossing it in the oven. Tender, but low on taste and even lower on visual appeal.

Good pork roast, but wish I had read the suggestions before preparing.  One and one-half teaspoons for a 3-lb roast is too much salt. Ended up cutting away the crust.  This, of course, affected the overall taste.

Nice tasting roast.  Delicious gravy -- I didn't have the browning sauce, so I added a tiny amount of beef-flavored Better Than Bouillon for color and more flavor.

I made this tonight. Pork roast was on sale at the grocery store, so I bought it without even knowing how to cook it. I followed this recipe, and added a little rosemary as well. The family ate the whole 3-lb roast in one meal!

We do love this unique flavor! Something different but tasty is always welcome at the table.  I gave this 5 stars all the way accross the board! My kids eat just about anything, no picky eaters allowed! So, my kids are rare but if it was really bad they would have said so.  We give this thumbs up!!

This is probably the best tasting pork roast I have ever eaten. I almost added some garlic because that is the norm for pork but I followed the recipe and I am glad I did.

Very happy that I tried this!  I doubled the spice rub ingredients, except for the salt-I used 2tsp salt.  I also used beef stock instead of water for the sauce.  Paired with mashed potatoes and steamed baby carrots.  Was fantastic and super MOIST!  I normally stay away from cooking pork, but this will be on my dinner table monthly now! MMMM!

This recipe was wonderful! Make sure you cut salt by half at least, but we just love this.
