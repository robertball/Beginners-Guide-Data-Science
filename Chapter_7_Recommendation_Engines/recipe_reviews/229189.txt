Any flavored vodka is great in this drink but it's also good with a shot of both flavored vodka and Whipped Vodka. It tastes like an adult version of a cream soda.

I tried this with chilled vanilla vodka and a lime slice. Very refreshing on a hot summer night. I definitely want to try this with citron or raspberry vodka as other reviewers recommended.
