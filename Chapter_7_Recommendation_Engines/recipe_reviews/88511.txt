Excellent...a little sweet and salty that added so much flavor to the spinach.  My husband really enjoyed and thought he was at a gourmet restaraunt.  Will definetly have this on a regular basis.

I loved this.  I rotate back and forth between this recipe and Jamies Cranberry Spinach Salad from this site to get my daily spinach in. The dressing is kind of thick and jelly like, so you can simply add more olive oil to get it the right consistency.

This recipe is wonderful!!!  I made it for my supper club and everyone raved!  I substituted Feta for the Goat cheese and put the dressing on the salad while it was still a little warm so it wilted the lettuce a little.  Great Recipe

Loved this. I added granny smith apple, red onion, and candied pecans instead of walnuts. Everyone have loved this.

A lady gave me a jar of home made pepper jelly for Christmas, and I was trying to find a way to use it up, since I really didn't like it that much.  I found this recipe, and the dressing was fantastic!  In my salad, I used crumbled blue cheese, pecans, and even added some diced tomatoes and a small onion.  It was so good, like the kind of salad you would get at a gourmet restaurant!

This is absoulety one of the best recipes ever for spinach salad! The only alternation I made was to use mozzerella cheese- we aren't fans of goat cheese. Wonderful flavors together!

We loved this, and it went perfectly with the crab cakes we had that night (makes a good sauce to pour over meats and fish, too). I used feta cheese and chopped candied almonds, and I poured it warm over the spinach to wilt it a little like a previous reviewer said- delicious!

I love the dressing.  I usually make my own dressings because I don't like too much vinegar.  I love pepper jelly and I never would have thought to make a dressing with it.  I used feta because I don't care for goat cheese, pecans because I'm out of walnuts, and I also added some red pepper to the salad.  Very quick and tasty.

I used Braswell red pepper jelly for this recipe and just didn't cut it for me.  Not enough flavor to the dressing; bland and oily would be my description of the results. Used this mixture as the base and added the vineager and spices from Jamie's spinach salad dressing and made a nice recovery.

This recipe did not go over well at my family gathering.  It was too oily & the jelly did not mix well.  I would not make it again.

Okay, so I tweaked the ingredients (red grapes, toasted pecans, dried cranberries and blue cheese), but it's clearly the unique dressing that sets this salad apart from other spinach salads out there. Awesome! Will definitely make again (and again).

Very good and easy recipe.  Made it last night for a dinner party (some of which were extremely picky eaters) and they all liked it.  I used a good quality feta cheese instead of the goat cheese and used big pieces of walnuts which made a really pretty presentation in a clear glass bowl.  I also didn't have any dijon mustard, so I used honey mustard instead with a little horseradish mixed in.
My last homemade batch of red pepper jelly didn't thicken as much as I wanted it to, so it was perfect for this recipe.
I just didn't have to add as much olive oil to thin it out.
I think it's a recipe that will be easy to tweak with whatever cheese or nuts you have on hand so I'm sure I'll be making this one over and over again.

This was a hit!  I added much more spinach than the recipe called for b/c there was too much dressing.  I toasted pine nuts and we loved the sweet yet spicy flavor!  A very easy recipe to score big points!

I've made this recipe several times and always receive rave reviews.  The dressing is easy and wonderful on any spinach salad.  I use often with whatever I have on hand, berries and purple onion as well as feta and blue cheese can easily be substituted.  Thanks so much for sharing, this is a winner!

I did not think this made a good salad dressing; there was no flavor other than that of sugar and my pepper jelly is pretty warm & toasty (jalapeno).

Fantastic. Makes enough dressing for at least double the spinach. I used pomegranate pepper jelly and pan toasted my walnuts.

This is by far the best Spinach Salad recipe.  You can mix it up also.  Try adding crisp apples and cranraisins.  You really need to use homemade pepper jelly also.  I will post a non-fail pepper jelly that is to die for.  Thanks for this awesome recipe

Who knew!? This dressing is the star of the show. Any self respecting southern girl always has pepper jelly in her frig. and now we have something to do with it besides spoon it on top of cream cheese. The only thing I added to this amazing new twist on spinach salad was leftover grilled chicken breast. Terrific light supper. Thanks! My husband loved it...said not to lose this one.

What a great salad! The dressing is amazing, and I've also used it on just a regular old romaine salad. Lots of compliments from guests. Sweet and surprising! I would suggest adding more olive oil than called for, as it's rather thick otherwise. Thanks for he recipe -- I'll use a lot, I'm sure.

I was compelled to write my 1st review ever after having this amazing salad...BEST spinach salad ever!! As I'm allergic to walnuts, I made some candied cashews instead which I chopped for the topping, and also threw in some dried cranberries. Wonderful combination of textures and sweet/ tangy flavors.  Looked and tasted like a high-end restaurant salad.  Served it at a dinner party and all my guests raved over it.  VERY easy and quick to make too.   Thanks for the inspiration Sarah! Would give it more stars if I could.

This salad was delicious! I used my own pepper jelly with feta cheese and pecans as someone suggested. My husband also liked it, and he doesn't even like pepper jelly (I didn't tell him I used it).

I made a few additions to this salad, to make it more like the traditional spinach salad - red onion, sliced mushrooms and sliced hard boiled egg. This dressing is fantastic, the flavors work so well together, and I love the use of the walnuts and goat cheese! Cant wait to make this again!! A new favorite!

Really different!  I made this for our lunch today, and since the kids weren't here, used hot pepper jelly.  Delicious!!  The goat cheese cancels the heat and tastes great.  Also makes an impressive presentation.  I served this with canned soup, and lunch came together in less than 10 minutes.  In the South, we always had pepper jelly poured over a brick of cream cheese to eat on crackers at holiday parties.  I was excited to try this because pepper jelly reminds me of Christmas! Will make again and again!

This was absolutely delicious, and so wonderfully simple! I used blue cheese and chopped cashews and almonds because that's what I had on hand, plus I added some arugula, and the flavors combined beautifully. This will become a regular in our house, not only because it's so easy but also because it lends itself to variety. UPDATE: I served this at a family reunion as part of a meal that was prepared by a gourmet chef, and it got raves right along with the gourmet dishes. (I used habanero jelly, which has become my favorite.)

Wonderful!  I substitued sunflower seeds and pecans (another time I used toasted pine nuts) for the walnuts and used a bit of Gorgonzola instead of goat cheese.
It was a huge hit.  I made the dressing ahead of time and then just warmed a bit before applying to the salad and then topped with the seeds and nuts!
Thanks for this recipe! Like another reviewer, I also love Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad.  I will alternated these two winners!

I had a fantastic spinach salad with pepper jelly dressing at a restaurant and had to find a recipe! This is very similar. Loved it! But loved my "tweaking" better. I subbed goat cheese for gorgonzola and walnuts for toasted pecans, which is a change I will keep. I also added sun dried tomatoes (because the restaurant version had them) and they were ok. I added just a touch of the mustard, which I could hardly taste. There is milder or spicier pepper jelly, I thought milder was better. The kick of the cheese gave it a great sweet and salty taste. LOVED this salad! Thanks!

I can see the potential in this salad. I love all the components. However, I thought the dressing was way to oily and the flavor of the EVOO overwhelmed the flavor of the pepper jelly. I need to fuss with this a bit to make it more to my tastes. Less oil and maybe some vinegar?  I think I will try cayenne spiced walnuts in the salad for a bit more punch.

This dressing was great. It was really different and would add loads of flavor to any dark leafed salad. I did expand on the salad, using more veggies that I had handy and the dressing was still the star.

Great concept; I love pepper jelly and will happily put it on anything I'm allowed to.  And the spinach/goat cheese/walnut combo is always a winner.  For me, personally, I thought the proportions in this particular dressing were a bit off; there's either too much oil or too little of everything else, and the result was that the zing of the pepper jelly was more muted than I would have liked.  Next time I'll try adding half the oil and twice the mustard.  EDIT:  Made it again, with the called-for amount of mustard and a very scant tablespoon of oil, and the pepper jelly was still drowned out.  More mustard would just have made it taste more like mustard.  I still love the idea of a dressing with pepper-jelly flavors, but I think for me, it's back to the drawing board.  Thanks anyway, though!

This was surprisingly good.  I too had some pepper jelly to use up, and this dressing recipe is fantastic.  The whole salad is good, and lends itself to many modifications.  Thank you Sarah!

I used habanero pepper jelly and loved it.  I ommitted the salt and goat cheese.  Next time I will use less oil and feta cheese.  This was suprisingly good; I will make this recipe again.

I love this recipe!  I made it for my boyfriend for part of his 5 course birthday dinner and I have to say it was the best salad I have ever eaten!  I used cranberries and bunch of extra walnuts!  Yum! I'm actually going to the store to make it agian tonight.

I thought this was really good and really easy to make!  I've made this a few times now and still love it.  The only thing that I would recommend (and this is purely personal taste) is to add a little less than a teaspoon of water to the dressing mixture before you put it in the microwave to heat up.  Without the water, I thought the dressing was a little too sweet and too syrupy.  I also used the hot pepper jelly instead of the mild for a little kick.  It's great!  Exactly like a salad I order from a nice restaurant I go to.....now I don't have to go out to get it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Outstanding!  Served this over spinach topped with toasted almonds and bleu cheese & made one of the best salads we've ever had.

Next time I will heat the pepper jelly a bit to liquify it and get more of a dressing-like consistency.  Thanks - a true keeper!

I did not care for the pepper jelly dressing as it's listed; it was far too sweet.  I used red pepper jelly and the rest of the dressing ingredients as listed, but I added balsamic and white wine vinegars and more mustard.  I substitued pecans for walnuts and added fresh red pepper sliced.

Followed your directions exactly. Used a red pepper jelly in the dressing which was eye-pleasing against the green spinach leaves. Very tasty change from ordinary tossed salad.

Very good stuff. I found it strange but that's probably because I've never had goat cheese before! So once I acquire that taste, I'll definitely be making this salad again.

This was YUMMY and went over very well at a dinner party I had last weekend.  I used "medium" jalepeno jelly and feta cheese -- and added a handful of craisins to the salad.  I made a big batch for 6 people and every last bit of it was gobbled up.  If I hadn't had dinner plans for the next night I would have stopped at the store for more spinach and made this again, that's how much I liked it.  Definitely a keeper -- THANKS!

Really good - but I also used the hot pepper jelly which I think would be much better than the mild.  Also used crumbled feta.  I think some thinly sliced red onion would be good, I'll add next time.

I had to adapt the salad to ingredients on hand.  I used Cranberry Jalapeno Jelly and crumbled Feta Cheese.  I also used toasted slivered almonds.  I used at least 4 cups of spinach leaves.  My husband and I just loved this.  We loved Spinach Salads and this one was a nice change.  We served this with Blackened Catfish and the sweetness of the salad compliment the spicy heat beautifully.

This was great!  I used green pepper jelly which made it somewhat sweet.  I also used feta and pine nuts since that is what I had but I'll be anxious to try it with goat cheese, which I absolutely love!  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipe.  I had "pomegranate" hot pepper jelly, and I used that and added some pomegranate to the salad.  It was easy, and quick!

Very delicious. Hint - serve salad as soon as possible after dressing, and you may not want to use all the dressing as in the recipe. The taste is unique and tantalizing, the recipe is easy. Anyone should try this!

Yes!  This is Great!  I think it needed to sit overnight to develop the best flavor.  I will make this my new Spinach Dressing!

Absolutely delicious! I added crisp diced bacon to the salad. I already plan to make it again for Christmas Eve dinner.

I made this and the dressing with the pepper jelly is very good with the salad.  I did add some water chestnuts, red onion, and hard boiled eggs to the salad.  I feel like it's much better for you than a heavy bacon dressing.

Good but not enough flavor made to recipe.  We added cayenne pepper.

It was a hit at my dinner party.  I added some red wine vinegar  and lots of fresh pepper to give it a boost. Also very thin red pepper too.
