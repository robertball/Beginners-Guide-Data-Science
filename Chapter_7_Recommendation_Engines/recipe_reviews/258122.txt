This was a delicious appetizer and looked very nice on the serving plate. I wasn't sure about dill with these ingredients but I loved the flavour!  My only comment is next time I wouldn't cook the tomato for so long. Mine ended up being a bit too mushy.  I will definitely make this again!

Simple ingredients with big flavor!  I used a sprouted grain bread and omitted the salt on the bread after browning. I didn't think there would be enough garlic flavor with rubbing the clove on the bread, but too much garlic would ruin this. The rub gave it a perfect hint of garlic. Make sure to scorch the tomatoes using convection roast if you have that option. That is where the flavor comes from. These were good hot and at room temp. Dill is optional in my opinion.
