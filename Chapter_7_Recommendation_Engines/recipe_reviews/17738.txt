I used suggestions from many different people to make this a tasty recipe.  I cooked celery, onion, and fresh mushrooms in some marg. and added it to the pasta.  I also stirred some seasoned pepper, thyme, garlic, parsley, oregano, and seasoned salt into the veg. while they were cooking.  I used a full can of milk and added some lt. sour cream to the soup mixture.  For the chz., I used about a cup of mild cheddar and a cup of sharp cheddar (both reduced fat).  For the topping, I mixed seasoned breadcrumbs with saltine crackers and about two tablespoons of marg.  I also sprinkled a little sharp cheese under the topping.  This filled a 9x13 pan.  My husband loved this and went back for seconds.  I definately recommend making changes to the original recipe to jazz it up, otherwise this would be very bland.

This was really good, but I did alter the recipe slightly.  I sauteed a medium sized onion along with 1 clove of garlic and added that to the cheese sauce.  The only change  I made to the cheese sauce was to add 1 tsp of dry mustard powder.  I cooked 4 cups of macaroni as suggested by other reviewers and I also added about 1-1.5 cups of diced leftover ham.  Lastly, instead of breadcrumbs for the topping, I crushed up some Ritz crackers, mixed with some shredded cheddar cheese and dumped a few tablespoons of melted butter of the top; this is a fabulous topping that my mother uses when she makes mac & cheese.  The dish turned out really, really good...but I think next time I make it, I will add 3 cups of macaroni only, DH and I would like the cheese sauce a little more moist, but this is only a personal preference.

Wow, this was a great comfort food casserole, so quick and easy.  I followed previous suggestions and my own ideas.  I used 4 cups macaroni, 2 cups shredded SHARP Cheddar cheese, the regular cream of mushroom (NOT fat free/low fat), used a WHOLE can of milk, added 1/4 cup my favorite grainy mustard (per previous suggestions), baked 15 minutes and then added my version of the bread crumbs for the last 15 minutes.  For the topping I used 1/4 cup Italian bread crumbs, 10 crushed saltines, 1/4 cup (will use 1/2 cup next time), and moistened with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (could use melted butter).  This was moist and delicious.

Modify the recipe as follows: Use 3 cups macaroni, 1 1/2 cups ham, Ritz crackers (or the like) mixed with a bit of Parmesan to top it off, a whole can of milk, increase cheese to 2 cups and add an additional 1/2 can of Cream of Celery soup. Also add vegetable - I love this with broccoli or asparagus, but corn, carrots, mushrooms, etc...all work well. Note that if you use potatoes you will need to increase the amount of liquid to suit to absorbtion. I also add seasonings, including garlic, thyme, marjoram and pepper.

This recipe was very good...however, I added a few "extras" to ensure that the casserole would be a success.  I added a 1/2 tsp. of garlic salt, a 1/2 tsp. of pepper, used about 1/2 cup of low-fat sour cream, 3 tbsp. of low-fat mayo, and 1/2 cup of swiss cheese.  The end result was magnificent!

This was a pretty good way to help get rid of all our ham leftovers.  I followed some previous suggestions and included a bag of frozen broccoli - this was a very good suggestion to round out the meal.  We also included more milk as some previous posters suggested but when we make it again, I think I'll stick with the 1 cup like the recipe recommends (just too milky for our tastes).  We did include more cheese, but we're cheese-lovers so we do that most of the time.  I can see where the 1/4 cup of dijonaise mustard would add some extra kick.  We might try that next time.  Definitely a tasty way to re-do the ham, overall!  I think this one is a keeper.

I always make this to use up leftover Christmas ham. We like this recipe, but only with modifications. As written, it's very plain. This is what I do: Sauteed half an onion in some butter, then added the ham (about 1 1/2 cups), 4 oz. cubed cream cheese, and about 1/2 cup frozen peas. I seasoned this mixture with a little salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and hot pepper flakes. I then combined cream of mushroom soup with 1 c. milk and 1/2 c. shredded cheddar cheese in a big bowl, and added the ham mixture and cooked penne pasta to the soup mixture, mixed, poured into casserole and baked in 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.

This casserole was great!  I read the reviews and, following the lead of others, I added my Holy Trinity (onions, mushrooms and celery) along with garlic and some dry mustard.  Even my husband, who doesn't like casseroles, declared this one a keeper (I changed the pasta from macaroni to penne because he likes it better).

My family loved this -even my picky 8 year old!.  I followed the instructions provided but I made some modifications.  I used 6 cups of cooked noodles, enough to feed my family.  I used 2 cups of ham, 1 cup of chopped fresh tomato & 2/3 cup of chopped fresh green onions.  I used 1/2 can of cream of celery and 4 oz cream chees plus 1 cup of milk.  I used 2 cups Sharp Cheddar & 1 cup of Monterey Jack cheese.  I mixed everything together with a small amount of sea salt & TJ's Everyday Seasoning. Put everything in the casserole baker & added another cup of Monterey Jack cheese on top then a blend of ritz cracker crumbs and itallian bread seasonongs mixed with melted butter. Was delicious & will make again... loved the fresh tomatoes in it!

This is really very good.  I also added cream of chicken soup, soup cream and 1/2 & 1/2 to sauteed onions and celery.  Added a little poultry seasoning, seasoned pepper and garlic.  

Topping I crushed up some saltines, melted butter and sharp cheddar cheese.  Our family ate it up.

Delicious way to use up leftover ham. I had everything in my pantry and was able to put this together for a quick weeknight dinner. I added the French's Onion like another reviewer suggested. My husband loved it!

This is a five-star recipe with a few additions to punch it up.  I took others' advice and added a full can of milk, corn, and extra cheese.  In addition, I sauteed celery,mushrooms and onion in two tablespoons of butter and some zesty garlic seasoning and dumped that in as well.  Crushed Ritz crackers made an excellent topping.  This pleased a multi-generational family from toddler to Grandpa. I added a piece of grape-jellied bread to each plate.  Yum!

Real comfort food!  I made this first strictly as written, and it was good, but a I thought it was bland. My son-in-law loved it, so I tried it again.  I changed just a few things the second time:  Used sharp cheddar cheese (instead of mild) and added a little Lawry's seasoned salt, garlic powder, and white pepper.  It's very rich and cheesy, so serve it with a green salad or green veggie.

My family liked this a lot better than our normal Ham Noodle Casserole.  The cheese and milk really changes the regular cream of mush soup taste.  I did add some regular mustard, basil, onion and garlic powder to the mixture.  I also upped the cheese to about 1 1/2 cups.  I mixed melted butter to the bread crumb topping.  Will definitely make again.

tasty! made some changes...sauted 1/2 yel. onion & 1/2 green pepper w/ some garlic 'til they were soft. Used cream of celery instead of mushroom w/ whole can of milk. A tbsp of mustard. Had some provolone to use up, so I threw that in in addition to the cheddar. A little butter, cornflakes, bread crumbs and parm cheese on top.  A great recipe to use up leftovers and throw just about anything into. I bet it would be tasty w/ tuna or leftover chicken or turkey too.

Had leftover ham and was looking for something the whole family would like.  After reading some reviews I added garlic salt, mustard, a little extra milk, and some sour cream.  This was a very bland dish.  My family didn't care for it.  Will save my ham leftovers for something else next time.

This was a great base to work upon.  We are not big portion eaters however I did bump the ingredients by one third. The dish would have been a little too close to quite make the 6 person portion.  I didn't have the cream of mushroom soup, so I made a roux 3 TB of of melted butter and 3 TB of flour and added one can of evaporated milk plus 5 oz. of half and half and a can of mushrooms.  It was better than the canned version!   I also added the extra milk portion in the recipe plus a little more and then I the cheese (both at room temp) to the cream mixture and heated until smooth and creamy.  I mixed all the ingredients into a sprayed caserole dish (I did shred the ham as it blends into the dish nicely). I then added aproximately 4 cups of fresh baby spinach and mixed it into the casserole.  I finished as directed.  It was very good although next time I will add just a few pinches of nutmeg to the creamed mixture before adding all the ingredients to the casserole to add that next layer of flavor.

I liked this one, but tweaked it with a few of the suggestions from other reviews, and added a couple of my own.  I used 3/4 cup milk, 3 cups of rotini, instead of the pasta suggested, a half can of peas, sauteed onions and garlic, and 6 chopped jalapenos.  To make it less fattening, I used 1% milk, 3/4 cup shredded fat-free mozzarella, and a 1/4 2% shredded cheddar, and whole wheat pasta.  My parents and husband really liked it, and the jalapenos gave it the extra kick it needed.  We also used country salted ham that we had left over from Christmas...this was not lean, but it was all we had.

Edited this recipe to accommodate leftovers from Thanksgiving. I took out the can of milk and can of mushroom soup and instead used about 2 1/2 cups of mashed sweet potatoes with butternut squash .  I also added a can of corn and 3 stalks chopped celery.  Followed everything else-GREAT for leftover ham!

Needed something new to use leftover ham, and this was surprisingly good! Added 1 cup frozen broccoli when boiling the noodles (used egg noodles) and also sauteed garlic, onion, celery, and mushrooms with the ham before adding. Increased milk and mozzarella cheese as suggested, and italian bread crumbs on top made it different. Will make again.

This was alright. I took a previous suggestion and added 1/4 cup Dijonnaise mustard. This added a little zip but it was still kinda bland. It was a nice way to use leftover ham but nothing extraordinarily special. My 3 y/o did not care for it. My husband did like it though.

I have a tough time to feed any meal with at least some vegetable so I added 1 cup of frozen corn, 1 cup of frozen peas and 1 cup of snow peas.  It was delicious.

This was really an easy recipe.  After reading the other reviews, I did make a few revisions.  I grilled the ham with onions, bell peppers, and celery.  I also added more milk and cheese.  I also added more salt, pepper and crushe red peppers.  It was gone in less than 24 hours!

This was good. Hubby said we could do this one again. Super simple to make. I will be honest; I used Velveeta and shells as a shortcut and it was just fine. Thanks so much! We had tons of ham leftover after Easter!  :)

Followed the recipe pretty closely and it turned out great, the family loved it.   I added one thing that I hadnt seen yet.  Banana Peppers (or Pepperchini's, depending on where you live) and it added an extra kick, plus the flavors blended wonderfully.

OMG, this is sooo good!  We had leftover ham that we smoked earlier in the week, so I used that.  I added more cheese and a tad bit more milk.  I added garlic powder, pepper, dried onions, and parsley.  I added more cheese on top and then topped the whole thing with French's fried onions...wow!  Total keeper, thanks for the recipe  :)

My family loves this recipe.  I start with 2 cups of uncooked macaroni and cook it until it is nearly done.  I also add more milk than the recipe calls for.  Delicious.  I may try adding frozen peas to make it a complete meal.

This recipe turned out really good, and was a real winner with my two mac-n-cheese loving kids. Following some suggestions from other reviewers, I doubled the amount of noodles, used cream of chicken soup (it's all I had), added 1/2 cup sour cream, increased the milk to a whole can and increased the cheese to 2 cups.  I also added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder. I forgot to add the bread crumbs at the end, which was fine. I think I would add a tsp of salt next time too.  It was really creamy and delicious and both kids asked for seconds, which is unusual!  What's nice about this recipe is that I almost always have all the ingredients on hand, with the exception of the ham. So throwing it together unplanned would work.  Will definitely make again when I have leftover ham.

What a nice way to use up leftover holiday ham!   I read the previous reviews and seasoned to our taste (adding 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 2 Tbsp spicy mustard and salt/pepper).   

An excellent way to enjoy this all-American comfort food.   :)

With the adjustements suggested by others (more cheese and more sauce), it made a great casserole! My friend's 7 year old gobbled her plate down and my boyfriend ate this three days in a row!

I made the mistake of not reading the comments before trying this recipe (pressed for time) and I'm sorry I didn't make the time.  While this is a great way to use left-over ham, it didn't make enough sauce and we prefer more cheese in our casseroles.  It was rather bland.  I do think it's worth another try with some of the great suggestions from the previous reviewers.

Judy, Great dish!  So quick and easy, and everyone loved it, especially my little boy!  It contained his favorites...ham, pasta and cheese!  He and my husband had 2 helpings.  I didn't have enough shredded cheese,(we like it cheesy,chessy, so I added some Velveta and it worked out well.  Will be making this again!!  Thanks Judy!

Great recipe for leftover ham, this is a wonderful "comfort food" dish! This is a very easy meal to make. I made sure to follow some of the alterations mentioned here in the reviews...increasing the cheese to 2 cups and the milk to 1 can. I also added about 1 tbsp. each of seasoned salt and onion powder, and a little bit of pepper as well. The onion powder and seasoned salt really gave it the flavor it needed.

We really enjoyed this one, although I did doctor it up a bit (can't help myself sometimes!). I sauteed some onion & celery in butter, then mixed it into the cooked macaroni...stirred in the other ingredients and added an 8.5 oz. can of peas (drained). Yum!

This was really good, but I thought it was a bit dry.  I added more milk to it, especially when reheating.  I also added a bit of salt and freshly ground peper.  We will definitely have it again.

My hubby and I enjoy this recipe with a bit of Italian seasoning, seasoning salt, white pepper and extra cheese added.  We're huge on spices, though.  The basic recipe is a great starting point!

This one is a keeper because my kids liked it so much.  I used shell macaroni, a full can of milk (and then some), about 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and about 1/3 cup diced celery.  Everything else was per the recipe.  When I served it, I put green tabasco on mine and it was delish!  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was good.  I am never one to follow a recipe to a tee so I made some changes.  I added a cup of chopped yellow onion and about two cups frozen broccoli florets.  Also added more cheese.  My husband was less than thrilled but that's just him...hard to impress.

This was an excellent way to get rid of my left over ham! I loved the textures and the taste of the soup base with the ham.  I also added broccoli for some color.. Good work!

Thanks for the Recipe. I needed to use up the Easter Ham and what a wonderful and easy recipe. I did add 1 cup of Green Peas.  I will fit in the vegetables any where I can when it comes to my kids.  Also added more color.  Thank Tommy for me!

This recipe was really quick, but we found it to be very bland, even with the addition of chopped broccoli and some basic seasonings.  My husband tried topping it with salsa- that wasn't bad.  I might try it again, going heavy on the cheese and spices... maybe adding some banana peppers this time?

I didn't cook the noodles and added more liquid.  I also added some leftover broccoli to make it a one dish meal.  This was a good meal to make with leftover ham and my family ate it all.

I thought it was bland, the youngest in the family liked it.  Not a bad way to use up a lot of leftover ham.  I loaded up with hot wing sauce, and it was much better.  Could pretty much use it to use up leftovers and put just about anything in it.

Very good!  My 18 year old daughter and I loved it.  I followed the recipe, but added 1 cup finely shredded cheddar (instead of 3/4 cup), and used an entire small carton (1/2 pint) of heavy whipping cream instead of can milk.  I also added 1/2 tsp of garlic salt.  After 20 minutes of baking, I used the topping suggested by another reviewer (Town House crackers crumbed with some finely shredded cheddar cheese mixed in.   Once I put the topping on, I poured on about 1/2 stick of melted butter and continued baking 10 minutes, uncovered!)  Yummy! I will continue making this one!

I made this tonight and it was awesome.  I used 2 cups of mild cheddar cheese, 2 cans of mushroom soup, 1 cup regular milk, one head of fresh broccoli florets pre-cooked, sauted onions+celery+fresh mushrooms and one can of French Fried Onions (instead of bread crumbs).  It was soooooooo good!

This was great!  My kids loved it and so did I!  I didn't have cream of mushroom, but cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.  I used it and it was full of flavor - don't know how different it will be next time when I use regular.  Excellent, excellent recipe.  :)

I personally would give this casserole three stars, but my husband loved it so I'm giving it four. I thought it was good, but not great. I did add some sauteed celery, onion and a little garlic to add some flavor, along with some other spices. I also reduced the amount of milk and added extra cheese. Next time I will add some melted butter to the bread crumbs. I may also add some honey dijon mustard to give it more zip next time.

I am a virgin cook (not even a beginner).  I had extra ham and found this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I went totally by the recipe except I added a half a bag of broccoli florets that I also had on hand.  It turned out great!  It was so easy to throw it all together and pop it in the oven.  It is a complete meal by itself.  My two teenagers liked it alot. I will probably add extra cheese and leave off the crumb topping (my least favorite part) the next time I cook it.

This was pretty good.  I had left over ziti in the fridge.  So I cut up the ziti into a size similar to elbow mac.  The only problem is the ziti was precooked - so it was a little dry.  So I just added more milk to the recipe.  Another variation is to cook the ham with some honey - gives it a little sweet to the ham.

I was not expecting this to be so good!  We had a bunch of leftover ham, so I tried it.  Well my family LOVED it!  My 10 yr old said it was the best thing I ever made!  (Doesn't say much for my cooking!)  So we decided tonight to triple the recipe to get rid of the rest of the ham.  I also added more more milk, and used cream of chicken, because that is what I had on hand.  Also used ritz crackers.  Great comfort food for winter and very easy and fast!  Thanks!

I sauteed and added 1/2 diced medium onion, 1 sliced large celery stalk, and 1/4 c diced mushrooms.

I also added 3 tbsp fat free sour cream. I used 1 whole cup of milk rather than the 1/2 and used 2 cups of cheee total. 1 c. skim mozzerella, 1 c. sharp cheddar.
I used 1/4 c ritz crackers, 1/4 cup Panko, and 1/4 c. seasoned italian breadcrumbs for the topping.
I baked under foil for 15 minutes without topping, and 15 minutes uncovered with topping.

I thought that this recipe was just so/so. It tastes like ham and cheese. I would have added potatoes or some extra ingredient to jazz it up a little. It wasn't bad by any means, just not anything spectacular.

NOTE: This recipe makes a HUGE amount of casserole. It's far more than 12 servings, in my opinion. More like 18ish.

Well, I made this with my leftover ham. Made some adjustments as others suggested: included 1 cup ea. sauteed onion and celery; used 2 cans cream of mushroom soup mixed with 1/2 soup can of milk (plus a few extra TBS of milk); pinch of garlic powder; dash of pepper; small squeeze of spicy brown mustard. For the cheese - I used 1 cup shredded cheddar, and 1 cup shredded pepper jack. I also used crushed Ritz crackers on top of the casserole. When it was done, I tasted it before taking out of my roaster oven. Fantastic! BUT.... when I removed it from the roaster, my casserole dish slipped from my hands, and down went the casserole all over my kitchen floor! What a mess, coupled with breaking my favorite dish!! Glad I was able to taste it before it ended up all over the floor!! I think the pepper jack cheese gave it the extra "zing" that some reviewers said it needs. I will be making this again tomorrow.

I read the previous reviews and added sour cream, extra cheese, some garlic powder, and onion to the recipe. Was a nice way to use up left-over ham. Tastes great warmed up the next day. A nice comfort food. Thanks for posting.

Had to change it a bit - used pepper jack soup instead of the cream of mushroom, a little more cheese and then topped it with crushed tortilla chips.  But with those changes everyone in the house except for my picky eater liked it.  Thanks!

Great basic recipe, Tommy! Bet you've figured out some additions to it by now also! You gave we creative cooks something to start with.  I added 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup chopped onion, about 2 Tbs. chopped green pepper, used cream of broccoli soup, and LEFTOVER macaroni and cheese topped with seasoned bread crumbs.  We loved it!

With the adjustment suggested by others, I added one more of my own.  Since I am not a fan of cream of mushroom soup, I substituted cream of asparagus soup.  It was yummy and my picky 9 year old ate it right up!

This was good. My kids loved it which is always good. As others said, I should have used low sodium soup. Instead of bread crumbs, I used ritz crackers because thats what I had-which probably added to the salt.

Very quick, easy & hearty using modifications suggested by others: 4 cups cooked macaroni (8 oz pre-cooked weight of sea shell pasta), a whole soup can of milk & 2 cups of shredded cheese. My picky eater husband loved it! Thanks Tommy.

Not something I would actually cook a ham for, but a genius way to have a left over ham meal. I added 1.5 cans of cream of mushroom soup with garlic. About 3 cups of sharp cheddar. Salt, pepper and a bit of garlic. A good way for ham the second day. I baked covered the first 20 mins. , then put italian bread crumbs on top, covered and baked another 10. But, I can say, it is filling and I am full, Served with fresh tomato slices and olive bread.

We enjoyed this recipe so much! I used Italian bread crumbs, which gave the dish more flavor. Next time, I think I will add green onion to the final dish for a little color.

This is good for college students to try, as I was able to use a box of macaroni and cheese and it still tasted great. It's creamy and crunchy at the same time. Great recipe!

I substituted almond flour (1.8 cups) and gluten free flour (2 cups).  I cut sugar in half and used stevia on the berries.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I added a tablespoon of baking powder.  It is wonderful straight out of the oven.

This is really easy to make. I added a few shakes of garlic powder and black pepper to the creamy mixture before I poured it into a greased casserole dish. I would make it again. I would probably not sprinkle as much breadcrumbs, and I would probably add some sort of vegetable to the mixture to give it a little color.

I didn't have mushroom soup so I used cream of broccoli and added sautéed celery and onion. I added corn also.For the topping I used Panko bread crumbs mixed with melted butter and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. My husband won't eat broccoli but he didn't realize I used broccoli soup LOL  and he liked it!

We really liked this recipe. I added cooked onions and celery to mine and used half n half in place of the milk which gave it a creamy taste. I also used a crushed Ritz type cracker instead of the bread crumbs and used more of them then recipe stated.

This recipe was a hit with the family, for sure!  A great way to get rid of ham leftovers.  My slight variation included the following:
1) using NoYolk egg noodles instead of regular mac
2) adding 1.5 cups of frozen mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, & corn)
3) dusting the top of casserole with Panko bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.
Winner, winner, ham casserole dinner!

We have a small family, so when a ham is on sale we use it for multiple meals. This is one we use often for leftovers. Most casseroles have a cheese base. While this one has cheese, it is not cheesy which is a refreshing change.

It is good. A basic casserole using mushroom soup. I agree with the onions, all noodle casseroles need some onions. I also added some chopped sweet red pepper for color and sprinkled it with French Fried Onions

Nice recipe to use up some leftover ham!  Made this one for my boys, used wagon wheel pasta and realized I was out of cream of mushroom, so cream of broc had to substitute (would have been better with the mushroom as the broccoli is a bit strong!).  Used panko bread crumbs on the top as they are my standby fave and preference!  Great quick meal!

Quick and easy!  My 12 year old ate it up! I didn't like the bread crumbs on top, next time I will make it without it. My husband loved it too although he added a big lump of sour cream on top of his...what can you do???

So I followed the recommendations that every one else and the extra milk ended up being way too much. It was more like soup than casserole. I also didn't care too much for the cream of chicken soup; guess I should have used mushroom instead. It was also very salty. I don't think I'll be trying this recipe again.

This casserole was very tasty, went well with family members. I think I may try adding an onion next time to give a bit more flavor.

Okay for a simple lunch. It is very bland, and needs a little extra "something", not sure what.

This was wonderful and very easy.  I am on Weight Watchers so subed the pasta for cabbage chopped course then slightly cooked in the microwave before mixing together.  I'll make this over and over.

I was looking for a recipe to use some leftover ham and this is what I found...it was really good.  My cheese loving husband said it needed more but I thought it was great! VERY easy with lots of leftovers for the next day.

I also took the advice from the others who have rated this recipe and "spiced" it up.... I do have to agree that I should have used 2 cans of milk and/or more sour cream as it did turn out a little on the dry side.... a VERY easy and tasty solution to left-over ham!

This recipe was a great way to use leftover Easter ham. I didn't have cream of mushroom, so I used cream of chicken soup. I also added about two tablespoons of melted butter to the bread crumbs.I will use this recipe again!

This was good, but I made some changes.  I used 2 cups of cheddar cheese.  I used fat free soup and fat free milk and it was still delicious, although I think next time I will use 2 cans of the soup as it was a touch dry. I added some onion powder and a minced clove of garlic as well.  I also  used whole wheat pasta (12.75oz box).  My kids couldn't get enough and there weren't any leftovers last night!

Nice recipe. I did add some cooked leftover chicken breast in addition to the ham, use cream of celery and egg noodles (what I had in pantry) and added some frozen peas and about 1/2 cup of sour cream. Everyone liked it, even my picky kids.

This was a pretty good recipe! I personally don't care for ham mixed with cream of mushroom soup. I don't think they blend very well in flavor. However hubby loved this and he's a picky eater. It is however a wonderful recipe for a base. Thanks for a recipe I will make for hubby and plan on playing with.

This was a quick easy meal to make.  I really enjoyed it considering it took so little time to prepare and cook.  The only thing I did differently was I used crumbled Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and as others suggested I added more milk.  Thanks for sharing!

This wasn't that good.  Kinda like cafateria food.  Was way too dry.  It doesn't say what size of a dish to bake it in, i used a 9x11 and that was too big.  May smaller dish, seasonings, and maybe sour cream to make it creamy or more milk.

Everyone at work loved this. When I make it again, I will add more soup, I prefer it a little creamier. Taste was good, however and I will add it to my favorites.

I'm not a big ham person but really did like this.  I did add more cheese than the recipe calls for and it was great!!

I thought this was very good and even my husband ate it! Easy and tasty! Taste is dependent on what kind of cheddar you used. If you didn't use really good sharp cheddar it would not be as good.

With a few additions suggested by others, I found this really good.  I added frozen peas and corn, dry mustard, hungarian salami and added parmesan cheese to the topping.  Used the full can of milk, having scaled up the recipe by approx 25%.  Used wagon wheel pasta.  Very easy to make, and quite tasty.

A very simple way to use leftover ham. I also added seasoned salt for extra flavor, because it looked a little plain. I didnt have any cheddar so I used monterey jack and colby cheese and added croutons to the bread crumbs on the top of the casserole. I also topped the bread crumb/crouton mixture with a few slices of swiss cheese. The extra cheese made a real difference.

You can't mess this one up!!  I am a college student, and have never made a dish like this before.  It was extremely easy to make and was great!  I skipped the bread crumbs, added broccoli and more cheese.  If I can make this recipe anyone can!!

It was quick and easy, I added the mustard, which I usually put in mac and cheese anyway, and salt and pepper. I wouldn't add salt again, because with the ham it was too much. Next time I think I will probably add a few dash's of worcestershire sauce. Kids and husband ate allmost all of it, which is a plus!!

Delicious and easy.  I added mushrooms and garlic but it probably would've been better without the garlic.

I used low sodium ingredients which made it more baby friendly.  My 9 month old loved it with peas and my husband thoroughly enjoyed it, too.

Needs more milk or cheese to make it creamier and also add some spices to it to liven it up some. It was FAST and everyone loved it.

I added more milk and cheese to make mixture more mixable and creamy.  My husband Thomas and I really thought it was a great way to use up leftover ham.
