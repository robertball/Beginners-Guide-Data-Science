Fun, cute and delicious! The only thing I didn't have on hand was the black gel, so I just tinted some of the frosting, and that worked fine. My piping skills are not the best, but they did turn out adorable and the kids LOVED these as a surprise after school snack today. Really enjoyed the addition of the chocolate chips too! I will def be making these for Halloween~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This cupcakes are a fun way to add some fruit and vegetables during the Halloween season! I usually avoid food coloring, so next time I will probably puree some cooked sweet potato for the frosting and use chocolate syrup to decorate instead of the gel.

I made this and it was a huge hit at home. I didn't use the icing because I'm just not an icing person. It was very easy to make and follow. Loved it

These were delicious. I could not bring myself to turn these little gems into pumpkins just yet. So I frosted them minus the food coloring. I loved the lemon flavor of the icing. It really complimented the cupcake. This recipe made 24 regular size cupcakes, not sure if they figured 2 per serving or what. I omitted the nuts, we are not fans and doubled up on the chocolate chips. My only complaint would be that the chocolate chips settled to the bottom of the cupcakes and the icing never made it to the easily  spreadable stage, it was kind of runny.  Still delicious and definitely something I would make again!

I made it with fresh pineapple and as a round cake rather than cupcakes. It was very moist... To the point that some pieces were falling apart. I think I will try reducing the oil next time. A hit with the kids!
