I'm surprised that so many people have had a hard time preparing this soup.  It's really a very basic soup recipe.  This recipe is a great simple soup that is delicious and yet elegant enough to serve for dinner parties.  Serve as written for a soup course, but for a family supper I recommend adding a cup of shredded chicken and about three cups vegetables (I loved it when I added a bag of California blend (broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots)).  Thanks for the recipe!

My boyfriend called this 'melted cheese mess'. It was terrible and oily, and we ended up throwing out the entire pot in the end. Don't think I will be making this again.

Great soup! The only change was I used dried, minced onion, about 2 tablespoons worth. My soup wasn't as creamy as I would like, so next time I would probably use 1.5 cups of milk instead of 2 cups. This soup is perfect on a cold, windy Chicago day. Thanks Austin!

I loved this recipe. I didn't have chicken broth, so I used water and chicken flavor packet from Ramen. I added a 3 cups of milk instead of two and added the cheese while the heat was still on low. I also used Primo Taglio jack cheese slices, cut up. It was great, no goopy mess, just creamy soup. My boyfriend loved it as well and I will definitely make it again.

For those out there who had a weird texture or a cheesy mess-this is a basic white sauce technique, learning to do it properly will make this taste smooth, creamy and delicious.

I wanted to like this soup but didn't.  I didn't like the flavor, it was too thick and the texture was grainy.  For anyone else making it, heat the milk and broth before adding to the flour mixture.  Then add it slowly and stir constantly. This should help the consistency.  Just be careful not to boil the milk.  I won't make this soup again.

of course I modified soup like others have by adding leftover cooked vegies: potatoes, carrots, broccoli and added a fresh jalapeño instead of the hot pepper sauce.  The chunkier soup was more satisfying!

Loved this! It didn't end up super thick so I added some extra cheese at the end & it got a little thicker. Next time I will use less broth or milk. I made this as a broccoli cheese soup- I cooked the broccoli in some chicken broth until it was just tender then added it to the soup after whisking in the milk & broth. Great flavor!

This recipe isn't so bad when you use a really GOOD BRAND of Jack Cheese. Also add 1/4 more milk. Good as a dip.

I changed this up a bit to follow a chicken pepper jack soup I recently had in a restaurant in upper Michigan.  I didn’t use milk, I used heavy cream to make the soup extra creamy. I used 3 bags (8oz) of shredded pepper jack and increased the cream and chicken broth just a bit. I added cooked penne pasta (maybe 2 cups uncooked) and 3 cut up cooked chicken breasts.  I didn’t have worchestshire sauce and it turned out great anyway. I added about 1T Italian seasoning and some garlic powder and parsley. It was fantastic and my family love it. Used this recipe as the base .  I recommend trying with your own spin as you see fit.

I thought this sounded good and had some pepper jack cheese on hand.  Read the reviews, figuring other reviewers might not have made a roux-based soup before and did something weird to make the "texture off" like many had said it was.  I have made plenty of soups this way, cheesy ones too, so I figured it would be fairly simple and turn out tasty.  Everything went fine until I added the pepper jack at the end.  It WOULD NOT incorporate into the soup, even though I left the heat on and stirred and stirred it.  I have NO IDEA why that would be - I have made similar recipes without this happening, like a pepper jack cheese sauce to go on macaroni and cheese.  Ultimately, I do not recommend this recipe.  The finished product had gooey balls of cheese floating in it.  Not sure if this is the "weird texture" others talked about, but that's what I thought was wrong with it.  Sorry!
