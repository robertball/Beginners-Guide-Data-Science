I loved this cookie. Crispy on the edges and chewy on the inside. I used the butter option... Because... it's butter!  I also added a half tsp of almond extract to bump up the flavor.  Might try a splash of Amaretto next time instead?  For the add ins: I used approximately 2 cups each of chocolate chunks, coconut and sliced almonds. The dough is hard to resist. I noticed as the dough warmed up the cookies spread more, stuck more and browned unevenly. So I chilled the dough a bit and used parchment paper. Perfectly chewy thick cookies. Thanks for the recipe.

I did add 1tsp. Chocolate flavoring to give the recipe a little extra chocolate. Best cookie ever, delicious.

I followed this recipe top to bottom. I always do when I try a new recipe. EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE loved these. I made them Christmas eve and today is the day after AND THEY'RE ALL GONE!!  I'm staying with my boyfriend and his roommates and all of them aren't big sweets eaters. Guess who's making more tomorrow?

These cookies are really good. My only problem is...there is too many chocolate chips, And too much coconut, and almonds and not enough dough. My cookies wouldn’t stay together and I had chocolate chips, coconuts, and almonds everywhere. Next time I will decrease the chocolate chips by 1 cup, the coconut by 1/2 a cup,  and the almonds by 1/4 and see how that goes. Also, I used butter. I cooked them for 9 minutes. They were crisp around the edges and soft and gooey on the inside.

I made 2 batches, (Didn't use banana for either one, used butter). I smashed my buddy's almonds from his orchard, they were roasted, but not salted.  I added 1 Tablespoon of Almond extract to both. The first batch, thought it may have been a little dry. Tasted GREAT! So the next batch I added 1/2 c. more butter, it was flatter, and tasted GREAT. It just depends on the texture you like.

I made these for my Dad and husband. Two thumbs up from hubby! It makes a very large batch so great for a crowd. 
I did drizzle leftover melted chips over top just to get rid of the last cup of them. Really made them look great.
This is a keeper.

I’m curious, does it really need 5 cups of choc chips? I want to make it for my mom in law. I plan on using butter and adding some almond extract. Can’t wait to try it! Even though my hubby prefers lemon.... it’s her birthday anyway!
