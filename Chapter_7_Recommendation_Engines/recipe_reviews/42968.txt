This is a bare bones recipe for Pad Thai. Here are my observations: Make sure your wok is very hot, to the point where the oil is about to smoke. add a clove or two of chopped garlic and a couple chopped scallions to the hot oil and fry for 30 seconds. Add thinly sliced chicken and some shrimp and fried tofu and fry for a couple minutes. Crack the eggs in there and stir for a minute or two. Turn in the noodles and fry for a 30 seconds. Add the fish sauce which has been mixed with a little rice vinegar, soy sauce and lime juice. Add some ground peanuts and stir fry the whole mess for a few more minutes. Remove from heat and serve with additional peanuts and fish sauce, crushed red pepper, cilantro leaves, fried scallions and lime wedges. Oh yeah, and omit the butter. It's really not necessary. I also omitted the bean sprouts because I don't care for them.

I am obsessed with Pad Thai and spend more than an ungodly amount of money on take out.  Having said that, this is a good, basic Pad Thai recipe.  I made the following changes:

1.  Doubled the sauce (should have tripled it)

2.  Cooked the chicken with four cloves of minced garlic in olive oil, not butter.

3.  Added one teaspoon of peanut butter for each dose of the sauce, but will probably reduce that to 3/4 teaspoon, next time.

4.  NOT ENOUGH HEAT.  I like my Thai food hot and will have to increase the heat next time by adding the seeds and placenta of a harabenero pepper, maybe even of two peppers.

This is a good recipe.  I gave it an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 and my husband gave it a 9.5.

It's definately worth trying!  Good luck!

This didn't look like the real deal but tasted pretty close! Everyone loved it, but most have not had it before. I made mine with shrimp, doubled the sauce and used limes instead. Yum! Also I didn't have directions on rice noodle package, so I called my mom. Toss the noodles in boiling water for 1 min then turn off the heat. Let it sit for 5 min in the hot water, check for softness, then rinse with cold water. So much faster than letting them soak!

Excellent Recipe!  This is one of my favorites.  I made the following changes:  1)  used only about 3/4 pack of noodles, 2) substituted sesame oil for vegetable, 3) tripled the sauce (white wine vinegar, fish sauce and white sugar) but only doubled the sugar. 4)  added sweet chili sauce and some minced garlic to the sauce.  5)  used 3/4 tbsp crushed red pepper and also added some cayenne.  6)  added some grated carrot with the bean sprouts (nice for color too), and 7) used lime instead of lemon.  Next time I'm going to try splenda instead of sugar and to reduce oil by frying chicken with Pam instead, or at least reduce the oil.  Also, I didn't follow noodle instructions - I cooked as per package and then added.  This recipe would be good with Shrimp as well.   Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe was really good and very easy to make.  Based on the reviews of others, I made a few modifications to the recipe.  I would recommend doubling the sauce - there just won't be enough if you only make what the recipe calls for and you likely won't enjoy it as much.  I cooked the chicken in peanut oil with some garlic to give it some extra flavour.  I bought Thai rice stick noodles and the instructions on the bag said to put them in a bowl and cover them with boiling water and let sit for 7 minutes - this was much quicker than what the recipe called for (but double check the instructions for the noodles that you buy).  After the chicken was cooked and removed, I cooked the rest of the dish in a bit of sesame oil.  I garnished with lots of peanuts and green onions and it was extremely good.  My husband gave it a 10 and wants to have it weekly.  Very quick to make (providing you don't have to soak the noodles for up to 50 minutes).

I was hesitant to review this because I made so many changes. But I just had some of the leftovers for lunch.  Straight out of the frig and it's a great cold noodle salad!  I like it even better than warm......
 
I did what others suggested. No butter. Veggie oil and a bit of sesame oil with some chopped garlic. Lime instead of lemon.  I used rice vinegar. I tripled the amount of sugar, fish sauce and vinegar. Although double might have been plenty.  I used more red pepper. I added about two TBSP. of peanut sauce.  I used cubed deli turkey and NO bean sprouts.  I also threw in some yellow bell pepper (to use it up) and some thinly sliced carrots.......  
My thought is that pad thai is like making chili or soup.  You can make all kinds of changes.  What I would not leave out of this recipe is the vinegar, sugar, red pepper, fish sauce, and garnish of peanuts, green onions, and lime. (I also added some chopped cucumber and cilantro as garnish. I just love cilantro).....

I had never made pad thai before and the sauce in this recipe really did the trick.  Delish.  I will be making pad thai a lot.  Thanks for the recipe, Transmonicon!........

One last tip learned from another reviewer.  I put the rice noodles in a bowl and poured boiling water over them.  After 5 minutes I drained and rinsed with cold water.

I can only imagine that the reviewers who said this was 'nothing like Pad Thai' have never been to Thailand!! This is very close to the Thai dish, the only thing that i can think of that the Thais add are tiny dried shrinps. Outside of Thailand I think this is as authentic (and delicious)as you are going to get!

This recipe tasted like an unfinished take on Pad Thai. It lacked true Pad Thai seasonings and accordingly taste. When I prepared the recipe, the sauce appeared to be miniscule in comparison to the main ingredients (noodles, chicken, sprouts). This was a problem as Pad Thai noodles must soak up a lot of flavor in order to compensate for their lack of taste. Upon completion, it tasted as though the flavors were sparse, and overall it felt bland. I would not use this recipe again.

This is almost one of the best Pad Thai recipes out there.  I did alter it slighty, and this is what I did:

-Doubled the sauce.
-Omitted the butter.
-Substituted chicken for tofu and white vinegar for rice vinegar.
-Added peanut sauce, sweet chili sauce, soy sauce more crushed red pepper & cayenne.

I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe was good, but needed some tweaking to really get it right. For starters, I sauteed a few cloves of minced garlic in the (olive) oil along with the chicken. Then, I used 2 eggs instead of 4. The sauce on the recipe is a bit out of whack, so I wound up tripling, doubling and adding some things to it. (Triple the vinegar and fish sauce, double the sugar, and add 2 tbs soy sauce, 1 tbs sriracha sauce, 1 tsp peanut butter and I added cayenne and extra red pepper to give it more of a kick.) I also used lime instead of lemon. It was really delicious, and tasted like Pad Thai from one of my favorite Thai restaurants. With the adjustments, I will make this again and again!

It is the combination of lime juice and tamarind sauce that make Pad Thai, Pad Thai. That is why this recipe seems to be "missing something".

Because the wok needs to be super hot and the time cooking in the pan is pretty short it is preferable to have the sauce prepared and adjusted to taste beforehand. This way you are not in danger of overcooking the meat (chicken, shrimp, or tofu) or can add more sauce if your noodles start drying out. The ingredients in the wok must be stirred constantly and vigorously to keep things from burning and to keep the noodles from clumping.  The balance of the sauce is sour (tamarind paste is essential and was left out of this recipe), sweet (palm sugar), salty (fish sauce) and spicy (thai peppers). 
Adding garlic, Chinese chives, spring onions or sprouts is nice, but optional. 
Good luck!

This is two recipies in one! I made a few minor changes, as everyone did with the sauce and this ended up reminding me more of the crab noodles that I live for from my fav Thai restaurant. I'm so happy!  First off, compared to my fav Thai cookbook, the missing ingredients (flavors and color) for Pad Thai are garlic (3 cloves minced), 1/4 c dried shrimp (traditional, but I leave this out as I use 18 med shrimp instead of chicken) 2 tablespoons tamarind juice and 1 tablespoon paprika. For crab noodles..... I used 8 oz rice noodles 2 T white wine vinegar, 3 T fish sauce, 2 t crushed pepper, 1 T peanut butter,leave sugar at 3 T, 1/4 c sweet chili sauce (next time I will minimum double the adjusted sauce) and 1 lb crab meat.  I sometimes use imitation crab.  Prepare as stated in recipe with the addition of 2 romas quartered lengthwise. Add the garlic, green onion and romas to hot oil, add egg then noodles and sauce. Leave out the crushed peanuts. Whichever version I make I mix the sauce ingredients together and let them blend while the noodles soak.  I also reduce the eggs to 2. I also use slightly less oil than stated.  Start with half and add a drizzle or two to get the right consistantcy.  YUM.

Everytime I go to Thai restaurants, this is my dish of choice. However, after trying this recipe, THIS is the best pad thai I've ever tasted! I quadrupled the recipe (but kept the fish sauce at triple the recipe).  I also used lime juice instead of lemon and added a couple of cloves of minced garlic to the oil (as other reviewers have added). I also added cilantro,crushed cashews instead of peanuts, sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, and I added a whole sliced onion to the sesame oil with the garlic. Yummy recipe!

My 5 stars is because i read alot of reviews, and i got it spot on. the recipe is good but the amounts of the ingredients are NOT correct, the sauce needs to be tripled in order to be BARELY enough,,, 12 ounces of rice noodles is alot of noodles, but with extra sauce it is good. i also used only one egg, wich was plenty. Added 2 tablespoons of peanut butter per another reviewer and used LIME,, not lemon.. any pad thai you get in a resteraunt uses lime... with those modifications you are going to get something REALLY special,,, i will be making this alot in the future. my husband who is asain approved very much so!

The recipe is closed to "Athentic Pad Thai". If you can find these following ingredients, please try it. Then you will never get away from our "authentic Pad Thai" These are the missing ingredients: * disc white radish pickle 1 tb.spoon/serving. * 1-2 tb.spoons tamarine thick sauce /serving. * 1-2 tb.spoons disc tofu saute in oil/ serving. Directions: Add all these 3 ingredients saute w/others before add noodle. Replace Chinese Chive to green onion. Fresh cucumber, chive and bean sprout and lime are good side dish.

Not bad, but felt a little too strongly of simply red peppers without the
other pad thai flavors.  Incidentally, I doubled the liquid ingredients
per others' suggestions.  I also used lime instead of lemon and found
squeezing all its juices into pad thai improved the dish.  I certainly
prefer the Sukhothai Pad Thai recipe on this site.

As a base recipe it's ok. But it loses at least one star for the first step. I was foolish enough the first time around to follow the instructions here instead of the instructions on the rice noodles package--even after an hour and a half, the noodles weren't soft enough. I've made this a half-dozen or so times since, and it just works better (and goes way faster) to just cook the noodles first (minus a minute or so, or the noodles will get a bit sticky). The recipe as written also didn't have a strong enough flavor or enough sauce for us. Now, I double the sauce, add 2-3 tbsp peanut butter, add 1-2 tbsp soy sauce, use rice vinegar instead of white vinegar, add a sliced carrot for color, and serve with lime (not lemon) slices and fresh cilantro. To be fair, I'm not sure how authentic my version is, but we love it.

Loved this recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and changed it slightly.  I doubled the vinegar and fish sauce, omitted the butter and veg oil, and added a dozen large shrimp, three thinly sliced baby carrots, and two thinly sliced cloves of garlic.  First, I heated some olive oil and fried up the garlic and green onions.  Then, I added the chicken and, when almost cooked, the shrimp and carrots.  When almost cooked, I added the beaten eggs.  After all this is done, I added the vinegar, fish sauce, sugar, and a dab of sweet chili sauce.  After mixing well, I added the rice noodle, which I had boiled for a few minutes and drained.  I turned off the heat, sopped up the sauce with the noodles, and topped all this with crushed nuts and green onions.  So delish that I'll make this for years to come!

Fabulous!  We followed other users comments and reduced the sugar by a bit, and doubled the amount of sauce -- it wasn't too saucy so I think that was a good alteration.  I personally enjoy lots of add-ins, so I added tofu(that I pressed under a cast-iron pan for 1 hour, then sauteed in sesame oil before adding to noodles), shrimp, red pepper, broccoli, onions, green onions to the noodles in addition to raw on top, 1 roma tomato minus the seeds, and carrots.  YUM!  Also I prefer limes to lemons.  Had a chili garlic sauce on the side for those who like a kick.  I used sesame oil instead of veggie oil.  This was better than many restaurants.  My guests were so impressed.  Will be making this again

Not sure what happened here. I followed the recipe and I had to do so much altering to this dish to make it edible. Very dry and bland and messy! I got very frustrated making this dish and and felt that this recipe lacked a back up plan. I don't recommend putting yourself through the aggravation of this recipe.

I have never, I mean EVER, made pad thai.  While I've eaten quite a bit of it in my lifetime, I've never felt the need to tackle it in my own kitchen.  I was really nervous working with ingredients that I had never worked with, but I followed the directions and it was absolutely fantastic!  I used tofu instead of chicken, rice vinegar, and lime juice.  Other than that, I added some carrots and mushrooms and followed the directions.  Very good, and even better cold out of the refrigerator at 2:30 am (not that I would know about that or anything...)  Great recipe - My pad thai thirst was quenched and I will definitely make this again!

Where do I start??? Last night was Thai night – pad thai & pork dumplings (Lorna). I’ve sooo been craving Thai food, but the Thai restaurant my fiance & I enjoy is too pricey for a couple on a budget (we are planning a wedding - which is EXPENSIVE!!!). If that were not the case, I would have NEVER attempted to make this myself (some things are just better when someone else makes them lol!). I am so terribly disappointed. And, to boot, the ingredients, although bought in lg. enough quantities to be able to use again (except the noodles), were pricey. Having said that, here are my reasons for giving this a 1 star rating: a) there is not enough sauce for the amt. of noodles called for (I suggest tripling the sauce as many others have done), b) fried egg is NOT authentic; they should be SCRAMBLED, mix. in w/ the other ingredients &  be one of the LAST steps of the cooking process & c) true pad thai incl. tamarind pulp / juice & lime juice, both for color & flavor. Knowing this, I wish I would have tried Sukhothai Pad Thai (Nan). It is more authentic, but as with any “real” deal, ingredients can be hard to come by at a basic-stocked grocery store (mine didn’t have tamarind or dried radish). Needless to say, Thai night became “pizza night” at our house. Sorry, TRANSMONICON!

This is so good and very similar to the pad thai I have had from thai restaurants.  Everyone I have made this for has asked for the recipe.  My only suggestion is to add more sauce (vinegar, sugar, fish oil).  I actually added 4 x the amount.  I also doubled the eggs and oil and used peanut oil instead of vegetable.  It’s very fattening but worth it…

It tasted nothing like pad thai. If you want something close to pad thai, use oyster sauce.  That's the closest I've come to pad thai and tastes far better than this.

This is an EXTREMELY good dish. I did however make some changes. I didn't use the fish sauce (allergies) instead I used soy sauce which works very well with this recipe. I do believe that the fish sauce is an important ingredient and probably should not be omitted.I will make this recipe again but when I do I will use garlic and add some peas and carrots I give this recipe 5 STARS. Excellent recipe Transmonicon>

This wasn't bad.  I eat a fair amount of Pad Thai, but don't often make it at home.  I thought i'd give this a shot as it would be nice to have some Pad Thai at home when the craving strikes - and save some money in the process.
I made as directed, only doubled the sauce as I like my pad thai saucy. I also used Lime not Lemon.
It was good... but not great.  It was easy, which is a huge bonus and it full filled my Thai craving.  
I would make this again, as it's fairly quick and simple but I am also willing to keep looking for that 'keeper' recipe.
I thank you for sharing!

This was really good and easy but VERY THICK.  It was almost a noodle/peanut paste.  Though it tasted fine, it was a bit strange to eat and I probably wouldn't serve it to guests as is.  Next time I will not only make more sauce, but make the sauce with more liquid.

Great, GREAT recipe! My boyfriend declared that it was the best things he'd ever eaten! I followed the recipe, sans beans sprouts, and also, as suggested, used lime instead of lemon.

I have made this recipe with rice noodled of multiple thickness, and find that it works best with medium noodles. Thin noodles \seem to stick together and not mix very well with the other ingredients.

I LOVE this recipe!  I've made it a couple times before for friends, and when we decided to have weekly dinner parties, everyone demanded I make this for my  turn.  

Only a few variations....I did double the sauce (vingear, fish sauce, sugar) and cut back a little on the red pepper.  The first time I made it according to the ingredients, it was a little too hot for some sensitive palates.  Maybe I've kept the final product too long on the stove before serving, but the more sauce the better as far as I'm concerned :)  I also added shrimp that I've marinated and cooked in an Asian Sesame dressing/marinade. To serve, I had Thai peanut sauce on the table that is delcious with it (especially if you like theat spicy peanut combo).  Also, I prefer limes instead of lemons.  Overall, I imagine I will be making this over and over again.

YUMMY! I couldn't find fish sauce in any of our grocery stores, so I used soy sauce, and it worked just fine.  I doubled the sauce like everyone said,and I'm glad I did... but used about 1 1/2 tbls of red pepper and it was perfectly spicy.  Oh! I also used lime instead of lemon. once again, YUMMY!

Loved this Pad Thai.  Tastes like a restaurant quality dish.  I did make a few changes.  Doubled sauce ingredients and added about 1 T lime juice, used 14 oz package of rice noodles, added 2 small sliced onions to the chicken as it cooked, added a tablespoon or so of soy sauce at the end for color.  Also, I used rice wine vinegar instead of plain white vinegar.  The white vinegar smelled too harsh to me.  I also used red pepper to taste, probably about 1 scant tablespoon.

Absolutely fantastic!  This recipe is truly like Pad Thai from a real Thai restaurant, only much less oil and you can make your own combination of fish, meat, and/or poultry.  I took the advice of many different reviewers and infused two cloves of garlic into butter before I sauteed shredded chicken and baby shrimp (great combo), also, I deliberately mixed all of the liquid ingredients together (very well), and I added a tsp of peanut butter before I drizzled the liquid mixture over the noodles to simmer.  A hint of advice for first time rice noodle users, if you can, soak the noodles for the full 50 minutes.  It works out really well and allows your cooking time to be very short.  What a fantastic recipe! Especially for those who need a quick and healthy dinner for your family. Many thanks April! Now that I have a good Pad Thai recipe, I will cook this fantastic meal often!

Very good! I read a lot of reviews beforehand, and incorporated this advice: Doubling the sauce, Rice vinegar instead of white wine, 1 tbsp peanut butter, 2 tbsp lime juice,3 cloves of garlic. I found that although many reviewers said 4 eggs were too much, it was just right for us.

This is a great recipe. Thank you for posting it, I have been seeking a simple and delicious pad thai recipe and this fit the bill!

The only thing I would say is the method for preparing the rice noodles should be changed.  After much research I found that the preferred method is to pour boiling water over the noodles and soak for about 5 minutes until soft, then rise with cold water, and rinse again with cold water.   I did mine this way and the texture of the noodles was perfect, and this was the first time I made pad thai.  

The rest is like any recipe, this is a great start but tailor to your taste. I stir fried using a touch of veg oil, and some sesame oil, adding a couple of cloves of minced garlic as well.  I have a non stick electric wok so little oil is necessary, making the dish healthier.  I mixed rice vinegar, fish sauce, oyster sauce and sirachi with chicken broth in a bowl.  This allowed me test the flavor, and pour it over the noodles while stir frying.  

Thanks again.  I love pad thai and now I can make it at home!

YUMMMMMERS! I've made this a few times, each time adding a few tips from reviewers. This was the best batch and I didn't change it that much. I used sesame oil and garlic instead of butter. I tripled the sauce and used a 16 oz bag of noodles, which I boiled in water for a minute and let sit for 5 minutes before draining with cold water...they were perfect! I added a teaspoon of peanut butter and I also added some grated carrots. I added some sweet chili sauce and added a bit more red pepper, but we like it hot! This was delicious! Almost as good as carry out...and much cheaper!!!

I doubled the sauce as other reviews suggested & still thought this was a bit dry. The flavor was close to restaurant pad thai, but seemed to be missing something. It was fun trying a thai recipe though, so thanks!

I always change recipes to suit my and my husband's taste when I cook, and this was no different. This recipe was very easy and delicious!
After reading the other reviews for this dish, I trippled  the vinegar ( I used rice vinegar) and the fish sauce, and doubled the sugar for the sauce. I also added some schiracha hot sauce to it to my taste to give it a hint of spice. I also added chopped cilantro and some grated ginger and toasted minced garlic to the chicken as I was cooking it. When preparing the noodles, I found it was easier to boil some water in the microwave and pour it on the noodles and let soak for a few minutes until soft and drain, instead of waiting an hour in cold water. I also added some fried crumbled firm tofu that I fried while waiting for my chicken to defrost in the microwave. I used lots and lots of green onion and chopped peanuts in and garnished on top! I used canned bean sprouts which turned out good, and I cooked the chicken separate in vegetable oil and a touch of sesame oil and some seasonings. it turned out great, and I love how you can add to this recipe and change whatever  you want to suit your tastes! Thanks!

This was a great recipe. You do need to increase the sauce by three times and I thought it cold use more peanuts. I added shrimp along with chicken. It was very messy to make.

I've never had Pad Thai before, so I have nothing to compare this to, but this stuff blew my mind. That said, I read a ton of reviews first and made some changes, which I will also make in the future.  I didn't use any butter.  When I heated the oil for my eggs, I used a little less vegetable oil and added some sesame oil.  I made a double batch of this because I had several extras for dinner, and I tripled the sauce because so many on here had mentioned there wasn't enough of it (I subbed out just a little fish oil for soy).  I used shrimp, and instead of lemons, I used limes.  Also, I used cashews instead of peanuts because it's what I had.  I let everyone add their sriracha so they could control the heat.  I know that's a lot of changes, but I'm giving this a five anyway because without this recipe, I wouldn't have had a jumping-off point.  Shoot, forgot to mention I added shredded carrot and garnished with sesame seeds.  Thanks for the recipe, Transmonicon!

This was my first time making Pad Thai at home and it was delicious! After reading some of the other reviews I doubled the sauce, left out the butter (used extra virgin olive oil), and added some garlic while I was cooking the chicken. I followed the cooking instructions on the package for the noodles,I also added some cooked shrimp and squeezed a lime into the mix instead of a lemon. My boy-friend is a Pad Thai addict and he said it was just as good as the one he eats at the restaurant. Thanks for the tasty and easy recipe!

I'm giving this five stars because it was so good. I added minced garlic to the chicken while it was cooking and I only added 3 eggs. I quadrupled the sauce amount, but instead of sugar I added only 3tbls. dark brown sugar. Also this dish is a must with lime juice and instead of the crushed red pepper I used tabasco sauce instead. Just a note on rice noodles you don't have to let them soak forever. Instead boil water add noodles, boil for a few minutes, turn off heat and let the noodles sit until they are to the tenderness you like. This meal is so fast and simple and really does taste like my fave restaurant. The whole family loves it too.

Good starting point for Pad Thai, although I ended up using a lot of modifications suggested by other members (thanks guys!). Just wanted to say that I marinated the chicken for 2 hours in a mixture of sweet chili sauce, minced garlic and ginger and then cooked it separately before adding to the pad thai in my wok. My family all thought it was great and added tons of flavor!

This recipe was a disaster for me. I am almost sorry I went out and spent money on ingredients just to create this disaster. I will never try this recipe ever again. Two stars is being the nicest I can be. To anyone else planning to make this recipe, DOUBLE or even TRIPLE the sauce or else you will end up writing an angry review like I am.

I made 1 1/2 times the sauce that the recipie called for and I added garlic and green onions to the chicken, a splash of soy sauce, a few tsp of lime juice, and a tsp of peanut butter to the wet ingredients.  I also omitted the butter and cooked the chicken in peanut oil instead.  It tastes just like pad thai from my favorite restaurant after I added these few things, it was also VERY easy and I made it in just a few minutes.  The restaurant I like uses flat rice noodles, so I will look for those next time.  This time I used rice sticks and soaked them for 1 hour, the whole meal was delicious!

Really great base recipe. Used some suggestions from the other reviews. Used 1.5 tsp peanut butter and also added peppers, mushrooms and green onions during the last 3 minutes. My girlfriend and I loved it!

It was fine, but I didn't think it had much flavor. I had to add a lot of spices and sauces to it.

Love it! I change it up just a bit. I use whole grain spaghetti instead of rice noodles. I also add fresh snow peas and shredded fresh carrots when the recipe directs you to add in the noodles. My whole family likes this dish including my 8 and 2 year old!

I've made this recipe twice now. I botched the first attempt by using pansit noodles instead of the thicker rice noodles it calls for. This second time I got the right noodles but will be making the following substitutions next time 1. Fry chicken in sesame oil with garlic. 2. Add in the egg once the liquid has reduced. 3. Use 3/4 the package of noodles it calls for. 4. Double, maybe triple,the sauce and vinegar portions. 
 5. Definitely cook everything as hot as possible so it doesn't get mushy. Thanks for the recipe!

The 30-50 minutes given in the recipe to soak the noodles in cold water was not enough time.  The recipe should call for just a normal 'boil' of the noodles, which would only take 6-8 minutes.  Anyway, after the cold soak, I placed the noodles in the wok.  But the noodles never cooked all of the way, and everything else I had in the wok (eggs, shrimp, etc) began to burn.  

I will not be trying this again.

Very tasty and easy to make! My only changes would be to double (or triple!) the sauce and to add about a tablespoon of peanut butter to the sauce. Instead of meat, I substituted with extra firm tofu (cut into 1 inch cubes and fry in olive oil). My husband and I both loved it! I will definitely make this again.

We didn't like this at all.  Even after doubling the sauce part of the recipe, it was still far too many noodles for the rest of the recipe, quite dry, and tasted funny.

As written I thought this recipe was only ok.  I usually read the reviews before making a new dish but did ot this time and regret it.  The dish was way too dry.  Will make again but with at least twice the sauce as others recommended and see if we like it better.

I made this!  It's wonderful but I added Sriracha HOT Chili Sauce that i purchased at the Chinese grocery store, brought this pad thai to a whole new level of delish!   This version a 3, my version a 5!  I definitely recommend this version as a base.

absolutely triple the sauce components (fish sauce and vinegar); the other ingredients can be increased as you like.  i didn't use the butter and i think the oil was too much as well.  fantastic recipie . . . this is going to save me a lot of trips to pick up dinner from a Thai joint.  :)

I really liked this recipe & my husband said it was one of his favorite things I have ever made. He is a pad thai fanatic! A few things: I added a little red chili sauce to spice it up a little more. It just wasn't spicy enough for me as is. I also garnished it with some cilantro to add another layer. 
Overall, I think this is a good recipe...especially if it is your first time tackling pad thai!

Definitely don't skimp on the crushed peanuts.. You need the crunch! I tried to substitute for Peanut Butter, which was okay, but the crunch is necessary. SAme with the Lemon Wedges! Make sure you use them!

while this wasn't terrible tasting, it didn't taste like Pad Thai.  definitely not enough sauce; which should've been made with lime juice instead of white wine vinegar.  and, the recipe didn't call for peanuts!  that's an essential to Pad Thai.
i do not recommend this one.  there are definitely better Pad Thai recipes out there.

Yum! Followed recipe for the most part, but quadrupled the sauce, as it would have been dry otherwise. I added carrots, broccoli, garlic, and spicy chili sauce. I thought it was great!

I`m  absoultly crazy about pad thai and a few months ago I moved to a part of Quebec where there is no exotic/ international foods and I`ve been craving Pad thai for awhile now. I came upon this recipe and even though I tweeked it a little (added garlic to oil (not butter), used oyster sauce cause I didn`t have fish sauce, added green pepper and big pieces of onion, tripled the sauce and upped the chili cause I love it hot!) it was amazing!!! Just as good as the restaurants in montreal if not better. Thank you sooo much for the satisfying recipe.

This is a good "base" recipe that you can customize to your liking, and simple enough for anyone to make. I took some cues from others and made the following changes: I did half chicken, half firm tofu. I used peanut oil instead of butter, and put in some minced garlic with the chicken. Used Egg Beaters instead of eggs, rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, and splenda instead of sugar. Also added a tsp of smooth peanut butter to the sauce because I like a good peanutty taste, but the sauce still needs some more flavor to it. I will definitely increase the amount of sauce and red pepper next time. Oh, and I cooked the rice noodles according to package directions (boil water, then add the noodles and take off the heat, let sit for about 5 minutes,  drain and rinse in cold water). Soaking the noodles in cold water takes too much time if you are trying to whip this together after work.

Yum! I did a few minor things differently though, but it turned out to be delicious! I chopped about three cloves of garlic beforehand and cooked in the hot oil until they were slightly golden. I then added the chicken, which i seasoned with chili powder, salt and pepper, to the garlic, and continued to follow the recipe. As for the sauce, I doubled it, and added 2 TBS of soy sauce and 1/2 TBS of sriracha (thai chili sauce). Also, I cooked scrambled the eggs separately for better flavor, and used a lime instead of lemon. It was so amazing! My boyfriend went back for FOURTHS. Everyone loved it, and it was cheaper/way better than takeout!

Loved it...tasted as good as many restaurants!  DEFINITELY double the sauce if you like to have a sauce consistency to it.  We did not use butter either...not necessary.  Other than that, followed recipe w/ tweaks that were common in most other reviews.

As written, there is not nearly enough sauce.  I decided to triple the sauce per previous reviews, and also followed one reviewer's excellent advice (ErinJW?)and got my oil in the wok nice and hot, added the scallion and 4-5 cloves of fresh crushed garlic, and then added the chicken and eventually the noodles and sauce.  We used limes instead of lemon, and rice vinegar. I also spiced it up w/ chili garlic sauce (sambal olaek).  THEN it was delicious!

You really can do take-out at home with this recipe.  I omitted the chicken and served this as a side dish with sweet-n-sour chicken meatballs, added in some fresh chopped garlic and a couple of splashes of low sodium soy sauce....DELISH!

This was an absolutely delicious recipe! My boyfriend made it for me tonight, following the recipe precisely, except he used shrimp. The sauce was so nice. The only reason we didn't give it four stars was because the noodles weren't as soft as we had hoped. Maybe boiling them for a bit would help. I am definitely requesting that he make this recipe again. Thanks for it!

My husband and I loved this! It's going to be a staple recipe in my house from now on! Only made a few changes: used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil, rice wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. Added sweet red pepper sauce, garlic, paprika and extra red pepper flakes to the sauce...the amount of which I tripled. Used a mixture of tofu and chicken to give the dish more texture. Added lime juice during cooking (a few squirts from the bottle!) too. But that's it! LOL

Doubled the sauce and added a splash of lime juice as others suggested.  Omitted the butter - not necessary.  I also added one thinly sliced carrot for a little color and texture.  I highly recommend it.  And don't forget the fresh lemon!  That's key. :)

Although I enjoyed preparing this recipe I really think it lacked some flavor. Something is missing. It did say to add spices, but which ones?? The red pepper flakes made it spicey but something is missing. I'll try another recipe.

I've had Pad Thai a few times at different places where there was an Orange glaze all over everything, and it even tasted a bit orangy. I was tempted to try mixing in some orange juice concentrate. The sugar gave it the sweetness that was nice though. It wasn't nearly spicy enough, so I added lots of chili flakes and more of the fish sauce. Also, I couldn't find those rice noodles near where I live, so I used italian style angel hair pasta, which worked great, and took only a few minutes to boil. I also took the liberty of adding a brick of extra firm tofu (shredded), and a couple handfulls of cooked shrimp, it was awesome.

I'm really shocked at some of the rude comments stating that this is not an "authentic" recipe or that it doesn't taste like restaurant pad Thai.  This, in fact, is a very authentic recipe, although it could do with the addition of dried shrimp or tamarind paste. However, for all you experts who added ingredients to make it more authentic, real authentic pad Thai never has, cilantro, peanut butter, green pepper, carrots, peas, cucumber, lemongrass, Sriracha or even green onion. The egg is not scrambled, but fried and broken apart alongside the noodles and combined together with the sauce and noodles. You must realize that most restaurant versions of pad Thai are not authentic either, but Americanized for our tastes. This recipe is very close to the real thing.

Really good! Made a few changes from recommendations. 1. Tripled sauce, but only doubled sugar (also use 1/2 apple cider and half white vinegar since I didn't have white wine vinegar) 2. Cooked chicken in peanut oil and garlic, conned eggs in peanut oil  3. Added carrots and 1 tsp fresh ginger when cooking chicken and eggs together 4. Boiled water, put noodles in, turned off heat and let sit 7-8 min 5. Added a little soy sauce, sweet chili sauce, garlic chili sauce and peanut butter to taste .  This made it pretty legit!

Excellent with some doctoring.  My fiance was stationed near Thailand when he was in the Navy and craves anything Thai.  I spent the extra money (I didn't have) to purchase all the ingredients to make this & it was well worth it.  I subbed Peanut oil for the vegetable oil and  added  2 T Sriracha instead of red pepper flakes (because that's how he had ate it in Thailand) and 2 tsp of fresh garlic and some chives as a personal preference along with a few dashes of chili powder since he claims that in Thailand they ground red chilies and add them in. I also added shrimp along with the chicken for extra oomph.  After lots of prepping time, it all came together nicely and tasted delicious.  My fiance said that it needs more heat, but it was the perfect heat index for me (being a wimp, I guess).  I should also add that upon completion, he asked me where was the cilantro?  Luckily, we have some growing in our garden because "Mr. Thailand"  had to have this traditionally. Now I can make this again since I have all the ingredients on hand. Thank you for submitting.

Great recipe, however I modified it based on the reviews of others. I doubled the sauce (white wine vinegar, fish sauce and sugar). However the next time I will probably 2.5 the sauce maybe even triple. I also cooked the chicken in olive oil with 4 cloves of garlic. I added cilantro (coriander), peanuts and lime (instead of lemon) just before serving. I doubled the green onions. The green onions should be added with the cilantro/peanut/lime as it has the tendency of welting with the heat.

Does not look like your average Pad Thai, but the taste is fresh and light.

Very good recipe. The reason I took away a star is because I did have to sauté some onion and garlic at the star and I did add 1.5 Tbs of Tamarind Paste and a shot of sesame oil. Would definitely add it to my repertoire.

I  followed the recipe and a few of the recommendations [doubling the sauce, adding carrots] and it was terrible. It tasted nothing at all like Pad Thai. I will not be making this again.

The flavor ingredient proportions were way off; using the instructions as stated, it was way too sweet and wayyyy too fishy. Next time I will use the recipe that uses tamarind paste and I will shell out for it despite it being hard to find. I added soy sauce, three times the amount of white wine vinegar, some peanut butter, and water and let it simmer for a while to let the flavors either mellow or blend better.

My hubby made this tonight. We tripled the sauce per the reviews and we didn't have any bean sprouts. We also used quick cook chinese noodles instead of rice noodles and put organic natural peanut butter in the sauce because we had no peanuts. We loved it. I am sure there are more complex pad thai recipes out there but this one was fairly simple and very delicious.

I have loved many recipes on the website but very few have been as "perfect" as this one. I would only suggest that you have plenty of fish sauce and wine vinegar on hand as my concoction absorbed quite a bit more than what was called for in the recipe. However, the proportions were perfect. I stole a few ideas from another recipe and substituted shredded carrots for bean sprouts, and served it with crushed cashews and cilantro. However, as written it is the best pad thai I have ever had, including restaurant offerings. Thank you!!

The whole family liked this one.  I thought there were way too many noodles and not enough bean sprouts.  I'll modify it next time to see how it goes.  I did find this recipe a bit greasy, so I'll omit the butter as mentioned in many of the reviews.

This is an excellent recipe that will become a regular in our house. I made it twice; with shrimp and with chicken. I tripled the sauce, added extra heat using red pepper sauce, and added just less than a tablespoon of peanut butter.

READ OTHER REVIEWS FIRST BEFORE TRYING THIS RECIPE.

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews for other people's tips and now I regret it. I used an additional 2oz of noodles than listed in the recipe (that was just the size of my package), and my noodles were SO dry. I added more fish sauce, soy sauce, sriracha, the juice of one lime, oil, and it just wasn't helping. Someone mentioned peanut butter, so I will try that next time too. This recipe doesn't include cilantro, which I thought was a must, so I added it as well. I also bought a small package of firm tofu and added it with the chicken. I'm not sure why my noodles weren't cooking well, so I ended up throwing them in another pan and adding a little bit of water which I let evaporate. It seemed to have helped soften the noodles, but maybe there was something I could have done differently.

This was my first time making pad thai, so I will leave that as a disclaimer. I have a lot of leftovers, so I think I will go and try to make additional sauce, if possible. I also feel like this recipe didn't have enough ingredients? I am new to thai cooking, but I felt like this was lackluster.

very good, easy recipe.  also recommend tripling the sauce, and you can experiment with peanut butter, soy sauce, ketchup, chili sauce - just taste as you go.  i followed the advice to boil the rice noodles (i used rice vermicelli) for one minute then let sit off the heat for 5 min - much faster prep!  i'll make this again, but will add vegetables next time (maybe carrot, snow peas, regular peas?), as it does look a little plain - also recommend LOTS of green onion for garnish - adds flavour and looks super appetizing.  i made it with just shrimp

Everyone really liked this dish.  I would highly recommending to make extra sauce.  I tripled the sauce and could have done more.  We had left-overs and it was a little dry.  All around the flavor was great.

I made mine with tofu because I'm a vegetarian.  However, that didn't really change the recipe.  I did add about 1/2 cup of peanut butter sauce that i made by mixing peanut butter, fish sauce, and sugar.  

Great starting recipe for Pad Thai!

This was a decent basic recipe. I added peanut butter, cilantro, and used rice vinegar instead of vinegar. I will use butter next time, NOT oil. The eggs will get a nice taste and color in butter.

Made this and it turned out awful... did what others suggested and soaked the noodles in boiling water (they said 10 minutes) I only soaked about 8 and they were nothing but mush.. doubled the sauce ingredients and all you could taste was vinegar & fish sauce... I used boneless pork loin and tofu... added red & orange peppers like others suggested... threw everything away and very expensive in the trash :(

What I did differently:
I tripled the sauce, but only doubled the amount of sugar.  
I boiled the noodles for 1 minute and then let them sit in water (i would drain after boiling and then sit in cold water b/c they broke apart really easily).
I only used 6 oz of noodles and it made a lot!
I added some of the grn onions while cooking. 
I didn't have peanuts so I added 2 big spoons of crunchy peanut butter.
I would add the sauce before you add the noodles.
I used lime instead of lemon at the end.

This was good--but def double or even triple the sauce.  I tripled it and felt it was just enough, I can't imagine less, it would have been dry.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic (because garlic makes everything better).  We found the bean sprouts a little firm, wondering if we throw them in to cook a little earlier, if that would soften them.  I would def make this again--oh and we used a lime instead of lemon.  Never heard of a lemon on Pad Thai--that seems odd to me.  Oh yeah, and the rice noodles you can boil for 1 min, then sit in the water for 5 min and drain.  Just as good and much faster.

Good basic recipe.  Have to admit that
it was a jumping off point for our house.
Add peanut butter, double or triple for more 
sauce etc.  But was a great starter.

If you are disappointed that this doesn't look/taste like your local restaurant's, it is likely because you are missing the KETCHUP most American Thai restaurants use in theirs. Ask anyone who's ever cooked in one.

Everyone liked it.  Was a little short on the spice so I'd add more crushed red pepper.  Or, in our case, we added Siracha sauce. Next time I will slice the chicken and add cilantro too.

This recipe is an okay base, but it really needs some work. First of all, as other reviewers said, you must double or even triple the sauce. The amount of crushed red pepper is nothing, so don't be afraid of that. I added a few things to make the flavor a little better. I squeezed some lime juice in. I put in 2 small carrots and a red pepper for color, texture, and taste. And most importantly in my opinion, I added a lot of fresh chopped cilantro. That is a key ingredient that's missing. Feel free to play with the sauce base as well, I added 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce.

As I put cooking this, I honestly thought it was going to taste awful.  Fish sauce has a strong oder and I thought it was going to take over the meal.  Boy, was I wrong!!  No more ordering take out for me!  This was delicious!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Killer!!!! but " mommy'slearningtocook" was right, double the sauce for enough flavor. Also, I added crushed penuts while I was cooking witch also added some good taste. be sure to make enough noodles! juet cook them instead of soaking them, Much Faster!  my friend straight out of is coming straght out of Korea, see if it passes the test!

Taste great. Makes for a unique dinner without too much work. I found it nessecary to increase the oil and sauces, but this may be a matter of personal taste.

Pretty close to the local Pad Thai restaurant we frequently visit. Doubling the sauce is a must. I used a tsp. less of the fish sauce and added crushed red pepper and cayenne for a little extra kick. The family loved. So much that they wiped out the leftovers I was so looking forward to!

This recipe is quite good.  However, I did change the recipe some & it turned out AMAZING.  It was just as good, if not better than any restaurant version.  First of all, I used Tofu in addition to chicken.  Also, I substituted the white wine vinegar, fish sauce (yuck), and white sugar for an entirely different sauce.  The local grocery store sells a Thai Peanut sauce which is a Leann Chin version.  I used this as my sauce.  I also added this to the chicken as I was cooking it.  I used the pepper to taste.  Also, I squeezed an entire lime into it.  I like mine to be a little tangy & I know they use lime at my local restaurants.  YUM!!

REALLY GOOD as long as you double or triple the sauce. I mix the sauce in a bowl beforehand and pour over the noodles until all of the noodles are soaked. Cook long enough so that extra sauce in bottom of pan is gone and noodles are soft. Adjust pepper as you go. The only downside is the awful smell of cooking with fish oil. You might want to have extra candles burning while cooking it...

This recipe was great for the first time making Pad Thai at home! My borfriend and I are MAJOR Pad Thai lovers so we've had our share and we gave this one 2 thumbs up! We used only 2 eggs, 3 fresh chili peppers, we added more sauce, and used olive oil, lots of peanut, and a ton more green onion! But that was for our taste! Overall still awesome!

Excellent with modifications suggested by previous posters.  Highly recommend increasing the amount of sauce by 3x.  I added just a bit of sweet chili sauce, red pepper flakes and cayenne to bump the heat.  Added shrimp and carrots too.  I fried four cloves of garlic and two green onions then added the chicken to brown.  This recipe is a keeper!

I followed this recipe to the "T", except that I doubled the sauce ingredients.  I was really disappointed - it was  not very flavorful.  It doesn't even come close to the taste of restaurant Pad Thai.  For me, it wasn't worth the effort - I will not be making this again.

As suggested, I added garlic when I sauteed the chicken (chopped in 1/2" chunks), I tripled the sauce, added 3 tablespoons peanut butter, added shredded carrots, and used rice vinegar.  This was excellent!  I'll use half the sugar next time, but that probably helped make it excellent.

We really liked this recipe! It's not the same as in our local take-out restaurants, but we like that. I added an onion, 2 garlic cloves as per someone's suggestion, and replaced the bean sprouts with a green pepper cut in strips, and used boneless chicken thighs. Would make again.

I liked it! Be sure to squeeze fresh lime on it when it's served. Mine needed more sauce - twice/triple what was recommended.  I was expecting it to be a more vibrant orange color, but it wasn't.

This was very good.  Like other reviewers, I used peanut oil instead of butter and peanut butter.  The grocery store closest to me doesn't carry fish sauce.  I'll add it next time, but didn't really miss it.  I also used brown sugar instead of white and cider vinegar since this is what I had.

This was fantastic!!! Tasted like the restaurant version, and surprisingly easy and fun to make. Changes: 
1. Used 1/4 cup peanut oil instead of butter.
2. Fried 2 cloves garlic in peanut oil.
3. Used 1/2 tablespoon red pepper.
4. Added 1 teaspoon peanut butter.
5. Added 1 tablespoon lime juice at end.
6. Omitted lemon
7. Just boiled bean sprouts for 5 mins, then drained and rinsed with cold water.

Great recipe!

Not a bad recipe.  Do see one of the first comments that included alternate directions.  I also omitted the butter and followed their instructions, also adding rice vinegar and plenty of garlic.  I would also recommend shallots as an optional addition.

I liked this recipe and decided to combine other member reviews with what I had in my kitchen.  I followed Erinjw recipe and I used only chicken because I bought the wrong type of Tofu :-(  I also used red wine vinegar mixed with the fish sauce, lime juice, white sugar (orig recipe).  I also used ground almonds (put almonds in a baggie and whacked with a hammer---FUN) instead of peanuts, can you say YUMMY.  I omitted the crushed red pepper and put the cilantro in for the last few turns.  I also did use bean sprouts and more lime juice.  I also followed another reviewer and boiled rice noodles for a minutes, didn't get to rinse in cold water, but it still worked (made it sticky)  I think it was overall this was a great recipe.  I can't wait to eat again for lunch tomorow.

This dish is a huge hit at my house!  It is probably my husband's favorite meal.  It's easy to make (just double the sauce recipe) and will not last long, I promise!  Thank you for a great recipe!!!

I use this recipe pretty often now although  my husband and I think it tastes more like Bun Xao (from Saigon Grill in NYC) then Pad Thai.  I often use shrimp in place of chicken.  I also usually decrease the sugar and increase the fish sauce.

I was pleased with the flavor. It didnt have the Pad Thai color so i added a squirt of ketchup. I also doubled the sauce. After one hour of soaking, my noddles were still very firm. So i boiled it for just a min. and let it sit. To fault of my own.. my noodles ended up being softer than i prefer. Next time, i will let it sit in boiling hot water for a few mins and ckeck frequently. I will make this again.

This Pad Thai was great. I did make a few adjustments as recommended by other reviewers that i think definitely helped: tripled the sauce, added 2 tspns of peanut butter, added some shredded carrots instead of sprouts

I liked it. I liked the fact that there wasn't too many crazy ingredients that I'd have to figure out how to use up later! Next time, I'll probably make more of the sauce like others suggested. Thanks!

I am eating this right now...it is not too bad...it is a good base I need to adjust it to my taste...like everyone else I added 3 times the sauce..a little peanut butter and a bunch of soy sauce...It is pretty close to the resturant...I was nervous when making it because the fish sauce smelled discusting! but when everything was mixed together it turned out pretty good! I will make it again

Excellent dish!  It really tastes like restaurant Pad Thai.  I only used 3 eggs, and I tripled the sauce and only cooked the noodles according to the noodle package as others had recommended.  I can't believe how good this ended up tasting.

Simply excellent! I doubled, probably almost tripled the sauce, cut down a little bit on the red pepper, and added shredded carrots to the mix. I have made this recipe for numerous amounts of people and they always rave over it.

I cut the butter and oil in half.  The noodles weren't "glistening" like they do in the restaurants, but the taste was still there.  Will deffinatly reduce the crushed red pepper to 1 Tbsp.  It was so spicy, it brought tears to my wife's eyes.

One thing I have learned since discovering allrecipes.com: It is foolish to expect to recreate at home your favorite dish from your favorite restaurant. Very rarely will you succeed, so you're better off leaving it to the 'experts.' However, we are partial to Pad Thai every now and again, so I thought I'd give this a go. No, this was not as good as other PTs we've had at restaurants, but it was extremely tasty. The only change I made was to omit the lemon, and add a splash of lime juice. Thanks for a great recipe!

I agree with many of the reviews here on doubling the sauce. However, since I was just making for the hubby and me I decided to half the noodles and chicken, and added shrimp. Perfect. I also added the peanut butter, and lightly salted peanuts. My hubby had never had Pad Thai, so I we went to a restaurant a couple of nights later so the taste would be fresh in his mind. He said what came out of the recipe was very comparable and would love having it again. Thanks!

This recipe was only so-so for us.  It came out slightly bland even though I doubled the fish sauce and added some regular soy sauce.  The color was also unappetizing, so I added a bit of dark sweet soy to give it a slightly browner appearance.  We did like the zip the red pepper flakes added.  But unless you really like bland food, you'll have to play around with the rest of the seasonings to make it more desirable.

Like others before me, I doubled the sauce ingredients -- but forgot to just double the wet ingredients :P.  I don't mind sweet, so it wasn't awful, but I don't recommend it :D.  

Also: rather than butter, I stir-fried the chicken in pre-packaged minced garlic in oil (1 tsp.) and a little water, and added 1 tbsp. crunchy peanut butter to coat the chicken before adding the noodles and sauce.  I tried following the directions on my noodle package, but left the thin rice sticks on boiling water for longer than the recommended 2 mins -- unless you want mush, stick to the directions on your package, or try the soak method.  Despite my blunder, dish still tasted great!

Excellent recipe, tastes just like the "street-style" pad thai served at the Green Mango in Toronto. I enjoy this type much more than the more spaghetti-sauce flavoured types that are popular. I doubled the wet ingredients for the sauce as some suggested and it was just a tad overpowering, but all in all the best recipe I've found here.

This wasn't exactly what I expected.  My husband made this last night.  Is the recipe really supposed to have 1/8 CUP of red pepper?!  We put wa-a-a-y less than that, and it was plenty spicy!  It was okay, but I'll probably keep looking for a Pad Thai recipe.

yummy.  Rave reviews from my roommates.  I had to make part of it vegetarian by exchanging chicken for tofu and not using fish sauce.  I didn't try the vegetarian version, but I was still told it was yummy.  I also followed everyone else's advice - doubled the sauce, added some sesame oil, and about a tablespoon of peanut butter.  Good stuff.

We recently got back from a trip to Thailand which inspired me to try cooking Thai food at home. This stuff is much better than the prepackaged meals you can get in the store. And much better than the pre-made sauces. It's worth the extra effort -- and there's not much effort at that. The dish was very easy to make and I've already made it a few times and for company.

This is such a good recipe. I added 2 cloves of garlic to the butter and chicken. I also doubled the sauce. It was very flavorful, so I'm not sure it would have been as good without the extra sauce. 
I also garnished with fresh cilantro, green onions, peanuts, and lime. This one's a keeper!

Wonderful!  I suggest using seasoned rice wine vinegar for a rich yet mellow flavor.

This was not a very good Pad Thai recipe.  It called for way too many noodles and was not very flavorful.

WOW! This recipe is outstanding!  I didn't beleive I could make good Pad Thai at home, but I was wrong!  Any Pad Thai lover can make this at home easily and will love it.  I also used less noodles (7oz.) but didn't scale any of the other ingredients.  It was perfect!  It is very spicy, so some people may like less pepper.  Thanks for sharing this one!

Great recipe that can be tailored to any taste. Family loved it! I did take advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce, it needed it. Used shrimp instead of chicken and added broccoli slaw as couldn’t find bean sprouts at the store. Yum.

We loved this! But I did make some adjustments hence the 4 stars... I tripled the sauce, used chicken and shrimp, added sweet onions and green onions during the cooking and we used lime instead of lemon. A squirt of sriracha before eating... it was absolutely delicious!

This tasted just like Pad Thai from top thai restaurants. I did read the reviews and took some of those recommendations into consideration. I tripled the sauce per recommendation and made these additions:
 
1 heaping teaspoon of creamy peanut butter. 
1 Tbsp lime juice and skipped the lime slices. 
3 heaping teaspoons of Sriracha garlic chili sauce.
Reduced to 3 eggs and kept the butter as I know that will make the scrambled eggs taste much better than oil. 

I cooked my chicken thighs separately in the oven (don't ask someone has ocd issues with raw meat (not me). LOL I threw a thigh on the plate with the Pad Thai surrounding it, and it was devoured.

I made this recipe with spaghetti squash instead of noodles. I garnished it with cilantro, crushed peanuts, and lime juice. It was delicious and super easy to make. I am going to try to cut down on the oil next time.

I followed the recipe closely except I added a couple grounded garlic cloves, grounded fresh ginger, sambal olek for spice mostly, kashmiri chili powder, sesame oil along with the vegetabl and some soy sauce. A lot of recipes call for tamarind paste or sweet radish but the ginger worked pretty well for me. It was pretty spicy but I like spicy food. I just added everything to taste but it tasted really good, great recipe.

SO GOOD! Per other reviews, these are the changes I made- I omitted the butter and sautéed chicken in olive oil with some garlic. I used about 1 Tbsp of sesame oil instead of vegetable for the eggs. I doubled the sauce, but used rice vinegar instead and only 4 Tbsp sugar. I also added 2 Tbsp peanut sauce, 2 Tbsp sweet chili sauce, minced garlic, and lots more pepper flakes. I also garnished with lime instead of lemon. Turned out AMAZING!! So quick & easy. I will be making this on the regular!!
** For noodles, I used pre-cooked “KA•ME Thai Rice Stir-Fry Noodles” from Pick’N’Save because that’s all I could find, and they worked fine. No need to soak noodles for an hour.

Perfect as is. Follow the directions first time,  no substitutions unless you have an allergy or something. As a personal preference,  I will double the sauce ingredients. 
I have used tofu when I didn't have chicken, pork, or beef.  Works beautifully.  Lime can easily be used instead of lemon.

We love this recipe!  I followed other's advice and doubled the sauce. I also sautéed the chicken with 2 cloves of garlic, subbed Stevia for the sugar and I added a half cup of shredded carrots for flavor/color.  The flavors blend so well and the results make for a wonderful dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

While this tastes ok, it is definitely missing tamarind (the tangy taste, also adds color). I know tamarind is not popular in some countries, but it really is worth it to find some. Asian stores will usually have easy to use tamarind paste or juice in a can since fresh tamarind is difficult to work with. Lemon juice is an OK replacement, but it just isn't quite the same.

I'm giving this 3, because of my changes, but it was a good base dish. 
Firstly, I tripled the sauce, like others recommended to cover all the noodles.
Next,  I added about 2 or so tablespoons soy sauce and maybe 1 tablespoon mirin, which sweetened it nicely (I only added 3 tablespoons sugar when I tripled the rest) and  squeezed a whole lime over the finished dish(I prefer lime over lemon for pad thai) Also, I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used rice wine vinegar instead. 
Oh, and I switched the veg oil for sesame oil and a drizzle of chili oil to spice it up.

My husband and I love Pad Thai and have cooked it a few times on our own but without a serious recipe. This recipe is good but as others have commented it is a good basic framework and needed more flavor for me.  We sauteed Tofu with a different recipe and added it after omitting the chicken this time. I will definitely alternate this with meat, seafood, or Tofu depending what we are in the mood for. I will definitely be cooking the meat in garlic or adding minced garlic to the oil that I cook the egg in.  I whisked the sugar, fish sauce, and vinegar together before adding to the noodles and eggs so that it mixed with it all more thoroughly.  I used a bit more of each because I had a package of 16 oz noodles (recipe calls for 12 oz.) Honestly could have doubled them all other than the sugar for more flavor. Next time I will be adding 2 TBS of Tamari, I will use a few more red pepper flakes than called for, and will be also adding 2 TBS of sesame oil to the noodle/egg mixture for flavor. Or cutting a bit of the 1/4 Cup of Veggie Oil and making up the difference with 4 TBS of sesame oil - it gave it more depth of flavor. The picture displays Cilantro but they forgot to list it in the recipe. I would also use Lime instead of lemon. Otherwise it was a delicious, basic, successful Pad Thai recipe that allows the cook to be inventive. Thank you! Ah, and now having watched the video I see that they suggest Tamarind Paste for a more authentic taste and doubling the vinegar (which I d

I made four changes to this recipe to make it perfect. I added soy and peanut sauce to the Thai sauce and made at least four times the amount suggested. I also made it spicy. This is the beat recipe for basic Pad Thai!

This was my first time using fish sauce. I kept waiting for the smell to dissipate while it was cooking, but it didn't. I figured maybe it would taste better than it smelled, but it still tasted like rotting death. When I later talked to friends that use fish sauce in their cooking, they said anything more than 1/4-1/2 tsp is going to be hard to eat.

Husband loved it, made it with rice instead of noodles the first time. Added a tablespoon of hoisin sauce and a tablespoon of sriracha in place of the red pepper flakes. Gave it a sweet spicy flavor, but the spicy didn’t over power the dish. Made it with noodles and chicken thighs the second time. I liked it better with the noodles, but I also prefer the dish with chicken breast instead of thighs. All in all a very simple very delicious recipe! I loved it, will be making again!!

I used 200g of rice noodles. Used rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. I placed garlic in the oil before adding the chicken, I wish I can marinade it before hand so it had more taste. Doubled the sauce recipe and then added a tablespoon of peanut butter.  I accidentally made my egg too thick. My family and friends liked it but requested I add more sauce next time.

This recipe is great as written. I adjusted it to my taste by adding some garlic, peanut butter, sesame oil, splash of chicken stock, and more crushed red pepper. The good thing about pad Thai is it is versatile and accepts many flavors and comes out great.

Good recipe! It was my first time making pad thai, and this turned out pretty good. I took a few reccos mentioned in the other reviews, and opted for some of my preferred healthier alternatives: Sub Apple Cider Vinegar (diluted) for white wine vinegar, organic lower-sodium Tamari sauce instead of fish sauce,  cane sugar instead of white sugar, olive oil for butter, and added minimal amounts of peanut butter, paprika, cumin, chili garlic sauce, and lime juice to the sauce mix, whisked together. I would also recommend doubling this amount of sauce to serve 12-16 oz of noodles.

Just okay. I had to make way more sauce just to coat the noodles. I ended up also adding soy sauce, making it more spicy, and adding garlic and ginger. I also added some cilantro as a topping, (come Americans think cilantro is a herb only used in Mexican or other Latin American food, but it is used in Asian dishes as well).

Add a big tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter (maybe 1/3 of a cup), triple the fish sauce, more vegetable oil and add about two cups of water from the noodles.

After cooking the chicken in butter and oil, add an onion, a bell pepper and one or two diced jalapenos, depending on the size.

This was a great base recipe - very authentic!  I did make a few changes: used shrimp sauteed in coconut oil instead of chicken and butter and due to a lack of sprouts,  garnished with scallions, sliced red pepper and carrot for the crunch.  I also added a tablespoon of peanut butter to the sauce.   I will absolutely make this again!!

This recipe turns out very dry with very little flavor distinctive of ‘standard’ restaurant-style Pad Thai.  Some of the reviewers give helpful tips, but I wish they would just submit their own recipe, so we can let this one fall by the wayside.

Followed previous suggestions written: doubled the sauce (with all the noodles called for in the recipe I could’ve tripled the sauce!), added 2tsp peanut butter and mixed it in well at the end.  Served with sides: lime wedges, cilantro, crushed peanuts, chives, cucumber.  Will add snow peas/sliced lettuce/sliced carrots next time to sneak in more veg.

This turned out very good and was so simple!  As recommend by other cooks, I doubled the sauce which was much needed. I also will use less egg next time, too.

Love! I doubled the sauce, but should have trippled or quadrupled it, especially for the sake of the leftovers. However, if you're heating leftovers, add a couple tablespoons of water, and that will add some moisture back into the dish (worked for us).

This is really good! My only complaint is the sauce seemed weak compared to the takeout versions I have had. Takeout usually has a strong flavor in the noodles and this was pretty mild. Next time I make it I think I'll double the sauce. I did a vegetable stir fry version with shrimp and we really enjoyed it! That said. my hubby who normally hates pad thai loves this version - so there's that! :-)

I have had Pad Thai from every restaurant that I've ever dined in that had Pad Thai on the menu.  The way this recipe is written makes this version a close second to hot garbage.  BUT WAIT!  I wish I would have read through the comments and reviews prior to starting.  Simple things like garlic, soy sauce, heat, and doubling the recipe can salvage it and make it restaurant quality.  I don't know why the ratings are so high for this recipe when it needs so much work.  I wish someone would revise this recipe.

This recipe is easy and for those who think it's bland, try it with Sirache sauce. It's delicious with shrimp, chicken, beef or pork. Try it with a combination, but the Sirache sauce really gives it a kick.

I tripled the sauce and added peanut butter like one review mentioned. Also tripled the red peppers. Still no heat.
It wasn't great, edible, but that's about it.  I probably wouldn't make it again. 
I put some Mongolian fire oil on it and that made a big difference.

A good starter but I read several reviews and made many changes according to those reviews. I used a pound of raw deveined shrimp, add 3 cloves of garlic to the oil before I sauted the shrimp. I tripled the sugar and quadrupled the rest of the sauce ingredients plus add 2 T peanut butter and 4 T soy sauce. I omitted bean sprouts and added 1 cup of shredded carrots and a bunch of green onions. I cooked the carrots and onions 2 minutes before adding shrimp, noodles and sauce to skillet. topped with chopped peanuts, cilantro and I used lime instead of lemon.

Flavor profile is spot on but I found the recipe a bit bland, as if it was missing something and there wasn't enough seasoning of what was there.

Added some sriracha and it helped a ton.  Chili paste from the same company is probably the missing ingredient.  Will test.

Excellent as is but wanted more peanut flavor. As per other reviewers doubled sauce, added garlic, switched the lemon out for lime, and added a tsp of peanut butter for each batch of sauce. Added some hot curry for the husband. Excellent recipe!

It was too dry and too bland. I've decided maybe I just don't like pad thai.  I used half the specified amount of fish sauce, as the aroma was too much to get past.  I didn't use peanuts, as I didn't have any on hand.  I should have increased the amount of sprouts, as I like them.  My husband said he would eat it again. He won't get to, as I won't make it again.

After reading at least 148 of the reviews, I edited the recipe following the general consensus and the result for definitely a huge hit for the family. Here is my updated version if you're interested... 

I used 2 eggs instead of 4 and 2 tbsp. vegetable oil instead of butter. I also added 4 cloves of minced garlic and an onion thinly sliced. I added paprika, peanut butter, soy sauce and lime juice to the sauce. I also added a couple slivered carrots

Sauce proportions [1 ½ tablespoons rice wine vinegar, 3 tablespoons fish sauce, 3 tablespoons white sugar, ¼ tablespoon crushed red pepper, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 ½ tablespoon peanut butter (smooth), ¾ tablespoon soy sauce, 1 large lime, juiced].      Mix together vinegar, fish sauce, sugar, red pepper, paprika, peanut butter, soy sauce and lime juice in a bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds to mix in peanut butter more evenly.       Heat 2 tbsp oil in a wok or large heavy skillet. Sauté chicken until partially cooked. Add 1/3 of the sauce to the chicken and cook until reduced.     Heat ¼ cup oil in wok over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic and cook until onions become translucent.     Crack beaten eggs into the hot oil, and scramble until firm.      Stir in carrots, and cook for 5 minutes. 
    Add the remaining 2/3 of the sauce to the wok and cook until sauce begins to reduce.     Mix partially cooked rice noodles and cook until tender. Add bean sprouts, and cook for another 3 minutes.     Garnish with coriander, crushed peanu

Very good, though I did modify it a bit. I doubled the amount of white wine vinegar and fish sauce, as recommended by other reviewers. I didn't use butter, and used less than a 1/4 cup of canola oil. I also added some finely sliced 2-1/2 in. (approx.) lengths  of carrot and celery with the green onion, and actually forgot to add the bean sprouts. I soaked the 3 mm (dry)/10 mm (when cooked) rice vermicelli noodles in room temperature water for an hour, but they still weren't soft enough to use, so I dropped them in boiling water for a minute and they were perfect. I also added a tbsp of peanut butter to the heated sauce. I also cut 3 slices of lemon, then cut each slice into 8 small wedges, and heated these  with the veggies.

Very tasty! I doubled the sauce (less than doubled the sugar), doubled the red pepper flakes, added a touch of sweet chili sauce, and used shrimp, but didn't make any other changes. Will definitely make this again!

It was good, I would make it again. My notes going forward (followed the recipe and instructions to a T) would be to cook the chicken and eggs less (they were dry), I wish there was more of a sauce, incorporate the green onions AND peanuts with the bean sprouts. Also, it's better the next day.

Based on others' reviews, I tripled the sauce, added a splash of ketchup, used white vinegar.  I sautéed chicken in a separate pan then added the egg to it.  Soaked noodles at room temp for about 45 minutes.

We thought this was a very good dish. I followed recipe with the exception of red curry paste, that added some really great flavor. Only thing i will change next time is the amount of oil. I will reduce that because it was a bit oily. Great recipe though.

Very yummy and super simple. Changed it up a little - used shrimp instead of chicken (which I marinated lightly with Thai sweet chili sauce). I whisked the sugar, vinegar, fish sauce, and oil together with the juice of 1 whole lime and freshly diced Thai chilies (instead of crushed red pepper). Then I made a little stir-fry with onions, red cabbage, and sugar snap peas - cooked that while the noodles were soaking. After getting a nice sauté on the veggies I added the eggs, and after the eggs were cooked I added the shrimp. Let it simmer a bit while I drained the noodles, then added the noodles and poorer the sauce over everything. I served cilantro, green onions, lines and crushed peanuts on the side. It was a total hit - prep and cook time under an hour, and everyone loved it (even my picky teenager had seconds). Will definitely use this again.

I used bean thread instead and added some summer squash, nappa, and pea pods. When I think of Thai I expect spicy so I added red curry paste. I thought there wasn't enough liquid so I added some coconut milk to ingredients.

Has anyone even eaten real pad Thai?
This is the worst recipe ever. It's missing so many ingredients.
Sorry but this is not traditional pad thai

I love Pad Thai, but where my husband and I live we don't have any Thai Restaurants nearby. So I decided to try out this Pad Thai recipe!
It was very tasty, but I did make a few changes to this recipe to fit my own personal tastes. I added garlic, ginger and scallions to the oil when I cooked my chicken. I also added a half pound of tofu to this recipe. 
I followed Maria's tip and used 3/4 tablespoon of peanut butter, with each serving of sauce as well. 

For my first time making Pad Thai, I was very happy, and I will probably be using and adding on to this recipe again!

Wonderful recipe! Tripled the sauce as suggested. Used A tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce because it has tamarind in it. I couldn't find tamarind at the store.  Added minced garlic with the chicken as suggested by others. It turned out fantastic served with some sariacha on the side for people who want it more spicy. Thanks for a great recipe!

Switched up the recipe like previous reviews - I like plenty of sauce so multiplied the recipe by 4 but reduced the sugar.  Lime  instead of lemon was perfect plus I used lots of crushed peanuts and fresh garlic and added finely sliced onion.  Placed raw beansprouts and green onion on top of the noodles just before serving - was absolutely delicious!!!  Wont be going back to tamarind paste again!!

I doubled the sauce as others suggested and was glad that I did. The amount written wouldn't have been enough for me. This doesn't taste like the Pad Thai in my local restaurant, but it was tasty and much lighter. I will definitely make this again!

I thought the recipe was good! I did a few things different. 1) I tripled the sauce and also used Brown sugar instead of white. 3) I used tofu, onion and garlic, Thai basil, as well as shrimp. 4) after I threw in the noodles, I also poked a few holes in a habanero pepper/chile panamanio and threw it in 5) I topped with cilantro too

I love Pad Thai and Thai food in general. It's a bit pricey to eat out, so I thought I would make my own and give it a try. Its very easy and tastes just as good as one of my favorite restaurants. I will be making this again! After reading a few reviews, I did add garlic along with doubling the sauce. I even added shrimp and I am very happy I did.

Turned out great. Made a few changes, I quadrupled the sauce ingredients and added couple tbsp soya sauce and 1/4 c chunky peanut butter. I've made it a couple ways, once with chicken, once with prawns. The chicken was good, but the prawns were a huge hit in my household.

I did use others suggestions to the recipe. I tripled the sauce.  I also cooked the noodles in boiling water for one minute and let sit for five minutes to speed up the process. My family likes their food spicy, so I added 3tsp of red pepper flakes. I like shrimp and chicken so I added both. limes instead of lemon also. Delicious!

The recipe is ok as a base for a pad thai, but it requires plenty of modifications, like much more seasoning, etc. So, all the basics are there, but be aware that following the recipe precisely will leave you with something of mediocre taste.

Great recipe to start with! I made a few adjustments: boiled the noodles, doubled/tripled the vinegar and fish oil, added a tablespoon of peanut butter, and cooked the chicken with minced garlic.

This was my first attempt at pad thai.  I did follow some review tips and added 1 tbsp of peanut butter to the sauce and also added a bit of hot sauce to give it a bit of a kick.  I doubled the sauce as some suggested but think I will triple it next time as was a little dry.  I used red wine vinegar instead of white. The biggest thing I did wrong was that I did not soak the noodles long enough so they were a little chewy. One tip here I can share if anyone else makes this and finds the noodles are not soft enough, put a bit of water in the finished pan of pad thai and place a lid on it and steam on low heat for 5-10 min.  This helps to soften the noodles after the dish is  already done. Very tasty and I will make again :)

I made this with refrigerated soy rice style noodles and it was amazing. Lots of changes, per my usual. No Butter, I cooked everything in coconut oil. I sautéed garlic and ginger and crushed pepper  then threw in sliced leftover prime rib. Then tossed in scallions(twice what was called for) Our local markets don't carry bean sprouts so next it was the noodles to warm. For the sauce I only used 1.5 tbsp of coconut sugar, it was perfect and not too sweet. Then I squeezed in half a lime (not lemon) and served wedges with plates. Generous peanuts and cilantro topped it all off. I also added a couple of quick scrambled eggs, sliced.

Crazy good, fed 5 teenagers on a double batch and there was nothing left. I looked through the reviews, decided to fry the chicken with garlic and oil, and as instructed added a tablespoon of peanut butter with each batch, then added carrot matchsticks and thinly slice red pepper, when done, added lemon and lime, crushed peanuts, thin slice green onions and cilantro. The success is in the remains - none!

As per the advice of several comments, I added in chopped garlic with the chicken and increased the sauce ingredients. I did have to add a little water and put a lid on the end to finish cooking the noodles, but I think that was more on me (don't think I let the noodles soak long enough). Love this recipe.

Loved it! I did add sauteed mushrooms and green peppers to the recipe. I also took "Maria"'s recommendation and added double the fish sauce along with 3/4 teaspoon peanut butter. Dash of onion and garlic powder and presto!

I drive an hour away to get pad Thai that tastes this good.  I added regular onion and some garlic while frying the chicken.  Then I topped with cilantro, lime and peanuts.  It was delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy recipe! I didn't have chicken, so I omitted that. I also added a tablespoon of soy sauce and 2 teaspoons of brown sugar. I think it made the flavor bolder and it added a bit of color too!

This was delish! I made it with shrimp and subbed sesame oil for butter. Added a couple big dollops of peanut butter. Definitely don't cook rice noodles for more than a minute or just soak as directed--if you do boil, remember to rinse afterward.

I followed the recipe amounts exactly for the sauce and it didn't taste like anything!! There was way too little sauce for the amount of noodles.  The sauce also didn't have any color, which was a total turn-off for my family.  The dish looked bland and colorless and had little taste.  I will continue my search for a good homemade pad Thai recipe.

I made this and it came out so good. The only changes I made were instead of using chicken I used carrots and bok choy. I also double the sauce like a lot of people suggested. I made this for a football game and all my friends loved it. My mom even had the left overs the next day. I will definitely make this again I'll just use  a little less fish sauce.

I listened to others and trippled the sauce. I can't imagine it tasting very good without doing that. I also added peanut butter and used olive oil and not butter.  I like spicy food so we added a lot more chile peppers but that's our personal choice it tastes good with less peppers too.

Tripled sauce, added 1 T peanut butter and a half t of Asian garlic chili paste, and substituted rice wine vinegar or white vinegar, also used 1T less sugar.   used leftover cooked chicken (just browned it in some butter), added a little sesame oil to the egg. Added carrot strips and mushrooms, too.  Overall really good!! Will make again!

Delicious.  it was a little dry so maybe the addition of some chicken broth would be helpful.

I made adjustments because of another pad Thai meal I had that was the only time I liked it.  I added tofu,  bean sprouts, enoki mushrooms, and a little peanut butter.  It turned out awesome.

This recipe is easy and delicious and great for casual home cooks bc it substituted Rice wine vinegar for Tamarind sauce (a specialty item most cooks don't have in their pantries).  Tried it last night with Broccoli and sliced  Flank steak and it was relish... My only note is that I used half of a 16-oz package of dried pho noodles, and needed double the amount of sauce to adequately flavor the dish.  Oh and I used 3 eggs instead of 2. 
Otherwise really yummy, easy and taste "authentic" enough to satisfy a Thai food craving from home!

This was ok, not great. I think it's missing something. I read that authentic pad thai uses tamarind, so I'm going to try that next time.

When I first looked at the recipe I too thought that there wasn't nearly enough sauce.   I made it exactly as written...tasted OK but needed more sauce.   Changes I made were I added sliced mushrooms while browning meat, added 1/2 cup of water to pan when I added the noodles which helped to steam everything up hot, and lastly I added KROGER BRAND PAD THAI SAUCE (about 4-5 TBSP) which is actually wonderful and has a peanut flavor among the other spices so I didn't need peanuts.    Must say with those additions it was wonderful and tasted just like my favorite Thai Restaurant. The key is to only add bean sprouts and scallions after plating so that they are nice and crisp

It's exactly what I was looking for. Easy to make and I followed the advice/reviews about tripling the sauce (vinegar/fish sauce/sugar) although I didn't quite triple the sugar. I added peanut butter but used a low fat version. Everyone loved it! This one will be definitely added to our regular dinner list!!

I followed the reviews and tripled the vinegar, fish oil, and doubled the pepper flakes and sugar.  I used rice vinegar instead of white wine because that is what I had on hand.  Because I doubled the pepper it was a little warm for my taste, but if you like heat, like my husband does, it was good.  I also added a tsp of peanut butter and 2 Tbs of soy sauce.  I only added some bean sprouts, but next time will omit them completely as I felt they over powered some of the other flavors.  I also only used 3/4 of the noodles because a whole box was way to much!  I garnished with crushed peanuts, green onion, and lots of lime juice as I love lime!  It was tasty!  Will make again!

We loved it. I made a lot of adjustments per the comments because I am also feeding 2 little ones. Sauteed chicken in Sesame and Veg oil with 3 cloves of garlic pressed (no butter). Tripled with sauce while only 1.5 the sugar. Added sweet pepper sauce, soy and 2 tblsp of natural peanut butter. Added shredded carrots. Cooked less time. I overcooked my noodles to begin with but added them all anyway and chopped them into the mix. Garnished with limes instead. It was a hit for all and made a TON! I was asked to make this "every day"! THANKS!

Made this tonight and it was a big hit! I incorporated many of the popular comment suggestions: tripled sauce (only double sugar), add peanut butter, add Sriracha and red pepper flakes for more spice, added 2 cloves of minced garlic, use lime instead of lemon, soak needles in boiling water for 5 minutes then cold instead of long cold water soak. I also shredded and added 2 cups each of red cabbage and carrots at the end with the bean sprouts. Fantastic! Next time I'll make sure to have cilantro too.

I agree with a previous post that sauteing some garlic and onions takes the flavor to the next level. I also doubled the sauce for the noodle quantity and added some non-sweetened peanut butter to it for extra peanut flavor. If you don't have the white wine vinegar you can substitute apple cider vinegar without altering the overall flavor very much.  A cilantro garnish is also a wonderful finish.

I was really nervous to try this recipe at first. We have a local Thai restaurant that makes fabulous Pad Thai but it's so expensive. Being pregnant I crave it A LOT. My husband and I decided to give the recipe a shot and just see how we did. This is fantastic! Seriously comparable to restaurant quality. We cut the red pepper (not spicy food lovers), added 2Tbs peanut butter, and drizzled with lime juice to give it more of the flavor we're used to. We're both giddy over making something "real" as opposed to a boxed dinner.

Loved it! It goes very quickly if you have everything ready to add before you start cooking. I read several reviews first and doubled the sauce and added mushrooms and sliced celery, omitting the bean sprouts. I'll be fixing this again!

I substituted rice wine winegar for the white wine vinegar as that was all I had; added some broccoli and mushrooms to add some veggies to the dish; and also, while browning the chicken, I added 2 cloves of garlic. Overall, a good recipe but I'd recommend doubling or even tripling the sauce to ensure a good coat of all the noodles + meat.

It was excellent I doubled the sauce and added a teaspoon of minced garlic, 2 julianned carrots, and 1 cup of chopped broccoli because I wasn't able to get bean sprouts. Next time I will triple the sauce and add more vegetables. Will be making this again soon maybe with shrimp!

I doubled the sauce because it was more than a pound of chicken and a bit more noodles.  I will make it again with some changes it needs more color and it seems to be missing something that will make it great.

Came out pretty good. I used only two eggs and added garlic, used less oil and less butter as well.

You can't go wrong with this recipe. I followed the suggestions on most of the reviews. You definitely want to triple the sauce. Cook the noodles according to instruction but only for half the time so it won't get soggy. I used sesame oil to brown the chicken and sauteed some garlic with the chicken. I also added 3 teaspoons peanut butter since I tripled the sauce. This modification made a big difference on the taste. Next time I will use shrimp and beef.

So good! I added a bag of frozen stir fry veggies, about 1/4 cup of peanut butter, and tripled the sauce. Next time I'll probably add a second bag of veggies. Great recipe!

Husband loved this but I also made a few modifications.  I used chicken, a few prawns and some firm tofu in addition to the eggs for protein.  I did S&P the chicken and prawns before cooking to ensure they were flavorful.  The protein mix was delicious but with this additional protein, next time I would reduce the eggs to just 2.  I also doubled the sauce and added about a TBS of Thai Chili Garlic Sauce to it.  Other reviewers are correct there is no heat in this recipe and we do not even like hot food but this needs a bit of pop.  Also I added some shredded cabbage and carrots (Bagged Chinese Chix Salad Mix) to this recipe instead of bean sprouts - delicious!  Next time I will definitely substitute the butter for olive oil w/garlic - love that idea!

Will make again... I doubled the sauce as per some of the reviews and it turned out well. I also added another half tablespoon of sugar to it. Load up on the peanut, lime and green onions! My local market did not have fish sauce, so I had to use what was in my fridge: a tablespoon of each soy sauce and worsty sauce.

It was really great! I just made a few adjustments. 

Additions:
- I added a half of clove of garlic to the chicken (I'd up this to a clove or two) and another half to the recipe. 
- I added sriracha sauce at the end to give it a bit of a kick

Things I would/did change
- I cut back the sugar to about one tablespoon
- I would cut back on the fish sauce- it was too salty
- I would've added more garlic
- I would sub the butter for oil.

Notes:
- I didn't have white wine vinegar so I ended up using red wine vinegar instead. turned out really good either way.

This recipe is a really good starting point for delicious pad thai, as long as you make some changes... I cooked the chicken in oil and a few minced cloves of garlic instead of butter. I also cooked the noodles differently (just follow the instructions on the package, mine only took 8 minutes to cook). I tripled the fish sauce and vinegar, and doubled the sugar. In addition I added 2tbsp sriracha, 2tbsp peanut butter, and the juice from one lime in the sauce. Also didn't garnish with lemon, instead used lime. Some people have mentioned that four eggs is too many, I'll agree that it's a lot of egg, and you could probably use just two instead, but I really like using all four. Also I used a lot more crushed red pepper than the recipe called for, but I like my pad thai spicy. I'll definitely be reusing the modified recipe, it's fast, easy, delicious, and way cheaper than take-out!

This tastes just like the pad thai takeout  I love so much at a fraction of the cost. I triple the sauce ingredients because it doesn't seem to be enough for me, though the ratio is right. My kids had pad thai takeout recently and were disappointed because what I make (using this recipe) is better.

I have never used rice noodles before so I followed the recipe's direction to soak them in COLD water.  After nearly an hour, they were barely soft and they did not get much softer after cooking the dish.  I should have read the package instructions because it said to soak them in HOT water before stir frying.  It was a very tasty dish otherwise and I'll definitely make it again.

I made this once upon a long time ago and it didn't come out quite right. This time, however, I got really close to the taste I was hoping for. I used soy sauce instead of fish sauce (and I think fish sauce would have completed the flavor I wanted), and followed recommendations to triple the sauce. After it all sat for a few minutes when done cooking, it did absorb almost all the sauce, so I am glad I did triple it.  Will definitely make again.

For homemade Thai food this is not bad at all. My husband doesn't like Thai food so I don't get it often. Now I'll just make my own. I subbed mushrooms for bean sprouts because our local grocer does not carry sprouts, but I think it would be better with sprouts. I would make the following changes:
Noodles: Use only 1/2 the package, (or 4 oz), and boil them instead of soaking. They took a long time in the pan to become soft, and some were still undercooked. 
Sauce: good flavor, but needs at least double the amount. 
Additions: added Sweet Chili Sauce to sauce for more kick and flavor. This helped tremendously. 
I will be making this again.

I made this as written, but it was VERY bland. The next time, I sautéed garlic (about 2 cloves minced) in the wok before everything else and doubled the sauce. It still needed a little something, but it was ok with the additions. I'll continue my quest for a really good pad thai recipe.

Although this recipe was easy to follow, the spices and sauce amounts were off. It's a very good base recipe and I will make it again but you definitely need to be creative and add your own seasonings to taste.

I used regular white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, crushed cashews instead of peanuts and extra crushed red peppers. It still turned out great, I would definitely try it again, I think adding a little garlic would really finish the flavor of this dish

Excellent. I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the sauce and only used 8 oz of dried rice sticks. I also added a smidge of chunky peanut butter to the sauce since I didn't have peanuts for garnish. So perfect. I was craving pad Thai and this hit the spot like nothing else. Thanks!!

Has potential...flavorful sauce but way way to little for the amount of noodles. I eveen tripled the sauce because of other reviews and it still fell far short. Next time I'll cut the noodles or 6x the sauce...or find another recipe!..which is probably easier to do

I'm sure I could find a better-tasting recipe for pad Thai, but this one is so easy and quick and was still yummy! I did not have ride noodles so I used Maruchan instant noodles. It worked out well and saved time as well! One of the really crucial flavors this recipe omits is lime. So I added about a tablespoon or more of lime juice to the recipe and it provided just the right amount of that pad Thai flavor everyone loves!

This was simple, tasty, and would work well with whatever meat and veggies you have on hand. The sauce definitely needs to be doubled, and it was a little sweet. Next time I'll cut the sugar in half and add it back in to taste.  Served with hot sauce on the side for mixed preferences at the table.

Best recipe for phat thai! I've added a little thick dark soy sauce for color and fresh cut red chilies when serving.

I've made this twice on my flat top griddle. The first time I substituted fish for soy sauce and doubled the sauce in the recipe and omitted the butter, but followed the rest to a T. The flavor was there but the chicken was bland, it needed more sauce, and I had strained the noodles too long before I added them to the cooking process, so the noodles at the top of the strainer had dried out and became rubbery. 

I made it once again only located fish sauce  at a different store and quadrupled the sauce made in the recipe. I cooked the chicken in a splash of the sauce and strained  the noodles only seconds before throwing them in the mix. This time was much better, though I think I prefer the flavor of the soy over the fish sauce. 

Next time I will revert back to the soy sauce and instead of lemon I will use a lime wedge. Again I'm using a flat top so you may get different results with the method you're using, but I think the third time might be the charm for me. I'd recommend trying this recipe

The result was fairly bland and had too little sauce. Missing the presence of lime, tamarind, galangal, palm sugar and pickled veg. The sweet funk of dried shrimp (whole/chopped/powdered) is sorely missed.

Love this recipe! I added shrimp with the chicken, hoisin sauce 1/3c, soy sauce 1/3c, 2 TBS vinegar, only 1 TBS fish sauce and sautéed yellow onion instead of green onions. Delicious!!!

Love it! Tripled the sauce and added the peanut butter as suggested. Sometimes I use tofu, sometimes shrimp, but my kids and I always love it and they request that I make it.

Made this last weekend and it was great. Not so heavy. I would double the sauce next time. Used one full box of noodles. I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar.

I tripled the sauce ingredients and it was amazing.  I won't be paying for pad Thai again! It also gave me the opportunity to make it mild for my boys. I added Siracha for myself. Oh I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used red. I cannot wait for leftovers tomorrow. Made a ton!

Glad I read all the reviews. I quadrupled the sauce recipe and it wasn't enough and I didn't use all the noodles. I also had bought a jar of hot chili paste sauce in the Asian food section, used that instead of dried chili peppers. I also added 2 Tbs peanut butter to the sauce. I thought it was quite good, spicy with the paste. I added fresh mushrooms and will add pea pods next time. I forgot to add the eggs! I am going to make another double batch of sauce to pour over the leftovers. My husband was quite impressed.

Pad Thai is so versatile and I only rated this to my taste from my experience of Pad Thai.  I do LOVE the lightness of this, but the Pad Thai I have tried is hotter and has more of a peanut sauce taste.  To do this you can add peanut butter and sriracha to taste.  Maybe that is only because all the Pad Thai I have had has a lot more peanut buttery taste, but both are good.  I don't always want the richness.

I made this recipe for lunch today, and it was a huge hit with the whole family.  The kids went back for seconds (and thirds!).  I read the reviews beforehand and decided to double the sauce, as some reviewers suggested.  I was glad I did, because it was the perfect amount once doubled.  I also added a little extra sugar to the sauce as a matter of preference.  I'll definitely be making this again.

We liked this very much and have made it twice in the last week.  First time I followed the recipe perfectly - second time made some adjustments.

I cooked the noodles per the package (boil water, turn off then add noodles for 8-10 min to soften). Perfect.

I tripled the vinegar and fish sauce, and doubled the sugar.  I also added 3 heaping spoonfuls of peanut butter and one spoonful of chili sauce to the sauce mixture.  This made a world of difference with flavor and keeping the dish moist!

Definitely a keeper - and will make it many more times - thanks for sharing!

**This pad thai recipe is way off**  We salvaged our ruined dish by adding a ton of Hawaiian BBQ sauce at the end because we didn't want to throw away the food! Our noodles were so hard & eggs way over cooked.  >:-/   We suffered through & ate it anyway.  I was so ticked off.  
We tried the dish again & made the following corrections:
First, you gotta soak your noodles in HOT water to get them softened. Second, you gotta fry your noodles in the pan first before the eggs, otherwise the eggs are completely over cooked by the time you are done. Third, do "something" with your chicken the way YOU like it (spicy/sweet/whatever) otherwise you get plain, buttered, browned chicken meat... we added Sambal Oelek to ours as it browned - Mmm - Amazing!

I followed some of the tips from other users and used 3/4 tsp peanut butter for the sauce and I doubled the sauce. I also used lime instead of lemon and sauted my chicken in garlic. The dish tasted fantastic but just a little on the dry side. My friends gobbled this up though. I'm definitely making this again instead of ordering out.

This is a good base recipe that can be adapted to suit your tastes. I used shrimp and added sliced red peppers instead of bean sprouts and grated carrots. I doubled the sauce and added a bit of peanut butter to it.

I had to triple the sauce. The noodles took much longer to cook than expected, and the ratio of noodles to other ingredients seemed high. Everyone seemd to like it but I don't think I'll make again.

I LOVED this so much. The only thing I changed was added lime juice to the sauce and I added extra hot peppers cause i love heat. Also, I added about 2-3 tablespoons of peanut butter to the sauce. It tasted very authentic!

I only made the following changes: I used apple cider vinegar. And I tripled the sauce:  Vinegar, fish sauce, sugar. And I added garlic to the chicken. And used limes instead. It was actually really good. Reminiscent of my favorite restaurant's version...not as good as theres but I can't fly to Hawaii once a month. This is just as good as any other restaurants version I've had since living in Hawaii. Pretty inexpensive to get the necessities to make this meal for 6.

This was a pretty bland and dry pad thai.  Next time, I will double the fish sauce, add some peanut butter, reduce the sugar (it was too much even without the peanut butter), add some spice to it (it was very bland).  I will also add some veggies.  Overall, the bones of the recipe are here, but you need to make a lot of adjustments.

This isn't a terrible recipe, but it's really plain. This is the first time i've ever tried to cook pad thai and I was quite disappointed. There is something that at is missing from it, I suggest looking for another recipe.

This was excellent!  It tasted almost as good as our favorite thai restaurant.  I followed the advice of other reviewers. I tripled the sauce (triple the vinegar, using rice wine though, triple the fish sauce, only 4 TBSP of sugar though).  I also added about 2 TBSP of creamy peanut butter.  OMG!  It was delicious.  Finally, I about tripled the red pepper flakes because we love spice.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic when I sauted the chicken.

I wish I had read (or re-read) some of the reviews before making this because the sauce needed to be tripled (at least).  When I saw the amount of noodles vs. the amount of sauce I was like, "uh oh...either I did something wrong or there was a typo or something".  I managed to double it in time so nothing was ruined.  I adjusted the amount of red pepper since we like ours a little hot.  Overall it had a really good flavor.  I marked my printed recipe to triple the sauce ingredients so next time I make it I'll remember, but as written I can only give it 3 stars. :(

This is a good base recipe for Pad Thai. I added soy sauce to taste, 1-2 tsp. of mirin sauce, a tbsp. of extra fish sauce, and half of a yellow onion and 2-3 tbsp. of minced garlic while cooking the chicken. I also replaced the peanuts with a tsp. of sesame seed oil (I always get a strange sensation that I'm eating peanut butter if there are peanuts in a dish). It tasted very close to what I get at the local Thai restaurant. I also suggest adding only 1 cup of bean sprouts rather than two since it really changed the flavor after I did that.

This was my first time cooking pad thai. This is a great basic recipe!  I eliminated the fish oil and white wine vinegar and cooked everything in coconut milk with some cilantro and sugar. I added shrimp, green peppers, pineapple, garlic, lime, and cucumbers along with the other ingredients listed in the recipe. Complete success! Will definitely make again!

I've never made Pad Thai before. This was an easy and very good recipe. Like another reviewer said Pad Thai is like making chili or soup. You can make all kinds of changes. I will switch up my veggies and meat each time I make this dish. Thanks for posting!

I was so happy with the results of this recipe! I added about a teaspoon of garlic, as other commenters suggested, and increased the amount of red pepper to 1/4 teaspoon (will use a little more of both next time), but those were the only alterations I made. I was hoping for leftovers but there were none! This recipe was so easy to make, it will definitely become part of my standard rotation.

As 'Mommy'slearningtocook' said The color is not as expected but the taste is close. I would give it a 4 stars on taste, but it is sooo easy to make. The ingredients that are dropped out makes it possible to make it with pantry staples ( leaving out the bean sprouts).

This is going I'm my recipe box!!!

As written, I would give the recipe 4 stars.  As others wrote, it needed more sauce, but the basic flavor was great.  I used a 16 oz. package of noodles, soaked them in hot tap water for about 10 minutes and drained.  I ended up quadrupling the recipe for the sauce, though I only doubled the red pepper flakes. The store was out of fresh bean sprouts so I used canned, but would use fresh next time. I served ours without the green onions because we don't like them, and used lime wedges for garnish and flavor instead of lemon.  We really liked this and would make it again.

Well I didn't like but not through fault of the recipe, I think I bought the wrong noodles and messed everything up from there. I will probably not attempt it again, the taste however was spot on, the consistency looked odd unfortunately...

I was really skeptical about the fish sauce, because it smelled so funny in the bottle. But holy cow when you cook it it smells amazing. This dish is so delicious i dont want to finish it because then it would be all gone.

The instructions didn't state where/when to cut the onions.  1 tsb of sugar is MORE than enough otherwise it would be sweet/sugary.  It was very mushy and dry.

I added garlic and doubled the sauce but this was super tasty and very close to my local Thai place's version. My picky eater husband is taking leftovers to work. For my kids (7 years & 9 months) I left off the peanuts and didn't give the baby any sprouts but they both liked it too. All together an easy and tasty recipe.

Family approved and we eat a lot of thai food! Tripled the sauce but I was cooking for 7 people.  Overall flavor was there, add your favorite items to authenticate or Americanize this dish.  Yummy!

It really needs some color, so I added thinly sliced red pepper, also omitted the butter & used sesame oil. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar & lime instead of lemon. This recipe is pretty basic, but that's good, just add what you like.

Your definitely going to need more white wine vinegar and fish sauce. I tried recipe as is and the sauce was not enough to coat the noodles. I had to use slightly more than double than what the recipe calls for. I would also suggest to mix the vinegar, fish sauce, and sugar together then sparingly use it over the noodles while their cooking.

this was awesome, sauce tastes great! This tastes like restaurant pad thai. I added some sweet red chili paste and half a tablespoon of soy sauce. Also I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the amount of sauce.

I'd just like to get an opinion. Would it taste better/more authentic if I used a bit of tamarind as well as doubling the sauce?

Solid pad thai recipe, tough to please all audiences, but a highly recommend this as a good base.  This one is easy to make for many, the prep time is misleading as it's just soaking noodles.  Add in your own stylings to it to get your own 5 star dish.

My review is based on the fact that I whipped this up in about 15 minutes with spare ingredients lying around my kitchen (which means I substituted almost everything except the sauce) and it STILL tasted good.

Substitutions I made:
- sweet-potato starch noodles (jjap chae noodles) for the rice ones
- lemon juice from concentrate (the ones that come in those little plastic yellow bottles from the grocery store) for lemon/lime wedges
- sliced almonds for crushed peanuts
- olive oil for butter
- 2 eggs instead of 4

I also omitted the beansprouts, cilantro, green onions, and tofu, because I didn't have any of them...although I bet it would have tasted a million times better with them. 

And lastly, I added in chili paste, crushed red pepper and toasted sesame seeds for taste/texture. :)

I was a little apprehensive about adding 3 tablespoons of sugar, but that definitely did the trick. Next time, I might try out honey as a susbstitute, and I'll probably toss in some grilled onions and maybe even some shredded coconut (I have really weird tastes, though, so you probably don't want to try that).


Anyway, good basic recipe. Despite what everyone else said, I thought the sauce was just right for a one-person serving of noodles, and the flavor was authentic (not to mention, it was really easy to make!). I'm looking forward to trying this again with better ingredients.

I edited the recipe based on previous reviewers recommendations. I was a bit skeptical when I first tasted the sauce I thought that there was too much fish sauce; however, after adding it to the pasta, it turned out to be delicious although a bit sweet.

I'm sorry, but I don't think this taste like Pad Thai at all. I followed the directions exactly and while I don't think this tastes really bad, I don't think that this is anything like Pad Thai.

This is a very good, flavorful base for pad thai, but I found that I had to alter the measurements of fish sauce and white wine vinegar according to taste. I also added more lemon. I would definitely suggest adding vegetables such as string carrots, onions, and peapods.

I LOVE pad thai and this was my first attempt at making it at home.  I thought it was excellent!  I used shrimp because that's what I had on hand  I didn't saute them but added them when I added the noodles because they only take a minute to cook.  I doubled the sauce and added about 1 1/2 tablespoon chili garlic sauce because I like a little kick with my sweetness.  I also added cilantro in with the noodles and served with lime wedges.  Excellent!!

I did not care for this recipe. There was nothing standing between the fish sauce and the entree.  Apparently I don't like fish sauce.  Maybe my fish sauce was bad but either way, I will never make this again.

Absolutely Fantastic Recipe - and easy to alter to your own tastes (ie more peanut or more spice).  My husband is one of those strange men that doesnt eat alot - but when I make this he eats until his pants are bursting open!!  Thanks so much Transmonicon!!

Very good. I substitued veg. oil for the butter and doubled the vinegar, fish sauce, vinegar.....and loaded on the pepper for some heat!  I didn't garnish with the peanuts, onions, or lemon and it was still delicious!

I made this with shrimp rather than chicken, I thought it was really good. I used rice vinegar, a little soy sauce, fish sauce and lime juice to make the sauce. I will definitely make this again.

I also substituted PEANUT OIL for the vegetable oil.  I think that makes a huge difference.  The recipe instructions don't tell you when to add the green pepper or lemon (strange).  I added them both towards the end.  I used shrimp and chicken, but I think you could add any meat you preferred.

Dry and Bland.  I doubled the sauce and it was still pretty dry (I even only used an 8 oz package of noodles).  I may try this again with triple the sauce.   I used lime instead of lemon and I cooked the chicken in peanut oil with garlic.  I doubled the red pepper and added chili sauce.  My two-year-old liked it.

I revised this recipe based on the review by Jodi on January 30, 2007 and it came out very good.  Next time I will use only about 7 ounces of noodles and add more bean sprouts to help the sauce stand out a little more.  Definitely a "do again"!  Very close to the Pad Thai I had in Thailand.  Thanks for the recipe and thank you Jodi for your review.

We were so dissappointed with this. It smells like feet, is too greasy, no flavor, and the recipe calls for peanuts, but doesn't have anything about them in the directions. My boyfriend, who will generally eat anything was so grossed out that he is now making Kraft mac and cheese! I wish I could give this 0 stars  or negative stars!

This was my very first attempt at pad thai, EVER.  So considering that, I thought it went pretty well.  I tripled the sauce like some other reviewers suggested.  I used hoison sauce instead of fish sauce only because that's what I had in the pantry.  It tasted good to me, but then again I'm not sure what fish sauce tastes like so maybe that would be better. I also added a tbsp of peanut butter which I thought added a little depth to the flavers. I skimped on the white sugar too. I used shrimp instead of chicken and threw in 3 cloves of finely chopped garlic.  I would definitely make this again.

I have never had pad thai before, but this was definitely a great recipe to start with and alter for your own preferences. At first it was a little nerving to see it kind of look like a big pile of mess, but I was surprised by the flavor. I forgot the sugar and I didn't use fish sauce (because I personally don't like fish sauce).  Next time I will boil/cold rinse my noodles, double sauce, and spice my chicken up a little more when I cook it. Other than that, me and my boyfriend thought this was a great recipe! Will make this again and again!

Really enjoyed this.  I followed directions exactly and agree with many reviewers that there could have been more sauce.  I would increase that next time....and I would do what someone else suggested in seasoning the chicken and adding a bit of soya sauce, to give it some colour.  It was very good but esthetically, needed some colour.

This is a good recipe. We've made this several times and have adjusted it to get it just right. My family loves Pad Thai, here are the changes we made: Omit butter, used deli rotisserie chicken, saves time and adds flavor.  Add peeled and sauteed shrimp. 2 Eggs is plenty for this portion, used 1 less tablespoon of sugar and added 1 1/2 TB of peanut butter.  SO GOOD! Thanks for the recipe

Thanks for the great recipe.  I love Pad Thai and it's great to be able to make it at home.  I add what ever veggies I have on hand, carrots & beets (funny color and tastes great as well).  I also love peanut sauce on my pad thai, so I just put a big dollop - I'm guessing it's about 1/4 cup in when I add the sauce, which I doubled but only using 3 TB sugar.

Not like any Pad Thai I have ever purchased from a restaurant. Followed other reviews suggestion to triple sauce, added 4 teaspoon PB, little soy sauce, lime juice... cooked chicken with veg. oil/sesame oil and minced garlic. I did reduce the eggs to one, as I hate them. The dish was bland with a lot of heat from the red pepper. I will not be making this again, the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because as it cooled, it tasted less bland.

I felt the recipe made the taste very bland.  This may be related to the comment about the noodles absorbing.  Also the chicken needs to be seasoned a bit.  I added garlic and shrimp to the recipe.  Odd that the recipe asked for 4 eggs as most I have come across are content with only 2.  This may be for the lack of shrimp in the recipe.  I as well would exclude the butter for the chicken.  As well, more sauce is needed in this recipe.  Overall a disappoint.

Just finished this dish...liked it very much, definitely agree with multiplying the sauce. I don't think I soaked my noodles for a long enough time out of fear that they'd be mushy as reported by other reviewers. Will try this again to improve my method!! Thanks very much!!!!

Definitely triple the sauce!!! I also marinated some stir-fry steak in a store-bought Asian marinade and added it on top afterwards. I also added saracha sauce, garlic, peanut butter and used limes.

This is very close to what you may get at a Thai restaurant and quick to make. I made it with beef grill on the Foreman, and used rice vinegar and lime instead. Also doubled the rice vinegar and fish sauce.

This turned out wonderfully! I was a little skeptical at first when I made the sauce. I have never made Pad Thai before but the sauce just didn't seem right. I also doubled it as suggested and added a lot more crushed red pepper. I don't think the recipe calls for enough. I also added garlic. I used tofu and shrimp. Delicious!

Good starting recipe. I made this to a T and it came out great. I had some leftover rice noodles from last night when making the "Dad's Pad Thai" version. This one is better. Does not use ketchup! I dont think pad thai is supposed to even have ketchup. Anyways I followed it exactly, except added minced garlic to the oil and shreded carrots along with the green onions. I also used lime instead of lemon. I was very satisfied. It was more of a restaurant taste then last nights. I will be sticking with this recipe from now on. I have posted a picture as well.

I love Pad Thai but more the North American take out version. So here is my version from how it differs from the one above.   I use peanut oil and no butter and add garlic to my chicken.   For my sauce I use: -3 tp rice vinegar -4-5 tp fish sauce -8 tp sugar -half a lime grated  -2 tp crushed red peppers -4-6tp of szechwan / peanut sauce (off the self)  It is much better the next day and makes everyone in the office jealous. I'm a single so I freeze 2 servings and its great on a lazy night down the road.

This is a good pad thai recipe that was made great with the addition of a peanut sauce topping.

This recipe is alright. If you are not really used to eating pad thai, this will suffice. I found with using the ingredients in the recipe, the sauce was a bit too sweet, and was lacking some "asian" flavor. I followed one of the reviews and sauteed with garlic and onions first before adding the egg.  I also added more fish sauce, lime juice, red chili pepper sauce and soy sauce to the sauce. In the end, I garnished with 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro, peanuts and green onion.

this recipe was terrible.  My boyfriend loves Pad Thai so I tried to make it for him last night.  I omitted chicken and butter since I am a vegetarian, but it was so bland and dry!  Will not try this recipe again.

I tried making pad thai for the first time yesterday using this recipe and my husband loved it! I have to make more today because there weren't any leftovers for him to take  for lunch. I did make a few changes, but with anything people have their own preferences. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a good recipe but it was not up to my expectations.   It came up short of what I enjoy in restaurants.   It seems to take forever to get the rice noodles soft enough.   I gave up to early and accepted them when they were not quite soft enough.

I'm not generally a "pad thai" kind of person, but I really like this!  I added lime, definitly wouldn't add any more fish sauce, and used chili oil instead of crushed pepper.  I also added shredded carrots for color.  Truthfully, at first the smell was revolting (and I'm pregnant), but the sauce blended w/the noodles very nicely and calmed it down.  Yum!

Pretty good, it's easier to just get the pad thai pre-package sauce from the ethnic foods section of the grocery store and add the veggies, chicken and peanuts.

This recipe didn't taste anything at all like the pad thai I've had at restaurants.  There was way too much sugar.  I only used 1/3 of what the recipe called for, and it was still overbearing.  I will not make this recipe again.

I marinated my chicken in soy sauce and honey before cooking it.  I also replaced the bean sprouts with carrots, added mushrooms, and doubled the sauce.  This was absolutely delicious!  It needed a bit too much alteration to get five stars though.

This was great.  Before I messed with the sauce, I tasted it and I liked it a lot.  Then I added a little peanut butter because I didn't have many peanuts.  That was a mistake - it was great the way it was.  Did have to double it, though.

This was very good. I added a little more red pepper as we like a little more heat. My husband asked me to put it in the recipe box so I'd consider it a hit.

I was disappointed with this recipe - I thought it was rather bland as written.  I will make it again with some adjustments like marinating the chicken before cooking it to add some flavor and maybe using sesame or peanut oil.  I also added shredded carrots and doubled the sauce.  Still doesn't taste like the Pad Thai at my fav Thai restaurant though.

Delic!  It was my first attempt at pad thai and it turned out well.  I didn't have peanuts so I just threw in a 1/4 cup peanut butter, which made it a little dry.  My own fault for experimenting, but it was still yummy!

This recipe was not great. I used 12 ounces of dried noodles but it made WAY too many. I even doubled the recipe but there was not enough flavor. At the last minute I added some more fish sauce, lime juice, and peanut butter. It wasn't great. I won't make again. Even my husband who will eat almost anything thought it was boring.

I made this with chicken which I had marinated in a left over soy and chili dipping sauce.  I also did not have any bean sprouts so instead I use finally sliced celery and carrot.  The flavours were excellent!  No need to search for another pad thai recipe!

Good Pad Thai.  I more than doubled the sauce.  Make sure your wok is good and large or else you will make a mess and have a difficult time mixing the noodles in.  It is less greasy that what you usually get in Thai restaraunts.  This is good or bad depending on your tastes.

i also doubled the sauce, and used some seasame oil instead of vegetable ... followed many of the other suggestions here. i enjoy more the sukhothai pad thai recipe from this site. i'll stick to that one instead, even though this wasn't a bad recipe.

I would double the sauce and follow the others with the lime and less pepper. It was great.

Personally, I found that it didn't taste much like Pad Thai at all.  I saw other recipes adding ketchup to the mix, and once I did this, it got its normal reddish color and finally had the similar Pad Thai flavor.  Not very close to restaurant taste, but good enough to eat.

This recipe is fantastic! It's easy, delicious! I'm a Pad Thai lover and the nearest Thai restaurant to me is about 30 min away, and the only way to get to eat there is making a reservation. Well... Thanks to this amazing recipe I not only can make it any time but I'm showing off big time to my husband and friends that I'm capable to cook Asian!

I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce and added 1T peanut butter, and this was a fabulous dish!

My husband loved this dish but I thought it was so-so - not good enough for the amount of work required.  I doubled the sauce and even used less red pepper then called for one recipe and still found it almost too spicy.

To be fair, I have never had Pad Thai before so I have nothing to compare this dish too.  I did not like it at all.  I think the worst part was the fish sauce which, even after only using half the amount, I found to be overwhelming.  However, the other three people eating this said tat they could not taste it and said that it was just an all right dish.  Of course, everyone added something to their plate to make it better (more soy sauce and some teryaki sauce).

Good recipe... I took other people's advice and doubled the fish sauce, vinegar, and sugar.  Changed from rice noodles to vermecelli noodles.  It tastes pretty close to what you get at the restaurant.

I enjoyed this recipe, but the sauce definitely needed to be doubled...or even trippled in my case because I used a larger package of noodles.

This doesn't taste like the pad thai I have in Thai restaurants at all.  It's not bad, just not what I expected.  The rice noodles also stick together really bad.

This was absolutely the best pad thai that I have ever made...my fiancee told me it was just like going out for Thai.  Minor substitutions:  I reduced a small part of the vegetable oil and added sesame oil.  I reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons.  I omitted the bean sprouts.  I added ketchup at the end to give it some colour.  Finally, lots of cilantro to top it off.  Absolutely delicious, thank you for the recipe!

This tasted pretty good, especially after I added some sriracha hot sauce to it.  I like pad thai, but I don't imagine I'll be making this all that often.  It was quick to make, but also kind of a hassle.

Fantastic dish!  We eat this all the time.  It is quite easy to make, too.  Even my 2 year old loves it and that's high praise.

I absolutely love this recipe, and have made it about 10 times so far. I end up adding things to it depending upon how I feel: tofu, soy sauce, pepper, etc.  It's easy and delicious, and not nearly as oily as restaurant versions of this dish.

I've had better recipes.  I only put in 1 Tb of pepper. It was plenty spicy for my family.  If you're looking for a pad thai you would get at a restaurant. Look somewhere else.  There isn't enough of the sauce to color or flavor the noodles with that great flavor you look for.  It tasted good but I think it should be, "Pad-Thai inspired noodles".

This is wonderful!  I used chicken and 8 ounces of rice noodles, and it worked great!  I used the full amount of spice, and it was HOT and wonderful.  I wouldn't recommend it for small children or people who do not like spicy food.  Enjoy!
