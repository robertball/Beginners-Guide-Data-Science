Wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it.  Thank you for sharing.  Regarding the question of Lima & Butter Beans:  There are other names for just about everything in the food world, and in this case, butter beans is the other name for lima beans. There are two common varieties of lima bean — the baby lima bean and the Fordhook — but don't confuse them as the same bean in different stages of development. The Fordhook is larger, lighter in color, and has a stronger taste than the baby lima, but it is not a grown-up baby — it is a separate variety. 

In the south of the United States, Fordhook lima beans are commonly called butter beans. Many southerners wouldn't recognize the name lima bean.

hi- i make a similar soup- and my good friends Linda and Martin love it. Only real difference is I add 1/4 to 1/3 lb. broken spaghetti or small pasta like elbows, cooked, at the  very end. MKartin requests this a lot.

Overall, this is a good recipe. If you're a fan of lima beans, you can't help but like this soup! I didn't have marjoram, so I substituted poultry seasoning which seemed to work well. I also used 6 strips of bacon rather than 3 and I added some chopped ham as well. Served it to a friend who said she didn't think she liked lima beans before, but she loved them cooked this way! I am ALWAYS looking for new soup recipes and now this one's added to my archives. Thanks!

Sweet Lord I am in heaven.  What a wonderful soup and my buddy for the football games is a soup hound.  We had three bowls each and sat like toads holding our stomachs in the recliners.  The only thing I did different was cook up the whole pound of bacon, crumbled it and dropped it in.  Two days later and it was still just as awesome for leftovers.

I loved this recipe.  It is soooo good and filling.  I did smash some of the vegetables once the soup was done to give it a little thicker consistency.  By the way, sometimes lima beans are confused with butter beans; you need to specify green lima beens.  Butter beans are always the big dried ones.

This was fantastic.  We love lima beans so we loved this and it smelled so good while it was cooking!  Will make this many times in the Winter months.  :)
To the reviewer below...
I have lived in Virginia all my life and Butter Beans ARE NOT the same as Lima Beans.  Two totally different beans.

In my husband's words: "For lima beans, this is an excellent meal!".  My 4 year old loved it, and my husband thought it was delicious.  The house even smelled good making it! It was easy to make, and full of veggies that my child normally wouldn't touch. So I will definitely be making this one again, and it really hit's the spot on a cold winters day.

Very good basic recipe.  I always have to "tweak" a recipe to suit my taste, though.  Just my nature.  First of all I made it stove top about 2 hours or so.  Ok, but I added about 1 cup cubed ham (from a trimmed ham steak), 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. more marjoram and 1/2 tsp. dried sage leaves.  We love limas so I also added another 16oz. pkg., I cooked separately, took about 1/2 cooked amount and added 1 cup broth from soup pot and pureed in a blender.  Added this to soup along with other 1/2 of whole cooked beans. Cooked another ten min. or so.  It thickened it just perfectly.  I also used Free Range organic chicken broth. There's just 2 of us so I have 3 containers for the freezer.  Delish!

First time I made it exactly as written and it was pretty good. Second time I made it, I blended it a little at the end with an immersion blender. Not too much--I left most of it intact, but just thickened it up a little.  Oh, and I used a pound of cubed ham (prepackaged) instead of bacon and I really liked it. I like my soups chunky.

I liked this soup a lot - I've tried it with bacon and with ham - it's equally good both ways.  I will put it in my soup rotation.  And, the best thing about it - it's easy!     (I didn't feel that 3 slices of bacon was really enough when I followed the directions the first time - perhaps more would have made it a 5 star recipe)

This soup is amazing.  I did not put the potatoes in.  I used all baby limas no butter beans.  I put a ham bone in the slow cooker.  The broth was so good.  It was a little salty most likely because I didn't use the potatoes.  Really, really good, I will make this often.

Very delicious.  I substituted 1 pound of dry lima beans soaked over night then rinsed.  Added 1 clove of fresh garlic and 2 ham shanks.  Wonderful with homemade cornbread after a day of gardening in the brisk early Spring air.

Uh.... like...YUM?!! I was not expecting this to be nearly as good as it is! (sorry for doubting!) I used turkey bacon, so I didn't pre-cook it. Might add one less can of chicken broth next time so it'll be thicker. But the broth itself is wonderful! I never knew lima bean soup could be so delish! Thanks!

This was pretty tasty! I like my soup a little less brothy, so in the future I might puree a bit of it to make it feel thicker. I also added a touch of garlic to it as well. Cured my craving for lima bean soup!

Really good!  Used a bag of baby lima beans and Fordhook limas (bigger) and some diced ham.  Yummy for a cold winter's day!

This was a great starting point that ended up being a fantastic soup! I used dried beans instead of frozen and Taylor Ham in lieu of the bacon as that was all I had in the house. I skipped the butter and just tossed all of the vegetables including spinach and green beans right into the pot. Homemade turkey stock took the place of the canned broth. Once the beans were just about tender, I scooped about half of them out and pureed them in the food processor to make a thicker soup. Needless to say, garlic and onion powders also seasoned the soup as well as savory and dried parsley. A one pot, perfectly healthy meal that this Jersey girl and her  Kentucky sweetie really enjoyed.  Thanks so much NJSnowbird.

We used about 6 or 7  slices of bacon, but otherwise followed this exactly and it was a big hit.  The first nite it was good, but as leftovers on the second day it was totally AWESOME.  Everyone loved it especially on a cold midwest autumn nite.

Great basic recipe to add personal choice ingredients. Couldn't fit all of it in my crockpot (6 Qt.) so had to use stove top instead on low. May add ham next go round. Thanks for sharing the recipe. FW

This soup is very hearty and delicious! It's definitely a "winter soup."  I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for a great recipe.  There are many super slow cooker recipes on this site :-)

This soup was ok, but we found it to be a bit dry and bland.  It was ok to try once, but we won't be making it again.

My family loved this soup.  My husband have to have meat with every meal, so I put skinless/boneless chicken thighs in it.  It was great along with some good old fashion cornbread.

This recipes is delicous.  I realized my crockpot was too small once I got into the recipe.  So I used the same amount of ingredents because I love all the veggies except only added 2 cans of chicken broth.  All I can say is yummy!!!

Very good - I make a similar version. Smoked pork hocks or shanks. After a few hours, trim the fat (discard) and dice the meat and re-add it back into the soup.  I only use corriander (a pinch or so) and pepper for spices. No bacon, potatoes, celery or butter needed.

Not near as much flavor as I was hoping even though I added more herbs. We eat a lot of soups in my family and this one was a bit disappointing.

This recipe was delicious!  Everybody in the family loved it, even my daughter who doesn't like lima beans.  I didn't have bacon, so I cut a small ham steak into small cubes, and browned them first.  I put one clove of garlic in, based on other reader reviews.  Also, I cooked it in a pot on the stove top, because I started in the afternoon.  It was ready in 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  I'm surprised that some people found it lacking in flavor.  The flavors of the vegetables, meat and seasonings really came out after cooking a while.  Really good.

Great soup!  I used a can of Great Northern beans as I didn't know what butter beans were (an internet search said they're limas but I'm not sure).  When I mentioned possibly leaving them out next time, my boyfriend's dad insisted that they be left in so I guess I have to! Also, no bacon and summer savory because I forgot I was out of marjoram.  My 4 1/2 quart crock pot ended up being too small so I had to freeze about 2 1/2 cups of the veggie mix for next time.  I made this for my boyfriend's mom who loves lima bean soup and everyone ate it, even people who don't like lima bean soup!  It cooked for 12 hours, about 3 of which were on high and was fine after all that time.  The flavor was even better the next day.  Thanks for an easy and healthy recipe!

I love lima beans, but think this is pretty bland.  I went much heavier on the salt and added garlic, but it still just tastes like a pot of beans.  I'm also not crazy about how thin the broth is. I prefer a thicker soup.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it is very good and flavorful. I enjoyed it very much but hubby would not eat it because he didn't like the texture of the lima beans. He loves lima beans but claimed these were too soft. That, however was the reason I liked it so much as I don't like the consistency of lima beans when served as a side veggie. The marjoram was very nice and is a spice I don't use very often so I was happy to taste it in this soup. When I make it again it will be for me for lunches. A nice, healthy soup-thank you!

Omg! This was shockingly delicious. My 7 and 2 year old gladly ate it which is a miracle. I didnt have bacon but i had some leftover chicken slices in the fridge so i chopped those up and threw them in. I love this soup so much.

I wasn't sure about this soup but it is fantastic. The only thing I changed was the potatoes. I used sweet potatoes because that was all I had. I followed everything else to a T. My husband LOVED it.  I was short on time so I cooked it on the stove instead. I will be making this again!

We used canned lima beans and it turned out too salty.  I wasn't very impressed but it may be better if you use frozen lima beans.

Loved this recipe.  Next time I will add a little more broth, we like lots of broth in soup.  Used the bacon that you buy precooked, it worked just fine.  Will definately make again
