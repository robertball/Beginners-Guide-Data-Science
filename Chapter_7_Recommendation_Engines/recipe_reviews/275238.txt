First off I have to say that the marinade is aboslutely delicious! I was eating it with a spoon before putting it on the chicken. It makes a really unique of "almost" BBQ sauce.  I marinated my chicken for about 8 hours then had hubby grill it. It started burning at first, but he had the grill too hot. My 3 year old son kept asking for more on his plate. I might make a double or triple batch of sauce next time and freeze the extra so ill always have it on hand. I'm going to make this again soon for our end-of-summer grill out.

Very bland... not enough chile (or other spices). Family did not like this at all.

I really like the way it turned out. Make sure you save some sauce because it adds a lot more flavor for dipping
