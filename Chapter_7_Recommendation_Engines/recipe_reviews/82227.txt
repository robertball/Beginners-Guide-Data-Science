Five stars - for successful originality, if nothing else! What a weird combination, but it works well. I made these several weeks ago, and my husband was extremely skeptical. However, after trying them, he asked me to make them again. They may not be a "crave" food, but they are a great taste-buds adventure. I will be making them many times in the future. 
Note: I always do my yams in the microwave, as I seem to always be running short on time. Two yams, 6-8 minutes on each side should do it (instead of 40min-1hr in the oven). Don't forget to poke holes in the yams first, though!
Thanks for a great recipe!

I was surprised by this combination, but I like avocados and I like yams, so I thought I'd try it.  It was truly wonderful!  I loved every mouthful, and ate the leftovers for several days.  I plan on making again and again.  I'm even considering making a two layer dip (yams and guacamole) for our next party.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I've never liked yams so I've never bothered to cook them.  Recently I had my boyfriend over for dinner and he happens to love yams.  I found this recipe and after reading the reviews thought, I'll try it!  After talking to some people who love yams, I was having some reservations with the combination of ingredients.  I made this and decided to just cut one potato in half first and we'd try it.  It was absolutely the most delicious potato I have eaten in my life!!!  WOW!  We're having the leftovers tonight!  My boyfriend was very impressed and he now calls them "Yam Jammers".  The only thing is, I made two Yams and it took double the time to cook..but I think the secret is to put the Yams directly on the rack of the oven and a cookie sheet underneath to catch the drippings.  Thank you so much for an awesome recipe!!

This was good--nice flavor and great texture. I made it without the cheese. The lime was too much for me, though. Next time, I'll reduce or omit it. I'll also omit the olive oil (avocado is creamy enough by itself) and add some garlic and a dash of cayenne. The possibilities for this recipe are endless. I'd like to make an Asian version: red pepper, cilantro, soy sauce, and ginger--yum!

This recipe was fantastic.  I have food sensitivities and this was a great hypoallergenic/gluten free IBS friendly recipe.  I read all of the reviews and only used a splash of lemon juice, I added fresh garlic and omitted the cheese and the red pepper.  I will definitely be making this again!

In an attempt to incorporate avocados into my diet, I tried this.  It sounds wierd, so I was skeptical.  It was great!  Made it without cilantro (forgot to buy it), and it tasted great.  Wow!

sounds interesting. I was looking for a recipe with sweet potatoes and avocado (both are good for your skin) this will be super easy, especially if I use my regular guacamoli recipe (easier) or a store bought one. I only gave 4 star because I haven't done it yet, sorry, I usually hate it when people do that.

Mixed reaction here.  Yes, the combination is odd, but that's not the reason to slam the recipe.  Creativity is important in cooking.  We just found the flavours didn't mix that well.  We essentially filled the potatoes with our 5 star guac.  The wife liked it fine but the hubby was less than impressed.  The savoury and garlicky flavour of the guac just doesn't compliment the sweetness of the potatoes that well.  I guess we're used to a more sweet pairing than this.  Full points for originality though.

Love this!  I love sweet potato and I love avocado, and I LOVE them together, it turns out!  While the sweet potato is baking, chill the avocado mixture in the fridge.  The juxtaposition of hot sweet potato vs. cold avocado, and their warm and sweet vs. tangy and sour flavors are out of this world!!  Will definitely make this again!

Pretty good, I love avocados and yams so you cant really go wrong. I added 1/4 cup of sour cream and 1/2 tsp of both chilli powder and ground cardamon and added the cheese before the filling to give it a chance to melt. Delicious!

On reading this recipe, I thought "Oh, how icky!" but it sounded so intriguing I had to try it, so I scaled it down to 1 (as I knew hubby wouldn't even try it) and plunged in!  (I left out the cumin and cilantro, which my unsophisticated tastebuds can't handle, and omitted the cheese by choice, but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.)  Like most of the other reviewers, I was amazed and hooked.  Hubby asked what I was saying "I can't believe this actually works.  It's weird, but it works!" about.  When I told him, he said, "Eww!  Ick!", but my stalwart companion does not always follow my adventuresome tastebuds where none have gone before.  This is a real awesome recipe.  Thanks, SqueakyLynn!  This is now a fave!

This recipe was excellent! I needed a new, appetizing way to prepare the yams we had, one that my family would get enthused about, and wow did this do the trick! The avocado stuffing recipe also goes excellent with Chicken Nachos. :)

The Concept was good, but the actual taste wasn't. I made this recipe for my family and the Guacamole dressing on top of the Yam was not a big hit. I should have put half a red bell pepper in it and added a tomato. Instead we used the topping as dip for some chips and it was ok like that; but to have it with the sweet Yams wasn't working. I was very disappointed with this recipe.

this rating is for my modified version, NOT the original recipe! i based what i did on the other reviews: microwaved the yams and omitted the cheese, oil (to make it less fatty) and cilantro (didn't have any). it came out very good and the flavors worked together, but i could see the cheese adding another dimension -- will try that next time! don't think i missed anything by not using oil or cilantro, though.

Tasty and feels so decadent without being unhealthy. I skipped the cheese - it was rich enough without.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. Sometimes I play with what I mix with the avocado depending on what's on hand -- the cumin and lime/lemon juice are the most important -- and I don't use the oil. And it's easy too if you're just making one for yourself to toss the yam in the microwave. I highly recommend trying this.

Surprising good! I omitted the cheese and olive oil from the topping.  I baked the sweet potatoes until they were very soft & releasing syrup.  The red pepper needs to be diced really fine or the crunchy texture will interfere with the creamy smoothness of the avocado and sweet potatoes. We make these all the time now, thank you :o)

I followed the recipe exactly and was very surprised how well the flavours went together.  I loved it!!  And so did everyone else in my family.  I will definitely be making this again!!  By the way, I cooked the yams a lot longer than the recipe called for, as I think they were bigger than 8oz and I wasn't ready to top them with the avocado mix when the 40 minutes passed.  I kept them in the oven at 150F for about 45 additional minutes and then added the topping and cheese and threw them back into the oven for about 4 minutes to melt the cheese!  Wow!!  So tasty!

I was a skeptic since this sounded odd, but it was actually good! I nuked the taters to save time and used half of a red pepper and half of a seeded tomato instead of 1 red pepper. I also left out the oil and cheese...completely unnecessary. Yum!

I didn't add olive oil or cumin because I didn't have any.  I also added green peppers, and put in more green onion and lime juice than the recipe called for.  Felt like recipe didn't need cheese.  Couldn't really taste the avocado, but that's probably because of the overload of lime juice and as a result of adding too much green pepper.  If I make this next time, I will add some garlic as well.

This was one of those "I-can't-believe-that-this-will-taste-good-so-I-have-to-try-it" recipes. But WOW, this was suprisingly good! My husband was extremely skeptical but after trying them, he said he wanted more. I did microwave the yams to save time.

This is a wonderful blend of many different flavors!  I was skeptical at first, but I was inthe mood for something different.  I LOVE sweet potatoes and yams, but it seems everyone prepares them the same 'sugary' way.  This turned out GREAT, thanks!

What a great recipe!  The concept is something I would never have thought of (even though I tend to think of guacamole as its own food group.)  I used my own guacamole recipe which includes tomato but not the red pepper.  The contrast between the sweet of the potato and the savory aspects of the guac is wonderful.  I almost left off the cheddar but decided at the last minute to go with the recipe.  It was a good choice.  The cheddar (I used a sharp Colby) adds another great dimension although if you were trying to cut calories it's great without it as well.  Really a super recipe!  Thanks for sharing this.

It's very good, but it's also something you have to be in the mood for.

These were really good. The flavor of the avocado sauce amazed me. I put in lemon juice instead of lime juice. But all 4 flavors (avocado, lemon, cheddar cheese, and yam) were very distinct. And I could taste them all separately as I took a bite. Quite unusual. We used extra sharp cheddar cheese. I think the bell pepper diced is a must because it gives a fun light crunch to the avocado dressing. I couldn't taste the bell pepper but it was a fun crunch. I thought I wouldn't need the olive oil, but it made the avocados smoother. I could maybe go without it next time. Broiled it a bit at the end with the dressings on top so the cheese could melt.
It took quite a bit longer than 40 minutes at 350 to cook all four yams. It was more like 90 minutes. I am unsure of the proper timing however.

This is a bazaar dish, but it's really good!  I tried it because of all the rave reviews.  I'm not sure why this works, but it does, the flavors mix really nicely.  I don't think I would serve this to company, but I know a lot of picky eaters :)  For myself, I will definitely make this again.  One thing I did differently is I used tomatoes instead of red peppers, on the advise of another reviewer.        This recipe is proof that guacamole is good on everything :)

My yams needed some extra time to get soft enough to fluff. After 55 minutes in the oven I just put them in the oven. The avocado mixture was fantastic with the yams though!

Like others, I wanted a different way of eating sweet potatoes. I thought this would be great: rave reviews, I love all the ingredients... I don't know what I did wrong. I like the idea of it, but this one just wasn't for me.

WOW! - what a hit and SO DECLISIOUS! I'm not a fan of avocado but I couldn't help myself - went back for 2nds AND 3rds!  personally I cut out the olive oil and cumin and blended the avocado in a mixer before gently combining the remaining ingredients. . I also mixed a bit of the cheese into the stuffing before putting onto the yams with more cheese.   Yum yum yum! -- excellent!

After reading all the rave reviews, I thought this would be a safe bet for Easter dinner.  My company said maybe it would have been okay without lime juice.

As previous reviews have said-what a very odd combination.  But I thought..I like yams...I like avacado...let's give it a try!   Unfortunately I was the only one out of the family who loved these but then again, I am the only one who loves interesting and flavorful foods.

Another skeptic converted!  I didn't have cilantro but will add it next time.  Also left out olive oil to reduce fat.  These taste great and my husband loved how colorful they were.

I thought this looked disgusting, but all the good reviews made me curious, so I tried it.  Even as I was making this, I thought it looked odd, and my family all thought it looked "gross",  but all the reviews are right.  It's a wonderful combination and my whole family loved it.  I can't wait to gross out my extended family with this one as well! ;-)

It's a very interesting combination. I found the avocado to be creamy enough and didn't add the olive oil. Next time I would use less cilantro, I found it a little overpowering.

I'm giving this five stars because they were easy, the flavors melded together well, and they are very healthy.  I used slightly less oil and next time might try even less.  Olive oil is healthy so I don't shy away when it's needed, but in this case I don't think you really need as much as the recipe calls for.  Definitely will make these again.

I stumbled across this right after I had my wisdom teeth removed and wanted something that was full of flavor and soft enough to eat after surgery. Even though I love all the ingredients, I was leery of the combination. But after a few days of yogurt and mashed potatoes decided to finally give it a try. And am I ever glad I did! Though it looks weird, it is surprisingly delish and I've emailed a dozen curious bystanders the recipe! I added a little more lime juice than the recipe called for, but the tangy avacado paste and the sweet yams were perfect together. The cheddar cheese on top makes the dish look more festive, but for me, didn't add to the flavor. A+++ for a wonderfully creative and scrumptious recipe!

Wow... what a taste :) Like others, thought the combo was strange... but strange enough, it was totally yummie. I included to my taste: red pepper, garlic, lemon juice, sour cream, pesto, cheese and pepper. Truly delicious !!! Thank you.

Like so many other reviewers, my wife loves both avocados and yams.  When I told her about this recipe she was sure I'd finally gone over the edge. But wow did she like it as did my daughter and teenage grandson for whom I had prepared french fries thinking he wouldn't even try the sweet potato.  The store didn't have yams, so I used red sweet potatoes and they turned out great.

This is a pretty sweet recipe. It's original, healthful, and tasty. The only thing I would do it cut the Cumin down to 1/4 tsp because it imparts such a strong flavor.

Very nice recipe. I followed it as written. I forgot to top with cheddar and it was really good. When I reheated in the micro I added the cheese and of course, it was even better. This made a lot for two people so I think next time I will make half.

At first bite I wasn't sure what to think because it is definitely a different mix of flavors. But by the third bite I was in love. What a wonderful and unexpected combination! Hubby was hesitant at first too and then proclaimed they were different, but very good. I added jalapenos to mine and used onion powder instead of chopped onions. Will definitely put this in the regular rotation.

Like everyone else, I was skeptical, but I tried it because I love the two items alone.  I also added some tomatoe to the avocado and a little jalapeno to make a more traditional guacomole.

Amazing together!  I microwaved the sweet potatoes, didn't use olive oil, green onions or cilantro and added a bit of minced garlic then broiled them for a minute to melt the cheese... so delicious.  My husband has asked to have these lots more!!!

These were tasty! I had to cook my small yam for 50 minutes though, and next time may leave them in a little longer. I liked the hot/cold and flavour combo.

Took way to long to cook the yams whole, if I did it again I would cut them before cooking.  Fairly boring.

This dish was okay but I doubt I will make it again.  The flavours melded fine but I didn't find it outstanding.  First off, I love limes but I found the three tablespoons too be a bit much, I think two would suffice.  For the yams, I cut them in half and then baked them.  Once they were done, I scooped out the filling, mixed them with 2 tablespoons of sour cream and put them back in and then topped them with the guacamole.  Out of the whole dish, the guacamole was the best part.

I didn't have time to get fresh guacamole ingredients so I used store bought spicy guacamole. Great way to switch up from the candied yams for Thanksgiving or make any time. I'm not a big yam fan, but I really enjoyed them prepared this way. I will definitely make them again.
