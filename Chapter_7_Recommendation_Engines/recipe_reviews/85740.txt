Wow!  I've never cooked chicken this juicy and delicious before!  I made a few changes to this recipe.  I used plain bread crumbs and added a generous teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  I nixed the rice crispies - only because that's the only ingredient that I didn't have on hand.  I decided against adding melted butter on top of the chicken (I figured there was enough fat already with the cheese).  I also baked at 350 for 45 minutes - I've found that the trick to juicy baked boneless skinless chicken breasts is to bake them at exactly this temp and length of time.  My husband (who is picky about food) actually said "wow" when he saw the finished product.  He also specifically asked that I add this dish into my dinner rotation.  Bravo!  This was a HUGE hit!  I served it with steamed brocolli, pineapple casserole (will post this recipe soon), and garlic parmesean biscuits (will post this recipe soon as well).

I have already rated this recipe once before with 5 stars.  I just wanted to say that I made it for 17 people when my fiancee' and I went to the beach with his family and my family. There were a few very picky eaters in the bunch but this recipe was a success with them.  I cooked 24 pieces of the cheddar chicken for dinner one night and I think there were only 2 or 3 left over.  They were very quickly warmed up and eaten for lunch the next day.  This is one of the best chicken recipes I have ever used.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.

Wonderful! I did make a couple of changes to the original recipe though - 1)I used shredded asiago cheese instead of cheddar 2)I baked it for 45 minutes as suggested by others 3) I used Crispix cereal since that was all I had 4) I dredged the raw chicken thru sour cream before the flour mix 5) I didn't use butter on the bottom of the pan, but did over the tops and then added a little more topping. Turned out amazing... my whole family loved it. I served it with noodles and alfredo sauce, but it would be excellent with spaghetti and marinara too. We'll be having this one again!!

My boyfriend took one bite of this and said "5 stars all the way!". This was SO GOOD! Followed the recipe except I put the garlic powder, salt, and pepper directly on the chicken before dredging it in the flour. I also decided to skip putting all that butter in the bottom of the dish... just sprayed it liberally with nonstick cooking spray. Baked 35 minutes and then broiled it for 3-4 minutes to give it a nice crispy top. Served with mashed potatoes and garlic green beans for a very tasty meal! Thank you!!!

This dish is great...the whole family loves it, and that is extremely rare! This time I added a teaspoon of onion powder to the flour mixture as well and it added just the right extra bit of flavor that I was looking for.

I'm a poor college student, so I cut the recipe down and used only the garlic salt, cheese and crushed croutons for the breading, and it was great!  It only takes a few minutes to prepare after work, too, so I can pop it in the oven and drop!

The only cereal I had on hand was Coco Pebbles and I didn't think those would taste too good, so I left out the cereal.  Used Panko instead of regular dried bread crumbs and a mixture of dried herbs. I also used bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (horrors!) and this came out great.

I made this chicken dish, along with herbed wild rice and fresh steamed greenbeans, in less than 45 minutes. Not only was it quick and simple to prepare (had most ingredients on hand anyway), but the chicken was delicious! It was juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside - I did put the oven on broil for 2 minutes after the 35 minute cooking time was through just to get the tops a little more browned. It's also great as leftovers, heated up or sliced chilled and thrown into a salad. And it can be made into a lower fat dish just by substituting out the cheese for low-fat and cutting down on the butter a little or all together: spray the pan with Pam or grease lightly with olive oil, and omit the butter drizzle. Thanks for the new simple and versatile chicken dish!

Excellent! This tasted wonderful!! The chicken was VERY moist. However, no need to use the full amount of butter at the bottom of the pan. Not needed.

I've made this recipe four times now and it turns out perfect every time. A meat thermometer is the best way to check the "done-ness" without cutting it open in the baking dish. NEVER USE FAT-FREE CHEDDAR CHEESE!

Very good and easy.  I cooked it at 350 for 35 minutes, and it turned out very moist.  I sprayed the bottom of the dish with butter spray, but I would drizzle a little butter over the top, as I didn't and the crust was kind or dry. (I sprayed the top with butter spray and that didn't work.)

Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Kids ate - yeah! I used panko bread crumbs in place of the rice krispies, and plain breadcumbs instead of flavored (this was what I had on hand). I used low fat Cheddar and put a little bit of olive oil on the baking sheet in place of the butter to cut back on the fat. Even with the minor substitutions it was very tasty and I will make again. Also, very good the next day - cold - on a salad with low fat honey mustard dressing.

Very yummy recipe.  We didn't cut the chicken breasts in half.  Cooked for 45 min at 350F.  Turned out VERY juicy and crunchy.  I think the secret to getting a lot of crunchiness is after pressing the chicken into the cheese/crumbs/rice crispies, sprinkle some more of the mix on top of the chicken before drizzling with butter.

I thought I reated these before, but guess not. I use panko bread crumbs instead of the bread crumbs and rice cereal. I don't use the 1/4 c. butter in the pan first, I use more melted butter and drizzle it on both sides and bake them on a rack, DELISH!

Awesome recipe! I made a couple of little changes, I did not have cereal so I added a little extra bread crumbs. Also I used chicken tenderloins so it took only about 25minutes to cook. For the cheese I used a garlic cheddar which added great flavor also I added some Parmesan cheese. I cooked and served the chicken over rice.

I have made this twice now - and get rave reviews from those who eat it!  I doubled the recipe for a Christmas Eve family dinner. It was so good.  I think next time I"ll break up the rice krispies just a little more - as they are a bit recognizeable, and seems funny when someone asks... Are there rice krispies on this chicken?  Definitely a keeper!

I skipped the butter. Sprayed cooking spray on bottom of dish. Added basil and oregano in with the flour and used panko breadcrumbs. Came out crispy, juicy and delicious!

Fantastic! I baked for 45 minutes at 350 and substituted the crispy rice cereal for crushed up jalapeno flavored potato chips. So delicious!

I made this recipe awhile back after searching for just ingredients I had on hand. I didn't feel like grocery shopping that day, lol. It was awesome! Definitely throwing this in my recipe box. The hubby liked it too. The rice crispies gave it that perfect crunchy outer coating.

I made this recipe tonight after reading all of the previous reviews.  The suggestions of others that I followed were these: spray the pan instead of coating with butter, filet thick pieces of chicken, make less of the coating to avoid lots of leftover (I halved all of the dry ingredients), bake for 45 minutes instead of 35, and partially crush the cereal.  My own changes were to cut the chicken into more pieces and to use a frosted corn flake cereal.  Everybody here LOVED it.

Good recipe but I like the version my mother has been making since I was litte...because it is easier.  Use everything in the recipe but instead of the flour, cheese, bread crumbs and cereal, use your favorite cheese flavored cracker crushed up.  My mom uses tiny drummmetes when she makes this and it is a favorite recipe from my childhood.

I made this recipe twice.  You don't need all the butter to coat the pan, otherwise the coating on the bottom won't stay on or crisp like the top.  I had a lot of flour mixture left over so I would suggest decreasing that and also adding your own spices.

Delicious!   Did not use rice krispies as I didn't have any on hand.  I added minced garlic to the egg and milk mixture. Rather then topping with butter before baking (as I had a good pool in the bottom) I cooked until nearly finished, flipped the chicken breasts and allowed the underside to get a little more crispy.   Will make again for sure!

My family thought the chicken was just OK, I actually liked it, however, the bottom was soggy, next time I will use less butter.  Overall, this is a good recipe!

very very good!  Definatly decrease the amount of butter that coats the pan....my chicken was swimming in it after it got done cooking!  The coating stayed on great (that is where i mess up my chicken) My husband and my 3 year old loved it also.

This is a household favorite, and so easy to make. I almost always have the ingredients on hand. I added a sprinkle of basil to mine, and it came out delicious. It's a must have for quick weekday meals.

I substituted a Colby/Monteray Jack blend for the Cheddar, but it was still great!  I love this recipe.  The chicken I used also had big knockers, so I only had to use two breasts for the 6-serving recipe.

Cool recipe!  Easy to make, tasted good.  The most important thing for me was: It uses very common ingredients. The only thing I didn't already have in the house was the rice cereal - instead we used those crispy onion things you put on top of green bean casserole.

Great idea, very tasty. Once I got started I realized I did not have all the ingredients so I used crushed up cheese-garlic croutons in place of the Italian bread crumbs and rice cereal. I will try it as written next time for sure but I think the croutons were a good substitute in a pinch. I do recommend putting some cheese on  in the breading so it crisps up but I put a little on near the end to keep the cheesy taste. Great addition to the recipe box!

Excellent!  My friends and family loved it!  I actually used plain bread crumbs (because that's what I had in the cupboard) and added Italian seasonings and garlic.

This is a good bases to create from. I used marinara sauce on the bottom of pan instead of butter. Then I used parmesan cheese instead of cheddar. Plus I added 1/2 tsp.onion powder to flour mixture. Next I crushed the crispy rice cereal. I still drizzled the 2 TBSP. melted butter over coated chicken breasts. Then I used the rest of marinara sauce on cooked pasta and served with the chicken...very good.

Very good, very moist.  As others have noted, I decreased the butter and it was still great.  Served with the suggested orange romaine salad which was also excellent!  Thank you for a great recipe.

This is DELICIOUS! I didn't use any butter and this turned out juicy and delicious. I just sprayed the pan with olive oil and baked it the same as stated and it is a definite keeper! I also skipped the the milk in the egg wash, didn't think it was necessary, and turns out it wasn't.

Great flavor!  Used crushed Corn Chex instead of Rice Krispies.  Cooked at 350F for 45 minutes, like most reviewers suggested.  There was a little more cheese/crumbs than was needed, but I put in all in the dish and it made for a crispy treat!! This is a repeater!

We enjoyed this chicken because it was so moist inside and who doesn't love anything covered in cheese?  When I make it next time I will add a little more seasoning though since it begins to taste bland after a few bites.

I made this a couple nights ago and it's really good! I only gave it four stars because I think it could have just a little touch more flavor. I'm going to try adding a little lemon pepper next time or dry mustard maybe. I didn't have the cereal so I left that out and I used croutons instead of bread crumbs. I also didn't have cheddar so I used Mozzarella instead.. that may have made the difference. It stayed nice and moist and we really enjoyed it! I will DEFINITELY make this again... several times!

Awesome!  Other than pizza and hot dogs, this is the only thing my 7 year old will eat for dinner.  When my husband and my kids both like it, it must be good.  I don't usually make changes, but for this recipe I do substitute french fried onions for the cereal.

My three year old "Mommy this is the BESTEST supper I ever had!" I think that about sums it up. Excellent. I used shredded chedder and mozza cheese and just regular bread crumbs. And I agree with a few of the other reviews that you can cut down the amount of butter. This chicken was very quick and easy to make, ingedients that I always have on hand. Turned out so moist and crunchy! Thanks! :)

Simple and fun. Mild flavor depending on how much cheese you use.

We did not have the Italian seasoned breadcrumbs so we used toasted bread, smashed in a ziplock bag with Italian seasoning.

We substituted the chicken filet for drumsticks and it was wonderful.

Note: Your cook time or cooking temp will need to be adjusted accordingly. We set our oven to 425 degrees for 40 minutes.

This recipe turned out well.  I served it with brown rice and french-cut green beans.  My fiance' enjoyed it overall.  He said it was very moist and had a different flavor.  
However, there are a few things I'll tweak for the next time I make it.  Instead of butter, I'll use a spray oil, such as Pam, on the pans.  The butter didn't coat the pans as well as I would have liked and I had to keep adding oil so the chicken wouldn't stick.
In addition, I would increase the oven temperature.  I have a gas oven and normally have it set between 425-450* F and adjusting as needed.  350* F was way too slow and I had to increase just for dinner to be done in a timely manner.
I would also add a bit more flavor.  As well as more cheese.  It was a little bland at first and you couldn't taste the cheese.
Overall, this is a good recipe and we will have it again someday soon.  :)

This was just about the best chicken I've ever had!  One of my son's who hates cheese on any kind of chicken, took one bite and raved on and on about how good it was.  The whole family loved it.  I used chicken thighs because that was all I had.  I didn't have Rice Crispies so I used Panko flakes.  I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could!

Good stuff!  I sprinkled the chicken with a little extra pepper before starting.  I also decreased the amount of butter in the bottom of the baking dish by half, and also did not drizzle the extra butter over top.

Made as written and wow this is good.  Although I did not bake in a baking pan and used my broiler pan instead.  Crispy on the top and crispy on the bottom.  Great recipe Judy!  Thank you.

Past the kid test in my house! Great flavor, served with a side of spicy ranch for dipping for me. Will definitely make again! Only change I made was I used Colby Jack instead of cheddar.

By far, one of the best Chicken recipes I've come across! I just made one chicken breast for myself, so I obviously cut back on the amount of ingredients. I didn't have garlic powder or the rice cereal, but I did add some grated Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumb mixture and used white Cheddar cheese. The chicken was moist with a delicious crunchy shell. I served it with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. Would definitely make it again! :)

I didn't use all the breading the first time around because I didn't realize how much there was.  So be generous while you're breading the chicken.  Put all the leftover breading on top of it before baking it.  I also broiled it to make it super crunchy after it was fully cooked. Used it the next day straight out of the fridge on a salad, just slice it up - it was amazing!  Next time I'll pop it in the oven on broil before adding it to the salad to get some crunch back into it.

Excellent recipe. I crushed Chicken Stove Top Stuffing instead of the seasoned bread crumbs and it turned out wonderful. My husband and very picky 12 year daughter asked for seconds. This one is a KEEPER.

This came out amazing! When my bf saw me preparing this chicken, he said that he doesn't eat rice krispies for dinner. I told him to trust me and it came out great!! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I changed was using PAM on the baking dish (instead of butter) and omitted the butter drizzle on top. I am definitely going to make this dish again!

YUM! Decided to use chicken tenders with this recipe just because I thought it would be fun. I skipped the salt and also added in some onion powder. They came out so crispy and were a huge hit with my gang. For you young moms out there, this is a very kid friendly recipe. Thanks so much Judy!!

I've made this twice now. The first time a written & the second time I used tuna steaks & parmesan cheese.  Both were very yummy & even my kids (5 & 2 years old) gobbled it up.  May try with halibut.

This was a good.  I made as written except I used cooking spray in the dish rather than all that butter, and I didn't put any butter on top.  It was enjoyed by everyone.  Took 45 minutes to bake.

I used six thinly sliced chicken breasts, had to double what the recipe called for. I sprayed my cooking dishes with Pam instead of using the 1/4 cup butter, but I did use spray butter on the top of the chicken. I dipped in sour cream, then flour, then egg, then rice cripy mixture. I cooked for 45 minutes. I added a little bit of cayenne pepper for an extra zip.  Its definitely a keeper.

Mmm. This was pretty easy to make and came out really well. I'd suggest skimping a bit on the breadcrumb/rice crispies part of the recipe though, I had a TON left over despite generously rubbing it on.

Not bad -- my kids liked it, which is always a good thing.  But my cheese got a little rubbery and the rice krispies seemed like they were just sort of tacked on there.  I really like the seasoned flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs, so I'll probably do that again, but I think I can live without the cheese and cereal.

Fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly, a rare occurance for me.  Only change I'd make in the future is to cut back on the butter.  With all that butter and cheese, it was a little greasy.  The tasty was great, though!  Thanks!

This recipe was fairly fast and easy to prepare.  My husband liked it alot and commented that the "crust" actually stayed on the chicken better than in some other recipes I've made.  All the kids loved it too!  The cheese was a hit with them.

This is a very easy dish to prepare. It really is fool-proof. I used non-stick spray instead of butter for the bottom of the dish. I also did not have any rice krispies, but the recipe turned out well anyway. The flavor was good and the texture was crispy. Both my husband and 2 year old gobbled this up. A definite keeper!

I made this for a family event and everyone loved it!!  I cooked it at 350 for 45 min like a previous review mentions and it was perfect!!  I didn't use the crisp rice cereal but it was still cripy enough.  The only thing i would do different next time is use plain bread crumbs and season them myself.  As a note some people smothered it with the sauce from the meatballs and LOVED it!  THANKS!

A new family favorite!  I had no intention of altering this recipe but when I went to make it, I was doubling the recipe and then found that I was a bit short on garlic powder.  I altered the spices a bit and used McCormick's Original Chicken Seasoning which has garlic powder in it.  I adjusted the other spices accordingly and also added some white pepper.  Any of the breast pieces which were over an inch thick, I filleted so that the cooking time would even out.  I baked at 350 for 30 minutes in an industrial convection oven and it was perfect.  There was no need to broil in order to brown the outside. I regretfully did not drizzle the butter over the top.  I had poured the remaining cheese crust breading on top and I think  this would have been perfect if I had of drizzled the butter or perhaps added a bit more cheddar cheese to add some moisture to the breading.  The breading was excellent except in areas that lacked cheese and then it was a bit powdery.  Also I crushed the rice crispies a bit before adding to the mix as I couldnt see how it would stick well otherwise.  All in all an excellent answer to what to do with the frozen boneless breasts in the freezer.  My family of six are waiting to have this one again.

The secret is to use the foil cover until the last 10 minutes of cooking.  It will stay juicy and the crust will brown at the end.

This is always my go to recipe for cooking for people for the first time. My father in law is an extremely picky eater and he came back for seconds! He even asked the recipe. The only difference I made is using Colby-Monterey Jack cheese because that's what we had on hand. But I've made this quite a bit and it's a hit every time! No matter what cheese you use. Love love love. Also, I always cook it for a few minutes more, it's still really moist inside but crispy on the outside!

The first time i made it, I didn't like it at all. I gave it another chance and covered it with foil the entire time, which kept it juicy and perfect. I also used 1.5 teaspoons of garlic salt instead of both plain salt and garlic powder.  I didn't use any butter at all. It is so delicious and will be added to my routine!

I did a bit of modifying to work with the ingredients I had at home.

Instead of 1 egg, I mixed milk with some sour cream
Instead of bread crumbs & rice crispies, I used corn flakes
Instead of butter, I used olive oil

I baked at 350 for 45 minutes and these came out just great! Will definitely make again now that I know the ingredients are so flexible!

OMG!! I did make a few alterations...as in adding some different spices, but it was to die for! I normally make 4 pieces of chicken for dinner. It's just my husband and I, so if the chicken is good, we will split half of one of the extra breasts and then he will have an leftover one to take to work the next day. This was so awesome, we both ate 2 breasts!! Unheard of...lol 

The alterations I made were: I didn't have the crispy cereal so I omitted it. When I mixed up the flour mixture I added in cumin since I would be using a Mexican blend shredded cheese (thought I would incorporate some Mexican into the chicken), extra garlic and a shake or two of chayenne pepper to give it a bit of spice. I had Italian bread crumbs, but since I was going for the "Mexican" flavor, I used roasted garlic bread crumbs instead.

It turned out soo fantastic! The yellow rice I paired it with paled in comparison!!

I made this chicken thinking i was going to have something great to serve. While it was fine it wasn't anything to rave about. I made the recipe exactly as stated.

I give it 4 stars because I changed a few things and I don't like when people give 5 stars after making changes!  I left out the cereal because that didn't appeal to us.  Instead I used A LOT more cheese (around 2 cups) and slightly more breadcrumbs to coat the chicken.  It causes messy fingers when making but it comes together real quick and easily.  We followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  I prepared a few hours early and put it in the fridge until time to bake.  I used one Quorn veggie "Chick'n" for me and just placed it in the center with the real chicken surrounding it.  I loved my veggie chicken.  My husband and friends said the real chicken was yummy, flavorful, and juicy.  They loved it too.  Serve with any kind of rice, veggies, and biscuits!

Really good!  I did decrease the butter both in the pan and to pour over the chicken.  Also used garlic flavored bread crumbs because that's what I had.  Yummy!!

This was awesome! I didn't use the cereal because I didn't have any. I agree that it calls for a little too much butter though. Definitely making it again, thank you for posting!

This was just OK.  Too salty (made as written), bottom was soggy in the butter.  Not sure if I'll try it again.

Gosh this was amazing! One of the juiciest, most tender pieces of chicken I've ever had. The crunchy cheese coating is to die for! Overall very easy to prepare. I used more bread crumbs because I did't have the cereal and it still tasted great. I will definitely make this again, thanks!

Very crunchy and tasty.  I added a little more garlic and pepper but it's the crunchy cheese that makes this a huge hit.  I used shredded monterey jack cheese instead of the cheddar and seasoned panko in place of the bread crumbs and cereal.  I also used Pam in the baking dish and used spray butter on the chicken prior to baking.  Will make again!!

I loved this!  The chicken was very tender.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I substituted Shake N Bake Italian mix and I cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp.  I will be making this one again!

Delicious! Will definately make again! Like many others, I omitted the rice crispies and the flavor was still there. Considering the lack of flavor in rice crispies I'm not sure why it's needed. I might reduce the amount of butter next time just because it wasn't needed and to make it a little more healthy.

This is a super quick and easy way to get dinner on the table.  I used 4 chicken breasts and omitted the melted butter.  I sprayed pam on the bottom of the pan and just put a teaspoon of butter on each piece.  Turned out great and reheated great the next day.

Very, very good.  I was looking for something different to do with my blsl chicken breast and came upon this recipe.  I made my own breadcrumbs with Italian seasoning and crushed some Rice Chex cereal in the food processor.  Chicken was extremely moist and tender and the flavor was outstanding.  Thank you

Delicious & so easy to make! I didn't have any rice krispies, so I used crushed up townhouse crackers instead. I also added a little oregano, basil & thyme to the cheese/breadcrumb mixture. I used cooking spray on the bottom of the pan, but still drizzled the butter on top. Mine came out perfect after 40 minutes. I can't wait to eat the last piece leftover for lunch tomorrow!

Literally didn't have to change a thing. I don't say that much. The coating is a bit difficult to get to stick to the chicken, so I had to pour it as evenly over the chicken as I could. Worked just fine. Good!

After reading some of the reviews I made this chicken last night for dinner(without the cereal or butter) and my picky, 9 year old son loved it and asked for more. He even asked if he could take some of the leftovers to school for lunch. That's saying a lot, because he doesn't like eating a whole lot of meats. I will be making this again real soon. It was really simple to make and really taste great.

SO BLAND!!!! I dont know how this recipe got so many stars. It has absolutely no flavor other than the cheese part. I ended up having to add creole, lemon pepper, salt, and more garlic powder at the end. I even added onions on the side for extra umf.

WE LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I do not use the rice cereal, we have tried it with it and didnt care for it too much, I have also used panko bread crumbs which is nice too.  I follow this recipe to a T almost every time (I always add more cheese and whatever is left in the bread crumb bowl I sprinkle on top) :) My son calls it my Famous Chicken, Thanks Judy this one is a keeper.

I didn't use the crispy rice cereal, and used crushed butter crackers with italian seasoning in place of the italian breadcrumbs. I also didn't drizzle the chicken with butter before baking, and used pam to spray the pan. This was amazingly moist and flavorful. Good job Judy!

Following the recipe and directions exactly (and not adding any of my own ingredients) I thought this meal was very good but the flavor wasn't strong enough with my thick pieces of chicken.  Next time I will cut the chicken breasts into 2 or 3 pieces and I think it will give each little piece more flavor than one big piece.

Great recipe.  We pounded the chicken so it was  a bit thinner and we cooked at the temp indicated on the recipe and it turned out fine. We used homemade bread crumbs and added a bit of salt and italian seasonings.  We will make again!

We absolutely loved this.  My husband actually made it, and the only thing he did differently was increase the garlic powder, salt and pepper a bit.  Otherwise, he just raved on and on about it. The amount of butter in it, MAY have had something to do with it. :)  We will definately be making this again, as we have a ton of leftover rice cereal to use up. But when we do, we may try to lighten it up a bit, so we don't feel quite as guilty eating it.  Yum!

I am known for making dry baked chicken breasts so it was a really pleasant suprise to bite into these and find that they were SO juicy!  I didn't use the butter or the cereal and I added a little graded parmesan to the cheese mix.  I also baked for 45 minutes and it was perfect!  Will definitely make this one again!

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I did different was to not put the extra butter over the top. They were perfectly crispy on top, and softer on the bottom with the butter. We'll definitely be having this again!

I made this the other night for my in-laws and husband, all of whom raved about it! I will either pound the chicken or slice it thinner next time because I had to cook it longer and it tasted a tiny bit dry to me (my fault though because the chicken breasts were too thick).  Thanks for the recipe!

OMG this is an amazing recipe! My husband hates chicken and he wanted two pieces and said if I don't make it again he would be upset. Although I did make minor changes only cause I wanted to use some items i already had. Instead of Italian season bread crumbs I used some cheddar garlic croutons crushed and instead of crispy rice cereal I used corn crisps crushed up. Other then those changes I will definitely be making this again!

Our whole family enjoyed this, even though I reduced the butter by quite a lot - reserving it for the drizzle before baking. I substituted olive oil for some of the fat the recipe called for, but it is not necessary to use nearly this much. I believe I also used 2% fat cheese.

I have made this a few times when I didn't have much to make for dinner, but had all the ingredients for this already in the house.  It is great tasting, but the breading always sticks to the bottom of the pan for some reason.

This dish was better than expected. I thought the rice crispies were a good touch... My husband didn't like them though. I guess it depends on your taste. This won't be a once every 2 weeks dish, but it will definitely show up on our dinner table a few times a year.... :) thanks!

I have been making this for 7 years now and it has become my signature dish. My husband loves it, it is one of his favorite dishes. When people try it the first time you can see bliss on their face. This makes me look like an amazing chef. The only thing I do differently is put more butter on the bottom than called for as well as the top but otherwise this recipe is absolutely perfect and shouldn't be changed.

This is one of my family's FAVORITE recipes!  I have made it several times, and have had the kids make it a couple times - which is rather fun for them.  We call it Porcupine Chicken.  Thanks for the submission!

Very tasty dish! Since I have such a large family, I upped the amount of servings to 8, and then used 6 chicken breasts. This worked out just fine, because after I was done with all the coating/rolling, the only thing I didn't have extra of was the egg/milk mixture. I did make a couple of slight changes...I omitted the butter on the bottom of the pan, and sprayed it generously with cooking spray. I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs, so I crumbled up some dry bread in a pan, baked it until it was crispy, crushed it fine, and added some garlic salt, parsley flakes, dried oregano, and dried basil. Other than that, I made this exactly as written. It took a little longer to bake, but boy was it worth it! My family was skeptical when they first saw it, because the chicken does look a little unusual. They all enjoyed it though...thanks for sharing!

Even the pickiest eaters in my house cleaned their plate, and that never happens.  I will make this again and again.  I added about 1/2 t onion powder and cooked it for 40 minutes.  I also did not drizzle with butter.  I will spray the pan with Pam next time to omit some of the fat from the butter.  Delicious!

Very good!!  We just ate this.  So easy to make and pretty inexpensive.  I just sprayed the bottom of the pan with Crisco, then followed recipe exactly.  I did add a dash of onion powder to the flour mixture.  Mine took about 50 minutes to bake, but my chicken breasts were fat.  I think the time varies for everyone.  I served with mashed potatoes and green bean casserole.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe, I will make again soon!!!!!

I did not expect this to be as good as it was, but it was AWESOME!  My kids are not big meat eaters at all and they kept asking for more and more.  I put it on broil at the end and thanks to a phone call, left it under there a little too long and burnt the top, and it still turned out great!

I made this last night and forgot to take a picture of it! I let my husband pick a recipe for dinner and he picked this one. I was a bit skeptical about how it would turn out. It was very delicious and flavorful! In addition to the recipe, I added a drizzle of olive oil in the pan as well as on top of the chicken. In the flour mix, I also added onion powder and Mrs. Dash. The only thing I didn't like was that it does not make for good leftovers the next day. The crust became soggy a day later. It tastes better fresh and warm out of the oven! My husband says "this is one of my new favorites!"

YUM! My husband and I really liked this recipe. I used non-stick cooking spray on the pan instead of melted butter. Also, I didn't have any rice krispies so I went without that part. Made it with a side of yellow rice and it was delicious!

Reduced from 1/4 cup butter to 2 TBSP butter - perfect amount!  Also substituted Pepperidge Farms Herb seasoned stuffing for the italian bread crumbs since it was all I had.  Worked wonderful.  Everyone in my family loved it.  The Rice crispies gave it just the right amount of crisp and my husband didn't even realize I used them.  I served with mashed potatoes and on a whim made a cream gravy that I added cheddar to at the end of cooking.  Everyone loved it!

This was just okay. Nothing amazing, but nothing horrible. I didn't change anything about the recipe. I will probably not make this again.

My family loved this recipe and have requested it again! I did make a few modifications. I was out of milk, so I took the advice of another on here and instead of milk and egg, I used sour cream. I was also out of bread crumbs and Crisp rice cereal, so I substituted stuffing mix that I ground into crumbs and some corn chex that I crumbled a bit so that there wasn't any big chunks. I cooked these for about 45 minutes thanks to the advice of another on here, and they turned out perfect! Moist chicken and a nice crunchy coating! MMMmmMMMmmmm MM! (Don't tell my mother, but it is much better than her baked chicken!)

I just thought that this recipes was alright.  The coating was very tasty and crispy, but the chicken wasn't the greatest.  I'm going to try it again and marinate the chicken before hand.  I also think these would be better as a chicken finger type of dish.

Yummy.  As always I marinated my chicken breasts in buttermilk for a few hours..that makes for some MOIST chicken(if no buttermilk use milk with a few tsp white vinegar) I needed to make this dish in advance for the DH to just put in the oven when I was at work so- I didn't want to melt the butter so I just put pats of butter all along the bottom of a 13x9 dish and laid the chicken on top. (sorry but I did skip the flour and egg part too because when I took the chicken out of the buttermilk they were plenty moist to have the crumbs stick-plus who wants to dirty extra bowls anyway).   I also didn't mix my cheese with the crumbs I just covered the tops of the chicken with it adding on a few more pats of butter to each.  DELICIOUS.  Will keep this one in the rotation..great kid friendly dish(you can even get away with half the butter-it's not necessary).

MMMMMMM!  This chicken was sooo good! I couldn't imagine coating a pan with 1/4 cup of butter so I omitted that step and just used a nonstick pan instead.  I also seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt, pepper & garlic powder and then dredged it in plain flour so that the chicken would have more flavor.  My family absolutely loved it and I will be making it again!

This was good..... nothing special, really.. Needed a bit more flavor for me, maybe next time I'll season the chicken a bit more? Will make again, I'm sure.

Very Good.  The chicken was moist and the coating was both flavorful and crunchy.  My family really enjoyed it.  I used "thin sliced" chicken and it came out perfect when baked for 35 minutes as the recipe calls for.

Really tasty, easy Monday night dinner.  The only change I made was adding a bit of onion powder to the flour mixture before dredging the chicken, on the advice of another reviewer.  I served the chicken with roasted carrots and slices of Italian bread.  This one's a keeper!

This was actually better when it sat in the fridge overnight and heated up as a leftover.  The flavor went thru the chicken much more than the day I made it.  Also, it was very tender and juicy.

My husband made this a few weeks ago, and I really don't know if he followed the instructions or not, but the chicken did turn out juicy, I just thought it didnt have much flavor. Everyone but me had to put ketchup on it. It is something that I may make myself someday just to see since most of the other reviews gave a higher rating.

Excellent!  I didn't have crispy rice, but the coating was delicious without it. I did use a little less butter.  Got lots of compliments. Will definitely make again!

This was pretty good; I did it with bnls, sknls chicken thighs.

One clue... forget the extra butter on top... it was way too buttery tasting and that would help a lot.

p.s. I used corn flakes for the crunch...

I made this for company, it was great. I used 6 skinless, boneless breasts (abt 2 lbs), and had to add an extra egg. I had very little of the flour & breading mixtures left. The cereal stuck to the chicken just fine & gave a nice texture. I used cheddar jack cheese blend (all I had), and would add Parmesan next time for a little extra something.

I followed the recipe exactly, and even added garlic and additional spices for flavor, but I still wasn't impressed.  It tasted much better once I heated up some spaghetti sauce and poured it over my plate of chicken.  After all the rave reviews, I was very disappointed.

Absolutely, positively AMAZING! I would have never thought to use Rice Crispies as a coating, and the chicken was moist (my biggest fear about chicken)! My entire family just got done eating this a few minutes ago and we're all VERY satisfied! Thanks for a great recipe!

I really liked this recipe.  As a college student, I actually had most of the ingredients on hand so it made this dish inexpensive.  The assembly-line-esque prep of this dish made it quick and very easy.  My only reservation about this dish was that it was just a little dry, but it still tasted excellent and I will probably try it again, just with some marinara sauce or perhaps with a barbeque sauce marinade.

This was delicious! My husband loved it! I did not have crispy cereal so I used corn flake crumbs. It turned out great. My husband wants to try it again with the crispy cereal, so he went out and bought some. Thanks, it's a keeper.

Delicious! I accidently dipped the chicken in the egg first,then flour,then crumbs. The chicken was still edible and flavor full. Next time i'll do it right.

Very surprising the rice cereal coating was as good as it was.  Would make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly as far as ingredients. I did cook the chicken for 40 minutes and covered the dish with foil until the last 10 minutes. We all liked it and my husband isn't usually a big fan of chicken. We'll definitely try this again!

Smells delicious. Made this dish gluten free friendly but using rice flour and corn meal for the bread crumbs. Added a few spices too.

Made this for dinner tonight. It was good, tasty. It took a little longer to cook, maybe next time I will cut the chicken into strips. I didn't have any eggs, so I used mayo. I also used Panko crumbs. 
I would make this again,

This was simple and delicious! I used Panko crumbs with a separate Italian seasoning since I didn’t have seasoned crumbs. Turned out very well. We are making them again tonight with tenderloins. I cook my chicken at 425° for about 25 min. This keep the chicken moist.

This came out really delicious. I made it for my daughters who are extremely picky and they  loved it. I had to make small changes due to the fact that I have a  gluten allergy, so I did replace the regular flour with Red Mill's Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour and the bread crumbs with Nature's Promise GF Panko bread crumbs. Same measurements as the regular ingredients. I liked the idea of adding Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs as another reviewer had done and will try that next time because GF bread crumbs never come seasoned. I ended up cooking it for 40 minutes. I also used boneless, skinless chicken tenders only because that is what I had on hand and I didn't add the rice crispy cereal because I didn't have it. I LOVED the seasoning so much I even ate the seasoning that had browned and was left over in the pan, it was just that good. I'm so glad I made 2 extra pieces so I can have it for lunch tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe it will definitely go into my favorites.

I was looking for a recipe to use for my chicken breast which I wanted to serve for dinner for myself and my husband.  I only had about 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs so I toasted 2 end pcs from a loaf of bread and crushed them to produce the half cup needed.  I also did not have rice cereal so i substituted it with the bread crumbs that I made. I also used mixed grated cheddar and mozzarella.  It turned out great! Thanks for this easy recipe!

REALLY TASTY!! I followed a few suggestions from other reviews that made complete sense to me ........ I added a bit of onion powder and extended the cooking time to 45 minutes. Next time I will skip the milk hoping the coating sticks better for cutting and eating, and I will add a dash of cayenne or red pepper flakes. I used Panko versus Italian bread crumbs and no cereal. The Mrs. was really complimentary and encouraged adding it to my "regular" meal list.

I've made this recipe lots of times and it comes out great every time! the first time I used it I only had special K on hand so I used that and I've also used rice krispie. I prefer using special K. I don't stray from the original at all. I'm making it tomorrow for lunch and I might broil it for a few mins to get a nice crunch on the top.

Per another reviewer I omitted the rice crispies (I didn't have them and really don't care for them).  I also had to season my bread crumbs and  omitted the extra butter on top.  I made one other change: After dredging in the flour I dipped the chicken again in the egg mixture then dipped in the breadcrumb mixture.  I think this makes the final coating stick better.  I also cooked the chicken for 45 minutes.  It was the most moist chicken breast ever!  I will make it again.

Delicious - everyone loved it, and my husband said I need to make sure I add it to my list of regulars.  I didn’t have rice crispies, so like many others, I used panko breadcrumbs in their place along with the Italian seasoned regular breadcrumbs.  I also sprayed the dish instead of the melted butter on the bottom, adding the extra butter on top instead.  One thing I might try in the future is using corn flakes or wheaties, as I would imagine they’d add a good crunch.

This is my go-to recipe for a quick company dinner. Always a big hit! I find partially crushing the rice cereal helps it stick, and putting the grated cheese on top rather than in the coating, prevents wasted cheese melting in the bottom of the pan. I serve it with roasted Rosemary  potatoes and fruit chutney.

I've made this recipe literally countless times by now.  I found it years ago and if you were to ask my kids what their favorite dish is they'll say "cheese chip chicken" which is what they call this for some reason.  I didn't read all the reviews since there are so many but if it hasn't been said yet, I want to advise anyone making this to:   -Cut their chicken in half if the breasts are super large.  -Bake for 45 minutes.  -Salt the chicken with rock salt before you begin the steps of dredging.  The chicken is extremely tasty and moist.  I wouldn't change a single ingredient.

This was great!  The chicken was tender and juicy and the coating was tasty and crunchy!  It was all gone fast!  I would serve this with almost any side and vegetable and would go good over pasta the next day too!

This is a favorite in our house! I've made it several times, and have made it exactly as described and other times, I've made some changes. We are big on leftovers so sometimes I will double the recipe. Also, try this with some Cajun seasoning if you want to add some spice, it's fantastic!

This is a keeper!  My 8 year old said it was the best chicken he's ever had.  I made it exactly as stated in the recipe except I did not put butter in the bottom of the pan (to save calories) and my chicken breasts were thick so they took 45 minutes to bake.

So fast to make and so delicious. Would be perfect for a big crowd. I melted the butter in the pan while the oven was preheating. Did not add the  cereal or the extra butter on top. Cook at 350 for 40-45 minutes.

I've made this several times and it comes out great every time! I follow the recipe exactly except that I don't add the butter to the bottom of the pan. I just spray the pan with cooking spray. It is always very juicy and crispy! Everybody always loves it!

This recipe is great and now my go to way to prepare any type of breaded chicken. I didn't have crispy rice cereal and instead used panko which worked out fine. I would suggest cooking it 45 minutes though, 35 minutes was not quite enough time.I didn't find much need for the added butter either so have eliminated that from the recipe when I make it. Tender, juicy perfectly cooked chicken every time. I make baked chicken parm from this recipe by subbing the cheddar for mozzarella and after a half hour in the oven, cover with sauce and cheese and cook another 15. So good and so much better than frying.

I made this recipe this evening for dinner for my son and I and we love it. We ate the chicken with green beans, mac n cheese and hawaiin rolls and it was awesome having all the flavors coincide! The chicken was juicy not dry so the cooming time was perfect for that matter. It was a quick, easy, delicious meal!!!

This was delicious and juicy, even though I had my doubts, especially about the butter on the bottom of the dish. I did change it slightly to what I had on hand. I swapped the garlic powder for a little garlic salt and onion powder (how could I not have garlic powder, I have NO clue!), I used regular bread crumbs and mixed in a little over a tablespoon of Italian seasoning, and just ditched the cereal because I personally thought it might be slight over-kill on the crunchy. As for the butter, I used probably a little less than a teaspoon per each piece of chicken, only because I cut them into kid-sizes instead of huge pieces (the chicken breasts I had were pretty thick). However, all and all it was a keeper and my mom insisted this becomes a regular.

Yummy! I used coconut oil in the pan instead of butter, and I only had frosted rice crispies so I used that. Before cooking, I topped the chicken with as much of the left over cheese/cereal mix and then poured the butter on. It was perfect after 35 minutes at 350 degrees. We made this kinda like a twisted chicken and put it on top of mashed potatoes and corn, topped it with Franks Buffalo sauce- YUMMY! The sweetness and the heat were yummy together.

This was delicious, made it just as stated in the original recipe, the only problem I encountered was I had to double the egg mixture to coat all my chicken (no biggie). Fantastic flavors, will definitely make again!

5 Stars all the way! I was looking for a last minute easy chicken recipe when I stumbled across this gem.  I had all the ingredients except the Rice Krispies.  It still turned out amazing.  I will try it with the Rice Krispies in the future for sure.

Great chicken dish. I didn't put butter in pan or use rice krispies. I did use half panko and half italian bread crumbs.  Next time I'll try the suggestions of some onion powder and a sharper cheese mixed in.

This was great! Very easy to make, and the chicken tured out very juicy. The only thing I might change next time is the amount of the batter ingredients ( flour mix and cheese mix). We had a fair amount left over of both. But I will be making this again!

Best meal I cooked in a long time :) I did things a little different I added onion powder instead of garlic powder and I diced up some garlic and thru into both the flour dip and the bread crumb dip, I also used regular sandwich bread cheese since that was all I had  around the house! By far very yummy

This recipe was fantastic! It is on our rotation for sure! My very picky kids loved it.  
I made some modifications that didn't change the spirit of the recipe too much. I used only 2 TBS of butter for the bottom of the pan (I just used the oven to do the melting for me and then I added the chicken), no rice cereal (didn't have it), and no added butter on top.  The cheese added enough flavor with out the added butter.

Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!  I had abandoned chicken a while ago because it was really all the same boring flavor, and honestly I always over cooked it because the consistency freaked me out. Well, thanks to the recipe, I'm back in love with that amazing bird!  I recluctantly made extra (next day lunch), but not one piece survived dinner time. I had seconds, and then another half! Everyone in the house loved it! It cooks so perfectly that it was tender, juicy, and the perfect texture for my picky pallet! The flavor, indescribable. This is truly the best chicken ever!

This was very simple & good. Tip: you can add a spoon full or more of plain yogurt to the egg mixture to thicken it up. Yogurt can be used if you are lacking a few eggs to.

Tried this recipe tonight and my boyfriend and I both loved it! I took one of the other reviewer's advice and broiled the chicken for a few minutes after baking it for 35 minutes and it was perfect! I also used a little less butter at the bottom of the baking dish than the recipe called for and I don't feel like it was missed!

I cater dinners for busy families so I didn't really feel like I could put cereal on the chicken.  However, this chicken was delicious.  I seasoned each piece of chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder on both sides and then went through the breading process.  I did not use the butter.  I just greased the pan and sprayed the top of the chicken with butter flavored Pam.  Had to cook for a little longer because I had so much chicken.  This chicken was moist and tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  My family loved, loved, loved it and so did my clients.  Thank you!

I reduced the amount of butter needed but otherwise followed the recipes.  It is indeed tender/juicy chicken.  Do not cook longer than 35 min or it will start to dry out.

I used a similar recipe from Real Simple magazine that used crushed butter crackers (Ritz) rather than the bread crumbs. Equally delicious, and super juicy chicken!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I followed all the directions other than measuring out the butter. I just "eyed" it. The chicken, I also cooked for 45min. It came out so flavorful and moist. I loved it, and will make it again!! My husband also loved it. Thank you for sharing this!

This was a fantastic baked chicken recipe and I will certainly make it again!

I also altered the recipe by one of the most helpful positive reviews; I cooked it for 45 minutes, used plain bread crumbs and Italian seasoning instead, and didn't use any cereal or eggs (I ran out! eek!). It was crisp, tender, and juicy. DELICIOUS.

The entire family loved it, even my husband, who typically denounces baked chicken, and my son, who has the horrific early leanings of a vegetarian. Husband requested that this be added to our repertoire. Ingredients are things I typically have on hand and it came together quickly, even though I started last minute with frozen chicken breasts. Cleanup wasn't bad either.

My husband really liked this. I made NO changes, except that i only had plain breadcrumbs so i just made them italian by adding oregano and some other italian spices. This recipe was very easy, fast, and good. not great health-wise so i wont make it too often, but in a pinch its perfect because you probably have all of the ingredients on-hand already without having to make an extra trip to the store. Im betting you could use something other than rice krispies cereal if you dont have it on hand (ritz or something similar). Thanks!

I didn't make it exactly like the directions say.  Instead, I crumbed my own bread by hand using whole wheat bread and added Italian herbs as found on another site to make the Italian seasoning.  I also replaced the cheddar with Italian mix shredded cheese.  It came out delicious!  My boyfriend and I will definitely make it again (making it my way, of course)!

Absolutely loved this recipe! I changed the rice krispies to panko bread crumbs because that is what I had on hand. And I baked at 350F for 45 minutes. Other than that I did not change a thing. My husband and I will definitely be eating this again! Thanks for the recipe!

The first recipe I ever made from this site. I followed as directed the first three times, but on the fourth time I forgot the cheddar cheese and the only thing i had at the house was shredded mozzarella. So i just substituted the cheddar for mozz. It was even better! I would give it a try :)

Very easy recipe that was delicious! Like others, I omitted the melted butter on top; I don't think the dish really needs the extra fat.

I have to cook Gluten free so I used GF flour, Rice chex (mashed up) and no bread crumbs.  This dish makes me feel like I'm not deprived of anything.  Thank you!

This recipe was amazing! My fiance went back for seconds, claiming this was my best dish to date. Only thing I did differently was ditched the cereal and  went for a heavy hand with the cheese. I paired this with some roasted red potatoes... and a winter ale. This dish will certainly get you out of trouble!

The recipe was easy and created very juicy chicken. I am not loving the flavor since it is very cheesy, but my family loved it and they are asking I make this again.

This was found by my 14 year old son.  The only thing we changed was the crispy rice. We didn't have this but we did have honey nut cherrios.  Added some really good flavor!

The family loved this! I made some changes. I didn't use the cereal and I did use Panko. Also I used Parm instead of Cheddar. I baked it for 45 min. per other reviews and it was perfect.

Deeeeeeeeelicious!!!!  I followed this recipe almost to the tee ... however, I didn't have any milk on hand so substituted a dollup of sour cream in place of the milk.  I have a recipe book that I put all of my favorite recipes in & this one made the book!!  Yum, yum, yum!!  Thank you for this recipe :)

SOOO yummy!! I took the advice of others: skipped the butter (used butter cooking spray instead), added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, used plain bread crumbs, cooked at 350 for 45 min, and broiled for about 5 min after.

This was great!!!  I didn't have the cereal, so I followed the recipe with that exception.  I also cut each chicken piece into 4ths instead of in half and baed at 350 for 27 minutes = PERFECTION!  My husband walked over and ate a piece right out of the pan and said "This is REALLY good!"

It was good and juicy. Needed more salt for sure and added more cheese on top. Wasn't bad.

I've never fixed such most chicken before!  I left out the rice cereal and used Panko instead of regular bread crumbs.  Added a little onion powder to the flour mixture.  I agree with other reviewers that there is WAY too much butter in the bottom. Next time I would leave it out and just spray with cooking spray. I thought the cheese added a little bit of a weird taste to it so I might experiment with a different kind other than cheddar. DH grunted all the way through the meal though which means he liked it. Thanks for posting!

this was absolutely delicious... I did run out of cheese and had to improvise with other cheeses, I used " 1/4 c of cheddar, 1/4 c of taco blend and 1/2 c mozzarella" it is DELICIOUS! I will definitely be making this again.  I did  use an extra egg too, and instead of cutting the breast in half, I used 4 whole chicken breast and had more than enough ingredients with this recipe.  Thanks for posting this!

The first time around I always feel that the recipe should be made exactly as shown and then changed to meet one's special taste.  That I did and I will not change a thing!  I cut my one chicken breast into quarters the second time I made it, as it was slightly frozen...it still came out perfectly! 
This is going to be used as our chicken nugget recipe, also, as it has more depth in flavor...great recipe!

will definately go in my chicken breast rotation. i only greased the bottom of the pan, i liked the crispiness of the coating, but didn't really care for the taste of the melted butter. i going to have to find some kind of substitute for the butter, because i believe it adds to the crispiness.

I've been using this recipe for a few years now and it's ALWAYS a huge hit. Everyone that trys it loves this dish and I always have a least one person in the group ask for the recipe. 
Because I have to cook for so many people when I make it, I end up at least tripling the ingredients. I also sprinkle additional cheddar cheese on the bottom of the baking dish prior to placing the chicken in it. I also heavily sprinkle more cheese over the top of all the chicken once in the dish and drizzle anywhere from 1-2 additional tablespoons of butter over the chicken before placing it in the oven. The dish turns out much more cheesy (and fattening) than the original recipe. It's become my family & I's favorite chicken dish!

This was sooo good and really juicy.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  I used only 2 tablespoons of butter for the bottom of the pan and it was plenty, and I used garlic salt in the flour mixture.  I had no problem with the coating being soggy.  I didnt put any butter on top and it was fine.  I put some extra cheese on top instead.  Will definitely make again!

made this with bone-in split breasts and it was delicious. Definately would be better with boneless breasts though because it was hard to get the meat off the bone without disturbng the delicious coating!

Flavor was ok.  But the crust was a little mushy.  I probably will not make this again.

I hate chicken, but I had to eat a piece of this one! It was so good.  I originally made this for the bf, but it looked delicious, so I tried it and loved it.  I didn't drizzle butter on top, but next time I am going to leave out the butter on the bottom and only put the butter on top.  Yummy!

Awesome and juicy.  Definitely will be using this recipe again.  I opted not to use the butter on top like some of the other reviews said.  Great flavor and even my very picky husband liked it.

I did like this recipe, easy to make and over all very good, not too cheesy, not too salty. I really like the crunch the cereal gave to the breading!  I only gave it a 3 however because I REALLY don't like when breading on chicken (or anything else) gets soggy. I don't know if it was the butter on the bottom of the pan and the pouring of the butter over the top that made some spots of the breading soggy or not. I may try to experiment with this, using no butter, turning the chicken over 5 minutes left until its done, ect. to try to get rid of that soggyness. When I get it right I'll let you all know :-)

Wow!! I LOVED this recipe! Full of flavor, and so easy to make! Followed this exactly. I pounded the chicken and got large portions out of it. Husband gobbled this up and wanted seconds. Will be serving this to parents this weekend!

This dish is simple to make and delicious.  My Husband requests it all the time, and I'm happy to make it for him.  It goes great with steamed vegetables or mashed potatoes.   The only thing I do differently is fillet, or pound the chicken until it is thin for more surface area and quicker cooking time. Great recipe.  Thanks for posting.

I stuck pretty close to the recipe for this and the whole family loved it. I was out of store bought bread crumbs so I put 3 peices of toast in the food processor with 1/2 tsp of oregano and basil and used that instead. It took about 45 min at 350 for the chicken to be done.

We did not care for this at all.  Coating was too thick and dry, chicken was moist and tasted good but couldn't get past the much too dry crust.

To us, this just tasted like Shake 'n' Bake.  And it probably could have used more cheese, maybe piled on the top in addition to mixed with the bread crumbs.

This recipe was great! very easy to follow, and the ingredients were readily available. I substituted butter with olive oil for a healthier option.   however i felt my chicken was a little overcooked? perhaps i should have baked it for 30 minutes instead. nevertheless, an awesome recipe that i'll be using again! thank you for sharing!

We thought it was great for a good quick meal. I didn't have crispy rice so I used French's Frech Fried Onions and crushed them really well. Also I didn't drizzle butter over the top thinking conservatively but the top would have been more crispy like the bottom so next time...

I made some changes though. I sprayed my baking dishes with non-stick spray rather than use all that butter. Instead of breasts I used legs and thighs. To the flour mixture I added a teaspoon of onion powder as well as chili powder. I think I will increase the amounts of garlic, onion and chili powders next time for a more prominent flavour. For the egg mixture, one egg would not have been enough for my chicken pieces so I used two and replaced the milk with two tablespoons of sour cream (didn't want to open a new bag of milk just for a few drops) which worked just fine, and probably added more to the chicken than the milk would have. I followed the coating to the letter, but I would like to suggest using a a strong cheddar so that the cheese can be noticed... All I had was a mild white cheddar and that wasn't strong enough. Definitely use the yellow cheddar, or if you prefer white, old or extra old. Many reviews chose not to drizzle on some butter before cooking but I went ahead and did... It's not necessary, as the it only makes the chicken greasy and adds unneeded calories. I cooked mine for 50 minutes, flipping halfway through to ensure even crispiness.

This recipe is very good, the chicken came out juicy! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there was 2 much butter in the bottom of the pan so it got soggy. Other than the bottom of the chicken it was delicious! Next time I make it I will not put that much butter in the bottom.

This baked chicken has become a family favourite. After trying the recipe for the first time (as specified in the orginal recipe), found it a little too greasy with all of the added butter. Since then, I have made it without the butter and just sprayed the bottom of the pan with non-stick oil. Now it is perfect and loved by the entire family.  Thanks for the recipe =)

Very good chicken.  I followed the recipe almost exactly the first time making this and it was simple and tasty.  The flavors are really neutral and can be paired with just about anything.  Perfect for a quick, weeknight dinner.  I will make this again and make a few minor changes.  I didn't need nearly all of the cereal/bread crumbs/cheese mixture to coat the chicken, so I will cut back those ingredients next time to avoid the waste.  Also, I will decrease the butter - it's not too much in the original recipe, and is delicious and very moist, but I'd like to cut out some of the excess calories next time.

Delicious. Next time will make a few adjustments: make half the amount of the flour mixture and the bread crumb mixture. (I used 6 breasts instead of 3 and still had extra for both. I even put extra breadcrumb mix in the bottom of the pan.) Will add another spice to kick the flavor up a little. My 2 yr and 3 yr olds loved it.

omitted the cereal because i didnt have any. The chicken came out crispy on the outside with lots of flavor, and moist on the inside. Instead of cutting in half  I pounded the chicken enough to even it out. Loved it, will make it again.

Next time I will follow the directions exactly!  I left out the butter in the bottom of the pan to make it more healthy.  The extra calories would have been worth it.  This was delicious! I doubled it and am SO glad I did!  I'll freeze the extra pieces on a cookie sheet then pop them in a ziploc bag.  Then we'll have a quick dinner ready on a busy day.

This is a delicious dish!  I usually prefer fried or grilled chicken over oven-baked chicken...but this is great!  I wouldn't change a thing.  I cut the chicken into pieces & mixed it in rice & canned corn & it was so tasty!  Thanks Judy for this wonderful dish! This would defintely be a dish for kids too!

Easy, Yummy and solid recipe. I followed the directions to a tee. This recipe gave me an excuse to buy my favorite childhood cereal :)I as well did not melt the pan with butter instead I just sprayed it with non-stick spray. Served with Asparagus and Linquine with red sauce. Next time I will serve with fries or mashed instead of pasta. The pasta added a Italian flair that didn't match the chicken. Thanks Judy for a quick week day meal!!

We love this in my house. It was a big hit with friends too - everyone always has seconds. I skip the cereal and I spray my baking dish with non-stick canola oil instead of coating with butter.

These were pretty tasty. My kids enjoyed them and that is always a plus. The only thing I did different was used chicken tenders. They do need a bit more seasoning but that's okay so that's why I gave a four star. Other than that, they were pretty good. Enjoy!

I skipped the flour step because I didn't have any flour...this was a night before grocery shopping meal. And I didn't miss it. I might try it next time, but even without it I would rate this a 5 star recipe.

Pretty good! Not fancy or gourmet, but nice and simple for a weeknight meal, with an appealing taste, and a moist interior. I'll definitely make this again, but next time I think I'll add some onion powder along with the garlic to the flour mixture. Cooked perfectly for me in a glass dish at 350 for 30 minutes.  I did skip the 1/4 cup butter - it probably would have been better with it, but using non-stick spray on the dish instead saved 400 CALORIES, and 44 grams of FAT (including 28.8 grams of SATURATED FAT and 1.2 grams of TRANS FAT), and it was plenty good without it.

This is by far the best chicken recipie I have made..EVER..and I cook chicken quite frequently.  In the future, I plan on trying it with margrine instead of butter, to cut down on the fat factor.

what a wonderful, wonderful way to jazz up baked chicken. I have a good mind to try this with whole chicken as a substitute for fried chicken.   I had my suspicions regarding the copious amounts of butter indicated and used half the amount. Even then the chicken was a bit greasy and soggy from the bottom. Also not having egg at hand I used half and half mixed with a bit of cheddar cream cheese in lieu. I also added in 1/2 cup parmesan cheese to half cup cheddar and it turned out wonderful. I will definitely be forwarding this one to more than one person and would try to stick to the actual recipe the next time around :)

This was super yummy and easy!! I omitted the butter and the cereal because I didn't have it and upped the amount of breadcrumbs, plus added some parmesan cheese to the mix! I put it on top of spaghetti and my famous italian sauce! Super delicious!

this will replace my fried chicken! full of flavor and jucie! thanks for the recipe!!! although i didnt use the traditional cheddar, i used an italian blend of mozzarella, provolone, romano, asiago, and parmesan cheeses and omitted the cereal and butter. i did use cooking spray on the cookie pan i baked the chicken in. next time i will use the cooking spray and top the chicken with melted butter as the recipe called for. the hubby said it was one of the best chicken he has had at home! thanks again!

Followed recipe exactly except I used boneless thighs.  The cooking directions left them very very tender.  Could use a little more flavor though.  Maybe some kind of herb like rosemary or even a little oregano.  I thought the leftovers were better than the original serving. Worth trying to doctor up a little.

I don't usually like home-baked chicken, but this was pretty good. I used fillets instead of full-thickness breasts, 1 cup italian Panko crumbs instead of cereal and bread crumbs, cut the butter in half and baked 50 minutes at 350 degrees. The bottom of the chicken was a little soggy from sitting in the butter. Next time I'll use even less butter or skip it altogether. I've tried about a half dozen baked chicken recipes so far, and this is my favorite. Thanks for sharing.

This dish got mixed reviews... I modified the recipe as follows - I used panko bread crumbs instead of the rice cereal, added 1/4 tsp. onion salt to the flour mix, and liberally sprayed Pam in the pan rather than using the 1/4 cup of butter originally called for. My husband felt like it was a little bland, but the rest of us enjoyed it.

This is really good and my boyfriend really liked it too. I used Cornflake Crumbs instead of rice crispies, only because that's what I had on hand. next time I will use more cheese. I will be making this again and again.

We really liked this.  I didn't have Rice Crispies, so I subbed in Cheddar French Fried Onions, it was delicious. Also, added about a tablespoon of sour cream to milk/egg mix.  Delicious.

I thought this would be complicated to make, but I was wrong.  It's so easy and uses ingredients that I usually have around, so now I make it all the time!  The only thing I do differently is I don't cut the chicken breasts in half, and I bake them at 350 degrees for 45 minutes and they come out perfect everytime.

This was quite tasty.  I didn't have cereal, so I used 1/2 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) (as well as the called-for Ital. breadcrumbs).  It was great and my kids loved it too.  And, I cooked it for the suggested time and it was perfect.  Other reviews said to cook for 10 additional minutes, but it would've been overcooked then.  Thanks!

I make this often. It's a little heavy on the prep end, but I ALWAYS take SummerLynn's advice from her review and (lightly) coat the chicken in sour cream before the flour. An extra step, a little messy, but it is makes for the most succulent, moist chicken that it'
s totally worth it!

Reminds me of "Famous Butter Chicken" from this site.  Both are yummy but this one requires more work.

I put all of the dry ingredients in the same bowl. It was easier that way, and it worked just fine. I didn't have any rice cereal, so as you can see from my picture, I used Cheerios. I thought the chicken smelled better than it taste. My husband thought it was just okay.

OMG!!! this is the best recipe and the most simple one that ive come across in ages for chicken.  I used chicken breast with the bone and skin still on as I didnt have any skinless or boneless.The only thing I do different is I put on a sprayed rack on a tinfoil covered pan.  This way the you dont have to add more calories by buttering the dish before hand.  It also makes the chicken crisp all the way around it.  My kids just loved it, and it was so tender inside.  This is a recipe I am going to send around to all my friends and co-workers.  A matter of fact, I had it in the oven right now.  Just 10 mins more to go and yum lol.

First off THANK YOU for this GREAT recipe!!! I used McCormick Crusting Blends Italian Herb and Cheese with Panko Bread crumbs and added a few dashes of crushed red peppers... I also substituted mozzarella and cheddar mixed cheese rather than just Cheddar and WOW this was awesome and got rave reviews from the family! I can't wait for my husband to come home and try it!! Dont be afraid to make little adjustments to your taste. I can imagine changing little things on this and coming out with a new flavor each time!! Happy Cooking!

I loved this dish, only had corn flakes cereal on hand, so used that.  Did not drizzle butter over top because the butter in the bottom of the dish seemed like enough.  Will make this again!

Great recipe as is!  

Though sometimes I add 1/2 tsp of cayenne for a little kick and I bake on stoneware so I don't use any butter at all.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out okay. It seemed like it needed something else to make it more flavorful. Would make again but would add some more seasoning or maybe some vegetables.

This was so fantastic!! My fiance' loved it so much I actually had to make another piece for him to take to work for lunch. I didn't have any rice cereal so I just used the seasoned bread crumbs. I served it with rice and green beans!!! It was buttery, cheesey, tender and so delicious. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

I made this last night and it was wonderful. Thank you very much for the recipe. The only thing I did differently was I added  ritz crackers for the breading instead of the bread crumbs and cereal. Next time I make it, I will inject the chicken with garlic and herb seasoning to give the chicken a little more flavor. I will make again, Thanks! :)

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was quite a mess to prepare, but worth the work! The rice cereal gives a nice crunch to baked chicken and the cheese just puts the taste over the top. The chicken breasts I used were huge so I had to adjust cooking time but a meat thermometer gets it right each time. I will recommend highly.

I make this dish very similarly and serve it with pasta in a spicy tomato cream sauce. I coat the chicken differently though.  I use mayonnaise, then into the bread crumbs mixture, in which I also add red pepper flakes for a kick.  Not the healthiest version, but goooood.

It tasted good but I felt it could have been better. The cheese was crunchy, not soft as I had imagined it. I served it with potatoes and my boyfriend really liked it.

We love this simple and tasty recipe!  I have also added finely chopped left over broccoli to the dipping bread mixture and it adds another dimension and a bit more color.  Great week night recipe!

Great recipe, consistently great. The chicken always turns out tender and juicy. I usually substitute the cheddar for a higher end cheese - gouda was excellent in this!

Very moist. I also took the advise of other reviewers and coated the chicken in mayo prior to pulling through the flour mixture. Also added a dash of dried onion to the flour mixture. The end result? No leftovers. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic.  We loved it and I shared it with my family.  I used three regular chicken breasts and had lots of leftover coating so you could easily make more if you wanted to (or cut the recipe in half).

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!! I would give this one ten stars if possible! The only change I made was instead of italian bread crumbs (didn't have any) I used crushed ritz crackers with some Italian seasoning mixed in! The chicken was VERY tender and I was afraid the coating would burn before chicken was done, but it was also very soft, but still held! I loved this and will be making it again!

This is great. The chicken is so juicy and the coating gets nice and crispy. I havent had the bread crumbs so I have toasted bread and crumbled them and then added italian seasoning.  I also brown the chicken a bit more by putting it under the broiler for the last few minutes.

This was good, but my kids didn't care for it at all. Although my husband and I thought the crust was tasty, the kids (includes teens) pretty much scraped it off and just ate the chicken, and not much of it.

This was pretty good, and very easy to prepare.  The only problem I had was the breading not sticking to the chicken after it came out of the oven, but overall the flavor was good and I loved the "crunch".  Thanks!

My family enjoyed this chicken. I had some topping left after I coated the chicken so I went ahead and sprinkled it on the chicken and then drizzled the butter on the top. We will have this again.

I made this hoping to entice my picky eaters to eat chicken.  They did try it, and didn't like it, but they haven't liked any chicken dish I've made. It was moist, but I felt the flavor was bland. I wasn't too crazy about the cheddar cheese either. I won't make it again.

This was really good and really easy!  This is one of those no-fail recipes.  I make a parmesan chicken that is similar and rather than dipping the chicken in milk and egg, I coat the chicken with sour cream and then dip in the flour mixture and it is super yummy.  Enjoy!

After reading other reviews, I too added onion powder.  Also used 2 eggs and that stretched the coating just enough.   This got rave reviews from ALL of my family's picky eaters.  A keeper!

I've tried now about 4 different breading styles and to date, this one's the best. Tastes a little like KFC (I think they use cornflakes instead of rice crispies though.)I also used Mexican four-cheese in place of the cheddar. The chicken was baked on a pie cooling rack over a pizza pan and basted in butter every 5 minutes

Excellent recipe!  These are the few changes I made...did not use the butter on bottom of pan, I sprayed with cooking spray, didnt use the cereal, it wasnt necessary, and I added about a tsp of onion powder...very moist, I was pleasantly surprise, because chicken breasts can become dry rather quickly.

This chicken is awesome!  Really easy to prepare, most of the time it takes to make this dish is spent with it cooking in the oven.  My husband loves this chicken.  The rice cereal gives it a nice crunch.  Thanks for a great recipe!  It's now a staple in our house.

We were impressed!  We used 2% cheese and omitted the butter on top and rice crispies.  It was really good.  Thanks for the recipe.

In the words of my dad "This was good, but it's not like there's fireworks" This was just your everyday weeknight chicken. A little better than plain grilled because it was nice and crunchy (I used crunched up Chex) and had some good flavor, but nothing really special.

Followed the recipe exactly. The chicken was very tender and juicy. It was a tad bit bland though. Could use some extra seasonings.

I made this recipe for my husband and he LOVED it! I am one of those wives who makes the same old thing so I decided to search for new recipes. I think I found one that he'll never get tired of. The chicken turned out very juicy and tender and it was so easy to make.

This was the crunchiest most moist chicken I've ever eaten!  It was amazing!  I nixed the rice cereal and the extra butter, but it still turned out amazing!

My entire family, including 3 VERY picky children, loved this recipe. I only added one thing - and that was a sauce. In my house nothing is complete without a sauce. It was a pretty simple white wine/chicken broth/butter sauce that complimented the chicken really well. We also used plain bread crumbs with a generous tablespoon of italian seasoning.  Thanks Judy for the great recipe.

Wow, I couldn't believe this chicken came out so well! I did not have the rice cereal so I just used bread crumbs and extra cheese and it was really good. I ended up topping it off with mild salsa and more cheese right before it came out the oven and I couldnt be more happier! Thank you for the great recipe!

Very delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. Made fresh whipped mashed potatoes for a side. Everybody loved this and had seconds. Next time I’ll double the recipe so there’s leftovers!

Although there are only two of us, I made the whole recipe.  No changes, other than baking on a foil  lined baking sheet to eliminate the 1/2cup butter.   I smashed up the rice cereal a bit, too.   It was very moist.  The next day, I sliced up some for a salad with honey mustard dressing.  Will make it again!

The only change I made was using Crispix instead of Rice Krispies (suggested by another reviewer) and it was fantastic. I reduced the butter at the bottom of the dish to 2 tbsp and it was still more than enough; next time I’ll just use 1 tbsp. And I only used 1 tbsp drizzled on top. I will definitely make this again and try using different cheese mixtures.

This is delicious and I used sour cream instead of egg to dip in the chicken
before putting it in the coating mix.  It kept the chicken very moist because I think boneless skinless chicken breasts can easily dry out.  I will definitely make it again.

I made this chicken. Doubled the recipe both times. It is amazing and is now a regular in our house when we have a dinner party. I scratched the Rice Krispies though. It’s AMAZING!!

This was pretty good, although it really didn't crisp up as much as I would have liked in 35 minutes.  (Might be my oven.)  I did have to make a few changes for what I had on hand.  I used horseradish cheddar cheese (which maybe gave it a bit more kick, but really wasn't spicy), and I subbed in panko for the cereal.  I think I might cut down on the bread crumbs next time, as they seemed to overwhelm the cheese and panko.  I cut back on the salt while baking (for my husband) and added back in at the table.  I'd make it again.

After the first bite everyone was in love! The most juicy chicken any of us have ever ate! I left out the crispies and baked for 45 minutes and it was perfect! I was asked to keep it as a regular meal after just a few bites in!

I make this multiple times per month. The chicken turns out really juicy and flavorful. I do use crushed up Cheez-Its in place of the Rice Krispies cereal, mostly because I rarely have the cereal on hand. It actually works out perfectly with the cheddar cheese. I also use much less butter than is called for. Besides that, I follow the recipe and it is always a hit.

Excellent taste, easy to make, and many of the spices that add flavor can be substituted. The garlic powder is a must and the rice crispy cereal adds a nice crunch.

Loved it! I sprayed the cooking dish with olive oil and only drizzled the top with Brummel & Brown spread (yogurt spread). Otherwise followed the recipe. My picky husband even liked it!

Great tasting stuff! Easy to make.

When pressing the chicken into the bread crumbs and cheese mix, I found that those two ingredients didn't mix very well at all. So the first few pieces I pressed were mostly cheese, and the latter pieces mostly bread crumbs. Anybody found a way to counter this?

I've made this several times. I always leave out the cereal, and it comes out great. It's what I call a weekend dinner since it takes too much time to make after work. I serve it with rice or noodles and a vegetable or salad. Yum!

Very good.  Nice crisp coating.  I rated it 4 stars as it didn't have
much flavor, I couldn't taste any cheese flavor it might as well
not been there.  My family likes and will probably make again.

Excellent. Made this for dinner and everyone agreed it was a keeper.  Made recipe pretty much as written.  I baked chicken on a cookie sheet coated with cooking spray.  I also didn’t measure the cheese. Just poured half the bag in.  It was a 2cup bag the butter drizzled on top added delicious flavor.

Very easy, yet GREAT flavorful chicken is the result! 2nd time making this and I know I'll be making this one again! Next time I'll be adding a little onion powder to the flour mixture and minced onions to the bread crumb-cheese mixture for an added 'crunch factor '. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good, made it per directions. Our breasts were quite thick, took an hour to bake thoroughly. I used 4 large breasts so made 1-1/2 of everything except the egg coating. Thought I would have a lot of the cereal/cheese/bread crumbs left over but I just piled it on the breasts and pressed it on.

No one in my family liked this at all.  We thought it was bland. Followed the directions exactly. I’m not sure what I missed that everyone else liked. I only used the 1/4 cup butter for the bottom of the pan and the top of chicken and it was still to buttery.

This chicken works very well with/for salad. My dad is a diabetic so I really have to watch his portion size, carb/sugar intake. The family enjoyed this as well. Pairs well with roasted potatoes and fried okra.

I saw this was saved  almost 150,000 times from the magazine.  I tried it. Followed the directions and failed to taste anything magnificent.  Plain chicken, baked with cheddar cheese coating.  Blah!

Absolutely delicious, juicy and tender! The only thing I did differently was lined a cookie sheet with foil and used spray instead of all the butter. I used the butter in the end to drizzle it on top of the chicken. Will make again for sure!

As other noted, just use non-stick spray on the bottom of the pan, no need for all that butter. I did drizzle the two Tbs of butter on top and broiled it for a minutes after cooking.

My wife loved it so much the first night she had me make a second batch right after.

This was easy!  I shredded the cheese myself and that was the only "hard" part.  My whole family liked it.  I liked how tender it was because the pieces were thick (halved with a vertical cut not a horizontal cut).

I didn't have the cereal or the bread crumbs so I sutituted crushed seasoned croutons instead. I also had to double the egg and milk mixture to have enough. 
But it was a winner in our house!!!! My boys are seconds.

I didn't put the butter on the bottom (sprayed foil with olive oil).  Bottoms were a little soggy on the bigger pieces, but the flavor was good.  I don't know that the butter would have made it less soggy...maybe more so, but I guess the flavor may have been richer.  My husband and my toddler both liked it, and that's enough for 5 stars in my book!

Quick and easy. The butter added to the chicken's flavor... thanks for that tip! I didn't have any cereal, so my meal was made without it. It was still awesome! I will make it again, hopefully with rice cereal. It goes very nicely with baked potatoes halved w/ cheese and bacon bits (just a suggestion)

Excellent and tasty.  I did this on my grill in an aluminum pan lined with non-stick aluminum foil.  I did drizzle a little oil in the bottom.  I didn't have rice cereal so I used panko crumbs.  This turned out crispy and delicious.  Might bump up the garlic next time.

Everyone in my family LOVED this recipe.  My only changes due to stock at hand were boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts and plain bread crumbs instead of Italian.

Made it again!  Definitely a family favorite.  My husband won't eat breasts because he swears they are always dry so we eat thighs.  Made as described but with thighs.  Cooked 45 min as thighs are thicker.  Came out perfect and even my picky eating son loves it.  Easy to make.  Going to remember more when I have company as I never know what to make.

I made it! I used plain bread crumbs instead and boiled the chicken in water for about 20 mins before baking so it was very tender! I used honey bunches of oats flaked instead of plain flakes ! it was awesome! added extra cheese as well!

I made this recipe pretty much as written, with three chicken breasts sliced in half and baked in a glass Pyrex dish.  I used crushed Crispex cereal instead of the rice crispies, and added sliced Parmesan cheese for some extra flavor. We ate two servings each night for dinner. The first night it was a bit bland, and I wished I had season the chicken itself before coating.  Reheated the second and third nights, though, after the flavors had time to blend, it was tasty+. I'd make this recipe again, but would season the chicken itself for some extra punch.

I used some cheese and onion croutons instead of Rice Krispies, basically for something different. We all loved it, (even the mardy teenager)
Just try it. it's going to be on our plates again soon,

We enjoyed this and will make it again. 

We used panko in place of the seasoned breadcrumbs because that's what we had at home, though I think the breadcrumbs would have been better. We'll also substitute corn flakes for the Rice Krispies due to personal preference and might up the garlic a little.

Overall though, very simple and tasty.

This was delicious and so easy to make my 5 year old was able to help me prepare it. I followed the recipie as written for the most part is but I did not use as much butter. I also used panko bread crumbs instead of seasoned regular bread crumbs because the seasoned ones are just too salty. I used 4 large breasts and cut them in half. Next time I will definately use more seasoning on the chicken and breading itself. That is my only complaint is the chicken was a bit bland but I just sprinkled some creole seasoning on mine and it was fine after that.

Absolutely amazing! This is probably my favorite dish I've ever made! The texture was great (I went 8 minutes longer than the recipe called for). The rice cereal added a good crunch but didn't mess with the flavor. I will be making this again!

This recipe was delicious! It does take some time to prepare but it's definitely worth it. It's very rich and very filling. Our side dishes were rice, green beans, and a salad. I'd make this again.

Only change was to crush the rice krispies somewhat.  To reheat using the oven is essential or they will be soggy

I couldn't find rice cereal without BHT at my grocery so I used crushed organic whole oat cereal that was slightly sweet along with the Italian bread crumbs. Tasted incredible and was even delicious heated up the next day. Will make again!!!

I used boneless chicken thighs and it was excellent!
I also used extra crispy oven fry instead of bread crumbs.
I shared the recipe with friends and family! :)

No. It seemed too dry, although it was the most tender chicken breast I ever baked.

We did use a couple of suggestions that were made by others that the rice cereal wasn't necessary & I used a co-jack cheese instead of cheddar this time.  Next time I'm going to use less butter to coat my baking dish by half & try adding some Italian seasoning to the Italian seasoned bread crumb mixture for a little for umph. This is a easy recipe & a nice change.

It was delicious.  We turned it into a festive meal, as well.  Instead of plain Rice Krispies, we used red and blue ones.

It was delish! I might have flattened the thicker portion of the breast. I did find that I used two eggs instead of one but I also had some larger portions of breast.

Very good - a keeper! The only change I made was to use cooking spray on the top instead of more butter. I cooked it a little too long so we couldn't taste the cheese (until we snacked on the leftovers in the pan), but it was delicious and easy. Thank you!

I hit submit too soon on my previous review. Again, very easy to make. The only reason I gave it four stars is because we felt it was "missing something" in the flavor. My husband says he wanted a taste of ranch or ranch dressing. Next time I may try adding some dried ranch dressing mix to the cereal/breadcrumbs/cheese mix.

I haven't made this yet because I am confused about the chicken. It calls for 3 boneless skinless chicken breast  HALVES - cut in HALF.  
So, do I end up with 6 quartered halves? Is each half cut cross-ways or is each cut through the center parallel with the cutting board?

I used Panko crumbsi did not have any rice crispy so I just used the crumbs. I it turned out great baked for 40 minutes because of thickness of chicken.  I put it in broiler for a few minutes to brown and help crisp.  Was very moist even the next day. I will make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe! However, I didn't have rice kripsies or breadcrumbs on hand so I substituted panko. I also didn't melt butter in the pan. Instead I used a stick of butter and coated the pan (just a thin layer so it wouldn't stick to the pan). I loved it but my picky husband thought it was bland. Any suggestions?

Winner, winner.........chicken dinner.  Great for us folks in a Northern Mid-West climate in the winter that do not grill (but love to!) when it is 15 degrees outside.  Very tasty  and simple recipe.  Whole family liked it.  Omitted rice crispies because I did not have any.  Otherwise stuck to recipe but a little more cheese never hurt anyone.  Recommended!

This was delicious.  The only change we made was to use 1/2 tablespoon of butter in the baking dish, and we omitted the drizzled butter.  Will definitely make this again.

Only changes I made was deleting the rice crispy cereal and using garlic butter instead of butter and I cooked it 40mins, it came out absolutely delicious. Thank you for this recipe, my partner loved it.

Yes, this is good! I did not use butter, I used EV Olive Oil. I used Mexican Cheese Blend rather than cheddar.  I added Red Pepper Flakes to the Egg Wash and regular Bread Crumbs with a little Italian Seasoning. I used skinless boneless chicken breasts. I rinsed them clean and troweled dry; then I rubbed them completely with Olive Oil. I sprinkled Garlic Powder on all surfaces and lightly massaged it into the meat. I dredged them through the Flour Mixture, then the Egg Wash, then the final Crumb/Cereal/Cheese mix. Then I re-dredged them in the last of the Egg Wash and then the last of the Crumb/Cereal/Cheese mix. I used aluminum foil to line the baking dish and used Olive Oil to coat the foil. I baked them at 350 for about 35-minutes. They came out juicy and very flavorful.

This recipe is a little messy (3-bowls) but I cleaned up as I went along. The aluminum foil liner really speeds up final cleanup! We enjoyed these cheddar chicken breasts very much and I'll make them again.

Finally a delicious baked chicken.  I would have given it 5 stars but I did make some changes to the recipe.  It turned out moist, crunchy and delicious.  The leftovers eaten cold are even great.  My husband (who hates chicken and does not cook) loved this recipe.  I even caught him snacking on the leftovers, that never happens with chicken!  

The changes I made:  added 1 tesp. onion powder to the flour mixture,  instead of the bread crumbs and cereal I used Panko bread crumbs and added some garlic salt and oregano, I grated the cheese for a "fine" grate.  

I have made it 3 times now and it turns out perfect every time.  I also used leftovers as chicken parmesan and it was delicious.

I didn't add the rice cereal, and used crushed garlic/ herb croutons instead of bread crumbs;  to which I added Italian spices. I set the timer on the oven  for 35 minutes and walked away....and it came out beautifully.  Very tender chicken and so tasty. Definitely a meal deserving of guests! I will make this again. Slicing the chicken breasts nearly in half makes perfectly sized portions.

Will definitely make this dish again.  Easy and tasty too.  Didn't have any eggs but used enough cashew milk to get the breasts wet and worked out just fine.  Also substituted gluten-free panko breadcrumbs.  Very good indeed.

Followed directions, turned out GREAT. Just make sure the chicken breasts are on the thin side. I had two breasts that were thicker than the others, but the topping had started to brown and looked finished, so I thought they were done only to find the thicker breasts should have cooked longer. Also, don't know if it's just me, but the prep time took a lot longer than I had planned. Yes, I will make again.

My family loved it.  I used nonstick spray on the pan instead of melted butter.  I otherwise followed the directions and did drizzle butter over the top.  The breading was nice and crusty and it stayed on the chicken.  I made this in the morning and it turned out great.  I was worried the breading would get soggy sitting in the fridge but it cooked up fine.   I gave it 4 stars because it was lacking something for me.  I might try adding a little onion powder next time for a little more flavor.  I liked the suggestion of asiago cheese instead of cheddar and might make a couple pieces  with that for myself next time to see how it turns out.

Very good!  Used whole chicken breasts, cooked for 45 minutes, then boiler on for a minute or two as suggested by others.  So cheesy and crunch on the outside but still moist inside.  Will make this recipe again!  Might try splitting the breasts in half horizontally first, then it will likely take 35 minutes.

Absolutely a 5-star winner all the way.  I lined a baking sheet with non-stick foil and lightly coated with a butterery flavored cooking spray.  After breading I drizzled approximately 1/4 cup of melted butter on each piece.  I baked at the recommended cooking temp and time.  Served with wild rice and baked asparagus.  This is a tasty entree that is certain to please any guest.

This is an easy recipe and it didn't disappoint!  I used seasoned panko bread crumbs instead of the Rice Crispies/ bread crumb mixture and they worked perfectly.  I also seasoned my boneless breasts (cut in half lengthwise) with salt and pepper and I also seasoned both the flour dredge and the bread crumb/cheese coating with a little seasoned salt, garlic power, onion powder, and black and cayenne pepper and pressed the chicken firmly in the final coating to ensure good adherence.  I cooked the chicken according to the recipe; exactly 25 minutes, and it resulted in a tender, juicy, and crispy piece of chicken...and boneless, skinless chicken breasts have a tendency to be dry if not timed perfectly.   One final thought; next time I might try a stronger-flavor cheese, as we couldn't really taste the colby- jack in the final product.  Perhaps a swiss or sharp cheddar would give a more pronounced flavor.  
Thanks for the recipe…I will definitely use this one again and again!

There were three bowls of coating to prepare which made it seem much more complicated to make than it really turned out to be.  The chicken cooked up in the time specified and was cooked thoroughly, tender and moist (chicken breasts were about 1" thick). I love crunch so having the crusty coating was perfect for me.  The chicken had a great flavor...however for those who like stronger flavors, this recipe would be easy to modify by using different spices.  I will definitely be making this again.

l followed the recipe almost to the T except I didn't use any rice krispies because I'm not a fan of them so we used some garlic and herb Ritz crackers we had on hand. I also used panko instead of the regular bread crumbs. I think next time I will use some white cheddar and less butter but add some Italian seasoning. Very juicy and tender. Not bland at all like some others have posted. Will definitely make this again!

Perfect comfort food! Chicken was moist and delicious, son even rated it in his top 5 dishes! Made it pretty much to recipe except I didn't have cereal so I mixed 1/2 c italian seasoned bread crumbs and 1/2 c panko. Great idea one reviewer had which I also followed was to season the chicken before coating.  Thanks for sharing, this will be a regular dish!

Family loved it.  I relieved this recipe via email today and decided to make it for dinner tonight.  Turns out I didn't have breadcrumbs so I used crumbled saltine crackers and special K.

I used gluten free bread crumbs and served up string beans with crumbled bacon and rice on side.  Yummy!  Simple, easy to prepare on a work night too.

It was great, U just had to make some extra changes by adding one more egg and more milk.  Also placing on the baking dish on the bottom some mix of the bread crums, cheese.  The chicken does not absorbed the ingredients.  But it came out great.  Will make it again, for sure

This was absolutely delicious.  The only changes I made were due to lack of ingredients on hand and I didn't feel like running to the store.  Instead of Italian bread crumbs and rice krispies I substituted an equal amount of dry chicken stuffing mix.  The crunch of the stuffing mix on the outside was great and the chicken was moist on the inside.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this yesterday with chicken tenderloins.  This had a great crunch, and lots of flavor.  The italian seasoning from the breadcrumbs really helped a lot.  Used colby cheese (had that on hand) and turned out great.  May try sharp cheddar next time for an extra kick.  On the side we made white rice, broccoli and cheese sauce.  Great meal, our 6 year olds liked it too!

Made this with bone-in chicken thighs, since that's what I had on hand.  Family loved it and wants it again!  Even the boys, who can't agree on anything.

I made this twice and both times I have liked it. I made it using marinated chicken breasts the first time and it was flavorful and delicious. I made it tonight using tenderloins and found that without marinating the flavor is barely there. I used honey mustard to dip the meat in. I baked the tenderloins at 375 for 15 minutes. I would definitely use marinated chicken next time. However I definitely enjoy this recipe.

Really yummy and easy to prepare on a busy weeknight. I didn't have crispy rice cereal, so I tried to use crushed cornflakes...big mistake, in my opinion. Either use the crispies or leave the cereal out altogether, there was no worthy substitution! Excellent as written, using lots of basic pantry items. I flipped the chicken halfway thru and let both sides broil for a few moments at the end of cooking. This helped avoid mushy breading and kept everything crispy, even without the cereal. We will be eating this again, for sure!

Just made this for my family and it turned out really well and it was delicious. It looked amazingly appetizing as well which was a bonus to me, I like presentation. I had to bake for a bit longer (chicken breasts were thicker pieces) but it was extremely flavorful and juicy. I was really happy and quite proud as a new stay at home mom!! Definitely try it people!

This came out excellent.  It was juicy and very flavorful.  I substituted panko for the rice krispies because that's what I had.  I just sprayed the dish with canola spray rather than putting 1/4 cup of butter in it.  I did drizzle some butter on top and the chicken had just the right amount of crispness.

I substituted almond flour for the flour and ignored the Italian bread crumbs. We also used crushed Honey Nut Cheerios...this was Delilah. Very juicy and had great flavor.

We really liked this. The chicken is moist and delicious. The recipe makes much more breading than we used, so I would cut the amount in half in the future.

Very moist and tasty, my husband said it was ok, but our 4 yr old toddler liked it a lot and we ate leftovers which tasted just as good.

We really liked this! I had a very nice cheddar block that I used and it baked up with lots of flavor.  I didn't use the cereal but we liked it was and I don't think I'd use the cereal!  We will make this again!

Made it as the recipe says. Chicken was very juicy and cooked well for the time and temp. Don't think it was necessary to buy the rice cereal if you don't have it.

Doubled the recipe and baked at 375 for 45 minutes. I also dumped the remaining cheese and bread crumb mixture on top of the chicken before baking. Entire family loved it! The only negative thing is the amount of dishes that need to be cleaned. That's what kids are for right?

Very good. Chicken very tender. I used mozzarella cheese instead, because that's all I had, and baked for 45 mins. I want to try it with the cheddar cheese next time. My husband loved it , and my skeptical adult son admitted he liked it too.

Excellent! Didn't have cereal, so I just increased the Panko bread crumbs. My chicken breast was very thick, so I added some chicken stock to the pan. Yummy!

Didn't have any rice cereal or seasoned breadcrumbs, so used all breadcrumbs mixed with about a teaspoon of Italian herbs.  Very easy, very tasty, very juicy.  Will definitely make again.

Made this for dinner tonight, with a side of loaded mash & steamed broccoli . I used organic Panko bread crumbs to replace the Rice Krispies (after prep I found a box in my pantry will try original next time) did 45 min instead as well. Chicken was amazing not dry at all.

I made this thinking that it would appeal to even my picky eater and I was wrong. Not only did she not like the coating, but neither did the rest of the family, who will normally eat anything with no complaints. It was extremely bland and I followed exactly. This is one recipe that won't be made again.

Awesome dish!!!! My kids loved it.   I followed this recipe exact except I did not add any cereal.  It was delicious.  I also used half sharp cheddar cheese and half Colby, yummy.   Oh one other thing, I sprinkled the left over breadcrumb & cheese mix over the chicken before baking.  Thank you for a delicious recipe

This was so easy.  I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I took a hint from one of the other reviews and added Italian seasoning to panko bread crumbs.  I also had some parmesan snack crisps so I crunched up about 6 or 7 and added to the bread crumb cheese mix.  I also made a mistake and added the Italian seasoning to the flour mixture as well.  No problem the chicken was still delicious and very moist.

This was seriously good! I followed the recipe pretty closely, although I didn't use the cereal, and didn't feel it was lacking from it. My family always groans when I make chicken ("again?!"), but they ate this happily with no complaints and even asked me to make it again sometime. Highest praise from this crew! Served with a warm baguette and broccoli. I had 5 large chicken breast halves, and baked it for 45 minutes. The cheese was a large shred (as opposed to finely shred) style, and it got nice and crunchy.

This was really good! I did not have rice cereal so I used panko bread crumbs. I also only had about half a cup of cheddar, so I did half cheddar and half mozarella. Thanks!

Triple "E" on this one... Easy, Excellent, and Enjoyed by all! 
I made this per the recipe and followed some of the review suggestions - adding additional crunchy topping with drizzled butter after placement in the baking dish, full size boneless chicken breasts cooked for 45 minutes at 350.   Could be a go-to standby into the future...

This was easy to prepare and delicious. After reading all the other reviews I cherry picked from several of their changes - - I used Italian panko breadcrumbs, halved the breading recipe for two large boneless chicken breasts (about 1.4 lbs total), which I seasoned with seasoned salt and pepper before breading, used Italian panko breadcrumbs and equal parts shredded mild cheddar and deli shredded parmesan cheese, omitted the cereal and tossed in a handful of French fried onion pieces as another reviewer did. I also didn't grease my baking dish at all, but did drizzle 1.5tbs butter over the breaded chicken, which I cooked for 45 minutes (perfect). I had very little breading left over after I added extra to the top and I would definitely make it this way again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really good and easy. I used boneless chicken tenders. Panko bread crumbs and baked it in a glass shallow pie dish. It seemed crispier than the ones in the metal pan.
Good cold but also reheated in a little oil (or bacon grease). This will be a go to for those days when I want a quick easy dinner and know that I have all the ingredients on hand.

Pretty good, I think I would have liked it better if there was more cheese and less rice crispies.

OMG that was so good! And so easy to make. I used oregano and estragon, because i couln't find any of seaseoned breadcrumbs, so my little trick was lemonpepper. I added it to flour and to cheddar. I think that little bit of acid makes this dish a whole different. NB! I didn't use garlic powder, 'cause I couldn't find it at home. ??

I have a picky husband and picky children, and they all loved it! Great recipe. We had a few pieces left over which I put in a salad the next day and that was delicious as well. I followed the recipe exactly, except I only had unseasoned bread crumbs so I added some Italian seasoning to the mix. No need to make any changes with something this good!

This was great, but instead of coating the pan with butter, use cooking spray.  It makes it less greasy and saves calories.

Made it exactly as described and loved it.  We order our chicken in bulk from Zaycon and each split chicken breast is roughly 1 pound!  So, for this Recipie we used 2 lb's of chicken and cut each of the breasts in to 3 parts and then pounded the  thicker sections down  in a gallon ziplock bag so that the thicknesses were all roughly the same.  That kept the cooking even.  Will cook again.

The only change I made was to spray the baking dish with store-brand Canola oil spray.  Oh, and cook an extra 10 minutes. My oven runs cooler. Came out juicy and tender. 
The mix of flavors was surprising and welcome! Will make again!

We both enjoyed this - I used crushed crouton crumbs in lieu of bread crumbs and rice crispies.  Next time I'll add a little more seasoning - maybe rosemary.  And I  might try  pank subbed for the rice crispies.  It will be made again!

I enjoyed the crispy topping but found that the chicken was too gooey on the bottom. I would make it again but I wouldn't dip the chicken in the batter - I'd just put butter on the dish and spice the chicken then put the topping on.

This recipe made the "print it and put it in the recipe box" cut.  Excellent taste, quick, and easy.  The only modification I made was to crush up the rice cereal a bit so it was easier to coat the chicken.

I made this exactly by the recipe!  It was delicious. My husband really enjoyed it too. I didn't add the butter on the top of chicken as I thought there was enough all ready in the baking dish. It was perfectly brown without the additional butter. I plan to make this again!!

I made no changes but it was a lot of grease with the double butter. I am rating it 3 starts because there was no way the last dry  mix would stick to the chicken, even with tons of pressure. Had to put in the casserole and the spoon it on top. The only way it really got crunchy at 350 degrees was to put in under the broiler for 2-3 min.
Flavor was yummy and the chicken was very moist.

I really ENJOYED this!  I baked this chicken breast  the latter part of the evening for the first time and because I was in a hurry, I scanned over the Recipe and just mixed melted butter with some non-salt seasoning, black pepper combined with Panko seasoned crumbs and shredded Cheddar and Monteray Jack Cheese and coated the Chicken Breast!  I had steamed broccoli and caudiflower vegetables with it!  Absolutely delicious - I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN!!  Thank you for such a satisfying Recipe!!!

This turned out absolutely delicious, I followed it exactly as described. My fiancé and his family LOVED it. For the bread crumbs tho, I ended up crunching them all together to make it easier to stick to the chicken. Awesome recipe and it was cool hearing the Rice Krispies sizzling! :) I found that I did have to cook this for an hour because I have an old oven, at 35 minutes for 350 degrees. Chicken was still pink inside and cheese wasn't even melted. The hour was perfect and it was nice crispy and moist inside. Yummy!!!

Had to finagle it a bit due to a lack of cereal and flavored breadcrumbs.  I used plain bread crumbs plus a little Italian seasoning as another person did.  Husband asked what smelled so good when he came in.  It tasted as good as it smelled.  Next time, I may add more cheese, because cheese is my favorite food.

We enjoy this recipe a lot!  I made a few adjustment after trying it as written. I use Panko crumbs, fresh garlic, a sprinkle of dry bones seasoning and added some parmasaen. In addition, I flip it at half time to create a crusty brown finished product. 
Great little recipe??

Absolutely delicious!  This is now my go-to recipe for baked chicken cutlets.  However, I didn't use the rice cereal, as I didn't have it on hand.  Sometimes I cook it at a higher temperature (like 400 or 425) so it cooks quicker.  Also if you have any leftover bread crumbs mixture, I brown them on the stove and add it vegetables or just eat it as is.  If you make this recipe,  you will not be disappointed!

Easy to do (for a novice like me) and tasty. Had Chex around rather than rice crispies, but they worked fine when ground up by hand. I might have upped the Italian seasoning a bit, but this is a good one and I would recommend you give it a whirl.

I altered the recipe a little. I doubled it for a church potluck .  Instead of 1/4 c. Of melted butter I used 1/2 c in the pan to cook and 1/2 c. pour over the chicken..  I also used plain Panko bread crumbs as I do not like Italian seasoning . Baked it for the 35 minutes. It turned out juicy and scrumptious.

Loved the chicken. Very moist. I used tenderloins  and and added additional spices as well.  I found no reason for the cereal,so I adjusted the amount of bread crumbs, for the cheese mixture.
This is a recipe that will be perfect for young and old.  Tenderloins is the way to go with this recipe, so all the spices
And cheese is absorb in the chicken.
Thank You for Sharing

This recipe was so easy and delicious! I didn't have the full amount of shredded cheddar so I used a mixture of cheeses that I had. I also realized I forgot to put in the bread crumbs, which I left on the counter. It still turned out great!! Can't wait to make for company!

Have made this a number of times. Works perfectly every time. Great when you have guests as you can prepare it in advance and just stick it in the oven at the appropriate time.

I also left out the cereal, it still turned out great! One problem I ran into is the bottom got soggy which led to the breading coming off of the bottom. I'm not sure how to solve this. Solid recipe all around!

Loved, loved, loved it.  We all loved it.  This will be made over and over again.  The ingredients are simple but so flavorful. The chicken was tender, juicy and especially loved the tangy sharp cheddar cheese.  I baked fresh zucchini in the same baking dish and they turned out lovely, I think because of the butter on bottom of the pan.  Excellent recipe and as I said, Ill be making this many times more!

This is delicious! A 3 step coating is a little laborious, but the results are worth it! 
I used seasoned panko breadcrumbs along with the cereal & cheese. Skipped the butter in the pan (used nonstick spray), but drizzled plenty of butter on top! Split my boneless breasts in half so I had 2 long pieces. Baked 350 for 37 minutes & they were slightly browned & bubbling! Perfect. Brown bits on the pan were heavenly! I'll  be making this again & again!

The butter made this chicken very moist. It was good but that's all. I don't really get the rice crispy ingredient. They are flavor less. I would definitely use more shredded cheddar cheese if I make this again.  There was 1/2 breast left over, it say in the fridge until I threw it out. So, this isn't exactly a go too dinner.

Didn't use the rice crispies and only had Mexican style cheese at the time, but it still came out juicy and really delicious.  I got a unanimous thumbs up from the family.

Excellent and easy recipe! I did not think the cheese would stick, but it sure did. Looking at other reviews cooking it for 45 minutes instead of 35, I picked a middle choice with 40 minutes and the chicken itself came out delicious and moist, though some of my cheese was burnt (but very little). We had this with a side of rice and loved it.

I skipped the cereal - seasoned the bread crumbs - used olive oil instead of butter to cut down on the fat. I didn't have cheddar cheese on hand, used a mexican blend of cheese from Sargentos - it was delicious.

This is such an easy dish to prepare. It came out great! I loved the flavors. I did not add the cereal because I didn't have any and it was still yummy.  I will definitely make again.

Very good, quite tender. Didn't have crispy cereal, so I used broken up cracker crumbs; was perfect. Also used olive oil spray on the pan and to spray on chicken instead of butter.

This has become one of my favorite ways to prepare chicken in the oven. One of the things I love is that it takes such a short time to prep everything for it and then just throw it in the oven. Couldn't be easier and it's absolutely delicious. The Rice Crispy cereal gives it a great crunch that is balanced by the melted cheese.

Used crushed cornflakes because I didn't have Rice Krispies.   Used garlic and herb cheddar cheese.    Otherwise followed the recipe and it was quite tasty.    Easy and quick to make.   I would make it again.

Loved this chicken.  I did make e changes - I used thighs and legs, almond flour because there are fewer carbs in the finished product and I didn't include the crispy cereal since I didn't have any. But, son who will eat anything and picky eater grandson were both very impressed. I will be making this again.

I will definitely be making this again. I did not follow the exact recipe. I used half parmesan, and half cheddar cheese, but I may increase the total cheese used since I could hardly taste it. Chicken came out tender, with the crust coming out crunchy! Yummy!!

I made this and made some of the changes that others had suggested and this was just okay to me.  I didn't feel there was a lot of flavor to this chicken.  While it was very moist, it  didn't wow me like it did others.  I probably won't make this again.

This is a good recipe but I think next time I'm going to brush the breasts with Italian salad dressing, then continue process with dusting flour, egg then bread crumbs and cheese. I will make again for sure.

It was good, didn't use the cereal, and couldn't seem to get it crispy on the bottom. Any ideas? Great flavor overall. Had a green salad with it as well.

Delicious AND easy! I read the reviews before making this, but decided to follow the directions as much as possible. I did put melted butter in the pan but I don't think it was needed. Also, I pressed the Rice Krispie mixture onto the chicken to try to use it all. The result was delicious. My husband really liked it-crispy and moist at the same time. I'll make this again for my grandchildren because they love " chicken nuggets" so they should like real chicken.

The chicken was very moist, but, mine didn't get very crisp and I wanted more crunch. I could have put under the broiler briefly. Or maybe baked longer,  but I didn't want the chicken to dry out.

Made this last night for my sister and I. The only thing I did different was to spray the baking dish with Pam and added more cheese for the last ten minutes. Must be my oven but it took the better part of an hour to cook to the proper temp. Turned out very juicy, great flavor.

This was fabulous!  My husband could not get enough.  The only change I made was I did not have the cereal or bread crumbs.  I used Italian Panko crumbs instead and used 1 cup.  It was  divine and will be a staple in our menus.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was pretty tasty and easy. Small detail:  WAY too much flour mixture - and since I had rolled raw chicken in it I had to throw the rest out. As for the butter:  OF COURSE I used good ol' natural butter in the bottom of the casserole!

Very good! Followed recipe exactly but for the rice cereal only because I didn't have any on hand, used extra breadcrumbs and crumbled some Ritz crackers. Nice flavor, juicy chicken. Enjoyed with roasted potatoes and a crisp garden salad. Hubby really loved it also.

Made this for supper today and it was awesome. Followed the recipe but didn't add the butter to the pan. Just used cooking oil.  Will be making this again.

I hate white meat chicken.  I usually find it dry and stringy so I will try any recipe that allows me to moisten it up a bit.  This recipe was perfect! I left out the butter entirely.  I sprayed the pan with Pam. I also added a few more rick krispies to the top once I had finished coating it just for texture.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe!! The only change I made was that I used Panko instead of the breadcrumbs and cereal method. I'm going to make this a regular in our house! Thank you!!

I can't believe something so simple is so delicious!  I used brown rice Rice Krispies, but other than that  did it change the recipe.  Will make it again for guests.

I prepared as directed except I left out the butter (I sprayed some grapeseed oil in the dish and didn't put any butter on top).  I also left out the cereal because I didn't have any--but I think the bread crumbs was enough coating for us.  Next time, I would use finely shredded cheese as I think it would stick better. As others did, I cooked for 45 minutes, not 35, on 350°.  The chicken was a perfect 165°.  It rested under aluminum foil for about 5 minutes while I finished up the green beans and mashed potatoes.  Both my husband and step-daughter said they liked it and would eat it again. It was juicy and the cheddar added an extra oomph.

Made this for dinner tonight.  It was excellent.  The crust was crispy, and the chicken really moist and juicy.  I will definitely be making this again.  Easy dinner to make for company, and really delicious.

Great recipe, but I made a few changes. First, I didn't use chicken. I really like chicken, but I already had chicken twice this week. I decided to have dessert instead. So,  I made a delicious batch of cannoli's. 

Hopefully this review falls in line with everyone else who takes a recipe and completely changes nearly every ingredient and slams the original recipe for being awful.

Soggy and bland. 

I'm giving this a 3 only because my husband and daughter liked it. I thought it was quite bland other than the cheddar in the breading. There was just no real flavor. I also found the cheddar breading a bit hard to cut through and that was using a steak knife.

This recipe is a winner! I did increase the amount of Italian seasoning ( 1 tablespoon) and added it to the breadcrumbs. I also used less butter. I sprayed the pan with a non-stick product and melted 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter to coat it.  I split up a tablespoon of butter over each piece and I served it with roasted potatoes and Brussels spouts.

I followed this recipe to the "T."  WOW! This chicken is amazing! Extremely juicy, and the sharp cheddar gives it just the perfect little zing.  The coating sticks to it really well!  It reminds me a little bit of KF Chicken.  Very good.  Will definitely make it again!

This recipe was good, but not a "wow" for us. I made this exactly as written, except slightly reduced the salt. My husband and I both enjoyed it, but thought it needed something more. We ended up just dipping in sweet and sour sauce, which worked out well. I will keep experimenting..

Used panko instead of cereal, no butter on bottom.  Next time dredge in mayo or sour cream first as suggested in earlier review.  Grate frozen butter over top instead of drizzle melted butter.

The chicken was super moist.  I cooked at 350 for 40 minutes, added a few more spices and only used about 3 tbsp of butter - enough to grease the pan and drizzle on top of the breasts - other than that I followed the recipe. The recipe, as written, works out well and my fiance really enjoyed it.  For me it was good but nothing I have to make again right away; it didn't blow my mind so 4 stars.

We will make this again. It only got a three star rating because chicken is not our favorite meat, but it is put in the rotation for health and variety.  I wouldn't make any changes to the recipe, besides the cooking time for us.  Our oven took longer, and we need 40-45 minutes for the chicken to  be cooked.

Made this for my brother and he absolutely LOVED it. Every time I make chicken he's asking if it's this. I didn't have and rice crispys so I added more bread crumbs and a little honey combs (the only type of cereal I had in the pantry). It still turned out amazing though.

I made some changes to the recipe, such as adding about half a cup more of cheese, and a little more breadcrumbs. The garlic taste is very strong and so is the Italian seasoning taste. Great dinner tonight, best when made with some potatoes or another side. I would recommend using more cheese, less breadcrumbs, less garlic powder, and some more milk.

This was delicious.  The only change I made was to add a little lemon juice to the egg and milk mixture. I also added a little parmesan cheese with the cheddar, only because the cheddar I had was too mild.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. My family LOVED it! The baking time is perfect  Yum!

Made this tonight and the family LOVED it! I omitted the garlic powder and reduced the butter in the bottom of the Pyrex dish to help cut out some of the fat and it was still WONDERFUL!! I followed all other instructions. I used about 2 teaspoons  of butter to grease the bottom of the dish and it was more than enough to prevent sticking. I  baked at 350 for 40 minutes and it was perfect!!  Thanks for a tasty new recipe.

I've been making this recipe, as is, for several months now and it never fails!  My daughter is an extremely picky eater and she loves this chicken.  She even requested that I make it for her birthday dinner and it was such a hit with my extended family, that I am now making it for New Year's lunch!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Wowzer. This is delicious. I made it following the recipe exactly. The only thing I might change was to forget the butter on top of the breasts. Either way excellent easy recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

I make a lot of breaded chicken.  I always browned in a cast iron pan on one side turned it over and put in oven.  However
following the cooking instructions(my oven at 385).  It came out
right on.  Since I do a lot of this and have frozen chicken, I usually brine the frozen breast in the frig until I'm ready to cook usually overnight or a least 5 hours.  Didn't have any cereal and did without.  Cheese idea is fantastic to the flavor.  Will try with a gouda or guyee also.  Thanks for a great tip.  I stuck a sweet potato with olive oil on skin in oven
for 60 min as a side

The chicken was soggy on the bottom because of the butter. It was also lacking in flavor, besides the cheese. Also the rice crispies weren't that crispy by the time the chicken was done. I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

We didnt have rice cereal so I crushed corn cereal.  No other substitutions. The chicken was moist inside and very tasty. A little different than my usual Italian style cutlets. I will make it again when we have some crispy rice cereal.

Very simple and delicious recipe. It will definitely go into our rotation. My husband loved it as well. Only changes that I made are that I baked it for 45 minutes at 350 degrees based on other comments/reviews and I also eliminated the butter in the dish (substituted Pam) but I did drizzle a little melted butter on top of the chicken. Thank you for posting the recipe!

Amazing! I used crushed corn flakes because that's what was on hand and used the 45 minutes at 350 suggestion- turned out perfectly juicy and crispy on the outside! I'll be adding this to the chicken recipe rotation!

This is a delicious & easy recipe!  I gave it 4 *s, only because I made a couple of changes.  I used crushed Corn Flakes instead of rice cereal, and I added quite a bit more garlic powder, dried parsley, onion powder, and Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs.... since I noticed that the seasonings have been greatly reduced in the store bought breadcrumbs (even in the 'brand names').  Here's a tip which always works:  Use a meat thermometer.  Insert it into the thickest part of the chicken breast.  Take the chicken out of the oven BEFORE it reaches an internal temperature of 160 deg.  (I take it out at about 158 deg.)  Then, put a loose 'tent' of aluminum foil over it, and let it 'rest' for several minutes (it will continue to cook) and when it reaches an internal temperature of 165 deg. it's ready (and safe) to eat.  I hope this info was helpful.

This is a delicious recipe! The first time I only used cooking spray and the chicken was a bit dry. The second time I used the recommended amount of butter and the product was tender and succulent!

I will certainly be making this again :)

Love this chicken! The only thing I do differently is not coating the pan with the 1/4 cup butter. (Too greasy) Instead I use olive oil cooking spray. Turns out great every time!

I made this tonight for Dinner and it turned out really great! I omitted the cereal because I didn't have any & it was still delicious!! Like others, I did not butter the pan, instead I based it with a small amount of cooking Oil. I was nervous about how it was going to turn out but my boyfriend LOVED it And so did I. Luckily I made enough for leftovers Tomorrow!!

I made this last night for my hubby and it was a huge hit! He loved it so much he took leftovers to work today to share with his coworkers. :) What I did different: I didn't have the bread crumbs or rice cereal on hand so I improvised and used Ruffle potatoes chips and seasoned croutons. I smashed them up real fine and added Italian Seasoning and the crust came out both beautiful and delicious! Also, I hate flavorless food so I separately seasoned my chicken, as well as followed instructions in seasoning the flour and it was perfect. Finally, I also added more cheese on top towards the end of the baking, then turned on the broiler for just a minute or two to make it all a bit crispier. Will be making on a regular basis for sure!

This is an awesome recipe! I followed it exactly except for the cereal as I didn't have any on hand, and I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked the dish for 45 minutes at 350. We had friends over for dinner and he is a very picky eater and ended up going back for seconds. Everybody cleaned their plates! So good!

I didn't have rice krispies so I used corn chex. I also didn't have bread crumbs so I chopped up croutons. We have an 8 year old that will literally eat 3 things and he LOVED this. Our other 4 children enjoyed this as well!

I made very few changes. Instead of using plain bread crumbs, I used a half and half mix of Italian with Garlic and Herb Bread Crumbs. Also, instead of using regular cheddar cheese, I grab the triple blended pack. It really gives it just the perfect blend of herbs, spices, and flavor! The chicken just melts in your mouth.

Followed this exactly except for the rice crispy cereal (I didn't have any on hand). Could have used more cheese, but other than that, this wasn't that bad. My family enjoyed  it. Will make again with lots of extra cheese!

I made this according to directions except I did not have croutons so I substituted the cereal and added Italian seasoning. It turned out nice and crispy on top when I baked it for 45 minutes as others suggested. I used 3 chicken breast, filleted and cut in half. It was not soggy on the bottom as others mentioned. My family loved it! Will definitely make again.

I made it to the recipe the first time and it was wonderful. All the times after that I changed up the recipe a bit. I used 2 packs of chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, and added much more rice crisps, bread crumbs, butter, flour, and a few more spices than listed. It came out so juicy and delicious they are practically inhaled by the family.

Very moist and delicious. I did not have rice cereal so I used Ritz crackers. I had to bake it longer before the chicken was cooked through.

This was great. I didn't have crisp rice cereal so i crushed Cheese Nip crackers and left out the pepper. Next time I think I will add some Italian seasoning and maybe some bacon bits.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. The chicken was perfect, I didn't have rice cereal so I opted for some crunched up dorritos with homemade italian breadcrumbs. I will make again.

Amazing chicken recipe the family gobbled it up!!! I did cut the chicken into smaller peices, more like quartered each piece and it gave us alot more chicken also I cooked it for additional 10 minuets. I honestly wish I had cooked it for another additional 5 mins. the chicken was cooked but I wish it was cooked a little better, we like ours more well done. this was med, to med well. no pink but it was still not like I like it. also added a little more butter. not much another 1/4 melted...

This was very kid friendly - and pleased the adults too.  My chicken took about 45 minutes until it was cooked all the way through, but otherwise I made no changes to the recipe.

This was very good!I had to double the egg wash mix. I pressed the remaining rice/cheese/bread crumb mix top of the chicken after I was done rolling chicken in it. Then I topped with melted butter. I used twice the butter suggested. I wasn't sure whether this was covered or uncovered, so I covered it for 30 minutes (until chicken reached 150 degrees), then I uncovered it and let it brown until it reached a safer temp to eat. Moist, flavorful, and paired nicely with steamed carrots and potatoes.

As my kids would say "Winner, winner, chicken dinner". This came out moist, crispy, and flavorful. For once, I actually followed the recipe just as written. It was easy, quick, and best of all, made with things that I usually have in my house anyway. I would agree that you probably could cut down on the butter if you wanted, but you leave a lot of it in the dish when you take the chicken out, so I wouldn't bother to cut back and risk losing moisture. If I changed anything, I might cut back a little bit on the salt, but we don't use a lot of salt, so we may just like things less salty than most people. Really good chicken. Got requests from my teen-aged boys to make it again, so there's the real endorsement.

Quite yummy. 

I didn't have cereal so I substituted croutons (garlic & herb) because I figured it would add enough crunch and still fit with the other flavors. I also had to cook it for 45 minutes like another reviewer said, but I had very thick chicken breasts so that was probably a factor.

It has nice crunch, the flavors mix well, and the chicken remained juicy and yummy. My only complaint would be that it's not overly seasoned...I'd probably add in more spices next time. I don't think that's the fault of my croutons because if anything that should have added more seasoning flavor.

Excellent!! Made this tonight and it was a huge hit! I was told I must make again! I will say though I didn't have the rice crisp cereal, but I just added a couple of crushed Ritz crackers and toped it with some extra shredded cheese when it was done.

This is my husband's favorite chicken!  I bake for 25 minutes  covered with aluminum foil, then I take the foil off and bake for another 35 minutes.   Still crispy but tender!

Not very happy with this recipe.  I made a couple of minor changes, I used Panko instead of rice krispies and I did not use the butter, following other recommendations.  It was bland and dry. I cooked it at 350 for 35 minutes but it was still dry. If I make it again I will probably season the chicken along with seasoning the flour.

Just made a batch, and it was awesome! I used bisquick instead of flour and it turned out amazing! I haven't tried the flour, however I would highly recommend using pancake batter or something to the effect. It really brings out all the flavor. I also added a tablespoon of sugar to the bisquick, salt, and pepper concoction. Great recipe!!

Made this tonight and it was a hit! My family loved it! Another way to make chicken! Thank goodness! :)
I used ritz crackers and the rice krispies since I didn't have the bread crumbs and still turned out great! I also sprayed my pan with coconut oil first!

This chicken was yummier than I expected! I didn't use any crispy rice cereal b/c I didn't have any. I used panko Italian bread crumbs and I did add my seasoning to the chicken, not the flour. I sliced my chicken breast into two so my chicken breast were thinner and I decided to roll my breast after I coated them in everything. I baked in my toaster oven on 300 for 40 mins. Then for another 10 mins, b/c some of the thicker pieces looked a little pink. I also did melt a little bit of butter in the baking dish and added some cut onion, then put the chicken on top. I also had extra bread crumb cheese mix so I just put it on top. Only thing I think I may change next time is to make thinner slices of breast and season a little bit more.

YUM! This was incredible! Quite possibly the best, most amazingly moist chicken that Ive ever cooked! The only thing I would change next time is to omit the butter from the bottom of the dish. It softens the crispy batter. I served this with Qiunoa & Black Beans & Skillet Corn, both other recipes from this site. I will definitely be making this again.

So delicious. My 3 kids never like the same thing at the same time, so dinners are a challenge with usually at least one of the 3 complaining. Not with this! My 3, 6 and 7 year olds loved it.  Pretty much followed the recipe exactly. But everyone tweaks a bit. I added some onion powder because I love that with chicken, but doesn't take anything away from this recipe. It is perfection as is or spiced differently. This will be a weekly meal at our house. Would give more stars if I could.

Great way to fix chicken for just the family or for company!  I made some changes, just using what I had without heading for the store, and was really happy with the results.  Used buttermilk instead of the egg mixture, mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar, and left out the cereal.  Plus, I took another reviewers advice and baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  So good!

My family Loved this recipe and we are not baked Chicken fans, until now. I made two adjustments to the recipe. I first marinated the chicken in Italian Dressing. Second, I added some Parmesan Cheese in with the bread crumb mixture.

Okay, I wasn't sure about this recipe because I can never seem to get breaded chicken breast to cook up crispy in the oven. But it turned out great! The flavor was fantastic and it was very crispy! I coated my baking dish with PAM and my bottom crust still stuck but that's okay! It was still good. I added a few extra sprinkles of cheese on top of each breast and that really helped give it a golden brown crust on top. I took the advice of some other reviewers and baked mine for 45 minutes which I think was too long. It dried out the chicken just a tad. This was a very good weeknight meal and my husband loved it! Nothing but oohs and ahhs at the dinner table tonight!

Oh my goodness this was so wonderful!!!!  Best baked chicken recipe I have ever made.  So juicy, a bit crunchy, and delicious!  The ONLY addition I made was to add 1 tsp. of onion powder to the flour, slat, pepper, garlic mixture.  A+++++ to you, Judy, this was a HUGE hit at my house! (And I have 3 boys - 1 very picky and a husband who is very picky too! =-D)

I must say, this was quite tasty.  Besides doubling the recipe for my large and super hungry family, I let the recipe as-is.  I didn't see any instructions to cover the chicken before baking, but in my experience, uncovered chicken equals dry chicken.  So, I put foil over it until the last few minutes then removed the foil to finish it up.  It came out great, and I will be making this again (maybe I'll bake it without the foil next time and see how it goes).  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This turned out great! I crushed up garlic-herb croutons and used some panko as I didn't have Rice Krispies. The chicken was super moist and tasty with a crispy crust. Perfect! My husband loved it and the leftovers went to work with him the next day.  You can really change up the flavor by using different cheese or spices. This will be a go-to recipe in my house.

I made it gluten free. I used rice flour instead of all-purpose flour and just left out the bread crumbs. It was wonderful.

It was very good. As others have suggested, I will cut down on the butter in the pan.  The flavor was great.  I am wondering if I could eliminate the flour step and mix the seasonings with the cheese and bread crumbs. This recipe is a keeper.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe except instead of rice cereal I used corn flakes since that's what I had. Very flavorful. Will make again.

This is the best go-to recipe. The chicken is so tender,juicy and flavorful. I didn't have the cereal on hand so I substituted ritz crackers, which Turned out fine. This is a fail proof recipe.

This is my first rating, and I'm so glad it was this particular recipe to set me of on the right foot!  My wife tends to "stick to what you know". I wanted to start with something simple and mild in flavor, but savory. This was an absolute hit!  I only changed a few things. I didn't have the cereal or the bread crumbs, so I crushed some Ritz crackers.  Also, I don't have a rack to use in my pan, so I only coated the top side of each piece of chicken. This eliminated the gooey mess on the underside. Yum, yum, yum!  Some garlic broccoli on the side and a bit of pasta salad, and we had a great dinner together! Thank you for my first recipe, as it will now be a new part of our rotation!

My husband has always been the chef in our home and has high standards.  Now that he is a cardiac patient and must follow low-sodium and low-fat rules, I find that I need to step in and step up.  This recipe is pretty good.  I did not not cut the breasts in half, and did fine with 350 for 40 minutes (convection style) and then low broiler for 5 minutes.  I might go ahead and try cutting them next time so we aren't waiting so long to eat the meal.
I didn't have rice cereal on hand.  I had canned bread crumbs on hand, both plain and seasoned: the sodium is way high.  What I used instead was my own concoction of AP flour, ground flaxseed, panko crumbs, and some crushed whole wheat crackers that had been sitting around and whose sodium was lower than the regular bread crumbs.  I added my own dried herbs and crushed them with mortar and pestle.  The chicken itself I seasoned generously with garlic powder, very lightly with crushed pink himalayan salt, and fresh ground black pepper.  In the glass casserole dish, I used high quality unsalted butter and smeared a thin layer to coat the bottom.  I did melt some of the same to drizzle on top.  
With it, I served a blend of couscous, quinoa, and veggies that came in a steamable bag in the frozen section.  I fully expected my husband to hate every bit of it.  We were both pleasantly surprised that it all turned out a rather delicious meal that we could feel good about.

Very good and tasty!  I didn't have Italian seasoning or Italian breadcrumbs so I toasted two slices of bread and crumbled it in a blender, then blended in most of the cheese and Rice Chex. I heated the baking dish with butter in it while the oven warmed up to temperature and reserved the 2T for drizzling on top of the chicken.

Yuuuuummmmm!!  I used whole, brined chicken breasts to make this, so mine had great flavor all the way through.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe except for the rice crispies (didn't have any).  And since my chicken pieces were thick, I cooked for an extra 10-15 minutes.  I didn't even mind that the butter kept the bottom from crisping.  I enjoyed the different textures.  Good stuff!

Wowsers those was good. Made as directed but I think next time I will cut down on the butter as this was certainly not very healthy for you.  That is probably why it was so darn good. :)

Double Wow!  This was a family hit!  My kids wanted seconds.  The crunch of the baked cheese with breadcrumbs, and the butter flavor was excellent.  Although I didn't add the rice cereal the chicken came out just right and super juicy!

This was great! i changed a couple things, like i used onion powder instead of garlic, an i didn't have cereal so i crushed up some whole wheat ritz crackers. I cut the chicken breasts in half making thick tenders, and 35 mins was a perfect baking time. These came out with so much flavor and were moist. My husband loved them and wanted them the next night too!

I had this recipe all ready to go in the oven-(so easy to prepare- I used 8 chicken thighs) and when I turned my oven on it had broken and wouldn't heat. I had to quickly recover since I had company for dinner so I stuck it in the microwave using the tried and true 6 minutes per pound on full power for chicken. It was done in 12 minutes and was wonderful. My broiler broke too but in a few minutes more that would have crisped it up perfectly. Can't wait to try the recipe as written but it was super in the microwave too!

Mmmm, had them for dinner again last night... for the hundredth's time. This is everyone's favourite. My husband never stops talking about it during dinner cause it's so good. I love the crunchy cereal and the seasoned bread crumbs. You get the crunch of deep-dried chicken, without the fat! So healthy and yummy. We make this 1-2 times a month!

I had 3 very large chicken breast halves left over from a larger package I'd bought at Costco so I baked them almost one hour and they came out great.  The prep was quick and easy.  They looked like a picture.  Better yet, they were delicious.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Delicious! I didn't have the rice cereal so i omitted it and added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning to my plain bread crumbs. I ending up cooking it 40 minutes. One thing I especially loved is I could make sure that the chicken got up to 180 degrees and it was still very moist. It is going into the rotation. Easy and good.

Absolutely brilliant!! :)  Would definitely use a little less butter on the bottom but apart from that I wouldn't change a thing.  I put the rest of the cheese/RK/breadcrumb mixture on top before drizzling with butter too ... made it lovely and crunchy on top.  AND I only had the Christmas RKs and it looked so pretty!!!! :)

I'M IN LOVE!  This was so good that I was dancing around while eating it.  :-)  I too had to stray from this original recipe only because of what I had on hand and with below zero temps outside I was NOT going to run to the store, no matter how close it is.  My differences were the following; I only had boneless, skinless chicken thighs – it was still outstanding, I didn't have any milk so I used 2 eggs, I used Garlic & Herb bread crumbs, used sharp shredded cheddar, didn't have crispy rice cereal so I used a little extra bread crumbs and cheese, I sprayed Pam on the bottom of the baking dish instead of melted butter and I did as some others suggested and baked at 350 for exactly 45 minutes.  OUTSTANDING.  I want to make it again tonight.  Haahaa!

My family loved it! My son has been bored with our usual fare so I have been trying new recipes. This will absolutely be made again. I didn't have the crispy rice cereal but it was awesome with just the bread crumbs and the cheese. Yum!

I use crushed Cheddar and sour cream potato chips in place of the crispy rice cereal when I make this chicken dish and it IS delicious. However 1/2 chicken breast half is only 1/2 serving of chicken.

I followed the recipe almost to a "T". I took some of the reviewers' ideas in just spraying the dish, not adding butter except a little on top. I only added about 2 tbsps. Also, I only had plain bread crumbs, so I eye balled how much Italian seasoning to the cheese and breading mixture. It turned out really good! Very tender, juicy and still crunchy. Little to no sogginess on the bottom. Will def make again.

I tested this recipe on my parents, they absolutely loved it! I made mine in a 9x13 pan and put 1/4 cup of melted butter. I don't think that you need as much as they say. I also didn't put as much on top, you do need a little bit of butter on top though so that the crust isn't dry. I would definitely recommend this!!

I made a few changes. I sprayed with cooking spray instead of using butter. Sure that you don't sub the rice crusties, they make the best coat EVER! If you plan on doubling this recipe it is not necessary to double any of the coatings. Overall I love it!

My whole family liked this!  The only "complaint" was that the portions were too big.  I did not use the rice krispies because I did not have any, but I loved that the other ingredients were basic enough that I generally have everything on hand on a regular basis!  I will definitely make this again!

This really packed a TON of flavor!  I baked mine on an oven rack so the bottom would stay crispy.  I also threw it under the broiler at the very end for about a minute to make sure the top was golden and super crunchy.  Loved it!

Love this. It's my new favorite. So easy, just prep and put into the oven; no fussing over dinner while company is visiting. I have also swapped the cheddar cheese for Havarti with dill and it was yummy that way, too.

Great recipe.  I had didn't have the rice cereal so I followed the directions exactly other than that.  It was very easy to make and delicious.  My husband LOVED it.  Next time I'll try it with the cereal too.

I made this dish for dinner tonight, and we all really liked it. The chicken was very moist, and it looked as good as it tasted. The only changes I made were to spray the pan bottom with olive oil instead of butter and skipped the cereal and the drizzle of butter. I baked it an extra 5 minutes to get more browning. I served it with cheddar and bacon scalloped-style potatoes, and steamed broccoli for a variety of color and texture. I will definitely make this again, but I think I will try adding Italian seasoning and additional garlic powder for more flavor.

We all loved this (me, hubby, and 3 year old daughter). It was so tasty and easy! The only changes I made were that I subbed Olive Oil for the butter and used whole wheat flour instead of All Purpose. The chicken was so moist and the breading was so delicious.

This was good, though I changed it a little to use what I had on hand.  I used crushed up cornflakes for the crust instead of puffed rice and I used olive oil instead of butter.  It turned out great, very tasty :).

Made this last night for my picky teenage daughter and husband.  My husband is picky because he is a great cook himself, and often does the cooking in our household.  My daughter is picky because she is used to my husband's great cooking.  Ok - now on to my review of the actual recipe!!

I made this recipe pretty much as is - with a few exceptions.  I did not have the cereal so I made it without the cereal.  I increased the breadcrumbs to make up for the missing cereal (I just did this by site - not measurements).  I used italian seasoned breadcrumbs - rather than plain.  I forgot to cut the chicken breasts in half - darn it!  So, it took about 45-50 minutes to cook and that was my daughter's 1 complaint - that her chicken was too thick.  I did not pound them down at all because they were still a little frozen (next time I'll make sure I do this).

Overall - plates were clean and my daughter liked the taste of the chicken.  It turned out nice and juicy as most reviewers mentioned.  I will try this again.  However, next time I will try with the cereal (if I have it) and I will try baking it on a rack to alleviate the wet bottom (although it was very good that way too).

Thank you for the recipe - we enjoyed it!

Mmmmmmm!  The first time I made this, I followed the recipe as written.  The next time, with some experimenting, it was even better!  I melted margarine and cheddar cheese to dip the chicken in, and left it to marinate for 10 or 15 mins.  Baked for the recommended time, 30~40 min at 350.  So easy and delicious!

Delicious with only 1 slight change, lowering the butter. Very easy.  A nice change of pace.

This is my favorite chicken dish!  The only thing that I changed was to leave out the salt and the garlic powder, (it did not need it).  You can also use different types of shredded cheese, I like to use colby jack.  Everyone loved it, including my picky eaters!  I have given this recipe to several friends and they have all loved it!

This recipe was so easy to make and it was such a hit!  
The only thing I would maybe change is to go easy on the butter!
The chicken was so moist and the breading was crispy and flavorful!

I'm not generally a fan of baked chicken but this was a pretty good dish. I used olive oil instead of butter and it worked perfectly with a lot less fat and calories!

Made according to recipe minus the cereal since I didn't have any.  It came out good and the breading tasted great, but did fall off when I was cutting it.  Will make again since it was simple and easy and I have the ingredients in the house usually.

Easy and tasty!  Was looking for a quick chicken recipe for dinner and this hit the spot.  The fiance loved it!  I didn't have Rice Krispies so I subbed corn flakes, and I did without the butter to lighten it up a bit.

This makes the most delicous smell in your house! The chicken is so tender but crispy it is amazing.  I did make a few minor changes though. I didn't have italian bread crumbs so I just bought cheap ones and added 1/2 a cup of grated parmesean cheese to them. I had finished the rice cereal for breakfast so I used cornflakes instead.I also crushed them up a little just to make better texture. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was VERY Good my son asked me to make this every night for dinner.  My only complaint would be that the breading fell off on some pieces but maybe that was my fault somewhere a long the lines.

This did not turn out well for me.  I omitted the butter to save calories  on this dish, and it was a mistake.  The chicken was dry and the bread crumbs were still in thier original form after 45 minutes of baking - dry and crumbly.  I followed the directions exactly during the flour, egg, bread crumb steps but the coating came off the chicken as I tried to cut into it.  Disappointed, but might try one more time with butter.

This was a winner!  Family loved it including my parents,and brother in law who I had over for dinner.  Didn't use rice krispies though becuase I didn't have them. Also used Pam on the bottom of the pan as per the advice of others.

This was soooo yummy.  I made it a little healthier by cutting out the butter completely.  I used a little olive oil on the bottom and nothing on the top.  I used reduced fat cheddar and a little bit of Parmesan.  I also used BROWN rice crispies.  i added a little bit of bread crumbs to the flour mixture too.  absolutely fabulous and moist and yummy and oh so good.  will definitely make again.

We tried this last night.  We didn't have breadcrumbs so we made our own using slices of bread, Italian seasoning & worked great.  We skipped the butter since a lot of other reviewers said it wasn't really needed.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was good and the breading stayed mostly crispy.  There was twice as much flour and crispy coating as needed.  Splitting each breast into two pieces was extremely helpful.

I'm only giving this a 3 star because while it was good it was bland. Needs more spicing up next time and 40 min was to long for my gas oven. Be sure to use Pam or butter in the pan first or  the cheese will get hard and stick to the bottom very badly. Also if you use thin breasts be sure to lower the cook time.   I haven't given up on this recipe.

Meh. Allright, I guess.... My fiance thought this was "OK," but I can't say I agree. This was quite bland for my palate. I even added 1/4 c. grated Parmesan cheese to my cereal (I used Rice Krispies as directed) mixture and a t of onion powder to my flour mixture. Still blah. To cut some of the fat, I melted 2 T margarine instead of the 1/4 c. / 4 T butter called for. I did, however, still use the 2 T melted (butter) drizzle on top. Because my cheddar bay biscuits (Cookie) baked at 375 degrees, I ended up baking my chicken at this temperature also (I was concerned that adjusting the baking temp for the biscuits would yield poor results). I decreased the baking time to 25 minutes total and my chicken was SUPER moist! I found the coating to be “oddly” crisp. It reminded me of reheated breaded chicken. There was a slight crispness, but it wasn’t good. On the flipside, clean-up was a breeze. I mixed my flour / seasonings in one large Zip-lock bag and my cereal mixture in another. As a result, I only had to dirty one bowl (for the eggwash)! Served with buttered corn, long grain & wild rice and Cookie's biscuits, this was a decent meal. I just don't think it will be a repeat in my house (sorry!). Maybe this will float your boat???? Thanks for sharing, Judy. :-)

If your looking for chicken with a bit of a different twist, this is it. My only complaint, I should have made more. Thanks Judy.

This is a big hit every time that I make it. The chicken is very moist. I use italian crutons instead of the bread crumbs and its much better! Everyone loves it! Great Recipe!

very interesting concept and ingredients, but somehow it turned out! only thing i did differently was spray the pan with Pam but i think if i used butter it would have browned the bottoms nicely and given it nice crunch. will make again

I didn't have Rice Krispies, so I used crushed Crispix. Even though my husband was offended by the cereal and wouldn't try it, everyone else loved it. My six year old ate his and his dad's, so we didn't have any leftovers. Great recipe.

Made using whole wheat flour, only 1/2 t pepper and no butter.  Sprayed the bottom of an enamel baking dish with cooking spray.  Cooked 40 minutes for 2 medium sized chicken breasts.  My breading didn't stick to well after cutting into it but that's ok - I just scooped it up with each bite of chicken :)  Very good for a quick weekday meal!

My whole family approved.  Tender and tasty.  As others recommended, eliminated the butter and sprayed the pan with cooking spray.  Cooked for 45 minutes for thick pieces.

Excellent.  My whole family loved this easy to make chicken.  I made it exactly according to the directions except for the cooking time.  I left it in the oven for 45 minutes versus the 30.  Next time I make this I will make it with asiago cheese just to see how it comes out.  I bet it will be good!!!

This was really awesome!! It was juicy and tender, I did tweek the recipe a little to make it gluten-free. They make a GF crispy chicken flour mix and I used that in place of the flour and the results were delicious. Thank you

I wanted a quick and easy baked chicken recipe and this was good. The only things I changed was that I used 6 thighs, and panko instead of cereal because I didn't have any and I didn't use any butter because I figured I didn't need the extra calories. I also didn't have garlic powder so I substituted garlic salt but didn't use a whole tsp. I then sprayed my glass dish with Pam. The flour mixture made quite a bit and the leftovers seemed wasteful but oh well. The one egg+milk didn't seem like it'd be enough to coat all the chix but it was, just barely. I had to make a little more of the panko/cheddar cheese because I was running short. Not very difficult though. Overall it was definitely moist. It could've used a wee bit more flavor but the kids enjoyed it and I'll make it again. Thanks for sharing!

I fixed this for dinner last night and it was GREAT~~  I didn't have Italian Bread Crumbs, so I used Panko Bread Crumbs.  I used 4 Chicken Tenders (they were really big pieces of chicken) and still had plenty of the dippings left over.  I will keep this recipe on my fix again list~~  Thank You For Offering It~~~

How good was this?!  We loved this recipe and will be adding it to our favourites.  The only thing we did differently was add a wee bit more cheese (you can never have too much cheese)!  Thanks for this great recipe.

Great Recipe!!  I used Greek Seasoning instead of garlic powder, and a combination of Chedder, Mozzarella & Coby cheeses--all together equaled 1 cup.  Plus I made my own greek seasoned bread crumbs.  My family loved it.   The leftovers tasted great with a little cream of chicken soup spooned over!!

We loved this recipe. I made very few changes. I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder and salt, and I eliminated all the butter to cut down on fat. Cooking time was a little longer then 40 minutes, but it still turned out juicy and delicious. Thanks so much for sharing!

I've made many dishes from the recipes on this site but never felt compelled to leave a review until now. Except for the omission of the butter coating on the bottom of the pan (used canola oil spray instead) and the rice cereal, I followed this recipe to the letter, cooking it for the exact temperature and time stated. By the time it came out, the kitchen smelled divine and my husband - who usually has to be called to the dinner table a few times - bounded over eagerly. Our first bites elicited moans of delight and the only other sound heard was the crunch from the perfectly crispy coating (who knew you could get that from baking instead of frying?). This is a delectable dish that earned me a lot of props without too much effort!

I LOVED this. Chicken came out very tender, with crispy topping. Added extra cheese at the very end so it would be more 'gooey'. Will definitely be making this again.

I pounded the chicken breast, and used plain bread crumbs since that's what I had on hand. DELICIOUS! I would make this one for company. I couldn't believe how tasteful it was for so few ingredients!!

good, moist chicken with nice flavor.  After reading a lot of the reviews I cut the butter in the bottom of the pan to 2  TBS and it was fine.  I also sprinkled extra shredded cheddar on top as another reviewer suggested.  I was amused as I put it together as the Rice Krispies started "snap, crackle, popping" as I coated the chicken!  My husband was hoping the cereal would make the chicken coating even more crispy but still said the recipe was a keeper.

It was good...almost too rich, though.  I might use less butter in the bottom of the dish next time, but that would be the only change.  It was a hit!  Chicken was very moist.  Served with green beans and 'Easy Rice Pilaf'.

Very tasty!! Loved the cheddar cheese mixed with the breadcrumbs and rice crisps! Also, the husband liked it VERY much so now I have something new to feed him! 35 min was perfect for the cook time. Great easy recipe I will continue to use!

Great!  I put 2 tablespoon melted butter on the pan instead of 4 and put 1 tablespoon of butter on top of the chicken breasts.  I made no other changes.  There was a lot of the flour mixture left over.  I would propose making it with less flour-I did not use it all.  Great recipe.

Pretty good! I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand, so went without that and didn't put butter on top either. I baked it for 40 minutes, but probably could've used another 5.  Out of 2 picky kids, 1 ate it, the other didn't. Very easy!

This was a good dish but I didn't use any of the butter that the recipe called for since we are trying to watch our fat intake.  I sprayed the bottom of the pan with Pam and also sprayed the tops of the chicken.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  I imagine the chicken would have been much more flavorful with the butter.

Oh....my.....God.  This has to be one of the most delicious meals I have ever made!  Days later, my family is STILL asking me if I have any more.  I made this chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes.  What a combo.  You HAVE to try this chicken!

I made a very large pan of this thinking I would have leftovers for another day, and boy was I wrong.  Every single piece was gone...not even a piece to take to work the next day.  I will make this again in a heart beat.  It's very easy too...

This was wonderful. Even my picky son went back for thirds! The only changes that I made to this recipe were to leave out the butter on the bottom and sprayed it liberally with PAM and cooked for 40 min. I will definately be making this again.

This was incredibly delicious and so quick and easy!  Follow the recipe exactly and DO NOT forget the butter - I think it is key.  I served with mashed potatoes and French-style green beans.  Definitely a keeper that I will make again and again.  LOVE IT!

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I didn't have any rice krispies so I used Ritz crackers I crumbled in the food processor instead.   I also didn't use butter, mostly because I forgot.   The flavor was a little bland (probably b/c of the missing butter...maybe?) but the chicken was still very moist.  The breading also didn't stay on at all, as soon as we cut into it, it fell right off. I followed the breading instructions completely, so what did I do wrong

Easy to make, and tasty too.  I liked the crunchy texture of the bread crumbs, cheese, and rice krispies.  Next time I may add extra cheese to the coating!

This is really really good! It was a little too salty for me though I think maybe leaving out the melted butter on top would have taken care of that! Very good and easy will make again!

We love this recipe!!! Love it! We were out of crispy cereal and bread crumbs, so I ground up some croutons and it turned out heavenly! I also had to cook it for 40 minutes! Goes great on top of a salad!

We enjoyed this dish tonight.  I baked it a little longer than directed and next time I won't put in so much butter.  Yummy on a chilly fall night!

Update... I used Panko instead of Rice Crispies and liked it even better.  I still recommend less butter!  Yum!

Excellent flavor!  I used Panko Italian bread crumbs and enjoyed the crunchy coating and 6 chicken cutlets.  There was plenty of coating for all 6 pieces of chicken.  A keeper!

Delicious!  Even my picky dad liked it!  Only change I made was to add a little monterey jack cheese in with the cheddar.  I will definitley be making this again, it will probably end up on my rotation!  Thanks!

This turned out very good....I didnt use the butter in the bottom, just Pam spray. It came out very juicy with a crisp outside. My kids even enjoyed it.

This chicken is fantastic!!  My sister made me try it and I was skeptical at first - it was like nothing I'd ever made.  It turned out great the first time and every other time since.  A couple of things that I added to the recipe - when I mix up the flour mixture, I add more garlic, some cayenne pepper and some blackened seasoning.  It's not spicy, it just gives it more flavor.  Each time I've made it I try some new spices in it and it always turns out great.  I also use Italian bread crumbs.  I, too, spray the pan with cooking spray, but I like the butter on top, so I always do that.  This is a great simple, delicious recipe.  Thank you!

I wanted something different and easy for a picky family. We just ate this dish and it gets two thumbs up.  I made a double batch and cut the pepper quantity in half and used frosted flakes for the cereal.  VERY good...yummy!

This was really good!  I followed other reviews and omitted the butter on the bottom of the baking dish and just coated it with Pam.  I also sprayed the top of the chicken with spray butter instead of drizzling the butter over top and added 1t of onion powder.  Baked for approx. 40 minutes and it turned out delicious - juicy with a crunchy top.  I think next time I will increase the amount of black pepper and salt.

The kids really enjoyed this.  I omitted the rice cereal only because I didn't have any.  This turned out really greasy due to the butter and cheese in this recipe.  However, if I would have used the rice cereal, maybe it would have turned out better and soaked up some of the mess...?  I will try again including the cereal.

Dirtied a lot of dishes, but it was very good. It still turned out okay without any butter at all, but I think I'll drizzle a little on top next time. We ate with a baked potato and broccoli.

I really liked this recipe although I thought there was to much butter. My husband and I both ate 2 pieces (which equal one chicken breast) so not sure how you can get 6 servings out of this recipe. Will cut down butter next time.

YUM!  The only changes I made were to cut out the butter (used cooking spray instead) and the cereal (didn't have it) and to use my homemade parmesan chicken mix instead of the seasoned bread crumbs.  I also added 1 tsp of hot sauce to the egg white mixture.  I used this with turkey breasts and they were awesome!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Didn't really like this recipe.  The family liked it, said it was good.  I thought the flavour was OK but because of all the butter on the bottom of the pan the bottom of all my chicken breasts came out soggy!  I won’t make this again.

This was very good.  I only used 1/8 cup of butter on the bottom, and didnt have the cereal.  So instead of 1/2 cup of bread crumbs I used 1 cup.  I also added a bit of onion powder to the flour.

This was THE BEST!!! So...I'm broke and I had to use what I had on hand. Instead of Cornflakes I had to use Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I told my husband in advance we might be going out for dinner cause I didn't know how this would work. I baked for 30 min and broiled for 5. He took one bite and said "You could make this every day of the week and I'd love it." My picky eater husband has never had a clean plate! He did this time. Thank you so much!!!

This is my favorite thing to make! Just based on what I had on hand the first time I made it, I don't use as much cheese as is called for, and I skip the cereal.

This reminds me a bit of a shake&bake recipe.  It was really easy and I must admit, the texture makes it so delicious.  I definitely think I will need to make this with my 9 year old brother when he comes to visit this week.  No doubt he'd get a kick out of chicken with rice crispies!

This was very good! I don't think all of that butter was necessary and I would probably not coat the dish in butter next time, maybe just some cooking spray. Still, it was very moist and tasty!  My kids and husband loved it!

Used the olive oil spray instead of butter in the pan, but otherwise followed directions using brown puffed rice cereal.  Everyone loved this.  We'll be making this again and again.

WOW, one of the best chicken recipes on here. My husband and 1 year old loved it! The chicken was so moist and the cheddar was just the right amount; not too overpowering. I did let it cook about 15 mins longer than suggested.

This was delicious and super easy.  I didn't have rice crispies so I crunched up some townhouse crackers instead and it was grand.

I really liked this recipe, and so did the company I had over that night. The only thing I did differently is to put the chicken in the broiler for a few minutes to make the cheddar/breadcrumb topping crunchy and crispy. I also used a garlic and parsley seasoned breadcrumb mixture instead of the plain kind. Will be making again.

Excellent chicken!  I added more spices to the flour mixture to kick up the flavor.  I also subbed Stove Top stuffing for the cereal, I just crushed it up finely.  And I used mozz cheese instead of cheddar.  Excellent, and we will have it again!

This recipe was very good.  I didn't put the butter on at the end (followed reviews and thought too much butter as well).  Came out great! I will make this again.

This was really good.  I was a little leery at first, but decided to give it a try.  My husband and kids love it.  I followed the direction on everything except cheese.  Since my family LOVES cheese I added more.  It is now a family favorite.

I made this for the in-laws and my family and it turned out amazing!!  I coated the chicken in a sour cream and ranch seasoning mixture instead of the egg.  It was tender and extremely flavorful. Great recipe!!

this was a pretty good recipe...I tend to like sauces with my chicken so maybe that is why I'm only giving it a 3.  Still very tasteful though.

My husband loved this dish immediately.  I didn't use the butter in the bottom of the baking dish just a non-stick spray.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is in the normal rotation at my house.  I made it for a friend that just had a baby.  She has two older kids and was thankful that someone was making something "kid-friendly" and not a casserole that was still suitable for adults.  For the kids I pair it with homemade mac and cheese and a veggie.  ALWAYS A HIT!!!

This recipe is awesome! very pleased! i did take the advice of others & added extra seasoning(i'm one of those people that just throw in a lil bit of it all) i also baked it for about 10 minutes longer. this is a very easy meal to make. i was worried about the outside being mushy but i wasn't & it was even good when i heated the left overs up for lunch the next day! i will definately make this again :)

WOW!!  Great recipe!! I made this just thinking it would be an easy chicken recipe that my son would like. I ended up being blown away! The only thing I would change is not using so much butter in the bottom of the pan...other than that FANTASTIC!!

Despite all of the rave reviews, I thought this to be just ok. I didn't like how soggy the bottom got, but maybe baking on a bakers rack would help that. The chicken was moist and the flavor was pretty good though, although if I make again, I will use fresh garlic instead of the powder.

I'm not a big chicken person but this sounded so good so I had to try it. Let me say it was a huge success in our house. Even I loved it! The only thing I did differently was try the Panko bread crumbs in place of the rice cereal. I also used chicken tenderloins instead of the chicken breasts. I scattered shredded chedder cheese over the top so it was all melty. The chicken was nice and moist inside and cheesy on top. Excellent. I'll be making this again!

This is what I call a "keeper" - reading the other reviews, I think next time I will use sour cream instead of egg and milk and Panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs - also, I didn't have chicken breasts so I used bone-in thighs with the skins removed - worked excellent with those also, for 45 minutes at 350 degrees

THIS IS A FAVORITE IN OUR HOUSE!!! We make it at LEAST once a week now, with my Mom's mashed potatoes recipe as a side. I use the leftover rice cereal/cheese/breadcrumb mixture that fell off the chicken when covering it and pat it on top of the chicken in the baking pan. I then cover all the chicken in the baking pan with extra cheese (we love cheese). IT IS SOOOO DELICIOUS! *ALSO* I do not use Italian Bread-crumbs, I've never really liked those- so I bought Panko plain bread-crumbs and first used them for this recipe and that is what I now use for everything.  This recipe deserves 10 stars!!! Thank you!

Husband loves this recipe and he's not a big fan of chicken breasts. I didn't put butter in the bottom of pan per other reviewers suggested and it still turns out great. Also, didn't have crispy rice cereal so I crushed Special K cereal and used that.

We really enjoyed this! The only change I made was to eliminate the butter completely, I just couldn't in good conscience add 3/4 stick of butter to something that already had a cup of cheese in it, lol. I sprayed the pan with non stick cooking spray, then with spray "butter," and also sprayed the chicken with spray butter before putting it in the oven. I thought this had great flavor, and I'd make it again.

This is one of the best baked chicken I have tasted.  I have a Chef Service (providing dinners on a nightly basis).  I made this chicken, served with Seasoned Potatoes and Green Beans.  My clients raved and have requested this chicken dish be included on my monthly menu.  It is definitely a winner!

We eat chicken several times a week, so I'm always on the lookout for something different. I didn't have any crispy rice cereal, so I used roughly crushed Ritz crackers and this still turned out nice and crispy. Because other reviewers thought the chicken lacked flavor, I floured the chicken and added the seasonings to each piece to ensure it had more spice than flour. I also added some cayenne pepper, and am happy I did, because it gave it that something extra. I also used nonstick spray on the bottom and drizzled butter on top, per other suggestions. My picky 4-year-old gobbled it up and my husband thought it was good too.  I will definitely try this again the next time I have rice cereal on hand and see how it turns out. Thanks for sharing!

My whole family LOVES this recipe.  I have made it a few times now and it is a hit each time!  I used Crispix once (as I thought it sounded better when I saw another user did this) and the second time I used Captain Crunch - now THAT was GOOD :)!  My 11 yo eachs every bite and asks for seconds!!

This was okay.  Blandness was the problem my family had with this.  We will try again adding some spices-maybe some chopped jalepenos or something like that.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy recipe and yummy.  For the crispy cereal, I substituted panko (Japanese bread crumbs).  Although they are "bread crumbs" they are the perfect small size and crunchiness that you would get from using a cereal, and they stuck the chicken well.

Excellent!!!! My whole family loved it, next time I have to double the recipe because they all wanted seconds.  The chicken was so tender and juicy.  It had just the right amount of flavor and very easy to make.  I will definitely be cooking this again.

This was a family favorite. My husband is very picky and had to please. I prepared this with au'gratin taters and spinach. Wow from my 8 yr old. I eliminated the cereal and I don't think you need that much butter. This will definitely be included in our family dinner menu.

This recipe is terrific! Made a few adjustments due to lack of ingredients. No bread crumbs, so I used matzo meal w/1 tsp. Italian herbs; used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 provelone cheese and to add a little "zing", 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper. Delicious!

I Really enjoyed this recipe, unfortunatly my husband didn't. I did what someone else recommended. I used plain bread crumbs and added Italian seasoning.  I baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  Thanks

Great flavor!  I added 1 teaspoon of cumin to the flour mixture.  Instead of using the cereal and bread crumbs, used Panko Break Crumbs (found at any Asian foods store or section of your local grocery store).  Thought it improved the recipe 100%!!

As a family we enjoyed this dish. I used 4 chicken breast and halfed everything else, and it was plenty to coat all (with the exception of the butter, which I used all recommended in the recipe to spread over the chicken breast, which worked out well).  I would highly recommend this recipe.

Very good. I used turkey breast filets and left out the cereal (I didn't have any). I also left out the egg and just used milk (also didn't have eggs). The turkey was VERY moist and cheesy. Like many others, I also reduced the flour mixture by half but used the full amount of everything else.

Love it...even though I messed up a few dishes preparing..it was easy and tasted great.  I will probably add more seasoning the next time since we love spicy food.  I give this a A+ hubby loved it too which is awesome since it's easy to prepare and can be done after work for dinner! Thanks!

I found this recipe and thought I would give it a try. It sounded easy with hardly any ingredient, yet it was a 5 star recipe. I had my doubts. However, I made it last night and it was really good. The chicken was so tender. I will definitely be making this one again.

EDIT: i used a tablespoon of butter to butter the dish and a tablespoon over the top of 3 peices of chicken. this was perfect for us. very satisfying; way better than "Best Chicken Ever" from this site and basic enough to replace it. i replaced the cereal with 1/2 c. more Italian breadcrumbs and 1/2 c. plain breadcrumbs. i also added about a t. more garlic powder than called for. next time i will use less butter -- i don't think it needs that much! i paired the chicken with simple green beans and some left over brown rice. good stuff!

I sent this recipe to my husband on a whim and he made it for dinner that very night. We served with Parmesan angel hair pasta and both thought it was great. The chicken came out moist and tender and the combination of bread crumbs, cereal, and cheese was just right. Definitely a keeper that will become a regular in our rotation.

Very good...did not use the rice cereal due to the fact we did not have any and did not plan on buying a box just for this. Also, we used chicken breast tenderloins so some of the pieces were a little smaller and ended up somewhat dry. The larger pieces were juicy and crispy. we did not use butter to coat the pan simply sprayed with nonstick spray. Also, for the next time I think we would add some cayenne pepper to the flour mixture to give it a little kick!

Super Yummy-the Kid was over the moon and says its the best chicken she's ever had.  Very easy, great recipe to have for easy crowd pleaser nights.  I doubled this recipe to freeze leftovers for an easy "re-heat" night in the future.

Yummie! I made these with chicken breast strips instead of breast halves. I did not use the crispy rice cereal because I did not have any on hand. I also added a few pinches of onion powder and they turned out delicious! The only thing is I highly recommend having a dip for these, I did not have anything to dip them in and even though they were really good I felt like something was missing. I gave them 4 stars and my husband gave them 3. I will probably make them again.

This was very good. I simply followed the recipe (except I baked for 45 minutes) and the chicken was very moist and tender and had a wonderful crunchy/cheddar flavor. I served with Rotini noodles and broccoli - YUM!

My family and I liked this chicken, though next time I would use less butter in the bottom of my pan. There was too much and it made the bottom of the chicken too soggy.

This recipe tasted great and was so easy, I had all ingredients on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I crushed up the crispy rice cereal a bit.  The chicken came out very moist -not dry at all.  I baked it for about 50 minutes because the chicken breasts I used were still partially frozen.  My kids ate it all up.  Will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

Very easy to make and tasty meal. I made it with my three year old son and it was quite fun for him to help and helped to get him interested in eating it too. I found 40 minutes was the perfect amount of time to bake. Will surely make this one again!

This was really a good recipe. A lot of times I try things and something goes wrong but tonight my chicken was really good! I did not have bread crumbs so based on other reviews, I tried goldfish crackers (I have them for my kids) crunched up w/the rice krispies. In addition to adding a tsp of onion powder, I also put a dash of paprika and parsley in the flour mixture, not sure if it was okay to do that but didn't make it taste bad. I was pretty liberal with the cheese too so I think that made it tastier. My chicken was very moist. Just used 3 boneless/skinless breasts. I used one egg (some said use 2, not needed for me) and everybody was right, the flour mixture is more than needed. I would probably have put half the flour in next time. I had lots of the cheese/cracker left over and just poured it over the chicken. I put Olive Oil in my pan to begin with, probably too much though (maybe about 2 tablespoons or so). The bottom was a tiny bit soggy. The butter had poured down there too and made it more soggy. But it was still okay, at least the top did not get too crispy/burned. Overall a great recipe for something (at least for us) a little different.

Very good chicken. I didn't have any cereal, so used some crushed crackers instead. I will definitely make this again. Using the thermometer to make sure the chicken cooked through was a great idea. Wonderful.

What an impressive recipe!  I was a bit wary of the "crispy rice cereal" portion but it is a must have to make this so wonderful.  My boyfriend and I are fighting over the last 2 pieces.  Hope our love outlasts the recipe...

This is a fantastic recipe and it's fine exactly the way it is.  I double the egg/milk dip, and then use 5 boneless breasts.  The reason I'm writing this review right now is because I think it's very creepy that I made this for dinner tonight, and when I opened the Allrecipe.com web site just now, that's the recipe featured on the home page.  Did someone put a camera in my kitchen?

This was good, but I added 1 tsp onion powder per other reviewers, after putting together I sprinkled on more breadcrumb/cheese/cereal mixture and then sprinkled the 2 T. melted butter on top to help it stick.  I still like more flavor, so I might add a little more seasoned salt next time.

This was a great recipe. My family loved it. The only thing I did differently was I ground up the cheese and the cereal in a grinder, I left out the butter and at the of the bake time I put on the broiler for a bit to brown the crust on the chicken. It was great!

I had a tough time making the cereal and cheese stick together nicely. We had to scoop everything together so the flavors mixed. I will try some of the other reviewers' ideas and see if it gets better. Overall, the flavors were nice and chicken was moist.

This was a wonderful recipe. I substituted finely crushed Italian flavored croûtons for the bread crumbs and sprinkled more cheddar and croûtons over the chicken before putting it into the oven to add an extra bit of crunch. I served this to two hungry college girls and three even hungrier college boys, and should have made more so that they could have seconds!

My DH made this for supper tonight and it was fantastic!  He made a few minor changes though; first he added garlic powder to both the flour (about 1 Tbsp)and bread crumb mixture (about 1 tsp).  He also added about 1 Tbsp of onion powder to the flour mixture.  The only other changes were that he crushed up the rice cereal and reduced the amount of cheese to about 1/2 cup (we used three small chicken breasts).  The end result was very moist, flavorful chicken.  Too bad there are no leftovers!!!

Loved it!!  I used non-stick cooking spray instead of the butter.  And just topped each chicken piece with a dap of butter for flavor.  It was great.

Great recipe - My husband really enjoyed this one!! I didn't have any of the cereal on hand so I omitted that part and added the onion powder. It came out very tasty. Will definitely make again.

Good recipe.  I found it similar to others on this website, which however, are somewhat easier to assemble.  But no complaints, actually -- I will keep the recipe & use again.

Loved it!  Juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outtside.  I also added some onion powder.  My husband and step daughter loved it.  It may not be fancy, but it's quick, easy, rather tasty.

Great, moist & flavorful chicken! I added some onion powder & cut the butter in half (for a double recipe I used 1 T. in the bottom of the pan & 3 T. to drizzle with - I doubled the chicken & used 2 eggs, but didn't need to double the dry ingredients - it was the perfect amount for 2 lbs. of chicken! My family loved this dish!

After reading the reviews I was looking forward to making this. I thought it turned out "OK" but nothing spectacular. The chicken did stay moist though. My husband who will usually eat anything didn't care for it at all. He made fun of me all night for putting cereal on his chicken. I may try it one more time with different spices.

I made this recipe with chicken breast tenderloins. I'm always nervous to use chicken breasts bc there is such a fine line between moist chicken and dried chicken bc I'm scared of undercooking it (thus always end up overcooking it).  So - tenderloins are the way to go for me. I took the suggestions of others and added the onion powder as well.  Chicken tastes great.  Easy meal to make.  I served it with my favorite side dish - HEB brand chicken rice! Also some green giant asparagus and I also baked some garlic cheddar biscuits.  It was a fantastic meal and since the ingredients are always readily available (except the cereal - I just omitted it) I was able to make dinner for three for under $10.  That's always a bonus!

This recipe my husband loved.  I followed the recipe as is but used a high fiber cereal that I chopped up in the grinder instead of the rice cereal. It had such a good taste to it and it wasn't dry. I'll definitly make this one again.

This came out much better than expected!  The coating is yummy and really seals in the juices so the chicken comes out nice and juicy and flavorful. Watch the baking time though, I used thin pieces of chicken and it only had to bake for 30 min.

Very tasty chicken!  I added a little bit of onion powder to the flour mixture and it had very good flavor.  The outside was crispy and it was very tender.  My husband told me I'd have to add this recipe to my weekly routine.

This one is a keeper.   I've made it with whole chicken breasts, and also as a chicken bite for a fondue party.  Very popular.  I loved the crisy rice cereal it was certainly a surprise ingredient.

This was ok. It was very juicy, but a little bland. I will use cornflake crumbs in place of the crispies next time, and maybe add a little pepper & garlic powder to the cheese mixture. My husband did not like it. My daughter did!

This was a great recipe, but I felt it was begging for a sauce. I searched this site and found the perfect sauce in the Chicken With Jalapeno Cheese Sauce recipe. I had a 2 cup bag of Monterey Jack & Cheddar and used 1 cup for the chicken and 1 cup for the sauce. I'm glad I made this chicken, but I'm thrilled I found the recipe for this sauce. I think it will be great on other things, too, like stuffed flounder.

Yum!  My husband runs a fine dining restaurant and said this was good enough to put on the menu!  Like another review suggested, I put it on broil for the last few minutes to make it golden and crispy.  Thanks!

This was pretty good. Only used three large breasts cut in half. This was plenty of food for my family of five even with three teenagers. Had a lot of left over crumbs and cheese and threw it on top as directed. Cooked it too long and it got a little dry but was still good. I bet this would be great with asiago cheese instead of/or in combination with the parmesan.

This is THE BEST recipe ever! I needed a recipe one night for dinner, found this and whipped it up in no time. It is so easy to make because I already had everything at home. My husband and I devoured it all within 10 minutes! Since yesterday, I've given this recipe out to 4 friends already...I will definitely be making this again

This recipe was great.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, because my family prefers dark meat.  The chicken was really juicy and flavorful.  It was even good the next day when I microwaved the leftovers for lunch even though it lost its crunch.

What a delicious and juicy recipe!  A little fussy, but totally worth the effort.  The recipe tasted fine as is, but we learned you have to actually pat the chicken into balls with the 3rd mixture.  Otherwise, the cheese & toppings won't stick, and that's the best part!  You don't really need all that butter, either.  We used Pam to coat the baking dish.  I would probably bake at 400 for 30 minutes next time.  This seemed to take a little longer.  Served with rice & steamed broccoli, yum!

Turned out excellent, I added a little chili pepper in half the batch to give it a little kick. But I will for sure make this again.

The breading had a good taste but it wasn't as moist as I expected.  Next time I may try using the recipe to make chicken fingers.

This meal was a huge hit!  We used ranch for dipping sauce and the only change I made was that instead of butter we used cooking spray to cover the dish.  I will add this to the meals I make!

I halved the chicken & forgot to halve the coating ingredients. Then I mistakenly mixed the flour with the other coating ingredients. And I forgot to put in the garlic powder, so I had to sprinkle some over it before it went in the oven. Still managed to turn our perfectly crisp, cheesy & moist. I used a locally made dill cheddar. I made a sweet/sour sauce from red plum jam, honey mustard, & butter and drizzled over it before serving. Husband couldn't believe he was eating rice krispies on chicken! We loved it!

Excellent!  I used plain bread crumbs and then gave them a shake or two of Italian seasoning. The chicken was very moist and very yummy. I added some extra cheese near the end of baking. Both of my toddlers gobbled it up.  Served with rice and green beans.

My nine year old daughter had fun making this dish.  We cooked it in a well seasoned iron skillet so there was no need for the butter in the pan.  It was crunchy and the chicken was moist and tender.  Daddy was well pleased!

Not as crunchy as I thought it would be, but still tasty. I'll try again and not use bone-in breasts.

Chicken was good. I did not put melted butter in pan.  I sprayed the pan instead.  I would also cut the cheese, bread crumbs & cereal in half next time.  Had too much left over.
