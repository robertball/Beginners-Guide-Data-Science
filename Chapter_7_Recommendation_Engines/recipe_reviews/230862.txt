This was the yummiest and easiest dinner we've had in a long time!  My daughter is allergic to dill, so we omitted the pickles and used the sweet corn salsa from Trader Joes instead.  We also topped with shredded cabbage and shredded cheese - yum!  Oh, and we have some leftovers for BBQ tuna sandwiches for lunch tomorrow.  Great recipe for kids too...thank you!

Maybe there were just too many flavors happening at once, but this was not the tastiest thing I've made.

Total time says 15 minutes but then cooks notes state 10 minutes. No biggie but those totals should match. Normally when making tuna I add dill relish instead of sweet so that seemed right and my BBQ sauce of choice is loaded with celery seed to that worked too. Seems like an odd combo of ingredients but it worked for me. If I could make one suggestion, I think it could use a sprinkle of cheese. I also would have preferred this with corn tortilla as in a regular hard crunchy taco shell or tostado shell but I am partial to corn over flour tortilla so maybe that is just me.

it was just okay.  It is missing something-- can't  really put my finger on what,  but I will  make it again.

Very tasty, quick and easy to prepare. It is very good on the tortillas. I'll be making this again for sure. We'll be trying it on salad greens.
