I am not able to give it all the stars since I modified the recipe quite a bit. I did not have the called for "cooking cream" and I was serving the rice with already prepared "Panko Chicken". I prepared the rice (brown rice). In skillet I heated 1T grapeseed oil, 1T soy sauce and 1 tsp tamari (to sub for the teriyacki), added garlic saute for 30 secs. Then added the carrots and snow peas cooking for 3 mins. In mixing bowl i beated 1 block cream cheese, 3 heaping T nonfat plain yogurt, 1/3 c veg. broth with mixer, using wisks to smooth it out, then I added to skillet. I stirred in remaining soy/tamari mixture, blended well then added the cooked rice. It was delicious on its own but eating with the chicken was phenomenal. We had chives ready but forgot to garnish. Point is don't fret if you don't have cooking cream...its easy enough to create your own concoction.

The sauce didnt complement the veggies, fish or rice. I cant even think of a way to fix it except to use a completly different sauce.

Yuk. Can't tweak it; it's that bad.
