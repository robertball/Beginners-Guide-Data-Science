Are these awesome?  Yes they are!  So much so that I'm perplexed at the small number of reviews.   They'll be in our Christmas candy lineup  from now on and probably many other occasions as well.  :)  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I accidentally ground a larger amount of pecans than called for, but the excess amount exactly matched the amount of required almonds so it seemed like a no brainer to use all pecans instead. I used a 70% cocoa Smooth Dark Lindt bar for my dipping chocolate.  It took a a bit longer to set up than almond bark, but the results were worth it. Thanks for sharing this great recipe Michele!

These are fabulous!  Used Baileys with caramel added.  Having a hard time waiting for the chocolate to dry, I've already eaten two of them.  Covered with dark chocolate.  Thank you for this recipe!!!!

From 12/27/12: These were great, even though I screwed up. I accidentally doubled the Greek yogurt that I used for the sour cream and had to add more of the cookies, nuts, baileys, etc. I kept them for a few days in the fridge before making the balls and freezing them. The dipping (my first attempt ever) went better than expected. I only had trouble when I tried to streamline it and toss a few balls at a time in the chocolate. Of course, they started to melt, so I went back to one at a time. They hardened pretty fast and I was able to "patch" any holes by dabbing my spoon of chocolate on them. I used homemade vanilla wafers and this worked out fine. I could only find semi-sweet chocolate for dipping but it was still good. We love dark chocolate so I was disappointed that I wasn't able to use it, but will find it for next time. I made half a batch (until the mistake) and used about a pound of almond bark for dipping. There was some left over but I had nothing else to dip so used it up by stirring in some cashews and dropping by spoonfuls to make nut clusters. :)

I'll definitely make this again. I made a few adjustments only because I didn't have all the items in the recipe on hand. I used 0% Greek yogurt to replace the milk, one box of Nilla vanilla wafers (after crushing) didn't quite give me the required cups, so I made it up with Oreo cookie crumbs, and lastly I was a bit short on Baileys and made it up with Harvey's Bristol Cream sherry.  I tried one (after rolling and refrigerated) dipped in chocolate and it was heavenly. I stored the undipped ones in an airtight container in the fridge that I'll dip in chocolate and take to the pot luck Christmas tea partly in a couple days. Next time I'll make sure to have all (and enough of) the right ingredients on hand. I'm sure it'll be just as good, or even better.

Yes, loved these. We needed more chocolate to dip them in but others wise quick and easy.
