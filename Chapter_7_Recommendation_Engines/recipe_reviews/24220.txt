I will give this five stars just because my friends who love very sweet drinks loved this and they had a couple of them. They were a tad bit sweet for me though. Next time, I might add some fresh squeezed lemon or lime juice to cut the sweet and serve them over ice to keep it really cold. Thanks for sharing Sex on the Beach LOL!

I have made this version since the recipe was given to me in college by a bartender. It is an amazing drink!
