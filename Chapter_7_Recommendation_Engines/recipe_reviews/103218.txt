I've been looking for a good stir-fry recipe and this one was awesome!  I  will double the amount next time so that we have left overs.  I think I'll add some mushrooms to it also.  Yummy!

This is an easy recipe that's really tasty. I used frozen stir fry vegetables instead of fresh though. Next time I might add more soy sauce and some other spices to give more flavor. I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

this was really good, i followed the recipe exactly, except i eyeballed the soy sauce instead of measuring 2 tablespoons (after fighting the oyster sauce i didnt feel like fighting with that little spout on the soy sauce bottle lol).  it was a little thick after the corn starch mixture was added but still very good.  next time i might do it without the cornstarch and maybe add some ginger to it.  i used canned water chestnuts and just used the water i drained from the can for the 1/2 cup of water, added the sugar and pepper to that then poured it into the skillet.  might also cut down the pepper a little bit next time because it might be too spicy for some people, just pepper to taste.  very very good recipe with a lot of tinkering potential, but also great as is.

Very tasty, very easy and quick dish to make. My Asian family really liked this and I will definitely be adding this to our dinner rotation.

The only change I made was in the amount of soy sauce and oyster sauce used. This will of course depend on personal preference, but my husband and I often feel that the Chinese food served at restaurants in America is too salty/strong. I grew up in a Chinese family and actual Chinese cooking is milder. So when marinading the chicken, I used only enough soy sauce and oyster sauce to generously coat the meat (I did not measure, but am sure that it was less than what the recipe called for), and let that sit for approx. 20 minutes. The flavor came out perfectly for us -- strong enough to enjoy the chicken and veggies but not overpowering to the point where all you can taste is sauce.

I will never buy frozen stir fry again! I added carrots and mushrooms instead of snow peas, and I added about a teaspoon of Sesame Seed Oil to the marinade (recommend!). I was very skeptical when I smelled the oyster sauce, but it really added such a great flavor to all of the ingredients!

I jused only 1.5 Table spoons of corn starch and added 1 Tea spoon of minced ginger and this recipe rocks! Made it again with shrimp and it tastes even greater!

Great flavor! I will be making this again.  Only change I may make is to use a little less cornstarch.  It turned out a little thick for me.

There is nothing disgusting or problematic with this meal, but it wasn't particularly interesting or flavorful. Just simple, basic stir fry. Also, the 10 minutes of stir-frying the chicken prior to even adding veggies is WAY too much. I had a hunch that was much too long so I did about 5 minutes before adding the veggies/liquids, and even that dried the chicken all the way out. The chicken is cooking about three times longer than it needs to.

Stir fry doesn't get any easier than this.  It's pretty basic.  I'm not sure I liked all of the pepper in it, but my husband said that was his favorite part.

Great recipe for a chinese food beginner. Easy and tasty. I added fresh ginger for a little more flavour.

Wow, this is fantastic!  It tastes just like takeout!  Thank you so much for saving us money by being able to make it ourselves.  A note on the leftovers: the cornstarch will make the sauce into basically "ooblek".  No matter how much I reheated it I couldn't get it to turn liquid again.  Still, mixed and mashed into the rice it still made great leftovers.

I made this recipe as-is and it is very good.  A good basic go to recipe for a simple stir fry.  I added additional spices to taste.

My husband and I just made this last night. The only big change we made was to omit the cornstarch and extra water because while we were cooking, the sauce was tasty and thick enough. It was really quite a tasty dish. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Very tasty yes but I wouldn't label it 'authentic Chinese restaurant style'. 
I also used far less cornstarch going by experience and incorporated more veggies. Will make again thanks.

This is a great base recipe for stir fry! I tripled the sugar and made it brown sugar (better tasting) and added 2 stalks of chopped lemongrass (HIGHLY RECOMMEND for enhanced flavor). I used the vegetables I had on hand:  parsnips, carrots, shallots, zucchini, green pepper. This recipe mades oyster sauce actually taste ten times better! ;-)

Great recipe, but instead of peas and chestnuts I add red, yellow, green bell peppers and broccoli. I think it works better...looks much nicer and all the textures and different flavors of the peppers make it a dish to die for.

To save the veggies from a squishy death, here's what I suggest:
In 2T water, steam broccoli and snow peas in large skillet. Remove from skillet. (I use the large bowl I will eventually serve the dish in). Allow skillet to dry over heat. Add oil to skillet, and stir fry marinated chicken until cooked thru (about five minutes). Add onion, garlic, ginger (if used) to the skillet. stir and cook. In a measuring cup, combine water, pepper, cornstarch, and pour into skillet with meat. Stir over heat until thickened. Add back in vegetables. Stir until heated through. Serve with rice.

Loved this recipe!!!  I made my own lil  changes with low sodium soy, canola oil, mushrooms, carrots, broccoli and a lil bit of sliced cabbage.  I also added some smart taste thin spagetti to it cause my husband suggested it.  I did cut down the cornstarch like others said to.  I will be making again soon.  It was an easy recipe and it turned out amazing! Everyone in my household liked it.

This was really good.  I forgot to add the sugar & pepper, but it wasn't missed.  Also, didn't add the water chestnuts because we don't like them.  Next time I will add ginger & mushrooms.

Doubled the sauce(including water) to make Lo-mein .. Turned out good- added ginger-but.... It was kinda "rich"- don't know if it was the extra thick oyster sauce I used or what- next time I will not double the sauce I will just add a little more water and not oyster sauce and use extra cornstarch--   My 10 year old son lovvvved it!!! Of course adding 12 oz. noodles makes a meal that would feed a small chinese village--  yum!!! leftovers!!!!!!

This was awesome! I used the veggies I had on hand (carrots, bok choy, regular broccoli, mushrooms). I didn't have oyster sauce so I substituted with mostly soy sauce, a little fish sauce, rice vinegar, 2 tsp sugar, and 1 lime). The Lime really pulled it together as the combo of fish sauce, vinegar, and sugar was a little weird.  I cooked the chicken with the garlic, then added the mushrooms until done then followed the recipe for timing. Wasn't much water in the skillet so I ended up adding 3/4  cup in all, and only 2 tbsp of cornstarch.  I didn't have water chestnuts of almonds but it was still great!

i am going to guess that it all depends on what brand of oyster sauce you use.. we get the cheap stuff from the dollar store and it tends to be salty.. i ended up using 1/4 c of it and 1/4 c of low sodium soy.. i used a little less than 1.5 lbs of chicken thighs.. subbed carrots, mexican squash, bell pepper, and mushrooms for the chestnuts, snow peas, and broccoli.. left out the cornstarch slurry and it was still pretty thick from the oyster sauce.. served this over white rice which balanced out the salt.. ty for recipe

I think the 3 tablespoon cornstarch is overkill... it 'gelatinized' the remaining juice of this dish... :(

I'm sorry I'm not that great in adjustments, so I stick to the listed ingredients...

Overall, this recipe is very tasty. Only thing I would be aware of is that the cornstarch makes the sauce much like a gravy. And although it didn't taste much like take-out like I was hoping, my family still loved it and it was super easy to make!  Fried rice is a great addition to this meal opposed to plain white or brown rice. I will definitely make this again with less cornstarch.

We really enjoyed this. I don't really like snow peas so I used a can of baby corn instead. I added mushrooms to it as well. You could use pretty much any vegetable you like. Will make again for sure.

My kids really liked this.  I thought it was ok, but missing something - not sure what.  I will try with ginger next time.  I did cut the cornstarch in half as suggested by others. 
I also added green pepper to it and blended in well.

This dish was great and enjoyed by the entire family.  I did however use the frozen stir fry vegetable and a little more garlic (i am a garlic lover).  i also added 1tsp of ginger as suggested by anothe reviewer.  This is definitely a keeper and will be made again and again.

I used frozen Asian stir fry veggies and added extra frozen broccoli so it was very easy to make and was so tasty!! We served it over basmati rice. The sauce is excellent. We just made it this weekend and will be making it again tonight. Thanks for the recipe!

The corn starch and the large onion combined with a full teaspoon of pepper makes for a gelatinous, yellow pepper gravy which was quite unfortunate. Cut down 1/4 onion, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1 tbs of cornstarch. Add ginger for flavor.

The sauce is delicious! I tweaked several things however. I cooked the chicken separately. According to the directions that's an extremely long time to cook chicken. It would be inedible. Best way to ruin any meal is to overcook chicken. I left out broccoli and went with green peppers instead and added baby corn. I didn't use cornstarch only because I like my sauce on the liquidy side and it thickened up after sitting for a few mins. Other than that the base recipe is delicious. Week definately use again

Very good stir fry recipe. It goes fast so make sure you have everything ready beforehand. I'll sometimes add onions or bell peppers.

I've made this twice now and just love it.  It's super easy and very flavorful.  The only thing I do different is the veggies I throw in.  I like using the pre-sliced "stir-fry" mix and then add in bean sprouts and bamboo shoots.  I make a bowl of Jasmine rice on the side and it's a perfect meal.

We extended the recipe - not really doubled - by adding a bit more chicken, green and red sweet peppers and carrots and little extra of the oyster sauce.  It was really good. Next time will probably do the same amount of veggies but a little less sauce just to reduce the saltiness.  And the leftovers became after school snacks the next two days!

I used bok choy, broccoli, snow peas, red pepper, and mushrooms.  I agree, any combination of vegetables works.  It came out really soupy, even after I added the cornstarch.  But tasted very good.

This is a good basic recipe that can be easily adjusted to your needs and what you have on hand.  I marinated the chicken for a couple of hours and per another person’s recommendation, add 1 tsp of sesame oil to the oyster sauce and soy sauce, which per yet another review,  I reduced the amounts.    I added the vegetables to the meat after the chicken had cooked for a couple minutes instead of the 10 minutes..  My veggies included broccoli, carrots, sugar snap peas, and sliced fresh mushrooms.  I didn’t add any extra water or cornstarch as the moisture released by the mushrooms created all the sauce that I needed.  I also just  stir fried until all  the veggies were cooked and did not cover.

Insanely salty. This could have used half the amount of oyster sauce. My husband’s hands were swollen for 3 days! I realized why when I checked the sodium content in the oyster sauce. Holy moly.

The chicken was amazingly tender, and the vegetables were cooked perfectly (due to the steaming that arises when you cover it), but I found it a bit fake-tasting in that it's basically just smothered in oyster sauce. I would have rather had more real ingredients in the sauce...

This was pretty tasty, and my fussy 6 y.o. who hates chicken gobbled it all up so it was a winner. My broccoli was limp so I had to throw that out, but I had baby portobellos that I added instead. A quick easy meal that the whole family ate.

I have made it many times.  I often leave out snow peas if I don't have them on hand.  Usually just use a stir fry or Normandy mix for the veggies.  If you have mushrooms on hand definitely add them.  

One useful tip.  The recipe is a bit too wet for our tastes, so I leave out the half cup water -  then I don't need the starch either.  

Try it you'll like it.

This recipe was really good, I followed it but added my own veggie favorites along with the pea pods and broccoli, I don't like water chestnuts so I added a small yellow squash and a small zucchini, green onions, mushrooms and fresh ginger to taste. I will make it often since I am trying to get more fresh vegetables into my diet...oh I also used about a Tbs of sesame oil with the vegetable oil.

This was fantastic!  The only changes I made were the addition of bamboo shoots and I didn’t have any oyster sauce on hand so I substituted by adding clam juice to the soy sauce for marinading the chicken.  This dish would also have been delicious as a vegetarian option by omitting the chicken.  We will definitely be making this again!

Husband said this was a keeper.  The only changes I made were boneless, skinless chicken thighs, no broccoli.  I did add red pepper and mushrooms.  I didn't have the breast or the broccoli.  Don't be afraid of the oyster sauce, It adds good flavor and color to the dish.  If your sauce is too thick, just add more liquid, either low sodium chicken broth or water.  It was a quick and easy dish.  Thank you for the recipe.

My first attempt at making Chinese in many years. Had to go to 2 stores to find the oyster sauce. I don't care for broccoli  or snow peas so added cut carrots and green bell pepper to the first saute.  At the end I topped with 1/4 cup dry roasted unsalted peanuts and green onions. I'll make this one again it was super easy to prep and cook.

I loved it as is, but hubby felt there was too much pepper so the next time I made it w/half as much pepper. I like it better w/the full tsp of pepper but it's still delish the other way. AMAZING dish that is now on my regular menu!

my husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did think it was a bit salty as one person stated and that's using low sodium soy sauce.  The oyster sauce I used was high in sodium; maybe there's others out there with less sodium?  I added extra water and did cook the chicken less than the recipe stated also.  Ginger and the peppers sound good for next time.  Thanks everyone for your ideas....

Very good. I used powdered pepper, and the bit of extra spice made it really good! This is only the third Asian dish I've ever made. I overcooked the veggies a bit, but it was still delicious.
