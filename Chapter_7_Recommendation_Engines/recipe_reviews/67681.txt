This is new favorite salad.  I too use the prebagged greens, this is quick and simple and everyone I have served it to just loves it.  Can serve as is or add some toasted nuts, or cheese.  Just delicious!

I just made this for lunch as I had all the ingredients in the house (I stock up on the various types of Dole fruit cups).  It was delicious and so easy to prepare.  Next time I think I will add a little crumbled goat cheese to it for an added kick.

This was a good recipe - nothing spectacular though.  Instead of using Balsamic dressing, we used raspberry vinaigrette - was a nice switch.

So healthy, so yummy and so simple.  This made an excellent lunch for me today.  I threw in some rotisserie chicken meat, left out the red onions and made my own vinaigrette. I also threw in some almond peices for a little crunch.  Thanks Dole.

This was excellent but I did make a few modifications.  In lieu of the red onion, I added chopped chicken and slivered almonds.  I added a little bit of the fruit juice to a low fat BV dressing (I like T. Marzetti's).  I also used bagged/prepared field greens instead of spinach.  Excellent!!

Extremely easy to prepare using bagged spinach. Husband loved the pineapple in this recipe. We also added a bit of blue cheese crumbles. Will make again.

Due to allergies, I had to leave out the pineapple, however, I did add some strawberries. I eat spinach salad just about every day so I'm always looking for different ways of preparing it. Very good!
