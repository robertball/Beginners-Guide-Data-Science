Excellent recipe. It took about 5 minutes to mix up and about 5 minutes to bake!
My three year old loved them.

I can see why other people had issues with the dough being crumbly. I increased the fat content to 1/4 cup (4 tbsp) and used butter instead of shortening. As an experienced pastry chef, I assure you the fats are interchangeable and using whichever you have on hand is fine. In addition, before rolling if you'd like to avoid the refrigeration process, simply wet your hands with cold water and briefly knead the dough with the extra moisture. The dough readily comes together, and I repeat this process when re-rolling the leftover dough.

You have to chill these or they will not hold together. 4 hours minimum! 5 hours is better. Stir them up in the morning, and bake them right after dinner! Spicy, crispy, great with coffee, or hot tea and milk. For those of age, try with pumpkin ale! YUM!

The dough was extremely crumbly - I couldn't get it to roll at all.

I baked up a batch of these and when I first tried them...I felt the molasses flavor was somewhat overpowering. However, after being stored in an air tight container for a couple days, the spice flavor comes to the fore and they taste really good. I might make the spice measurements heaping the next time I try them. 
I baked them up to make ice cream sandwiches to store in the freezer. I use about a fourth of a cup non fat vanilla frozen yogurt spread between two of these cookies, then wrap each one in plastic wrap and store a batch of them in a plastic freezer bag. They make a great low calorie treat.

All ingredients except the flour can be mixed and left in the refrigerator for 2-3 days to let the spices meld. Then add the flour. If they are to crumbly heat the dough to room temp. before rolling  and this should help. Also, I use mace instead of nutmeg for a richer flavor.

This works really well and tastes just like the ones our Nanem used to make. I did substitute butter for the oil/lard. I didn't chill the dough first. I rolled it out super thin between two pieces of parchment paper, cut out the shapes, removed the in-between bits, and froze them flat for 15-20 minutes. Then baked 325 for 9-10 minutes. Perfect.

These cookies taste very spicy and not sweet, and are best after a couple of days. They also look beautiful. I did roll my cutouts a little thicker so I only got 21 cookies. "Paper thin" was too hard to peel off the rolling mat. For that yield, I don't know if I would make them again, hence the 4 stars. I made these according to the recipe but mixed the dry ingredients together, and then mixed that in with a hand mixer until the dough looked crumbly. After that, I used my hands to squeeze the dough together. I don't recommend this recipe for beginners. I did chill the dough overnight. It was a little sticky to work with. Baking parchment worked well instead of greasing. The dough tastes terrible raw but is really good when baked. Kitchen smells heavenly.

I was hoping to find cookies that taste as good as Mrs. Hanes’ Moravian cookies but I think those ladies have magical powers. I liked these cookies but wished they were spicier. I used unsalted butter as my fat, as a previous reviewer suggested. I thought the cookies were a touch salty, but the house smells amazing and I will eat the cookies. Gladly. It was hard for me to roll them as thin as I wanted to. Next time, if I try again, I would try the suggestion to roll between parchment paper layers and freeze before baking.

This was a great ginger cookie recipe 

you do have to add extra moisture, 

review was very helping when suggesting wet hands and kneeding in the needed moisture, didn't even need to refrigerator (did add 1/4 coconut oil)

came out of the oven nice and soft, perfect for my ice cookie recipe!!!

I’ve gotten requests and raves for these cookies two christmases in a row. I will say I had to double the recipe to get 24 cookies (my cookie cutters are somewhat big). Also, you have to work fast with the chilled dough, on a well floured surface, or it will start to stick to everything. I made mine a little thick and soft and brushed them with “gingerbread icing” submitted by quacked.

Although the flavor of these cookies was very nice, I found this dough quite hard to work with. As posted, it was very dry which brought challenges but it was also very hard to roll out once I got it to stick together. In the end, I baked them thicker than they needed to be so the texture became hard instead of crispy.

I did not refrigerate the dough.  I made sure I had a good amount of flour under the dough as I rolled it super thin.  I then took a metal scrapper~  making sure flour was on the edge ~ and scooped em up and onto a parchment lined cookie sheet.  CAREFUL on the bake time, mine were finished in 5 min.
