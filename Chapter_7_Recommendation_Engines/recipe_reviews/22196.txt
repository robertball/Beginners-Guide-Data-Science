I tried this recipe because the dish is prepared the day before and baked the next morning. I did not have pepperjack cheese, so just increased the amount of other cheeses (wasn't worried about the amount of "zip"). Everyone really liked the dish - it was a big hit and quickly eaten - a lot of requests for the recipe. I gave it only 4 stars because there's a definite problem with the bake time and/or oven temp. After the time indicated, it was still raw in the center. As it continued to bake, it got a little too brown/crusty along the edges. When I make this again, I'll experiment and try it at 325 for a longer time OR maybe take it out of the fridge for 30 minutes before baking. Someone who requested the recipe from me made it and had the same problem.
****UPDATE**** Made this again, but took it out of the fridge and let it sit for 30 minutes before putting it in a 350 oven. Baked for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Came out perfect!!

I used homemade turkey breakfast sausage, Texas Toast croutons and one can evaporated milk (I don't keep half-n-half on hand). I added a teaspoon garlic powder and a touch Frank's Hot Sauce to the egg mixture. This was very tasty though quite greasy. I'd make this again but I would cut the cheese back by half. I served this casserole with homemade biscuits and Parmesan potatoes.

This is a very satifying recipe!  I have used frozen shredded potatoes instead of the bread with terrific results.  The pepper-jack cheese is what makes this recipe special.  Thanks, Jeanie Bean.

We all thought this was very good!! I used more croutons than required, plus they were unseasoned, used bacon instead of sausage (only because I didn't have any available) and added some chopped green bell peppers (1/2 cup) and green onions (1/4 cup).  Also, since I only had dry mustard (not "hot") I added 2 drops of hot sauce in.  Perfect amt of kick and taste. Thanks!

This recipe is ALWAYS a hit! It is better than all the other "overnight" egg & sausage casseroles. I think what makes it special is the use of the seasoned croutons instead of bread. I don't change a thing! Yummmmm.....

I have made this casserole many times, for work and for family.  It is very, very delicious and always a hit.  I have made one adjustment.  Instead of the croutons, I cooked shredded hash brown potatoes until they are very crispy and use them as the base for my dish.

Yum!! Just made this for an office breakfast and everyone went crazy for it. It's a tad spicy, but the crowd likes spicy. I followed recipe exactly except I used crumbled bacon instead of sausage - it worked just fine. Baked uncovered for 55 minutes and it browned beautifully, and came out super moist. This one is a keeper! Thanks.

If you wanted, you could top with salsa, sour cream, and even green onions and green olives.  It would lend itself to that as well.  Very tasty!

I've been making this recipe for about a year and it's always a hit.  I have substituted Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack for Swiss and Pepperjack and it has turned out wonderful.  Also, you can substitute ham for sausage--also very delicous.  This is one of my recipes for my left-over Christmas ham--Thanks, Susan!

I have tried about 50 different egg casserole dishes and this is FAR and ABOVE the BEST!  I only made one small adjustment - I sprinkled the onions on top of the sausage instead of adding them into the liquids (otherwise they just sink to the bottom).  I took it out of the fridge 30 minutes before popping it in the oven.  Bake time was exactly 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Came out perfect.  My family cannot get enough of this and I get asked for the recipe EVERY time I make it.  This one is a keeper!!

This was a fabulous casserole. My roommate hates new things and is a very picky breakfast person...SHE LOVED IT!!
I used a few healthy alternatives: I used 2c. red-fat swiss and 2c. red-fat cheddar in place of the cheeses listed, I used Fat-Free half/half, 2% milk and I also used red-fat pork sausage and 2c. of Southwestern Egg Beaters instead of the 8 eggs. I layered it all the same and left in fridge from 2pm-7am the next day and it was GREAT!!! Best breakfast casserole I have ever had!

I made this recipe for Mothers Day and my wife enjoyed it very much.  It was easy to halve.  I used Hot sausage to spice it up a little more.  Next time, I will try using broccoli instead of sausage to make a vegetarian variety.

Great recipe!  I would recommend lining your baking pan with foil first.  I made the mistake of making cinnamon rolls using the same 9x13 and even though I washed it, a trace amount of cinnamon taste came off on to the egg casserole.  It ruined the dish.  Have made it many times...foil saves it!!!

this was SO good. i made it and baked it right away lol. i'm sure overnight would have been better, but it was still amazing. i replaced the swiss cheese with more pepperjack and put half the cheddar on top and half on bottom of the casserole. i also added in one chopped green bell pepper, 1/2 onion chopped, and a few mushrooms chopped. i added all the veggies to the sausage fry pan for about 5 minutes after the meat was already browned. i also added in a 1/2 t of garlic powder to the egg mixture. so good! thanks!

This was very easy and had great results.  I used Jimmy Dean Hot sausage and added an extra layer of cheese on top before baking. In my haste I accidentally grabbed the Heavy Whipping cream instead of half and half which I suppose only made it that much better.  It was AMAZING! Delicious and everyone went for seconds until it was all gone.  I say 2 thumbs up and will make this again.  I will probably use croissants instead of the croutons as it will make the dish "plumper" and absorb better and maybe cut the milk in half to firm it up better.

I made this without any changes to the recipe for Christmas morning and it was a success.  I doubled the recipe though, but I still used one pan. It all fit (barely) into my 9X13 pan, although it was up to the VERY top.  When baking, it puffed up nicely and cooked beautifully.  One note, when that full, the grease from the cheese bubbles up and will spill over into over--I would recommend putting a cookie sheet underneath if it is doubled and in one pan.  I also found that it reheats nicely--we are enjoying the leftovers again today!  And for those leary of the croutons--don't be!  You can't even tell they are there after baking.  I will make this again.

Baked this for my son's class breakfast. It was mostly eaten by the adults and everyone said they liked it and wanted the recipe. I did not like it. To me it seems there were just too many flavors going on at one time. The strong flavor of the croutons, strong cheeses and meat was too much for me. If I make it again I will omit the swiss cheese and opt for fresh veggies browned in butter in lieu of the meat.

By mistake this last time I didn't get uncooked pork sausage but had on hand pre-cooked sausage links.  Instead of another trip to the store I chopped them up and added them the night before, they cooked while baking in the morning.  Fantastic solution - takes the messy step out.  Will do this in the future.  The entire family loves this dish and it's always the 1st eggbake gone at a potluck.

Great!  My mom has made egg bakes for years, which are very good and she thought this was better than hers - and dad must have said, "really great Julie" 3-4 times! I served it for Easter brunch.  I split the recipe in two, making two versions; one w/hot italian sausage and the other w/ asparagas. Both versions included mushrooms and green onions - everyone loved them both. The pepperjack cheese is definitely the secret ingredients.  Kids didn't care much for it though. I will keep this recipe and wow my friends and relatives for years to come.

Let me tell you, I am not a cook. Never have been and never will be. Simplicity is key, and this recipe fell right into that category. I knew what all of the ingredients were and had no preblems putting this recipe together. 

I served the egg bake for my mother and father in law for a Christmas Eve brunch. Everyone had seconds and I was not teased for any kitchen mishaps (a miracle). The recipe was wonderful, and the few leftovers tasted great re-heated! 

Of course I didn't change the recipe at all, but I wouldn't recommend any substitutions because the Zippy Egg Caserole was wonderful!

Excellent recipe.  Very easy and serves to a large group nicely.  Not the healthiest but breakfast is sometimes hard to make healthily.  I used spicy italian sausage and my husband said not to change that.  I also used some extra bread crumbs on bottom because I used a deep pan and didn't have enough croutons, and everything cooked well together.  I also used regular mustard.  Next time I will use potatoes and add some mushrooms or green peppers for a little differnt color and texture.

This is over the top yummy.  The only thing that I do that is not in the recipe is take the casserole out of the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before bakign to get it more to room temperature.  Doing that eliminates the potential of any runniness that others complained about.  DELICIOUS!

This recipe is excellent.  I did not need to modify it at all.  The croutons create a bread pudding like consistency that is wonderful.

Made this recipe for Easter brunch and it was truly divine. I was thrilled with it! A few substitutions - I used mushroom, bacon and onion instead of the sausage (personal preference). I had made a larger recipe, and I had difficulty telling if I had it right or not, so ended up adding more eggs/half-half/milk mixture.  It also was unclear whether to cover during baking or not, so I did, but removed it after 30 minutes.  Because I had a lot in the oven, this took me almost 90 minutes to cook, probably could have done it within 80 minutes, but it was hard to tell when it was done.  But it was so tasty -- I'll make it again and again.  The flavor's great, even the next day.  Got lots of praise for this one!  Thanks Susan!

Definate keeper! Didn't change a thing and it was GONE!  I'm one of those "nothing too spicy, please" (heck, I think room temperature ketchup is hot!)...but the pepperjack cheese added just a zing..not a even flicker of heat. Enjoy!

I had made this before (and rated it 5 stars). I just recently wanted to make this casserole for a baby shower, but I now live outside the U.S. and am unable to get croutons, pepper jack, swiss or cheddar cheese OR half and half.  But, I want to let you all know how flexible this recipe is!! I made my own croutons (using a recipe also from this site), all whole milk, chorizo instead of sausage (for that kick), and American cheese and a hard cheese similar to Swiss (those are all I could get here...). Anyway, it still turned out great! Next time, I'd use a bit less milk, but otherwise, I was pleased!

I made this casserole again yesterday for Easter brunch, and as always, it was a big hit.  I added a can of roasted green chilis  to the milk mixture and upped the pepper jack cheese.   I also used more croutons (the big Texas toast variety).   I hadn't made this for a while, but it is going back into the regular rotation!

I scaled this to 4 servings and by mistake put about three times as much croutones as the recipe called for. (It should have been 1/3 of a 5.5 oz packet)I put 6oz of my own home made, whole grain croutones sprayed with olive oil, sprinkled with mixed herbs and spices (Mrs. Dash)and baked in the oven. They tend to be a bit heavier than a white bread but it really soaked up the egg/milk/cream  mixture overnight and it turned out really grrrreat! I used chorizo chopped finely and fried with a bit more onion than called for plus green peppers and I added a pinch of paprika,cumin and oregano. Gave it tex mex flavour which goes down well in our house. Next time I will try it italian style, but it´s great on a Sunday morning to just make juice and coffee and everything else is done, because my misteken way cuts out the need to put more bread on the table!!

WOW!  This is one of the best breakfast casserole's that we've found!  We added a 1/2 cup of onions and green pepper and 1/4 cup green onion.  To the egg mixture we added 1 teaspoon of onion powder, garlic powder, and Emeril's essence.  We also used bacon instead of sausage. You can add whatever veggies and spices that you prefer for this casserole.  It tastes like a big fluffy omelet with alot of flavor!

I took this to worked and it was gone in minutes.  Everyone loved it.  I loved the pepperjack in this dish!  The only thing I did different was that I only added the half-and-half and no milk (since I thought I had some but didn't).  I thought it would be dry without the milk, but it wasn't!  It was VERY good.  Will make again.  Four people asked for the recipe.

I've been using this recipe for years. My go-to egg casserole. Perfect as written, but easy to change up (bacon instead of sausage, add veggies, etc.). Last year I made my own croutons with gluten free bread because we were having Christmas with family - still delicious!

I'm not an "egg" person. But I LOVED THIS! It is more cheese, half and half and croutons than eggs. Super delish! The first time I had it, it was made just as the recipe called for and it was to die for. I just made it myself for the first time and used all medium cheddar, bacon instead of sausage and 1% milk mixed with a little butter (about 5 tablespoons melted into milk) and it was awesome! I love the versatility of this recipe. I think I could use endless combinations of cheese and meet or veggies and it would turn out great every time.

This was good. Heavy and greasy, of course, as all breakfast casseroles are, but quite tasty. I think it would have been even better with salsa or other fresh toppings.

This recipe was awesome!!!  I made it for my mother for Mother's Day breakfast in bed.  I thought one pound of pork sausage was too much so I used about 3/4 to 1/2 of a pound.  I also added garlic powder, onion powder and green onions. Next time I will add green peppers, onion slices and mushrooms!  The croutons really make this dish delicious and the eggs come out nice and fluffy!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

This is a great brunch dish.  I've made it several times, and it is always a hit.  I use bacon instead of sausage - personal preference.  Works well. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

I have been using this recipe exactly as written for at least 10 years. Every time I take it to church I get many complements and requests for the recipe. A better quality sausage gets the most complements. I have tried it with diced ham also. Again, the quality of meat has a big impact.

This recipe is amazing especially for a large group. It's a family favorite. There are no alterations needed, however I've made it a few different ways by using whatever I had. I've used feta cheese instead of regular cheeses and cubed stuffing instead of croutons. I've also added mushrooms and spinach another time. Really you can pretty much add anything you want in it. Even a little jalapeño if you prefer something with a little spice.

I have used this recipe for years and it's always a hit.  I'm played around with the flavor of cheeses, changed meats, left meat out, added veggies, added hot sauce and everybody loves it!  I've also used left over stuffing mix for the croutons.  It has now become our Christmas morning breakfast.

This is a great base recipe.  I like bacon instead of the texture of sausage.  Also, I add fresh torn baby spinach, fresh sauteed mushrooms, and saute the onions for a healthier twist.  We love it and I made it for my family and they loved it too!

I thought the crouton flavor was too strong and the dish wasn't spicy at all. I prefer breakfast casseroles with a hash brown or crescent roll base, rather than croutons. It wasn't horrible, but I won't be making it again.

This was good, but not great...it still needed some spice, some 'pizazz'.  I'm giving it 4 stars for being so easy to prepare and the potential for being great!  I used HOT sausage as was recommended by other reviewers.  I even used seasoned croutons, and salsa cheese.  Maybe I'll add some mushrooms and peppers next time. I will make this again, but add a few more spices.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe. I altered it a little by using chopped, cooked turkey bacon instead of sausage and a little more onion. It was a big hit at my office brunch potluck last week. A real keeper!

Made this 1st time this morning for work breakfast.  Have been asked for recipe a number of times already and complimented by others.  Great to make night before and simply pop in oven - but it does take more time than 60 minutes (20 more for my oven!)

This was fine but I have had better egg dishes.  I did love the simplicity of the croutons in the bottom.  I subst. italian sausage that I removed from the casings to add more flavor.  But still, just okay for us, nothing spectacular.

had friends over for brunch and made this - they loved it!  Plus for me it was super easy as I could put it together the night before.  I was torn b/w a few of the other breakfast casseroles but went with this one based on the other reviews - so glad I did!  Croutons were much easier (and just as good) as cubed bread!!!!!

I made this casserole for a brunch tailgate, and it was a huge hit!  We had to travel about an hour to the game, and it was was just as appetizing-looking then as when I had taken it out of the oven. Followed the recipe exactly - delicious!

Since we don't eat red meat at our house, I used ground turkey sausage instead of the pork sausage.  I took it to a church breakfast buffet and there were no leftovers.  Thanks!

THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!I have made this casserole three times for different gatherings and every time I get great reviews.  I have always made it with ham instead of sausage.  Everything else is exactly as recipe suggests and it turns out delicious every time!

I used only sharp cheddar, and reduced the amount to about 2 cups, increased the eggs to 10, and used Jimmy Dean hot sausage. This provided just the right amount of spice for a diverse crowd.

Excellent. Made to the recipe exactly. Not enough for 12 because everyone wants seconds. I like the fact that everything is done the night before. Highly recommended.

This was delicious! My only caution is that if you prepare at a high altitude (I was at Tahoe), increase temp by 25 degrees and time by 15 min or more. Once I figured that out, it was a winner. I was also tempted to add the peppers & onions that others have, but resisted since this was for a diverse crowd which included some pickier eaters. (Sounds great to me, though!)

Made it according to recipe with the exception that I used hot Chorizo sausage instead. It was GREAT! It was nice to be able to do other things while breakfast was 'cooking itself'! 

I will definately made this again!

Very good! I eliminated the croutons and added my favorite veggie, zucchini, along with some green pepper. I didn't have any dry mustard so I used a tad of regular mustard (a trick my mom taught me a long time ago) Instead of layering, I mixed everything together and threw it in the pan. So my dish was more like "Zippy Baked Omelette." Pepper jack cheese is a great addition to this recipe. Thanks!

This is one of the best breakfast casseroles I've ever had! I always omit the swiss cheese and use extra cheddar in place of it. I also like to add a little more onion and some chopped green pepper. I've tried it with spicy sausage and that's great, but with the spicy cheese it might be a little too much for some people. Regular sausage is nice, too.

Wow, I am surprised and disappointed!  I amde this recipe as directed, except saved some of the cheese for the top of the casserole.  After an hour of cooking and then standing, it still seemed milky.  Finally, it did firm up enough to serve, but even then, I thought it was just ok.  I guess maybe I was expecting to much for all the rave reviews.  I used turkey sausage and you couldn't even tell due to the spicy-ness of the jack cheese, (which pleased my Italian husband & father-in-law), but overall, I have had much better breakfast casseroles.  Will not make again.

Made no changes. I think it would be better with mushrooms, chopped green peppers and onions. It was a little bland as is even with the spicy sausage.

I’ve now made this twice – the first time I used chorizo and pepper jack cheese, and the second time I made it exactly according to the recipe. Both times were fantastic and eaten up right away. One tip: be sure to really whisk in the dry mustard. I had one bite where the mustard was concentrated and it was really powerful. This one is a keeper!

Hello Paula,

I enjoyed your recipe for the Zippy Egg Casserole. However, I have a mild allergy to gluten's. So, although don't  stay away from gluten entirely, I do avoid it when I can. 

I substituted squared up corn tortillas for the croutons.  They worked great. I am making more this week end, This time I am going to add a couple small cans of Green Chiles. Should be even better.

Probably won’t make again with bread-based products. Pretty good flavor from the seasoned croutons, but my husband said he would have preferred potatoes instead. A little dry for my taste.

This is a very forgiving recipe.  I believe as long as you use some eggs, dairy, starch and the pepper jack it will be good.  I used chicken sausage, mozzarella and cheddar as substitutions.  Prepped and cooked the same day.  Its simple and tasty.

This was wonderful!  Since I made it in a larger 10 x 14 pan, I increased the ingredients as follows:  added and sautéed 1/2 chopped onion, 2 packages seasoned croutons, 3 cups shredded mexican style cheese, 12 eggs, 2 1/2 cups half and half, 2 cups milk, and 2 tsp dry mustard.  I took the casserole out of the fridge 1 hour prior to cooking, and cooked it for 1 hour at 365. Everyone loved it!!

I used a pound of bacon, cooked and drained, rather than sausage. I also used a single layer of a hearty white bread instead of croutons. The variety of cheeses was great, and the pepper jack gave just a hint of heat.
 I cooked this straight from the refrigerator in a 350° preheated oven for the longer suggested time of 60 minutes, and it was fully cooked.
 I took it to work for a staff brunch, and of all the egg dishes people brought, this was the only one that was almost gone at the end.
 I'm definitely making this again on Christmas morning!

I enjoyed this recipe greatly.  The Pepperjack really added a nice zip.  I used a crescent roll crust and made 2 of them, one with mushrooms and one without.  Everyone called a Quicherole.  I will definitely make this again.

Thank you for this recipe! It was my first egg casserole I've made and it was very good. I had to do some changes like using different types of cheese and making my own croutons and sausage just because the listed ones are not available in the country I live. I did use less cheese, maybe 3/4 c less, because it looked too much for me. I did what other reviewers suggested: let the casserole sit on the kitchen counter for 30-40 min before putting it in the oven and cooked it for 1 hour 10 min. Was very delicious!

Awesome! Made this for a Girls Group Sunday Brunch up at the Lake for a group of 15 ladies. I didn't bother starting the dish the night before.  Used a full 2 pint carton of half and half instead of the half and half / milk combo. Upped the cooking temperature by 25 degrees to shorten the cooking time by 15 minutes because the ladies were hungry and complaining.  It cooked perfectly.  Made with one 4.0 ounce package of gluten free seasoned croutons.  It served 16, so each serving was only 5 carbs, and was gluten-free.

Made this recipe for our annual Christmas Eve Brunch Open House---huge hit with adults and children alike!  Instead of suggested seasonings, I used Old Bay for a MD touch. Ended up printing the recipe for 5 friends who made it for Christmas morning!

This was really good, but is really high in fat and calories.  I cut back a bit on the cheese and subbed frozen shredded hashbrowns for the croutons.  I hope this cut off a few grams of fat! I do think this had just the right amount of heat - enough to add flavor, without overshadowing the cheese, egg and mustard.

This was recently given to me after a death in my family.  It was intended to be used the next morning.  We didn't bake it until 2 mornings had passed.  How wonderful it was.  It was the perfect breakfast to serve for my grieving out of town guests.  Thanks to my friend who made this for me and thanks to ANY14TNS for posting it.

Not as much extra flavor as I expected. It just has slightly more "zip" than a basic egg casserole. Definitely good, just not extraordinary.

I despise the traditional breakfast casseroles where there is soggy icky bread on the bottom. This has croutons as the foundation which cook up perfectly! This is my alltime favorite breakfast casserole.

This is my favorite dish for breakfast potlucks at work.  Everyone loves it and it is very easy to make.  Always turns out beautiful.  Probably too high in calories to have too often, but a great "special" dish to make for company, etc.

We love this casserole for brunch!  It has become a huge hit with my family. I have used regular sausage one time and then turkey sausage the next time. Either option is very good.

My husband request this any chance he gets. It is also one of my favorites. I like it better than the traditional breakfast casserole. I think the coutons and pepperjack cheese makes all the difference. I don't usually like spicy foods, but it is not too hot. It is awesome!

This is a great recipe for a cold, winter morning. Next time, I might add a little green pepper and fresh onion because our family likes them. 

Based on another review, I took it out of the fridge and let it sit at room temp. for 30 minutes before baking. Mine came out golden brown, bubbly and yummy.

This recipe was excellent!  Perfect for Christmas morning.  We just made one change.  We browned some hashbrowns in butter with garlic and onion powder and lined the bottom of the dish with them instead of croutons.  Yum!

Just served this casserole for brunch this morning and what a hit!  It was devoured in no time flat and everyone wanted the recipe.  I was skeptical about making it (croutons?) but they made an amazing base for the casserole.  I added some Canadian bacon along with the sausage, and like a previous reviewer, let the casserole sit out for about 20 minutes while the oven was preheating--60 minutes bake time and it came out perfect!

I thought this was OK. My fiance loved it. If I were to make again, I would add some hot sauce to the egg mixture and use a hot sausage. I was expecting it to taste "zippier", but it was somewhat bland.

Excellent! I had my mother make this for a brunch we hosted the morning after my daughters wedding. She made two pans to serve 12 people and there were no leftovers. Everyone loved it. My mother followed the recipe to a T. I will be using this for my Christmas morning breakfast from now on. I think the croutons make this dish. Its not mushy at all!

I made this two weekends in a row for guests.  I cut back a little on all three cheeses and thought it was great.  I may have baked it somewhat longer than it called for, but that could have been my oven.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was so easy!  I added some extra vegetables to the sausage and also did a vegetarian version (sauted spinach, mushrooms, onions) for a baby shower and they were a huge hit!  I added two extra eggs and cooked the meat version for 60 minutes and the veggie version for just a bit longer.  Great recipe!

Fixed this for my sis-in-law's 60th but even spicy it was a big hit. Hubby says this one stays for the B&B crowd that we run. Served with juice and Blueberry coffeecake that I baked at the same time. Fab - makes me hungry for some more. Thanks. Offerd the garnishes but everyone said no the liked it just the way it was.

Took this to my Mothers of Preschoolers meeting and when I went back to pick up my dish, it was gone.  Several wanted the recipe.  Will definitely keep this in mind for future use.  Made it as the recipe called and it was not too spicy - especially for our Tex-Mex loving crowd.

This was easy to make, and convenient to make the night before and then just pop it in the oven the next morning.  I made this for New Year's morning, and my husband RAVED about it!  I wasn't sure if the dry mustard would be overpowering, but I couldn't even taste it.  It's rich, but I will definately make this again.

YUMMY - one of the best egg casseroles i've had.  I didn't have the pepperjack cheese but instead used Colbyjack & it was still great.

Very good. I have a family of 4. I cut this recipe in half and it was more than enough food, almost too much. It was a little spicy for my young kids. Next time I'll try cutting back on the pepperjack cheese and increasing the cheddar.

I made this for an early morning meeting for my co-workers and everybody loved it.  I really liked how I could prepare it the night before and just pop it in the oven in the morning.  Next time I'll probably add a little more pepperjack.  Thanks for the recipe Susan.

This didn't really turn out for me.  The texture was a little strange.  I think the croutons I used were fairly large and it seemed like eating soggy bread.  The flavor was okay- maybe I needed to cook it longer???

This was an office HIT!  I made this vegitarian style (substititing the sausage for zucchini and broccoli) It was great. I did have to bake it longer than 60 minutes, but it could be since I used the veggies. I will definitely make again! And try with the sausage!

THIS WAS DELICIOUS! I CUT IT IN HALF FOR ME AND MY HUSBAND, BUT IT LOOKED A LITTLE RUNNY SO I ADDED ONE MORE EGG AND A LITTLE EXTRA CHEESE (WE BOTH LOVE CHEESE) AND SOME ONION AND GREEN PEPPER. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I found this recipe while looking for a quick and easy egg casserole to make for my hubby's birthday breakfast. I wanted to be able to enjoy a yummy breakfast without having to be a slave in the kitchen. It was awesome.  I can't believe how simple it was and the best part was being able to assemble it the night before. What a time saver.  I did a half sausage and half ham.  What a great dish.  Delicious! It's definitely a 5 star recipe and definitely a keeper.

I have made this a few times for the firehall boys and it has been a great success.  I did substitute hot italian sausage for the pork sausage, and added some diced onion and diced red, yellow and green peppers to the sausage layer.  Served it up with some salsa and they loved it !!

This recipe made my new year's morning. Being the morning after new year's eve I wanted something extremely easy to cook & I had a crowd of about 20 people to feed. I did all the prep work the day before & just threw the cassaroles in the oven in the morning. I did mix of the flavors (ham & broccoli, veggie...) & chaged up the cheese in some of the cassaroles. Thank you for the great recipe!

Loved it!  Made it the night before Thanksgiving and baked it the next morning -- it was easy!  Have made several variations of this one, using white bread, this one is far better tasting!  The croutons (I used a ranch flavor) made SUCH a difference.  This one will be our every Thanksgiving Morning tradition.

I made this casserole to serve at a brunch...I wanted something a little different.  It was great!  I didn't want it too spicy, so I decreased the amount of Pepper Jack cheese, but next time I will try it as the recipe suggests.  Also good with bacon!

Made it the first time and it was really good. I didn't use any swiss cheese, just added more of the cheddar and pepperjack. I added some green onion which turned out good. It took a little longer to cook than instructed by just a few minutes, but it was no big deal. I would definitely recommend and I would make it again.

I made this based on all the glowing reviews and because it is different, and OMG did not disappoint! Was SO good! DO NOT ADD EXTRA SALT! Is plenty salty already. Made exactly as written then added one small can diced green chilies, one small jar diced pimento and about 1/4 teaspoon black pepper for little extra zip and color. Perfect! But I don’t even want to think about all the fat! (That’s probably what makes it so good! LOL!) Will probably only serve for company and special occasions.

Made this exactly as the recipe called and it was really good. My son said it was like eating my quiche (which he loves). It was good warm, reheated and cold.  We like it spicier and will top with hot, fresh, roasted peppers next time. Also maybe sub sausage for bacon.

So easy to make and it was a big hit. I added spinach to it and used green onion sausage for the meat. Yummy!

Using local homemade sausage I didn`t need the pepperjack cheese. I halved the recipe cause it`s just my husband and I. I did add a little minced red pepper for color. It was wonderful.

After reading all the reviews, I thought I had a winner for our staff potluck. I thought this was mediocre at best. It really had very little flavor. I bought the Jimmy Dean hot sausage as suggested. I used more pepper jack cheese as suggested. I followed the recipe to a T. Sadly to say, I bought a lot of casserole home :-(. I do not recommend this recipe.

This recipe was shared by a cousin years ago and it has become a number one breakfast  requested ever since. You can use sausage, bacon or ham or all three! So easy to prepare before going to bed , and place it in the oven in the morning! So delicious

I will definitely make this again! My husband loved it...even though I forgot the minced onion and let it sit for about 1/2 hour before cooking instead of overnight. I enjoyed it as well but will try adding some peppers next time just for color. This is a delicious, easy recipe.

This is a delicious breakfast casserole! Made it while camping in our RV.  Friends loved it too! The picture that is shown with this recipe is a little deceiving because it shows bacon on top of it. The recipe does not call for bacon. I agree it would probably be a great addition, but I think the picture that is posted should be of the actual recipe.

Let it set out 30 minutes before baking (based on reviews). Kept covered for 25 minutes (cuz I just wasn’t sure) and cooked for 60 total. Turned out perfectly!! Thank you for the recipe!

It was okay. I cut the recipe in half since it was just me and followed the recipe except omitting the onions. Definitely needed some seasoning.

Very tasty and was popular with our guests.  For me, personally, there was too much cheese.  I am going to try cutting back on the cheese and maybe adding some hash browns and sauteed spinach in the middle.

This was a big hit with my family for Easter brunch, and on many occasions since!  Using the croutons as a base layer is brilliant.  The last couple times I've made this recipe I've modified it by adding some cubed cream cheese into the cheese layer, which makes it extra creamy and is a nice balance to the sharpness of the other cheese.  I also kick it up with some cayenne pepper and fresh ground black pepper.  These modifications easily take this up to a five star recipe.

Good wasn't just the best ever though. You will be surprised that you cannot taste the croutons like you would think. I had it once and froze the rest.....it didn't taste as good after frozen!!

Easy and outstanding.  Followed to a "T", though I used dried, minced onions, not fresh.  Hubby thought too spicy, so next time, instead of pepperjack, I'm going to try provolone or asiago....a keeper!!

I would have liked it a little more "eggy" so will cut back on the cream/milk next time.  I also used less pepperjack because of my kids but we did enjoy it!

Very good, quick and easy.  Also made for my MOPS group.  I like using croutons...a nice change.  It wasn't as zippy as I thought it would be, but that was probably better.  For myself and family, I'd probably used more pepperjack cheese.

YUMMY! I chose this recipe based on all the other recommendations it has recieved on the Web site. I doubled the recipe (fabulous allrecipes.com feature) for a football brunch and had compliments from everyone, and several requests for the recipe. A huge hit, and will be repeated at next year's brunch.

So easy!  Popped this in the oven this morning and took it to Bible Study hot out of the oven.
Everybody raved about it. Used Sage flavored sausage and didn't change a thing.  Great recipe!

This recipe is zippy all right!!! It has a very zippy taste and it is zippy to make. I did however add chopped onion and bell pepper to really add to the taste. Made it for a large baby shower and it was a huge success. It is very flexible; you can easily double and triple it. Throw out all of your old Eggs Brunch recipes...this one beats them all!

Very good and has a wonderful "zip" to it! I served it for a holiday brunch and it was quickly gobbled up! I used real onion instead of minced and I added some mushrooms - very easy to personalize the recipe.
