I really hate posting a negative review, but this just didn't do it for us.  I know everyone has different tastes and flavor preferences so keep that in mind. The  only thing I did differently was use a whole pork tenderloin and added some sliced onion. I can't imagine those minor changes would affect the flavor that much. This dish was just too heavy on the vinegar- very strong! I would try adjusting the amount of vinegar used next time.

We really liked this recipe.  I would use less vinegar next time and more jerk spice. I will make this recipe again.
