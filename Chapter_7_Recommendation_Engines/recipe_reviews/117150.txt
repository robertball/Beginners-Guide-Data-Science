Very tasty - love the five spice marinade, and the tomatoes just burst flavor in your mouth!  I actually like to use cubes of fried tofu, so I marinated tofu instead, and used soba noodles instead of spaghetti.  I stir-fried the tofu first in a wok with a few tablespoons of canola oil until it had good color on all sides, removed tofu and added peanut sauce ingredients (which I'd pre-measured and just dumped all in at once) and stirred until combined, then added pea pods and tomatoes for a minute or two and then added tofu back in with the cooked soba noodles.  You could use this method with any meat - just cut it up in smaller pieces and stir fry instead of roasting - it's quicker. You may sacrifice a little of the roasted meat flavor, but the peanut sauce packs plenty of its own.  I think you could consider adding more broth to thin sauce out, as another reviewer stated - it was fairly thick.

This turned out REALLY well! Very tasty! I added a bit more broth to thin the sauce, and served it with rice instead of noodles. Also added some chopped bok choy with the snowpeas. I'll definitely be cooking this one again!

I didn't make this as written only because I didn't have time to measure the ingredients.   I used a left over Asian style pork tenderloin, added bok Choy, left out the tomatoes, and topped with leeks instead of green onions. I only made these changes due to what I had on hand and due to time restraints. I used too much peanut butter. Next time I will measure and follow the directions better. It all still came out very yummy. I also used whole wheat pasta and added chopped cashews, which I wouldn't change.  Thanks for the recipe. Loved the sauce!

Excellent dish!  My whole family loved it.  I started with a pre-marinated Teriyaki pork tenderloin and was able to skip a few steps.  We will have this recipe again.
