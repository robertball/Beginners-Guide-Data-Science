I only had one pound of ground beef to work with. What I did was throw in some chopped veggies to fill it out a bit--chopped fresh onion, chopped fresh minced garlic, chopped fresh red pepper and cubed fresh zucchini. I did use homemade taco seasoning/chili seasoning. I did not add the additional salt as condensed soup can be quite salty on it's own. My family enjoyed this casserole, all of the boys asked for seconds. I'd make this again.

This was so easy to make and worked well with our crazy schedule. I made ahead and my kids heated it up when they came home from practices. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the heat was too much for my 2 younger kids. My older kids and husband were fine. The sour cream helped cut the heat some. I will make again, however I will use half of the suggested seasoning.
Thanks for sharing this delicious easy recipe!

The entire family loved it.  Instead of adding shredded cheese to the cheese sauce I used 8 oz. Velveeta.  Instead of baking it, I microwaved it for 6 minutes then added the tortilla chips to each person's serving so the chips would not get soggy on the leftovers.  I also poured most of it in a 9x13 pan and the rest in a 8x8 pan to be used later.  Nobody mind eating the leftovers!  Now that says something!

My family loved this!  I took the advice of another reviewer and crumbled the chips over each serving instead of during the baking process.

My daughter was concerned when I told her the other night we were trying something new and not to worry because its kid approved. She told me I have said that before but this time she was not dissapointed and I heard no whining!  This recipe is awesome! My entire family loves it! I tend to add a little extra cheese in the cheese mixture and the diced tomatoes with green chiles mixed in but other than that this recipe is very good as is!

I halved the recipe and it made a full casserole pan full.  Used 2c of macaroni and full cans of the rest, whole envelope of taco seasoning.  I mixed the soup and the rest of ingredients in a bowl-skipped the mix it on the stove step-then added the macaroni and layered as it said.  Did not put chips on it.  Mo said she didnt really care for. Dew loved.

This is a wonderful dish.

I added 2 cups of cheese and a tad bit more sour cream to the cond. soup and milk mix.

Next time I won't bother with the chips and add them later on individual dishes. Chips were soggy the following day; luckily I did not have too many to put on top originally. 

Also I think I will not use the entire package of noodles. Maybe 2/3 or even a bit less.

The casserole was better tasting a day after.

Just a few tweaks and Yum!

Tried this for the first time and it was a hit at a 4th of July cookout I attended. Didn't have all the exact ingredients so I compensated the following:

Boiled 16 oz. macaroni, drained and set aside.
CHILI MIXTURE - 
1 pd. ground beef + 1 pd. breakfast sausage, drained then added 1/2 c. chopped onion. Added 1 can of hot dog chili sauce + 1/2 tsp. chili powder + 1 pkg. of taco seasoning mix.  Added only 1 - 8 oz. can of tomato sauce + 1 - 10 oz. can of Rotel brand petite, diced, green chilies w/tomatoes + 1/2 water.  Added 1 1/2 Tbs. garlic powder + 1/2 Tbs. onion powder + 1/2 tsp. black pepper + 1/2 tsp. salt + 1 tsp. sugar. (Sugar added to cut the acidity of veggies, Julia Child tip!)
Added drained can of corn + 1 can of chili beans.
Let come to a boil and simmer 20 minutes...

CHEESE SAUCE - 
Substituted 11 oz. Tostito queso cheese sauce + 1 cup grated, sharp cheddar cheese + 1 cup of whole milk + only a scant of pepper and salt (omitted garlic powder). Mixed cheese sauce and macaroni and poured it into a large, oblong slow cooker (sprayed Pam prior). Poured chili mixture on next layer and poked with end of a wooden spoon to let some of the chili juices go down in macaroni to prevent sticking.  Topped with remaining sharp cheddar cheese and and garnished with a few jalapenos. Turned cooker on low while I prepared dessert and got ready for my outing. (About and hour and a 1/2.)  Once there, I served it with sour cream and corn chips on the side. They loved it!!!!

JUST found this and JUST made it- AMAZING!- I tweeked it, because I didnt have all of the ingrediants. Didnt have an onion but i had minced garlic..so cooked the meat with the garlic..only had 1lb of hamburger meat and NO kidney beans...but i did have a can of hormel chili with beans so i used that as a substitue to make up the rest of the missing meat - didnt have the diced tomatoes..but would have been nice...i used a package of velveeta cheese instead of making your own. - My husband likes his dishes spicey, so during the last process of cooking the chili and meat mix, i added chili powder and red pepper flakes and more pepper. Cooked it covered with tinfoil for 15 minutes- and then sprinkled seperate portions with Frito Lays Chili Cheese Fritos instead of the plain tortilla chips...AMAZING..my husband ate it in a tortilla...i didnt...haha SoO GOOD. VERY filling, we have ALOT of leftovers..i need 3 seperate tupperware dishes haha

I am going with a 4 star, because I changed a large part of the recipe... The chili. After reading other's reviews, I made it with my chili recipe and I would recommend using your family's favorite chili. The chili portion of this recipe calls on a lot of pre packed spices and I am just not a fan of that flavor. I did follow the remainder of the recipe, except I held the tortilla chips to add after baking as one person suggested. The macaroni and cheese portion of this recipe is really good and being mac and cheese instead of plain noodles added to this twist on Chilimac. The family really liked the combo and it was a big hit.

I loved it. I had a lot of family over this week so I needed something that would serve quite a few. Casseroles are the way to go when you are serving a lot of people. I omitted the tomatoes because of picky little children in the house and also served the corn on the side. I added one extra can of tomato sauce because I omitted the diced tomatoes and it turned out wonderful. I always sprinkle a little extra cheese. I also went ahead and cooked it with the chips then also put the bag out so people could add some fresh ones to the top of their own plate of food. The kids liked it and the adults. We all had seconds!

This was good!!! Only reason didn't give it a 5 star rating because the casserole was too salty due to the high sodium content contained in the Taco and Chili seasoning packets. I also used whole wheat elbow macaroni, which made it a bit healthier. In the future, I'll use my own chili ingredients from the pantry to avoid the high sodium content and season it to taste. Otherwise, great flavor and great diversion from regular mac and cheese!

easy and yummy! 
I made it on the stove top, no baking, and didn't have cheddar so I used mozzarella. I also left out the chips. 
I will definitely be making this again!

This was very good, but as a cheese-a-holic, I thought it needed more in the macaroni layer, as well as on top.  Maybe 2 cans of soup next time, or more shredded cheese?   This makes a TON.  It almost didn't fit in my jumbo lasagna dish, lol.

Okay so I made a lot of changes to this recipe but this is still the best base recipe you will find for chili mac, in my opinion, therefore I'm still giving it a 5 star rating. It's probably just fine as is, I'm just an over achiever. My changes were: I used "chili" spiced diced tomatoes and kidney beans, I used one can of tomato sauce and an extra can of diced tomatoes instead (gave it more delicious chili flavor too, and I didn't need to add chili seasoning due to this), I added a can of whole olives (you could use sliced too but I buy bulk packs of whole ones and am fine with them being whole), I used 3 tbsp of my own taco seasoning mixture that can be found on this site (Taco Seasoning I, I omit the salt and pepper though because for some recipes it can be overpowering, I salt and pepper separately), and for the cheese sauce (the cheese soup x sour cream x milk) I used the cheese sauce part of Chef John's Macaroni and Cheese recipe (it is literal food crack, extra work but you absolutely won't regret it I promise).  I also simmered the meat mixture for about 30 minutes to tenderize the beef (I would have done longer but it was late, I was tired, meh) and help the flavors meld together, it's kind of like a tex mex ultimate comfort food lasagna lol, I really love it! The two flavors of the mac and cheese and chili compliment each other so well, it is insane!

Made this exactly as the recipe stated except I used penne pasta instead of macaroni because that's what I had.  This makes A LOT so I split it into 2 smaller casseroles, one to keep and one to share.  Everyone really liked it and asked for the recipe.

This was fantastic! I skipped the chili seasoning and added a little more taco seasoning because my kids are wusses. Everyone loved it! I even liked eating the chili part with chips all by itself.

Made this tonight for the first time, it was really good! My husband is a picky eater and he enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly and it made two big casserole dishes so I stuck one in the freezer unbaked and have an easy weeknight meal now too

My family loves this! I change up by using 1 lb of ground turkey & 1 lb of sausage, then replace the kidney beans for chili beans.  Sometimes I'll spice it up some more by putting peppers in it and/or crushed red peppers.

This recipe was very very good.  It made a lot of dirty dishes but I will make this one again.  It really makes a lot of food.

This recipe was a huge hit by the entire family - even for hubby who 'hates' casseroles. I followed the directions but did add extra cheese on top. Thanks for sharing this one.

I loved it!  I did of course make some modifications.  There are only two of us eating this so I cut the recipe in half, but still added a whole can of beans, etc... I did not add the corn (because I had just made corn casserole the previous night), or the chili packet, or the sour cream and it turned out wonderful!  It's even better the following day.  I will definitely be making this one again!!!

Not sure I got the ratios right, but had too much chili flavor the way I made it.
