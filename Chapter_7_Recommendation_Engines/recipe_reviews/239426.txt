For as simple as these were to make, they were really, REALLY good! I used a combo of green and yellow peppers and WW flour tortillas. Just before serving, I squirted a fresh lime wedge over and topped with some spicy salsa. I would def make this easy, yummy, healthy dish again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I really liked this recipe. I had everything in the house to make it. It was easy to make and I didn't have to buy a fajita spice packet like other recipes. I liked also how less greasy it was than restaurant fajitas making it more healthy in my opinion. The peppers and onions had such a nice flavor. It didn't say, but I sliced the chicken tenderloins into 1/2-1" sized slices. For ease, I used a partially defrosted bag of Trader Joes sliced mixed colored peppers. I had about 3/4 of a 16 oz bag left and it worked well. I will try it with fresh in the summer though. I also used Trader Joes homemade brand tortillas which I briefly warmed in the microwave. Instead of cooking everything all at once I first crisped the chicken in the oil after it got nice and hot on temperature 7. Then layered the sliced onions on top until they softened and lastly the peppers and seasoning. The peppers were a little watery due to not being fresh but the chicken and onions were golden in color by that point anyway. I thought the seasonings had the right balance. I got about 6 chicken fajitas. I am going to put this in my box of meals for regular rotation. ty

This recipe was delicious, also it was very quick and easy to make ..... I added a fajita seasoning pack just to make it extra saucy and it was amazing..I made 6 servings and it was plenty for my family I recommend this to anyone making fajitas...and will defiantly make it again...

I made the Chicken Fajitas from Mazola(R) yesterday for lunch and they turned out okay. The recipe did not seem like it would have a lot of flavor so I doubled the cumin and added sour cream and avocado to mine. This is a great quick lunchtime meal. It is a very easy recipe to follow and prepare. I felt like I was doing class one from the AllRecipes Cooking School. This is great for knife skills and mise-en-place practice. ?I think in the future I would marinade the chicken for a few hours prior to cooking and grill everything rather than saute it for extra flavor.  Grilling the veggies gives them a LOT more flavor! #?AllstarsMazola?

Definitely go with the skirt/flank steak substitution. The chicken was a bit bland and needed something to up the flavor.

Another quick, easy recipe from Mazola. I marinated the chicken in the oil & seasonings for several hours. I also added extra cumin, and some chili pepper flakes for a little flavor and kick. I cooked the chicken first in the marinade, took it off the heat and then cooked the veggies in some of the marinade that I had set off to the side.

This dish was OK for a quick meal. It tasted good, but we didn't especially like the way it was spiced for fajitas. I upped the cumin to 1 tsp, and am glad I did. I thought 1 tsp of oregano was too much. We are used to more spice in the fajita mix I make, so we had to add hot sauce and spicy salsa to enjoy these. I agree with bd.weld that these seasonings would probably taste better with steak. Mine came out a little watery. I added the chicken and veggies to the oil at the same time, as the recipe states. I usually saute the peppers and onions a bit before adding the chicken, which I think helps get rid of some of that water from the veggies.

Yum! I was home by myself, so using what I had in the house, I scaled down the ingredients and treated myself to a 5-star lunch :) I will make these again when everyone is home to enjoy them. Great basic recipe...just adjust to your personal preferencea.

Excellent mild fajita recipe.   I did add a bit of salt and a few teaspoons of lime juice, but otherwise was very good.

Great recipe! Fast and simple. The directions are spot on.
I added probably 1/2 tsp of kosher (Morton's) salt.

This recipe was fine as is. I like to try recipes as I see them the first time and afterward try them with suggestions from the reviews. It is my opinion that, if one takes time with this recipe, it will turn out okay.

They were alright I think it needs a bit more seasoning. I made two pans full one with the seasoning in the recipe and one with those seasonings plus sazón and adobo seasoning. I personally liked the second batch more and they definitely needed a lot of cheese.
