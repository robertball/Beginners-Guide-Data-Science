This is an extremely simple, yet very tasty recipe! I tried to make it as close to the recipe a possible...but after I'd started making it, I realized that I was out of regular dijon mustard. I used honey mustard instead...and it tasted great. I also forgot to thaw my chicken breasts ahead of time...and I put this together at about 11:30 last night. I just put the frozen breasts in the greased pan and poured the marinade over. I covered it with foil and put it in the fridge overnight. It made a great lunch for us...after church, I pulled the pan out of the fridge and just popped it in the oven. I did find that it took a lot longer to bake...more like an hour. But we have problems with our oven over/under heating, so that might have been the case. The finished chicken was extremely juicy, tender, and the flavors of honey, mustard, and curry came through very well, harmonizing nicely without anything being overpowering. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's a keeper!

I wasn't going to make this because I have never used curry powder before but boy am I glad I went and bought it. Haven't had a chicken recipe I enjoyed this much in a long time. It is the kind you  let a mmmmmmm out with each bite. Even DH liked it. You won't be sorry if you make it. I plan on making this often.

I made this dish with the suggestion of a previous poster by adding apricot jam and some cut up dried apricots. It helped cut the curry a bit. It turned out great.

I made this for recipe group, we enjoyed it. I cut the curry to 1 tsp because I was serving it to children. I found it left me wanting some fruity flavor with it. I think next time I might add a little bit of apricot preserve just to balance the curry. I would increase the curry to the full recipe amount, it wouldn't be too much for us next time.

While this was a 5 star put together rather quickly recipe to set over night in the refrig...I wasn't too excited about the flavors. My family loved it very much as they ate the entire batch. I used a family pack size of chicken breasts( it was 6 breasts, but they were severely huge), I butterflied all the chicken breasts to make more portions and to stretch it out further. Doubled the sauce to accomendate the amount of chicken I had. All in all they loved it, I thought it was okay. Don't know what I could add or change to make it a wow factor for myself. TY though.

This was OK but certainly nothing exciting.  I was afraid of the honey or mustard being too central to the flavor, but neither was "too much."  Perhaps the soy covered that a bit.  Unlike some of the reviews, I do like curry as long as it's not ridiculously strong, but I really couldn't even taste it.  (There was a hint of it in the leftovers heated up.)  It's a bit of an odd blend of ingredients, but nothing seemed to predominate at all - so there was nothing about it that really "made it" for me.  It's very easy and I give extra credit for that; however, it's not a "last-minute" kind of easy for when I just want something easy and quick, because of the marinating time.

I followed the recipe as written. I let it marinate for over a couple of nights. It turned out really good. My husband and son really enjoyed it. Thanks. It is likely to be a regular item in our house for dinner.

I am unimpressed. It should be called Curry Baked Chicken. The Honey and mustard disappear under the strong curry. Even tho chicken was covered and steamy, still dry. I chopped it up for mediocre chicken salad. Sorry, I was really craving honey-mustard chicken.

We like curry, which is why we liked this. If you don't...you will probably not like this as written, but could reduce the curry powder. I used spicy brown mustard, and it turned out fabulous. You can definitely taste the honey mustard in this, but it is subtle to the curry.

I made this for Recipe Group.  I really liked it and will make it again.  It is so easy to throw together to marinate, and then it cooks in the oven while I pull together the rest of dinner.  The chicken is extremely flavorful and tender, and the sauce is great over rice.   Definitely a success!

This is the easiest, most flavorful recipe! I found it while browsing low-calorie chicken options for some clients I work for (8-10 people, so I double the recipe), and they all love it so much that I can't put it on the menu enough! Also, the staff who prepare this follow the recipe exactly - except they don't marinate it - and even without being marinated it is delicious and juicy every time.

I told my husband (pickiest eater ever) about how much they love it so I made it for him (didn't marinate it, never do), served it with a side of rice and veggies, and he said it was awesome and to make it again! I wish all recipes were this easy!

This was definitely a tasty dish  I liked the combination of the sweet of the honey and the "kick" of the curry powder. It's a keeper that I will probably make again.

This could just be a personal taste thing, but the curry powder seems a bit out of place here and dominates what should be the star flavors, the honey and mustard.  My opinion would be to just leave the curry powder out, particularly if you aren't using a good quality variety.

This was a great recipe.  The only thing was I added some ginger, a tad more soya sauce, and a bit of regular table mustard.  It was fantastic. :)

My family loved this! I had tried making other honey-mustard chicken recipes before, but they didn't seem to like them, until i made this one for them. It's definatly a keeper and I will be making this frequently, as it's one of the few chicken recipes they enjoy, besides fried or barbiqued!

Tasted pretty good to me.  I cut the curry powder to 1/2 teas. though.  Everyone in my family ate their chicken with no complaints, so that's good.

A pretty good recipe overall. It didn't turn out quite as I expected it to but I think it was because of the type of dijon mustard i had. The sauce was very dark looking because of the soy sauce but it tasted a lot better than it looked. Next time I will make sure I have the regular kind of mustard than the kind I had.

I made this as the Group Recipe for the Recipe Exchange for the week of May 31st. Despite the fact that everything conspired against this recipe, it turned out great! I even forgot to marinate it at all, and there was still so much flavor in the chicken and the delicious sauce that I can't imagine it being any better marinated! I also have to thank the Recipe Group for choosing this recipe as it prompted me to finally make my own curry powder, as I have always avoided recipes with curry in them because of my dislike (ok, loathing) of fenugreek. So for this recipe I made my own fenugreek-free blend, and I really, really liked the curry sauce :) Note: I only had 3 pieces of chicken so I had extra sauce, which was great over rice. In the future I would make sure to always make extra sauce! Thanks for the recipe!

This cooked up to moist, flavorful chicken but the wonderful aroma as it cooked wasn't as obvious in the finished product.  Oddly enough, I felt the honey mustard combination overwhelmed the curry.  I will add a bit more curry powder if I make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

An easy-to-make and tasty chicken recipe, reminiscent of one I used to make years ago. I only had Dijon mustard with tarragon, so used that and added 1 tsp of curry (just to accommodate my husband's taste). A definite keeper. Thanks for the recipe, Kristen.

very interesting and different, i do not use curry, but i did eat this all up! hubby approved as well :). i did accidentally double the sauce, but i'm glad cuz there was plenty to pour over rice or noodles....i wonder how it would be to cube the chicken before cooking and bake with the rice or noodles mixed in all together....hmmmm, i may try that next. Thx!!!

This was very good for as simple as it was. Had a nice flavor that was not overwhelming. Chicken came out moist and could not have been easier- I threw it in the fridge to marinate before work and popped it in the oven when I got home. Thanks for an easy weeknight meal!

I tried this recipe for the first time a few years ago and have made it many many times since. I always get asked for the recipe. I am not a big fan of curry, so I leave out the curry powder. Big fan of this recipe :)

Before marinating, cut breasts into chunks. Marinate in refrigerator overnight.  Bake at 350° for 25 minutes. Check chicken, take off lid and baste.  Cook another 10 minutes if necessary.

My whole family loves this recipe. I make it exactly as the recipe says to and it's great. I like using chicken breast tenders. To me, it seems like bigger breast pieces tend to dry out more.

Good, solid 4 star recipe. Only 1 of the kiddos didn't like it-not too bad:) Funny how the tastes differ, regarding other reviews because we tasted the mustard & curry predominately & couldn't taste the honey at all!

This was delicious. I didn’t have time to bake them, so I cooked them on the stove, turning once for 4 minutes on each side. I then put the pan under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the sauce.

I chopped garlic instead of using curry powder and overnight the flavor came out really well.

This is such an easy, delicious way to make and serve chicken!!  Unfortunately, I was in the middle of cooking mine when we got visitors around dinner time, and it sat too long so the meat was dry, but that is not the fault of the recipe.  We loved the sauce which we served with pesto pasta and a veggie side dish.  I will definitely make this again, and NOT ANSWER THE DOOR!!    ******UPDATE******  I needed a sauce for a pork roast, and decided to try this same one.  I had pre-cooked the pork with an herbal rub and it was wonderful, but with this sauce, it was superior.  I served it over noodles with green beans and cole slaw, and followed it with pumpkin bars.  Pretty terrific food.

First time making this dish I followed the recipe, it was good but felt it needed something more. Making the second time I used the same amounts but added a bit more honey and Dijon mustard. I also cut the large chicken breasts in half, longways. I thought it tasted better but still felt it still needed something more......Finally, the third time was a charm (I don’t give up easily). I took my second version and added 1 tsp. minced garlic and 1 tsp. minced ginger. For us, it was just enough of that “something more” ;D Perfect!

This turned out great even though I didn’t have time to marinate the chicken.  I threw it together, let it sit for about 5 minutes before putting it in the oven.  It’s a keeper!

I don't know what happened...made this for Rosh Shanah...instead of curry powder I accidentally used cayenne pepper.   I marinated it...but baked it for 30 minutes...flipped then another 30 minutes.  I was good even with the mistake...nice and juicy.  Next time I'll be sure to use curry powder....I'm sure it will be great!!

This was delish!! So easy too. I used thin chicken breasts, and eyeballed the measurements. I used less curry, less than a tablespoon. marinated it for about 3 hours.  My husband and son loved it, no leftovers!.
Saved it in favorites! YUM

This smells amazing while it is cooking and it is beautiful when plated! I had to change the recipe a tiny bit since I do not have pre-mixed curry powder. Instead, I used a half teaspoon each of ground coriander, ground ginger and ground turmeric. The chicken was so tender! We will be eating this again, and soon!

easy and delicious! though i'm not a huge curry fan, the ingredients when blended together work perfectly. i did use just a little more honey - have to admit, the curry scared me at first. but thumbs up from me, the wife, AND my picky daughters! thanks for sharing.

I thought this was excellent!  I only used a teaspoon of curry and added some Cajun seasonings!  Perfect and I'm not really a fan of honey mustard but wanted something different.  Will definitely do again!

It was OK.  I forgot to put in salt and pepper which didn't help.  The honey is too much and makes it too sweet.  I had to put in more soya to take some of the sweetness away. I used Ceylon curry powder.  I cook and grind my spices from a genuine Indian and Sri Lankan recipes.  I wouldn't use shop curry powders.  I don't like chicken breasts, so I used wings.  I must say that the chicken was delicious, but I couldn't eat the sauce.

As stated, easy, tasty, and very kid-friendly. The resident "kid" is my husband who just smelled this cooking and asked was I trying to kill him; meaning was this going to be too spicy. (Yea! It was not.) He ate, seeming  to contemplate every bite. His usual post meal comment if pressed is the ever endearing, "I ate it, didn't I?" But at the end of this meal, he said, "Pretty good." So, I guess it's a "high five", on all points touted. // I halved the recipe, and had a scant 1/4 cup of the sauce leftover, so day 2 for lunch I sauteed some onion and carrot, stirred in some rice, pushed aside and cooked an egg in that. Put in a bowl and seasoned with S & P and poured the leftover sauce over all. Yummy.
