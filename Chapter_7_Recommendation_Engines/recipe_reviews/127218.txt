I first saw this recipe a few years ago in an advertisement for Philly Cream Cheese and loved it! I used to make it annually for Thanksgiving and then lost the recipe! I was so excited to see it again here on Allrecipes! I think the spicy, flavorful crust made up of gingersnaps and pecans set this recipe above and beyond. So easy to make - so delicious!

Reduced cream cheese to 3 packages, came out fantastic. Didn't have a hand mixer so spun the cream cheese/sugar/egg mixture in the blender to whip out the tiny lumps. Worked perfectly. Came out creamy & smooth. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner with the BF's family & they raved that it looked like it came from a bakery. None leftover. Added a pecan topping of 1/4 C brown sugar, 1/3 C pecans,  2 TBS melted butter.

The most perfect Thanksgiving dessert. I wanted a pumpkin based dessert but most of my family doesn't like pumpkin. I have made cheesecakes for years though & thought I'd give it a try. After reading the reviews, I automatically increased the spices - cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons, nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon  & cloves to 1/4 teaspoon. I also set aside 2 cups of plain cheesecake as opposed to 1 1/2 to make it not too "pumpkinny". I also baked it in a water bath. It was the most delicious, light & creamy cheescake! The spices were perfect and it had the hint of pumpkin without it being overwhelming. I am definitely making this every single Thanksgiving. And by the way, all the pumpkin haters couldn't get enough.

I made this for a retirement party and received multiple texts telling me that it was amazing. I did take the advice of several reviews and increased the amount of spices. I also purchased pumpkin spice cheesecake cookies at Target for the crust and topped it with  vanilla mousse rosettes. I plan on making it again for Thanksgiving.

One of my guests called it "heaven on a plate".  It was easy and pretty.  I have made it w/ a graham cracker / pecan crust as well as the gingersnap/pecan crust.  I preferred the graham cracker crust with salted pecans chopped into it - but then I love sweet / salty.

I saved this because I saw a video using the same recipe but in a 9x13 sheet pan, and I took it to the Thanksgiving dinner at the school where I teach.  It was a huge hit, and while there were a lot of desserts, there was none of mine left at the end.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe at all, except that the video said to bake it for 45 minutes.  It was so good!

This is the second time I've made this, and it's a little work, but it's sooo worth it! I was very lucky the first time, because, after following the directions on how not to have a crack, I didn't think I would be so lucky this time. It was done in the exact time - 55 min. @ 350.  After it was done, left it in the oven, in a pan of water, with the door opened a crack, for an hour, then I ran a knife around the outside edge to prevent cracks.  Other than 1 or 2 small cracks around the outside edge, it came out perfect. I made a graham cracker crust instead of the ginger crust, and it was perfect. It was a hit for Thanksgiving, and I got some compliments on it!

I made this for a work function and it was a big hit!  I will definitely make it again.  
I did use a water bath and let it cool in the (turned off) oven after 55 min.

Great recipe! I still canâ€™t figure out how to prevent cracking. I used graham crackers instead of ginger snaps & followed recipe as is.

Help!! Iâ€™ve made this family favorite for several years in a row and itâ€™s become an  expected  tradition. But, we just relocated from south Louisiana to an elevation of 9,000 ft in the Rocky Mountains. Iâ€™m still learning to adjust tried & true family recipes like red beans. So far baking is the worst. Any suggestions ASAP on what I can do for this cheesecake?

It was really easy, I saw the images and thought I have to do this.  I was expecting it to be more difficult.  The only change I would make next time is to bake the cheesecake on a baking sheet in the oven had a little bit of leaking from the butter in the crust.

Please be careful when you print this recipe. I just did now and it  went from 4 8 oz packages of cream cheese to 75!

My hubby loves this cheesecake. He asks me to make it for him every year as a birthday cake. In fact I need to make it for him tonight!

What a delicious cake! 
I did modify it.  I doubled the amount of all the spices and was very careful in the cooling process.  for example, I cooled it with the oven door open for a while, on the stove top for a while, I took the form off and kept it on the counter for a while before I put it in the fridge.  it's perfect, I'm very proud of this cake??

I've made this young cheesecake a few times and LOVE IT. I've followed the recipe exactly, however this time I halved it because I didn't have a springform pan. So good. Definitely a fall staple. By the way, gingersnaps are very difficult to get completely fine,  I had several pebble shaped pieces in my crust and (thanks to the butter) it turned out great.

I've made this cheesecake several times over the last few years. I used nyaker ginger snaps (with and without the pecans). Tastes great both ways. The thinner snaps are easier.

We liked this even better than pumpkin pie! Very light and fluffy! I used graham crackers as I did not have any gingersnaps in the cupboard. This recipe is a keeper!

I'm teaching my daughter how to cook and this recipe ( she made it gluten free) was delicious! Even my co-workers are placing their orders with us!??

I have made this at Thanksgiving and Christmas for the past three years.  Everyone loves it and it looks so festive with the swirls on top.  It is not difficult to make and tastes delicious.
