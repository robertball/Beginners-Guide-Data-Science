Made for our Cinco de Mayo gathering:  The reviews from everyone was “Santo Guacamole!” (Holy Guacamole!)  This is SO delicious! I made it exactly as written with no changes or substitutions. It’s perfect, delicious and filling. This is my new favorite salad. I made it for May 5th,  and I’ll make it for July 4th, August 3rd, September 2, and October 1st.  Absolutely LOVE this salad!!!

Savvy's recipe was recommended to me by our friend, Candice, and I'm ever so thankful! Shared it with about 20 other AR friends at Marianne's Sauza Tequila party yesterday. A real homerun! You will be amazed with the dressing and fresh blend of veggies. Like Bibi, I used 1 lb of spring greens and that was perfect. I agree with Christine that it puts me in mind of a Mexican Caesar salad. Thanks again, Savvy!

This colorful salad is a beautiful presentation, and it is a creative and tasty combination of ingredients.  Served for a dinner party, I followed the recipe exactly except for one thing.  I used 1 pound of salad greens, and this made 8 generous salads.   I love it when folks ask for the recipe, in my book, that makes it a winner!  Thanks, Saveur!

Outstanding salad recipe that is loaded with flavor!  I (We) loved everything about this salad and the dressing works as a wonderful stand-alone dressing.  I've made the dressing two additional times, just to have on a simple lettuce salad.  I admit to 2 changes in the recipe.  I use anchovy paste in the dressing rather than fillets as I always have the paste on hand.  Also, I had to use frozen corn, but it was fresh off-the-cob corn that I had froze.  I made this for my son and DIL's Couples Wedding Shower and it was a huge hit.  I came home with an empty bowl and no dressing left. :o) Fantastic recipe Savvy - thanks for sharing.

DELICIOUS, but I expected nothing less... The dressing is fantastic! I made it the night before to allow the flavors to blend thoroughly. I loved everything going on in this salad...the crunch form the lettuce, peppers and croutons, the sharpness of the parm cheese, the savory black beans and the sweetness of the corn (I used canned), combined w/ the dressing, mmmm... Oh, and I added some vidalia onions in there too. All of the flavors blended beautifully! This really did remind me of a 'Mexicen Caesar Salad'. I will def be making this again and again...it's so fun, festive and refreshing! Thanks, Saveur, for sharing this! :)

I halved the recipe.  I would either add a few more tomatoes, corn, and beans, or lesson the amount of greens.  
I did not halve the dressing and used about 3/4 of it.  Very good.  Would make a good sauce over street tacos.  

Had a bbq with friends . Smoked chicken, ribs .. the salad was a hit .. even with the kids!

The dressing is so good!  We had the salad once as a side and the next time added ham and hard boiled eggs as a main dish.  Also added avocados which put it over the top.  We will enjoy this salad often.  Thank you for sharing!
