Four stars for taste. The method for me was a bit difficult seeing that there was never a dough to roll but more a batter. I used King Arthur Flour's gluten free bread &pizza crust mix (18.5 ounces) not Bob's Red Mill. I adjusted ingredients according to the amount differences and also for my taste. I used about 1/2 cup of white sugar and about 3/4 of the cream. I poured it onto buttered parchment paper but it was impossible to roll due to being so liquid as well as cutting/scoring it. I ended up with a cake which I cut into pieces and then covered with the glaze which I reduced as well. Definitely worth trying. Perhaps next time I will use a trusted homemade bread mix instead of an industrial produced one.  Thank you for the recipe.
