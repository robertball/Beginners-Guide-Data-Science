This was a great chili! I modified it a bit and added chili powder, crushed red pepper & a couple of fresh hot peppers because I like my chili to be spicy and it was a perfect sweet&spicy mix. I brought my modified recipe to a chili cookoff and won "most unique".

Very good. Has nice sweetness to it. Perfect with a little cheddar cheese melted on top.

I'm probably one of the most inept cooks on the planet and this recipe turned out great for me.  My daughter is a picky eater and she loved it.

This was good...but not great.  I have had much better.  The pineapple was a nice addition and I might include that in my go-to chili recipe.  Note: my 3yo LOVED it!

I liked this but I can't say that I loved it.  My husband and son said that it was good but they don't think that they would want it again.  If I try it again, I would have to eliminate some of the sweetness.

I admit, I made some changes to this based on what I had available, but I stuck to the recipe as much as I could and think it turned out pretty tasty.  It had a nice sweet flavor to it and it was definitely a change of pace.  I served with cheddar cheese on top and cornbread on the side.  The changes I made were: 1)cubed pork loin chops in place of ground pork, that I browned lightly before adding to the slow cooker 2)canned tomato in place of fresh, one drained can per tomato called for  3)Slightly less pineapple than called for  4)additional corn kernels in place of baby corn  5)apple juice in place of apple cider  6)additional brown sugar in place of molasses  7)I knew I would be cooking this for 7 hours, so I cooked on low instead of high.

Delicious and easy!  Don't let the long list of ingredients fool you-this is a very simple recipe.  I used regular paprika and regular apple cider and topped our servings with sharp shredded cheddar.  We really liked this dish!

Wow- loved this recipe even more than I was expecting! I used regular chili powder and paprika and forgot the brown sugar (oops!) but it was still phenomenal! I added 2 diced jalapenos since I like my chili spicy and it was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. 

I served it with shredded cheddar and sour cream. I also mixed half the leftovers with brown rice and brought it for lunch during the week. Both veriations lended well to the chili. I will definitely make this again. It is a unique dish that will surprise you. I would definitely reccommend it for a pot luck as it is a definite crowd pleaser!

Not being a fan of traditional chili, I really liked this recipe. Would definitely make again. I used 1/2 pork, 1/2 chicken.

I loved this recipe!! It's totally a different kind of chili. You taste the sweet and hot, but nothing specifically screams there's pineapple in here! I even ground mine in the food processor so that it was really hidden because I'm not sure my husband would have eaten chili with pineapple -which he totally loved it by the way. I didn't have 2lbs pork so I used 1lb pork and 1 lb turkey. Turned out great!!

This has an interesting flavour combination.  The adults liked it , but kids gave it a thumbs down.  I added a can of kidney beans and as I didn't have 2lbs of pork I used 1 each of pork and beef. Also I was out of paprika so used about 1 tbsp of chili powder (which gave it a nice bite and probably why the kids didn't like it).  I think I may use more pineapple next time, it added a tasty flavour.

Didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for. I like the sweet/spicy concept, so I'll probably play around with the spices next time. Definitely needed the cheese and the sour cream, and to give more than three stars, I think the chili  should be able to stand on its own.

This chili is delicious! I served it at a large family event, and everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  Only changes I made were regular paprika (coudn't find the Hungarian one) and two pints of home-canned shredded pork instead of freshly cooked.  Definitely a keeper - wonderful!

We meat eaters liked this; the pineapple stayed very hot. We had lots of left overs, which I put in the freezer. It was easy enough to make!

This is a crazy chili...and it is crazy good too!  Smells kinda funky, but taste is all there.  I do add something for a little heat, either chipotle, cayenne or crushed red. Didn't have sage or yellow peppers or fresh tomatoes.  Used tomatoe puree.  Used Chili 3000, but any chili powder would do over plain Ancho. And I think it could use another can of black beans as well. So easy to make.  I've made it twice...once a season. It would be fun to bring to a pot luck as something a little different. And if you are a curry hater, don't worry, it doesn't taste curry-ish.

This was really good. I added one hot pepper instead of the powder cause I couldn't find the powder. I think mine was pretty spicy, but the sweetness went with it perfectly. Thank you!

Delicious! Best chili recipe I've made. The pineapple and hard cider give it a yummy sweet flavor. Had zucchini so used that instead of pepper. Next time I'll add more curry because I couldn't taste it too much.

DH & I just made this today in the crockpot. We were a little concerned about the flavour combination but it turned out amazing!  It smelled soooo good while cooking, we could hardly wait to try it.  You get - salty, sweet, spicy.  We added about 2 lbs of pork chops, cut up and 1 lb of pork sausage meat (no casings).  We used a can of crushed pineapple, not drained.  Thisis a great recipe that we'll be making again.  Give it a try, you won't regret it.

I made this with only a few little changes and it turned out incredible, it is definitely going into my meal rotation! I substituted out regular onions for the green onions since I didn't have any, added one more clove of garlic (mine were small), and added a fair bit of chili powder so it was mildly spicy. Turned out perfect! Very flavorful and excellent with some cheese melted on top.

We really enjoyed this delicious and different chili recipe.  Loved the sweet/savory/salty going on here, especially the addition of the pineapple, yum!  With an ingredient list this big I did make a few tweaks based on what I had, used 1 lb ground pork and 1 lb ground chicken (I use this mix in a sloppy joe recipe i make and love the texture and cuts a few calories), a 15 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of the romas, an 8oz can of tomato sauce instead of paste, and doubled the curry, love the stuff. I also added a couple of heaping tablespoons of sambal oleek for some heat.  Lots left over for the freezer.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR, a hit!

Loved it! I like spicy so this had a good mix of sweet & spicy for me. My boyfriend and son like it but are so used to the traditional chili taste of tomato sauce, etc that they weren't as impressed as me. I added crushed red peppers. Very easy to make!

This was very good..I made some changes just because I didn't have the apple cider so I used the juice from the can of pineapple and a small can of pineapple juice. Also instead of using fresh tomatoes I threw in a can of rotel which spiced the chili up...I didn't need to add any more hot sauce. I really like the pineapple in the chili...I would definitely make this again

Not what you expect when you hear "chili" but it's freakin' awesome! I cut the honey by about a third and added a tablespoon of maple syrup (I'm Canadian and couldn't resist)

Didn't have hard apple cider. So substituted 2tbsp cider vinegar and a 14oz can of tomato sauce.  And added back some of the (crushed) pineapple juice I had drained.  Cut back to 8oz tomato paste. Still a thick meaty chili! DO NOT skip the pinch of cinnamon or the curry.  This is the mosy flavorful chili I have ever had.  You can actually taste each of the ingrediants.

I substituted molasses with honey and used regular apple cider.  I used pork shoulder chucks instead of ground pork.  I followed everything else according to recipe.  Cooked in slow cooker all day.  The taste was good, a little sweet, a little spicy, a little tomatoey because of the tomato paste.  My husband liked it.  My daughter thought it was OK but she prefers he ground beef chilli that I normally make.  My sons did not like it at all.  I thought it was just OK.  It was easy but you have to buy all those ingredients and mix all the spices in which can be time consuming.  I don't think I'll be making this again but it was good to try something different.

Absolutely delicious chili but I recommend adding crushed red pepper and/or cayenne pepper for heat. We added both because at first taste we thought it was missing something and the heat was it. Highly recommend this recipe. Different but terrific!

This was a little too different for my family. I used habanero chili powder instead of ancho, and only used half the ground pork, but my husband wouldn't even finish his and my 18 year old didn't even try it. My 15 year old loved it, my 10 year old struggled through it, but I don't think I'll make it again.

This chili is sweet and that's how I like it!! I heated it up a bit more with some ancho chiles in odobo sauce, as well. As for meat, I use more than the ground pork. I use Italian sausage (spicy), andouille, gr buffalo, gr beef and gr lamb. I do believe the heavens shined down on me while making it because everybody sat back at the end of the meal, with that happy, fat and dumb look on their face! Thanks for making me the hit again!!!

I am obliged to exchange the pork for kosher reasons. Every other ingredient remained the same and it proved excellent.
