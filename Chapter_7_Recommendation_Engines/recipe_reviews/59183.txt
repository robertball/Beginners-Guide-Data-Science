Too many changes to rate this any highter. Dried parsley and basil already a turn-off--I used fresh.  Also, I should have known better on the measurements of other ingredients. Amounts of oil and vinegar should be flip-flopped--three parts oil to one part vinegar.  As written, and especially if you use a well-aged balsamic as I did, this was much too sweet.  Finally the garlic--ohhhh, the garlic--I'm reeking of it an hour after I've eaten it, and I believe I'll still be tasting it, and my pores oozing of it, tomorrow. This was garlic overkill--and I LOVE garlic.  This is a recipe that effectively takes a combination of perfect ingredients and totally ruins it. I should have used common sense.

I usually add about 1 1/2 cups cooked couscous to this to serve as a complete meal. We like to put this salad in whole-wheat pitas with lettuce, plain yogurt and a dash of hot sauce... My husband really likes this!

I thought this was a good summer bean salad, but I made some changes.  I left out the sweet onion and added green onions, b/c I was worried the raw onion would be too overpowering.  I also left out the cucumber, b/c I don't like them.  I added choped zucchini, diced red pepper, and a hand full of chopped fresh cilantro.  This recipe is really better if you let it sit overnight to marinate before serving.

This recipe is great if you switch the amounts of vinegar and oil- 3T oil and 1 T vinegar. Doing that makes for a great summer salad.

This recipe is a great starting point. I didn't actually measure anything, I just threw everything in a bowl and mixed. I added a squeeze of lemon juice, a splash of wine vinegar, and a pinch of sugar. I only used one clove of garlic (and it was plenty!) Definitely leave the salad in the fridge for 45 mins- an hour to let the flavours come together. I was surprised when my husband loved it and said it was a keeper- I just used up whatever I had kicking around in the fridge! Love when that happens!

This was pretty good!  I doubled the parmasan, garlic and salt and also added pepper.  I also added cooked couscous like someone suggested, I think the recipe as is is too bland.

This is a delicious salad- very filling and tasty.  I sauteed the onions and added red, yellow and green peppers to the dish.  I also just used Italian seasoning in place of the parsley and basil.

On finished presentation, this dish looks rather scary -- the basalmic vinegar colors much of the veggies a rust-brown, creating what amounts to a somewhat disturbing-looking bowl of chickpea gulash.  As for taste, there's nothing to write home about, and nothing really comes through except for the basalmic.  Sub-par; there are better chickpea salad recipes out there.

I was impressed with this recipe.  Bearing in mind, I am not much of a vegitarian eater, but wanting to incorporate more of those kinds of dishes into my diet.  For a first time chick pea eater, this was a pleasant surprise. Thank you :)

Very nice, had run out of a couple of the herbs, had to improvise with a premix, still turned out nicely.

This was okay but I can't say either of us really enjoyed it. It was kind of a boring flavor.

The flavors are really good.  Not loving the gritty texture of the chickpeas.  Wondering if there's a better alternative.

This exactly what I was looking for. I added pasta to make it a really good meal. This was great for lunch because it could be eaten cold as we dont have a working mircowave. I also like to serve this over a bed of mixed greens. The dressing from the chickpea salad drips down on the mixed greens, and its like I get a bonus salad! Yum!

Simple and delicious! I added a little more garlic and parmesan cheese than the recipe called for, and didn't have any grape tomatoes so I just diced a regular tomato instead. Made a nice, light dinner.

I really liked this! I had to use rice vinegar, as I didn't have balsamic on hand, but it was really quite good! I left out the salt and cheese, but I thought it was great. Normally I don't like chickpeas (unless I'm eating hummus), but I was surprised how tasty this was. Thanks, Karkles!

Pretty good.  I ate it more or less like a pizza with tzatziki on naan. Waited to add the tomatoes then forgot them.

Very good, needed to substitute diced tomato for the grape tomato as I didn't have any on hand.  I also did as one reviewer suggested and added couscous after it was done marinating in the fridge, had it on pita bread with some romaine lettuce for a light dinner.  YUM!

I am not much of a chickpea salad lover although I do like hummus. However, I found this recipe delightful. The flavors blended nicely and our company enjoyed it as well.

Very good. The only thing I changed was a dash more parmesan cheese and half the salt. Next time I would consider leaving out the salt. Overall, this was an easy salad to prepare and the garbanzo beans are surprisingly filling.

Really tasty! The only thing I would complain about would be that the vinegar was a little bit overpowering, so I doubled the cheese and it seemed to "dilute" it a little. Great recipe overall though! Will make again!

Great recipe!  I added a little more parmesan, and red bell pepper.  It was very tasty!  Even hubby liked it, and he isn't fond of these sorts of vegan fair.  We will certainly be adding this to our regular rotation.  Thank you!

This was pretty good, and a great vegetarian option.  I probably would add some more parmesian next time, but overall, good and easy.

A chickpea lovers dream! I used a little more olive oil and vinegar (red wine) the second time, because the balsamic is not quite tangy enough. Otherwise, I left it alone (amazing) and it's great.

I followed this recipe exactly and have to say, I don't know why some people felt a need to alter it. I quite enjoyed this as a light, easy, not mention healthy lunch dish. Thank you for sharing it. I'll make again for sure!

As other reviewers have stated, I changed so much I probably shouldnt rate this. However, it is a pretty descent quick lunch salad. I used half English cucumber and half chopped tomatoes. I used 1 garlic clove and a little garlic salt and omitted the salt, onion, and dried basil. I also subbed orange vinegar for balsamic, with a ratio of 1 tablespoon of oil and vinegar each. I like the added parmesan.

This was very good, and different. Goes great with Don's Mediterranean Burgers. I used green onion instead of sweet and only two tablespoons of vinegar. Will make again, if only I knew how to get DBF and DS to like garbanzo beans.....

This is a great recipe to play around with.  I left out the beans since I was using penne so as not to have too many carbs.  I also used feta cheese instead of parmesan and only 3 tbsp. of oil.  Wouldn't use the penne again, too big; bow ties would work better.  Next time I'll try the original recipe.

This is so good.  I left out the tomatoes as I don't like them, but kept everything else the same.  Tastes better the longer it sits.

Really delicious and so healthy! I reduced the amount of garlic, added a couple of tbps of feta cheese besides the parmesan and I think fresh basil here is a must. Thank you so much Karles!

This is a great summer salad!  The longer it sits the better it gets so I will make it a day before I need it from now on. We ate it all before I realized I forgot the Parmesan cheese but it was still delicious!

YUM! I cut the garlic down to 1 tsp, left out the onion, and swapped the oil and vinegar amounts. With these changes, I loved it.

The ingredients are a good start, but I didn't use the exact measurements given.  I definitely used more parmesan cheese than it called for.  Also, I added sundried tomatoes in oil, which people loved, and chopped black olives. It was a hit.

Was going to give this a 4, but then let is set longer and wow, then I just loved it!   Especially with the parmesan, that just topped it off to have that grated on top.  I love balsamic though.  I thought everything came out well after sitting fort awhile and then dustin with fresh grated parm just tops it off, wonderful!

I doubled the garlic, substituted feta  for parmesan cheese but something was still missing.  I let the salad marinate overnight but a distinct flavor was not there...perhaps it needs some kalamata olives?  It was good but not great nor memorable.

I very much enjoyed this recipe, but like the others I also added the couscous and black pepper and I doubled up on the garlic and used twice as much fresh parmesan.  After leaving it overnight in the fridge, I felt the couscous took out the necessary *zing* and before serving it I added another tablespoon of vinegar and olive oil.

What a fabulous healthy way to use my cucumbers and tomatoes from the garden!!  I used fresh basil and parsley rather than dried and also added diced black olives and doubled the garlic (garlic lover!).  I've made it two days in a row...and counting.

This recipe was great before I even added the dressing.  I also added sweet red pepper and omitted the parm cheese.  I couldn't wait the 45 mins, I kept stealing spoonfuls.  Only thing I would change is to add a bit more salt.

When modified, this recipe can be great. I wish I had trusted by instincts not to use the amount of balsamic this calls for. Way to much. As another reviewer suggested, switch the amounts (although I still don't think you need as much oil/vinegar mix as called for). I'm going to try this again with this and a few other changes, because it was a simple recipe that everyone in the family could enjoy.

I followed the recipe but used fresh parsley and basil, chopped fine. Left out the cheese because I can't eat dairy. It was DEELISH!  My husband loved it, too. Wish I had made a double batch because there wasn't enough left for another meal. A winner!

I made this for a vegan potluck (sans cheese). I am not vegan, but I really enjoyed it! And it's quite simple to make. The only other change I made was to add some red pepper flakes to give it a little heat. I have made it two more times since then and found it equally enjoyable. As others have mentioned, it is better on the second day, so let it marinade if you have the time.

This was really good.  Honestly, we were expecting it to be so-so but it was great, I'll definitely make this again.  I used green onion as another reviewer suggested but I think it would be just as good or better with sweet onion.

I didn't follow it exactly so only 3 stars. Added a cup (dry) of whole wheat couscous and left out the Parmesan to make it vegan (I add Feta at the end for those who aren't) I also add in any veggies that I get that week at the farmer's market-the latest was asparagus!
I also nix the dried herbs and opt with fresh dill instead. But use sparingly as a little goes a long way. It usually doesn't need that much Balsamic.

I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic, and used fresh parsley instead of dried. I also added a little lemon juice. Delicious!

I loved this! I made couscous for my husband but I ate it without and we both loved it. This will be added to my faves! So good, super easy and quick.

This is really good! To make it a bit healthier I cut back on the olive oil and omitted the cheese. I let it sit in the fridge overnight to let the flavours meld a bit more..it made a really good lunch!

This is absolutely delicious.  The only thing that I changed was the balsamic vinegar to red wine vinegar (it was what I had on hand) and added a bit more than was called for. My boyfriend and mother both said that it was to die for.

Good salad. Nice alternative to regular salad. My husband thought there were too many chickpeas in the recipe. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't great as leftovers the next day.

It was pretty good. I've been looking for healthful alternatives for lunch/dinner and thought this looked good. We can't eat tomatoes, so I had to leave those out. I think they would have helped the flavor. Chickpeas are so strong-tasting that you need other flavors to kill the chickpea taste a bit. Not bad though.

LOVE this recipe.  My husband always asks for it. I used a bit more garlic and parmesan-- about 2 tbsp. and also used fresh basil and parsley.

I loved this salad and because it's so healthy I keep on making it over and over, and find myself snacking on it constantly.  I sometimes add italian seasoning which kicks up the flavor a bit.  I don't think I'll ever get tired of this salad!

This is very good and great for the summer to use fresh herbs and veggies.  The only change I made was to use fresh basil instead of dried and I didn't use parsley.  Next time I would use two cans of chick peas and maybe add feta. YUM!

This was delicious. The parma cheese gave it a great flavor (I also added extra as some other reviewers suggested). I will definitely make this again. I imagine that the same recipe can also be made using white or red beans, which I may try using next time.

I loved this! Very tasty.

I didn't really change much...I used fresh parsley & white balsamic vinegar to keep in the natural colour of this fabulous dish.

And as some other users suggested I added extra Parmesan cheese.

Highly recommended!

My dr. put me on a high fiber diet, so I have been trying to find interesting and tasty ways to meet my goals. This salad was fantastic! I omitted the onions because I don't like them. I used a long, English cucumber and did not chop it overly finely. My only recommendation would be to cut back on the garlic just a bit and then add more if you feel the desire.

This was so-so.  I was excited because I really like all the ingredients - especially chickpeas and balsamic vinegar - but it just didn't really do it for me. Nothing really wrong with the recipe, though.

I loved this recipe.  I made two slight alterations-  I left out the garlic because I didn't have any in the house and added a small green pepper, diced.  
I will be making this one again over the summer.
