This recipe was a hit!! My daughter had a "picky" friend over and even she loved it. My husband thought it was a little bland so next time I may add a few spices. Otherwise, we loved it. It was great with a salad and some crusty bread. I will be adding it to the dinner rotation.

I made this recipe using my own "homemade, canned" tomatoes. They were almost identical to the recipe. It was excellent tasting.

Just loved this recipe! The only two things I did a little different was I added a small chopped yellow pepper and instead of a yellow onion, I added a chopped up shallot. It was so delicious! Great job!
