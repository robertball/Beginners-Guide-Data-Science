These are delicious! They're equally good with a plain cookie crust if you find yourself short on almond paste.

I brought them to work and they disappeared!  I used whole wheat flour and no one could tell the difference.  I didn't use as much coconut as it said, I just sprinkled some on. I could have eaten the whole batch if I hadn't shared it with my work!

Great flavour combination! :D

I like my merengues a little more dry, so I elongated the second baking time.. and lowered the temperature for that to 130 celcius. Also I used homemade blueberry jam.... Just perfect! :D

This was simple and so good, I had to freeze the extra to stop everyone from eating to much.  Even from the freeze the taste as great.  This recipe will be kept and used for Holidays.

Great recipe- all my friends absolutely loved them!  They're fall apart pretty easily if you're not careful when you cut them up, but they taste delicious!

I'm ashamed to admit that I overmixed the egg whites so they were watery (I just bought a powerful stand mixer that I;m learning to use). No problem! I just added a little more coconut. The sweet aroma of almond blended perfectly with the raspberry and coconut.

I decided to try these because I was looking for something different than the traditional cookies and brownies.   My husband absolutely loves them and has already eaten half the pan in half a day.  He says the crust is the best - the perfect soft texture.  I was surprised that the crust turned out as soft as it did -- it didn't appear soft after the first baking, but the jam must soften it up.  I like them too.

These are sooo good! A new favorite for my family. Very easy, fast recipe that produced excellent results. I used a can of Solo Raspberry Pastry and Cake Filling in place of the jam and it worked out great. We love coconut but I thought 1/2 cup was going to be too much so I just sprinkled coconut on top until it looked like enough. These won't last long around here and I will be making them again soon. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful bar and nice to have almond paste in the crust.   Love almond flavor in anything.   The only change for us is to use apricot jam because we prefer it with the almond taste.   This, of course, is a personal preference and not a criticism.

Very easy and quick.  The Almond Paste was a little hard to find and not cheap!  Made a kinda expensive cookie but it was a hit at the cookie exchange! Cut into small squares because it's so rich.

I made these bars last year and they were the hit of our christmas treats.  My mother-inlaw loved them so much she asked me to send her the recipe so that she may make it for the rest of her family.

This is the second time making these.  I made them last Christmas.  Everyone loved these and they look impressive also.  Two notes:  I find the almond paste doesn't get combined evenly into the butter, so next time I will shred the almond paste on a box grater into the butter, making it alot finer.  Also, I didn't use foil.  I used parchment paper (only) and it was FANTASTIC especially once the meringue had been baked.  The whole bar (and paper) had shrunk away from the glass pan enough to just lift out cleanly and easily.

OK, these aren't even out of the oven yet, but just a word of warning to bakers out there that are going to try this recipe:  Use the Meringue II recipe on this website and not the meringue instructions that come with this recipe ~ they DON'T work!! I wasted 3 egg whites and 1/2 cup of sugar...down the drain. It never set up even stiff peaks.  The Meringue II recipe started forming nice peaks almost immediately, so I knew it would be right.  It looked ok when I put it in the oven; let's hope it tastes good, 'cause right now I'm kind of ticked; I don't like wasting time or money, and tonight I did both.

Tasty but I would suggest about 5 minutes less in the oven for the crust and an extra 5 minutes (over the 20) for the meringue. Following the recipe rendered my crust crumbly and the meringue watery about 30 minutes after taking it out of the oven.

Easier to make than I thought. I was out of almond extract and used coconut instead, turned out fine. I don't have much experience with meringue and was a bit worried but it turned out fine. I used extra large eggs but the layer was not too much as others have complained about. The jelly layer does not look very thick but the taste is plenty strong. I really liked these and my boyfriend did too and he usually only likes chocolate desserts.

Just made these for Christmas Eve - delicious!  The only change I made was to use homemade black cherry jam instead of raspberry.  Love the almond flavor.  The dough was soft, almost like an almond macaroon.  These will be made again next year!

These were yummy.  The almond paste made a nice taste in the crust.  They baked up beautiful and cut nicely once cooled.

These are a nice change from the "cookie".  THe rasberry layer is strong enough even though it doesn't look like much, may even reduce it next time just a tad.

I have not tried this yet tomorrow i will but i have a recipe for marzipan as one review said how it is expensive so here we go 1 cup confectioners sugar  and 1 cup regular sugar2 cups blanched almonds 2Tablespoon brandy 1 extra large egg 1 teaspoon of almond extract put almonds,  in blender and mix untill it will look like very fine bread crumbs loosen any clumps add sugar use blender or by hands, sift confectioner sugar and stir well, in another bowl beat egg and brandy and almond extract  set the bowl over a pan of hot water or use double broiler beat until custard thickens slightly pour custard into the almond mix ture blend together it may take a little while for the sugar to dissolve and the oils from almonds to emerge at this point you should  have a workable paste if you feel there is not enough liquid you can add more brandy but i didnt  it should mold into a ball easly if it is to soft  to make a ball you can add more almonds and sugar  it is important at this point to wrap ball in wax paper or cling film and wrap tight so as it does not dry out i made this recipes as it is written so i hope you enjoy it as it is the best

These were very easy to make! I used a full 16 oz. jar of raspberry jam, and for the crust I used almond filling instead of the paste. I couldn't get myself to purchase paste for $5.49, though the filling was good enough at $3.69 a can.

I thought these were just OK. Crust seems too thick to allow the other flavors to 'hold their own' merits. If I make it again, I'll make 1/2 the crust

These bars were delicious and got eaten up right away, but... I did have some difficulty making them.  Spreading the crust in the foil was impossible for me, and I decided to get rid of the foil and just spread it directly onto a very well-greased baking dish.  I don't think it affected it much.  Then, I somehow messed up the meringue part because once I started adding the sugar, it just got less and less stiff.  I finally gave up and just put what I had on top.  They still turned out very tasty, but beginners beware.

Mmm I am very happy with how these turned out! Made them for my family and mom & dad both thought they were delicious. They look really pretty & gourmet. I chose not to put coconut on top and opted for slivered almonds instead... it tastes really good and I'm happy I used them instead of the coconut. Also I used a full small jar of raspberry cranberry jam. The crust was hard to spread in the pan but it did work out in the end. All the effort was worth it and I will make again.

Honestly, these were really good, but the meringue was still too soft in the middle. I like it when it becomes dry and crispy. Next time I make these, I will probably make less merigue, so that i speads thinner, and cooks crispier. Otherwise, the flavors were fabulous, and very easy to make too!!

These are divine- I really love them.  I used almond paste from Germany (who's fancy? lol) and half whole-wheat pastry flour.  I used a very high quality seedless raspberry jam; used a whole 10 oz. jar.  I've never made meringue before, so I was afraid of over-beating it, and as a result, didn't beat it enough.  My layer wasn't very thick at all, and it didn't have the right texture, but it still tasted good.  Before I make these again I will practice making meringue.  I love the delicate almond flavor highlighted by the tart raspberries.  Fresh raspberries on top, like another reviewer did, would make it even better.  Great recipe!

Superb!  Took my favorite ingredients, almond paste, raspberry jam and coconut, and turned them into a fantastic cookie.  Chewy, decadent, and easy to make.  One caution...make sure the egg whites have reached room temperature, or they won't whip up to stiff peaks.  Teensy bit fussy to cut, but worth the work!  altogether a total 5-star recipe, thanks, Dinah!

Total hit.  I have to agree with other reviewers, though, that a little longer in lower heat for the second bake might have been good to set up the topping.  It was good, but kind of hard to eat because it was pretty gooey.  Maybe not a bad thing, though.  I gave them all away and now I'm sorry I did.

Didn't have a mixer, so I beat the meringue by hand for about 2 hours, it didn't quite get stiff enough, but I finished the recipe anyway and everyone loved it.  Soooo good

Ridiculously delicious!!  Not a big fan of almond so I left the paste out of the crust but otherwise followed the recipe.  These turned out amazing and will definitely be a new family favourite!

I made these bars for dessert, after dinner with my parents. I am a raspberry lover so I added more jam than was called for. They were soo delicious, a hit with everyone and something I will surely make again.

I used to make Rainbow Cookies every Christmas, but with 2 toddlers in the house, I was looking for an easier recipe to use the almond paste I had already bought.  These were fantastic, and tasted very similar to the rainbow cookies, but SO much easier!  Next year I'm going to sprinkle some chocolate shavings on them instead of coconut so they'll be even more similar to rainbow cookies.

Honestly I wasn't sure how these would work out- they looked beautiful but the meringue almost seemed like it would slide off the jelly - but they turned out lovely and very good!  I used a little more jam to spread over more evenly and it seemed like I might have used too much - but they ended up being a wonderful addition for my mother's christmas cookie exchange- thank you so much!

Yummy recipe. I tried it with another type of jam (homemade pineapple and peach). It ended up being too runny of a jam to use and made the crust soppy. It's still a great recipe though :)

So since I didn't have raspberry preserves I substituted triple berry jam. It complimented the almond flavor perfectly.  My guests & hubby loved it!

Yummy!  I had something like these Raspberry Almond Bars 30 years ago and have searched for the recipe all this time. Yaaay - finally found it!  I used 100% raspberry fruit spread, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and the bars were perfect. I took these to a cookie exchange over the holidays and everyone asked for the recipe. What more can you ask for?

Excellent! We loved the almond flavor that came through in the crust. I added about 2 cups of frozen raspberries to the jam to tang the filling up a little (personal preference). This was amazing! thanks for a great recipie!

Very simple to make!  It was good but I would prefer it with less crust and more raspberry.  The crust was more cake style and seemed to overtake the overall flavor.

Wow!!!  Best dessert I've baked in a very long time. Even my husband who is normally opposed to sweets, found himself sitting at the kitchen table with a fork just eating it like a meal!  Definitely a keeper and I"m not telling any of my friends or family about it so I can keep it a little secret of my own :-) Mwah ah ah ah ah ah!!!!

Beautiful and delicious! I used the Shortbread Cookies II recipe on this website for the cookie layer (not being a fan of almond), and I had to cook the shortbread layer a little longer before adding layers. I used parmchment paper for lining (instead of greased foil), and cut the bars directly in the pan with a plastic knife once cooled. They removed easily and were stunning!

I havent made a meringue before so I may have messed it up, but I am a seasoned baker and Im stumped why these turned out so incredibly soggy, they were actually swimming in liquid in the pan. I promise I followed the directions. Such a shame, they were so amazingly expensive to make.

I loved these! Everyone at work did too! I used blueberry preserves-my own and I think I would use more meringue too--the next day they drop a bit. I loved the almond flavor, this looked and tasted like it took forever!

I made the recipe exactly as written (almond paste and meringue) and it came out great (looked nice, too, with the coconut slightly browned).  There is a lot of sweetness (rich, not sticky) so cut them small (although I only was able to get 32, not 36).  I had a non-stick pan and I just sprayed some avocado oil in it and the bars came out fairly easily using a small plastic knife.  No greased foil.  The butter in the crust helped with that.  I brought them to work and they disappeared with rave reviews.

I teach Culinary Arts at a high school. Two of my students made these and they were delicious!! They did have to add cream of tartar to make the meringue stiff enough, but other than that, the recipe was great. Thanks, Dinah

I really like this combination of flavors and didn't find it too sweet. I only used half the butter and it was enough, so I recommend doing that, and then you can mix in more butter later 1 Tbsp at a time if you feel so inclined. Meringue was a cinch, just whip it up in a standing mixer till it looks like shaving cream. Only trouble I had was spreading it evenly, so some bars had more meringue than others.
