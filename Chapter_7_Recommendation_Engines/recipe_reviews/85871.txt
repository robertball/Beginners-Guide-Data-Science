hi, i submitted this recipe, and i've just realised that it's been misprinted!  it should have 2 large zucchini's in there, not 1!  and i use courgette's here in northern europe which tend to be much bigger than the zucchini's i've ever found in southern european countries or abroad.  hope this was of help! :)

This recipe was AWSOME! I substituted the zucchini with steamed broccoli instead. I just chose to throw it in when I threw in the pasta. It still came out excellent. I highly recommend this recipe to bleu cheese lovers!

Fabulous! We loved the flavor of this. Added a little flour to thicken up the sauce but otherwise wouldn't change a thing. Thank you.

I used spinach-flavored fettucine, which provided a great extra flavor element.  The blue cheese taste was surprisingly mild, in the best possible way.

I din't use the zucchini because I didn't have any. All in all I thought this was very good. Next time I will try adding chicken.

I actually made this some time ago and gave it 3 stars. But after more thought, I'm revising it to 2 (barely edible) and I'm going to add why. Something about the zucchini is horrible. I generally like zucchini, but sauteing(sp?) it made it squishy and well...horrible flavored. It utterly ruined the sauce, which would have been fine without the zucchini. I like raw zucchini and zucchini bread--my mom said this is just what cooked zucchini tastes like, nothing to be done for it, but I'm not sure. I've had cooked zucchini in other things in restaurants (usually stew) and it did not overwhelm in those dishes. So my thought here is this: make sure you liked the flavor of the sauteed zucchini BEFORE adding the rest of your ingredients. I don't know what to tell you if your zucchini is squishy and gross--but that will save you the ingredients for your cream sauce (which can be made just fine without zucchini if you need to). I wish I'd done that, we wound up throwing out more than half of this.

I substituted yellow squash for the zucchini - not as colorful but still delicious!

You absolutely must add flour - the recipe as it is makes a soupy salad dressing consistency. I used broccolli instead of zuchinni and linguini rather than fettucinni. It was OK, but I'm not sure it was worth the entire tub of blue cheese.

I really didn't think this was good at all. I followed the recipe to a tee, and I still thought it was pretty bad.  The worst part was the sauce, tasted dry...

Loved it! Put some mushrooms into the mix and it turned out great. Did sub olive oil for the butter and did add a little flour (just a pinch) to make the sauce a little thicker. I will be making this one again.

For such a simple dish, it's wonderfully fragrant, incredibly flavorful... I make it now at least once per week.  Absolutely superb.

Some helpful variations:  I like to add spinach fettucine nests, instead of regular fettucine.  The colors complement each other nicely.  I also add another zucchini.  But I don't mess with the base - it's perfect!!

This was super yummy!  Everyone in my family loved it - even my two year olds!  I did use half-n-half instead of heavy cream (it was what I had) and added some leftover rotisserie chicken.  A definite keeper!

Outstanding! I saut√©ed the zucc just before serving so it would still be crisp.  I also simmered the sauce  with a few parm rinds, so added just a smattering of grated on top. We actually had it twice in a row by request, ur demand, actually.

This is definitely a keeper! I sauted mushrooms along with the zucchini - and yum! I made it with %18 cream today, but I might try to use a can of evaporated milk next time to try and reduce the fat content. I also just used cooking wine from the grocery store. I'll add an update next time.

I thought the white wine quantity was too large.  The thickness of the sauce wasn't to my taste.

My whole family loved this recipe.  My husband wanted to drink the Blue Cheese sauce straight.  It was restaurant quality, but next time I will add another zucchini and maybe some starch or flour to thicken up the sauce a little.  (p.s. I grilled chicken separately and put it on top of the pasta and it was great).

Both my husband and I love blue cheese and we both found the sauce too over powering to eat more then a few bites.

Great recipe! I did use Feta instead of Blue Cheese though, which went really nicley. We served this with some grilled chicken and a ceasar salad, and the flavours went really nicely together :)

Instead of zucchini I used some sauteed spinach, onions, mushrooms and chicken.  As the picture has I used penne pasta too.  It was excellent!!!  I'll make this often.

I had to tweak the recipe a little just because of what I had on hand. I used half and half and then added some light cream cheese. I also added a little onion powder. My husband loved it. I did not tell him that it had blue cheese in it because he always says it stink! He guessed that it had the blue cheese and still liked it!
