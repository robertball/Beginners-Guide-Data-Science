I cut the recipe in half and after reading the other reviews added about a cup of skim milk to the mixture before baking...DELICIOUS!!  I've served it twice since making it for Thanksgiving and I always get asked for the recipe.  I use Stove Top stuffing on top and use reduced fat cheeses and alfredo sauce...you can't tell the difference.

I must have done something wrong becaue this casserole did not turn out creamy like I had expected. I followed the recipe to the word, but the first thing that didn't work was the size of the casserole dish. I used a larger dish than stated but still could not fit all the macaroni into the dish. I will try this recipe once again cutting back on the macaroni to 16 oz. I'm hoping that works because it does have a good flavor, but it's way too dry otherwise.

I cut the recipe in half because I knew from looking at the directions that it would not fit in a 9 x 13 pan as is.  I also added chicken to the recipe.  I poached some chicken breasts in chicken stock and once they were done I removed and boiled the macaroni in the remaining chicken stock.  I followed the directions for microwaving the sauce but added the shredded chicken before I mixed it with the macaroni.  Once I mixed the chicken, sauce and macaroni I had a feeling that it was going to be a little dry once it was baked but didn't make any correction.  After baking it was very dry.  The next time I make I will approximately a 1/2 cup of milk to the sauce before I combine with the macaroni.  Overall a great recipe, just add a little milk to the sauce.

What I did differently - I melted the alfredo and cheese in a skillet on the stove instead of the microwave method. I used an aluminum roasting pan 16 1/8 x 113/4 x 2 7/8 and it was the perfect size. I tried one jar of classic alfredo and one garlic alfredo. I'm not sure if it was the brand, but the garlic alfredo gave it an after taste so I will try a different brand or just classic from now on. First time I made it I drizzled a cup of 2% milk over the whole pan. It was very creamy. Second time I forgot the milk but luckily it was still creamy enough. I cooked it 40 minutes. I did not use breadcrumbs because I have never liked a crust on mac n cheese lol. It was delicious besides the after taste from garlic alfredo.

I just grabbed the large box of velveeta and didn't realize that it was 2 pounds instead of 1 pound. I figured you can never have too much cheese so I used it all. It turned out great. Super easy & yummy. It doesn't need to be cooked for as long as stated. 30 minutes is plenty of time.

Missed the mark. I followed the recipe exactly, the only difference is I used large pasta shells instead of macaroni noodles. The cheese sauce ended up tasting overwhelmingly of processed cheese and was just not creamy and delicious like I imagined. I will not be making again.

If you soak the breadcrumbs overnight in distilled white vinegar and red wine, it is much better and soggier. I have been in the food tasting business for 50 years now and it will always taste better with a hint of fish sprinkled on top.

My family reunion has a new favorite dish!
Sorry  Aunty, they just liked it better.!!
I know, but I'll share the secret of the canned alfredo sauce AFTER next year's event.  Maybe then the sting will have gone out of it for her

The recipe came out extremely dry and had little flavor. Maybe if the macaroni portion was cut in half the recipe may have come out halfway decent. I'm definitely not willing to try again though.

I was looking for a macaroni, cheese and sausage casserole like my wife used to make for me. 	It was my favorite comfort food. I happened upon this recipe and tried it just as the mac & cheese first. A hit with a bring-your-own-dish getogether, and it was heavy enough I figured it would work with the sausage added really well. This was my 2nd round and 	I used gluten-free macaroni and bread crumbs for my daughter. Still turned out great!

I changed the recipe a little. I split it in half and I did use 1 jar Alfredo sauce and  used the old English cheese spread ( it is found in the same area as Velveeta) I used a handful of shredded cheese and a half a box of macaroni and some Italian bread crumbs crumbs. My guys loved it!!! They are a picky bunch.

I made half the recipe since I was only feeding myself and another. I did not bake it and added about 1/3 cup of milk to make it creamier. Add more depending on how creamy you would like it. Otherwise it was delicious!

Every time I've made this recipie I used half the macaroni noodles recommended with everything else the same. At this ratio its rich, creamy and delicious. Also no bread crumb because breadcrumb on mac is not my cup of tea. Everyone I've made it for loves it. Giving a 4 star instead of 5 because I feel it calls for to much noodle.

Halved the recipe. Used scoobi doo noodles. One jar of alfredo sauce, one can of carnation milk,  half shredded cheddar and half shredded Mexican blend, also put in a pinch of cayenne pepper. I also just mixed it all in the pot I had boiled the noodles in while they were draining. BEST macaroni and cheese I've ever had! My company raved and asked to take home the leftovers. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

As written I'd have to give it one star. I ended up adding quite a bit of milk to the cheese sauce and it was still dry and not nearly as creamy as we like; maybe just personal preference. We did like the flavor.

I did like the addition of the alfredo. I also top mine with buttered cracker crumbs rather than just bread crumbs.

I cut everything in half and it made a 9x13 pan. Very good!
