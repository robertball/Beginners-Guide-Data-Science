I started with dry chickpeas, rather than canned.  After  cooking, I followed the directions, allowing to dry for about 45 minutes.  I spread them in a layer on a towel to get them as dry as possible.  Following the directions exactly the first time resulted in a very crunchy snack, which my toddler loved, but which did not hold any of the seasoning.  After that, I have added a little olive  oil and salt after the 2nd pan shaking (i.e. after 20 minutes cooking). Then finish cooking as directed.  Sometimes them I cook an extra  5 minutes- I think it depends how dry I get the chickpeas before roasting.  Leaving them to cool in the oven for 2 hours does result in chickpeas that stay crispy for several days.  I store them in a mason jar, and they have stayed crisp up to 2 weeks (as long as it takes my son to eat them).  This recipe and technique has resulted in a staple snack for us.  Thank you for sharing it!

I made these for my husband and he loves them! I made these exactly as written and seasoned them lightly with sea salt. Thanks for sharing.

Very good but didn't find the seasoning sticks so after the oven bit I tossed them with a touch of butter in a frying pan for a few minutes.  Next time, I'll do as another reviewer did and add olive oil, or butter, in the latter stages of the oven roasting

I've made these twice now and they're great for snacking and so much healthier than potato chips.

I baked them too long I think and they were too hard. I might try again, but the flavor wasnâ€™t there.
