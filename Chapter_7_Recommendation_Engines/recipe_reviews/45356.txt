What you have is a Sausage Gravy, not a Sawmill Gravy. What makes it Sawmill Gravy is CORNMILL. you add cornmill to give it a gritty taste like saw dust. Thats why itd called Sawmill Gravy.

i just made this gravy along with some biscuits and it was absolutly wonderful. The only adjustment i made was to cut the amount of sausage in half. 5 stars for this very very good sausage gravy!

Hmmmmm, well. I think that gravy is a very personal dish. And, whether someone likes it or not probably is tied to the region in which they live. For me, this recipe needs improvement. I cut the sausage into slices and set aside, reserving two patties to be crumbled and placed back in the gravy at the end. With the sausage being salty already, I think that the salt in the recipe is too much. I had to use more black pepper for our tastes than listed here and we don't care for the green onions. You have to play with flour and milk amounts so I think that that is understood by most gravy cooks. Also, speed of your wrist (stirring) and heat play a factor. By the way, you can sub ham for the sausage and call it red-eye gravy.

You can't go wrong with pork fat. Pay attention, and a secret my Grandma taught me. When it bubbles as big as hog eyes, its done (not to thick,not to thin)

Biscuits and sausage gravy are favorites, but when I tried this great sounding recipe it was very salty. I noticed there is over 50% of your day's sodium in just a single serving of this recipe. Seasoned sausage has plenty of salt in it, I would suggest adding a couple pinches of cracked pepper, and a pinch of either thyme or sage. I also let the flour gently brown a bit more than called for here, and used about twice as much gravy to sausage-it was wonderful. Thanks!

I grew up on this, but had forgotten about it until I saw your recipe Lloyd.  I cooked the onion a little before adding the flour.  The whole key to making this is to be patient with the flour and let it brown.  If the flour isn't brown, it won't be sawmill gravy!  When the gravy was thickened to my liking, I just added the crumbled sausage to it, spooned it over homemade biscuits, and topped each biscuit with a fried egg.  Thanks for the memories!  My Dad was a cook in the army and he made this all the time.

Simple! That's how a breakfast gravy should be! I was a bad boy and used all of the cooked off fat to make a huge batch of gravy, which did work out very well because I am a dyed- deep biscuits and gravy fan. The smoothness of this gravy made eating a pleasure- even without "corn mill". Thank you, LLoyd!

Easy, excellent, a classic. I would suggest, however, eliminating the salt from the recipe. The sausage (or the bisquits the gravy will eventally top) typically have plenty of sodium already.

This is close to what my grandmother made and it did bring back memories of the good ole days.  It really isn't that much different than other gravy recipes. The biggest difference is the browning of the flour. For breakfast Grandma would make this six days a week and on Sunday she would make white gravy. Thanks for the memories Lloyd.

Fell in love with Sawmill gravy when the family stop for breakfast at the Cracker Barrel heading through the states for vacation!  This was a good gravy but no where near the same.  The next visit to the Cracker I asked about the gravy and the wonderful server said Sawmill Gravy is made with Cornmeal.  This was still a good gravy, but found it too heavy for my morning but great for my porkchops!

Not too bad.  I left out the salt cause I always season to taste and I found it salty enough.  When my dad had it he said it was like the gravy that was served in a few of the work camps in the 30's.  He said it was tasty stick to your ribs good.

This was a very good recipe, even though I didn't have green onions for it. I just substituted regular onion. And then served on a plate of grits, ground beef, and eggs. Soooo Gooood!

gravy tasted ok but definitely wasn't 4 servings, barely two. Had to add double the milk to get the right consistency. I will not be making this again.

Overall good recipe.  I would use approx 1/4 cup flour and 1 cup of milk and 1/2 lb sausage.  Making the was as it appears in the recipe it is very thick and too much sausage.  I will make again with changes.

I make sausage gravy all the time. I can tell from the instructions that the proportions seem out of balance. I cook 1 lb of premium grade breakfast sausage but only half of  of the patties end up in the gravy. I chop those up in the pan with the spatula or one of those devices with the cross shaped end designed for the job . you should get 2 tablespoons of fat from the pound of Bob Evans or similar brands of whole hog sausage. That makes the ratio of fat correct to the two tablespoons of flour  but prevents this becoming  gravy coated sausage bits.  I tried this with the onions and all I can say is that they detract from the flavor of the sausage almost as badly as adding smoked bacon grease.  The recipe I use has been in my family for generations, the only thing new is that instead of homemade sausage we use Bob Evans or Aldi's premium.

Poor Lonzo has his facts all messed up. The only thing I challenge on this recipe is adding onions after the rue has browned. If you sweat your onions while the rue is already browned, it’s going to burn before the onions turn translucent. I recommend sweating the onions in the oil first, removing, adding back in 2 Tbs of fat. This way your rue stays nice and caramelized instead of burnt. I’ve lived in the South all my life where Sawmill gravy is the norm. I’ve never seen “cornmill”(rofl Lonzo), should be corn meal, in any gravy in my life. Unless it was Redeye gravy served in grits. I guess different strokes, different folks. It was uncalled for to add one star, though just because Lonzo thought it should have “cornmill”. Hahahaha!

Perfect Sawmill gravy. Don't know what Lonzo is talking about...maybe just trolling? Here in Mississippi this is how we make it; friends /family in Alabama and Louisiana make it this way too. Perhaps it's a regional thing, never heard of putting cornmeal in sawmill gravy.

Good recipe, the sausage gravy ratio is off, though. Either double the gravy or half the sausage.

4 out of 5 only because I didn't use pork. I started with butter and cooked some chopped mushrooms and onion, then followed recipe for gravy. I've always had trouble getting my white gravy to the right thickness. Even without the pork, it totally hit the spot over some egg on fresh biscuits. I also used more pepper, but that's personal preference.
