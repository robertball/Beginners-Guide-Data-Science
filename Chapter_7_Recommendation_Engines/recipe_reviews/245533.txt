12-22-15 ~ Easy and delicious - the best kind of cookie/candy!  I made this for our Cookie/Candy Exchange 2015.  I made one batch with toasted pecans and one batch without.  Both were equally as good as the other.  I even sprinkled a little sea salt on some of them.  I drizzled the chocolate with a spoon for the striped look.  A great recipe that I would make again.  They were a hit with the girls in the cookie exchange.

Don't microwave the chocolate chips, add them while candy is in the oven.  If not completely melted when you remove from oven, simply cover the pan with a cookie sheet to contain the heat and let the chocolate melt, then smooth with a decorating knife.  

Also, don't cool in the refrigerator.  The candy and the chocolate cool at different rates and will often separate.  If you are experiencing the candy and chocolate coming apart, allow cooling slowly without refrigeration - it won't happen.

Another tip:  After smoothing the chocolate with a knife creating a nice wavy pattern, drag a toothpick through the chocolate to create even nicer designs or even write in the chocolate.

I've also been making this deliciousness for years.  It's pretty addictive.  I usually use semisweet chips though and mostly out of laziness, I sprinkle the chips on top immediately out of the oven and spread when melted.  So yummy.

Very disappointed!  Sounds easy but the chocolate chips did not melt in microwave after 3 minutes .  Finally put the whole thing in the oven to melt the chips.

Love it and so did the Super Bowl Party.   Only thing I did different was melt the chocolate in the microwave.  I'll definitely make it again!!

I made this and followed instructions but when it was cooked, the caramel part that was poured was still gooey. Was not sure if it's suppose to be that  way.

Made this a couple days ago.  Very easy.  I will likely make again.  I melted the chocolate chips (I used the milk chocolate and added what was left from a bag of dark chocolate [probably less than 1/2 c.]) in the same sauce pan used for the brown sugar and butter.  As long as one keeps it on a very low temp and stirs, it won't burn.  Next time I make this, I may just sprinkle the chocolate chips on the bars after baking.   The heat from the toffee mix will likely melt the chocolate until it can be spread with a spatula.  

A few months back I tried another recipe very similar to this but I think it called for semi-sweet or dark chocolate and it also had sliced or slivered almonds on top.  One could dress up this particular recipe with nuts as well and perhaps a little sea salt.
