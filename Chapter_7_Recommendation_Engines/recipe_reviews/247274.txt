Overall this was good. I plan to make it again, but I will cut  back on the milk. I thought it really only needed a couple tablespoons. With the yogurt included, it was too milky for me. I didn't make the veggie cubes, but I really like that idea and plan to try it. Instead, I just used a little bit of fresh spinach and avocado. It made quite a big serving that I drank for lunch. Thanks! PS: I just realized I forgot to add the blueberries. It made such a large serving, I didn't really need them, but blueberries would have probably made the color a little prettier.
