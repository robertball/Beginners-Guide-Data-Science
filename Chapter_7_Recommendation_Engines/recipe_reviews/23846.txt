This was a very good starter recipe but it definitely needs a few extra ingredients to make it yummy!  I omitted the peas and added diced celery, green onions, cubed cheddar cheese, and sweet relish.  It needed a lot of seasoning and I used mayo, horseradish sauce, seasoning salt, garlic salt and pepper.  With all the additions it turned out great!

Since there are only 2 of us now..we use 1 drained can GOOD quality Albacore tuna in water, 1cup dry small shell pasta cooked and drained. Add a couple of dashes of dill weed,salt, pepper, and if desired dry minced onion or onion powder to taste, only one diced egg, 1 or 2 stalks of celery thinly sliced,(taste and adjust Mayo and seasonings) 1/2 cup cubed mild cheddar cheese, and 1/2 can drained canned peas (or 1 cup frozen peas cooked,drained and cooled)..have to fold in gently after it's all mixed well. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.

This was a good salad, however it really needs the celery and green onions for texture and flavor. I felt the dressing needed something, so I added 3T of bottled Caesar dressing and a teaspoon of prepared horseradish sauce. Thanks Ann.

The very basic of all Tuna salad recipes.  Try adding some or your own ingredients (ie. celery, onions) to make this recipe complete.

This is such a quick and easy meal.  It definitely needs chopped onion for flavor.  I also added a little lemon juice, some curry powder, and shredded cheddar cheese and it was delicious!

This was nothing spectacular, just a very basic macaroni salad recipe.  It definitely needs celery for that extra crunch.  I added some spices, celery salt, cayenne, and garlic powder to kick it up a bit, as well as a bit of ranch dressing mixed in with the mayo.  It was good with the additions, but very basic and bland without them.  This recipe needs some work, but it's a good starting point.

Great recipe.  I didn't measure the mayo but rather dumped in tablespoons until I got the right consistency.  I also added a little milk to make it a little creamier and a little onion adds a little crunch too.

This is good, it was a little dry for my particular taste, but no biggie, I just added a little more mayo.  I also used canned chicken breast (Swanson) instead of the tuna to please my picky children.  Next time, I'll add some diced green onion.  Thanks for sharing Ann!

"Good" and basic cold pasta salad. My boyfriend wouldn't touch it - he's not a huge fan of tuna but everyone else seemed to enjoy it. I used miracle whip instead of mayo (and added to taste). Also, I added a jar of diced pimentos for color and some chopped celery for some crunch. A good side to our homemade sub sandwiches.

I really liked this recipe. It took me a little less prep time than the recipe called for. It was extremely simple and my two children, 5 and 7, enjoyed making it with me. And it is a very yummy cold pasta salad. Great for picnics. Can whip up in a flash!

This was a great starter recipe.  I added green onions and celery for flavor and crunch, and just a bit of garlic salt.  Use enough mayo for the consistency you want - not an exact science.  I found out the hard way that it's better to use smaller noodles!  Mini-shells or rings work best.  A tip for eggs if you're not a seasoned veteran: Use older eggs (they're easier to peel), put them in cold water, then put the pot with the eggs on the stove.  Once it boils, simmer 1 minute, cover, and remove from heat.  Let sit 15 minutes then put them in cold water to stop cooking.  You can't go wrong!

I know a lot of people have issues with folks reviewing after modifications, but that's what I'm doing.  :-)  I used two eggs instead of one, discarding the yolks (don't need the extra cholesterol).  I used only one package of tuna.  I added one stalk of celery, and a bit of onion -- both chopped.  I put my frozen peas in the colander, and drain the pasta right over them.  This elimanates a step.    For the dressing, I used about half reduced fat Miracle Whip, and half reduced fat sour cream.  I'm not a big fan of Miracle Whip, but I find I prefer it to mayo for most salads.  I increased the overall quantity, because I don't like a dry macaroni salad.  I added a little milk, to add moisture, and some zesty Italian dressing until it tasted right to me.  I completely eliminated the extra salt and pepper.    Lots of modifications, I know.  But I appreciate the original recipe, because it is a good basic recipe and versatile enough to accept everyone's changes.  I'll try this again, and I'll probably try other changes based on my family's comments.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

My husband doesn't care for celery or onion so I thought this would be the perfect salad for him. I made it last night to let all the flavors meld together. Unfortunately when I tried it earlier today I was kind of disappointed. It's an extremely, extremely bland salad. I would definitely add a lot more salt than it calls for (and I'd add it to the pasta with a little oil and maybe a little vinegar too) and it needs more dressing. I even used a couple tablespoons of milk to thin it out so it would cover all the pasta, but today it's really dry. With a lot of modifications, this could probably be pretty delicious but as is it's just very mediocre.

Hubby and I loved this.  I made it tonight along with a bunch of other stuff I was prepping for our weekend camping trip...it was so good we decided to have a little tonight for dinner and had to stop eating so we'd have some left for the weekend.  I prepared pretty much as written with the exception of using 6 oz of frozen peas instead of 5 oz one 6 oz and one 7 oz can of tuna instead of two 6 oz just because that was what I had on hand and I added a little more mayo for some extra moistness with the extra tuna and peas, maybe an extra tablespoon or two.  I could see substituting grilled salmon for the tuna, possibly adding some cheese, but honestly it doesn't need anything more.  I just recommend you taste it first before you start adding extras, but I can understand adding extras to suit your taste.

It's a very good base recipe.  I add minced onions and celery and some ranch dressing for more flavor.  It goes very well with whole wheat rotini.

Great starter recipe, definitely need to add some spices, etc.  I added extra mayonnaise so it wouldn't be dry and spiced it up with some garlic powder and celery salt.  Yummy!

This was a really refreshing change to the same ole tuna salad.  I have made this on more than one occasion and usually add bacon, shredded cheddar, and a little sour cream.  I have also made this recipe using canned chicken as well.  Great recipe!! Thanks :)

I added 2 chopped stalks of celery, onion powder, used twice the salt and pepper, and used miracle whip instead of mayonaise, which I also used twice as much of, and it still felt like it was missing something. I will try it with tomatoes the next time.

An excellent starter recipe, and I have been looking for more cold pasta recipes, but I agree with the other reviews, it does need onion, celery, and seasonings. With the additions its great!

safe to bring to potlucks. Some people don't like certain things in their salads. I even omit the peas sometimes so the kids will eat it.

Following this recipe as written results in a very bland salad with no texture so I give this only 2 stars. I ended up doctoring it up a bit by adding 1/2 onion diced, 1 carrot (chopped) a little dill and sugar and much more salt and pepper.  After doing that, the outcome is superb!

This is a really good pasta salad. I added half a red onion, cheddar cheese (chunked), a little bit of reduced fat ranch dressing, and some garlic and basil powder. My Mom came in just as I was setting it in the fridge and got a bowl of it warm. Then she started raving about how good it tasted! My Mom does not cook, but asked me for recipe so that she could make it herself! You've got a winner here.

My dad used to make this simple recipe every summer and to this day I crave it when the weather starts to warm up.  As an adult I have added fresh red peppers, onion and celery just to boost the nutrition a little, but the recipe stands on it's own. The frozen peas add that yummy sweetness.

This was a good recipe but I did add lettuce and diced tomatoes. Omitted the peas since my husband doesn't like them. It ended up really good we couldn't stop eating it.

Kinda boring. It's a good base recipe but it lacks kick. I added 1/2 a diced onion and a couple tablespoons of italian dressing. Turned out awesome with the additions.

This was pretty good, but as others said it needs the celery and green onion. I had to eat it with crackers to get a little more flavor, so some extra seasonings would help. it was nice to have a big bowl of this in the fridge though, I ate it every day for lunch.

Here's what I did.  Didn't have peas on hand so I added a can of chick peas, 1/2 teasp. of cumin and a handful of fresh parsley.  Didn't add the hard boiled eggs, made them on the side, (deviled eggs) It was a nice cool and delicious dinner, had some sliced fresh tomato's on the side too.  Very good.

I have been looking for a recipe for this salad for a while...and this comes closest to the one I remember growing up. Very easy to prepare. Only difference is that I omitted the eggs. For some reason, I love to eat it with a little Thousand Islands Dressing!

Take out the eggs, half the tuna and add some salad shrimp and this is how my family (from Hawaii) has done mac salad for many years.  The flavors are really simple, but it's a little taste of home.  Every now and then someone throws in some grated carrot... that's good too.

My husband is not a fan of mayo, so we used miracle whip instead. We thought it was good, but this needs some added spices to it, like onions, and garlic powder. Next time I'll tweak the recipe a little.

This is a good basic recipe to start with before adding more to it. I added celery, vadilia onion, green pepper, Ranch dressing, Cajun Shake, Garlic Powder, Season Salt, Horseradish sauce. It tastes awesome! This is a winner! Thanks for the basic!

This has long been one of my favorite pasta salads...my mom made it when I was younger, butw that I'm working full-time, it is one of the best make-ahead lunches I've found yet!  Add mayonaisse to taste...I don't like much, but my husband is a HUGE mayo fan and always douses his portions with an extra heap.  Green pepper is another colorful addition.

This reminds me of a tuna salad my great aunt Dorothy would make for every family occasion. Canned peas work just fine. My hubby doesn't like onion so onion powder is a milder substitute for us. Otherwise, no changes.

Some of the bet recipes are those that can be built upon.  In my opinion, this needed a lot more mayo than what was called for (I used 3/4 to 1 cup.  I also used a packet of albacore white tuna instead of the two cans called for, a little more salt and a lot more pepper, and about 1/3 cup of dill pickle juice for a little zing.  Delicious!!!!!

So simple and tasty! I used canned peas as I didn't have any frozen ones. I also used smoked tuna filets instead of canned tuna. I added some curry, celery, chives, cheddar cheese and some sweet pickle juice.

Didn't imagine it will turn out this good. Its very simple and fulfilling, the pasta, tuna, eggs and peas blended well togther. I added green onions and green bell peppers too. But I think next time will add more spices or mustard for a tangy taste. I think yellow corn would be great with it too will definetly do it again :)

I would give it a 5, but I added a lot.  The recipe was a great starter.  I used elbow macaroni and added the dill weed, some onion, and bacon bits to make it a little fuller.  It came out great!  My fiance ate it all weekend while he worked outside.  I'll definitly make it aagin.

This is a good base recipe.  In order to make it more like what my Mom made, I added extra peas, a chopped up onion, chopped celery, cayenne pepper and dill.  Also needed more mayo than what it called for.  Next time I'll try replacing some of the mayo with ranch dressing.  A few tablespoons of milk really helps make it creamier.

This is a good idea, but definitely needs more spices and veggies.  I add garlic powder, celery salt, paprika, celery, and chopped carrots.

Love this salad.  Very similar to the deli's.  But it definetely needs more dressing, I used miracle whip out of personal preference.  i also added more salt and pepper or it was pretty bland.  I chunked up some cheddar cheese and through that in also.  Took it to a pot luck over lunch and had many compliments on it.

I made changes to this after reading the other reviews.  I added onion and used nature's seasoning and lemon juice.  I also used light mayo.  I will make this again the same way but will omit the peas as I didn't care for them.  I might try celery or carrots instead.  My husband loved it though especially with the onion!

I don't like tuna, and I liked this recipe! I have to admit, though, it was a little bland. I added a pinch of garlic powder and it was *still* kind of bland, but you know what, for a cold macaroni salad that I didn't even think I'd like, it was pretty darn good!

This is a good basic recipe, but very plain.  Added gr. pepper and Mrs. Dash, and still very bland.  We preferred the tuna salad with dill from this site.

After reading the other reviews,I decided to add ranch dressing for more kick(used less mayonnaise)generous amounts of garlic salt and pepper,and tossed broccoli florets and bell pepper instead of the peas.It turned out delicious!

I added carrot, onion, and a tomato. Left out peas, then it tasted just like how my mother made tuna salad when I was a child. Sorry, I forgot, celery.

I made this for my husband but he wasn't fond of the tuna, so I substituted the tuna for chicken and it came out great! I also added some onion, walnuts and a dash of paprika for a little kick and it came out delicious.

My family ate this weekly in the 80s and 90s.  I didn't know it was a "real" recipe until now!  It is simple comfort food.  Can be jazzed up with more veggies (if desired and in budget).

This is the simple tuna/mac I've been looking for. I took the submitters suggestions with the extras of onion and celery. I took a reviewers suggestion of dill and added some dill relish. I also added a bit of other salad dressings to the mayo (ranch, other).  I just finished my first bowl. Very good, thank you!

No taste!  It looked good right after I made it but it tells you to let it sit.  Once it's cold, the moisture gets sucked up in the noodles (?), and it's just boring.  You can't taste the mayo, you can't really taste the egg.  I just taste the noodles very plain.

Not sure what it was but we didn't care for this one.  The pasta overpowered the other ingredients, maybe less pasta would make it a little better, not sure but will not try this one again.

i made this yesterday b/c i had a craving for a pasta salad with tuna for some reason! very tasty. i used almost a whole pound of pasta and therefore doubled the mayo. i also added a tablespoon or two of mustard, relish and horseradish. next time i don't know if i'd bother withe mustard. sprinkled a healthy serving of garlic powder too - very tasty - this is a great recipe to get started with and add as you like:)

This recipe is a good start, but you definitely have to add more stuff to make it good.  I added red onion, celery and ranch dressing.  It was good that way.

I generally leave out the peas, and add about a tablespoon or two of white vinegar and a few tablespoons diced up dills. (sounds weird, but it works..)

good starting point. in place of table salt, i added simply organic all-seasons salt (which consists of sea salt, paprika, cane sugar, garlic, onion, celery, oregano, & tumeric), and used minced shallot for a milder flavor than white or red onion. in the past i have also used less of the all-seasons salt and added a few TBS of ranch dressing. yum!

I really like this simple recipe. I chose it because I had everything on hand for it. It is a little blah, but you can add so many different things to jazz it up! I added peppercorn ranch and some garlic powder- it turned out great! Everyone loved it. This is a great easy recipe to make for get togethers or BBQs.

I thought as written this came out quite dry....it also needed more spices-it's bland.  Can easily be fixed into a good meal with some tweaking.

I would substitute the  mayonnaise by Italian sauce. The more you use, less dry it would be. I also prefer using quails egg (in Brazil it easy to find).

This was okay.  It seemed to be missing something and was dry as others stated.  Much better once I added more mayo and garlic salt.  Not sure I would make again.  Thanks for letting us try

This recipe is good but pretty dry compared to most macaroni salads.  I doubled the amount of mayo that was called for and even added 1 Tbsp of milk, but was still pretty dry.  The taste was good though, I added some sweet relish, some diced Cheddar cheese, and a few sprinkles of Seasoning Salt.  Next time I'll be sure to either add more mayo, or cut all of the other ingredients in half except for the mayo that's called for (makes too much salad for just my husband and I anyway).  Thanks for the recipe.

I think this is a great recipe.
I really love to subtitute canned chicken, throw in some celery, season salt and dill. Success.
Great with tuna, chicken or ham and cubed cheese.

I LOVE this recipe - with pickles!  If it's too dry, try adding some of the water from the tuna before you drain it.  Great for an afternoon snack, easy to throw together, and you can "guestimate" to your tastes.  YUM!

YUM!  I grew up on this stuff, and have been making it for years.  I personally would love it with the tuna, but my husband won't touch it so I have to use chicken.  It's still delicious.  My picky children won't touch it, but that just leaves more for us!!  If we have it for dinner, it tastes even better the next day for lunch.  This recipe is really good just as is.  Sometimes I will throw in shredded cheese, or seasoned salt or lemon pepper or whatever.  It just depends on how I feel.  What it is is a good, simple recipe to have on hand.  Nothing gourmet, just simple.  Wonderful on those really hot summer evenings when the last thing you want to do is cook (although we eat it year-round).  It takes so little time, and if you make it early in the day, dinner is done!!  That way it will be good and cold by the time you sit down for dinner.  Really good with fresh fruits on the side, as well as the cracker assortment Ann suggested.

Not too bad.  I went with celery instead of the peas.  I used a bit more mayo than the recipe called for.  I did find that it was still a little dry.  Think I might try it again with some of the suggestions of adding a little ranch dressing, and maybe a few more spices.  Does make a fairly easy prepare ahead lunch though.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best either.  I thought that it was on the dry and flavorless side.  If I should make this particular recipe again, I'll be adding more mayo, salt and pepper (it's a pain to add it in the dish I'm going to eat it out of, because when I stir it in, food falls out, ugh).

I have been looking for a good tuna pasta salad and have found it in this recipe.  Made this for a Mother's Day luncheon.  Followed recipe exactly, will make again and will probably add some celery next time.

Great recipe. Very similar to what I was used to as a child. I too used the sea shell macaroni as well as Miracle Whip. I also add some celery salt, as I can not STAND the crunchy texture of celery in a dish. (Love it by itself though!)To me, this dish is best when it's been in the fridge for a couple of hours and is nice and cold. You may have to add a little more miracle whip, as it tends to get soaked up by the macaroni. This is a good thing though...flavors infused. BTW...it's not supposed to be the life-of-the-party, folks...only a side dish. It's ok if it's 'simple'...it's supposed to be! :o)

Good recipe to use as a base. I didn’t measure anything out (as I didn’t want a full amount) but I did make a few changes. 
Miracle whip instead of mayo, slowly added til it was the right wetness. I only used the egg whites (diced). Peas to desired amount and salt and pepper to taste. 
I DID NOT CHILL BEFORE EATING! So if you are on a time crunch or you want to enjoy this right after it’s done, there are a few things you can do to make sure it’s not warm. 
Rinse cooked noodles in ice cold water. Make sure to cook the noodles al dente, as with any pasta salad. Keep the miracle whip, peas, and eggs in the refrigerator until your ready to use. If you are not precooking the eggs, soak in ice water to rapid cool. If you make these changes you can enjoy your pasta salad right after it’s mixed. 

ONCE REFRIGERATED... it WILL lose some flavor and wetness. So you will want to add a little extra miracle whip, salt, and pepper prior to serving. If you keep this in mind then you can be prepared and avoid that bland flavor. 

You can add anything you want (onions, celery, etc) but I would even consider adding some dill pickle juice to give some extra zest. 

Would use this recipe again

Very popular in our house.  My grandmother used to make an almost identical version of this (the recipe got lost over the years) and tasting this was a bit of old home.  My wife had never had anything like this before and was absolutely head over heels.  This will be an often repeated dish for us, especially in the summer months as a cool, easy meal.

Was looking for a recipe close to my aunt's that she would always bring to the family potlucks. This was it... minus the mini shrimp. Just add some & Presto!! Then we ate, & it was spot on. Thanks for the memories!

Like the others, I had some add ins, celery, red bell pepper and onion.  It was very good, my 12 year old took seconds and she doesn't usually do that and then made the comment that I need to make this more often.  I liked the idea of hard boiled eggs, I would have never thought of that and it really added some flavor.

This is a great basic/starter tuna mac salad recipe.  You can add whatever you want to make it yours.  I rated it having followed the recipe with the exception of the sweet relish. Sweet relish and tuna didn't sound too good to me.  I did use more mayonnaise because a 1/4 cup was nowhere near enough.  Perhaps that was because I used rotini and not elbow or small shell pasta.  After I added the things I normally use to make mac salad, it was very good.

I love pasta salad and this recipe was great!It was so easy to make it really is something I can make every week and enjoy for a day or two. I added some lime to it and it gave it an extra kick in flavor. Thank You!
