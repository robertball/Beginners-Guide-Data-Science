I have to give this a 5 star!  I was looking for a recipe that emulated Martin's potato rolls. This didn't, however I loved the texture.  It was light and fluffy, yet had a heavier mouth-feel than I expected.  Very good.  The flavor isn't a strong potato flavor that I was going for, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The texture is also very good as hamburger buns.  My suggestion is to add a little more potato and instead of shortening, add vegetable or canola oil.  I also kneeded it for about a half hour, just because I got lost in thought and realized it when I looked at the clock.  proofed very nicely in a bowl using any pan spray with a damp towel draped across the top. personally, I let my breads proof in a warmed oven, and they rise amazingly well.  I took half of the recipe and made rolls, and the other half made a twist bread out of. (rolled it into an inch thick rectangle, cut the half dough in half, twisted two pieces, and repeated with the other side.   placed them side by side in the loaf pan tucking the ends under.  I'll take a picture before I slice into it.  I also use a double-egg wash.  1 egg with a tablespoon of water while dough is well... dough.  then just before finishing I brush it again.  

All in all, very well done, and tasty.  I can say it was a LOT easier to make in the kitchenaid mixer with a dough hook than it would have been to make by hand, but hey if you want to, go for it.

WOW!! This bread is amazing!  Some reviewers said that their bread was dense, but my bread was incredibly light (perhaps because I let them rise a little longer on the second rise).  It is soo tender!  My family really enjoyed this recipe...the bread it produced was my best yet.

This is my favorite bread.  I've made it twice in the past two weeks.  The first batch I replaced 1/2 cup of the water with milk, which I scalded and added  butter instead of the oil called for.   The second time I used only the water called for.  I think using the milk makes a more tender loaf.  I got two beautifully risen, light and fluffy loaves from this recipe using only about 5 cups of flour.  What I like most about this bread is the flavor.  The yeast does not overpower the bread's flavor, it's more of a back note, which I think is perfect.  I used the rapid rise yeast and reduced the amount to 3 1/2 tsp.  Thanks, Judy, this will be made again and again, my family absolutely loves it...and so do I.
.
BTW:..Do not expect this bread to taste like potatoes.  Potato has a very neutral flavor.  It's purpose is to fuel the yeast and add moisture and lightness to the bread.  Make sure you use only enough flour to produce a slightly tacky feeling dough if you want the bread to turn out light and fluffy.  About 5+/- cups of flour should work.  Again, feel the dough, it should be smooth and tacky, not sticky.

Very hearty bread.  I used butter instead of shortening and unbleached wheat flour.  Very flavorful and espcially good right out of the oven.

YUMMY Bread! I've been looking for a potato bread recipe for years and this is it. I made this to go with some Guinness Stew and it was fantastic. I cut back the salt to half and couldn't manage to work in all the flour, but the bread was still solid but not heavy and SO delicious.

This was delicious! I made it today to go along with Thanksgiving dinner. Very moist. Would make again. One thing I might mention is that I used only 5 cups of the 6.5 cups of flour called for and even that was stretching it. Not sure why. Maybe because it's so dry out here in West Texas!?

This is a great bread, it's also quite easy to do.  I made a change, and would make another, but a wonderful basic recipe.  My Aunt won the Colorado State Fair when she was in high school with a potato bread.  I didn't have the recipe available, but I remembered that it used dry milk.  So I added in 2 Tbsp dry milk, and it make it very sweet and smooth.  The change that I would make is one suggested by another reader.  She let hers rise longer before baking it to make it lighter.  I agree, you should double the time on the second rise.  I made it 50% longer, and I wish it was a little more.  Also, be warned you can only make 2 cups of potato from 1 potato if you have a huge tuber.  I had to make up the difference with some emergency instant mashed potatoes.  So I would correct it to say 1 very large, or 2 medium potatoes.  With just a few tweaks, you will LOVE this simple bread.  It makes great rolls too!  (Just make sure to cut baking time down to 20 min).

Delicious bread! Soft and fluffy with a chewy crust. My second rise did take a bit longer for the dough to double in size (about 40 min) but make sure you are using the correct type of yeast! "Active dry" and "rapid rise" yeast do have different baking methods and you may have problems with the rising process if you try and interchange them. I used closer to 5 c of flour, but a lot of that depends on your humidity, how much water you added to the potato mix, etc. Getting the texture of the kneaded dough right (soft and elastic) is much more important then trying to get in all 6 1/2 c of flour. I brushed an egg wash over the tops and they were a little darker then I would have liked within 40 min so next time I will check it a little earlier. I will definately be making this again!

I made this as dinner rolls instead of a bread, and they were fabulous. They had a nice crisp crust on the outside and a soft, airy center. The recipe makes enough for about three dozen batches if you make small rolls. I added a little garlic salt for more flavor. Next time I might use a little more potato.

Great recipe!  I took advice from another reviewer and added more potato (2.5 cups) and used oil instead of lard.  I also like to proof the yeast first, so added the yeast to the warm potato water with sugar and let it work it's magic for about 20 minutes.  I worked in about 5.5 cups of flour and let it rise in an oiled bowl for about 90 minutes.  After punching it down and working in a little more flour, dividing into 2 loaf pans, I ended up with 2 loaves that just burst out of the pans.  We'll be enjoying super sized delicious bread for a week or so.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

Excellent bread.  I tweaked it a bit.  I used bread flour. Five and a half cups and butter instead of shortening.  Used milk to come up to 2cups, as I remember my mother using milk in her potato bread.  I also added wheat gluten.  The result was light and fluffy.  My husband said this was his favorite bread.  Thank you for the posting.

This bread is very delicious. I tweaked it a bit. I added about a 1/4 c. of milk and then used all of the flour. It produced a very soft loaf. I made it in a boule (round) shape and it was very beautiful. the other loaf I made in a loaf pan, and it was not so pretty but still very yummy. Can't wait to see what my co-workers think!

This is my standard recipe for pizza crust dough. I tweeked it a little by adding less salt and a little more sugar. I use the quick rise yeast instead of the active-dry yeast. I preheat my oven to the warm setting and then shut it off right before I put the bowl of dough, covered with a moist towel, in to rise.  I never have trouble with the dough not rising. I just love the flavor of this bread.  Very Good!

This bread came out wonderful. Light. Flavorful. Perfect. I made two changes. I mixed the salt in with the dry flour and I used butter instead of shortening. Delicious!

I substituted unsalted sweet cream butter for shortening; and brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also used unbleached flour. I could only work in 5 cups of dough and I overbaked mine (baked it for 41 minutes) and the outer crust came out pretty dark. The taste inside is excellent though!

I make bread alot, at least once a week by hand, but this is my first potato bread. The recipe was very good except for a couple things. First, it isn't very specific about the potato. My potatos were about medium sized, about 4 inches long, and it didn't seem like very much so I used 2 of them. I think I could have used 3. Second, I think it is too much salt, and I'm a person who usually uses more salt than called for. I used 1 tbsp as called for, and was dissapointed that salt was the breads dominant flavor. I will cut the salt in half next time. Third, this doesn't really make 2 loaves. After I took out a very small amount of dough to fry in a pan for my breakfsast, (my favorite breakfast since childhood) I had enough dough left for one good sized loaf. If you really want 2 large loafs, double the recipe. Otherwise a good recipe and will use it again.

One of my favorite bread recipes, ever since I found it on this site last year.  This is a very moist bread, and goes really well with a thick beef stew.

This was so good, and it impressed my family.  They asked me if I used instant mashed potatoes, and I proudly told them, nope, I used real potatoes.  Every last bit of this bread was gone in a day.

This is a great bread recipe!  My mom loves a particular potato bread she buys at the farmer's market, and I was trying to duplicate it.  This was very close!  I left the potatoes a little "chunky" instead of mashing completely, and I reduced the salt to one teaspoon, and it tasted fine.  I had to cut the baking time quite a bit, the loaves were ready in about 30 minutes.  I liked the recipe so much that I made two batches today, one batch for my mom and one batch for my hubby and son to enjoy, which they did!  Thanks!

Ok, this bread is so yummy it turned out great to me. Mine did not raise much but that's cause I did not let the water cool so make sure you do that. Other then that it is very good!

This was a great recipe. family loved it and its one of the simpler potato bread recipes. Like many others I found that about 5 cups of flour, give or take, worked best. This is now my go to recipe when I have company coming over.

Very dense texture as other reviewers have said, but I did only add part of the yeast so that could be why. The bread turns out very moist and isn't too crumbly which I love.

My first time making bread at all and it turned out very well.  The crust was a little harder than I wanted but will cover with foil a little bit earlier next time and that should help.  A little more denser than expected too, but I think the foil will help with that also.

This recipe makes a nice dense, chewy bread. While some reviewers didn't care for the chewiness, I like it. It's reminiscent of the texture of French bread without the crispy crust. I think I should've left the loaves to rise a bit longer in the pans to get more height but other than that I liked how this bread turned out.  It's best when eaten shortly after baking, in my humble opinion. The following day the denseness of the bread made it heavy and not as satisfying to eat (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5). I intend to try toasting it which is my way of taking care of day old bread ;) FYI: I made only one small change to the ingredients and that was to use butter instead of shortening. I also used my mixer instead of kneading by hand. The dough was very soft but manageable when turned out onto a generously floured board.

My husband and I usually buy potato bread at the store. I got the idea to make it last night and it wurned out great. it is just moist enough to eat alone or with some butter or dry and sturdy enough for thin sandwich slices. I made 1 really large loaf and 4 smaller "dinner" rolls. This bread rose SO BIG. I put it in the oven with only the pilot light on. It tastes wayyyy better than any store bought bread! I had to use 2 small potatoes. I would like to add in this review (for search purposes) that this is a vegan bread with out milk and egg. I had a hard time finding a good vegan potato bread when I searched.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year at my mother-in-laws. It was the first yeast bread I'd made in a while, but it turned out pefect. The instructions are very easy to follow and all the amounts were accurate. Everyone loved it, even my husband who isn't really into bread.

This is very good, hearty bread. I used 1 1/2 cups less flour, and it still was too heavy and thus it didn't rise as well. It ia so good though . . . both loaves where gone before they had time to cool!

Since potato size differs, I used two. After setting aside 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid, I seperated the cooked potatoes from the rest of the water, mashed the potato and used 1 1/4 cup mashed potato and 3/4 cup cooking liquid to make the potato mixture. This worked perfectly for me and if you are nervous about having inconsistent results, I hope it works for you too.

I have made this recipe twice now.  This recipe makes a beautiful, golden brown loaf of bread.  I did use margarine instead of shortening and the potatoes were cooked with fat-free chicken broth and some fat-free evaporated milk.  My daughter's favorite bread has always been my homemade honey wheat bread.  This is now her favorite and she wants to try it made with sweet potatoes.

Amazing :) I did accidentally scald the yeast the second time I made this recipe causing bread to become a brick once cooked.  It was still tasty but was more like a moist cracker.

I liked this recipe and it was very very yummy, but not the BEST i've ever had.  Just a tad blan, but not much!  I did double the potato it called for, but this made it a little more dense.  I also got a little impatient after the 2nd rising and now think it would've been fluffier if i would've waited 40 min instead of 30 min.

This was absolutely wonderful.  It came out so soft!  I did end up using quite a bit less flour like other reviewers mentioned, and it took a little longer to rise, but my house is cold and that isn't unusal.

This bread doesn't last long around here.  I made it with leftover mashed red potatoes and I was a bit worried about how heavy and dense the dough was, but it turned out lovely.  Made it again with the same great results.  Soft yet substantial, great flavor.

Had leftover mashed potatoes, so I made this. I used 2 cups of mashed and 1 1/2 cups warm water, followed the recipe for the rest. It was awesome! Nice crust with soft yummy inside. I put a cinnamon sugar swirl in one of the loaves. A keeper!

I went ahead and made this recipe just guessing because I have two entries for 3 tablespoons of flour and that's it.   it doesn't explain the measurements at all on anything my bread turned out fine but had I not made bread before I would've had any idea how to use this recipe

Turned out a little heavy and missing something in flavor but all and all as written a good basic starting point.

I don't often make my own bread so it was a huge time commitment and my arm got tired from kneading, but the recipe was perfect and totally worth it in the end! I used a whisk attachment during the mixing phase and let it rise a little longer for both rise times and it came out very tender, soft but sturdy and rose well. You have to work on the outside to keep it from crusting too quickly. Definitely will make again!

I just tried this today and my entire family loved it! I used bread flour, instead of APF, and brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also used instant yeast, because that's what I had on hand and the dough rose beautifully. Oh, after reading comments about reducing the amount of flour to 5 cups, I was sure that was all I'd need, but the humidity in my country made it necessary to use the full amount. That's also probably why I had enough for one big loaf and a dozen big buns. I'll definitely be making this again!

I have not tried this yet but I love potato bread. This may be a dumb question but could this same method be used in a bread maker?

Light and fluffy with a chewy crust. Excellent as written. The loaf was a bit smaller than usual, though. I might recommend 1.5x recipe.

Oh my. Can you say TOAST? We LOVE this bread! I made it with 
instant potatoes (made them with butter and cream). Let it rise longer on the
second rise, and it came out WONDERFULLY! Toast. omnomnom. Toast nom nom nom.
Light enough, but not airy. Ideal density and crumb.

Absolutely loved this recipe! The texture was perfect as well as the flavor - I'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for in "potato flavor". Between my husband and three sons, both loaves were gone in 2 and a half days! I did use 9x5 loaf pans, but it didn't fall short in the pan at all - nice, large loaves.

I made this recipe and it was great. But, I didn't make bread loaves with it, I made rolls. After letting it rise I punched it down and put it on the scale and came out with a weight of 45.6 OZ divided by 24 (number of rolls)and it came out to 1.9 OZ. Some of the rolls were a little heavy so it only made 22 rolls.

This bread is tasty the first day, but dries out quickly.  Thank you for sharing the recipe, Judy.

This was really good. My bread was tasty even 3 days later but after that it lost its moistness. Will definately make again.
