I have been making these caramel apples for a while now. The trick to getting the apples covered, is to turn them while dipping them.  I have used crushed oreo cookies, graham crackers, sprinkles, candy corn, nuts, and chocolate chips.  All very good.  My husband asks for this about 3 times a month.  Make sure your apples are nice and cold. (I let them set in the refridge.overnight and this helps the caramel set.

So fast and so easy.  I bought caramels in bulk and just unwrapped about 2 cups of them, added 2 Tbs. milk and then microwaved at 50% power for about 2.5 minutes.  Let the caramel sit for a couple of minutes before dipping your apples.  Tip: have your apples ready to go and in the freezer before dipping them in the caramel.
My 18 month old daughter loved licking the caramel off the spatula.

Yeah Suzie for submitting this recipe!!! I use this recipe every year for my kids' fall fun day. I melt the caramels in a 4 C pyrex cup, so that the apple fits down in the cup. This is the easiest way to dip that I have found (no wasted caramel). I give each child a square of wax paper and have them butter the square. Then with adult help ( the caramel needs to cool a little) I let them decorate the apples from a selection of toppings (candy corn, m&ms, halloween sprinkles, cookie crumbs and any other small candies I can find.). This is certainly the highlight of the party. Always remember to have extra candy... It often gets eaten before the apples can be decorated! Once the apple is decorated, the buttered square can be wrapped up around the apple a little loosely, than tied. It's the perfect way to send them home with the kids. A pre-made tag with the child's name makes it an easy way to distinguish who's apple is who's once you have them in the fridge to harden. (Note: Even when an adult makes the apple, they are not always the prettiest apples, they certainly do not look like the expensive apples that they sell in the upscale candy stores... There must be a trade trick to those apples:)

Things you need to know!  1) DO NOT wrap your apples in any type of clinging wrap. Even after they've firmed up. It will stick.  Serve without wrap or you could try to loosely wrap with waxpaper.  2) Run a knife edge at the bottom of the apple to get all the excess caramel off. It doesn't hurt the look of the apple.  3) Do have a deep dish of sprinkles or other crunched up candy to set the apple in while you are dipping your next apple.  Helped to contain the caramel and kept the apples upright. 4) Apples need to have wax removed by dipping in boiling water for a second or just purchase non waxed from your local farmer.  5) apples should be very cold to help set caramel.   6) You can break fork head or spoon head off plasticwear to create a nice stick to stick in your apple.  7)  Have your apples ready with the stick in before you melt your caramel.  8) If you're doing a lot of apples, try and buy caramel in a large serving size as opposed to unwrapping 300 individual cubes. UGH! 9) Only melt the 14 oz at a time in the microwave. 1 minute, stir well, then 30 second - stir well intervals. 10) I used my pampered chef 8 cup measuring bowl. It was great. 11) Spray the waxpaper with cooking oil.  Recipe was very yummy with cameo apples, but the directions were lacking!  Have fun.

I kept my apples in the refrigerator overnight.  Dipping chilled apples seemed to help the caramel set and I had very little "puddling" of caramel at the bottom.  I used plastic forks instead of popsicle sticks for handles.  I inserted the prong-end of the fork into the apple, which held it securely when the kids bit into the apples.  The larger handle was better for little hands, too.  Great treat!

Great recipe! Made these yesterday just for fun and they tasted great. Like others I put my apples in the freezer while I melted my caramels and then put them back in the freezer for about 15 minutes. They set up great! Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

Easy, fast and tasty!  I followed the advice of other raters, rolling the waxy apples in boiling water, wiping them down, putting the Popsicle sticks in them, then putting them in the freezer for 15 minutes.  I microwaved the caramel and milk for 2 minutes and waited 5 minutes before rolling the apples in it.  I found that if you keep spinning the apple over top the dish, after applying caramel, the caramel will, instead of dripping off, roll back over itself and harden as it cools.  Do this before rolling in chocolate chips, or the chocolate will melt!  I also buttered small squares of wax paper to set the apples on in the fridge, this worked out great!  I'm the WORST cook in the world, so if I can do this, anybody can!

I had truly forgotten how good a homemade caramel apple tastes.  Wow!  If you haven't done this in a while, now is the time.  
A few tips I can offer from my experience, which turned out very well: 1) Do not substitute water for milk - the milk is important.  2) Microwave for 3 or so minutes, stirring after each minute.  You want the caramel to actually bubble up.  Much the way you do when you are making caramel corn, when the caramel is bubbly and expanded it is much easier to dip into.  3) Rotate your apples while you dip, and after you get the apple covered, hold it up above your bowl and slowly rotate to allow the caramel to make an even coat.  I found this helped reduce the "puddle" at the bottom.  It does not eliminate it, just reduces it if you wait a bit and keep rotating before putting on the plate.  4) if you want to decorate with bits of stuff, sprinkle just a little bit on the side facing you, and then gently press into the caramel.  Don't roll it or push it into the toppings as that moves the caramel away from the apple and contibutes to the puddle or very gloppy apples.  
Enjoy, and thanks for the recipe - man are these good!!!

My 10yo and I had a blast making several batches of caramel apples. But, I'm glad I read the reviews. There are a few elements of the recipe which are important to note. 1) Don't buy expensive caramel from the German company. Get the cheaper stuff from the company who also sells the blue box of mac & cheese. It melts best. Plus,  the German stuff slowly falls down the apple sides.  2) Boil water to quickly remove wax from the apples, then wash them with soap and dry with paper towels. 3) While waiting for the caramel to melt, store apples in the fridge. 4) Be sure to wait for the caramel to cool (and thicken) a bit before rolling the apples. 5) Even if you use wax paper on the cookie sheet, ALSO use non-stick spray. The caramel will stick to the wax paper.
It was a real hardship to eat the "mess ups". :) Enjoy!

I doubled the recipe and attempted to make 12 caramel apples, but failed miserably, however, all is not lost b/c I've discovered a few tricks (2 turned out good). 1. Dip apples in boiling water for a few seconds, then rub off the melted wax (this helps the caramel stick) 2. Use small apples 3. Let the apples cool a bit in the freezer before dipping them in caramel. 3. Make sure apples are DRY 4. After dipping in caramel, hold it up right for a while until the caramel has cooled slightly. 5. If the caramel still drips after a bit, you're caramel was too hot. Well, I'll try again next year and I know they'll turn out better!

I made this recipie for a Girl Guide camp. The girls had fun dipping the apples, and really enjoyed eating them. I will make these again!   I used 7lbs caramels and 1/2 c milk. I melted the caramels in the microwave, and kept the caramel warm in the crock pot. If the sauce started getting too thick, I would turn the pot up to high for a few minutes. This covered 37 large apples. The first few apples had too much caramel on them, and there was a large puddle under the apples on the waxed paper. I could have done more apples if I had removed some of the excess caramel from the bottom just after dipping using a knife. I pressed the dipped apples into sprinkles to keep them from sticking to the waxed paper. The coating hardened more on the apples that were done last. Probably due to the sauce cooking in the crock pot.

I made this recipe this past weekend and I thought it was going to be a huge production. I couldn't believe how quick and easy it was to make these and how much better they taste than store bought ones. I put my apples in the freezer for about 15 min before I put the caramel on them and also let the caramel cool off to thicken for 3 min. I rolled mine in peanuts and they came out tasting great and looking professional! Just started a new yearly tradition.

I washed, de-stemmed, dried, and put the apples in the freezer for about 10 minutes before I started this recipe. The key to the caramel sticking (among other things) is to WAIT to dip the apples in the caramel.  After you take the bubbling hot caramel out of the microwave, let it sit for a good 5 minutes.  I made 2 batches.  The 1st 2 apples in my 1st batch had the caramel drip right off.  The rest were fine, and I corrected my mistake on the 2nd batch and they were perfect.  Also, as soon as i dipped them, I put them directly into the fridge on my buttered cookie sheet.

Carmel and apples...simple and DELICIOUS!  I made caramel apples from scratch (homemade caramel) last year, and let me tell you, I do not believe it is worth it.  This is so much easier, and just as tasty, and so much less finicky (for the homemade caramel kind, you must have a candy thermometer and cook it just right) and so much less time consuming!  We rolled some in crushed oreos (I was not sure about that one at first, but it is so so good) and some in chopped peanuts.  Give it a try.  You'll love it!

This is a great way to make caramel apples. Might I suggest a gummy worm wrapped around hte base of the stick. Looks so cute and great for halloween.

I believe the key to getting the caramel to stick to the apple is the consistency of the caramel.  It should be thick and goopy. 

I used a very small saucepan on the stove top so that I could easily control the consistency of my caramel.  Don't be afraid to let it get pretty thick.  If it's too thick, just turn the heat up.  I rolled my apple around in the saucepan and got it really well coated, then I would hold it up above the pan and spin the apple around and up and down to even out the caramel.  I spun it around for a long time, allowing the caramel to cool and set before I placed it on the wax paper. 

Tasted and looked great!

for the rating below mine... thank you, captain obvious. I used Kraft Caramels and the sticks were included which was nice. The recipe is really simple and easy... and they taste great. I'd recommened using really cold apples so that the caramel cools a little faster.

Very easy to make and delicious! Will definitely be making these again! Easter maybe? Thanks to everyone for their helpful reviews too. I put the apples in the freezer for about 15 minutes before making them. Also put the apples in boiling water for a few seconds to take all the wax off before putting them in the freezer. Used my measuring cup to melt the caramel chews and milk in and used chopped sticks I take from Chinese fast food places for the sticks. After dipping them in caramel and adding nuts to them (big bag of chopped nut topping at Smart & Final for less than $3) I placed them on buttered wax paper and put them in the fridge. No problem taking them off at all. Chopped them into bite-sized pieces for easy eating for my 3-year old (and me). A KEEPER for sure!!! Thank you!

These were great.  I had a bunch of kids over for a pre trick-or-treat party, and each was able to make their own apple and decorate it!  I prepared the caramel sauce in the crock pot, which kept the caramel warm until ready to use.  It worked great!!!

If you plan to make them- use caramel CHEWS!!! (Soft candy) not the caramels that are hard.

My son totally enjoyed making these with me for Halloween. I followed others' advice and had the apples washed and in the freezer before I melted the caramels in the microwave. So easy and a tasty treat! Thanks!

Perfect ratio of milk to caramels, producing just the right consistency for dipping!  I melted my caramels for two minutes as directed, then let the caramel sit for a couple of minutes before dipping.  Letting the hot caramel cool briefly, along with washing the apples thoroughly to get the wax off, worked perfectly.  I rolled one apple in crushed Oreos, one in chopped Butterfinger candy, and one in chopped pretzels, and the toppings stuck nicely.  Very pleased, as will be my husband when he gets home from work!

Very yummy---gooey and sticky! :) We dipped ours and rolled them in chocolate sprinkles and chopped nuts. We put ours in the freezer immediately after dipping-and let them sit for a about 10 minutes. When we pulled them out, we put the reeces shell ice cream topping on and it was PERFECT! :) We are going to try this again adding some new toppings this time. Really nice Fall treat! :)

My boyfriend (the guy who even has trouble cooking a frozen pizza) and daughter made these this afternoon. We've made them this way for years with the exception we sprinkle some chopped walnuts over the wax paper and set the apples on top. For a pretty touch, I wanted to use what was left of Sue's Hot Fudge (also on this site) and drizzled it overall. I admit, I didn't achieve the effect I had wanted but they still turned out good and it was nice to ocassionally take a bite out of both caramel, apple and then a little fudge. I think I can now trust those two to make these next time alone (without my supervision).

Tasted great.  However I found the timing to be a little off as it took me longer than 2 minutes to get the caramel melted.  I also had difficulty getting the caramel to stick to the apples.  For some, I boiled water, dipped the apple in, and washed off the wax.  For others, I didn’t bother.  Didn’t make too much of a difference.  By the next day, most of the caramel was on the wax paper with a thin coating around the apple.  Not that it bothered anyone since they tasted amazing and looked lovely, but hopefully I can figure out how to get the caramel to set on the apples a little better.

Excellent classic recipe. I make some with plain caramel and then I coat in milk chocolate and then they become "gourmet caramel apples."

Mmmmmmmmmm...so good.  I could eat them all.  Make sure you refrigerate these after you make them as the caramel will slowly ooze down and form a puddle around the apple if you don't.

This recipe was so easy and successful!  The suggestion from another reviewer to use the pyrex measuring cup was great...made it easy to cover the whole apple.  We used mini chocolate chips and mini marshmellows.

I have never made caramel apples up until now, although, I have had many (fairs, cider mills, etc).  I believe the milk ingredient really enhances this recipe:)

Just a few things on my own experience (not taking away from the recipe at all!):


I used a bag of Kraft Caramels (14oz minus a few due to previous "sneaking" a piece between me and my 4 year old!!) and tossed them in the microwave on high at two 1-minute intervals (to allow stirring as directed).  I think I will lower the power a tad next time, however, to maybe 75%.  When I took the bowl out, it appeared to be rather runny as a previous poster mentioned.  I stirred it and as the initial temp cooled a bit, it thickened up.  

YES...you will have to work fast because as that caramel cools, the thicker it gets and makes it more difficult to get a smooth coat on it.

I used a typical cereal bowl (that comes with a set of dishes), but next time, I will totally use a bowl AT LEAST as deep as the apple (and then some to allow for the stick) to ensure a complete coverage (the stick area was difficult to cover).

Also, I was able to get roughly 8 out of this.  My apples were fresh Jonathan apples from MI and no bigger than a fist (if that)..so maybe that helped yield a few more:)

This was really fast and easy.  I used green apples which are simply the best for caramel apples.  As soon as I coated the apples with the caramel, I placed them in the freezer (on the greased sheet) until the caramel set (approx 10 minutes).  Make sure you allow to cool briefly and work fast.

These directions, similar to those found on the back of a package of caramels, always overcook them in my microwave. We have a 1100 watt microwave, and 2 minutes at high power heats the caramel to the soft crack stage, way too hot.  If you have a powerful microwave, put it at 50% power and run it for a minute, then stir, evaluate, and put on for another 30-45 seconds if necessary at 50% power.  I like mine with shredded pecans on top of the caramel.  :-)

Great recipe.  Keep in mind that the caramel sets up quickly, so you don't have a lot of time to get any "extras" on the apple, so work fast!

Although these were very tasty, it was very hard to dip the whole apple in them.  The carmel was to thick.  It would be a great dip for apples, or you could thin down the carmels with even more milk.

This was so much fun to do! I dipped the apples in boiling water for a few seconds first to remove the wax. This did make the caramel stick better. After that I left a couple plain, coated some in nuts, and others I drizzled with chocolate. No matter how you like 'em - plain or decorated with your favorite toppings these are a classic that evokes great fall memories!

Very fun to make! I melted my caramels in my crockpot (very easy for dipping). I kept the apples in the frigde until I was ready to dip them and I had very little drippings. My son had fun with the sprinkles however they did not want to stick to the caramel. I even had him sprinkle them right after I dipped them and the sprinkles stil didn't stick. I sprayed wax paper with cooking oil and put the apples back in the fridge. When the apples were done I pulled them off the wax paper and they did not stick at all. I can't wait to make more!

My first time making caramel apples so I thought I'd try this recipe.  It didn't work out for me liked I hoped. Actually I was very disappointed.  I started off thinking they were going to to be awesome - ha.  I cooked carmel 2 minutes let cool a bit and started dipping. After a short period there was a pool of caramel under the apple. After more time passed there was a bigger pool.  Then even later the pool also had the toppings I rolled in it as well.  Don't know for sure why it didn't work.  I placed the apples in the frig for a couple hours before dipping after I dipped in hot water and dried to get the wax off.  Our local candy store does not place their apples in the frig before.  They are at room temp so the caramel is smooth and bubbles don't appear (which happened to me).  The temp of their caramel is over 230 degrees.  I won't give up.

These were so quick, easy & fun to make! They're also delicious. I washed & chilled the apples in the fridge (25 min) before hand and let the caramel cool slightly in the bowl before coating the apples. By the sixth apple the caramel started to get sticky & clump a little. Perhaps I could have heated it up again to avid this. I also placed the coated apples on a platter with waxpaper for easy removal. Worked out great. Overall this is a great, easy recipe. These caramel apples are a hit!

It was great, I put 6 washed apples in the fridge all night and when I was doing the caramel, I moved them to the freezer, the caramel set perfectly, no runs. I cut squares of wax paper and I spread some butter too. Once they were done, I put them in the fridge for 15 min. I just have enough caramel for 5 apples...I guess that I got them kind of big...

This was quite easy to do. I washed the apples in very hot water to make sure there was no waxy coating on the apples. The recipe doesn't explain to wait a few minutes, or so after microwaving the caramel, to start dipping. If it is too hot, it will begin to slide down, especially if the apples are rolled in some chopped peanuts. I put them on a parchment lined sheet. They had to be refridgerated at least three hours to be set. I thought the caramel coating was rather thick, for my taste, so I would shake off the excess very well. However, the actual apples were tons fresher than the pre-made caramel apples at the grocery store. The apples made all the difference.

I did myself a caramel apple challenge...a few different recipes, and see if I could tell a difference between using milk or water. Well This is a great recipe, very basic, and simple. I don't have anything negative to say about this recipe. The caramel was delish, the recipe was simple and yet fun. Thanks so much.

It is a great recipe!! I made them 130 of them for my wedding favors. They taste great but there is one problem. I let them cool on buttered wax paper but they still stuck to the paper and we lost 30 of the apples because of it!

We first tried the recipe on the back of Kraft Caramels.  That recipe made them so hard they just about broke the children's teeth!  This recipe made soft, creamy caramel apples, very edible and very good.

This is my first official review on allrecipes : )  Great recipe!  I actually melted the caramels and milk in a double broiler then removed from heat, stirring until my caramel cooled a little. Working very quickly, I cover the apples (5 small apples) with the yummy caramel.  I placed them on a greased cookie sheet and WA-LA! Perfect apples like the ones I get at D!sney :)  Thanks!!

While I found that this recipe tasted good, the presentation itself wasn't a success for me. The apples stuck to the pan, and the caramel ran all down to the bottom of the apple. I'll try it again to be fair, and see what happens.

Tasted good, but all the caramel melted off by the end of the night (only out for two hours.) Even refrigerated per comments, and still was left with a barely covered apple :(

I used caramel bits to save me the time of having to unwrap all of the caramel.  It is so much easier.  I have made caramel apples once in the past, and I remember not enjoying it very much.  I didn't enjoy it very much this time either.  The rolling in the caramel was easy, but getting the topping to stick is another story.  I tried rolling in the toppings, but it just became a sticky, gooey mess in the pan.  Then I tried pressing the toppings onto the apple, and it became a sticky, gooey mess on my hands.  In the end, they didn't turn out looking as I had pictured in my head, but they taste amazing.

These were delicious, but they stuck to the wax paper I placed them on to cool! I made them for a paper and by the time we got around to eating them, the paper tore when we pulled them off and we had to pick the wax paper off! But they did taste great!

WOW!  Since both my daughters have summer birthdays, their teachers wanted to celebrate them on the last day of school.  When my girls wanted me to make caramel apples for their birthday treat, I admit I cringed.  But this recipe is so easy!  I just did a test batch and turned out perfect, beautiful apples.  I used my 4-cup pyrex measure for melting and dipping, and spooned caramel over the top of the apples for an even coating.  Then I used the spoon to scrape the bottom of the apples so there wouldn't be a big puddle of caramel at the bottom.  Perfect, and way easier than cupcakes would've been!  I disagree with the reviewer who said these couldn't look professional--with a little extra attention I think they could.

I have tried a different Caramel Apple recipe every year for the last few years. This is the first one that I have used that I would take them anywhere. While they do not look professional, they look good. Good consistency. The first few had air bubbles. That was my fault, let it cool a bit. Also, Thanks for the tip on the 4 cup measuring cup. Works great! A tip for all: read the reviews. They can give you lots of helpful tips and tricks.

These were perfect!  It made exactly 6 apples with very little caramel left over.
Like a few of the other reviewers, I put my apples in the freezer before dipping so the caramel would set up.  My son and I buttered small squares of waxed paper for easy removal.  There was very little mess.  If you want to put candy sprinkles or any other extras on them, do it immediately as the cold apples help the caramel set up very quickly.
This is so easy, my kids could easily do this from start to finish with no help from me.

Easy recipe. I used a stove and a double boiler - try it! I found that it made the process a lot less messy and the caramel didn't burn or stick.

This is a great basic caramel recipe.  I wanted to try my hand at making caramel apple slices, and while they turned out okay, they were a mess to make and didn't keep.  I drizzled mine with some melted semi-sweet chips.  Doesn't get any better and easier than this!

Ummm are you kidding?! Caramels, milk and microwave.. how can you go wrong??  I made a bunch for the girls at work and they loved them!! Some I rolled in peanuts and some I topped with homemade peanut butter shell (2/3 c PB chips, 2T margarine, 3t veg oil, microwave 45sec stir and let set for a minute) the apples should be put in freezer, but I only had them in there for a half hour and then refrigerated overnight when done so magic shell would set.  Thank you so much for sharing this easy recipe! Made my first attempt at caramel apples a positive one!

Tasted great, but did not stay on the apples which were frigerated overnight before dipping. Almost all of the caramel oozed off.

I made these for a charity bake sale. I am not sure if the fact that I was making 18 mattered.. but I found that since the caramel was micro-waved that it hardened very fast and was too thick. My apples ended up with puddles of caramel on the bottom. Of course they tasted amazing.. but they did not look as "pretty" as I would have liked.

Enjoyed this recipe by just dipping apple slices in the melted caramel. It is not as buttery and delicious as homemade caramel from scratch (that's 5 stars) but good for a quick sugar fix.

So easy and yummy.  My son had so much fun putting his own touch on them, complete with chocolate chips and sprinkles.  And for the user who thought many had ruined their apples using hard candies, I'm thinking not... I'd never even think to use the hard variety.  Great recipe, thank you!

Very good and easy! My favorite caramel apple topping is chopped walnuts... the mini M&M's and Heath topping look Great, but are so sweet with the caramel.

Very good. The caramel was a little thin, but otherwise, everything looks good. I am looking forward to getting my fall "fix"!

I bought my carmels in bulk, so used 2 cups as another reviewer suggested.  I also went out and bought a 4 cup glass measuring cup to melt the caramels in.  It is the right sized container to really get the apples down in to get them coated.  I found my last apple did not have a lot of caremel left for it, but these were really good.  I did refridgerate my apples for the day first too.

Let me start by saying, if I was a pro at making caramel apples, I wouldn't be trying this recipe, obviously, with that being said let me say that there are many things missing in the instructions here. The caramel completely ran off my apples, the caramel was too runny, the apples need to be thoroughly wiped to ensure there is NO moisture, even let them sit for about 20 minutes before you coat to really ensure there is no moisture. I'll never make these again. Guess I better find a quick recipe to substitute in my Valentine's tins. Thanks.

Had a hard time with these. Tasted really good, but it just made a mess, and the caramel ended up just oozing off the apples, so I ended up throwing away what we didn't eat immediately.

Star rating is earned due to easy of preparing and tastiness! This recipe is exactly what my son envisioned for his church treats (and what I recalled making in my youth). The recipe was easy for 8-year old hands to make and a treat for children and adults alike to eat. Thanks for submitting the recipe, Suzie, and to all the reviewers for their feedback.

My daughter and I made these for the 1st time tonight and they turned out well. We washed and dried the apples, chilled them, and used sturdy plastic forks for handles. We used a 4 cup pyrex measuring cup to melt the caramels in and allowed it to set for 5 minutes before dipping the apples. They aren't beautiful but they aren't horrible either. With a little practice they would be pretty in addition to yummy.

This recipe was super easy, I made 5 apples with 15oz of chocolate. Mine set up really quick, I ended up halving the recipe and doing a couple different batches. If applying candy or nuts to the carmel you have to do it quickly! I redipped some of mine in white and milk chocolate and coated them in crushed oreo, gramcrackers, nuts rice krispies and heath bar.

Love them apples!  I kept the washed apples overnight in the fridge to get them nice and cold.  After rolling in the caramel, I dipped my apples in toasted pecans.  The nuts stopped the caramel from pooling on the wax paper and they presented BEAUTIFULLY!  No fuss to get them off the paper either!

My whole family came over on Halloween night & made these after trick or treating.  They loved it, even the grandkids.  We had to double the recipe.  We didn't change anything & they came out great.  We did put them in the frig. for awhile to get hard, but that's all.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Nice and easy way to have fun with the kids and also enjoy a great tasting caramel apple.  I followed the recipe to the "T".  The only trouble I had was that the caramel was hardening too fast for me and also that some bubbles appeared on some of the apples and I can't figure out why.  I'm sure it was something I did wrong but it was so fast and tasty that it was definitely worth it!  Thanks Suzie!

It couldn't be an easier recipe to make or more tasty.  I used organic Granny Smith apples and found that they had absolutely no wax on them so they took the caramel beautifully! Fun to make and more fun to decorate and eat!

Easy to make but a big dissapointment.  I made these for a church activity and most of the caramel ran off of the apples and onto the pan.  I even used cold apples to help the caramel set up faster but it didn't help.  Maybe without the milk they would turn out better?

I made this recipe twice.  The first time I barely had enough carmel to cover 5 medium size apples.  The second time I had too  much. The first batch I made I let the carmel cool off a bit before I started covering the apples too.  The second time I started it after I got the carmel out and mixed well.  Either way - they came out great. I can't wait to try some of the suggestions for "decorating" them after coating them.

These apples were good but when I did as others suggested and dipped boiling water to remove the wax, the skins turned a brownish color and separated from the apple. It was okay for our own eating pleasure but I wouldn't give it as a gift. It did keep the caramel from sliding from the apple though.

I must be caramel apple challenged. I microwaved the caramels for 2 minutes and stirred, stirred, stirred, but there will still chunks. I put it back in for 30 more seconds and there will STILL chunks/strings of caramel. I hoped they would melt as the mix sat, so I went ahead and dipped the COLD apples. I then dipped them in chopped peanuts. As I placed them on the greased cookie sheet, the vast majority of the caramel proceeded to run directly off the apples and onto the pan. I got scared so I placed them right into the fridge again. 

It was a complete disaster. They tasted great, but they definately did not come out the way they were supposed to.

This recipe was exceptionally easy and fast. I've never made caramel apples before and would quite happily do it every day if need be because it was THAT easy. I didn't have wooden sticks so I used corn on the cob handles (the longer ones that look like mini corn on the cobs)and just stuck one where the stem had been.

If you like a gooey, sticky caramel apple, this one is for you.  Most reviews  mention the caramel is too runny.  I made sure to use 14oz of caramel as most bags are just under the 14oz mark.   I also used cream instead of milk hoping that would help it set up.  I made sure to wash the wax coating off of the apple before dipping,  then rolled the base of the dipped apple in nuts to collect any caramel that would roll down so I wouldn't lose one ounce of caramel.  The outside formed a gloss coating so fast that I couldn’t get any sprinkles to stick, yet the caramel itself was still gooey and didn’t was to set.  Putting them in the fridge helped tremendously, but in the evenings I would sat one out for a snack and as soon as the outside hit room temperature, it turned back into a gooey caramel and would slide down the apple.  They are good, quick ‘n easy and about what I would expect from packaged caramels.

it was really runny. Followed the directions as written. They tasted good and looked good, but they only looked good for the first 30 minutes.  We were able to use the leftover as a caramel dip - which was a lot neater. Just put in a bowl with chopped up apples next to it. Maybe a little less milk? I'm not sure, but

My opinion doesn't reflect this specific recipe (although I did follow it - but they are all the same) but I'll never go through all the work of making caramel apples again. I followed all the directions and tips from reviewers, melted the caramels, let it cool a little, washed and scrubbed the wax off the apples, let them dry, put them in the freezer for 15 min, sprayed the wax paper, set them in the fridge afterward, everything little thing to make them work out., the caramel set up pretty well and I thought yay, all the naysayers were wrong.  BUT it all slid off  through the night, taking the coatings with it, and ended up as puddles on the wax paper. Just buy the caramel apples, or serve the caramel warm on the side, but don't bother making them.

Recipe is easy enough.  However, I sprayed wax paper as instructed and the caramel still stuck to the paper.  Perhaps it was the caramels I chose?!

This was the first time I had ever made caramel apples. I decided to make a small batch (about 8) before a big party to see if I would run into any troubles. No troubles at all. These were simple and perfect. I rolled my apples in boiling water for a few seconds and dried as some people recommended. Then I stuck them in the refrigerator overnight. The caramel took 3 minutes rather than 2 but it may have been my microwave. I used sprinkles and pecans at the base for something special. Everyone loved them. I think I may try some chocolate next time! Thanks for the recipe. I will use it for years to come.

Yummy and so easy to make !! Thanks ! I put them in a very well buttered pyrex dish and I also followed the tips and put my apples in the freezer a few minutes before dipping them. I cooked them in a pan instead of the microwave so they wouldn't harden to much and I washed the apples well before to make sure the caramel would stick to them. Plastic forks work just as well. Keeping this recipe !

Perfectly easy and taste is great.  As for coating the apples . . .well, that's not my strong suit!  Apparently I need some practice in that.  Other than that, this recipe is extraordinarily easy and fast.  Bf gobbled up an entire apple in minutes.  I probably won't just bc our apples are huge, but I tried a few bites and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

YUMMY!!! My caramel seemed a little thick, but maybe it cooled too much before I put it on.  I coated a couple of the apples in chopped almonds, and they were they hit!!!  Make sure your apples are cool, that helps the caramel set up and not run all over.

I had trouble with this recipe.  I put the apples in the freezer for 15 minutes and then I stuck them in the fridge.  I had a bad time with the caramel.  The first three worked alright, but I could only do 5 total.  I didn't have enough to do the last one.

I'm not making this recipe again.  I followed the directions, but they didn't end up looking at all near to the picture.  I am very disappointed with the results.

I haven't tried one yet, but I plan to try one tonight.

A great simple recipe.  I did it with the kids and they turned out delicious!  We rolled some in chopped pecans and others in mini chocolate chips.

Maybe the reason the caramel is not sticking to the apples is because the apples have a wax coating on them.  I buy organic apples and they have wax on them too.  Just a thought - will have to test it out.

My caramel ran off the sides of the apples. Not sure what went wrong. I watched video and followed directions except used an 11oz package of caramels bc that was all I could find.

Definitely sticky lol I used the stove top on medium, stirring constantly, added  2 larger packages of kraft caramels and cream to thin out a bit and added crushed peanuts to the bottom of some and it worked very well . Easy but messy kids loved :)

I love this recipie! I tried it for a family event, and everyone had doubted me when I said it got great reviews. The apples turned out a million times better than I had expected. I didn't change anything to the recipie(even though there were some great suggestions) and loved that the caramel smoothed itself out while IT cooled. Will definitely use this recipie again!

Very easy to make. Buy unwrapped caramels or you will be unwrapping for a full hour. I ended up with a huge puddle of caramel but the apples were still coated well.

So good! I boiled the apples too long... I used a teacup to warm the caramels...it was perfect for only doing 2 apples. I saw a few reviews that used Oreo cookie crumbs...yummy!!! This was the BEST apple ever!!!!

The caramel was super gooey and took forever to harden. Still delicious, just way messier and not as pretty as I thought.

These were delicious, of course. Mine didn't set up according to the recipe instructions, though. Even though I smudged the caramel around the apple after they initially puddled, it still puddled.  Maybe it would help to refrigerate the apples after they're dipped.  My family ate them anyway, and loved them.

This is the first time I made caramel apples. I used this recipe, and thankfully they turned out pretty yummy with no big problems! The only thing is that, the caramel didn't stick that well to the apples after a while...most of it eventually slid down under the apple, but they were still good nonetheless. I used powdered sugar on a pan before I put the fresh caramel apples down.

I made caramel apples for the first time today and making caramel this way was easy. 

As others suggested, I boiled the apples for a few seconds and then wiped off the wax. I then put them in the freezer for a few minutes and then wiped them off again before inserting the sticks. 

Tip: if you are adding toppings, dip all of your apples in the caramel first to let the caramel cool on your apples before adding any toppings. I didn't do this at first and all of my toppings slide down.

These did NOT turn out how I expected. The carmel was way too thick and difficult to coat the apples. They stuck to the wax paper I placed them on so couldn’t use any of them. Very disappointed. Will try making my own carmel next time.

I decided to only make 3 instead of six apples! Other people have recommended letting the caramel sit for 5 minutes after warming. I attempted to wait but found I had better outcomes with waiting only 1 minute. I was only using  7 oz. caramel and found if I waited the caramel was too thick. I also recommend dipping the apples in boiling water to remove the wax.

Great recipe! I made this with Granny Smith apples and coated with chopped cocktail peanuts. One of my coworkers said they were the best caramel apples she has ever had!

Would probably not make this recipe again...the one on the package of caramels was better using water instead of milk. (Note that you reduce water to 1 Tbsp. if microwaving caramel.) Also, you MUST butter your wax paper, or you end up with a sticky, globby mess. I agree that dipping cold apples helps the caramel set quickly instead of it running off the apples onto the tray. Better directions in the original recipe would have been helpful!

This number of caramels is only sufficient for 5 apples.

I ruined a few before I got the hang of it, but it worked out . I thought placing them on a wax paper would be a good idea, it wasn't !

I made as directed last night, and nearly all of the caramel has dripped off by this morning.  It's still soft, never hardened.  I made a 2nd batch with less milk and that worked better.  I used Kraft caramels, I don't know if that made a difference.

Just finished making a batch of these! Make sure you refrigerate the apples after you have coated them with carmel! If you don't the carmel will run off the apple in some places. Overall I love the taste and how fast/easy they were to make!

I followed this recipe exactly as written. I found that the caramel was very sticky and that it required more candies than originally posted.

It's very useful and helpful, something I might use if I have limited time, but it's not really what I'm looking for. Sorry. Nice job though.
