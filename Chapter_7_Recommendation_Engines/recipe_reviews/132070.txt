I made this to go with our holiday dinner and it was outrageously good.  Instead of orange juice and zest, I used the juice of one lemon thinned with some water and the lemon zest.  I was out of walnuts so I substituted toasted sliced almonds.  Everyone just raved about this.  I will definitely make this again, using my substitutions.

I love brussels sprouts and this is a great recipe!  The orange complements the sprouts very well. I used some smoked alder wood salt while cooking, and sprinkled on some bleu cheese when finished. A bowl full was very filling and made a whole meal.

We just had this for our side dish with dinner and it was FABULOUS.  A few changes I made: Oven roasted them at 375 degrees with the walnut oil for 30 minutes/added juice of half an orange for final 10 minutes and finished with the zest of half an orange, kosher salt and fresh black pepper. We did not add any nuts and probably will not add them in the future -these were FABULOUS and both my husband and I think they were the best we have ever had! DELISH!!!

I personally love Brussels sprouts but I know a lot of people are doubtful about them.  However, I decided to make this for the last barbecue of the summer (not the last barbecue of the year, but of summer) & we served it at room temperature.  All diners raved & were surprised to find themselves taking seconds.  It's a little more work than my usual treatment of Brussels sprouts but definitely worth it for a special occasion.

I liked this one very much.  I roasted in in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes on a cookie sheet instead of cooking in a skillet.  I added the walnuts during the last 10 minutes.  I added more oil than it called for.  I used walnut oil but it was a little expensive.  You could probably substitute olive oil or vegatable oil and it would be fine.

For a not so favorite veggie this is the best recipe to make! My family request this dish quite often, so often it is now a Thanksgiving special~! 
I use the steamer bag Brussels Spouts to cut the cooking time in half otherwise the spouts take a lot longer time to make tender than the recipe calls for.

I love Brussels sprouts but I have to say that this is my all-time favorite recipe for them!   The best flavor came from using a Tangelo in place of an orange--super sweet/tangy orange flavor!   Also, since I don't usually keep walnut oil on hand, I just brown the sprouts in olive or canola oil and they turn out great.    Fabulous recipe!!

I'm not a huge fan of brussels sprouts.  I loved this recipe!  I had fresh baby sprouts on hand so I didn't halve them.  They took a bit longer than 15 minutes to cook and we used double the amount of orange juice.  We ran out of liquid so we added some lemon.  I love citrus so this worked great for me!

Delicious!  The orange and walnuts completely eliminated to strong flavor Brussels sprouts sometimes have.  Browning them rather than steaming them also added a nice flavor.

Loved this recipe! Easy to make in cast iron skillet. Never found a recipe for brussels sprouts I liked until now. Husband liked too. Used toasted sesame oil since didn't have walnut. Added a little minced garlic, fresh ginger and green onion just for fun.  Added juice from 2 oranges and zest from 1.  Tasted good but once I added the toasted walnuts it was fantastic!

I totally love brussels sprouts and this recipe is worthy of a second chance. It takes a lot longer to cook them than stated.  But, I really love the idea and taste of the orange paired with the sprouts. Thank you for this recipe!

I guess I did something wrong making this. The sprouts never seemed to finish cooking and I doubled the time to try  and get them to soften up. The flavor wasn't that great so I added more orange, fresh dill, some cinnamon, and some salt. When I finished the sauce tasted great but the sprouts were still too raw tasting.  I ate the half of them that seemed done. I'll try roasting the rest tomorrow to finish their cooking. I'm guessing it might have been different if I'd used the frozen kind, they get softer a lot quicker.

Excellent recipe.  I made this a few months ago and it was amazing.  I roasted them in the oven instead and did not add walnuts.  The flavor of the walnut oil and orange is fantastic!  I am making it again tonight with a honey-jalapeno grilled chicken breast!!! yummmm

Love this recipe!  Used a generous splash of apple juice in addition to the orange to cut the citrus slightly.  This is a family favorite.

I recently starting eating Brussels Sprouts again, despite the memories of not liking them as a child.  I now love them.   I only had one pound of sprouts on hand, but used the stated amounts of the other ingredients.  I browned mine in toasted sesame oil with a little grape seed oil as well, in my cast iron skillet. (I didn't have any walnut oil on hand.)  I added more orange juice, as it quickly evaporated.  The end product was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.  If I use two pounds of sprouts next time, I might roast them in the oven as mentioned in the other reviews.

I love this recipe! Using fresh brussel sprouts requires more cooking time than stated. Also, the orange juice reduced before the veg was tender enough, so I added some more and covered the pan to steam them a little bit. Someone's review mentioned that they sprinkled a little blue cheese. I didn't try this, but think it would go nicely and will try this next time.

I loved this recipe! The only things I did differently were:
1) used peanut oil (because that's what I had)
2) added dried cranberries, tossed in when I added everything else into the large bowl. 
Wonderful!

I have hated brussel sprouts since I was a kid and was made to choke them down as part of my dinner. I have had such an aversion to them that it bordered on a phobia. I kept hearing people say that they loved them and decided it must have been the way my mom made them so I decided to try them. Several  years after coming to this decision I finally got the courage to attempt them with this recipe. I LOVED THEM!!!  They were tender and nowhere near the bitter ones I had as a child. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was that my husband didn't care for them. I only dinged them slightly for that because he's not a vegetable person anyway.  I will definitely make them again. I made them with olive oil and skipped the walnuts.

We were out of bacon so I needed a new sprout recipe. This was delicious and not too heavy. I poured in a little light beer to help steam the big ones. I used some of the zest separately to make citrus oil so in the end I cut the leftover orange carcass up and tossed them in to add an extra orange flavor. Yum.
