Thanks for the good recipe, simple and tasty.  I substituted white wine for the chicken stock just for variety - it's delish either way.  If you don't like to use wine in cooking, use apple juice sharpened by a dash of fresh lemon juice.

I made this as a fondue. I put a little over 2 cups of broth in a fondue pot with the red pepper and then we had a great time dipping the shrimp one by one into the pot to cook them and then into the garlic butter as a sauce before eating. I added some parsley to the garlic butter to give it a bit of colour. This will be my new fondue recipe - much better then beef or chicken.

This is a great way to have shrimp. The hardest part is peeling the shrimp. I mix the shrimp, garlic butter,cooked frozen veggies,and San Giorgio Roasted Garlic Angel Hair pasta together and my husband loves it.

Excellent taste and SO simple.  I used homemade chicken stock to saute, and fresh garlic in the butter. Then I cooked some fresh pasta and combined it all, using just enough of the garlic butter to coat the pasta. It was great!!!

Yummy! Though I will have to experiment for a little more depth of flavor (thus 4 stars) the simplicity of the recipe is supreme for the results. I had defrosted a couple pounds of shrimp and wasn't sure what to make, but knew I wanted something scampi-like. I had leftover chicken broth in the fridge, so I decided to try this. I used more chicken broth than called for and skipped the red pepper flakes, but added lemon juice to the broth. I also used more garlic too (minced from jar) and mixed the garlic butter in with the broth. I poured it over rice and added spinach for a scrumptious shrimp "soup". I can see this being fabulous for pasta too. The simmering really kept the shrimp tender. I'll be making this again!

These were really good. Next time I will use more red pepper flakes.

Delicious and simple to make. I used some very large shrimp as I couldn't find tiger prawns. I love the garlic butter for dipping, too.

These were good, but we prefer the shrimp grilled.

I, too, served this with pasta and fresh saut√©ed veggies.  The more garlic the better!
