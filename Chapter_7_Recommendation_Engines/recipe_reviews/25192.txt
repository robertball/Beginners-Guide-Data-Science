A nice easy cake to make. As I always do I only used 1/2 the sugar called for in the cake. And to give it extra apple flavour I used homemade applesauce instead of oil. And for added nutrients I used 1 cup of wheat flour. It is a winner. I'll definately make this cake again!

Look no further! This Apple coffee cake ROCKS! It not only looked like I spent hours on it, it tasted wonderful. I am usually hesitant about trying recipes that have not yet been rated but I took a gamble on this one and definatly came out on top. Everyone loved it! The taste and texture was amazing!!! A Keeper!

Every one loved this cake. Only modification I would make is to lower sugar by half cup, otherwise great recipe. Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe and it turned out to dry. So I cut the oil in half and replaced it with butter and added raisins,cinnamon,nutmeg and ginger to the batter, I also soaked the apples in the orange juice to keep everything moist. Made is much better.

I did not think this coffee cake lived up to the positive reviews at all. I found it to be bland and very heavy.

This is a very simple recipe and if you have some apples you want to use, then this is perfect. I halved the recipe and it worked just fine.

OK, but nothing special. Per other reviewers, I reduced the sugar, used some whole wheat flour, and used only brown sugar for the cinnamon-sugar mix. I had to add a little extra OJ because the batter was too thick.  If I were to make it again, I'd put the first apple layer on the bottom of the pan so they're on top once the cake has been flipped. The apples on top got dry, and not all of the cinnamon-sugar melted before the cake was done. I'd also add some spice into the cake batter.

This recipe was only so/so.  My husband, who loves anything sweet wasn't crazy about it.  I found that it had too much apple.  I used the suggested quantity, but the recipe really didn't specify the size of the apples so I used regular sized apples.  It was also pretty bland, and I added more cinnamon than it called for.  Perhaps using smaller apples, adding some nutmeg, a dash of allspice and much more cinnamon, it will be better.

I've made this cake however it is slightly different.  I bake it in a 9X13 pan.  I use 4 cups of apples (apples you would use to make an apple pie). Not all apples are suitable.  I use 1/4 c orange juice or apple juice.  The coating for apples is 3 tsp cinnamon in  1/3 cup of sugar.  It's always a winner.

Delicious! One of the best coffee cake recipes I have ever come across. Sometimes I substitute blueberries or strawberries for the apples and it tastes just as great. A nice treat for the whole family.

i made it last week and everyone loved it! i didn't have vegetable oil( i realized until i was about to start) so i looked up for substitutes to it it said apple sauce or melted butter or margarine, so 
instead i added 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of melted butter.
i didn't give it 5 stars b/c of the changes i made so i'm not sure how the original recipe would come out

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and got wonderful compliments. Strangely though barely any of it was eaten...The apple and sugar layers saved it for me. The cake itself had the right texture but was very bland. I'll make apple coffee cake again because it's easy and I love baked apples, but I'll take the layers and put it into a different batter.

This is a delicious recipe. My husband is diabetic, so I did use some Splenda in place of some of the white sugar. I found the batter to be very thick, so I added about 2 TBSP of milk to loosen it up a bit. Though delicious alone, I felt like experimenting and added a glaze made with 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon, and enough water to make it drizzling consistency. This added to the overall look of the cake. I didn't have any problems with the cake sticking to the pan. I used cake release spray, which I use with all my cakes. Thanks for a keeper!

This turned out AMAZING!!! The inly thing I did different is put more layers in (thinner layers of batter), and sprinkled apples on the bottom of the bunt pan so when I flipped it is have apples on top! The sweetness is perfect for us, and this cake pears wonderfully with a cup of coffee!! A great way to start a Saturday morning!!

I recommend adding a powder sugar icing on top.  I also followed the recommendations of others and cut the sugar to 1.5 cups, using 3/4 white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar.  Also added 1 c. of whole wheat flour as part of the 3 cups.  Could use more cinnamon and maybe another apple.

Oh my goodness this was a disaster.  First of all, it fell apart.  Yes, I let it cool in the pan for 15 minutes - it stuck to the pan (yes, I greased it) and fell to pieces when I flipped it over.  (Not a problem for my kids, they don't care what it looks like.)  It really didn't taste that great.  The batter parts don't have any spices in them (easily fixable, I know) so it was very bland, except where the apples were.  The cake was also very dense - not in a good way.. just dense.  One last thing,  It took a long time to be done.  Like an extra 15 minutes before the stick came out clean.   It wasn't terrible.  The recipe has potential... but this wasn't great as it was and I don't think I'll make it again.

Pretty good but I did make several changes that were suggested.  Cut the sugar in half (1 cup) and used Demerara sugar instead of white.  Omitted the oil and used 1 cup of low-fat natural yogurt.  Replaced 1 cup of plain flour with 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  I also dropped one of the eggs (not literally...used 3) and it worked out fine.

This is deeeelicious.  I was out of apples and orange juice.  The beauty of coffee cake is the freedom to improvise.  I used canned peach slices (drained) for the apples.  I used a grape/apple/blueberry/peach juice to replace the O.J.  I separated the batter into two round cake pans and baked just fine with maybe a few more minutes bake time.  Turned out perfectly, and tastes heavenly. I'd even bake this for my inlaws.  ;)

I used bottled apples from last year's harvest and it turned out great.  This was a moist, heavy cake - great for breakfast with a tall glass of cold milk.

It was an interesting concept to have a plain cake with layered apple + sugar. However, putting the apples on top made them not cook correctly. Also, the sugar/cinnamon mixture was purely sugar and thus stuck to the sides of the pan and came out over crunchy by the time the cake had cooked. It was strange to have the difference in textures from the sugar mixture in the middle and that on top. My cake turned out crumbly and stuck to the pan even though I buttered it, but even so it's overall not a cake I'll probably try out again.

It didn’t make much, so next time I will double the recipe or make 2 pans. But otherwise so good, a little too mushy in the middle, but I’ll leave it to cook a tad longer next time.

I used thawed previously frozen apples- otherwise followed the recipe exact. Served it warmed up the next day- consistency similar to bread pudding. With vanilla ice cream- amazing. My guests loved it.

Super tasty, and moist!  I made it with half of  gluten free all-purpose flour from Trader Joe’s,  the other half brown rice flour, for my husband needs a gluten free diet.  Unfortunately, I needed something else to help it hold together, because it fell apart too easily.  My fault, not the recipe.  I will have to further modify it for gluten free.

Tasted OK, looked terrible. I followed the instructions exactly (except replaced OJ with grapefruit juice, since that was all I had available.) Cake split in half along the middle apple layer, and attempts to reunite the halves were unsuccessful. Tasted OK (maybe a little too sweet), but looked like a car wreck. Oh, well...

The cake turned out very moist and was easy to make. I think it makes a difference which kind of apples you use as to whether the cake turns out dry. I was a little concerned that the bottom layer of apples were going to fall apart when I flipped the cake over, so I pushed them down into the batter after spreading them on top.

Love, love, love this recipe! My new go to coffee cake recipe. To add moisture, I added 1/8 cup coconut oil ( no coconut taste), and 4Tablespoons butter. To help with rising, I added 1T baking soda. Great recipe!

This is a simple cake to make, however, I found it to be too sweet.  Next time I will cut the sugar in half for the batter.  3 Cups of sugar in the batter on top of the sugar it calls for to go onto the apples is too much.  This cake is the perfect amount of dry on the outside and the perfect amount of moist on the inside.  Inside, the texture is almost similar to bread pudding due to the apples.  If you like a lot of moisture, use ALL the apples.  I didn't use all the apples because it looked too much for me.  I probably used 3.  I also added nutmeg to the batter and used 2 cups all purpose flour and 1 cup 100% whole grain stone ground flour and I used Truvia Baking Blend for the sugar.  I also added raisins on top of the apples.  Delicious, but next time it will not be as sweet. Great base recipe!

This was ok. The quality and flavors of the apples needs to be good in this recipe as there is no spices to fill out the flavor of the cake except in the topping, I do not recommend using Granny Smiths, a Fugi for Macintosh would be much better flavor wise. The texture was heavy and I had to add more liquid to the batter in order to be able to stir it.

I made it for a meeting at work and everyone loved it.  I reheated it in the oven and it was just as delicious the next day.  I made a few adjustments to make it low-fat.  I reduced the oil by half and used applesauce instead of 1/2 c. of oil.  I only had apple juice on hand and used that instead of orange juice.  I used egg beaters for 2 of the eggs.  And it all turned out delicious!

Great recipe.  I used whole wheat flour and half white, half brown sugar and followed the recipe otherwise.  I had to bake for 90 minutes.  Great reviews from my family!

Simply ok. Nothing to rave about, but pleasant to have with a cup of coffee in the morning. Makes a big coffee cake, I suggest halving the recipe.

I thought it lacked something. My dad liked it, but he's a huge fan of just about anything apple. Might want to add a little kick to it with a stuesel topping.
