Loved it, I did make a topping that in my opinion made it 5 stars.  Also bumped up the lemon juice to 5 1/2 tables. 2 teas of grated lemon peel, used 1/4c. plain yogurt instead of oil and egg whites instead of reg eggs.  The topping is 1c. flaked coconut, 1/3 c. sugar and 2 tables. melted butter.  If you use the topping you just have to turn the temp down 3/4 of the way through so the coconut doesn't burn... I just checked it until done.

One of the best lemon breads I've ever made. I made this last night for the boys for breakfast this morning and they raved about it. I had one bite (I'm watching my sugar/carb intake) and I had to restrain myself from having more. It's really like a moist pound cake. My son did ask me to add more coconut next time. I'll probably double the coconut when I make this again. And I will make it again. This would be a wonderful gift loaf.

I halved this recipe to try it out and it made one mini loaf pan.  I baked at 325 for 40 minutes (started checking at 25).  To give this a nice tart lemon taste I added 1/4 teaspoon of lemon extract.  Please note, this loaf can be crumbly when cutting after it is cooled.  I only sliced a few pieces and wrapped the rest to refrigerate to see if it firms up.  This is a moist, light and flavorful cake.  I served alone or with the microwave lemon curd recipe.  Will make again soon!!!

This is one of the best quick breads I have ever had.  It definitely has a dense, moist, pound like consistency.  And the lemon flavor is just perfect. I made the batter exactly as written, and when it was done, I poked holes in the warm bread and added a sugar, lemon juice glaze.  I already had some toasted coconut, so I sprinkled that on top.  This bread is even better the second day!  Will definitely make again.

Followed recipe exactly. It was moist and pretty good. I thought that it could be a lil more lemony. The glaze was a nice touch. I sliced the loaf and drizzled so it could get between the slices. YUM!

It's a decent desserty bread with a light lemon flavor.  If you're looking for something tart, punchy, or very lemony, this is not the right recipe.  Also, the coconut adds and interesting texture and adds sweetness, but everyone I serve it to says they can't taste the coconut.  Monitor your cooking temp carefully - it tends to get dry quickly.  For me, it only takes 55 minutes at 350deg.

This easy recipe is especially wonderful if the lemon juice and zest is replaced with orange juice and zest.
I shared some of this loaf with a friend and she asked for the recipe.

I changed the recipe a bit..halfed the butter and added a lemon yogort to replace it. Also I only used half the milk. It was done in 40 minutes but I lefted in for 45 (mine is a bit toasty on the egdes)!

This was good, and not too tart.  I increased the coconut to 1/2 cup and it definitely could have used more â€“ maybe a full cup.  I also added lemon zest to my glaze.  This produced a nice lemony loaf that I would make again.

Delicious. I did omit coconut because my DH is a texture freak and loves lemon, so I wanted him to be able to enjoy the loaf too. I used 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice in the bread and it still wasn't lemony enough so I dropped in a little lemon extract too. Everything else remained the same, but if I crammed all that batter into one 8x4x2 pan, it would have been a huge mess. So this easily makes 2 smaller loaves, and mine were done at 41 minutes. DO NOT set the timer on your oven for the recipes stated time and forget about it. You will have dry loaves. Be sure to keep a watchful eye on your cooking time.

I'm not exactly sure what happened with this recipe, it ended up tasting ok but I probably won't try it again.  I would recommend that you cream your butter and sugar first b/f adding the lemon juice.  I added mine all at once like the recipe states and it looked like a "curdled"  mess which I think caused mine to not rise as much as it should've.  I did add more lemon juice and coconut as other reviewers suggested and the flavor was good which is why I gave it a 4 stars otherwise I would rate it a 3.

I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still plenty sweet!  For a more coco-nutty taste, add 1/2 tsp coconut extract to the loaf mixture.  It will enhance the flavor of the flaked coconut without being overpowering.

Excellent flavor! If a mild lemon-slight coconut flavor is what you're looking for, this is it. If you want something more lemony follow some of the other reviews. For my house this was perfect. The loaf turned out very moist. Do NOT leave in oven for the full time because it'll come out dry. My (cake?) loaf was done around 46 minutes

AWESOME!!! I made it my own though. subbed extra virgin coconut oil for butter. organic unbleached flour. 1/2 tsp vanilla and unsweetened vanilla almond milk for milk(what i had on hand). frozen fresh coconut thawed. no glaze needed!  made a 1/2 recipe in cupcake tins. wish i made the whole thing!  Its hard for me to part with my coconut oil. Its is the BEST fat ever like gold in this house!!!!  baked them at 325 for about 30 min. removed them promptly from the pan. SO GOOD!!  My toddler is crazy for them and calls them "baby cakes,baby cakes, yumm yumm yumm"!!!

This is a great loaf.  I added 5 tsps of fresh lemon juice and 2 tbls of fresh grated lemon rind.  Just the perfect amount of lemon flavor.  This is a keeper and will definitely make often.  Thanks for the geat recipe.

Very moist and flavorful lemon bread!  The flavor was not tart, but that was OK because I don't really like a tart lemon bread.  I followed the directions, but left the icing off the top because my hubby prefers it plain.  Will make again.  Thank you for posting!

After reading others reviews that this cake wasn't lemony enough, I increased the lemon juice to 6 tsps and added 6 oz. of lemon yogurt instead of milk.  It had a nice lemon flavor but really couldn't taste much of the coconut, so I think I'll increase that next time.  I didn't do the glaze as we like our "coffee" cakes plain.  The texture was excellent, not sure why others had trouble.  Will be making this again.

OMG ~ This was a gorgeous loaf, I followed the recipe exactly (used margarine).  I did double the lemon juice and also 2 teaspoons of lemon extract.  The cake was the perfect combination of lemon and coconut, also loved just how moist this loaf was.  Will certainly be making this recipe again.

Really good! Great flavor with perfect lemon and coconut, moist but light in texture. Followed the recipe except divided the batter equally into 4 bowls and added pastel food coloring to each and then layered them into the pan. Worked out great and the grandkids loved it. I added a conf. sugar, lemon juice and heavy cream glaze with sprinkled coconut right before serving. Great recipe that I will turn to time and time again. Thanks for sharing!

Lovely little loaf with a hint of lemon (and coconut).  Useful as a stand-in for poundcake then covered with lemon zested mascerated strawberries (and more coconut, toasted).  Good stuff!

This loaf was just amazing!!  I did use lime juice rather than lemon- 6 tsp.  and I subbed buttermilk for the milk.  It took 50 minutes in my oven.  The  bread was so moist and tender crumbed.  I got nothing but compliments all day.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Loved this lemon loaf thanks! My cake was ready between 40 - 50 minutes so best to start checking on it at 40 minutes. All depends on your oven I suppose. I must admit, I accidentally added double the required amount of lemon juice so my cake had more lemon flavour than coconut but I will get things right next time. Despite my error, this is a recipe worth trying!

Great recipe!  I substituted the lemon with lime, white sugar with palm sugar, and I grated 1 cup of fresh coconut and toasted it before adding to the mix.  Oh, and I added 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  
It was soft and fragrant and scrumptious!

Scrumptious! I too increased lemon juice to 5 1/2t and lemon peel to 2t. I also decreased sugar to 3/4c. Baked for 1 hour. Perfect. Can't wait to try with lime peel and juice, adding that 1/2t of coconut extract mentioned in previous review.

Here's a healthier version of this bread: 
1/4 C applesauce & 1/4 C plain yogurt instead of butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar, (I used 1/3 C fresh lemon juice to increase the flavor) 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1 cup spelt flour, 1/4 C almond milk (applesauce creates extra liquid so a decrease in milk was necessary) I increased the coconut to 2/3 C because I love the flavor and coconut is traditionally known to be very healthy.
Bake for 55 min. 
PS Utah (where the recipe author is from) is high altitude, so if you're not at high altitude, adjust cook time accordingly.
Turns out delicious and is very tasty with plain yogurt and berries, or jam

I looked for a dessert cake or loaf recipe. We didn't have many ingredients.  I had some lemons, limes and coconut flakes.  I looked at this recipe and tried it.  It was simply amazing.  The flavors were both a bit tart and sweet.  It was scrumptious!  I actually used both lemon and lime juice.  It was a great mix. Delightful dessert!

A nice twist for lemon bread.  I feel that it needs more lemon rind (maybe 2 tsps.) to give it enough zing.....   Also, it is better if stored in the fridge after it has cooled.   Lemon extract makes it taste artificial - at least to my tastebuds.

YUM! I did make a few changes ... I substituted half the butter with plain natural yogurt ... and put in an extra teaspoon of lemon juice in the batter as well. This turned out reallly, really moist and delicious. I baked for 50 minutes in a stoneware loaf pan. After popping out I pre-cut the loaf into portions (but not all the way through so it stayed together) and then drizzled the glaze over so it would soak in better.

This loaf was really delicious. I did add decidedly more lemon juice, nearly doubled the coconut and made a blackberry syrup to serve with it rather than the icing but despite cooking exactly as directed the centre of my loaf did not cook. When I flipped it out of the loaf pan it held together for about 10 seconds before the sides collapsed and the centre oozed out like a lava cake. The sides and top did cook and were very yummy. I guess I'll have to tinker with the baking instructions next time.

I made this for dessert with dinner.  I couldn't wait to try it, so before dinner I had to cut a slice.  It was wonderful all by itself.  I did serve slices of it with strawberry sauce on top.  Was great that way too, but it's good enough to have without the sauce.

Delicious and moist.  It didn't have a strong taste of lemon even though I increased the amount of lemon juice and added 1/2 tsp of lemon extract.  Maybe it's because I omitted the lemon rind??  I baked it for only 55 minutes and it came out perfect.  Thanks for posting this wonderful and easy recipe!  :)

Outstanding as is - just follow the recipe correctly. I always use butter, and the pan size should be 8x4x2 - which is a little smaller than the standard one, and probably explains the shorter baking time for some. Took exactly an hour, and it sliced beautifully, warm or cold, with a bread knife.

a little dry at the bottom. Try cooking at a lower temperature, or pour some glaze over each piece. Great with toasted coconut on top!

This was a moist and very flavorful bread. The lemon wasn't too over powering either. I added banana and chopped macadamia nuts to get a tropical version.

Yum.  Incredibly easy, bakes within prescribed time frame, and is delicious if you like lemon and coconut.  A little heavy, as others have said, and is reminiscent of a pound cake, so not for huge snacking, but a nice treat.  I brought it with me to a friend's house yesterday and we all enjoyed with tea for a dessert after a lovely meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very good.  I took the advice of several reviewers however, and amped up the flavor with extra lemon juice, rind and coconut flavoring.  I also made extra glaze.

Great recipe. I added a bit of vanilla. I had cooked it at 175C (I'm in Australia), and it took pretty much exactly 60 minutes. It came out a bit crumbly but not dry. Fantastic flavor. Also, DEFINITELY cover the top with foil for 1/2 (if not more) of the baking time or the top will get too brown. I followed that tip from the other reviewers and it came out fine.

I thought this was just ok.  It did come out moist, but there was barely any lemon taste or coconut.  If I make again, I may add more lemon juice (or extract as one reviewer did).
