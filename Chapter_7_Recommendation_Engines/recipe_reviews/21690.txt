These were delicious, but to save time, instead of making the pastry part, Goya makes empanada discos in pkgs of 10 in most grocers freezers.  This saves lots of time.  You can make the filling ahead of time, then thaw the discos and right in the oven.

DH devoured these. I have much more respect for people who willilingly prepare things like this on a regular basis. =) This recipe did prompt me to go buy those rings that go on your rolling pin to get the dough thickness accurate and a pastry mat with the circles. Next time I'll probably double the pastry dough recipe since I got 16 balls that ended up much too thin and tended to tear when the empanadas were shaped. DH also wants to try them with the meat filling from the Puerto Rican Meat Patties recipe on this site.

Pretty good.  I added 3 ancho chiles (dried/deseeded) to meat/water mixture, and after meat cooked and chiles soften, I took 2 cups of reserved juices and blended with chiles, this made  a thicker sauce and alot of flavor.
They were a hit at graduation party!

Thank you for providing a REAL empanada recipe to the mix, where most all of the others turn out to be empanada-filling recipes using pre-made pastry dough! My kids devoured these!

Excellent!  Very yummy and easy to make.  I made mine with cornmeal since I didn't have masa harina and they were great.  These freeze beautifully, so make extras!  You won't believe how yummy they are!

I used a different meat filling, with ancho chillies.  The crust is really good. My family prefered them cooked on top of the stove, using a comal,instead of baked. The masa gets a really nice toasted corn flavor.  The dough rolls out really well also.  I will make them again. I have tried so many wonderful recipes on this website. I love it!

This was good, but I would have prefered the filling for the meat portion to be a little...juicier?  Still, excellent flavor, and will make again.

This was really good, despite the amount of the lard in there, we ended up cutting that almost down to nothing to make it healthier and the taste didn't seem to be any different. Had a little difficulty finding the masa harina until I eventually went to a specialty foods store and picked this up, these probably aren't the same without it! Thanks for sharing, Michele.

This is a great recipe and actually really easy! I cooked my pork in the crock pot overnight and it still came out tasting really good. I also used cheese, corn, and green chiles without the pork to make a second batch. I agree with the other post regarding the dryness of the dough. I quick fry my empanadas instead of baking them, and they turn out moist and delicious ; )

These empanadas were a big hit with my husbands family. But I agree they are somewhat dry. Make sure you have sour cream and salsa for dipping.

The filling was really good. Only i cooked it in a slow cooker and added some hot peppers to it. The filling was a little dry. But i think that it will be fine with a little more butter or less flour. Overall. Really Good!

The filling was great!  I had a little trouble with the dough... probably my fault.  I made 8 small ones and the used the other half of the dough aand made one large one ( like a calzone ) turned out great!

Here's the problem - the timing is ALL wrong.  The pork has to simmer for 1 1/2 hours, bake for 1 hour, and bake in the filling for 20 minutes.  Yet the recipe claims they will be READY in 1 1/2 hours.  VERY misleading, esp. when planning for a party.  You're looking at 3 hours +.

I had left over pulled pork that wanted to do something with.  So, I tried these pork empanadas.  Took my pulled pork (slow cooked pork butt) and added seasonings and cooked a little while longer.  The dough was easy to make, but VERY bland.  Felt like it was a waste of my good pulled pork.

After reading another review I reduced the shortening to about 1/3 cup.  I would NOT recommend reducing the shortening at all- the dough was difficult to work with and cracked easily.  I thought the overall product turned out so-so, but my husband said it was one of the best meals he's ever had!

I had a pork roast that was intended for tamales, but changed my mind when I came across this recipe and it is an easy alternative to the tamale. Not a burrito, not a tamale. My spouse and I will put this one in our favorites for Mexican food night.

The flavor is very dependent upon the salsa you choose. The filling was a little dry. I will be making this again. but I think I will try a chili verde sauce mixed with sour cream next time.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I only made the filling.  I used the Goya discos and served them with homemade guacamole and homemade salsa and brown rice.  The pork filling is excellent.  I actually put the roast in a crock pot with all of the seasonings and onion and garlic.  I'd like to try it with the actual empanada recipe, just didn't have time.

Good; would like the filling a bit more flavorful, and the crust was dry (perhaps a high altitude issue).  We will make them again with larger crusts and perhaps a bit of water added to the dough during mixing.

These were good. All three of my kids liked them, which is close to miraculous.  They were very handy to keep in the freezer and reheat during the busy week.  They were, however, very dry.  I tried doubling the salsa..but still found them to be rather dry.  I will make them again, but next time I'll brown the roast and cook it in a crock pot.  I also doubled the dough ingredients and made the balls a little bigger.  That way, when I rolled them out to about 4", I could trim the edges before rolling them the rest of the way.  This helped keep them from tearing and made nice even circles.

The dough came together nicely and was easy to work with.  It had a very good flavor.  It was kind of dry though and much improved when topped with sour cream.    Perhaps if I had really used it to wrap  pork, it would have been better, but I had leftover chili so that is what I wrapped.

I used the leftovers from a smoked shoulder stewed in enough water to barely cover until it was falling apart. Added a lovely smoked flavor. Did not change anything else. The dough was easy to work and the empanadas came out flakey, savory, and delicious. We will make these again.

I've made this recipe several times now. My only adjustments are scaling up and using a slow cooker. I usually get big pork shoulder from Costco so I double or triple the recipe. I get the best flavor if I mix together the seasonings and then rub it around the outside of the roast before placing in the crock pot. I bag the finished shredded meat into smaller portions to freeze for future use. I weigh my balls of dough to get uniform sizes then use my cast iron tortilla press lined with plastic bag to get perfect circles every time. I agree that the empanadas turn out dry when baked but when I deep fry they turn out perfectly moist (pan-frying produced uneven doneness). I prefer to make lots of empanadas at once and then bag and freeze meal sized portions. I don't thaw before frying. The meat also works well for green enchiladas and tacos.

The filling was good but I was never successful in making the dough. I did it twice but it was crumbly so I ended up putting the filling on a pizza dough, thanks to a quick recipe from this website.

I wanted to give this a five star rating but the filling was bland I made this as the recipe stated, tasted it half way through the cooking time, it was bland so I added more of the spices to suit my tastes.

Not sure what I did wrong. It wasn't good and it was underbaked. I used only the dough recipe and I filled it with shreded cheese to accompany chicken tortilla soup(found on this web site) and I also did some "dessert" empanadas stuffed with strawberry jam.  I'll keep trying.

We used this recipe just for the dough, but it was EXACTLY what we were looking for.  My husband spent some time in Paraguay and he said these were very authentic tasting.  We used to use the frozen empanada discs, but they are no longer carried near us.  After trying this recipe, I'm not sure we ever will again, the dough tasted so much better!  Thank you SO much, we're thrilled to have found this recipe!

I didn't use this for empanadas, just to cook the pork.  This was very good, rich, and I think it's a versatile recipe.  I made wet burritos once and another time diced the pork instead and used it as a pasta sauce. I used extra onion, reduced the sauce, and used my immersion blender.  The extra onion (well carmelized) once blended thickens the sauce without tasting like onions or needing flour, cornstarch, etc.  My friends didn't know it was the same recipe used in a different way.

I make these for Christmas Eve every year and people fight over them. I also make salsa and put extra in each one because they come out with a crisp crust and juicier inside.(similar to Fresh Salsa I, but always use a sweet onion, drain all the tomato cans and add 2 with diced chilis at the end and just stir so it is chunky)

This year I am also doing half with 505 Green Chili instead - I am sure they will be DElicious.

Was okay. A little bland. The dough was a little dry when fixed exactly according to directions. Next time, will make sure that the dough is more moist and will add more flavorings into the filling. Oh, and I used pork chops instead of a pork butt. Still, my kids liked them. They're very easy to handle without utensils and will be great on the go (think "Hot Pockets"). Thanks for sharing this recipe. Will let you know how they turn out the next time I make them and any adjustments I'll make.
