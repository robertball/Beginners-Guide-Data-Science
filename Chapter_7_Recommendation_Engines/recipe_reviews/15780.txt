Doesn't taste like pork and beans at all.  Tastes like a nice cinnamon bread with a crunchy crust.  I do like the fact that the pureed beans add protein and fiber to the bread. I used Bush's original recipe beans with brown sugar and bacon instead of the traditional tomato based pork and beans. Fiber + protein + good taste = 5 stars

With a name like that, I simply had to give it a try.  What a nice surprise!  The aroma is fantastic.  It carried all the way outdoors.  The texture is moist and it has a nice crunchy crust.  The taste is superb.  Easy to make, lovely to smell and wonderful to taste.  What more could we ask for?  I will be passing this recipe on.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe, almost identical to the 'Pork-n-Beans Cake' from this site. You don't have to puree the beans, just smash them well with a spoon and you'll be fine (and save on clean-up). Here's a link to the pork-n-beans cake, so you can compare and read more reviews (and there's a picture).

Surprisingly very good.  Does not taste like beans, but like a cinnamon bread.  Very easy to make.  Great conversation food.

I am giving this bread the lowest rating I could because it is the most bland bread I've ever tasted. I made exactly to the instructions and it just tastes like nothing to me. It was a little dry, but that could have been execution on my part. However there's no reason the bread should have been so bland when I followed the directions exactly. They don't taste like beans, but thwey don't really taste like cinnamon or anything either. I ended up throwing the loaf out. I think you'd be better off pureeing the beans and putting them in another type of bread. It is a good idea for a hidden source of fiber etc, but not flavor!

This recipe was good.  It is very similar to one I already had.  The only differnce is my recipe calls for 1 c. of raisins, soaked in 1 c. boiling water and it had only 3 eggs.  My kids do not like raisins in their food, so I put them in with the beans when grinding with the food processor - they never knew they were actually in there - just all the nutrition!

This recipe is excellent. I cut all the ingredients in half and baked only 1 9x5x3 pan, and found that the bake time is then reduced to 45 minutes.

I thought this recipe was fantastic. My husband could hardly wait for it to cool down. I baked mine in coffee cans and got three cans using the 13oz size. This recipe will be used quite often.

Excellent. I didn't change a thing. The next time I make it, I might try a low fat version of substituting half the oil with pumpkin or prunes or applesauce and maybe using egg substitute or egg whites for the eggs . . . but then why mess with a GREAT thing?

I first made this over a year ago and took it to work.  I wouldn't tell anyone what was in it and made them guess before I would tell them.  Obviously no one guessed correctly but it was liked by all.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!!

A friend of mine asked for me to find a recipe for pork and bean bread and found this one. I have altered it a little. I use 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil. I also use a blender for all the wet ingredients and blend into the dry ingredients. It does not look pretty. I also add nutmeg, a pinch in with the other spice.  When it comes out of the oven and has been taken out of the pans to finish cooling, I add a little brown sugar on top to form a crust.  I have made this recipe at least 12 times in the last month and it has been a hit so far. I have seen other reviews on here that they did not like, if you are a true baker, you have to modify the recipes some to make it your own.

Aside from leaving out the walnuts, I followed this recipe exactly, and it is DELICIOUS! I was inspired to try it because my daughters and I are reading the American Girls books (Molly, 1944) in which they needed to ration sugar because of WWII. A wonderful lesson, and a keeper! We've made it twice this week. The only thing I would change is the size of the loaf pan, it was too big. We used two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 pans, and the loves baked up higher instead of flatter.

This is a very nice bread, easy to make and great consistency.  One of the best parts is the opportunity to ask people to sample a slice and then tell me what the mystery ingredient is.  Nobody has guessed yet.  Very fun!

This is a great and super easy spice bread.  I substitue one cup splenda for the sugar to cut down a little on the calories.  Other than that I love it just the way it is!!

I substituted unsweetened apple sauce for about half of the oil.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was pretty moist, smelled nice and tasted good but not great.  It was kind of bland I thought.  I guess I'm just not seeing what everyone else thought was so great about this bread...

I made a somewhat keto version of this recipe. I used swerve sweetener and carb quick baking mix. I didn’t have any walnuts so I used Brazil nuts. It does not contain any dairy. I used avocado oil instead a vegetable oil. I think it turned out great. As for the beans, I used Bushes original baked beans.
