These were very tasty...definitely yummy. I used chocolate pudding, which then made them look like chocolate cookies with chunks, instead of just regular cookies with chunks.

Yummy! The distinction in taste between these and any other chocolate chip recipe? Pretty much none. But it's easy, and the cookies are tasty and soft without being mushy. 10 minutes in the oven was right for me, and I used a cheesecake-flavored pudding that wasn't so good on its own. A complete success!

Instead of chocolate chunks I used cut up chocolate Easter eggs (20) and it wasn't enough. Next time I'll use more chocolate. I also used chocolate fudge pudding. After cooking roughly half the dough I decided to add some peppermint extract and so added 1 teaspoon and this half is a lot better than the first half. I also squished half a chocolate egg in the middle of each cookie before baking which improved the amount of chaoolate and also made them look more special. Will make again and will use peppermint again too.

These cookies taste awesome! I used french vanilla pudding. I can't wait to try other puddings.They were very moist and fluffy too! Yummmm!!! Also, when you drop the cookies down on the baking sheet, however you drop it is how it will cook. It will not expand... or at least mine didn't. regardless of the shape and size of the cookie they tasted awesome, can't wait to try them again!

Great cookie!  I used chocolate pudding.  The taste wasn't overly rich, but the cookies remained soft and moist the next day...that's how long they lasted.

My daughter love how these cookies stay soft.  They also retain the shape of the batter as you place it on the cookie sheet, which means they don't flatten and deflate after coming out of the oven.  Plus they are delicious.  Thank you!

These have become my favorite cookie!  I make them with choco/fudge pudding mix and peanut butter chips.  Even my husband loves them and he does NOT have a sweet tooth.  These will not last long.  Yummy!

This is a very versatile recipe that I found years ago on the Jell-o pudding box and lost. so glad i found it here. tonight I used butterscotch pudding with walnuts and chocolate chips. Yummy. My favorite is chocolate pudding with peanut butter chips. Also-as another reviewer mentioned these cookies do not spread out when baking-I flatten them to the shape I want. Thanks!

These are very good. I think my recipe has a little more flavor but this is quick and easy. My recipe takes a little more time to put together.

I made these twice... once with just softened margarine and the second time with melted.  Personally I liked the texture of the melted better, it just was smoother and gooier.  But my boyfriend like the first batch with softened better.  It was a bit stiffer but still very moist.  So it's all about your preference.  Since my boyfriend is the cookie monster in my house and said these cookies were his FAVORITE ( which is HUGE!), I'll be just softening the margarine from now on!

These turned out great!  I made mine using chocolate pudding and miniature m&m candies.  They were a huge hit with my kids.  I think there are endless possible combinations.  I will definitely use this recipe often.

This recipe worked well with my gluten-free flours, especially with the pudding mix, which helped the cookies to stay whole upon transfer to the cooling rack.. Great solution for often crumbly GF cookies.  
I only had pistachio flavored pudding mix, and it still tasted great!

All I had was the mint chocolate chip pudding and I love mint so I thought, why not? They were great! I had a bunch of friends over and they all loved them. The cookies were even better the next day and thats the day the last one was polished off! I can't wait to try different flavors. This is my new favorite cookie recipe!

These were awesome cookies! I used vanilla pudding and a milk choc/PB chip combo and it was amazing! I did use all whole wheat flour because that's all I had on hand. The only thing was the yield was obviously off. I got no where near 72 cookies and I even made them smaller than I normally would.  If I would have tried, those cookies would have been invisible. Plus, they really don't flatten at all so the picture is kind of deceiving, but they were good so it's ok.
