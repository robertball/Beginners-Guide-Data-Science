Easy,tasty, simple delicious. I reduced the flour by half, and marinated the grouper with salt, pepper and hot pepper sauce.

I made this with Tilapia because that's what I had on hand at my parents house. I also made it for a couple people that don't really like fish and they loved it. I will make this again for sure.

WONDERFUL...Nothing needs to be added or removed. Super fast and easy.
For a great dinner try steamed asparagus with slivered almonds, fresh corn on the cob and  Loaded baked potatoes. Looks and taste like you have slaved mover the stove all day. :)

Extremely easy and amazing tasteâ€¦. I really don't like to eat most fish and only eat it for the health benefits. This dish I loved and my husband said it was one of the best ever, and he also eats out at great restaurants. I didn't modify much, just added a little parsley for the color, a little less salt for health, and since I didn't have lemon pepper I added a little more lemon and pepper.

This is a very good recipe.  However, it appeared to have too much pepper.  I cut it down slightly, but it was still too peppery.  I will make it again with a tsp rather than a T of pepper.  Other than that, it is really delicious.
