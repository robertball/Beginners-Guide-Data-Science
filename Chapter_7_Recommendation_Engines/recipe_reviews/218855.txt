Very good, not too difficult to prepare.  I used feta instead of parmesan simply because I had it and thought that since the rest of the pasta was Greek-style I might as well use a Greek-style cheese.  Would definitely make again!

I basically followed the recipe, except used mild Italian sausage (instead of hot), and a can of diced tomatoes (instead of fresh tomatoes) and we really enjoyed it.  My husband likes the olives, but finds them a little overpowering, so next time, I will cut them into quarters.  Very tasty and easy to make!
