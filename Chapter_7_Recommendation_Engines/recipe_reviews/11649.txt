I don't care for the taste of shortening so I too used 1/2 cup margarine instead of the shortening.  Before working the dough into balls, I put the dough in the fridge for atleast an hour.  It made the dough easier to work with.  I also waiting until the cookies came out of the oven then dusted them with the powdered sugar.  I received many requests for this recipe and will use it often.

I totally changed this recipe and made some awesome snickerdoodles! I used a white cake mix and rolled the dough balls in a sugar/cinnamon mixture. They turned out great:)

Had trouble with the first batch. Texture & taste were poor. Then I chilled the dough for about an hour & baked them 2 minutes longer than suggested. Great results! Texture was better, these taste alot like a brownie.

Tastes much better(more chocolatey) than recipes where you melt chocolate squares. Very soft and chewy. EXCELLENT! I'm emailing it to all my friends

This cookies were excellent.  I took them to a party and everyone raved about them.  My only advice is to put them in the refrigerator for a few minutes prior to baking so they are easier to handle when you roll them.

This is a fun recipe because it is so easy! I've made these cookies tons of times, and kids love 'em. I've tried this recipe with many different kinds of cake mix, such as: Yellow cake, Dark Chocolate, and Devil's food flavors. The yellow cake ones come out a little softer, and have a slightly different dough texture - I've learned. Anyway, all the flavors come out fine, and I reccomend you try it with all of them!

These cookies tasted great. I did make a change though: Instead of using the 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening, I used 1/4 cup plain shortening, and 1/4 cup butter. I beat those two ingredients together with the eggs and water, with a handmixer. I stirred in the cake mix by hand. A TIP: My batter turned out to be very stickey. I didn't want to chill it and have to wait, so I just took small spoonfuls of the batter, dropped it in the confectioners sugar, covered it completely, THEN used my hands to mush it into a ball shape, while still in the sugar. They still looked pretty in my opinion! Check out my picture. :)

I lost a booklet of cake-mix cookie recipes and was trying to find a substitute.  These are delicious.  I have made them both with shortening and with butter.  Butter has a little more flavor, but if you are trying to keep a batch for more than the day, the shortening ones did not harden as fast.

These cookies are THE BEST! My husband never eats cookies-but couldn't get enough of these. I also made several dozen for a large event in my town and received SO many compliments...I've been asked for the recipe numerous times since then! They are SO easy, and taste and look great!!!!

they were good, but not something I would replace a normal cookie recipe with. Super for bake sales or needing cookies quick. They tasted like flat cakes.

These tasted great. Whoever made the comment that it tastes like a muffin top, they were right on. It tasted more like a cake shaped cookie than I thought it would, but I still liked them. The hubby says that they are a keeper. However, I did adjust the ingredients a little. I used a 1/2 cup of applesauce (the one with no added sugar) instead of the shortening and the water. The batter was very sticky so I just used teaspoons to drop some batter into the powdered sugar. Once coated, they were easy to shape into balls. And, my oven cooks a little quicker than normal so they only took 6 minutes in the oven. Just make sure that you grease the pans or else the cookies will stick. Thanks for the recipe.

I used a supermoist triple chocolate fudge cake mix (it has mini-chocolate chips in the mix already) instead of the devil's food cake mix. Other than that change, I followed the recipe as is. Baked for exactly 9 minutes (I baked the first batch for 10 minutes and it wasn't as gooey as I like my cookies).

Easy to make, but taste of cookies was a little bland. Could potentially be caused by whatever brand of cake mix purchased. Will try BC next time.

Very good and easy to make.  I used canola oil instead of shortening and they were perfect!  They got a little thick when mixing them with a hand mixer.  I added one tbsp. of water.  Also, next time I'll use my stand mixer since it's got a little more power.  Overall, these remind me of cookies I use to make with my grandma.  I will definitely make these over and over again.

We thought these tasted like chocolate puff cereal & I'm not so sure if that's a good thing. The confectioners sugar melts over the cookie so they're not very pretty when they come out of the oven. I tried to cover them up w/extra powdered sugar, but you could still see the beige color of the melted sugar. They stayed nice & soft & puffy tho.

EVERYONE LOVES THIS RECIPIE! And it is sooo easy to make. Just never use a cheap look alike cake mix as it obviously does not taste the same nor does it bake as plump.

Used butter instead of shortening, chilled in fridge. They were still sticky but I coated my hands in powdered sugar before rolling and it worked well. Moist, chewy, easy!! Hardest part is hiding from the kids!

So I used sanding sugar to coat the cookies and added dried cherries for flavor.  These made such good cookies ... they tasted like little brownies with chewy cherries inside.  I will make these again and try other additions.  :)

Did not turn out moist and chewy like I've had in past. Is easy but not as decadent as I'd have liked.

ooh the possibilities!  I altered this recipe a bit based on another similar recipe - I used 1/2 C oil, cake mix & 2 eggs (with one box of cake mix).  Was super easy and really good and I added some melted chocolate mints so it had a nice minty chocolaty taste.  Next time, I think I'll add white chocolate chips, or maybe some almond extract and top with sliced almonds...or...so many possibilities!

These were pretty good.  I thought the devil's food cake was slightly bitter.  I will make these again but with maybe a yellow cake mix or other flavors.

Good cookies and easy. I like that I don't have to measure out the flour and then the sugar. Very easy. Thick batter. My poor mixer had a hard time keeping up. I did stick them in the fridge for about a half an hour so they were easier to handle. They remind me of muffin tops. I made them with chocolate cake mix but may try different flavors. I don't really like the look after being cooked dipped in the powdered sugar, I ended up giving them an extra dusting. Over all very yummy!!!

These are tasty, easy crackles.  I made my cookies twice as big and they needed 4 extra minutes cooking time.  They looked great the next day, not pasty at all.  Just like crackles should look.

Thanks!  I just tried this recipe and it was a hit, great texture and taste. I did have to, right after baking, need to re-sprinkle with confect. sugar, because it was already getting the pasty look, and I was sure to coat well before baking, no big deal, though.  These won't last long in this house :-)

oh my goodness!! im in love! I just made a batch of these this morning.I used DH devils food cake mix. It was sooo super easy. It yielded about 2 and a half dozen. I rolled half of them in powdered sugar which turned out beautiful! Just like the pictures. The other half I just baked plain with no powdered sugar and when they were cooled I placed a hersheys hug in the middle! It looks so cute! Thank you for a great and easy recipe!! This is a keeper!!!

This is a wonderful recipe if you are in a hurry to crank out cookies or need to bake in bulk.  I love the original recipe of Chocolate Crackeles by C&H Sugar and this recipe doesn't not compare (different flavors), but it is still a wonderful cookie.  I just had to crank out and bake 17 dozen cookies for a Halloween party and this was the recipe I selected- these cookies were the first to go and received lots of compliments on them.  I also tried a few batches of "Snickerdoodles" using a white cake mix instead of devil's food and rolling them in cinnamon & sugar instead of confectioners' sugar--another delightful cookie.  You have nothing to loose by trying this recipe--it  is super easy, fast, and delicious.

The recipe is delicious, LOVE it. However, the heat is too high for the cookies. As I was rolling the walnut sized balls I set the oven for 340, as was suggest by a friend. I DIDN'T pre-powder the cookies, the first batch I had to powder them after they came out so I figured I'd save myself steps. I checked the cookies after 8 minutes and put them back in for another 2 after that, checked them again... let them cook for another 2-4 minutes. They came out PERFECT, not as crackly as the recipe photo shows but absolutely perfect. THANKS SO MUCH! Hope my review can be helpful. This would definitely get a 5 star if not for the temperature issue. =)   Recipe tweeks.... (+)one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract (+)one Tablespoon of whole milk (-) one Tablespoon of Water instead of 375 degrees, 340 degrees. 12-14 minutes instead of 10 Powdered cookies AFTER cooked.

Disappointing.  The cookies were very light and crisp, like a wafer.  Not especially tasty.  I used chocolate cake mix, and the kids didn't even finish half a batch.  I'd highly recommend Cream Cheese Cookies IV over these, which is similar but with the addition of cream cheese.

I have made some complicated chocolate cookies with melted chocolate, etc. and these were so much better (and easier).  Tastes like a brownie.  I used 1/2 c. softened butter instead of shortening.

So soft and chewy! After I baked them, I realized that these cookies were just like the cookies that my mother used to put peanut butter chips into (no powdered sugar) but she lost the recipe.I will try that next time. I did not have any butter flavored shortening, so I just used softened margarine.  The recipe was so easy that my 3 year old son did most of the work (including rolling in powdered sugar- big mess!) and they still turned out perfect.

*Very important to note*- Box cake mixes are now 15.25oz, instead of the 18.25oz they used to be. I just made this following the given directions, & it was way too moist to make cookies. It was more like batter. I added flour until I achieved a cookie dough consistency.

I used this as a base to create dark chocolate chipotle cookies! I added 3 tablespoons Hersheys Special Dark cocoa, 2 tablespoons chipotle powder and an extra tablespoon of water. I also added a tablespoon of oil and used margarine rather than shortening. Came out absolutely amazing! Just the right amount of sweet and heat!

I rated 4 instead of 5 stars because the batter was very thick and sticky and hard to work with - NOT a reflection of the end result though!

exactly what I was looking for. I tried another recipe from this site and made a batch from scratch and these.  These were way better. I was extremely disappointed in the other ones.  I only had one cake mix that's why I had to do from scratch.  I will probably never do them from scratch again, these are perfect!  I didn't dip them in the sugar before baking. I am going to dust them when I put them out.

Received several compliments at the annual Cookie Exchange! The changes I made were adding another 2 tablespoons of water, a quick pour of egg whites in addition to the 2 eggs and I used butter instead of shortening. I took the advice of other reviews & left the batter in the fridge to cool overnight. The batter the next morning was still messy to handle but as soon as I placed in the confectioner's sugar, it became manageable and easy to place on baking sheet. My first "walnut" sized batch baked fast and were a little crunchy. I made the balls a little bit bigger and timed 13 minutes in the oven-they came out so airy and fluffy! Sprinkling some holiday sprinkles on top before putting in the oven added a nice touch to the final product. Great quick and easy recipe! A+!!

They are okay but not quite what I was expecting.  There is a high end bakery, Sofra, in the Boston area and they make an earthquake cookie that looks almost exactly like these.  I was not expecting them to be exact but close.  They really are still tasty!!  One problem I had was I don't know how anyone can get 4 dozen, I got 3, and I rolled them each the size of a walnut and the cookie size seemed reasonable.  I went with easy and next time I will try a from scratch recipe to hopefully get what I am looking for.  With this recipe I might as well just made a box of brownies, would have been much easier.

I made these just as the original recipe is and they were very good. Then I made them with adding a bad of crushed Heath english toffee bits and mixed some cocoa in with the powder sugar.  Made them quite rich but a great variation

These cookies are incredibly rich--almost too chocolaty! As other reviewers have said, it really is necessary to refrigerate the dough for 1-2 hours beforehand--it's extraordinarily sticky. I used margarine instead of shortening, and it turned out just fine.

Update: I turned these into candy cane crackles by adding 1/2 tsp. of peppermint extract and pressing Candy Cane Kisses into them immediately after baking. Yum!

This is a very easy recipe. I have made these before when there are about 13 ingredients so I was really hoping this could be replacement. Unfortunately, not so. I am not saying they are bad. They are a really good quick fix for a chocolate cookie but as for putting them out for holiday or company I would not. Mine were flat like they melted before they baked. I even froze the rolled balls thinking they might bake better but, no. This recipe is good for a craving but that's all.

this is commonly sold in almost every ordinary bake shop in the philippines but a few sell the best tasting ones which are soft and chewy inside. we call them here "crinkles".

The cookies smelled wonderful in the oven! I followed the advice of others and refrigerated the dough for about 30 minutes in the freezer. After baking, I let them rest a few minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to racks, and let them cool for only a few minutes before I ran out of patience and ate some. The texture inside was a bit cake-like, but that's slightly expected because of the cake mix ingredient. The cookie wasn't too sweet, and it had almost like a... bittersweet chocolate flavor. Easy to make, pretty good-- will make again some other time when I'm craving chocolate.

These were ok.  I think they tasted like a cake mix cake but looked like a cookie.  Also, the turned out really flat and just not my favorite.

I made this with a triple chocolate cake mix with mini chocolate chips.  I also let the dough sit in the fridge for 1 hour and also let the cookies rest on the pan for 5 minutes before removing.  They were a hit with my children as well as nieces/nephews! (grown-ups too)

These were delicious! I had a little trouble mixing it with my hand mixer--should have used the Kitchen Aid. Very easy and very good!

I have made these several times and taken them to work. They are super easy and amazingly delicious. I have never refrigerated mine and they turn out fine. Make sure you roll them in a lot of powdered sugar though because the shortening really soaks it up. I have also made these cookies using a lemon cake mix rather than devils food, and they were delicious as well.

These are so moist and delicious and soooo easy!!  My daughter loved them! (and I couldn't stop eating them, just beware!)  You can make these as little or as big as you want.  And I was skeptical that they weren't done at first but they are such a moist cookie that it is very deceiving.  One of my favorites now!  Thanks.

Yummy! These were delicious and SO easy! We served them to our dinner guests and everyone kept going back for more. This will be a regular in our cookie rotation.
