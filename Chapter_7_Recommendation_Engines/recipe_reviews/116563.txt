Love it! I tried this recipe yesterday and it was soooo tasty. Not too sweet, not too creamy, everything is just great.

I made this pie once last year and I gave it to a co-worker as a goodbye gift. I didn't try any of it but she said it was awesome. I hope she didn't lie! hehe
I do know it looked and smelled great though.

I used to make this pie in the 80's and then lost the recipe.  I have searched cooking web sights  for years.  Am so glad to find it here.  Thank you so much.  This was my family's favorite!  They will thank you too.
