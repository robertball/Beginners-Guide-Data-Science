We loved this!  I was confused about the canned corn, and whether I should drain it or not.  I did, and the recipe came out great.  Thank you for submitting!

I love this recipe. I use a 16 oz bag of frozen corn instead of canned and add about 1/2 cup milk to make up for the liquid. Also, no sugar, it doesn't need it, there is enough sugar in the cornbread mix.

For a simple recipe, this dish comes out quite well.  I've made this "Scalloped Corn" dish two years in a row for Turkey Day to complement my more complicated recipes.  It's not a gourmet recipe, so it doesn't have a lot of complex flavors or textures-- it's a straight forward, stick to your ribs kind of side dish that adults and children both enjoy (my family calls it a cornbread, which it kind of resembles).  As weird as it is, I've noticed different people can follow this exact same recipe with significantly different results.  For example, when my sister tried to follow this recipe, it came out looking like mush-- I have no idea why.  In any event, I agree with other reviewers that if you are using the Jiffy mix, to cut down on the sugar (I use half the recommended amount).  I also increased the baking time, but every oven is different, so just remember to check on it a couple times while it's baking.

creamed corn? YUCK! but i've had a can of the stuff in my pantry for over a year. I figured I'd give this recipe a try. Oh boy, is it GOOD!!! Next time I will cut back on the sugar and experiment with half the amount of butter but regardless, I will make this over and over and over.

This is very good and easy to make.  I like it better baked in a 8x8 or 9x9 pan for about 50 minutes.  Let it set for a few minutes before serving. Delicious.

First time I tried this I used all the butter specified. It was so delicious, but also so greasy I couldn't eat much. Since then, I've at least halved the amount of butter specified and it tastes just as good. Either way, my family (kids included) LOVE it.

Myself and my entire family loves this dish!  The best part is it is sooo much better than my Mother-In-Law's scalloped corn dish and that's coming from my husband who is rather partial to his mother's cooking!  The only change I make is to omit the sugar as this is plenty sweet without it.  Thanks for a great side dish!

For years, at Thanksgiving I had always made Scalloped Corn using crackers.  This year I still wanted to serve Scalloped Corn, but wanted to 'update' the recipe by making it a bit more exciting.  I came across this recipe and thought I'd give it a try.  My family LOVED it!  It was the hit of our Thanksgiving Dinner. From now on I will use this recipe when making Scalloped Corn. Thanks!!

This is the dish that I get requests for all the time.  Whenever we have get-togethers I am always asked to bring this.  It is so full of flavor!  hint: DO NOT USE FAT FREE SOUR CREAM :)

Stand alone, very good.  Buttery and a complimentary cornbread sweetness.  I added fresh chive and minced garlic in subsequent batches with spectacular results.

I followed this recipe to the letter and oh...was it good! Solid on the outside and ooozy in the middle. Just what I remember from my mammaw's T-day dinners. She was 1/2 Creek Indian and 1/2 Southern. Who knows corn better. 

They called it maize you know :-)

Loved it!

Yum! Cut the butter in half & used half the sugar with a Jiffy cornbread mix (which is already sweet). Just like Grandma's!

Nothing special here. It's corn in corn muffin mix and nothing more. I expected a lot more after reading the number of five star reviews.

A DEFINATE KEEPER!!   My husband (then boyfriend) used to always compare my cooking to his mother's.  Scalloped corn (like many other recipes) was one recipe that I could never duplicate well for him.  I'd always get the "It's not bad, but I like Mom's better.  Just ask her for her's"  B/c of pride, I kept looking until I came across this one.  The first time I got the "Whoa, this is good.  Even better than Mom's."  followed by, "Write this one down!"  I do do a few things:  I add a bit of shredded cheddar to the mix, prior to baking, and I do drain the regular corn (I don't like mine so wet)  We have this dish almost 3-5 times a month for supper b/c we love it so much!

This was good but changed the recipe a little. Only used 1 Tablespooon of sugar since I used jiffy corn bread mix and it is already sweet. Also tried it once with the butter called for and had a hard time getting it to be done in the middle so tried it again with only 1/3 c. butter. It was much more evenly baked the second time. Thanks for sharing.

I have made this recipe several times and have made some adjustments.  I used 1 can of cream corn & 1 can of yellow corn, used 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1/2 cup of the corn muffin mix, add bacon bits, green onion, 1 cup cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup of the butter, garlic powder, onion powder, Top with bread crumbs & dust with papirika and parsley.  It is a hit everytime.  Enjoy!!

Great side-dish!  I did omit 1 tbsp of the white sugar, and the sweetness was just right.  I think it would've been too sweet with the second tbsp. Easy and good!

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner -- turned out great.  I did add an additional can of corn -- so I used two 15.25 ounce cans of whole kernel corn (drained) and one 15.0 ounce can of creamed corn.  I also omitted the sugar -- it is not needed with the corn muffin mix.  It baked up great - not runny at all and my whole family asked for seconds -- a quick and easy recipe that is a crowd-pleaser.

This stuff is addictive! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers...1. I drained the corn. 2. I did not add the sugar. 3. I added 1 cup shredded cheddar and 4. I added 2 cups chopped ham. 
The recipe says "serves 12". Fat chance of that! It barely served 4 :)

This is awesome! The only thing I changed was to use half the butter, that was plenty. I also used 1 can whole kernel corn and one can cream style. Very yummy!

This recipe turns canned corn into comfort food! I've tried several different recipes similar to this and am very please with the texture in this one. I wasn't sure if I should drain the corn or not so I decided to go in the middle and put 1/2 of the corn liquid into the mixture. It gave a very moist consistency without being mushy. This goes great with holiday meals, and tonight I paired it with "My Kids Favorite Pork Chops"  recipe also from this site and it made a delicous meal!

I've tried sooo many recipes like this...each one turning out to be not exactly what I had hoped for.  We absolutely LOVED this one.  I didn't have any sour cream on hand, so I tried it without, and it was fantastic anyways.  I also baked it in an 11x8 dish, but still at 40 minutes...and it was PERFECT!  It was golden and just a tiny bit crunchy on the edges.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this one!!

I typically don't like when people completely change the recipe and then review it, but I'm going to do that here--sorry.  I followed the advice of Busy Bee and this recipe turned out amazing.  The changes are as follows:
1 can of cream corn
1 can of yellow corn
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup corn muffin mix
Bacon bits (I probably used 1/2 cup or so)
Green onion (maybe 1/4 cup)
1 cup cheddar cheese
1/4 cup butter
2 eggs (as per original recipe)
Garlic powder (a couple tsp probably)
Onion powder (same as garlic powder)
Also, I omitted the sugar in the recipe.
Top with bread crumbs & dust with papirika and parsley.
With these changes, the recipe was a huge hit...though I'm sure it was wonderful as written (which is why I still gave it 5 stars).  Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe, and thank you, Busy Bee for the great recommendations!!!

Another winner from someone that loves allrecipes like me!  This one I doubled for a family reunion and baked for 50 minutes because it was quite watery in the center at 40.  Also note - drain the canned corn!  The recipe doesn't say so but you gotta or it will never set.  Taste sweet and cornbread like and its just the best.  I added a little cajun seasoning to give it a kick.

Made this for Christmas and everyone loved it.  I think it would be great baked on top of individual bowls of chili.

Delicious.  I didn't have any creamed corn, so I used fresh kernel and added a cup of half and half.  Wonderful recipe.  Thank you!

This is a good basic recipe and a great start for going a dozen different directions. I added 2 tsp garlic salt and 3 tsp sage and it really deepened the flavor. If you swap cottage cheese for the sour cream and throw in some broccoli, that's delicious. Swap mascarpone for the sour cream and throw in some finely chopped sun dried tomatoes and that's wonderful. Ton's of ways to spice this dish up!

I've never written a review for a recipe, although I've used many from this site.  This dish was such a hit, I just have to let you know.  I doubled the recipe, thinking there would be leftovers, to my amazement, it was gone!

The top was firm and the center moist.  I did, as in the other reviews, leave out the sugar.  Also, I drained the whole kernel corn. This dish does not need added sugar, this dish is sweet enough without, and was moist enough without the added liquid from the corn. It's easy, quick, and delicious.  What more could you want?

After Thanksgiving dinner, the request was made that I make this my annual addition to Thanksgiving.

If I could give 4-1/2 I would.  I loved this recipe, it was soooo good.  My husband hated it, but that was because of the texture.  I drained the corn, but the texture is like a cross between cornbread and corn pudding.  He was expecting a bread-like texture and he never got over that.  I wish I'd introduced it as "Scalloped Corn" and not even mentioned the cornbread.

This Scalloped Corn was to die for!!!  We licked the bowl clean!!  Did add a 2nd can of cream of corn to make it moister.  Was as good if not better than what we had at ChiChi's back in the day!

I made this as a Thanksgiving side dish today. I was unsure if this was the recipe to make, because my extended family is very picky. This recipe was a great choice by the end of the meal there was only one spoonful left. I received many compliments. Regarding the recipe I did not change any of the ingredients. I did add the liquid from the corn, which made the scalloped corn moist and delicious. I did extend the baking time to 50 minutes. This was a wonderful recipe!!!!

I've made this twice now and loved it each time.  The second time, I added a bit more corn and think I liked it a little better that way.

Good side dish using corn instead of opening up a can and heating it up.  The recipe did not indicate if you should drain the corn so I went ahead and did NOT drain the corn.  Glad I did not because I think the dish would have been too dry.  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing.

This is the first rating I've given, mostly because nothing I've tried until this dish was worth giving feedback to.  This is the best side dish I've ever made and it freezes great too.  I cannot praise it enough.  Thank you Carla for this wonderful recipe.  I didn't change a thing!!!

I am not a big fan of corn bread, but this dish was truly wonderful.  I made it for Christmas and my brother-in-law, who is a great cook, LOVED it and has asked me to make it again!!  It is very easy to make.  I highly recommend it!!

Made it exactly except used just 1 tablespoon sugar. It was perfectly sweet but didn't feel like you were eating dessert. I drained all but about 2 tablespoons from corn and it was a nice combination of very moist but still firm and not doughy. We ate this at our Christmas dinner, got lots of compliments and so I plan to make it  again. SO easy too. Great for kids to help.

I've made this over a dozen times as written, and we just love it. Tonight, I decided to try modifying it. Added 1 c. Colby jack, minced garlic, pepper, onion powder, and I drained the corn. Honestly, the garlic didn't add much, the pepper was unnecessary, the cheese was pretty good, but in my opinion, the original recipe is just as good

Followed the recipe precisely. It's more of a cornbread than anything else. Very good, but kind of a guilty pleasure, since it is pretty fatty. Enjoyed it as a side with a burrito and a tamale. Thought it would be great with (or even on) chilli. Will make it again.

I honestly thought this needed more sugar. Granted, I used a different brand of corn muffin mix (not Jiffy), but I am adding sugar on top when I eat it. Also, I am kind of a sugar-aholic. And I kinda wanted this to taste more like a corn pudding. But yeah, good texture - I drained half the water out of the can of whole corn, but next time I would leave it completely undrained.

Very good. I doubled this recipe for a crowd and in reading other reviews decided to skip the sugar. Didn't miss it at all. What I DID do is to add a jar of roasted red peppers that I finely chopped. It was delicious and got rave reviews. Even my picky father in law liked it.

Delicious! I forgot to tell my husband to save me 2 eggs so when he made our son's breakfast he only left one. I drained most of the water from the canned corn but put a little (maybe 1/4 of the corn liquid) in with the other ingredients to make up for the missing egg. I had to leave it in the oven for about 50 minutes to get it to thicken, but I am impressed. There aren't many things you can bake when you're missing main ingredients that still turn out. Everyone loved it! I'll be excited to try it again soon with the right quantities of ingredients on hand =)

Made this for thanksgiving and it was gone before anything else. The kids loved it and my guests asked for the recipe. Would omit the sugar and I did drain the whole corn.It also took about 10 min. longer to cook.

This was good. I had never had it before and thought I would give it a try. I did cut the butter back as others as suggested. I had something similuar to this a few years back, but it was way better than this recipe. But over all this was good, and makes a good side dish.

Perfect side dish for any get together.  I typically do NOT drain the can corn.  I think it makes for a more moist dish.  I have also cut the butter and substituted apple sauce for as much as 2/3 of the amount of butter.  You could probably cut the butter altogether if your really worried about calories.

I tried this variation of creamed corn for my family.  I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was just odd. Everyone in my family agreed, this one was not a keeper. I think it was the sour cream that gave it a strange flavor, or perhaps the corn muffin mix.

Pretty good recipe. My kids devoured this. This is a great fall and winter side dish. Would be great to take to potluck or covered dish function. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe has a great flavor to it! That being said, it is also very rich. Try reducing the amount of sour cream by 1/4 cup, the taste is still great!!

OMG this was sooo good!  Served it at a  holiday party last night and I doubled it - there were 16 people here and it was 3/4's gone!!!!  I added 2 cups of grated sharp cheese, about 1 tsp salt, and about 1/2 tsp pepper.  I did have to cook this much longer than expected - which I expected due to doubling the batch - I just inserted a knife a few times until it came out clean.  Everyone at the party wanted this recipe!!!  That to me is the ultimate compliment, besides eating nearing all of it!

I have been making a scalloped corn recipe that my aunt gave me for the past 18 years...this is her recipe, but she (and I) don't put sugar in it. I do, however, drain the whole kernal corn before combining the ingredients. I tried it once without draining and it seemed mushy to me.

My recipe OMITS THE SUGAR, I also like to use the JIFFY brand muffin mix, and yes you DRAIN THE WHOLE CORN.  I love this recipe, so does everyone I make it for.  Oh, don't use a more narrow, deeper dish, the recipe will get mushy.

This is a great side dish for any meal.  I omitted the sugar as the muffin mix is quite sweet already. I also add 2 cups of frozen corn kernals and add 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the topo about 10 minutes before dish is done.

I took this to Thanksgiving dinner.  My friend's teenage son who never eats ANYTHING and is an extremely picky eater said, "Who made this corn cake looking thing?"  I said, with dread, "I did. Why?"  He looked at me with wide eyes and said, "THIS IS REALLY GOOD!!!!"  All the kids gobbled it up and some of the grownups.  I HIGHLY recommend this dish.  It is REALLY sweet though.  Be prepared for that.

This was a great easy recipe!  Scalloped corn was a staple at all holiday and Sunday meals growing up.  However, I have never had it with corn bread mix in it.  Added some texture and additional sweetness.  We also added 1/4 C of minced red bell pepper and 2 minced and seeded jalapeno chiles.

Very easy to make, a little bland. But a great and fast prep time side dish.

Would probably be good with some cheese melted on top (like colby jack)...

Personally I thought this was fantastic. It's a lot like the corn cakes you get at mexican resturants. However when I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner, nobody seemed to be a fan. I think it must have been the texture, it was kinda mushy, but the flavor is great. It seemed like there was more corn bread than corn. I think next time I will add an extra can of whole corn and drain the water out of the can. You have to use some water out of the can, otherwise I think it would be too dry.

This was a good recipe...much like the one my mom has used for years.  However, it wasn't nearly as sweet as i am accustomed to, even after doubling the amount of sugar called for.  Next time I will probably quadruple it, and perhaps use both cans creamed corn and reduce the sour cream a bit.  I used reduced fat sour cream with no ill effects...still creamy and a good texture!!

This was excellent!  It is a cross between scalloped corn and corn bread and even those in the family who do not like the consistency of scalloped corn ate it.  I made it for Thanksgiving and my mother-n-law asked me to make it for Christmas!

I looked up this recipe for my mother, and am so glad I did!  I still like scalloped corn with crackers best, but this recipe was great!  There were NO leftovers, and the kids, aged 13 months to 29 years, all loved it!  We will be eating this one again soon!

Dynamite! I was short on sour cream (only had about 4 of) so subbed in a splash of milk. Otherwise, no changes. I drained the corn but not the can of creamed corn. Delish. Will make again..and again...and...

I made this for a last minute request to bring sides and this looked quick and easy to throw together. Never tried this recipe before nor have I ever had scalloped corn so wasn't sure what to expect.  This was a bit hit and is now a permanent request from me for family parties.  I was confused about whether or not to drain the corn so ended up draining it.  I think next time I won't drain it after reading the reviews.  It looks like by not draining it, it'll give it a moist consistency.  Mine wasn't moist but I would have liked it that way even though everyone else thought it was yummy the way it was.

Made this as a dish to pass  a couple times last year for the holidays. I baked it in an 8x8 for 50 min each time came out perfect. I even forgot to add the sour cream once, still came out great .  Everyone is asking me to bring it again!

Very good! Simple to make. For the vegan version I used vegan sour cream, olive oil butter, and was real good.

I also used fresh corn on the cob.

This dish was delicious! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Great twist on the usual corn dishes. I took the suggestion of other reviews and added chives to it. Not only added great flavor, but also added some fun color too! Thanks for sharing.

This was the best recipe for creamed corn, it really didnt last long on the dinner table. I had 14 to dinner and everyone said that the corn was the highlight of the meal!
I had to first make creamed corn, because they dont have it here and then make it into the casarole. Truly Homemade!

This stuff is amazing. I've made it twice now...once as written, and once I cut the butter in half, used fat free sour cream and added an extra box of Jiffy corn muffin mix. Liked it way better the second way. Everyone at the family reunion requested the recipe and had second and third helpings! :)

Very straight-forward, easy to make, and delicious! I made this as a side for Christmas. Everyone loved it. The leftovers heated up nicely and tasted just as good the next day.  While it tasted great the way it was, I think next time I will experiment by adding some fresh herbs (thyme?). I think adding some savory to the sweetness would be really tasty.

Fantastic! Modifications: omitted sugar; used 16oz frozen corn in place of can of whole kernel; added 1/2 C of milk to make up for lost liquid using frozen corn; lightly sprinkled paprika on top for color; crushed crackers on top (with about 1TB of thinly sliced butter pats on top of the crackers). We ate it until we were sick.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner. Myself and my family did not particularly care for it. We didn't mind the texture at all ,but the taste was lacking.  I followed the recipe exact, except I left out the sugar as many other reviewers suggested.

Came on to find a recipe like my mom made when I was young.. with soda crackers.  This version is WAY better.  My whole family loves it.  Making it tonight for about the fifth time since I found it about a half year ago! I use jiffy mix and don't add the sugar. no need.

very good, went over well at our Easter dinner. I didn't have a corn muffin mix so found a recipe on this site and mixed the dry ingredients together and added the eggs, sour cream etc before baking. Wonderful I also used my own homegrown frozen sweetcorn in stead of canned corn, just cuz I had it.

Such a simple a dish and everyone's favorite. Made this dozens of times after spotting it as a Thanksgiving recipe...and it's requested every occasion.  This recipe however, does NOT require sugar and was Not an ingredient on the Thanksgiving recipe called "Corn Bake." I prefer to use frozen corn in place of canned whole corn, (always trying to cut back on salt) or in a pinch will use the low salt canned corn. Delish!

This is the second recipe I tried, of the hundreds I saw and read... I will surely be making this again! Loved it! Much lighter than the last version....I used 1/2 can creamed corn leftover from the previous try. Used 1 can regular corn, and substituted 1 package butter-milk biscuit mix instead of corn muffin mix. (used this up in previous version) Otherwise, everything was as the recipe called for. Baked in 8x8 pan for approximately 30-35 minutes. Scrumptious!! I plan to make this for Thanksgiving without a doubt....Thanks so much!!

I halved the butter to 4 tbsps and halved the sugar to 1 tbsp. It's definitely sweet enough. Simple to make and DELICIOUS. This was alllll eaten up. No leftovers.

I used a pan that was too large for the recipe, so the end result was dried out.  I fixed this by topping it with applesauce, sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg, paprike for color and broiled it. Deliciously moist!

This is my favorite scalloped corn recipe, I goofed and accidentally bought 2 cans of creamed corn but you really couldn't  notice.  I love the crisp edges that form around the perimeter, I scoop those out onto my plate first thing :)

I've tried several recipes for scalloped corn and none compare to this - it is such an interesting and utterly successful combination of scalloped corn and corn bread. I made this for Thanksgiving and my family absolutely adored it - it was the first of the "left-overs" to run out. I'll definitely be making this again . . . and again. . . and again. . .

Everyone in our family loves this. I've been making one similar to this for a couple yrs now and it is always a hit. But, I also add shredded cheddar cheese to the mix and top it as well.  yummo! (and it is the only way I'll eat creamed corn!)

I give this recipe 5 stars!  I made it for Thanksgiving and loved it.  It was very simple to make: I put everything together the night before and refridgerated.  Make sure if you do this, you allow yourself enough time the next day to get the dish back up to room temperature before cooking.  Also, I wonder if the other reviewer's came out soggy because they didn't drain the whole kernal corn?  Make sure you do that.  I also added pepper and minced onion to the top -- fabulous!

I'm not quite sure what I was expecting, but I guess this wasn't it.  It was just different.  It took a lot longer to cook (at least 20 more minutes and maybe longer), and I'm not sure why. Anyhow, it kind of resembled corn mush.  I love corn bread, and I like corn, they just didn't mix very well in my opinion.  I'm sure most of this won't get eaten.  My 2 1/2 year old ate some (it's a clever way to disguise vegetables...if they'll eat the corn mush in the first place!)

This recipe instantly became a family favorite from the very first time I made it. It's now present at nearly every holiday gathering. The best part of all is how simple it is to throw together -- even the day before. Superb!

I made this recipe with our supper tonight with just a couple of minor changes and we loved it. Even my toddler and picky 7 year old ate it! I halved the amount of butter and used light sour cream.  I even left out the sugar and it still had a slightly sweet flavor that everybody enjoyed.

I will have to agree with one of the more recent posts. It is basically cornbread with corn in it. Actually is pretty bland. If you are looking for a recipe that is more of a bread/dressing consistancy, this is for you. If you are looking for a more creamier type corn casserole, try some of the baked creamed corn recipe's on the site.

I have made this year after year at both Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It has become a staple at our family dinners.  I have even caught people eating it for dessert.  I usually make it in a stoneware dish.

I have made this recipe for the past few years and the family always looks forward to it.  This is the only scalloped corn recipe my family likes.  I have to make extra so I can send the leftovers home with my brother.

I catered our 45th class reunion and scalloped corn was one of the side dishes our committee had picked for the menu!  I never made scalloped corn, so I decided to come to allrecipes for a great recipe.  I didn't go wrong!!  This was the hit of the night  - everyone loved it!  Easy to make too!  Carla you were a life saver.

The recipe didn't say whether to drain the whole kernal corn or not so I only half drained it, which made the dish a little too wet and I had to increase the cooking time.  It still turned out great.  It was kind of like a cornbread but tasted almost exactly like Chi Chi's sweet corn cake.  Next time, I will fully drain the corn and probably make in muffin tins.

Easy to make, and very yummy!  (Although I did mess it up a bit -- but it was 100% my fault).  

My sister in law makes this dish frequently, except she adds shredded cheese to make the dish more casserole-ish.  

When I made this I didn't know it was essentially the same recipe she uses, though!  It turned out really good, although I forgot to add the sour cream!  OOPS!!  Hahaha!  Without the sour cream it came out a bit more like corn bread, but my dinner party guests liked it anyway.

A lot of scalloped corn/corn casserole recipes call for a HALF CUP of butter, including this one. In case anyone is thinking of not doing that, I made this recipe with light sour cream, EggBeaters, no extra sugar, and 2T butter for the flavor. Baked in 11x7 dish til the center was set. Fantastic.  Try it!

We thought this was a little too muffin-y.  We're going to try cutting the muffin mixture in half next time for a more creamy consistency.

I found this recipe several years ago and made if for my partner's family (who are Latino) and you would've thought I was serving them lobster!  They couldn't stop telling me how good it was.  Being from the midwest I just thought it would be something fast and easy to bring to a large family gathering (I doubled the recipe).  Now I don't dare show up without bringing it!

Disappointed with this dish. I was expecting more of a creamy dish, a pudding like consistency. I found the "jiffy" corn muffin mix addition made the dish gritty. Not the scalloped corn dishes I remember. Not one dinner guest liked it nor did I. Never again~

I omit the sugar and add about 1/4 Cup minced onion. You can also substitue the regular canned corn with frozen if you don't have any. Perfect!

Absolutely perfect, as is, and as others have noted, do not drain the corn. I've taken this to BBQ tailgate parties (packaged up hot and tightly covered, then wrapped in towels for insulation) and I just took it to the family Christmas dinner to serve with spiral ham. There isn't a soul who hasn't loved it. So far, due to the large crowds I've served, I've doubled the recipe and just bake it a bit longer. Just keep an eye out for the golden brown color and you're fine!

Great, simple recipe! I've made this several times and am always asked for the recipe. It's become a given at Thanksgiving and Christmas! I do add an additional can of the whole kernel corn (both drained) and 1/2 of the sugar.  Perfect every time!  Thanks for sharing!

I always make this in a crock pot, an it is great! I don't drain the corn, and I add a little chopped green onion, cheddar, black pepper, and chopped bacon. Everyone loves it, even the little kids.

I made this on a lark for a summer dinner with fresh garden veggies and this as the sole hot dish.  I didn't have the corn muffin mix, so I followed the recipe except for making my own mix (using a recipe on this site for a dozen corn muffins - all the dry ingredients, only).  I'm glad I made it and will plan on making it again - it was really yummy!  A great way to use leftover fresh corn, too!

This was delicious! Pretty fattening but very good and so moist. I did not add the sugar it was sweet enough with the creamed corn.. I think next time i will try it with the two cans of regular corn and add skim milk to make it a little healthier and ill also figure out a way to omit the butter.. Definitely recommend

I make this recipe, omitting the sugar, doubling everything but the butter (don't drain the corn), adding some grated or diced onion, and putting in the crockpot on high for abt 4 hrs.  Stir it a couple of times.  Time will depend on the crockpot that you have because some definitely cook hotter than others.  I am not a big fan of this but my kids love it and always request it for holiday get-togethers.  Using the crockpot leaves oven space for other things.

Was expecting a better flavor. It was just OK. I followed the recipe except I used a can of hominy in place of the corn because that's what I had on hand. Perhaps this changed the flavor. Will try it again, no hominy and add some green chilies and grated cheddar cheese.

I have been making this recipe for years and everytime I take it somewhere the recipe is requested.  It is very good as written but sometimes I like to make the Cheesy Scalloped Corn version.  Simply stir in 1 cup of shredded Cheddar just before pouring into prepared dish and then top with other cup of shredded Cheddar.  Increase baking time to 45 minutes.  Good comfort food!

Unbelievable and easy!!! I made this the first time for a group of about 25 people, they all raved over it. One person said it reminded him of a dish his grandma made when he was growing up.  I would describe it as a southern authentic dish. You won't be disappointed.

This is such a delicious recipe, I always make it for holiday any holiday get together. Everybody raves about how good it is. The only thing I do is cut down the butter to a half stick, and you can't even taste the difference. It's a simple, classic and very tasty side dish!

It is a little vague as whether or not to drain the whole corn. I drained it and it came out great! It reminded me of the Sweet Corn Cake served at "El Torito" restaurant in southern California!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious.  My Mom even went back for seconds.  I did reduce the sugar to 1 tablespoon and was plenty in my opinion.  Very easy way to dress up simple canned corn.

It was a nice twist on creamed corn. Everyone who tried it said it was good. Something different for a side.

My 12 year old son made this with little help and it was wonderful with fast prep time which appealed to him.  Do drain the can of whole kernel corn.  We cut the butter to 1/4 cup and used the liquid fat free margarine spray, cut the sugar to 1 tablespoon, and used fat free sour cream to make it a little healthier.  Absolute perfection!  Now he is trying to take over bragging rights for being the resident chef:)

Absolutely delicious! The only change I made was to add half a diced red pepper. I would highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent recipe, and so simple to make.  The only changes I made was to melt my butter.  I also added about 1/2 -3/4 cup of diced green peppers.  I let them cook slowly in the butter until slightly softened. I then added them to my mixture.  This recipe came out beautifully.  My sister said it was better than my grandmother's, and that was truely a compliment.  I will definitely make this for Christmas!

Good basic recipe, but nothing spectacular about it.  Made it according to the recipe, minus the added sugar as many suggested.  Used entire can of creamed corn - didn't drain as some were asking about.  Used full fat sour cream, and a Jiffy corn muffin mix.

This is a delicious side dish to accompany nearly any menu. Delicious but not overly-rich. Particularly good during the holidays as a companion to the casseroles that are typically a part of a holiday menu.

My mom has new dentures and it's not going so well. I have been looking for recipes that are visually appealing, easy to chew and tasty.  This completely met my goals.  She says it is fabulous.  And it's not safe for either of us to be alone in the room with the baking dish full.. it's  a little too good!  :)   We'll be rotating this thru our menus regularly now.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

EXCELLENT add to the usual Thanksgiving dishes.  I kept wanting to call it Soufle, because you can't see the corn until you spoon it out.  It was another winner and I will make this throughout the year. DELICIOUS!

I have made this twice now and loved it both times (left out the sugar), but for some reason the rest of the family doesn't like it.  They eat it, but they'd prefer I not fix it again.  I can't imagine why.... I think it's a good down-home comfort food, and I had no problem finishing the entire pan myself over the weekend.

This is not your typical scalloped corn. I made it for Easter and was very disappointed that it turned out exactly like corn bread. It was great as a corn bread, but don't expect it to be a vegetable dish at all. I wanted good old fashioned scalloped corn like my mother used to make and this was not it.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it wasn't knock my socks of...but it was good.  Grumpy said that it was missing something - so when I do make this again I think I will use mexicorn and maybe add some shredded cheddar cheese as others have suggested.

This is, without any doubt at all, the best scalloped corn recipe I have made or tasted. It was sweet but not overly sweet and was not the same boring scalloped corn you get at a lot of holiday parties. This one was a crowd pleaser.

This was good - but a bit dry.  My husband took one look at it and said "you made cornbread?".  It was totally like eating cornbread for me - but the flavor was good.  I think it just needs a little tweaking to be a "5".

I leave out the sugar and use jiffy mix and it is perfect.  I get lots of requests to make it for potlucks and cookouts.

We Love this dish! And it's so easy! We had this at my sisterlaw's house with a roast beef dish. But I love to serve it with encillatas. It's creamy enough that it's a great side dish!

My family and friends I LOVED this. I used a can of white shoepeg corn instead of yellow and it was yummy. The sour cream adds a different taste, creamy texture and some sweetness. I will omit the sugar next time as a few people suggested but you should try it the first time with it..everyones tastes are different. For anyone who has looked at my reviews before I always reference my father,as he is culinarily gifted and my worst critic...he asked me for this recipe. If that doesnt say alot I dont know what will. Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good, but just didn't taste like the scalloped corn I'm used to. If you like cornbread, you will definately like this recipe. I thought it could use a little more sugar.

It was good, however, it did need to cook longer than the recipe calls for.  I had to cook for approximately 20 additional minutes.  I will definitely have this again.

This was a good recipe, but had to bake it 20 minutes longer than stated in recipe.  Good flavor--the sweetness (I used Jiffy cornbread mix and it is pretty sweet and I did not add any sugar) and texture make this an excellent side dish for a spicy or bold meat such as BBQ or a cajun shred or jerked meat.  We had it with my spiced up smoked pork chops and parmesan asparagus. Yum!

Easy enough to make, but pretty bland...like another reviewer said, it's corn and cornbread. It tasted better as leftovers.

I was looking for an alternative to green bean casserole.  We were getting tired of that old standby.  My dad used to make scalloped corn and I was looking for a recipe similar to what he used to make.  This isn't it, but it is definitely a great dish.  I wanted to write a review, because I thought that this recipe was as good as, if not better than, the kind my dad made.  It will definitely make it back to my table again.

I love this recipe.  Was looking for a new corn sidedish and this was great!  So easy to make and is wonderful with a pork entree.  Might need to stay in oven a little longer than quoted.

Great Thanksgiving side dish!  I did not drain the corn and it was perfect.  Also made same dish but used Mexican Corn instead of the whole corn for a mexican lunch with friends.

Yucky! I didn't like this dish at all. Served it at my christmas party and it was a huge flop. One guest called it "cornbread on acid". It was awful. Will be tossing this one away. Sorry.

I have made this at least a half a dozen times. I follow the recipes exactly and it is one of my families holiday meal favorites. It’s super quick and easy and I need to get around to making it more often, my 5 hr old requested it for his “birthday dinner”.

This is really good, much better than the recipes using crackers.  I did use about half the butter and no sugar, everyone really liked it that way.

I really loved this. I didn’t have enough sour cream so I had to substitute some ricotta and it turned out fine. It was actually a perfect replacement for any type of side bread on Thanksgiving. I was thinking it’d be more soupy but it was firm and easily cut into squares. Takes on the taste of whatever mix you use.

This is one of the best dishes to make.  I really like it and have made it many times.  The only down side is that baking time is longer than stated.  Always check with a clean knife

I modified this recipe. I used three cups fresh sweet corn that I put thru my food processor and added one half cup of Martha White corn meal mix, I also added one half cup of roasted chopped Hatch chili's . bake as directed.
I thought the results were excellent.

This was great. Are used a can of corn with red and green peppers, drained along with the cans of creamed corn. I melted the butter and left it in the microwave by accident I never added that, and it still turned out moist and buttery flavored.

My super picky youngest child loves this dish. My SIL forgot to add the butter one time and it tasted just the same so we have been skipping the butter to make it a smidge but healthier.

I'm not sure what I was expecting when I read the recipe, but it wasn't what I expected. It was actually better. I've made scalloped corn with a cracker layer on top but never with cornbread mix. I wasn't sure how it would go over and most of my family thought it was a corn bread pudding. I'll make it again.

i did cook this a little bit longer, but could be my oven was the issue. I am addicted to this recipe. Maybe b/c there is nothing healthy in it what so ever. This was easy and a crowd favorite.

The whole family loved it! I get requests to make it for every holiday. I use Famous Daves cornbread mix, it is sooo good. It is on the sweet side for sure, reminds me of corn fritters I had growing up :-)

I got in trouble last Thanksgiving when I didn't make this recipe. One of the most raved about things that I make from the young to the old. I make it exactly as it is listed without draining the creamed corn

Add one 7 oz can of diced mild green chiles, drained. Adds a lot of flavor but not hot or spicy.

We love this recipe. I do make us a little bit different though. I do two cans of whole corn and one can of cream corn. I also add salt and pepper and a whole row of crushed saltine crackers.

Excellent recipe.  I followed it as stated except I cut the sugar in half and I substituted an entire 16oz package of frozen corn, thawed, for the can of corn.   It took an additional 10 minutes to cook (60 minutes total), but it was wonderful.  Slightly sweet, lovely custard like texture.  One of the best recipes we have found for this dish.  Thank you so much.  This one goes into our rotation.  May try it with some cheese sprinkled on top next time, but it's great without!

It was a huge hit with my group. I used Jiffy cornbread mix and did not add the sugar and I am so glad I didn't. I did add green chilies to it which really added what I was looking for. I did not drain the corn. I cooked it a little longer than stated. Had guests asking for recipe.

Very good! I always make a double batch using the krusteaz honey corn bread mix and my homegrown creamed sweet corn. Everyone loves it! Even my mother who is picky and doesn't like trying new things asked for the recipe.

My mother use to make this when I was a child. Except she used cracker crumbs on top of the mixture mixed with butter. It made it a nice crunchy crust it was my favorite! So I modified this recipe & took out the corn bread. It was delish!

First time I tried this I had all the ingredients mixed and ready to go with the intention of adding the cornbread mix right before it was time to put it in the oven.  Well, guess I had a little too much wine, so I ended up dumping the mixture into the baking pan without the cornbread mix and cooking it that way.  It still turned out delicious!  Can't wait for a chance to try it again.

This is good.  I made it just as the recipe says. I wasn't sure if the whole kernal corn was supposed to be drained or not, so I guessed and drained most of it. I did not find it too sweet like others who suggested less or no sugar.  I did feel like it was missing salt and pepper though.  With salt and pepper, it would be a 5 star recipe.  Nice consistency, not too dry, not too wet.  I will definitely make it again but add some salt and pepper.

Wonderful addition to that special meal. We added finely chopped onion and green pepper (about 1/2 cup each). My mother has made this for years and she didn't have to wash the dish. Best part is it's so easy to make.

Perfect! I used fresh corn in place of the canned corn, and used canned creamed corn. This is very very moist and soft, not like your typical cornbread. This was exactly what I was looking for! thanks!

This is a decent recipe, but it's definitely a stretch to call it "scalloped corn".  More like a Mexican cornbread. Scalloped implies the use of cheese and/or a white sauce and this recipe has neither.  The flavors were good, although I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream and added minced onion, diced jalapenos and shredded cheddar cheese.

I made this today for dinner as a side dish with the smoked pork loin and it was very good. I used lite sour cream and an extra can of whole kernel corn with the red and green peppers in it, and threw in some cajun spice for a bit of extra flavor. It cooked up quite nicely. I cut the sugar in half, but next time I will take the advice of others here and leave it out completely as it really did not need it.  I guess everyone enjoyed it -- there was none left. :-)

Great recipe, where simple on-hand ingredients entwine to compliment each other: kernel and cream corn, with sour cream and corn muffin / cornbread mix!! Out of ballpark hit, done strictly by recipe directions. Remember to spray that baking pan with PAM!! Here's my modifications on my 2nd run: Generous pinches of all-purpose seasoning, shredded cheese ( blended in the mix )1 and 1/2 tablespoons Smoked Chipolte flavored Tabasco. 45 minutes in 350 degree oven--lightly covering the nicely browned top w/ another generous "pinch" of shredded cheese! My picky family all love this recipe!!

My family loves this recipe.  I usually only make it during the holidays, but make lots of it so there is plenty for leftovers. Now when my son comes home from college I make it all the time. It's too good to only have during the holidays.

Absolutely no changes to this recipe. It's become a new tradition at Thanksgiving instead of just the regular boring corn!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving this year.  I tried it exactly as the recipe stated and it was good, but next time I might make a few changes.  The scalloped corn that my mother used to make wasn't as dry so I might not drain the can of corn next time.  Also it need a little kick so next time I might add a little pepper or some other spice.  Overall though it was a pretty good dish.

This is an amazingly simple and delicious side dish. Very high in calorie, so I'll save it for special occasions.  I may try to cut the butter in half next time and use low fat sour cream.

I subbed yogurt for the sour cream and left out altogether the butter. To the mix, I added half of a large onion (chopped in processor) and black pepper. I skipped adding any sugar. It was very tasty. I enjoyed it very much!I also found it was very soupy and took a LONG time to bake until it wasn't runny inside.

Great recipe as is, so the second time I made it I added lima beans as my father-in-law loves succotash, but I needed to find a way that others would eat it. This was perfect! Thank you Carla for a wonderful recipe, that is extremely easy to adapt for all tastes!

I guess this was ok.  It wouldn't be fair to down grade to a 3 because I didn't like the "texture" of it.  The taste was fine.  I read some of the reviews and I did cut the sugar down to 1 tsp.  And then baked in a 2 qt casserole dish, bake time about 50-55 mins.

I am also making this recipe today.Amy-I would say NOT to cover the dish. I have not made this exact recipe, but I have made ones like it. I'm hoping it's a keeper!

This recipe is in the oven now. However, I'm not an expert cook at all and need to know whether the dish is covered or uncovered during the baking process. It doesn't say in the recipe or any reviews????  I'm not giving many stars yet until it comes out of the oven and is eaten!

Thanks Jessica..I baked uncovered for 50 mins...turned out wonderful!!!

I love the way this casserole turned out. I used 1 can of creamed corn and 1 can of yellow and white corn. I also added about 12 ounces of dry corn muffin mix to give it a more cake-like texture. I will be using this recipe not just on the holidays but year-round!!

I have made this recipe for years, and it is a must for Thanksgiving in my house!  We love it, and we like it even better when I use one can of creamed corn and one can of regular corn (drained).

I followed this recipe exact and although this TASTED awesome,  it never got done enough to serve for dinner.  It was goo inside and brown/nearly burned on the outside after baking longer in an attempt to soak up the sticky gunk.  Next time I will add more Jiffy mix and hope it's texture is more cake-like, rather than pudding.  The taste was FOR SURE worth another try!  Thanks for sharing!  :)

I was very delighted with this recipe.  I did only use 1 tablespoon of sugar as recommended, but I still would have very much liked it with 2.  I plan on making this a regular item on our dinner menu.  Thank you for sharing this recipe Carla.

Awesome! I actually baked it without the butter and had to add it on top after baking, but it still came out great! I used a little less sugar and I think that half of the butter would suffice, I will make these changes next time. I even used light sour cream and it still was great!

Very good, amazes me how the cornbread rises o the top of the mixture and looks like something that would take a lot of time and effort to make.  So easy.  Next time I think I will use another can of corn though, so good you there is not enough!!  Thanks!!

Scalloped corn is a family tradition of mine.  However, we make it without any eggs or butter.  Just as delicious, and healthier!

Great side dish.  I used low fat sour cream.  I do not think you can tell the difference and it helps save some fat and calories since you are using an entire stick of butter!  I think I will make this for Christmas dinner.

I had high hopes for this one after reading all of the great reviews, but I found it to only be 'ok.'  It was one of those dishes that you take a few bites and try to decided if you like it or not.  Not bad, just not great like I was hoping for.  My family decided to add it to the "don't make again" list.  Still looking for just the right corn side dish...

This has been a favorite at family gatherings for years!  We add about 1 or two cups of shredded cheddar cheese on top and it is wonderful!

I served this when we had friends over for dinner.  Children were included ages 17 all the way down to age 2.  EVERYBODY loved this.  Grown ups wanted to recipe.  Even my husband, who isn't crazy about corn, loved it.  We will make this many more times.  (I did add a little shredded cheddar cheese) otherwise we made it as is!  YUM!

This rocks and beats the heck out of regular old corn side dishes. I made this for Thanksgiving this year and everybody wanted the recipe. I will be making again tonight to go with a pot of pinto beans.

This is delicious! It is almost sweet enough to be a desert. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. It is also very easy to make so it can be made for a weeknight dinner or good enough for a holiday meal.

Tastes good but a little too mushy. Perhaps if its cooked longer it will be better. Nonetheless, I'll definatly try it again!

This was easy and quick to make and it turned out delicious. My husband love it. And I was told it was the best corn bread someone tasted. It turns out like a soft corn bread. Sweet and very yummy. Great side dish to bring for holidays or gatherings.

Very good recipe. I've previously only used crackers in scalloped corn, but found that I liked the muffin mix even better.  Took it to a potluck dinner and it was a hit. I will be making this one again!

It was good, but uneventful. I left out the sugar and added 2 tablespoons of jalopeno juice. Everyone loved it then. With the leftovers, I mashed them into little cakes and fried them. That was wonderful with a little cheese on top.

I really liked this recipe, tasted really good. Try the variation I tried though, instead of corn muffin mix, I used oatmeal muffin mix. Still ended up really good!

My 8 & 11 year olds asked for seconds on this one! They like it as a left over cold snack too!  I cooked it just a little longer because we like the top to be brown and with a crispy crust.

I thought it was very good I made it for a special dinner.  My husband asked for creamed corn and this is not what is wanted but I thought it was good the only thing people said that it was to dry and needed more corn.  But I am not sure I agreed

LOVED IT!  Didn't change a thing!  Perfect in place of corn bread for chili, etc.  This baby made it to the front of the recipe box!

I grew up loving my mom's scalloped corn, but this time I thought I would try another recipe. Carla's rendition intrigued me with her use of sour cream. It was so easy to prepare, and turned out great (my cooking time was a bit longer, plus I substituted sugar with Splenda). It is light and fluffy, and my husband and I loved it. I will always use this recipe from now on (sorry Mom!).

This recipe was a HUGE hit with the family on Thanksgiving.  The only thing I can't figure out is why mine baked for almost an hour when the recipe called for 35 to 40 min.  It was still excellent and had many requests for the recipe!

This gets SIX stars! I made this a couple of weeks ago for a family dinner, and it was gone within minutes. The sweetness and texture are perfect. I'm making it again today for Thanksgiving dinner, and I'm sure it will be a staple for years to come. Thank you!

Good but too greasy.  I made half of the recipe in a 9 x 9 inch baking dish.  It took me almost an hour to bake and was too greasy from all of the butter.  I love corn so maybe next time I will cut down on butter by at least half.

I agree with LRGAYLES. It was good, but the texture just wasn't what I had expected. My mom makes this for every holiday, and I wanted to make it for my family since we couldn't go home. Not as good as my mom's. I guess I'll have to ask for her recipe. My son loved it though!!

Hmmmmmm.  Judging from other cooks and the high ratings, I think I did something wrong.  The texture wasn't what I expected although my husband enjoyed it.  I don't think I'll make this again.

This was good, but a little too sweet for me.  I will make this again and leave out the sugar because I think the corn muffin mix and the creamed corn have plenty of sugar in them.

Excellent recipe.  I almost expected it to be too dry given some of the other reviews, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  It was moist and almost like a corn souffle.  I can't wait to make it again.

I don't usually like scalloped corn, but this recipe is great. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone commented how good it was. I wonder if the person who said she was going to throw this one out actually followed the recipe right.
