Pretty tasty. I actually made this in the microwave, rather than on the stove and thought it was a very easy recipe with great results. Additionally, I made it with a couple squares of a chocolate bar rather than baker's chocolate since I didn't have any baker's chocolate on hand. Delicious! Will make again on another chilly day!

I loved this- it was so good!  I used Nestle Chocolatier Extra Dark Chocolate, 2 cups of organic whole milk and 1 cup of organic 1% milk, and real vanilla extract.  This is so much richer, and more flavorful, than regular ol' hot cocoa.  I broke up a small candy cane and put it in the bottom of my mug- dee-LISH- as my daughter would say!!

Wow! I can't imagine drinking instant ever again. I used 1% milk and added a teaspoon of powdered creamer to each cup. Was very rich and creamy.

Not really thick, but rich, for sure. I cut it in half, made a big sized mug just for myself. Used half'n'half. I added a few shakes of cinnamon while the chocolate/water/sugar was at a boil, along with a shake of salt. I think it really brought up the flavor. While sweet, it's not really a chocolatey richness. I may add more chocolate next time, or a bit less sugar. Overall, not bad, and it makes up quick/I had everything in the house. It's worth a shot! And the recipe cuts in half wonderfully. :) Oh, and I omitted the vanilla- totally forgot about it. But it was still tasty.

Great homemade hot chocolate.  I cut down on the vanilla just a little bit and thew a handful of small marshmellows in to melt towards the end.

Very rich.  Very yummy!

This turned out really chalky. Couldn't even finish a mug of it. I didn't change anything, and everyone else loved it, but ew.

Great base for Hot Chocolate! You can try adding things like Bailey's, vodka, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon for a delicious (adult-only) drink! Or as other people mentioned, you create a peppermint style by adding mint schnapps, and garnishing with candy-canes.

Excellent recipe! I changed a couple things: in a serving for 2, I substituted 1/2 cup of the milk for heavy cream, which just made it even creamier, and didn't have baker's chocolate, so I used 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and half the amount of sugar. I also added a peppermint candy cane in my mug. Yum!

i didnt boil it, perhaps i should have, but mixing water and chocolate seemed so weird plus boiling it.... i know if making chocolates you should never get water in chocolate as it will make it gritty... but maybe i'll try boiling it.  Problem was that it was not thick at all.  Tastes great, not gritty... but definitely not thick.

WAY too chalky!  Flavor was good, but it was so gritty, I couldn't finish my cup.  I think you can skip this recipe since it is so-so anyways, and find a much better one on the website.

This was OK - only marginally better than the store-bought powder that is my norm and not quite worth the time and effort. My quest for a good hot chocolate recipe continues...

This was my first time making hot chocolate from scratch and although it was pretty good, it didn't really blow me away. I will probably try a different recipe next time.

delicious.  I made it exactly as described with whole milk.  I didn't whisk it and the chocolate wasn't totally blended, but then I put it in my "hot chocolate pot" and that whipped it right up into a yummy frothy heavenly concoction!  We served with freshly whipped cream and Bailey's and it was very popular

i would recommend making this
with 2% milk maybe 1%. but even if
your a regular skin milk drinker, like me,
the creamyness factor really improves with
the thicker milk. but other wise
yummy!!

Had a hard time getting my chocolate to totally melt. It wasn't near as thick as the pic (that looks like pudding). It was still good, esp. since the weather is cold tonight.

This was okay.  I agree with another reviewer that it ended up being a bit chalky.  Somehow this makes it seem quite a bit like powdered mix hot chocolate.  Also, I think the water takes away from the creaminess.  I really wish it has a more chocolaty flavor- I am getting more vanilla than anything else.  It might be better with less sugar and less vanilla, but I think I'll just try another recipe next time.

I did not enjoy this hot chocolate at all!  I used exactly what the recipe called for, unlike other reviewers, and it was not good!  The taste was very bitter and even after I added half and half, extra sugar, and a little salt, it was still very bitter.  It might be better if it started with something other than the unsweetened chocolate squares, but I won't be giving this recipe a second try!

The wow was when I tasted the mixture of chocolate, water, sugar, and vanilla. I added the vanilla at that time instead of waiting till the end to add it. When I added the milk it wasn't chocolaty enough. I had to double the amount of chocolate I used. Next time I'll make it with more chocolate and of course some cream for part of the milk.   Thank you

We made this at Christmas time and my kids loved it.  It was simple enough that they could help and everyone enjoyed it.  We made it with 1% milk as that it what we drink.  It was excellent!

This recipe is excellent on its own! I didn't have any vanilla so I left that out. My husband loves peanut butter so I added a tablespoon of that. It turned out amazing! I also used semi-sweet chocolate instead of unsweet.

Delicious!  I used 85% dark Lindt chocolate and cut the sugar in half.  I also only had skim milk, but compared to powdered mixes combined with water, this stuff was spectacular!  If I had a candy cane to stir it with, it would be perfect.

Great tasting recipe. We halved the recipe to make two servings, substituted 3 TBSP of cocoa and 1 TBSP of butter for the 1 oz of bakers chocolate, melted the butter first and then added the water etc, doubled the vanilla and added 2 TBSP of Torani hazelnut syrup. Yum!! Would probably also be great with some espresso mixed in, but that idea is for another day!

I love this recipe! I was feeling creative and used maple extract instead of vanilla and, OMG, it was fantastic!! Perfect addition to a breezy evening and a good book.

Very good!  My husband and I loved it...our kids...not so much.  I think it was a bit rich for them.  Would be great with whipping cream on top!

This was good. Just maybe a little too rich for my taste but good. My kids really liked this.

I love this recipe. It is pretty rich so I usually add a little more milk. It's also terrific with a little malibu rum. enjoyable!

I've made this twice & really enjoyed it both times. The first time I made it I used bittersweet chocolate and a bit less than 1/2 cup Splenda. I used 2% milk, and served it Christmas morning in tiny cups, topped with a dollop of whipped cream. It was very, very rich. The next day I tried a half batch with skim milk, which I enjoyed much more. Without being so rich I could actually drink a full mug of it. Anyhow, this is my go-to recipe for delicious indulgence in a mug!

Made with semi-sweet chocolate squares and skim milk.  Very yummy, just what I was looking for.  Served with a peppermint candy and whipped cream for a mint-mocha treat!  Thanks!

this was good but really rich and if you follow the directions exactly, it takes quite a long time to make. I personally love chocolate in all degrees so i thought it tasted great, but i think most people would agree that this was a little too chocolatey. theres some other really great hot chocolate recipes on this website that only take 10 minutes to whip up!

Thought it was a bit rich with the bakers
squares. It just tasted "thick", too thick.

Fantastic!  Add peppermint schnapps, a mini candy cane and a dollop of homemade whipped cream to every mug, and you have the perfect cold weather party drink.
