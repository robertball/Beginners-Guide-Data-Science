This is my personal recipe. Note:  Allrecipes misprinted my directions.  Here is the correction:  Place rinsed and patted dry turkey drumsticks ON A RACK.   Do not put turkey directly into the broth or the flavor will be diluted.  (I use Butterball turkey legs).

Just prepared these for myself & roommates.  Added other herbs & spices to the brine.  Had no broth, so added herbed water in the bottom of a broiler pan, with turkey drumsticks on the slatted top of the pan.  It was really delicious, and very moist.  Into Recipe Box it goes.  Served with herbed wild rice with onion and bell pepper.  Thank you!

Other than having to take out of the oven in half the time directed, I did everything this recipe said to do but the end result was inedible.  Rubber.  I took a suggestion of putting the drumsticks on a rack rather than directly into the broth but even then the meat was boiled-like and not tasty at all.  Wasn't a fan, sorry.

perfect!. I use this recipe all the time. Parents get tired of chicken. My mother is in renal failure so I can not brine the legs, but the rest i follow just like it's written.

We didn’t put it into a brine - don’t want the sodium because of kidney failure. We sprayed  the pan with cooking spray and then used canola oil instead of butter - healthier fats. Since we used 4 drumsticks, we put in 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth. We cooked it in an electric fry pan at 375 F and it worked beautifully. It was done (170 F) in about 1 to 1-1/4 hours. During the last 15 minutes, I added one can of light mushroom soup and it just made the broth a little creamier and a fantastic gravy. This is will be our go to recipe from now on.

I checked at 1 1/2 hour mark ... they were already 185 degrees.  They looked kinda anemic ... but really tasted great.

Very good and simple to make.  Would cover with foil next time at least during the last 1/2 hour.  Watch carefully as mine went from still pink juices to a little dried out very quickly.

I thought this was pretty delicious! I did add some other herbs & spices besides just pepper. I also used the rack to elevate them over the broth...they only took 1hr @ 375. really yummy and easy to make! Loved it!
