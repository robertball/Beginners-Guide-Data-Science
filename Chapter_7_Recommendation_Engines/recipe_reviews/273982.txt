Very good traditional Cuban recipe.  I would suggest cutting the peppers a little more fine so they do not over power the beans but other than that pretty good.

Absolutely fabulous... Best black bean concoction we've done (and we've done several)! Only slight variation: had no bell pepper so used chopped celery & was heavy-handed with cumin. Additionally, I did not soak my beans but adhered to the stove recommendation for initial softening followed to the Crock-Pot.

This was super simple and turned out pretty good. I added more cumin than the recipe called for and am glad I did. It needed the extra flavor. Overall good recipe and one you can change up to suit your tastes.
