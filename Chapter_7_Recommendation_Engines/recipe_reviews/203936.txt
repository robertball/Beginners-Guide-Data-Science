These are very good. I like them better than cranberry nut bread. I cut the frozen cranberries in half and did add a few extra berries. The next time I will add extra nuts also.

Although this recipe tastes quite delicious I'm only rating it a 4, because the finished product is not a  "bar" recipe. I followed the recipe exact and it is more of a coffee cake. Still good and delicious, the walnuts go so well with the cranberries but I was hoping for more of a cookie-like bar. Also the finished product doesn't look like the picture. The picture shows nice clean sides, not crumbly like a cake would be but firmer like a cookie. Again, this is not what I ended up with. This recipe should be renamed to "cranberry nut coffee cake".

I doubled the receipe and made them in a 9 x 13 pan.  I cooked them the same as the receipe said and they turned out wonderful.  Very easy with few ingredients.

These were very good. I was surprised considering the limited ingredients. I only used half the cranberries, as another reviewer suggested, but the full amount would have been perfect.  My bars looked exactly liked the photo.

light and fluffy! Perfect for any event. Suggestion: cut the cranberries in half. A full cranberry can give too much of a sour taste in the mouth.

Nice recipe to use up leftover cranberries from Thanksgiving. I like that it has few ingredients. I turned out really well and it reminds me of a strawberry shortcake.

I cut the butter to 2 Tbs. and added 3 Tbs. of applesauce and they came out great.  I do agree that they are more of a coffee cake than a bar but they were still very yummy.

These are so simple and easy that I was not expecting them to be anything more than "good" and they were SO good.  I made them for a girls night and me and my girlfreind at 2 rows.  We could not stop eating them.   These are a new staple in my house!

These taste delicious.  Texture of mine was a little crumbly but still moist inside with flaky crispness on top.  I used whole wheat flour and substituted 1/4 cup of brown sugar for white because I ran out.

Super tasty and a really fantastic way to use the frozen cranberries I had leftover from Thanksgiving. I liked that the recipe was so simple. I didn't have any walnuts, so I used a handful of chocolate chips instead, and it was a nice combo between the sour berries and the sweet chocolate. I agree with other reviewers that it's much more bread-y than bar-y.

Turned out great. Mine came out like bars, not cake like. I cut the sugar in half though. Used preserved cranberries, from oceanspray.

Wish I could give this 4-1/2 stars!  So simple to make and makes a tasty bar.  Hubby thought it tasted buttery, which he liked (frankly, I did not notice that in particular).  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that although it is very good, it isn't anything to write home about.

These are really good. My daughter does not really like cranberries, but I caught her sneaking slivers off and on during the day and when she got home from work. I am just as guilty. They definately are more cakey, but delish. I added a drizzle of glaze on top with just powdered sugar, vanilla and milk. Gives it just a little sweetness to cut the tart cranberries. Doubled the recipe and am going to make some for Christmas sweet table. Hope they freeze well, otherwise they won't make it till Christmas. I also cut the cranberries in 1/2. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

My kind of Bars, 5 indgredients or 1 more.  I will try this recipe next, and can predict it will be excellent.  My first year to do anything with cranberries other than cranberry relish.  Such a healthy food.

The first time I made these they did not bake in the middle.  The next time I made them I beat the eggs for three to four minutes (like you do for a pumpkin roll) then added the sugar slowly and they came out perfect.  Most people I serve these to the first time request the recipe.  I and my family think they are very good.

These were pretty good but there were way too many walnuts. The texture was just too crunchy, I would have preferred something softer. I checked mine after 35 minutes and they were almost overdone.

So quick and easy.  Few ingredients.  Just the way I like to bake.  I changed slightly based on what I had on hand, but I am sure it was a 5 as written.  I used pecans, I used dried cranberries and I added some lemon zest.  I wanted orange zest but the lemon was already started. Thanks for a great recipe!

Love these!!!  I make them every year around Christmas time.  I add chocolate chips to mine.
