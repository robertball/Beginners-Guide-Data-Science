Excellent recipe! Tried it this evening. I prepared the beef last night (I bought & cubed 2 pieces of London Broil) & let it marinade in beef broth, garlic, seasoned salt, pepper and a decent merlot overnight because I knew I wouldn't be making this until today.)  The only variation was I tweaked other member suggestions and added 2/3 cup beef broth and 1/3 cup water to cream of mushroom soup, added additional mushrooms and 1 cup of light cream.  After simmering for 15 minutes, I added 1 cup sour cream (not fat free), dash of worstershire sauce, dash of nutmeg and parsley flakes.  AWESOME results...not thick at all, very rich and creamy and totally delicious. Kinda fattening with this variation but so what...you can work it off in the gym tomorrow which is what I will do!!! Will definitely prepare again!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the advice of one reviewer and marinated the sirloin steak.  I cut about 1.3 lbs. into strips and marinated it for about 4 hours in 1/3 cup soy sauce, 2/3 cup white wine, 3 cloves garlic (I used the already diced, bottled garlic), and some ground ginger.  This made the meat very tender and it had an absolutely wonderful flavor!  I then browned the meat in a little oil, and added the onion and 8 oz. sliced fresh mushrooms. (The mushrooms really made this dish; I don't know how you could have stroganoff without fresh mushrooms!)  After I added the flour and spices, I poured in the can of soup mixed with a can of milk.  (I still thought it needed some thinning, so I made the mistake of adding white wine to the sauce.  It would have been great with a little, but I added too much, and my husband complained that it was "too winey". Beware.)  I didn't measure the sour cream; just spooned it in until it looked right.  Served over egg noodles, this was delicious!

Several people reviewing this recipe on this website said it was bland, so instead of using chopped onion, I used one envelope of Lipton Recipe Secrets Beefy Onion dried soup mix, added 1/2 cup of milk to thin the stroganoff out, 1 can of mushrooms, drained, and used 1/2 cup each of fat free sour cream, and regular sour cream. It was very, very good. Not bland at all. I did make the mistake of using cut of beef for stew, instead of hamburger, and the meat was tough. Next time I will use hamburger, or try slow cooking this before adding the noodles.

I browned the meat and onions in a skillet, then transfered to my slow cooker. The flour wasn't necessary and no need for the salt due the the sodium already in the soup. One can of soup was not going to cut it and this dish cried out for more liquid. I used three cans of Golden Mushroom soup and low sodium beef broth. I added garlic and onion powders and sauteed fresh mushrooms which I added during the last thirty minutes of cooking.

This was a very tasty dish, however, I did modify the recipe some.  I sliced and sauteed fresh mushrooms with the onions before I added to the meat.  Also I added some white wine so the stroganoff wouldn't be quite so thick.  Very enjoyable, and I would definitely make this again.

Great recipe! If you don't have steak strips in the freezer, ground beef works just as good! I sauteed lots of minced garlic in the pan before I added the ground beef-just to give it more flavor. The cream of mushroom soup makes it fabulous! I also added some milk to make it the consistency I wanted. Thanks for the recipe-my family loved it!

Good, but needs a kick  like garlic, woschestshire sauce or something along those lines. I also added peas, which ups the nutrition and sneaks in some veggies, for those of you with kids. Good base recipe to work off of.

This was good.  I don't generally care for stroganoff made with cream of mushroom soup, it looks anemic and has no flavor.  The paprika helped with the anemic color.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of red wine to help with the flavor and some milk to thin out the sauce a little.  These helped a lot and while not as good as stroganoff made with stock it was good and fast.

I found this recipe to be very bland and flavorless.  The consistency was like beef stroganoff, but the recipe had no flavor or color.

I didn’t have time for the crock-pot version. This was quick, simple and delicious. I basically followed the recipe, the only things I added was, I sautéed a can of mushrooms along with some onions and garlic.  I add a can of beef broth and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the soup.  Then I added 2 Tblsp of cream cheese along with the sour cream before serving.  This was good.  Daughter love it and Hubby asked me to make this again!!!   Thanks for the recipe!

add fresh mushrooms that are sauteed in wine and butter for the wine flavor.  Instead of adding flour later on, coat the round steak strips in flour and seasonings then brown.  Sour cream makes the dish

Recipe is quick and easy. I am a caterer, work really late sometimes and cannot think about dinner, go figure. LOL. I always use this website to help me jumpstart my brain. I used left over sirloin roast that we had cooked a few days ago, already seasoned so i only added 1/4 tsp salt, no pepper. But added Crimini mushrooms! And you might want to add about a half a can of water when adding soup, too thick, without. Awesome!!!

This is THE best stroganoff recipe ever! I have tried many, looking to re-create the flavour of my Mom's Stroganoff, but with healthier ingredients. This recipe is PERFECT; however, look for organic cream of mushroom soup as all the usuals (campbells, etc) have MSG.     PS the paprika is an AWESOME addition! love it!

Having never had beef stroganoff before, I really can't say how this recipe compares to the "real" thing, but we liked it a lot. I tend to like dishes that start with canned cream of mushroom, though - if you don't, this recipe wouldn't be for you. I made a few small modifications: I combined the flour with the spices, added garlic powder and onion powder to it, then tossed the beef strips with the flour mixture, then browned it. I also added the onion to the skillet first, not on purpose, that's just what I did - not sure if it made any difference. While the beef was browning, I doused it in a splash of worcestershire. After adding the soup and letting it cook and simmer a few minutes, I then added some beef broth - maybe 1/3-1/2 cup, and let it simmer more. I used not nearly as much sour cream as indicated - probably about 2/3 cup. It was inhaled by all!

Easy and amazing!!! My husband LOVES anything with noodles, I get so tired of spaghetti. This was a perfect solution. Added garlic, cream cheese, milk. Left out flour. Substituted ground beef for steak. Added a little red wine. Didn't measure anything, just mixed and stir till it looks perfect. Definitely a favorite. :)

Very good recipe.  I find the sauce is very thick but I like how the can of mushroom soup neutralizes the sourness of the sour cream.  If you like a lot of sauce like we do, it might be a good idea to double up. We ran out and still had noodles left and people wanted more.

I love this recipe and my friends ask me to make it for them all the time. I use venison steaks or chops instead of beef and it still is amazing. I also add beef broth as well not too much because then it becomes too salty.

This is now my go-to pasta recipe. I made a few changes such as leaving out the onions, pepper, and paprika, and adding Lawry's when cooking the steak. this recipe is SO good, even reheated. definitely one of the best I've found on here.

We really liked this. I added 1/3 cup beef broth and 2/3 cups water when I added the soup, without it I think it would be way too thick but with it was really good.

Came out great. I however did also have to alter the recipe. After cooking the beef and onions I deglazed the pot with a bit of water (would have used red wine if I had it) and then added the flour and spices. I used a can of Campbells Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic soup instead and also added about 2 cups more of water (I didnt' want to use milk, felt like there was enough dairy) and added some Worschestershire sauce. Let that cook down and only added 3 big dollups of sour cream. Came out wonderful. Great color too - the garlic soup has some extra color and flavor to it. I also kept adding more paprika, but I love paprika!

I rated this 5 stars if you add the following that I've collected from other reviews.  First off I browned a 3 lb. london broil in a skillet then transfered it to a  crockpot with some garlic, woschestshire sauce, beef broth, fresh ground pepper, paprika,a can of drained mushrooms and a packet of onion soup mix.  Cooked it on low for about 8 hours.  Then when I got home in the evening I dumped it back in a skillet to mix in a can of cream of mushroom soup, and cooked about 10 minutes.  Then I spooned in enough sour cream to the color I like it and simmered for a bit longer.  While I was putting in the mushroom soup I started boiling my water for my egg noodles.  Very tasty and easy to make!!

I liked this recipe...The meat I used was a little tough and that turned me off a little bit but that is my fault, It had nothing to do with the recipe...I just didnt buy the best meat. I read the reviews before making this and saw that people thought it was a little thick..So I did not add the flour and I added about 3/4 of a cup of milk to think it out some. I thought it turned out great other then my meat issue. My husband said it would be awesome with some peas and mushrooms in it next time..So I will have to try that!

I used stew beef for this and simmered it in a cup of beef broth to make it more tender.  I took out the beef and kept the juice to thin the sauce.  I also added sour cream little by little to taste.  Turned out excellent, good comfort food would make again.

Like others I thought this was way too thick as written.  A little (1/2 c. ) beef broth, 1/2 c water, and it was much better.  I also reduced the sour cream to 2/3 c.  Overall, the flavor was what expects from stroganoff. GReat with noodles.

AFTER I MARINATED THE STEAK FOR 3 HRS. IN 1/3 CUP SOY SAUCE, 2/3 CUP OF WHITE WINE, 3 CRUSHED GARLIC CLOVES, 1 TBLS SESAME OIL AND SOME CHOPPED GINGER - THE MEAT WAS VERY FLAVOURFUL.. THIS TURNED OUT TO BE GREAT RECIPE. I ALSO ADDED 3 TBLS OF POWDERED BEEF BROTH AND 1 CAN OF MUSHRO0MS PLUS THE LIQUID.  MY FAMILY LOVED IT.

As advised, I halved the sour cream.  The taste was very good - although the sauce was a bit thick.  Next time I will probably add a bit more liquid (wine, milk, broth etc.) just to thin it out a bit.
A very tasty easy and quick meal!

This was a great recipe! I used only 3/4 cup of the Sour Cream, and I thought the flavor was *perfect*. I was trying to save time and used pre-cut stewing tips - I don't recommend this. They are just way too chewy. But that's not the recipe's fault. IT was a wonderful recipe.

I doubled the recipe and I made the beef in the slow cooker w/ paprika, salt, pepper, dill and a bit of water--then added the mushroom soup, sour cream to taste, more paprika, nutmeg and a little sugar on the stovetop.  It came out great and even my two little nieces had second helpings!!  Will definitely make this again!

I make this recipe quite often.  It works very well if you buy the ultra thin sliced beef.  I always use much less sour cream and add milk, as the other reviews suggest, and I usually add a shot of Worchestshire.

Very good!  I followed everyone else's advice and used less sour cream--but it was STILL too much!!  Next Time I will use even less.  It was rather thick, and milk had to be added.  I also tweaked the recipe and put in a shot of Lea & Perrins.  Husband loved it!!

To solve the thickness problem, I added the cream of mushroom soup and one can of 2% milk too. I reduced the sour cream to 3/4 cup and this did the trick. The consistency was perfect and this is a definite winner!

This recipe is awesome! You can tweak it to your tastes too or improvise. I used leftover eye of the round roast and added garlic powder. I am going to add Worcestershire sauce and fresh mushrooms next time too! My husband and I loved it!

This turned out very good. I made only a few very small changes. 1) I added a tiny amount of butter in the corner of the pan before adding the flour, allowing the flour to cook in the butter before getting mixed with everything else 2) I added some milk after adding the soup concentrate because I felt it was too think (and I stand by that after trying it) 3) I let it simmer much longer than 15 min to help the beef flavor soak into the sauce. Other reviewers thought it tasted bland. I don't think so, although some red cooking wine would probably throw it over the top. I'm also very generous on onion size and I think that makes a difference. The more onion the better the flavor!

My family loved this dish, even my picky meat eater.  I do not particularly like sirloin steak, so I used two new york strip steaks, which were easy to cut thin strips.  I cut the sour cream down to 1/2 cup, and added small amounts of milk until it thinned up a little.  Otherwise it was too thick for noodles, as one other reviewer wrote.  I added a good amount of garlic to add some flavor which saved the meal from blandness.  Next time I will add baby bello mushrooms and maybe even a little tomato paste.  YUM.  Thanks for the recipe.  Easy, and my kids love it.  Definate keeper!

Even half a minced onion was too overpowering for my taste.
I added water, additional shakes of paprika, 2 splashes of apple cider vinegar, and 3 shakes Worcestershire sauce.  Husband raved!  Will make again.

left out salt and flour, added 1/2 a cab if beef broth to the cream of mushroom soup and a splash or red cooking wine.  Cut the sour cream down to 3/4 cup. Still blah.  Probably won't make again.

I made this tonight for the first time. I had 1.5 lbs of steak, so I doubled everything except the sour cream and the onion. I used only one onion and 16 oz. of sour cream. Even so, the sour cream flavor was way strong. I think half the sour cream next time and it will be perfect.

Very good.  I used stew meat, added the beefy onion soup mix, and a bit more liquid,  Then baked to make sure the meat was nice and tender.

I used sirloin steak, added jalopeno pepper flakes to give it a kick.  Will make again! Thanks for the great recipe.

Easily a 5 star with these healthy modifications. 1. Use the 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup (I promise you won't be able to tell the difference). 2. Add 1 can of Golden Mushroom soup. 3. Add 2 cups or 1 can of beef broth. 4. Add a package of onion soup mix and omit chopped onion. Can also add 1/2 cup light cream cheese and 1/2 cup light sour cream at the end. This dish is far from bland, has a deep rich color to it, and lots of aroma and flavor with hardly any work.

Followed directions exactly.  Found the sour cream overwhelming.  Unusually thick too.  Easy to make. Won't be making again.

This was a good recipe.  I did change it up a little.  I marinated the steak in red cooking wine, salt, pepper, a little lemon juice and chopped onion.  I then sauteed it all in a little butter.  I then did the rest of the recipe as follows except I did add a little milk to thin it down some.  Good though.

I used a little beef stock with minced garlic and onion while browning the meat and added 1/2 cup milk with the soup and a few dashes of worcechestire sauce and it was the perfect consistancy!! Best dish Ive made in a while!

This is almost the same recipe my mom taught me to make, except I don't use flour and I add green pepper and mushrooms. If you add a little water and let the meat simmer it makes a beef broth and then add the soup it is not as thick. Also, this works well in a crock pot but only add the soup no milk or water, it becomes very thin. Add sour cream 5 min. before seving.

Made this once before exactly as recipe described (except I didn't drain the meat because the onions need something to sautee in & I added garlic & a little milk)and it was very good except the meat was not as tender as we would have liked. Made again today....I was out of cream of mushroom so used cream of chicken and let it simmer very low for 30 minutes and it was awesome and cut with a fork tender. So I guess if you simmer just a few minutes longer , you will get the desired tenderness that many have complained about in their reviews. Awesome, easy recipe. Thanks for sharing it!!

I was in a rush to get dinner on the table, and I had a 20 ounce package of Tyson(R) fully cooked, seasoned beef strips in the fridge, so that's what I used.  It was perfect!  By the time the noodles were cooked, the meat and sauce were ready!  My family ate every morsel.

Very easy recipe! Like others, it seemed as if it would be too thick for my liking so I also used beef broth and some half and half cream at the end, reducing the amount of sour cream. I also added more fresh pepper.
Wine would have given this recipe a better kick overall but I didn't have any on hand!
Overall, a good, easy and quick recipe!

Awesome recipe! I added a can of sliced mushrooms and I halfed the sour cream. I used semi-condensed mushroom soup. Great creamy taste.

It smelled really good when I was cooking it but once I added all of that sour cream-it just sort of tasted and smelled like sour cream.  Next time I'll just put half of that amount in and maybe it will taste different.

I had to really doctor this.  If I were to do it over again I would completly ommit the salt and the flour.  It was so salty with the soup and the added salt that my lips were chapped after I ate it.  It was also thick enough without the flour.  very easy and quick.

I made this for my husband who hates when I try new recipes, and he loved it! He has even requested this on several different occasions.  I make it using ground beef, and as others have suggested, I add some milk.  The first time I made it, though, I followed the recipe (using ground beef) to the letter and everyone loved it!

This was very good!  I cheat and make my stroganoff with ground beef for a cheap, quick meal.
The only thing I did differently was add some garlic and some worcestershire sauce and serve it over rotini instead of egg noodles.  Great, easy recipe!

This was great, having a large family I had to double recipe. I was worried because I had never made stroganoff homemade before. It turned out so good, I did add more paprika then called for and some garlic powder, a little bit of fresh Basil, and left out the salt. Nice!

I think this recipe calls for too much sour cream, it over powers the beef flavor, and I only added one cup. I added some beef broth but still was just tasting the sour cream.

I made this recipe for 15 servings for a Lodge dinner, and it turned out absolutely amazing.  Used a few different spices to give it my own curve, including garam masala on the meat, which was browned with minced garlic beforehand.  No problems with too thick or too thin.  Mixed noodles in to make one big pot and it was all gone, with only about 12 people eating!

We thought this was excellent!  We did as others suggested and added fresh sliced mushrooms.  I didnt use the flour and used 2 cans on cream of mushroom and 4 oz of sour cream then added a little bit of white cooking wine.  I already have people asking for the recipe!

Super-duper easy and a crowd pleaser.  I didn't have steak but used ground beef instead.  My 4-year old son ate two servings!    This is a very, very good recipe.

This is a VERY good basic creamy stroganoff recipe! I didnt have all the ingredients (no onion or paprika) but added fresh mushrooms and garlic to saute the meat in. And it turned out AMAZING! First time ever making something like this and I love it, oh and we used Venison instead of beef.

I loved this recipe, as well did my finance. I just added a cup of sliced mushrooms when I added the onions because my family loves mushrooms. Delicious and easy. Will make again.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  It was good but didn't have quite the "homemade" flavor I would have liked.  I don't think I liked the cream of mushroom soup taste.

This was delicious! I added a splash of white wine, garlic pwder, extra paprika and a bit of worchestshire to the meat as it cooked. When I added the soup, I used one can of NON-condensed mushroom soup, and added a half can of beef broth. I also added about a tsp and a half of dijon mustard. It was sooo good, even my husband loved it!

This is really good!  I made a few changes just for personal preference; I think the original recipe is 5 stars on its own. I like to sautee some garlic in the beginning to add some nice flavor and I usually use onion powder instead of chopped onion for the sake of my ultra sensitive eyes. I like to thin the sauce just a bit with some skim milk, just for personal texture preference.  It's fantastic with the steak and you can also use ground beef if that's what's in the fridge. Both taste excellent.

I made this recipe according to the directions minus the onion and paprika. (I couldn't find the paprika) I also used cubed stew steak.  The steak was really tender and this recipe was really easy and ready in less than 45 min.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

I rated this five stars because it was such a good idea to use mushroom soup in place of mushrooms. I never think to keep mushrooms on hand, so that substitution made this recipe so easy. I used eight ounces of sour cream. I also used ground beef rather than the beef strips, and it was really good. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a pretty good recipe, but we found it had too much sour cream.  I will make this again, but will probably only use 1/2 the sour cream.  Also, I added about 1.5 cups of fresh mushrooms, and fried them with the onions.  I thought this was a really good addition.

Very good - I tried this recipe following the instructions.  I read several people's suggestion about the beef broth but didn't have that on hand.  Instead I added a can of beef gravy with the mushroom soup and about a cup of water.  I also added sliced mushrooms.  It came out great, was easy and I'll definitely make it again!

One thing to consider: slow cook the meat = let the flavors meld (and onions cook).  I've made this recipe several times.  Sometimes I quick fry the meat,  most times not.  I add the soups, meat, onions and mushrooms to the crookpot and cook on low for a few hours.  NOTE: if you quick fry with the flour - you will need a 1/2c beef broth or water also added to the crookpot b/c the flour on the meat will thicken even faster.  A few hours later - while I'm boiling water for the noodles - I add the "full flavored" sour cream.  We like this recipe - method may differ but the ingrediants are the same.

This was ok. The sauce was a little thick and I took the advice of others to season the meat. But as I write this, my husband is telling me that he enjoyed it and we did a good job making due with the ingredients we have here in China

i used to make this recipe the same except i added a little bit of ketchup to it. I didn't ever measure things though, and still don't. I always had a problem with it getting too thick. One way to reduce this is add water and let it sit in the meat and simmer for a while. this makes a somewhat flavorful broth. then i add all the stuff, plus ketchup, pepper, garlic and whoistashire sauce. it's soooo good. i'm actually having it for lunch today. such a good recipe, but when u don't measure it gets too think, so i add water. but soo good just how it is too.

I tried this recipe this evening and didn't have any sour cream so I used cream cheese. It really tasted good! The difference was that it just had a little sweeter taste than with sour cream, but it still tasted great!!!!!!!!!!!

Easy to make!  I thought it was a little thick, so I had to add about 1/2 - 3/4 cup of milk.  But, the two out of my three kids gobbled it up!!  Hubby liked it too and said I could make it again.  So, thumbs up.

This was the best I have ever made.  I did not use onion.  Instead I sliced up 4 gloves of garlic (it is not over powering or hot) and put them in with the cooking meat.  I LOVE GARLIC.  I also followed the others and added milk, but did not measure mine, just to what looked good.  I did not use fat free sour cream, if you are going to eat good food, EAT GOOD FOOD!  There is just something about fat free!  Like said, go to the gym the next day and work extra hard.  I also did a couple splashes of worchestershire sauce.  TASTY!

This was very good; just like my mom used to make!  Would have given it 5 stars, but for one change:  must add almost a can of milk or the sauce is way too thick.  I caught it, and it turned out great.

Very thick & dry, so this time I added 3/4 cup water after the flour mixture.  I let this simmer with some beef bouillon granules &  little Worcestershire.  Added a can of mushrooms and still a bit more liquid (3/4 to 1 cup 1% milk)as we like it creamy.  Omitted the sour cream and it was heavenly!  4 stars for a good basic start!

This recipe looked like it would probably be pretty thick, so I added about a cup of chicken (all I had) broth with the mushroom soup.  I also used ground beef (browned and drained) instead of sirloin(cheaper).  I cut the sour cream back to about a cup (again, all I had) and added garlic powder.  I thought it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this recipe.  Had a really nice flavor, but was too thick.  I barely got it to coat the meat. When I make this again, I will do as another reviewer suggested and add water and beef broth.  Overall, very nice and I will serve it to my family again.  Thanx for this recipe.

I'll give this recipe a SOLID 4. EASY, cheap, easy clean up, and pretty tasty! Tasty enough to go into my personal recipe box! I will make it again. Maybe add 1/4 cup of red wine after browning the meat!

I am most picky when it comes to creamy and flavorful This recipes was good although it was to much sour cream and I will go for the fat next time I used the no fat sour cream and it was simply bland though good idea Id use the fat next time

This recipe was alright, but there were a few things missing, I think. I added the soup before I added the dry ingredients to the skillet. I also threw in a can of mushrooms and a touch of water at this time. It turned out ok (my boyfriend LOVED it), but I thought it needed more. Next time I will add more salt and pepper and some chives!!

I thought I'd be slick & purchase stew beef at a much cheaper price for my meat. It was ok, but kind of tough. Everything else was great. My family loved it - it was a real treat for us. And so easy to make! I'll be making this often now.

I too followed the advice of other's and marinated the sirloin steak.  Well worth the time to wait, it added good flavor.  I also used fresh mushrooms instead of using the canned ones.  I will continue to make this often.

Followed suggestion of using less sour cream and adding milk. I also added fresh mushrooms to the sauce. This dish is very good.

This is a good recipe but I agree with the other reviewers.  There is no need to add the salt and the flour is probably not necessary either.  I added the flour but then I had to add some water to thin it up.  Additionally, I added some red wine and that seemed to help the flavor and consistency.  All in all a tasty and easy recipe.  I will make it again.

Great recipe!  Instead of fresh onions I used onion powder.  I also used stew meat and chopped it into smaller, more bite size pieces.  Quick and easy, I'm going to make this recipe again!

This recipe was quick, easy, and delicious!  I will definitely make it again!!  I used about 1 1/2 pounds of beef and next time will double everything except the meat so I have more sauce.  I also added beef boullion granules to taste before adding sour cream and it added a nice beefy flavor.  Very tasty!!

This is the 3rd beef stroganoff recipe I've tried in the past two month's, and I think I hit the jackpot.  The texture and taste is just the way I wanted it to be.  I will be fixing this at least once every week!

I've been making this for years. I have kids that don't like mushrooms so I add Lipton secrets mushroom-onion and a jar of mushroom gravy. It always taste better day after cuz it sits. So try to make early and cool it then warm for dinner.

This was good, even though I used healthier versions of the unhealthy ingredients. It needs mushrooms but tastes good without too.

AWESOME !!!!! Edit the ingredients a little but otherwise followed the directions! 

My ingredients:
Ground beef
Seasonings listed& garlic
Cream of mushroom soup 
Beef broth ( filled with can of cream soup)
BIG squirt of sour cream
1 pack of cream cheese
Worcestershire sauce 
Penne pasta! 

My family doesn't really like mushrooms  so I didn’t add those. There was no need for flour. It was the perfect consistency!

I made this as the recipe was written, except I added some mushrooms. It was good, but I think if I make this again, I would not use the soup and I would still add the mushrooms.

I have made this recipe a few times now and it’s pretty good, however I do make a different variation each time just to try new things. Last time I used a little sour cream and a little cream cheese. This time I used half the sour cream and omitted onions. Next time I plan on adding fresh mushrooms. Sometimes I add beef stock if I think it’s too bland. But I love the simplicity of this dish... I almost always have the ingredients on hand.

The seasoning for the meat in this is really tasty. I made this with a few additions/changes and the taste was outstanding. I marinated the meat for 2 hours beforehand with a little diced onion, some chili powder, Worcestershire sauce and oil.  Then, I added a little chili powder to the meat seasoning and a splash of red wine when I was cooking. For the sauce, I added an addition can of soup (cream of chicken) and one block of Philly cream cheese. I also put in lots of sliced, fresh, white mushrooms. Family loved it. ^_^

I have used this recipe four or five times and loved it. My wife used this  recipe for beef stroganoff and used cream cheese instead of sour cream. It was not what I expected, but wasn't bad. I am switching to a different recipe. A happy wife makes a happy life.

OMGFD!! I made it tonight it was fast and easy and I'll be lucky if I will have any leftovers. I used green onions, I added  crimini and white button mushrooms and I also used marscapone cream cheese with a little milk because I forgot the sour cream I went one extra step and made homemade noodles delish

Not impressed, sauce was like brick mortar, bland not much flavor, added garlic and Worcestershire sauce just to give it a bit of flavor, added milk to make it a little saucier. All in all it was edible and will make a turd that's about it.

I used some leftover steak instead of starting from raw meat, so that is definitely an option as it worked out just fine. Added a bit of olive oil to the pan to reheat the steak strips with then proceeded with the rest of the instructions. Upon adding the soup I felt it was a bit thick so I added some white wine to thin it out. Even our picky eater liked it!!! Will make this again!

It's by far not the best, it's just ok.  I'll give it 2.5 stars.

This was an excellent recipe! I used ground beef instead of sirloin, and added 1/2 can of beef broth as well. Best stroganoff I've ever had!

This recipe was super good.   My husband absolutely loves beef stroganoff and so I decided to make this.  The only thing I did different was I marinated my meat in soy sauce and minced garlic over night and to the sauce mixture I used about a half of can of beef broth.  Without the beef broth the mixture was to thick for my liking.  With these changes I will have to say PERFECTION!

While not difficult to make and using readily available ingredients I've had better stroganoff and wouldn't make this one again.  I didn't add as much sour cream as called for as the cream of mushroom soup looked so thick I thought that much sour creme would be too much.

The cream of mushroom soup is already thickened.  I think the flour made the gravy way to thick and clumpy.  If I ever make it again I definitely will omit the flour.

It was good, only change I made was to use golden mushroom  soup and I added one beef bouillon cube crushed with a little water to consistency I liked. I also added garlic as other reviewer's did.

Great recipe, but definitely needed more liquid to balance out the meat. I hate onion, so I added sliced mushrooms. After adding the soup, I added some white wine. I didn't have sour cream, so I used some heavy cream instead.

Pretty good, bland though.  I added one can cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery along w/ fresh mushrooms.  Otherwise I would have given it 3stars.

I used vegetarian steak strips in place of the real meat in this recipe...we weren't crazy about the texture of the meat, but I'm sure that had nothing to do with the actual recipe. I did add some broth to the mix as suggested by other reviewers. I'm not sure if it was the broth, or what, but I thought that it was a bit too salty. However, everyone enjoyed it.

I prepared this and marinated the steak in Merlot and garlic over night as suggested by another reviewer. The meat tasted awesome. As for the rest, very bland! Also, make sure you saute onions FIRST! They were very crunchy. Yuck! Overall was not well received. Won't be making this again. Now if I can come up with something to use the meat, that would be GREAT!!!

My husband loves home made beef stroganoff so I thought I would give this a try.  I didn't think there was enough sour cream so I added more.  Other then that it was fine.

I did two things different with this recipe.  First, as I browned the meat I added a splash of red wine to the pan.  And  for my paprika I used 1 tsp. of Hungarian paprika.  On the final product the red wine and Hungarian paprika gave it a nice tang.  The only this I'm still not sure about is that the sauce was a little thick and I felt like the recipe needed just one more ingredient but I am not sure what.
This meal did convert a stroganoff hater, into a stroganoff lover.  Pretty good praise.

This was really good and easy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that it was slightly bland, and the recipe didn't call for mushrooms, which is essential to a stroganoff (you can't count the "mushrooms" in the cream of mushroom soup). :)So, I sauteed the onions first, and then I added the meat (which in my case, was chicken instead of beef) - then the mushrooms. Once that was cooked, I added the rest of the ingredients. I also added about 3/4 cup of milk with the soup  - otherwise it would have been too thick. I also added granulated garlic and worchestershire for added flavor. This made it really yummy!! I will continue to use this as my base recipe for stroganoff.

I added a handful of mushrooms to the frying pan with the onions.  The dish was delicious- but I would marinate the beef for a few hours the next time I make this.  The beef was a bit tough.  The sauce was delicious though!

I'm fairly new to allrecipes but I found this recipe awesome. I did add a few things to change it up a bit. I sauteed my mushrooms and onions in a ton of butter. The sauce was thick so I added 1 1/2 cups of beef broth. But all in all it was a big hit in my home. I will be making this again!!

Very simple.  I used left over beef that was already cooked so I didn't marinate.  I threw in pan with onion and some olive oil to reheat.  Then, I added about 1/4 c. wine.  Followed the rest of the directions omitting the flour.  Very good and easy.

I've had beef stroganoff many times in my life and none have ever been like this. This is way to thick. I even followed others advice and added beef broth and water. It didn't help at all! I also only did 1 cup of flour and it still was super heavy. I also marinated the beef and even with that I thought it was weak in the flavor department. I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone.

This is one of the easiest recipes for stroganoff I have ever made.  Also, one of the tastiest :)  I make this every couple of weeks for a full week's worth of lunches for work and I NEVER get tired of it!

This was delicious.  I did, however, take the advice of the other reviewers and added more flavor.  I omitted the salt and added a beef bouillon cube and also added milk to thin up the sauce.  I also decreased the amount of sour cream.  It was excellent and I will definitely make this again.

It was a little thick.  I cut back on the sour cream and used some fat free milk to make the sauce thinner.

This was delicious.  I didn't give it a full 5 stars because it could use some improvement according to each person's tastes.  I used hamburger instead of steak because I am not a fan of steak.  Also, if any of you use the thick Amish noodles you might want to add more sour cream, it can be a bit dry without the extra because the noodles are so thick.  My grandma was wanting some good beef stroganoff and when I fixed this, she was pleased.  It tasted really good and was easy to make.  Thanks for this recipe.

Very tasty and flavorful.  We did use about a cup of water which might have been a little bit much but it turned out great anyway.  We couldn't find the paprika and omitted it as well but I didn't have noticed.  I will either marinate the meat or slow cook it next time to have it be a little more tender but overall everyone loved it. My husband nearly faints any time we add sour cream to anything but he loved it too. It is fast and easy and we'll make this a regular at our house! Thanks for the recipe!

I really didn't care for this as much as I'd hoped I would... My family thought it was great tho.  I had a hard time with the step where it says to put the flour mixture in with the meat and onions... There was no liquid for the flour to mix into...?  I added some olive oil, wine and chicken broth to make this mixture work.  The rest I followed to a "T"... It asked for 1 1/2 table spoons of flower... I'm wondering if it's suppose to be that much?  It was okay... I'll try another one for sure.

I forgot to add the flour, and had to cook the meat longer than the recipe called for, but it was very good and easy.

This was way too thick, I added 1/2 cup milk to thin it.  It also had too much sour cream.  It over-powered the taste of the stroganoff too much.  We added mushrooms as well.  I think the recipe required too much "doctoring" to consider it good enough "as is".

I used beef chuck, added sliced shitake mushrooms, and also added more milk. It was VERY GOOD but it didn't have a WHOLE lot of flavor. That is easily fixed, though, and I will definately use this as a stroganoff base recipe from now on!

This was pretty good.  Everyone ate it but there were some leftovers. I didn't save them because I didn't think they would taste very good reheated. As others have mentioned, I added some milk to thin the sauce down.

I thought this was just fine.  It's not authentic tasting but for something pretty quick it's wonderful.

I actually tossed the beef in the flour then browned and it was pretty good. 

Hubby loved it, I'll make it again.

I made this for my boyfriend who is still oohing and ahhing over it as we speak (type!).  I read others' comments in advance, so I added half a can of milk before simmering and a small jar of mushrooms. Delicious!!  Would have also been terrific without adding the sour cream. ;)

Pretty good, seemed to need something. One or two dashes of Worchestershire helped. I used ground sirloin and it came out lovely.

we had this dish for supper tonight...Beef stroganoff is my husbands favorite....and this was very good, quick, and easy. The cut of meat I used was not the best, and took away from the dish. I will make this again, and choose a better choice of beef...but over all it was excellent.

This was just O.K. and that's with some changes. As is, the sauce is way too thick and would only get 1 or 2 stars. I added a little milk and dissolved half a beef bouillon in 1/4 cup hot water and added that too the sauce as well (and it was still pretty thick). I used regular sour cream (not fat free) and used only 1 cup but I think 3/4 cup would be pleanty. I will not use this recipe again, next time I will try the Beef Stroganoff III recipe from this site.

This was a very good recipe. Our entire family enjoyed it, even my 9 year old son who can be very picky. One thing I did different is added beef broth to give it a little more flavor. Two thumbs up Sara

Without the sour cream it was the best stroganoff we'd ever tried.  I added Beef Boullion to increase the flavor.  It's also good with chicken and chicken boullion instead of beef.

my husband was asking for stroganoff. I had never made it before, so i was looking for a simple recipe. this one was very easy to make and tasted great. i would go easier on the paprika next time. i would also add some canned or fresh mushrooms. my family loved it.

I did not like this recipe. It was not very appetizing to look at. There was way too much sour cream. The meat was overcooked.
I will not be making this one again.

It seemed like there was too much sour cream to the taste of it.  Also, after all the cooking and simmering the meat became tough.

A really nice and quick dish to make for dinner.  I loved the flavour, and it's easy enough to whip up for a meal even after a long day at work.  I make it all the time, now!

I found that this recipe was very thick so I added milk. I have had better stroganoff but for a quick easy meal I would say that it was all those things plus tasty..

My husband and I loved this, but my son wouldnt even try it.  I thought it was tasty.  I only used 1/2 of the sour cream it called for, we both thought more would have been too much.

It needed more meat and more sauce.  Are you sure it needed all the extra salt? I had to thin it down with water to get it to the proper consistancy.  I wont make it again.

Great and tasty recipe...A little too many oninons for my taste, so i only used about 1/2 to 3/4 of an onion...and it wasn't creamy enough so I added some milk to thin it down.
