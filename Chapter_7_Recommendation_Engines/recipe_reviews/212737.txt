This was a very tasty sauce to top grilled salmon.  I used sun-dried tomato pesto and sprinkled capers on top.  A warning - don't try to make ahead of time and reheat the sauce.  It gets thick needs to be diluted with more milk.  Very good recipe.

The best salmon recipe that my husband and I have ever had!  I didn't change anything.  I used skim milk and reduced fat cream cheese in the sauce.  DELICIOUS!  Will probably be on our weekly menu for quite some time!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was a really great, easy dish.  I used a low fat cream cheese instead of regular and it was just fine.

This sauce was amazing (and so easy). I used white wine in place of the milk, and added parsley and fresh cracked pepper over the top. Served sauce on top of grilled salmon and chicken breast.

Typically, my husband is hard to impress when it comes to my cooking, but he really enjoyed this salmon recipe.  I cooked it exactly by the directions, using the very flavorful Buitoni pesto with basil that you can easily find in your local grocery store; however, I tasted the final sauce beforehand (which was tasty), but I felt like it was missing 1 ingredient...garlic.  I then chopped up 1 large clove of garlic and added it to the sauce.  Extra delicious!  I paired it with a garden salad.  We will definitely make this again.

I liked this recipe. The sauce was very rich, pretty simple. Just remember to keep a close eye on the sauce and continually stir it so that it doesn't bubble, pop or burn. It also holds up well and was just as good when you reheat it the next day.

Modifications I made were: Baking the salmon instead of grilling it (only because I don't own a grill) and I also added a couple pinches of dried dill to the sauce.

This made totally awesome salmon. I think it would make totally awesome any grilled or baked meat. I doubled the sauce and will use the leftover with baked chicken. I didn't have basil pesto, so used a black olive pesto I had on hand. The cream cheese will make any kind of pesto shine. A keeper for sure!

This was a very easy meal to prepare. However, it was way too rich therefore upsetting many people's stomach.  If I do decide to make this again, I would add something to the cheese combination to even out the richness.

Great tasting, I'm not sure if 2 tsp. is meant instead of 2 tablespoons. That seemed to be too much pesto for the sauce. Other than that, great!

I made this for dinner last night, and it was delicious. I served this sauce on top of salmon that I'd baked with a bit of olive oil & lemon pepper. I cook for two, so we used the extra sauce to top off some plain pasta.

How could this sauce not be amazing??!!  Next time I will add a little more milk to thin out and try chicken.  We made extra sauce for noodles, which went over well.  Serve with green beans.

After reading a few reviews decided to try it with a few modifications;the ingredients as is seemed like it would be too bland.  I used white wine instead of milk, and sauteed about 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms then added to sauce.  Also added some dill. Was tasty but have tried other salmon recipes from this site that I enjoy more.

This is a good recipe except that the pesto which I used did not make it with me.  Next time I will look for another brand.

Super simple and delicious. Serve with a side of pasta or some crispy potatoes to dip in the sauce. I double the sauce, never measure the pesto-just go off taste and color, and usually add a little chicken stock to thin it out a bit before serving.

I made this on a date it was awesome. The sauce had a great consistency and tasted amazing. I got pesto from whole foods and it was delicious.

I used 3-4 tbsp of pesto and a little sour cream in addition to the cream cheese. The sauce was amazing but the salmon came out dry. I prefer to soak the salmon in something before grilling.

This creamy sauce is a welcome change for those who dislike dill. Made this for cedar plank salmon on the BBQ for guests and got rave reviews.

Made this for dinner this evening. Hubby didn't say anything and I thought it was okay. I made it as stated, but was out of olive oil, so used a tablespoon of butter.
