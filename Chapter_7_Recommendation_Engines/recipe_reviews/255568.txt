Made this today. Very nice combination of flavors. I had jar artichoke instead of canned, so used 2 hearts. The recipe called for 4 eggs which is wayyy too many for 1 person (2 is plenty). The recipe also called for a pkg of spinach... a handful of spinach is plenty for 1 omelet for 1 person for breakfast.

Great way to get more vegetables in your diet. I really liked the flavor of the artichoke in this omelet. Will definitely make again.
