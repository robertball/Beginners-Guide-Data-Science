I didn't have the pine nuts or feta cheese but followed the recipe otherwise.  I cut the sprouts in half and they cooked just fine in the 25 minutes. They are wonderful, we all loved them this way.

My 6 and 4 year old nephews asked for three servings of this. Amazing! They did cook for an extra ten minutes or so. I was just hoping to introduce brussels sprouts to the family in a more delicous way than I remember them, but these were fantastic! I always hated these as a kid; I guess they just needed a good recipe!

Instead of boiling them to pre-cook a bit, try cutting into quarters and steaming briefly--keeps the taste and color better.  We leave out the Blue cheeze cuz at my house we think it tastes like feet--we use Havardi and everyone raves.  A surprising every-day veggie and SO diferent from our mothers oookey sprouts.

This is a fair recipe, but needs a lot of correcting: increase cooking time, decrease amount of butter used. Would not make again.

Brussel Sprouts were very tasty. However, they took way longer to cook than 25 minutes. I would suggest partially boiling them before baking. Very easy recipe.

Simple yet tasty way of preparing sprouts, which was my nightmare food from childhood.  Don't like Feta so I grated Peccorino Romano cheese over top.  I also toasted the pine nuts before adding.

I am always looking for good brussels sprouts recepies, and this one I will definately make again. Since I didn't have blue cheese, I used feta; and I served it over couscous with a bit of feta and a sprinkling of lemon juice mixed in. It made a lovely little dish.

I substituted margarine for butter, cut the Brussels sprouts into quarters and cooked them at 350F for 30 minutes. The baked Brussels were great. I will definitely make this again.

Yum!  If you love brussel sprouts, you'll love this recipe!  I served it to dinner guests on New Year's Eve.  It was a hit.

I really like brussels sprouts, and the taste of these is far better than the standard boiling method.  They are so flavorful.  I agree that 25 mins. is not long enough.  I brought them just to a boil for 10 mins careful not to boil out the flavor, then followed the recipe.  I have made them several times and have received several compliments from my brussels sprouts loving friends and family.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was most delicious. The blue cheese was very complimentary to the sprouts. The whole bowl was gobbled up, everyone wanted second helpings. Will make this again.

while I loved the simplicity of the dish, I did not like the strong lemon flavor, nor did my husband.  Next time I'd make it without the lemon and substitute chicken broth instead.

Awesome recipe! I'm not a seasoned cook and this was so easy to follow and the end result was amazing. Loved the blue cheese with it, it should be a must not an optional. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I only had lime juice and ground almonds, but this was a tasty idea!  We skipped the cheese since my son doesn't like cheese.

We really liked the basic recipe.  Skipped nuts & cheese due to looking for simple recipe as side.  Used half the amount of butter.  Cooked extra 15 minutes since we like them more tender.

This was pretty good for brussel sprouts but the brussel sprouts would be better cut in half before baking and the cooking time may need to be adjusted I would say it would be best to check them at 25min with a fork for tenderness. Didnt have the pine nuts but I bet they wouldve been tasty as I love nuts!

The flavor was very good, but the brussel sprouts need to cook much longer than they do in this recipe. I think next time I would steam them first to get them nice and soft. Might be worth another try.

Made this for Thanksgiving and the folks that like brussels sprouts really enjoyed it. The pine nuts and blue cheese are great pairing. Wouldn't change a thing.

The end taste was very good.  However, I had to uncover, up the temp, and cook for much longer.  Next time I'll probably stick to my old staple:  coat in olive oil, salt and pepper, lay flat on cookie sheet and turn from time to time for 30 minutes.  Temperature depends on size of sprouts (375-425).

Update: I made these for Thanksgiving again and parboiled the sprouts the day before. It cut down the baking time. /// I made these for Thanksgiving exactly as stated and they disappeared!I will make these again.

This recipe was not a hit at our house.  Although we like all the ingredients separately, we didn't care for the combination.  The lemon juice and blue cheese combo just didn't work well with the brussels sprouts.  I think the dish would have been better without those two ingredients.  I did cut the brussels sprouts in half and they were ready in 25 minutes.

Easy and yummy.  I agree with the other reviews that these take much longer than 25  minutes to bake.  I put mine in the oven with chicken and it all came out done at the same time.

Cut your fresh sprouts in half if you want them tender!!!! Also, add about 10-15 minutes on the timer. 
I used walnuts instead of pine nuts, just preference. I omitted the cheese, I didn't have any on hand. I added extra lemon juice and half the butter.  I will be making this again, with the cheese.

This was good/easy.  I had to bake 30 minutes longer for the sprouts to be fully cooked, but overall I would make again.

I liked the idea of charring the brussels sprouts, so this recipe appealed to me.  I love brussels sprouts and looked forward to preparing this dish.
Unfortunately, I found the sprouts to be too salty and not as tasty as other reviewers had concluded.
Since I rely on the reviews for my judgement on whether or not to prepare a recipe, I will try this recipe again.  Perhaps I didn't get fresh enough sprouts... it's still an intriguing recipe and I'm sure that I just haven't gotten something correct in the preparation.

Not one of my favs in the vegetable family. I added a glaze made from cider. It helped but not much. I read several comments from a few of AR's recipes for some suggestions especially the positive ones. I might try soaking them in brine to perk the modiggers up. THANKS

Very tasty.  It is vegan with vegan butte instead of regular.
I broiled it for  3 minutes uncovered to get it to brown a bit and it was excellent.

I made this tonight and both my wife and I were very pleased with it, will certainly use this again.

I substituted chopped pecans for the pine nuts and baked it for forty minutes rather than twenty five minutes.    Easy, tasty, and even looks good.

This recipe, with a few changes, has revolutionized the role of Brussels sprouts in my family.  Previously a boiled side dish at Thanksgiving and Christmas, it is now regularly requested for other family meals.  There are rarely any leftovers and guests go for seconds and thirds of this dish, leaving the turkey behind.  

I cut the sprouts in half before cooking and often cook for 45 minutes or more.  I prefer the sweetness that emerges when the sprouts are caramelized and softer.  My mom is not a fan of blue cheese, but has been brought over to the light through this dish.  To accommodate her sensitivity to that flavour, I use cambozola over a sharper blue.   

The only reason for four stars over five is that I've altered the recipe a bit.  With the adjustments, it's six.

I followed the recipe except cutting the butter in half and that was plenty for me. The sprouts tasted raw after 25 minutes and needed more time in oven. Also I love blue cheese but didn't care for the mix of flavors in this dish.

I make Brussels sprouts all the time. nice recipe hadn't tried with pine nuts or blue cheese. Thanks  Agree to roast the pine nuts also for those of you who par boiled the sprouts, try halving the spouts and steam so much flavor is lost when you boil. If you don't have a vegie steamer use a large pot and place the water in put the vegies in a colander put a lid on top it wont seal not a problem otherwise it wont steam Just make sure there is water until the vegie is tender then finish with whatever recipe you are using. You won't loose the nutrients or flavor of the vegie when steamed. Of course unless you steam till you kill the vegie.

I baked in a dutch oven and they turned out great. Did not have pine nuts or cheese and it turned out good. Not a huge fan of blue cheese so that's ok with us. I followed other suggestions and increased the cooking temp to 400. Great will make again.

it was alright. had to use feta instead of blue cheese...probably would have preferred the blue cheese. no leftovers. cooked for longer than time indicated, despite halving the recipe. it went well with the main course of cornmeal-breaded white fish.
