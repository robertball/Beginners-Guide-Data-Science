Delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe instructed.  I did halve the recipe as I only had one can of mushrooms and I sprinkled dried parsley over it at the end just because I like the green color.  It tasted even better the next day. Will definitely make this again.

I ended up doubling the mustard but only due to personal preference. These are great and get better the longer they sit!
