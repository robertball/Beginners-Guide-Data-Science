This was VERY good!!  I was sceptical and without high hopes but I was extremely impressed with the depth of flavor!  My picky eater kiddos went back for 3rds.  The sauce and onions tasted amazing with the rice I served it on, it really reminded me of a chinese dish of some sort.  I am very picky about any gamey taste and you really, truely could not tell this was venison and I wasn't even using the backstrap.  We will make this many more times.  I don't like store bought dressings so I used my fav. balsamic vinaigrette: In a jar w/ lid mix 1/2 c. balsamic vinegar (I like cosco brand) 2 tsp. sugar, 1 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp. dijon mustard. shake vigorously..add 1/2 c. E. V. Olive oil..shake like crazy.  then I added 1/2 c. raspberry jelly for this recipe.  I did not "boil" my meat like the recipe implies but instead seared it in an extremely hot pan which carmelized it nicely. I also added 1 tbsp. chicken bullion to the onion water. yummy!

Had a dinner party of 12 people, 8 of which where not venison fans, and well there where no leftovers.  Everyone wanted the recipe so they all went home with this website..if I could I would like to give this one a 10.

I thought this was very good!  I added red/yellow peppers, broccoli, water chestnuts, and mushrooms to the mixture right when I added the meat.  I cooked it for approx 12-13 minutes.  The meat ended up a little tough- maybe overcooked but next time I will marinate it overnight.  Served like stir-fry over fried rice- delicious and healthy!

Delicious!  I marinaded it overnight because my dinner plans changed at the last minute.  I added some broccoli & carrots, and served over rice to make it more like a stir fry.

My kids LOVED this recipe, even my 2yo.  I cooked it a little longer than the recipe called for to reduce the marinade and juices to a nice thick sauce.  I imagine the taste can vary depending on the raspberry vinegarette that you use.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 because it wasn't my husband's favorite.

This got rave reviews at our table! We paired it with Nana's Turnips and Potatoes and greatly enjoyed our meal.  Some venison veterans were very impressed with they tasty game meat and a first time venison eater was VERY impressed and claimed he would now look at elk and think "You are yummy."

Like another user I was skeptical of this recipe. I didn't want an overwhelming vinegar taste at all. I was pleasantly surprised at how the flavors really came together. If I were to make any changes next time I might use an Asian vinaigrette

Definately not a favorite! The flavor was not at all what i had expected, but I never tried anything like this! My husband was thinking he needed to send me to culinary school after that. Just not our thing i guess.

I made this tonight and it was the first time I have cooked venison. I chose this recipe because it did not require a long marinating time. The meat was very tender. I omitted the extra sugar in the onions but the dish was still sweeter than I prefer. Everyone enjoyed it but I probably would opt fora more traditional meal.

Very yummy.  It turned out that we had less than a pound of venison, so the full amount of sauce was rather strong.  It overpowered the meat flavor--vinegar is strong.  So I would recommend that if you don't have enough meat, reduce the marinade.  Great with rice and plain veggies.

Very different recipe. This is a sweeter dish. Its not something that I will cook all the time, but I will definitely keep it around. It takes the gamey taste away because it is such a strong flavor. The caramelized onions are awesome! this is not a flavor for everyone but I still give it five stars because it is good as is.

I followed the recipe exactly but added shiitake mushrooms to the onions and garlic. One note many may miss is the 3!4 cup water is added wo the olive oil and butter. This boils down cooking the onions to softness and then what is left is the oils to fry the onions and mushrooms. I placed venison backstrap pieces in the sauce while it was boiling and flipped it over.  Cut into the meat to be sure it was medium rare and served over brown rice. A bit like sweet sour sauce. Next time I will add a little spice in to kick it up a notch. Maybe a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.
