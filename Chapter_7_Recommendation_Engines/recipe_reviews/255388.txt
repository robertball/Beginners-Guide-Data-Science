Made it as written and good but I think there is one small change that would make this even better. Butter. Brown the onions and sprouts in butter instead of the oil for a deep caramelized flavor.

It was good I added more butter than what was called for in the recipe.  It really needs some kind of meat like beef strips, ham, bacon or shrimp, that would make it way better.

As suggested, I did half olive oil/half butter to brown. I also tripled the garlic. I used about a cup of water with whole wheat gnocchi, they were super soft and tender. I also added some chopped cherry tomatoes and a little parmesan at the end. Overall, quick, easy, relatively healthy.

Great recipe.  I did season to taste and doubled up the garlic.  Cut the Brussels in half and brown them up in a olive oil butter mix to brown them.  At the end I gave them a little bit of fresh ground Parmesan.  I am making this again!!!

Excellent recipe, used butter instead of oil as others suggested. Splash of white wine with the simmer water & 1tbs bacon bits. Can't wait to make again.

Personally, I think the gnocchi were too doughy for this dish. I will try medium pasta shells, or maybe  tortellini, next time. Of course, I tampered with the recipe. I left out the oil (high in saturated fat), and omitted the salt, and substituted aged balsamic vinegar for the lemon juice, and added lots of minced garlic. This made for a more robust flavor to compliment the fresh Brussels sprouts. Still needs work, though.

Great idea and very tasty once I seasoned it to my liking . I would recommend more onion, garlic, salt, and pepper.

No one in my family really enjoyed this.  Came out on the dry side.  Probably will not make again.

Delicious side dish!  I added some butter as others suggested to crisp the gnocchi up a bit and it came out fantastic.

Delicious and simple to make... you can add bacon bits just to get a crunch!
