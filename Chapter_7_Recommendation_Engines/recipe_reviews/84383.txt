I like this recipe, however, I think it would have been better with refried beans or something heavy to make it thicker.  Though, overall, it was yummy on the tastebuds!  My friends and I ate it with yellow corn tortilla chips.

This recipe tasted good, but I have to echo the other review and say that it's a little too liquid-y to warrant a higher rating.  Perhaps a solider cheese source (dare I say Velveeta?) would help?

This tasted nice, but was hard to use as a dip. It's too thin to really stay on the chip - the beans and all the bits just ooze of the chip.
