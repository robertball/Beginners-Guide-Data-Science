I'm basically just rating the dressing, which tasted exactly like its ingredients: bacon grease and vinegar. Huge bacon-lover here, but I just didn't care for this all that much.  Maybe my bacon produced too much grease.  Glad I didn't add salt; the bacon provided enough. I would add the grease in increments to try to get a good balance.

We enjoyed this is was a nice change of pace. I did add about another tsp of brown sugar I just thought it needed to be a bit sweeter for me. It paired very well with the clam chowder I made for dinner. Thanks for the tasty submission!

The red wine vinegar is strong, so I added 2 more tablespoons of brown sugar.  I microwaved some bacon bits in a bowl and added the mixture to the bacon and served.  Tasted really good.
