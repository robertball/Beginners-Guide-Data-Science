I rec my magazine the other day and looking thru it I found this recipe. I knew right away this could be an alternative to hash browns and it was. I love crispy hash browns and this was a great replacement.  I didn't need all that cheese and would leave it off next time just to save the extra calories.

This is a great recipe.  I never thought to add cheese to the ramen.  Great idea.  I think Parmesan is great. I often fry my cooked ramen in toasted sesame oil.  This gives the noodles a great flavor.  If anyone is concerned about the oil used, I recommend coconut oil.    I love eggs and bacon as well.  My cholesterol is perfect even for my age.  Cholesterol is not terribly affected by diet because cholestrol issues are inherited.  Check the Harvard study. The body needs fats to absorb certain vitamins and minerals.  Ramen is just like any other noodle, no worse and no better.

Someone mentioned ramen is bad for you.  It isn't necessarily. The noodles are carbs.  The flavor packets may or may not be unhealthy but mostly because they usually have a lot of salt.  I love plain fried ramen made using sesame oil and some coconut oil.  It is great as the recipe  is written and also with chow mein or lo mein or simply as a snack.
