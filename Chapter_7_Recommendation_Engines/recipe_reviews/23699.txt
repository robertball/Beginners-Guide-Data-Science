I made a sample batch of this spread to decide if I wanted to serve it at an upcoming party. It was even better than I expected! I did leave out the sweet pickle relish and substituted onion powder for the chopped onion because I wanted a creamy spread without chunks. It is really delicious and will definitely be served at my party!!

LOVE this cheese dip! I also left out the pickle relish. Great mild horseradish taste and so creamy!

I made the recipe exactly as written except for using soy milk instead of cream which I did not have. I thought it was okay but not spectacular. I think the sweet pickled relish takes over the taste of the cheese too much.

Instead of pickle relish I ran a few garlic dills through my food processor with the onion until it was a fine consistancy then folded it into the cream cheese. I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and increased it to a half teaspoon. After tasting this I did add a little more horseradish. GREAT cheese spread--loved it on bagels.

Delish for those of us who love horseradish!  Used green onion for a milder onion flavor.
