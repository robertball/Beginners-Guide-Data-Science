I love this recipe.  The second time I made it I added shredded parmesan cheese to it.  I also made the chopped parsley into a pesto using 2 tablespoons olive oil with salt and pepper.

This was a nice way to dress up flank steak, and is a good basic recipe for "fine-tuning" to meet your personal tastes. My changes: I didn't have tenderizer, so I decided to marinade for 1.5 hours in 1Tbs red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup canola oil, and 4 big cloves chopped garlic. In addition to the bacon, I added shredded parmesan and thick-sliced mushrooms. I used regular salt instead of seasoned salt, and no garlic powder. I also soaked the toothpicks to prevent burning. Next time I'm going to add either cooked rice or barley, and roasted red peppers.

Great idea!  I had thin serloin steaks that had to be used.  I seasoned the steaks, scored them, then spread on pesto, sprinkled with grated parmesean, laid a strip of bacon top and rolled up.  I secured with a toothpick.  My family loved this.  A new twist on steaks on the grill!

Sounds delicious...will give it a try next time li'l brother decides to grill...and in reply to NYDee...yes, people DO still eat like this...flank steak may be a "cheap" cut of beef, but it's very lean, (it's the same cut used for fajitas) and the one and 1/4  slices of bacon per serving is not going to do any major damage, health-wise...I see a cardiologist regularly and he says it's perfectly fine to eat bacon, red meat, eggs, etc. in moderation...he's a top-notch doctor, I trust his judgment...I'll enjoy this...and leave the "food snobs" to their own vices....

to Joy, I have made this recipe 4 times and have used both basil and tarragon pesto (homemade with lots of parmesan cheese).  The basil pesto seems to work the best.  I do omit the tenderizer and use beer to marinate the steak over night.  Does a great job of tenderizing.  I also leave out the parsley because of the pesto.  Skirt steak works also but the low cost of flank makes an economical meal and is also fun to work with.

I followed others suggestion of adding a thin layer of pesto and I think it made the dish.  It would probably still be good without it, but it definitely gave it an extra splash of flavor.  Tasted like something you'd have in a fine restaurant.  I used the bacon that comes pre-cooked which helped cut down on prep time and clean up.  Only complaint would be it was a bit salty -- maybe cut back on the salt next time.

I am a vegetarian but I made these for my bf and he LOVED them. I gave it 4 stars because I couldn't taste them myself and I think 5 stars has to be mind-blowingly delicious. I used sirloin and forgot the parsley. I also used my indoor grill/panini maker. Next time I will make them with some alterations (maybe cheese, grilled garlic) but they apparently were awesome without.

I would caution under cooking this meat, anytime you roll meat and cause the bacteria living on the outside to be protected from exposure to high heat you run the risk of not killing the bacteria,, this should be cooked to very well done all the way through,,

This is a great main dish for those doing low carb/high protein eating plans, like Atkins or Paleo!  As someone else mentioned, add spinach in the roll-up to create "Steak & Bacon Tournedos Florentine". Absolutely brilliant!!

I had forgotten all about this recipe.  LOVE it.  It's a great way to enjoy beef--especially in this economy!  It's not prime rib, but it's an enjoyable dinner.  Like others, I used parmesan before, and have also added drained/squeezed frozen spinach. Yum.  As for the previous reviewer, yes, people do eat like this.  Most of us enjoy it in moderation, with the realization that no food is a bad food--only the choice in how you use it is bad.  If you wish to have a discussion about food choices, I'd kindly suggest that you take it to a more appropriate site.  This area is for reviewing recipes.

I am not rating this recipe bc I have not made it yet. Upon reading the reviews, most of you are adding "pesto". Can someone tell me what kind of pesto are being used since there are different kinds of pesto out there? TY.

Most likely if I had made this on a grill instead of a griddle, it would have received 5 stars, but due to limited circumstances, i couldn't really cook it evenly and it ended up overcooked on the edges. VERY good though still, look forward to trying this once I fix my grill situation

This sounded better than it turned out. Steak was tough, & bacon was chewy. "IF" I try it again, I will use a different cut of meat, & perhaps fry the bacon more & crumble it. Just wasn't pleased....

Made this as a hearty appetizer for the superbowl.  It was fabulous but I did make basic upgrades such as coating the meat with garlic infused Olive Oil on both sides and adding Montreal seasoning to the mix so the meat had a hearty/blackening coating to it.

Delicious.  I only used 4 pieces of bacon and added some grated parmesan cheese.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used parsley flakes and it was fine.  Family said the recipe was a keeper.

i had the butcher run a large flanj steak through the cuber 4-5 times - that way you dont have to pound it out and the seasoning gets in all of the crevices. Great time saver!!
