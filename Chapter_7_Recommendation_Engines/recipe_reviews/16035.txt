Great recipe! I simplified this by cooking it in a crock pot for 10 hours on low. Saved time by cooking bacon, and cutting carrots the night before. Did not brown lamb, not necessary when crocking for so long. Just tossed the taters, carrots, onions,and garlic in pot. Added lamb, Then added the stock and wine mixed with spices on top of lamb.  However, I did thicken with some flour; Just turned crock on high and stired for the last five to ten minutes. Made it very thick and hearty! Served it in sour dough bread bowls...It is now an Easter tradition!!!!

I have been meaning to review this for quite awhile so here it is. 

This definitely deserves a 5 star and more. I started out with the 10 serving recipe and this year will start making it for 30 servings as my closest friends want it and their friends also want it. I had to buy a 20 quart stock pot so it could hold all the ingredients. The flavor is just fantastic and worth the time and effort it takes to make. 

I use boneless leg of lamb as none of the grocery stores I went to can get all the pounds of the lamb shoulder I need, but it still tastes great and even better after letting the flavors meld together for a few days in the refrigerator. I round it off with a few loaves of Irish Soda Bread. 

This makes a great gift for those friends that have already bought everything they want. 

Thanks Danny for a lifetime keeper of a recipe.

I wanted an authentic Irish Stew, and this was it. My family loved it, as long as I didn't tell the kids it was lamb. Teehee. I did use beer instead of wine, and I would make sure the potatoes are cubed. It's absolutely better after a few days, which I didn't think was possible. I wish lamb was less expensive, because I would make this much more often if it were. I can't wait to make this again!

When I took the first taste of this stew - I about died!  It was so delicious and relatively easy to make!  I used just over half the amount of meat the recipe called for.  There wasn't enough available at the store. It turned out perfect!!  I was pleased with my results, it couldn't have been better.  However, the next time I made the recipe, I used the full amount - and boy did it make a difference.  It was way too much meat.  I couldn't eat very much, it was too rich.  I would suggest using less meat than is called for and more vegetables.  This is my new cold-weather dish!  When I made it for my extended family, the response was overwhelming!  Even my husband - who never gets excited about any foods  - was very vocal about his fondness of this dish.  With his thumbs-up, I knew I had a winner.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Very good recipe.  I did tweak quite a bit.  Scaled recipe for 6 servings and made the following changes:
1/2 lb bacon(good bacon from meat counter) 
2 lbs lamb steaks 
1 onion divided
1 Tbs brown sugar 
no thyme
1/2 C red wine to deglaze pan
Then threw everything in crock pot after browning and sauteing and deglazing, cooked on low 4 hrs
added 1 Cup or so Guinness, cooked another hour, stirred in fresh, chopped parsley and served with Irish brown soda bread(by Andrea Doyle, also from this site)

I give this Irish Lamb Stew 5 stars for taste, but the instructions are lackluster. Are you serious that step 4 "for 20 minutes until vegetables are tender" are correct"? Carrots take much long to make tender in a pre-boiling pot of water alone. Sorry, unless you expect raw crunchy carrots and potato bits step 4 needs to start within 30 minutes after step 3.  Secondly, the prep time is not 20 minutes. I am marking this a 2 out 5 Stars for the prep time alone. The taste is incredible, but the aggravation of making this dish is not worth the trouble. This recipe failed for me as explained.

This was good. I followed the recipe for the most part. Didnt see any need to change it:) I did add the carrots in a little earlier then the potatoes, I like mine to be soft. Added some Rosemary and parsley seemed to give it more flavor then just the beef stock. I needed to add more liquid so put a little more wine in and a bit of water and all was good. Stew should be left to sit for a while before serving it tastes so much better warmed up!!! Oh I added a little mash potato, Every homemade stew I have had in Ireland had both. and I liked it!!!!

Very tasty recipe. I left out the bacon, and used a bit of olive oil instead to cut down on the fat. Thanks for sharing!!

Great flavor! I used boneless lamb loin as my butcher had no shoulder. I put everything in the crock pot, left for work in the AM, came home and enjoyed! Definitely make with the Irish soda bread on this site!

Sitting here in Wicklow Ireland and looking through recipes for dinner tomorrow. I usually look here as I can find something a wee bit different to the usual fare on Irish websites. I cooked this with the wine which I found odd putting into s stew but hey I did say I wanted something different to Irish food. The recipe is perfect but God the wine ruins it. Leave it out. Traditionally we don't put any alcohol into stews. Stews came from a time when people had very little and if they had a bottle of guinness etc they certianly wouldnt have wasted it on cooking. Wine was something the Irish never had accept the upper class british here at the time so that deffinitly wouldnt have been in a stew. As I said the reipe is perfect but leave out the bitter wine and its gorgeous.

Really good.  Like others, I replaced the wine with Guinness.  Added celery.  Also, maybe it was the cut of lamb I used, but the stew was glistening with an unhealthy layer of fat when done, so I separated liquid from solid, chilled, removed the fat, then mixed back together.  Will definitely make again.

I am giving feedback for a slightly modified version of this recipe.  First modification:  I trimmed extra fat off the bacon after it was cooked, but before chopping it up.  Second modification:  I used Guinness instead of white wine.  Third modification:  I let the finished product chill and scraped the 1/4-inch layer of fat off the top.  The recipe itself is not well written and can be confusing for an inexperienced cook.  First, the recipe calls for 3 potatoes.  It does not specify what size potatoes or even recommend a variety.  I used 5 medium/small red potatoes, in case the potatoes should have been larger ones - to make up the difference.  Also, the recipe does not specify what size to cut the potatoes, although it does specify the size of the carrot pieces.  Which brings me to my next comment.  The recipe says diced carrots, which in my training means chopped into medium bits, but the photo with the recipe shows typical stew-size chunks of carrot (which is what I chose to do).  That said, this stew is excellent:  The lamb was tender; the flavors blend well; and the combination of lamb, beef broth, and bacon give it a complexity that keeps your taste buds entertained and totally satified.  I dropped some off at my sister's house on St. Patrick's Day and she and her family called to cheer!  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again.  I would have given it 5 stars if the instructions had been clearer.

Very good but needed a few changes IMO. Get your lamb from COSTCO if it is hard to find at your grocery.  It's about $20 for 5 lbs which is plenty for this recipe...it's the leg that has been deboned and trimmed and wrapped in a cooking net.  CHANGES: replace all of the water AND wine in the recipe with Guiness or other stout; add more salt and pepper throughout the cooking; add frozen green peas at the very end (this added color is essential for an eye appealing meal); if the broth is too thin at the end add a bit of corn starch and cold water to thicken.

This recipe is fantastic.  I made it for an Irish friend who has traveled throughout the Emerald Isle sampling their stews, and he absolutely raved about it.  He said it was better than any he had tried in Ireland.  To save money, I used leg of lamb rather than shoulder. I worried it might not be tender enough, but we could cut it with our soup spoons!  Also, you must simmer the carrots and potatoes much longer than the recommended 20 minutes to soften them.  Lastly, I definitely recommend letting the cooked dish sit in the fridge overnight.  Reheat on the stove the next day before serving.  This is absolutely perfect!

Excellent base recipe, although I do tweak it a bit. Definitely make this a day ahead, it gives the flavors a chance to marry. Slow cookers are excellent for this recipe. Since I am such a keener, i keep rendered bacon fat on hand at all times. Instead of all the bacon called for in the recipe, I use a little bacon fat combined with olive oil. I use half the meat called for, half lamb and half nice stewing beef, then I add double the veg..brown the meat, I add leeks, garlic&celery to onions, i also add parsnips instead of sugar for a nice sweetness. Deglaze with a bit of broth... I also add Guinness instead of wine, top off with water, and a jigger of whiskey near the end of cooking for flavour..don't be afraid to make this recipe your own, and i serve with colcannon and soda bread for an authentic St. Patty's Day feast! Slainte! And this makes a great pot-pie with the leftovers..also freezes pretty well!

I didn't have high hopes for this as I don't like the taste of alcohol infused food, but I wanted to make the recipe as is, and I was very impressed! The flavor was excellent, and though the bacon seemed unnecessary, it was a great addition. I also added some celery and used a dark, yeasty beer. The lamb was very tender and a perfect meat for this stew. I will definitely make this again.UPDATE: I just came back from Ireland, and I must honestly say, this stew beats any that I tried in Ireland! Thanks Danny!

Absolute goodness.  I'm a happy cook and my family and friends are happy eaters.  To make this great you must do the flour, salt, and pepper coating, as well as the deglazing.  Used 12 oz of Scuttlebutt beer instead of wine - 8 oz would be about right.  I did it with a 4 lb Costco piece of boneless roast that I cubed - it was just about right for meat content.  Nevertheless - true happiness for a winter meal.

This stew was great!  I did add a bit of rosemary as recommended by another reviewer, and I also added a bit more sauvignon blanc and water before adding the vegetables.  I also added 2 stalks of celery (recipe for 4 servings) sliced.  For potatoes I used 2 red potatoes each cut into 1/8ths.  I didnt have the foresight to prepare this meal the day before, but I did have time to let it sit for 90 minutes before rewarming and serving.  It was absolutely delicious.  I served it with a simple green salad and warmed Italian bread.

The recipes was delicious.  Because it was what was available and what was more inexpensive, I used a combination of lamb shoulder and neck meat.  And while I used the bacon fat to fry the meat, I used it sparingly and sometimes in combination with olive oil.  My version also used Guinness instead of wine, and I used beef broth instead of stock, which worked just as great, and added an additional cup of the stock so that there would be more stew and it wouldn't be so thick (and it was still thick and hearty, but not solid).  Highly recommended recipe!

First off, this is only the 2nd time I have rated a recipe on this site.  This was incredible!  The first thing my husband said was WOW!  I halved the recipe and followed it through the simmer for 1-1/2 hours.  I then put everything in the crockpot, and deglazed the stock pot with the wine first before adding (stock pot had yummies on the bottom I didn't want to waste).  Cooked in the crockpot for 4 hours on high.  I agree with other reviews that 20 minutes for the veggies was too short, but this way was great!

Recipe sounds delicious, when I made mine, I kinda did my own thing.  No wine, no sugar, no thyme or stock. I used water, rosemary plus what he mention. But the crucial thing for me was to skim the fat. It improved the flavor greatly. I also cut up half a pound of chuck steak and cook it with the lamb. Total cook time about 3 hours.

OMGosh!! You'll Love this one. 
After reading the reviews, I did make a few changes. I used 7 strips of the bacon, Added 1/2 cup of barley that I pre-cooked (the barley gives it a thick consistency), 1 teas. Rosemary, And used 3 lbs of leg meet and of course 1 cup of Guinness Extra Stout Beer that replaced the wine. 
Wow, even if you don't like lamb its well worth your time.
Thank you so much Danny, I have English/Welsh heritage but my mother learned to cook here in the US so this is one of the dishes my mother grew up on but never cooked for us.

I'm not Irish, but a farm girl from Ohio.  I sauted the veggies in the bacon grease before adding the meat to brown.  It flavored the veggies to perfection. I added celery for added taste.  This was excellent.  It is NOT low fat and someone suggested leaving out the bacon???  That is what gives it such a wonderful taste.

This was really great.  I made it for Easter dinner last year.  It takes some time, but I did cook it in the slow cooker, which made it nice for the actual cooking time and did give it a nice long time for flavors to blend well.

Delicious flavor though I was worried about putting in 3 whole onions and only 3 potatoes. I used less thyme because I don't care for it and skipped the bay leaves because I didn't have them. I also used only 3-4 pounds of lamb. I got the lamb on sale but still cost quite a bit for that much and it seemed to be more fat and bones than there was meat. It was very difficult and time consuming trying to cut all the fat off and the meat off the bones. The whole recipe was quite greasy with the bacon too and I scooped off the layer of fat before reheating. If I make this recipe again, I will NOT be using lamb.

Delicious!  It's freezing outside and I was craving something that was stick-to-the-ribs good so I decided to give this a try.  So glad I did!  The flavor is wonderful and it was easy to do.  My only complaint is that even after coating the lamb in flour, the liquids in the stew were much thinner than I like for a stew even after hours and hours of simmering it in the crockpot.  This was easily fixed though.  I just mixed up a roux with butter and flour (I used 2 tbsp of each to thicken 5 servings worth of stew) and stirred it in shortly before dinner time and it thickened up nicely.

I did make some changes.  Rather than cooking it on the stove, I threw all of the ingredient into my crock pot and cooked it on low for 10 hours.  I also upped the garlic (because I love it!) and the potatoes, substituted red wine for the portions of white wine and water that were called for and added some Rosemary in the same proportions as the Thyme. I also just bought some precut lamb stew meat so I'm not sure what cut it came from, but it braised nicely.  Didn't bother to brown it first as I knew it'd be in the crockpot for long enough to cook it thoroughly.

Fabulous recipe!  I'll be making this again and might try adding Guinness next time as some of the other reviewers have suggested.

Only 4 stars because I felt the stew was a little too thin and watery -- I missed that thickness I usually associate with stew. I whisked some warm water with flour, and also a touch of heavy cream. After adding this the stew thickened up and turned a nice beige color that I'm used to in Irish Stews. I also did this in a slow cooker; started for 1 hour on high, then turned it down to low for 5 more hours. After the first 3 hours I added the veggies (also included celery) and I wished I had waited another hour because 2 hours would have been perfect for the veg. I did without the bacon to bring down the calorie/fat count. I also added a lot more thyme, salt and pepper, in addition to some garlic powder, and substituted chicken broth for the beef broth and beer for wine. The basic recipe was very good, and with a bit of tweaking it turned out just like the Irish Stew at my local Irish Pub.

This is the first time I have made Irish Lamb Stew and let me tell you it is most certainly not the last!  Hands down this is one of the best meals I have made in some time!  Everyone absolutely loved it - even my pickiest son - he had 3 servings.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of only using about half of the lamb meat stated.  The ratio was still quite generous.    I have decided to make this for my parents when they come visit - I am sure it will be a big hit!  Thanks for sharing Danny.

I prepared this exactly as described, right down to chilling and defatting. I was reheating it the enxt day on the stove and my inattention allowed the gravy to caramelize on the bottom of a cast iron pan. It wasn't burnt but close. I scraped it all into a plastic container and refrigerated it once more. That simple error elevated this to a whole new level of silkiness. The gravy was supple, spoon coating thick and the entire pot was consumed by one person over 3 meals. It is a definite keeper.

What a great stew!  I used 2lbs of beef stew meat instead of lamb, and added one parsnip (diced).  Also- I de-glazed the pan using the 1 cup of white wine.  It took the veggies about 45 minutes to soften up in the pot so adjust the time to accommodate.  Great with crusty bread on a cold rainy day!

Fantastic!  I made this recipe with leftover roast leg of lamb.  I had about 2 1/2 pounds of meat, so I only used 1/2 pound of bacon.  After cooking the onion and garlic in the bacon fat (with some celery) I added the vegetables, wine,  and stock and simmered until they were soft.  Then I added the leftover lamb and all the pan gravy I had made to go with it, along with the crumbled bacon.  A wonderful, thick, flavorful stew.

Next time I would reduce the bacon to 7 oz and I only used 2 lbs of Lamb, but you would be ok with 1.5 lbs. This would bring the cost down and decrease the fat.

After reading through the reviews I used about half the amount of meat, switched Guinness for the wine and made it a day ahead of time.  (prep time is WAY off---this is a whole afternoon project)  My husband, the beef lover, said he liked this better than beef stew---that's sayin' somethin'!
Served w/ Irish Soda bread from this site----excellent meal!

Delish!  Made this last night for dinner and I just ate leftovers for lunch today.  It really does age well.  The flavors are richer the next day.  The only thing I did differently was to use several sprigs of fresh thyme instead of dried.  Yummy!  Can't wait to make it for St. Pat's day.

Awesome stew! Served as a "sit around the fire" informal meal and got rave reviews. Homemade hearth bread soaked up the broth...mmm.I re-calculated to serve 5, but needed to add a bit more beef stock than called for. I also skimmed off much of the fat since I was serving right away.  I used a dry white (Sauvingnon Blanc), which was surprisingly good. Next time will try with a red.  Looking forward to leftovers. This is a keeper!!

This was a huge hit! Be sure to plan ahead and make it the day before, it is immensely better that way. If gravy is too thin, mash up a few of the potato pieces and stir them into the gravy -- it will thicken up nicely and taste great.  I served with corn muffins and rosemary focaccia bread. Several guests put a slice of the bread at the bottom of their bowl and ladled the stew on top of it.  This was a great way to sop up the gravy!  I used wine as in the original recipe, and wow.  We had dinner for ten, and 4 were from the UK and they said this stew was really authentic (and delicious).  One hinted strongly for a doggie bag, so I gave him some leftovers!)  I added 2 small packages of whole pearl mushrooms. Button mushrooms would also work -- again, I would add them whole. My butcher did not have shoulder, so he cut cubes from a boneless leg, worked great.  I used slightly less meat, slightly more veggies, and just over half the bacon.  Awesome!

This stew has amazing flavor but for some reason it turned out really greasy.  I followed the recipe exactly and I'm not sure where I went wrong.  Other that, it was delicious and I will definetely try making again.

An excellent recipe but I'm always surprised when a "beef" stock is included in a lamb recipe. Substitute a lamb stock or no stock at all for a more authentic and better tasting experience.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used 2 lbs. each of beef and lamb stew meat.  I also added a bottle of Guinness and doubled the amount of potatoes.  I let the stew sit in the refrigerator over-night and added another cup of beef broth when re-heating.  It was a big hit!

I cut the amounts way down since lamb is expensive and there are only 2 of us. I increased the proportion of potato and carrot, and added peas. I didn't have thyme so used rosemary like others suggested which worked out great. I highly suggest making this in a slow cooker. You don't need to brown the lamb first which cuts the grease content dramatically. I made it in a pot at first, but the meat just would not tenderise, so transferred it into a slow cooker afterward. Next time I'll save the hassle and just slow cook it from the start. An excellent, flavourful stew.

First off, let me say that the only change that I made to this, was that I subsituted beer for the wine. No other changes were necessary. Wow, this is delicious! I made this for a St. Patrick's Day potluck at work. Well, not much of it made in for my co-workers. My skeptical family LOVED it. After a huge BBQ dinner, they decided that they wanted to "taste" it. 2 bowls (each) later, they were begging for more. I had to hide it in order for any of it to make it in to work! I recommend this to all! It defeinitely deserves a 5 star rating!

My family has begun a tradition of International Christmas Eve.  We Have done Germany, Poland and this year, Ireland.  We chose this Irish Lamb Stew as our main course.  WOW!  It was absolutely wonderful.  The lamb shoulder was the perfect choice as it has a more mild, less gamey flavor.  If possible, I'd ask the butcher to cut off as much fat as possible.  I chose to add approximately 3 pounds of potatoes to this as many Lamb Stew recipes have more equivalent to that.  I loved the wine flavoring.  I paired this with a homemade Irish soda bread.  It was a hit.  Thank you for your great recipe!

I have to say that 20mins prep time is only possible if you have 20 helpers in the kitchen! Give it 40mins perhaps 8 ) I omitted the alcohol. Will see how it taste like tomorrow!

I made this for St. Patrick's Day 2 years ago. Ever since then, my husband wants me to make it for every special occasion. Not to mention the guests we had over for the meal have repeatedly told me that this is the BEST meal they have ever eaten. To sum it up, it's a big hit. One change I made was to use beer instead of wine.

Absolutely great flavor! And a nice consistency too! I added all of the vegetables when I added the stock to the lamb mixture and it turned out fine. One warning for those buying frozen bone-in lamb stew meat): major sharp, bone shards. I had to hand pick through my kids' stew to make sure they weren't going to stab themselves. Next time I will have to buy a boneless leg or shoulder (supermarket didn't have when I went looking) and cut it myself. Lesson learned! Great recipe!

Sounds pretty good as it is  - but - for a traditional Irish lamb stew, drop the wine but add a handfull of pearl barley.  This latter ingredient really "makes" it.

This was very good.  I WISH I had made it 2 days in advance, as the flavor gets even better.  We used beef stew meat because it was cheaper and 6 lbs is a LOT.  You can use as little as 3 and be fine.  Also, we didn't care for the bacon as the texture was a little distracting.  And if it looks like there's not enough liquid, resist the urge to dilute.  That was a mistake I made.  But it's very good!  Great with a hunk of bread.

Very yummy! I used only 1/2 lbs of bacon and 3lbs of lamb and more veggies. I also used Guinness instead of the wine. Everyone loved it!

Extremely labor intensive, in my opinion, but definitely DEFINETLY worth it.  It was fantastic and perfectly rediculously fattening, but it's great for a once or twice a year treat.

Wow -- delicious!  I modified slightly -- substituted a bottle of Guinness Extra Stout for the wine, decreased meat to 4 lbs., used only 1 lb. of bacon, and doubled the carrots and potatoes.  I could not find boneless lamb shoulder, so bought 7 lbs. of bone-in, then trimmed the meat off the bone and also trimmed off the fat.  Let the stew simmer for an extra hour on low heat, then thickende with 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch.  Came out great!  Nice  consistency.  The lamb was melt-in-your-mouth tender -- I will definitely stick with the shoulder meat. The veggies softened but still held their shape well.  A definite winner!

There is no doubt about it, the meat is definitely tender, but the delicate flavor of the lamb is completely lost in the bacon - and I took the recommendation of another reviewer to use less.  In a blind test, my husband couldn't tell what meat was in the dish.  
It's probably an excellent recipe for those who used beef as the base.
I will not use this recipe again. Sorry.

I used beef instead of lamb (noone in my family eats lamb, not even my dog!) but otherwise cooked the recipe as stated....very yummy. It was in fact, the best stew I have ever eaten! Served it w/ Irish soda bread I (from this site) & the bread accompanied the stew much like a sweet cornbread. It made a perfect St. Patrick's day dinner...thanks!

I made this over the weekend--needed something hearty to stick to our ribs during the New England winter.  WOW, simply fantastic!  Followed the recipe to a T with the exception of the cut of lamb.  I couldn't find a boneless shoulder so I opted for the boneless butterfly-cut leg of lamb.  Worked out great.  Just as good as a leftover.  I highly recommend giving this one a try!

This turned out exactly the way I hoped it would. Stews should be simple ingredients and easy prep with big taste payoff. Here it is! I ended up without quite enough lamb and had to add a bit of stewing beef but it didn't take away from the flavour at all. WONDERFUL!!!

Seeing that this recipe served 10, I halved for my family....I won't do that again...they all wanted more! I substituted beer (Killians) for the wine, and left out the second addition of onions (kids won't touch if they see onions).  A delicious stew! Definitely a keeper.  Very good with Irish soda bread.

This was a great recipe.  I only had a few pounds of lamb, but with the help of allrecipes I was able to modify.  Proportionately it was the same recipe.  I would've given it 5 stars, but I did make a slight change and that was to substitute the wine with diluted white vinegar. Also, I made the mistake of pouring garlic/onion mixture and the liquid into the stew. Hindsight is 20/20 but wished the recipe said to leave liquid behind.  After refrigeration I skimmed off the fat and all was fine. Like a few others mentioned about the potatoes and what form they should be in going into the stew (diced, bite-sized, quartered, etc), I made them bite-sized to go along with the rest of the recipe.

Awesome recipe and will use again.

This recipe is outrageously delicious!  I used red wine instead of white and I omitted the sugar.  Also, because it was so soupy, I made a faux roux with some flour and a little of the broth (no butter) to thicken things up, and that worked very well.  I should also mention that I slow cooked the lamb first and then crisped it up in a dry skillet (that helped me to cut back a little on the crazy amount of fat in the recipe).  I used about one pound of bacon when I doubled the recipe.  I will definitely make this one again and again.  Thanks so much, Danny!

Amazing! I used Guinness instead of white wine. Entirely worth the effort. Next time I'll try putting it in a slow cooker as others have recommended.

Always thought I hated stew....I now stand corrected we made this for St Paddy's Day with boneless leg of lamb cubed cooked it early in the day let it cool then warmed it up later with the veggies. My husband who's Gparent were Irish said his eyes were smiling!
only additions we made were sprig of rosemary and fresh thyme will make this again next March 17th

Good St. Paddy's day dinner.  Added a McCormick beef stew powdered mix,  barley and left out the bacon. Adjusted everything for 1-1/2 lbs cubed lamb.   Cooked for about 7 hours in a covered large cast iron covered pot (Lodge).

Was very tender and I served it with Irish Soda Bread and a good red wine (already had my 3 guinness's)

This is one of the best stews I have ever tasted.  Great flavors, and it is best prepared the day before.  I have served it at several dinner parties and it is always a wonderful hit.

Very tasty.  I halved the recipe and used Guinness as well and then tossed everything in a crock pot for 6 hours.  The first 3 hours on high and then switched it to low.    Also added a few stalks of celery chopped up, and maple syrup instead of sugar, just for fun.  It was very tasty with the irish soda bread to clean the bowl.

Awsome stew!! I fed this to a few friends on St patricks day this year and now its all they ever want when we have pot lucks. I almost wish it it didn't go over so well lamb gets expensive when your buying it all the time! I did add slightly more wine then the recipie calls for 1 and 1/3 cups of Cabet pini Grigio

This stew is outstanding! It takes a lot of time to cut up everything, but it is well worth the work. I took great care in trimming the fat from the lamb, and there was no visible fat on the stew after it chilled. Our neighborhood restaurant makes their stew using sour cream, so the next day, for the remaining half of the original stew recipe, I beat 12 oz. of sour cream with 1/2 cup of flour, then added about 3 cups of the warmed stew to that mixture and beat it well to mix thoroughly, then added that back to the remaining pot of stew. I let it boil for 5 minutes, and it was a superb twist, with a little more zip, as the flavor had mellowed from the original recipe day earlier. Thank you, Danny O'Flaugherty for a fantastic recipe!!

I won an Irish Stew cook-off with this recipe.  I did add celery and guniess (28oz) instead of wine, and I doubled everything but the meat.  Also only did about 1/2 the onion, it just seemed like it would be too much otherwise. Lamb was REALLY expensive. I'll have to try another meat the next time I make it.

This stew was awesome, and even better the day after. I used a 14 quart stockpot, which was just about right for 10 servings. Butcher didn't have boneless lamb shoulder so I had to carve out the bones myself (and it was still pretty expensive). I modified the recipe slightly by adding flour to thicken up the stew near the end.

Absolutely awesome stew.  I made a large pot for St. Patty's Day and I had no leftovers.  My friends went back for 2 and 3 bowls of it over the course of the night.  I made it the day before on the stovetop, then transferred it to my slow cooker to refrigerate overnight. I taste tested it before I put it away and it was great.    The next day all I had to do was put it on low for a few hours and my friends and family could just help themselves once it was up to temperature.  I swear it tasted a million times better after staying in the fridge overnight!

Superb. I made some alterations: I used only one pound of lamb stew meat, purely due to cost considerations, however this was plenty of meat for me. My husband would have liked a little more, but I think six pounds seems like a lot. I used 3/4 pound of bison bacon (don't eat pork) and since bison is so much leaner than pork, a small amount of olive oil for the frying. Instead of wine I poured two bottles of stout in with the broth early on to simmer. Tasting a small bit of the final result right off of the stove left me questioning if it would live up to the reviews. We were somehow able to wait until the next night to have it for dinner and it was fantastic! We had it throughout the week and it got better and better, the meat broke up into the broth and the flavors melded into an amazing dish. We will make this again and again.

Two things that never came from Ireland.
Green beer.
Corned Beef and Cabbage.
The Lamb Stew is great and very authentic.
Also, "Patty" is short for Patricia and "Paddy" is short for Patrick.
Happy St.Patricks Day to all.

This was good, i made this in my croc pot. just threw everything in at once and cooked on high for 5 hours.  I omitted the wine (didn't have any) and reduced water to to 3/4 what was required (croc pot cooking requires less liquids).  Served over rice.

The only change I make is to add beer - cause we like that flavor in lamb stews.  We subsituted the wine and water for dark stout.  We have occasionally used beef instead of lamb - just be sure to tenderize it.  This really is a wonderfully well-done recipe.

This was the best stew I have ever made!  I absolutely loved it.  I did add more veggies ( mushrooms, peas, green beans) and less meat, 3.5 lbs instead of 6.  6lbs of meat is just tooo much for me.  Anyway, I would recomend this recipe to everyone!

This recipe reminded us of the stew we had in pubs in Ireland - very rich (complex taste), fragrant and delicious! I cut the amount of lamb in half and only used one pound of bacon, but everything else was the same.

I couldn't find a lamb shoulder at my local grocery store, so ended up using a leg of lamb cut into stew meat instead.  Leg of lamb, being a tender cut, is not recommended for stew.  The good news is that, despite that, this stew turned out wonderfully and got two rave reviews from the lamb-loving Aussies at dinner that evening.

Otherwise I deviated only slightly from the recipe.  I used my crock pot (five hours on high) and added additional potatoes (six medium-sized).  It turned out wonderfully!  I can only imagine it would be even better if I'd had a cut of meat more suited to slow, wet cooking.

This recipe was wonderful.  Begin on a low carb diet, I used Atkins Bake mix instead of flour.  I did add the potatoes but did not eat them although my family did. We all loved the dish.

This stew was soooo good! It came out so tender that my 11 month old daughter could eat it without molars and without me having to cut everything into smaller pieces. It just dissolves in your mouth. 
I have to admit that I used about half the amount of bacon in this recipe.

It tasted good, but it was very heavy.  Next time I think I'll cut down on the bacon a lot...1.5 lbs was too much for me & made it a bit greasy.  Also, next time I'll try olive oil for sauteing.  It's definately worth another try though!  The lamb was very tender.

This is a great recipe.  I used beef instead of lamb and it was still great.

a great dish - since there are only two of us, I halved the recipe, and still froze enough for another meal.  Did
refrigerate overnight and was able to skin any fat off the next day.
All around one of the best!

Basically stuck to the original, but made it in slow cooker, much like Tracy Cook.  But I did brown the lamb as I wanted the taste of the fond. And I added Rosemary, some Kitchen Bouquet, and a dollop of Worcestershire Sauce to the ingredients.
The gravy was a little loose so I made a beurre manie which tightened it up just fine.  I cooked it on low for nine hours.  The meat melted in my mouth! You could taste the lamb, which I love anyway, but the flavor of lamb was subtle and delicious.  Best stew I have ever made, and I will make it again and again!

Just made this...with a few tweaks. Very good Sunday dinner for snowy NH. I halved the recipe and it was perfect for 6-7qt crock pot. I prepped it Saturday night; cooked the bacon and browned the meat ( coated in flour with salt,pepper,and some Old Bay Seasoning) in bacon grease as instructed, followed by onion and garlic as instructed. Placed meats and veggies (added some fresh green beans for color) in crockpot & gently mixed. Deglazed pot with  1 & 1/2 cup Stout beer, then added the beef broth and 3 ounces tomato paste. Stirred till well mixed added sugar & salt, then poured into crock pot. Added 2 bay leaves & the Thyme. Covered tightly in Saran wrap and put in frig. At 9am I placed in crock base and cooked on low 8hrs. Thickened sauce with some corn starch last 20min of cooking. Absolutely amazing taste and meat is fall apart tender. Paired well with homemade buttermilk biscuits. Look for my attached pic

My partner is a Buddhist so I substituted chicken broth for the beef broth. Added a tablespoon of wosteshire  sauce.  It was better than I expected. This is one of my favorite dishes.

This was/is really delicious. The following substitutions were made. Costco leg of lamb instead of shoulder. Rice flour instead of wheat flour and increased amount by 1/4 cup. Rich chicken stock instead of beef stock. Purple sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes. Red wine instead of white. Addedd a pound of mushrooms. Simmered for 55 minutes at end instead of 20. Added more salt and pepper at end of cooking.

We actually had an overcast day here in So Calif. This was the perfect meal with potato rolls. I also modified this with a stick of celery, four small potatoes, chardonnay, precooked bacon which I had rendered the fat off already. Although the beer instead of wine sounded good, Im not a beer person and preferred the wine taste. The recipe was easy. A novice would realize that carrots and potatoes take longer. I'd hope so anyway. Good tasting stew! Next time I may use parsnips. and chayote.

The flavor is excellent. The meat comes out tender and delicious (it is worth taking the time to brown the lamb before adding it to the stew!). My gripe with this recipe is that the directions are VERY unclear and hard to follow. Also, following them as written is a bit dangerous. If you drop the lamb directly into the bacon grease while it is over the hot eye, you will get bad burns from hot grease flying all over the place. Trust me on that. I agree with other reviewers that the potatoes and carrots need to be added sooner to get tender and really soak up the stew flavor. Like many reviewers, I cut way back on the meat. The listed amounts seemed both excessive and expensive. It came out fine with 12oz of bacon and 2.5lbs of lamb leg. I used the listed amounts of all other ingredients.

My husband made this and it was terrific. He did include some substitutions. He used red wine, red pearl onions, lardons (pancetta) instead of bacon and added parsnips and peas. The rest was the same and it was very nicely seasoned. Didn't add anything after I tasted it.

I loved this and will make it again. I had leftover leg of lamb and made it in my dutch oven. I followed the recipe, except added the carrots after the broth and meats have been simmering for about 30 minutes. I also drained most of the bacon grease off. I also didn't have any wine, but still tasted great.

Love Love Love this recipe!  It was the best lamb stew ever!! I followed the directions exactly expect I switch out the white wine for apple juice.  Prep time is longer than 20 minutes and so worth the little extra time.  Step four took 30 mins instead of 20...what's 10 more minutes for an awesome meal!  Served it with a loaf of crusty bread and Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad (also from this website).

First time I bought lamb...on sale for $3.99 lb. I halved this recipe for all ingredients except meat: only used 1.5 pounds of lamb.  Used a whole pound of bacon and it was delicious!  Next day even better! I put in my crockpot on low for about 8 hours after browning the meat. My kids scarfed it up and asked for more so we are making again today.  I substituted oat flour for the wheat because we don't eat wheat, and omitted the wine.  Today I will use 2 lbs of lamb with 1 lb of bacon and keep all other ingredients the same...adding a few cups of celery and a little more garlic because we love garlic.

My room mates and I loved this recipe! Bacon in a stew? Wtf!? amazing! It served 8 of us in a night and there was plenty left over. We added a pound of extra bacon for good measure. It was very hearty. It could have been thicker I must admit, so some extra flour or potatoes would work just dandy!

This was the best stew I have ever had.  Beautiful! I had to modify it for cooking in the crock pot but kept the ingredients pretty much the same, although modified for 6 servings instead of 10.  I fried up the bacon and browned the lamb before putting it in the crockpot.  Half an hour before serving I could see it needed thickening up I removed two cups of the liquid and melted 60 grams of butter, added 1/4 cup of flour and cooked for a minute before slowly adding the two cups of liquid.  Once this was smooth I added it back into the stew and it worked a treat.  This was a seriously delicious meal that will be added to the family recipe book.  I did put some leftover in the fridge to see if it really does get better with age (hard to believe!).

I am making this for my boyfriend's birthday tomorrow. When he was over in Ireland,he had a lamb stew that he LOVED. I figured what great way to celebrate by bringing Ireland to our dining room. I do have a few complaints. First, I was unable to get shoulder. I had to get the leg of lamb and it was a pain to prep (and it cost me $65 for 6lbs). Second, the prep time needs to be elevated. It took me about an hour to get the lamb cut, the bacon browned and everything together. I had a bite of it though and I will say, it's pretty good so far.

Good recipe, except you can dispense with the bacon.  Added basil and rosemary and juice of 1 lemon.  Used red wine vinegar instead of white wine.  Unless you want a gamey dish, I suggest you marinate lamb using marinade mix and lots of garlic the night before.

FREAKIN AWESOME!!
I halved the recipe, and used a few extra cups of water and broth to keep it from boiling down to nothing and so that the veggies would have some liquid to soften in... :P 
but apart from that, ABSOLUTE GOLD!!!
make sure to use BONELESS lamb shoulder (as suggested) for eating ease. :)

I pulled together a variation on this recipe from others on this site, trying to recreate a dish my Irish mother made often when I was a child.  Unfortunately for our family, our mother was a wonderful cook, but did not write down any recipes for later generations.  Rating this as best I can on the ingredients and methods I used, I'm giving 4 stars.  Thanks for the recipe!  I didn't quite get the same flavour/texture of mom's recipe, but I came close.  Trying again someday.

I had corned beef in the crock pot, so I had to take the old-fashioned stovetop aproach. The ingredients for this dish are a little off. I can't imagine trying to get all of these ingredients into one pot for stew. I was fine with one pound of bacon, 2 lbs of lamb stew meat, 3 carrots, 2 onions (instead of 3), and 2 potatoes. The stew was a little watery, so I wound up taking out some of the liquid, whisking in about a tablespoon of cornstarch, and that did the trick. Of course, the recipe cooked longer than expected to soften the potatoes and carrots. I also added 1 tsp garlic powder to the flour, because I'm accustomed to doing that for all my stews.  This was tasty, but it takes a few tweaks to get it right.

Ohmygod, this stew is fantastic! I'm gonna have leftovers for days :D the prep time is definitely way off, expect at least an hour for bacon to cook and browning the lamb. Couldn't find beef stock at the store so I substituted with beef broth instead, tasted great!

Absolutely phenominal. The only change I made was using cream sherry since I forgot I was out of regular white wine. A keeper, the boyfriend is already asking when I'll make it again.

Absolutely wonderful stew! Delicious the first day but even better the second. I used a boneless roast and it was perfect, I wouldn't change a thing! Thanks for a recipe I will use again and again!

This was absolutely delicious!  I made it the night before and it came out perfectly!  I only used 3 lbs of lamb and 1 lb of bacon and that was plenty.  I didn't have too much trouble with the "stew juice" being too thin, but if you want it really thick like a gravy you'd need to make that change.  I did throw in an extra potato too.  For next time, I would use 5 potatos and a couple stalks of celery.  This won't be a very regular meal as lamb is VERY expensive, but I will look forward to it when I do make it again!!!  Thanks Danny!

Made this for a St. Patrick's party and it was a HUGE hit!  Like some of the other reviewers, I did swap out the wine for an equal amount of Guinness and was very pleased with the taste.  Also, I made this the day before, and then reheated it in the oven at 300 degrees for about an hour and a half before I served it.  Really, just fantastic - will definitely make again!

Prep time needs to be listed longer than 20 minutes~!  My time spent between the bacon and browing all the meat was at least an hour.   I haven't gotten the stew finished yet.  Still simmering but it smells wonderful.  I will take the advice and put the veggies in way more than 20 minutes ahead of time so they will be tender.  I am an experienced cook but I have to say that prep time has taken   I didn't have boneless shoulder but got some sholder chops and had some lamb stew meat so we shall see (I'll be back when it's done!)  I even flowered and browned the bones from the sholder as anything simmered with bones gets a wonderful flavor.  Now I hope I find the bones before dear hubby bites into one by mistake :~)  I'm not using the wine.  Don't like wine and don't want that taste in the stew so that's the only change I will make.  More later!

Great Recipe! I followed it pretty closely.  Only made the following changes.  Used 4 1/2 lbs of lamb (b/c it's all I had on hand) deglazed using an additional 1/2 cup of white wine, I used a chardonay. Left out the potatoes and subbed more carrots and onions because I was serving this on top of colcannon. And I didn't have thyme so I threw in some sage instead.  It was delicious! My husband that doesn't like lamb even loved it.  Uploading picture soon. The changes I made were out of necessity, because we don't live close to a store so I'm sure it is delicious the way that the recipe is written also!

I have to say that I usually am a fan of a thicker more heavy beef broth based stew, but this was really great!  The lamb was melting in your mouth and the extra broth was excellent with a crusty bread to soak it up.  I bought a better quality smoked bacon and added leeks in with the vegetables, but will definetely make this again.  I also added the veggies earlier and threw in some mushrooms in the last half hour.  I did, however, find it to be more oily on top than I would like, so after refrigeration, I took most of the fat off the top.  It re-heated even better the next day.

Absolutely fabulous! Couldn't get any good looking lamb other than lamb chops, so I substituted beef stew meat. Turned out so great! I also used 1/2 cup of Guiness instead of water and left out the sugar all together (I forgot it). So good! I served this up with the Irresistible Irish Soda Bread  from this site. Made for a delicious St. Patty's Day! Thanks so much!

I just moved to Paris with my husband but we enjoy celebrating St. Patrick's Day so I thought, why not make a true Irish Stew?  And this recipe appeared and so I just had to make it.  I can only say that I've never had lamb as good as what I bought from the boucherie here in Paris - the lamb even days later just MELTS in your mouth.  I ended up 1/2-ing the recipe because frankly, between two people there was more than enough even for two nights leftovers, and we don't have a massive pot here in Paris.  Ended up posting this recipe to FB because it was too good not to share.   Heavenly!

This was good, but with some modifications I think it would be 5-stars.  I would use less lamb, just because it is so expensive.  I would also use half the Onions/carrots/potatoes called for (I had to use less by default, I couldn't fit it all in my crockpot!).  Maybe even just use one onion instead of three (it was a little overpowering with 3 onions).  To make it healthier, I would probably forgo the bacon next time, too.

This was really good! I've had this before in a resturant that I waitressed at, and their stew had a much thicker consistency...almost a gravy. I was disappointed it didn't turn out like that, but it was still really good! Next time maybe I'll try adding a packet of gravy to the mix and see how it comes out!

Wonderful!  I was fortunate to get local domestic lamb which is superb!  I didn't make any changes and I'll have to say it turned out even better than I expected.  It was even better the next day.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This was okay, I didn't particularly like it just because it was too sweet for my liking. I also had to add a bunch of things to get the taste right...my family liked it though! Good recipe if you have lamb to get rid of, but I probably wont make this again

Very good!  I used the recommended Guinness (plain, not extra stout) and it turned out great.  My family wasn't as keen on the lamb flavor , so next time I'll try it with beef.

My family thought this was excellent stew.  I altered it a bit and made it in a slow cooker over 8 hours on low, I added the potatoes after 4 hours of cooking (because they get really mushy the full time) and added the flour at the end to thicken it.  Mmmm, I will definitely make this again.

Made this for St. Pat's day, not a morsel left. I also cooked lamb evening before in crock pot( 7 hours) with onions,garlic, a bottle of beer and beef broth. The next day added all else. A dollop of sour cream and chopped mint is good to serve it with. Yummy

Very good.  I cut back on the bacon, as I didn't want it to over power the lamb.  I'm glad I did.  I used lamb shoulder with the bone in (all I could find), and only used about 3# of it.  That was plenty for us. I browned the meat and then threw it in with the bone into the crock pot.  When the stew was about done, I removed the meat and pulled it off the bone.  it fell apart into pieces as I did so. I also added some beer to the crock pot, as suggested.  A good, hearty stew with a subtle, tasty lamb flavor. Not something I'd make a lot, but when you want this taste, it's a great recipe.

Fool Proof!!  I made this for St Patrick's day.  I screwed it up.. i halved the recipe but instead of putting in a 1/2 cup of Guinness (in place of the wine) i put in the WHOLE bottle.  I cooked it a bit longer with the top off and it boiled down.  OMG does this taste fantastic.  My 5 year old LOVES this.

We thought this was delicious!  I also substituted a can of Guinness in place of the wine - use only one can, not two!  Two cans is too much!  But one can really gives it a nice flavor, I did mine in a crock pot and the house smelled amazing!  This was great to make ahead of time - I cut the carrots and onion the first night, added the meat and potatoes the second night and then cooked on the 3rd day - a definite time saver and so easy to pull off!

Very good overall. Instead of water, I deglazed the pan with Guinness. I also thickened the sauce with a "beurre manier" (flour mixed with butter).

Best lamb stew I've ever had!  Lamb stew is one of my favorite dishes but I had never made it myself because I thought I'd never be able to match the great stews I've had in the past.  Well, I tried this recipe and I'll definitely, and with confidence, be making it again!  Only changes I made was using turkey bacon instead of beef and in a smaller amount than recommended for the bacon, I used fresh thyme and a thinly sliced celery stalk, added a bottle of Guinness stout beer (as another reviewer had recommended), and stirred in fresh parsley at the end.  The stew was truly superb, I can't believe I'm saying this about my own cooking but I don't think a fine restaurant can do better than I did with this one!!! The only thing I might change next time is the amount of lamb--I was making four servings and two-and-a-half pounds was a bit too much meat for us, but that of course is a matter of preference.  Next time I make four servings I'll probably just use a pound or so of the lamb.

Absolutely wonderful! I made this for my English in-laws who thought it was the best they've ever had! Full of flavor, and worth the effort.

Wonderful! Used 1/2 the bacon and all the lamb, added a few more potatoes, fresh rosemary, celery, peas. No left overs to be found!

My 7 year-old son said, "Mom, please give this 100 stars!"  He then added, "Big, fat stars!"  He spoke for the entire family.  We loved this!  My only changes were to deglaze with the wine, I added garlic to the pan with the onion, and I combined everything in the crock pot.  Oh, and I added Rosemary.  It cooked on low all day and smelled fantastic.  I served it with homemade Rosemary bread.  Awesome meal!

This was absolutely great! I made a few changes based on others reviews. I cut the lamb in half and added more veggies. I also used red wine in place of the water and white wine. Everyone loved it despite the fact that none of us has really cared much for lamb. My brothers son tried it and really liked it. He is a very picky eater (we told him it was beef stew until he finished it hehe). I would recommend this recipe to absolutely everyone!!

This was a great recipe.  I changed a couple of things - I used lamb and beef and deglazed the pan with red wine then used Irish stout instead of the white wine.  It was super tasty!

I made this with beef instead of lamb because lamb was too expensive.  The beef turned out so tender that no knives were required.  I made it the night before, refrigerated it and then skimmed the congealed fat off the top before reheating.  Added a generous amount of salt and pepper and some extra thyme, and got rave reviews!

I love this recipe! My husband said it was the best meal I have ever made. This was fantastic. I did steps one and two as directed, but then I threw everything else in the crockpot together. If you do make this a crock pot recipe, be sure to put the potatoes, carrots, and and onion on the bottom and don't use ground thyme.

Excellent stew.  I use half the lamb and a little less bacon, a little more wine and more potatoes, and add peas.  I've made this several times--it's one of our favorites.

Prepared this along with two other recipes from this site for our St.Patties day dinner. It was great! I made it the day before and reheated it for the dinner. Saved lots of time doing it that way and it was even better as stated in the recipe.

I'm a terrible cook, so when I tried my first bite of this stew, I was estatic.  It was my first time making lamb, but more than that, I'd made something that sounds complex, without spoiling it!  

I've already shared this recipe with friends, and look forward to making it again! (By the way, the prep time is not quit accurate.  Granted I'm very slow at prepping food, but allow yourself more than the stated 20+ minutes)!

This was so delicious! I left out the carrots and added whole brown mushrooms, whole fresh green beans, and a few grape tomatos. I made mine in a crockpot. Everyone in my family loved this & I'll definitely be making it again.

This is fantastic.  I don't care for bacon, but I did use bacon grease to brown the lamb, and omitted the bacon itself.  I also had to simmer quite a bit longer than the recipe called for (about 3 1/2 hours) to soften the potato and carrot, and I did add quite a bit more beef broth to the stew, as well as using broth to deglaze the pan.  I didn't add water at all.  The end result was delicious, the lamb tender, and the flavors very savory.  A great comfort dish.  I won't make this often (holy cow, check out the fat!!!) but it will be a treat.

I've never made bacon or red meat before, let alone a stew. At first the smell put me off, and I wasn't sure how I'd like it. However, after adding the wine (I used a Riesling), I decided it was okay. I served it with baguettes and Guinness or red wine. Very tasty, deifintely a keeper!

This guy almost has it right.  Substitute a cup of beer for the wine.  Any substitutions for the Lamb, and it isn't Irish stew.

This was beyond excellent.  I wanted something a little different for St. Patrick's Day.  I followed the recipe exactly. I did lose a little of the lamb when it was removed to pull from bones (lose as in someone snatched it before I caught them red handed). 

This is so going into rotation.  As a matter of fact, I had requests for the recipe and to do a repeat meal SOON!  I can't recommend this one enough.  

MAJOR KEEPER and my first five star rating. I think I love Chef John!

Honestly... I was skeptical, this recipe was lacking elements I expected in lamb stew and I found the bacon and sugar odd. But it is amazing!!! I really wasn't even very pleased with the aroma mid way through, but it's very easy for a stew and again such a lovely savory sweet flavor. I misunderstood the onion I sautéed two with the garlic and I also didn't have whit wine so I used Marsala but it worked out nicely. Can't wait for my family to try it

Excellent recipe, my girlfriend's Colorado home-raised lamb enhanced the taste/experience and I cooked everything in a large pot (you might need a bit more oil when sautéing  onions/garlic, bacon grease is quickly absorbed by flour in meat) until the beginning of step 4 - and then I put everything (including celery,  enhances flavor/extra beef broth) into a crock pot and cooked on low for 8-10 hours.  Next time will try Guiness Stout beer instead of wine; best to let it set overnight in the frig before reheating and serving as suggested...

This recipe was wonderful. I used the website to fraction the stew into 3 servings and there are still plenty of left overs for myself, my husband and my son. I did boil the potatoes, onions and carrots desperately because they do not get soft while simmering in the stew for 20 minutes. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as instructed (for 3 servings) and it was absolutely amazing. My boys loved it and can't stop talking about it. I paired it with some home made Irish soda bread and it was a meal made in heaven. Great recipe! It is a St. Patrick's day tradition in our Irish home!!!!

Wow! Delicious!  I substituted beef for lamb and added 3/4 cup Guinness instead of white wine.  My whole family loved it! This recipe will be in our new meal rotation.

I made this a couple of nights ago. My wife's first comment was, "I'm going to have to give you recipes so I know what you're cooking." Then she took a small helping saying, "I'm not hungry." But she had seconds!

The only change I made was to substitute parsnips for half the carrots.

This stew is awesome!  I did switch the wine with Guinness and a added a lot of pepper.  I served it in bread bowls for a little dinner party and it was a big hit!

I halved the recipe...it was perfectly delicious.  One substitution -- instead of white wine I used a non-alcoholic rose cooking wine.  Still fantastic.

I had a couple of lamb shoulder chops leftover from another night's dinner and decided to make this recipe work with Already cooked lamb.  I made the bacon and used the fat to make a roux then added the cooked lamb that I had cut into bite sized pieces along with the vegetables.  I let it simmer for about 45 minutes which was perfect for the vegetables to cook through and still have a bit of  crunch to them.  I also added in a beer because I really like that flavor profile for an Irish Stew.   AMAZING!     *****UPDATE****  Today, March 19th,  2017  We are eating this AWESOME stew.   This time, I made it as written, with only one exception.  Instead of wine, I used a bottle of Killian's Red beer.  I  ALSO allowed it to sit overnight after making it and, I can tell you, it was incredible.  Try this recipe!  It's a keeper!

This dish is delicious! I had some lamb and I wanted to make something different. I made some changes tho it turned great.
I substituted bacon with turkey bacon, because we don't eat pork and I didn't add wine or beer either because we don't drink alcohol. I added some green beens to for the color and for greens.. And because we were really hungry I minimized the simmering time for 40 minutes then I added the vegetables for 20. The meat was soft and tender, I'm sure if I went all the way it will be better.  Yet it was really delicious.

2nd time I have made this. 1st part of recipe I placed in crock pot over night, let sit in fridge to bring the fat up, removed as much as I could than placed on stove added the vegetables, AND on advise from one of the reviewers used a guinness extra stout beer.  This is my go to lamb stew. The lamb I used, bought a whole lamb and had it butchered and wrapped at local meat processing plant. Used the lamb stew meat.  Love the recipe.

LOVED IT, but the prep time is a bit longer, the act of browning lamb in bacon fat is like sex:), my kitchen smelled unbelievable. I think you will all enjoy. It's a great meal to cook on a rainy Saturday.

OMG - I cook a lot and was looking for something different to make with St. Patrick's Day in mind.  This recipe is really great and made the house smell wonderful.  Both hubby and I give it 5 stars.  It does take longer than 20 minutes for prep...more like 45 mins., but well worth it!  Super market didn't have boneless shoulder so I purchased bone-in lamb shoulder pieces for stew, cut off most of the fat then chopped meat into bite-sized pieces also using a few bones with stubborn meat on it.  It added extra flavor and whatever's left on the bone easily pulled off and got tossed back in the pot before serving.  Used beer to deglaze pan after cooking onions and garlic instead of water.  After initial 1-1/2 hours, I cooked for 45 minutes after adding veggies and used Guiness beer instead of wine.  Since it was just two of us, I halved the recipe and it worked out fine.  Serve with a hearty bread!  (We had some marble rye-yum!)  Slainte, Danny O'Flaugherty!

Great recipe. I cooked the whole dish in a 5qt dutch oven. Could only find two packages of shoulder chops and one package of loin chops at the store, adding up to slightly three pounds. Therefore, I also halved the recipe. I trimmed all the meat from the bone and cut to bite size pieces. I used only a half-pound of bacon, and so, had to add a quarter cup of olive oil to finish browning/burning the meat cubes. For simmering, I added about three-quarters of a cup of water. During the simmering of the meat, I put the largest bones in the pot with the meat and then picked them out before adding the vegetables, Guiness, thyme and bay leaf. This meal trumped our usual corned beef St.Patricks meal.

I would change a lot of things here. I don't cook with sugar, and that sweet taste in the stew is unbearable for me. It tastes more sweet than salty. I was horrified by the bacon fat. I would definetely make this again, but I will not add the sugar, I will use olive oil instead of bacon fat, I will remove the bacon all together, and use less flour if not any. I guess it will no longer be an Irish stew.

I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but this is really good.  I followed TRACYCOOK's slow cooker method and it was great!  I also cut the recipe in half for our family of four.  I did sear the lamb and cook the bacon beforehand as well.  Meat just doesn't ever taste as flavorful when I throw it in the crockpot raw, no matter HOW long it cooks.  Next time I'll add the carrots and potatoes in later, maybe around hour 6.  They're just too mushy, and since I used purple potatoes, the color came right out of them, which means all those good antioxidants were sucked out from overcooking.  Also added flour at the end, stirred in and cooked on high for about 30 minutes for it to thicken and it made a big difference.  Looking forward to grabbing some bread for bread bowls and having this for dinner tonight.  Overall a good recipe to have on-hand when we get all that lamb from our CSA meat share!  May add Guinness next time instead of white wine as well. Mmmmm beer...

This was pretty good.  I used an emulsion blender to thicken it up a bit-- just put the blender stick in the pot and puree about a quarter or half of the soup to make it more "stewy".  Lamb was nice and tender and it had a good flavor.  It was definitely better as leftovers, so if you have time to make it ahead of time, I'd recommend that.

Great recipe, I make it every year for St. Paddy's day. I scale it down a bit- 3/4lb of bacon and closer to 2-3lbs of lamb. I keep the vegetable and spice quantities the same. Prep time is a  bit longer than 2 minutes, especially if you have to cut the meat, but it is so worth it. I make enough to freeze and eat all year long.

Oh My Goodness!!!! This recipe is awesome!!! Yes it takes some work but so worth it.. I cut the recipe in half and only used a pound of lamb because of the price but it still turned out great. I don't care for the gamier flavor of lamb so I first soaked the meat in coconut milk overnight  ( I am allergic to milk). It Worked!!! They lamb was tender and yummy & no strong flavor. I will be making this again and again!!!

Amazing! Transferred it into a slow cooker and added veggies later. We had dinner guests and, while the slow cooker was filled to the brim with more than enough for everyone, it was nearly licked clean. Oh, and I substituted the beef stew meat we had on hand. I may swap the wine for dark beer this time.

Fabulous! Taste is perfect! Like others, I had to increase time of carrots to cook for 45 minutes, and add potatoes later so they cook about 30 minutes total. I will make this again.

This was a hit! I never would have imagined. It was a little labor-intensive (and expensive with lamb $7/lb), but worth it. I followed the recipe exactly, except I forgot the wine! I also added one parsnip. I didn't even miss the wine; in fact it might have made the gravy a little watery. Served it with Irish soda bread as suggested and the whole pot was devoured at the party where I brought it. I'll definitely keep the recipe, but due to the expense, I won't serve it too often.

I don't like lamb. AT ALL. Not even this recipe could change my mind. But DH loved it and he LIKES lamb, so that's why I'm giving this recipe 5 stars (he really raved). I have since made this with pot roast and was impressed with the flavor.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day party and people raved about it.  It was delicious. My only complaint would be the cost. It was $40 just for the 6 pounds of lamb. I would probably reduce the amount of lamb to 1/3 less to reduce the cost. I think it would still be delicious.

This went over really for St Patrick's Day. I did play with the recipe a bit though. Instead of wine I used Guiness and I didn't take the time to brown the meat because I was making so much I didn't have time. It still turned out fabulously and I'll make it again.

This is absolutely the best Irish Stew recipe I've tried, and I've tried quite a few.  The only changes I made were to cut the recipe in half (wish I hadn't as it was sooo good though) and to use 1 cup of Guinness beer instead of the white wine.  I also did this in the crock pot.  So easy!  I might try to incorporate some pearl barley in there next time as my former favourite recipe uses it.  Now my only problem will be to find a big enough crock.

I'm not a huge fan of red meat stews but this one is pretty decent.  It hides that ever so different, musty lamb taste rather well but I felt so odd adding beef stock to this...since that makes it a beef stew in my opinion...  My kids loved it but I'm sticking to the American-Irish tradition of corn beef & cabbage next year.

I cut the recipe in half, but only used 2 lbs lamb (instead of 3). I could not find boneless lamb shoulder; I had to use bone-in shoulder. I used chopped up pancetta for the bacon, and added some chopped celery.  I followed the recipe exactly (minus the minor changes above), and it turned out great!

Very good stew. Next time I may add more herbs like parsley and rosemary. My teens did not ask for seconds as they usually do when I make beef stew.It could be they didn't care for lamb.

Great base recipe - Here are my modifications:  i rubbed the diced lamb with a mixture of salt & pepper, dried parsley and Herbs de Provence, then dredged in flour.  After browning the lamb in the bacon drippings and sauteeing the onion & garlic mixture, i deglazed the pan briefly with 1/3 cup Cabernet and combined the all of the ingredients in a crock pot. I also replaced half of the water in the beef stock with Guiness, and added 1 diced turnip and 2 diced parsinps.   I simmered the stew in a crock pot for ~6 hrs on low.  Will make again!

Very good.  Didn't have enough beef stock, so threw in some chicken stock to get enough liquid.

I haven't tried this recipe but familiar with ingredients. If you really want to elevate this stew use GOAT meat! Find for a Hispanic market. Buy a 3 lb. leg, and ask to have the meat cut off the bone into large pieces. Cut into 1 1/2" pieces at home. (It will shrink upon cooking)  This is a KILLER stew if you like full flavored meals. And do I need to tell you to add some red pepper flakes? Duh. Hint for future: make a goat curry and you will be transported to another galaxy. The connasewer does not lie.

This was very good. I made a reduced quantity as calculated by the "servings" customizer, so perhaps I didn't have enough liquid for the quantity of food in the stock pot as it seemed to boil out almost completely. Like others, I traded the wine for Guinness, and even at 4 servings I added almost a full can to replenish the liquid. This did add to the flavour, I'm sure.   Heating it the following day (following the advice posted here) turned the stew into ... well, less of a stew and more of a mush. I don't think I'll be waiting a full day again before eating it.   I made pumpernickel buns to use as bread bowls, and the flavour of the dark bread and caraway seed went very well with the stew, so that's a combo I will stick with.   I'm going to wait for cooler weather, and for lamb to be on sale before I make this again, but I will make it again.

Wonderful!  I used leftover Easter lamb, so I didn't have as much, and I just scaled down the rest of the recipe.  Added mint leaves, and the flavor was incredible.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe!  I used left over from Easter lamb.  It was already seasoned, but I still cooked it in the bacon grease for more good flavor.  Then I put it in a crock pot, with mushrooms and carrots and beef stock.  As the day went on I added some wine and then the flour.  I never even added any other seasoning because the flavor was already unbelievable.  I probably could of thickened up a bit more, but we ate it over left over mashed potatoes...I'm telling you this was to die for!  Great basic recipe to work with.  I will be cooking a lot more lamb from now on.  Oh, my daughter says that it was a gift from the gods lol!

Fabulous. Made everything in a stock pot. Didn't see a reason to use the frying pan. Also, only used 4 pounds of meat and 1/4 pound of bacon. More than enough. Also, remember how much salt is in the bacon before adding a bunch to your flour mix. Deglazed with wine. I love the Guiness and mashed potato ideas - I will do that next time.

Great stew.  I double recipe & had enough for 30+.  Used Wolfgang Puck beef stock (only stock store had).  I never flour meat & brown for stew, did this time thinking it would help thicken.  It didn't.  All did was stick to browning pan.  Don't concern yourself with the thickening part.  This is so good you won't care if it isn't real thick.  Forget trying to find boneless shoulder meat.  Grocery store butcher boned, cut off extra fat and cut into stew size portions lamb leg.  Meat is very expensive, $4.49 a lb.  You can't do it everyday but once or twice a year splurge a little.  I put 1 1/2 times potatoes, garlic & onion.  Cut back bacon to 2/3's recipe amount.  Did not put in stout as others had but did de-glaze pan with American burgandy and you have to add the white wine.

This was delicious!  I tossed the lamb in flour before searing it in the pan first.  Then in lieu of water I added 2 cups of vegetable broth and 2 cups of stout.  This was the best stew I ever made!  And I only used one pot!!

Like many reviewers, I also scaled down the lamb. For two people planning on lots of leftovers, I used .8lbs lamb and all the vegetables, broth, etc. for 5 servings. The lamb was tender, the broth rich and delicious, and the vegetables soaked up all the lamb and bacon flavors perfectly. One issue: the bacon got kind of soggy. Next time I might throw it in after the lamb has been simmering for half an hour so that it keeps its shape a bit better.

I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except that I scaled it down added a bottle of Guiness as some other reviewers suggested.  I can see how people might really like this, but the flavor was way too strong for us.  We had to put a dollop of sour cream to take the sharp edges off and my daughter tasted it and actually spit it out and almost started crying.

This recipe was awesome.  I used about 2lbs each of lamb and beef, increased carrots and potatoes as most people suggested.  I also added guinness, rosemary and a few other seasonings to taste.  Thickened it with cornstarch toward the end.  I started cooking at noon, dinner was ready by 6 and it was great.  My dogs did not leave the kitchen for those 6 hours. And every time I went to stir the stew I nearly cried from joy it smelled so good.

I followed the directions but didn't add any sugar and I did it in a crock pot with perfect results. This is a hearty great tasting stew.

Really good recipe. Tweaked it a little by adding a little allspice and substituting red wine instead of white. Also added a dash of hot sauce for a little heat. Turned out great! Recipe is a keeper!

This turned out really oily. I'm not sure if it was because of the lamb or what. My husband really liked it though.

I put in 2 1/2lbs of lamb and kept the veggies at the same level. I actually trimmed some fat off the very meaty bacon I had, and trimmed the fat off the lamb to cut down on the greasiness, which mine was not.  I put in regular beer in instead of guiness, because I did not have any, I cooked it in the crock pot, cut the water by more than half, and it came out a bit bland.  I added more salt, beef bullion and out of deperation to get more flavor I added some cooking sherry and 3 stalks of celery. I thickend it up more at the end.  Amazingly enough it turned out great in spite of my blunders.  Next time I would add 3 1/2lbs. of meat to make it more meaty.  Other than that, I have to remember how I fixed it up to get the same result, because my husband loved it.

I would not change a thing about this recipe. It was excellent!  The 'Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread' is a great accompaniment, and everything is even better the next day.

I rated this already, but wanted to add a tip.  We used our home made beef stock the last time we made this and that just knocked this stew over the top!!  Amazing!!  Taking the time to make your own stock is not only delicious but super, super healthy too.  Again, thanks for this awesome recipe!!!!!

Deeeeliscious! I used 2 pounds of sweet italian gound lamb instead of the shoulder meat, and the flavor of this was out of this world good. My only complaint was that there was so few veggies, and I suppose I would have liked to not been able to feel the grease and fat on my lips after I took a bite. Still, this was ridiculously tasty, and can easily be tweaked to suit your tastes.

This was a good recipe.  I added dumplings to it (a cup of flour a pinch of salt and a pinch of baking powder/soda also a 1/4 cup of water)and placed them in during the last 30 minutes of cook time. I added a little bit more beef stock and water to create a soup, similar to a Jamaican stew I like, but I can't say I will make this one again.  I thought the flavor a little too bland and the stew too greasy.  Thank you for the experience.

My family has been making lamb stew for years. One day I couldn't find my recipe so I looked this one up. The thyme and wine really make a difference. I did add peas and some extra potatoes. This is my new family favorite. It's delicious.

This is really good, my only change would be a little more broth and wine. The base is VERY rich, a bit too oily. But I definately recommend the Spicy Irish cornbread with this...and, oh yes and a good cab!

This recipe was excellent! My family is loved it. I omitted the wine (I don't cook with alcohol) and added celery. I also used another reviewer's suggestion and served this over mashed potatoes.  Just wonderful--hearty, flavorful, and chunky. I'll try it again, except I'll use beef next time.

The stew was fabulous.  I used 4 pounds of lamb shoulder (trimmed off much of the fat), and added 1 cup of Guinness instead of the white wine.  I did not have thyme, so I used rosemary instead.  I also added extra garlic.  You MUST make the Irresistible Irish Soda Bread (allrecipes as well). Next time, I will add more vegetables.

This is what you call comfort food, Yummy!  Made a few modifications, but nothing significant.  My only complaint is that the lamb did not taste as good as I expected it to.  For the price, I may sub beef next time, which may make some people gasp!  I'd rather have my lamb roasted or grilled.

When I made this I found when I added all the dry foods there was not enough broth. I had to double the broth. The stew still came out thick and delicious. This is the 2nd time I have tried it.

This stew was out of this world!!  The broth is excellent!  I did make some changes.  I cut the lamb back to 3 lbs., as lamb is expensive in our area.  I also did not put in the onion sections as my husband doesn't like a lot of onion.  I don't use wine in cooking, so I added another cup of broth.  Par excellence!!

I could not beleive what a hit this recipe was. It was "comfort food" at a small family ge-together and everybody loved it so much, they ate huge meal size portions of it. I substituted vegetable stock for the beef stock to accomodate the non-beef eaters. In fact, the only complaint I got was from my husband who said I should NOT have invited all those people to eat it all up! Can't wait to make it again!

Made this for our St. Pat's dinner.  Smelled kinda' funky the day of cooking, but the next day...YUM!  This was soooo good, especially sopped up with homemade soda bread.  The younger kids didn't like it, but that's just because they don't like lamb.  Everyone 18 and over just raved over it!  Also used Guiness instead of wine.

This recipe is fantastic, I shared it with a co-worker, and we both enjoyed making it and eating it on St. Patrick's Day. 
It's a new family favourite.
I made soda bread as well, which sealed the meal!

Wow! I have a happy husband tonight! Can’t wait for it to get even better tomorrow! This one is a hit!! I halved the recipe using lamb cuts from a halal butcher. From that, I only used half what the recipe called for in thyme. I’ve used a lot of thyme recently and I’m a bit burnt out on the flavor, it added the depth of the spice I was looking for without being overpowering. Also used half the wine. I’m not usually a fan of white wine in cooking. Neither was individually discernible in the finished dish. Oh my it turned out fantastically!

I did not use the bacon.   I used olive oil, browned meat, removed it from stock pot then did onions and garlic.  Came out GREAT!  Only thing I would do different.... double the recipe!

I did as suggested in the comments, I cooked the veggies longer (1hour carrots and 30 minutes for the potatoes) the recipe is a little vague, but it was worth it! Definitely making for my family again.

I had some left over lamb chops and couldn’t not dispose of them so I made this amazing stew! The only thing I did differently was used honey instead of sugar, it is the best! Thank you!

It's very flavorful...but I also had a couple of issues with it.  I think the amount of bacon is too much.  I used correct amount but next time I think 1/2 as much will do. A little too bacon-y and salty for my taste.  I deglazed with wine--because I always do!  And the same goes for the adding so much at the end for 20 min!  I don't get that and because I know that is not enough time to get the wine to impart the flavor without the alcohol taste.  So I sort of winged it at the end and just simmered everything for 1 and1/2 hr.  Yes, I made some changes but mostly to method.  I liked it very much!

After browning the lamb, I threw everything in the pot to let it cook. An hour or so in, I took out about 4 cups of broth and added flour while blending to create a thick paste. I slowly added this back into the pot in order to make a thickened stew. I allowed the stew to sit overnight and reheated in a slow cooker the next day.

It turned out fantastic. Everyone in my family was ranting about how tasty the stew was. The lamb fell apart and was incredibly flavorful. Make yourself some soda bread to go with it, and you will have an amazing meal for several nights.

I cut all the sizes down proportionally for a dinner for four people. 2 pounds of lamb stew meat. Everything else cut proportionally. It was delicious. Only took 1.5 hours for the lamb to cook, per directions. By the end of the cooking time, however, Lamb was extremely soft, and somewhat friable.It might work better with a more substantial meat, like beef. I substituted all purpose gluten free flour. It still turned out great. Served it with homemade sourdough bread, which my gluten-free wife tolerates without any problem. It’s a keeper recipe.

Wonderful, earthy, and comforting. I had made some bone broth so I used that in place of beef stock. Also didn't have enough lamb so I added some beef to make up the difference. Cooked meat in slow cooker over night with the spices. Turned out fantastic!

Taste really good. BUT don't know who can prep this stew in 20 minutes. Maybe a professional chef. I turned on my stopwatch and it was well over an hour before the prep was done and the meat and veggies were stewing. Are all the prep times on this site for timed for top chefs?

I made this recipe from some leftover leg of lamb. It is absolutely delicious! I wish I had made it with my son’s venison, instead of that awful chili I made. My vegetables cooked in about 20 mins. I would suggest that the other reviewer cut them a little smaller.

My husband said this was the best meal I have ever made!
Delicious. A very hearty stew.
I only used about a pound of lamb, and that was enough, along with 500 mg (a pack) of bacon. I doubled the potatoes.

It was awesome tasting after slow cooking on the stovetop. The house smelled wonderful and my husband,who doesn’t care for lamb, enjoyed it as well. Will take others advice next time and add peas, green beans and maybe even corn to add color (but I guess that would make it more to be a vegetable lamb stew??)

This Irish Lamb Stew was delicious.  I had left-over leg of lamb which did not need to be browned.  I cut the “cooked” lamb up according to the recipe and just added about a tablespoon of flour into the broth to thicken the stew.  I then cooked exactly according to the recipe.  My husband and I loved it.

Perfect! Used leg of lamb. Cooked for 2 hrs on low heat then added carrots plus potatoes for a further 30min. Added fresh rosemary and used Cabernet Sauvignon. My boyfriend says this one is a keeper:) Thank you for the recipe.

I made this a few weeks ago (as well as Irish soda bread) when I realized St. Patrick's Day had just passed. I scaled the recipe down to two servings, still used only about half of the meat called for and double the veggies; subbed white wine vinegar for white wine (I don't know what The Kitchn website is talking about, but it doesn't sub well because it is much more acidic); used chicken stock powder plus 1 tablespoon soy sauce because I didn't have beef broth; used a whole onion instead of the 1/4 + 3/8, 1-2 whole potatoes, and about 3 small carrots. It came out very meaty still, especially with the bacon, and I didn't even save use the bacon grease to sautee the onions (forgot). I love a good meat stew, but this was quite heavy, even with the decreased amount of meat and bacon grease that I used.  Good flavors, but I will try tweak it again next time to add more veggies to it.

My husband and I both loved this!  Had leftover roast leg of lamb, so I used that and cut down the time needed for the first part of the recipe.  I added 3 potatoes for only half the recipe (there are only 2 of us) and ended up having to cook longer because of them and the carrots.  Used 3 cups of beef broth and didn't add any wine.  Absolutely delicious!

Fantastic recipe!  Nice change from the usual Corned Beef and Cabbage for St. Patricks Day.  Although I made both, this Irish Lamb Stew got a lot of positive feedback.  I also added nice helping of lamb cooked barley to the stew.   Delicious! Will make this again.

Great recipe!  Made it for St. Patrick's Day and only change I made was using Guinness instead of wine.  My husband who does not like stew, raved about it and has asked me to make it again.  Thanks!

This is delicious but I had to cut the recipe in more than half. Lamb is so expensive here.

Made this tonight for Sunday dinner and everyone liked it, especially my English-born husband!  I used half the amount of lamb, since that's what I had in the freezer. Like other reviewers, I used beer instead of wine and cooked the vegetables at a low boil for about 30 minutes.  Next time I'd like to deglaze the pan with red wine for an even deeper flavor.  Very good recipe and will definitely make again!

We added demi-glace to the beef stock. This was absolutely great. Forgot to add the 2 onions at the end but it was still yummy. The 20 min. prep time is a joke. How can you dice and cook 1-1/2 lbs. of  bacon, chop 6 lbs. of lamb and fry it, etc. in 20 min.? It was worth the effort but prep time for one person was more like 1-1/2 to 2 hours.

Will make again!  If you can, take the time to brown meat and saute vegis as directed - a lot of flavor that way! To lower fat I used only 2 bacon strips,  dark beer instead of wine, and a bag of whole baby carrots worked great, I didn't have beef broth but used BetterThanBullion beef boullion paste. Made mashed potatoes separately to dump stew on top of (loved it this way with Irish Pork Stew recipe). I plan to make this again for our Easter feast!

This was great! I halved the recipe and replaced the wine with a dark beer that I had on hand—deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup and added another 1/2 cup for the 1-1/2 hr cooking time. I made the stew a day earlier and added peas when I heated it up before serving. I used just 1-1/2 pound of meat. It was enough. We will definitely make this again!

Loved it! Although I did make changes. I used some leftover Pinot noir in lieu of white wine. I omitted water & sugar & doubled the broth. I sliced & cooked all of the onions together and I added 1 Tbsp tomato paste after the onions were cooked. I added baby carrots with the broth and an hour later I added the quartered red potatoes. For the lamb I used a leg of lamb and cooked with the bone. The happy dog got the bone afterwards. The instructions were really poorly written but the result was delicious.

Very  tasty, my tester brother and I both loved it! I don't like lamb to be too strong and this wasn't at all. I was attempting to cut down the  recipe so some ingredients probably weren't measured correctly but this is one of those dishes where that doesn't seem to matter so much. It is pretty rich though and I would not call the consistency a stew... next time I would serve it over rice.

Excellent stew, however the sugar darn near ruined it. Next time I will not add sugar!  The wine is sweet enough.  I put fresh baby pearl onions in toward the last hour of cooking time as well as frozen peas.  I cooked mine for 5 hours on high in a crockpot.

My father loved lamb stew so I thought I would make it for myself and my 94 year old mother. We loved it, I did add peas and green beans to it I only put two pounds of meat in but I'm going to put another 2 pounds in.

This is excellent - I made just a couple of changes - I used very rare roasted leg of lamb, but prepared it as the recipe says - and I added some small turnips from my garden.    I found that I needed to cook some of the vegetables longer than the 20 minutes in the recipe; so when I make it again, I will probably put the carrots, onions and turnips in for about 45 minutes and then add the potatoes and rest of ingredients per recipe.

This recipe was a hit in my home.  I used the Guiness instead of wine and it really reminded me of a little Irish Pub my  and I had visited before.  I made it on a Monday and served it on a Wednesday and the flavor was out if this world!
Thank you  thank you

Wonderful!  I substituted Guinness for the wine just because...  ;)  It's even better than the lamb stew I ordered in an Irish restaurant in Portland.

I made this for my family, with some changes.  I used 2.5 lbs of lamb meat, not 6 lbs.  Used 1 lb of bacon, not 1.5 lbs.  Added 5 bay leaves, not just 2, added some celery.  Also, I did not coat the lamb in the flour, nor did I fry it in the bacon grease.  I put everything into the slow cooker at once - on high for first 3 hours, then to low for another 2 hours, before thickening the broth into gravy.  This meal was amazing!  This recipe made it into the family recipe box!  "two thumbs up!"

i used concentrated pomegranate rather than wine and ALLSPICE with the flour when browning the meat.. DO NOT ADD VEGGIES TO MEAT. the flavor was explosive until I added the veggies. BAKE THE VEGGIES AND SAUCE THEM WITH THE MEAT.

This recipe was so easy to follow!  I really Cook with lamb, and was a tad nervous.  I shouldn't have been.  It had authentic flavor, and was perfect.  Flavor did mature over night, and it kept well after freezing.

Hi Danny, I haven't made this yet,  but I've read it thoroughly and came across a possible writing-improvement. Instead of "Place meat into stock pot (leave 1/4 cup of fat in frying pan). Add the garlic and yellow onion and saute till onion begins to become golden. Deglaze frying pan with 1/2 cup water and add the garlic-onion mixture to the stock pot with bacon pieces, beef stock, and sugar. " I would write "Place meat into stock pot. Leave 1/4 cup of fat in frying pan and add the garlic and yellow onion and saute till onion begins to become golden. Deglaze frying pan with 1/2 cup water and add the garlic-onion mixture to the stock pot with bacon pieces, beef stock, and sugar." That would remove some of the confusion I think! Otherwise it seems like the garlic and onion are to be added to the stockpot. For not born cooks, like myself, keep it simple as the old adage goes :-) I will let you know how the recipe works out for me anyhow, and hope my improvements help other ambitious hungry cooks out there :-D

Wow! This is AUTHENTIC Irish lamb stew. Takes me directly to Ireland.

Only caveat, I used pinot noir instead of white wine, and lamb stew meat from a local butcher.

This is a keeper.

We raise our own lamb and have found this scrumptious recipe to be the best way to feed folks who don't like lamb.  It is rich and hearty ... and we have yet to find anyone who does not devour it, even when they know it is lamb.  Excellent over brown rice.

Excellent recipe! Easy to put together and I did use Guinness Beer instead of white wine. I also addded peas and mushrooms, which is my own personal choice in stews. Served it to our Belfast Irish guest and he was quite impressed. Will definitely make this again on one of those cold winter New England night. Thank you for the recipe.

Following along with others, the recipe has many things that could be adjusted, most notably to me was the time to cook carrots and potatoes. I left them in for about an hour and still would have been happier if I had let it simmer longer.

Otherwise, great flavor and the lamb was amazing. I was worried because I only used 5 pounds, and it was a pain to trim the fat and bones out of the cuts that I was able to bring back , but I think it was definitely worth it.

Delicious. Omitted bay leaves and used leg of lamb from Costco as that's all they had. Cooked in crock pot on low for 12 hrs. Reheated the next day. Made for family meal and they all loved it. Served over mashed potatoes and soda bread.Will definitely make again.

I used the servings calculator to cut the recipe in half - and it turned out perfect.  I used lamb RIB meat, which was a bit fattier, but the stew was perfect nonetheless.  I will make it again and again and again and again...

I cut the amount of lamb in half  but kept the rest of ingredients close to recipe & it was more then plenty for 4 people. Probably another 3-4 meals leftover. Next time I will cut back on potatoes, as I served it over mashed potatoes & it was soooo delicious.  My nephew, who is one of the pickiest eaters I've ever know had 3 helpings!!! That good. Also, I reversed cooking times for steps 3 & 4. Veggies are not fully cooking in 20 minutes.

As others have said, this recipe is awesome! I don't understand the cutting back on fat (why on earth??!) when you need the flavor and satiety in your food. I used beer instead of wine, added fresh rosemary instead of the thyme, added the carrots and potatoes at the beginning of cooking instead of at the end, used homemade beef broth, and added frozen peas for color at the end. Definitely on the rotation.

This is a great recipe but the written instructions are severely lacking.  It could be exceptional if prepared properly and these directions are lacking.    Please provide instructions like America's Test Kitchen so we all prepare it properly.

This was really good, but I will make some modifications next time:  I will use more seasoning in the flour mixture when I brown the meat, let it sit in the fridge overnight and not serve until the next day for more flavor because it was a bit bland, and use Guinness instead of wine, up the vegetable to meat ratio, I also won't use the bacon because it didn't add much.  I will make it again and families who don't like really strong flavors like mine does will love it as written.

I placed all ingredients in my slow-cooker on high for 4-5 hours, and it turned out great!  I added one cup of beer to the mix to enhance the flavor.  The only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars out of 5 stars is that I thought the beef broth gave it a saltier taste.  I've made other Irish lamb stew recipes in the past that have used just water and some chicken stock--and I prefer these ingredients now that I've tried using beef broth.  Other than that, I liked this recipe and would use it again with these few modifications.

Excellent stew recipe. Made it for St. Patty Day.  Changed 3 onions to just 2 large onions.  Add Chopped Celery(2-3cups) with about a 1/3 into the meat mixture for the simmering, the rest for the last part of the Vegetable additions, and simmered a little longer after adding Veggies.  Used a Can of Guinness Stount instead of Wine.  This all came out as advertised, Very Excellent!

Absolutely divine! I only made a couple alterations. COOK THIS FOR AT LEAST 2 HOURS. I added the veggies in after the 1 hour mark. I skipped using the white wine or water altogether and just used a few 12oz beers. It gave so much depth of flavor to the finished stew. I also added all bacon grease to the stock pot. Other than that, this is an amazing stew and my hubby devoured a bowl in minutes!

This is the second time I made this. it is delicious! I made it with beef and didn't have wine so I just used extra beef broth. The veggies took about 40 minutes to soften. Great recipe. I will be making it again and again!

I made a half batch, but reduced the meat to 1 pound and increased the vegetable amounts.  The first time I made this I added peas, and the second time I added some mixed vegetables I had leftover from the previous night's dinner.  You could really adapt this to any veggies you like, but I think the potatoes are required to keep it Irish.  :) I like a thick stew, but I did end up adding a bit more beef broth when I added the vegetables.  I will definitely make this again.

4 stars because it's quite fatty (fat from bacon) and it certainly lacks saltiness (only 1/2 tsp for 6 lbs lamb + additional vegetables ???)

Oh my goodness, made this a couple weeks ago and my mouth still waters thinking about it. I only had about 2 or 3 pounds of lamb and it was still amazing. I promised to give some to my sister but we ate it all before I could get it to her!

Pretty darn epic, but a lot of work. Frying 1.5lbs of bacon takes some time, but not as much time as browning 6lbs of lamb. If you attempt the recipe, then I suggest getting a very large skillet. Mine is about 14", but it took forever to cook the bacon and brown the meat. I used red skinned potatoes and they needed more like 30 mins from the time they were added. Everyone who tried it loved it though and if you take the time to properly brown the lamb, you won't get any of that gamey flavor. Everyone who tried it, loved it!

This was phenomenal. I made it the day before I needed it, and refrigerated it so I could scoop off the very thick layer of fat off the top. I halved the recipe and put it in my crockpot -it only took two hours, so watch yours if you decide to use the crockpot.

NOTE.. BACON fat is important, it gives the dish the base flavor.. As is the browning.. It gives the lamb added flavor.. Browning seals in flavor and also breaks down the lamb a bit to give it more tenderness.. 
 
Veggies need more time to cook.. so plan on adding more time to them.. Cook them to your own preference.. 

This is an amazing hearty stew..  as others have done, i replaced the wine with Beer.. Wine gives it a different flavor.. but Beer makes it more hearty in my opinion.. 
I also add in some hot spices to it to give it a bang.. I like spicy food.. I am a huge Cajun food fan,  and lived down in the bayou of LA for years.. So I added in a bit of flavor from the deep south of Louisiana .. :)

This is the first time I have made this stew.  I have always wanted to but  I felt I could not.  With the aid of  the video I felt better trying.  My Family want this stew as a staple from now on.  

I ended up not having Bay Leaves so I used a little Basil.  I  had everything else.  I used Campagne.  It was so good.  I could not find Irish Beer anywhere.

I learned I need to start sooner  cooking because I found my self slower cutting up all of the veggies and meat.  I did not find Lamb so I used beef.  I really enjoyed cooking this meal.  

I would next time use the two pot method.  I think it would be less thick.  I found the one pot caused the stew to stick more to the bottom.  So, I had to pay more attention to the stew in the pot; keeping it from burning.

This stew is just wonderful and it reminded me of my Grandmother's cooking and She was from the South.  This stew feels like home and now it is a part of our Family too.

This is fantastic!  I used a really good quality applewood smoked bacon and the flavors were amazing.  This will be my "go to" lamb stew from now on!  I agree with another reviewer that 20 minutes is not enough time to simmer the vegetables.  I cut mine into small pieces and simmered it for about 45 minutes more.

I made this without the bacon, with only one onion, and without the beef stock. I put a few lamb bones in to get broth that way... I will be making it again the next time I get my hands on some lamb!

1st time cooking Lamb anything and this is delicious. Only made insignificant changes like I only had lamb shanks with the bone so I floured them and fried in the bacon grease then threw them in the crock pot with the spices and beef stalk. I added a little butter to the grease to cook the onion and garlic because the shanks soaked up most of it. I added a little celery cause I had some that needed to be used up, cooked the meat on low all night and it fell off the bones. Turned pot off, removed the bones and after cooling some I scraped the layer of fat off the top. Came home from work, turned pot back on, added vegies and cooked on high till pretty hot then on low for about 1-2hrs. Served with homemade biscuits, very rich and very delicious. Definitely not something to have if your on a diet lol but is so good on these cold, rainy, Alaskan days.

There is no doubt that this stew is absolutely fantastic tasting: so savory, perfect texture and consistency, rich lamb flavour. The only reason it's not a perfect five-star recipe is because the timing is a bit off; the carrots and potatoes need to be added *at least* a half hour earlier otherwise they will still be hard and the potatoes won't cook to the point they have thickened up the rest of the stew. (So, put them in for at least 50 minutes total, rather than 20.) Other than that, perfect. A repeated go-to.

I'm relatively new at cooking. Made the recipe without altering anything, really. The meat was so tender it would melt in your mouth! Next time I might alter the bay leaf or thyme amounts just a little, since my tastebuds aren't used to this type of fragrance in food yet and they may need some time adapt to this new edge/flavor. Definitely plan to make again.

Oh! I did use this recipe as a guide to make beef stew a couple days later, minus the bay leaf. Came out pretty good, too, but not as flavorful and tender as with the lamb.

I used left over leg of lamb that had been roasted.  Cut into pieces and dregged in flour before browning with onions and garlic (added diced celery, too).  I always cook the carrots separate and throw in with some forzen peas about 20 minutes before serving. I agree the potatoes take a bit longer to cook. I also added a squeeze of tomato paste.  YUM

Turned out to be delicious. Bought cubed lamb for stew which needed to be coked long and low for approx 3 hrs before tender.  Added veggies an  cooked another 45 minutes. So took considerably longer than times noted in recipe.  But this is a keeper.  Great depth of flavor.

ok, so i tried to follow recipe but didnt understand why only 5 cups of liquid...so i used 48oz of 100% all natural beef broth and 3 cups of water and 2 cups of wine...i added all the ingredients together after browning the lamb instead of waiting and added an hour to the simmer time to soften the meat a bit more and organic flour to thicken it a bit... its the first time ive made this but i really like the way it turned out..

This was great.  Borrowed some hints from others and other recipes.  Added the veges 1 hour before it was supposed to be done.  Also thickened toward the end and added fresh chopped parsley.  Thanks will make it again...goodbye corned beef!

Pretty flavorful. I really enjoyed the lamb. The bacon is pretty prominent, so you may want to cut back. Makes it less salty.

I also used stew meat for this recipe because I was too cheap to spend $30 for a lamb shoulder not knowing if the recipe was any good. It was excellent and will definately try with lamb next time. I added some flour and water at the end to thicken it up. Also when it says to add the carrots, potatos and onions, do not add the potatos. Wait until the carrots and onions are soft and then add the potatos. The potatos cook much faster then the others. Flavor was amazing!!

Though I left out the bacon and the wine, I still think that this recipe is amazing.  The spices were a great match for the gamey lamb. The meat, veggies, and broth were perfect. The meat and veggies were nice and tender, while the broth was flavorful and thick. So good!

AMAZING ! This is one of my favorite recipes I got from this site. One observation, this stew will thicken substantially after the first day, so you might want to increase the liquid ( or reduce the meat and veggies )

I made this for St Patrick's Day when we had some friends over. They all loved it. I did have to use pork instead of lamb just because I couldn't get any lamb where I live but it still turned out great. I hope I can try it agian with the lamb.

A really lovely, easy and delicious stew. I tried it with 1/2 can of lager instead of wine or Guinness and it was very light and flavoursome. Not too heavy. Will regularly use this recipe! Also very easy to make a smaller amount of stew and adjust the ingredients as you see necessary.

Great recipe.  I didn't have beef broth so just added water, and I used goat meat instead....not too many chevon recipes out there - so I find lamb recipes and substitute.  Great flavor - and wonderful over basmati rice the next day.

Fantastic! Followed the recipe to the tee and it turned out great. Leftovers the next night were as big a hit as the first night. I served it over potpie noodles for lunch the following day and it was better yet.

Have made this recipe the past three years for St. Patricks day and it has always been excellent.  I have tried putting lots of black pepper, a moderate amount of black pepper, and the called for amount of black pepper and all three came out great; although the batch with a lot of black pepper was very potent so be careful.  I have not had anyone who has tried it say they don't like it.

At last I found the closest thing to gamma's lamb stew!! Very good indeed! I did add some mutton sausage in with the lamb though, and used some "celtic chardonnay" for the wine, ab-fab, mate!

WE LOVE THIS!!!  My parents are Corned Beef and Cabbage people for St. Patrick's day but since I hate it we went with this option instead.  We have made for the last 4 years and its a St. Patrick's day favorite now!  We do make it the night before and just heat it the day of.

I tried this because we had some leftover lamb, and I made it in a crockpot, I don't know if it was something I did but the bf was not a fan and he usually likes everything I make. It seemed okay to me but not worth 5 stars.

Good, hearty flavor, but I was disappointed that the consistency was more like soup than stew even after omitting the water. The broth was tasty soaked up with a piece of bread, but I still wish this recipe included directions to thicken it up at the end. I would probably try a different recipe next time, but look for one with similar ingredients since I liked the flavor. Following the advice of others, I used Irish stout instead of wine, and only about 2 lbs of lamb.

My family did not like this at all.  It was completely flavorless.  I spent about 2 hours prepping for this recipe and followed it to the letter, but it was so bland that we just threw the leftovers away.

This stew was outstanding!  The only things I changed were the amount of lamb, 3.5 lbs., the amount of bacon, 3/4 lb., and I used Guinness in place of the water and wine.  Everything else was the same and it was to die for!  Everyone  raved about it, even our best friend who's been to Ireland and is a cook himself said that it was superb and had seconds, and made me pack some up for him to take home!  The only thing it needed at the end was some freshly craked pepper.  YUMMY!

Turned out well. I substituted beef cube steak instead of lamb because I had it in my freezer. I also added a can of crushed tomatoes just to get a few more veggies in there. I put everything in the crock pot and cooked on low for about 9 hours. It was tender and yummy!

This was great.  I used Turkey Bacon b.c. that's all I had.  Therefore, I had to use a little extra oil in the preparations.  It turned out great.  Not too oily.  Will definetly make again.

Everyone loved this. This pleased 6 adults, one of which had never tried lamb before. The only adjustment I made was reducing the amount of bacon to 3/4 lb. and I used 2 1/4 lbs. lamb steak.

OMG, this was so yummy!  I wasn't able to find any lamb, so I substitutes it for corned beef (which was on sale).  It still turned out to be so good and made plenty of stew.  I took the advice of others and used more veggies and less meat.  I think this will be my new favorite St. Patrick's Day recipe (or really, any time I feel like it recipe!).

A beautiful lamb stew, the best I've ever made or tried! I did make a couple of changes though - added a couple of tablespoons of tomato puree and some celery. This is a wonderful recipe, though the ingredients may seem really simple. Even dad, who is superfussy loved it!

Very good stew!  I basically used the recipe as a guideline.  I had a lamb bone leftover from another recipe on this site (Roast Leg of Lamb with Rosemary - try; it's awesome!), so I put it in a crockpot with the other ingredients.  I did use 1 lb. bacon instead of 1-1/2, about 3/4 c. onion instead of 3 large onions, rosemary instead of thyme, and I omitted the 1/2 c. water.  The stew was thick and hearty.  My only complaint would be that the seasoning was overly strong, but that may be caused by the fact that I used less lamb than specified in the recipe.

This stew is out of this world. Loved it, loved it, loved it! I have made it twice, once on St. Patty's day with soda bread and it hit the spot. Make sure you skim off the grease on the top of the pot (anyone who makes soups or stews should know that) and it won't be greasy. Each time I made this I had the butcher chop me up a leg of lamb. I also used much more garlic and more wine, and used less meat (about half) and less bacon, and more potatoes. This is really great for a special occasion, and well worth the expense. It is also excellent the next day.

This is a fantastic recipe! I've made it so many times now, I can do it blind folded. I think lamb is the best choice of meat as well, as I used beef once and it wasn't as tender. I think I'll try it with guiness next time.

This recipe was not one of my favorites.  For some reason I was the only one who tried it who didn't really care for it.  Perhaps it was the sugar or maybe the Chablis I used for the wine?  I can't really place what it was about it that I didn't like.  I probably wouldn't make it again.  I gave it four stars though becuase everyone else who tasted it liked it. I hope they really did like it and weren't just saying that so as not hurt my feelings!

This was very good. I think next time I will replace the potato in the recipe with some celery, and serve over mashed potatoes. Maybe rosemary-garlic mashed potatoes.

This recipe is awesome as it stands.  But I will admit that the last time I made it I used Guinness instead of wine and water and thought that it came out even better.  You're just gonna have that when you cook with Guinness.

Cooked exactly as per recipe and allowed it to rest for 6 hours.  Beautiful tender meat - very flavourful.  Big hit with both my husband and me.

Very hearty stew with great flavor.  I changed things a bit by using less bacon, adding the herbs in the first stage of cooking, and using the oven instead of cooking on stove top.

This was very good.  I did cut the bacon down to half and also the lamb and I did thicken the sauce at the end.  Other than that, I followed the directions and it was fabulous.  I made it with Irish Soda Bread from this site and it was very good dipped in the sauce.  The lamb was very tender.  The preperation time did take a bit longer, but it was well worth it.

I never thought I would enjoy lamb. Needed some improvement. It is my opinion you could due w/o the white sugar and water.Substitute beef broth in its place. Otherwise, for the first lamb stew I ever made, I am glad I started w/ this recipe. I'm hooked on lamb.
