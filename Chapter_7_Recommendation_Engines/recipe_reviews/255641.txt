Lots of good healthy vegetables but my family didn't care for the resulting flavor.

11.10.16 ~ This is a nice soup/stew, but a little mild for our tastes. I doubled the recipe as I was making it for my in-laws. They will love it. I added a little cayenne pepper to the portion I kept for us. We liked the zip that it added.

I added extra potatoes, tomato paste, extra carrots and celery, green beans and hot sauce. Kids loved it!
