To make this recipe more friendly to my diet needs, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and omitted the butter and the brown sugar. I made the entire recipe stove top in my nonstick skillet, browning the breasts seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder first using cooking spray, removing them and then adding the sauce ingredients to the pan.  Let it come to a boil, and then turned it down to simmer and put the chicken back into the sauce until cooked through.  It was very good.  My husband is not fond of "sweet meat" so the sweetness level was fine for us, but some might like it better with more sweetness as directed in this recipe using brown sugar as well.  Reminded me of sweet and sour chicken and we enjoyed it.

This recipe is very bland. The sauce reminded us of tomato soup. We won't be making this again.

This way very good.  Next time I will add orange juice instead of
brown sugar.  I used Olivio instead of butter.  I would grate some
ginger in also for zing.  I will also take skin off chicken first &
add another tsp. of cornstarch to vinegar because the sauce did become
more watery after baking.

My husband and I made this last night for dinner, and we both absolutely loved it.  We mixed together all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl (We actually used pineapple Jam instead of crushed pineapple), then browned the chicken in a deep pan with the butter. Once the chicken was browned on both sides we poured the sauce over it and let it cook on medium until the chicken was no longer pink and the sauce thickened. Served over rice, and it was delicious! Thanks for sharing!

Tweaked it to my taste and it came out fine. The biggest differences were: I used skinless breast tenderloins and pan fried them in a little oil for a minute each side (just couldn't see how they would get brown otherwise); I used rice wine vinegar, less sugar and fresh pineapple. I didn't have Worcestershire so I omitted it. I served it over noodles with a side salad.I will make it again. But I think I'll add some rough chop onion and green pepper - stir fried til crisp tender - before serving. That makes it more like traditional Chinese sweet and sour.

Our family loves this recipe.  I use boneless skinless chicken breasts sprinkled with garlic powder & fresh ground pepper.  I tweaked the sauce a bit as well by using apple cider vinegar and cutting down the amount to 3 tbsps.  I used pineapple chunks and reserved a bit of the juice to add to the sauce making up the difference from the vinegar.  I also added ground ginger and pineapple chunks to the saucepan while making the sauce (to soften them up a bit).

I was just writing out  a negative review while the sauce was cooling, there I found my mistake. Before I let it simmer and then cool, I tasted this sauce and found it to be revolting, the vinegar and soy sauce and salt was just "too much." BUT, after it has cooled a bit I've tried it and found it to be pretty tasty! Of course I also added 3-4 times the amount of brown sugar that it called for to counter the bitterness and saltiness. Overall, after adding it to rice it wasn't that bad. The vinegar was still too much for me, maybe I am just more sensitive to the smell. I do not believe in altering the recipe and then complaining that it was gross, so I may try it again exactly as directed before I write it off.  I think I may make it again, thanks for sharing!

I tried this and added green peppers and onions and sauteed them in the butter sauce.  I only used 2 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I increased the cornstarch to make the sauce thicker because I knew the pineapple juice would probably thin it down. We loved the way it turned out.  Next time I may add carrots.

I made a few changes after reading other reviews and a few of my own... I started with chicken tenders, which I cut in half (instead of chicken parts). I browned them in a little olive oil in a frypan and then poured the sauce over the chicken and cooked 15 minutes on the stovetop with a cover. I used fresh pineapple, but since it is not from a can with liquid, I added a little orange juice and ginger. I also added unsalted cashews. Delicious!

Really liked this and the kids did too.  I actually used half the ketchup called for and subbed in some BBQ sauce and used mango rice wine vinegar and fresh pineapple.  I increased the heat for cooking a few degrees as I used boneless skinless thighs.  Served with brown rice and black beans and it was a hit.

I added fresh chopped ginger for more flavor and would cut the catsup the next time. I like the soy sauce and used Balsalmic vinegar instead of plain vinegar. I also used fresh chopped pineapple since I have access to it. I used boneless chicken breasts and uncovered the breast part way thru to brown them well-cooked a bit longer so the sauce was really bubly and darkened a bit. The sauce is quite good over brown rice to make it a bit healthier. We served it with fresh steamed green beans and it's a great combo. Dessert was Mayan Chocolate Coconut pudding and it complemented this dish very well.

I cannot really review the recipe as I had to make several changes. I had  a couple of cooked chicken legs so I guestimated the amounts and after cooking the sauce for a few minutes in a saucepan,  I put the chicken in a glass dish, poured the sauce over and microwaved on medium for several minutes. 
Served with rice it was very good.

Delicious like most recipes on this site. I made 3 packages per recipe and one plain for the kids. I had a simple cheese quesadilla and corn on the cob as Sides.

Pretty tasty. I used chicken wings and brown them in the butter. after they were Brown I added the remaining sauce ingredients with the addition of some ginger and garlic. I also added in some pineapple juice and extra cornstarch to give it more pineapple flavor. I simmered it for about 15 or 20 minutes. I served it with rice and a vegetable. the sauce was delicious over the rice. I will make this again.

I added an onion and some pepper cut up.It helped to take the vinegar taste away. It would have been easier to use duck sauce. Will not make again.

I will definitely make this again.  I cooked some chicken the day before.  When I prepared the sauce, I cubed the cooked chicken and mixed it in.  Heated it in the oven and served over rice.  Really good.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was good, but next time I'll tweak it.  Family felt it needed a little zing. I enjoyed it and ate all the leftovers, but the spouse wouldn't even finish his plate, rest ate it but didn't "love it".

Mostly just tastes like sweet, tomato chicken. I couldn't taste the pineapple at all. That said, my kids loved it.

I made this for the second time tonight. The vinegar and salt flavors the first time around were overwhelming. This time I reduced the vinegar to 1/8th cup and omitted the salt. The second version also included chunks of pineapple, bell pepper and onion. Much much better!

I sauted peppers and green onions in the butter.  I removed them  and thickened the sauce following the receipes ingredients plus using a little orange juice & ginger as I didn't have juice from the canned pineapple..  Once the sauce was thick I re-added the peppers and green onions.  I used fresh pineapple which I also added and heated.  Put the chicken pieces in a glass pan and coverered with the mixture.  Cooked until done.  Delicious.  Served with basmati rice.

Fearfully I used less than a 1/4 cup of ketchup and I still agree with other reviewer; tastes like tomato soup.  Trying to salvage, added the drained pineapple juice.  Helped  a little.  Not sure where to go from here.

I made this dish, changed balsamic for the vinegar, used some cubed pineapple and some juice in the sauce with a little more cornstarch.  Turned out fantastic and my husband loved it.  Served with Jasmine rice with water chestnuts.  Delish!

I looked for a pineapple chicken recipe and settled on this one because it sounded really good. I am guilty of never following a recipe so I did make some alterations. I doubled the brown sugar and ketchup, used Red Wine Vinegar plus a half cup of Bartles & Jaymes Pina Colada in the sauce and also added it to the water for rice, 1/4 c. I skipped the Soy Sauce and Worcestershire Sauce and added 3 drops of Tabasco Sauce. I added 1/8 tsp of Basil, a pinch of Marjoram leaves, and two shakes of Penzeys India Ground Fennel. I used 2 1/2 tsp of corn starch and a 20 oz can of Pineapple chunks. For the rice I used 1 1/2 c. Par Excellence long grain white, and 1/2 c. brown rice. I baked it for 60 minutes @ 350 ( 170 degrees on the meat thermometer). 3.5 lbs (8 pieces) of thighs.

This was the worst tasting sauce I have ever made.  Very strong tomato taste (due to the amount of ketchup) and very strong vinegar.

Hugely disappointing. Very bland. Followed recipe to the letter, only difference being I put mine over the chicken in a crockpot. IF I ever used this recipe again (not likely) I would use pineapple chunks, and doctor it up with peppers and a little chile flakes and more vinegar.

When making this, I substituted Vinegar with red wine vinegar, and butter for margarine. I didn't use soy sauce, because it contains gluten. I also added chopped peppers. It turned out really well, the sauce tastes like a mild version of the spicy shrimp sauce from Pei Wei.

It was only ok, but I think it has potential. It will not brown in the oven with all of the sauce in the pan. I started to pour some of it off, but I try to cook it as the recipe is called first. Next time i'm going to cook on top of stove to brown the chicken. The chicken needed flavor it was really bland and slightly tough. It wasn't getting done at all with my oven set at 325 degrees. I turned it up to 400 degrees.  The sauce is good! I didn't make this dish with rice, but I can see it working well with the sauce. I made it with mixed veggies-broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. Will try with sauce with rice next time. I didn't have any cornstarch on hand. I used baking powder. I'll give this recipe one more try before I thought it out!


Today is June 23, 2016:
I tried this recipe again. It is really good. The chicken was better. I put olive oil on the front and back side of the chicken to keep it juicy. I didn't cook it first as I mentioned I would. I seasoned it and pour the pineapple mix on top. I cooked brown rice and use the pineapple mixture on the brown rice instead of gravy. When all of the chicken was gone I used the pineapple mixture with the left over rice for another meal.

My family LOVED this recipe, and begged to make it again before we even finished the meal! Here's what you should tweak to take it to the next level:
1. Grill the chicken instead of baking. This will cut down on cooking time.
2. Instead of using vinegar, substitute balsamic.
3. Use chunk pineapples instead of crushed.

Good luck! This is delicious :)

My family loved this recipe, I thought it was a bit too sweet.  Next time I will add tad more vinegar for a more sweet and sour taste.  I added coarsely chopped onion and extra cornstarch as the chicken was frozen tenders.  I served this with white rice and homemade Portuguese Sweet rolls.

Excellent flavor and super-easy to make!  Just be sure you give the chicken enough cooking time- I increased the oven temperature to 350 and still had to cook it 10 more minutes than was called for in the recipe.  The sauce is wonderful and subtle, the chicken was moist and tender- served with coconut rice, it is unbeatable!

We enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to make and just the right sweet and sour. I added part pineapple juice to the vinegar to make the 1/4 cup because I didn't have enough vinegar. It was perfect.

This was quite good over rice. I made it as written although I used only chicken breast which I sliced into small pieces and added some celery. OK. I also cooked it on the stovetop which was fine - browning the chicken, removing it, making the sauce (as directed) and adding the chicken back. It was very flavorful although I felt a little guilty that we weren't having more vegetables. Next time I make it, I'll add sliced carrots.  My guy enjoyed it and thinks he would like cashews in it too.  It thickened nicely before I added the pineapple and then it wasn't as thick but still quite good. Of course, I realize now I used the regular (20 oz) can of pineapple but it was still great. Loved it for lunch the next day too!  Thank you!

the sauce is good! excellent recipe. I tried it and it came out really close! just added fresh pineapple instead of your usual canned foods. I cooked the pineapple with the chicken separately from the sauce. then I sauté them together at the end.

Delicious. Everyone at the table loved it, even the picky eaters. I made a few changes though (mainly because of what I had on hand). First, I used half of a fresh pineapple instead of the canned - I just chopped it up and tossed it into the sauce. Second. I used rice vinegar instead. The only thing I would change (and this could be my fault for using different things) would be to let the sauce thicken more before using it or to let the chicken cook longer. The sauce was a little too soupy. It was still delicious on the jasmine rice, but I would make it slightly different next time.

This was yummy. It had a good sweet taste to it and it was something that my 3 year old liked, who is hard to please sometimes. My husband and I love spicy foods and our son is not there yet so this was a good one to share with him!
