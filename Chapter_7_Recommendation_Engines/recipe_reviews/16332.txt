This soup was very tasty.  I am currently a senior culinary school student and needed a quick soup to make for a party and this is the one a chose.  I did make a few changes and additions though.  First of all, the tortellini shouldn't be cooked IN the soup.  The starch from the tortellinis only causes the soup to thicken like a stew and they end up being overcooked and mushy.  I cooked them seperately and added them to the bowls at service time.  This soup was also lacking color, so I added some shredded carrots to the simmering broth to add both flavor and color.  With all this being done, the soup was wonderful.

I love this soup, but I do make some modifications -- I use fresh spinach and basil, add in fresh vegs (carrots, celery, onion, peas...) and add in some white wine and garlic for good measure.  Yum!

Easy and excellent. Picking up on others' suggestions, I sauteed onion and garlic, added dried basil, then the broth (1 qt.), some shredded carrot and zucchini, along with a lot of fresh spinach, 1/4 tsp. lemon pepper. Then the tortellini, to simmer just 'til al dente. Grated parmesan on each serving.

Is this a great country, or what!!

I just served this to my Bridge group and they all wanted the recipe.  I cook 2 cups of sliced mushrooms and a very large chopped onion in a little olive oil with some minced garlic...then add the chicken broth ad when hot I enough to cook the tortellini I used the brand that is tri-colored.....so it was as pretty as it was flavorful....low fat, low cal and good for you.

I didn't bother with the original recipe. I followed some suggestions of others. I sauteed a whole chopped onion, 3 cloves of garlic, and 1 whole carrot, cut into matchsticks. I ended up using 3 cans of stock and 3 addtl cups of chicken boullion. Once the broth boiled, I reduced the heat and added 2 chopped tomatoes and almost a whole bag of chopped frozen spinach. I only simmered it for about 5 minutes, so the spinach would not overcook. I boiled the tortellini seperately and added it once the soup was off the heat. This is a fabulous meal! I got veggies into my husband!! I forsee this becoming a leftovers soup, where I will add leftover chicken or veggies or whatever.

This is a great recipe to make in the evenings after work or when you don't have a lot of time.  Very good - although a little too much spinach for my liking.  My changes:

1.  I added a can of corn drained.
2.  Used Italian flavored diced tomatoes and eliminated the other spices.
3.  Cooked chicken in a skillet, shredded, and then added to pot.
4.  Only cooked the tortellini for 3 to 5 mins.

My suggestion would be to make the soup and keep the tortellini separate - especially if you're anticipating leftovers.  Simply add the pasta you're going to eat immediately for a few minutes before storing.  Allows the rest of the soup to keep better for eating leftovers.  The pasta starts to fall apart after being in the fridge for a day.

This soup is so delicious and easy!  I also add 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and used fresh garlic instead of powder.  I also add chicken broth or extra water when the soup gets too thick and it will!  This soup is great with a sandwich or all by itself.  I have also doubled/tripled the recipe for parties.  I made it for my son's first birthday and it was a huge success.  Don't forget to add parmesan cheese when serving. Enjoy!

I made this soup yesterday, and even though I don't like to change the recipes, I followed some of the changes others did...I sauteed onions and garlics, added the chicken broth, chopped tomatoes, then the spinach (I had fresh, so I used it), boiled the tortellini separately, but I left them almost done, and when I served them, I added them to the broth to let them finish cooking in it so they could get the flavors of everything, I also added some shredded parmesan cheese, and it turned out great! Hubby and I loved it!

This was a nice simple soup, and the spinach was surprisingly delicious. Doubling the recipe, I used a bag of cut frozen spinach, and color wasn't an issue with my tri-colored dry cheese tortellini. I was skeptical of the basil and garlic powder, but it was fine. However, I'd suggest low-sodium broth, as it got salty at the end (the tortellini?), as well as adding more broth. Still, something seemed to be needed, so I brought to the table hot sauce, lemon, parmesan, cream...trying to discover the missing ingredient. Parmesan was great, as was the TJoe's hot sauce and lemon, but the real winner, surprisingly, was my 10-year-old's addition of lemon pepper! To my amazement, it really worked (Lawry's brand anyway...)!

This was very easy to make and I just happened to have everything here which made it very easy!  I used onion powder because that's all I had on hand instead of fresh onions, but it tasted great!  I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth because i'm a vegetarian and I thought it was delicious and made more sense to have veggie broth instead of a meat one considering there is no other meat ingredient in this recipe.  I give this an A+++++

I hate it when people do this - but here I am .  It's 5 stars BUT I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes, slivered carrots and sweet Italian sausage.  Plus I sauteed onions in garlic and olive oil.  I destroyed the original recipe - but ohmygoodness - THE BEST SOUP EVER!  Cook the pasta separately!

I'm all for easy and quick!  I usually a "add a little bit of this and that" kind of cook.  It's rare that I don't switch stuff up with a recipe, but honestly -- this recipe is perfect as is!  (I'm SERIOUS!)  My kids even love it!

This was a good basic recipe.  You can do a lot to change the flavor by adding different veggies and spices.  Cooking the tortellini before adding them to the pot definitely keeps them from getting too mushy, as others have suggested.  Also, I think the parmesan cheese at the end helps boost the flavor as well.

This is the first recipe I ever made off this website. I'm not sure what took me so long to review it, because this has become a household favorite! 
A very quick and simple soup, that is hearty and filling. Perfect for a chilly fall day or a snowy night. I've made some minor adjustments over the years that I think really add to existing flavors of the soup. Firstly I add some chunky veggies to the soup, as that is how I like it (usually carrots, onion, celery, and zucchini), then I crush 2-4 cloves of garlic into it (depending on amount I am making). I add the spinach in the last few minutes of cooking, otherwise the spinach gets soggy and slimy, this way it comes out perfectly blanched and tender. I use the rainbow (cheese) tortellini to add some color to the dish, and then sprinkle grated parm over it and top it with red pepper. The melted cheese and pepper really kick up the broth a notch!
I wish it was possible to give this recipe more stars!

I sauteed chopped onion, garlic, and shredded carrot together beore adding broth (used 1 can reduced sodium and one can regular), used fresh spinach, practically eliminated the garlic powder, and topped with a few sprinkles of grated parmesan.  Fantastic!!  Thank you!

I sauteed 1/2 chopped onion and 2 tsp minced garlic in 1 Tbsp. butter. Next, I added about 7-8 cups chicken broth, 1 can of diced tomatoes (drained) and 1 package of frozen spinach. I also added a (frozen) cube of fresh basil. I brought that to a boil and then added a 19 oz. package of frozen cheese tortellini. I let it boil for about 5 minutes, until the tortellini was ready. Served with garlic bread. Hubby and I both LOVED it!

Great soup.  I used fresh spinach and added some chopped carrots, onions and some sauteed mushrooms I had in the fridge.  A real hearty soup and quick to make, which I just love.  Quick, easy and soooo good.  Thanks, Nicole for anotherkeeper.

A quick, simple delicious lunch for a cold day. I've made it as written and with vegetable broth and it's super both ways. Cheese/garlic tortellini adds some flavor. BTW, I don't bother defrosting the spinach. It thaws and cooks in the pot.

Excellent soup and easy to make.  I've served this to my small kids and they love it.  I've used fresh spinach and frozen (both work).  I've added a little oregano and nutmeg, giving it a little zing.  All in all, makes a great lunch.

I sauteed sweet onion, fresh grated garlic in olive oil, added a whole bag of fresh spinach and sauteed until tender.  Then I added 3 cans of chicken broth, 1 14 1/2 oz can of diced tom,sliced carrots, celery, splash of white wine, squeeze of fresh lemon juice and the basil, then brought to boil then simmered for 15-20 minutes (I ended up adding 2 cups of water and 3tsp of chicken bouillon as it was too thick for my taste.).  I cooked some four cheese tortellini and spinach tortellini separate and added right before eating.  Fantastic flavor!!!!

I made this soup over the weekend, and it was delicious!  I tweaked it a little - I added maybe half the spinach (which was plenty), 4 cans of broth, twice the tortellini, some onion powder, sliced carrots (which I boiled separately as they tend to overpower with flavor) and cooked, sliced sweet Italian sausage.  I'll be making this one often!

This was definitely one of the easiest soups I've ever made and one of ~ if not THE~ best I've ever had.  My family rated this a definte "do again".  The only changes I made were to use some roasted garlic I had and I added some low fat sausage.  This is the best!

Delicious! I added fresh spinach instead of frozen and added carrots, celery, can of diced tomatoes, and diced cooked chicken. I also recommend cooking the tortellini separate. My fiance and I loved it! Definite repeat recipe!

As written, not superb. I also added two carrots and three stalks of celery along with garlic, all of which I sauteed prior to adding the other ingredients.  I then added the chicken broth, waited a bit, then added the spinach.  I used frozen spinach straight from the package.  I cooked the tortellini separately.  The soup looked like really wet veggies and didn't taste like much so I decided to add a cube of chicken bouillon. That made the difference!  It turned out to be a nice broth-soup.  I would recommend, as many others have, to add the tortellini just before serving (after cooking separately).  Also, I would add more broth/less spinach the next time and maybe just one carrot.  Quite good with the changes.

This soup was quick and delicious! I used fresh garlic instead of powder, and cooked the tortellini seperatly. I think this will become a common dish in my household!

Tastes great, very budget friendly, and quick/easy to make! I used a 10 oz. bag of fresh spinach (on sale for $1), a 19 oz. bag of tortellini ($1), and 4 cans of chcken broth (about $4 - 2 regular, and 2 low sodium, that was all I had on hand). $6 total for a huge pot of soup! I added a little onion powder and a splash of lemon juice. Next time I will try shredded chicken or mini meatballs (from the Mama's Italian Wedding Soup recipe on this site). I also sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on top of each serving.

One word here!  YUM!  I did add another can of chicken broth and minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also used a can of diced Italian tomatoes, omitting the need for the basil.  This was a great week night supper.  Including cooking time for a crusty loaf of baguette bread, it was ready and on the table in 30 minutes!  Perfect for kids because the healthy spinach in this soup takes on an italian flavor.

After reading other reviews, i was pretty skeptical ... but i thought it was very good and  flavorful too.  Filling, but also a good light dinner.  I did use 32oz.'s of broth, added in some grated carrott (not too much, but enough to give it that sweetness that carrott has when cooked), used twice as much tortellini(18 oz.'s) to stretch it farther, and used garlic and mozzerella stuffed tortellini. Word to the wise...with this recipe they say serves 4 and that is definetly all it serves if you follow the recipe to a tee.

Excellent!  I did make a few changes, based on the reviews:  I used 2 cans of water, 4 t. chicken bouillon, 2/3 (rather than 1/4) T. basil, 2/3 (rather than 1/4) T. garlic (I used dried minced garlic).  Very tasty...wish I had more!

I thought this was an EXCELLENT soup...with all the recommended adjustments.  I added carrots, chopped fresh tomatoes, parsley, basil, minced onion, and fresh garlic.  I added 2 chicken boulion cubes and about a cup and a half of water so that the spinach wasnt too overpowering.  I also cooked the macaroni separately.  I will most DEFINATELY make this again.  It is delicious!

Well this soup turned out good AFTER I made some additions.  I added some real bacon bits & some dried onion (dried only because the soup was already done cooking) & some minced garlic as others had suggested.  Also LISA0208 made a great suggestion (had I only read it earlier, because the next day it was gross & mushy) of NOT cooking the tortellini in the broth, it did give it a "starchy" taste.  I topped it with Italian blend shredded cheese.  I'm not sure I would make it again (thanks Lisa), and thanks anyway Nicole :)

I made the soup with fresh spinach and cooked it for a shorter period of time.  I also did not add salt due to the amount of salt in the broth.  It was really good!

I made this recipe and my husband and I loved it!  I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  Also instead of garlic powder, I substituted minced garlic.  This makes great leftovers.

This was really good!  But helpful hint, only cook the amount of tortellini you are going to eat right away. I put leftovers in the fridge and the pasta soaked up all the liquid and got really mushy.  Next time I will just cook one serving of pasta, and then put the broth on the fridge and just cook the next serving in it when I heat it up again.

This was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! It is a rare occassion when I can get my son to eat all of his dinner! Especially when there is something green added to the mix! He loved it! I changed very little from the original recipe. I used fresh Kale (which I love!) instead of spinach.  I already had it.  I added cooked onion and celery and an extra can of chicken stock... a little bit of white wine (not sure how much I just know I was about out and I used what was left).  Added the garlic powder and basil like it said. I did add some garlic salt too.  I cooked some bacon and sprinkled it on the top at the end with parmasan cheese and it was fantastic! LOVE THIS! I am cooking it again tomorrow night for a big Christmas get together with my husbands family!

I made this with a 12 oz bag of spinach tortellini and a 3rd can of low-sodium chicken broth and used fresh spinach that i had on hand (not nearly as much as the recipe called for). I squeezed the juice from several lemon slices after reading a review which stated lemon pepper was 'the missing ingredient'. I sprinkled some minced dried onion instead of using fresh onion like some suggested. This was a huge hit with my hubby, but my 2 year-old wasn't that thrilled. I will most likely be making this again as I often keep tortellini on hand!

Excellent Soup! I use fresh spinach and put carrots, celery, onions, a little garlic, parsley, and a little poached chicken with some cayenne pepper and it's AMAZING! I omit basil if I'm out ant it's still just as great!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe to a T. Wayyyyyy to bland! I would have given that three stars. What made me give this recipe four stars is the fact that it has potential and because it is a good base recipe.   The second time I made this, I used beef broth (I was out of chicken broth at the time), 1/2 T. garlic powder, 1 T. dried basil,, 1/2 T. oregano, a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, 1/2 t. ground black pepper, 1/2 t. salt, a package of tortellini, shredded carrots and zucchini, and lots of spinach (could barely taste it the first time). That tasted really good, but it was still missing that special spark that makes a recipe unforgettable. If I was in a rush to make dinner, I would make this. Otherwise, I'd follow another recipe.  Oh, and I almost forgot to mention, I would advise NOT putting the tortellini in the soup. I would cook it separately, then add it to the individual bowls. Otherwise, they soak up all of the soup.

Really good.  The only thing I would change is the amount of Spinach.  Next time I make this I would cut the Spinach amount in half.

I can see that this recipe would be a quick meal, but for me it's just as quick using my own broth (Brown Chicken Stock, from this site) and healthier.  I simmered some chicken pieces (for protein and a balanced meal) and carrots untill tender & cooked it in the broth, added some fresh garlic instead of powder and for the spinach, (I used fresh not frozen -it's better and just as quick as frozen) I added it to the last minute prior to serving and grated some fresh parmesan cheese on top! great this way!

This is five stars with the changes I made to it.  Like others I sautéed onion and garlic and omit the garlic powder.  I also add two cans of Italian flavor canned diced tomatoes for color and for taste.  Everyone loves this and it is so easy to make!

This soup was the hit of a dinner for company last night!!!  I used 2 large cloves of garlic sliced thin instead of the powder and added a small handful of shredded carrots.  It was very thick and I thought it could have used another can of broth, but my company loved it just as it was.  Can't wait to try it with fresh spinach and fresh basil.  Thanks VERY much for a first class recipe!!!

A very easy soup to make and most ingredients are already in your kitchen! Perfect for a cold weeknight. Although, I did feel like there was something missing.  Maybe next time I will try a different type of tortellini (i.e. chicken, etc.) to give it a litte more flavor.

We enjoyed this very much. I followed previous suggestions and cooked the tortellini ahead of time. I used just one box of spinach.I also added 2 cans of diced italian tomatoes. It gave this soup a beautiful flavor. Will definately make again.

With modifications, I thought this was a fabulous recipe.  I'm not sure it's similar to the original as the reviews didn't make the original worth my time.
Sauted 3-4 cloves of garlic, fresh basil, 1 chopped onion in olive oil.  Added 1 lb. mild Italian sausage, sliced zucchini, and 1 bunch of fresh spinich.  Then added 2 cans each of chicken broth, diced tomatoes, and water.  Added juice of 3 key limes and salt to taste.  Lastly, I cooked the tortellini seperately and added it when served.  Ganish with grated parmesan.
Full of flavor, easy to prepare, and my young kids are enjoying spinich and zucchini!

This recipe is not good.  You have to make a lot of adjustments.  The second time I made it I added a 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and a can of chopped tomatoes undrained along with fresh basil, and you definitely should cook the pasta separately al dente.  My version was good anyway and I will make it my way again.

This was very good but a little less spinach and little more broth would have been better.  I will definitely make again and take Lisa0208's suggestion at cooking the tortellini separately, perhaps that is why it seemed so thick.  Cut-up carrots will be a nice addition, too.  We sprinkled a little romano cheese on top.

I took the advice of some of the others and used fresh garlic along w/the garlic powder as well as fresh parsley and chicken boullion cubes. I also used pesto tortellini. Overall not bad, definitely worth trying. I felt using the whole box of spinach was a bit much. Next time I may use just a little more than half the box. I also boiled the tortellini seperately.

Awesome soup!  Used boxed tortellini and kept adding water and chicken boullion to desired consistency.  Next time I am going to try adding browned crumbled sausage for a different take on "wedding soup".  My 18 month-old loved it - nutritious.

I have made this soup several times and love it.
So far everyone who has sampled it agrees it is very tasty.  I use frozen tortellini instead of fresh and add another can of stock sometimes to stretch it or to be sure the leftovers are still soupy - otherwise it turns into more of a stew which is still equally delich!  Try it - you'll like it.

This was very good.  We cooked the tortellini separate, as some had suggested, and added it about 5-10 minutes before serving.  We also used fresh spinach vs. frozen, and added some thinly sliced carrot for color and flavor.  Very tasty and filling.

Delicious! I feel a little guilty not making this exactly as advertised...but I cooked the tortellini separate, baked up some chicken breasts (later diced prior to adding to the soup, and added a few diced carrots and mushrooms. I did not have any frozen spinach on hand, so I chopped up some fresh leaves. A few readers mentioned adding lemon pepper, but I thought the lemon was a little too strong. Overall, a nice soup with lots of add-ins possible (as evidenced by all of us that can't follow the original recipe on try one!) :P

like the others i sauteed onion and garlic. added mushrooms and carrots and since i didn't have chicken stock in the house used beef stock. i think the beef stock aided the mushrooms because it was FULL of flavor. really delicious recipe!

Instead of garlic powder, I used 4 cloves of garlic, minced and sauteed it with 1/2 a small onion. I added salt and pepper while the onions were softening up. Instead of frozen spinach, I used 3 giant handfuls of fresh spinach, chopped up, plus one can of diced tomatoes and a pinch of crushed red pepper. I cooked the tortellini separately and added them to the bowls as I was ready to serve. So good! There are a lot of spinach tortellini soup recipes out there and they all follow about the same outline. Definitely add tomatoes. Thanks for the great base!

i love this soup! it is great for entertaining (super cheep). i add a can of Italian seasoned crushed tomatoes, a pinch of red pepper flakes and sprinkle some Parmesan cheese right before eating.   also, i like to use dried tortellini (barllia makes amazing tortellini with spinach) so i add an extra cup of broth (and i use vegetable broth to make the dish vegetarian friendly)

This is EASY, I followed some of the suggestions, sauteed onions and garlic before adding the liquid and other ingredients, and cooked the tortellini seperately to keep it from getting soggy.  Simple, but good.  I would use fresh spinach if it's on hand, as I've never really liked the texture of frozen spinach--that's why it gets 4 stars.  I chopped up some tomatoes and added them for a nice extra texture.  I bet a can of tomatoes would have added a nice tanginess.  Served with generous parmesan cheese.  Comfort food!

I liked this soup but made some modifications.  The original recipe is lacking in spice or flavor. I added fresh garlic two teaspoons minced.  I used fresh spinach because I had it on hand.  I also used tortellini filled with cheese, mushroom and prosciutto.  I really liked it with the additions and will make it again for a light broth soup.

I'm a spinach and pasta freak so this was a great soup for me.  The only exchange I made was fresh spinach for the frozen.  It provided about 4 meals for me over 2 days and I still wanted more.

Like many other reviewers, and many other cooks for that matter I made do with what I have, and made some adjustments.  I sauteed fresh spinach and garlic in a little olive oil instead of using frozen.  The kids loved it!

I LOVE THIS SOUP!!! The only modification was the addition of meat. For me, I add 1 lb. cooked & cubed chicken breast. For my husband, I add 1 lb. ground & browned sausage. It is a great recipe & I seldom have leftovers - unless I double it!!

Delicious. I have made this soup several times when I needed something fast and easy that resembled dinner. I microwave the spinach right in the freezer box it comes in and boil the tortellini in the microwave. Doesn't get much easier or tastier.

This recipe is indeed easy to make, but is mediocre in flavor.

Not sure why this recipe had such good reviews.  I added extra broth and cut down on the spinach like the other reviewers advised.  I thought the soup had an awful texture and wasn't at all tasty.

This was a quick and easy soup to make- I love tortellini and used a mushroom tortellini although I think you could try it with a cheese tortellini and it would be just as good.  Great flavor-- would be good with some grilled sandwiches, says my husband!

I have made this soup many times and have not changed a thing.  It is incredibly easy and delicious.  I don't know why everyone has to feel the need to change recipes.  The only thing i do is sprinkle with parmesan cheese each serving.

I  made this soup exactly as stated but since there was about 1/4 cup more broth in the carton I used it all. It was very tasty but don't know how you could call it soup. There was no liquid left by the time the tortellini cooked so served in on a plate as a pasta dish

Loved it for several reasons.  It's quick, easy & my family loved it.  Even my 4 year old ate the spinach (Little Miss anti-vegetables).
I did the sauteing the onions & garlic thing and added my home made chicken stock, then added barely a pinch of lemon/pepper frorm Mrs. Dash.  My 7 year old declared it better than my home-made chicken soup (that's really big coming from her).
Thanks for the recipe.

So I did this recipe and added carrots and a onion like someone mentioned.  Problem was that my store bought stock wasnt very flavorful.  This posed a real problem.  I ended up adding salt but nothing helped, until I added a dash of soy sauce and the ahhhh...much better.  Anyway, I did not add too much soy sauce until it tasted like soy sauce I just added a little and it really livened up the stock.  I would do this recipe again but this time with the changes I suggested and a different brand of tortellini

This was really good. I used fresh spinach and homemade chicken broth. The addition of the cheese tortellini was excellent as it was a nice change to just plain pasta. thanks for this great recipe.

Couldn't wait to rate this - WONDERFUL!  Made a few adjustments based on previous comments - sauteed 2 cloves garlic, about 1/2 onion and portobello mushroom cap in little butter first, then added rest of ingredients.  Used fresh spinach cause I wanted to and used frozen tortellini that I cooked in the broth.  Was intending to use leftovers for lunch, but my husband ate it all last night!  Sprinkled with parm. cheese.  Might make again this week!

Super yummy soup! I've used a similar recipe that starts off with sauteing chopped bacon and chopped onion (start the bacon first) , then adding a can of diced or crushed tomatoes and a can of drained kidney beans.

I made this with fresh spinach yesterday and added fresh grated Asiago cheese.  It was so yummy.  I am going to to make it like this with the frozen spinach I have in my freezer.  I also bought the cheese tortellini at a local Italian market.  It was delicious!

I loved this soup.  I gave it 4 stars because I tweeked the recipe a little bit. I addded about 5 ounces of baby spinach instead of the frozen.  It gave the broth a real nice flavored broth.  I added one carrot and one onion sauteed in olive oil.  I also added 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning.  I added one extra can of chicken broth as the tortellini really sucks up the broth.  Very delicious.  The whole family liked it!!

Based on other reviewers comments, I decided to make this with some "upgrades" off the bat.  I added celery, onions, shredded carrots, fresh garlic and Italian seasoning.  I also used chicken bouillon for the base.  Even with those additions, I still found this somewhat bland.  I also found that this needed more liquid (the tortellini soaked up some of the broth after I combined everything).  I will probably make this again, but I still need to refine it a bit more.

This soup looks SO unimpressive...watery-looking broth with spinach leaves and tortellini floating in it, but after one bite, I was hooked! It was bursting with flavor! I did make a change...I was out of frozen spinach, so I used fresh and just eyeballed it (I know I used much less than 10 oz) and I used one clove of fresh garlic instead of the powder. The flavor of the tortellini I used was Romano Cheese and Sun-dried Tomato (YUM!) and they really complimented the flavors well. Next time I make this, I might add some other veggies, like tomatoes and carrots, but this soup is excellent just the way it is. Thanks for sharing!!!

Nice basic meal to come home to... put the broth in the crock pot with several cloves of garlic, a few shakes of dried Italian seasoning, and matchstick carrots and left it on low all day, then popped in the tortellini straight from the freezer, then added a few handfuls of fresh spinach leaves just before we ate.  Kids ate it all up, and I enjoyed it as well.

This soup was tasty, but I'm not sure if I would make it again without some more modifications (maybe some tomatoes as someone recommended). I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and also added some sauteed onion and garlic. It was a bit salty, so I would recommend a reduced sodium broth.

It was OK. It's not  something I would make to impress guests, but it's quick and easy with ingredients that I keep stocked. I've made it twice, once with homemade chicken stock and once with canned. Preferred the added saltiness of the canned for a little more flavor.

This recipe was a flop.  I added to much frozen chopped spinach and I thought it lacked flavor.  I added white wine, sauted onion, carrots and garlic.  If I ever made this again, which I doubt, I would add fresh chopped baby spinach.

This was good, with a little substitution. First, I used spinach tortellini. I used fresh spinach, not frozen. I also added some white wine and some chopped onion.

A super and easy quick soup.  Elegant, too.  It would be great for a first course for any dinner.  I used 1/2 onion and 1 clove a garlic and sauteed first before adding broth.  Boiled then added fresh spinach.  Plus, I took other suggestions and cooked the tortellini seperate and then added them in.  Omited both garlic powder and basil and it came out fantastic.  Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe exactly as stated- and it did not turn out well. After I made it I read all the reviews of people giving it 4-5 stars, and none of them actually followed the recipe- hence the better rating. The soup was too thick bc the starch from the tortellini, and it lacked flavor. I ended up washing the tortellini/spinach with water, and added some alfredo sauce... would not make again!

This was good, but really could have used more flavor.  First, my changes-- I had refrigerated mushroom tortellini, fresh baby spinach, and fresh basil.  I think using the cheese tortellini would have helped, and it needed more garlic and some more flavor.  A keeper, but I'll need to tweak it a little.  Maybe I'll update here when I find the secret.

I wasn't happy with the flavor until I decided to add a 12 oz. jar of salsa to the soup.  It turned out great.  I used meat tortellini which I did cook seperately and fresh spinach with one large onion sauted in olive oil with 2 cloves of garlic.

This was amazingly simple and good.  I did follow others' advice and kept the tortellini separate until serving, and also sauteed some onion & garlic and added it into the broth.  We devoured this and mmmmmm'd through every spoonful.  Thanks so much!!

Just okay. A good basic recipe. Next time, I think I'd add some herbs/spices and half the spinach. just a bit too much spinach and not quite enough flavor. A good start though.

I thought this recipe was simply delicious.  I had everything I needed right here at home. Since I have a little herb garden I put in fresh basil.  I gave some to one of my neighbors and she has asked for the recipe too.

I read other reviews and made adjustments. It came out really god and husband loved it!  I put olive oil in pot and added crushed garlic cloves, sauteed and then added chopped spinach.  I boiled tortellini separate and then added to broth and let it simmer.  I served with olive oil garlic toast. Thank you!!

this was definitely quick & easy. i read through the reviews first to see what people suggested. when it came time to making it, i didnt really follow a recipe - just kind of went with it. waaaaay too much spinach for my liking, i ended up removing about a quater of it. i had no fresh veggies on hand, so i added a can of diced tomatoes - i thought it added great flavor. i just seasoned it with s&p, garlic, and basil to taste. i also added some red pepper flakes to give it a kick.

This was a great soup, i didnt have basil so i used oregano instead, and also some ground italian herbs and seasoning, as well as red pepper flakes to add a bit of spice, then i squeezed some lemon juice in and tossed julienned carrots in. It was delish, oh and i used spinach tortellini with cheese filling and fresh spinach instead of frozen .

First off ... I do not like spinach. But I had a box in the freezer, did not know what to have for dinner so tried this recipe exactly.... soup was great tasting.   Hard to believe something so fast & easy to make could be so tasty.  I tried a little parmesan cheese in one area and did not care for it ... it covered up the good taste of the soup.

This was good but yet lacking something at the same time. I couldn't imagine making this with only two cans of broth--I used four and it was just about right. I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic, grated carrot and a bay leaf to broth and let simmer for about 10-12 min. Then I added spinach, then tortellini & simmered about 10 min. It was good but I feel it needs something else to make it really pop. It is good for something quick and easy. Thanks for sharing.

The amount of spinach used was overwhelming.  Maybe if I'd used fresh, and less, it would have been better.  This isn't something my family enjoyed that much.  It was "ok".

This turned out pretty well.  I used fresh spinach rather than frozen.  Also, I sauteed onion and garlic in some olive oil which I then put into the broth.  Made a really great supper, and tasted great the next day for lunch.

This was a very good base for a soup which I added more to, as others suggested. Added cooked seasoned ground turkey, mushrooms, onions, and used collard greens instead of spinach, and added tortellini before serving so that it would not get mushy. It was a fantastic, healthy, and satisfying soup. Thank you!

This soup was so tasty and light! I added a little red chili pepper to give it a kick and boiled the tortellini separately as someone suggested. I also used fresh basil and vegetable broth instead of chicken because I'm vegetarian. Thank you for this recipe.

Very good basic recipe. I did add diced portabella mushrooms and diced onions. I also went with the fresh garlic. When it was all done the wife and I enjoyed this soup.

I liked this soup. The tortellini was hearty, and the spinach added color, flavor, and nutrition. I used 3 boullion cubes instead of pre-made broth. (I didn't want to use 4 even though I could have because I was afraid it could get too salty.) I also used a larger bag of tortellini--almost twice what the recipe called for because I could not find anything smaller. I will make this again sometime as a weeknight soup. It's a super easy recipe, and the ingredients (spinach and tortellini) store in the freezer.

Great Recipe!!! However, I did make some changes. I used chicken granules in hot water instead of canned chicken broth. Also, for spiciness I added a can of green chili's. I do not reccomend leaving this in the fridge for more than a day, because it gets soggy.

Made this on a chilly spring day and it hit the spot.  Hubby loved it.  Took advice of some reviewers and added shredded chicken breast, carrots and zucchini. Used half a bag of fresh baby spinach.  Cooked the tortellini separately then added to soup to serve.  Hubby said it really brought out the flavor of the tortellini.  It's his new favorite way to have tortellini.

delish! I have to agree with cooking the tortellini first and needs more broth. The broth can be added as you reheat it though. Grated parm is a must. It melts wonderfully in the hot soup. I also put red pepper flakes on top. Next time I make it I will add little meatballs.

You could do a whole lot with this recipe, but I was looking for something really light for lunch today and this was perfect as written. I used fresh spinach, didn't have any tortellini so I used some leftover mini seashells in a pesto sauce. This was good Nicole and thanks!

This was great. I did boil a chicken and used that for broth and then shredded some of the meat into it, added some onion and tarragon leaves along with the spinach.Also added a tablespoon of chicken base.. Excellent. I brought it to a boil and then added the tortellini which then thickened the broth.. Very good. I will use this again and pass it on.. Thank-you Nicole

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and added mild italian sausage, carrots, a whole lot more water, shredded carrots, garlic and twice the basil.  The soup had good flavor after all was said and done but I think I will stick with my version if I make it again.

This soup is so easy to make.  I make it quite often.  I have tried it with both cheese and meat tortellini, and either tasted great.  I also add a bit of extra garlic powder and some poultry seasoning too.

Our local rotary club chapter had a call out for locals to submit the best soup recipe that can feed 10 people for under $10. Thanks to Alfred, our Sons’ younger friend who works for the local grocery outlet, we were able to get a great discount on nearly expired broths. Needless to say, we were able to make it work for the competition and the Rotary members loved this soup! One sour gentleman wasn’t keen on the Italian flare of the dish, rude! Sadly, the “potato wedge casserole soup”, got voted best of the bunch. We’ll still be serving this for our friends and family!

Disliked this recipe.  The soup did not look anything like the pretty picture.  The frozen spinach fell apart in the broth and the soup looked like green slop.  Every spoon full was saturated with spinach, which is all I could taste.  I used the exact amount I was supposed to use.  Not sure what went wrong here.

Delicious, and very quick and easy to make. I cooked the tortellini separately and added them at serving time to avoid them being over cooked, but otherwise a great recipe.

This is a great guide for making a delicious soup. I kept the tortellini separate and poured the soup over them at serving time. Also added parmesan at serving. As for the base, started with 1/2 lb of ground pork. (Could have used a pound.) Then removed and sauteed garlic and red onion. Added red pepper and grated carrots. A can of stewed tomatoes followed by the chicken broth. Didn't have lemon pepper so added squeezed lemon and additional pepper. Added fresh chopped spinach about the time I started the tortellini.  For those who said it was bland, it's our job to taste as we go, since it depends on how much broth is added and other particulars. Used a seasoned salt along with a bit of ground jalapeno and the basil. Really one of the most delicious soups I ever made. Thanks, Nicole!

I always rate a recipe based on making it specifically by the instructions. That being said, this was very bland and lacking. However, I will make it again and use some of the other user's suggestions: add carrots, onion, and lots more spices.

Measurements didn’t make sense. Way too much spinach! And not enough broth.

I originally made this because I had everything on hand but if I were to make it again I'd try with fresh spinach or just leave spinach out altogether.  The frozen spinach made it kinda bitter and we had a ton of leftovers that nobody ate.  I'll try it again but with the changes I mentioned.

I liked this recipe quite a lot. I added shredded chicken, mushrooms, a little oregano, parsley, and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the recipe, though. I also use fresh baby spinach instead of the frozen spinach. I use the water I boil the chicken in as the base of the soup and add the store bought chicken broth to that. It has become a regular staple in my household and is my favorite soup to eat.

Made  the following changes- melted 2 T. coconut oil (didn't have any olive) added 1 chopped onion, 6 sliced cloves of fresh garlic, 1/2 pound fresh sliced Portobello mushrooms, and 2 thinly sliced carrots, salt and pepper. Sauteed about 5 minutes, added 1 slivered basil leaf, 1 chopped fresh tomato, and 2 quarts home made chicken stock. Simmered for about 20 minutes. I boiled the frozen cheese tortellini in a separate pan for 3 minutes then drained. I put fresh spinach in the bottom of a bowl with a scoop of tortellini on top then put a few cups of broth with vegetables on top of that. Top with fresh shredded parmesan......SO Delicious!! For leftovers, I also kept the broth, tortellini and spinach separate- to be put together when ready to eat. It might also be good with a splash of white wine it, maybe some chicken or Italian sausage, etc.....Great as a base for whatever you might like in it! (I chose to keep it meatless though).

MAGNIFICENT!!! This is definitely one of the best tasting soups ever! I added some onion and celery as I usually do when making soup as well as paprika. But when reaching for the paprika I accidentally grab the Hot Mexican Style Red Pepper and practically poured it, as I usually do with paprika, into the soup. Thought it was ruined but it was fabulous and really wasn't hot at all. I will most definitely make again and again! Thank you so much for sharing!

Very good on a cold rainy night. I sautéed onions, celery and grated carrots in with some garlic. Then added the chicken broth, salt and pepper and lots of flakes of dried basil. Next time add a full teaspoon of minced garlic instead of 1/2 a teaspoon. Served with fresh baked bread. Hubby really liked it.

This was good. I used 1 tablespoon of basil pesto instead of the basil. A nice change from a regular soup I would make. I also sautéed a sweet onion and 3 cloves of garlic before adding the broth... I really feel that this soup needs that extra 5 minute step.

Simple and tasty.  I took advice from other reviewers and sauteed chopped onions, garlic, and basil first.  Then added vegetable broth, spinach and grated carrots (for color and texture).  I added the pasta at the very end and just let it simmer in the broth for about 5 minutes.  Very nice.

I'm glad I tried this recipe because it was new and different! First I saluted a bag of Pictsweet Seasoning Blend (10 oz pkg) in some olive oil for about 5 mins. I then added a couple cloves of garlic and a handful of shredded carrots and cooked a few minutes more. I seasoned with lemon pepper, black pepper, salt, and fresh basil. I then added my chicken stock and spinach. I brought to a boil and then simmered on low for 20 minutes. I cooked my pasta separately and added them to my soup before serving, as other reviewers suggested. Great flavor. Great color.

This is simple and tasty, perfect for your homemade chicken broth.  I added more tortellini than instructed which worked for us. Best served topped with freshly grated parmesan.

Really simple and delicious.  I tweaked it a bit, adding some broth from a roasted chicken, along with about 1 c. cooked chicken, fresh spinach, garlic, celery and onion, as well as 1 c. skim milk whisked with 1/3 c. flour to thicken the broth just at the end.  It's wonderful!  Enjoying it right now.  Perfect weeknight meal!

Good recipe. WAY too much spinach. I'm a spinach lover and I thought it was too much. Next time I'll use half of what's suggested. I added minced garlic and some carrots because I already had them.  The flavor was great and it was very quick and easy. Great weeknight dinner!

I made this soup as is, except I added Johnsonville chicken Italian sausage. It was very good and very healthy!! Other reviews said not to cook the tortellini in the soup because it makes it thick but I did not have that experience. I think that if you boil the tortellini in the broth for only about 5-7 minutes, it has the perfect consistency and it still cooks in the broth after you take it off of the heat. Very good, will make again!

i really used this recipe as a base. i started with a large frozen chicken breast in a crock pot with 2 cups of water, 2 chicken bouillon cubes, garlic, celery salt, and the basil on high for 6 hours in order to create the broth called for in the recipe, then just left the chicken in the soup for bulk. added fresh chopped spinach, fresh chopped basil, a few baby carrots, one roma tomato chopped, and 20 oz. tortellini with 2 extra cups hot water for another 1/2 hour. added salt. it was delicious, and no leftovers.

Quick, easy and delicious!  Will make again.  I added rough-chopped carrots for color.  Very good.

I was disappointed in this recipe as written.  If I were to make it again I would make several changes to make it taste better.
My hubby liked it though.

I also cooked the tortellini in a different pan and added as I served.  Results were good but I do thing I will add more vegetables next time.  This is a really good starting point, but it could use some more flavors. It will be fun to experiment...

This recipe was great. I double the tortellini but only because 10 oz just didn't seem like enough. I will be making this again for sure.

It was very good with a litle less tortellini, and added carrots, snowpeas, celery, onions, parsnips, or whatever veggies you like.  I also added my Mr.& Mrs. T Bloody Mary mix (like tomato juice but much more taste) for added flavor.

This was pretty good, but I wasn't jumping up or down about it. Needed a real boost of flavor, but couldn't figure out what.

We really enjoyed this soup. The only change I made was adding fresh spinach. Will make again.

I liked this recipe once I made some adjustments.  I added more chicken broth, cooked the tortellini separate to al dente, added minced garlic instead of the garlic powder and omitted the basil.  I may add parsley instead.  We all really liked this soup.  I think adding shredded cooked chicken would be a good addition also and I will probably try that.

This is a good basic recipe that needs some tweaking.  First, you need a little more liquid - so add more stock.  Also, cook the tortellini separate, so it doesnt get mushy. You can add some carrots or celery as well.  I added add'l spices at the end because it was a little bland.

I intend to make this soup again and again. I used a package of bite-sized fresh tortellini (cheese & herb), and loved what the spinach did for the soup. Quick, simple, & delicious! Thanks!

I used vegetable broth rather than chicken broth becauase I'm a vegetarian, and it still tasted fine.  I made sure to drain the thawed frozen spinach well before dumping it into the pot, and I added chopped carrots and some fresh tomatoes for additional flavor and to make it look nice.  I had many compliments on this recipie.  It's important to take the pot of the heat soon after the pasta has reached al dente, otherwise they'll fall apart and it won't taste as well.  The leftovers the next day were good too.

Not much to brag about here.  Tastless is how I sum this up.  Possibly the addition of stewed tomatoes would liven this up a bit.  I will not be making this again.
