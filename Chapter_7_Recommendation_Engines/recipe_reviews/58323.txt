Wonderful!  I've made toasted cheese sandwiches all my life, but the veggies and chili powder make them far more interesting.  I prefer using whole grain bread.

These are very nutritious and delicious and satisfying, a fell good food I should add! I spread 1 tsp Grey Poupon on 1 slice of 100% whole wheat bread with 1/4 cup of mixture (I didn't add cheese to mixture because im refrigerating the veggie mixture) then topping off with 1 slice of colby cheese. This is a grand total of 140 calories, I had 2 slices for lunch! It's yummy, im using the rest of the veggie mixture in my eggs for breakfast! Thank you for the recipe!!!

Moist, tasty and easy to make!  The vegetables and cheese combinations are endless.  I had never thought to make anything like this, so I'm glad I found the recipe!  Thanks!

These didn't have a lot of flavor, and I was disappointed in the overall taste. They were definetely crunchy, but just bland.

Delicious! You wouldn't guess that these are so yummy. I used whole grain bread, but that's just my preference. Plus super quick, afterwork I'm tired and want something quick, but healthy, these are fabulous.
