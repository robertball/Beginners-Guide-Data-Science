We loved this dish! I'm ten and I made this for my family. It was so easy to do that I would do it again every night!!!!! We did not tomato paste so we used a jar of pizza quick sauce which worked great!

I loved this!  My 6 year old daughter couldn't get enough of it.  
The only changes made were 4 cloves of minced garlic instead of 1/4 cup, and I used Parmesan instead of Mascarpone cheese (I didn't put any cheese over mine and it was still wonderful!)
My veggies were sliced about 1/8" inch thick and 45 minutes was the perfect amount of time.
We served this over brown rice to make it more of a meal instead of a side.
We have also tried this with Ricotta which was quite tasty, but Parmesan is still our favorite.  We also added thin slices of red onion and that was yummy as well.

This was awesome!! I added a considerable amount more of extra virgin olive oil than asked for and brushed the top of the slices with it as well. great summer dish!

Not sure how to rate this.  We didn't love it as Ratatoulli but I blended it up and added tomato sauce I made from our garden tomatoes, let it simmer all afternoon and served it as sauce over spaghetti and the entire family LOVED it.  "Best sauce ever mom"... don't tell the kids its the same we had for dinner last night!!

Excellent dish!! My husband and I are doing a purification cleanse and I've been searching for vegetable dishes. This is by far our favorite dish of the week. The only thing I changed was that I peeled the eggplant because the skin can be chewy sometimes, I added sliced roma (plum) tomatoes, used fresh basil instead of thyme leaves because I didn't have any and omitted the cheese because we can't consume dairy during this purification. We sprinkled red pepper flakes on top along with some fresh parsley.  We didn't miss the cheese. We served it over quinoa. We will definitely have this again long after the cleanse is over. Thank you for sharing!!

Great recipe!
Adjustments: Slice onion thin and sautee in olive oil (thank you, one reviewer). I used 2 small tomatoes and sliced them thin and used them instead of red pepper. Also omitted tomato paste, minced garlic and mascarpone cheese. Before layering sliced veggies, I tossed them in olive oil and salted them (except tomatoes). 
After taking the dish out of the oven, sprinkle with parmesan cheese and freshly ground pepper. 
Enjoy! My family loved it!

Awesome awesome. I have 10 picky kids and trying to get them to try something new is sometimes a chore in itself. I was able to use Eggplant and Zucchini from our garden and i used that and the movie as the sell. And once they tried it. It was gone. Ones that refuse to eat vegetables were asking for seconds. I myself thought it was a very delicious dish and will definately be fixing it again. It will probably  surpass the Eggplant Pamesan as one of my alltime favorites.

Great dish, good way to use up summer garden veggies. Some advice:  Make sure you salt the eggplant prior to using to draw out the moisture or the ratatouille will become wet and soggy!  Salt each side of the sliced eggplant and let it sit for 30 min, then rinse off and pat dry. If you don't have time for this you shouldn't add as much water. I used some spaghetti sauce instead of tomato paste (didn't have it) and again, did not add as much water.  1 tablespoon of minced garlic was plenty. Thanks for the great recipe!

I was really pleased to find this recipe because the Disney movie "Ratatouille" is what inspired my interest.  I didn't have tomato paste so I cooked down a can of diced tomatoes with roasted peppers.  Everything else I followed the recipe to the letter.  My husband groaned when I told him what I was cooking, but when I served it with andouille sausage and garlic toast - he loved it all!

I had never eaten ratatouille but after my daughter mentioned it I had to give it a try. I didn't do the round layering but WOW, I wasn't expecting such great mouth watering flavors! Thanks for sharing

This was absolutely fabulous, for all those veggie lovers out there.  Really, any combination of squashes, peppers, tomatoes, etc. would work here.  Obviously the recipe calls for veggies more traditionally in ratatouille, but that doesn't mean you HAVE to stick with them.  

I added salt, pepper, brown sugar and a dash of cayenne to the tomato paste/water to give it a little push.  I also tossed the vegetables with oregano and coriander.  Really, though, that's totally personal taste.  This is a great baseline recipe that made the house smell delicious all night.  Really, I will make this again and again.

Easy to make and absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe as written and everyone loved it. Now I know why the restaurant critic in the movie was remembering his childhood while he ate the ratatouille, this is comfort food. Fresh veggies, herbs yum. My daughter begged me to make it again tonight and it is in the oven. I would give this more stars if I could!!! This is a keeper.

This was fabulous!  I bought a bunch of veggies from a local farmer and this was a great way to use them.  I didn't have tomato paste so I used a can of pizza sauce.  I also added fresh garlic and basil leaves.  So yummy!!

My daughter decided she wanted this after watching the movie.  We added Turkey Polish sausage in the mix. Served it on a bed of rice.  It is beyond delicious.  So good!!

This was absolutely amazing.  I only made three changes.  I used a 9 by 13 in pan.  I added a can of fire roasted diced tomato with the tomato paste (added less water bc of this).  And I didnt have fresh garlic so I used a scant Tablespoon of garlic powder.  This was literally the best ratatoullie ever.  You have to try it.

This was so easy and delicious besides being beautiful. The left overs went well in scrambled eggs with cheese on top. 
I think I'll add fresh sliced mushrooms next time. It got rave reviews!

I changed the recipe, but didn't have a choice as I did not have all the ingredients.  My version consisted of: tomato paste, dried minced onion, minced garlic, olive oil, yellow squash, zucchini, sea salt.  I did not add water as I somehow skipped over that part when reading the instructions.  Even without the thyme, marscapone, eggplant and bell pepper, it was delicious.  I used my food processor with the slicing blade which made short work of cutting the vegetables; this also meant they were all exactly the same thickness and therefor all cooked to the same level of doneness.  I will be putting this recipe in regular rotation.  It is so pretty that I will be making it for future potlucks!

Tips:  
1) This recipe tells you to spread tomato paste evenly then add water & seasonings... Just mix the paste/water/garlic & such together and then spread it on the bottom.  
2)  Great served over couscous.
3)  Use your slicer/mandoline to make this fast food.

My husband is a meat-lover, like - where's the beef? But he really loves this, has had it several times, and I'm not sure if he's realized there's no meat in it yet.  He may think it's a french word for lasagna.  *shhhh*

Oh my garlic! Way too much garlic. I didn't like this recipe at all. I can't understand what I could have done wrong but this was not good at all. I have so many left over veggies I will try a different ratatouille recipe with the left overs.

This is fantastic!  I added some fresh sliced mushrooms, a few shakes of the red pepper flakes, and some basil (the chopped basil in a tube from the produce section) to the sauce at the bottom of my casserole dish. Then topped mine with italian herbs instead of thyme. Parmesan cheese when it came out of the oven.... simply put ...delicious!

I have made this twice now!  We had a lot of veggies from our garden to use!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly except I used parmesean cheese instead of mascarpone.  It was amazing, my kids loved it!  Then the next time, I browned some mild italian sausage and added that to the tomato paste mixture before I put the veggies in!  Even more amazing!  My husband and kids couldn't get enough of the second one!  I'm planning on making it again this weekend with a big loaf of homemade bread!  So yummy!

Me and my husband loved this recipe! I also cut down the amount of garlic (we love garlic, but that just seamed way to much even for us) I used one tablespoon of minced garlic (from the jar) I also used one cup of tomato sauce and mixed the onion, garlic, and (added) basil in a separate bowl before putting it in the dish. I used all kinds of veggies. They were all wonderful. Egg plant, red bell pepper, orange pepper, zucchini, yellow squash, Roma tomatoes, everything works! I made ours with parmesan chicken. Perfect compliment.

This was a fabulous recipe. The only changes that I made to this recipe is subsitute mascapone cheese with parmesan and mozzarella instead. I sprinkled parmesan cheese strips on top of the ratatouille. Then, I add freshly shredded mozarella to generously cover the top with 15 minutes left to melt the cheese. Overall, excellent!

Made just like recipe says although with some minor changes. I only had green bell peppers and did not have the round baking dish so I used a square baking dish. Also did not have any marscapone so used shredded mozzarella and freshly grated Parmesan. Was really good!  My daughter went back for seconds and she is not a huge fan of squash or eggplant. I lightly salted the eggplant and squash before baking and let them sit for about 20 min to draw out of some the moisture.  I also sautéed the onions and garlic as others suggested. So delicious with fresh veggies from the local farmers market!  Served it with green beans also from a local farmer and a whole roasted chicken I did in the slow cooker also from this website as I was using the oven for this dish.

Excellent recipe! I baked it for 60min to get rid of excess moisture as I added some fresh tomatoes. Don’t skip the eggplant as it provides texture and taste. And no, 1/4 cup of garlic is not too much.

My spouse wanted to try ratatouille based on the movie, so this was the recipe I had to use.  He loved it, but the kids picked out the peppers or eggplant based on preference.  I added sautéed Portobellos that I had leftover.  I liked the texture that they added.  Overall I'd say good, but I had to add extra olive oil during cooking to keep the top moist. It could benefit from more sauce but I don't know how to add it without losing the picture perfect look of the dish.

Made it for a french project and literally my ONLY childhood  dream came true 

I recommend watching ratatouille while you do it so that you can rlly channel your inner Remy 
Also just putting it out there,,, Remy making the Ratatouille and Ego taking a bite of it is my absolute favorite movie scene everrrr

For ours we doubled the ingredients

My kids typically refuse to eat summer squashes. They LOVED this dish! Luckily I have a mandolin which made the veggies very evenly sliced. I substituted a really good marinara for the tomato paste, and added fresh sage and oregano to the thyme sprinkled on top. I also added some Parmesan during the last 15 minutes. Can't wait to make it again.

This is, without a doubt, the best ratatouille recipe I have ever had & I have tried many. It is worth the time you prep. It's bloody GORgeous! I get requests for heaven's sake! Did not change a thing: No omissions, no additions. This recipe stands alone.

I made this twice once with Italian sausage mixed in with the paste and the other without. The ratatouille without the meat tasted way better. It's a very affordable recipe under 10 dollars.
The adjustments that I did was use a 16ounce tomato paste. I also but the tomato paste, garlic, onion,salt, pepper, water and olive oil in a bowl to mix . Then I put it in the pan. Instead of putting the peppers in alternation I cut them into small pieces(onion like for tacos) and I put them on top of the zucchinis and eggplant. I also used Parmesan cheese instead of mascarpone

This  recipe is truly delicious. But be forewarned, it's time consuming. If you don't have a 'Mandolin' to help make precise slices, the chopping did take a long time, but it is easy for little hands to help put it together once everything is chopped. I highly recommend sauteing the onions and garlic first. Also, I used minced garlic from a jar and only added a quarter teaspoon since I need to account for a garlic allergy in my house, but otherwise this recipe is great. I noticed other reviewers used other red sauces they liked instead of using this recipes method of making your own, and I'm sure that'll speed up the whole process of getting it to the table, but have to say that this recipe's tomato sauce is very bright and fresh as is, and will not have the same feel of very fresh, bright tomato and herbs if you use a canned sauce. Plus, using tomato paste adds to the consistency of the dish. My guests loved how the sliced veggies were easy to cut and gather with only their forks, everything was cooked evenly, and no one complained that there were "two different (bad) tomato flavors" going on. I did not find an eggplant that was 'small enough' to match the dices of my other veggies, so I just layered the rest, and it was not missed! I used a 9x13" glass baking dish and it turned out beautiful. I'll probably add a 1-2tsp. sprinkle of white sugar the next time I make it to see if this helps cut down the acidity of all the tomato in this dish. Maybe it'll help mellow it out and

I really liked this! I actually made it ahead of time and then put it in the oven the next day with some parmesan to reheat and it was even better! I added some "Italian seasoning" to the saucey bottom as well as on top. Other than that, I didn't make changes. Great recipe!

I have been looking for a ratatouille recipe that yields actual ratatouille after the baking process. Most, if not all of the ratatouille recipes I have tried look fine before they go into the oven. However, afterwards they always come out of the oven transformed. Anyways I recently bought a new oven and made this fabulous recipe! Happy to report I am eating proper ratatouille tonight. Thanks!

This was very good!  To speed up the preparation, I used my little food processor to chop the onions and the garlic and I used a mandolin to slice the vegetables. I also didn't have tomato paste, so I used tomato sauce and did not include the water. It tasted great! The addition of marscapone cheese on top of the dish was also very good.I was a little worried that there would be too much garlic but the 12 cloves tasted great.

I cook this every week, it has become a favorite!  I double the tomato paste, and the zucchini and squash, so I cook it in a 9x13 pan to have enough room.   I have tried the mascarpone, which is good, but have found low fat Philly cream cheese is even more tasty.

I didn't know what to think about the recipe at first... My kids are all very picky eaters and I thought I'd be the only one eating.  What a pleasant surprise!! I can't believe we never had this before!! Everyone loved it! One change we made was adding pepperoni to the mix (and lots of it!) which made it all the better.  This is a must have!

I love this recipe - but I used only a tablespoon of minced garlic and heavy on the thyme. It works great with just eggplant, zucchini and squash or tomatoes, really any vegetable.  Also, I cut the eggplant first and set aside after rinsing and sprinkling with salt to release the bitter taste.  Delicious!

While this wasn't a bad dish, I felt that it would be better as a base for a veggie lasagne or something. Also, I think it would make a good soup (processed) as another reviewer mentioned. Anyway, I will try making into something else next time. Fun to make though.

Great veggie dish but those in my house need a bit more muscle (meat).  Fantastic recipe regardless.

Husband and I LOVED this one.  Replaced red bell peppers with sliced roma tomatoes and added a little basil and olive oil drizzle over the top.  Goes great with a little bit of sour cream instead of marscapone.

I might make it again, but next time add like a ground beef bottom to it because I needed some meat lol. It was awkward cutting the eggplant and squashes to be equal sizes given eggplants get wider towards the base and zucchini and yellow squash are rather even.

Delicious! Even my one year old loves it! I added sliced tomatoes to it and served it with pasta and a mix of Parmesan and mozzarella instead of mascarpone.

I make this every other week now and my husband is obsessed.  also its just beautiful, total food porn.  I don't do eggplant and add sliced kielbasa sausage instead.  I also switched out the regular peppers for sliced sweet peppers but you cannot go wrong with this dish. its comfort food for sure that will cure whatever ails you.

This dish is really tasty. I did change a few things though. First, I did not add any water because the veggies release water during the cooking process. Also, I used one roasted red pepper and one green pepper. I also cut everything into bite sized pieces and mixed it all up before putting in the oven. I added Parmesan and feta cheese and put in in the oven for 5 more minutes. I served with some pearl couscous and grilled sausages. Delicious!

I made this for my family, but without the eggplant. I am a 16 year old chef and was a little intimidated by this recipe, but after trying it, it is surprisingly easy. I had trouble swirling all the veggies together, so I swirled the squash in the middle and surrounded it with the peppers. I usually don't like bell peppers, but I loved them here

Good recipe that can easily be modified with the addition of fresh herbs, tomatoes & peppers. Great looking side dish to bring to a pot luck. Vegetarian friendly and heart healthy, we really enjoyed it with slices of artesian bread to sop up the sauce.

First time I have used this recipe for the sauce, and this sauce was so easy and delicious.  As far as the veggies, in addition to looking beautiful, they tasted wonderful.  I used a regular eggplant the first time I made it, and a Japanese eggplant the second time.  Absolutely do not omit the eggplant, it adds so much flavor. I also used Roma tomatoes in addition to the peppers.  I found a great sheep's milk  feta cheese which I used instead of the mascarpone.

This turned out great. Took it to a neighborhood covered dish. Everyone loved it and the presentation. I added fresh grated Parmesan Reggiani instead of the marscapone. Will definitely make it again.

This was a big hit at our house! My husband us on a low salt diet, so I left that out and used Herbs de Provence instead of the fresh thyme. Will be making this again with all the fresh summer veggies.

This was really fun to make! I learned that you can arrange the vegetables easier than just setting them into the pan by stacking them for a while and then setting them in.

It was delicious, but produced so much waste. I had huge amounts of eggplant and squash leftover. The ingredients list needs to be more specific, as the size of produce varies wildly.

Fun alternative to a squash side dish. It was really fun because we enjoyed the Disney movie so much. Use a Mandoline slicer and budget at least an extra 30 minutes to layer the veggies if you want the same look as in the movie. It's squash, so was a little bland. Next time I will add more salt/pepper. Definitely fun, and I plan to make it again.

This was my first time making Ratatouille, and it was delicious! The only change I made was adding a Cheesy Béchamel sauce; Which is what Remmy drizzles on top of the dish in the movie. This negated the need for mascarpone cheese. I also sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top of the finished dish. 
I will definitely be making this again!

I already made it twice.  Very good  and even better with the Marscapone cheese stirred into a bowl of it.  Based on comments from someone else I set the oven about 25 F higher than what the recipe gives, I also skipped the fancy layout and just layered it randomly.

We loved this. Easy to make and pretty adaptable to ingredients on hand. I decided to throw in veggies I needed to use up. I sprinkled some chopped artichoke in with the garlic and onion, then I layered with all the vegetables listed and also included mushrooms and tomatoes. I had enough to make it again a couple days later, which just meant an easy dinner for us! I've been told I can make this anytime for dinner! In fact, my boyfriend said "it's glorious" =)

yummy and easy! added tomato slices every in the mix and sprinkled parmesan cheese before i popped it in the oven. 

I used the full amount of onion and garlic, but i think it could be cut in half. I ended up adding a bit more water to make the tomato sauce the right consistency (with so many onions).

OMG... this smelled so good as it was baking and tasted just as good! Family loved it. I did it a bit differently, sauce as written but with 1 cup of water and added fresh basil.I layered the veggies (eggplant,mushrooms, peppers,zucchini,tomato & more fresh basil- in that order. Baked with the parchment paper as written. Will be making again. Note- this is GREAT as written, I only change it to use what was on hand from my garden!

This was so delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I would probably use less garlic   Also I think I sliced the veggies a little too  thin.  It was a little  over cooked, so I will try thicker slices next time.  But overall, it looked and tasted  scrumptious!

Delightful recipe  for the summer when fresh vegetables and herbs are readily available.  I made it baked for my husband and I and saved the second two servings for the next day.  The first day I served it over pasta, and the second day over jasmine rice.  Yum!

The best vegetarian main dish you can make ! It is so delicious and so good for you ! I have made many times and enjoyed over some plain rice or couscous. I have used dried thyme for fresh couple of times and it didn't  affect the overall flavor. As long as your veggies are as fresh as possible and you use good quality olive oil, this dish will always come out full of flavor. I pick the squashes of the same thickness and use Chinese eggplant as it is the thinnest kind. For the bell peppers I just dice them.

We wanted so much to like this but it's just under-seasoned roasted veggies. I have tried the sauteed version before finding this recipe and thought the same thing. It would be an alright side dish but isn't enough to stand as the main course and needs lots of extra seasoning. It's very pretty and rewarding when you get that perfect spiral fan of colors in you dish though.

This was really, really good. I mixed the "sauce" together in a bowl instead of spreading out the tomato paste and then stirring it back up into a sauce anyways. I also had to use a 9x13 pan (and even that wasn't quite large enough for a single layer). I liked the addition of mascarpone, and would do that again.

Our family is a family of 8, so it didn't make enough for all of us. If you want to make enough ratatouille for six people or more, you need to make more than you think you do.

This was very good and fresh. We used a tube of cento tomato paste, excluded the eggplant, used mini red and yellow peppers. My girls loves slicing up the veggies, also we added fresh basil and ate it with ricotta. Bueno!

Earned every star.  Thankfully year-round availability of the ingredients makes this an anticipated meal any time of the year.

Hint:  Don't spread the initial ingredients in your baking vessel.  Mix them together then spread it on the bottom of the pan.

And when they say salt the top before cooking?  They mean generously.  First time I was light handed and wound up adding salt when it was on my plate.  Second time was heavy handed and wow, what a positive difference.

delicious! fun recipe if you love monotonous slicing (not being sarcastic). It was relaxing to me!  I doubled the recipe to make an overflowing 9x13 inch pan of this dish. I didn't have tomato paste, so i used 6oz of leftover pizza sauce and 6 oz of leftover canned tomato sauce, and just left out the water in this recipe. I could have used even more of this tomato sauce actually! I also topped everything with some cayenne and paprika before putting it in the oven. It was ready to eat in 35 mins at 375F. I served it on some orzo pasta. Would make again!

My family loved this! I'm Italian so these veg are in my wheelhouse and I often do an Italian take on ratatouille but wanted to make the pretty Pixar version :D Definitely cut the eggplant in half and salt it 30 minutes before slicing to draw out bitterness then wipe with paper towel. Only change I made was to sauté onion and garlic for a few minutes before adding and I replaced marscapone with Parmesan for the young ones. 40 minutes in I removed parchment, added parm and put back in oven so parm would crisp a bit. Second time I made it I added a sprinkle of herbed de Provence and replaced 1/4 cup of water with red wine. YUM!!!!!

I made this with tomato sauce instead of the tomato paste just as I?t is my preference. I made I?t as an appetizer by roasting slices of toasted baguette rounds and spreading the marscapone cheese and then adding the veggies. So yum!!

This is a very good "BASIC" recipe for a beginning cook for sure and the style is the only way to go !!! delightful and so glad to see an aspiring young cook to try it too!!! ... my teen and I make it together however because I am an old timer I know a few tricks and these are some good additions if you want to spice it up... as typically Ratatouille has its herbal base with fresh basil and thyme and garlic in olive oil herbal mix over top while baking... SO with that being said.. instead of tomato paste base in the bottom try a bit of change up and use  "crushed tomatoes" which I make myself if I don't have on hand by pulsing diced or stewed tomatoes with 3 oz of tomato paste ... adding that to sauteed diced onion/garlic/yellow and red peppers/ ...adding fresh or dried basil; thyme; parsley... salt and pepper... simmer while you are thinly slicing the egg plant; zucchini; yellow squash and tomato ... I also pour about a 1/2 cup Olive oil before I do anything and add 2 minced garlic cloves and fresh or dried basil; thyme and parsley and let it sit while I work... this is the topping after arranging everything... I add the red sauce to the sauteed diced veges and pour into the 9 X 13 then arrange the thinly sliced veges alternating in any order either in rounds or ovals ..drizzle my olive oil herbal mix over all  cover and bake at 375 for 40 mins uncover bake another 20 and then grate fresh parmesan and or other white cheese and let set 10 mins and serve!!! DELIGHTFUL

I made this with my three year old and we had a great time. I used a mandolin slicer for all ingredients and prepped and pre measured them while she was watching Ratatouille. When I was ready, she poured and mixed into an enameled Dutch oven to make the sauce and then I showed her the pattern and she kept up with putting the veggies around to create the dish. This was a lot of fun and definitely her biggest foray into the world of cooking!

Easy to set up, just be prepared to assemble it.  It gets easier to put together the more you make it.  This has become a favorite side dish of ours.

I love this recipe except I use butternut squash slices in it as well. Makes it a bit richer. Have also used parmesan flakes on the top which is nice. 
 I love the way it looks in the dish, Fancy! But oh so easy. I will never go back to making Ratatouille  in a pot. This tastes better too.

Looking at the recipe, I was afraid the meal would be a little bland.  The assumption was spot on.  I always follow a new recipe exactly, and modify the second time based on the results.  Based on these results, I'll look for a more complex recipe in the future.

I made this last night with a few slight adjustments. 
1: Only used enough tomato paste (one with no sugar!) to coat the bottom of the dish with a little water added. 
2: Used lots more garlic and onion in step 1. 
3: Didn't have eggplant so I used slices of red onion.
Roasted at 425 F for about 30 min, uncovered. IT WAS AMAZING. 
Hubby and my youngest even loved it, and they don't love ANY vegetables! ALSO, I did not use any cheese. Personally, don't think it needed it. I did drizzle about 2tb of heavy cream and 2 tb of olive oil over it all before roasting it.

This was good but bland in our opinion.. It looked amazing in the dish! I topped it with mozzarella instead of marscarpoon but ricotta would also work to. I also added 2 tomatoes sliced really thin tho the list of vegetables & topped it with 1 tablespoon of fresh parsley. Next time I would add some more  fresh (or dried) herbs such as basil, oregano & parsley to the tomato paste portion of this dish.  I served this over spaghetti and it did make for a very nice sauce.

I was expecting to like this recipe and not really love it but the whole family LOVED it.  The only changes I made to the recipe was that I added some tomatoes (beefsteak) from my garden in place of some of the bell peppers and used fresh basil instead of thyme.  The tomatoes stood up well since they are a "hardy" tomato which I would recommend using if you choose to use tomatoes in the recipe.  I will definitely be making this recipe again .

I've made this recipe at least twelve times and it is s fabulous presentation of the beloved dish. It strikes me a lot like how my mother made Ratatouille. My family's lay is not big on eating squash in any form but they eat this down and all seem to enjoy it. I highly recommend you try it! My only deviation is I'm a lot more free form with the oil and make sure every slice has a light coat. I like to us fresh thyme from our herb garden and will add a little basil too. Thank you for a terrific recipe!

Made it following directions exactly--came out great. It does take awhile to make however. I used a slicer to get the vegetables really thin and it saved me a lot of time. My family was hesitant to try it since it's a strictly veggie dish but they liked it anyway. Next time I'll use sour cream and marinara sauce to hide the "healthy" taste for them.

This recipe is awesome but I think it needs a bit more herbs to add more earthiness. I did a couple of minor mods - added thinly sliced mushrooms layered after the eggplant, and one layer of thinly sliced fresh tomatoes with drizzled balsamic at the top. Next time I may add another layer of tomatoes in-between. I had two layers of everything and I think perhaps it needed a bit longer baking. However, it tasted amazing (I'm just a picky tweaker :P). Thank you for providing this super recipe!!! Much appreciated by myself and my satisfied eaters.

Lots of flavor with the tomato paste garlic onion sauce.  Added sliced tomatoes.  Hubby was skeptical due to egg plant.  But there sre so many other flavors to mask the egg plant, and he loved it.

As with most recipes your going to make adjustments based on taste. This recipe was an awesome start on making a beautiful dish...
I didn't have any paste, so I used a small can of tomato sauce and mixed in some garlic and sauteed onions. I tossed all my veggies with olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano, parsley, and basil, then arranged them in a round glass pan. I had a few garden fresh tomatoes, so I poked them in also. Then sprinkled salt, pepper, oregano, basil, & parsley on top. Did the parchment paper and roasted for almost an hour. It was amazing and I'll definitely make it again.

Followed the recipe exactly.  It was wonderful!!!  I have always been lukewarm regarding Ratatouille.  Now I realize that I have never had the "real thing".  
The dollop of mascarpone put it over the top.  
Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  It is going into the rotation!

I'm Dutch and I have no idea how much  6 ounce tomato paste is...If I turn on from us to metric...it still says 6 ounce...So I looked it up and it is 170 grams.  
I'm not sure about the mascarpone...doesn't really add someting to it except calories. I'd go for grana padano or parmesan for more taste. I very much loved this dish!!!

This tasted sooo good!!!  I used a 9x13 pan so doubled the sauce part of the recipe only scaling back on the garlic, personal preference.  Baked it for an hour mainly because I forgot about it as I was multitasking but it turned out wonderful. My teenage son loved it too so I will be making this again for sure!!

This was fantastic!   I made basically no changes except for doubling, and baking in a large lasagna dish.   In the 1st paragraph of instructions,  it's a little confusing where it says to "stir in" the olive oil and water.  Here's what I did, and it worked wonderfully:  spread tomato paste in dish, evenly sprinkle garlic and onion,  mix olive oil into water then quickly and evenly pour water/oil mixture over the whole dish.   Then salt and pepper and the rest as instructed.   Highly recommended!   Even for kids.  ;)

This was really really tasty.  My family loved it and it turned out very pretty.  I made it with steamed jasmine rice and substituted the Marscapone with a mixture of riccota, sour cream, salt and parsley.  Worked really well.

This dish smelled amazing and was very colorful. The taste however wasn't that great. It may have been the fact that most of the ingredients were out of season, so I will try it again this summer.

Really liked this recipe. I altered the vegetables a bit and couldn't find mascarpone cheese so I just added grated parmesan and that tasted good.

I changed this recipe a little bit but I loved it. First I did not have the eggplant or peppers, so I just used more zucchini, squash and onions. Instead of tomato paste on the bottom, I used a liberal amount of vodka sauce to give it a sweeter taste at the end. When there was 5 minutes left in the oven, I took it out sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top and it was so good. Not your typical ratatouille taste, but a delicious dish! I drizzled some olive oil on the top of the vegetables as well. Lastly, I left it uncovered. Very good, recommended it to all my friends (healthy alternative to pastas). Cannot wait to try again!

I made this without the eggplant and it was super good. My husband liked it and he is not a healthy dish kinda guy. He  asked me to make it again for our next dinner party.

Excellent, easy recipe. A little time consuming. But, easy once everything is cut. I cheated and used my Cuisinart with the slicing blade. I was a little worried about all the veggies in this. Fortunately my family really liked the movie and were somewhat intrigued by this dish. they all loved it and asked for more. I did take a few liberties, I used my own tomato sauce and added onion rings and mushrooms to the layers. Served over polenta rounds and topped with quenelles of mascarpone, with rounds of french bread on the side. Really impressed though, 3 out of 4 of my children and my wife are extremely difficult with their veggies and really don't like squashes at all. But, this was a hit! All gone, no leftovers!

I used canned diced tomato and tomato sauce in lieu of the tomato paste and water. Added a layer of sliced mushrooms and several large hand fulls of shredded Parmesan cheese. 
Served with dollops of ricotta instead of mascarpone. Oh and roasted garlic from the deli section of the grocery. 
Whole assembly took a while, and I cooked it an hour because of the extra ingredients. This is the first vegetarian dish my kids (teenagers) have gobbled up without complaint. I baked it in a 10 x 13 dish and 5 people ate the whole thing. I had enough sliced veggies left to create another one because Aldi sells squash in 2 packs. 
Smells wonderful when cooking and comes out of the oven very pretty. Will definitely make this again. I don't think you can screw it up, just use what you have and don't scrimp on salt.

All ingredients went well together, but slicing the veggies "thin" made for very soggy veggies and ratatouille needs to be done with a little firmness.  I've made ratatouille many times with many different ways, and this one has great flavor, just  sogged out my veggies. I should have sliced a little  bit thicker for firmness so no sogginess. Great recipe otherwise.

Loved this!  I used my mandolin to slice the veggies. I did not need 1/4 cup of garlic and only used 4 cloves.  I also added a drained can of dice tomatoes with the tomato paste.  After the dish came out of the oven, I sprinkled Parmesan cheese.  I served it on top of Parmesan flavored couscous.  So good.  Italian sausage would be a good compliment but my husband an I enjoyed this without meat.

This is one of my favorites.  My teens are not big vegetable eaters but they love this!!  This recipe is the only recipe I have been able to eat eggplant.  Otherwise I'm not a big fan of eggplants texture.  The only thing I do different is put a few boneless thicken thighs on the top layer to make a one dish main course.

This was so yummy! I didn't have the full 1/4 cup of garlic so I didn't a bit more than an 1/8. Wish I had done the whole thing. We put it on top of rice with a marscapone substitute that I made & mixed it all  up! It was delicious! My husband who hasn't like the last Ratatouille thought it was good & my kids ate without complaint

I was really surprised at how well this came out! I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and tweaked the recipe as follows: first, I sauteed the onions (thinly sliced not chopped) with the garlic and olive oil before adding to the tomato paste & water mixture. Note: I only used 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic from the jar instead of the 1/4 cup--next time I will use a full tablespoon. Second, I purchased a handheld mandolin slicer from a local store for about $10 and used that to cut my veggies evenly. The slicer made quick work of the veggies, and the most time consuming part was the layering. But it turned out great! My boyfriend who is not a fan of vegetables ate most of the dish, and requested it be made once a week! Thanks!

This is good on its own, but my kids &  I like it tweaked even better.  I use a Mandoline to thinly slice the veggies, then I thinly layer (eggplant, yellow squash, zucchini, onion, red pepper, then repeat) with several layers of each as I lay them out.  The thin slices help it cook more quickly & you really don't need much sauce.  I sub Prego Merlot Marinara for the sauce on the bottom, drizzle EVOO over the top, sprinkle with dried Thyme (I rarely measure herbs), then sprinkle/gently insert shaved Parmesan throughout the layers & lightly over the top.  I cover with foil, then bake for 30 minutes, then take the foil off & bake for an additional 15 minutes.  The kids LOVE this dish and there was none left...that is like a miracle with my veggie avoidant son ;-).  Very good and will definitely add to my "Keeper" recipe file!  12/30/16 I had company for the holidays and made this one evening with Maple Glazed Salmon from this site.  I was in a hurry, so I mixed the sliced veggies with olive oil & seasonings (I am liberal with the thyme & garlic), then spread out in a shallow pan with a thin layer of marinara on the bottom, then added shaved parmesan throughout, tucking it into the veggies throughout the dish.  It turned out great without all the fuss of layering & still looked very colorful & festive...there were no leftovers.  The layering takes a long time, so if you are in a hurry, you should consider this option.

Delicious and beautiful! I was worried it would be too much garlic, but the sauce was fabulous when soaked up by a baguette. This will be a favorite way to use up CSA vegetables.

My kids loved it! A few tweeks: I added thinly-sliced tomatoes in the sauce and less water, fresh basil, and 4 garlic cloves instead of the minced garlic.

My 10-year-old wanted to try "the Ratatouille from the movie." I was excited to find this recipe, and double-excited that it was so easy. My daughter helped with everything, which made a big difference when it also came time for her to try it. (She is a self-proclaimed vegetable hater, much to my chagrin.) She didn't exactly like it, but she TRIED it. And I'm certain she'll help make it again as both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

We use to have this place in town that served an amazing ratatouille baguette, which sort of turned it into an open faced sandwich with some pesto, it was amazing. Unfortunately they closed down some time ago, but I've been craving it for a while so I decided to finally use this recipe. This recipe was so easy and it turned out so good! I can't wait to make this again.

It's all gone! My family loved it.
I had a purple eggplant and a white eggplant and only  1 large tomato and some sliced baby Bella's so I made those swaps/additions but otherwise exactly as it is here. Absolutely delicious and the small drop of marscapone added the perfect touch of creaminess. It also looks beautiful. About 10 minutes before done I checked on it. Some pieces stuck out and looked less cooked. I lightly pressed them into the juices and replaced the parchment. Came out beautifully. Served with turkey kielbasa and rosemary bread. New family favorite.

This was great! I'm making more of an effort to eat vegetables and this had such good ratings and so many comments that picky kids liked it I decided to give it a try. My vegetable loving husband said it's a definite 4.5-5 stars and I surprised myself and really liked it too! I sautéed the onions and garlic as some reviewers recommended and then added tomato sauce and some shakes of garlic into the sauce. I then poured that into the bottom of the 10x10 pan. I also salted the eggplant slices and let them sit on paper towels while I used my mandolin to slice everything else so I could extract some moisture from the egg plant. Overall it felt like it took forever to slice everything but it's a great dish I'll be making again.

This was so good!  Don't forget the marscapone cheese.  I had tried to wing this on my own but this is now my go to recipe.  I did saute the onions and garlic ahead and used 2 8oz cans of tom sauce with approx 1 tablespoon of paste and it was incredible.

Delicious! My daughter requested it and loves it! Unfortunately, I had no tomato paste and used tomato sauce wich wasn't too pleasant. Next time I will use homemade sauce. I also only had dried thyme so I spread it over the sauce instead of over the vegetables. Lastly, I used parmesan over it instead of marscapone. I

So yummy! I sautéed the diced onions and garlic in olive oil before mixing it with the tomato paste and added garlic salt and salt and pepper on top of the vegetables with some olive oil, yum! Served over some rotini pasta (I used Japanese/Chinese eggplant because it's more long and narrow than regular eggplant)

It was great!  I followed this recipe to the tee (minus adding shredded parm cheese on it as soon as it came out of the oven) and my father and I went back for seconds and were so full!  I put it over a tiny little ball pasta and that was perfect.  I had garlic bread on the side which was a perfect pair.   I cooked the pasta with a bit of chicken stock and it was a good decision.  Overall I would make this again and the rest of my family, who are quasi picky, would also love this vege dish.. THANK YOU FRANCE :)

Really enjoyed this! I only used a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic (and I really like garlic)...1/4 cup would be too much. I also sauteed onions before adding to the sauce. I made with yellow squash, zucchini, red bell pepper, Roma tomatoes, a Portobello, and pepperoni. Served with yellow rice. My 7 yr old that eats like a bird is working on her second helping as I type! And it passed the husband test due to the pepperoni.

Made this as written and found the garlic to be overpowering, it was all we could taste. Served over lentils as a main dish.  I would try it again with much less garlic, as we enjoyed the tender flavor of the vegetables and my husband said "it looks like art" upon seeing the dish come out of the oven. I can see, however, that it would be delicious pureed and turned into a sauce (with much less garlic)

Easy to make, tastes great, not much else to say.

Those who are complaining about too much garlic or not enough time to cook must be lousy cooks. If you know you don't like a lot of garlic; don't put as much in there. Also, oven temperatures fluctuate and vicariously the cooking times do as well.

This is an awesome meal !!!!  Although it is delicious without the cheese, the mascarpone cheese gives it that "cherry on top" touch that makes it even better.  It is an excellent meal for anyone doing a Daniel Fast.

Surprisingly delicious! My husband and I just started clean eating and decided to try something we've never had. Great by itself, we did notice the cheese makes it! It took some searching in the store to find the cheese but it's worth it. Next time I will double the batch.

made a few changes with the garlic, no cheese or thyme. This did turn out to be a success even without the thyme and cheese.  Do plan on making it again :)

My ability to follow a recipe is about as good as my ability to listen to a political debate. Needless to say, I basically followed it but instead of tomato paste which I hate, I used ragu sauce and even added it on top after layering veggies and it was great. I also added fresh basil and mozzarella on top as well as some Cajun seasoning. It was yummy.

I will definitely be making this again. I didn't use any cheese or thyme, but kept everything else the same. Since I bought pretty big veggies I used a 13 x 9 pan, but kept the base layer ingredients in the same amounts. I also sprinkled the bottom and top layer with some cayenne pepper for a little extra kick :)

I accidently wrote down green bell pepper instead of red bell pepper, but it was still good! Also had to find a substitute for the cheese using heavy cream, sour cream, and cream cheese. It turned out so good!

This did not take me 45 min to prep and it was delicious and so pretty! I left out the peppers and added more zucchini and squash but only because I don't love bell peppers. I'm sure if you like them they'd be good. Definitely a keeper.

It was a good healthy side dish and my boys ate it up. Added tomato and omitted the red pepper (not my favorite), didn't have marscapone cheese so sprinkled with Parmesan.  Served over crusty bread and was a hit with my husband. Personally, I thought it was like veggies in marinara sauce, but liked the fresh garlic. Fun dish to make with kids. I think they love it because of the movie, but what ever makes them eat veggies is good!

We love it!  I added a couple of things.  I used fresh basil and oregano from my herb garden in the tomato mixture, and I layered the pan with mushrooms before I added the zucchini, squash and peppers.  I omitted the eggplant (didn't have it and don't like it) and used dried thyme.  This is really fresh and hearty.  I served it over brown rice because I'm not a pasta fan.  This tastes and smells amazing!

My 12-year-old daughter made this all by herself and wow! She omitted the eggplant, which another family member hates, so maybe it wasn't the most authentic Ratatouille I've ever eaten, but it was perhaps the most delicious! She did say slicing all the vegetables was a lot of work, but it was so unbelievable great, I hope she will make it again.

I also added thyme to the tomato paste, used about 4 cloves garlic rather than 1/4 c, and added less water.  Really liked it with no add'l water as well.  need to cook a bit longer.

My 11 year old made this with me and she had a blast layering all the veggies, we added a little more olive oil, we used tomatoes from the garden which I pureed with fresh garlic instead of tomato paste.  It was wonderful!!!  we made this in a 13x9 inch pan but so glad we did, it was a HIT!!!!

It was flavorful. The roasted veggies tasted good with the creamyness of the mascarpone. It was a bit dry though. The 2nd time we doubled the sauce and used the other half to top it along with the mascarpone.

I loved the strong garlic flavor! However, for someone about to hit an interview or sing in the choir, I would defeinitely recommend cutting the amount used for this recipe. The only thing I changed was I added pepperoni and salami in there to give it a full meal- feel. I also would recommend adding Basil, orageno, and parsley to the sauce pre-cooking. Gives a lot of Italian flavor. Great dish!

It's delicious! I didn't have eggplants and don't like using tomato paste, so I changed the following: sliced up a large tomato and arranged it on top of the sauce mixture base.

Awesome.  I was trying to figure out what to do with excess zucchini and made this without the eggplant and yellow squash.  I would never have thought to pair Marscapone cheese but it was great! I didn't have marscapone so instead of a trip to the store I blended a box of cream cheese, 1 tbsp fresh squeezed citrus (I happened to have grapefruit) juice and 1.5 tbsp sugar until smooth and used that. To die for. Fresh thyme a must! Go for the full 1/4 cup garlic, it's a perfect amount.

This was amazing and so simple.  I substituted white wine for some of the water.  I also substituted another summer squash for the eggplant (my daughter is allergic).  I served it with whole wheat rotini tossed with salt, pepper, parsley, and mascarpone.  My daughter's only complaint was that I didn't serve it so it looked like the ratatouille served in the Disney movie.  We all enjoyed it!

Um, wow. It's amazing how good this is for such a simple recipe. It is very forgiving ....like others, I added tomato but didn't have yellow squash, etc.. The tomato paste and parchment paper is key. The adults had it over couscous; the kids had it over toast. OMG ... a new favorite.

Awesome recipe. Both looks and tasted great. I made it once for myself, and another time to bring to a dinner, and everybody LOVED it. I never served with the Mascarpone, don't think it's needed, great by itself. The combo with couscous is really good.

We have tried a couple different ratatouille recipes but this is our favorite.  Love it.  We are definitely carnivores but this is one vegetarian dish we can stand behind and serve proudly

EXCELLENT RECIPE!! I loved this! I followed a previous poster's advice on dehydrating the eggplant with a little salt a half hour before cooking. i also salted the tomato paste to cut some tartness then added a bit more salt to the top... was careful not to over salt. served with mascarpone on top of toasted french bread.

I pretty much followed the recipe exact. I thought it was very tasty and the vegetables came out great. I served it over pasta.

Freaking LOVED it. Just had to add cooked ground hamburger meat in the paste/water mixture so the man would eat it. He even enjoyed it. Re-heat the leftovers in the oven!

Yum!  I used tomato slices and an extra eggplant in place of the yellow squash.  and stayed with 4 cloves of garlic.  I was amazed at the flavor with the minimal seasonings.  I made two dishes worth and barely had a helping left at the end of the meal with guests.

surprisingly flavorful. i really enjoyed the process in making this dish as well as the end result. the thought of seasoning pre-made tomato sauce hadn't crossed my mind before but it did turn well as the flavor was greatly enhanced. however i was forced to change the recipe when my yellow squash mysteriously walked off and i used mushrooms to fill that vegetable gap. And it worked out swimmingly!

This was amazing! Made as a veggie side for a steak dinner.  Smells heavenly while it is baking.  Does not need the marscapone. Just some crusty bread.  Will definitely make again when the Farmer's Market is up and running.  Used basil, garlic, oregano tomato paste and eyeballed the fresh garlic (still used quite a bit).  Dried thyme but otherwise followed as written.

Absolutely loved it!  I didn't have tomato paste so I used marinara sauce instead and used spinach stuffed ravioli instead of rice.

I am so happy I found this recipe! I have been wanting to try this since seeing the movie Ratatouille and it was great! We actually watched the movie the night we ate this and my kids thought it was a lot of fun plus they ate something that is healthy.  I am a vegan so I substituted dairy free mozzarella for the mascarpone cheese. We are making it again tonight!  It would be a great meal to make for a buffet at a party, because it is easy, it looks pretty, and you can make a lot at once.

My family loved this recipe. I ended up with a lot more extra veggies than I anticipated so I made a second batch of the tomato paste mixture and put it on top of the first layer of vegetables and then piled on the extra veggies. I added oregano, Italian seasoning, and a pinch of crushed red pepper in addition to the thyme on top. I baked as instructed and it turned out great. I used parmesan and it was more delicious than the mascarpone in my opinion. I put it on Angel hair that I tossed in olive oil, made an olive oil/balsalmic vinegar dip for a fresh baguette I bought and it made a great meal!

I used my cast iron skillet to sauté chopped red onion, 4 cloves of minced garlic and tomato paste. Instead of water I added a splash of sherry to pan and over heat reduced slightly. Then off the burner I spread the paste mixture evenly and layered zucchini, Italian eggplant, pattypan squash and tomatoes liberally marinated in EVOO. Followed directions as instructed at this point. Like other reviewers I added fresh basil and Parmesan before serving.  Flavors were rich and intense! Great way to use late summer vegetables.

I've  made this recipe several times and it is always delicious.  When I am cooking for myself I don't get too fussy with the careful layering, but it would be beautiful for a dinner party if I did take the time to do that.  I take leftovers to work and everyone is jealous.

After seeing the movie a few times my kids wanted to know what Ratatouille was...and I was kind of curious myself. I looked at a couple of recipes and then tried this one...and haven't felt the need to try any others. Yummy, colorful, healthy, inexpensive. Any questions?

Way too much garlic and not enough cooking time. Following the time stated my veggies were still crisp. I increased the cooking time by 20mins. Next time much less garlic needed.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I love the way the flavors of the different roasted vegetables combine, and its really fun and pretty to make. I usually add sliced mushrooms, and sprinkle the top with whatever cheese I have on hand instead of buying mascarpone.

This recipe was simple and absolutely delicious. I followed this recipe to the T except I only used 5 cloves of garlic. 1/4 a cup would have been far too powerful for me. Other than that an amazing find.

One of the best meals I've made for myself in a long time. So easy to prepare and so healthy. The only thing I changed was that I used parmesan cheese instead. Now I'm going to go and watch the movie again :)
This is going in my recipe box for sure!

My husband and I made this recipe and watched the movie. Upon careful review of the movie, I believe the recipe was supposed to include sliced tomato rather than bell pepper (are you detecting a hint of nuttiness?). However, we made this exactly as described in the recipe and it was wonderful! I can't wait to eat the leftovers and can't wait to try this recipe again and experiment with it. The dollop of mascarpone on top really made this for me.

Nice way to clean the fridge of all the fall veggies. We liked this but didn't care for the mascarpone with it. Suspecting this ahead of time I took half out at the end and did one half with mascarpone and the other sprinkled with liberal amounts of grated parm.  We much preferred the parm but that was just our taste. Either way, this is a keeper. Thanks Julz226!

I sautéed the onion and garlic before adding to the dish. Otherwise I followed the recipe and the results were delicious. My husband and sons loved this dish, even my picky toddler who only tasted it because he loves the movie. I will definitely make this again!

We absolutely love this recipe! This was my first time making ratatouille at home and it was amazing. While I did add heirloom tomatoes to this recipe, I'm sure it would have been just as good without them. The recipe is perfect as is!

Easy, healthy, and tasty! I did skip the cheese at the end because my husband doesn't like creamy-type cheeses, and I sprinkled some sliced mushrooms on top because I needed to use them up, but otherwise followed the recipe as written and it was excellent.

Great recipe!!! Followed a few of the suggestions left by the reviewers such as sautéing the onions first, but overall it was great!!!  Found another recipe to go with our beloved couscous. :)

This is a better tasting ratatouille I have tried. But next time, I might blend the tomato paste with water then pour it over the arranged veggies. As is, the veggies only get a little bit of the tomato sauce.

Thanks!

This was excellent.  My kids loved it!  I had bought to many veggies so I wound up with a double layer, but it still came out great.  Served over cous cous, delicious!

This took an hour to make and 45 minutes to bake, but it was well worth the effort!  My husband and I wanted to try it since we saw the movie and we couldn't get enough!  I think for next time, I will buy a jar of pre-minced garlic to save time.  Also we forgot the yellow squash, but it was still delicious!

This recipe was disappointing.  The flavor was not as good as ratatouille that I've made before in the more traditional way (like a simmered stew).  It's a shame--I was hoping that this recipe would come out as good as Remy's!

This was amazing!  Even my super picky eater who wouldn't normally touch most of these veggies loved ti.  She ate 4 servings and asked me to make it again and often.  I did use Parmesan instead of Marscapone because it's what I had on hand and it was delicious.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It's a keeper!
