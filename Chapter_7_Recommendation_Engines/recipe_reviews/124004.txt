Okay so I'm the first one that won't make this again.  Loved the idea, ingredients, ease to prepare overnight and bake later and even using frozen blueberries but I think it was missing something.  I guess I prefer a traditional sour cream/brown sugar/butter coffee cake.  I enjoyed the blueberries on top and I put the leftover blueberries on top of the leftover cake before I refrigerated it (recommended by another rater).  However, there were leftovers and I only made 1/2 of the recipe.  Again, great idea but I will not make this one again.

So so so good.  Made this for work and EVERYONE loved it! So many people requested the recipe that I just posted it on the bulletin board.  Made it the night before & cooked it at 375 for 30 minutes then turned it down to 350 for another 15 minutes.  Perfect! Didn't change a thing.

Rich and Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and the result was very good. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because, I didn't really care for the pecans.  I think next time I will leave them out.

I made this for our Easter breakfast at church and it was very well received! Everyone loved it and was talking about it. Leftovers re-heated in the microwave are also delish. Highly recommended!

My husband and I feasted for days! Who would have thunk that sausage and blueberries would create such a delicious combination. We skipped the topping (who needs the extra calories) and kept it in the fridge. Lasted for 4 days until we devoured the last piece.

Had a "best" family breakfast, but this has been voted the new favorite. Cut the recipe in half for 6 people and cooked in an 8 x 8 casserole.  Should not have halved the sauce, as it was not enough by about 2 portions - we got 9 squares. Used fresh blueberries. Used pam to grease the dish and used lowfat plain yogurt for half the sour cream amount, as that is what we had on hand.  Did not bother with the pecans and used Jimmy Dean's lowfat sausage.  This is an excellent recipe and we will be having this again.  Thank you, Peggy, for a recipe even hubby, who doesn't care for blueberries, enjoyed.

I made this for a family get together breakfast. It was very good! There wasn't a crumb left. The kids didn't care for the sauce, but everyone else loved it! I doubled the sauce recipe and it was just enough. The sweet & salty taste was a perfect blend & the pecans added an extra something to it. In my opinion definitely a must try. It sounds "so-so" but was very good. Follow the recipe exactly & enjoy with a cup or coffee or hot tea!

My children are deeply resistant to new recipes, but they snarfed this down like ravening wolves.  It was just as big a hit with the adult set.  I think it would have been just great without the sauce, but the that was quite tasty, too.  I realize that it sounds a little strange, but the sausage-blueberry-cake combination was ridiculously yummy.  This one is going on a card on the first try - a rare thing at our house.

Cooks up quicker than many other recipes for blueberry coffee cake and is a winner with or without the sausage.

A hit with even my pickiest eater.

My family and I make this at least once a year (usually around Christmas) as a special treat everyone enjoys.

This is something my mom has made for breakfast for quite a while now.  I love this recipe, especially since it can be made ahead, refrigerated, and cooked the next morning.

This has been a hit every time I have made it - most recently, my college-freshman niece requested it for our holiday gathering.  So great. A little different than your traditional breakfast casserole/coffee cake!
