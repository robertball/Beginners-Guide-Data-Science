This was a great side tonight with our pork chops. I started it earlier today and left it alone until time for supper. We really enjoyed the flavor and texture of this dish. I omitted the basil altogether (no one here really cares for it) and gave the kids the option of Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese. I also laid the tomato and bacon out in bowls so that everyone could pick and choose their toppings. I think it all went great together but the rest of the household liked it minus the tomatoes. Great dish and perfect for cooking with the slow cooker liners :)

I too don't think the bacon, tomatoes and basil were necessary.  Other than adding color for the picture! Next time I think I'll add some diced green chilies and use pepper jack cheese. A great potluck dish.

I made this for dinner when we had all our 'little eaters' here.  I served the tomato and basil on the side & I could have just omitted them altogether.  This is rich and delicious and clean up was a snap using the slow cooker liners.  I am thinking this would be good to make while RV camping when we do the Pot Luck dinners.

This recipe is perfect for putting on the counter while you're watching football on Sundays (and tastes good even if your team loses!)  We don't eat a lot of meat so I left out the bacon.  To give it a bit more "oomph" however, I added in some squash to give it some more substance.  My tomatoes were done for the season so I didn't' get to top it with those but my husband loved it and ate it with a grilled cheese sandwich for a twist of soup and sandwich.
It made the house smell lovely and of course anything in the slow cooker makes me happy.  Great fall (or anytime really) recipe! 
Also, since it's just the two of use, I halved the recipe and had plenty for leftover lunches.  Yum!
