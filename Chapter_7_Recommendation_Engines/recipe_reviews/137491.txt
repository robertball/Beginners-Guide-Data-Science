This was tasty and looks very fresh and appealing when it's done.  It has a bit of a sour taste but not overpowering.  I didn't change anything except for adding a small handful of slivered almonds to give it extra textrue and it was a nice side dish to salmon.  This can be eaten cold the next day if you have left overs and it still has a very good taste, or you can add it to some fresh greens to make a salad.

This was excellent! I made a few changes, including using apple cider vinegar in place of rice vinegar. I used Italian herb seasoning as I had no dried oregano. I used half a red onion, five cloves of garlic, four of those small sweet multicolored peppers from the supermarket, and it was delish! Thanks for the recipe - will definitely be making again.

Fantastic, and I thought I didn't like couscous!

I didn't have Seasoned Rice Vinegar so I used Apple Cider Vinegar like another review mentioned.  Left everything else the same.  Turned out perfect, this one's a keeper!

Yum, yum, yum!  This was fantastic!  I used Israeli couscous, because I had it on hand.  I also used roasted red peppers because I didn't have fresh.  I loved the flavor of this and so did my almost 2 year old...he was eating it by the fistful (who needs a spoon!)  I know i will be making this again!

This recipe was great.  I did modify it quite a bit due to lack of some of the ingredients but it still turned out fantastic.  I substituted the vinegar with lemon juice and didn't have any bell peppers on hand so just added extra spinach and onions.  I also used whole wheat couscous to make it a little healthier.  Yum!

I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't change a thing except for using a yellow onion instead of a red onion. Flavors were mild. Nothing overpowering. All the ingredients meshed well and I used a whole wheat cous cous. I made 4 servings and it was A LOT. I definitely have leftovers. Everyone liked this dish. Happy. =)

This recipe makes more than enough for 4 people.  I used whole wheat couscous and no spinach because I didn't have any on hand.  I did everything else exactly as listed in the recipe and the dish came out good, but perhaps a little dry.  I might add more liquid with the whole wheat couscous and, if I make this again,  I'll definitely have spinach to pump it up a little.  I'd give this a 3.5 if I could, but I didn't like it as much as other recipes I've given 4's.

I used fresh herbs & raisins. Add 1/2 orange bell pepper. Whole wheat couscous with flax seed is available in the Hodgson Mill brand. Apple Cider Vinegar may be used in place of Seasoned Rice Vinegar. I favor coarse salt also known as kosher salt for a little twist of different flavor than table salt. Serve with orange roughy recipe of your choice.

I thought this was very good. I have made a few Couscous recipes and they have all turned out quite bland; but this was quite tasty! I followed it exactly; although I didn't have Seasoned Rice Vinegar - I used White Wine Vinegar in place of it. It tasted much better the following day! This is one I will make again! Thank you for the recipe!

This was a really tasty side dish to some grilled chicken skewers. For various reasons, made several adjustments, which are noted below. 

Instead of the vinegar, I used the zest and juice from one lemon, basically because I love the flavor of lemon oveer vinegar. I also used whole wheat couscous, because I had it on hand/it's healthier. 

Because I only had frozen spinach (equal to about one cup thawed) and also prefer a bit of crunch left to the bell pepper, I changed the cooking method slightly. I prepared the couscous in the broth separately, and added the lemon and herb mixture to this when fluffing with a fork. I cooked the onion/bell pepper mixture as directed, and threw in the spinach at the very end, just heating through (about 1 minute). Last, I mixed the grains with the veggies, and it turned out great!

I cut the recipe down to serve 2, and it could still feel an army.  I also did a little modification; I didnt have chicken or veggie broth, so I used water and added more salt to compensate. I left out the ground basil and added red pepper flakes to give it a bit of a bite. Overall this is pretty delicious!

V tasty.  I made it with the apple cider vinegar and also added mushrooms plus red and green peppers.    I was worried it might be a bit bland but it really is quite flavourful.

I scaled this recipe down to two servings and it fed my fiancé and myself and provided leftovers for my lunch the next day.  The colors in this dish were wonderful—very appealing to the eye and palate.  The only thing I changed was to substitute apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar since I didn’t have any.  I ended up using the optional raisins and they proved to be a welcome addition.  I also added some extra spinach at the end of cooking to give the dish that extra healthy taste.

This recipe was the first time I ever made couscous, and I'm glad I found such a great one to learn on. The couscous is light and satisfying, and really helps the fresh produce become outstanding. Not being a fan of onion I left it out and just added more diced pepper, and while I THOUGHT I had the rice vinegar I truly did not and thus subsituted red wine vinegar - not something I'll do again as the rice is much milder, but it still made a great dish. It comes together so quickly on the stovetop it's almost magic, and I love the wilted spinach - I plan to add a little more next time for our tastes. Maybe cheese when I'm feeling decadent, but truly this recipe doesn't need it (and I put cheese on EVERYTHING). It really impressed my boyfriend - thanks so much for submitting!

This was an ok side dish, but not amazing. I wished it has more of a savory flavor than it did. It looked more appealing than it actually tasted.

Fantastic!  I've made this several times now.  The rice wine vinegar really adds a lovely touch.  I sub israeli couscous and, accordingly, cook a bit longer.  I have also only served this cold.  I use golden raisins.  Also, the first time I made this I accidentally used twice the amount of spinach - a happy accident.  Now, I add part of the spinach during the cooking, and part right before I am going to serve for a wonderful, fresh touch.  Sooooo good.

I was in a hurry when I was making this, so I didn't take the time to chop up any onions, but it survived without it.  I did have some spinach that needed to be used, which I tore up and tossed in to wilt at the end of cooking, as well as some halved cherry tomatoes.  I didn't have currants or raisins, either, but I had Craisins and they were a light, fruity, pleasant addition!  Very unique (and delicious) flavor from this recipe!  I used whole wheat couscous and less oil than the recipe calls for.  Soooo good!

I prepared this dish using organic whole wheat couscous and 1.5 tsp of ready-minced garlic from a jar. I omitted the raisins, and I used 1 small yellow onion instead of 1/2 a large red onion. I also used a green bell pepper instead of red. Some reviewers had complained that this dish has a sour, vinegary taste, and to prevent that, I didn't use the full amount of rice vinegar that was called for. It still had a bit of a vinegary taste, but it's not overpowering. It actually smells more vinegary than it tastes; still, I'd have liked it to taste less like vinegar, but I'm not sure what I could use as a substitute for that ingredient. I served this dish with "Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs" from this site, and I didn't notice the vinegary flavor when the couscous was eaten with the chicken; it's only when you eat the couscous alone that you notice the vinegar. Overall I though the flavor and texture of this dish was pretty good, and I will most likely make it again, but I will probably just leave out the vinegar.

I made this for my weekly dinner group with my friends and it was a huge hit.  This was extremely flavorful and very colorful, which satisfied my need to have at least 3 colors at every meal.  I served it with grilled lamb skewers and everyone went back for seconds.  Some people even asked for it to bring home for lunch the next day.  The only change I made was using regular white wine vinegar, because that's all I had on hand.  This dish was wonderful hot, and is just as good cold as leftovers, I've been eating it with lunch for the rest of the week.  This will be added to my regular recipe rotation.  Thanks.

I thought this was ok.  I didn't think the vinegar made it sour, but sweet.  I think next time I would leave out the vinegar.  The spinach was a very nice addition.

This recipe was AWESOME.Everyone including a one and three year old all the way up to the adults LOVED it. The taste is melt in your mouth good. I used crystallized ginger(minced it in the food chopper) because that is all my supermarket had, it worked just fine. I cannot say enough good things about this recipe! Try it!

Was a little skeptical about the vinegar (and as one of the reviewers noted - it does end up with a sour undertone); but the overall result is pleasing both to the eye and the palette.
Thank you for a simple and delicious recipe.

We really enjoyed this with fresh water fish baked in foil (olive oil with herbs) with the juices added to the couscous. Also, I made a bed of greens instead of cooking the spinach in. I had to substitute red wine vinegar as had no rice vin in-house. I also had a little extra stock on hand and it needed it. We loved it!

This was actually pretty good, I was a little concerned about the vinegar because it smelled quite strong while I was cooking it, but it left a pretty mellow flavor. I did not have the raisins or spinach to put in this recipe but it worked and it tasted very light a subtley flavored. I will definitely makes this again.
