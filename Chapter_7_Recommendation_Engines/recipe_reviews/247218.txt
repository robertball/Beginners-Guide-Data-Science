Love this recipe! I used a sweeter red wine (Apothic Red) and didn't need to add sugar. Used frozen fruit. Everyone loved it!

Solid summer sangria. I cut out the pineapple and the apple, but otherwise followed the recipe as amended (that is, 1.5 l not 750 ml of vino) and used a cheap but decent cab (Frontera out of Argentina; 1.5 liter for under 10 bucks up here). Tends towards the strong side but gives a good buzz. Had it with a paella we made and some Tapas and all was well.

I thought this was too strong. So, next time I will use a sweeter red wine and reduce the brandy to half and add sparkling water or soda to it.

Wow!  So good.  Turned out even better than I imagined.  We used cherry liqueur instead of the brandy because we couldn't find it. Raspberries instead of sold out strawberries. Is delicious. Will make this again!!!!!

This was awesome. It turned out a little strong, so we watered it down some, but it was very tasty!

Made as directed using inexpensive merlot. Didn't need extra sugar. Added club soda just before serving for a little fizz and decorated with one whole blackberry. Will definitely make again.
