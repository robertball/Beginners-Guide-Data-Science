Delicious, however, I substituted hollindaise sauce for the cheese sauce.

This was wonderful. It was my first time for Veal. I did place it in the oven after I put it together for 8-10 min.

This was very good. I had never had veal like this before, but it was surprisingly easy to put together. There were a TON of dishes to clean up though, with separate pans for the cheese, veal, asparagus and (i had a side of rice). The cheese solidified, no matter what we did, but it was still good. Instead of a veal cutlet, i deboned a veal chop--which meant that the cooking time was more like 4 minutes per side.

THis was AWESOME! And very easy to make for beginners.  The only thing I did differently was used mexican cheeses bc I was out of cheddar and I added a teaspoon of horseradish to the sauce for a bit more taste.  It was fantastic!!  I ate it all and thats not very like me!

Very good special dinner for my husband and myself. I did substitute hollandaise and also used fresh lobster rather than crab. I live in New England, so lobster is affordable in the summertime.

Not too sure about this recipe, it can be pretty bland. I added red onions to the crabmeat.  I also suggest finding another topping for the whole thing, the "cheeze wiz" isn't cutting it.

Easy, though a bit expensive, tasty, and looks fabulous on the plate. Served it with fondant potatoes from this site, the rest of the asparagus, and a good but inexpensive Viognier.  Yumm!

The meal itself was excellent but the directions for the cheese sauce left a lot to be desired. All I was getting was a lumpy mess which would separate into a semi solid mass surrounded by liquid when it cooled.  Lucky for me my sister asked what about flour and did I make roux before the milk step. When she added milk mixed with flour ( to late for a roux) it  finally turned into a smooth sauce with the ingredients not separating when cooling..

We loved it but it is a bit bland so I added garlic powder, basil and oregano to the flour mixture and the sauce. I didn't have cheddar so I used havarti and parmigiana cheese. Delicious!

My husband enjoyed this very much.  Told me I could make it again.  I used chicken breast instead of veal.
