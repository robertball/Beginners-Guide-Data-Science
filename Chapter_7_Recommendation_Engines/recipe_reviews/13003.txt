This was very good. I would definitely cut back on the ketchup in the future as it was a little too "sweet" tasting for me. Oh and I will add more liquid as the pasta absorbed a lot. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was the first and by far the finest recipe I have made off of this site.  Whenever I've served it to my family or dinner guests it is always extremely well received.  In fact, my Grandfather literally cries if he finds out I made it and didn't invite him over.  The base is so good and versatile, I've tried it with all kinds of different vegetables, stuff I had leftover in the fridge, etc... and it's still marvelous.  The only changes I make consistently now - I like the sweet Italian turkey sausage in it, it's not so greasy, I usually do a mix of half beef broth and half vegetable broth and I always cook my tortellini before adding it at the end.  And, for the people who can't seem to add the ketchup- try really hard to overcome your fear, you're missing out on one of the keys that adds a certain "richness" to this recipe and (in my opinion) makes it so exceptional.  Thank you Charlotte!!!

Great recipe, great soup.  Hubs and I both loved it.  Super simple to make with most ingredients right at hand.  I didn't measure precisely, just kind of threw everything together, but I did use more garlic and less ketchup. I used dried spinach tortellini, cooking it separately and adding it at the last. I wasn't sure I would like the red pepper, something I'm not familiar with in soup, but I did find it a different taste twist I really enjoyed. As for hubs, he enjoyed this soup so much he asked me to send him to work with it for his lunch--for the next two days!

This is one of our favourites. I did change a couple of things. I cook whole Italian sausages in the microwave; then slice them and brown them in a pan a bit. I do not add the zuchinni either. I also never add the pasta to the soup pot; it just absorbs all the broth. I add to the individual soup bowls. FRESHLY grated parmesan is amust. Thanks for a great meal.

I'm a beginner cook. The times I do cook, I have to have a recipe, and I normally follow it exactly.   Edits: 1 lb sweet and spicy italian sausage (there was no fat to spoon off) Spinach and cheese tortellini 3 cups beef broth 3 cups vegetable broth Cabernet sauvignon red wine  my boyfriend who is a food critic said that the sweet and spicy overpowered the soup. Sweet Italian sausage would have been much better (could not find at store). Make sure the vegetables get well cooked. Apparently mine did not cook long enough!

This soup is a winner.  I made it for a church Soup Supper and everyone raved about it.  The ketchup is the "secret ingredient" that gives it some real punch and flavor.  Rich and delicious, with lots of fresh veggies.  My husband, the soup conniseur, loves it!

This soup turned out amazing!  I used mild Italian sausage with casings removed.  Based on some other comments I modified slightly.  I used 8 cups of beef broth and only 1/2 cup of ketchup.  I also used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes.  I did not add the wine.  I cooked my tortellini separately and added some to each bowl before serving.   Definitely will be making again.  My family enjoyed it very much.

Made it just like the recipe says...guess I'm really not a fan of ketchup-based soup; too sweet & not a lot of depth of flavor. The totellini and cheese on top were the best parts.

This recipe was SO delicious!  I actually made it with chicken instead of sausage because that's what I had, and plus it's a little healthier. I wasn't in a time crunch this time, but if I am when I make this again (because I WILL be making this again and again)I might just buy a bag of frozen carrots/celery/onion.

I make this soup often.  I use the Maple Leaf chub pork sausage. (It is a seasoned pork sausage)  I leave out the zucchini just because of personal preference.  I cook the tortellini in a pot on the side then add once it is ready to be served.  The pasta does absorb the liquid by the next day however just add more beef broth or water to the pot.  Also make sure you buy a good quality Italian seasoning, it will make a difference.  This is by far the best soup recipe I have come across.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I have been making this soup for years!! I cook Italian sausages seperately;slice them and add them to the soup.I also NEVER cook pasta in a soup; it absorbs too much broth. And you MUST add the ketchup. Anyone who has been disappointed with this recipe hasn't added the ketchup.
This is always a winner in my kichen!!
Thanks Charlotte

This soup was outstanding.  I made it for the first time for a large group at church, and everyone LOVED it, even the kids!  I had everyone coming up to me and asking for the recipe.  I have never heard so many compliments on a recipe before.  Definitely a winner!!  The only alteration I did was add beef and onion dry soup mix to the broth to give it a heartier flavor.

This is the first recipe I've reviewed and I've been using this site for 2 years.  This soup is absolutely WONDERFUL!!!  We make it at least twice a month and usually serve with warm garlic bread.  The only thing that I did different was that I use sweet Italian turkey sausage and chicken broth instead of beef. Our whole neighborhood loves it!!! Thanks for the great recipe.

Charlotte - I don't hand out 5 stars very easily here.... but this is 5 stars plus. I am making this again right now... I've been making it for years and it's a favorite in my family and my friends love it, too. I can't believe I haven't rated it yet and that there is no pic submitted of it. I will take one tonight. For you doubters - ADD THE KETCHUP!! You wont regret it and it really is key to this recipe along with the wine. This is a perfect soup and soups are my favorite thing to cook. Thank you so much for this recipe... I love it! Everyone loves it! OM NOM NOM!

My family's favorite soup!  I make it for company and often serve it with a panini sandwich (chicken, roasted red bell pepper, pesto, and provolone is our favorite), and it's always a huge hit.

Very tasty, but next time I will cook my tortellini seperately and add it to individual bowls because they soaked up all my soup liquid. When I went back to reheat a bowl the next day, I had to add more liquids.  It was just a hassle I wasn't prepared for.  I'll remember it for next time!

Was pretty good, though I'd do a few things differently next time.  I'd use a spicier sausage and maybe not as much pasta.  I thought it overwhelmed the soup and soaked up most of the broth, which made it seem more like a casserole rather than a soup.  I also used a small can of tomato sauce rather than the ketchup.

This is a great recipe! I have made it many times over the past year or so, following the recipe exactly, and my husband and I LOVE it! I often make the whole recipe and, after we have eaten the leftovers for a couple of days, I freeze the rest for another meal. The tortellini get a bit mushy in the freezer. You can also just freeze the soup and add fresh tortellini when you reheat it.

This is a good, hearty soup.  I add the tortellini about 8 minutes before I am about to serve in order to prevent the pasta from becoming soggy.

Yummy soup Charlotte.  My hubby's not a fan of zucchini but enjoyed the soup nonetheless.  I put the tortellini in about the last 10 minutes and I didn't have any problems with it absorbing too much liquid.  Mine was a little on the hot side but that could be easily controlled depending on the type of sausage.  This was good as leftovers too!  Thanks for sharing.

EXCELLENT soup! I followed the recipe to the letter and turned out great for us! Nice & thick but jam packed with flavor! Served with toasted french bread and a dinner salad and this is a huge hit! Will make this many times this winter!

This was a very good recipe.I found that the wine was a little to much.I will make it again but use much less wine.

Our whole family loves this recipe.  It takes a little more time to prepare things, but is WELL worth it.  The flavor is mildly spicy and zesty.  All of our children (and we have 7) LOVED it.  They told me, "Mom, this is a "Do over", which means MAKE IT AGAIN!  The recipe doubles and triples nicely.

Wonderful! I used turkey Italian sausage so I added more seasonings (fennel seed, red pepper flake, garlic powder, basil)  Used a couple of cups of leftover marinara sauce in place of ketchup.  Makes a huge pot! I think I'll add spinach at the end next time too-trying to get more greens into our diet. This is going into my soup keeper file!

Everyone I served this to told me it was "gourmet"!!  I followed recipe ingredients exactly but  just added more zucchini, more onion.  I was not sure what type of sausage to buy, so I just got  ground sausage in a tube.  It worked great.  This is a fabulous soup!!

I, too, have been making this recipe for years and always get rave reviews. It makes a lot, so if you think you'll have left overs, take out what you think you'll need for the meal, then add the tortellini. Add tortellini to the rest before you serve it the next time.This avoids "mushy" tortellini leftovers:)

This is a delicious soup! I added a can of vegetable stock to avoid a shortage of broth. I used chorizo instead of italian sausage and added a box of frozen, chopped spinach. Other than that, I prepared the recipe as stated (including ketchup!) and it was so flavorful! I'll definitely make it again!

I've been making this recipe for so long and I love it.  My only complaint is that the tortellini do absorb too much of the broth.  It never occured to me to cook them separately and add them to the bowls.  Great tip!

I have been making this recipe since 2000. It is the first one in my recipe box. I do cook the tortellini seperately and add them to each bowl. I also add one more can of beef broth. I have made this recipe over and over  again and it is always a hit!

What a meal! Total comfort food.  Went lovely with a salad and crusty French bread. Left out the ketchup and used tomato sauce instead. Also didn't have any zucchini or celery so I used celery seed instead. Used frozen instead of fresh cheese tortellini.

This recipe is so tasty -- great choice for a cool, Fall, football Sunday.  I made it with chicken sausage.  Next time I'll make it with half of the beef broth 'no sodium'.

Very good, would definitely make again.  I did saute the red peppers with the onions so my children would be less likely to complain about them and they loved it.  Made it for a serving of 12 and had it for two days (no complaints).  Could have used a bit more broth - did add it the second day and it was still great.

I made this last night for dinner and my husband loved it. It has plenty of fresh veggies which makes it absolutely wonderful. My only problem is the ketchup. It makes the dish too tangy. I would like to substitute with tomato sauce or juice next time. For future cooks, I would not use ketchup. Otherwise, great recipe and I will make again.

Tasty dinner soup that was devoured by everyone!  I cut the recipe in half for four of us and that was just the right amount.  I didn't have whole or even stewed tomatoes so I added a half can of italian seasoned diced tomatoes.  Served with Savory Biscuits for dipping.

This soup is fabulous! I have tried using different kinds of tortellini and ravioli and they all taste great.  I buy refrigerated tortellini when it is on sale and then freeze. When I am ready to make this soup I just dump in the frozen tortellini at the end of the recipe and boil for 10-12 minutes.  Finshed! 

On another instance I ran out of ketchup and only used 1/2 cup- still tasted great.  I also use peeled baby carrots chopped in half length wise to make an easy prep.

This was a good soup, loaded with veggies and a good broth thanks to the wine. My only complaint is that the ketchup does overpower the soup in my opinion. I think I will try it next time with a little tomato paste and a large can of tomatoes.

I do not normally leave reviews on recipes that I make, but this one is 100% worth it! Great easy recipe that can be altered, and tastes delicious. I encourage others to try this healthy yummy soup!

We really enjoyed this soup even though I made it vegetarian.  The broth was great and couldn't tell there was ketchup (maybe bkz of wine?).  Added black beans to keep it hearty.

I loved this recipe! I used a mild sausage because my family doesn't like a lot of spice, but I would much prefer it with a spicier sausage I think. Might try green peppers next time too, the red were good, but a little sweet.

we love this soup and make it all winter long.  I do cut back the ketchup to 1/4 or 1/2 cup, as I don't like too strong of a ketchup taste.  You'll love it!
