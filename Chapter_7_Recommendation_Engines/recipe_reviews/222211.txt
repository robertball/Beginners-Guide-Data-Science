Just when my family thought that refried beans couldn't get any better........someone adds cream cheese. I only made one change and that was using pepper-jack instead of cheddar. We fought over these. No, really. My family said they want these beans again........tomorrow.

This is a delicious refried bean recipe! Adding the cream cheese... what a great idea! This side dish will give your main dish some hefty competition for center stage. I also didn't have spicy refried beans so I added 1/8 tsp Cayenne, and I think next time I'll add even more. I also used a mixture of pepper-jack and cheddar cheese. The only thing I'd caution about the recipe is the serving sizes: the recipe says it makes 6 servings, but those would be 6 measly little servings that would only leave you sad and wanting more (each serving would be about 1/3 of a cup, which might be a true "serving," but most people tend to eat more than that for beans). I made the recipe for a dinner with 6 people, and after making one batch, decided I needed to double the recipe. I'm glad I did because at the end of the night there was only a spoonful left, and everyone commented on how yummy they were and kept going back for 2nds, 3rds, and 4ths!

Well, this was not the prettiest thing, but boy was it yummy! I only had regular refreid beans, so I used those and added a bit of cayenne in with the mix. My cream cheese was right out of the fridge, so I just put the flame to low and added it in, so that it would melt and combine easier. We really enjoyed these, and I will def be making them again...great way to do something different w/ refried beans! Thanks for sharing. :)

I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I made it as written (ok, I doubled it because I had an 8 ounce block of cream cheese to use up) and it was ok. The second time I chopped up 4 jalepenos, seeds and all, and tossed them in with the onions and garlic. FANTASTIC! My family won't stop eating my double batch.

This is absolutely AMAZING! Tried this out for our new neighbors and the dish was a masterpiece hit. Everyone kept going back for seconds, thirds, and fourths... the kids loved it as well.
I did not have spicy refried beans, so I substituted 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. 

TIP: Do Not just make one recipe. DOUBLE IT! You will regret not having enough.

The only thing I do different is use 1T bacon grease instead of butter, and 3 cans of beans is the right proportion to the remaining ingredients. Otherwise, it is too strong.The Cream Cheese is the key, but too much of a good thing is a bad thing, same with onion and garlic. Either add 2 more cans of beans, or reduce the other ingredients by 1/3.Plain beans are fine too.

Fantastic refried beans! I loved them leftover too. Will make again and add some green onion and sour cream as a garnish.  Thanks to Lindsay on the Buzz for recommending this dish.

Delicious! I wanted to eat the whole dish. My kids usually dont like refried beans as a side, but they actually ate it all. No leftovers for me! I guess I will have to make it again.

I made this, but without the cream cheese.  Not terrible.  Cream cheese is disgusting enough on it's own and I can't imagine adding it to BEANS... YUK

I used regular refried beans (not spicy) and have made this recipe dozens of times with spectacular results. Sometimes I add some frozen corn or use a "Four Cheese Mexican" mix instead of regular cheddar. I've had nothing but rave reviews.

I was looking for a easy but tasty recipe for refried beans for when I'm in a hurry, and this is definitely it! We've made it with spicy and regular beans, and it's good both ways. I like the recipe just the way it is, but I have to admit that my husband is right, it does taste very much like cream cheese that way, and he didn't care for that as much. So, we only put half the cream cheese when we make it and everyone is happy with that.

Very good, despite the fact that I did not use spicy refried beans, as I wanted to use what I had on hand.  A definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, yankeesfan!

I added cumin, cayenne and jalapeno.  I did not have the spicy beans, just regular.  Very good but almost more of a dip than a side dish.  We served it with chips.  Would be great for breakfast with an egg served on top.

Wow this recipe is so good!  I doubled the recipe for a potluck, but only used 3/4 of the 8 oz cream cheese.  I didn't have spicy refried beans on hand, so added a generous pinch of cayenne, and sautéed my onions/garlic in some rendered bacon fat.  Was amazing, my teenage daughter agreed.

We had a dinner party this weekend, and it was a hit! Super easy recipe.  After it was done, I put it in my crockpot.  I substituted the cheddar cheese for a Mexican cheese mix and added it to the crockpot approximately 1 hour before serving.  I thought straight cheddar cheese might have made it greasy. Anyway, it turned out great, and I would cook it again.

This is a delicious way to dress up refried beans. Sometimes canned refried beans are a bit looser than I would like; when I get a can like that I reduce the cream cheese to 2 ounces. Other than that, this recipe is great as is and I plan on making it often as an accompaniment to tacos.

Love this recipe as a side dish or as a dip with tortilla chips. We spiced it up a little by stirring in some hot sauce before baking. Took it to a family gathering and everyone loved it!

I made this & it's so good! I did use 8 oz of cream cheese instead of 4. I also added some diced black olives, TACO seasoning & a can of fire roasted salsa style tomatoes. Dynamite!!! Thank you! :)

I added a seeded and minced jalepeno pepper to the bean mixture before putting in the oven. Despite reviews praising the cream cheese, it did not appeal to me at all so I didn't use it. The beans came out great! Nice and spicy, soft and loose - seems like they would've been too runny with the cream cheese. I'll make again exactly the same.

I made it out of leftover pot of pinto beans I'd cooked a few days earlier. Mashed them up and I added cayenne, black pepper, and more butter (another tbsp). It's good. Cream cheese adds creamy note. Good on tortillas.

This is a favorite of ours! I have never baked it. Once I add in the refried beans and they are heated through, then I stir in the cream cheese along with the shredded cheese until melted and remove from heat. It gives it a pretty color and is very smooth. I have tried it with different kinds of cheese and it's always delicious! I now use it for my Double Tacos recipe here on the site - http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/220773/double-tacos/  Thank you so much for sharing this! ?

Yum.  This has become our go to side whenever we are having Mexican food. Easy, too.

I had high hopes for this because i love cream cheese but the flavor didn't pair well with the refried beans for me. next time i will just add a layer of cheese in the middle of my beans and bake like usual

This was really good.  A bit too much garlic for me, but everyone loved it.

I agree with another reviewer, it wasn't pretty looking but tasted pretty good.  Did not go spicy given my attendee list.  Not sure I'd make again.
