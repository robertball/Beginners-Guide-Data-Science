I love the idea of this jam, but could not make it by following this recipe. There is no indication what kind of pectin to use. 

BALL pectin will not work with these instructions. I tried it.  

Different brands of pectin CANNOT be substituted for each other. Pectins from different companies act very differently.

I've been using this recipe now for 3 or 4 years.  My wife is half Polish so we wanted something to celebrate that and teach our son.  Oddly we became aware of this jam through the TV show The Blacklist, where it was featured in an episode in the 2nd season, and we just happened to have roses in bloom at that very moment. I made a batch, it turned out delicious and unique, so it has become added to our family culture. To me it tastes like a blend of cherry and strawberry, which suits it well to its traditional role as a filling for paczki and other pastries. The one tip I actually picked up from The Blacklist, which this recipe leaves out, is to add some rum to the lemon juice for marinating the petals, about 1.5 to 2 oz.  With that added, this is simply a delightful recipe which I think everyone who owns or has access to roses should do at least occasionally, making something wonderful out of that which otherwise goes to waste.  The aroma is delicate and the ruby red is entrancing.

I believe this needs more sugar to properly set it.  Otherwise, it's too runny.

Delicious. I made half quantity with very fragrant pale pink 'Children's Rose' petals from my garden. I used half a sachet (25g) of Fowlers jam setta. The taste is tangy and a little bitter when you bite into one of the petals, which I quite like as it balances the sweetness, like pink grapefruit. The colour is a warm rose-brown.  Would love to make it with a fragrant dark pink or red petal!

This turned out exactly as I expected it would, the smell is sweet and floral just as expected. I look forward to trying it in some baking recipes.

This was really tasty. Although I love sweets, this was almost too sweet.

Just whipped up a batch to give to my mom, Grandma and godmother for mother's day. There was some left over after the jars were filled so I let it set and tried it to see how it turned out and I have got to say this recipe is genius... I hope the recipients like it.
