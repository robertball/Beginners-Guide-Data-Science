This was a tasty recipe--but I'll warn you right now, I revised it for a slow cooker only because I don't do ovens when the temps are still in the triple digits (like they are in Phoenix right now).
I made 1/2 the batch. I washed the whole acorn squash then set it in a 5 qt. slow cooker and turned to low for 8 hours. I let the squash cool to handle then peeled and seeded it. I followed the rest of the recipe except I used 1 cup of 2% milk instead of half'n'half and pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon/nutmeg mixture.

11/30/2012: I made this for 17 people on Thanksgiving, and it was a hit!  I used 2 acorn squash and 2 butternut squash and increased the other ingredients accordingly.  The only change I made was 2% milk instead of half'n'half.  Delicious!  The leftovers were a popular choice for lunch and dinner the next day.  It was just as good left-over as it was fresh, and it was good served cold as well as hot.  10/17/2016 update:  I've made this more times than I can count now, but tonight, for the first time, I substituted buttercup squash for the acorn squash, and the soup was incredible!  You can't seem to make a bad soup with this recipe using any kind of winter squash, but my new favorite is buttercup. So sweet and delicious.  I always sub 2% milk for the half 'n' half and tonight also substituted coconut oil for the butter and that worked fine too.  Thanks FutureChefShay for this wonderful recipe!  09/23/18 update: I forgot to mention that Andouille sausage makes a great addition to this soup. I cut a 13 oz Smithfield fully cooked one into bite sized chunks and stir it in after I purée the soup, then let it sit 5 minutes to heat up the sausage before serving.

Roasted the onion, carrots and garlic along with the squash.  Combined all in a pan with the rest of ingredients and used my immersion blender from other reviews.  Only roast garlic for about half an hour, then take out of oven and set aside til ready to use.

I thought this was great! I used almond milk instead of half & half and vegetable broth instead of chicken to make it vegan.

added a little cream cheese and little hot pepper like we do with our butternut squash soup.  Very good with club crackers.

This is so yummy and so good for you, too!  I added 1 large, chopped Granny Smith apple to the veggies I sautéed and because I am allergic to milk, I substituted coconut milk for the half and half.  It was amazing and is the perfect fall soup!  Great after visiting the pumpkin farm and corn maze on a chilly October afternoon.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made it as described, except I used my own veg stock instead of chicken and I used an immersion blender in the pot. I was expecting to spike my own bowl with sriracha, because I like some heat (but my toddler doesn't) & a couple of other reviewers said it was bland, but I didn't end up using the hot sauce at all - it was delicious as it was!

I had bought 1 Acorn Squash at the grocery on an impulse, even though I had no idea how to cook it or what it would taste like.  I decided on this Recipe since there are 3 of us in the household and it wouldn't be the only dish on the table for dinner in case we didn't like it.  I loved it!  I made it exactly as written, except I only used 1 squash and I cooked/steamed it in the microwave (cut sides down in a glass dish with about 1/4" of water, covered with plastic wrap for 10 minutes).  This saved a good 35 minutes of oven time.  Of course I halved the ingredients, and I used 1% Lactaid Milk which worked out fine.  This made a full pot of creamy soup, plenty for the 3 of us plus some leftover.  I served mine with a dallop of sour cream in the middle.  The taste is very interesting; Sweet but Savory.  See my pics!

Delicious as written!  I make this one a lot (though I'll confess I add salt).  It's the perfect combination of sweet and savory flavor.    I've also made it veganized (veggie broth for the chicken broth, canned coconut milk for the half&half, olive oil for the butter) and it turns out great.  Sometimes I sub the carrot for a small baked yam (added with the squash, not the onion) and omit the garlic, which is also good.

Really tasty soup. I got a load of acorn squash in my CSA storage share and was looking to do something different than the typical sweet side dish preparation of it. I love that this recipe uses half and half instead of heavy cream. With a side of hearty, crusty sourdough bread, this soup is a keeper.

This was a very tasty Recipe, but I altered it to be more chunky (since we like our Soups to be of more substance).  I used Shallots instead of Onions.  I added Roasted Red Potatoes and Brussel Sprouts, from the night before's leftovers.  I used my Immersion Blender and just pureed the Acorn Squash a little bit.  I also used Light Cream instead of the Half and Half. I also added Pancetta, too.  Delicious and my Husband asked or seconds.  This from a Man that doesn't like Acorn Squash nor Brussel Sprouts.  Mmh, the wonders of an Immersion Blender.

this was the easiest, fastest and very delicious soup I have made in a long time from a recipe! I inherited two acorn squash from a Halloween party and didn't want to see them go to waste so I came home and made it! It was just right! Did not have to alter in any way! Excellent!

Nice and silky and easy to make but it's a SWEET soup.  I used my immersion blender which made blending the soup in the pot super easy.

Very much enjoyed this soup recipe.  I made has written, only didn't puree the veggies all the way down.  I used my blender stick so that I could leave some of the veggies in small pieces. I like the texture the vegetables add to the soup.  I did freeze some of this and it reheated very well.  Always a plus in my book.  I served this with 'French Baguettes' from AR. The next time I make this I'm going to add some cayenne pepper or Cajun season to give it a little zip.

I liked it. I didn't have half-n-half, so I used plain non-fat Greek yogurt instead, and then added 1 Tbs of brown sugar to counter the plain yogurt. It was wonderful. I made enough for 8 additional servings that I put in the freezer for those crazy soccer practice nights to pair with a grilled ham and cheese sandwich.

What I really liked is that I was able to get to a nice creamy consistency. I also didn't have too much just enough. I ate for breakfast. I used heavy cream instead of half and half because that's what I had. I think I didn't rate it a five because the flavors were strong enough. I think you need to get a ripe acorn squash. I roasted my squash in a water bath and likely put too much water in the backing dish which made it a bit more watery.

I love vegetables & since I had to purée this I figured the kids would never know we added extra & more. I used 3 carrots, 3 celery stalks & about a full cup almost 2 c of cauliflower. It was delicious. We ate it without the  cream/ milk. A dollop of sour cream was the perfect garnish.

Yes, I had to make a change. I did not have any half and half, but I did have some whole milk sour cream. I added a half cup of sour cream into which I had stirred the 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg and the 1/2 ts. ground cinnamon.  The soup, after blending it was so smooth, and the spicy sour cream really enriched the flavor.  I felt like I was drinking yummy vitamins as I drank the think orange broth! So flavorful !

The only thing I changed was the broth to vegetable since it was made for a Meatless Monday - I made it as is and I loved this soup! I used an extra can of broth (or you can use water as it stated) and added it slowly to preferred consistency because it can be slightly too thick. I will be making this again for sure. Thank you so much for sharing!

I was scared because I am not a good cook and this looked complicated, but it worked out very nicely!  I did less nutmeg and cin, added a dash of cayenne and paprika.  We topped it with avocado which was a nice addition.  Will definitely make again, no question.

This was quite flavorful on a chilly day. Because I was making this for a friend that doesn't eat dairy,  I substituted olive oil for the butter and a can of coconut milk for the milk. I needed the entire can because the soup was on the thick side.. I also added a couple of apples because it was apple season and I had a surplus of them.  I added extra spices because we like  things spicy. It was so smooth and yummy. This recipe adapts well to dietary needs and available ingredients.

Just made this soup and thought it was great.....took advise from one review and roasted squash, carrots and garlic..I am very big on soups and to be honest when a recipe calls for any heavy cream or milk I never add it and I love my cream soups .  I find if you put less liquid than the recipe calls for and blend your soups in a blender I find no need for the extra calories of the cream...will ake again

I made this soup over the weekend, I actually left out the half & half because the soup tasted delicious even without it (less calories that way too). I would definitely make this soup again with out the cream because after it's blended it really doesn't need it but I do see how it could make it creamier. It made my home smell wonderful on a cool fall day too!

I followed the recipe pretty much to a T until the end, when I thought it was a little bland and I started being a lot more liberal with the spices. I added some paprika and a tiny amount of cayenne to bring out the cinnamon.

my first bite of this was disappointed...i wanted it to be butternut. but the more bites the happier i am!
i doubled the squash and the cinnamon and nutmeg, left the rest the same.  added a dash of chili-garlic sauce to my bowl at the end and served with a dollop of sour cream (the key to soup!)  love it, will find again when i get another overrun of these squashes.
my 2 and 3 year old also like it (non spicy version).

I thought this soup was wonderful.  Here in Southern Indiana where I live acorn squash are plentiful so I have been baking them for weeks.  I altered the recipe a bit when I made it.  Instead of chicken stock I used one can of chicken broth and one can of beef broth.  I also sauteed the carrots, onions and garlic for a lot longer than 7 minutes to give the broth a nice caramelized accent.  I also omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg and added some red pepper flakes for a bit of spice.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Delicious.....As another reviewer stated, I too used 1 Apple.  I did not have a Granny Smith so used a Gala Apple peeled and chopped, Cooked it with the onion, garlic and carrot.  Did not have half and half used 1% milk.  Very delicious.

Great recipe! Just a few minor tweaks like purple onion instead of sweet; also added some cayenne pepper to give it a little kick. Hubby loved it so I'll be adding to the rotation!

This is SO GOOD!!! Subbed the cream for almond milk, butter for coconut oil, and chicken stock for veggie stock. It tastes just as amazing with the alternations and the cinnamon and nutmeg are the perfect finishing touch. Cannot express enough how perfect this recipe is!

I've made this soup several times and I love it.  This time, however, it seemed a bit bland to me.  I perked it up with a 1/4 teaspoon of salt and white pepper and 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of brandy.  That added a bit more depth of flavor.

Tasting it before adding the nutmeg and cinnamon it was already delicious, but after adding suggested amounts from recipe we found them to be a bit overpowering. Will make again, but will try cutting the nutmeg and cinnamon in half (at least).

Very tasty!  Don't try and be lazy like me though to reduce the number of dishes to wash afterwards.  I thought just using a hand masher would be ok instead of dirtying the entire blender, but no, a smooth, creamy texture really makes this soup.  It tasted way better that way than chunky did.  I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of just nutmeg and cinnamon.

Following the recipe, this ended up being a little bland. It couldn't quite make up its mind if it was going to be sweet or savory. I decided to go with sweet. I added about a cup of applesauce first, which helped a lot, but not quite enough. Next I added about half a cup of brown sugar. Bingo! That brought all the flavors together. A little salt on top gave it a little sparkle, too.

This was a great base for you to really make it to your own liking.  When I made It I had to add 2 scoops of creamy peanut butter and a little chili powder. It just felt like It was missing something.  I also suggest letting it sit for about 15 min after seasoning to let everything mingle.

I’ve made this soup twice now and loved it.  I did substitute pumpkin pie creamer for the half and half because that’s what I had on hand but it added a nice flavor.

I’ve made this soup many times because we all love it. I add grated ginger and a red chilli pepper to give it zing and omit the cream as we prefer less creamy soups.  I also add any extra root vegetable I may have like sweet potato. This is our favourite winter soup.photo is soup before blending.

Oh my goodness this was so good. I did however make a few changes. I left out the cinnamon only because I have an allergy to it. I then added an apple more because of the cinnamon and added a sage and 3 teaspoons of sugar. Will so make it again. Thank you!

Very good, I did add salt, pepper and chili powder. I also roasted the squash with just a little maple syrup and did it cut side up.  I put the carrots and onion in to roast as well.  I'll make it again.

Very much enjoyed this recipe. I probably added a little extra cream and water to get it to the consistency I liked. Otherwise, the base of this recipe is great and you could tweak it to suit your own individual likes.

Good, but I needed to use a dairy alternative due to lactose intolerance. I used a almond/coconut cream (meant to be like half and half). I enjoyed it but I don’t think I’ll make again. A little too light for my taste.

I will definitely make this again, fantastic!
Very high prep time and  I might try microwaving the squash when I make it again.
I left out the onions but pretty much followed the recipe.
I used fresh grated nutmeg and garnished with fresh Basil.
This soup is the BOMB!
 Just beware, a large bowl is a meal in itself so try small servings at first.

Great recipe but I wanted it a little sweeter so I added an apple and it turned out great. I used my immersion blender and it was easy peasy and fast.  I’m using this recipe for all my squash this fall.

Delicious!!! A friend gave me a couple of acorn squash and I found this recipe.  I used up leftover beef broth and Gouda cheese sauce I had in the freezer to replace some of the chicken broth. It came out Fantastic!!   I can't wait to see how it is the second day.

Added more garlic, salt, pepper, a dollop of sour cream. And  sprinkled Parmesan on it. This made it only OK. Not going to make it again. We like a different kind of soup.

Great tastes? I used 2 acorn squash that grew from seed from my cousin’s composer. They were the perfect size and delicious. I used 1/2 cup of 5% light cream and my hand blender. Simmered the broth and garlic carrot and onion while the acorn squash was roasting.

delicious! I omitted the cream - hubby is lactose intolerant. Still very yummy.  I will make this in a vegetarian version for veg & vegan friends. 
As other suggested, I roasted onions, carrots & garlic in oven with squash (and i added 1 stalk celery). Used immersion blender to keep it simple.

I didn't exactly follow the recipe..i only had 1 acorn squash, so i roasted the squash & 1/2 way through added in the garlic (and then some), carrots, and onion.  instead of 1/2 & 1/2 i used organic created coconut, & some fresh sage...blended it all up in my Vitamix & it was pretty darn good.  I didn't add any broth to keep the sodium down..for liquid i just used what was in the roasting pan w/the carrots, etc.

I used 2% instead of 1/2 & 1/2
I used 10 tiny carrots & 1 acorn squash
It still tastes fantastic.

This soup was amazing! The cinnamon and nutmeg added a tremendous amount of flavour and it didn't take much. The soup was perfect by itself but I added some shredded chicken to make it a full meal. That was also fabulous! I will definitely make this again.

This was absolutely yummy.  I only had one squash so I halved the recipe.  But made as directed,  I used my Vitamix and the result was a velvety smooth, rich tasting soup.

Added half a honey crisp apple and omitted nutmeg. I used heavy cream instead of half and half since that's what I had. Briefly sautéed vegetables and then boiled them in the broth while the squash baked.

One of favorite seasonal soups! I add a little zing with a table spoon of fresh ground ginger, and garnish with raisins and pecans.  My family loves it.

This is a wonderful soup! Although, I put some pumpkin spice in it, and some brown sugar on the acorn squash in the oven with some butter.  It gave it a sweeter taste but yet so goood!! :)

This recipe turned out fairly good and it was souper easy! I ended up omitting the cream. I just felt like it didn't need it. I think next time I would reduce the cinnamon and nutmeg. I've got a stuffy nose and I feel like the cinnamon and nutmeg is overpowering.

Decent recipe, but the result was rather intense! This spices in this soup were very overwhelming so we couldn't eat very much of it. This was definitely a fun experiment, but I wouldn't cook it again.

I modified it to my tastes. I doubled the amount of stock and half and half and kept everything else the same. I used pumpkin pie spice and it was fine! We are not that fond of spice so I did not double that. YUMMY!

This was good.  Very mild taste but that might have been the squash and not the recipe.  Might add a sweet potato if I make it again.

Great Autumn soup really shows the flavors of the season. I made twice the amount and added in a few green apples and cloves. Served with club crackers to complete it.

Tried this soup for the first time and overall it was good.  I did, however, HAVE to adjust it slightly because it was rather bland.  I made one-half of the recipe which served 4 people adequately.  I cooked the squash in the microwave rather than the oven - perhaps that made a difference(?) and although I adjusted the other ingredients since I only used 1 squash, I found it very bland.  As someone else suggested, I added red pepper flakes thinking that would help - it didn't.  So, although I was trying to avoid using brown sugar, I made small additions until the flavor improved.  This soup does have a nice consistency and I will make it again - with my additions.

Good flavor but will need to modify to improve texture to be more soup-like.  I think this might be a great sauce to use with a pork roast and I'm going to try that next time I use this recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  I admit I was skeptical at first of adding the nutmeg and cinnamon, but I tried it and hubby and I LOVED it!  Mostly stuck to the recipe; however, I did soften my squash whole in the microwave rather than the oven to save time.  I also added just a couple ounces cream cheese per another reviewer's recommendation, which made it even richer.  Although, it would definitely be yummy without it, too.  Highly recommend this soup for a cold fall or winter day and will without a doubt be making it many more times to come!  Can't wait to have it left over for lunch tomorrow! YUM!!! ;)

I made this from leftover baked acorn squash. It had the brown sugar and butter from baking. I sauted the onion, carrot, then added the garlic.  I add my ajusted amount of chicken broth.  Then I added the squash.  I let it simmer until all of the ingredients were nice and warm. I used my immersion blender to blend it all in the pot.  Then I added a replacement for 1/2 & 1/2.  I used 1/8 c heavy cream and 1/8 c 2% milk.  I used pumkin spices and tabasco sauce.  Salt and pepper to taste.
