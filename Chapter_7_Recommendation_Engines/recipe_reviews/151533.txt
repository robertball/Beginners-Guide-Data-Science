This is a delicious dish. Not exactly the recipe I use, but close enough! Fresh ground peanut butter is even better.

We love peanut butter, but we were disappointed. I made it exactly as written but did not sprinkle with peanuts because I was out of them. I would have liked more complex flavor but it tasted pretty bland. I think it needs some spices to make it more interesting.

I was first introduced to Peanut Soup at the George Washington Club in Old Towne Alexandria, VA.   I was skeptical, but it was a fixed menu so I got it - it was surprisingly good.   The Club closed down closed down due to lack of local Gov't funding (a shame!), so I was not able to get their recipe.   I'm glad to find this one.

I'm giving this a 3 because my boyfriend said it "wasn't bad" (granted, he eats just about anything I put in front of him, including things I accidentally burn and basically destroy). I was able to choke down half a cup full, but didn't like it.  It had a funny burnt taste to it - and no, I didn't use an off brand peanut butter. I think it was slightly better as it cooled, so maybe it would be better as a cold soup, but as it was, I am not a fan. However, as peanut butter is my boyfriend's favorite food, he has a goal to try any and all peanut butter recipes he finds. He ended up eating it all (I assume anyway...I sent it home with him in a container which came back to me clean and empty), so I guess for the peanut lover this is decent.

This is very similar to the peanut soup recipe I've used for many years, except I finely chop the onion and celery and saute both until tender, and don't puree it.  I also add a dash (up to @ 1/8th tsp) of cayenne to give it some pep. Better to do this to taste...remember, it will get stronger as soup sits.  For those who thought the soup was too bland, this might help.  Also, try a bit more salt and ground white pepper.

This recipe is great! I did make a few modifications to it. I am vegetarian so I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I also increased the amount of peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups. This is a good recipe but the garnished chives on the top make it so much better. If it did not have the chives on top it would need something else to help with the flavor. Overall though, great recipe.

Very good soup. I have ate peanut soup @ Washington's Mount Vernon. Easy to make and I will make again.
