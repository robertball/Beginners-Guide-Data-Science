These were very good--the only thing that I found was that using 1/4 cup milk made the frosting too thin--next time I would decrease the milk used for the frosting

These cookies don't stand a chance with our family ... we love them best hot from the oven. I've never tried the frosted version ... I don't get the chance to frost them. Also WONDERFUL with a cup of coffee. This recipe is a KEEPER. One tip: measure your flour by spooning into a cup, not cup into flour; cookies will be too dry measuring incorrectly.

Absolutely perfect sugar cookie. Simple goodness.  I made them for a recital tea and they were the ideal accompaniment with coffee/tea/punch. I also made a batch with raisins and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking (instead of the frosting)...I liked this variation even better.

These cookies are very soft, but don't have a lot of flavor. Pretty much all you can taste is the frosting. The frosting is pretty good, so that isn't a big problem. Because I made them for my little siblings, I skipped the nuts and used colored jimmies instead. The cookies look really cute, and the kids seemed to like them! I will probably make these again. Thanks!

If I could give this more than five stars, I totally would. These just melt in your mouth. I don't know why I just added it and never made it for so long.  When I made the frosting, instead of plain milk, I used a little leftover eggnog. OMG. These cookies are to. die. for. So going to be making these again. For other people. Because I'm dieting. EDITED: You might want to chill the dough for a bit, like I did. Otherwise, it's just a little too soft. They might run all over.

While I actually prefer simple drop cookies when baking ('cuz I'm lazy like that), I have to say I am more than willing to go the extra step with these cookies.  They are absolutely delicious.  The only change I made was to use buttermilk instead of regular milk in the frosting.  I also sprinkled Christmas jimmies on top.  These were the first cookies gone from the multitude that I made this season.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Pretty good. I had some buttermilk to use up... the cookie is cake-like, without much flavor by itself, but good texture. Since it's cakelike, it starts to get soggy if you leave it in an airtight container; best to store it uncovered. The frosting was too sweet for me, next time I'll use less powdered sugar.

Got snowed in today & decided to use up my buttermilk.  The whole family loved them! Very easy to make & tastes great!  I used cinnamon sugar instead of icing & everyone said they taste better than the store bought ones I had paid over 3.00 for 6 big cookies.  I wont be doing that again. thanks for the recipe.

I thought these would be boring and flavorless, but they are soft and delicious! We dyed the frosting pink and put a few sprinkles on top. If you have buttermilk sitting around, make yourself a sweet treat!

Love them!  Like others I had extra buttermilk so I made them.  Everyone loved them.  Next time I will skip the frosting and try the cinnamon sugar instead.

These light and buttery cookies were a huge hit.  They are absolutely delicious without being overwhelming. I didn't even bother with the nuts and they were still absolutely fantastic.

delicious and easy!  i ended up making four batches of these over the course of two weeks for various get-togethers and a bake sale, and everyone raved about them!  my roommate suggested a sugar glaze instead of frosting, which ended up being just the right amount of sweet.  they go great with coffee or tea!

I made the basic recipe and it was good but needed a bit more flavor.  Instead of the nuts I toasted some sweetened flaked coconut and dipped the newly iced cookies in that.  Absolutely delicious!

Yum, Yum!! These are great! Very soft, not too sweet and yet a distinct flavor from the traditional sugar cookie. I did not frost them but I'm sure the frosted version is good too. Recommend that you give it a try. Plus it is super easy, always a bonus.

I love these so much!  The last time I made these, the icing was a bit thin.  It was more of a glaze than an icing.  These are great no matter what the consistancy of the icing is though!

I have been making these since I first found the recipe in a Taste of Home magazine. These are our all time favorite cookie. We are making some today! They are melt in your mouth tender, but the frosting really makes them special. Santa really loves these, also! (At this time of the year, I usually divide the frosting and color half red and half green, to make them more festive looking.)

I doubled this recipe and accidentally quadrupled the buttermilk, I used 4 cups. The batter wasn't runny at all, just a tad gummy.
However, the cookies turned out great. Soft and puffy and yummy.
I didn't frost them but did sprinkle with cinnamon sugar before baking. 
I liked them a lot, this recipe will replace my sugar cookie recipe since I like this texture much better. 
I think they'd be great with frosting, just too sweet for my husband with diabetes and twin toddlers.

Good, simple cookies. If I have buttermilk that I need to use up, I may make them again. Maybe.
