I really like how simple and adaptable this recipe is and will almost definitely be making it again.  The seasoning on the chicken is simple but delicious.  I ended up leaving out the brown sugar and even though I had the cornstarch slurry mixed up and ready to go I decided it was unnecessary as there really wasn't much liquid to thicken.  The flavors aren't quite there on their own, but that's ok because it was totally condiment-ready.  I topped mine with a little sriracha and soy sauce and my husband topped his with sriracha and sweet chili sauce.  You could absolutely use whatever kind of veggie you have on hand in this one.

I started with chicken cubes that were already cooked, so I stir fried the other ingredients and added the chicken last.  The sauce was better than I thought it would be but adding soy sauce at the table as well as some crushed red pepper flakes made it 5 stars over rice.  I also substituted green pepper for red pepper in the vegetables because that's what I had.  The red pepper would make it VERY pretty.  I might try it again with the red pepper.

Great recipe to inspire. We try to use fresh seasoning- so used fresh garlic and ginger which will make it spicer. Speaking of spicer I also added a teaspoon of Sambal Olek (chili paste) and some crushed pineapple. Also didnâ€™t have jimca  and added cauliflower with the broccoli. Peanuts top it perfectly!

I was surprised at how much we enjoyed this!!  I was thinking the sauce would need more,  but all it needed  was a little salt :)  Left out the mushrooms, thanks!

We made it and found it to be okay.  There just wasn't enough flavor for our suiting.

Changes:  brown vs. white rice, fresh vs. ground ginger, added bean sprouts and other veg. on hand.  With the extra veg, it needed a bit more corn starch to thicken up the broth.

Could not find jicama.  Used parsnip instead.  Worked just fine.  Suggest steaming parsnip cubes until about half tender, then incorporating as directed.  Also used cashew nuts- unsalted- as directed.  Very good meal!
