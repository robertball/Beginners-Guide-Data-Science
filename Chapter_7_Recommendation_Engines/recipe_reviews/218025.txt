I made this today with a bunch of blackberries I had to use. Like one of the other reviewers, this recipe is UNGODLY sweet.. I would reduce the sugar in the water mixture to 1/3 of a cup.  I would also add cinnamon and maybe some vanilla to the cake mix. Its good, dont get me wrong, but my teeth hurt from eating it!!!

For requiring so few ingredients, this cobbler was awesome!  I added some cinnamon to the blackberries, and cut the water back to 3/4 cup.  Served warm with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks, AshleyElaine, for the recipe.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe and I make it a lot in the summer using berries and other fruits of the season.  Easy and simple.  I do not use as much sugar as called for, as we prefer a cobbler that is not quite so sweet.

So this is pretty good, but it's assembled a little oddly.  I looked at the directions several times, mentally shrugged, and then followed them.  I'm surprised no reviewer commented on it, but it says to put the cobbler under the berries, not on top.  It worked okay--I guess, but I kept thinking it wasn't done since the middle was still liquidy--that was the berries, not the cobbler.  I'd reverse it next time, bc it makes a good cobbler otherwise.  I did use less sugar, and splenda instead, and it worked well.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely love blackberries but very expensive in the shops here.   Fortunately right now they have a special so a wonderful excuse to try this.  The only fault was the sweetness so reduced the sugar by almost half and added 2 tsps. of fresh lemon juice.    Thanks for a nice simple cobbler........

I used 3 1/2 cups fresh blackberries, 1/3 C. white sugar in the water.  For the batter I used 1/3 C melted butter instead of oil, and 1/2 C Bisquick & 1/2 C organic multigrain baking mix from "Inn On the Creek".  Loved it... not as rich with less sugar so I served it with whipped cream.  ;^)  One of the best desserts for summer.  Thanks for posting it.

Good but very sweet. My son loved it but I like to have a tiny bit of tartness in a berry filling. I will make again and maybe add a little lemon juice to the berries/sugar mixture.

I save bananas that are too ripe in the freezer.  I thawed one & mashed it up, added 1 tbsp of sugar and we were good to go!  No oil!  Also added chopped pecans to batter because they were on hand, and it was delish! Used a lot less sugar in fresh berries also!

I made this for my husband's company picnic. I ended up doubling the recipe. I took other people's suggestions and added lemon juice and cinnamon to the blackberries. I didn't add the 1 cup of water since the freshly picked blackberries produced their own juices when I add the sugar to it. Followed the cake exactly as indicated. I put parchment paper on the bottom of the baking pan and put the blackberries on top of the paper and the batter on top the blackberries. After they were done baking and let it cool for about an hour, I flipped the pan over on a big plate and garnished it with more fresh blackberries. It was pretty sweet but I like it that way to counter act some of the tartness of the blackberries.

Oh my gosh!!  This recipe is perfect just the way it is.  The best cobbler I have ever made.  My husband said that was the best cobbler he has ever eaten and my kids loved it too!  I barely got it out of the oven and it's almost all gone.  Next time I am going to double the recipe.

I had frozen berries that thawed with a lot of juice so I did not use a full cup of water.  I only used 1/2 cup of water with 2 tsp of lemon juice and cinnamon as suggested.  This turned out tangy and sweet.  The Bisquick mixture bubbled up between the berries and turned nice and golden brown.  Great with vanilla ice cream.

I am going to make this the second time - just like I did the first -- here are my modifications:
1.  Used a 13 x 8 pan. 
2.  Had closer to 3 cups of blueberries and 3 apricots
3.  Added about 1/3 more of the bisquick, sugar, milk to the cobbler portion
4.  Added about 1 tbs cinnamon and 1 tbs lemon juice and 1 tsp pure vanilla extract.    
put in the oven for 40 minutes or so.

I made mine just like the recipe called for, but used mix fruit (blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, peaches), and it was delicious.  Syrup didn't thicken too well, even after an additional five minutes cooking, but overall, it's a great addition to the arsenal.  

Little dollop of whipped cream on top really satisfies.

I made this recipe exactly as written the first time and found it to be too sweet even though it had a good flavor.  Just experimented with it last night. I used the cake portion of the recipe and instead of the fruit/sugar/water portion added a 29 oz. can of drained peaches and lightly sprinkled a brown sugar/cinnamon mixture on top before baking.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  I think the next time I make it I'll try some type of fresh fruit just thrown in.  Easy to make and thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was a simple recipe to put together which was great-teaching the 10-year-old Grandson some cooking skills. I baked it for the recommended time but it was a little dry. Also, the instructions (and I have a degree in Home Economics and am not a beginning cook) were a bit vague at the last sentence in Step 2. Some may wonder if only the berries are to be added or also the sugar water. Maybe saying " Spread the berry MIXTURE" or  "Spoon berries over batter followed by the sugar water evenly distributed over the top", Or a note indicating that it may seem too watery but that"s ok"

Followed to the the letter, but made one deviation.  Instead of oil, I used applesauce - two healthy tsp.  Kept the 1/3 cup of sugar, but reduced the berry sugar by a half.  Came out very good.  Baked it in a 9  inch glass pie pan in my toaster oven - 35 min.  Very very good.  
The berries were thawed from a frozen state, but the cooked up beautifully.

Bought blackberries at the farmers market because they looked soooo good. Now I had to find a recipe for cobbler. Liked the ease of this one and followed the comments about using less sugar with the berries. The cobbler was delicious, easy to make and a hit with the family. Will definitely keep this recipe and try it with other summer fruits. Thanks for sharing.

I was in a bind and looking for a quick dessert to "throw" together - this was perfect as I had everything on hand - easy, fast and was yummy with a dollop of cool whip! The only thing I did was combine blackberries with blueberries because that's what I had in the freezer, and added some maple syrup to the batter. Thanks!

Made exactly as written. It's a very good cobbler, next time I think i will use less blackberries, it did not seem to need 2 cups with the amount of baking mix.

This was SO quick and easy to make!  The sugar/water combination makes a glaze that keeps the batter nice and moist.  It is a bit sweeter than I'd like which is the only thing keeping me from rating it five stars.  I used fresh blackberries and it was delicious served warm with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.

Delicious!!  I used my homemade substitute for Bisquick and it worked well.  I also used defrosted frozen mixed berries and cut back slightly on the sugar.  Perfect dessert with vanilla icecream!!!

I am in the middle of making it now. I did 1/3 cup of sugar to 1 cup of water. I also added a loose handful of mint to the sugar & water, put it in the microwave for 30 seconds, then whisked--to create a quick simple syrup. I am hoping the water will cook off in the oven. I am NOT a baker & we ended up with things I never use: fresh blackberries from a farmers market & baking mix from when a friend emptied out their pantry recently.  I hope this works! I don't like overly-sweet desserts. (I know...this makes me un-American I guess, haha, but I like my desserts a little less sweet. I split the oil with some good, fruity extra virgin olive oil I have. So...we'll see. But, I am nervous!

This was a huge hit! Are used granulated Stevia instead of sugar. The brand of Stevia that I used indicated using 1/2 of the amount of sugar called for, which I did. No one was the wiser!!

Wonderful and easy for grandson to make with me.  As suggested we reduced the sugar and water mixture by 1/3 and added vanilla and cinnamon to the dough mixture.    We made one with the dough at the bottom and one where we put the dough on the top.  My grandson wanted to experiment.  It didn’t seem to make much difference.   It was all gone in 2 settings so I know it wasn’t good!!!

I don't know why this recipe is rated so high.  Everyone who liked it changed the ingredients.  I was in a hurry, making it with my grandkids so I just followed the recipe.  It's awful.  Way too sweet and runny, and not enough "crust".  I wasted $9 worth of fresh local blackberries on this.  My grandkids hated it.

I love this easy recipe with two modifications.  I only use 1/3 sugar in the water mixture.  When adding the berries to the cobbler, I only add a small amount of the water mixture with all of the berries.  This makes it not too sweet.

I made with fresh picked blackberries...simple to make and delicious. I read the reviews and opted to reduce the water to 3/4 cup and reduced the sugar I mixed with the berries from 2/3 to 1/3 cup. Perfect for my taste buds.

Made this last night with Husbands granddaughter and turned out horrible. We double checked every step and used fresh(just picked) Blackberries. While the recipe states that yes, that's a lot of water but not to worry. Worry as you will end up with a soggy mass of syrupy blackberries with half cooked mix on the bottom. Even left it in the oven longer hoping that would help. 
Not sure what could have possibly gone wrong but ours looked nothing like all of these photos!

Made it for second time today. Modified again making two cobblers at once. One peach and one strawberry with dabs of sweetened cream cheese on top.  I added tablespoon of almond extract and sprinkled in cinnamon to the batter along with tiny dabs of butter to top of batter. Towards last ten minutes of baking I sprinkle brown sugar for a crispy sweet bite.

I tried this recipe with leftover apples and cinnamon.  It was fantastic.  The small amount of sugar can be replaced by other sweeteners.  I would offer this dish for Thanksgiving confidently.

Actually, I haven't made the cobbler yet; I was just browsing for a Bisquick blackberry cobbler recipe.  We have two blackberry vines; one produces really tart! berries and the other pretty sweet berries.  When I saw how much sugar in your recipe, I thought "Egad!"  So I'm sure I'm going to reduce the amount of sugar, add some cinnamon and a little lemon juice.  Just want to thank you for the guideline :)

Very easy to make, but being a man I followed the recipe exactly. So when it said to add the blackberries to the dough mix I strained the blackberries out of the water/sugar liquid. About 1/2way through cooking I figured that didn't make sense and added liquid late. Waiting for it to come out  of oven.  Please be specific for us guys in recipes.

I have made this several times and it's my family's  favorite cobbler by far.  I adjust the amount of sugar based on how sweet my berries are. I also use three and a half cups berries. Our first pickings this year were pretty tart so I used the exact amount listed here. The later berries I picked were very sweet so I cut the sugar in half. I like to top it all with a light layer of crumb topping  before baking. The end result is crunchy on top and ooyy gooey deliciousness below.

I used local blackberries and substituted coconut palm sugar and also stevia for the sugar. I found that there was way too much water but it probably would be better to add a tablespoon of corn starch to thicken the liquid. I used 1/3 of stevia than the 2/3rds it asked for and its not super sweet as my berries had some really sweet ones and tart. Easy recipe.

Super easy to make. I used frozen berries (thawed completely) drained their juice and added water to that to make the liquid needed. No additional sugar required! 
*note* Place a baking pan under it to control oveflow.

I picked some wild black raspberries today and had to make a cobbler with it. I doubled the crust and put it on top like another reviewer did bc I was hoping for a crunchier crust. I also took another reviewers advice and added about a tblsp of cornstarch as a thickening agent (to the water, sugar and berry mix). Despite it not having a bit of a more solid bite the cobbler was delicious and I would make it again, with the revisions I just mentioned. I might even use shortening instead of oil, I'll keep you posted. For now, this will be my go to for a berry cobbler.

I followed the recipe except I cut the sugar water down to 1/3 cup sugar in the berries and doubled the crust as my husband loves the crust. Turned out perfect and was just the right amount of sweet.

Yummy, but maybe a tad too gooey. Next time I will reduce the amount of water I use for the berry mixture.

Excellent and so easy!  I made this using over 2 cups of fresh mixed berries.  Halfway through baking I also added 1 cup of oatmeal crumble as a topping, (quick oats, butter, brown sugar, cinnamon.) Made a great morning treat!  Thank you!

This was not a recipe that I will use again. I've never had much luck with baking mix recipes but decided to try again. It was dry and I don't like the fruit on the top.

I'm not convinced that this is a great recipe. I drained the fruit because the recipe didn't say to add the berries and water, just the berries. My cobbler was damp in the middle. I'll have to try it again. Also, I used raspberries and peaches and would add cinnamon, nutmeg and lemon juice to the next batch. With all that said, my husband thought it was amazing!!!!

As stated,mine was in the oven at the time I reviewed. Basically I used my Cherry-Blueberry pie filling-using cherry juice instead of the water.I cut back on the sugar a bit,adding a bit more cinnamon.I put the cake on the bottom {doubled}and fruit on top,but this recipe seemed to right itself up,which was like magic. Not overly sweet,this was hands down the best Cobbler I ever made. A golden crust.I took some to daughters,and she e mailed me that it was absolutely awesome and she had it for supper! The guys really like it too,this goes in my recipe box,and I will use other fruits as well in the future. An easy Cobbler to make.This gets more than 5 *'s.

Way to much sugar for my taste. Used about half for a little tarter taste.

We loved it and the only change I made was adding a teaspoon of vanilla.
