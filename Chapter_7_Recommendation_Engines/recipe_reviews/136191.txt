a word of warning,   the butter from the crust melted out of the sides of the springform pan and dripped on the elements and sometimes caught on fire, but burned out quickly....even at 300 degrees.after 20 mins tho the dripping stopped...i know this will taste amazing and i will add the comments for that after the event is over.

the event has passed and i have to say that this produces a cheesecake worthy of specialty dessert shops and coffee shops!!  beautiful presentation and the taste is even better!!  
Note:  i changed the chocolate required to melt and drizzle on top to a decadent dark chocolate to rave reviews!!

i didn't have caramels and couldn't find them so i  used smuckers caramel icecream topping. i put the caramel with a touch of milk in a pot and heated it on low until it was a darker colour and spread that on the crust with the nuts. then used the remaining in the contatiner to drizzle on top before putting on the chocolate and nuts then served  it cold. delicious!!!
