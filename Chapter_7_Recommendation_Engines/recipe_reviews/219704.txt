These were a hit! I only used 1 cup of morsels in the dough and just sprinkled a few on top and they were plenty sweet. Tip: Cream and Butter and sugars well - add the eggs one at a time incorporating each one then add your dry ingredients and just stir to combine. You don't want to develop the gluten in the flour. Spread into the pan and I baked for 30 minutes. Very tasty treat!

Very sweet but VERY good!  These wonderful cookies scream for milk, smiles.  We couldn't stay away from them, even enjoying them for breakfast the next morning.  Really, how bad can they be with oatmeal as a main ingredient, smiles.  This will be made again and again.  THANK YOU!

I followed the recipe except for using chocolate chips instead of butterscotch (thought I had some but didn't).  The dough was very dry and literally had to be pressed into the pan - there was no way of pouring it.  The end result was very tough and they were only baked to the minimum time recommended.  My husband asked where the chainsaw was so he could cut them up.  I won't be making these again.  The recipe definitely needs something - at least some vanilla.

Very tasty!  Lots of flavor and perfect texture.  I followed it exactly with the addition of one teaspoon vanilla.  These are definite keepers and better than the oatmeal scotchie cookies that I was too tired to make.  I creamed the butter and sugar until fluffy prior to adding the vanilla and eggs.  Wow!  Thanks so much for sharing these treasures.

These turned out wonderfully.  I followed the ingredients/directions (except only had 1.5 cups butterscotch chips) and while the dough was thick, it was easy to squish down into the pan.  Cooked 25 minutes and it was cooked through.  Great crunch on the top and soft, almost gooey inside.  Very sweet, but easy to cut up and make a lot of servings from.  Thanks for a great recipe - it was a hit!

This recipe was amazing as is.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe! Very moist and chewy in the center with a crisp top and edges! Next time for variation I may add caramel flavoring or cinnamon chips! Bet that's yummy too!

Really Yummy!  Everyone loved these.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and used both semi-sweet chocolate and butterscotch chips.  Definitely will make these again!!!

I made this very close to the recipe. I used old-fashioned oats, instead of quick oats, and I didn't add the extra butterscotch bits on top (only about 1 cup mixed in). It turned out beautifully! I baked it for about 25 minutes, and it was perhaps a hair underdone. Crispy bits but mostly soft and a little crumbly. As far as mixing: I did it the "bad" way (mixed all the flour, dry ingredients, and sugar first, then mixed in the butter, then mixed in the eggs). It was a bit harder to mix than I think it would have been if I'd done dry + wet separately then combined, but it turned out fine. The mix is a bit dry-looking, but tasted anything but dry when cooked! 10/10 will make again.

This recipe turned out great! I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, but otherwise followed instructions exactly. Reminds me of the cookies my mom made when I was younger. There is a LOT of butterscotch flavor, so it is very rich. Next time I might reduce the amount and add chopped walnuts.

As others mentioned, the batter was quite thick and had to be pressed into the pan like a crust or cookie. I reduced the oats to 1 1/4 cup and the chips to 1 cup. Baked for 25 minutes and it came out very nice.  I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry mixture. Thank you ABELAIRE for a nice cake. Will definitely make it again!

Nostalgic cookie for me.  Like others, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla with good results.   Also, I lined the pan with parchment paper which made lifting and cutting easier.  Will be making this again!

My husband’s grandmother and mother often made these as cookies and they’re one of his favorites. But he said these were even better because they weren’t as dry.  I loved how easy they were to make. Stayed fresh a long time.   I cut down chips by about a half cup but otherwise followed exactly!

I would love to know what type of oven was used for all of these great reviews! The 13 x 9 glass pan has been in my oven at 350 degrees for 40 minutes and the center is still raw dough! I just turned the oven up to 370, and I am waiting!

Super easy. Agree that it needs fewer butterscotch morsels; one cup mixed into the batter and then a handful sprinkled on top was perfect.

I just made these for the first time.  Oatmeal scotch cookies have been my favorite for years.  Many people mentioned that this recipe is sweat, it is, but honestly it calls for the same amount of sugar as other oatmeal scotch recipes.I did change a few things with the recipe.  I used 1 cup wheat flour, and 1cup all purpose.  Also like others mentioned, I added 1 tsp of vanilla.  They came out great!  I will use this again in the future.

My daughter and I made this today - we have no butterscotch chips in NZ, so we used choc chips, and I added a splash of vanilla after reading earlier reviews... we LOVE this!! So quick, so moist, so YUM!

I was using up my holiday supply of chips, so in went the butterscotch chips, milk chocolate chips, and some semi-sweet.  The chip variety was okay, but I would have liked some cinnamon and nutmeg added to the recipe for added flavor.

These cookies are amazing!  I made the recipe exactly as written.  The texture is exactly the way it should be for a bar cookie -- lightly crisp and brown on the top and bottom, but soft, dense and moist in the center.  The dough is excellent -- not overly sweet, which makes the butterscotch flavor of the chips stand out nicely.  I had a chocolate chip bar cookie recipe that I loved, but I think this one may displace it.
