I had more over-ripe bananas.  Used 5 bananas, ground some oatmeal in food processor (added 1/2 cup oatmeal), added nutmeg and cinnamon and choc chips. Reduced butter to 1/2 cup and didnt use brown sugar.  Increased flour until more cake-like consistency. Simplified by only boiling sweet potatoes and melting butter. Everything else mixed in the bowl.

Delicious! Didn't add the pumpkin seeds, but they would definitely add additional texture and flavor.  Made into muffins, baking about 20 minutes.
