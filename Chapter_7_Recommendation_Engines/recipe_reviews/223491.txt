Instead of sauteing the onion in vegetable oil, I used butter. The recipe didn't specify which kind of onion I should use, I used four large green onions. I threw in a clove of fresh minced garlic in with the onion when I sauteed it. I used a homemade dry ranch dressing mix, increased the bacon bits a bit and added a touch of Frank's Hot Sauce. The boys LOVED these deviled eggs--they ate every single one.

SOOOOO GOOD! I liked the cooked onion in this, though I didn't see in the directions about adding it in w/ the other ingredients, but I assume that you were supposed to, so I did, lol. Great flavor...will be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

2 thumbs up! I had never made deviled eggs before and didn't want to start out with just a basic mayo and mustard recipe so decided to give this a try. It's amazing! I cut the recipe down to 8 servings because I wanted to try it first and it's definitely a keeper. I didn't add any cheese because my husband doesn't care for it but everything else was to the T.

These are just amazing. I was concerned about the onions, so made less than a dozen eggs, but will be doing the rest of them shortly.  These are "slap yo' momma" good!!!

We loved these eggs. The sauteed onions was a amazing twist to these and everything just blended so well with these deviled eggs. Love the flavors.

My husband doesn't like Deviled Eggs but loved these!  I was taking them to a Super Bowl Party and he said he was going to tell everyone they were Alligator eggs and was horrible.  That way he could eat more.  Was out of fresh onion so I used some dehydrated onions.  Just soaked them in some water. Squeezed out the moisture and add them to the mixture.  Worked fine. Thanks for sharing!

So good! I'm pretty picky about my deviled eggs.  The seasonings in these ones are spot on. I love that they do not have relish or any other sweetness to them like many deviled eggs have. I might make a bit more "dressing" next time (or less cheese) since once the cheese was added in, the yolk became slightly dry. I also liked that the onion was sautéed so you don't get the sharp, breath-destroying onion flavor from raw onion.  The only thing I suggest is adding in a bit more bacon bits. These are my new favorite deviled eggs!  TIME-SAVING TIP: While I was cooking the eggs (I used my InstantPot), I mixed the dressing ingredients in a small bowl so it'd be ready to mix into the yolks later. I used a star tip and piping back to fill the eggs.

These are delicious!! I omit the onions and bake my eggs in a muffin tin at 325 degrees for 30 minutes (turn after 15 mins to avoid harmless brown spots) rather than boiling in water on the stove. It is easy and still yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

I made these exactly as written, and did not care the end result. I thought they were too rich, and the taste was off. There clearly are people out there who like this combination of ingredients but to me i was looking for that perfect bite, where creamy was balanced by tanginess. When you bite into these, you taste lots of cheese, onions and bacon, followed by a taste of the creamy but forgettable yolk mixture.  It actually made me feel nauseous.  For me,  i will stick to classic deviled eggs in the future.

Great change to our regular deviled eggs! To make it a bit on the light side I used fat free sour cream, 2% cheese, olive oil mayo and sautéed the onions with only a few drops of EVOO. I also reduced the amount of cheese and increased the sour cream for a creamier filling. Also added a tablespoon of sweet pickle relish to give it that 'twang' that we love! Awesome recipe...thanks for sharing mommyof3!

Made the deviled eggs for Easter. Great change from the norm but the onions were a little strong. Next time I make this, I'll try without onions. Otherwise good recipe.

Just made these today for Easter Brunch. Followed the recipe exactly (except I used real cooked bacon, chopped), and they turned out great. Lots of compliments. Will make them again.

I enjoyed the sauteed onions in these, they definitely reminded me of a loaded baked potato (minus the potato), but I found the filling a bit dry, next time I'll add extra sour cream.

These eggs were a huge hit at my daughter's baby shower.  We did 2 dozen eggs (48 deviled) and there was not one left over.  I did substitute greek yogurt for the sour cream though and omitted the diced onion as we thought the addition of onion powder was sufficient.  They were delicious!

Made two dozen and they didn't last long at all...way better than your basic mustard/mayo...the only thing I did differently was to dice up real bacon and fry it up making my own bacon bits instead of the baco bits....gives it the real homemade taste.

I love this recipe I made it with real bacon crumbled and added a bit of old Bay and sweet relish to it and it was banging! thought about next time adding some diced jalepenos to spice it up a bit but that's just personal preference.

More than 5 stars! I made this last night and it was absolutely delicious! It was the first time I made deviled eggs and I am so happy that I chose this recipe! The only change I made was to sauté the onion in butter, as it is a personal preference when sautéing. Otherwise, I followed this recipe exactly. It is definitely a KEEPER! Thank you to the submitter of this recipe!

I loved these! I added a squirt of regular mustard because I found them a bit on the dry side. I did not measure the bacon bits but it was at least double what was called for in the recipe. Very good. Will make again. Thank you for the recipe.

great recipe!! This is a keeper. I did not put in the onions as I wanted to get a taste of this recipe before committing to an onion flavor, but I will give the onions a try next time.  I added a bit more sour cream for a smoother consistency (perhaps incorporating the onions would have helped with a smoother texture).  I also added some dill relish. I used unsalted lemon pepper.

HOW exciting to find a GREAT deviled egg recipe.  I had some Rath Blackhawk John Morrell  maple bacon on hand and decided to cook it on the stove.  Instead of using the oil as suggested in the recipe, I used the fat from the bacon to brown the onions.  I cut up the bacon in small pieces and added quite a bit to the  mixture.  Did not have the ranch or the onion powder in my closet so I did not add those.  BUT the result was PHENOMENAL! The maple smokey flavor of the bacon made the deviled eggs taste like a MILLION dollars!  I immediately called my daughter who is a cardiologist and encouraged her to make THIS  recipe.  Needless to say. she was not crazy about all of the fat I had added, but I could not stop raving about these!  I should have known better than to call someone who works on hearts all day long!  I do remember when she visits us here in Texas from Utah, I hide all of the goodies and run to Central Market and stock up in GREEN things!  Wink! Thanks EVER so much for a yummy yummy YUMMY recipe!

These were delicious and definitely my favourite deviled egg recipe now.
I thought the addition of the fried onions was genius.
I didn't have any lemon pepper, only lime pepper so I used that and these eggs were still delicious!
Thank you for the recipe, mommyof3. : )

I did not care for these. I wanted to try the recipe  because it sounded interesting. I think it was too loaded. The onion was overpowering, that's all I tasted. Now, I do love onions, but this was too much. The other flavors seemed to cancel each other out and no one could tell what other ingredients were in them. I probably won't make these again.

These are the best deviled eggs I've ever had. I decided to make these sort of spur-of-the-moment and didn't have all of the ingredients listed. I made mine without the ranch dressing and cheddar cheese, but I don't think it took much away from the final dish. I'm a huge bacon lover (who isn't?), so I finely chopped 3 pieces of bacon and mixed it into the filling. I then chopped the last two pieces of bacon and used them as topping. Absolutely delicious!! There are so many ways you can tweak this recipe according to your preference. It's a winner!

I love deviled eggs and always look for new recipes. This one is one of the best ones I've ever made. Didn't add bacon but other than that followed recipe. Definitely a keeper

I made the recipe exactly as written.  It was just bland.  I like all of the ingredients, but I think it needed more mustard or more tang.  After making this, I probably would never add cheese to my deviled eggs again - too rich for me.  I didn't *not* like this recipe, but I would probably not make it again.

I made this recipe as an appetizer for our dinner last night and they were great! My children were pleasantly surprised by the bacon and my husband loved them. I will definitely make these again. Great recipe!

This would have been really good without the onion.  Not my favorite. Will do again without the onion.
