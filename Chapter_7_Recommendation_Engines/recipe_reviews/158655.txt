Wonderful nighttime beverage - especially if you are having trouble sleeping! I used skim milk and added a pinch of nutmeg. If I have a little more trouble sleepling I just might add a little shot of bourbon - whatever works!

My dad used to make me something just like this he called "Fairy Nectar". Knowing him, he probably added a little dollop of something stronger... Thanks for the cozy recipe!

Quite good :)
UPDATE: I changed my mind: VERY good! The secret is leaving the milk in the microwave for close to 3 minutes.

I have this often in the winter when it's soooo cold out. It's perfect just before going to bed. Try it with almond extract instead of the vanilla. Awesome!

This is a wonderful drink, I have used for this for years on end. It's "Fairy Food" to me, and is great to drink, and very calming. Leaving this for the fairies outdoors brings good things, if you believe :)

This made my insides and my outsides feel much more comfortable. My kids, too. I used NF milk and splenda.

Fond memories of warm milk and honey served to me by my beloved grandmother at bedtime prompted me to give this a go, particularly since I was curious about the addition of cinnamon.  I hadn't had this in probably 50 years!  It was ok, but the cinnamon and vanilla kind of got in the way for me, perhaps only because my memories bias me.  Whole milk, as I enjoyed this in my childhood, makes this particularly rich, creamy and satisfying.  In addition, just warming it was more appealing, easier to drink (and safer for children!) than heating it to piping hot.   This is a wonderful, comforting drink, especially for children, and especially if your grandma brings it to you in bed.

I followed this recipe to the T. It was good but its missing something. It might be good with a splash of chocolate syrup in it. Ok just tried it with about half a teaspoon of chocolate syrup and a pinch on ginger. It is HEAVEN.

I did 1/2 recipe to try this. And, it was hot and foamy after only 1 minute. I don't care for plain honey so I used corn syrup. I added the rest of the ingredients, and it really mainly tasted like a very lightly sweetened milk, but the cinnamon gave it a nice warmth. I think this is something you would have had have had as a kid to really appreciate it. My grandma used to drink milk warmed in a small pot at night when she couldn't sleep. Maybe, this is like today's microwaved equivalent of that? I did add some whipped cream on top and it was much better. With it freezing outside and just getting over the flu, this was a very comforting drink. I think I will go to sleep now ~ zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. 
Edit Note: I tried again with the honey and the recipe as is. Great!

It was just prefect. I needed something with honey to soothe my daughters throat. I double dosed the honey. Can't wait to try it with her favorite rasberry honey from our local honey store the next time I visit.

I omitted the vanilla -- maybe that was the problem.  It didn't quite have enough flavor for me.  It was very sweet and didn't have much flavor otherwise.  My sister, however, said it was the best thing she had ever tasted.  I guess it depends on your preferences.

This was delish.  I added a little more honey like some others had suggested and added just a little irish cream for the ultimate dreamy nighttime drink.

Dreamy indeed!  This delicious drink has been a favorite of mine for decades...I'm glad to see it posted on AllRecipes.com!  What I like best about Dreamy Nighttime Drink is it is very soothing, creamy, and a wonderful alternative when I am looking for something non-chocolate.

This was fabulously cozy!  I enjoyed it more than usual cup of tea before bed.  I followed the recipe exactly and then added a sprinkle of nutmeg with the cinnamon.  Next time I will only heat for 2 min and 45 sec, because mine overflowed in the microwave.  I will have to share this with friends.

Perfect!  I came on to allrecipes this Saturday night because I was in the mood for a cozy drink.  I typed in "drinks" and this recipe was one of the first ones on the list that popped up.  I sounded just like what I wanted.  I just made 3 cups (1 for me and 1 for each of my sons).  It's a hit.  Love the dash of vanilla!

This is great!! I added the almond instead of vanilla as suggested by someone and it was WONDERFUL! I had 1 tsp. 1/2 of honey with the almond because I was afraid double would be too sweet. It was very good! I made it again today and doubled the honey and it slightly too sweet. But still good, I would only do 1 tsp 1/2 next time though.

Very good!  I added 3 teaspoons of honey, sprinkle of both cinnamon and nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to 1% milk.  I also only microwaved the milk for 2 1/2 minutes.

I also add a tiny pinch of nutmeg on top and a drop or two of almond extract as well as the vanilla just because I have some. My 6 year old LOVES this drink and has requested this when he has a cold or can't sleep. I also enjoy a cup of this every now and then myself on those nights I'm tossing and turning, it's very relaxing and quick to make!

Tasty little treat that couldn't be more simple.  Watch your milk closely so it doesn't boil over.  I've come to like mine with pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.

I don't know what compeled me to try this drink considering I dont even drink milk. However... I am so glad I did try this. This was a VERY good drink. Writting this review makes me want one now. I will say that if you don't drink this fairly quickly, the cinnamon will settle to the bottom. I reccomend having a spoon handy just to stir every now and then.

This is a nice ending for the evening before going to bed. Does it make you sleep better? I don't know but it can't hurt! Just a nice way to slow down just before you go to bed. Have made several times.  I do add a little more vanilla, honey & cinnamon than called for. The 1st time I made this I did follow the recipe as written.Thanks for the idea.

This is ok.  I drank it all and it was pleasant enough, but I don't think I will make it again.  The only change I made was that I used Almond milk as that is my favorite milk.

Wow, I really enjoyed this.  I wasn't sure how much I'd like it, but was pleasantly surprised.  I did what a few others suggested and added two teaspoons of honey and I also added some nutmeg.  The arroma reminded me of my grandmother's bread pudding.  I will definitely be drinking this a lot before I go to sleep.  Thanks for sharing!!

This was a hilarious experience.  Apparently the microwave in my residence is extremely powerful, so needless to say after 3 minutes I had a great big foamy mess to deal with.  Despite this, however, the milk was perfect!  I took the advice of others on two teaspoons of honey, and since I didn't have cinnamon I used nutmeg.  Tasty!

I've been making this for years, and it works great.  It is not only the warm milk that does it, as honey has also been found to help induce sleep.  I add more honey as well as more cinnamon, and sometimes nutmeg.

good and simple recepie. one or two crushed green cardamom capsules can also be added for some extra flavour and 1 or 2 strands of safron gives it that extra color and richness.

Simple to make and had a very good taste. I did  change honey to 2 tsp. and the vanilla to 1 tsp. I also added 1 drop of red food coloring to make it pink. I topped it off with semi-frozen cool whip, pipped on top of the milk which I then renamed it "Princess Milk". Worked for my 3 yr. old granddaughter and it was something she could help decorate.

I accidentally tried it during the day, (was immediately warm and sleepy) it was wonderful though! I used 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream instead of the vanilla extract. This helped cool the milk & also made it more creamy.

This drink was perfect for anytime of day but I agree best at night! I added extra vanilla and a little cocoa powder. Hope this helps!!!

This was dreamy.  I eyeballed everything.  I used really high quality vanilla and cinnamon (from Penzey spice) and didnt need any extra sweetness.  I wont drink milk straight, but this is delicious!!

This was very good. I had to add a bit more honey and cinnamon to kick up the flavor. I also added mini marshmallows on top to give it some additional sweetness. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Both simple and sweet!

This was very relaxing and comforting.  Although, I'm not a huge fan of the flavor of warm milk.  I ended up needing to add more vanilla & cinnamon.  Will make it again.

I didn't measure so I think I added a bit too much honey but besides that it was a nice change from hot chocolate. Very relaxing to sit and sip. Next time I may add a splash more vanilla and try nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice in place of cinnamon.

Stellar! I took scarletwind82's advice and added "a touch of splenda, and a double shot of honey." (I found out that a tad more vanilla didn't hurt, either!) Thanks scarletwind82! Yummm!

Yummy! Tastes like chai, but without the caffeine so it's okay for bedtime (or anytime). I did double the honey, but I like it sweet. I accidentally added way too much vanilla and cinnamon last time I made it, and it was still okay, so don't worry about measurements. This would be amazing with a little Bailey's or Kahlua. It's nothing terribly unique or amazing, but I'm giving it five starts because it is just plain yummy and SO simple :) I will make this often.

Loved this! I usually don't like anything but chocolate in my milk so I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this.  Next time I'll try adding some nutmeg as others have noted, maybe some bailey's too.  Thanks!

I made some caramel sauce yesterday that was really good, so I added a half teaspoon of that, and I also added about half a teaspoon of spiced rum.  I split this between my husband and me, and we both really loved it.  Thanks very much, Essiemay.

I  am lucky to have discovered this drink during my last month of pregnancy.  I have been drinking warm milk to help me sleep, but find it pretty unappealing.  This recipe makes it delicious and really helps when I'm having trouble sleeping.

this drink was good but it felt to me that it needed a little bit more of honey. with the cinammon i chose to instead put it to heat up with the milk instead of after and i put a 1/4 of a cinammon stick for that. thank you!!!!

Okay, but nothing to rave about. I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was just like a cup of hot milk with a hint of sweetness and vanilla. Perhaps adding more vanilla extract or coconut extract would add to th flavar. I don't know . This was jsut okay.

This was great!  So quick and easy.  I doubled the honey, like most reviewers did and I actually increased the vanilla to approximately a half teaspoon.  I really couldn't see what two drops would do and I love the vanilla flavour, so I definitely wanted to taste it!  It was perfect!  The only mistake was having this right before my favourite show....It definitely worked on the sleepy end!

This drink was very relaxing.  3 minutes was far too hot and I had to let it cool off for 2 minutes before drinking.  I added 2 teaspoons of honey.  I added 2 dashes of nutmeg as recommended by another user and really enjoyed it.  Don't forget the vanilla!  It definetly gave it the little extra it needed.

Had a big mess in the microwave as cooking the milk for 3 minutes was way too long. The milk boiled over. That being said, the drink tasted great. Will definitely make again but I think that next time, 2 minutes in the microwave will be enough.

Ok, this is good as is, but this is what I did to make it to my taste... increased the honey like other reviewers suggested, used pumpin spice also, and extra vanilla. I made this in my latte/cocoa maker and it was so good and frothy. I like Chai tea and this was very good without the cost of going to a coffee shop!

It was very yummy! I added another tsp of honey and another drop of vanilla extract. It was very good but almost too sweet.

This is soooo good, as a child we always had warm milk with honey at night time, the vanilla and cinnamon take it to the top (-:

I love this, but it really is just flavored milk in the end.  I doubled the honey, added extra vanilla, and put in pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon.  Delicious!

Very warming from the inside out. I only needed to microwave the milk for less than 2 minutes before it would start boiling over, however. Don’t do 3 minutes right off the bat if you have a newer microwave! I also doubled the honey and added almond extract in addition to the vanilla. Very good! Would be especially good with a little rum or Irish cream, I think. :)

Heavenly!! I added a little heavy whipping cream and a dash of cloves and nutmeg.   What really topped it off was a little Crown Royal Vanilla. My new bedtime beverage!

This was a nice, soothing drink. It's a bit bland - I recommend upping the honey a bit, and adding a dash of almond flavoring, and some nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon.

I will make again. Now- to wait for sleep.

LOVE!!  I was laying in bed trying so hard to fall asleep when I decided to go in search of a warm milk recipe. I instantly found this one and jumped out of bed to try it!  I doubled the honey (only because I tend to triple the amount of honey in any recipe because I just love honey) and my microwave gets super hot super fast so at a little over a minute left I was boiling over!  Lesson learned!  It tastes like nothing I have ever had before. I love it!  I can see myself having this every night before bed to help me sleep. But I may have to double the recipe because I don't fall asleep easily. I am so excited over this recipe!!!  Thanks for sharing!  I can honestly see this as a new family go to as part of our bedtime routine!

This has the most marvellous taste. I was honestly skeptical as to how it was going to be. The only differences i had was, one drop of imitation vanillia ( only because i didnt have vanillia extract ) and substituted the 2nd drop for some 80 proof. Kentucky straight bourbon. And just alittle more ground cinnamon than a pinch. To start i took one normal shot of the 80 proof Kentucky straight bourbon and after that began to drink the warm milk. And i can tell you fron the start of this review until now im noticing myself getting more and more drowsy.  So yes i highly recommend to anyone having sleeping issues.

Just made it and think it's alright. I wasn't too big on the milk. I think maybe vanilla almond milk would have gone better with this.

I've made this a number of times now, and it's consistently delicious & comforting! The very first night I tried it, it worked like a dream! I fell asleep in ten minutes after drinking it. 

For my microwave, about 2:45 is a good amount of time, but it will vary for everyone. Any more time than that and  it almost scalds it for me. 

I do want to mention that I double the honey, and the vanilla extract and am pretty generous with the cinnamon! I stir cinnamon into the drink itself, and top it off with it for a garnish. 

I loved it so much, I've even shared the recipe with my mom! :)

It is very good I added more of everything because I felt like the warm milk over powered everything

I didn't like the recipe as written, but when I added an extra tsp of honey it was so yummy, cozy, & relaxing! Almost reminds me of a skinny white hot chocolate. Still sipping it slowly... :-)

Amazing! Great tasting and makes you feel cozy! This is an amazing drink. I think I added a little too much vanilla to the recipe though. But otherwise it was great!

I decided to try out this recipe and see if it could help me get a good night's sleep after tossing and turning the night before. I used all the ingredients (I did add a dash of sugar) but eyeballed the measurements. Tastes pretty good. Hoping it will do the trick!

I wondered if anyone else made this drink. I didn't quite know how my grandmother made it so I experimented with this since I was a child. Difference is that instead of the vanilla extract, I used a teaspoon of butter and then microwave for 1:00 to 1:10 until the butter melts completely. A spoonful of honey (or sugar). I tend to use nutmeg over cinnamon which hurts my throat but I find powered chocolate works well too.

This hit the spot on this very chilly fall day! I really wanted something warm and cozy that was not coffee or hot chocolate and I found this. It is so simple to make and just the thing I needed! I will use this again.

If you add 1 tablespoon of coconut rum and 1 and a half teaspoons of brown sugar, it makes it a whole lot better!

Fabulous! Not sugary, but still sweet. I slept so well last night after drinking it (and currently I'm pregnant which sleep is hard to come by). I didnt have honey in the house so I used a little brown sugar. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I did add a pinch of nutmeg.

I've been horribly sick the last few days and was looking for something comforting, soothing and maybe to help me sleep better tonight. I'm still sipping it now, but this is delicious. I added just a bit of Truvia as well, and didn't really measure anything else. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for my ten-year-old daughter. She found the recipe and wanted to try it.. She has a cinnamon allergy, so we omitted it and added a pinch of nutmeg instead. Oh, and we doubled the honey. We both thought it was wonderful and soothing! Thanks for sharing!

Just started doing this but omitted the honey (chocolate chip  cookie on the side) and use cardamom in addition to the cinnamon.Have been sleeping like a well fed baby. Of course, you can always add a splash of cognac or Armagnac for extra flavor

okay I came up with this drink ages ago from experimenting and just found this on here, made it again and let me say, although it's good...it isn't that amazing. If you don't like milk but need to drink it, then this is perfect rather than adding all that chocolate and artificial flavouring :)

Made this in a small saucepan on the stove. Watch carefully because the milk starts foaming quickly! Absolutely amazing with a splash of chocolate flavored almond milk (also helps cool it down quicker).

This is sooo yummy.  Made it tonite before bed...added a little extra honey.  Didn't add nutmeg but may try that tomorrow night and (dare I say) a dollop of whipped cream!  Nighty night!
