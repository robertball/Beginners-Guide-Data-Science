Very tasty. Instead of baking in baking dish I baked them in the muffin pan, diced the apples and placed dough in pan filled with apples and poured sauce over. They looked like apple cups.

I love this Recipe! the only change I make is after you pour the orange juice mixture over the top of the dumplings then add the Cinnimon or All Spice, followed by chopped pecans.  If you make extra Syrup and chopped extra pecans save it to pour over ice cream as a topping! :)

Very easy and faster than some.  I only used half the butter to cut the calories and reduced the sugar by half.  It was still very buttery and sweet.  My husband loved it.

I have had this recipe 2 weeks and have made it 2 X's.  I use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar (didn't have enough white the first X) and it seems to make it more like caramel tasting and thicker than the first I had at my mom's.  I also use cinnamon sugar instead of apple spice.  Made a double batch and split it in loaf pans to share with my neighbor's, with a copy of recipe attached :)!

I chopped the apples instead of wedges. I had left over apple chunks, so I put them in with the dumplings. I didn't have oj, so I used cranberry pomegranate juice instead. I cut the sugar in half, and used ground cinnamon instead of apple pie spice. They were very good, the whole family enjoyed them.

These were pretty good. I cut back on the butter, orange juice, and sugar a little, yeilding less syrup-- but it turned out very well. I baked these for 20 minutes uncovered then for 5 minutes with a cover and served them warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I will probably add a little vanilla extract to the syrup next time.

Great! i didnt have orange juice handy so i used the juice from half a lemon and it was so yummy! I also used reduced fat crescent rolls and you cannot tell the diff. with butter over the top! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I cored 2 apples and cut each in quarters and wrapped in cresect tri. to cover, sprinkled on a little cinnamon and then pour the rest of melted ingredients right over  the top!

Quick and easy dessert. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Followed everything else the way it was written. Added a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was delicious!

These were good but the sugar carmelized and made them very difficult to remove from the pan.

These were DELICIOUS and very very easy! I followed the recipe exactly! However, I did place them in muffin pans like another reviewer suggested. I placed the cresent rolls in the muffin pan, cut the apple into small cubes and placed them on top of each cresent roll, then poured the sauce over them, filling to the top. These are amazing!

Really easy to make but anyone can tell that orange juice was used in this recipe.  The flavor of the juice is powerful when you first bite into the dumpling. But, my kids loved it.  If I made this again, I would cut the orange juice and sugar in 1/2, there was plenty of syrup and the orange juice is full of sugar.

The 'sauce' was completely liquid, no thinkness at all.  I think this could be tweaked to make it better, but a great start!
Also, I couldn't find Apple Pie Spice anywhere, 3 states, over 2 dozen stores.

Perfect!  I turned them over after 10 minutes to soak up more of the liquid, which I also halved like many other reviewers.  I also happened to use "Simply Apple" apple juice instead of orange juice, because that's what I had on hand, and I think that made it that much more delicious.  (Simply Apple is almost cider, but not quite).

Wow, what an AWESOME treat! I only reduced the butter by half and split the sugar - half white/half brown. Was SUPER YUM!!! I also substituted a tspn of Apple Cider drink mix instead of the apple pie spice called for in the ingredients. I also served with a sprinkle of cinnamon and apple cider drink mix atop the "dumplings". My husband and friends devoured these treats!

Extremely Easy and very tasty too! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar, and no OJ, only the juice of 1 lemon. I used jumbo muffin tins and about 3 slices of apple to one crescent roll.  It made 5 dumplings and I put a little of the leftover crescents on top of each muffin tin.  I sprinkled cinnamon, cloves, and ginger on top of each one.  Next time, (and there WILL be a next time!) I will put more apples in it.

I tried this dessert today.  I had my doubts at first.  Didn't know just how it would turn out.  But I have to say this recipe is very, very good.    And did I mention how easy it was?  Couldn't believe how quick and simple it was to make.  I didn't have orange juice in the house so I used apple cider.......and it turned out great.  I will be making this often during the fall season while apples are at there peek.  Thanks, Jean.  A great recipe!!!!!

These were very good.  I used the reduced fat crescent rolls and only 1 large gala apple cut into 8ths.  I then used 1/2 c. oj and 1/2 c. sugar and only 1 T butter.  I sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar before baking.  Baked for about 40 minutes and they came out so tender and delicious.  Very sweet but oh so yummy!   Thank you Jean for this great, simple recipe.

5 stars for the combo of ingredients...I did however use reduced fat crescent rolls and halved the amount of sauce.  The flavor was great.  Better than the citrus soda version.

Quick, easy, and delicious.  I also substituted 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.

I wanted so much to like this recipe.  The basics seemed very good  as well as being a quick, easy recipe. Reading through many of the reviews I decided like a number of people here to cut the sugar and butter in half, but kept the oj the same amount.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  The resulting dumplings came out with the tops browned nicely.  But upon serving it to my family, we found the  apples to be quite crisp and undercooked, while the  and the  undersides of every dumpling was very uncooked: soft, doughy, and rubbery.  My oven is pretty new and cooks everything (else) with out problems, so I'm curious as to what happened. And yes I did check the oven temp and the orange juice sauce was boiling when I poured it over the dumplings before baking. As for the sauce, it was still too sweet for me. I don't think it  I'd make again.

Wonderful! I used Mtn. Dew instead of orange juice because I never buy orange juice, and they were great!

This was a great. Quick and simple. I only changed one thing. I used Coke instead of orange juice. It  was delicious.

My family loved this.  I made it the first time without changes.  The second time I substituted apple cider for the orange juice and added some vanilla to the cider, sugar mixture.  I took someone else's advice and used half the butter.  Great hit for dessert or breakfast!

Great recipe!  1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c Baking Splenda.  Also cut the butter in half (1/4 c) and used 1/2 c crushed nuts (sprinkled over before apple pie spice). Yum!!!

Great recipe. I didn't have any orange juice in the house but added the juice from half a lemon and some cherry pie filling leftover from another recipe. I love it when random fridge items make something unique!  I also baked them for about 35 minutes to soften the apples more.
