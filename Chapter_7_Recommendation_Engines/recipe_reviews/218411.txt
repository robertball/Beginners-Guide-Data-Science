I made these today.  THEY ARE EXCELLENT!  WOW!  The only change I made was I added half a bag of Nestle's white chips.  They taste wonderful and look beautiful, as well.  I will definately be making these again!

I added the grated zest of a large orange to my batter.  These were some of the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made.  I highly recommend this recipe.

These were very good.  Not too sweet.  Tasted good for you.  I added chopped white chocolate, which made them prettier and tastier.

Simply amazing! It was a hit among my friends, though i took out the nuts (one friend has a nut allergy) and added twice as much cranberries in it's place. So great; soft, chewy, sweet and easy to make.

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a crumbly mess. I only was able to salvage it by adding some baking powder, extra oatmeal, and reducing the baking temperature to 325.

DH loved these cookies.  I like the nutty tart flavor.  Made as written except I threw in a handful of mini dark chocolate chips.

I just made these and substituted 1/2 C plus 1 Tbsp of light olive oil for the Crisco and they were excellent.  Sorry, Crisco, I know it's your recipe but I believe olive oil is a healthier ingredient.

Yes I liked the cookies but like everyone else I did make small changes to fit my tastes. I did not use cinnammon I used 1.5 tsp of pumpkin spice which has cinnammon in it but also a bunch of other nice spices. I also use 2.5 tsp vanilla but I do not think that most people notice but I do. Anyhow when I have chocolate lovers around I decrease the nuts to 1/2 a cup and add 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate. Depending on the size of your cookie the time is fairly accurate when I use my tablespoon cookie scoop its perfect but when that broke (ahhh) then I did it by hand and they needed a extra min or so. Overall I like the recipe and recommend it...they make alot of cookies so I would think twice about doubling the recipe unless you really need to either way they will definitely be eaten! :)

I made this cookies for the first time today, and my husband loved them. They are so moist. The combination of cranberry, and walnut really makes this a flavorful cookie. I'm going to put this cookie on my list to make for next Christmas.

Incredibly good cookies.  I also added a cup of white chocolate chips to my dough.  10 minutes was perfect in my oven.  I made these for a cookie swap and they went over really big!

cut back a little on the sugar and used only brown sugar. I also used multigrain flour. They were a hit from everyone!

Made these for a family gathering. As the plate got passed around the room and each person took a bite, words were replaced with mmmmmmmm, these are awesome! I made the recipe exactly as stated. This is a keeper!

Pretty darn good!  I would add one more ingredient to make it perfect - white chocolate.  But don't get me wrong - I had absolutely no problem scarfing these down.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't a big fan, but both DH and DD loved them.  Five stars for that, plus they were very easy to make.  I have a convection oven, so 8 minutes at 325 was the right settings for me.

These cookies turned out perfectly and the family loved them.  I liked the amount of oats and the goodies but found them too sweet for my taste - and I made the mistake of adding white chocolate chips which added even more sweetness. I should have followed the original recipe!  So I will try them again less sweet because the consistency was great!

I was looking for a little bit healthier but still yummy cookie. This is it!! I made them exactly as directed (except I used vanilla bean paste instead of extract), and they turned out great. They have an extra-special flavor. YUM!

These are very good.  I did add one cup of white chocolate chips, as other reviewers have done.  The chips made this a very sweet cookie-good, but one or two is plenty.  In a one-tablespoon size with the additiom of the white chips, this recipe made 51 cookies (would have made one or two more had I not kept sampling the dough).  I baked them the full 12 minutes for a slightly crunchy outer crust that dissolves into sweetness.  Good with coffee.  I'll try them a mix of butter & Crisco, the cranberries and walnuts next time.  If you enjoy really sweet cookies, add the white chips.

Delicious.  The only changes I did was omit the salt since I was already using salted butter and used 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of the walnuts.  Simply chewy!

I loved these cookies! They are the best oatmeal cranberry cookies! I added white chocolate chips to the mix. Also it's been a few days and they are still moist and chewy ! Yummy

These are really quite good. 

I used regular crisco as I don't have the butter flavored one and it was fine. 
I replaced the walnuts with chocolate chips (don't like nuts).

I am giving this recipe four stars only because the cookies are "not quite" as good as the preformed ready-to-bake ones that I have bought from fundraisers.  They were, however, delicious and disappeared quickly. I am keeping the recipe.

Tasty.  I added chocolate chips too.  Mine ended up needing about 15 minutes in the oven, a little longer than the recipe says.

great cookie. I added white chocolate chips in half and dark chocolate in the other half both awesome. i used only 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar and then I used 1/2 cup splenda.  then I used 1/4 cup shortening and the rest applesauce. turned out great cooked 14 min.

Excellent cookie. I followed the recipe as was except I added 1 cup of chocolate chips. Next time I will use wholewheat flour and reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup to make up for the chocolate chip sweetness.  Very nice!

I've made this recipe several times. It is now one of my fall go-to staples for cookies.  I did not modify anything, it works out great for me as is.

Followed the recipe exactly as written the first time and the cookies were a little dryer than we like. I made one change with the second batch. Added three eggs rather than just the two called for. They were perfect. Nice moist and a little chewy. We finished off all three dozen cookies in two days. Will definately make these again.

Family and friends really enjoyed this cookie.  I left out the nuts and replaced them with white chocolate chips. I definitely will be making these cookies again.

I doubled the recipe and used unsalted butter instead of crisco.  Also added white chocolate chips.  Great cookies!  Baked on sil-eco sheets on top of my cookie sheets so no added spray needed.

I made these cookies today with my 3 year old granddaughter. They turned out excellent. Followed the recipe exactly except I used 1/2 c butter & 1/4 c shortening since I didn't have the butter flavored shortening. These won't last long around my house so I went ahead & put some in the freezer for Christmas. Thanks for a great recipe!

I first made these for Christmas and now everyone requests them whenever we have a get together!

All I added was some white chocolate chips for added color. Amazing!
