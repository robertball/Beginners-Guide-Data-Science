Yum!! Marinated some chicken breasts and tenders in this for several hours.  Good flavor.  My boyfriend thought it needed more oil in it, and since he did the grilling, I cannot comment on that, but it would be easy to accommodate. I like the flavor combination, and will be making this again.  Thanks for this recipe!

Made a double batch of marinade for 8 thighs, as there just wasn't enough to cover the chicken. Good flavor, the lime really came through, and very juicy chicken.

Really nice marinade!  I was a bit shocked at the amount of marinade this made but I think it was because my limes refused to give me a decent amount of juice, despite coaxing!  I made 6 chicken thighs.  Husband undercooked it quite a bit on the grill, but the chicken I had before it went in for more cooking was very good!  Husband even commented on how good it tasted.  Unfortunately we didn't get to have the chicken as planned due to the cooking issue, but I tried some of the cooked part.  Yum!  Thanks!  Will be making again (and cooking longer on grill).

Excellent marinade!  It very much reminds me of island cuisine.  The only tweak I make is a tiny bit of fresh ginger (or ginger paste) added.  In addition to chicken, I also use it for shrimp (15-20 minutes max marinading time).  Thank you for an easy, wonderful recipe!
