This is exactly how I make mine lighter, only I double the amount of parmesan cheese. This is also dynamite if you omit the cilantro and use this as a base for spinach-artichoke dip. This is one of my favorite dip recipes.

Fabulous recipe that you don't have to feel guilty about! It really does taste just like a jalepeno popper! Even using used reduced fat cream cheese and reduced light mayo it was delicious! I also used light grated Parmesan cheese. I baked mine at 375 for 35 minutes and it went great with both reduced-fat triscuits and baked tortilla chips.

I have found that the new BluePlate Light Mayo is very tasty and believe me I am VERY picky about mayo.

This was delicious. After mixing the ingredients, I put it I'm my mini crockpot for about 1 and 1/2 hours. Everyone loved it! I served it with reduced fat crackers and cut up vegetables.

I added about 1/4 cup of panko crumbs (to give it a little crunch) to the top before baking and right before removing it from the oven, I added about 1/4 cup of shredded Mexican cheese blend.  The jalapeno popper lovers in the family loved this, the rest of us not so much.  Very easy to throw together and easy to control the heat level with the type of peppers used.

I made this for the first time a little over a year ago when I had an open house for the neighbors to see our newly-remodeled kitchen.  Everyone RAVED about this spread.  I made it again to take to a Summer Solstice party a couple of days ago, having been asked to bring an appetizer.  It is addicting!  I microwaved it the first time. This last time, I baked it.  Either way, it will disappear.

Great dip, if you want something spicy instead of boring onion dip! 
Only change - I chopped two fresh jalapenos instead of canned.

I omitted the canned chili's and went with fresh jalepeno's..  It was delicious with not too much heat.  Took it to a corporate party and everyone loved it!
