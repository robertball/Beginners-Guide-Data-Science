Really good on any fish.  Made it for my husband's salmon and my sea bass.  Equally good on both.  I oversalted so put in some lemon which toned that down.

The flavor in this is excellent but as written is is way too oily . I used this right away so there was no need to wrap it in plastic for later use. I highly recommend cutting the oil in half to start with and then add more if needed. Super simple and great flavor but the amount of oil needs tweaking.
