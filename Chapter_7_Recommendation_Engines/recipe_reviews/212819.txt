Just the filling I was looking for!  I was not able to find farmers cheese, but used a neufchatel cheese, which is suppose to be the american equivilent.  I used my own crepe recipe that was very similar.  They turned out beautifully with fresh blueberries and rhubarb sauce.  They were a great breakfast start to our New Year.  Thank you!

This was a stretch for my level of cooking but I really enjoyed the learning process!  I had never made crepes before and it took a little practice to get them to come out right.  The trick I found was to use a VERY lightly buttered / oiled pan.  I couldn’t find farmers cheese so I used unripened goats milk cheese.  It has the same consistency as farmers cheese but as it turns out it is a little more tart.  If using this cheese again I’d add a little more sugar to compensate.  With everything made I was now ready to roll up some blintzes!  I had a tough time getting them to stay together.  I googled some blintz images and saw that a lot were made into square pockets instead of rolls.  I put a dab of filling in the middle of the crepe, folded the sides in and then folded in the top and bottom.  I found it much easier than rolling and it stayed together a lot better, plus I could get a lot more filling in them this way!  I tried frying a couple up right away but this was a mistake.  They flopped open in the pan.  I let the others sit for a bit and they firmed up nicely and were much easier to fry.  All in all a great recipe and the end product was delicious.  I’ll definitely be making this again!

Very easy recipe to follow. I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now.  I found that it's best to use very little butter when cooking the crepes. I buttered the pan for the first one and never used butter again. It's easiest to pan fry them seam side down first so they don't pop open. My family loves them with strawberries and whipped cream on top.

I made another crepe recipe, but used the filling in this recipe. I added an additional tablespoon sugar and an additional teaspoon vanilla, plus a dash of cinnamon, and it was delicious!! My son, who is a huge blintz fan and one of my critics, loved them.  Topped with strawberry sauce and whipped cream made them restaurant quality. This is a great basic cheese filling that can be tweaked in many ways. I will make these again and again.

The blintz filling in this recipe is great! (I used another French crepe recipe I already had.) We had a family breakfast after Christmas, and everyone enjoyed these, with canned blueberry pie filling, and my favorite, raspberries! I used cream cheese in place of the farmers cheese and it was perfect!

This was a nice basic cheese blintze recipe.  I would add just a smidgen more sugar the next time to the filling.

This was great! I used whipped cream cheese instead of farmer's cheese, added a little more sugar & used 1\2 the amount of butter.  I had 2 non-stick skillets and flipped each crepe into the second pan for about 30 seconds, to lightly cook the other side.  After spooning 2 healing spoonfuls onto each crepe,  I rolled it up , sprinkled with powdered sugar and topped with fresh strawberries. Yum!  I will definitely make it again.

A very good blintz recipe.  Filling was smooth, creamy, with a touch of sweetness.  And the crepe recipe is a good, basic one.  Easy even for beginners once you do 1 or 2 of them to get the feel for it.  I'll be making this again.

This recipe for Cheese Blintzes is delightful... I had to modify it a little for our gluten-free diet, but not difficult at all ~ using a gluten-free flour blend. Very tasy! Thank you!
