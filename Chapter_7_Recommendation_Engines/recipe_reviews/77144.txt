almost the recipe that I learned to make in my 4 yr stay in spain,  but they didnt use any flour to coat the chicken, just browned the chicken in olive oil, then poured white wine over, with the garlic etc. tomatoes was the last ingred. if more liquid is needed, they used water......but use lots of garlic and onions, never used chilli powder or bacon, I like the orginal, that I learned in Spain.

Great recipe! My 8 year old couldn't get enough of it.  I skipped the dates, substituted the chili powder for paprika, the thyme for basil and didn't add the garlic powder, because it already had 4 cloves of garlic. Turned out awesome.  Served over wild rice.  Will make again.

This was very, very good. I had a lot of peppers from my garden, so I used them in here too.  I didn't have dates, so I subbed fresh figs.  I did not use all of the chili powder for picky kid.  I also seasoned the flour before dredging.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the post, fivestardramamama!

We LOVED this.  I didn't really know if I liked dates or not, almost omitted them, but thought, don't be a wimp!  So I followed the recipe as written, it is SO worth it.  Thanks for posting!

I *heart* this recipe.  I've made it several times, and shared the recipe with my family.  I even made it as a big sit-down dinner on our family ski vacation last year and not a drop of anything was left.  I made "Spanish Rice II" from this website to accompany it.  It also freezes and reheats well.

This was nice but lacked a little flavour. I added some paprika and a bay leaf which lifted it beautifully. Used prunes instead of dates as neither myself or my husband are fond of them. I think half a cup of white wine in place of half a cup of stock would also add to this dish. Will have to try that next time!

i also left out the dates. My husband and son both really enjoyed this dish, except that my husband isn't a big fan of all the bacon and onion bits in the end (he has texture issues). Next time, I will complete the sauce, strain it, and then add the chicken again for his sake. I also added a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I have no idea why people said this would take so long, it didn't take me any time at all.

Since my husband and I don't like dates, I didn't use them, and this dish still was great! I had a hard time with the breading staying on the chicken while it simmered in the broth mixture. But, that really didn't effect the whole of the dish. This was great the day after, too. The sauce was thicker and had a fuller, richer flavor to it.

A truly unique way to do chicken. I cut down the garlic to 3 buds and no powder, and it was delicious. I'll be doing this one again, soon.

This was a different and visually attractive way to serve chicken. It would be a great holiday meal servd with rice pilaf and salad with oranges/avocados. Too often my chicken dishes have an Italian flavor. Great change/easy/unique. As a cook who could ask for more?

Followed the recipe exactly... didn't hold up to all the other rave reviews.  The flavor just wasn't there.  I have NEVER understood why recipes tell you to bread and fry the chicken and then stick it back into the sauce just to lose the crunchy coating.  DO NOT do it... either skip the flour (as another review suggested) or cook the chicken all the way (possibly in another pan).  The recipe calls for two onions; you can get by with just one medium to large onion.  Before adding the ONE onion cook/fry the bacon first then add the onion.  The bacon will never get crispy if you cook it with the onion.  Add the garlic at the end to avoid getting a bitter taste.  Feel free to add more herbs or spices (another review suggested peppers) to bring in more flavor.

This recipe is awesome as is!  It does not take long to cook at all.  Not sure what those other people were talking about.  I don't recommend modifying this recipe at all!  This was sooo good!  My hubby loved it too!  I served mine with Spanish Rice and corn salsa. :-)

Fantastic! My family is Spanish and this tasted like something you'd find in your local tapas bar. I substituted raisins for the dates, don't skip the "sweet" ingredient , the raisins contrasted well with the saltiness of the bacon. My husband and kids loved the recipe as written, okay my son just wanted to eat all the bacon but that's fine by me! Thanks for the great recipe!

You CAN"T leave out the dates on this recipe.   People need to just make recipes and rate them.  This was great just as written.  Thank you Shelbi Bites!

Thank you for this recipe.  It was melt in your mouth chicken and kids loved it.  Didn't add dates though, and instead of garlic powder I ground a 1/2 tsp of cumin seeds....adds great flavour.  I am using this recipe as a guide to cook marinated chicken breast for dinner tonight.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  This dish is really good.  We finished it off in no time flat.  We all really enjoyed it.  I almost skipped the dates because I didn't have any, but decided at the last minute to run to the store.  So glad I did.  The house smells fantastic while it simmers, too!

I did not make this, but I did enjoy eating it. Chicken was moist and had a concentrated smoky, date flavor, that was very good.

¡Viva Madrid! This chicken is fantastic! A great pick for a romantic dinner. I omitted the onions and doubled the garlic, as the King doesn't like onions in his dishes - it was still amazing. A very elegant and classy meal for those who like the meat & fruit combo.               Make sure to cut up the bacon into thin strips and cook it BEFORE you add it with your dates to the prepared onion & garlic.->Right before you mix in the broth (step 2).  You don't want to end up with all that extra cooked bacon grease in your final sauce. Plus the bacon browns nicer on its own.  I also threw in some bay leaves & a pinch of paprika. ¡Buen Provecho! Enjoy!

I really liked this!  (My husband gave it a 3 so we averaged.)  I used 6 chicken tenderloins and didn't dredge in flour, which I think is just a matter of preference and either way works fine.  I had a hard time getting the bacon to brown - I think next time I will start with a dry skillet when I start browning the bacon.  I added a few more dates and really loved the sweetness that they impart!  The sweet/spicy/bacon interplay was a winner!   (On a side note - I made this while my husband made the Spanish Rice II that others served with this dish.  It's also a fabulous recipe, but I think I would rather have this chicken with plain or mildly flavored rice.  There was too much going on between the two dishes!)

My husband liked this recipe pretty well.  He thought the sauce needed to be thickened to serve over the chicken.  Also, he would have liked a bit more spiciness- some kind of kick.  I didn't care for it too much, but then I am pickier and was doubtful of the dates to begin with.

Outstanding.  I did this recipe with leg/thigh quarters and cooked them a little longer.  It was a huge hit.

I followed all the steps except the dredging in flour. I used chicken leg quarters because that's what I had. I finished it off in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours and it was magnificent! I also added some smoked paprika.

I used this recipe as a base. I changed things up quite a bit, but the flavor was incredible. I put the seasonings on the chicken and baked it instead of breading and frying. I used more dates than the recipe called for as well. I served this over wild rice but I think brown rice would be best since there are so many flavors going on. It was delicious!

Tasted excellent.  I did not add dates because I didn't have any.  I didn't have as much onion as is called for, so I added a bit of onion powder.  I was fresh out of bacon, but included some bacon grease.  I also added a dash of red pepper.  My picky eater husband loved it.  Served it with spanish rice and a side of corn.  Excellent dinner.  Will definitely make again.  Only problem was I couldn't get the flour to stick, but next time I'll probably back the chicken or figure out a crock pot version to make it healthier anyway.

Excellent quick dish!  I did make one modification, since we prefer cranberries to dates.  I substituted ~ 1/2 cup of dried cranberries for the dates.  Even my fussiest eater had seconds!

It is very good.  I was, for some reason, expecting something with a bit more spice or kick.  We made this for the World Cup finals ---fun!

This is by far my favorite dish that I have made. The flavors are so complex and they keep your palate busy! But the best thing, it keeps you wanting more!

I didn't know what to expect, but the sauce turned into a glaze that was really tasty. I did add extra seasoning, but I normally do anyway to my tastes. Someone mentioned issues with the flour sticking. One tip, soak the chicken in salt water the night before. Boil chicken for about 15 minutes. Lay out to dry. This way the chicken is soft and thoroughly cooked. With the chicken dried the coating sticks better. Other than that I followed it exactly. The dates added a nice contrast to the chili powder. I added double the broth at the end to create a sauce with the drippings/part of glaze not on chicken. We served over rice. It was delicious!

I made this with Spanish Rice II. It was a great combination. The sauce for this chicken was very good. Next time I will thicken it up a little more. Otherwise, this was a delicious meal and even better the next day.

I made this for my family last night and they loved it! I did add 1 tablespoon of Spanish paprika, a handful of Spanish olives and some sliced mushrooms. It turned out like an old-fashioned, rustic Spanish dish, reminiscent of my grandmother's cooking. Because it was so rich, I served it with plain white rice. Delicious!

This was absolutely delicious!  Even my 3 yr old liked it.  Follow recipe except omitted the garlic powder -- it didn't need it.  Served over plain rice.  Will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

WOW! This was so good, I will definitely make this again! Dates aren't everyone's favorite, certainly not mine, but when they're cooked in this meal it really adds a nice flavor I wouldn't want to leave out. There's no need to alter anything in this recipe because its wonderful as is. But a few peanuts might add a little crunch.

This was immensely immensely perfect!! My boyfriend followed the recipe exactly, and we're both atheists, and we kept wanting to say Grace because it was so delicious. The sauce ends up with a very sweet-savory flavor, and the chicken was very tender. In the picture of the recipe, there are peppers, but we didn't add peppers, and I wouldn't! We had it with cheap yellow rice from the store, which was very tasty.

Delicious. If you left out the dates, you should try it with them--they add a wonderful sweetness. Served with Basmati rice.

Holy cow, this is SO good!  I made it tonight for dinner, and I was praying that there would be leftovers for lunch tomorrow!  I'm only giving it 4 stars because if I had made the recipe exactly as stated, it would have been bland.

My suggestions are to (at least) double, if not triple the amount of spices that you use.  I used about 6 cloves of garlic, a tablespoon of garlic powder, 1/4 tablespoon of chili powder, and a tablespoon of ground thyme.  I also seasoned the flour that I used to dredge the chicken.  

In order to avoid any texture problems (boyfriend doesn't like "chunks" of onions), I did the 10 minute simmer on the sauce, then strained w/ a slotted spoon into my food processor.  After a few spins, I put it back into the pan and continued on.  This made the sauce slightly thicker than I imagine the actual recipe result is.  I also added the juice from a can of diced tomatoes, and used 1 Tablespoon of corn starch in cold water to thicken the sauce more.

I served with plain rice--the sauce had enough flavor to stand alone!

Very good !! Wonderful flavor and even better aroma as this cooks ! Quite easy to make as well. ( Except for chopping the dates !! Quite sticky!!) Made this pretty much as written. Slight changes in tenders instead of breast, didn't bread the chicken, added a little more chili powder, garlic and added some paprika. The wife really can't eat too much rice so made baked potatoes and then slathered them with cheddar cheese, salsa and sour cream. Excellent meal ! Will make again soon !!

I had just used up the last of my dates so I added some raisans.  Really, all you are looking for is the sweetness and the raisans worked fine.  This was good, but not enough zing for me.  I would add more Thyme, likely 1/2 tsp and double the chili powder next time.  I serve it with Spanish Rice and Black beans

Surprisingly great! The sweetness of the caramelized onions with the dates is nice and with the spiciness of the chili? Yumm! I used Serrano ham instead of bacon (also 6 slices). I didn't dredge the chicken either, which is probably why the sauce was very thin/watery. The taste was still quite good though! I only used two chicken breasts as well. I didn't use any thyme. I think that this is a four and half star recipe with my modifications. I am giving it a five star rating due to the changes that I made.

Really great base recipe - I didn't have dates and I omitted the garlic cloves because I decided to serve this chicken with garlic bread. I was worried that my chicken breast would turn out too dry but it was very moist and tender! Great recipe to add on to and experiment with!

This recipe was incredibly easy - I didn't have either bacon or dates, so it's hard to even say I made the recipe.  Added a little extra olive oil to make up for the missing bacon fat, and added raisins and chopped peppers to the pan.  It was still delicious and much healthier.  Next time I'll probably just use one strip of bacon, it certainly doesn't need all 6 if you're concerned about the fat or cholesterol content.

Great Dish bcuz the ingredients made me want to try it and timing was on point.  I did make some changes as I always do based on reviews.  I used a fajita frozen pepper/onion mix and added some additional frozen chopped onions so I know I didn't have two full onions; cooked my bacon first then chopped (bcuz I didn't read that correctly but I think I prefer it this way) and added half of the bacon grease for the flavor which would have been there had I did it correctly; NO dates and added 1Tablespoon cornstarch to the sauce at the end to thicken the sauce.  I did use all the chili powder even though my son hates it and he ate it all up without my usual intervention so don't be afraid to use it.

This would be 5 stars all the way if you halve the amount of chili. I didn't, and therefore it has a star deducted. We could tell that underneath the overwhelming spiceness, there was a delicious recipe. The dates truly add to the dish! Don't skimp out on them. It really made this a special dish, and one we will make again.

This was one of the single best recipes I've tried from All Recipes. I did not add the dates and substituted paprika for the chili powder to make it more authentically Spanish. SO DELICIOUS. I'll be making this one again and again. Thanks for sharing.

This was a little hearty for my taste. The bacon and onions lent it a very rustic flavor. My son enjoyed it more than my husband and I did. One thing, prepare to spend way more time than 35 minutes making this dish.

This was pretty tasty.  I left out the dates and the chili powder - substituted for paprika.  It didn't look anything like the picture which appears to show a drumstick... anyway, will definitely make again.

I substituted raisins for the dates b/c I didn't have dates on hand, but I think the sweet taste of the raisins worked out wonderfully!  I would recommend using a little less garlic than the recipe calls for and using raisins instead of dates.

Very good tasting. I'm just learning how to cook and this was a good starter recipe. I did give up on mincing the garlic though and grabbed the store bought minced garlic. I served it with yellow rice and peas. Very yummy.

This was quite good however there was an inordinate amount of liquid and onion.  Next time I will use half the amount of bacon, onion, and chicken stock...unless I want to put it over something besides the chicken.  My 13 year old raved about it!

We loved this-the bacon adds a nice flavor to the broth.  I served this over rice.

I thought this was wonderful. Tasty and different. I made a few minor alterations: Used less olive oil, used turkey bacon and added some thinly sliced zucchini to make it more substantial. I am sure I also probably used more garlic because I always do. I served this with brown rice and it was  very good. I'll be making this again.

I loved this recipe!  My family didn't even notice the dates until I told them, and they loved it.  I did use a turkey baster to remove some of the fat that accumulated in the sauce before serving.  I served it with couscous instead of the spanish rice.  I'll definitely be fixing it again.

Prep time was longer than expected.  Overall the flavor was good, this item would go well with chicken fried rice, eggroll and sweet and sour sauce.

it was delicious, and here are a couple of modifications i made. I cooked the bacon first and used some of the oil to cook the onions and chicken. I didn't have any dates so I used dried cherries. They provided a wonderful but not too strong flavor variation. I added some paprika for more color and I added some cayenne pepper for a little kick.

No changes made except I used gluten free flour. Wonderful dish with very tasty sauce. Somewhat time consuming so would make this again on the weekend, as opposed to a weeknight. I served on plain brown rice done in chicken stock; I think this dish served over Spanish rice would be too much and the flavors would compete with one another.

Was very tasty! Made as written, other than substituted smoked paprika for chili powder to make more authentic, and ended up with good chicken and A LOT of runny sauce. Had to add flour to get it thick, and while it had good flavor, most of it was a waste. When I make again, and I will, I will put a cup of rice in when reintroduce chicken and make it more of a paella style. Bacon and dates added interesting depth of flavors. Even my 10 year old liked it.

I made this recipe exactly as directed. My family thought it was just okay. It is not difficult to make nor does it take too long but with all the options out there for chicken, this one won't make the regular rotation.

I loved this recipe. It was so savory, sweet and spicy all at the same time. Like another reviewer, I halved the chili powder and added 1 t. smoked paprika.  My big faux pas was to serve it with Spanish Rice II, as suggested by a couple of reviewers.  I should have known that the green chilies and tomatoes (RoTel)  in the rice would overpower the subtle sweetness of the chicken.  And boy did it ever! I am making this again tonight with white Jasmine or Basmati rice. I may make a pilaf with garlic, onion and green pepper using chicken broth for the liquid. I will post the results.
By the way, I used Applegate  uncured Sunday bacon and sauteed it after removing the chicken from the pan. When the bacon began to crisp, I then added the onions and garlic. I then proceeded as written.

It's been a long time since I've found something I'm willing to take seconds of! It was very easy to make and easy to modify. I didn't have dates or bacon, but I had Tastefully Simple Bacon Bacon that worked well as a substitute. I added a teaspoon of liquid smoke to boost the flavor of the bacon bits and it worked great! But I will have to keep bacon on hand now so I can make it the proper way. I will be making this one over and over again!

This is easily one of the best dishes I have ever made. I made this exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. It seems like an odd combination of ingredients, but they really work perfect together. I wouldn't suggest leaving out the dates as they add a really great flavour to the dish.

sauce was good, not a fan of the bacon. Maybe if it was cooked ahead of time, or only a small amount added. This was overwhelming and fatty. IMO way too many ingredients for what the finished product turned out to be.

I used 6 boneless chicken thighs instead, and since I had no chili powder I created my own with 1/2 tsp each of ground cayenne pepper, cumin, garlic salt, paprika and oregano.  This turned out great!

Simple and delicious! I halved the recipe and used 4 dates and 4 slices of bacon. I found the bacon flavor to be overhwelming, so I would use 4 bacon slices and 4 dates for the entire dish. The sauce was also very sweet, so I added balsalmic vinegar which balanced the flavors. Also, I subbed oregano, cilantro/parsley for the thyme. And finally, I paired with simple saffron rice which soaked up the strong flavors. Yummy!

This was so good!  My husband and I loved it.  I didn't have enough chili powder, so I used 1 tsp chili powder + 2 tsp "Essence" that I had made from Emeril's recipe.  I also used 1 1/2 cups chicken stock + 1/2 cup white wine.  It was sort of like a spicy chicken marsala.  The dates were perfect - I was a little unsure about them but will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Kept everything the same except the chili powder... I added some to the simmering liquid and sprinkled some on top of the chicken.  I also cooked it at a medium-high heat, so it only took 25 min for prep and cook time.  Served with Spanish Rice II from this site, and both are great reheated.

This dish was delicious as written! Definitely a different mix of flavors. My husband walked through the door and said "What the heck smells SO GOOD?" We had it over saffron rice which bumped it up to 5 stars. It's definitely a keeper!

Wonderful. I doubled it for a big family dinner, and though it felt like a little too much work at the time, the end result was amazing. Yes, even the dates. I think the touch of sweetness they gave actually made the meal. Had a touch of indian flovor to me without being overpowering like indian cuisine can sometimes be. Thanks.

This was a great recipe and a totally different flavor than what I've been cooking.  The only differences that I made was seasoning the flour (just added garlic powder), omitted the dates, and substituted green onions for regular onions (boyfriend doesn't like onions) and added a dash of onion powder.  I also added just enough baker's sugar to not make it sweet, but tie the tastes in together.  

Great recipe, will definitely make this one again!

This really does take a while. I wish I had chopped everything the night before and cooked the sauce at the same time as the chicken. It would have been nice to have a large pan, as I had to cook each chicken breast individually. I thickened the sauce by mixing 2 tbs corn starch with 4 tbs cold water, then mixing it with the sauce. That worked well. I also used half chicken broth and half white wine instead of chicken stock. The sauce really wasn't impressive, for all the work it took. I would leave out the bacon. It was OK, not great by any means. I would make it again if it didn't take over 2 hours to prepare.

This dish smelled great while cooking, but the taste disappointed me.  The flour coating made the outside too soggy. I don't know what I would do to improve it.  Sorry

Amazing! It takes a little while, but is well worth the effort. I think I've found a new favorite.

The chicken was very tender and presented well but definitely not worth the effort and ingredients/expense.  Will not try again.

Loved this!  Even my friend's 8 year old (picky eater) granddaughter ate it up.  Easy, tangy flavors that mixed well. Tastes complicated and it surprisingly easy.  Have made it often.
