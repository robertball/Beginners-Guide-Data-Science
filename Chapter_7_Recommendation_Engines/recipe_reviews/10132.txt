These are excellent little on the go breakfast cookies. I substituted applesauce for the butter and they came out perfectly. I would definitely recommend doing this to get rid of the majority of the fat. I think they'd probably be good with some white chocolate drizzled over the top, but they're still coming out of the oven, so I have not tried that yet. Thanks for the great recipe!

These cookies were a pleasant surprise-the flavor and texture were delicious-my daughter loved them.  We also added raisins to the top.  Next time we'll mix in batter.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone who has kids.

These are absolutely yummy!  The grapenuts give the texture of heath bar, and the orange flavor is absolutely wonderful.  I will definitely try subbing applesauce for butter as mentioned earlier so I can share with my husband who cannot have dairy.  My kids (2&4) absolutely loved them.  Next time will definitely be a double batch!  (By the way, they freeze very well!...except they were only in the freezer 2 days because I couldn't control myself!!)

Just tried this recipe and it was great!  I added currents and slivered almonds to the recipe and they came out almost too good!  Thanks Susan.

These cookies are great! Please try these! However, I suggest using breakshop's raspberry n' cream granola instead of Grapenuts (or anytype of granola - but the raspberries gave a lot of really great flavor - plus, I don't care for grapenuts). I think next time I'll add some fresh chopped up raspberries, too, because I loved the raspberry flavor so much! I will surely make these again - my entire family loved them, and so do I!

These breakfast cookies are really tasty.  What a good idea!  They were pretty quick
and easy to make, and a great choice for when you need a quick breakfast on the go! 
(Almost every day for me).  The orange makes the house smell wonderful when you bake
them!

I first made these when my in-laws were visiting and everyone in the family from age 6 to 60 loved them!  We frequently make them using the pulp and zest from fresh squeezed oranges instead of using the frozen concentrate.  I have also made them using All Bran instead of Grape Nuts and they turned out great.

These are easily made vegan.  I use soy butter, brown sugar, 1/4 C applesauce instead of the egg and half wheat & half white flour.  I love them straight from the freezer!

These are great! I changed to 1/4 cup butter to 1/4 cup applesauce.  1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup dark brown sugar.  I used 3 tbsp fresh O.J. with pulp and 2-1/2 TBSP zest.  and I used 1/2 cup granola.  Next  time I will add 1 cup of granola. I needed a bit more crunch. Then after they were cooled I made a little orange glaze (1tbsp fresh O.J. and 1/4 cup 10x sugar) and lightly drizzled over.  These were so orangey and yummy!

I'm about to become one of those annoying people who changes the recipe then rates it. I added dried cranberries and chopped walnuts, which complimented the orange flavor nicely. To make these ok for the health conscious, I substituted applesauce for the butter, and half whole wheat flour. Quadrupling the batch and freezing the extras makes this a convenient grab and go breakfast.

I tried these with All Bran cereal and less orange zest (one tsp instead of 1 tbsp).  I used less orange zest because mine is dried and too much tends to be bitter.  there was still a nice orange flavor in the cookies.   I thought I read one review that said these are like muffin tops; they kind of are--they didn't spread at all and just remained round from my cookie scoop.  I baked each batch for about 14 minutes and they didn't brown but were baked through.  I liked them, but I also like the idea of using applesauce to make them healthier, and adding fruit to it.  Cranberries would be lovely in these, so I may try that next time.  I also would like more cereal to have a bit more chewy texture.  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked the fiber content, portability, and fun factor of this recipe when I decided to give it a try.  Unfortunately, Iâ€™m not a huge fan of orange juice, and these are VERY orange-y tasting.  What I am thinking is that after I manage to eat the rest of this batch, I will try it again with lemonade concentrate and some lemon zest.  Personal preference.  This is a great idea and makes for pretty filling little cookies, thanks for sharing!

Wow! These are really good! I took some advice from other reviews and substituted apple sauce for butter, and whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour. Also instead of grape-nut cereal (I did not have any on hand) i used granola. They were great! When I tasted the batter, they were not that good, so I was pleasantly surprised when they came out of the oven tasting great!

We really enjoyed these and they came together pretty quickly.  I purposely bought an orange for these but 1 orange was NOT a tablespoon of zest.  I thought I had frozen concentrate but did not so I used 2 tblspn of Sunny D instead!

ok, I'm gonna give these another try. I just read all the other reveiws and no one mentions any problems, mine were so lumpy, they took about 14 minutes to bake and came out very pale. I will definitely increase the grapenuts and use some whole wheat flour, also subbing applesauce for the butter as another reviewer recommends. Back to the kitchen...

These were too cake like for me.  They had a good flavor but I more than doubled the amount of orange juice in it and iced it with a white chocolate and orange peel mix.  Next time I will decrease to flour and increase the Grape Nuts.  My kids did love them and they usually get tired of things after a day or two.  Not this time.

Cookies are cooling as I'm writing this...easy and flavorful. Added cranberries, pecans, and swapped the butter for applesauce and coconut oil. Thanks for sharing, Susan!

I alter this a lot. I use fresh squeezed orange juice with some added brown sugar to sub for frozen mix. I use oatmeal for the cereal, add nuts (pecans or walnuts) sometimes dried cranberries too. They never stay in the house long!

Well, these are like flat muffins instead of cookies for me! Recipe says it makes about a dozen and a half cookies, I made 7! Intensionally though... Needed something that will take place of a breakfast, I can't eat two little cookies. Made these with applesauce and a different cereal that I had to crush up a bit, added twice the amount of cereal. Had a taste test from one, and I think they are going to be a good quick bfast with my coffee.

I liked these but there were too many textures for my family. I will make them from time to time but not weekly.

What a great use for grape nuts...don't know too many people who like this as a cereal.  Made these for an office breakfast and there were gone in no time.  Great alternative to a granola bar for breakfast.  This is a keeper!
