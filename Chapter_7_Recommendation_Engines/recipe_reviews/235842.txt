I thought this was a different type of recipe to try for roasted vegetables. I have never roasted tomatoes in an oven for a long period of time and may do that again for another salad. When I went to make it I then realized the tomatoes needed to roast for a full 2.5 hours. I planned to make this at lunch time and decided to put them under the broiler on low, on a foil lined sheet sprayed with some PAM. It took 45 minutes, instead, with the rack placed in the middle of the oven. They still got a nice slow roast. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly just reducing the green onion some and subbing red wine vinegar, because my grocer did not carry the sherry vinegar. That seemed to work fine. Personally, I know this recipe is all about the avocados presenting, but I kind of liked it all stirred up. I thought the other vegetables picked up some of the flavors from the tomatoes which I really liked. That is how I served it after taking the photo. This does take a little time to prepare with 3 separate components, but I like the mix of 3 vegetables anyhow in the dish. ty

My husband and I LOVED this recipe! I did use fresh thyme, because I had some in my herb garden that survived the winter here in Georgia. This salad was light, fresh and tasty. The perfect bite was when I had a bit of everything on my fork - asparagus, tomato, avocado and scallion. DELICIOUS! I will be making this one over and over again! Thanks Avocados from Mexico for the great recipe!

This was delicious, just...really satisfying. I literally ate huge platefuls of this, a meal in itself. I couldn't find sherry vinegar, so I went with rice vinegar instead. While that was good, it was a bit bland (possibly bc I chose a poor substitute!), I've made better oil/vinegar dressings before. So I only used it once and then switched to a more flavorful vinaigrette.

Very good- left out the thyme and subbed white balsamic for the sherry vinegar.  Nice flavors!  Love a perfectly ripe avocado!

Delicious salad.  I wanted the tomatoes to have a firmer texture to offset the avocado so didn't cook as long.  I used 4 tablespoons of olive oil, and substituted thinly sliced shallots for the green onions, rice wine vinegar for sherry vinegar, and added a generous squeeze of fresh grapefruit juice to brighten it up.

Big hit at my house!  I followed the recipe closely, except that 2-1/2 hours was too long to roast the tomatoes.  I took them out after 2 hours and they were way more done than the picture.  However, they were really delicious and complemented the other ingredients so not a problem.  The only negative was the dressing.  Completely bland. I ended up just using a bottled vinaigrette and it was fine. My husband asked me to put this into the summer menu rotation.

I didn't make it exactly.  I actually make it different every time.   I usually use some sort of mix of cherry tomato, a whole avocado, mushrooms and asparagus.  I either roast or microwave the asparagus in olive oil first til almost done, then add the mushroom, just to soften it and finish cooking the asparagus.  Let it cool.  Lots of times I end up eating frozen dinners, which always include frozen corn.  So I let that cook about halfway, so it doesn't get mushy.  I let the corn cool and I add that too.  Then I add the tomato and avocado.  Toss.  If I have it, I add some feta along with the feta "juice" for dressing.  If I don't have feta I just use lime juice, salt and pepper, toss and voila'!   Quick, simple, fresh.
