This recipe was pretty good; however, I have had better. If I was to make it again, which I probably will, I would mix more chocolate with the first layer, and leave less to be drizzled on top. Also, to add just two teaspoons salt would definetly improve the taste and bring up the rating. The toffee was the pie's saving grace. I would encourage you to try it for yourself!

Not my most favorite chocolate pie ever but was easy to make and worth keeping around to make again if I need something fast and easy.

This was super simple. I made my own oreo crust with double-chocolate faux-reos, melted butter and sugar and baked it for about 8 minutes at 375*. My husband isn't big on toffee, so I crushed up some more faux-reos and sprinkled those on top. I'll update my review once he's had a chance to taste it.

My family LOVED this recipe! The only thing that I didnt liek was that it kind of overflowed in the pie crust so I will not add all of the pudding next time. I have made this 3x's this week! I made it for my husbands potluck at work, for my family and for my inlaws! we really do like it!

Pretty good but you can’t top with cool whip unless you plan to freeze the pie as it is too runny. That said, It’s quite good frozen.

This chocolate pie is ridiculously easy to make and takes no time at all! Made it for Thanksgiving and it was the only pie everyone tried and there was none left. It is rich and creamy, and a big hit with adults and kids.  Will be making it again at Christmas. 

Like others have said, I will make a few modifications when making it again - definitely more chocolate on the bottom layer + more toffee in the pudding layer, may try a graham cracker crust instead,  and I will keep this in the freezer before serving to 'firm up' a bit more.
