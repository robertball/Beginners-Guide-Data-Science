This dish was phenomenal!!! I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great. It would even be great over rice. This recipe deserves all 5 stars. I'm annoyed by reading reviews that alter a recipe and then knock down the rating because of the changes. Thanks for sharing this fabulous dish!

Great recipe! I can tell it was highly inspired from the Tikka Masala recipe on this site (even tasted mostly the same), but improved upon. I only used one serrano pepper, since I'm pretty spice sensitive, and I think that worked out perfectly. I also doubled the yougart sauce- I've learned when in doubt, double the sauce! Be sure to tin-foil your baking sheet to save on the clean up! I used non fat greek yougart - I think it not being as watery as regular helped the cooking time, as I only had mine in the oven for 40 minutes before it was done and all the sauce was thickened and clinging to the tofu chunks nicely. 
I took a tip from another reviewer and used 2% evaporated milk instead of half and half to cut down on the fat (1 12oz can). If you don't like your cauliflower to crunch and would really like the flavors to get into it, take your time in softening it. I kept adding water to the tomato sauce as they cooked together to give it plenty of time to soften up and soak in the flavors. Better to simmer it as much as you can BEFORE you add the cream/half and half/ect. 

Served with a little jasmine basmati with more cilantro for garnish. I don't think the flavor is quite enough to be able to mix in much rice, next time I'll serve with naan bread instead! Very filling!

My family likes spicy food however, I tested the first serrano I cut open and decided to use just one (instead of 3).  It was the perfect amount of heat---any more and it would have overpowered the rest of the spices.  The word that kept coming to mind when eating this was "depth" of flavor.  Whole family loved it.  Served over jasmine rice.  The 4 of us polished it off. Btw, I subbed skim evap. milk for the half & half and didn't feel it needed all 2 cups.  Probably only used a cup.  Will do the same again.

Very good!  It's surprisingly spicy, considering how little hot stuff is in it, but that's just the way I like it!

I made this recipe without peas (because I hate peas!) and with 1 serrano instead of 3. I also reduced the bake time on the tofu to 30 minutes, stirring the tofu after 15 minutes. I only did this because the tofu got really dry and stuck to the baking sheet. In fact, next time I make this I will have to consider really slathering the baking sheet with grease. I used a non stick sheet AND greased the sheet and still the tofu stuck terribly. 

My partner and I loved the results though. We'll be making it again!

I am lactose intolerant and sour cream is a serious no - no for me, and I am able to get lactaid milk rather, I do it my way. Without sour cream, but with 2% Lactaid milk.  All else I keep somewhat thee same. Great recipe, great dish! Only reason it did not get five, was the changes I make.

This was a great dish.  We are vegan so I substituted the yogurt for vegan sour cream mixed with a little soy  milk.  That worked wonderfully.  Using soy milk in place of the half and half did not work as well, the milk curdled.  The tofu was a bit too spicy for my kids and next time I will probably cut the amount of spices in half.  Overall, a great recipe.

This was delicious. The only thing I changed was that after reading the reviews I decided to start with one pepper which ended up being perfect for our tastes. I also left out the garlic due to a food insensitivity. I loved this and am looking forward to making it again.

Fantastic!  I felt like I was at an Indian restaurant.  I did not have all of the spices, so I did without the coriander and cilantro.  This is a spicy recipe, so if you like things mild, you should probably cut out the cayenne completely and maybe reduce the serrano.  I served with homemade naan from this site and got rave reviews from my friends.  Also, as you may have guessed, this makes way more than 4 servings for the average person.

So very good.
I used fat free greek yogurt and fat free half & half instead to make it a bit more healthy. (Don't like peas and didn't have tomato sauce - so left out these ingredients making it more yellow curry and less Masala perhaps) The tofu was the best I have ever made it really tasted like the cheese you find in many Indian dishes.  Though I adjusted it a bit - loved this recipe. (My husband asked me to please make it again - it was a big hit)  Next time I might add some onions as well.  We like spicy so this recipe was perfect for us.

I love, love, loved this dish.  I served it to my brother who hates Indian food, and even he liked it. The only changes I made: omitted coriander because I hate coriander, subbed jalapeno for serranos. I used non fat Greek yogurt for the tofu mixture.  I did find the tofu stuck to the pan when baked.  I will grease the pan more next time... and there will definitely be a next time.

Wonderful recipe! We cut down just a little on spices, because, although we like spicy foods, the food gets lost on hot spicy. With the small changes we made, this was absolutely wonderful dish.

Restaurant quality. I didn't have fresh peppers, so I sauteed an entire diced onion instead and then added diced pickled jalapenos (equivalent to one whole) along with the tomato sauce and cauliflower. I also omitted peas. Use the biggest pan you have. This makes a lot. Went well with basmati rice.

We really liked this.  I followed the directions exactly, and we served it over rice.  Word of warning, this has a decent amount of heat in it, if you're not a person who likes spicy (we LOVE spicy), cut back on the cayenne and the peppers.

I have never written a review before - but this was amazing.  I love that it is versatile - based on reviews I knew I could adapt according to my children's tastes; it is forgiving; it is healthy; it is delicious; it is meat-free.  My 15 yod said this was the best thing she has ever eaten - and that it is birthday dinner worthy. Thank you for the recipe - it was outstanding.

I used coconut cream and yogurt instead of half and half, and plain crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and it was perfect.

We loved this and all leftovers were eaten.  When I make this again I will cut the tofu into slightly larger pieces.  I used only one pepper to keep the dish more mild.  I omitted the peas for dietary reasons.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  Delicious!

This was a really good recipe! I like a moderate amount of heat and three Serranos was perfect. While cooking the tofu, I did have to turn down the oven temperature as it was starting to blacken after the first fifteen minutes. After the final step, I added some white pepper which I thought completed the flavor.

Wonderful!!! A couple tweaks.....made a double batch of the yogurt sauce as someone suggested. Only used 1/4 t of cayenne for the double batch and it was perfect. Used parchment on my baking sheet sprayed with olive oil and there was no sticking to the pan.  I used all of the sauce on the tofu so I felt it needed an extra 15 minutes of baking time for the sauce to be dry. I skipped the peppers and added 1 T jalapeno with seeds. Plenty hot for us Minnesotans! For the cauliflower, I used a 2# bag from Costco of Cauliflower Florets.  If you can't find Garam Masala, there is a great recipe on this site from KitchenBarbarian that was perfect!

I did not add any additional cumin or masala to the skillet, because I thought the sauce in the oven was spicy enough! I also added 6oz tomato paste to the skillet. It was good, but spicy for our palates. My husband would like me to make it again, but the kids would rather I didn't.

I've made this twice. Once as posted and a second time as a vegan dish with cashew yogurt and a plant based cream substitute. It is very spicy, I only used 3 peppers the second time.

Wow, good receipe. Just watch out on the sourness in yogurt and add accordingly. The yogurt was very sour and it came out  very sour for me. Sure to recommend for friends and family.

This recipe is amazing, and I will definitely be making it again. I noticed a lot of reviewers saying they only used one Serrano pepper, but I really like heat so I used al l3 and did not remove the seeds. For me this was a good level of spice, I might even increase to 4 peppers next time. I was not trying to change the recipe but I ran out of cumin, and  barely had enough for the yogurt mix. I increased the coriander and garam masala a bit for the sauce. This worked pretty well but I look forward to trying it as the recipe says next time.

I have decided that whoever discovered baking tofu is a genius.  The variety of textures created by the cauliflower, tofu, and peas was wonderful.  The sauce was thick and creamy with great dept of  flavor.  I found I only need to bake tofu for 45mins to get it nice and chewy with crispy edges.  I've also found that a spritz of cooking spray before and after  each turning greatly reduces it's "stick" factor and helps with the crispy edges. I used a fat free half and half so I added a couple tablespoons of tomato paste to help with thickness and reinforce the tomato flavor.

Good recipe. I didn't have any Garam masala so I used curry and onion powder which tasted great. I also used two pablano peppers in place of the three serano peppers. The dish strayed toward medium-mild and it probably could have used a little more heat. I didn't have any cilantro so I skipped that too; still tasted good, but it would have been a nice addition, giving an addition layer to the flavors. I served the dish over brown rice. My husband ate it up and said he'd have it again. First time he's ever enjoyed tofu; although, he mentioned chicken might taste better. I'll definitely add this recipe to my repertoire.

I made this but did alter the recipe to make it healthier. I used non fat Greek yogurt for the yogurt, only 1 cup of 1% milk and avacado oil instead of butter. Otherwise followed the recipe pretty spot on and it was a hit!

This is by far my favorite recipe from all recipes, and I use all recipes a lot. I always make a few adjustments. 1) as suggested by others, instead of the half and half, I use the evaporated milk and only use one can. 2) I just about double the GARAM masala, cumin, and cayenne. It's important to note that when making masalas, it's all

This was very tasty but I like a bit more texture. I added chick peas and served this with Naan.

Easily one of the best things I've ever made at home. I will say - I forgot the paprika in the tofu marinade, and I don't miss it.

One thing though - next time I will pull the tofu out at 30 mins instead of 45.

Last note: fresh roasted and ground spices for the win. I could see this coming out quite bland with stale supermarket shaker junk.

I have three kids that can be finicky about vegetables and avoid tofu like the plague.  I made the dish while they were away and was mum on the ingredients until after they were halfway through their plates.  All three enjoyed it.  I toned down the heat by leaving out the Serrano peppers and subbing in finely cut bell peppers.  I was very happy with the dish and will be adding it to the rotation.

excellent flavor, need to press the tofu better next time I make this recipe, it stuck to the greased baking sheet think that was due to the moisture still present.

Holy cow, this was good. I followed it exactly except for the spice factor, which is a personal thing. I did one serrano pepper and no cayenne and it was plenty spicy for me. Oh, and I used one cup half-and-half. It was delicious! Incredibly flavorful. This is the best recipe I've made on here in a long time. I served it with maybe a half cup of jasmine rice each.

At 45 minutes, it was tough and too chewy. I must assume that this is an attempt to make more "meat-like." Next time, I might just sautée it for 10 minutes. Otherwise, the dish had tremendous flavor, but there is a lot of prep (-1 star). Consider mincing your ginger, garlic and serranos in advance.

Amazing as is on recipe . Took about 1.5 hours to prep because I didn't cook the tofu in parallel with the sauce.

This was absolutely delish!  As someone else suggested, I used only 1 serrano pepper, as I don't like much heat.  Also, we served it on top of couscous.  My boys had theirs on top of baked chicken.  Everyone loved it!!

Absolutely perfect. My boyfriend and I are not tofu eaters, and I have been looking for good recipes that use tofu. This one is fab! Definitely accessible for those who are on the fence about tofu. This dish is creamy and oh so tasty. Make this!! It is incredible!!!

When I told my husband I was making this he brought home pizza as a "back up".  We both LOVED this recipe. The spices blend perfectly together. The only changes I made is I doubled the tomato sauce and spices for the last sauce.  I didn't really  like the hardness of the tofu so next time I will bake it for half the time.  I served it over rice.

This was my first attempt at an Indian recipe and it turned out great! Pretty easy too. Based on other reviews I didn't add all the peppers but next time I will, I tend to like a bit more kick in my Indian dishes. I will definitely make it again. Serves more than 4 but I also served it with basmati rice.

This was great! If you like spicy food, use the three serranos.  I was cautious with two and wished it was a tad spicier.  I also didn't use the full two cups of half and half and it had plenty of sauce.  The sauce is so good I wanted to lick my plate.

Like others, I used a cup of milk instead of the half and half, and it was a perfect consistency.  I also omitted the garam masala and only used one pepper, and it was still spicy and delicious.

This wasn't a BAD dish, but I expected more flavor. With all the cumin, corriander, ginger, and marsala I was dissapointed with the blandness. I did enjoy the texture of the tufo, baking it prior t adding it I believe is a great idea. Also, it was kinda ugly, with the tofu and cauliflower being white the sauce turns everything kinda reddish brown.

This is a very good dish. I used only 2 serranos and it was plenty hot for us. We can't eat large quantities of rich dairy. I used skim milk and added a few tablespoons of Nestle Media Crema (shelf stable cream). Thanks for sharing this recipe we enjoyed eating this!
