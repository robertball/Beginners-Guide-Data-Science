These taste just like expensive macadamia nut cookies. Love the crunch too. Very easy recipe. Next time I will chop the white chocolate chunks bigger or use bagged white chips. The oven time was right on.

This is a nice, crisp cookie. Made exactly as listed though I doubled the recipe! Will definitely make again.

Delicious cookies! I made half a batch, but I like a smaller cookie. So glad I did! I got 24 cookies out of a half batch, and they are just the right size. I dropped them with a teaspoon. I used 1 whole egg, even though the recipe said 1/2. I used butterscotch chips and white chips because I wanted to use up the last little bits in each bag. 12 minutes in a preheated oven and they were done perfectly. Thank you!

Increased the cinnamon by half.  Sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of the hot cookies as they came out of the oven. Yummy!

I used a full cup of butter instead of half shortening/butter. These were terrific! The cinnamon is not too powerful; it gives character to the buttery flavor of this delicious chewy not-too-crispy cookie. White chocolate chips pervade and burst with rich sweetness - an excellent recipe overall.

Alterations: Use less cinnamon 2 sticks of butter/1 cup These tasted great but the aftertaste of cinnamon was a little overwhelming for me. They shaped well and I left them in the fridge for about 20 minutes.

Delicious! I don't really like white chocolate but had some chips on hand that I wanted to use up. This recipe was perfect.  I did increase the cinnamon because I love cinnamon,  and sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar.  My house smelled so good while they were baking.
