This recipe is fabulous!  I cooked it in foil in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes and threw in slices of red pepper too, which were amazing with the sauce.  I will make this again and again!

I loved this, and I am very picky about salmon recipes.  Like other reviewers, I thought the flavors would overpower the salmon, but the marinade really wasn't too strong at all!  I  used a 1 lb. salmon filet cut into 2" chunks but kept the other quantities the same, wrapped in foil and baked in the oven for about a half hour.  The only thing I would do differently next time is use lite soy sauce (personal preference) and if baking like I did this time I would open the foil for the last 5 minutes to let the sauce carmelize a bit.   Will definitely try this with a whole salmon some day as the recipe states!

Living in the Pacific NW, I don't like to add anything too fancy to salmon....my husband was worried that this dish would cover up the flavor of the salmon..and amazingly it enhanced the flavor of the salmon. This is a regular salmon dish in our family now...don't hesitate to try it if you love the real salmon flavor...this did NOT cover it up

I can't wait to try this on whole salmon on the grill because it was absolutely delicious on filets done in the oven.  I spooned the marinade on the filets about an hour before putting them in and wrapped them in foil while they waited.  I used a hot oven for 20 minutes.  About 450 degrees.  Probably a lower temp would have worked just as well.  I have a side of salmon that I'm going to try it on next, tomorrow in fact, outdoors on the grill.  Thanks!

We love this recipe and this is one of the easiest salmon recipe anyone can make.  I made it twice already.  The first time, I followed the recipe as it was written.  We were very impressed.  Though after reading most of the reviews, many reviewers were wondering if the fish can be marinated more than 30 minutes.  I, personally do not agree marinating more that 30 minutes.  I want to taste my fish, and have the marinade compliment the fish, not the other way around.  So the second time I made this recipe, I decided to make my marinade a day early.  I combined ALL the ingredient (except for the fish) in a container, added a small drop of sesame oil, and about 15 cilantro leaves.  The next day, I poured the marinade on the fish, marinate it for 30 minutes and baked it.  Sprinkled it fresh scallions and cilantro.  The dish is so delicious.  All the ingredients complimented each other.  Although, when i serve this dish to a group of people, I think I will strain the marinade before pouring it to the fish.  The presentation will be better if my guest do not see the chucks of garlic, ginger and wilted scallions and cilantro.  Can't wait to make this again.  YUM!

Another 5 star salmon recipe for us.  My husband another couple that I had over for dinner tonight were all in agreement.  I forgot to put the lime juice in and did not have any fresh ginger (so used 1 tsp. ground) and did not have any green onions....even with all this..it was absolutely fabulous.  Thank you for an excellent recipe.

I needed a little something to spice up the usual bland fish dinner at my household. When i found the chile garlic bbq salmon recipe on my favourite website in the world, I thought, lets give it a shot. My kids who dont normally like fish asked for seconds and my wife thinks ive been going to chef school when shes at work. Only we know my secret.

When I first read this recipe I saw the words BBQ and then looked at the ingredients and thought it sounded like a nice combination. What I didn't realize when I went to make it was the complete foil wrapping. Seems to me that if you're going to completely wrap something in foil, then why cook it on the grill? Probably the reason the majority of the reviews made this in the oven. We didn't , we marinaded in the chili sauce a 3.5 pound salmon for about an hour, I had to double the marinade, but left only 1 tablespoon of grated fresh ginger. I didn't have a fresh lime so just used a tablespoon of lime juice, no zest. And a few more garlic cloves. We grilled our fillets right on the grill with out any foil, then basted them in the marinade that I quickly cooked on the stove-top with a teaspoon of cornstarch. This was one of the best marinades I've ever tried on salmon and we have tried just about every recipe on this site. My chili sauce is from World market and might be part of the reason such a good flavor. Was just the right amount of spice and sweet combination, and yet let the full flavor of the fresh salmon come through. The fish was so moist tender and flaky. My husband thanks you...I thank you for we would've never thought of this marinade without your recipe. If you're grilling, no need for the foil.

This is good! I added a little soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, a shake of sesame oil, olive oil and used it as a marinade. I served it with a cucumber salad on top, yum, yum!

wowie-kazowie this is delicious.  had to update my review as i have become accustomed to making it w/o the lime or green onion.  otherwise, i always double the remaining ingredients but add a wee bit more sugar (splenda brown sugar), a glug of olive oil and dollop of water. i'll use half for a marinade and the other half, please try this, i use for sauteed zucchini. i usually let the salmon marinate while i cook my jasmine rice (takes about 50mins so its a perfect timer) but try this as a cooking sauce for zucchini. start your saute with olive oil and minced garlic. add your zucchs and cook until al dente then add the chile garlic sauce to coat right at the end. O!M!G! is this delicious!!  served with jasmine rice.  a totally easy, superb, impressive meal.  can't wait to eat left overs for lunch. it is just so delicious, we love this meal.  -------------- because i was without, i used no lime, no green onion, no fresh ginger. i did use 1 heaping tspn powdered ginger. and a heaping tbspn of sambal chile sauce due to my preference for POW! flavor.  i also added a dollop of olive oil and water then marinaded the salmon for about 90 mins.  yummy,incredible, delish, moist flavor. hubs said it was superb. will definitely make again.

Like someone else said we baked in the oven 425 for 20min pocketed in foil with juice and a roasted red pepper on top. It was a little wetter then we preferred so we pan seared it. As for the sauce we made this with Saracha (aka Rooster Sauce) instead of chili sauce. I only did about half of the soy sauce (light) and completely forgot about the sugar which was actually better since we paired it with Grilled Vegetable Potato skins where were SUPER SWEET (side note on that recipe i used Greek instead of Italian).. It was an amazing meal

This was outstanding!  I added red pepper flakes for a little spice and it tasted great.  Next time I will marinate it a little bit longer.

This was absolutely fantastic! I'm a healthnut, but the recipe is pretty light as-is, I used Spelnda brown sugar and a touch less of it and marinated the salmon in it for 3mins prior, but otherwise left the recipe alone. I put it in the oven at 425 for 20mins covered and then 5mins uncovered and it was light, flakey, and perfect! This is also great for mixed families where some like more sauce than others, I was able to give my better-half a bit extra to use on his potatoes and keep mine a little lighter. Fantastic! A keeper for everday and to impress guests with for sure!

I used Sriracha garlic chile paste and man, that stuff packs some heat!  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  (Well, I baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.)  Served this over baby mixed greens and chopped veggies for a healthy dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe, Jayda.

This was fabulous! We didn't change anything in the recipe and it turned out fantastic. (Well, we did double the recipe but that was it.) We made it for a going-away party this past Friday and it was one of the first dishes to disappear. It's definitely a keeper. It's simple, quick and delicious. What more could you ask for? We may try making it with gluten-free soy sauce next time for the sake of our friends who have Celiac but that would be the only modification. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

I'm Not a fish person, but we were having company that Loves salmon, so I decided to brave it. This turned out very nice and got Rave reviews...and even my son and I found it pretty tasty. :) I mixed the ingredients together in a bag and let the fish marinade for about 30 minutes before Hubby put it on the grill. Served it with fettuccine n asparagus in a lemon cream sauce, green salad and watermelon. It was a Big hit! :)

This recipes is awesome as is so I'm giving it four stars. I served it on a bed of sautéed spinach and a side of Asian rice which I used the leftover glaze to make.  I did however think the chili sauce was a little overpowered by the soy sauce and sugar, so the second time I made it I doubled the amount of chili sauce and cut the soy and sugar amount in half and it was even better. This may depend on the type of Chili sauce you buy, mine was pretty sweet on its own so it didn't really need that much sugar.   Also, if anyone is like me and finds ginger root to be a pain to chop, grating it on the small side of a cheese grater works wonders!

Like many of earlier reviews, I am pretty picky about what I do to salmon.  But looking for something a little different and loving garlic, this was wonderful on a two pound filet!  I didn't have chili sauce, so substituted seafood cocktail sauce.  Our fussiest eater insists on tartar sauce for anything that looks like fish and he didn't even think about it.
I like this idea of adding cilantro to the mix, but this is awfully darned good as it is!
Thanks for sharing this, Jayda!

This was so yummy! I added quite a bit more Sriracha and used ginger root powder, because of my forgetfulness to buy fresh, but this was amazing!

I made this the other night for dinner and it was fantastic!  My wife who normally complains about food being too spicy also loved it.  Not at all too spicy for her.  I did not use the ginger root or the green onions.  Besides that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I think I cooked the salmon too long, turned out a little bit dry.  There didn't seem to be enough sauce even though I used a little bit less than 2 pounds of salmon, and the full amount of sauce (recipe calls for 3 pounds of salmon.)  Not very spicy, but good. I liked it.

We, too, are pretty picky about how our salmon is prepared.  I thought I would try this since the reviews were so favorable.  Made it exactly as the recipe except for the fresh ginger root as I did not have any.  I used powdered ginger instead. Even with that change my husband announced that this recipe is a 'keeper'.  Delicious!!

Pretty good!!! Made this for dinner last night. Prep couldn't be any easier! I like the fact that the marinade is made with ingredients I usually have on had (with the exception of chile sauce - I had to buy Sriracha since I didn't have it readily available). Instead of purchasing a whole 1.5 lb. salmon (I halved the recipe for my bf and I), I purchased two large filets which were about .5 lb. each. I made exactly half the marinade (i.e. enough for 3 servings / 1.5 lbs. fish). I added the white portions of my green onions to the marinade, but saved the green parts for garnish as directed. Instead of grilling, I sealed each filet in a double thickness of aluminum foil and baked, closed for 20 minutes and then slightly opened for an additional 5 minutes. Served atop porcini mushroom risotto with a side of sweet potatoes and fresh cracked wheat french baugette purchased at my Italian bakery. While I liked this (and it's healthy to boot!), I didn't think it was flavorful enough to make again. Perhaps marinating for longer than 30 minutes (as I did) would do the trick??? I think this could use a little kick as well... red pepper flakes or a very spicy chile sauce (and more of it) perhaps??? Thanks for sharing :)

I didn't have scallions, but it turned out great regardless. I baked mine in foil as well. I lined the foil with a bed of sliced onions(strips), red pepper, and celery. Instead of brown sugar, i used brown sugar splenda, and I served the salmon with steamed broccoli (with lemon pepper seasoning) for a complete low-carb meal.

This has to be terrific just from the ingredients!  My only comment is that it is unwise to use foil with any recipe that is acidic.  The aluminum leeches into the sauce and food via chemical reaction.  So I'll certainly try this but done in a wok or dutch oven on the stove.  Thanks.

Very tasty baked fish. I baked in the oven and used a whole salmon with slice marks going through the top of it. I thought it would be a bit strong, but the flavor really mellowed and was great. Used the leftover salmon for sandwiches the next day and my husband said they were the best ever.

My husband loved this!  Used ginger spice, and lime juice, and omitted the onions as garnish, and cooked in the oven at 425, but it was still awesome!  Will definitely add to my salmon repertoire!

Great recipe!  I let the salmon sit for about 30 minutes while I was preparing other food, then wrapped it and sent hubby out to BBQ it.  I also didn't have green onions on hand, and didnt replace them with an alternative.  Everyone loved it, including my picky eater.
It made me want to make salmon more often, and I definitely will!

absolutely delicious...and I am not a Salmon fan. Doesn't need any tweeking save for the fact that I prefer to use low sodium soy sauce, actually it's all I had and the fish did not require any additional salt.

This salmon recipe is amazing. I didn't have access to a grill so instead I placed the foil-wrapped salmon in the oven at 450 degrees for about 25 minutes. It came out perfect! I served the salmon along with the sauce on a big platter so everyone could spoon a little of it on their rice.

OMG - This was absolutely fabulous. Used a 1 lb fillet, marinated in the sauce (made the entire batch) for 1 hour, then baked sealed in foil at 425 for 15 mins, opened for 5 mins and yum, yum, yum. Served it over basmati rice and sauted fresh spinach. Great flavor that still lets the salmon stand out. I will make with the full three pounds on the grill but will triple the sauce. This is now one of our favorites. Thanks for a really great recipe. Oh, and I used honey instead of brown sugar.

Delicious! I wavered between 4 and 5 stars before deciding grilling would make this a 5-star dish. I baked it to stay warm in February. :)  I tweaked it a but because I always use extra garlic. To suit our love of sweet with a kick, I'll use 1.5T of brown sugar, use a bit of sesame oil and add red pepper flakes next time.  Will probably marinate for an hour and squeeze a bit of lime juiceover just before cooking.

Awesome recipe.  Cooked on the grill as instructed and it turned out perfect.  Friends proclaimed it the best they had EVER had.  Next time I will marinate the salmon a copule of hours before cooking.  Served with Pad Tai Vegetables for a near perfect meal.

Fabulous! I drizzled a bit extra brown sugar over the top but followed the rest of the recipe to a tee! I loved the kick of the chili sauce! (I used Tabasco) It was a wonderful change from our usual lemon and dill salmon. I will make this again, even my hubby liked it and he's not huge into salmon! Thanks!

Quite good, but i think that the sauce amount needs to be doubled. After cooking for a while on the grill, there really is not much left of it, and its so good! So, besides needing more of the sauce, this recipe has made me decide that salmon is actually quite good.

This was a great way and easy way to make salmon.  I followed the suggested directions for cooking it in an oven, but it needed another 10 minutes past the suggested 20 at 425. After 20 minutes, I opened up the foil and let it bake for another 10 minutes to complete cooking.  Maybe next time I will cut it into individual serving pieces and it will be done in 20.

Soooo good. I didn't marinate it like some suggested, but I will next time. I wraped individual fillets in foil and made them that way. I saved the dripping and marinade from each pouch to use as a dipping sauce. Mmmmm I am hungry just thikning about it.

Delish.  I added more garlic though because you can never have too much garlic.  I also added green onions before cooking rather than after.

This is a great change from the typical "Asian" marinade. I love the spicy kick...marinate overnight for more flavor!

This was delicious and the best salmon recipe I have seen in a long time. I used fillets instead of whole salmon. I will definitely be making this one again and adding it to my list of favorites!  Next time I will make additional sauce, it is so good!

Wow,just fabulous. You might think that the chili and garlic would over-power the salmon but it's wonderfully balanced. My new favorite way to prepare salmon.  Sure to become a family classic for generations.

Went looking for a salmon recipe that was different than our usual spice blends. This became a quick (and super easy!) favorite. I baked it in the oven in a glass dish covered in foil. Used the temp and time suggested by another reviewer. 425* for 20 mins. I threw the green onions in to bake so the flavors blended. Loved it. Served with rice and sautéed veggies. If you like salmon, this is the recipe for you. Will try grilled next time since it's just as easy!

Added a brown sugar meet rub instead of just brown sugar and loved the flavor. Also added fresh chopped cilantro to taste.  Will add to my recipe box!

did this in the oven (330 for 25 min) and left out the lime and onions (availability). It was good, but not great. Could have also been my cut of salmon (wild keta), so will try again.

It was very good.  I used salmon fillets cut to serving size (approx 1/2 lb./serving) and shortened cook time to 16 - 18 minutes.  Great flavor.  I thought using chili sauce was good for zest.  My thoughts are to add small red and green Asian peppers or crushed red pepper flakes for a fun spicy kick.  As is, yummy.

I cooked this salmon using a single piece of cedar about 12 inches by 20 inches after soaking it in water for a couple hours.  I cut the filet into 4 to 5 inch pieces and laid them directly onto the cedar.  They came out superb! My husband does'nt even like fish but he had 3 servings.

Not sure why this has received 4-1/2 stars. I made this recipe based on the ratings and will not make it again. This was terrible and made my salmon turn a funny old shade of white / pink. I wasted a beautiful piece of salmon on this recipe!

This was fantastic!  I used all of the ingredients called for, I just used frozen salmon fillets instead of a whole salmon.  I also only used a pound of salmon instead of three, so I adjusted the amounts accordingly.  I live in a small town and cannot ever find chile paste, so I used chile powder instead.  These were delicious!!

This was delicious I had sides of spring salad with a vinigarette dressing and oven fries to round out the meal it is a definite keeper.  Also prior to cooking the salmon on another occasion, I used the marinade recipe for shrimp on the BBQ they were also a big hit.

This was really good. And easy to boot! I used 1 t ground ginger, as I didn't have fresh, and I used bottled lime juice in place of the fresh juice and zest. Next time I might throw a few green onions in with the foil. We had the grill on high and used the rack. There wasn't much sauce left to serve on top. Might try it differently next time to try to have more sauce.

Delicious! Followed this exactly the first time and could've used more of the delicious sauce for our rice so the next time I doubled the ingredients for the sauce and still used around 3 lbs of salmon. I baked it in foil packets in the oven and had sauce to spoon over homemade fried rice, YUM!!

Really 4.5 stars...Halved the recipe because we had only 1.5 lbs of salmon.  Also used lemon because I didn't have a lime.  Next time, I plan to have a lime on hand to see what the difference is...Baked this in the oven at 450 (foil wrapped) for 15 minutes.  Opened the foil for another 5 minutes.

whether you're using a whole salmon or just steaks this recipe rocks. i did take some liberties and melded together the bbq elements together with another recipe (Buzzsaw's BBQ - also found on allrecipes) and it was excellent. served with cucumber salad and asparagus. i will definitely make this again!

Made this exactly as described. Very good, however my wife and I found it a bit salty. Next time I will use lite soy and juice from half a lime. Citrus to heat balance was just about perfect so a little less lime should be perfect.I threw in a dash of hot chipotle sauce too for a hint of smoke.

This recipe was outstanding!  Had some issues with the BBQ running out of gas half way through, so I had to put it in the oven and topped it off with the broiler for five minutes.  Turned out great.  I cut the recipe down to a serving size of three.  Probably should have made the marinade for four servings.  Overall it was great definitely making this again!  Ginger is great flavor!

My family loved this recipe!  I used 1 tsp powdered ginger instead of fresh.  I also placed the fish on top of sliced red peppers and baked it in foil in a 425 degree oven for 20 minutes.  Opened the packet up for another 5.  Served it with rice pilaf and sliced tomatoes and cucumbers.

I'm not a giant salmon fan- too fishy for me. But I live in the NW and good salmon is readily available.  This was a great recipe to add other flavors besides "fishy", and complemented the salmon nicely.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe as stated and grilled the salmon on a gas grill.  The salmon came out great.  The flavor was very good.  My boyfriend said he would have liked it a little spicier so next time I will add some chile flakes to the ingredients and see how it turns out.

This is a wonderful salmon recipe! The only thing that I would change is to decrease the hot chili sauce from 1 tbsp to 11/2 tsp as I found it too hot (go with your taste).  I really enjoyed it cold the next day flaked in a salad.  Awesome recipe, Jayda. Thanks!

I was too lazy to do the lime zest so I found a premade chile and lime marinade.  This got an all around thumbs up in my household.

I love this marinade. Simple and delicious! Great with salmon and I also use to to stir fry veggies. I have also boiled the leftover marinade down and used it to dip my salmon! Great combo!

I give this 4 stars, but my husband would probably say 5.  He doesn't even like salmon all that much and asked for seconds, calling the meal great.  I thought it had maybe a bit too much lime flavor, so I might cut down on the zest next time, but it did give the dish a nice, fresh taste.

Fantastic recipe! I'm not an expert at all, but I thought the food needed a little more flavor. For 2 servings, everything was in thirds. Next time, I will add just a little more of each ingredient to add more flavor and might consider adding more spicy sauce for, but I was very happy with the dish and so was my wife.

I also BBQ'ed this on my Weber Q320 and only put the middle burner on high and turned the other surrounding burners off. I put the fish all the way at the bottom of the grill, away from the flame from the middle burner. It took 30 minutes total. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  Made it in the oven.  My wife normally does not like fish, but she loved this.  Very easy to make, and prepare.(I served it on a bed of rice) Highly recommend this for even the novice, could not get any easier.  I cooked it at 190 degrees C for 30 Min in a Al. Foil bag and just scored the fish and poured the mixture in the bag.  Thanks for this great recipe.

This was delicious! I had to make a couple changes to the recipe. I had no chile sauce, so I used chili oil instead, and not a whole tbsp, because that would have been WAY too much heat! Also, I had no green onions to top it with, and instead of grilling, I put it in the oven at about 450 for 18 minutes wrapped in a foil pouch. It was so good, and still let the flavor of the salmon through. Hubby absolutely loved it! I put this over pineapple jasmine rice and served with an Asian-inspired cucumber salad. I will definitely be making this again!

This was great.  I panicked because I only had sweet chile sauce, but it turned out great.  Gave it a little bit of a sweet taste along with the kick.  My kids raved about it, and even snuck back in the kitchen that night for the leftovers.

Very, very good flavor.  Sort of more of a thai flavor to it.  A little lemon grass might be interesting with this.  This will now be my go to recipe.  Easy to make.  I have all the ingrediants always in the house.  All around great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

We made this last night by baking it in the oven - it was delicious! I marinated the salmon for 1-2 hours before baking. Marinating lets the flavors really permeate the fish. The time is well worth the improvement in flavor, so don't skip this step if you can help it! I can't wait to try it on the grill.

I actually hate salmon but love the health benefits so I usually try to choke it down as quickly as possible.  Not necessary with this recipe!  It masked the "salmony" flavor and allowed me to actually enjoy eating salmon like a normal person!

I make this recipe fairly often. It's good made in the oven or on the grill. When I do it on the grill, I open up the foil at the end to get a little smokey flavor in it and sort of caramalize the sauce a little bit. 
The recipe doesn't specify what kind of chili sauce to use. I've made it with sriracha chili sauce and with sweet chili sauce and I prefer it with the sweet chili sauce. Using sriracha was ok but a little strong for use with mild spring salmon. I also use Tamari soy sauce since I like the flavor.
This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing it.

Great recipe just as it is!  I didn't want to grill just for myself, so I made the marinade, enough for 1 serving and poured it over the salmon in a microwave safe dish (cover with plastic wrap with one corner left open).  I cooked it on about 70% power for 4 minutes, turning the fillets halfway through the cooking time.  Came out perfect!  From start to finish, it took about 10 minutes to prepare & cook.  Love it!

Wonderful!  I did double the chili sauce and use 2 tablesppons bottled lime juice instead of the juice and zest of 1 lime.  Served it with rice and garlicy beets (from this site) and a green salad.  My family is agruing over who gets the leftovers for lunch!

I followed the recipe as written.  Marinated the salmon fillet for 4 hours.  and due to rain, had to bake in the oven.  Baked the salmon in the sauce.  Turned out very tasty.  will definitely make again.

Awesome sauce. I roasted the salmon in the oven. Half the time covered, half uncovered to get a nice crusty top.

This was good.  I left off the lime zest (b/c I didn't use a fresh lime) and the green onions b/c I didn't have any.  I only used a 1 lb of salmon.  Next time I need over a 1 lb, we could have eaten more. I thought it needed a little more garlic and ginger.  Overall, very good.  My 5 year old loved it and was disappointed when it was all gone.

I'm not sure why I didn't clue in that this was an asian-type dish since it has soy and ginger...I guess the name was making me think it was a mesquite type flavoring...wasn't paying close attention there!  However, I did think the flavor was excellent!  I basted 4 fillets and baked for 15 min. or so at 400 degrees and I loved it over sticky white rice.  My family did not go for it at all, but I really loved it.  I made it exactly as is (except to bake instead of grill) and I wouldn't change a thing.  Great recipe...unfortunately I don't know when I'll get to have it again...  ***ETA I made this again when I had nothing else to make and forced the family to eat it, but this time I left out the ginger (due to not having any) and they gobbled it up--even the picky one! for picky eaters, reduce or eliminate the ginger, it still tastes pretty good.

I made this salmon last night and it was so delicious better than I expected.  I used only a teaspoon of the brown sugar and it was an awesome sauce. This is one recipe I will use for a long time.

This was just okay.  It really needed to marianate overnight, but I didn't since it didn't call for it.  I like marianades to cover the salmon taste and this didn't at all.

One of the best ways I've ever had salmon.  My husband and I love it!  I baked it wrapped in foil (too cold to grill) at 400 for 13 minutes.  Yum!

I made this for my husband - he told my he generally doesn't care for salmon (although he has been eating it) but this was delicious! I have to agree - this is great! I used filets and baked it in the oven because it was easier, in foil at 425 degrees for 20 minutes. This is a keeper!

I followed the ingredients but did not follow directions as written. I let it sit in marinade for a few hours and grilled directly on the heat without the foil but next time i think i will try the foil method. I think it would be more flavorful if it cooked in the marinade.Still very good.

Excellent flavor.  Used same amount of sauce but with a slab of salmon about the size for 3 people.  Cooked in oven at 400 for about 20-25 min.

To be honest, I would give this 2 stars but that was because I made changes which isn't the recipe's fault. I marinated the salmon overnight in half of the sauce. BIG mistake - the flavors were really really strong, and totally overwhelmed the salmon. We ate it but didn't enjoy it much. In this particular case, I would stick to the recipe instructions.

I used this as a marinade rather than a sauce and it turned out really well! I did use lemon instead of lime and no zest, plus a little more soy sauce than the recipe called for. I didn't find the flavors too overpowering at all, like some did, possibly because I didn't wrap the fish up with the sauce. I used a grill grate instead with great results.

Love this recipe! Marinated overnight to make flavors stronger (even though I know that isn't typically done with fish). Also added red pepper flakes, since we like spicy food, and added some teriyaki sauce and rice wine vinegar to the marinade. Fabulous!

I have used this sauce on salmon and really enjoyed it. Last night I used this same sauce recipe but substituted hoki fillets for the salmon and it was extremely delicious. My partner and I really enjoyed our fish done this way and I will try this recipe with a number of different fish fillets.

This was a good salmon recipe. I tried it with fillets instead of whole salmon. You'll want to be sure to make the cuts as described in the recipe, as the thicker portions of meat I made did not absorb the marinade very much.

Husband and I really enjoyed this. Had great flavor, and was easy to prepare. Anytime my husband gets to use the grill he's happy. Had a nice glaze when it came off the grill. Nice and juicy...a treat for your tastebuds.

It was really nice. I really don't like fish very much if at all and I didnb't mind the salmon with this sauce on it. My boyfriend loved it! (which is what counts.)

ATTN RWLEVINSON.  You can try thickening your sauce using a little "Wondra" flour.  It's a fine flour that doesn't clump up like regular flour. Add a little at a time until the desired consistancy.

It was OK.  Seems to me that this would be a good recipe to hide the fish in if you were eating salmon for health benefits alone...  It was fine, but wasn't spectacular...  If I'm eating salmon, I want it to taste like salmon.  All this tasted of was the (very good) marinade.

Not been a salmon fan, I have to say this was really good. I made it yesterday for my significant other who loves salmon and he thought it was really good. The kids ate it with no complains. Even my 4 year old ate it without saying yuck ( and she usually does) I agree with the others, next time I will double the sauce recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely Fantastic!  I have tried many salmon recipes but this is by far the best!  I also used fillets and will double the sauce the next time because it's that good!  I will definitely make this over and over again!  Thanks for giving me a salmon recipe that finally has lots of flavor!!!!!!!

We love salmon and are always looking for new ways to prepare salmon.   The ginger and lime gave the salmon great flavor.  It was a rainy day, so, I grilled on my indoor panasonic induction oven.  I think it would be even more flavorful on the outdoor grill!

I used a four pound red snapper instead of salmon. Added honey to the sauce & upped the garlic.  Cooked on the BBQ just as described, but the time went up to an hour due to the extra size I guess. This was a real crowd pleaser!

Loved this dish. Marinated salmon filets in the sauce for about 30 minutes, then baked at 400 for about 20 minutes. I wasn't sure if the recipe called for spicy chili sauce or sweet chili sauce, so I took a gamble and used spicy chili garlic sauce (the one with the green top). Then steamed some broccoli and mushrooms, then sautéed for just a minute with some of the marinade. Made for a great side.

Great recipe. I cooked in foil for about 25-30 mins it was just enough time to stay juicy but the sauce packed a punch. I added a bit of hot sauce to it to liven it up a bit and it was amazing! Will do again soon!

Yum!  I really like a grilled flavor so I cooked this in an iron skillet on my grill.  I cut the salmon into 2" fillets and marinated them in the sauce while the grill was heating up.  I added about a tbsp of olive oil to the pan and let it heat for a couple of minutes.  Then placed the fillets skin side up on the pan, poured the sauce over.  Cooked for about 10 min and then peeled the skin off the top.  Flipped it over on the other side to season it up as well.  It probably needed about 5 minutes on the other side.  Wow!  The sugar lightly caramelized the fillets an gave it a great grilled flavor.  Perfection - will do this again!!

Amazing recipe! I grate the fresh ginger instead of chopping it, the flavor is much richer. I also uncover the fish in the last 8 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken up and turn into a syrup type blend.

Excellent Asian inspired flavor! 

I added ~1T Sesame Oil and ~1T sushi Vinegar (low acid) to the recipe since it looked a little thin. It probably would have been fine though.

I removed the head, fins and tail from a 4 lb. Rainbow Trout and baked in a foil covered 9x13 glass baking dish at 425 for 35 minutes. Times will vary depending on how fat/thick the fish is.

We made this with a salmon my husband caught this week.  It went over so well.  We eat salmon all the time because of my husbands fishing obsession and this is one of the better recipes that we have found.

This recipe is awesome!! Not to mention quick & easy to make. I was not much of  a salmon fan before but I love it.  My husband loves this dish too!! The only thing I did different was I used 2 lbs salmon filet and baked it for 15-20 min in the oven at 425.

My husband loved it. He's been raving about it to everyone. So in his book it's a winner. I used fresh ground ginger instead of ginger root because it cost so much and I didn't do the fresh lime or lime zest just lime juice. Next time I'm going to try the real lime instead of juice.

Delicious recipe! The sauce compliments the salmon so well. Before its baked it tastes pretty salty. But I added some extra chili sauce and brown sugar to bring out thsoe flavors more. I also used ground ginger root instead of fresh and it tasted great. Baked in oven at 400 for about 25 minutes. Came out flakey and flavorful. Will def make again!

We used a sweet chili sauce which didn't give as much spice as we thought. The recipe was still great! We will do this one again for sure!

I think this had pretty good flavor although it was a little salty for my taste--I'll either do low sodium soy sauce or a little less next time. Also, the fish turned out dry because I think the temp on the grill was too high and the skin totally burned. I will cook it on medium next time and check it after 20 minutes. To help with the dryness I squeezed fresh lime on it. Also, didn't have any green onions so put fresh snipped chives on top. Oh, I also didn't have chili sauce but found a very simple recipe on this sight for it that seemed really good. Can't wait to try it again and hope for the outcome that most everyone else seems to have!

I love this recipe!  I made it first with salmon as the recipe stated, and served some of the leftover sauce with dumplings.  The next day I used the rest of the leftover sauce to marinate some meat and it was a hit.  Now it is my go-to marinade for chicken, fish, or beef!  Great flavor.

I was a little hesitant about bbq and salmon combined.  But the garlic and the slight sweetness really compliments it well.  If you love to try new things with alot of flavor this is definitely something to try!

It was a little too salty for my taste, but a very good spice and flavor nonetheless.  Next time, will maybe cut down a little on the soy.

You can omit the chile sauce if you don't have any. Also you can substitute 1/4 c. lime or lemon juice from concentrate. A little salt also helps.

Really great aroma and flavor.  I did this on the BBQ, but next time will do it in the oven.  I wasn't able to control the heat well enough in the BBQ and had to cook it much longer than specified.

This recipe was absolutely great!  Even my brother who hates seafood liked the sauce.  If you wrap it in foil when grilling/oven cooking it tends to hold in the marinade a little better.

It was a new way to make salmon, which was nice.  However, I would like to see it as more of a glaze or sauce added afterward.

It could be that we just did it wrong, but there wasn't much of the flavor after cooking.

This absolulety the best recipe for fish (salmon) that I have ever tasted.  The flavors are incredible.  Even my wife who is not a fish lover - has eaten more fish in the last month than the 21 years we have been married.

Very easy and tasty.  I left out the lime because I didn't have one in the house and it still came out nicely.

This was good but it isn't my fave recipe for salmon. I still prefer Grilled Salmon I (from this site) although the lime was a nice addition. I didn't have chili paste so I subbed crushed chili flakes & I used dried ginger for the fresh. I was also out of green onions so I used some fresh garlic chives instead. We served this out on the patio w/ the firepit blazing, w/ grilled corn on the cob, grilled pineapple slices (from this site), fresh slices of mango & Brazilian lemonade (also from this site). Very enjoyable dinner...thanks for your contribution, Jayda.
