These are weird. Like a bad cookie recipe with cereal mixed in. It just doesn't work, and I usually trust 'brand name' recipes above others!

Great recipe - bars are chewy, moist and delicious!  We made a few alterations; we used butter instead of shortening, we used Kashi Go Lean Crunch for the cereal, we used 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chocolate chips and we did not bother with the chocolate/walnut topping as these are decadent enough without!

I found this recipe when I searched for "granola bars" and didn't even notice in the description it says "cookie bar". That explains why I can't stop eating them! I used a stick of butter instead of shortening, honey instead of corn syrup, 1/2 cup regular flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, omitted the baking powder, and replaced the cereal with 2 cups of quick oats. I added 1 cup mini-chocolate chips and left out the toffee, peanuts and walnuts. Everything else I kept the same as the recipe.
These are a pretty good cookie bar (not the best I've ever had but not the worst either!) but if my husband asks, they're granola bars and are allowed on my diet, okay?

These were yummy but not my favorite granola/cookie bar. I used Oat and Almond Blenders as the cereal and I did not really like the texture of them. To be fair, I think it would taste better with a different type of cereal. Also, I think I let them bake a tad too long because they were kind of crumbly and dry. I think I could tweak this more to make it work, though.
