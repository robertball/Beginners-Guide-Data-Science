This soup was great! I let everybody at work try it and they all loved it. It turned out thicker than I thought it would but that made it even better. Thanks.

This is a very interesting soup, similar to the
popular Black Bean Turtle or Cuban Soup. The addition of o.j. gives it an interesting twist..
except that a cup seems to be a bit much. Maybe
3-4 oz. would be just right for my family. Liebelune you got a great thing going, keep it up!

This soup was really quick & easy... the orange juice gives the soup a nice flavor.  It did need a bit more heat, so I added a bit of green Tabasco sauce.  I will definitely add this to the recipes I make frequently.

Would have given this 5 stars but the recipe calls for WAY WAY too much salt.  I would only use half of what's called for if that.  I love this black bean soup otherwise. It's good with all the oj but looks better with half. With a dab of sour cream and salsa on top it's yummy!

I usually follow the recipe exactly the first time but this is one where I should have followed other reviewers' advice. I have enjoyed the flavor of black beans and orange juice together in other recipes, but this one has just too much orange juice. One-fourth cup to one-half cup would be great plenty. Perhaps this is also why the soup is so unattractive looking. The color is more like refried beans. There just wasn't enough interesting flavor, and the black bean flavor was completely covered up. It wasn't bad, but was very disappointing.

My husband, who hates beans of any kind and most soups, as well, absolutely loved this soup.  After I made it the first time, he begged me to make it again and add chicken chunks, or use it as a sauce over a chicken breast.

This was overall a good soup with good texture and flavor.  However, it was much too salty. I plan to make it again, but will add much less salt.

I've made this soup countless times, and I've always been pleased with the result. I substitute another fun-colored pepper for the carrot and its just fabulous. Be warned though, I find it so good, that it usually doesn't make it to 6 servings - I can usually get about 4 decent sized bowls out of it. :)

I tried it with just a half cup of orange juice as other reviewers suggested but then I could barely taste it, so if I make it again I would use a cup as suggested in the recipe. Don't be afraid of the orange flavor, it is lovely! Thank you.

I'm really not sure how to rate this one. If I rate on taste alone it would get 5 stars. But appearance is easily 50% of the experience and it was UGLY! Maybe 2 stars for appearance.  I will make it again, but I need to work on the appearance. Maybe I won't puree the beans. I did make quite a few changes. Here they are...I sauteed very lean bacon (6-8 slices) in the saucepan, then removed the bacon and added all the onion, garlic, carrot,red pepper, cumin, and 1 tsp corriander. Did not use the olive oil as I cooked the veggies in the bacon fat. I did not have enough onion (only 2 cups) so I added 1/2 cup dried shallots soaked in 1 cup water after the mix was tender but not brown. I added the beans and only 1/2 cup OJ. I omitted the cayenne pepper (kids would have hated it). Then I pureed 1/2 the soup. To help it look more appealing I added 1/2 c frozen corn and 1 can diced mild green chilis. When I served it I served it I topped with a bit of shredded cheddar, crumbled bacon, and cilantro. It helped it look a touch more appealing. Like I said it tasted GREAT! I will DEFINATELY make this again. My kids hated it so next time I will add the cayenne.

I chose this recipe because I wanted to use my immersion blender, and I wasn't disappointed. I served it with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread , nachos, and sour cream. It would not serve six hungry adults as a main dish. My husband suggested I add chorizo next time.

This is very good, but you can taste the orange juice a little too much, so the second time I made it I used 1/2 the oj called for; I liked it better. The third time I made it I sliced up two spicy smoked sausages and sauteed them first, poured off some of the fat and sauteed the vegetables in the remaining fat. I also cut back on the salt and cayenne (since the sausage had some in it) as well as halving the oj. Primo!

very healthy.  I like to add fat to most recipes like this for taste.  I added about 1 tbls of bacon fat and about 5 strips of crumbled bacon with chuncks of smoked ham.  About 1/4 pound.  I pureed about 1/3 of mixture and let it sit for a day to blend the flavors.  The orange juice taste blended over night.  excellant!

Excellent soup; just the right mix of ordinary and exotic to get the mouth bubbling.  I host a weekly dinner party and people coming in the door said, "I was hoping that smell was coming from your place!"  ...Always a great way to start a party!    I followed the reviewers' suggestions, added a couple of whole cloves, a tsp of oregano, a bay leaf and a dash of nutmeg, and topped it with plain yogurt and chives.  I mixed it all with a hand blender and then put in the diced red peppers for mouthfeel.

This soup is yummy... I got the recipe from a friend and really enjoyed it.  She adds 2 tomatoes, diced and uses 1.5 c oj instead of the 1c oj and 1/2 c water.  This soup doesn't look very good (I pureed about 1/2 of it) but it tastes great!

We did the recipe mostly as-is (I don't like peppers, so I skipped the red pepper). Not too salty for us, and the orange juice was perfect.

We found that we really liked spreading the (very thick) soup on some bread. It was awesome!

My husband and daughter LOVED this soup.  It had a really nice depth of flavor to it, unlike any other black bean soup I've made.  I think this was due to the orange juice. 

This was wonderful; we had it with bread and it was a hearty, meatless meal.

I am blessed with a family who eats anything and likes almost everything, but when I made this, none got eaten.  Without fail, the first word everyone said with the first spoonful was, "yuck".  That's a word I very rarely hear around our house!

I live in Central America for 3 great years and this soup brought back great memories!
I followed all the instructions exactly.  Then pureed half the soup, mixed it back in with the soup that was left then cut up some left over steak and simmered on very low for about 20 minutes.   This is definatley the best black bean soup I've ever tasted!!

After reading so many "love it" or "hate it" reviews, I was a little afraid to try this recipe. We found it interesting, not exactly brilliant but certainly not as bad as some make it out to be. We used all the orange juice and a bit more water as the liquid didn't cover the beans. It's a good change from the Tex-Mex black bean flavor.

Took other suggestions to limit OJ and glad I did. Still ended up with a really strange taste. I routinely make another especially delicious black bean dish, but this didn't turn out how I had hoped at all.

Really good! A very different taste from most black bean recipies. I did not have orange juice so I used pineapple juice and it was great. I also added about 1/2 cup red wine. I'm really glad to have this recipe--Thanks!

I loved this soup -- so easy to make! It wouldn't hurt to go easy on the cumin.

This is a pale imitation of Brazilian black bean soup (feijoada), and its kind of expecting steak and getting a McDonalds hamburger instead. It's not really HORRIBLE, but it ain't that great either. I thought it was too salty, kind of gloppy and the orange juice was overpowering in it, rather than accenting  it. I would NOT make this again.

I have now made this recipe several times and like to make a small batch for a healthy, high fiber meal.  I usually only use 1/2 cup of orange juice.  I have also made it substituting chicken broth....but like the tang of the oj.  This is not the prettiest soup, which is why it is not a 5...I always puree the whole batch, serve it with a dollop of sourcream and a bit of chopped red pepper.  This recipe is a winner for people who like black bean soup!!!

Great soup. I blend the soup at the end to make it soupier.

This was excellent! I added some chopped kielbasa after the pureeing was done, and let it all cook together for about 20 minutes. It was delicious!

Good recipe.  We have our own version of black bean soup and it was a nice change to add the orange juice.  I used 3/4 cup juice to 1/2 cup water.  I think next time I'll cut that to 1/4 cup water.  I will also add cilantro for some added flavor.

Excellent soup. I absolutely loved this. So many good vitamins too and the flavor, I have been nibbling all day, as I made it this morning and tossed it in the crockpot. Next time I think I'll wait until later to puree it and only puree a little. Of course my meat eater husband suggested chorizo sausage but it doesn't need it. It's great-thanks!

This is a great recipe and you should not be scared by the Orange Juice.  We like beans, so the only thing i would change on this recipe is just to add one more can of black beans.  Thank you for a great soup recipe!

Made exactly as written and thought it was disgusting looking...certainly didn't look much like soup, so...pureed the whole thing, added 1/2 cup of a good sauvignon blanc and some beef broth granuales in an attempt to mellow the orange juice. What came out was not only preety to look at, but absolutely delish. Will add to my black bean soup collection

I made it exactly as the recipe is written. It was really good!

Next time I would consider doing 3/4 cup OJ, it seemed slightly tangier than I wanted. 

I'll definitely make this again.

Very delicious! I'm eating it right now as a matter of fact. Very hearty. I put less than half a cup of OJ b/c i didn't want it to overpower, so as a result it came out more thick and stew-y. I stuck a stick blender in the pot and blended about half of it. Doesn't look pretty, but tastes yummy nonetheless.

I really enjoy the flavor and ease of this soup... I made it for my parents, though, and they both had stories for me about the prodigious gas they spent the next day passing. 

I'd consider that side effect a blessing, but those of you who are very conscious about being 'polite', tread lightly around this recipe!

This was interesting!  I was NOT a fan of the OJ, although I usually like the exotic things.  I didn't think it blended well, even after I reduced the OJ to 1/3 cup and let it "age" overnight.  The leftovers went bad in my fridge.  I am glad others liked it!

I made a few additions -- some diced jalapeno pepper, a can of diced Ro-Tel tomatoes with green chiles, some diced ham, and lots of cilantro.  Good recipe; citrus perks up the mix.  Thanks!

Didn't care much for the flavor of the orange juice.  I would recommend cutting the juice back to 14 cup instead.
