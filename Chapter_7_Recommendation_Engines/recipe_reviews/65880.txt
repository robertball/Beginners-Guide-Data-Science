My Father made this ham tonight for a family Christmas dinner. It was excellent! My three young children had about 5 servings and the rest of us commented about how flavorful it was. Since my Father is a chef, he did add some ingredients. Here are the changes and additions he made:
The cranberry sauce was the whole berry kind. He increased the lemon juice to about 5 tablespoons, used 1 Tbsp. of dry mustard instead of prepared, increased the ground cloves to 1/2 tsp. and added 1 tsp. ginger, 1 tsp. allspice, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. onion powder. The ham was so moist and delicious! I will use this recipe the next time I make a ham!

Very easy to make. I just heated slowly in microwave. Mildly spicy and a little tarty, it was good, the kids didn't complain so I guess it passed.

This recipe was so easy, and tasted wonderful!  I followed the advice of the previous poster about adding extra spices, except that I used prepared mustard. I mixed up all the ingredients for the sauce and poured it on all at once over a ham steak and baked it. It made my whole apartment smell like a holiday.

I had never paired cranberry sauce with ham, but this was delicious!  My whole family enjoyed it.

Ok, but doubt if I'd make again.  It did smell good while baking.

So easy to make and it tastes so good.  I sliced up the ham and put it into a casserole dish then poured the glaze over top.  Warmed it up and it was delicious!  I had never thought of using cranberry sauce with ham but it worked really well.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Used sliced ham and grilled it, and used sauce as a dip instead. Add ingredients based on other reviews. Cloves were a little too much for me.
