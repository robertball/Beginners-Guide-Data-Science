I increased the cranberry to 2 cups, and chopped up 1 cup of 'em in the blender before speading them in the pan. We liked it even better on the second day, warmed in the oven!

This recipe was very yummy.  I did make some adjustements - the amount of cranberries just didn't seem like enough, so I put in an additional half cup, and doubled the amount of walnuts, too.  A dessert to me isn't dessert without chocolate, so I added almost a half cup of chocolate chips.  It was hard to get the pieces to stay together when warm, but it came out delicious!

What a wonderful, easy recipe!  I made it and had to make another one the next day because the first one was gobbled up so quickly. Now I wish I had bought more fresh cranberries when they were available and put them in the freezer.

I had this at a party and had to ask for the recipe - it was TERRIFIC. Then I found it on Allrecipes.com and am so happy that I can make it for more than 6 and not have to guess at how to increase the ingredients. This is such an easy recipe that even I can make it!

My husband and I absolutely loved this pie. Living in New England we often use cranberries and continuously try different ways to use them.
When cranberries are in season I will definately be buying extras to store in the freezer to make this.
Thank you for a great recipe with simple ingrediants!

I made this to use up some extra cranberries and it was delicious!  I used 1 1/2 C cranberries to get more coverage of the bottom of my pie plate, and pecans instead of walnuts because that was what I had on hand.  I think this recipe is advertised wrong though -- to me it seemed like it would have done better as an upside down cranberry coffee cake.  Next time I will cook it in a round cake pan and invert to serve.  I think it would look prettier that way, and it really does taste like a coffee cake.

It was great as long as I had some ice cream with the bite of cranberries.  the cake part was perfect, I might try strawberries next time.

This was wonderful. I was afraid it was going to be too tart--berries this year make your cheeks pucker. But it was perfect. I did double the filling proportions because the pan just looked too empty but it was still perfect. Got raves. It's a keeper.

You won't find an easier or tastier dessert than this.  It's not the most attractive pie, but the taste more than makes up for it. Just plop some whipped cream on top and you're good to go. Thanks for sharing!

Definitely want to use 2 cups of cranberries! Was a little tart but a good excuse to serve with ice cream.  Made again because it was so easy - this time put it in an 8x8 and used pecans instead.

I made this for the church potluck and it was a big hit! I made it 1 1/2 times bigger since I had a Costco pie pan left from Thanksgiving. It turned out lovely and tasty. Not too sweet and just perfect with whipped cream! I'll make again for another party!

This was easy and good. I found it tart (well, it's cranberries!) even with the sugars. Nothing that a little vanilla ice cream didn't take care of. I also saw this recipe on the Ocean Spray website.

To me this was not a pie recipe. It is much more of a bar/coffee cake. I did use my staple pie crust as a base to these bars. I also threw all the cranberries and nuts in a food processor to get more cranberry throughout. I added a teaspoon of orange zest and it was a much needed pop of flavor. On the second batch I added a crumble on top (these bars are tasty but SO not pretty).
