Excellent recipe! I only omitted the cayenne pepper so it wouldn't be too spicy, and it turned out perfect for my tastes. I used a thinly sliced chuck steak and made this in my instapot and the meat was fall-apart-tender after just 40 minutes on the meat setting. I also garnished with Mexican cheese and a dollop of sour cream. The fresh pico de gallo and shredded cabbage were a nice upgrade from lettuce and salsa. Will make again soon!
