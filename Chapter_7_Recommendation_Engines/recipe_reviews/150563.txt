Very good :)  Made it exactly as written except added frozen corn (about 1/2 cup) and 1 can of black beans to make it a complete meal.  My daughter (who's 5) cleaned her plate and declared it "great!"

Great quick meal!  I've made this a few times, and it's always a hit.  I use brown rice, MorningStar Farms sausage patties (non-meat), and skip the cheese although I'm sure that makes it very good.  It's also good with some sweet red pepper sauteed with the onion.

I have a hard time with breakfast because I don't like eggs.  I'm constantly looking for more unique weekend breakfast recipes than pancakes, waffles, and french toast.  When I came across this it sounded yummy, and it is!  I've probably made this about a dozen times!
