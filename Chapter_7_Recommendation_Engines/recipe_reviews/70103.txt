This is an instant hit that is sooo easy to prepare.  I only changed it a little, adding a few   chopped garlic cloves and a little lemon juice to the marinade.  I also use thin sliced chicken breasts and drizzle warm Kikkoman's Teriyaki Baste and Glaze on top.  Looks like it came out of a 5 star resturaunt!

This was sooo good. My husband really loved it. I added chopped garlic and a little soy sauce to the marinade. I also seasoned my chicken and asparagus. The key is to use a wine that you love and let it marinate as long as you can.

Quite tasty and very easy.  I did not have teriyaki sauce so made my own.

This was so easy, and looks so fancy.  DH loves asparagus, and was estatic with this recipe. All the flavors blended well together. I think it needed a bit more flavor.  I will season the chicken with some garlic next time.

The chicken was very moist, which was great. My husband liked this a lot. I wished the chicken had just a little more flavor, but overall it was good; also quick and easy to prepare.

Good recipe - easy and tastes good!  Chicken came out nice and moist.  I didn't have honey teriyaki sauce so I just added 2T of honey to the marinade instead.  Will make this one again.

the 3 distinct flavors do mix well together. I wouldn't substitute the swiss.

Wonderful.  I think perhaps I overcooked the asparagus a bit, but everyone loved the combination of flavors!  Also I only had cheddar instead of swiss....never missed it...still great!

Loved it.  Followed directions except at end, turned on broiler to golden the cheese and asparagus so as not to dry out the chicken by cooking it too long.

My husband liked this much more than I did, so I averaged our stars.  The finished dish was gorgeous, and chicken was very juicy.  But the flavor of the chicken didn't blow me away.  Easy.

Great simple recipe.  I did not marinate, though.  I coated breasts in Honey Teriyaki marinade and it was delicious!  Will definitely make again.

Not too fancy but more than the sum of it's parts. I did what others did and added some garlic. Everyone liked it - it's a do-again.

i wanted chicken, made easy. this is very good. i,had to add a couple tablespoons of honey and sub. low-sodium chicken stock for the wine. the cooking technique was concerning...but i follwed the directions even though my breasts were huge. i cooked maybe 2 1/2 miutes longer at the steps. i had left-over swiss cheese for ham sandwiches after christmas, so i used maybe 6-7 slices of paper-thin swiss on top. glad i did! i used alumininm foil, sprayed with pam for easy clean-up. the breasts marinated about 6 hours. very easy, gormet looking meal. i served with asaigo/mozzeralla egg noodles and sweet cherry tomatos soaked in italian seasonings and basil. if you love terrayaki ckicken, swiss cheese and asparagus...try this!

I love, love, love this dish!  It's so simple and delicious.  I used green beans last night and was just as good!  Make sure you poke holes in the chicken before your pour marinade over it, really gives it good flavor!

Oh my!  Do not hesitate to make this one.  I made this exactly as stated and it was absolutely delicious.  Served it to five other adults.  There was not a scrap left.  This is a keeper for how delicious, appealing to the masses, and easy to make.  Plus it's a little fancy looking.

This was really, really good!  I put it in a crock pot, added some extra wine and placed the asparagus on top.  Left off the cheese.  It was delicious!

This was absolutely wonderful! It was a something different! My husband went back for seconds! There were no leftovers! We make this now at least once a week. We never tried asparagus until this recipe. DELICIOUS!

Delicious, and easy. I prefer it a little more done, so I gave it an additional 15 minutes baking time before adding the asparagus and cheese. Also sprinkling garlic on before baking added an extra zip. Served with sticky rice and enjoyed it.

This was so simple and quick, but VERY tasty.  I used Havarti instead of Swiss because of my husband's preferences. I also only had Teriaki so I added honey to the marinade. It was very moist and a good combination of flavors. Kids ate it up too!  Will definatly make again!

This turned out great! Impressing my boyfriend is hard, since he is a chef, but he loved it! I added some ginger and garlic to the honey teriyaki sauce and seasoned the chicken as well.
