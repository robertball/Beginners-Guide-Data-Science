I liked this as an easy and different way to prepare fish for a mid week sort of dinner.  I would recommend chopping the onions into smaller pieces.  We ended up with some practically raw onions in the casserole.

Loved it. Although I took out onions. Added tablespoon of dill and mixed 1/2 mayo 1/2 miracle whip with sour cream.   Also used ritz crackers instead of saltines.  I like buttery flavor better.  Yum!
