When I first told my sister I was going to make this dish, she thought it sounded disgusting.  I chose to make it because I like trying new things, and I had never seen these two things paired together before.  I've got to say that this combination was a delightful surprise.  I thought it was absolutely delicious, and even my sister who dislikes sweet potatoes said it came out better than she expected.  I'll make this over and over again in the years to come.

The potatoes did not cook in the microwave in 10 minutes; they probably needed 20, but I went ahead and put them in the oven after 12 or so with the cheese and balsamic. Only the ones touching the edges and bottom of the dish were tender enough to eat.  The flavor, however, was very unique and good; it was a nice change from the too-sweet sweet potato dishes I normally see.

For those who don't like sweet potatoes, this is the recipe to try!  I was afraid to go too heavy on the feta, but I should have.  It definitely makes the recipe.

Hate to give a bad review, but this really was not to our liking. I had high hopes for the flavor combination, but it -- and the presentation -- turned out to be quite unappealing. We didn't eat it after two bites.

i love sweet potatoes so not much can ruin them for me. this recipe was good for the most part. however, i used feta cheese crumbles and they didn't really melt well. i also tried this first with the tomato/basil feta and then again with garlic herb feta. both were fine but the balsamic over-powers them both. all in all a decent recipe but not one i'll make often.

Different way to fix a sweet potato.  I made this with one sweet potato and one yukon gold (husband) potato.  It was very good, but make sure you like the taste of feta cheese.  I drizzled a little more vinegar on it after it came out of the broiler.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great, healthy way to do sweet potatoes. My husband is a feta-fanatic, so any thing I can do to get him to eat well is a plus. I broil them just a bit longer to really crisp them up.

I served this side dish with the Blissful Rosemary Chicken.  Everyone was pleasantly surprised.  This was extremely delicious and different.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love all the ingredients of this and so hoped for the best.  It is edible (so if you have 5 lbs of SP to get through, it's worth a try!), but I won't be making it again.

We really were not impressed with this.  I served it as an appatizer during a party.  Personly I would have given it less stars but my guests ate most of it.  Nobody talked about it or asked for the reciepe though and I will not be serving this again.

This was good, and a really different way to prepare sweet potatoes.  I grew up on sweet potatoes, and I love them a dozen different ways, but my husband did not grow up eating them.  He doesn't like the way most sweet potato preparations are even sweeter - honey, marshmellows, etc.  He really liked this.  It is also a nice vegetarian meal.  I used lots of feta!

GREAT way to do sweet potatoes!  It's refreshing to have something savory!  The feta and balsamic are a delicious complement to these potatoes!  YUM!

I was unsure about this recipe suggestion but I am into trying new things. My daughter thought it was going to be disgusting when I told her what I was making. She was pleasantly surprised that it wasn’t as bad as she thought. She ate it but we both thought it was ok, not bad but not spectacular either. I won’t be making this again.

This was not a dish we enjoyed. This recipe had too much tang (balsamic/feta) overlaying the delicate taste of the sweet potatoes.  Similar recipes calling for candied pecan bits scattered over the top doesn't help and confuses the palate.

I think these are very good.  I do think even plain feta would be good.  I think they might be better with more balsamic vinegar, but I just ate leftovers today, and I thought they tasted even better!  Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't use the broiler on this, just microwaved the potatoes until they were soft and put the cheese and balsalmic on top. I thought it was a pretty good flavor combination, and a different way to have sweet potatoes than the normally very sweet methods of preparation. I would make it again.

Very disappointed with this recipe.  The feta doesn't melt under the broiler and the balsamic just didn't seem to blend with the flavour of the sweet potato.

This dish was ok, but the cheese overpowered the sweet potatoes and you couldn't tast them at all. I'm not sure if I will make this again.
