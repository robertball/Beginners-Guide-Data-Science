I made this recipe and put one jar in the fridge and the rest in the freezer.  My family finished one jar in 2 days and we have started on the second.  My daughter ( a strawberry lover) keeps raving about the fresh taste of strawberries.  This was my first time making jam and it was so very, very easy.  Will have to make more very soon as the first batch will not last very long.  I put the jam in small glass jars, not plastic containers, and it worked just fine.

I followed the directions & it tastes like strawberry flavored sugar.  Will try to make again, but not with this recipe.

I would have to agree with the other review, it did taste like strawberry flavored sugar. I disolved the sugar over the stove with the strawberries cooled it and then added the pectin and lemon.  It turned out pretty good.  I even made a batch with Splenda, for my mother who is diabetic.
