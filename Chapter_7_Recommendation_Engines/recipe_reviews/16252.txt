This was superb! The "cheesecake" layer is perfect to balance out the gooey sweetness of a pecan pie. I will be making it like this from now on! I took this as the desert to a family gathering, and the compliments kept coming. Also was asked for the recipe by everyone there! 
I made this on the spur of the moment and only had 1/2 a cup of pecans, so I used chopped walnuts for the rest and it was still delicious! (In fact, no one even realized it was mostly walnuts until I passed out the recipe!) Thanks for the great recipe, it's a definitely a keeper!
And a tip for getting a good bottom crust without having to pre-bake is to always use a glass or ceramic dish, stay away from the aluminum pans...

Delicious! I needed to feed a crowd so I used a shortbread crust and made these into bars.

Very yummy and very easy. Made for a dinner party and folks raved about it. Not overly sweet like many desserts. Omitted the cloves and still great. Would use maybe a half cup more pecans next time and the store bought crust I used was not the best, but I for sure will be making this again!

Yummy! This was a very good pie, nice change from the normal pecan pie. And it was really easy to make. I did have to change it up just a bit. I only had about 1/3 cup of light corn syrup so I used that and the rest dark corn syrup. Also left out the cloves. My family really loved this. Thanks!

My husband and all of my extended family absolutely loves this pie! I make it exactly like the recipe reads except I cook it for an extra 5 minutes or so. It always fills a large pie pan and it bakes up beautifully. I will confirm that a glass or ceramic dish is best with a roll out pie crust instead of the pre-made metal tin pie crusts. But even then, it's still good. The only recommendation I have is to let it cook an extra 5 to 8 minutes more than mentioned above. I cook on the center rack so as not to over brown my pecans but I think it sets up much better with that extra 5 minutes on it.

Loved it! I am not a fan of the sweetness of a regular pecan pie but my husband is. This was a great compromise. I followed the recipe but next time I will leave out the cloves (just a personal preference as neither of us are fans of his spice). Our company however, loved it just the way it was.

loved it, made it quite a few times and loved it every time. Could not remember where I had gotten the recipe and couldn't fine it for a couple of years,  tried a few others,  none were as good as this! So happy that I remembered where it was.

I had a different recipe  for this pie and I lost it. I then found this one and I was very disappointed in how it turned out. The cream cheese came to the top instead of staying underneath the pecans. It was also very unattractive.  It was edible, but the cream cheese was dry.

I made this with the crust from Pumpkin Cheesecake II from this site. I made it in a spring form pan. This may have contributed to some of my troubles. The pecan pie syrup started on top, but after baking it was at the bottom of the whole dish. It cooked into the crust, which was half pecans, so that was ok. The pecans on top had enough syrup on them to sweeten and form a crust. The cheesecake maintained it's own individual layer. It was a good flavor combination. Next time, I think I would follow my instinct and bake the cheesecake first to form a barrier to the pecan pie syrup.

Easy, rich, and delicious! I followed the recipe except left out the cloves, which are a little strong for our taste. Perfect holiday dessert.

Don't change a think, simply yummy!  As with any cheese cake type dessert, make a day earlier for full flavor.

This is my new obsession. Delicious, creamy, and not cloyingly sweet! I omitted the cloves because I don't like their taste, so it had just a hint of cinnamon flavor to it, which was fantastic.

Everyone seemed to really enjoy this pie very much. But I didn't feel the crust was done on the bottom. Next time I would partially pre-bake the crust first. Because the bottom crust wasn't well done it kind of mushed into the custardy part of the pie and I didn't find that very appetizing.
