I baked in phyllo cups, added sundried tomatoes, basil, spinach, garlic and an extra egg.  Great appetizer!

I cheated and used the prepared filo cups from the freezer section.  They turned out great and got a lot of wonderful reviews.  These will be on my quick and easy appetizer list.

I made these for the Super Bowl Party. They were very good. I made the filling according to the recipe but when buying the pastry dough each sheet (2 per pack)cuts into 9 almost 3x3 squares= 18 per box I still had plenty of filling. I coated them with the egg wash and seperated them into layer with waxed paper. They stuck to the wax paper, next time I will spay it with Pam first. They stay hot for quite a while so it is a good one to take to a party and they are fresh.

I love Feta Cheese and this just was not what I expected.  Very bland. I made up 4 before making up a whole batch as to not waste time and no one liked them. Sorry....

These are so good. I received many compliments on them from Feta lovers. I used the garlic and herb feta- and I wouldn't use anything else.

These were so delicious!! I made them for our annual Christmas Party, and they were gone in no time! I did get 18 appetizers from each package. Made them the night before, popped them in the oven as guests arrived, and they were wonderful.

I made these one week before Thanksgiving.  I brushed them with the beaten egg mixture, froze on cookie sheets, then carefully wrapped when frozen.  On Thanksgiving I put them on a nonstick baking sheet that had been lightly sprayed with Pam and baked at 15 minutes at 375. 

They puffed up beautifully and were really enjoyed by my company.  This was a very easy appetizer that can be custom made and frozen for an easy last moment appetizer.

I have been looking at this recipe for several years now and finally decided to give it a try. I did read the reviews and made some adjustments that I felt I would like. They were enjoyed by my Christmas guests. First off I bought the prepared phyllo mini cups. This made for very quick prep and they were easy to serve. You can make 30 mini phyllo cups out of the recipe. I used half feta and half mozzarella. If you truly love feta, I would say 100% feta would be fine. However, I felt that for my guests, the half and half would be better. I did add some sundried tomatoes. I really think roasted red peppers would be a great addition, but I didn't have any. I also used the tomato basil feta. This recipe is very forgiving. You can use any cheese and any additions that appeal to you and I think the end result would be very satisfactory. I have never used the phylo cups before, but I sure will continue to use them in the future. What a great idea!

Was very good. I added some garlic and Parmesan cheese to the mix and they came out pretty good. I think they'd be good for parties or any family gathering.

Was very good. I added some garlic and Parmesan cheese to the mix and they came out pretty good. I think they'd be good for parties or any family gathering.

Good recipe.  It did not go over well at our get-together.  But I had many people who were game to try it.  I personally liked them.  The main comment from them was that it was just a tad too much feta.

I made with Sundried Tomato Feta, then added some garlic and seasonings and they were amazing! Next time I will probably add prosciutto or roasted red peppers to give them some substance.

Yummy and addictive. I made basil pesto and spread that and some roasted red peppers on the pastry to give them more flavour. Next time I may add some garlic.

These turned out great. I made my first test batch today. I added a little bit of garlic powder and sprinkled some pepper. Also used a separate egg white wash. Cannot wait to make it again.

This was good.  I tried it twice and each time I made some adjustments due to some of the comments that the feta was overpowering.  I added cooked spinach very well drained and finely chopped, garlic powder and a bit of parmesan in place of some of the feta.
The second time I tried this I used a mixture of feta and goat cheese and omitted the onion and added dried cherries.  Both were very yummy :)
