I loved this pasta!  It was good and easy to make.  I did make several substitutions though.  I used angel hair pasta, instead of the tri-colored pasta assortment (honestly, I don't even know what kind of pasta that is); I used mixed vegetables, instead of peas; I used baked salmon, instead of smoked; and I did not include the shrimp.  It was still fantastic.  Besides the baking time for the fish, this recipe took 5-10 minutes to make.  Yum.

Just wonderful!  I really wish this site would let you do half stars.  As my wife and I give this recipe a 4.5.  My only additions to the recipe was a Tbl. more of EVOO, a pinch more salt, and a tsp. more of lemon juice.  Reasoning was, we cooked 12oz. of pasta as opposed to the 8oz. it called for.  

The smoked salmon and the taragon ABSOLUTELY make this dish what it is...YUMMY!!

This recipe was everything I wanted it to be: quick, simple, healthy, delicious, and easily adaptable! I smoked the salmon myself and it still only took 30-40 minutes to put everything together. I used angel hair because it was what I had on hand. I used 1T of a combination of herbs instead of just tarragon. I used 2T of lemon juice in the dressing because we really like lemon. And I used broccoli instead of peas. The oil really emulsified as I beat the dressing and made a delicious and easy dish! We will definitely be having this again. One caution: the 2 of us needed all the dressing! I would double the dressing to make the stated 4 servings.

I liked this recipe but you must be careful who you serve it to.  Fish does not appeal to everyone especially most children.

this was a good quick, tasty meal.  I had leftover shrimp and smoked salmon and this made a good meal of them.  I substituted basil for the tarragon.  I would make this again.

I liked this. I thought it was pretty good and filling. I found the recipe looking for a recipe to use vegetable pasta and a can of wild Alaskan salmon. I didn't have shrimp, but it was fine without it. I am not a fan of curry powder or tarragon. So, I just used the black pepper and some Old Bay garlic and herb seasoning and salt to taste. Additionally, I added some lightly steamed and cooled and shredded carrots to the peas for color. I liked how it had a nice light dressing versus the heavy mayo dressing in so many pasta salads. I also liked trying the salmon idea over tuna. ty
