Wow, this was great! I didn't think I would like the raisins, but they were perfect. Smells much spicier than it is. I think the spice level is just right. Five stars.

Great recipe!  My MIL does not like celery, so I added some Granny Smith apple and a little red onion instead.  I used low sodium broth and just a pinch of salt which ended up being much too little.  This was so easy to make.  The cous cous is just as great on its own as with the squash.

This is a great and very easy recipe.  One of the best that I have found for couscous.  I cook the acorn or butternut squash in the microwave for about 8-9 minutes which is a real time saver.  If you are saving calories use diet pancake syrup instead of brown sugar and melted butter.

This was really yummy! However, the veggies didn't get soft enough before the garlic and such started burning and sticking to the pan. So we ate them a little bit crunchy. Oh well. :o) The squash was tender and perfecto!!!!

Very tasty!  I substituted quinoa for the couscous to add some nutritional value, and added a finely diced red bell pepper and small crook-necked squash since they needed to be used up.  Dropped the cumin to 1 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, the result was the PERFECT blend of spices-not too strong, not too weak.  Accidentally left out the garlic but was still very tasty.  This made enough to fill 3 full acorn squash!

This is great! This is the only way we eat Acorn Squash now. It is a great last-minute meal with very little prep - good for when you have run out of meat. As other reviewers have said, it does make a lot of stuffing - but as the photos show, you can pile it up over the squash to make generous servings. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This was pretty good, but a bit bland.  My boyfriend hates raisins, and he wasn't won over to liking them in this recipe, either, though I thought the raisins were the best part.  I used vegetable broth since it's what I had on hand, but I think chicken broth would've been better. I also added some chopped chicken breast.  This made WAY more filling than needed for 4 halves of acorn squash, and I wasn't crazy about the filling by itself.  It was missing something.  If I were to make this again, I would tweak around the spices, probably add more cinnamon and/or ginger.

Speechless! Made it for the in-laws the first time around and it was a hit! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Ran out of brown sugar, so I used honey instead...turned out great!

Very yummy.  The stuffing was excellent, but the recipe made way too much to fill only two acorn squash.  I would either use four squash or cut the stuffing recipe in half next time.  Other than that, excellent!

I made this the last night.  I loved it.  It was very flavorful and quite filling.  The stuffing was great on it's own and has made plenty for leftovers.  I am not a fan of raisins but took another posters advice and tried them.  It was great.  I also used honey instead of brown sugar on the squash.  I will keep this recipe handy, it was very quick and simple.  :-)

I made this last night for a dinner party and it was delicious!!!  Very glad I read all the reviews, though, because the recipe as is falls a little flat.  I ended up baking the squash at 375 for 50 min, which was perfect.  I used a Granny Smith apple instead of celery, half an onion, the whole can of beans, more like 3/4 cup of raisins, and added probably about a tablespoon of cinnamon in addition to the cumin.  Highly recommend this - it REALLY makes the flavor more complex and adds another dimension.  Lastly, I added... ground turkey!  It was so good!  I'm sure it would have been good without it, but this way it was a full meal in and of itself.  Served with a salad, and it was a hit.  Next time, I think we'll try lamb instead of turkey.  Thanks for the wonderful idea - this will absolutely be a repeat in our house.

Love this recipe! Have made it about 10 times.  I usually add a whole can of garbanzo beans, which is more than 1 cup.  I use whole wheat couscous.  I have recently started drizzling a little bit of real maple syrup over the top when it is all assembled, call it a moroccan-canadian fusion.  This recipe freezes quite well.  I usually make extra and then freeze in containers by mashing the squash with the butter and brown sugar and putting that on the bottom of the container then adding the couscous mixture on top.

I loved the flavor combination of the squash and couscous, but I really felt like the raisins and veggies were drowned out by all the cumin. I felt that 1 1/2 Tbs of cumin is just too much. Next time I will also be a bit more generous with the raisins to get more sweet in the mix.

As a new vegetarian, I'm always hunting for new hardy recipes. This is a really wonderful dish! I followed the directions exactly (except used veggie broth) and it came out great. I don't usually like sweet dinners but this was surprisingly good and I will make it again. My only concern was that it came out a little dry for my taste. Next time I will add some diced apples and maybe a little more of the butter/sugar mixture in the squash. Even if you don't like 'sweet' dinner food, don't be afraid to try this. The cumin and raisins add a great dimension to the dish and combined with the natural sweetness of the acorn squash, it just works. Thank you for this recipe!

This was VERY good! Love the stuffing! and it did make tons more! I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings as it was for my daughter who is a vegetarian and this was her Thanksgiving "meat" portion. I did sub vegetable stock for the chicken stock, but everything else was the same. She loved it! I plan on having the stuffing leftovers for lunch today! YUM! Will definitely be making the stuffing again as it is so easy and fast to throw together! Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome dish and great presentation.
I'll definitely use it for a luncheon sometime soon.
Especially for a vegetarian alternate - it was great.
I did use suggestions:
1. scooped out the squash after baked and stirred with the couscous mixture to blend the flavors of the squash in better.
2. used freshly ground cumin.
3. used wheat couscous for a healthier alternative.
4. used small squash (apx 6 inches tall) so the 30 minute bake time was perfect .
5. added slivers of almonds on top.
5. I'll try other recommendations next time:
- add a little (fresh) ground cinnamon
- add a little dash of cayenne pepper
- add a small onion (chopped) to the mixture.
However, as the recipe is.. it's definitely a keeper

This my family's new favorite way to eat Acorn squash.  We use quinoa instead of couscous and craisins instead of raisins (nobody in my family likes raisins!) The first time I made it, I stuffed the squash as noted. Great presentation!! I think I'll use this for Thanksgiving.  But my husband thought it was hard to get equal parts squash and stuffing, so the second time I cut the squash up into pieces, roasted it and then brushed it with the brown sugar before mixing it with the stuffing.  Excellent!!!

This is amazing!!  The stuffing alone makes a nice side dish.  In my haste, I forgot to do the butter and brown sugar but it still turned out super! In the future, I'm just going to save us the fat and sugar and skip in! When I baked the acorn squash, I did so in a glass 8x11 and put about 1/2 inch of water in the bottom.

This was delicious, filling and a meal I'll definitely make again. Here's what I changed: I used the larger grained couscous, substituted vegetable broth, added cinnamon and a dash of ginger, honey instead of brown sugar and added dried cranberries along with the raisins. Can't wait to eat the remaining couscous for lunch tomorrow!

One of my new favorite ways with acorn squash! I made mine slightly different (or majorly, depending on how you see it) by using a Rice-a-Roni type grain mix for the stuffing instead of couscous.... all of the veggies, beans, and seasonings were the same. I added some chopped almonds too. Thanks for the recipe, Truckerdoo!

Great recipe!  I used pearl couscous and found that it was not quite cooked after 5 minutes of sitting in the broth.  I added 3/4 cup of water and cooked it on medium heat for about 5-8 minutes extra.  Delicious!

The squash itself was probably the best part of this recipe.  The filling was all right, but there was far too much cumin for my taste.

Followed the recipe with one exception - dried cranberries instead of raisins.  My husband loved it, as is even talking about it on FB.  The red of the cranberries with the other veggies made for a visually appealing dish as well as one which is healthy and delicious.

Yum!  Yum yum yum!  Hubby didn't think he would like this but he ate it up, squash included, and we had it again the following week.  I had a snafu in the kitchen and accidentally added quinoa instead of cous cous.  Quick thinking had me add extra broth and cook for 15 minutes until the quinoa was done.  Veggies were perfect, and I'll keep using the quinoa as we really liked it that way (though I'm sure I'd use cous cous if it's what we had on hand! :)).

Delicious, although, I changed it alot.  For fruit and veggis I used apple, red onion and carrots and used the garbonzo beans.  I sauteed those in olive oil and added garlic, cumin, some coriander and a little bit of cinnamon.  Then added the broth and couscous.  So Good!

Yum!  I find the presentation a little fussy, so I cube the squash and lay it out in a rectangular baking dish and spread the couscous mixture over.  This also makes it easy to warm up left over’s in the oven!

Very good, but needed a bit more flavor. I added 1/2 tbls of garam masala and pinch of cayenne pepper for some heat and that was perfect. I microwaved the squash as suggested by another reviewer and it took only 5min each half.  Next time I would add more carrots and celery and fewer garbanzo beans.  Very quick, heaty meal, will definitely make again!

Oh my word, this was amazing.  The flavor combinations were perfect! I have been looking for recipes that can double as a vegetarian main dish for myself and a side dish for my husband at the same meal where he eats meat and I may not.  This is absolutely perfect for that purpose! He loved it, I loved it, and our 1.5 year old loved it.  (Now I'm afraid any other dish I find will pale in comparison.)  Thank you!

I was a little hesitant on trying this recipe because there was no meat in it.  We had it for dinner and my husband and I LOVED it!  The only change I made was i used a box of Toasted Pine Nut seasoned cous cous.  It turned out FABULOUS!  I will definately be making this again!  Thank you for such a great recipe!!

I don't usually review recipes but this was sooo good. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars was because I did make some changes. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken so it would be vegetarian. Also instead of using cumin, I used all spice. I am not a fan of cumin to begin with and having lived in the Middle East, I thought all spice would give it a more authentic Moroccan flavor. I will be making this again and again. Thanks!

Followed the advice and dialed down the cumin (even though we love cumin) and used golden raisins in place of regular ones.  This makes a ton of extra filling, but it was tasty, so that wasn't a problem.  I enjoyed this unique presentation and the flavors really tasted better the next day.

Excellent dish! Used all veggies as recipe called for but added chopped zucchini as well.  I don't really like raisins except for eating plain but they really made this dish!  Next time, I'm adding MORE raisins than called for and adding crushed peanuts or cashews sprinkled on top for some crunch.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This was my first time using acorn squash, and let's just say I'm in love with this vegetable because of this recipe!!! loved the spicy couscous along with the sweet squash.  My husband is a picky eater, I kept avoiding the question when he asked what was for dinner...but when presented, it got an odd look, and won his vote after bite #1!

This dish was amazing. My fiance asked me to make it again in 2 days. I don't like celery, so I omitted it, I had forgotten to buy the beans, and instead of raisins I put in craisins. Delicious!

Really good. Will double the amount of carrots and celery next time. It also needs more raisins and less couscous. We used whole wheat couscous. I might try quinoa next time.

I followed the recipe exactly  Except,based on other reviews I added  some  additional spices : Ginger, allspice, nutmeg and a pinch of cayenne. The dish was easy to prepare, not bad, but it was definiteley lacking in depth of flavor, and not at all Moroccan( other than the cous cous which needed more than 5 minutesw of soaking) and I don't know that I would bother doing it again

Made this with ginger instead of cumin, no brown sugar since it has raisins for sweetness, I liked it. I will try it with a little sweet sausage next time.

I thought this was just ok.  I added some leftover roast chicken to make it more filling.  It was definitely a little too cumin-y, and lacking a certain something, but I'm not sure what.  It needed a greater depth of spices, maybe some chili powder or something?  I may try it again and tweak it a bit.

This is so great! I love the flavors and all the different textures. I didn't have carrots on hand so I added broccoli instead and used black beans instead of garbanzo. And instead of couscous I used rice - which just needed a little more time to cook. LOVE IT!! I will definitely cook it in the future. Plus it was affordable for my college budget.

I hate to be the only one to say, but this recipe was very bland. I made exactly as written just omitted the celery because I really don't like it. It definitely needs more flavor. I'm sorry but I don't think I would make this dish again.

Very tasty - I reduced the amount of cumin because I don't like a strong cumin flavour, and added some cinnamon to the mix. I also sprinkled a little extra brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the stuffed squash before serving. Went well with my grilled prawns and asparagus. I'm also enjoying some leftover stuffing today at work. Great alternative from our normal way of preparing squash.

I liked this recipe - I added ginger, coriander, and curry powder, and held the butter and sugar as the raisins sweeten it up nicely. I would add onions next time, too. Very hearty!

I really liked this. I made some substitutions based on what I had in the house--an apple instead of celery and lentils in place of garbanzo beans. It still turned out great. I don't think I used as much cumin as it calls for.

I never made couscous before but this was EXCELLENT! I brushed agave nectar on the squash instead of butter/ brown sugar and it turned out great. I had some frozen turkey meatballs in the freezer, so I broke those up and cooked in the pan along with the veggies. I also added a little water while cooking so everything cooked a little faster. Will DEFINITELY make again and again!

This recipe was a great way to find out I don't like cumin! I thought it overpowered the dish. I guess I don't like cumin as a main spice...I would maybe try this again with some different spices and only a touch of cumin. 1.5 tablespoons is just too much for me. The squash was delicious though, it came out very tender and juicy. I also loved the chickpeas in it. Just make sure you like cumin before making this dish! It's a lot of work for a big disappointment if you don't.

This was perhaps a bit bland but still pretty good.  My acorn squash was a bit big - it took 45 minutes till tender.  I also toasted the seeds from the squash during the last 10 minutes of cooking the squash.  I put them on top of the couscous, which definitely need some more crunch.  With that addition and perhaps some more spice, this would be a great recipe.

Better than expected! I substituted olive oil and salt & pepper in place of the butter and brown sugar for a healthier alternative and veggie stock for the chicken stock for the couscous. Plus, I swapped currants for the raisins as that's what I had on hand and it was delicious! Would definitely make it again!

I rarely give 5 stars, but this recipe was perfect as written!  The couscous had great flavor and was a wonderful filling for the squash.  I had to cook my squash a little longer than 30 minutes to get it tender enough.  I will definitely be making this again in the future!

This has a wonderful blend of flavors - wow, really enjoyed it.  I used cumin the first time I made it, and salt-free curry the second time.  I think I liked the curried version better!  But either way, it reheated well and had great flavor melding by the 2nd day.  Delicious and vegetarian - and an entree unto itself.

I didn't have raisins but it was still delicious. After I stuffed the squash, I put a little Parmesan cheese on top and put it back in the oven for 5 minutes or so.

This recipe was totally fantastic!  I saved one stuffed squash-half and brought it over to my father.  He ate it up and told me the next day he couldn't stop thinking about it!  I am making it again for my parents this weekend when they stop by to watch the ND game. =)

I really liked this. My husband didn't want to try it so I don't know his opinion...but I did change some things. I put the squash cut side down in 1/4 inch water in a baking dish for 35 minutes. I halved the recipe and still used the full 2 T olive oil. I added 1/4 cup finely chopped onion which I sauted with the celery, carrots and garlic. I upped the garlic to about 1 1/4 tsp minced. I sauted all the vegetables until they were fully cooked so as not to have them turn out crunchy like other reviewers commented. This was good but I think I'd eat the stuffing plain next time - squash was good but not needed!

I love the flavors of this dish!  I made it for my 1yr old daughters since the texture is soft enough (of course had to make sure everything was still cut up pretty small) and it is very healthy.  They ate it right up.

I loved this, my husband loved it without the carrots! I think next time I would parboil them for a few moments before sauteeing them. I diced up some chicken to add to the mixture. Very good, I can't wait to make it again. OH, and the filling probably would have done 6 servings instead of 4.

Followed the directions exactly- It is so good!  The squash took about 40 minutes to get soft and I had to add just a little water to the celery mixture as it started to dry out before the veggies were soft (I ended up covering the pan to speed it up).  Next time I am going to add some extra raisins.

Seriously good stuff! The seasoning isn't as complex as I like so I add about 1-2 teaspoons of ground ginger and a little bit of curry powder. It just gives the stuffing depth, in my opinion. Sometimes I microwave the squash instead of baking if I'm in a hurry. The leftover stuffing makes a good side dish for the following night's meal.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I took the suggestion from the last reviewer and added some apple and onion (instead of celery, but added a dash of celery salt). We ate the couscous mixture with squash last night, and for lunch today we ate it alone.  Delicious!

This was a marvelous recipe! I did make two additions to the stuffing - a little cayenne pepper for kick and chopped mushrooms. I omitted the brown sugar for the squash as it was sweet enough without it. The stuffing alone would be a great side dish.

This was a tasty little dish - except I think cumin is the wrong spice to use. If I make this again, I would go ahead and use the seasoning packet from the couscous box. Another reviewer suggested cinnamon but I'm not a big fan of cinnamon outside of baked goods. The only thing I changed was the time the squash cooked - it needed about 40 minutes and I didn't have any carrots so I used mushrooms. Great vegetarian dish and is great warmed up next day.

Delish!!! A great meal on it's own. Easy to make and very satisfying. I cut it in half  and  there is enough filling leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I'm a vegetarian and even my carnivore husband loved it and didn't miss a side of meat.

This is one of the best recipes for vegetarians I have found on this site. The thing I changed was the order of cooking. Cooked acorns first for 50 minutes, then left them in the oven with the heat off while I cooked the stuffing. Sautéed the garlic separately because it cooks faster than the other ingredients. Added it back into the pan after the other vegetables were softened. Like other reviewers, I used a whole can of beans. I also cooked the couscous separately and then added it in. I used I tablespoon each of cumin and cinnamon. Next time, I will pour the butter and sugar over the stuffing instead of just brushing it on the acorns to deepen the taste.

Excellent!  We cut back on the cumin to 1 1/2 tsp and used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  Even my daughter who claims to hate acorn squash ate this with gusto.

This was delicious! So many different flavors and they went together very well.  I cooked the squash in the microwave instead of the oven, and I used 1 tablespoon of cumin instead of 1.5.

I wasn't too impressed. The only thing I changed was to leave out the raisins. The first few bites were good, and then it was too much the same. I generally like North African cuisine, but this dish was not a favorite.

Awesome recipe! Thank you Truckerdoo!  I added an extra clove of garlic, subbed out the butter with ghee, added some turmeric and chili powder.  Hit the spot.  Seriously.

We liked this, but I felt it needed more spices to be really Moroccan. I may experiment with a few different blends, but overall the idea is sound. Also, for those squeamish about the raisins - I was suspicious but found they contributed to the dish rather than detracted from it.

We make this occasionally. It is one of my husbands favorites. I like the sweet touch of the raisins, and the fact that it is a fairly simple recipe to make. Not too big of a hit with the kids, but they will get over it!

I think the cumin was a little too much and I like spices. I would definitely use the cumin to taste... Otherwise, this was tasty and I felt like the squash and stuffing went together very well.

Amazing!  I did end up freestyling and used celery, carrots, red pepper and zucchini.  No beans and no brown sugar - I used dark maple syrup instead.  I will be making this often!  Thank you!

Great recipes.  I subbed in quinoa for the cous cous (prepared in a separate pot with vegetable broth) and chard stalks for the celery (more healthy and tastes better).  Next time will consider adding more carrots and some finely chopped nuts.

This is one of the best possible ways to cook acorn squash.  I added diced chicken breast to the carrot mixture.  All of the spices blended together, the couscous, and the veggies, which are only further augmented by the natural taste and texture of the squash, come together to create a phenomenal creation.  Thank you so much for the recipe!  I'll be making this one again and again...

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  So sweet and the flavor is amazing!  I have never used acorn squash before, and I bought it on a whim because it was on sale at the grocery store.  This was the first recipe I found when I was looking for something to do with it, and I am so glad I chose it!  I will be making this all the time now!!

Excellent! This was the first time I ever cooked an acorn squash, so I didn't know what to expect. It was very good, relatively filling, and (except for the chicken broth) vegetarian. I will be making this again!

This recipe is delightful! The stuffing is delicious. I added just a bit of garam masala spice as I sauteed the veggies, and then added some feta cheese at the end right before stuffing the acorn squash and baking. This one is a keeper!

Loved this recipe! Go ahead and make the stuffing while the squash is cooking.  It takes a while for the veggies to get really tender.  After I brushed the sugar and butter on the squash, I put it under the broiler for a bit to caramelize.  If you have extra sugar and butter, you can drizzle it on top of the stuffed squash and even picky eaters will like it! I will definitely make this again.  Thanks Truckerdoo!

Yummy, satisfying and really healthy. I took a suggestion from another reviewer and substituted apple for the celery (not a big celery fan anyway) and that was a good move. I reduced the amount of cumin and that was NOT a good move. The recipe was dead on in how much it needed and I will use the full 1-1/2 Tbsp next time. We used veggie broth instead of chicken. The kids both liked it as well, although one thought the garbanzo beans "didn't add anything to the dish." Will definitely put this in our rotation.

Great combination of sweet and salty; I salt the squash before I bake it.  Because I hate raisins I use dried cranberries instead that I reconstitute in hot water and omit the cumin.

I loved this! I was tempted to add some other spices but after more pepper and salt it got there without.  The squash could've been left in longer it was a bit undercooked. I replaced the couscous with a Publix brand Chicken flavoured rice mix, (cooked the rice with a bit more water) and forego on the chicken stock. I hope to cook this again.

This was very good. I omitted the raisins and didn't have garbanzo beans, so I used navy beans, still tasted great and went very well with the squash. A little parmesan cheese added another layer of flavor.

This recipe is fantastic! I didn't cook the squash long enough, so I will make that change next time. Other than that, no changes needed. The flavors are amazing and your house will smell great too. :)

Probably one of my favorite recipes ever. Be aware that it does make more filling that you can stuff, so either cut it in half or make more acorn squash. I doubled most of the veggies and cut down on the couscous. Incredible, and a very easy way to impress a dinner party.

Wonderful introduction to couscous for me.  I did sub cooked chicken for the garbonzo beans because I didn't have them...and used dried apples instead of raisins for the same reason.  It was wonderful, husband loves it too!!!  Had to cook the squash in the microwave for a little because it wasn't soft after 45 minutes in the oven.

We made this with sweet dumpling squash and really enjoyed it.  My husband typically doe not like vegetarian meals but commented that this dish was very satisfying and didn't need meat.  My infant had a few bites of the flavored couscous and couldn't get enough!

I really liked this recipe because I needed to use up some acorn squash, and I had all the other ingredients at home already.  The couscous mixture is good on it's own as well.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and added an onion.  I also needed to cook my squash an extra 10-15 minutes, but it took that long for me to chop/assemble/cook the stuffing anyway, so it didn't matter.

I tried this recipe tonight and it is fabulously easy and delicious.  In addition to the other ingredients, I added one chopped apple, 1/4 chopped purple onion, and dried cranberries because I didn't have raisins. I also added 1 tsp of corriander.  I put the halved and seeded squash cut side down in a dish and in the microwave for 15 minutes. It only took me about 30 minutes start to finish.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

Doubt I'll make this again, although the presentation was pretty.  The squash wasn't cooked and my husband thought it had too much cumin flavor.  I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins, which did add a nice sweet flavor.

This was very good and makes an impressive presentation.  My 10 & 13 yr olds really liked it.  Good way to get the veggies in.  Only changes:  I added slivered almonds.  Next time I will drizzle the finished dish w/ a bit of honey.  Be sure not to under salt.

I really didn't like this all that much. I mean, it was okay, but was lacking a lot. I don't think the acorn squash added all that much to the meal. It was really bland compared to the couscous, and took away from the flavor. The cumin level was a bit much, yet lacked a lot of other spice flavors. I added some allspice, a bit of cinnamon and clove to give more of an authentic moroccan flavor, but it didn't really help.

I enjoyed this take on stuffed acorn squash.  I substituted quinoa for the couscous (cooking it ahead of time) and granny smith apple for the celery, garlic, and raisins.  It tasted good, but I think I need to play around with the ingredients a bit more to get it just right.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe.  I find there is a lot of filling for the squash but we make it all anyway and eat it as left overs the next day.
I add more veggies than called for and more rasins because I like the taste.
We bake the squash, scrape it out and add the melted butter and brown sugar too it then put the couscous mix on top.  Very tasty!

This was really good! I made some changes, which is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. Here's what I did differently: I sauteed the onion and celery in olive oil until they were almost soft, then I added a couple of cloves of garlic, 2 green onions chopped up, and about a cup of shredded carrot because I had that in the fridge. I let that cook for a couple of minutes, then added the cup of garbanzos and about 2 T. of raisins and probably a cup of cubed rotisserie chicken meat. Stirred it around, then added the cumin and a dash of cinnamon, but I'm not sure the cinnamon added anything. Also, I seasoned w/salt & pepper at each stage. I added veggie broth and let it come to a boil, then threw in the couscous. I filled the cooked squash with that mixture and topped it with some parsley to make it look a bit nicer. YUM!! You have to try this.

Couscous was very tasty.  However, I did not care for it with acorn squash.
I made the couscous with vegetarian broth instead of chicken--an easy substitution.

I really enjoyed this! Even my boyfriend who does not like "health food" type stuff liked it. I did make a few changes: I left out the garbanzo beans, and used quinoa instead of couscous. Quinoa is a whole grain, I believe, and couscous is actually a pasta so that may have made it a bit healthier - although it took a little longer to cook and was a little bit chewier in the end.

I didn't have celery or carrots so I substituted what I had...lots of fresh bell peppers!  I also doubled the amount of garbanzo beans (so that I could use the whole can) and I'm really glad I did!  They were the best part!  This was very tasty and got rave reviews from my guests!

WOW!! This was great, what a wonderful and unique squash recipe!
I made a few changes. I didn't have broth, so just used water and added some thyme and extra spice. Instead of celery, I used chopped spinach. Instead of sugar, I added honey to the melted butter.
There was quite a bit of 'filling' left over. Refrigerated, it made a WONDERFUL cold salad the next day. I plan on using it this way as a potluck dish. 
Will definitely be making it with the squash again too, such a pretty presentation!

Wonderful flavor! My boyfriend made this for me. He added extra garlic and celery, added cashews along with the raisins and all available vegetables. Made vegetable broth substitution. Hearty and satisfying

I made this dish today for a friend who is vegetarian and made enough for my husband and I as well. It was AMAZING!!! I loved the sweet and salty flavor. I discovered acorn squash recently at a local restaurant and have been hooked on it. I made the recipe exactly the way it is, except I added some cinnamon. Although it was great as-is, I might add some nuts next time as well.

Turned out great.  Added 3 diced cooked chicken breasts at the end to make this a main dish for my DH.  My DH and his dad both loved this recipe.  The stuffing to squash ratio is great even though it's hard to fit it all in.  With the chicken I think this serves 3 to 4.

This recipe is fabulous, unique and relatively easy, I've made it twice and everyone loves it.  Making vegetarian food for my "meat & potatoes" parents is always a challenge, but they loved it, were very full, and even ate the leftovers the next day...wow!

What a great change of pace and it's so easy to make! I used 3 acorn squashes, which was perfect for the amount of stuffing this recipe makes. The stuffing also makes a great side dish. Thanks for submitting this great recipe.

This recipe is what got me started coming to allrecipes. It is so wonderful!  And very quick and easy. I cooked it with a food aficianado I know, and she loved it too. One time I substituted the larger sized cous cous (looks more the size of tapioca pearls) and I like that even better. The bigger sized couscous made the flavors even more available. Great recipe.

This recipe is so yummy and easy. The first time I made it in the acorn squash.  The second time I brought it for a potluck lunch.  I omitted the acorn squash and sprinkle some brown sugar into the couscous and served it cold.  It was just as delicious.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful.  I made a few changes that I would suggest if you want to turn this into a main course.  I added diced chicken breasts and onion.  I also used a can of mixed beans rather than the garbanzos on their own.  This is a fantastic meal!!

This was pretty good (despite my husband discovering he doesn't like couscous....) It wasn't quite what I had hoped- I think I will play around with different veggies, or finely dice the carrots and celery. They seemed to overpower the rest. I did add a bit of cinnamon, which was a great addition. I'll make the stuffing again, but I will alter the veggie choice or size.

I loved this recipe!  I even passed it on.  I used both butternut and acorn squash, and both were equally tasty (though the acorn was easier to stuff).  The small changes I made were as follows: I cooked the squash longer, so it was very tender, and I added more cumin and more raisins. The sweetness of the raisins were a perfect compliment to the saltiness of the cous cous.  This was a perfect, complete vegetarian entree.  Bravo!

I made this recipe two nights in a row because I liked it so much! One little change I made was using curry-flavored cous cous instead. If you can find it, I highly suggest it. I can't think of a better way to enjoy acorn squash!

This recipe is really great as presented here, so if you do it as-is, I think you will be pleased.  I've made this a number of times, and have done some variations, with one in particular that worked well.  Instead of raisins, I substituted cranberries. I added some chopped green olives and mushrooms, as well as a teaspoon of garam masala. Additionally,  I topped it with a little goat cheese and cinnamon.  Again, the recipe in it's original form is very good, but it lends itself easily to some nice variations!

Really good, used ras el hanout (Moroccan spice blend) instead of cumin and veggie broth bc I’m vegetarian and added half an onion, parsley, some chopped dates and dried apricots, sliced almond and lemon juice cuz I had them.

I used the full amount of cumin and didn't think it was overwhelming. Just right. Also added 1/2 tsp of ginger. 

Cooked the squash in the microwave and never even turned on the oven. 

Used quinoa instead of couscous (for extra protein), chopped dates instead of raisins (it's what I had), and red bell pepper instead of carrots (again... what I had on hand). Delicious!

I would absolutely leave out the butter and brown sugar next time. It just doesn't need it. And, not worth all those extra calories. The 2 Tbs of olive oil is plenty.

Was given an acorn squash, although I've never had it or made it before. I had the ingredients for this recipe on hand, and the whole family loved it and asked for more! Threw in some cooked chicken along with the garbanzo beans.

I had an acorn squash and found this recipe.  I halved the recipe and was working along when I realized I had no garbanzo beans...so I left them out..  There was nothing left and it made a full meal for the two of us.  It was easy to do.  I did use the microwave to cook the squash halves in. as it was 90 degrees outside and I did not want to use the oven.   
Since I made it, I found that Hanover House has teh small cans of garbanzo beans..which I now have here.  We will have this again, using the garbanzo  beans for additional protein.

This is a great recipe. One of my squash was bigger and thicker so I microwaved it for 3 minutes prior to placing it in the oven. I had plenty of filling leftover to eat as a side dish for another meal.

Yummy, this was great!  I didn't have raisins so I chopped up some of a sweet apple I had.  The sweetness of the butter/brown sugar mixture kicked this up a notch, and I ended up sprinkling a little of it on top of the stuffing too.  I skipped the celery and it was still very good.

I had to change this based on what I had.  Subbed two apples and a purple onion for the carrots.  Threw in a small red pepper.  Most importantly, I switched out the cumin for curry!  So if you like the original, I think you would like this too.

With only two of us we cut this in half, and it worked very well.  We added 8 oz of wild mushrooms with the  chickpeas and replaced the broth with tomato juice from canning homemade spaghetti sauce.  Added a bit with the mushrooms and let that be absorbed, then added the amount suggested with the couscous.  Delicious!

I cooked used brown rice instead of cous cous and when it was nearly cooked (needing about 10 estimated minutes more of cooking time), I added the garbanzo beans to ensure that they cooked thoroughly. I then added the bean/rice mixture to the cooked spices and vegetables/raisins. Absolutely delish!!! Was phenomenal in the squash and would be amazing as its own side too. I will defi be making this again!!

I love the versatility of this dish. I accidentally bought quinoa instead of the couscous and it turned out fine. I just had to make sure to prepare the quinoa separately because it's a grain and not a starch. When I ran out of squash I ate this right out of the bowl as leftovers. Whatever you do, do NOT omit the raisins, regardless of how you feel about them, they add a necessary sweetness. I fell in love with Moroccan cooking after trying this and chermoula (which goes really well on this).

I didn't have raisins so I used dried apricots and loved the substitution.  My squash took a lot longer to bake.  i guess they were on the large size.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 like others mentioned and still had plenty of stuffing.

I loved how the squash becomes a bowl, there ends up being extra stuffing which is fine by me. It makes it so that if you run out you can just get up and add more.

This is a Wintertime favorite for us. I added a little bit of cardamon. I also did Moroccan lentils, found on this site and the two paired great together. I would top it with some roasted pine nuts.

Great easy recipe for a lesser used squash. Smells great while cooking, tastes spice level just right when done. I added a small shallot along with the garlic which enhanced the flavor. I cut the brown sugar to a quarter of specified so I would not confuse this version with the childhood one of brown sugar and butter only! This will be cooked again.

Very nice combination of ingredients. Colorful and filled the kitchen with a wonderful aroma. As the recipe indicates it makes more thank enough stuffing for two squashes, which is a good thing because this is good stuff!  Will look for a substitute for the brown sugar and might add some red bell pepper next time just to jazz it up but this recipe is great as it is.

I liked the couscous a lot. Didn't care for the squash along with the couscous. It was pretty but didn't think the flavors melded right. Used whole wheat couscous, sauteed an onion and apple instead of celery (would do this again). Used about 1tbsp of cumin and 1tbsp cinnamon and a bunch of salt. Everything else as listed in the recipe. Good served room temp too.

I have made this twice and it turned out great both times.  In addition to cumin, I also used some garam marsala.  In the future I will try to add more vegetables such as spinach and zucchinis.

This was delicious. I did not use the butter and brown sugar and before stuffing the acorn squash I roasted it a little longer with salt and pepper. The stuffing was amazing!

I didn't have raisins...they don't agree with me but I did have about 2/3 cups of dried currants so while I was prepping I added them to a cup of warm (not hot) water to soften a bit and used in place of the raisins. Added a bit more garlic because me & hubby love garlic and only had one acorn so we had leftovers which was absolutely fine! My dear hubby just kept moaning in cuisine pleasure...every single bite! Matched this with "Easy Garlic Broiled Chicken" by AVASEWELL for a wonderful meal and lunches for the next day.

Pretty good as is, but I think next time I will add some curry and some onions to give it a little extra. Also, I needed to cook the squash a good bit longer than thirty minutes.

I used quinoa instead of couscous. I didn't stuff the squash; I cubed it before baking it then made it all one dish. I also added more garlic and less cumin. It may need a dash of cinnamon to round the flavored out or something, but it is pretty satisfying as a meal.

Fabulous! I made a mistake and grabbed quinoa instead of couscous, so I added a little more chicken stock at the very end and cooked for 15 extra minutes. It was still amazing. I think the couscous would have been great as well.

I will make this again. It's actually easier than it looks. I actually went without salt and pepper because I was hoping to feed it to my baby as well. But the seasoning is so flavourful already that it even tastes good without salt.

I'm definitely not a cook, but this turned out well. First time out of the box for me. My experience was only in boy scouts. I forgot the brown sugar, so my girlfriend added a little on the edge of the squash. Very filling meal, very good. I didn't have raisins, so we used cranzins. Our squash was a little bland Oh no, she just said the since I've proved that I could cook, now she will expect more, and often. ours was veterinarian broth. I only gave it a 4 because I have no reference point.

Made this recipe last night.  My fiance loved it.  We went meatless a couple of months ago and recipes like this make it easy.  I had to cook the squash a little longer and therefore cooked the veggies a bit longer. I also subbed out the couscous for quinoa since I had it on hand.  Worked well!  Will definitely make this again.  Flavors were great.

Delicious! I read the reviews before I made this so I took it easy on the cumin and I am so glad I did. The recipe calls for way too much for my taste. I had the Near East brand of couscous in the Roasted Garlic and Olive Oil flavor and followed the recipe on here as best I could. Everything was soooo good! My kids loved it too! Even my picky two year old that HATES vegetables mowed it all down. It is excellent as a leftover as well :) Definitely making again.

It was fine I guess. A little awkward to eat. But an interesting way to eat couscous.

Wow! Exceptional recipe both in taste and visual appeal. This dish is very adaptive to personal tastes and ingredients on hand. Because I did not have raisins and couscous I substituted dried cranberries instant brown rice.

This is good, and looks impressive, but the flavor of the filling was bland. Next time I'll add additional spices.

Exellent vegitarian dinner.   I was inspired by some of the suggestions and subbed in quinoa.  I added 2.5 tsp garam masala and 1/2 tsp cumin instead of suggested spices.  I added a little maple syrup to the butter and brown sugar glaze.  This is a bit sweeter than it was intended but the garam masala is awesome with the hint of maple.  This could easily be converted to a vegan meal.

I love that I can get on this website, type in a few ingredients and always find a recipe. Not all come together, but this was super yummy! I had one squash that took longer, but I put the buttery goodness on both at the same time. My house still smells so buttery sweet!
Out of preference, I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar, and based on what I had in pantry, I used cranberries, and quinoa. I made extra stuffing on purpose. Your right! Awesome by itself. That's how my kid ate it. Thanks for another amazing keeper!

Wow! This is amazing!
So so so good! 
Perfect balance of sweet and savory...wonderfully deep flavors. 
A definite keeper with or without the squash!
(Oh, a few changes: I left out the garbanzo beans [not my style] and swapped craisins for the raisins.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful.  The squash took closer to 40 minutes, and the only changes I made to the filling was to add onions, cut back on the cumin to about half and I used currants instead of raisins.  Delicious!

I prepared this recipe as written other than baking the squash about 5 minutes longer so that is was cooked through.  I wasn't impressed with the flavors of this dish, and like other reviewers, found it quite bland.  I might suggest incorporating other suggestions and adding more spice!

Loved this.  I did halve the recipe and I added a spice mix called Balti to the stuffing.  Incredible.  I didn't have any raisins so I just left them out with subbing anything else.  Still wonderful flavor.

I used carnival squash because I haven't loved acorn in the past. It took an hour to roast but this dinner was worth it. It looked so beautiful and was really filling. I didn't love the celery. It could go without it. I might try some toasted pine nuts next time. There will definitely be a next time.

This was an excellent dish, I think a little heavy on the cumin (I only used 1 tbsp rather than 1.5), but all-in-all very tasty.

This was my first time making this recipe, and I liked it a lot.  I used Israeli couscous with yellow raisins.  I didn't have carrots or chick broth, so I substituted red bell peppers and vegetable stock.  I also added coriander and a dash of curry seasoning.  I was going to add Italian sausage, but forgot.  After tasting, I think that chicken sausage would be just as good.  Make sure to season with salt to taste.

This was an easy dinner. I found it to be a bit hot so would make it again with less cumin. It would also work with cranraisins. I used the insides of the squash (seeds and all) for a soup broth that turned out amazing.

It was ok.  If I make it again, I will cut the stuffing in half and use some different spices.  As it was, I found the cumin to be overpowering and couldn't taste the other things in the stuffing.  Loved the taste of the baked acorn squash with the sugar butter, but thought it slightly odd with the stuffing as is, but think with some other spices it might work for my taste buds.

awesome! so easy and simple to make. I didn't have cumin, so I used coriander and allspice instead. Also threw in some onions, slivered almonds, and dried apricots. Hubby and I both loved it!! Perfect easy fall recipe. Delicious and warm.

This was delicious and I wasn't a big fan of couscous! The only thing I changed was that I didn't serve in the squash but mixed the squash in (easier to serve that way) and I added onions because I love onions!

Delicious--a really lovely dish.  I substituted currants for raisins, left out the celery, used chicken stock instead of chicken broth, and sprinkled gruyere cheese at the end and toasted it to melt.  Fantastic.  Would definitely recommend adding the cheese!

We loved this.  I used quinoa instead of couscous.  I'm a vegetarian so I used plain water instead of chicken broth and it was still very flavorful.  It's so pretty, would be great for company.

This recipe was really amazing, my husband loved it!  I did change a few things though, I added diced up mushrooms and onion either way this is a filling and excellent seasonal meal.

I wanted to make this for company, one of whom can't have wheat, so i used quinoa instead of the couscous.  I cooked the quinoa seperately according to the package directions and then stirred in the raisin mixture.  It was marvelous!  Very filling and high in fiber and protein, even without the beans!

Outstanding!  I made the couscous stuffing only as a side dish for Grilled Lamb Chops (also highly recommended!) and everyone loved it - even the kids.  Used regular-sodium chicken broth and 1/4 t. salt and thought it was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is a great idea.  I did not follow it exactly, as I didn't have most ingredients on hand.  But I took the idea and ran with it...and the husband says it gets put in the top 10!  I baked the squash...but then while it baked I started cooking veggies in the pan (I only used bell peppers, garlic, and onion).  I actually only sauteed them for a few minutes, knowing the chicken broth would soften them.  I added drained black beans and spices plus chipotle pepper, then used quinoa instead of couscous (again...this is the stuff I had on hand).  Took a little longer than couscous to soak the broth up.  Once done I added cooked chicken to the mixture (which you certainly don't need for added protein) and stuffed the squash.  Great idea for me to run with!! I can't wait to try the actual recipe!!

So delicious!!!  I would make this exactly as described in the recipe except for the amount of raisins, I used half the raisins and bought golden ones.  I bet some orange peel mixed in after the couscous is done wouldn't hurt either...

This was excellent!  I almost used some garam masala in place of the cumin, but opted to follow the recipe with the exception of using whole wheat couscous.  I'm sure the spice blend would have worked beautifully, but frankly there was nothing wrong at all with just the cumin, salt & pepper.  Cooking times were perfect and the brown sugar/butter glaze and the raisins complimented the other savory flavors well without making it too sweet.  Lovely, lovely dish! I piled my stuffing on high with the aid of an ice cream scoop.  Thanks for sharing your recipe! I;m planting acorn squash this year and hopefully I'll be able to use this one often!

This was very good, but a bit bland. I will definitely make again, but next time I will scoop a lot of the acorn squash in order to make room for more stuffing.

I would use less couscous so that the veggies stand out more. The couscous seemed to overwhelm the veggies. Also we really liked the addition of onions in the saute mix.

This is a unique recipe.  I think it needs a slightly longer cook time for the carrots, celery and chickpeas to soften, but that depends on your preference.

I skipped the squash and just made the stuffing. I found it a little bland so I added sauteed onion, more cumin, and a 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts. Loved the end result and will definitely make again!

My husband loved this recipe and I thought it was fair - not quite enough flavor me (although the bites that had a good bit of the butter-sugar topping were delicious).  The raisins were definitely a highlight of this recipe and next time I'll throw even more in.

I love squash, but I hate candied squash. This was the perfect recipe for a savory meal! The only changes I made were: I used vegetarian chicken stock, honey instead of brown sugar, craisins instead of raisins (that's what I had), and added a sprinkle of cinnemon and a sprinkle of turmeric.   It is so satisfying! It is the centerpiece of the meal. I served it with a side salad, and we're stuffed and happy.   Thank you for a great recipe! It will be a staple.

Really tasty but I made some changes based on reviews. I added ginger and cinnamon. I baked the squash at 375 for 30 minutes instead of 350. Oh and I added some red onion too.

I loved the flavor of this.  I was surprised how well the brown sugar and cumin worked together.  I ended up having to cook the squash about 45 minutes, but mine might have been a bit larger than those the creator used.  I did make one change: I substituted chopped dates for the raisins since I'm not a huge raisin fan.  It worked out really well.  I'll definitely be making this one again!!!

Disappointing! I found this dish very bland, and it didn't taste remotely Moroccan. I should have been tipped off by the fact there was only one spice.

Yummmmmy!  I halved the recipe since I only had one squash.  I think there's a bit too much cumin for my taste, so next time, I'll use less.  I added some chopped almonds for some crunch...yum!

Loved this recipe! I did make a couple of changes to accomodate personal preference. I dislike celery and raisins. I replaced them with apple and cranberries. I also cut the cumin in 1/2, added a dash of cinnamon and a smidge of ginger. These changes turned it into the perfect autumn dish!! I think next time I might replace the garbanzo beans with grilled chicken.

I used apricots instead of raisins.  I didn't mind that it made extra stuffing,  because the stuffing can hold its own.  Really good.

This was a wonderful recipe that even my kids liked.  I doubled the recipe and made two substitutions: I used golden raisins instead of regular ones, and I chopped three apples in place of the celery.  It was a huge hit!

This was the first time I'd had acorn squash and I wasn't disappointed.  I omitted the butter/brown sugar since we don't eat dairy and I also used chopped apple instead of celery since I didn't have any on hand.  I added extra garlic and cumin and used whole wheat couscous. A good base recipe- I think next time I'll add some toasted almond slices, maybe some shredded chicken too.

Amazing - I usually use squash for soups, but took a chance on this recipe; didn't regret it, and it will become a fall favorite from now on; used apple instead of celery - worked fine.

Very good! The sweetness from the brown sugar really complimented the couscous mixture. I forgot to buy raisins, but I bet they are awesome in this. My fiance raved about this dish. Thanks! :)

I LOVE this couscous!  I think it could have used more salt than I used though.  But it was very very good nonetheless!  The presentation is great - it looks sooo yummy on the plate!  I actually like having more couscous than can fit in the squash so i can have it overflowing around it.  I'm definitely making this again!

So good! Made this once as specified (except without garbanzos, didn't have any) and DH liked the stuffing so much that now I make it without the squash as a side dish.

Really good stuff.  I hate the texture of garbanzo beans so I added pine nuts instead and the family and neighbors declared it a success.  They would have declared it a success with the garbanzo beans too.

I have made this recipe twice now and just love it.   My 18 year old daughter was hesitant try it at first but ended up loving it.  I omitted raisins and used peas and other vege's.  I've also tried the flavored couscous for an extra kick!

I'm not sure what it was...but this was just okay.  The filling just tasted like couscous and cumin - nothing else. And it was a strange combo with the sweetness of the squash/butter/brown sugar. Not the best way to eat acron squash, but worth a try if you love the taste of cumin.

Delicious change from our usual brown sugar and butter squash.  I didn't have couscous so I used some quinoa I had precooked and in the freezer.  I just omitted the chicken broth and only kept it on the stove long enough to warm through.  My family loved it (they're easy) but my finicky niece did as well--  That's impressive!

This is a lot of fun to make with all the interesting colors and flavors!  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and one sliced apple as suggested in the reviews.  I used veg broth and went without the celery.  My boyfriend and I both loved it, but it came out a tad too sweet.  Next time I'll try to decrease the sweet and increase the savory.  A fun fall recipe!

Delicious, and very easy to make. Great for a mixed vegetarian - nonvegetarian family like mine. Used veggie broth, and used chopped onion instead of the celery, as my husband threw the celery out just before dinner. Tasted wonderful on a cold night. Thanks for the great recipe!

This isn't a bad start, but it is definitely missing something.  It was a bit bland.  Maybe a few more spices next time.

I think this recipe is amazing!  The flavors go great with acorn squash.  I left out the raisins and added some curry powder and cayenne pepper for a little extra kick.  Made this for Thanksgiving one year, and everyone enjoyed it.  This is a very impressive dish that is relatively easy to make.

This was pretty good. I had to substitute quite a few things because i didn't have them, for example i put onion in for the celery, dried apricots for the raisons and curry for the cumin. then i added apple juice with the broth instead of brown sugar to sweeten it up a bit more. i also found i had to cook the squash for longer than the 30 min. it said, i cooked it almost a full hour. otherwise delicious!

This was very good. I changed mine up a bit... I didnt have garbanzos or raisins so I left them out. I added corn, soy beans, red pepper, and little pearl onions. After the squash was stuffed I sprinkled with sesame seeds and drizzled with a little sesame oil. Delicious!

This was great! The salty stuffing mixture with the sweet squash was the perfect combination. My squash disliking husband seemed to really like it and agreed to have it again in a month or so, so that's good. I didn't have any carrots, so I added zucchini and I wanted a little more protien besides the chick peas, so I added cubed firm tofu. It was great. The tofu soaked up the broth flavor (which was veggie broth) and really popped! Thanks for a great fall recipe - it's goin' in the box!

What a delicious meatless and healthfull recipe! I substituted bulghar wheat for couscous as I was out of couscous-- great still! I believe this recipe could be altered with different beans( even green peas), different veggies and still shine--thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good.  I didn't much like the bean filling, though -- it was not as sweet as I was expecting, even though I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg.  I substituted applesauce for the butter, and left out the couscous and broth.  I also used zucchini instead of celery, and canola oil cooking spray instead of oil.  I would recommend NOT removing the oil, though, or because the beans got really dry while cooking and I ended up throwing in some more applesauce at the end.  I really loved the glazed squash.  Yum!  Filling and tasty and healthy!

Yum!  One of my fave recipes.  Great blend of flavors and goes well with chicken if you need that protein boost.

This had a great flavor and was pretty quick and easy. I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.

This was delicious. I'm not a huge fan of cumin unless it's mixed with other spices, so I thought this might be a bit much, but it was great. I had some leftover butternut squash from Thanksgiving, so I used that. I don't like cooked celery or carrot, so I used red bell peppers and baby bella mushrooms instead--yum! Plus, I used pure maple syrup instead of brown sugar and butter, and I subbed veg broth for chicken. This was so easy to prepare--I made the stuffing while the squash was baking, and both were ready at the same time.

This is becoming one of my favorite recipes and perfect for sharing with vegetarian or vegan friends.  I recommend adding salt at the table, as the squash really soaks up seasonings.  Another way to do this (minus the attractive presentation but also some of the inconvenience) would be to roast cubed butternut squash that's been glazed in brown sugar and butter (and I add cinnamon).  Then it could be served to a large group of people as well.

This recipe is perfect for fall and its healthy! I sliced, peeled, then cut  the squash into chunks to make it easier to control serving portions (I wouldn't recommend doing this if you're short on time or patience). I diced a medium onion and sauteed it with the garlic. Someone suggested sprinkling cinnamon on the squash before serving, and I followed their tip.

Very good.  I'll cut down on the cumin a bit next time though.

I very much like squash and used acorn squash in this, but found the recipe so/so. I did not have couscous and so used 1/4 orzo to add a little body so perhaps that made a big difference. I like the filling though but felt the whole dish was (amazingly) lacking flavor. I may try again with more spices.

This dish was delicious.  The hubby especially loved it and he's not a big fan of squash.  He loved the variety of flavors.  Excellent!

Yum.  Might add diced, cooked chicken to this for a heftier meal.  But also like the veggie version.

This recipe was wonderful.  I used a little more vegtables than the actual recipe calls for.  This is also a very easy recipe to add extra spices to.

Really enjoyed this. Used Garlic cous cous and added all the other spices in the recipe. Enjoyed it more the next day without the squash and with pita and Hummus.
