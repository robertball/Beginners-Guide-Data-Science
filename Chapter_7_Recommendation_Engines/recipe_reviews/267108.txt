These turned out excellent! I made fried pickles in my air fryer using pickle slices  when I first got it and was unimpressed. To get the brown you'd expect, it totally dried out the juice in the pickle sliced. Using pickle spears is genius! I made these exactly as written and they turned out perfect. They had just the right amount of crunch and juice you expect from a fried pickle but without the "fry". I had a jar of regular spears opened in the fridge with only two spears left and decided to throw them in the mix. For all of you non spicy fans, they turned out great too and had plenty of flavor. This is 5 stars all the way. Thanks for sharing bd.weld!

These were very good, two things I would adjust. Give the panko crumbs a couple of spins in a food processor to make them a bit finer, theyâ€™ll coat the pickles better. And I added Cajun seasoning instead of paprika to the flour.

Love these. I usually tweak recipes, did nothing to tweak and these are awesome. Dip in ranch!
