Quite delicious! The fresh thyme is essential. We also made a few changes. First we used our favorite Merlot instead of Port Wine which was still fabulous. We also marinated the steaks in a mixture of Merlot, Worcestershire, Mustard and some spices. Even though we made it for 2, we used the entire sauce recipe. We also used high quality Gorgonzola cheese since we prefer this. For those of you not used to cooking steaks in the oven, remember when you're searing you aren't cooking the steak. Just sear it until the color is brown, otherwise you'll have grey steak from the oven. Also, we have a gas oven that cooks a bit high so we reduced the cooking time of the steaks to 10 minutes and 3 minutes in the broiler. We used a NY Strip and a Ribeye and they tasted wonderful. It's also important to let the steaks rest after the oven so the juices redistribute so don't forget this part. We mashed red skin potatoes and added 1 tbs of the gorgonzola cheese and 1 tbs of heavy cream (you can sub milk) for the right consistency. We also served with asparagus that we grilled on our foreman.

This was fabulous.  The end result was as good as anything we have had in a 5 star restaurant.  

I made them exactly as the recipe stated (using Gorgonzola Blue Cheese).  Although, I only made 2 filets and didn't change the amount of the sauce, there was plenty that way.

I was concerned about them cooking too much, so I quickly seared them, then baked them for 10 minutes.  I broiled them (not too close to the heat, the cheese will burn) for 4 minutes.  Then I turned off the oven and put them on the bottom rack for one minute.  We like our steak on the rarer side, so that extra minute was not needed.  The steaks were still pink in the middle, but could have been cooked just a little less.

I served this with the Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes (submitted by Kathleen Burton) that I modified a bit (see my review), a caeser salad, and a bottle of Stag's Leap 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon.

The meal was to die for...

Absolutely amazing.  I used rib eye steaks instead of filet, but I followed the cooking time suggested and they came out perfectly.  My husband could not stop saying how good they were.  To save on dishwashing, I just broiled the steaks right in the cast iron skillet instead of transferring them to a baking sheet--it worked great.  I served the steaks with a green salad (topped with orange sections, cranberries, toasted pecans and a light vinaigrette), a shitake mushroom risotto and sourdough bread.  The best meal we've had in a long time!

Oh. My. God.

This was fantastic! One of the best entrees I've ever made--and that's saying a lot.

I made the recipe exactly as it said, except instead of filet mignon, I found beef tenderloins (2" thick) at Sam's Club.

The instructions were perfect! What a lovely entree for Valentine's Day. Thank you!!!

I served it accompanied by sauteed fresh sliced button mushrooms. Yum!

While I've seen others had success with "regular" breadcrumbs, I'm glad I used panko. Mixed with the crumbled blue cheese -- inspired! The fresh thyme was wonderful, plus I used fresh (not jarred) garlic.

I'll make this again, especially for company. Though I'm not sure I'd do the port wine sauce. The meat as otherwise prepared didn't seem to need it. However, if you do use it, boil it down until the liquid is almost all gone.

This was as good or better as any fine restaurant's steak entree! And so easy.

Very impressive. I'm sure you and anyone you serve this to will go nuts!

This was phenomenal and easy to do.  The flavor is not too strong and it compliments the steak so well.  I made my own "panko" crumbs by just running some white bread through the grater on the food processor and drying in the oven for a few minutes.  Much better than the crispy, canned kind.

Wonderful recipe.  We cooked them on the grill & then brought in and put just blue cheese on them & put under broiler.  I did use a strainer to separate the actual sauce from the thyme.

Pretty tasty! I need to work on my "filet minion cooking skills" but everything that actually went INTO the recipe was FANTASTIC! If you are experienced in cooking filet (like I was not) then you should DEFINITELY try this recipe. I served it with the Garlic Broccoli with Cashews recipe also found on allrecipes.com

This recipe was a hit!  I would recommend sticking with the posted cooking times to achieve medium on steaks that are over 1.5 inches thick.  The only change I made (and loved) was to use 1/2 c. of shallots in the sauce instead of white onion!  Thank you HebeGebe for a great recipe!

Did this recipe yesterday for Christmas dinner. My husband hated it - he said his filet was okay but the sauce was absolutely horrible. We ended up throwing it away.

I seared in a cast iron skillet for 1 1/2 min. each side.  Borrowing from Alton Brown I then put the skillet in a 500 degree oven for about eight minutes.  They measured 130 when I took them out.  After resting for about 10 min. they were a little more than medium rare I think and that bothered me but they were still very tender.  I made the port reduction the day before.  That and the bleu cheese-panko topping really made this dish special.  I suspect the port sauce profits from sitting a day in the fridge like mine did.  The flavors were wonderful.

I made this steak for a dinner party, and all my guests would say is "Wow"!  One guest commented that it was the best steak he had ever tasted!  If you are looking for the panko bread crumbs, they are in the Asian section of the grocery store.  Delicious!!!!  5 million stars!

I used this recipe last year for the first time and have used it twice since then.  If you have the time, and you are on top of the cooking time for the steak, this recipe can't be beat.  It is absolutley amazing and my girlfriend loved it.  Serve it with a side of asparagus and maybe a spinach and strawberry salad to start off.

The recipe as written is ok, so I made some changes the second time around.  I seasoned the steaks with fresh black pepper, sea salt, & garlic powder and then seared them in a fry pan. I then transferred them to a cookie sheet to bake.  While it was baking, I made the sauce using the same pan to use all the browned bits.  I thought the sauce as written was a bit watery in consistency and flavor, even after reducing by half. I didn't care for the onion pieces in it either.  So instead of adding minced onion to the sauce, I cut them into strips, caramelized them separately and topped the beef with it just before serving.  For the sauce, I used about 2 cups port, 1 cube beef boullion, and 3 cloves garlic.  I simmered until reduced to about 1/4 C, and then, at the end, added about 1/2 tsp corn starch mixed with little water to thicken the sauce a little more.  The result was a more intensely flavored sauce with a consistency that coated the meat better.  Next time, I'll season the beef with the thyme instead of adding it to the sauce, as I preferred it completely smooth.  When I made the cheese topping the first try, I made my own breadcrumbs using a slice of whole wheat bread.  The second time I made this, I omitted the cheese and bread, and I didn't miss them at all.

After the rave reviews, and as much as I like blue cheese, I couldn't wait to try this recipe. I was dissapointed though. I am giving it three stars cause in all fairness my boyfriend like it and we could finish it. I didn't care for the sauce. The blue cheese on the steak was good but not spectacular. I cooked the steak following the recipe and it was overcooked for our taste and we are not rare meat eaters. I would have prefer a little pinkness in the middle. If I ever try this again, I will cook it only for 10 minutes or so as almost 20 minutes (searing,oven and broiler time) is too much for filet mignon to start with anyway.

This recipe was very very good and I will definitely make it again, but I knocked off a star because the sauce was just a TAD too sweet for me because of the port.  I will use red wine next time, I think.  But I will definitely make it again, very easy.

My modifications:  I used veal stock instead of beef stock, and since we prefer our steaks medium rare, I cooked them in the oven for 9 minutes before removing them to broil.  They came out perfect!

I used feta cheese instead since we don't like blue cheese and this recipe was just fantastic. The sauce was really easy to make and just made the meal so tasty. I also made a non-beef version for myself since I don't eat red meat. I used chicken broth instead of beef broth and put the sauce over chicken. Served it with roasted asparagus and a Creamy Corn Casserole - wow, what a hit!!!!

I followed the original recipe, and it exceeded my expectations. A wonderful blend of flavors, the sauce was rich and hearty. Reminded me of a meal you'd get at a five star restaurant!

This was delicious!! Two things about the sauce: I really think it's NECEssary to use Port Wine - I had never tried it before, but I found out that it's a really surprisingly sweet wine.. different from any other red wine i've tried - I think that has a lot to do with the flavor of the sauce (and why a lot of people are saying it's too "winey" - it's not when you use Port!)  The other thing is to make sure that you let it reduce enough.  I let it simmer for at least 15 minutes..and it was truly delicious!  The only thing I ended up changing about the recipe was that I used shallots instead of onions (not a big deal).  My husband and my in-laws LOVED this!! I'll definitely be making it again :)

Incredible filet recipe - easy and very elegant. In my opinion, THE best steak recipe ever, but my "grilled-steak without sauce" purist husband was not quite as enthuastic.  I'm a pretty experienced cook but this was my first exposure to pankow bread crumbs (which, it turns out, are Japanese) and I had to find a specialty deli shop that carried them.  FYI,they are quite different from regular bread crumbs - more like flakes.  I did not like the port wine sauce as written, and there wasn't much of it.  I played with doubling the beef broth and port wine which worked well, but I'm not sure that the sauce actually improves the fabulous steak anyway.

O-M-G!!! This was DELICIOUS! I absolutely loved this as did son. Hubby isn't a bleu cheese fan, next time I will use Feta Cheese for him. This is a winner and I am sure that we will make this again and often. Talk about easy but tastes like a big time restaurant dish! Thanks for the post!!

Wonderful recipe! The sauce was perfect, and the blue cheese & bread crumb mixture added a nice mellow tang to compliment the sweetness of the port, and bring in a nice texture. Out of personal preference I used Stilton instead of blue. I normally like my steaks rare, but in this case medium rare is best; it allows the flavor of the meat to come out from behind the sauce and cheese. I served this with garlic mashed potatoes (recipe submitted by austad) and yellow & zucchini squash sautéed with butter and vermouth. Perfect!

Made this for my husband on Valentines Day.  I had never cooked steak in the oven before, only on the grill, so I was skeptical.  However, it turned out amazing.  My husband said it was the best meal he had ever eaten including fine dining experiences. Awesome!

Excellent. I only had enough blue cheese for 1 steak and used goat for the other. My husband liked it with the blue but LOVED it with the goat cheese. Said the blue had too much of a bite with the sauce. The sauce was excellent. I didn't have garlic (used it up at lunch time) but was good without it. This is "a keeper."

I made this for an early Valentine's Day dinner for my fiance and I.  Steak would not be her first choice of meat but she was in awe of this recipe!!  I love steak and pasta with either bleu cheese or gargonzola cheese sauce and some red peppers, so this dish fit right in with my liking!!  I cooked them a little bit longer (20 min) at 375, because she does not like any pink.  I took mine out at 15 minutes because i do prefer some pink in mine.  

The only other thing I did differently was when I seared them in the pan before going into the oven, I used basil, oregano, along with the thyme.  This gave it a little more flavor, just the way I like it!  

EXCELLENT RECIPE!  Thanks to the creator and I will be making this again shortly for my parents and in-laws.....they'll love it!

Wow!  What a wonderful recipe.  I used ribeyes, and added some pico de gallo along with the blue cheese.  I don't usually like port wine sauses, but this was fabulous!  Wish I could give it more stars!

This are absolutely excellent and would really impress a crowd!  For those inexperienced with cooking steaks in the oven, I definitely recommend the cast iron skillet straight into the oven...works great!!!  Also use a meat thermometer for perfectly cooked filets every time!!  I disagree that there is effort with this though.  It's really very easy.  Don't let that scare you off.

Made this for NYE dinner and everyone RAVED!  Used 8oz. filets, didn't have port so used merlot instead, and added mushrooms to the sauce.  Otherwise, everything was the same.  Adjusted oven time by 3 mins., and turned out perfectly pink and juicy.  Will make again and again.  Better than a fine steak house.

These were great! The filets were perfectly tender (we like them medium rare) and you could literally cut them with a butter knife. The flavor of the blue cheese added just a hint of tanginess that was not at all overwhelming. The port wine sauce was also great, although it did not end up making much- this was fine for us, as we didn't need much, but if you like a lot of sauce you may want to make more. Excellent, luxurious, and a great meal!

This was one of the best steak recipes I have ever used. The directions were clear and the steps were easy and most importantly- it tasted wonderful! I served it with baked potatoes/sweetpotatoes/onion/carrot's ( a recipe featured on all recipes under suggested sides) and with asparagus. Fabulouso!

I thought this was good, but my husband thought the blue cheese was too overpowering. I used merlot instead of port because that's what I had at home. The sauce wasn't as saucy as I would have liked (it was more chunky from the onions and garlic) but it had a nice taste. I would also lessen the cooking time a bit because our meat turned out medium well (almost well done) and we prefer it to be medium.

My fiance and I made this for both sets of parents for Valentine's Day. It was wonderful! Everyone raved about it. We made it exactly per the recipe. The only thing we would have done is reduce the sauce a little less...since we made it for 6 people, we would have liked a little more than the 1/2 cup that the sauce was reduced to. The flavor was fantastic and the meat so tender you could cut it with a butter knife. The blue cheese and port flavors mixed wonderfully together. We served it with scalloped potatoes. A perfect dinner worth the work!

Holy cow!!!  This is one of the most amazing combinations of flavors I have ever had.  My boyfriend always asks for this, and if I don't feel like cutting onions to make the sauce, he will cut them for me because he loves it so much.  If you don't like blue cheese then at least try this with gorgonzola-which I actually prefer. I also sear the meat (tenderloin or sirloin filets) and then use the broiler to cook it instead of the regular oven setting..  I would guess I do about 10 minutes per side (we like our meat brown). Try this recipe because you will not be disappointed with these flavors.

I give four stars with an asterisks. I dont know how people could cook meat in the oven with straight salt and pepper....bland bluh. I did however, go salt and pepper and cook rib eye on the grill. I topped steak after one flip with a light layer of grey poupon and the bleu cheese crust. AWESOME. I do have to note the cut I tried in the oven was a club tenderloin...a poor mans filet if you will. Nonetheless, it was not good at all...go figure

Great meal!  Port wine sauce is a great contrast with the sharp blue cheese flavor. 
I served it with roasted new potatoes and chicken broth braised bok choi. Big hit!

Followed recipe exactly as written. This was the best filet ever! Even if you don't like blue cheese that much, it's not overwhelming at all. DO yourself a favor and try this! It's superb! I have made this twice now and you really don't even need step one or any of those ingredients. It would be perfect without the port wine onion mix. The bread crumbs and blue cheese is all you really need.

Made this last night for the boyfriend's birthday.  It was amazing!  Roasting the filet made it unbelievably tender.  The boyfriend said that he thought it was just as good if not better than what he has gotten at our local steakhouse.  Next time I will double the sauce.  It was delicious & we wanted more for the mashed potatoes that I served it with.

Awesome! Only thing I changed was the meat cut. Shoulder Tender Medallions were excellent for this and fit better in my family budget. I no longer have a reason to visit a steak house unless I want to pay 10x as much just to be waited on. Super easy.

Wow! This was absolutely delicious! I did tweak this recipe just a little and it turned out scrumptious.  Our grocery store was out of Filet mignon, so I used a t-bone steak. We don't drink, so I substituted the port wine with 100% grape juice. I also used a regular red onion instead of minced white... which had good flavor. When the sauce was done cooking - I strained the pieces out of it and set it aside.  I cooked my steak on the stove top, and it turned out great. Also, I didn't have any panko bread, so I google searched a recipe and made my own! The blue cheese and panko mixture was a nice compliment to the sauce. I made whipped potatoes with sour cream, butter, some reg salt and garlic salt. I used the sauce to cover the steak and potatoes. I topped the meal off with a side of glazed baby carrots. My husband and I both agreed, this meal was much better than most steak houses!  It was a perfect valentines dinner - for 2 :) 
I would highly recommend this meal to anyone, especially if you are looking to impress people!

I have been making this recipe for 2 years and finally got around to reviewing.  This is nothing short of INCREDIBLE!  No changes are needed to the original recipe.  Follow it to the T and you will have a meal worthy of any high end restaurant. I always double the sauce so there is extra to put on mashed potatos.  YUM!

I have made this a few times.  My only suggestion is take your time making the port wine reduction.  Last night I sauted the onions longer and reduced to a little less than the recipe.  It was amazing.  Great recipe!

Made this for my hubby's birthday. We usually go to an upscale steak house for his birthday. He said this was as good if not better than a $50 steak there. Followed the recipe exactly.  Highly recommend the use of a digital meat thermometer....cooked them just perfectly medium rare with that.  I used a cast iron grill skillet(it has raised ridges on the inside bottom) and seared them and then just put the whole skillet in the oven. Got gorgeous grill lines on the steaks! And is much easier to clean.  Served with the garlic mashed potatoes as recommended and it was a wonderful meal.

Absolutely wonderful! I will definitely make this again! Everyone who was over loved it!! The sauce was really good too. The only thing was I had to increase the time a little longer than 10 minutes *probably like 13 or 14 in my oven* and it came out beautifully! Served with homemade mashed potatoes that I threw some parm cheese in them and also served with a side of asparagus. Yummmmmm so good :)

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I simply topped our fillet with bleu cheese.  The recommendation on the cooking process is spot on.  Quality of meat is important, of course, but this was as good as Morton's any day of the week!

Wow. Just wow. As others have said, I felt like I'd made something of restaurant-caliber. Perfect as is; not a single tweak necessary.

The sauce is just wonderful. To those of you who didn't like the sauce, you must have been using inexpensive port. It is usually very sweet because it is not aged. I used a tawny port which made a rich sauce that only enhanced the flavour of the meat. I really think the type of port you use will affect the taste- it really shouldn't take away from the beef (like many of you have suggested). I agree that filet mignon doesn't need this much fuss, so I used ny strip instead. I didn't really make any modifications other than using finely chopped shallots instead of white onion and I used 1/2c of Stilton instead of 3/4c- A little goes a long way!

Fabulous!  I made two changes.  We are not big on Port, so opening a bottle for just two of us was not an option.  I substituted Merlot and it tasted great.  Also, I did not use the bread crumbs.  I add a tbsp of butter to the bleu cheese to hold it together.  We will eat this again and again!

I don't own a pan that can go from stove top to oven, so I pan fried my steaks in a little butter and olive oil to the desired wellness, then transferred them to a broiler pan, topped with the bleu cheese mixture and broiled for 10 minutes.  Used a cabernet/merlot mixture for the wine sauce.  This recipe is absolutely awesome and as good as any steak I've had at a restaurant.  Will definitely being making this again.

This is an excellent recipe.  Everyone loved it.  I did make a few changes.  I used shallots instead of onions and a merlot instead of port wine.  Also sauteed some baby portabellos with the shallots. Everyone loved it. Definitely a keeper.  Thanks

Made this for Valentine's Day.  The wine sauce was okay, but not really worth the extra ingredients and work.  The topping was good...except that I think that the extra time to melt the cheese ended up cooking the filet over.  Definately reduce the cooking time in the beginning because the extra couple of broiling minutes will turn what could be a wonderful filet into an overcooked slab of meat.  Will try again with modifications and less cook time.  Also, I'd wrap the filet in bacon, because it didn't seem like filet without that extra touch...

I made this recipe for Valentine's Day and it was sooooo delicious! The port wine sauce is heavenly! My boyfriend who is a very picky eater said that this was by far the best recipe that I have made ever. I will definately make this again.

After making some changes due to limited ingredients on hand (sirloin instead of filet, merlot in lieu of port, dried thyme instead of fresh), the flavor was outstanding.  I love blue cheese on steaks, but wasn't quite sure about the texture of the panko/blue mixture. Maybe because I'm used to a more "saucy" cheese sauce and this seemed more "bready". [watch me invent words ;o) ]  I'd easily make this again, but use my old standby:
Heat 1/2 cup heavy cream in a small saucepan. Add 3 oz of Roquefort cheese (or a moist bleu cheese) as soon as the cream nears boiling and keep stirring in on a medium-high heat. The sauce has to cook for about 5 minutes to reduce nicely. You should end up with a sauce with the consistency of very thick cream. Add a little fresh pepper and chopped parsley for some color.

Ok, I'll stop now. ;o)

This is awesome!!!  I've made it several times using port for a sweet sauce, and merlot if I want a less sweet sauce.  Just be sure to strain the sauce before serving for a pretty presentation.

Wonderful. Admittedly I did not follow the entire recipe but just the bones. I am allergic to onions so that was out. We didn't have blue cheese so I used fresh Parma/Reg and the sauce burnt so I ommited that completely.  The meat was wonderful and the topping rocked! I wish I could have followed 100% but it was perfect anyway!!

Wow. This was absolutely delicious and very easy. I made it for my boyfriend for Valentine's day (he LOVES blue cheese). I used a 1-pound New York Strip. After searing in my iron skillet, I baked for 10 minutes and broiled the topping for 3 minutes, which was close to perfect for medium-rare. I left it in the skillet for all three phases, which worked great. While the meat was resting for 15 minutes I broiled the asparagus in olive oil and lemon pepper, which was perfect timing. A starter of shrimp cocktail, spring mix with slivered almonds, craisins and sweet grape tomatoes in a white wine vinaigrette, and garlic mashed potatoes rounded out the meal, paired with a lovely French Bordeaux,  and "chocolate bar fondue" finished it off. Delicious. I'll definitely do this again.

Wow!  Just wow!  Followed the recipe exactly except no bread crumbs. Didn't have them onhand so left them out. Otherwise followed it to the "T." Loved the way the flavors of the blue cheese & port wine played off eachother. This is an instant favorite. Inexpressably stellar.

I was not impressed with this recipe. My advice would be to save the blue cheese for a starter salad, grill your steak, and have a glass of port.

Amazing recipe. I have made this twice now for my fiance and I. The most recent I made with London Broil (cheap jr high teacher), which still turned out amazing. The dish was accompanied by slightly mashed potatoes and broccoli. This is a great recipe to make for a special holiday or occasion with just you and someone you love.

This is so delicious.  I followed the directions very closely except it was dinner for two but made the entire sauce.  It was delicious and looked fabulous.  It actually looked like the picture (which is not always the case).  Changes I made were to use slight more panko and less blue cheese since I'm not a huge blue cheese on steak fan and I only used 1 garlic clove and I used a mortar and pestle to liquify it because I hate pieces of garlic.  My boyfriend who is not a blue cheese fan said it was delicious and not overpowered by the cheese.  It really does taste and look like a steakhouse meal.

My husband made this for my birthday. It was very good, though the wine sauce was a bit salty for my taste.

This recipe was my very first attempt at making filet mignon and what a hit! I suprised myself by how well they turned out. The panko crumbs/blue cheese mixture was perfect.  I wouldn't change anything about this recipe. Can't wait to make this again!

Wonderful!
All I had on hand was Merlot, but other than that I made right by the recipe. Will definitely be using this recipe again.

Made this for Valentine's day- not to difficult to make even for me who is not great at making steak. The only change I would make is adding more beef broth and port. It says to reduce it until half cup but just the onions take up half cup and I liked having more sauce to pour over the steak. I served it as pictured over creamy red mashed potatoes, perfect!

i made this for our valentines dinner and my wife who just likes plain steak with nothing on it raved about this recipe. the only change i made was not putting the steaks on a cookie sheet and just used the oven safe pan for the broiling. less dishes that way. there was one special treat about this recipe...all the topping that melts off the steak makes a great crispy grilled cheese when it hits the pan. mmmmm!!!

This recipe was incredible. I'd never made Filet Mignon before and was a little nervous because I've heard how finicky it can be to cook. I followed this recipe exactly as it was stated (used a meat thermometer to check for the doneness rather than using the timer) and it came out just perfect. The meat was so tender I probably could've cut through it with a butter knife. I paired this with garlic mashed potatoes and parmesan asparagus and it made for the best Valentine's dinner I've ever made (or had for that matter).

Made this for Valentines Day and it was so easy and Delicious! Everyone loved it. The wine sauce was especially good, I ended up adding some gorgonzola to the sauce at the end- you have to try it! I layered the steaks with the port wine sauce and then added the cheese and breadcrumb mixture and broiled. So good!

Excellent and rather easy... varied the recipe slightly due to time and either way this is a sure winner.  Was made on Valentine's Day as a symbol of love for my husband... He certainly knew what I was trying to tell him with this recipe.  I'd recommend it any day to anyone!

Easy recipe. I didn't have port wine on hand so I used merlot and it was still excellent. I made these for my family and expected my youngest stepson to object to the blue cheese/panko mix, but was happily surprised to see that he ate the whole thing (including the panko/blue cheese mix). The whole family gave it rave reviews.

I made this for a dinner get together and everyone was so impressed. I love a fancy dinner that looks hard but was so easy.  I grilled the steaks then broiled the blue cheese mixture.  the sauce is delicious.!  I served it with petite carrots for color. perfect thank you for this recipe. a keeper.

This recipe rocks!! I made this for my boyfriends birthday and We both keep saying a week later how we are craving it again!!  I did use gorganzola cheese instead of Blue cheese, that's the only change I made. other than that I stuck to the recipe,  I would most definately recommend this recipe.  The three flavors just bursts in your mouth! YUMI!!

great recipe!!...made for valentines day and the wife loved it....the sauce and toppings are great and really make the steak...I went with a shiraz and not the port, as port is a little to sweet for me....served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes....and roasted parmesan green beans....this is definately a keeper....only other change was I had my oven turned up to 400

So unbelievably good!!  I actually have never made this, though.  My husband makes it for us every Valentine's Day.  We get really good quality steaks from our local butcher for a fraction of the cost we'd pay at a big retail store.  This recipe has always been great and will continue to be a tradition of ours for years to come!

made this recipe recently. It flavor of the filet mignon was incredible and blue cheese and bread crumbs add a nice flavor to the meat. I got a little confuse on the sause in the beginning but i just put the sauce in with the meat when i broiled the filet mignon.

What a disappointment.  As someone else stated, filet mignon doesn't need all this  on it.  I had to find out the hard way.  The blue cheese crust gave it a slightly salty taste IMO.  I've made blue cheese sauce before that was excellent, but this was just overpowering.  It needed to be blended with something else like creme or pan juices before going on the steak to mellow out the flavor.  The sauce reminded me of Salisbury steak.  It did nothing but disguise the flavor of the meat, and why would you want to do that with a cut like filet mignon?  The meat should be the main flavor and anything else should be subtle.  This, however, was not subtle and didn't taste like anything special for all the work involved in making it. Save all the fancy flavorings for a cheap cut of meat that actually needs it.

Although I am not a fan of bleu cheese in general, this dish is amazing. Not only was it tasty but quite easy to make. Talk about easy gourmet! Next time I make it I will tray gorganzola cheese or maybe even brie for a different flavor.  Also, since I would try it without letting the sauce reduce down as much. Fantastic!

I paid $49 for a steak this good at an upscale restaurant. It is absolutely divine--great, full flavors, nice texture and super juicy. I made it three times with fresh cut Ribeye from my local butcher and this has become my go-to recipe when I want to make something special that everyone loves--whether they are 6 or 60.

Excellent.  I made this for my hubby on Valentines day - only with New York strips and not filet mignon.  In the cast iron frying pan I cooked them about 7 mintues per side for med-rare and then just put the steaks in the cast iron right into the broiler to brown the blue cheese.  Yummy - and so gourmet!

Okay, I'll have to be honest, the blue cheese thing, I dont quite get it, but I in a trial meal, I made this with a 1 1/2" boneless ribeye and I'll tell you what, the best ribeye I have had in a long time, while even cooked in the oven ?.  Something about it just kept me going. Now,  I cant wait for the filet.

This was really impressive. I used Merlot in the sauce,which was fine. I also strained the sauce,didn't want the onion bits etc. on the plate. The bread crunbs with the blue cheese was perfect. The filet was like butter. This was really fine dining!

This is amazing!  I made it last year for Valentine's Day.  It took a little while to prepare, but WELL worth it.  My fiance loved it.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This was one of those meals where I actually impressed myself, I can be my own worst critic!  I prepared the steak exactly as directed, and it turned out super moist, a little more medium than I wanted, so next time I may reduce the baking time by 5 minutes.  I used a good Merlot instead of Port because I was worried about the sweetness and I threw in some sauteed mushrooms, garlic, and shallots...it was fantastic!  The blue cheese topping along with the wine sauce makes this an outstanding impressive dish!

If possible, I would give it more than 5 stars!  It turned out perfectly, despite the fact that no panko bread crumbs were available; I made my own crispy bread crumbs and they worked great.  This is a very special meal for a very speical occasion.

The port wine sauce took a little of the "bite" out of the bleu cheese which was perfect.  I didn't have panko bread crumbs so I used regular ones.  My skillet isn't oven safe so I just wrapped the handle in a couple layers of aluminum foil.  When I put it under the broiler, I kept as much of the handle away from the direct heat as possible and it was fine.  Husband loved it and has asked for it again already and I just made it 2 days ago!

Excellent! Everyone loved it.  I did use red wine instead of Port, but I will try the Port next time.  I will also cut the amount of onions back to 1/4 and throw in some mushroom pieces.  Some of the topping was wasted because it fell off the top of the filet, to prevent this next time I would use parchment paper (wrap it around the outside edge of the steak) to prevent the topping from falling off.

This recipe was awesome. My husband even turned off the football game to enjoy all the flavours. I made this one medium and medium well. Medium  and medium rare would accentuate the flavours of all items, blue cheese, steak, and port wine sauce really well. And it was really quick to make. A very good recipe, awesome served with steamed broccoli with a bit of butter and parmesan cheese.

This was just "okay" for us.  I may try this again by tweaking it some.   We enjoyed it, but  were not wowed by it.  Of course, we've been spoiled by the smothered filet recipe from this site (fantastic!) and so far, I've not found anything that can beat that recipe.

For the sauce, i browned butter to a deep golden brown and added about 1/4 cup minced shallots, about 2 cloves minced garlic and some rosemary.  I used a can of beef consomme (all I had on hand)and just a basic chianti (about 1/2 bottle).  I let it reduce for quite awhile and kept tasting.  So yummy and a beautiful deep purple.  Put sauce in a small dish to pass.  Boyfriend loved it.

I actually used this on a roast.  I had put the roast in the crock pot and made the sauce as the recipe said.  Then I sliced the roast put the blue cheese mixture on and poured the sauce over it reserving some to serve with and cooked it in the oven for 5 minutes.  It was FABULOUS.  I had people for dinner and they went nuts for it.  Thanks for a great recipe that is very versatile.

Fantastic!!!! I will use this recipe again & again! It was so easy to prepare! The only thing I did differently was I strained the port sauce and added a little cornstarch to make it thicker. This does not need to be done I just like it that way! 
My husband does not like blue cheese and even he had seconds (I also caught him in the kitchen at 2 in the morning reheating leftovers!):)
Try this recipe ~ you will not be dissapointed!

I have made this recipie several times now and it is awesome!!!  got rave reviews on Fathers Day.  If you don't like a sweet sauce use a cabernet instead of the port.  I personally prefer a sweeter sauce.  I also strained the sauce so it was nice and smooth.  definately a keeper!! thanks hebegebe

I didn't do the sauce (sorry) but I didn't have the ingredients or time.  But the steaks were great with the bluecheese!  As good as I've had in a major steak house.  I seared it and then cooked in the oven, it happen to be a hot day so I transfered the steaks to the grill for 4 minutes or so on each side then back to the broiler to melt the cheese mixture.  Very yummy.

This was very good but I thought it was a little sweet.  If I make this again I will probably use less onions in the sauce and try to add something to make it a little less sweet.

My boyfriend really liked it!  We both give it a 9 or 9.5 out of ten.  I didn't think the sauce was necessary.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it was work for as much sauce as you got, and it was flavorful, but didn't add to the deliciousness of the steak itself.  Make sure you are using port wine and not just basic red wine.  Port is more of a dessert wine.

Works out perfectly and my guests were delighted (so was I).  One tip is NOT to put the whole frying pan into the oven, but transfer steaks to a high quality cookie sheet or pan before putting in the oven.  Then you can work on the sauce in the frying pan while the steaks cook.

This recipe was ok. I added some wild mushrooms to the sauce for added flavor and it was good, although next time I think I'll skip the sauce entirely. The steaks with the blue cheese topping, all melty and crisp on top, had enough flavor without the sauce. I also used tenderloins as the butcher was out of filets, and they were just as delicious.

holy lord this was delicious. followed recipe exactly, I made the full amount of sauce but only 2 filets. Only thing I changed was I wrapped the filets in thick-cut bacon and secured with toothpicks, and marinated them in a mixture of Burgundy wine, worchestershire, honey, garlic&herb seasoning. I also used gorgonzola not blue cheese.

This review is for the reduction only.  I have to say this just didn’t work for me.  I reduced the broth/wine mixture further than specified in the recipe and still had a very liquidy sauce.  I would have had a better result had I stopped reducing and thickened this a bit with a corn starch/water slurry.  Consequently this just dripped off the steak and onto the plate.  So, I doubt I’ll be doing this one again.

My husband gave this 5 stars, I would give it 3, so we will split the difference and call it 4. It was tasty, but the blue cheese overpowered the beef, and I didn't like the texture of the crumbs.

Restaurant quality recipe. One comment I would make is that I would double the sauce. As shown in the picture, I served it on a "bed" of mashed potatoes. Although, I had sauce it would have been awesome to have more sauce. Also, I used a chunkier blue cheese and didn't broil it, but baked the topping on top of the steak. It was awesome..we had large crumbles of blue cheese to eat with steak. I would use this in entertaining.

Made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day dinner. We both loved it! The blue cheese added an awesome flavor to the perfectly cooked meat. The only thing I changed was the amount of time I had the steaks in the oven. He likes his rare and I like mine pretty red. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the tea. A must try!

I made just the steak.  Seared the steak in a cast iron skillet and then baked in 350 degree oven.  Turned out better than grilling or broiling them, because they were not dried out at all.  My husband likes his well done and his turned out perfectly.

So hubby was worried when he saw that I was putting a steak in the oven instead of grilling it. But have no fear...first bite.."Wow, that's good......that's really good". Never doubt Allrecipies! I made as written, added some sauteed mushrooms. Very expensive dish, but a very nice treat.

This was really good. Husband liked it a lot too even though he is not a fan of blue cheese. My only complaint was that the wine did not add much flavor to the sauce, tasted mainly like the beef broth. I will probably play around with this recipe, but overall really enjoyed it.

I made this for Valentine's Dinner and it turned out amazing.  It's so simple to make and the flavors are incredible.  I definitely recommend making the sauce ahead of time as it's the most time consuming part of this recipe.  I made garlic mashed potatoes and parmesan asparagus to go with it.  I took the advice of doubling the sauce recipe and putting it over the potatoes! My fiance loved this and it will definitely become a regular recipe at our dinner table!

Wow. the blue cheese taste is so subtle with the sauce...this was my first reduction sauce...the recipe should add that you need to strain the onions and herbs out fo the sauce .  It still tasted wonderful!!!

This is an incredible meal. We will be having it as a special treat for Christmas dinner. I recommend serving it with mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms. I have even omitted the fresh herbs and it still works!

Served this for a birthday dinner and everyone loved it. We grilled the fillets on the BBQ and then brought them in to broil them once the cheese/panko mix was added.  Otherwise, we followed the recipe exactly. We are making it again for a group of 12.  Thank you for sharing!

This is a "less is more" recipe. I made the sauce exactly as written (x3 for 10 people), and I suggest a LOT less onion. Once the sauce reduces it became an onion sauce rather than a wine sauce. For the topping, I suggest as small of a crust as you can put, which was just right. I've had this in restaurants with a thick crust and it's MUCH better with a light crust.

This is, hands down, the best restaurant I've found on All Recipes.  The wine sauce is stellar, the bleu cheese excellent, and the filets are amazing.  This is a must make dish for everyone on here.

This was pretty good, but I kinda was looking for something a little more blue cheesy. The wine sauce was not good at all, so i wouldnt bother making it.  But I liked the fillets all the same. Good basic recipe and a good way to bake steak. Thanks.

Made this last night, but with chicken and it was a hit! Instead of putting the blue cheese on top, I stuffed a little inside each burger before grilling & made a sauce out of it by melting it with a little cream and flour to thicken... it was delicious!

I've never liked steak but decided to give this a try. For someone who has never cooked it before, the recipe was easy to follow and I brag to all my friends how good this was.  I wont order steak at a restaurant, but I will cook this at home!  It was so good!

I made this recipe for a “stay-in” Valentine’s Day dinner, and it was so fantastic that we were both convinced that it was better (and cheaper!) than any meal we could bought if we’d gone out to eat. 	Since my husband and I like our meat at the rare end of medium rare, I only cooked the steaks for 14 minutes, and broiled them for 2. They were absolutely perfect – almost but just above bloody. Since the rest of the meal was done (and the baby’s patience was wearing thin) we only let them sit for about 5 minutes, but they were still great.

Being a very amateur cook, I just served this to a dinner party last night who said they had never had such a fancy meal at a friend's house before.  It kinda scared me to cook something like this, but going through it, it was actually quite simple.  It looked beautiful and tasted delicious.  Next time I will make extra port sauce to serve in a bowl at the table, as all wanted extra of the sauce for the meat and for the garlic mash taters I served with it (along wth asparagus).  I only wonder if the meat shouldn't have been marinated in something just to add a little more the meat itself?  Thanks for makin' me look good last night!

Made this for Valentine's Day. Was an instant hit and used the leftover blue cheese mixture on hamburgers the next day.

Made this as a special Valentines Dinner, it was FABULOUS! I didn't change a thing except the cooking time for the filets, 15 minutes in the oven for medium. Will make this more often and not just on special occasions. Thanks!

This was okay.  I did not like the topping, but the sauce was okay.  Overall, I will look for a better recipe next time I want to make filet mignon.

Meh.  I can totally see where this recipe would appeal to and warrant 4 or 5 stars from those not  familiar with cooking a filet.  But, this didn't work for our family.  We eat filet several times a year,  (the kids and hubby request it for birthdays) and I grill it wrapped in bacon, with a "to die for" marinade and serve it with blue cheese, and sauteed mushrooms and onions on the side. Were we not so enamored with that method, this dish might have gotten a better rating from our family.  I won't be making it again.  Sorry.


Edited in 2019.... Well wasn't I just a real snotty reviewer back in the day? I no longer wrap filet in bacon, and have fully embraced the cast iron oven method of  "grilling" all steaks. Still love my marinade, though. Happy cooking one and all!

My husband and I made this for our Valentines Day dinner.  It was fantastic and probably as good if not better than what we could have gotten had we gone out.  We used Gorgonzola instead of blue cheese.  Yum!  The Port Wine sauce was delicious and we'd recommend a good port (you can drink the rest with dessert).  If making for two, you will not want to cut any of the recipe in 1/2 (except for the meat) because the topping and sauce are so good!  Thanks for posting such a great recipe.

I have been getting recipes from this site for years, but this is the first time I have typed out a review.  This recipe is outstanding and worth giving accolades.  My husband had some steaks that he had dry aged so used those, grilled them then added cheese.  The sauce is impressive.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was just TOO MUCH.  Very heavy.  The cheese and the steak together were too fatty to be good.  It gets two stars for the sauce, which I would make again.

Really great recipe! Hubby and I loved it and will likely make it again. For one of the steaks, I finely chopped some leftover sauteed mushrooms, and them added to the cheese/bread crumb mixture. This was a nice addition to the strong flavor of the gorgonzola. Both ways tasted really good. We grilled steaks before adding the topping and broiling.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and his roommate.  They both absolutely loved it.  They said the combination of the Blue Cheese and the Port Wine Sauce was excellent.  It was pretty simple even for a novice in the kitchen like me. I did cook the fillets a little longer because we like ours a little more done.  I also paired this dish with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus.  I would recommend this to everyone.

This is an excellent steak recipe!  I would suggest doubling the sauce if you like extra sauce, I find that I make a good amount when I only cook 2 steaks using this recipe.  Otherwise a fabulous dish, one that I have made many times now.

First of all thanks for this incredible receipe. I used the beef loin tenderloin. I panfryed them slowly over medium heat using EVO and butter. When the steaks were medium well I put the blue cheese and bread crumbs. I placed them in the broiler for 4 min. Awesome sauce for these steaks. We all loved them. My son is a Chef and he was totally impressed.

Incredible!  Served it for Valentine's dinner for hubby and he swooned.  It is tricky to make sure not to overcook with all the different steps.  I cooked two 8 oz filets, about 1 1/2 inch thick.  I took it out of the oven when it reached 130 degrees.  Between popping it back under the broiler to melt the cheese, and letting it rest for 15 minutes (a must!) it continues to cook.  A rule of thumb is to let it cook to about 5 degrees under what you want to compensate for the continued cooking while it rests.  It was perfectly pink and melt in your mouth tender.  Some reviewers wonder why to mess with an expensive cut like tenderloin (filet mignon) it's because while it's the most tender of the cuts of beef, it's not as high on flavor because there is very little marbleling, which is what gives the flavor.  That's why in most restaurants filet mignon is served with some type of sauce, like bernaise.  The port wine suace here was out of this world.  I doubled it, and had very little left.  This is truly a special meal sure to impress your guests.

I made this, with a few changes, and it was fabulous!  I didn't have fresh thyme so had to use dried.  We also grilled the steak, then topped with the cheese mixture and broiled for 3 minutes.  Changed out the port wine with a good cabernet.  Served it with garlic mashed potatoes topped with sauteed mushrroms and whole baby green beans sauteed with bacon.  So much better than going out to eat!

I just fixed this for dinner this evening...my husband gave it 10 stars...The Port wine Sauce alone was to die for.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I cooked bacon wrapped filets on the grill...served it with steamed asparagus, roasted garlic smashed potatoes and a bottle of Twisted Oak Syrah....incredible meal!!!  My husband is in the kitchen doing the dishes as I'm typing this and he's still oooohing and aaaahing over his dinner...
Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!!

This was wonderful!  I don't like blue cheese dressing so I wasn't sure if I would like this but the flavor of the blue cheese combined with the sauce was excellent.  My husband didn't like the sauce however I substituted a red wine we had on hand instead of port just for cost sake.  If I make the sauce again, I will use port.  This will be made in our home again and again.  It would also be a great presentation for dinner guests.

Technically, this should be 4.5 stars.  I was expecting, based on the overwhelming response of everyone else, for this to be OUTSTANDING.  Instead, it was just good  (-My boyfriend would say "REALLY good.")  I'm not sure where the sauce fits in with all this. The flavor seemed to clash with the steaks/cheese and we barely touched it.  We could have saved money (wine) by not making the sauce and we would have been just as happy.  In the unlikely event that I decide to make the sauce again, I would use a Port instead of a Cab (-which I used this time), and I wouldn't use the thyme - the flavor just wasn't good.  Additionally, we only made two filets with the same amount of crumbles.  Using that much crumbles on just two steaks is overpowering - next time we'll tone it back a little.  I think that this is something that we will continue to make, but the recipe as presented needs a little tweaking for our taste.

Fantastic!  We served these for friends over the weekend for dinner along with Mushroom Orzo (from this site) and a nice mixed greens salad...everyone thoroughly enjoyed (Queijadas with fresh fruit for dessert, also from this site)!  I did use rib eyes but think the filets would produce a much nicer dish .  I also opted to use a cabernet/franc red wine instead of the port only becuase I thought it would be a better flavour and port is very sweet.  Regardless, fantastic - would love to try again using filets.

The filet was absolutely wonderful with the blue cheese topping!  The wine sauce was OK. A little on the strong side though.  Probably won't make the sauce again.  Will make the blue cheese crust for sure!

Boy, this was an expensive dinner not to like.  I used rib-eyes and just the meat alone was $30 - plus the port wine and cheese, and sides.  I thought this was just "ok".  I guess we're more of a southern eatin family.  The blue cheese was a nice touch, but not something I'd add to my rib-eyes again.  The port-wine sauce was not what my taste buds were looking for, I didn't care for it all and ended up pushing it off my steak.

Plus, I just didn't care for broiling the steaks, not the flavor I'm use to I guess.

Ah well, point for trying it out but I prefer my steaks grilled with a little seasoning and that's it.

I give this recipe a 5, although I did modify it a bit.  I am not a fan of blue cheese, so instead I simply mixed parmesan cheese with the breadcrumbs and it made a very tasty crispy crust.  I realize that this changes the flavour and consistency - but it was still very good!  I also added mushrooms to sauce because I had some on hand.  I would definately make this again, and I would certainly serve this when expecting guests or for a special occasion.

I made this for my husband for a romantic Valentine's Day dinner. He usually prefers chicken but this was AMAZING! I have tried making filet mignon before and it has never come out as good as a restaurants. This was just as good if not better than a fancy restaurant!! I can't wait to make it again. I had trouble finding Panko breadcrumbs and almost gave up. Glad I found them. They were so tasty with the blue cheese.

These were excellent.  I made them for my family on valentines day.  For me personally blue cheese is not a favourite so I may try with a feta or goat cheese next time, but my hubby loves blue cheese and thought they were fantastic.  This was the first time I "baked" filets.. and they turned out perfect.  I had a "blackberry port" so I used that and the flavour was wonderful.

I used bacon wrapped filets because that's all I could find and I don't think I would do that again (my own fault). The bacon made the meat too salty. My husband loved it though - even with the bacon. Very yummy!

INCREDIBLE!  So yummy and sooo impressive looking(and sounding for that matter).  We added mushrooms to the sauce because it just seemed right with all that wonderful bleu cheese and steak--absolutely wonderful!

This recipe was the perfect meal for a romantic Valentine's Day dinner at home. We couldn't find panko bread crumbs, so we used Italian-seasoned bread crumbs instead. Next time we will add less blue cheese to make the meal less salty. We served the filet with a nice salad, garlic mashed potatoes, and a glass of red wine. Highly recommended!

AMAZING! actually quite an easy recipe. I didn't have any broth on hand, and used water w/ soy sauce (same measurement of water, probably 1.5 teaspoon soy) and it still came out great. My meat got dried out, though, probably because it was such a thick cut and I wasn't sure how long to cook it, but the toppings more than compensated! Will make this over and over, especially to impress company. GOes great with mashed potatoes and sauteed swiss chard, by the way.

This turned out a little more rare than I would have liked.  The port sauce was very rich and smokey.  I will make this again but try to get more medium rare.  Great recipe.

I recently tried this recipe and it has since become a favorite.  The first time I made it, I didnt have any port wine, so I used Merlot and a little balsamic vinegar.  It was delicious.  I have also made it with cabernet and chiante.  It is so easy to make if you just follow the directions.  Absolutely delicious, this is my new standby "special occasion" dish!

Very good, would do again.  Did it as a Valentines day dinner and it was a hit. I used red wine instead of port wine because that is what I had, but next time will try the port wine.

It was just ok - I think it should have called for more blue cheese - we felt that the top was a bit dry even though we topped it off with the sauce.  Not sure I would make this one again although my guy doesn't agree - he would highly recommend it.

This is awesome!  I could never get a steak to come out right, so we always ate out for steak.  I made this (in very little time) and it was delicious!  My husband said it was "perfect, just perfect".  I'll never eat steak out again!

Very good. I used cheddar cheese instead of blue as my husband doesn't like it. The sauce was excellent. Next time I will add a bit more cheese on top.

Superb!  Instead of onions, I used a mixture of leeks and shallots.  I also used merlot, instead of port.  Steaks were seared on the grill first and then placed in the broiler with the blue cheese topping.

This is a wonderful recipe, and not really hard at all.  I have used regular Italian style bread crumbs once, and the panko crumbs and prefer the regular crumbs better.  Am serving this again on New Years Eve.  Thanks for a great keeper.

I made this for my husband on our anniversary.  He gave it 5 stars.  Thought it was very tasty.  I didn't strain the sauce and used dried thyme and threw in some orange pepper and thought it came out wonderfully.  I also added some Romano to the blue cheese and thought that was very yummy.  I personally do not like steak and hate port.  But I think I would have to give this recipe 5 stars myself for making me finish my steak.  :)  Only thing that didn't not turn out the best is I cooked it for to long so it was a little bit more done than medium but the sauce still added plenty of juice.  We saved the leftover sauce to go on chicken later this week.  :)

This recipe was great.  My boyfriend said it was one of the best flavored steaks he's had.  I changed a lot of the ingredients though.  I halved the quantity of thyme and matched it with tarragon.  Instead of blue cheese i used garlic/herb feta and i added some shallots into the sauce.  I didn't have port so i used merlot with two tbs. of powdered sugar.  I highly recommend this recipe.

The blue cheese/panako crumb topping was good but I really didn't care for the sauce that much. I don't know if it was because I used dried thyme instead of fresh but the sauce just didn't look pretty. I think using shallots instead of onions would be better also. My husband liked this better than I did but I doubt I will make it again.

I adapted this to fresh venison cut from tenderloin. I pounded the steaks to about 1in. I salted and peppered them before searing. I cooked to medium which venison benefits from. About 7min. I also added some brined chanterelles and a teaspoon of corn starch dissolved in some of the port to help thicken and provide some gloss. Served over garlic smashed potatoes. Only caution is to get a good brand of bleu. Make crumbles yourself.

This was a home run. Well worth the effort. Served at a dinner party (for 9 people) and everyone said it was the best meal they ever had. I would rank it as good as you’d get at any 5 star restaurant. My husband thought it called for caramelized onions so we ended up adding them on top..  will be making this again and again!

This had superb flavor.  I did things a little different though.  After melting butter I added instant minced onion, chopped garlic and thyme.  Then seared my fillets in the pan.  I removed them before adding the beef broth and port.  After reducing the sauce, I then returned fillets, reduced heat and covered pan to cook for a little while before placing under broiler with the panko and blue cheese.  After resting fillets, I placed on plate and poured the sauce from pan over them.

Just great all around. My meat wound up being over cooked for my taste although I followed the instructions. Usually an overdone steak is a deal breaker for me but the sauce and blue cheese crust were so flavorful and delicious I barely noticed!

What an impressive meal! Panko and blue cheese make such wonderful topping with perfect flavor and texture. I am a sucker for juicy fatty meats, and also, filet mignon looked too $$pricey$$ to me, so I used ribeye steak instead and it came out great! But I do see how this could be even more impressive, sophisticated, and delicious cuisine with filet mignon. Another change was that I used red wine as I did not have port wine on hand and I am also not a big fan of port wine. Again, the wine sauce came out great, but I am definitely curious to see how different it would be with port wine.  I will definitely try the same recipe with filet mignon and port wine for a special occasion next time. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I used Venison backstrap instead of filet mignon & merlot instead of port & I wrapped the filets with bacon. Since I was cooking so much I also increased proportions of the panko/blue cheese mix which I didn't have to since the filets shrank so much. But it was a tasty side & the left over was good on salad.

I accidentally forgot to buy the BLUE CHESSE!  It was Christmas day when I discovered this huge mistake!  Like any cook would do,  I made it anyway without the blue cheese and it was scrumptious!!!!  WHEW!!!  I've made it for Christmas dinner 2 years and will again this year!

Absolutely loved this.  Prepared the delicious sauce in the morning and reduced it quite a bit.  It was super yummies.  Next time I'll cook my steak a little longer as it was a bit rare for my taste but otherwise the filet mignons were absolutely scrumptious!

I followed the directions pretty much exactly.  Though I used Gorgonzola blue cheese. I seared the steaks for 2 minutes per side on high heat in a cast iron pan.  Then put them in the oven for 10 minutes.   After covering with the cheese mixture, I broiled them on high for 4 minutes on a middle rack.  I served them with mashed potatoes, the port wine sauce (after straining), and grilled asparagus.  I will make this again.

This was very, very good.  I made one small change only so that I wouldn't have to run to the grocery store and that was I used Cabernet wine instead of Port cause that's what I had in the house:)   It was outstanding.  I followed everything else by the book....

After reading some of reviews on sauce I was unsure but made it exactly as recipe called. We served sauce on side to try it and everyone loved it! We used tenderloin steaks cut at 1 1/2" cooked on grill for everyone's desired temp. I also used a different recipe for crumb crust! 1/4 lb blue cheese crumbled, 1/2 cup Panko and 2 Tbsp of heavy cream, stir til well mixed and refrigerate. When steaks were cooked I packed on the crust and put under broiler til melted and crispy!! (Only a few mins) I served with twice baked potatoes and roasted asparagus! One of best meals I ever had!!

So delicious!!! Also, pretty easy to make. I served the steak on top of mashed potatoes and spread the sauce all over. Had to find the port wine at the liquor store. Relatively inexpensive. Definitely a new favorite in our household.

Side dish - green beans cooked in butter 2 garlic cloves and some brown sugar.  Personally I thought the sauce was a bit gross... I would consider skipping it, maybe do a coffee and black peppercorn rub or just season your steak as you like... For this reason we put the sauce on the side to try it both ways.  The blue cheese panko was kinda interesting and good.   The presentation of steak on top of mashed potato looks good but makes it weird to cut the steak but .. Still good :)

I made this tonight and it was absolutely fantastic. I did use ribeye instead of filet and seasoned it with a steak seasoning before cooking it. I also made mushroom risotto and green beans as a side. Planning to make it again real soon!

As a Valentine's gift, I cooked this for my wife and had it ready and waiting when she got home.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out completely perfect.  It was easily the best steak I've ever prepared, and probably the best I've eaten from anywhere.

This was delicous! I made this for Valentines day dinner. I used a flat iron steak though but followed the directions here and they turned out nice and medium-rare on the inside like I intended. Very tender and the blue cheese/bread crumb topping was delicious. For the sauce I used 1 c of onions instead of a 1/2 cup and also used a merlot instead of port. The sauce still tasted good but next time maybe I'll try with the port.

Awesome restaurant quality recipe! I used onion powder and garlic powder instead, but still turned out great.

Nice combination.  I also made the dinner for two and made the sauce recipe for four.  Used olive oil on the steaks instead of vegetable oil.  15 minutes baking time is a little too long for medium rare.

The blue cheese crust is to die for. Pass on the port wine sauce, not needed.

We don't normally cook gourmet style steaks but thought I would give this a go.  It was fun to prepare and foolproof.  Very tastey. Paired with merlot, oven roasted vegetables and peas and carrots side dish.  Out of 4 adults and 5 teenagers, all steaks were devoured except for 1/2 which was left by a teenager.

I really liked this recipe a lot, but I did figure out that I don't like Thyme or Port Wine.  I won't ever make a recipe with these ingredients again.  Back to this recipe, I really enjoyed the blue cheese with bread crumbs topping the steak..that was fantastic!  I really enjoyed the sauce, but again thyme and port wine are not my fav.  I wonder if there is an alternative here.  Overall really great though! My husband enjoyed it.

I loved the combo of the meat with the blue cheese topping. I didn't care for the port wine sauce. I would make the filet again with a glass of wine on the side.

Made this last night, loved the blue cheese topping, and also loved the sauce (I used Merlot instead of port), however, I think the 2 together are 'too much'. I will use these toppings again, but not together.

Made this exactly as written and it was SO good--ten times better than any steak I have ever eaten at a restaurant, including expensive steakhouses.  There was lots of flavor in this.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  This will be the go to dish for special occasions at my house now.  YUM!!!

fantastic! I have never made filet mignon and it turned out wonderfull! I only did 2 things differently, I added a little water to the blue cheese/bread crumb mix so that it would stay on the filet a little better, and I used red wine, becuase I didn't have any port.

Oh my gosh, this was so good. my husband said it ranked up there with one of the best steaks he has had. pretty impressive words considering this was my first attempt to cook a steak. This was so tender. I did change one thing and that was to use merlot for the sauce. It was great! I also increased the cooking time to 20 min for my husbands medium steak and 25 for my medium well. It was so easy yet elegant! Thanks!

Oh my!!!  As if it needs another review...but it was amazing.  I could still taste it the whole next day.  I'm not a red meat lover, but I was cooking for company so I was going out on a limb and I LOVED it.  I am actually craving steak now.  I cooked it according to the recipe -except- I used New York Strip instead of Fillet Mignon because I was too cheap to buy the good stuff.

This was awesome!  Just a few notes though.  I followed some of the other reviewers advice and marinated the steak in a merlot/beef broth/worcestire sauce/and seasonings marinade.  I baked mine for 17 minutes and it came out medium rare.  We like our steaks more medium so I'll do it longer next time.  Also, the port wine "sauce" is more like a relish so I added mushrooms to mine.  I loved the "sauce" but my boyfriend barely touched his saying the steak was good enough as is.  I will def make this again!

Hubby and I made this together for Valentine's Day.  We pretty much followed the recipe except we increased the cooking time because our steaks were rather thick and we wanted them closer to medium well.  I also had to use regular bread crumbs because I forgot to buy panko bread crumbs and my homemade ones burned in the oven (I forgot about them!).  We really enjoyed it- just need to work on our cooking steak skills some more.

This is soo mind-blowingly delicious! I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and we both absolutely loved it! This is the best way to cook a steak. I used bone-in ribeyes instead of filet mignon.  My boyfriend and I decided that this will be what we will have for Valentine's Day every year, instead of going to an expensive restaurant.

Delicious! And surprisingly easy to prepare. I loved this recipe and while it's a tad expensive (good steak is, after all) it really impressed my husband for V day. Partnered beautifully with some creamy mashed potatoes and lightly steamed asparagus. Wonderful - which surprised me because I usually am not a fan of blue cheese... found it delicious in this! We both loved it and felt very extravagant. I will definitely make this again for special occasions. :D

Came out great. We used rib eye steaks (about 1 inch thick) instead of filet and the cooking times were perfect for rare. Also used just a red italian wine instead of port and added sauteed Shitake mushrooms to the sauce.  Excellent recipe!

I thought this was good. It would be great without the port wine reduction as well. Actually, I don't like port wine, so I used a Cabernet blend...and it was very good. I would like to try it on another cut of beef or maybe moose! Thanks!

Really good.  I was looking for a way to cook some beef fillet tips I had. So I used those for the meat.  The recipe was very easy to make.  It reminded me of the bleu cheese topped fillet mignon we once had at Ruths Criss Steak House.  Only MUCH more affordable!

My husband said it was the best steak he had ever had.  However, we didn't have the port on hand, so I used another pungent,but more common cabinet inhabitant, a nice balsamic vinegar.  However, you should use little salt if you do.

Amazing Recipe!!! I made this recipe for new years for my husband.  This has to be my favorite steak recipe ever!! We eat at a lot of fine dining restaurants, and this recipe is up there with menu items costing $100+ a plate.  The blue cheese was a great choice for this disk, I used the Rosenborg Mellow Blue Cheese the 2nd time and found it to be excellent.  Definitely try this recipe...you will love it!!!

I found a blue cheese that was aged in port wine and couldn't resist trying it in this dish. It was Phenomenal!! The only changes I made were adding some crimini mushrooms to the port wine sauce and we grilled the steaks then finished them off under the broiler. Beautiful presentation!

The steaks with the blue cheese panko topping were really good, but I don't think the flavor of the sauce really complimented this dish.  I would make again, but without this particular wine sauce.

This wasn't very good.  If I wanted a flavor like that I'd do it with a roast, not filet mignon.

Made this for my honey on Valentine's day. He said "Best meal ever cooked in his house!" I probably could have taken them out earlier as they still cooked some while resting as they ended up more medium than meduim rare, but that was chef's error not recipe. I would definitely choose this again. It was a huge hit! Combine with parmesan roosted potatoes and crab stuffed mushrooms - top it off with Ultimate Irish Cream Chocolate Mousse - Rich and decadent!

I wanted to fix something special for Valentine's Day, and this was just the ticket. It was absolutely delicious--the port wine sauce really made it. I followed the recipe to the letter except for two things: I marinated the steaks in the port wine before cooking, and I didn't have panko bread crumbs (or even know what they are), so I used seasoned bread crumbs that I had on hand.

Testing out some recipes for a dinner party & I think this one is it. Steaks were flavorful, tender, & it was fairly easy  to make. Sauce was very good, so make alittle extra.

I made this for my wife and I for valentines day.  This is the best steak that we have ever had. Cooked for 30min because we like our steak done. Used red wine and regular bread crumbs. Will cook again.

WOW.  This is an easy recipe with a gourmet result!  I made it last night and my husband and still can't shut up about it.  It's not very time consuming and a great way to have filets when it's too cold outside to grill.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!

Made this for Valentine's Day. I did not like the sauce. Personally, I would reduce the amount of thyme if I would make it again. Filet mignon does fine on its own, but after trying some other recipes like "Beef tenderloin with roasted shallots" from this site, this one is just okay.

I gave this only three stars because of the blue cheese. I cut down on the cheese to about a 1/2 cup and it still was just to strong and too much. I left the meat in for about 40 minutes. I came out nicely done, not pink inside, and soft. The sauce is great, but if you do not like blue cheese too much this recipe is not for you. You could try omitting it, the recipe would still come out great.

Turned out very good. I made it with parmesean instead of blue cheese since my hubby doesn't like blue. Also used Cabernet wine since that is what I had in the house. Sauce had great flavor and the coating on the steak was tasty & crisp. I did cook the steaks a little too long in the over (20 min) but that was my fault. Overall a very good recipe that is easily adjusted to your specifications.

I was lazy! I seared the filets, sprinkled Montreal Steak seasoning on them and popped them in the oven at 375 for 15 minutes. They were great. Better than any at a restaurant. Flavorful and juicy.

FAVORITEThis is the best way to make your steak. The process with searing and putting it in the oven makes a very juicy tender steak every time. The rest period is so important also. I love the reduction, sometimes I add mushrooms at the end. I don't always put on the blue cheese topping as the reduction sauce is plenty.

Very good & flavorful for not much effort!  My husband loved it & I will cook this again soon!  I agree that the cheese mixture for 4 servings makes more like 8 servings.  I smoothered the steaks with the mixture and still had at least half left over.  LOVED IT!

Absolutely wonderful.  
I subbed a Cab/Shiraz for the port, and used sweet red onion, leaving everything else the same. 
My wife said she felt like she was in an expensive restaurant.
Well done!

This was so easy to make and so wonderful to eat! The fiance doesn't really do blue cheese and he ate everything on his plate. I served this with Nancy Orlowski's "Holiday ONLY Mashed Potatoes" and "Baked Pears" submitted by Betty Schledorn. 

Personally, I would do without the sauce, not only because it doesn't need it, but also because neither of us drink wine (so it's a waste to by a bottle for half a cup) and I don't like onions. But this picky eater sure loves her some blue cheese and next time will be sure to add even more! (I even ate my leftover blue cheese mixed with the panko as a snack one day - weird, I know...)

We liked this so much I made it twice in one week! I used cabernet instead of port and it was perfect. The sauce is amazing and would be good on anything! I forgot to put this in my recipe box before, so glad I finally found it again!

Can I just say, "Wow"?  This was lovely and very rich.  Did not change a thing.  But.... next time will cook on grill.  (It was snowing in the Northwest)

I made this for my husband on Valentine's day and it was a hit!!  Neither one of us had filet mignon this good!  I highly recommend it, and it's pretty easy to make.

I made this as written, but did use thick New York steaks as the filet mignon at the store didn't look so great.  We just did not care for the port wine sauce, and the blue cheese topping was ok.  Thanks for letting us try it, HebeGebe!

When this recipe popped into my mailbox, I was keen to try it. Although I don't much care for blue cheese, my husband loves it, so I gave this recipe a go. It was excellent! The port sauce is exquisite and the blue cheese was surprisingly mild when paired with these ingredients. I was so impressed that I made it again for Valentine's dinner. This time I added a little more beef broth and slightly less port, to cut back on the sweetness. We loved it, and it has now become a permanent addition to our family recipe box.

Loved this!  The port wine sauce wasn't a big hit because the meat was so divine.  I served it for my in-laws, who cook every weekend and they crooned over it!  It's a keeper!

How can you mess up beef tenderloin and blue cheese!  I grilled the steaks and then put them under the broiler just to crunch up the topping--yummy!  And the sauce really makes it.

The filets with the topping turned out terrific!  It was my first try cooking steaks in the oven.  The port wine sauce on the other hand was sort of disappointing.  Didn't taste like much and was sort of like onion mush.  But overall an enjoyable meal!

My husband made this and we were both impressed.  We'd had the same dish at a steak house and this was pretty close.  We used roquefort, but may try a tangier cheese next time for more of a contrast to the sweet sauce.

My fiance and I really loved this recipe.    I made it with port & thought it tasted just fine.  The only problem was that my cheese topping burnt after the suggested time in the broiler.  I think I just have a bad over, though.  Next time I'll watch more carefully.
