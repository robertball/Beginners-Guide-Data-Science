These came out delicious- a few modifications for mine. I halved the sugar (1/4 cup white, 1/4 cup brown), added 1/2 cup of raisins, and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. Cooking time of 16 mins was spot on. Love them!!!

These were good. I made a minor modification because I didn't have any flax seeds. I omitted them and substituted 6 T. Of plain yogert for the water. I'll make again.

Fantastic muffins! Used 1 cup spelt flour and 1/2 cup almond flour and cut the sugar to only 1/4 cup each to make these even healthier. Also added some cinnamon (didn't measure but used quite a bit just because i love cinnamon!) and about 1/2 cup of raisins. Left the flax out completely but the muffins weren't dry at all. I was able to get 24 muffins

Very moist and yummy. I modified it a bit for an even healthier version. I used 2 cups of gluten free flour instead of whole wheat and White flour. And I replaced the white and brown sugar with 2 cups of  stevia sugar baking blend. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla extract for extra flavor. The baking time was about 10 minutes longer. If you bake with gluten free flour, it's very important not to overbake, so put your muffins in the freezer for a quick cool-down after you have taken them out of the oven. If you just put them on the kitchen counter, they'll keep baking till they're cool, thus might dry out.

Very good flavor.  I mixed the wet  ingredients first then I added the dry ones.  Will most definitely make them again.

My family loved this muffin recipe.  Moist and delicious.  I also added some raisins.  Would definitely make these again.

I didn't have unsweetened  apple sauce  so I used 2 of those little snack cups the kids take in their lunch...it was strawberry apple. I omitted  the walnuts as my family doesn't care for them, I also added about 1 tsp of cinnamon  and 1/4 cup of oats.  They tasted very moist, nice chunks of apple...very hearty. Very tasty, will add more spice next time though...my kids liked them too. Success!

These were just okay. My toddler loved them, which is really what I was looking for, but for myself I would add some cinnamon and/or nutmeg to increase the flavour. They were a bit bland as is.
