The best lemon pepper ribs I've tasted! These ribs are perfect for those that are looking for a rib recipe that doesn't have sauce slathered all over them. I used soaked apple wood chips for the smoking.

I used technique of simmering ribs with water, little bit of wine, and pickling spice for a couple hours.  I then drained and dried the ribs, basted with apple juice and oil.  Then topped with dry rub of brown sugar, apple pie spice, and club house lemon pepper.  I still sit for a couple hours then barbecued for 30 minutes basting often with apple juice mixture.
