Very clever and delicious idea!  I opened a can of pureed tomatoes instead of diced, so mine was more saucy than it should have been, but it worked.  I used a smaller but deep casserole so I put a little sauce in the bottom, layer of ravioli, veggies and sauce, more ravioli and topped with the rest of the veggies and sauce, and cheese.  While I love traditional ratatouille, I usually need to have something else with it as it's not too filling for me - the ravioli makes this a complete, and delicious, meal! Thanks for sharing!

Like everyone, I made changes to suit my own style and ingredients, but the basic recipe here is a wonderful canvas to build on. It was wonderful. My changes---I used a pint jar of tomato sauce (home canned) in place of the diced tomatoes, sausage cheese torteloni in place of ravioli because that's what I had on hand, added mushrooms, used fresh parsley and pesto concentrate from a tube instead of dried because dried parsley and dried basil are about the most useless and flavorless dried herbs there are, and I added a little bit of grated parmesan to the mozzarella just because I wanted to finish up the bit I had.

Wow, this is stellar!  I'm not normally a fan of eggplant, but I could really eat this every day.  We didn't have parsley on hand, and I'm not sure what it would have added.  Used fresh ravioli instead of frozen, and didn't bother pre-cooking it.  I added a yellow squash, too, because we didn't have quite enough zucchini.  This will go on permanent rotation.

This is a great fall recipe since I was able to buy almost everything at my local farmers' market. I left the peel on (it's full of anti-oxidants!)...especially since I used baby eggplants and their skin was not too tough. I also used fresh tomatoes (3 large) to cut down on the sodium and had to add a little bit of water because of it. I used fresh spinach ravioli instead of cheese ravioli. This is a really healthy and yummy dish. It tastes even better reheated the next day.

Totally awesome recipe! We hadn't tried eggplant before, and have always wanted to - this was a perfect introduction. No real changes made to the recipe. We had fresh basil and parsley so we used 3 tablespoons of each of those for the conversion from dried to fresh. We also tossed and coated the diced eggplant with salt for a half hour ahead of time, rinsed and dried it on paper towel. This closes the cells of the eggplant, which keeps it from soaking up the olive oil during cooking. Basically it keeps the eggplant from to becoming slimy. Other than using fresh herbs and prepping the eggplant we made it as directed, which resulted in a definitely make me again recipe!

This is fantastic.  I used half Fire-Roasted canned tomatoes and half fresh from the garden, and added mushrooms.  Also used a 5-cheese blend instead of just mozzarella.  I went to put the leftovers away and my family had demolished the whole casserole!  Will definitely make again.

Very tasty and easy to prepare. Great way to use garden vegetables. I used very ripe fresh tomatoes from the garden and it turned out wonderful.

Hubby thought this was great; I thought it was all-right!  Lots of good veggies, maybe a spicier ravioli would help perk it up; something with sausage maybe!

This is excellent. My husband likes both ratatouille and ravioli. What a wonderful way to give him both.Add your own favorite seasonings to your taste. Will make on a routine basis...

Very good!  I love the use of fresh basic ingredients.  And it's quick & easy to throw together on a weeknight, what more could you want!  I used fresh ravioli and just put it straight into the dish (it cooked fully during baking).  Also the store was out of eggplant (I know, weird) so I used extra zuchini and added mushrooms.  I think you can use whatever veggies you like.  Will make again!

Excellent!  My husband detests eggplant.  Doesn't even like to be in the same room with it!  But he had two helpings the first night, and when we reheated the leftovers the next night I had to fight for my share!  I already bought the ingredients to make this again.  The only change I made was instead of the basil and parsley I used a generous tablespon of Italian seasoning.   Yummy!

You have to cut the vegetables fairly small and have patience and cook everything as long as it says in the recipe (you may need a little extra olive oil), but if you do, they will all be tender, and the eggplant shouldn't taste bitter or overpowering.  I don't even bother peeling the vegetables-- just wash them well.  I did, however, add EXTRA salt, some red pepper flakes, and Herbs de Provence, because I cook ratatouille often, and have learned it needs the extra flavor.  I also sprinkled Parmesan over the ravioli, before pouring the vegetables on top. I think any sort of melted cheese on top would be equally yummy, and I recommend using a RED bell pepper and spinach/cheese ravioli.  By the way, I didn't use any nonstick cooking spray on my glass baking dish, and it came out fine.  Very enjoyable!

Great recipe. I substituted home-grown tomatoes and the equivalent amounts of fresh basil and parsely for the dried. I also used whole-wheat spinach ravioli.

This is such an awesome recipe.  I used the veggies stated in the recipe and also added some chopped asparagus that I had in the fridge.  I wasn't quite sure how it was going to be at first but I was pleasantly surprised.

This was very easy peasy to make and was really quite good! I didn't have parsley so I used cilantro instead. I used fresh tomatoes also. This was a really good dinner for hot summer nights. Thank You Wendy! Nice Job!

Just made this for dinner tonight... had two large zucchini and eggplant from a friends garden, this worked well.  My husband really liked it and he can be a picky eater.  I did add half a can of tomato paste to the veggie mix when it was cooking on the stove (personal preference, really liked it).  Also, the ravioli I had was cheese/spinach ravioli... it came with a packet of seasoning to mix with olive oil and toss the ravioli in, so I did that before I put them on the bottom of the dish.  Very tasty... honestly though I wonder if it would have need more salt had I not added the seasoning packet that came with the ravioli.  Give it a try!  I think the veggie mixture would be good alone with a crusty bread or even over plain pasta.  I'm thinking I might made the veggies and serve with chicken.  Good stuff.

This is excellent! I made this the first time because I had an obscene amount of eggplant and zucchini from my CSA box. I've since made it several more times. This is an perfect recipe for the end of summer vegetable bounty.  I added extra zucchini, garlic and eggplant; mixed in a summer squash with the zucchini; used 3 fresh tomatoes instead of canned; used 8 oz of shredded cheese (about 1 cup); and used fresh ravioli (never frozen). Because the ravioli was fresh, I didn't cook it before putting it in the casserole dish. The liquid from the sauce cooked it just fine.  I had some vegetarian friends over for dinner the first time I made this, one of whom hates eggplant, and they both loved it. :)

This was okay. Nothing special and therefore won't make it again. Followed the recipes as outlined and it was a little bland for me.

Very good flavor.  Followed the directions as written and it was delicious!  Didn't peel the eggplant though as I didn't think it was necessary, and it wasn't.  We will definitely have this again.  Served with a simple spinach salad.

Awesome casserole.  I grilled the veggies first which really adds flavor.  
I also 'sweat' the eggplant in salt (search this site for article).  Basically this brings out flavor to avoid frequent bitterness of eggplant, brings out flavor and hardens the texture so it does not turn to mush (especially when pre-grilling).  And you wash the salt off before cooking.
BEST is it is a good leftover.  Not sure if it freezes well.

This recipe is brilliant for two reasons: the seasonings are simple and work well with the garlic to create a wonderful, vibrant flavor; and you can really use just about any vegetable combination that you please. I'm sure the recipe is delicious as is (hence my confidence in giving 5 stars), but I feel the need to disclose what I changed: Neither the man nor myself really like eggplant, so I used yellow squash and mushrooms instead. I followed another user's recommendation of fire roasted tomatoes, and I used an Italian blend of cheese that included mozzarella. I easily could have eaten it until I burst, and just think of all of the vitamins you're getting from all those veggies!

If only there were more stars!  I found this recipe to use the tons of veggies that a friend gave me from her garden and it was fabulous!  I changed it a little - added yellow squash and mushrooms, and also used fresh tomatoes from my friend's garden instead of the canned.  My husband, who isn't big on zucchini or squash, loved it as well.  Definitely a keeper - and one to share.  Yummy Yummy!!!!

My 22 year old daughter is a vegetarian and this is her favorite meal. My 85 year old meat eating father lives with us.  I made this and he said that this is so good he'd request it on his birthday.  I don't change a thing.  Its perfect the way it is.

This was delicious. I added a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, and used a yellow pepper rather then green. I also threw in some mushrooms. I'll definitely make this again.

Clever idea for a meal in itself. I feared dryness based on some reviews so i added some leftover spaghetti  sauce I had on hand. (was a good idea as it turned out). I also added mushrooms

Very Delicious! Didn't have everything on hand so, these were my tweeks and still turned out great. Not a fan of eggplant so just used zucchini and bell pepper. Didnt have can of diced tomatoes, so i subst. w/ one chopped tomatoe, 1/2 can tomatoe sauce, and a little water (to have enough liquid to boil). Also didnt have shredded cheese, so i used deli slices of provolone and just laid them over the top! Great. Will make again!

Made this recipe for the first night of our vacation- nine adults and five kids- and it was a big hit with everyone!  I usually don't peel eggplant, but I followed the recipe and did it this time and I think that is what made the kids willing to try it.  Great way to use all the yummy summer produce.

Great recipe!  I am also making up some of the vegetable mixture (cooked) and freezing it to have on hand to make some of this in the winter.  Great way to use up all the vegetables before they go bad.

Pretty good. The kids ate it up but it makes a lot so be prepared with a lot of people to feed or you'll have a ton leftover.

I was surprised at how good this was!  Delicious way to get a giant serving of vegetables!!!  Instead of frozen ravioli I used fresh spinach tortellini.  I also added a few mushrooms, and I used fresh parsley and basil instead of dried.  I didn't bother cooking the pasta either.  The sauce was a bit watery, but that's a good thing because it's absorbed by the dryer pasta.  Turned out great, and I'm so impressed by the calorie and fat count!  I'll be eating this one again!

Pretty delicious and simple to make.  I added a can of rinsed kidney beans to add some protein in order to serve as a complete meal.  Next time I might add some chicken cubes or maybe even pork.

This was fantastic. The only change I made was to double the ravioli. Next time I will try it with fresh ravioli and fresh herbs to see if it can get any better!

Loved this dish.  The raviolis made it really hearty.  I put a thin layer of tomato sauce in the baking dish before adding the veggies and I added mushrooms to the veggie mix. It came out perfect!

This was so good! I did everything almost exactly as written except I used 13 ounces of cheese ravioli. I used yellow, red and orange bell peppers instead of green for more color. I also used a blend of mozzerella, provolone and parmesan cheese. I really liked it with the blended cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

I ended up straying a little from the original recipe. Purely because it turned out my eggplant was well and truly past it's best. Instead I sliced a few mushrooms and as well as the tinned tomatoes I had one single tomato which I chopped and added in. At the end of simmering I threw in a handful of spinach which wasn't enough to use up on it's own. This was delicious and I promise to make it to the recipe soon Surpriseitswendy thankyou.

I thought this was just yummy!  I made it exactly as written except I added a little more salt and used a 12 oz bag of frozen ravioli instead of 8 oz.  There was plenty of sauce for the extra pasta.  Baked in a 9x13 pan.  I'm a huge fan of eggplant and will try any recipe that uses it.  This did not disappoint.  : )

Crazy Good!  Followed directions exactly with the exception of using a 10 oz pkg of cheese tortolleni and added more veggies than called for in a 9 x 13 pan.  A keeper!

Excellent!  The only way I can get my 1 year old son to eat eggplant.  Because my husband is a meat lover, I added spicy jalapeno sausage from Trader Joe's and red pepper flakes and made it a spicy sausage Ratatouille bake.  Yum yum.

Everyone loved it.  We had to have it twice in one week.  We added more ravioli than called for and did not add tomato sauce as suggested by others.  However, I suspect it would also be good with the extra sauce.  What a great and versatile recipe!

Very good. My local store was out of eggplant so I just added mushrooms and yellow squash. I also put this on top of rice instead of the ravioli.

Easy and good.  I had to cook the vegetables longer than the recipe called for and on medium high heat because they were taking so long to cook.  I ended up doubling the fresh vegetables and ravioli amounts and added 1 can tomato sauce.

I loved this recipe, I wanted to eat just the vegetables!  I think I would have preferred it without the ravioli, or maybe a different kind of pasta.  But the flavor of the veggies all together was very tasty.

Delicious! Will follow Christine M's idea next time as the ravioli stuck to the bottom of the casserole. Used the diced tomatoes and added a little italian flavored tomato paste which gave it a delightful italian flavor. Will definitely be making this again!

I was so happy to find this recipe! My garden had runneth over and this recipe incorporates all the vegetables that I needed to use up. Reading the reviews, one thing kept coming up- that it tasted even better the next day. So, I made the veggie mix the day before, and assembled it the next day. It was awesome! The only thing I changed was to add fresh basil and parsley. Dried herbs just can't compare, and I mean, you have all these wonderful fresh vegetables,why not get some fresh herbs? I had more veggies than I needed to cover the ravioli, so I put the rest in the freezer. Not sure how they'll be, but I'll find out in the dead of the winter when I thaw it out to be reminded of my summer garden!

This was Really good I doubled the recipe and baked in 2, 13x9" pans so that I can share with my daughter and her vegetarian daughters.  My husband liked it very much also.  Update on this, I made the vegie part and froze several batches then this winter I just thawed a package out and topped the Ravioli, baked and we had a wonderful dish in no time.  Good for potlucks too.

I LOVE this recipe :) I think it's a great and exceptionally tasty way to get all of your veggies into a meal. My only complaints were that it can come out a little bland, and my husband seemed to want meat. So I counteract these by adding 1/8 - 1/4 cup lemon juice while the veggies are cooking, and a touch more basil. I've also added fresh italian sausage cooked like hamburger meat and strewn throughout the the dish, it really gives it a flavorful kick! It gets the husband "please make it again" stamp of approval!

Fresh, fresh, fresh, is all I can say!! This is such a good summer meal, or an extremely good side dish. I made a few adjustments only because I used what I had in my kitchen. I didn't have eggplant. I cooked the onion for around 5 minutes. Added the garlic, cooked for another minute. I had fresh basil and parsley, so I added them at the end of the 20 minute simmer. I mixed the cooked ravioli with the tomato mixture, dumped it into a Pam Sprayed casserole dish, sprinkled with the cheese and baked for only five minutes to melt the cheese. I don't think baking for 20 minutes is necessary.  Yummy.

OUTSTANDING!!!  Fantastic recipe.  I did not have an eggplant so I used other vegetables.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I really wanted to like this. I had all the necessary ingredients & used this recipe mainly because I didn't want my eggplant, zucchini & bell pepper to spoil. Followed the recipe exactly, but I should've known to use fresh herbs, I felt the dried basil was a bit overpowering (is it possible it's meant to be 1 teaspoon?) & (obviously) didn't have that freshness factor. Other than that I really disliked the eggplant in this, & I love eggplant. Could be it wasn't a good one, or perhaps I should've salted/rinsed it prior to use...I don't know but together this was just a dried herb flavored mush up & I wish I would've found a different recipe because even though I managed to use up the veggies I still feel they were wasted. Giving it 2 stars because DH said it wasn't that bad, though he doesn't want me to make it again...:-(

yum! i tried this last summer, looking for a good recipe to use up lots of my CSA veggies. this is fantastic, and we love it. i always make a double batch so i can share with my parents who live next door. i tend to substitute the tomatoes with a can of amy's organic chunky tomato bisque soup. delicious. i also switch the ravioli depending on what i have on hand (cheese, spinach & cheese, or ground beef) - all good, though i prefer the spinach & cheese. try this!

Wonderful!! I added mushrooms, hot turkey sausage, extra garlic, yellow squash along with the zucchini, and Italian seasoning instead of the basil.  So easy and flavorful!! As we have some dairy issues here, I made half of the recipe as written with cheese ravioli and put the other half over pasta for a great alternative to regular tomato sauce...

I made this as a side dish for company - it was enjoyed by all. It was nice to get a variety of vegetables in one side dish, but it was a little mushed together (mushy). If I make it again, I will make sure to stick to or cut back just a little on the cooking times.

I thought this was a wonderful dish. Very adaptable. I don't like onions or bell peppers so I replaced it with two more cloves of garlic and added yellow squash. And I added a 8oz can of tomatoe sauce that had garlic, basil and oregano for more liquid since other reviews mentioned it being dry. I think it really helped. Will definitely put this into the rotation.

This is a great idea, however we found it dry and not very flavorful. We added some jarred pasta sauce and that was the missing piece.

I enjoyed the vegetable mixture on this dish, but I'm not sure I liked it very much with cheese ravioli.  For leftovers, I just ate the veggies and ended up throwing away the ravioli and the cheese topping.

This dish was very light, fresh and flavorful. It's a healthy meal yet isn't too "veg". We made this for a family get together & my family enjoyed it so much that my father-in-law stated that he wouldn't mind eating it at least once a week!

I made this recipe exactly except for using the layering method so my casserole would fit in my toaster over.

This really is fantastic: easy, delicious, gets better and better as it stands. This is going to be my vegetarian dish of choice.

My 7 and 9 year old loved this. Was a great way to use up veggies from the garden. One recommendation is that is does need more sauce. Since I needed to roast alot of veggies for another dish I actually sprayed them with Olive Oil and pan roasted them in the oven at 400 for about 20 minutes. I had the garlic on there as well and when it came out of the oven I used a garlic press to squeeze the garlic on the roasted veggies.  I did use the one can of diced tomatoes but it did not look like it was going to be saucey enough so  then I ended up mixing in a about 1 1/2 cups of tomato basil pasta sauce into the veggies  before pouring it on over pasta. Everyone then asked for more sauce on the side. All in all it was a keeper!

Wanted to make something with all the summer goodness from the local farmers market.  Followed the recipe for the most part but added a jar of tomato and basil pasta sauce and used whole wheat pasta instead of the ravioli.  Came out great and will for sure make again.  I agree with the other review that it was a great canvas for adding some extra "flair."

This is a very good recipe. I didn't measure the zucchini or eggplant, just used 2 medium zucs and 1 medium eggplant. I also used fresh basil and parsley. Next time, I would use a larger can of diced tomatoes or ad some fresh because they cooked down quite a bit. I would definately mkae this again.

SO YUMMY!  I used fresh veggies from our local Farmer's Market.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of sauce.  I also used ravioli with meat inside of it.  It went together quickly.  I used a 9X13 baking dish.  I just LOVE finding tasty, quick recipes on AllRecipes!

I was happy to find this recipe because I had most of the ingredients.  This was easy to make and delicious to eat.  This one is a keeper, I can't wait to cook it for my extended family.  I did add shredded carrots to this dish...big carrot fan.  I also used squash instead of zucchini and 2 fresh tomatoes and a little more cheese.

I made this for my vegetarian relatives and after dinner was immediately asked for the recipe. I doubled the recipe and still added an extra can of diced tomatoes.  I also added some extra spices like oregano and garlic powder (in addition to the garlic in recipe)and some parmesan cheese to the veggie mixture for taste.  A good easy recipe in my book!

This was good. It is a very versatile dish that you could add almost any vegetable to (i.e. squash for a pop of yellow color, shredded carrots, etc.). However, I did not appreciate the taste of the canned tomatoes, which overpowered the fresh vegetables. Next time, I think I will use diced grape tomatoes and add those to the onion / eggplant mixture in the skillet at first. I also think doing a layer of cheese between the ravioli and veggies in addition to the one on top would be a good idea as the dish is so vegetable-intensive. Overall, though, this is a great meatless dish with much potential - and surprisingly, you won't even miss the meat!

Love this recipe!  I made it for the first time tonight and it is a winner!  I used yellow squash instead of zucchini as I couldn't find it in the stores.  Thanks for submitting!  I needed something different. :)

I had lots of vegetables on hand and this was just the recipe for summer vegetables!  It's great for a light meal or side dish.  I added extra cheese, but made the rest of the recipe as stated.  It was well seasoned and very tasty.  Thanks for sharing :-)

I really enjoyed this meal. Followed directions exactly, except i forgot to buy the can of tomatoes, so I used 3 chopped tomatoes and added some vegetable broth for more liquid for the vegetables to boil. The one down side is it really is a lot of prep work- dicing all the vegetables

This was wonderful!  My husband loved the garlicky flavor without it being overpowering.  I didn't think one can of diced tomatoes looked like enough so I added a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste thinned with a little water.  It was perfect for my taste.  Will definitely make again and again.

I made this exactly as written, just not sure what we were missing.  We did not enjoy this at all.   It seemed very "blah".  As far as my dinner experiments go, this one failed.  I had such high hopes based on everyone else's reviews.  Sorry...

Made this last night and everyone loved it.  I used twice as much ravioli, thought that was a good amount.  I sprinkled in some red pepper flakes and loved the kick that provided.  Added a small can of tomato sauce as suggested by others and liked that it had a little more sauce.

I loved this!  Husband was a little concerned there was no meat so I added 2 cups of shredded cooked chicken to the vegetables, and we like everything spicy so I added a jalepeno.  Would have been perfect without these additions also.

This was amazing. Very good and very flavorful. Was nervous about the no meat/tons of veggies, but it was very tasty and really easy and quick to prepare and clean up. I will make this often. Subbed a yellow squash for eggplant (do not care for eggplant) and a red pepper for green. I also did 2 layers since I made so much ravioli, and did a pepperjack layer and then a mixed shredded mix/parm layer on stop. The pepperjack gave it a nice kick every few bites. You can definately add meat to this, next time I may try kielbasa or pork sausage. I imagine you could even do a turkey sausage too. I normally love meat but did not miss it in this meal although my husband did. This meal felt really good to cook and eat since it's so full of veggies, and was very filling and satisfying.

Delicious!  I used almost a whole can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  I omitted the bell pepper, but threw in some fresh mushrooms instead.  I probably used more ravioli than it called for too.  And I added more cheese.  I used 5.5 oz.  I layered it all in a throw away pan for easy clean up.  I found ratatouille boring, so adding the ravioli & cheese was a brilliant idea!

I used plain pasta instead of ravioli (don't like ravioli). The flavors were great! Next time I'll add a bit of sauce to the veggies, it was a bit dry this time.

I am an experienced cook, but I had never made ratatouille.  I usually salt and drain eggplant to keep it from being bitter, so I was skeptical about this recipe not taking that step.  I thought the pasta would mitigate the bitter taste that I expected from the eggplant.  However, there wasn't any bitterness, and we really enjoyed this dish.  I made the dish as written, except for sprinkling some parmesan cheese on top.  I wasn't sure whether to drain the canned tomatoes, but in the end I used the juice, and it was just right for us.  It was moist without being too runny.

A great twist on Ratatouille!  Even meat eaters will love this recipe as it is hearty and tastey.  The pasta makes all the differance.

This recipe was outstanding!! I made a few adjustments...took out the onions and peppers and substituted asparagus and some onion powder.  I also did not add the garlic, but I used diced tomatoes flavored with garlic, basil and oregano and it was superb! My husband loved it and said he would eat it for dinner every night!! My only suggestion would be to double the cheese!

i went a little creative with the eggplant. i wanted to bring out the flavour further so the other vegetables did not overwhelm it.  Here's how: one was diced and kept raw, 3 were baked covered with foil for about 20 mins on a sheet pan and last one was roasted with garlic over stove top flame. when baked and roasted ones were cooked and scooped out, it formed a paste. other veges were not cooked but mixed raw with the eggplant paste and baked in a shallow pan. no ravioli was used as i was making it all vegetarian. the mozzarella is such a mild cheese, it worked well with this dish. Baked covered with foil for first 30 mins. then uncovered for remaining 15 to brown the top.

I had already made some ratatouille when I saw this recipe.  I decided to add some extra basil and parsley to my ratatouille to make it more like the recipe.  I did use chicken and cheese ravioli instead of just cheese ravioli and added more mozzarella cheese on top to make sure the entire casserole was covered with it. The results were fantastic.  Luckily, we have leftovers so we can have some more tomorrow night!  This recipe will go into my special file.

Typically not a vegetarian dish kind of guy but recipe sounded good and it was great! Made minimal changes, was not “saucy “ enough for me once I put it together so I added 16 oz of tomato sauce, also more mozzarella, about double but probably would use around a cup next time. Added some Parmesan to it. Finally, I started with 8 oz of spinach and cheese ravioli and that barely covered half of my 2 1/2 qt baking dish so I over doubled, probably 20 ounces of ravioli and that gave me a great ravioli to sauce ratio. Wife loved it and so did I.

YES!!!!! A very very flavorful and filling meal!!! Packed full of veggies! I made a couple changes to use up some stuff I have laying around. I added mushrooms, parmesan cheese, a half cup of spaghetti sauce and used the refrigerated cheese ravioli instead. The whole family gobbled it right up!!

Absolutely wonderful! I used fresh spinach and cheese ravioli instead of frozen. This meant that I didn't have prepare ravioli separately. I seasoned the vegetable mixture to taste (which I always do and recommend) and otherwise followed the directions

My husband and I really enjoyed this, although I would not consider it extremely kid friendly, at least not in our home. It was easy, fairly quick and great to use up those CSA veggies. With the exception of adding some mild Italian sausage on top of the cheese ravioli, I followed the recipe as written and think I would do the same next time. The sausage really gave it a little something extra. (I do think it would be great meatless as well) I also have to say, I really like a meal that you can actually taste all of the ingredients, and this was exactly that. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe! It's a keeper!

This was very good, and I'm sure I'll make it again. Next time, I probably will add more tomatoes, and maybe mushrooms. Overall, a great way to use eggplant.

This was delicious! Used fire roasted can of tomatoes. I also added 1/2 jar of prego traditional pasta sauce on bottom of 13x9 dish then covered sauce with spinach and ricotta cheese ravioli followed by all the veggies. My husband usually doesn't like vegetables, but he raved about how good the flavors were. Will definitely be making again!

I tired this recipe because I had eggplant and all the other ingredients on hand from my CSA box.  I was delighted! I kept saying to my husband, "this is so much better than I expected." I made a few substitutions: I used fresh pesto and fresh tomatoes.  I substituted Monterey Jack cheese for Mozzarella because I had it on hand and because it is more flavorful. I also used yellow squash because I had it, rather than zucchini.Very, very good.

I made this for dinner last night and it was a huge hit!  I've been wanting to try a ratatouille recipe for a while now and liked this one because it seemed like a full meal, twist on the real thing.  I followed the recipe almost exactly and doubled it so I would have leftovers (it was such a big hit that I had just enough to bring for lunch today! lol).  Veggies I used: eggplant (skin on, diced, and treated), zucchini, yellow squash, green and yellow bell peppers, onion, portabella mushroom, and diced, canned tomatoes.  The herbs I used were all fresh from my garden and I added a little oregano.  For the cheese I used a mozzarella and provolone blend, as well as some parmesan that I was trying to use up. I stuck with the cheese ravioli, but I could definitely see this dish benefiting from a sausage or mushroom ravioli (something a little more savory than just cheese) or a mix of different raviolis. To treat the eggplant I took the suggestion of another reviewer and diced the eggplant, tossed it with some salt and let it sit for 30min.  This definitely helped the "sponge" effect of the eggplant so it didn't immediately soak up all of the cooking oil, leaving the cooked eggplant with a nice texture and not too mushy or slimy, which can sometimes happen.  I'm looking forward to my leftovers for lunch this afternoon because I think it's going to be even better the second day.  This is definitely going to be a summertime staple at our house!

this was delicious! I left out the eggplant because I don't like them and substituted diced carrots instead. added a pinch of sugar to the tomatoes to offset the acidity and crumbled in a vegetable stock cube instead of salt. I saw no reason to heat up the kitchen by using the oven(its very hot where I live)so since the ravioli and sauce were already cooked and hot,I just popped the assembled dish under the grill for a few minutes so the cheese would melt. thank you for such a great recipe.

This was very good, but there is one  thing I would do different. I used a can of diced Italian tomatoes. I thought the dish was dry. Adding tomato sauce, or spaghetti sauce to the vegetable mixture would make it better.

I added  mushrooms  and used spinach/cheese ravioli to the recipe. I added panko bread crumbs and smoked paprika with the mozarella  to top the dish. Really, really good.

Like others, I think I tweaked it to my taste - more garlic.  It is a great recipe as you can mix and match veggies.  I often add in fresh spinach, celery, and mushrooms.  I am not a vegetarian, but I do try to have 5 or more servings of veg a day, and this recipe exudes freshness and nutrition.

I did not care for this recipe. Typically AllRecipes never steers me wrong, and the 4-5 star recipes are excellent, but this one is not. We used the freshest of ingredients and it still came out bland and just unenjoyable.

We enjoyed this dish, although it could have used 12oz of pasta.  I used zucchini and yellow squash since that's what I had on hand.  Also fresh tomato rather than canned.  Loved the flavors and it was a nice, light meal.

very good, but labor intensive. I did not peel the eggplant, but did salt it, rinse, and drain. I always make a recipe as written the first time-except for adding a couple dashes of crushed red pepper. Next time I won't hesitate to throw in whatever goodies our CSA has that week.

This is an excellent, easy recipe! I used refrigerated whole wheat ravioli and just put it in the casserole dish uncooked. I used a mix of yellow & green squash and baby eggplant, not measuring how much of each, but sticking to 4 cups total, depending on what I had. Followed the rest of the recipe except using red instead of green pepper; family preference. Big hit with all. Thanks for sharing!

Ok, this was absolutely yummy! The store didn't have eggplant, so I had to use squash. It was awesome anyway! Definitely a keeper! I also used fresh tomatoes (instead of canned) and added some spaghetti sauce before I put it in the oven...

I only got as far as the ratatouille part and then changed my mind in doing this at all. I went to the farmer's market and bought all the ingredients and used fire roasted tomatoes, roasted it all in the oven for about 40 minutes at 400. It is way too bland. I had to doctor this up quite a bit.

This was great. I had a lot more eggplant and zucchini, so I used more ravioli, but kept the same amount of garlic and onions, and it still had a great flavor. I will definitely make this again.

So good! I followed the directions exactly, and then also through in a few fresh basil leaves that I had leftover. You can bet I'll be making this again! Perhaps next time I won't do the final baking step, as the rataouille can just be served over the ravioli, just to simplify it a bit.

As a non-vegetable eater, this was delicious! I nixed the tomatoes and added a cup of spaghetti sauce instead and did not use basil or parsley.

We really enjoyed this dish. I didn't use eggplant, personal preference, substituted two cups of other veggies (broccoli and something else...can't remember now).  This will be a regular!!

I love vegetables but I didn't really care for this recipe. I think using homemade marinara sauce would've made this much better - it's a nice idea though!

I really liked it, but my husband wasn't a fan.  I'm always trying to get him to try things he turns his nose up as, but he's just not a fan of soft veggies.  I used a bottle of the Spice V8 and a can of tomato paste which had a really good flavor and added some pepper and seasoning salt.  Thanks for the recipe, but I guess will only get to enjoy once since I gotta cook for the hubby too.

I didn't have eggplant, so I left that out and used a light green squash and a red bell pepper. It was amazing! Loved this recipe. Will definately try it with eggplant sometime.

This is a recipe that you can change up a bit and it's still just as good! If you don't have ravioli on hand, just use penne or another pasta that you do! Still tastes great and so healthy for you(:

I love this recipe- we usually add as many fresh veggies straight from our garden and have always gotten lots of great results playing with different veg. I love to use stuffed tortolleni in the bake.

I put this together about 3 hours before I baked it, and it still turned out really well.  Had never had Ratatouille before and wasn't sure to expect, but we were all pleasantly surprised.  Was out of the seasonings it called for, so used 3/4 of a Tablespoon of Italian Seasoning instead.  We will eat this again.

Great Flavor:  I added a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes to give it a little zip.  I also added a jar of spaghetti sauce to my Ratatouille Mixture to give it a more pasta sauce look!  I used a large 9 X 13 stoneware pan to cook it in and I also used a whole bag of Ravioli which was around a 16 oz bag!

This was very good.  I would have given it 5 stars but it needed much more sauce!  It came out a bit dry.  The canned tomatoes just wasn't enough.  I will add some extra tomato sauce next time.  Otherwise, it was great!

Very yummy. My family really enjoyed this dish. My husband is very picky, but he wanted the leftovers for lunch the next day.   I forgot the onion, and due to allergy to egg I didn't add ravioli...instead I put whole wheat rotini into the bottom of my pan and covered that with Romano cheese and mozzarella, then the veggies and more cheese. Ordinarily my family can't stand whole wheat pasta, but the texture of the veggies made the texture of the pasta unnoticeable.   Thank you for posting this!

Loved it! I am from the US, living in China for the next ?? # of months and finding the ravioli and mozzarella was out of the question. So I made up some polenta and added a few tablespoons of canned parmesan cheese. (I brought with me from Hong Kong) I made the Ratatouille and poured it over the polenta and baked as per the recipe. YUM. Really easy and flavorful. Will make again. Thank you.

I made this pretty much as written- just subbed 1 cup of yellow squash for zucchini, used fresh tomatoes, and added garbanzo beans for a little more protein.  O, and I did add a can of tomato sauce, which made it a little more hearty and helped the flavors meld.  The leftovers were also way better!  I think I would bake this the night before and heat it up in the oven when ready to serve.  Yum!  Huge hit!

This is a great recipe.  Quick.  Easy.  I have also used tortellini as well as mini ravioli.  Rather than mozzarella cheese, a four cheese blend (Trader Joe's quattro) or grated Italian cheese on top is also very tasty.  When I don't know what to make and have limited time, this is the recipe.  My adult children and their familes also love it.

As this reads, it was horrible.  The eggplant was very bitter and the whole dish was affected. I'm fairly new to cooking eggplant and told a friend I had made and hated this.  She thought it was because I didn't salt the eggplant beforehand.  Not sure that I'll make it again, but if I do, I'll salt for 30 minutes to draw out the bitterness first.

I followed everything according to the recipe except I didn't look at the size bag of ravioli required and I tripled the amount!  It was yummy that way, esp to the kids and hubby, but it probably healthier with the lesser amount.

I added chicken and polenta and kept the ravioli out to keep the calories down.  My co-workers were so jealous when this dish started turn our break room into a garlic scented paradise.  This dish is so EASY and YUMMY!   I made my own polenta from a recipe from this site.  I lined the bottom of the pan with it.  Your mouth will be dripping when the aroma's start hitting your nose.  If you love veggies, you'll love this dish.

This is good.  The eggplant in mine was slightly undercooked.  Next time, I might just add more zucchini and omit the eggplant.  It could use a bit of zing, maybe next time I'll add 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  I would also sprinkle parmesan cheese on top.

Mmmm I am enjoying this right now and it is wonderful. I made just a few changes though. I needed to make it quick so instead of a casserole, I mixed the cheese into the vegetable mixture and poured that over the ravioli. I also added a bunch of parmesan cheese on top. And it enjoyed it that way instead of baking. It is excellent!

WOW...My new step-daughters are both Vegetarians. So I was despritly looking for something to please them and my daughters also. (my girls aren't vegetarians) This recipe was PERFECT for all. My husband loves all of my cooking, but I haven't cooked for his daughters till now. It was so tasty and hearty, we all kept eating more even though we were stuffed. To suit everyone's taste., I put the garlic and parm. cheese on the table. TY for the "hit" of a veggie dish for my new daughters!

Great recipe and I also made lots of changes:
- used left over Homemade Pasta instead of the raviolli
- used homemade Marina Sauce (with a bit of Beyond Meat) instead of canned tomatoes (it had lots of fresh basil in it)
- added 1/2 cup of Stout for robust flavor
- used 2x the eggplant (basically a whole eggplant, peeled and chopped and soaked in salted water for 2hrs).

Great harvest dinner.  All the vegetables came from my garden. I used two fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes and fresh herbs instead of dried.   Also changed cheese ravioli to Mushroom Ravioli.

Super yummy. Big hit with the whole family. Even my five year old, who is an incredibly picky eater loved it!
I did make some modifications but think the original would be equally awesome.
I added a pound of italian sausage, 24 oz of ravioli and used fresh basil and parsley instead of dried. Otherwise no changes. Will definitely add to rotation. Thanks for the recipe!

I made the vegetable chunks too big so next time i would make them the recommended size! Other than that it was really yummy-not a stand out dish but a solid dinner meal that I plan on making again.

The idea of putting filled pasta with this was great.  I didn't love the mozzarella on top though.  I don't know why because mozzarella is delicious but something about it didn't work.  I usually make a recipe by the book for my 1st go around, next time ill make some changes and update from there.

Delicious recipe! I baked in a 13x9 inch pan and garnished with some fresh basil.  Great way to incorporate a lot of veggies in one dish, will definitely be making again.

I love ratatouille and love this cheesy adaptation :) But, I think the ravioli:ratatouille ratio is off. I used a 12oz package, which was only 10-12 raviolis. I don't know what heathen only eats 2 raviolis in a serving, but I don't want them in my kitchen!

OMG.  This took a lot of time but it was worth it.  My husband is raving.  I usually eat like a bird and had at least 3 times what I usually do.  My only  changes were that I used portabella mushroom and cheese stuffed ravioli and layered fresh sliced mushrooms on top of the ravioli before adding the veggies and cheese.

My husband and I loved this dish - he went back for seconds which is unusual for him.  I used fresh herbs and fresh tomatoes (4).  I didn’t cook the zucchini with the other vegetables prior  to baking as I like my zuchinni firm.  I also used fresh ravioli and didn’t precook.  I baked it for 30 minutes which it didn’t need.  The zuchinni was still too soft for me.  Next time I will stick to the 20 minutes.  This is a great recipe.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for posting!

I didn't make any changes but I would add that I cooked the eggplant and zucchini until just soft so they wouldn't become too mushy when baked. I will definitely make this again. I didn't like the cheese ravioli layered on the bottom. It may have been the four cheese ravioli I chose to use but I will probably make it without the ravioli next time.

Excellent, enough for 2 meals for my hubby and me.  2nd night better, so I would make ahead next time.  I used tortellini instead of ravioli because that's what I had and it was delicious.

I made this tonight I loved it. My kids on the other hand didn't care for it much, lately they have been picky about eating. Which is out of character for them, this is why I'm still rating it a 5.

I made the vegetable part and froze them. When I took out the vegetables, I didn't have raviolis, so I used rice. After baking, we spooned over cooked rice. Yummy

Loved this recipe! It took me MUCH longer to prepare than the 1 hour listed. Plan ahead. Also I used a 26 oz can of tomatoes, extra eggplant and a few mushrooms.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.

Love this dish! I am gluten intolerant, so I replaced the ravioli with a layer of edamame spaghetti , ricotta cheese and another layer of pasta. Fabulous!

I always wanted to make a ratatouille and I love that little Disney guy by the same name...ha! This was fun and so delish! I used red bell in place of green and I boiled 3-cheese tortellini out of a bag.  Next time I am going to  skip the pasta and put this into a rectangular tort pan I have with some puff pastry or phyllo dough ...stay tuned!

I made this delicious recipe. The only thing I did differently is that I did not use raviolis and I did not make it as a casserole. Instead I sauteed all the veggies and simmered in a dutch oven on top of the stove for at least an hour. The more it simmered the more the flavor. It was dynamite!! Yummy!! Then, I cooked some penne pasta and put the tomato soaked veggies with the pasta and topped it with Romano cheese and wow!! What a wonderful dish!! You can add cooked Italian sausage or chicken to the dish and make it a meat lovers and veggie dish. Wonderful recipe! I'll be making this again soon!! Thank you.  :-)

No changes but I used a large zucchini and more cheese than ordered and it was awesome. I darn near ate it all myself. One note is that it does not make much. More a one night meal for a family of 4. If they like it, expect to double up next time for leftovers.

What an outstanding dish!  Aside from adding fresh sliced mushrooms (simply because I love fresh mushrooms) I followed the recipe which resulted in a flavorful dish.  I have added this to my book of favorite recipes.  My thanks to the author for sharing.

awesome recipe!  Only change was used cheese tortellini cuz I didn't have ravioli on hand, lots of fresh herbs rather than dried and used my own chopped up fresh tomatoes.  These substitutions really still stuck with the overall basic recipe so I give it an A+

Delicious! Prepared eggplant with salt process. Used frozen tricolor pepper strips. Drained diced tomatoes, but used 16 oz. marinara sauce. Added half of marinara sauce to veggie mixture and spread other half in bottom of baking dishes. Used 2 qt. deep round and small deep square glass baking dishes. Kept tasting as other reviewers said it was bland. Added more salt, pepper and basil as needed. Also added garlic salt and some red pepper flakes plus grated Parmesan cheese. In pan, spread marinara, layered ravioli (used 9 oz pkg.), grated Parmesan, hot veggies, provolone cheese cut in strips, added some cooked Italian sausage in small pieces, shredded mozzarella and a little more marinara. Baked for 30 mins at 350.
1/11/17-Made again with some changes. Used spaghetti squash instead of zucchini (simmered whole in boiling water for 30 mins). Then halved, removed seeds and scoped out spaghetti squash. Liked it much better. Also used 2 pkgs. of cheese ravioli which then made two layers. More of a lasagna. Used half of large Minnellis Marinara sauce to put in bottom of pans. Layer ravioli, veggies, grated Italian cheese blend, shredded mozzarella (not too much, a light layer), sliced fresh mozzarella cheese, sauce. Repeat ending with sauce. Absolutely delicious. Bake at 350 for 45 mins.

Was okay but I think I would change this by adding some spaghetti sauce or something - make it more like a vegetable lasagna.  Brooke said it was okay, Evan & Abby not so much.

As I love tomatoes, I doubled the tomatoes and added about 8 oz of tomato sauce. Everyone loved it! Wonderful vegetarian recipe. Several people asked for the recipe.

A hit in my house. I used refrigerated tortellini (procuitto and cheese stuffed) and simply placed them in the bottom of the baking dish. I threw in a few mushrooms and some Herbs De Provence.. My husband was surprised about the eggplant which he professes to hate, but no more.

This was a great recipe for all the things I had on hand from the farmers market! I used fresh basil and parsley (increased qty ) and refrigerated ravioli, otherwise followed the recipe as  written. Will make again, maybe adding some oregano for a slightly different twist.

My son asked me to make ratatouille and I used this recipe-so so so good!  This is a meal all on its own. My boys loved it and their friends did too. This is a feel good food!

This is good. I made it as per the recipe and thought it was pretty good. I will definitely make again.  For my family's taste, we will add more ravioli. What I liked was that this is a whole meal in one dish. No need for sides! Plenty of veggies, starch and cheese for protein.  I will most definitely make again!

I've made this twice already and it's amazing, delicious and pretty healthy too! I added kale, sliced mushrooms, and a jar of marinara sauce to make it more saucy. This dish almost resembled a lasagna but has more  vegetables. I made sure to really cook down the veggies and it was so good. I also covered the dish with foil for 10 minutes and baked it uncovered for 15 minutes to get it more golden on top.

This was very tasty but I did make some alterations.  I made the ratatouille per this recipe and added a couple tablespoons of tomato paste.  The dish is great as is.  However, here are my alterations:  Instead of the ravioli, I used pre-cooked polenta. I baked the sliced polenta in my toaster oven for 15 minutes, then sprinkled some cheese on it before topping it with the ratatouille and more cheese.  I also didn't bake the dish.  I cooked the veggies in a large pot and covered it to simmer on low for at least 30 minutes before adding it to the polenta.  This is also good with cooked hot Italian sausage if you want to make this for your carnivore loved ones :)

Super yummy and even picky kids ate it.....but only gave 4 stars because I added premade pesto when serving that made a HUGE improvement. without the pesto it would have been too bland.

I used Spinach Florentine ravioli, and added mushrooms instead of zucchini (I didn't realize I didn't have a zucchini when I started cooking), and it was a delicious addition to the recipe.

I thought the recipe was very good. The only thing I myself did not care for was the ravioli. My family however, loved it all. I am making this again but will put the veggie mix on top of penne or ziti and bake instead.

fab recipe, I cook the ratatouille in the oven...clever idea "surpriseitswendy"and thanks for sharing.  There is no need to peel the aubergine, the look is better and a lot of the nutrients are in the skin.

it turned out pretty good ! my only problem was that the vegetables were watery but the flavor over all was good . Especially the cheese . I would recommend spreading the vegetables then putting cheese and then the vegetables on top again to make a layer of the cheese and vegetables . I had to omit the ravioli since I had none .

Yummy! I changed the proportions a bit. I used a 18 oz package of cheese ravioli, a whole eggplant, one small zucchini, and the same amount of everything else. I put it all in a 9x13 pan. I thought it turned out great!

Quite a bit of prep, but given the output and results,  totally worth the effort. I didn't have ravioli so I substituted plain spaghetti.

I diced an Anaheim pepper (instead of bell pepper), added a few more fresh garlic to the vegetables.  I added 1/2 cup parmigiana and mozzarella into the vegetables before topping the ravioli.  

It was a very good meal, a nice change of pace.  Thank you for posting.

This was very good and I love how healthy the dish is.. But I felt like it needed something. Maybe the right herbs would put this dish to perfection. I would like to try it again with a different ravioli.

Super yummy, easy to make, and very, very versatile.  I used 16 oz refrigerated spinach and cheese tortellini instead of the ravioli because it was on sale at the store. I used a 9x13 casserole dish, increased the amount of a few of the veggies, and put a full 2 cup package of mozzarella cheese.  My family of 5 LOVED it.  This is my go-to recipe whenever our Bountiful Baskets (www.bountifulbaskets.org, check it out!) comes with an eggplant.  I'm hoping to try this with a prosciutto ravioli next time!

I added some marinara sauce because I like a little extra sauce.  I added some additional veggies - I really think any vegetable would go in this recipe! I also used fresh herbs some crushed red peppers to add some spice. It was really good!

This was so good, and really easy to make.  The only thing I did differently was add a small amount of tomato paste which I spread thinly across the bottom of the pan before adding the ravioli.  Then, I just layered the ravioli, vegetables, and cheese. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I was looking for a pasta recipe outside of the usual spaghetti, lasagna etc. for when my husband goes out of town (he's not a fan). I cannot tell you which part of this is my favorite-the eggplant, ravioli or cheese.  The flavor is delicious.  My youngest son told me that he didn't like it; he LOVED it.  Very filling too.  I will make this again.  YUMMO!

Yummy!! I used crushed tomatoes because I wanted it saucy and wouldn't have to pre-cook the ravioli. Then some added mushrooms were also welcomed into the mix. Normally we're meat and potatoes eaters, but this was really, really good. Thanks so much for the recipe - it's a keeper and will be shared with others!

I'm reviewing this recipe after the 2nd time I made it. Fabulous! That's all! I did add smoked bacon this time....I cut 1/3rd package of bacon into small prices...sauté it...removed the nicely browned bacon into a separate bowl and proceeded with the recipe as written. I used a smoked mozzarella ravioli and late summer vegetables purchased from my local farmers' market. I also subbed fresh heirloom cherry tomatoes for the canned version. Yum. I also used a mix of fresh mozzarella, provolone and Parmesan cheeses. This is probably the recipe I look most forward to at the end of fresh tomato/Farmers' Market season.

This recipe was totally banging awesome! I did a few changes, I did not use eggplant at all and I could not find frozen ravioli, well, I did but one contained muchrooms, ugh and the other was nearly 7 bucks so I used Hormel spinach and veggie raviloi. This was my first time making this particular version of this famous meal and I will do so again. This is well worth the time and money to make it so do it, you won't be sorry.

Such a great garden veggie recipe.  I've made this several times.  Our favorite variation is to omit the ravioli and put the mixture on angel hair pasta. YUMMY!

This has become a standard in my house. I make it so often that I don't measure anything anymore. It turns out a little different every time and always good! I've substituted fresh tomatoes and fresh basil when I have them. I also substitute summer squash for the zucchini sometimes. And I frequently use more of nearly everything than listed :) My only complaint is that this is a recipe that uses summer ingredients and the oven (which heats up the house). If I could find a way to do this entirely on the stove top, I would.

Eh, not so much; but easily spiced up to be good. Good for getting your veggies; but, as is, rather bland.

This came out delicious. Used home made goat cheese ravioli instead.  Will definitely make it again. Not the easiest and fastest dish possible, but worth the effort.

I made this recipe exactly as per the ingredients/instructions. It was very good, and the pasta made it a heartier meal. I packed up the leftovers and ate them for my lunches, and it still tasted good re-heated. Giving it a 4 instead of 5 only because I found the flavour a little bland, but I will make this dish again for sure.

Can't speak highly enough about this recipe!  I did add a can to crushed tomato because I wanted it to be a bit more saucy.  But overall stayed true to the recipe.  Couldn't find frozen ravioli so used refrigerated fresh and it turned out great.

Really good meatless meal. Did use fresh herbs, tomato sauce in addition to tomatoes and cheese tortellini instead of ravioli. A few tweaks but the same general idea. Used veggies listed but did not measure. Easy weeknight dinner.

i followed the recipe exactlly like it had said, and it was a little flavorless. My boyfriend liked it a little more than i did.. I felt like it was a little dry, needed maybe just a little more tomoato juice?! I did like the flavor of the vegtables. I probably wont be making this again, but if i was i would add more seasonings.

Love this recipe!  I can't find that size of ravioli so I buy 2 of the bigger bags (I thought it needed more ravioli, anyway) and add more of the other ingredients, then split into 2 pans and freeze one for later.

Everyone in my family enjoyed it! Even my picky little girls ages 2 and 4 years old. The only thing that was different was we could not find any zucchini so we left it out and our ravioli was homemade cheese and spinach.

Great!  I used a yellow squash, and added a little chicken broth to help cook down the vegetables.  The leftovers make a good next-day lunch.  I'll definitely keep this in the rotation.

This was so delicious! It is a great way to down a bunch of veggies and not feel like you're a rabbit. Very hearty. A great winter meal. Also works with tortellini for a fancier looking dish.

An excellent idea to use up fresh veggies from our local farm.  The only changes I made was to use a can of fire-roasted tomatoes to add a little flare, and I added a pinch of sugar to the veggies to cut the bitterness of the tomatoes and eggplant...next time I may also use more than 8 oz. ravioli to make it a bit more filling.  Otherwise a great meal!

This dish was really good. I have a neice and nephew who don't eat meat so I made this to go with our Christmas menu. Everyone ended up trying it and they all loved it. I sent the leftover home with my sister for her kids and my husband went looking in our fridge for  the leftovers. Looks like I will have to make it again just for him.

Very good!  Its similar to a recipe I have which has sausage in it. I like the addition of ravioli.  I used garlic salt instead of salt.  Very simple to make.  Will make again@

This meal was exceptional! Very good!Not a thing i would change. We used Grilled Chicken and cheese ravioli, but truly the veggies and melted cheese really made this dish. Yummy!

This recipe was phenomenal! I used 3 chees tortellini instead of ravioli, and roasted all the veggies instead of cooking them in a skillet. And it was even better the next day!! I think I'll add pumpkin or butternut squash with it next time....thank you for the great recipe!

YUM! This is a wonderful meal for a crisp fall night. The really nice thing about it is that it is easily altered. I didn't have a green pepper so I replaced it with a yellow squash. After having this once, I think mushrooms would go nicely in it as well.  Needless to say, it'll stay on our rotation!

Great vegetarian dish for this time of year with fresh eggplant, zucchini, peppers and tomatoes.  I replaced the canned tomatoes with fresh and used fresh herbs as well.

This was delicious!  I accidentally used a 16 oz bag of ravioli, but it was perfect (won't use 8 oz in the future).  I used fresh herbs and 3 big fresh tomatoes (instead of canned) because I had them on hand.  I realized I didn't have any mozzarella or provolone after I had assembled the dish, but it didn't matter - the flavor of the veggies and ravioli was enough to carry the meal.  We did add freshly grated parm at the table, though. Definitely a keeper!  Thanks so much for sharing it!

This recipe was amazing!  I used 2 cans of italian tomatoes and 1 tsp of basil, and 1 tsp of the parsley.  Also just a bit more mozzarella and sprinkled parmesan on top.  My entire family LOVED this meal and asked me to make if part of our regular meal routine.

This was a new way for me to use cheese ravioli and vegetables! I only had zucchini, so I used 4 cups,  since I had no eggplant.  I am going to try a few different variations  of  this, but all in all my family liked it!

Excellent... I add sweet sausage to the mix.  I also add an extra can of diced tomatos for more juice.  Excellent with french bread to dip.

This was a great way to eat lots of veggies, however, I think the eggplant was overpowering or maybe this is my first realization that I am not a fan of eggplant.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I did add some portobello mushrooms, a large can of diced tomatoes, a can of tomato paste and parmesan cheese.When my husband and daughter got home they both said what smells so good. It was certainly a hit and I will be making it again very soon. Tastes even better the next day. Thanks for sharing your recipe. It was fantastic.

I used just one eggplant.  Great and tasty way to get your veggies.  Next time I'm going to use perogies instead of cheese ravioli (trying to cut down on diary).

Modifications that I made: Also used fresh basil (in the tube, as store was out of the other) Added shitake mushrooms and a bit of extra salt. I probably also more than diced the veggies. I also used diced tomatoes with basil/garlic. Extra minced garlic also.  Very good!

This was pretty good- liked the addition of ravioli a lot. My husband didn't think it was filling enough, but he's a total meat guy; it was good for me! Will probably make again- oh, and I left out the eggplant and put in yellow squash...I'm not a huge fan of eggplant. Thanks for sharing!

This was a very satisfying meal. I added 1/2 a cup of red wine and 1 tablespoon of crushed red pepper flakes for some kick. We will definitely make this again- I think next time I will added some Italian sausage to it. Thanks for sharing.
