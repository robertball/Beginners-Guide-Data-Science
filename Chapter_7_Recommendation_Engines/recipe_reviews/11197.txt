Too rich and not in a good way. I even tried adding bananas (as one of the reviews said) but I didn't like it. My brother (who eats anything) said it was pretty good.  You should be the judge!!

I picked this recipe because it doesn't have eggs in it and I wanted to bake it with my toddler.  The flavor was too strong, almost bitter, and the texture made it hard to chew.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I won't be making this again.  On the plus side, the dough didn't taste as bad as the finished cookie, so it would be good if you want that raw dough taste without worrying about salmonella!

This recipe surprised me. I thought it would just taste like crunchy cookies but the butter and sugar caramelized a bit which gave them a slight toffee flavour. I didn't change anything in the recipe except to add a bit of cinnamon just because I felt like it. I cut it into bars with a pizza cutter as soon as it was out of the oven and it broke nicely into pieces when it cooled.  

I made it because I didn't have eggs but I will choose to make it again because it is yummy! Next time I'm going to see what they taste like with brown sugar instead of white. Thanks for the recipe!

It's a really good brittle.  I wanted cookies, but had no eggs - this was a good alternative.  Didn't blow my mind, but tasty just the same.

This is a very simple recipe with nice end results.  I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour.  I used salted buter and should have adjusted the amount of salt because it was a little too salty for me.  so, if you use salted butter either reduce or skip the salt in the recipe.  I used toasted pecans and it was wonderful.  I think I'll make this again with unsalted butter and possibly try almonds or walnuts to see which I like more.

This recipe is great.  It can also be made with Butterscotch Chips and Walnuts or Vanilla Chips and Macadamia Nuts.

Legitimately a better cookie dough recipe than it is a brittle one.

I originally made this recipe because I had no eggs. I love it and have made it a few times since then. Using real butter is a must--it makes them so good! I like to use mini chocolate chips. Also, after taking the cookie sheet out of the oven, I let it sit for a few minutes and, using a small sharp knife, cut the cookies into 1"x2" rectangles and let them cool completely. They look very nice on a plate.
