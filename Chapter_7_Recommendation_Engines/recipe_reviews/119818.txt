THis is the BEST salad I've made in a long time!  I made this for a family gathering and they ALL loved it - ages 12 to 75.  The second time I made it I used balsamic vinegar instead of white and found it a tiny bit tastier. I reduced the sugar by 1/2 and found it plenty sweet enough, in fact, the subtler sweetness made it more balanced.  Even without my changes this recipe is a 5 star!  It will be a hit anywhere you take it.  AND - don't be tempted to leave anything out every bite was perfect!

pretty good, and easy salad. i paid attention to the other reviewers comment about the sugar amount, and cut it to 2/3 cup, but it was still a wee bit too much. also, i only had miracle whip, and i would have preferred the flavor from hellman's. and just for personal reasons, i used sunflower seeds instead of walnuts. i had a lot of wonderful comments from my family, and they asked me to make this again in the future. thanks for the recipe!

I'm enjoying it now - couldn't wait for it to chill! Incorporated some of the suggestions I read from others, & combined w/ my mom's version:  substitute chopped apple for peppers, decrease to ½ cup chopped red onion & ¼ cup sugar, use balsamic vinegar, 6 slices crumbled crisp-cooked bacon, & toast the walnuts. Voila!

The dressing on this salad is PERFECT-- exactly what I was looking for. Way too much onion, though. I only added about 1/3 of an onion (1/4-1/3 cup) and it was still too much. Next time, I'm going to do two Tbsp of red onion instead. Also, cut the broccoli into small pieces (dime- and nickle-sized). I left mine quarter-sized, and they were a bit too crunchy, even on day two. The walnuts are a very tasty addition, and even with the mega onion breath afterward, it was a family pleaser. I'll make this one again and again.

YUM! I used red pepper instead of green, light mayo, and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. Really great salad, although most of it is still left over from our 5 person dinner. I guess some people just don't like raw broccoli. I, however, love it!

This was okay.  Didn't blow me away.  I used cranberries instead of raisins and added some sweet Vidalia onions to it.  Next time, I will probably give a finer chop to the broccoli.

Great recipe! I decrease the amount of onion, just because my family doesnt like too strong of an onion taste. I also used sunflower seeds instead of walnuts. When it seemed that I ddint have quite enough dressing to cover the veggies, I squirted in a few Tbsp of creamy poppy seed dressing.
