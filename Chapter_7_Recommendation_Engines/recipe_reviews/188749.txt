This drink is amazing!  Even people who aren't particularly fond of mixed drinks will love this.  I might actually make it the signature cocktail at my wedding :).

This looked easier than my standby recipe for cosmopolitan punch so I gave it a whirl and am glad I did.  It was more colorful and way more flavorful.  Used this for a New Year's party and it was a success.  A few guests felt the vodka taste was too strong, a simple solution was filling their glasses halfway and topping off with lemon lime soda or ginger ale.  Perfect recipe for parties!
