Very tasty recipe. Because they were optional, I didn't add the peppers. Hubby and I ate almost every bite. Served it over baby red potatoes, and corn on the cob on the side. Wonderful balance of flavors.

This has to be one of the best liver and onion recipes I've ever used. Even my 11 yr old son w/ autism loves this! The only change I made was to leave out the bell peppers as he does not like them. Thanks beadanurse for a great recipe!

Onion gravy was spectacular...used all ingredients listed.  Disappointed with the liver...I usually quick saute my liver...this time followed direction and left it in as I added the sauce to thicken...liver was tough.  Next time will prepare seperate and serve with this delicious gravy/sauce.

Oh My Goodness...I recently found an awesome deal on calf's liver and bought about twenty pounds to freeze (yes, we love liver)so I've been experimenting with all the liver recipes here.  Well, I think I have found my favorite!!  This is so delicious. I was skeptical since I have never made liver without a flour breading or with mushrooms but skeptic I am no more! My 15 year old daughter is the only one in our house that claimed to hate liver and refused to eat it but when she reluctantly tasted this, she declared she now loves it and has asked for this again already.  We are planning her sweet 16 party and her best friend was over here and when I asked them what they wanted for supper, she asked me to make this for her friend!!! That is a true testament to the success for a recipe.  The absolute only change I made and recommend to this great recipe is to soak the liver in milk for an hour or so to take out the stereotypical strong bitter flavor.  I actually love that flavor since I grew up eating it that way but my family prefers the milder taste. Thank you beadanurse for passing this gem onto all of us!

If you soak the liver in milk about an hour b4 cooking it takes some of the stong liver tast away. Other then that this recipe is spot on yummy!

I make this all the time and love it. I even tried it on one of my friends who is so not into Liver. He ate it and then asked me to confirm whether or not it was Liver. He couldn't even tell. I love Liver but do not like the taste it has if you don't season it right. This recipe covers all the basics. Thank you for sharing.

For folks who say the liver was a bit tough be sure you are using calve's liver that has been skinnex & deveined. There are a lot of tough thick livers in the meat cases these days.

This was my first time cooking liver, and I picked this recipe for guidance. I didn't have bell peppers, so it was just liver and onions. I had a small salad and biscuits with it. It was awesome! I was wondering if I would get the "bad smell" people talk about when cooking liver, but I never got it. It smelled great! Husband approved, and the biscuits were great for mopping up leftover gravy. I will definitely try this again sometime with the peppers.

A great recipe for anyone with an assortment of vegetables looming in their refrigerator waiting to be tastefully used. All you need is some elbow grease and a good knife and you'll soon be enjoying a nutritious meal of one of my favorite cuts.

Fantastic.  Never thought of putting peppers in the gravey for my beef liver this recipe, peppers and all, made for an outstanding combination.  One big change- as this was Irish liver and onions, I tossed the red wine for Killian's Red.

Great basic recipe. Added bacon and fennel when cooking the onions. Like another reviewer had never cooked liver without flooring but am glad I took the chance. Another keeper

The sauce for this is fantastic! The onions and liver are good, too, but the sauce was my favorite. The best liver and onions recipe I've made. I'll definitely use this again.

swapped out the Red Peppers for Orange ones and didn't add the optional mushrooms, which perfected the  balance of sweetness to bitterness

Haven't made this recipe yet, but have made something similar. Three tablespoons of chopped bell pepper is not enough. If you love bell peppers and onions together, I suggest you add 2-4  sliced bell pepper and saute with oinions. It is delicious that way. Will  be trying this soon.

It's not exactly how I make this but very close and it's the only way I make it. I only use calf's liver. I do the onion in butter until it's clean, then then add the mushrooms and red wine and put the calves liver on top only for a few minutes. My favorite way of doing it. I don't use peppers in mine.

Turned out delicious. I  used sliced calf liver and soaked it in milk. For an hour before cooking. I was careful not to over cook it as that would have been disaster ours.
Loved by all and will definitely do again.

This was an amazing recipe. I had never made liver with gravy before. I omitted the bell peppers only because I neglected to buy any when I bought the liver. I also forgot to put in any wine. Not sure I even have any.  I will be making this again and will try it with the bell peppers next time. I did take a picture but for some reason the site keeps telling me we did not get your photo try submitting it again. Over and over again. Ah well. I will share my photo on facebook and my review as well. Loved this.

Amazing recipe.  I got sick of liver and onions as a kid because we had it quite regularly and I'll admit I haven't had liver and onions in about 25 years till I tried this recipe and fell in love with it again.

My dad enjoyed the recipe as well and said it reminded him of the way his mother made liver and onions when he was a child.

I've got 2 more packs of calf liver in the freezer and i'll be using this recipe for those two packs as well
Thanks for sharing it.

I  cooked the onions and mushrooms in garlic butter instead of adding garlic to the oil. Added chicken base is all I had and a little bit of worshestire sauce other then that I followed the recipe with the amount of flour and water. I did not add the peppers . Broiled the liver with steak spices.
It was very good.

with thin sliced liver you must subtract on cooking time (1/2 of stated time). otherwise the dish was okay but i've done better and will go back to my regular recipe.

I sautéed the onions mushrooms and garlic in butter then set it aside.  Lightly fried the flour covered liver then mixed corn starch with beef boullion a teaspoon of honey and wine, added the sautéed mixture and wine mixture into the pan with the liver. Cooked it for five minutes and it was delicious.

I made this for my husband, and though I didn't try it, I have to give it the full 5 stars for his reaction.  I had no peppers, nor did I have any mushrooms, but otherwise made this pretty much as is.  I did  follow a suggestion from years ago to soak the liver first in milk for about an hour.  I did dredge the meat in flour seasoned with salt and pepper when frying, too.  My husband really loved the gravy. I will make this again exactly as written. Thanks for a special dish!

This is the best liver and onion recipe we have had.  And is now my go-to recipe.  I used lamb liver instead of calf.

I'm recently widowed and trying to feed myself.  My wife was a great cook but I have to say that was the best liver and onions I've ever had and I been eating them for 69 years.
