This was surprisingly wonderful! I wanted to give anchovies another chance after hating them since childhood. I made half a batch, because I knew our kids wouldn't try it. Aside from that, my only tweaks were to saute my onion a little and add some flat-leaf parsley and black pepper. Had it with a nice spinach salad for a really good, inexpensive meal. Thanks!

I've been living/working in Sweden over the past year and some and I am starting a collection of Swedish recipes for when my Swedish boyfriend and I move to Canada. I figure a little Swedish cooking will help him feel more at home (he's never been to Canada). This recipe is alot simpler than many you find for Janssons Temptation, and suprisingly it tastes just as good as any you can have in Sweden. Thanks for sharing, this is a definate keeper!!

What a great recipe!  It was very good to end the evening with such a tasteful dish.  Highly recommended for parties or just an evening meal.

Yum, yum, yum -- great comfort food. I love the extra layer of flavor from the anchovies.  My husband loves this, too, and he has no idea there are anchovies in it.  This was wonderful with braised and buttered cabbage. I had to cut the recipe way down since there are only two in my household.  Four potatoes, 8 anchovies, and I used half/half for the cream. I might use just a bit fewer anchovies next time.  I enjoy stories so thought I'd share this story I found about Mr. Janssen and his tempting dish:  http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-first-catch-your-anchovies-1295644.html

This was our first time trying anchovies.  As a general rule we like fish, though a couple in the family are not fond of fish.  This dish, however, cooked up very mild with a slight taste of fish...but different.  Everyone ate it, most had seconds, and I will be cooking it again.  We enjoyed it with some bacon wrapped asparagus and the two proved to be quite filling.

Janssen's Temptation is a cool weather favorite in my family.  Just don't tell anyone about the fish until afterwards. This recipe is a lot simpler than the one I had in my box.

This was great!  Very easy, too.  I wasn't sure which type of potatoes to use (russet, red, white, etc.), so I used the small white ones. Glad I did - the amount called for in the recipe was perfect.  I took the lazy way out and chopped the onions in my food processor - turned out fine.  I used 12 anchovies instead of 20, and I liked it - it was not overly fishy that way.  This dish was a hit at a Swedish Christmas party (julfest) I attended.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really like anchovies, so I knew I would like this dish -- I could definitely taste them!  This dish is filling, easy and cheap. I used 1 Idaho potato, 1 onion, 1 tin of anchovies and about 1/3 pint of heavy cream.

Very good and very hearty! I would reduce the anchovies by 1/4 but otherwise it is great! Even better the next day!
