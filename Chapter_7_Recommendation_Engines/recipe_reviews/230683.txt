Absolutely the best recipe for cornbread that I have tried.  I find
it hilarious that people say they love the recipes, then tell how
they changed it.  This moist cornbread recipe can't be improved on...period!

This is, hands down, the best cornbread recipe I have ever had!  Very moist and flavorful.  I substituted 2 cups of plain, fat free yogurt for the 2 cups of sour cream.  It was still fantastic without the added fat.

I made this cornbread without the sugar. It was very good, I don't understand why everyone must add so much sugar to all of theses recipes. I don't like sweet anything, my opinion; sugar it detracts from the great flavors of other ingredients.

I am not a big fan of sweet cornbread but my family is.  So I compromised and halved the sugar. We all loved it. One of the best homemade corn breads I have ever made.

Of the vast array of Cornbread Recipes I have tried over the years (& I've been cookin' for 45+ yrs) this is Hands-Down THE VERY BEST Cornbread Recipe In Existence.  No Contest!! You could add some corn or some finely chopped green/red pepper or jalapeno but this is the recipe to start with!  Thank You so much!  My search for Perfect Homemade Cornbread has come to a screeching halt!!

Just made this, but with a few substitutions to make it less sweet, more savory, and healthier. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream (as I do in most baked recipes calling for sour cream), 1/2 the butter, no sugar, and a few Tbs honey. Oh, and I added chopped onions and frozen corn. It was very good!

I added a chopped jalpeno pepper, and 1/4 cup each of grated cheddar and diced crisp bacon pieces.  The sweet and savory was great.

Moist, moist, moist. It must be the sour cream, this was definitely the best pan of cornbread I've ever turned out. I'm a very average baker though ;). I made exactly as directed and kept covered in the fridge, we are still enjoying pieces several days later. In the future I'll probably half the recipe as there are usually just two people eating, that's the only possible change I would make. Thanks for sharing!

Greatest corn bread recipe I've ever tried.  Have already made it 3 times this week. The measurements are so easy I've already memorized them.  One step I do slightly differently.  I add all wet ingredients in a separate bowl, whisk gently to combine, then add to the whisked dry ingredients.  This makes it easier to mix wet and dry requiring less mixing thereby making the bread more tender and what is one more dish to wash.  Have used fine ground corn meal and looking forward to more course grind.  Thanks for the post.

Halved recipe and baked in 9" cast iron skillet for 25 minutes.  Made as directed with exception of dropping sugar to 1/2 cup (for half batch).  Beautiful rise, nice and moist, but a bit too sweet for our tastes.  Has a pronounced corn taste.  Note to self: when making again, use 1 1/3 flour, 2/3 cornmeal, and cut sugar to scant scant 1/2 cup ... try 6T butter?

Yep, my new favorite cornbread recipe! I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 baking dish. I did not have enough sour cream, so I used fat free yogurt and light sour cream! Yum! It's good as is, but will try it reducing sugar next time, sometimes I want sweet, and sometimes not so sweet...depends on what I'm eating with it.

Well.  To start, cornbread is as important... and controversial... as the chili its paired with.  I use several different recipes, depending on what it's going with.  Today I was just browsing, looking for something I hadn't tried yet to go with my Firehouse chili.  "Sour cream" caught my eye.  I've used it in many things to maintain moisture.  Quick breads, sandwich bread, muffins, etc.  So I was not surprised when these muffins turned out moist yet properly cornbread crumbly, perfect golden color, perfect golden light crust on top, perfect sweetness.  I must admit my hand automatically reached for the homegrown honey jar rather than all that sugar... I restrained myself to just a tablespoon of honey in a halved recipe, and used only 1/4 the sugar.  Only real change I made.  And that was only b/c I was unscrewing the top of the honey jar before I realized what I was doing.  :)  Very good recipe.  Used unbleached flour, worked fine.  Used light sour cream, worked fine.  Used homegrown brown and blue eggs, worked fine... probably added to the richness of the color, as they are much darker than commercial white eggs. Muffins baked just through at 375 for 27 minutes.  Easy, fast, yummy.  My 4 y/o son scarfed FOUR in as many minutes.  Will use again.  Thank you!

Simply awesome!  Not a huge cornbread fan - due to issues with dryness or texture (in creamed corn recipes).  Not so here!  I made a 1/2 batch in a regular loaf pan with 1/4 of the sugar (not a fan of the sweet cornbreads either) and had to substitute some cottage cheese for sour cream.  (Dropped the baking temp down 25 degrees and baked it a bit longer too)  The family went crazy over it!  Perfect with chili and cilantro cabbage slaw.   YUMMMMM!

I made this with a scant cup of lucuma powder instead of the sugar and it was wonderful alongside a stew! We also did millet flour instead of the cornmeal and gluten-free all-purpose flour instead of the regular. Finally, I couldn't find sour cream so did a mix of coconut cream and apple cider vinegar. Delicious!

I thought this was way too rich. Too much sugar, sour cream, butter, and eggs. Almost like a cake. I prefer the "Sweet Cornbread" recipe, which is actually much less sweet than this one.

This recipe reminds me of the cornbread my southern American relatives made me.  The texture is springy and the bread moist.  It has a lovely taste, with the corn flavor coming through so well.  For me, this is the perfect cornbread recipe.

I only used 1 cup of sugar as other reviewers suggested, and half sour cream and half Greek yogurt (had less sour cream than I throught) and it turned out delicious. I think it would be too sweet with the whole amount of sugar unless it was for a dessert.  Made it in two 9" cake pans and froze one to have another day.  Was great with chili, and would be equally good as dessert with maple syrup poured over it.

This was the best cornbread I've ever had.  I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9X9 pan.  I'll probably cut the sugar back just a bit next time.

I halved the recipe to make an 8 x 8 pan.  And I left out ALL sugar - my family does NOT like sweet cornbread.  This was sooo good!!!  My new "go to" cornbread recipe.  Made a second time (no sugar) and threw in a handful of bacon bits, cheddar cheese and chopped jalapenos.  The best mexican cornbread I've tried.

Great recipe. My suggestions would is for those of you who tried the recipe or will try it, dont assume 30-35mn, watch for it to look golden on the top like other cornbread. It took my oven 45mn. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is a fantastic cornbread recipe.  My husband thought I must have used a box mix.  The only change was reducing the sugar just a little since my husband is not a fan of sweet things.  I was afraid it would be too sweet for him.

This is the best cornbread I have ever made!!! It went over very well at the barbeque we were invited to.  The hostess said "this is real cornbread! When I asked you to bring some, I thought it would be out of the box!"  Everyone loved it! I made it exactly as written.
Thanks for a great recipe!

Would definitely make again, except I'd divide the sum ingredients by half; this makes a huge cornbread.  This is an exceptionally good, Southern, sweet bread.  It was scrumptious hot and fresh from the oven and warms nicely as leftovers.

What the other people said. The sour cream does something special.  Half recipe is plenty for a regular sized pie pan or 12 muffins.

Made four versions of muffins from this recipe: “as is”, with blueberries, with banana and with jalapeño & cheddar. All turned out fantastic; thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't make any changes and I will definitely make this again and again! It is perfect. Just the right touch of sweetness and the texture is the best I've ever had. I have tried a lot of cornbread in my life but this is going to be MY cornbread from now on.

Excellent cornbread recipe - moist, tender and flavorful with a great crusty bottom and sides.  I add chopped green chili (NOT canned) or jalapeños.

Out of all the recipes for cornbread I’ve made (and I’ve tried three), this one is by far the best. It has more in terms of ingredients and though others say to use a 9x13 pan, this one actually fills the pan well when baked. It is dense but airy. I reduced the sugar by a 1/3 and it was a vaguely sweet bread, which I liked. Throw a bit of butter on it and it is heaven!

It may sound odd but I made this exactly like the recipe calls for.
Was it perfect?  near.
It came out of the oven at midnight and by 1 A.M. I wanted to cover it and go to bed. This may have been a bad idea as in the morning it had fallen somewhat and it ended up with a soggy layer throughout  the middle portion. The edges were unaffected and the whole thing was eaten.
It had passed the toothpick test and I had baked it 32 minutes in a ceramic Corelle baking pan. The Corelle doesn't cool nearly as fast as metal and was warm to touch an hour out of the oven.
I'm open to suggestions...

I've made this twice and my review is based on the first time I made it. I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was easy to put together and baked up well. It was a little sweeter than I care for and not "corny" enough for my taste, but it was still very tasty. 

The second time I made it I increased the cornmeal to 2-1/2 cups and reduced the flour to 1-1/2 cups. I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup and wound up with cornbread that was more to my taste.

1/4 of this recipe made 8 regular-sized muffins, perfect amount for my family.  I used 1/4 cup sugar, and it was still quite sweet with the rest of the ingredients quartered.

This is the only cornbread our oldest daughter will eat.  We went to New Orleans a few summers ago for a mission trip.  While there we ate several authentic  N'rleans meals.  They had cornbread one night and our daughter, who does not like cornbread, ate 3 helpings!  LOL  I made this to go with soup and she said this was just as good if not better as the cornbread she had that night, so this is now my go to recipe.  My only change is to use greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  Very good!

I don't write reviews but this recipe is the one.

I had two changes mainly from a lack of preparation on my part. Only one cup of sugar, that was all I had on hand. I also used white corn meal because I didn't notice what I bought at the store.  It came out perfectly moist, although the cooking time ran 40 minutes.  I baked it in a large cast iron pan which was preheated in the oven at 375.

My rating is based on the result after replacing the sour cream with fat free Fage and replacing 1/2 the melted butter with canola oil  It sounded delicious as it was but just too unhealthy.  Next time I will probably try the recipe unaltered. It was moist but not as moist as some recipes I've made.  I like my cornbread choke-free moist.

Absolutely delicious! Just made it and it will definitely be my go to recipe for cornbread. I halved it just because there are only two of us in the house who will eat it...but now I'm wishing I had made the whole recipe. I added jalapenos just to get some of the ones we have used up. Make this! You won't be disappointed!

This gets 5 stars because it's the only cornbread that my 14 year old has been willing to eat!  I really like it too, but don't always have the sour cream on hand, so will only make when I do.

Yummy! I made this with plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and baked it in my electric skillet. It was so delicious! My kids didn't eat much of the Chili I made with it because they just wanted the cornbread!

I do not like the taste of too much butter so I reduced my butter by half. It turned out very well. The bread is fragrant and fluffy, the crust tastes a bit like cookie and you can still taste the buttery flavor. I understand cornbread is not the healthiest food...so reducing the butter makes me feel a little better :p

I made it twice - both times with GF flour.  First time I overbaked it a bit so it was dry to me but everyone still seemed to like it.  The second time I was more careful to not overbake it and it was more moist and delicious.

I've only made this 3 times, but it tastes better at each sitting! This last time, I decided to add whole kernels of sweet corn to it. My family asked why with much concern as they continued to go back for more. This is always going to be my go to recipe for cornbread.

The. Best. Cornbread. 
I used brown sugar instead of white and next time might use half egg whites because it’s a little eggy for me with all 4 eggs but seriously amazing cornbread. My entire family was in love!

I planned on making this as recipe was written,but I was short on cornmeal by about one third cup. Since I had some grits I added one third cup of that. I don't care for sweet cornbread so I only used three quarter cup of sugar. I always check the recipe after I have it mixed. Low and behold,I used baking powder mistakenly,so I added 1 tsp baking soda. I tasted the batter and to me it was still a little sweet,so I sprinkled a bit more salt in. I was not sure how it would turn out,but it was scrumptious! I've been baking over 50 years,so I kind of know what to do when I screw up a recipe. Again,it was delicious.

This cornbread was perfection. Better than my friends recipe with bacon fryin’s.
I read reviews and used 3/4 c sugar.
Sweet but not sugary so you can still taste the sour cream and corn. This will be a go to going forward. Thank you!

I made 1/2 recipe since I am the cornbread eater. It is great, right now I have 2 pkgs ready for the freezer for that next corn bread urge or my next chili splurge. Oh yeah, i did cut back on the sugar a bit and still totally delicious. Great recipe!

I love this recipe! It's the only one I use anymore. I usually make it with chili and leftovers with butter are just as good. Sometimes I add a can of drained corn to the batter if I have it.

This recipe does not need any changes. I added corn but I think it would have been better without. I also made honey butter to go with it, but ended up not using it because the bread was so sweet and moist.

I was excited about this after reading the reviews. However, mine came out on the dry side. Rise flavor look and ease of this cornbread can’t be beat!! I think next time I will add some milk.

Halved the recipe using 1/4 cup sugar and 1/3 cup butter. Filled 12 muffin cups, baked 25 minutes. Served with black bean soup and the avocado salad from this site. Delicious!

Made this last night. Perfect! Great base recipe!! I added one can of whole kernel corn and 2 c cheese. I also baked in my cast iron skillet. I’ve got the large 12 in. I melted bacon fat in the pan and allowed the grease to get hot in the oven. When the oven reached 375, pulled the skillet out, pored the batter into the skillet, and 30 mins later, Voila! Served for our “Friendsmas” with spicy chili and it was a crowd favorite!!! Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loved it. It was a little too sweet for me, so I may cut the sugar next time, but I had everyone at the party clamoring for the last piece.

Loved this easy recipe. I opted to make muffins and when they came out of the oven I drizzled a little more melted butter on top. Made them extra yummy!

A little worried, the batter tasted just like a sugar cookie.  But the final product is good.  Im going to make with a tad less flour, and more corn meal and only 3/4 cup of sugar next time.  I bet that will make it better for us.  Thanks!

I used 1 stick of butter  only as other reviewers suggested. Instead of the additional butter,  I added shredded cheddar cheese. I substituted plain greek yogurt for the sour cream (less fat, more protein) . I used 1/2 the sugar also.Those that ate the cornbread  were  very complimentary.

Wow, Emily Hughes, what a fantastic recipe!  This cornbread recipe is a keeper.  It goes great with chili.  It makes a very large portion in the 9 X 13 inch pan, and you'll be able to enjoy leftovers.  I was able to easily tweak the recipe by using a sugar / stevia baking blend (Truvia) and light sour cream to reduce the fat.  The recipe produces a nice thick cornbread.  I found that that your fingers can feel a bit greasy when picking up a square, and it seems to be from the cup of butter that the recipe calls for, which is two full sticks.  Next time, I'm going to try to reduce the amount of butter by one fourth or even one third.  Thank you for such a tasty recipe, Emily Hughes.

This is a top notch recipe for sour cream corm bread. Well done! I cut the recipe in half and added half a can of corn and well... I don't want to go so far as say that it was life changing but it was  good. So add that little extra juicy crunch and you'll be looking at a 5-star recipe.

It's cornbread.  Nothing spectacular but not dry and crumbly either, which is a problem with many cornbread recipes.

Edit:  I rated this three stars at first and wrote the review above.  After sitting overnight, though, this stuff is GOOD...very moist and delicious.  I'd give it five stars, but I don't want to have to make corn bread a day ahead of serving it.

Delicious and moist!  I don't like cornbread because it's usually so dry.  I made this for my boyfriend (a cornbread fan) and we both liked it.  I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup and used light sour cream.

It is amazing how something so simple can taste so good.  This is absolutely one of the best cornbread recipes I have ever tasted.  I followed the instructions as noted and it turned out perfect.  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a light, fluffy and slightly sweet bread. Delicious!!!

It turned out well, but was a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I will use less sugar. I cooked the cornbread in a 12 inch cast iron skillet, and this required 50 minutes before it was ready.

I have a sweet tooth so this recipe was perfect for me!   Great for breakfast with butter and honey!  I might use my stand mixer next time. It was a bit difficult for me to blend dry with the wet ingredients.   I baked them large muffin tins.

Perfect recipe! I used Greek yogurt in place of sour cream and I used only 1 cup sugar. It wasn't too sweet and I've even substituted with coconut sugar. I put it in 2 round dishes and it was definitely done in 30 minutes.

This is my go-to recipe for Cornbread. It's always moist on the inside, and has that just baked crispiness on the edges. It pairs wonderfully with chili, and the flavor is full and delish!

Cut down the sugar a bit.  This was really good with chili!  I think we may prefer having pieces of corn in the future though.  I would make this again if I needed a good basic recipe!  It kept on the counter for several days..... more than my jeans would have liked ;)

I grudgingly gave this 4 stars, although it probably should have been 3. This was by no means the best cornbread I've ever had.  

I halved the recipe (thank goodness) and put it in an 8x8 pan, which may have contributed to the fact that it seemed overdone. In an attempt to fix it, I rubbed butter over the top. It was just okay.

OMG!!!! The only thing I did different was substitute coconut oil in lieu of butter but everything else was the same and this turned out to be the BEST cornbread I've ever had. The entire family was in love as well, I can just see myself making this constantly :)

My fave  cornbread.  hubby and kids ate it up and wanted more!  
Didn't use eggs, because I was out of them.  I added water just to get  mix wet (about the equivalent of 1 cuo).  Baked up beautiful.  Very moist.  Not dry or crumbly.  Held together perfect.

This was great corn bread!  We thought it was very much like Black Eyed Pea corn bread.  I reduced the sugar to 2 Tbsp as we prefer to eat our corn bread hot with butter and honey.  I did have add 1/8 of a cup of milk to get the dry ingredients to incorporate better but otherwise, delicious.

Followed the recipe exactly, except halved the quantity and baked in an 8x8 pan. Dense and cakelike, this reminds me of the treat my grandmother used to make for us when we visited. Low lactose from the sour cream makes it a perfect recipe for my friend who can't take milk. Great reviews from my friends, including "perfect with chili" and "great with coffee the next morning". For more traditional, less sweet, cornbread I would suggest a recipe that includes milk and less sugar. I'll likely stick with this as my go-to for cornbread. Thanks for the recipe!

01-04-16 ~ Needing a cornbread to go with chili, I chose this one.  I made a half recipe and then split it, one with jalapeños and one as the recipe states without jalapeños.  It baked up great in both pans and was a nice addition to the chili.  When I halved the recipe, I did only use 1/2 cup of sugar.

Loved it!  Have only made the recipe on the Corn Meal box before (30 years).  This is similar, but a little more sugar and sour cream instead of milk (much more moist)!  Try it - you'll be glad you did!

This was a fantastic side to our fave chili.  Made an entire 9 x 13"  pan.  I made it gluten free by using King Arthur GF flour mix and a few teaspoons of xanthan gum.  I also threw in some Trader Joe's corn salsa (about 1/2 cup) for texture.  It was amazing.  Will definitely make again.

The best corn bread recipe around.  The sour cream is a must.  It makes the bread unbelievably moist.  I have made it several times, and have added jalepenos to half of the pan for those of us that like an extra kick.  Forget about the boxed mixes forever!

Be sure to use FINE GROUND corn meal. I used Bobs Red Mill medium ground and it was too coarse.

Followed the recipe exact, but since it's just the two of us I halved the recipe. Served it with pinto beans, it was moist and didn't crumble like most corn breads, held together nicely. next time I think I will cut down on the sugar a bit, and double the salt, as I like a more savory corn bread.

Rated four stars only because I changed the recipe, so I can't speak to the original recipe. ;) I followed everything to a "t", except made the following changes: halved the recipe, cooked in a 9 x 9 glass brownie pan, mixed half sour cream/half yogurt and brought both the sour cream/yogurt and eggs to room temp before mixing. Instead of sugar, I used 1/3 cup of raw local honey. Baked at 375 for 20 minutes, rotating once for even baking. It was perfect. Super moist, not too sweet and a bit savory. Love it. Will make again!

I made this some time this past February for work. We were having a chili cook off and someone asked if I can make cornbread.  Since it was for a big group, I multiplied the recipe twice.  It was a hit!  perfect crumble and moisture. No left overs and people kept stopping by my office to tell me how great it was.  I also saw a few people take a plate home.  =) Im going to make this again tomorrow for a bonfire!

Hate to be cliche, but yup, like other reviewers mentioned... BEST cornbread recipe.  And I've tried several on here and elsewhere.  This was the texture I was looking for, moist without being too dense, good flavor.  And I know this is to the chagrin of most people, but I made this recipe tonight - first time - and i made a few sub'ns.  Halving it to fit our family, I used up the last of my plain Greek yogurt (approx 1 cup), but only because that was what I had on hand and I wasn't about to go out to store just for sour cream (that we don't consume often anyway).  Also used 1/2 sprouted wheat flour and half AP flour, and a smidgen less sugar.  Batter seemed a little thick so added a splash of milk, prob from the yogurt.  I promise next time I make it I'll follow recipe to a T, but considering it was a last minute decision to make cornbread with what I had on hand...this was already good.  No doubt it'll be even better next time!  Never seen my kids eat so much cornbread in one sitting!

The best recipe hands down. i get so many compliments on this cornbread, even from those who hate cornbread. this is a high requested food in my home. We use Pamelas Gluten Free Baking Mix instead of flour and my husband likes it better then the regular flour version.

This was the best cornbread I've ever had!  I did not melt the butter enough so it went to the bottom and was bubbling away when I looked in the oven - the middle of my pan (I halved the recipe and used an 8x8) a bit soggy but not bad at all (we were eating it for breakfast with syrup).  This will be my cornbread recipe going forward - it was delicious!  Husband loved it, too!

This was moist and delicious. To make it a little healthier, I used yoghurt instead of sour cream, cut the sugar to 1 cup, and the butter (I used oil) to 2/3 cups. My family enjoyed it even when it was lightened.

Family loved this cornbread. I am a calorie saver so I halved the sugar as I thought it would be too sweet and used fat free sour cream. I am glad I did. It was still sweet enough. Leftover cornbread froze well. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is hands down the best cornbread I've ever made. Very moist and sweet on the inside and buttery crispy on the outside. I halved the recipe for a 9 in pan and baked for 25 min. Came out perfect!

Very moist. My family loved it!  As suggested, I substituted the sour cream with yogurt and cut the sugar down to 2 tablespoons.

Great bread!  Very moist, tasty and a great texture.  I haven't had luck finding a corn bread to settle on but this will qualify.  Made exactly as written (except for a half recipe in an 8x8 pan-same cooking time).  Now that I've tried it I can try the yogurt, decreased sugar variations to make less calories but this was quite fine as is.  Hubby ate a bunch and he is not a big corn bread fan.  Served with Ellie11's "Delicious Ham and Potatoe Soup" form AR-a good pairing!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  I cut back on the sugar (used 1/2 cup) and butter (used 1/2 cup) and sub'd fat free plain yogurt for the sour cream.  Magnificent.  (And more than sweet enough.)

This is a good recipe and easy to make. Great way to use up sour cream and yogurt.  I followed others suggestions and cut the sugar to 1 cup.  Thanks for sharing

I will definitely used this cornbread recipe again.  The moistness is what makes it stand out from the rest.
