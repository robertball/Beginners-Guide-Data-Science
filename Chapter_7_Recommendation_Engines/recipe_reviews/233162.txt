Made these today with 3 pre-schoolers.  Very easy dough to make and handle and kept the shape quite well.  Maybe because it calls for confectioner's sugar instead of granulated.  We didn't let these chill for more than 20 minutes and they were still fine.  They were also delicious and were eaten up while they were still too hot to hold.  This recipe will stay in the recipe box for a long time.

These cookies are very good! I just picked up a few new cookie cutters and I wanted to 'test' them out. This recipe was perfect because besides being super simple to mix up, it makes a smaller batch, and that's just what I was looking for. These kept their shape well and have a great buttery flavor. They do sort of 'puff' a bit, but do not spread. The kids are really enjoying being the taste testers too! Though these will not replace my favorite cut-out cookie recipe, I will def be making them again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I will never, ever be afraid to make roll out cookies again! I have never had any luck making cut out cookies-they dough always breaks apart. This recipe was easy, tasty and made perfect cut out Teddy Bear cookies for my granddaughter's birthday. Next time I will double the recipe because it only makes a small batch. Thank you Sarah for making the impossible for me possible.

I tried many other cookie dough recipes, but returned to this one. It's a good recipe to make a small batch. 4 stars because I had to do a couple modifications to fit my taste:
3/4 cups of conf. sugar instead of 1/2 cup, 1 full stick butter instead 6 tbsp. What I love about the recipe is the taste of cookies, not too crumbly with a little crisp and easy ingrediens. Also, this dough is versatile. I tried it with a cookie press right after mixing ingredients - great results! Now, my modified version of this recipe is my to go recipe for baking spritz or roll out cookies. Oh, try to substitute 1/2 cup of flour with cocoa powder - you'll get wonderful chocolate cookies !! Definitely try this recipe !

Such an easy recipe! I added a little pumpkin spice seasoning and made small cut out cookies for Thanksgiving. I like this recipe because the cookies are not too sweet. They kind of taste like shortbread cookies.

Made multiple times and find the dough is easy to work with but hard to flavor and dry without icing.  Last time I used both vanilla extract and a scrapped vanilla bean but still needed a flavor boost.  Used the recipe "Sugar cookie Icing" by JBS Box and that made all the difference!  My 11-year old son suggested lemon the next try.

This batter was easy to put together but the cookies were really dry! They were more like crackers than cookies. So disappointing.

I will say these cookies were just ok for me...I chose this recipe because I liked the fact it made a small  batch of cookies and I was out of regular  and only hhad powder sugar so I thought i found a winner! esp ecially once I read all the wonderful reviews Hmmmm Im not sure what went wrong I follwed the recipe to a T I had to add a cup  or more of flour I just wasnt all that impressed with the flavor either I will say i tried one a couple hours after baking and they tasted much better...I would use this recipe again if i was in a pinch and I was out of regular sugar...

When I first started mixing the powdered sugar and butter, I didn't think it was going to turn out. But to my surprise, it turned out wonderfully! The dough was great to work with, held its shape with all the cut outs, wasn't sticky and kept the shape while baking.  I read another review that said these weren't sweet enough, but they are! I wouldn't add any more sugar, you don't need it. The cookies are sweet on their own plus the frosting on top. I think these taste great and so do my kids.

Certainly easy enough to make.  I let the dough chill for about a half hour before rolling out and it was fine.  Haven't tasted them yet but, so far so good.

I made these for Halloween last year, and Christmas, and now again for spring! Everyone who has ever had them loves the taste, and I love how easy the recipe is! I also love how I can just leave the dough in the oven overnight if I have to since life happens, and I can't always make them the same day I start them. This is my favorite cut out recipe!

Super easy to mix and cut out.  I didn't break a single cookie!  Delicious!
