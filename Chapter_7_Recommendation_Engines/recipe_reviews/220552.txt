I made this recipe with a few substitutions: I had no navel oranges so used a can of mandarin oranges.  I also had red bell pepper and 1 orange and 1 yellow anaheim and 1 jalapeno.  Everything else was the same.  It made for a gorgeous salad and was quite delish!  Served it with my homemade tortilla soup.  It was perfect and even better the next day.

We paired this with burgers, and it provided great balance. This salad has a fantastic, simple flavor, and it's beautiful. I recommend adding a splash of oj and red wine vinegar if you like your salad with a little dressing.

This is GREAT!  Crunchy and fresh, and perfect with a warm spicy dish, or it would be great with some grilled chicken for a summer dinner.  I did add fresh grated citrus zest on top and that made it.  We couldn't find the Thai chiles and substituted all jalapeno. Also, don't skimp on the black pepper!  This is SPICY - not for the tame palate.

Healthy  beautiful salad! I didn't have thai chiles I'm sure they're a great addition. I added one grated carrot,  some orange juice and extra lemon juice to the "dressing.  Great as a side dish or for snacking! Thanks for sharing your recipe! :)

This recipes makes enough for an army--I used half a large jicama and adjusted the other ingredients to try to cut it in half. But it still made an enormous bowlful. Also, I used just one Thai chile and half a jalapeno and--wow!--it had quite a kick. But still I love the contrasting textures and flavors in this salad and highly recommend it as a perfect summer side dish. Great with grilled food. We had it with the season's first Copper River salmon. Refrigerate the leftovers and happily serve the next day.

I did not use the bell r sweet peppers as I had a dinner guest who does not like them. I added a couple of avocados instead. It was delicious with the avocados, so i am sure it would be fantastic with the peppers.

I served this with Mexican Baked Fish and some  grilled zucchini. It was a wonderful combination! I will definitely make it again!

I made this exactly as written...with one jalapeno, 2 Thai chilies, and a little less than 1/2 bunch of cilantro, (because we don't love cilantro).  I was being cautious with the chilies because several reviewers said it was too hot, but it wasn't too hot for us.  It was very colorful and refreshing, served with barbecued pork country ribs.  It does take an extraordinary amount of time to prep, and next time I might try dressing it with lime juice instead of lemon because I typically serve jicama with a squeeze of lime and a sprinkle ofTajin Seasoning.  I might also add some black beans.

I didn’t use radish, but used everything else. Refreshing, healthy, and a little spicy. Loved it!

Looking for something light and appealing to the eye to pair with bbq.  This is very  wonderful and light.  as another reviewer had, I did add a little oj and a couple splashes of red wine vinegar to bring out every fantastic flavor of this festive salad.  Dont scrimp if you can help it on the fresh orange.  Im dyin to try this alongside some blackened red snapper...

This is very much a favorite in my house. My daughter has difficulty with citric acid so I substituted mango for the orange. I also subbed avocado for the cucumber due to allergies. To make it easier, I just used the bag of sweet peppers and cut them to bite size instead of all the different kinds. I couldn't find the right Chile pepper so I used what I could find. I also used more cilantro than required because we love it. It was gobbled up.

This made a huge quantity. The lemon juice called For didn’t really dress the salad. It has potential though. I ended up chopping up the leftovers and liked it better.

This was delicious and very pretty, but needed more zing. I will make it again but add some jalepenos next time. The crunch and variety of ingredients was very nice.

Definitely a do again dish for us. I love the texture the Jicama provides and the heat makes it a fantastic side.

Pretty to look at, but I found it too bland.  Won't be making again.

Could only find dried Thai chilies.  Made for a group so only used one of the dried chilies.  LOTS of chopping.  Peeling the jicama was quite difficult; veg peeler did not work; had to use paring knife.  Very tasty but will probably not make again.  Worth the one-time try.

I used canned mandarin oranges and only 1 bell pepper. The other peppers seemed excessive. Very refreshing and an excellent healthy side!

I don't do super spicy so I took out Thai Chilies and substituted Pablano peppers . Had fresh oranges I took off my California aunt's tree so it turned out really well.  There was lots of good crunch and lots of flavor!

Pretty good, but kind of dry.  Maybe more oranges or some kind of dressing would help.
