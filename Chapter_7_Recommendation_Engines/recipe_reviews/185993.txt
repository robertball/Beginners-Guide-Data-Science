This was as good as any restaurant bisque I have had in the past.  I had nice blue lump crab meat, so I added it in the last 15 minutes.  Also, I know that it has enough fat content already, but when making something for the fam for the first time, I go for all out taste - added a cup of shredded colby/jack cheese at end, and 1/2 can of rotel(suggestion from sis) (Tomatoes and green chile)... thanks! My shrimp and crab were glad they were not wasted!

This soup was REALLY good!  My husband said it was the best thing I've ever made (and we've been together for 10 years).  I didn't change anything about the recipe other than I didn't get the veggies very tender when saut√©ing them and we really liked the crunchiness that added later.  I didn't have creole seasoning but had Penzey's Cajun seasoning and I used a teaspoon and a half of that.  This is definitely a keeper and next time we'll add a can of crab meat to liven things up.  Great recipe!!

I made this for our "SOUPER" Bowl party -- it was a big hit!  I got find the liquid crab and shrimp boil, so I used a mixture of the Old Bay Seasoning and a little water, but I am sure that the real thing would have been super!  Thank you

Outrageously Good!  I am no cook, though I try really hard!  I found this easy to make and absolutely delicious.  My family, who is a hard audience to please, loved it!  It is also such a pretty medley of colors when done.  Very pleasing to the eye as well as palate.  A+

I threw in some serrano peppers and hot sauce for an extra kick. I used skim milk instead of cream and it worked fine.

I didn't have any shrimp & crab boil so I just used extra Creole seasoning but otherwise followed the recipe as is and it was delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe!

A creamy and yummy seafood soup. We made several changes: reduced butter to 1/4 cup, subbed golden mushroom soup for cream of mushroom, subbed seafood stock for water, 24 ounces of evaporated milk for half-and-half, and used Old Bay seasoning in lieu of liquid shrimp and crab boil seasoning. We will make this again.

I used this for my cooking business. I didn't put in the liquid shrimp and my client liked it without that, he did say that it wasn't as cajun as he thought it would be though, so I would add some more spice to give it a kick.

Delicious!  Will make again for sure! A great addition would be orien cut potatoes or black beans.  My fam declares this a new FAV!  I did add more of the Creole seasoning than called for because my fam likes it spicy, but not too hot.  Keeper Recipe!

OMG!!  This was soooo good.  I am not much of a seafood fan, so I mixed things up and used roasted chicken.  It was excellent.

The soup was delicious.  I added another tablespoon of shrimp and crab boil.  The soup was a lot thinner than Ia  wanted it so I made a slurry with water and cornstarch to try and thicken the soup...it worked.

My entire family loved this soup. My husband who is quite the critic is bragging about the delicious soup his wife made. Since we have a large family, I doubled the recipe, I made it with milk I already had, 3lbs of shrimp and 1lbs of crab meat. I also added 1 extra tsp of the crab and shrimp boil. It was amazing! My kids were asking for this the next day. I made this twice, the first time, I could not find the liquid shrimp and crab boil and it turned out ok but a little too spicy since I tried to compensate with the creole seasoning. Then I found the shrimp and crab boil at Walmart and decided to give it another try...SOOOO glad I did!

Awesome soup! I used 1 extra large vidalia onion, 2 green bell peppers, 2 cans of Rotel Tomatoes. I seasoned to taste with Tony's! I omitted the celery and the crab boil. It was GREAT!!! Loved it and will definitely make again.
