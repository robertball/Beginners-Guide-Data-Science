We are having a snowy day and since I had frozen shredded potatoes in the freezer this seemed like a good thing to try.  I let the frozen potatoes thaw although they were still cold and I added a diced onion that I carmelized before adding.  I must say that like waffles, my first one did not come out.  My mistake was not spreading out the potatoes but piling it up in the center just like waffle batter.  That didn't work and it was a mushy pile after 20 minutes.  Once I spread it out thin, they cooked crispy and delicious.  I believe I would add more than one onion next time (this one was rather small) and a little more garlic salt.  Overall this was a good experience and we will do it again.  Thanks!

After reading the reviews, I followed the other reviewers’ suggestions of adding onions, thinly spreading the potatoes onto the waffle griddle,  and cooking smaller waffles for five minutes.  If you are making smaller waffles as I did, I recommend preheating your oven for 200° to keep them warm while the others are cooking because it does take some time to cook them all.

I actually used some thawed tater tots to speed things up! Added real bacon bits and some sharp cheese also....It was excellent! Make sure you oil or spray the waffle iron liberally when adding cheese. Do not open for about 8 minutes...came out crispy and delicious!

Fun, simple and delicious! I used a bag of refrigerated shredded hash browns, so I omitted step 2. I also added in some onion powder, but would like to try adding fresh onion next time. I could see adding a lot of different spices. I made mine smaller and got 6 out of the recipe. I cooked them about 5 mins. or so. I was worried about them sticking, but they didn't. Very cool and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Creative!  I liked the addition of smoked paprika and garlic for some extra flavor.  This makes for a great breakfast sandwich also.  Just use in place of toast.

Wow, this worked great! I had a hard time getting them out of my waffle iron so I basically picked it up and dumped them, lol! I used my own seasoning with store bought refrigerator hash browns. I also used less oil but I made sure the iron had Pam on it. These were great and really fast.

I like the convenience of this, don't have to keep watching the potatoes cook.  Like other reviewers I added onion to this as I always put onion in my hash browns and put cheese on top to finish it. I did not like the egg in this, I felt it detracted from the taste and made too bland.

This was a success...I was looking to make a fun breakfast on a snow day, so I made a half recipe using defrosted and drained frozen hash browns. I am sure you could season according to your preference very easily - My waffle iron makes three small round waffles, about the size of an English muffin half, so I made some poached eggs and used the hash brown waffles as the base - so we had gluten-free Eggs benedict!

Hi, thank you all for the nice reviews, I'm glad you've enjoyed my recipe. After making these for a few years, I have some more tips for getting them to turn out best.

The waffle iron needs to get hot.  If it doesn't cook a regular waffle in less than 3 minutes, It probably won't get hot enough to make a crispy outside on these waffles. If your iron doesn't get very hot, you can still make the waffles and then broil them until crispy. Preheat the iron a long time. If a water droplet doesn't sizzle on contact it's not hot enough. Adding the potatoes while it's too cold increases the chances it will stick to the iron.

Use yellow or russet potatoes. Red or white potatoes have too much water and not enough starch for this recipe and will make soggy hashbrowns. Pre-shredded potatoes are almost always russets because they fry up the best. Spread the potatoes around on the iron, they won't flow like regular waffle batter.

Don't add the egg or salt too early. The osmotic pressure will draw water out of the potato shreds (especially fresh ones) and make a watery mess. My new favorite way to dry shredded potatoes is to spin them in the salad spinner as fast as they will go.

If you're shredding fresh potatoes, don't do it the night before to save time.  They will turn black and no one will want to eat your waffles. Commercial pre-shredded potatoes are treated with acid to keep them from turning black.

That's all I've got, thanks again!

Janel

I really like these. I did use hash-browns that you add hot water to re-hydrate. I put hot water in the carton, re-hydrate them, drain out any excess water, and follow the rest of the recipe. I had to cook a little longer in my waffle iron to get them crispy but so easy! I have made them adding chopped ham and grated cheddar cheese, and also with chopped cooked bacon.. I serve with sour cream. This is now a staple breakfast item.

I read some of the reviews before making so I chose to add onion to my first batch. I also threw in some shredded zucchini. The first one was a little mushy because I had the waffle iron on too low. Once I cranked up the heat the "waffles" turned out great. I served them with a fried or poached egg on top and a little siracha for some heat. They were delicious!

Save yourself and do not use whole potatoes that you shred yourself! I could not get the potatoes to stick together! I see many people used frozen hash browns and maybe those would work, but I tried three different ways to cook fresh shredded potatoes and it just made a big mess. I could eat the cooked potatoes but it was definitely a difficult and messy way to cook shredded potatoes. I first followed the recipe exactly, soaking the potatoes and wringing them out (still very drippy!), and they didn't stick together. Then I thought it was too drippy and maybe it needed the starch that is removed during soaking to help it stick together, so I tried it again without soaking the potatoes in water. Still made a big mess. I have a non-stick waffle iron so I did not use cooking spray the second time, but the third time I tried cooking spray. The shredded potatoes still stuck to the waffle iron and not each other. I have successfully made tater tot waffles so I think I'll stick with the tots!

Will certainly have to try cooking hash browns in waffle iron, just after frying my bacon in it too! Fry bacon half way, then pouring waffle mix, cooking the bacon the rest of the way inside the waffle. Sounds like a hardy breakfast coming up!

I will not make this again. I mean, it was OK, but was slightly less satisfying than just whomping up a batch of hash browns. This didn’t taste that much differently than a batch of hash browns. As a matter of fact, a batch of hash browns tastes better and is more gratifying. This is some work for something less satisfying than regular hash browns. No thanks.

Would use onions and no eggs. It was mushy more than crisp. Longer time in waffle iron needed.

These didn't really work at all, although I'm guessing it was something I did wrong and not the recipe. The idea is really good, mine just came out really stuck and not in one piece...basically just like they would have been if I made them on a griddle.

I made this for lunch, the flavor is great just the way it is.  But next time I will spread them out thinner so they cook crispier, also will increase the temperature of my waffle iron.  I think this recipe will make 3 or 4 of them perfectly crispy out side and tender inside.

This sounded like a simple way to enjoy one of our family favorites - Potato Latkes - without all of the mess.  I followed the directions as written, substituting a spice blend we love for the paprika.
We were disappointed only in that they never crisped up.  I ended up popping them in the oven under the broiler briefly, which gave us that texture we were looking for.

Thought this would be a time saver, but evidently our waffle iron doesn't get hot enough.  I made a whole pile in the frying pan while waiting for the waffle iron to finish one.

I will never go back to making latkes by frying potatoes in oil.  This is the BEST!  No greasy splatter or messy oil clean up.  I added lots of fresh minced onions, used garlic pwd. instead of fresh and left out the paprika. We made these with my toddler preschool class and they really liked them, so did my co-workers.  Thanks for the idea.

This is a great idea!  I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved these crispy potato waffles!!  I put a  cookie cooling rank over my jelly roll pan and kept the waffles warm in the oven until I was finished making them.  I'm thinking of trying these on my panini maker.  I also will try adding onon, etc. as suggested by other  reviewers.  Thanks for a great idea!  Yum!!!

I went by the recipe but could have used at least 1/4 cup more potatoes, make with Faberware rotating waffle maker that performed perfectly.

Great recipe.  Fixed without the eggs and made patties cooked on a griddle.  Best I've ever done.  Thanks

I made it exactly as the recipe states other than I only had white potatoes but they worked fine. They were a bit eggy for my taste but other than that they were great!

This is a good recipe that I have made several times. You need to wring the water out of the potatoes really well. The first time I made these, my potatoes were too moist. For me, I add more eggs because it helps form the hash browns.

This is quite good, but not best-ever or anything. I like how easy it is. The flavor could be a bit more potent though.

I used a carton of dehydrated hashbrowns for this recipe and it came out perfectly! I didnt realize the carton came presalted so something to keep in mind if you go that route, I wouldnt add salt next time! Otherwise a perfect recipe :) Love this breakfast hack!

I used to make my hashbrowns this way in a skillet. Getting up to make this right now. Will be adding onion and green pepper finely minced to it.  Will be topping them with sour cream when done.

These were super easy to make. They weren't as crispy as I had hoped, but I think it's my waffle iron. I'll definitely be making these again!

Soooo Good! Read the other reviews and meant to add onions but forgot. Then I couldn't find my paprika so used 1 tsp of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning - covered a lot of the other ingredients (salt, pepper, paprika, garlic). These turned out amazing. Will definitely make again.

Interesting enough to consider again. Nice savory nature w/ smoked paprika which is important to the flavor as the recipe is written.

This is the easiest way to make hash brown's!  Also what my fiance asks for when I cook breakfast. I love it because I mix everything,  put them in iron and can deal with other things and don't have to worry about flipping them. I have also bought some hash brown's that were seasoned already and just added the egg and oil and cooked the same way for a day I was feeling a little lazy.  Crispy all around and soft in middle awesome for taste and cooking ease!

I really like that this recipe does not require flour as it makes it a perfect gluten-free "toast" replacement. I will definitely make it again.

I purchased my first waffle iron last week for our new home and decided I would try this out. There were 4 of us so I doubled the recipe. Delicious and amazing don't do this justice! I've always struggled with the right amount of oil and heat for hash browns on the stovetop. No problem with that here!! I will be making this time and time again.

This recipe is great!!  I planned to make it to go with dinner, but I wanted to give it a test run beforehand.  I made 1/2 a batch and my daughter and I ate it fast.  We both loved it.  We considered making another 1/2 batch, but then figured we'd wait for dinner.  I like lots of spice in mine.

Excellent!  Shredded the yellow potatos skins and all.  Soaked then spun in a salad spinner to dry.  Used an electric pizelle iron which worked fine.

Wow! I will never make hashed browns in a frying pan again!  Did not care for the addition of smoked paprika, but these worked perfectly using dehydrated hash browns that were then re-hydrated. Agree completely that these would make a great "bread" for breakfast sandwiches.

This recipe made four smaller waffles, which was perfect for our family. I used white potatoes and did not ice them. Also, we topped the waffles with shredded cheddar before serving.
