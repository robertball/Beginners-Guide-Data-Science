I tried this recipe after being disappointed with most Irish Soda Bread Recipes and was pleasantly surprised! The recipe was extremely easy! The bread is slightly dense but has an amazing flavor, especially buttered with real butter! I followed the recipes exactly; did not soak the raisins first, and it came out perfect - not dry at all. I did brush a little milk on the top before baking and butter after baking to create a softer, golden crust.

I used my Kitchenaide to mix the batter quickly without over mixing. Baking time was approximately 50 minutes. I am impressed and will definitely use this recipe instead of the dry traditional recipes!

This was good!  I made it to compare it to my M-I-L's recipe she calls Scon (rhymes with Ron, she's from County Caven).  I have yet to find any similar recipe to hers or anything called Scon.  The closest one likely originated in Scotland according to history.  Anyways, her recipe is:  3 c white flour, 1 c white table sugar, 3 tsp baking powder, 1 c raisins (tip: for those that don't want to buy a big box of raisins it's 4-6 of the 1 oz snack size boxes), 1 egg, 1  1/2 to 1  3/4 c whole milk.  Preheat oven to 350.   Mix by whisk the egg and milk together in a large bowl.  Mix the dry ingredients together, by whisk, in another large bowl.  Add the dry ingredients slowly to the wet ingredients while mixing by whisk or hand mixer (I use a whisk and then at the end I use a hand mixer to get any lumps out).  Stir in the raisins.  Pour into a lightly coated glass loaf pan.  It will be full, but it does make just 1 loaf.  Bake for 1 hour.  If a knife inserted in the middle doesn't come out clean after 1 hour, cover the edges with foil and bake longer (20- 40 min).  I measure and rip off 2 pieces of foil, lay it on the stove top crossing each other to place the loaf pan in the center and fold up the sides to wrap the pan easily rather than trying to cover the edges of a hot pan with strips of foil.  Try it, once cooled a slice is great with a spread of real butter and a cup of tea :)

Turned out awesome! I actually made a few changes that turn out pretty well. I added about a quarter cup of brown sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon, and it really adds to the flavour. I also baked it in a bread pan, as I didn't have a cast iron skillet - still turned out great, Just had a bit of a thicker crust. Loved it, thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious and very easy to make. I used half the amount of sugar called for in the recipe and it still has a nice sweetness and very good texture. It browned quickly so I tented it with foil about half way through the baking time. I'll definitely make this one again. Thank you, Joshua, for sharing your family recipe!

Very good. Sweeter than I expected. Will try it again with less sugar. I did use 2 cups of whole wheat flour to add some grains and it turned out really well.

The recipe is very well written and has good flavor, I haven't ever had this type of bread to have anything to compare it to. It was very easy to make. I think mine came out over baked as the edges were very crusted and tough, I think next time I will cut the baking time down. I did use a 12" cast iron skillet, it came out of the pan very nicely when I turned it over on a cutting board and used a butter knife around the edges. Only change I would make is cut baking time back.

This is an amazing recipe! It most definitely is not "soda bread," as it's made with baking powder (not soda), and it is sweeter than I expected. That notwithstanding, it is delicious. The only problem I had is that the largest cast iron skillet I had is 10", not 12". As a result, the bread rose pretty high and I had to cook it for 1 hour, 25 minutes before it was done in the middle...which resulted in the bottom of the bread being too done. I'm sure a 12" skillet would have solved that problem. The recipe itself is simple, basic, easy to follow, easy to make. I'll be baking this again!

I cut this recipe in half using a smaller cast iron skillet. I had a bag of dried raisins, cranberries and cherries so I used this mix. Very pretty when I cut the bread. Very good and I will definitely make again. This would be a great breakfast bread with coffee or tea. Enjoy!!!
