Delicious dish. I used buckwheat insead of bulgur and tofu instead of tempeh, since I had that on hand. Instead of dirtying another dish to saute the tempeh, I threw it on an empty spot on the baking tray and baked it. The key to roasting vegetables is to spread them out rather than piling them up, which will steam instead of roast. I used two baking trays since I had doubled a few ingredients and swapped out the veges that were done, as necessary.

Awesome! Roasted sweet potato just makes everyone happy. I used buckwheat instead of bulgar to keep it gluten free. I admit I didn’t watch the times while roasting the veggies. I did add them separately and kept them separate. I just kept my eye on them and added them in the order written when it just seemed the right time. I typically go to great lengths to avoid cooked fennel, but this was really tasty. The dressing is scrumptious. I used Raghavan’s Curry Blend, which is pretty spicy. What a great recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.
