tasty. I subbed evaporated skim milk for the cream and went a tad lighter on the cheese. It worked great. Fresh cracked rainbow peppercorns and pink sea salt perked this right up

My 2 year old ate this up. I thought it was ok. I used rotini pasta since it's easier for him to eat. I think the recipe is not that healthy though considering the fat and calorie content. I would try using whole milk maybe next time.

My family loved this mac and cheese! I made the recipe as written except I used gluten free macaroni  and it turned out perfect. There was a hint of carrots but my family had no clue.

I made this for a two year old and 8 year old for lunch and both of them ate it up. The only change I made was to use Barilla veggie pasta - the elbows made with carrots & butternut squash. Helped me sneak even more veggie-ness in there. Personally, I could taste the pure√©d carrots, but it wasn't off-putting at all, and the kids didn't mention it. I will make this again for sure.

This was very simple to make, and yes the recipe is high in fat and calories but in case you missed the title of the recipe it has cheese in it which will contribute to the higher fat and calorie content.

Healthy? Hardly! But healthier. I love the idea of sneaking in carrots into this comfort dish. Heavy cream makes for a great dish but 1% does fine too.

I often add cooked veggies. Steamed broccoli is my favorite but for folks whose kids don't "do" veggies it is a good idea.

I just made this and it was so good. I didn't use the carrot puree or whole grain pasta but everything else was pretty much the same.

Made this to the recipe and it was very good! We loved that the Barilla Whole Grain Elbows had more texture and firmness than regular pasta. The 6g of fiber was an added bonus! It also has enough cheesiness with the carrot in it to still be a great mac n cheese. Will make again, thinking of adding ham, peas, and carrots for a nice casserole!

Pretty good. Definitely not the healthiest, but I subbed evaporated skim milk for the cream. Good flavor - the asiago gave it a unique strong cheese taste. I used shells instead of elbows and will make again. Oh, and instead of cooking fresh carrots, I used a jar of my homecanned carrots and then just smashed them. Worked just fine.

Since I'm not a fan of elbows, I used rotini---the gluten free one (not my favorite choice, but what I have to deal with for my tasters).  I have to tell you that my granddaughter loved this!  I thought it was really missing flavor---more salt and (cayenne) pepper?  Tajin?  Sriracha? I followed the recipe exactly otherwise and thought I'd make it again for the little ones.  I do really like the Barilla pasta---my favorite choice always!
