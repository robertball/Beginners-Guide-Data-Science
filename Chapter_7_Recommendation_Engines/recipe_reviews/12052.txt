We used only 6 oz. of rotini (could have probably used 8 oz.), can of Hunt's diced tomatoes seasoned for tacos, can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, can of black beans (rinsed), and some diced onion along with the rest of the ingredients but no parmesan, fresh tomatoes or spices.  We cooked the meat and warmed all the canned goods and mixed it with the hot pasta and just tossed it in the oven for 15 minutes to melt the cheese. 

I definitely appreciate the recipe idea, don't think I would have made this without some inspiration.  My boyfriend and I really liked it and will definitely make our modified version in the future.

We enoyed this meal, it was a change of pace from the usual pasta fare.  I used elbows and made a goulash, then layered cheese throughout and on top and baked it at 325 degrees for about fifteen minutes.  Serve with a salad and some bread and you've got yourself a meal!

I made quite a few changes, but it ended up very good.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used one can of diced tomatoes, drained and 1 can of tomatoes with green chilies and some onion.  I also used elbow macaroni and baked in the oven with 1 1/4 c cheese.  Next time I think I'll add some corn, but it was very good as made.

Noone accept me seemed to like this.  I ended up throwing it out.  I think you could cut down a lot on the amount of pasta. It was a bit dry as well.

I made the original recipe the first time and it was ok. The second time I replaced the cheddar with smoked gouda cheese and added two teaspoons of cayenne pepper.. Also instead ofbthe fresh tomatoes I used canned organic diced tomatoes and it was divine!

I made a slight change by using pepper jack cheese instead of the Parmesan. After all it's cheese for cheese so no star deduction. This is a keeper folks and easily adaptable to your tastes.

Quick and tasty meal.  Alternative to typical spaghetti dinner.  To create a more richer sauce base , one change I made was using chunky garden salsa instead of the tomatoes. It added flavor and had tomatoes and onions in it.

I really liked this, with a few changes: 2 cloves garlic, add a few serving spoons of refried beans, and some fresh like juice. Lovely!

I used regular spaghetti instead of the fettuccine. I will use the fettuccine noodles next time to see which version I like.

Great recipe! I love spaghetti and my husband loves Mexican food, so this was a win for us. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, so I used two cans of drained Rotel. Delicious!

It was very tasty.  Layers of flavor & easy to put together.  Also, enjoyed a leftover.... also.  I didn't change a thing.... this time.  But, I may put a dollup or two on the side & scallions.  Maybe, crumble some Tostitos chips on top.... when serving.

I added a chopped onion, a couple minced garlic gloves (omitted garlic power), and some water to the beef (when I added the seasoning). I think it would be delicious with a little sour cream or chopped avocado on top.  I wouldnâ€™t recommend additional salt since taco seasoning is already quite salty.  Easy and delicious!

I used Linguine instead of Fettuccine, added more cheese than what is called for in the recipe, and before serving I put a large spoonful of green salsa, and a dollop of sour cream on top.

This was delicious. I ate more than one helping and had leftovers the next day. BTW, the leftovers were delicious as well.

Can't wait to make this again.

Mixed review; my husband thought it was great and I thought it was okay. I used a cooked chicken breast that I diced up in place of the hamburger. I used some of the pasta water to mix up the taco seasoning and I threw in a can of beans.  As other reviewers did, I used a can of diced tomatoes as I did not have fresh. I'll make it again and use rotel or something similar, maybe even salsa, if I have it on hand. Thanks for submitting, I think it's a creative use for leftovers and with a few tweaks for our taste buds, it will be excellent.

This was a win with the family, but we did make changes like other reviewers said. We used about 12 oz of elbow macaroni and 1 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomatoes. We cooked the ground beef, drained the grease, then added the spices and tomatoes and heated them together. Then we added them to a baking dish on top of the cooked pasta, adding the black olives and cheeses on top and baked in the oven for about 15 minutes, until the cheeses were all melted.

Delicious! Since Iâ€™m vegetarian and had no ground beef, i mixed the taco seasoning with buttered fettuccine noodles. Also added some leftover salsa on top for even more flavor

I used this recipe as a base then customized it quite a bit. I used the fettuccine but substituted ground turkey for ground beef. I added a small can of corn, a can of rotel with grilled peppers for some spice, I accidentally picked up minced black olives which worked out well because Iâ€™m not a huge fan of the texture of black olives  so I got the flavor of the black olives and not the texture. I also added salsa as well as Mexican cheese blend. I cooked the pasta then cooked the remaining ingredients, after simmering a bit added the pasta and put the mixture into a casserole dish and put the remaining cheese on top, baked it at 350 until it was bubbly. Canâ€™t really rate  the actual recipe but with the customization it was delicious.
