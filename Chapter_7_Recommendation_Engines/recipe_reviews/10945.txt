This is a great recipe. However, after mixing and baking, and finally trying one, I realized something was missing. Salt. It may not seem like such a big deal to omit the salt, but it makes a big difference in the flavor. It will enhance it, and cut some of the sweetness out, so you can enjoy the other flavors. I would probably put about half a teaspoon in it. It will make a great difference in the cookie, I promise.

Wow!!! . . . These are the best p.b. cookies I have ever made.  I'm not a fan of cripy cookies and these turned out amazingly chewy and moist.  I did add a couple extra things - 1/2 c. extra p.b., 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. vanilla - otherwise I followed the recipe (which was wonderfully simple) to a T.  Will definately be making these again =)

I am always trying new peanut butter cookies, because I always seem to lose the ones I like. I made these, generous on the peanut butter (i usually add 1/4-1/3 c extra), and brought them to a teacher meeting. I expected to come home with some, but they were all gone by the end! I even got compliments on them at the next meeting! 
If you like them chewy, make sure to take them out of the oven once they are solidified but not brown yet.

Very easy and very tasty!  If you substitute butter for the shortening and leave out the eggs, they taste like peanut butter shortbread.  Very versatile recipe for all your peanut butter moods!

This is one of the best peanut butter cookies recipes out there.  I added a little more peanut butter and the cookies came out perfect.

The cookies will not appear done so be careful not to overcook.

I used maragrine instead of shortening because I was out of shortening.  Big mistake!  I think this is the reason why my cookies turned out all thin and flat.  Oops!  They sure did taste good though!

My family loved these cookies - I made a couple of changes (first by accident, and then because we like the cookies better this way), I added an extra egg, crunchy peanut butter, and additional flour.  I live in Colorado so the flour could also be a high altitude adjustment.  Either way -we love these cookies!

These cookies were delicious, but if you bake them a minute too long (or don't get the timer immediately), they get too crisp.  Take the too crisp cookies and crush them up for a great pie crust.

Very easy recipe and straight forward.  I don't think it could be any simpler than this.  Everyone loved the cookies, however, they were a little crispier than I would like.  I would have preferred a chewier cookie.   Any ideas on how to get these cookies chewier using this recipe?

Very good & chewy.  I found it easier to remove the cookies from the baking sheet if I let them cool for a few minutes first.  Also, I was able to get around 4 dozen good size cookies from this recipe.

As recommended by the other reviews, I added an additional 1/2 c of peanut butter, 1/2 t. salt and 1 t. vanilla.  I beat the entire recipe in my stand mixer so the dough was sticky but fluffy.  I couldn't make balls with the dough so I just drop spoonfuls on the pan and didn't flatten them.  I baked the cookies at 350 degrees for 8 1/2 minutes and let the cookies cool on the pan for at least 5 minutes before removing them.  They are delicious.  I also used chunky peanut butter.  I like texture in my cookies! *** Okay, I just had to add, I've just made these for the second time and they are AWESOME!  Make the changes listed above and you won't make any other cookies.  YUM!

They must be good because my picky husband loved them. I don't eat peanut butter cookies, but I trust his picky judgement on these. They are a keeper for us. I followed the recipe exactly.

loved this recipe! i followed some other reviews and added vanilla and a pinch of salt, and used a heavy hand with the peanut butter. i didn't have any eggs so i substituted ground flax with water (1Tbs flax +3Tbs water=1 egg). i also made a couple of "classic" modifications: topped with sugar and "x-ed" with fork marks before baking, or baked without sugar and topped with a hershey kiss upon removal from the oven. both were a hit with my fellow football fans!

This recipe was a good starting point. I, like many others, took several suggestions from these comments and from there tweaked it a bit more myself. With my changes, these are by far the best peanut butter cookies I've ever eaten. Perfect little crunch around the edges, but the rest of the cookie stays super chewy.

I did as some other reviewers suggested and added a (heaping) half tsp of salt, 1 tsp of vanilla, a little extra pb, and I replaced the white sugar with raw unrefined sugar - I think it gives a better flavor. The salt definitely brings out that awesome salty/sweet combination. The kids devoured them and my husband kept sneaking them as quickly as I could get them out of the oven! :-) Definitely let them cool for a few minutes before you remove them from your cookie sheet ( or baking stone - I use mine for everything...and cookies always turn out phenomenal! ) or they will fall apart. This recipe is a keeper - I will be making these cookies again and again!

Wonderful flavor, great great great. I added a little salt and vanilla too, but otherwise left it alone. My first batch came out a little too soft, so I left the second batch in the full 10, and then a minute or two more until they were just darkening on top, the second batch was perfect! Baked them this morning, the fam has already devoured them all  :)

EXCELLENT!! I left out the water, used only 1c of the 1.25c flour called for, and added 1 tsp Vanilla to enhance the flavor. I made mini-cookies out of 1/2 inch balls and cooked them at 350 for 7 minutes. They don't spread out much so you can space them 1/2 inch apart. PERFECT!! They disappeared FAST!!

by far THE BEST peanut butter cookie i've ever had. I've tried so many recipies and this is the only one that gives me chewy gooey peanut butter cookies. PERFECT! I did use butter instead of shortening. I reccomend using crunchy peanutbutter for half the amount of peanutbutter it calls for. this gives it an extra little crunch without being any more peanutty.

These cookies turned out great as far as being moist and chewy. I added an extra 1/4 c. of peanut butter because the dough didn't seem peanut buttery enough for me. I think I could have added a bit more.

These cookies are amazing! I like to make large cookies, so I roll these into 3 inch balls and bake for 16 minutes...perfect and delicious! Chewy in the center with a light crisp around the edge.

These cookies are super easy and super delicious!

I didn't have brown sugar so I doubled the white sugar. I don't know if that's a "no-no", but I did it and they still turned out yumtastic!

These cookies are delicious! If you are looking for the perfect peanut butter cookie, these are them! Also, I am not a fan of vegetable oil so I used butter instead, which worked out great. I will be using this recipe for many, many years.

These were great cookies!! I followed some advice from the other reviews and added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp salt and about 1/4 more peanut butter. I baked them for 11 minutes on a stone at 350 and they turned out chewy and awesome!

While baking these cookies smelled awesome.  But, like many of the other reviews I have to say they were pretty bland and grainy.  I even used butter flavored shortening.  I will go with a different recipe next time.

I hate to give it a bad review, however they came out grainy! They fall apart easy. Not chewy, just grainy. I followed the recipie exacty so I'm not sure what went wrong. But I don't think I'll be useing this recipie again.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. Cookies came out bland and easily crumble. And it doesn't yield 18 cookies, I got 3 dozen!

These are some of the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had.  They turned out firm but very soft and delicious.  Like some other people, I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of salt.  I also used only about a 1/2 cup of margarine and 1/2 cup of apple sauce for the shortening.   I will definitely make these again.

Love these cookies!....not exactly chewy, more melt in your mouth but delicious none the less. Used butter instead of shorting, i am a firm believer that cookies with shorting are just not worth the effort.

I recommend following the recipe as written for your first time because there is nothing wrong with these cookies.  One of the easiest cookies to make, in my opinion.  Of course I will try other recipes but I now have one to come back to when all else fails.  Thanks for posting, you made our bellies smile.

I just finished making these for my family and although I added a 1/2 cup more flour, extra peanut butter and a little vanilla. They were easy to make but not very flavorful in my opinion.

this recipe had to be revised so much that I think it would be best just to find a whole different recipe to use.  Peanut butter cookies in general are very easy and delicious.  I didnt find these tasty or with all the fussing with the recipe to turn out right it wasnt easy either.  You cant put these in balls like usual cause its too runny of a batter.  have to add alot of extra flour, and extra pb just for flavor.  I will try different recipe not this one again.

I really like this cookie! I just made a batch, following the suggestion to add a 1/2 cup of flour, an extra egg and a teaspoon of vanila, and it great. Very firm on the outside, but soft and chewy on the inside. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough peanut butter(only had 1 cup), so it still tastes good,but not as peanutty as I normally like it.

 Still, great recipe and it's going in my file!

Ok so I didn't have any eggs on hand, and as other reviews I added more peanut butter 1/4c. Wow!!! I didn't realize but I was able to get 4 doz cookies out of this. I also spilt my dough into 4 bowls, 1) nothing added. 2) added a few Tbs of cocoa & a sprinkle of hot cocoa mix. 3) added chocolate chips. 4) added chocolate chips and chopped pecans. 
AWESOME!!! Hubby loved them all.

These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made or tasted the only change I made was I added 1/2 tsp of salt per other reviews I also did cooked for  only 8 minutes even though they didnt look done but I knew they would bake @ least 2 more minutes out of stove in the pan. These are a must try look no further  for peanut butter cookie recipes because "you got the right one baby un-huh"

I love a chewy cookie and this is it!  I added 1/2 tsp. of Salt and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  I don't like the way the shortening has a waxy feel to it, and would prefer butter, but wasn't sure if that would make them crunchy so I stuck with the shortening.

The best peanut butter cookies I have ever made.  Instead of using a cup of shortening, I used 3/4 cup and a stick of softened butter and rolled them in sugar before criss crossing them. They turned out perfectly and my family loved them.

Direct quote from my husband (who has pretty much eaten half the batch tonight): These are the best cookies I have ever eaten, ever, and I am not lying.  I have to agree - these are pretty much the perfect peanut butter cookie.  They have just the right amount of crunch when you first bite, but then they just melt in your mouth.  They are peanut buttery rich, but not heavy.  I finished most of them with the classic criss-cross and sugar, but added a few with a peanut M&M.  All of them are fantastic!

Sorry to say, but these cookies were not very good.  They were not chewy at all which would have been okay if they has some taste to them.  You couldn't taste the peanut butter at all, so they just had a VERY sweet taste to them....but besides that, not much other taste .

These cookies were AMAZING just as they were + 1/2 tsp of salt. I also added 1/4c. of crystallized ginger chopped up, with 1 tsp of pumpkin spice and they were awesome!

I love this recipe! I always use it as is and it turns out perfect. They always go fast so I make a double batch. They are soft and chewy and stay that way for weeks, so the name truly fits. The dough was dry one time because of the weather and I just added a little milk until it was the consistency I wanted. Best peanut butter cookie ever!

Pretty good recipe, but I found the cookies to come out a bit dry on the inside. However, I did end up with one good batch by accident... My 2 year old played with the oven temperature knob and cranked the heat to 500 without me noticing. They cooked that way for a few minutes (couldn't be more than 3 or 4) after having baked at 350 for maybe 4-5 minutes. I took them out of the oven as soon as I noticed the temperature. They were golden brown on the outside and somehow VERY moist in the inside... I will try to make them this way again, with a blast of high heat for a short amount of time. They were the best of the 3 batched I cooked that day!

I just made these cookies and they turned out awesome!  I added an extra half a cup of peanut butter simply because I like my cookies with a lot of peanut butter flavor.  Other than that, the recipe was spot on!  Kudos to you, Sandi, its marvelous.  I would suggest keeping a close eye on them so they don't burn, but other than that, perfect!

We baked these for Santa tonight.  They are very good.  My hubby is very picky about his peanut butter cookies & he gave these a passing grade.  I did add about 1 teaspoon of vanilla & another 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  They are light, soft & chewy.

I enjoyed the recipe, it was a hit with family and friends. I did make a couple of changes, I used butter crisco instead of regular and I added 1/2 t  of salt and 1 t of vanilla. I thought the salt and vanilla really brought out the peanut butter flavor. I have now made them three times and I'm sure to make them again!

After looking at suggestions from others, I added half a teaspoon of salt and a third cup extra of peanut butter, and the cookies were amazing! I am at high altitude and baked the cookies at 350 degrees for eight to nine minutes. Love this recipe!!

These were tasty, and I added a little crunch by using crunchy peanut butter. I had some issues with melted butter that caused my cookies to be flat as paper, though. I've since learned that dry cookie dough bakes puffy and wet cookie dough bakes flat - it all has to do with the moisture content from butter and eggs. I'll try this recipe again.

I used margarine instead of shortening, added an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter, and some crush wonderbars.  They turned out great crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside. My peanut Butter fiend loved them!  Definately a keeper!

Awesome! With the suggestions of salt, vanilla, and extra peanut butter, and taking them out of the oven right before 8mins. They came out great- moist and chewy! I actually feel like I can bake!

I loved these, but like others, I did need to add in salt and vanilla to bump up the flavor.  I added 1 tsp Salt, and 2 tsp Vanilla.  I double the recipe, and used my small ice cream scooper, then pressed each scoop with a fork.  It was way easier than hand-rolling and they still came out pretty.  I even did one batch without the fork marks and they were beautiful.  Super moist and flavorful.  I thought the amount of peanut butter was fine as called for.  I made 3 dozen for a potluck and they were gone in minutes.  I took another 2 dozen to my mother-in-law after she got out of the hospital and she gobbled them up.  My husband loved how they were soft and chewy even 2 days after baking.  Great recipe!

I doubled the recipe and added the 1.5 tsp vanilla as suggested and added 1 tsp of salt.  Peanut Butter cookies WERE my "Moby Dick" now, if I could learn Spanish. 


I highly recommend this recipe.

I just finished baking these cookies and they are absolutely delicious.  Chewy on the inside and crispy around the edges.  The only modification I made was using 1 1/2 cups of low sodium natural peanut butter, vs 1 cup of regular peanut butter.

Perfect moist cookie. I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp of almond extract, and 1/2 tsp of salt. The taste is so rich and creamy these will be the only peanut butter cookie I will bake.

I always wondered about the odd poor rating for a recipe that receives such high marks, and now I'm the one doing that. First off my cookies turned out looking nothing like the picture here. Followed the recipe using chunky peanut butter, maybe that was that the problem. At eight minutes they were cooked perfectly but the cookie that came out of the oven sort of puffed up then sank. Texture was almost meringue like, taste was only mildly peanut butter-y! Rolled some of the balls of dough in sugar before baking trying to add some flavor to the finished cookie. Did try to put a Hershey kiss into some and the cookies started to cave in, oh well. (I even used the addition of vanilla as many had previously suggested.)

Not chewy at all, not sweet enough, does not have much flavor - overall not very good.  I wouldn't make this recipe again.

I thought these cookies were great!  Super easy to make, wonderful color and my family loved them!  The only thing that I found slightly lacking was the peanut butter taste, I would have rated them 5 stars if they had a stronger peanut butter taste.  I think next time I make them I will either add more peanut butter or add some chopped nuts!

Not wanting to tell Mom that I lost her peanut butter cookie recipe again, I came to all recipes to look for one.  This is it! It is so simple and the end results, so good, that once you try it you'll never use another.  I didn't even use peanut butter, but almond butter and chopped almonds and the cookies turned out great! I did take the advice of another reviewer and added vanilla.  Thanks for a great recipe and for helping me not get killed by my mother, again.

I looked all over for a peanut butter cookie recipe that I liked, and I loved this one.  I did add an extra half cup of peanut butter and a bit of salt and vanilla extract like another reviewer had suggested.  I cooked them at 350 for 9 minutes and they turned out awesome, nice and chewy.

This recipe truly delivers. If cooked properly this recipe is very chewy.   i'm still trying to figure out how they got the cookies to get that shape in the display picture but other than that this was a very sure-shot recipe.  no additions or subtractions.

I loved this recipe. Made a couple of changes like 1/2 cup more peanut butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla and make sure and take them out at 8 minutes on the dot if you like your cookies soft and they will be perfect.

These cookies are nice and chewy and have a good texture, but could use more peanut butter flavor for my taste.  I added 1 1/2 cup peanut butter and they tasted better.

Great cookies and easy to make.  May family  loves them.  To the original recipe I added 1/2 cup more peanut butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. I also used dark brown sugar instead of light. It makes 5 dozen cookies. Using 2 baking sheets and 3 sheets of parchment paper, I was able to have 1 batch baking, 1 cooling on the couter and 1 ready to go into the oven.

Just one thing: Do not use Adams peanut butter! I thought I would use the rest of our adams pb and they turned out so blah. I'm sure with less healthy pb they would turn out better though.

They were good but not great. They came out flatter than I like and I'm not sure what I did wrong. The picture shows them thicker and I thought they would be. Otherwise, great recipe! I only baked half and have the other half rolled in the freezer for later. Thanks!

I used the eggs for a lovely cookie.  Mine baked up in a 350 oven for 9 minutes and came out soft, the way I like them.  I added 1/4 tsp salt after my first taste test. Watch your placement on the cookie sheet - in my case the dough balls seemed to double in width as they baked.  A great cookie.

These turned out very nice - definitely add  a little salt 1/2 tsp or so.  I used lower sodium and lower sugar PB, so the overall flavour was more subtle...next time I'll use regular PB, and I think it'll taste a lot more peanut butter like...mmm!

These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever baked! I have an intolerance to wheat and I substituted the flour, but they turned out perfect! Crisp around the edges, but soft and chewy in the middle. Fantastic.

My search for the perfect peanut butter cookie is over.  My husband said these were,  "to die for".  Chewy in the middle,  tender crisp on the edges.  I added 1/4 t. salt,  everything else just as is.  Great recipe!

I made this one last night and the only thing that I did different was that I used Splenda for baking and Splenda brown sugar instead, since I am diabetic and I don't use regular sugar.  They have a good taste but weren't chewy like I want it.  I baked them at 350 degrees for 8 minutes. Maybe next time I will leave them less in the oven to see if they get chewy, BTW they were soft.

Okay, so the serving size says 18.  18 what?  18 small villages???  Anyway, so we got about 50 (and some were pretty big) cookies out of the recipe.  Also we had to add about a half cup of flour to make it not so runny.  Even then, there was no way we were going to be able to roll it into balls.  We dropped teaspoons instead.  Also we added mini Reeses cups.  The chocolate really helped with the flavor.

Very nice cookie recipe. I included the eggs. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and the remaining 1 1/2 cups white. I think this gives the cookies a really nice texture. :)

I honestly did not like this recipe at all. It was an easy recipe to follow, but the outcome was not what I expected. The cookies were not very flavorful and quickly turned hard. My children would not eat them. I wasted time and money on these.

EXCELLENT! Thanks Sandi - these are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had.  The only changes I made were that I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and 1 cup of plan M&Ms.  I also dipped the fork in sugar instead of water. My kids and their friends loved them!

WOW! What a hit, best ever PB cookie.  I followed suggestions of others added xtra egg, 1/2c flour, but also did more...vanilla,chopped pecans,& giant chips.  After I rolled into ball, dipped top in wht choc powder (processor), then did my criss cross fork,& baked for only 7-8 mins,MOIST, CHEWY, & far from too peanut buttery.

Very yummy, but mine came out soft and chewy, yet very crumbly. Maybe because I didn’t have shortening, and substituted coconut oil?  I also added a little splash of vanilla and a pinch of sea salt.

I made these for the first time and they turned out fantastic! I wouldn't say they were chewy, but they did turn out soft and delicious. I altered the recipe slightly as some other members suggested, I added a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of vanilla and extra peanut butter. I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes. This will definitely be my go to recipe for peanut butter cookies!

The cookies were good, but not great.  I could really taste the shortning.  I think the substitution of lard or butter for the shortning would make the recipe much tastier.  Maybe next time.

I tried this recipe at 4am on 08/24. I wanted to add some cookies to my list of sweets I've already prepared. Looked for peanut butter cookies and the ingredients seemed easy enough. I did add more peanut butter but you have to watch them, that is the key to them being soft. These cookies were so easy and taste oh so good. This is a keeper peanut butter cookie recipe.

I made these cookies for some friends and when I realised that they were too many I left some at home. Everyone loved them! They have the perfect texture, chewy and crispy at the same time! These cookies are just perfect. I couldn't get the shortening so I replaced it for butter, they turned out great anyway. They are even better If you pour them into a glass of fresh milk ;)

I made all the recommended changes (1/2 c more pb, 1/2 c more flour) and made peanut butter delight cookies (the ones with the kiss in the middle).  I forgot to add the vanilla so I added that after the first batch, I think I prefer them without but both are delicious.  I baked at 350 for 14 minutes for the balls. They were chewy and wonderful!

These are very soft and chewy, but I did hope for more of a peanut butter flavor.

It was perhaps the brand of shortening I used, but the shortening made them taste like plastic, and it was disgusting.  I'm definitely using butter if I ever make this again.

Very good cookies.  I didn't have shortening so added 1 cup melted butter instead. I also used 1 tsp. vanilla & 1/2 t. salt; and only used 1 egg.

These were seriously fantastic! i used ungranulated raw sugar instead of brown sugar and added 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla to it. I'm very picky about peanut butter cookies and i thought they were wonderful! I would recomend this recipe to everyone and it would be great to make with a group of kids. the only problem i had was that it was hard to stir but its well worth it! ^.^

I made these the other night, and chewy isn't the adjective I'd use. My family and I thought they tasted like crisco cookies. Still looking for the perfect peanut butter cookie recipe.

This is great!  I made them chewy.  I just used butter instead of shortening and a tad more peanut butter.  They looked and tasted lovely.

These were delicious, though they were crispy, not chewy.  The only change I made was to add a 1/2 t salt.  My next batch, I will try cooking less time in the oven.

The absolute best peanut butter cookies I hace every made. A little note to the readers. Add a bag of milk chocolate or peanut butter chips to the recipe for even more yum.  Thank You for this most delightful recipe.

These cookies weren't horrible, but they don't have that chewy peanut buttery flavor, are kind of grainy in texture, and basically just tasted really institutional to me. I actually think there is too much sugar in this recipe.

Good cookie. I changed a few things. I used half white and half whole wheat flour. For the shortening I used a combo of butter, oil(1/2), apple sauce and peanut butter(1/2)to make a full cup. I also used dk and light brown sugar in total i used less sugar. It turned out great.

I don't usually like it when reviewers change a recipe but I did it too.  I used 3/4 cup soy nut butter instead of peanut, left out the baking soda, added 1 tsp. salt with the hot water and used butter instead of shortening.  baked 8 min. @ 350 for small (1 tsp.) cookies and they came out perfect.  Great recipe for school kids who can't take peanut products to school.

I made these cookies today using this recipe and they are delish!  Could be a little more peanut buttery tasting though, but overall...they're great!!  Next time I make them I may add peanut butter chips to make them extra yummy!

This cookie is great! I decided to make some peanut butter cookies for my boyfriend. Most of the peanut butter cookies I have tried do not have enough peanut butter--so I added the whole small jar of Jif. I made two different batches--one batch I cooked for 7 minutes  and they were chewy and moist. The other I cooked for 9 minutes, because my boyfriend like the crispiness of cookies, and those were good also. I liked the less done ones myself, so I kept those for me! :) Evil plan, eh?

they were delicous and they did stay chewy.  i was unsure taking them out of the oven because they seemed a little too soft, but they were fine. 
i did add a little more peanut butter and vanilla becasue i thought they tasted like shortening.

this is a great recipe....it is very versatile and reminiscent of the cookies my grandmother use to make when I was young.....I made some changes that I thought I would share.....I subbed 1/2 c of margarine and 1/2 c of butter for the shortening.....I used all natural PB (no sugar added).....I subbed 1 tsp of stevia for the cup of  white sugar...and only 1 egg....they turned out delightful and a "little" more user friendly for diabetics......

I'm normally not a fan of p.b. cookies, but my husband loves them so I tried this recipe. I added a little extra crunchy p.b. and had to add some self-rising flour cause I ran out of all-purpose. Even with those changes, these are the prettiest, yummiest p.b. cookies I've ever made.

They tasted very peanut buttery,  But they were cakey.  I was looking for a chewy crispy.  They were just too dense. Both times.

These cookies taste pretty good, did not need to add the extra 1/2c. flour as most did.  In fact I needed moisture.  Did add xtra egg yolk.  The dough was crumbly and when I 1st took these out of the oven they were still very crumbly so I had to leave on baking pan till cool.  But after they were cool they held together but you had to be delicate with them.  Think I will keep trying new recipes or alter this one up some..Thanks for recipe

These are not the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made.  I will keep searching for the perfect recipe.

I think that these cookies turned out great!  After reading the reviews, I decided to add one egg and half a cup of flour to the recipe, and I used chunky peanut butter. I baked them for about 9 minutes, until the edges turned brown, and they turned out fabulous! I might add some vanilla extract next time.  ***Update:  I made these again and added 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and used creamy peanut butter.  Baked at 375 for 11 minutes.  Amazing!

I just made this recipe and the dough is so soft and the variations are endless. I added an entire jar of peanut butter ( my family likes really peanut buttery cookies) and I added an entire bag of chocolate chips, along with extra flour ( around 1/2 a cup or so ). Am still waiting on the first batch to come out of the oven, but if the taste of the dough is anywhere close to the taste of the cookie then this is sure to be a family favorite.

These were fine, but I would try a different recipe next time.  The flavor didn't knock my socks off, and they were a little dry.  But I liked that they used shortening instead of butter or margerine, because I was all out.
