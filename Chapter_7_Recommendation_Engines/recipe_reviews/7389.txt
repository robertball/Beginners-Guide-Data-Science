I made this for a neighbor kid's birhtday.  It was a hit.  I did change it a little.  I used a bundt pan and baked it for about 45 minutes and instead of greasing and flouring, I greased and sugared.  It was just regular white sugar, but it left a pretty (and tasty) crust.

This cake was ok.  If you really want a chocolate chip cake, then it's a good recipe.  I was just not fully committed to the idea.  Plus, the recommended frosting didn't work very well, and the whole mess was just TOO chocolate-y.  Some liked it.  I won't make it again, but that's mostly because I like to try new things.

I made this for my husband's birthday as he was wanting a chocolate chip cake. It's a good cake, but it is rather heavy. I ended up using the Cool Whipped Frosting from this site with it, which worked out well as I think anything else would have made the cake way too rich. It was enjoyed by the whole family, but definitely keep in mind that it's a heavy, rich cake. I think it would probably make good muffins/cupcakes dur to its denseness, but I haven't actually tried it as such yet, so I have no idea how they'd end up baking. I would recommend it as long as you aren't expecting a light, fluffy style cake.

This cake, for one thing, is very rich. I wouldn't recommend using anymore chocolate on it ie: frosting or filling. Instrad, I just used vanilla frosting on it and it turned out great!

I'm torn between giving 4 or 5 stars.  It was very good, but a bit heavy on the baking powder.  It affects the taste, more so as leftovers.  I made a simple icing (2T butter creamed with 1 c powdered sugar, then whisked 2 T milk into it) which worked well.  Served it with vanilla ice cream.  I would like to try it again with less baking powder.  I'll try to remember to edit this review after I tinker a bit.  However, I do think this was a good cake, and did not taste "healthy" despite the wheat flour.  I got compliments from family & guests!  And that's why I voted 5 stars instead of 4.

After reading other reviews, I made some changes to this recipe.  I decreased the amount of baking powder to 2 tsp and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  I baked it in a bundt pan, and buttered and cinnamon-sugared the pan instead of butter and flouring it.  This posed a problem, as half the cake stuck & I was going to take a picture of it to put on here!  I used Ghiradelli dark chocolate chips, chopped up-- it was delicious!

Been looking for a good recipe for awhile, and this wasn't it.  Yes it tasted of chocolate, but that's about it, the 'cake' part was completely unimpressive.  I had to compensate by putting a layer of caramel between the layers and then topping the whole thing with ganache.  Those additions were great but I'll keep searching for a "GOOD" chocolate chip cake recipe.

A little bit on the heavy side, but very very tasty! Use a chocolate glaze on top

We baked this one 3 weeks ago. My son just requested this for his birthday! It must be good! I put chocolate pudding in the middle and frost with chocolate frosting.

Since previous reviewers said the recipe was heavy, I substituted all white flour for the whole wheat and separated the eggs. I added the yolks when the original recipe called for, but beat the whites, including one extra egg white, then folded them into the mixed batter right before putting it in the pans. I also used sour milk instead of regular milk. This turned out wonderfully-- very light! In the past week, I have made the cake twice: once for a large party using a Nutella frosting, and then on Thanksgiving Day topped with a fudge icing. Got rave reviews each time. I like the changes and will be using this recipe in the future.

If you are not a fan of wheat flour this may not be a favorite for you. I'd like to sub the wheat flour for more white flour and maybe a bit more vanilla. The texture of the cake was great, taste was kinda floury.

In my pursuit of making things I like at least a little healthier, I adjusted this recipe by doing the following: Substituting coconut oil for butter, using soy milk instead of regular milk, and using all egg whites.  It was really good!  I agree with others that the cake is a little heavy and dense, but it makes sense.

I was looking for a chocolate chip cake recipe to replace one I lost to make for my teen son whose grandfather was dying--and this was even better than my original.  I used King Arthur white flour for all of it in lieu of whole wheat, a 12 oz. package of Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips, and baked it in a tube pan for roughly 43 minutes.  Right out of the oven I shook granulated white sugar on top for a sweet crunch.  Delicious with absolutely no leavening taste whatsoever, as was one reviewer's experience.  The chocolate was the perfect amount, and the crumb very moist.  This will be a staple for my son and his friends.  Thank you, Lil!

I used all white sugar and coffee instead of milk.  Very sugary.  I liked it, but it's not for those who are diabetic or don't like a strong sugar taste.

Cake is very sweet and heavy.  The second time I made it, I reduced both sugars by 1/4 cup.  The family eats it, but it didn't make the cut for the family cookbook.

I beat the whites separately and added them at the end and used white instead of brown sugar and used it for cupcakes. I also tossed the chocolate chips with flour before adding so they wouldn't sink to the bottom. Delicious!

Not enough butter & too many eggs. End result: I added 3T extra of butter than recommended in the recipe, but kept the 3 eggs, and the cake turned out to be moist enough, but too tough (probably due to too many eggs). Tasty enough but I will use a different recipe, next time.

I made this cake and once I put the choco chips in it smelt and tasted really wheat-y and maybe too healthy for cake. I was disappointed but put it in the oven. It actually started to smell really good! Then when I took it out it was really good but still had that healthy taste.

I took  Rachel's advice and did the extra whipped up egg white trick, and I also put a bit of lemon juice and the vanilla into the milk (letting it sit for 4 or  minutes). I scattered the batter with roughly chopped chocolate (dark and milk) and this is yummy.

We personally all loved this recipe. I think it would have been great without the chocolate chips also. It is rich- but I like desserts that way. My husband does not like flour cakes but he really enjoyed this. That says a lot. I just added a light frosting made with cocoa, water, and powdered sugar. The whole cake was eaten within 2 days!

This is a dense, chocolatey cake. Simple, but delicious, and hits the spot if you are a fan of rich cakes and chocolate (like me!). I did not use any icing, and don't think it's necessary.
