This recipe was recommend by the Recipe Group on the Buzz - I am sooo glad I made it.  I made the full amount of sauce (used the suggested Mirin instead of sherry)  - but only 2 thighs and 3 small boneless skinless breasts. I used about a 1/3 of the marinade for the chicken - the rest I heated on the stovetop and reduced a bit - used some of that to paint the chicken with while cooking. I did do these on the grill instead of the broiler of the oven. Served with coleslaw, rice and steamed broccoli. The extra sauce was perfect drizzled over the rice and broccoli.  Hubby said - "10 stars - next time double the garlic and I would give it 20 stars!"  He dislikes broccoli but even ate the steamed broccoli with this sauce.  Keeper!  Thanks so much for a great recipe, Mama Smith!

Made this with *Recipe Group* 4-10-13. We liked it a lot. Using 2 bone-in breasts marinated for two overnights made for super juicy chicken. Only used 1/3 of the marinade in the plastic bag reserving the rest. I baked the breasts uncovered in a 375 degree oven for 35 minutes then grilled it to crisp up the skin. I strained the baking pan drippings into a saucepan and made a rue for thickening up the reserved marinade. Served it up with rice pilaf and corn.

Made for Recipe Group. I used boneless skinless breasts for this, and some white wine (I buy the little bottles). Researching Huli Huli a little, it is supposed to be grilled not baked. However, I will say that high temp oven cooking (if there had been skin on these)would have crisped the skin, as the outside of the breasts did become a little hardened. Not bad hard, just not soft like a normal baked chicken. The marinade basting didn't seem to have any effect until I thickened it with some cornstarch, then basted. That did the trick, stayed on nicely and gave a nice finish on them. While I found the soy a little overpowering for me, the guys enjoyed them immensely and the sauce I held out and thickened for gravy went over fine on the mashed potatoes I made to go with it. I would like to try this again on the grill when it gets to come out from the winter. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm rating only 3 stars based on the instructions.  I liked the marinade but I would never use marinade that raw chicken sat in to baste anything.

This is really tasty! I was only cooking for 2 so I cut the recipe back. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts so I changed the cooking method because I was afraid they would dry out. I marinated for 8 hours and then dumped the marinade and chicken into a skillet heated on medium high. I cooked 5 minutes on each side until chicken was done. Next time I will not cut the marinade back because it makes a great "gravy" for the white rice served on the side.

AMAZING. I grilled both chicken bone-in and boneless thighs - so tender and sweet. I saved some marinade to baste while grilling. A great summer recipe! Thanks!

This was a Recipe Group’s selection for April 6, 2013.  I used chicken thighs and marinated it all day, but wish I had marinated overnight as it added fabulous flavor.  I didn’t have any green onions so I substituted with a shallot.  I baked the thighs with the sauce in the oven for thirty minutes before putting it on the grill.  I then continued to cook down the sauce, strained it, and drizzled it over the rice.  This was delicious.

For Recipe Group 4/8/13 - This chicken was very, very tasty. I usually only do the least amount of marinade time possible but I'm glad I went with doing it overnight. Totally worth the wait. I made some minor changes but nothing too out there. First of all, I adjusted the recipe for 6 servings but only used 6 chicken breasts. I didn't have sherry, so I used extra pineapple juice instead. When it came to cook time, I preheated the oven at 425* F, but instead of putting it in the broiler right away, I put it in the oven. Let it cook 10 minutes, flipped it, basted it with the marinade and let it cook another 10 minutes. During that 10 minutes, I thicken the rest of the marinade with 1 tbsp of cornstarch on the stove-top. Then I flipped the chicken, basted it with the thickened sauce, moved the pan to the broiler and cooked for another 10 minutes. Finally, I flipped it again, basted it and broiled for another 5 minutes to get nice char on top. Once out, I basted it a final time and let it rest for about 5 minutes and then sliced. My family absolutely loved it. Usually, they hate when I make back to back chicken recipes but there wasn't one grumble or complaint. I will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe and so do my guests! I prefer to prepare on the grill verses cooking in the oven, especially in the summer. When grilling, I continue to baste and turn the chicken almost every 4 minutes so the meat stays really moist. This recipe is quick and easy to prepare and is always a big hit. The fresh ginger and garlic really add to the flavor. As an alternative recipe, I've also sliced the chicken after preparation and put into toasted tortilla shells with melted sharp cheddar, fresh cilantro, avocado and pico de gallo. This is a great way to serve as a finger food and works perfect for tailgating parties!

My family loved this. I used frozen chicken breast and put all ingredients in a crock pot on high for about 6 hours. Then removed drippings and reduced it on the stove with cornstarch to make a thick sauce. Served over brown rice, delish!

Recipe Group Selection:  06, April 2013 ~ We had 2 selections this week, this being one of them.  This was a good recipe to use bone-in chicken.  I used part of the marinade for the chicken, and cooked down the rest to use on the rice and chicken when serving.  We had a nice day and decided to grill rather than bake.  It got brown on the grill, looking at the picture you would think it was burnt, but it wasn’t in the least.  The chicken had lots of flavor and it paired nicely with sticky rice and ‘Cabbage on the Grill’ another AR recipe.

Fantastic recipe.  I sub turkey for the chicken and allowed to marinate for 12+ hours.  I baked at 375 for 1 hour and turned part way through cooking.  Full of flavour.  Will do again.

I did this as indicated other than using all drumsticks (because doing whole bird parts on the broiler always results in overdone drums/wings by the time the breasts and thighs are done, in my oven). With that said, the sauce never stuck to my chicken, so for the final basting I thickened the sauce on the stovetop with cornstarch and then it stuck beautifully. The sauce/marinade is delicious on the chicken, on the rice, and on the steamed broccoli I made. But we did not like the way the skin stayed kind of rubbery and the way that the sauce was not sticking at all. In the future I would do this in a pan with BLSL chicken breasts submerged in the pre-thickened sauce or else on the grill basted with the pre-thickened sauce (with or without skin on the grill, as is your preference). As the skin texture issue is just a thing with us I didn't hold that against the recipe but this marinade really does need to be thickened before use as a basting sauce or over rice. Thickening is such an easy step especially since you've got to boil that leftover marinade nonstop in order to use it without re-contaminating it anyway. P.S. I used mirin and it was awesome, sherry does not hold a candle to it. Thanks for sharing!

Was so excited to make this recipe as we had just visited Hawaii, but we didn't have the opportunity to eat it there and we were really craving it.

My husband is a BBQ wiz and makes teriyaki and other marinaded meats all the time.  But this recipe has one important tip missing. There is a do not exceed time on the marinade. Our meat came out mushy.  

We couldn't figure out why, but after researching, we learned that marinading with pineapple juice can do that.  (We don't use pineapple in our teriyaki chicken.)  We did marinade it for 14 hours! So probably use less time.

I used blsl chicken breasts.  When baked as indicated, they did not turn golden brown. Half way through, I decided to turn on the broiler to see if I could get a more appealing color.  As marinades go, this is basically a sweet teriyaki sauce.  I know the “huli, huli” is what makes this recipe a special Hawaiian dish, but there are other baked teriyaki chicken recipes out there that do not require the constant turning and taste just as good, if not better.

This was fantastic entree that I prepared today. I made minor modifications due to the fact that I had mixed recipes up. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars.  I increased the ketchup  to 3/4 cup and brown sugar to one cup as that was what the other recipe called for.  After tasting before marinating,  I did add more pineapple juice.  Marinated for 5 hours and then I grilled the chicken breasts on the grill basting with reserved marinade not used on the chicken.  Complete kid and hubby pleaser. Working into the summer menu rotation.  I feel like this recipe is a winner as is but I'm glad I made my mistake and ended up with a slightly different version of huli huli. Thank you for sharing!

This marinade made the chicken so juicy, my guests raved. I made extra marinade, so that my husband could baste with marinade that had no raw chicken juice in it. He grilled it on the barbeque grill, and turned it every 10 minutes, but he forgot to baste it much, and one batch, he did not baste at all. However, the chicken was still very flavorful and juicy. Sometimes breast meat on the grill can get dried out, but this had running juices after grilling! It would probably have more marinade flavor if you remembered to baste it as directed, but even if you don't, the flavor and juiciness will be wonderful. We will use this recipe again.

My husband  usually prefers oven fried chicken over other chicken recipes, but he loved this.  Cooked until the breast piece registered 160 degrees, but that made it a bit dry.  Next time will take it out at 155 degrees.   Prepared only 2 pieces but made enough gravy for 1/2 the recipe (4 servings).  Heated the remaining marinade to kill the germs, then used it as a gravy for the rice.  Only marinaded chicken for 3 hours.  Next time will plan ahead and marinate overnight.  Was delicious, nevertheless.

"This is excellent", said George. I thought so too. I used this marinade on country style pork ribs instead of chicken. I did not have sherry on hand so omitted that ingredient. After leaving the pork in the marinade for 6 hours, I covered with foil and cooked them in the toaster oven at 250 degrees for 90 mintues. We finished them up on the outdoor grill and cooked the pork for an additional 20 minutes. I will definately make this again with pork or chicken.

We really enjoyed it! I used 2 large bone-in chicken breasts and halved the marinade. I left them in the fridge over night. While the oven preheated, I boiled the marinade, reduced the temp and let it simmer to thicken to use as a baste. I will definitely make this again and grill it next time. Thank you!!

Made this for Recipe Group the week of 4/6/13. This was just "ok" for me. Actually, I took 1 bite & made myself eggs instead but my daughter liked it. The soy sauce was overpowering & even tho I used a low sodium soy, it was still too salty. There are MANY recipes on here w/a very similar taste profile & this one just flopped for me. The sauce is also a muddy brown, extremely unappetizing looking. I'm sorry :(

I made this for Recipe Group on the Buzz for April 6, 2013. I used three chickens quarter and marinated it overnight. I used half of the marinade for the chickens and half reduced it on the stove for sauce. I did not use the sherry but added a little bit of hot sauce. I used 5 cloves of garlic. I also reduced the soy sauce. I served it with white rice and steamed broccoli. I like this recipe and definitely will make it again

Made this for Recipe Group...Wonderful! Scaled the recipe back and used chicken breasts. I poured 1/2 the marinade into the bag w/ the chicken and saved the other 1/2 to reduce down to pour over top...YUM! This came out so moist and tender...this is a keeper, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used this recipe with chicken breast instead of whole chicken (only because it's what I had - I'm sure this is super delicious with bone-in!). I didn't use sherry wine nor the substitute (I didn't have anything close), used spicy mustard instead of dry mustard, and ginger paste instead of fresh ginger. 

Aside from all those substitutions, the chicken came out pretty good! It wasn't glazed but that was probably because there was no skin. I put the rest of the marinade in a small sauce pan and cooked it over low heat as a sauce/glaze.

The Huli Huli chicken was delicious.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  In retrospect, the next time that I make this, I will likely use skin on - bone on chicken to create a crunchy rich flavored outer texture.  I'd also reserve some of the delicious marinade and glaze it in a skillet to pour over the top like you see in the picture.  Served it with wild rice made with Teriyaki, scallion and pineapple.  It was a great compliment.

used a full can of frozen concentrated pineapple (undiluted) (thinking I was doubling the recipe and then didn’t) so left out the brown sugar. It was really good.....boiled down to make it thick. Yum.

Perfect recipe as is, the only difference is that I made it with chicken stew pieces and I grilled it on my stove. I also noticed the dry mustard was not included in the instructions, but I added it into the sauce anyway.  I also used the leftover marinade to make a sauce by adding some cornstarch, and it was perfect. Delicious!

Very good recipe.  I grilled the chicken instead of cooking it on the oven and I wouldn't recommend using the leftover marinade as a baste since the raw chicken was sitting in it.

Doubled the marinate. Cooked on stovetop until thickened. This made a delicious topping for the rice and chicken.   I made chicken breasts and thighs in the oven as directed. The thighs were more tender and tasty so I would use thighs only next time. Also would line pan with foil to help with cleanup. Added coleslaw to compliment meal. I would definitely make this again.

This is an amazing chicken dish! We all ate until we were stuffed--can't wait to make it again.
We did Port wine instead of sherry, and used a flavored rice.
One of my all time favorites for chicken now!
I will reserve some the marinade before adding the chicken to it next time for basting during cooking--this way the reserved marinade is not contaminated with raw chicken.
We did not baste during the cooking process for that reason.
But happily, it did not diminish our joy over the results :)

This was really good. I was hoping for something on the sweet side, so I added some honey. And I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used ground.  I only had about 20 minutes to marinade but still tasted great.  I cooked bite sized pieces in hot oil for about ten minutes. Served stir fry veggies, rice, and edamame on the side. It was a hit with the family!

I only rated it 4 stars because I thought it was too sour. If you like sweet & sour (more on the sour side), you'll love it. I personally would cut back on the pineapple juice. I marinated it overnight, and baked it. I had saved some of the marinade to make a sauce with. Hubby thanked me! He put it on rice. Other than that it came out quite good and the hubby & kid liked it.

Easy and tasty!  Made this for friends and there were no leftovers.  I served it over jasmine rice.  Big hit!  I cooked the boneless skinless chicken breast in a slow cooker on high for 4 hours. I added cornstarch to thicken the gravy.   The second time....I used boneless skinless thighs and served with steamed broccoli.  Easy and quick.

Wow!  I made this chicken tonight and the entire family loved it.  I made a few substitutions.  I used Bragg's Amino Acids in place of soy sauce for my daughter, who is gluten-free, and used Splenda Brown-Sugar Blend in place of brown sugar.  I marinated my boneless, skinless chicken breasts overnight and cooked them on the grill over medium heat, turning and basting every 2 1/2 minutes for about 8-10 minutes (smaller breasts came off sooner).  I also grilled some fresh pineapple and basted it with the sauce.  Delicious!  Can't wait to have it again!

OMG this was AMAZING!  I used boneless pork short ribs instead of chicken, and it was delicious!  I didn't have sherry so I used a splash of ACV and Dry Vermouth.  I only marinaded the pork with half the marinade and reduced the other half to make a sauce. Cooked the pork on the grill and made rice and coleslaw to go with it.  I had leftover sauce and it made an awesome sauce for a stir-fry the next day with the leftover pork!  I will be using this again!

We used skinless chicken breast & baked on 350.  It was good, but we have other recipes similar to this that are a little more flavorful so we won't be making this again. If we didn't like our other recipe better I'd have kept this recipe.

We used boneless, skinless breasts.  Since they were thin, we baked at 375 for 10 minutes. Only thing we changed in the marinade was the substitution of 4 tsp of ground ginger for the fresh.  Delicious!
