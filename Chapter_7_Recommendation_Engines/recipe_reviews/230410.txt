Oops! Forgot to get a picture for you.....YUMMY for sure! My husband loves it! I just made this recipe as described although I had a slightly smaller roast. The combo of pork, apple, onion and beer is right on! Can't think of any way that I would change it! Thanks Matty! Happy to be the first of what I think will be many 5 star reviews!

I made this recipe for our New Years dinner today and my family really enjoyed it.  It is really easy to prepare.  Thank you for sharing.

I was very disappointed in this. The more I tried to fix it, the worse it got.  I ended up pulling out the meat and tried to salvage it by making dumplings to fry in with the meat.  Never again

Disappointed.  I was really excited about this recipe but it turned out to be a dud for us.  Ours baked for 3.5 hours and was still swimming in juices - I knew there was no way it'd be cooked off in 30 minutes, so I ended up dumping a bunch off.  This probably dumped off a lot of the sweetness.  What was left tasted like beer soaked apples and kraut.  I'm giving two stars because I really liked the flavor of the pork - it was quite delicious.  Unfortunately, I think there are much better ways of getting good flavored pork.  This one is going on our DNR list - Do Not Repeat.  Sorry. :(

Made this for New Year's Day's dinner. The roast turned out very tender and everything had a nice taste to it. It was quite watery, though. But, then again, I used two cans of kraut, so that could be the reason. I might forego the can of beer and not drain the kraut next time and see how it turns out. I like a stronger sauerkraut taste, so that might do the trick. Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper!

Being Pennsylvania Dutch, pork and sauerkraut is a staple, particularly on New Year's Day.  This is, hands down, the most flavorful pork and sauerkraut recipe I have tasted or made.  Not sure how someone could mess this up!

Easy Peasy. Accidentally left it in too long, but it was completely salvageable. Definitely will make again, this time keeping a closer eye on the time. I also added yams and dusted everything lightly with cinnamon for an extra accent.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of doubling the amount of sauerkraut. The recipe was easy to put together and the results were great. Thanks for sharing.

Slow cooked roasts are scary, but this turned out perfectly. Put it in the oven and forget it. When it comes out, the apples, onion and sauerkraut will have blended into a magnificent sauce, and the pork is fork tender.

Delicious. I uncover at the end for a half hour to brown the roast. So good and so easy.

Made this recipe tonight to rave reviews by both my husband and toddler. The three year old rated it "the BEST chicken EVER, mommy!!" (Yes, I know it is pork. Him, not so much. 
The only thing that I changed was swapping the beer for a bottle of hard cider, as that was what I had handy. The cider gave it just enough extra sweetness, that, to my surprise, my son (the 3 year old) even ate the sauerkraut!! I will definitely make this again. If you have someone unsure about the flavor of kraut, I suggest trying hard cider in place of beer. It was amazing. FABULOUS recipe. Definitely making again. :)

I made this is the slow cooker instead and it turned out wonderful. I used chicken broth instead of beer only because I didn't have beer. I would like to try it with beer next time. Very easy to prepare and yummy indeed.

Thanks for posting this recipe. It was a hit with my family.  I especially liked the apples in the recipe.  They were sweet and reminded me of applesauce.  There was too much liquid, so I think I will add 1/2 bottle of beer next time I make this.  This is definitely a recipe I will use again.

Delicious and super easy.  I seared the roast first which assured it would be moist after cooking.  I seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic salt and Lawry's seasoning while searing.  I did not need to add any more beer once the roast went in the oven, it stayed very juicy.  Cooked at 275 the roast was done in 3 hours.

My mom normally makes this every year for New Year's.  I did not have beer on hand, so I substituted white wine (Pinot Grigio)   Sauerkraut turned out great however I like the pork better with beer.

Made this for New Years Day and wow! This recipe was a sure hit. I will definitely make this again. I seared it on all sides before placing it in the oven. After searing, I then added a few shakes of Peychaud's Bitters and juice from one freshly squeezed orange. Baked for 3 to 31/2 hours on 325 degrees. Delicious!!

This was easy and tasted great. I made it for New Years Day and everyone loved it. I ended up turning the oven up to 300, and then to 375 the last 30 minutes or so to brown the meat. I added more sauerkraut. The meat was really tender and went well with the sauerkraut mixture. Mashed potatoes on the side were a great accompaniment.  Will be making this again.
