This was an easy recipe.  BUT then again, I didn't have any egg, so I didn't do the breading portion of the directions.  Very tasty and lighter dinner...the quinoa is a nice touch, rather than pasta.  You could also do spaghetti squash as a substitute and lighter on the carbs.  I had all ingredients (except egg, I couldn't decide if milk was an ok sub for it, so I omitted it) in the kitchen, so that was a nice and easy summer dinner dish.  We liked it.
