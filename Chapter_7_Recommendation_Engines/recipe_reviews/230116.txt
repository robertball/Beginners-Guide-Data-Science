Make room on your gluten free Holiday table for this stuffing. Or better yet, don't wait for a holiday and just make it now. It's really good. I cheated and toasted my bread slices in the toaster instead of cooking them in the oven. I also only used 1 onion and the flavor was out of this world. Any more onion and I don't think that balance would be there. The fresh herbs really make this and when you start to mix it up in the bowl you can't help but smile at that familiar stuffing aroma catapulting you back to grandma's house. And it's so easy to make, to boot. Thank you for the recipe.

Great stuffing. Didn’t add leek or marjoram (didn’t have any). The first time I made it I toasted the bread too much and it was dry (one kid loved it this way). I was afraid it was going to be too wet so didn’t add all the broth. The second time I watched to make sure the bread was golden and used broth accordingly. Both times I brushed melted butter on the bread and added dry seasonings to the bread as it baked so it would take on the flavor. I then added the fresh herbs to the stuffing as it baked. I’d make this in lieu of the boxed gf stuffing every time.

Followed the recipe and everyone loved the result. I didn't tell anyone it was gluten free until they'd all commented on how good it was. The only change I made was to leave the bread in the oven for an extra 15 minutes or so and I added melted butter and various seasonings to the bread before putting it in the oven. Added a bit more broth to be sure it was well covered then put it inside the turkey. Perfection!  Will definitely make it again.

It wasn’t a hit at my house.  I followed the recipe but it just didn’t work out.

Disappointed. Followed recipe exactly. Everyone who took it, just left it on their plate -uneaten.
