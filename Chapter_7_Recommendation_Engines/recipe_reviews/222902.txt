Needed a side dish to pair with our middle-eastern grilled chicken kebabs and wanted to use what we had on hand and found this. I really loved it but for my family,it was so-so because they're not much of a brown rice lover.  Made little changes such as using tri-colored lentils (green, brown, & yellow) and chicken broth instead of water.

I have no idea what majadara is supposed to taste like.  This is the first time I have ever had it, but this recipe is fabulous!  I substituted the fresh garlic for 1/16 tsp garlic powder (because that's what I had around the house).  I think this will become one of our staples.  YUMMY!  Thank you for sharing!

I liked this dish.  I added more spice to it however.  I first tempered my spices by heating them in two tablespoons of oil.  I didn't use cinnamon but I put in 3 small fresh curry leaves, 2-3 hefty teaspoons of cumin-coriander powder, a pinch of ground cardamom, and dash of tumeric.  I sauteed the onions in this, then added the lentils and rice.  

Without additional spices it would have been too bland for my family, but the bones of the recipe are good and I would recommend it to others.

I loved the flavor.  I think the recipe assumed that the lentils were soaked, and thus full of water, because the 2.5 cups is only enough for the rice.  With the adjustment, I'll make this again and again!

Turned out much better than I expected, even though I didn't have a full cup of lentils to add in.  Chicken stock to replace the water adds some extra flavor.  2 of my 3 kids ate it up happily, so I count that a success!

First time: I made without the lentils and half the amount of pepper and it tasted great!  With the lentils next time.
Second time: included the lentils and after 55+ minutes the lentils weren't cooked :( going to need to try over 65 minutes next time.  The overall taste is very promising.

This is so yummy!  The touch of cinnamon makes it sweet and exotic.  Next time I'd reduce the pepper since my son doesn't like anything spicy.  My husband suggested diced tomatoes too, since it was a little dry. (I think he's just used to Spanish rice.)  :-)

My only change was I didn't have fresh ginger so I used 1/2 tsp ground ginger. The dish was very good but still too much ginger taste. I think 1/4 tsp ground ginger will be perfect.

I loved it! I have to add more water half way during cooking time, and I waited on the salt so family could add as desired.

Flavor was great but it definitely needed more liquid. I used about 3.5 cups total.  2 cups chicken broth and 1.5  water.  Also used 1/2 tsp ginger paste in place of fresh ginger.  Those adjustments and about 15 mins extra cook time resulted in a tasty dish!

Easy, tasty, but needs WAY more water as others have noted. I ended up adding 4 cups of water, possibly more (thus 4/5 stars). Also substituted spring onions which added a touch of green. Topped with roasted chicken, a yogurt-spice sauce and cilantro - even the kids went back for seconds, and my daughter raved about what a fantastic cook I am!

I used a ginger miso broth from Trader Joe‚Äôs in place of water, and needed way more liquid than the 2.5 cups called for (I used over 4 cups). I doubled the cumin and added 1/2 tsp ground coriander and a pinch of crushed red pepper. It turned out delicious and I‚Äôll definitely be making it regularly!

Great recipe for a healthy and hearty dish! I thought I followed this one exactly until I realized it called for brown rice and I used white (oops). I didn't have any issues with the amount of water or the cooking time as some of the other reviewers have. I think the rice toasted a little in the pan for a couple minutes extra while I was digging around for lentils.  Once the water was in, it cooked as directed on low flame and everything came out tender. I like that there is not too much salt and enjoy the flavor, but might add to it next time for a spicy taste (cayenne and more garlic) but that's just personal preference and still love it as is.

The only reason this is 4 stars and not 5 is because of the time and water to rice and lentil ratio. I've been upping the amount of water as it dries out and rice remains crunchy. I've been cooking for about 40 minutes now. I've tasted several times and (despite the crunchy rice) it has a wonderful flavor! Used 2 cups of chicken stock and water combo, and then red lentils. Yummmmm!!!!

I ended up using 3 cups of water and cooking it for 60 minutes,  but it came out wonderfully. This was my first time cooking lentils and my 14 month old daughter and I loved it!!! We will be having this again.
