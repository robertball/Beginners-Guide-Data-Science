I've been walking around the house for 2 weeks now saying to my husband "I know I made the most wonderful pork tenderloin recipe recently but I can't find it!". I was sure it came from this site but I didn't save it in my recipe box, and when I searched on pork tenderloin it didn't come up. Happily, today I found a PAPER copy of this recipe and remembered that YES! I did make an incredible pork tenderloin recently and this is it!!!! Absolutely fantastic. I have now saved it to my recipe box, needless to say. I substituted goat cheese for the gorgonzola because I prefer it, and it turned out just fabulous. Thanks for the very memorable recipe.

Instead of brandy I used twice as much chicken stock... even my sister who doesn't eat pork LOVED it! Next time I'm going to try feta instead of gorgonzola cheese for a little different flavor.

Very good.  It was spicier and sweeter than I was expecting.  I cannot imagine how in the world anyone would call it oily or bland.  It was neither, and I'm very sensitive to both of those things, oiliness in particular.  In fact, the hot pepper jam was almost a little overpowering.  However, everyone raved about it at the party I brought it to.  Mine took about 20 minutes in the oven though.

I made this recipe a while ago and couldn't find my written copy and FINALLY was able to find it here.

GREAT GREAT GREAT!

I don't understand the comments about oily and bland.  Only 4 Tbls of olive oil and the sauce is made with pepper jelly.  I did mix a little hot and mostly mild jelly with it.

My husband loves this recipe and I have used it for a very special anniversary party and it was a huge hit.  Everyone asked for the recipe.

Thanks for posting this!  I'll be looking for more of your recipes.

Just made this recipe again for company.  I can't tell you how many compliments I received.  

This recipe is a keeper!

We were impressed with this!  I had to scale it way back for the two of us and I used two boneless pork chops instead of the tenderloin.  I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch and water, because I thought it was quite thin.  And I used feta rather than the gorgonzola.  The major change I made was in the plating of this dish.  I spooned a pool of sauce on the plate, topped it with the pork chops (which Hubs had grilled) and then piled on the pepper/shallot mixture.  Sprinkled the top with feta and it was GORGEOUS, as well as DELICIOUS!  The only change I would make next time is to cut back on the jelly – it was just a little too sweet for us, but that’s just a personal preference.  One word of caution – the “heat” in this recipe will be determined by the pepper jelly you use.  Some are a lot hotter than others.

Impressive and delicious dish.  Used bourbon instead of brandy, dried herbs instead of fresh, and feta cheese.  Surprisingly fast and easy.
