I would try using a double boiler to heat filling. I kept scorching the flan using a regular saucepan. Otherwise, it tasted great

I used non-fat evaporated milk in place of regular milk (only because i didn't have enough on hand), and had no problems with the filling. Just kept an eye on it and stirred often. Not overly sweet, which is good, and the pineapple flavor really stood out. Also, I didn't have pineapple slices, so used crushed, which worked fine. Light, yummy and different!

This recipe was very delicious! I made it for my grandparents' anniversary and they were thrilled! I would like to add, however, that the taste was slightly off target for me - there was a bit of awkward "lightness" to the taste... it's hard to explain. Nevertheless, the flan was great and very artistic, thanks to the slices on top and the apricot glaze! It was fun, easy, and brought out the artistic cook in me!

this was pretty good.... my first time making anything thing like this...   mixed milk and flour in mixer.... still had a little flour taste to it..... and had apricot preserves....  will make this again for sure and use the flan base for other fruits too...
