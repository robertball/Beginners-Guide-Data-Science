I made these the other day and they turned out great.  I hate to see how a person such as "kmmishler" down there can mess up the rating for this.  I also suppose her entire family has gone into cardiac arrest after eating all of the fat that she is supposed to be FRYING FOOD IN and NOT mixing it in the dough. (along w/ the 7 and counting that considered her helpful)

The 8 cups of shortening are for frying.  Only 2 tablespoons actually go into the sopapillas.

Need to verify ingredients.  Hard to believe it takes 8 cups of shortening to make 32 Sopapillas!

Tried the recipe with both honey and the cinnamon sugar.  Both myself and the kids preferred the cinnamon sugar.  The recipe gave us a different type of dessert.  The dough was easy to work with and quick to fry.  Very delicious.

WOW! I made these as a snack for my 5 year old and I tonight, so I cut the recipe in half, and we still didn't finish them.  Not eating them up has nothing to do with taste, however.  These are fantastic!  I will definately have to make these up next time I have company.  They are so easy to make, and so good!  I will without a doubt be making these again

Made these for the 1st time at a party recently and they flew off the plate - wonderful fresh, and hot, and it was so incredibly easy!!  I did have to add some extra water to make it dough-y enough - but you can tell how much water you need as you go along. Go by feel.

My kids loved these, although they would probably eat their vegetables if I coated them in enough cinnamon sugar. My Mexican MIL got a good laugh out of them, however. Maybe I added too much water or my oil was too hot, but the texture was not very appealing. I will probably try them again before I swallow my pride and get her recipe.

These were really good although I'm still searching for a recipe as good as my Grandpa used to make.  Perhaps it was just Grandpa's touch!  Anyhow, these did turn out well for me.  I read the reviews and some had commented that they weren't sweet enough - well they aren't supposed to be.  Sopapillas can be eaten with a savory dish as well as sweetened up with honey, etc.  Anyway, thanks for the post.  Still working on perfecting my sopapillas!

Easy and yummy!!!  1/2 the recipe is plenty for a family of four.  I even messed up and added too much water but still came out good. 8 cups shortening is a reasonable amount to use for frying.  Also depends on what you fry in...I used an electric skillet and since I made 1/2 the recipe I also cut shortening to 4 cups worked fine!!!!!!

These were really,really good. I made them for few friends coming over. I made 2 different kinds, one was with cinnisugar and the other with a syrup made of 2 cups water, 1 cups sugar, and some orange juice and zest. The syrup will be done when it is a bit thicker, or not as watery as is was, or at least after it reached rapid boiling stage. The sopapillas with this syrup tasted like an arabic fried cookie dipped in the same syrup. Thanx for sumbitting this recipe Ellin. It was great!!!!

Just like grandma's!!. Only one small detail. They will taste much better if lard is used instead of shortening. Shortening was never used back in the days. Also in regard to K Misher, she fail to read that the 8 cups of shortening was to fry them. My grand ma will only use oil to fry. Good day all.

I made this for an after school snack for my 4 kids. They LOVED it! It was easy and quick to make. I cut the recipe in half and I played it by ear on the water (i had to add more). Great recipe. I will definitely make this again.

Sopaipillas are a very versatile bread.  I am from New Mexico and the recipe displayed here we call  bunuelos.  Sopaipillas are used for savory foods and are usually stuffed with cooked pinto beans, chile and various other New Mexican foods.  Sopaipillas have even been stuffed with scrambled eggs!!  Sometimes when used as a dessert bread, we apply honey.  YUM YUM!!!  I live in the UK now but I still miss the wonderful flavors of New Mexico.

The sopapilla is a New Mexican invention, most likely a variation on old style Navajo fry bread.  And it's more of a bread to eat with meals than a dessert as presented here.  Lose the cinnamon and sugar coating and use the sopapilla like a tortilla (i.e., like a spoon) when eating chili or a bowl of refrieds.
