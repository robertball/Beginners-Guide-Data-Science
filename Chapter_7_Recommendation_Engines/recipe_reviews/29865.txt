I made this for a caard party I was attending, it was a huge success.  I did only use about a Â½ can of pumpkin. (I had tried a similar dip at a party and found it to pumpkiny)I kept tasting it as I folded in the pumpkin, and stoped when I thought it was just right. I servered it with molassas cookies, everyone wanted the recipe. Will make often this fall. It was also good with apple slices!!

This is a great, easy recipe.  To make it extra special serve it in a small hollowed out pumpkin.  The best cookies to serve with are gingersnaps!

this is a great dip, especially if you love pumpkin.  it has a unique taste, and is good with graham crackers, cookies, or pretty much anything else you can think of to dip in it.  even my kids thought it was great!

Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  I did not have time to bake a pumpkin pie this year and this was my favorite out of ALL the food we had.  We dipped with thin ginger snaps and I only added 1 jar of marshmallow and used pumpkin pie spice.  I could drink that stuff.  Ha!

I have had numerous versions of this.  My favorite calls for eliminating the marshmallow creme and replacing with 1 cup of confectioners sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon and1 tsp nutmeg.  I luckily have a ceramic pumpkin bowl so I make it all year round!

Such a simple dip to make! I used about a jar and a little of the marshmallow stuff, and it tasted just fine.

I took this to a Halloween party.  I thought this was an easy recipe, though it didn't get the rave reviews that I expected.  In fact, very few people even tried it.  My three kids, however, loved it - even the one that doesn't like pumpkin!  I substituted a teaspoon pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon and added 1/4 cup powdered sugar for a sweeter taste.  I agree with the reviewer that said to be sure the cream cheese was completely softened and also with the reviewer who creamed the pumpkin and cream cheese before adding the marshmallow cream.  Otherwise, you may end up with little lumps of cream cheese that don't look very appealing (ask me how I know).  It was probably the least popular dish at the party and no one commented on it at all.  In spite of that, I'll be making this again.  My family and I enjoyed it.

i made the recipe as is at first, but ended up adding a little powdered sugar to taste because i thought it needed a little extra sweetness. i also added some pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon & served with ginger snap cookies. it was good when i made it, but even better the next day once everything blended! thank you for this recipe.

Quick and easy with minimal ingredients. Just make sure the cream cheese is really soft. I actually mix in the cream cheese with the pumpking then fold in the marshmallow. Served in a baby pumpkin with apples, ginger snaps and graham crackers. A great fall recipe. I liked this recipe better better than the "pumpkin dip" recipe also on this site.

This was just ok.  I think I added a little orange peel to mine and served this with ginger snaps.  We made this around the holidays and it didn't get too much attention, but it was a pretty dip and had a smooth texture.  The pumpkin taste was very light...maybe too much marshmallow cream.  Not sure if I'll try it again.  Thanks Julie

I served this with ginger snap cookies - delicious...I could also see that using it as a filling between two cookies would be very delicious too.  I used neuchatel (low-fat cream cheese) cheese and it worked fine.

Fabulous!  But you have to love Pumpkin!  I mixed in some icing sugar and vanilla.  Topped with cool wjip and nutmeg.  Served with gingersnaps and vanilla wafers.  It went over well and I have enjoyed the little bit of leftovers:)

This is very good and very easy.  Tastes just like pumpkin pie.  We all liked with cinnamon graham crackers better than ginger snaps.

Super easy to make.  I hollowed out a small pumpkin and served it in there. My 5 year old daughter asked if she could just eat it with a spoon!  I served it with cinnamon/graham type cookies similar to Teddy Grahams.  It was a huge hit by all my friends and family.  They loved the presentation too.

This had a great taste, but it was too runny. It was almost liquid. I will not make this again, but gave it 3 stars because it is yummy.

I made it last year for the kids and everyone who has tasted this dip when I make it loves it! The adults more than the kids.  I just get the different shaped graham cookies. I just can't seem to make enough.

I didn't think this was quite sweet enough.  I added a touch of Confectioners Sugar to make it a little sweeter.

I brought this to my work Halloween party, and people loved it!  I added some nutmeg in, too.  I've had a couple of people ask me for the recipe, and a few people told me it was their favorite thing there!  I plan on making this for Thanksgiving this year.  YUM!

I made this for a pumpkin-themed food day at work.  I added a bit of powdered sugar to the mix, as I thought it wasn't  quite sweet enough.  Also threw in some pumpkin spice in addition to the cinnamon.  Served with apple slices and graham crackers.  It's very tasty and everyone seems to really like it.

I liked the tangy flavour of this dip. I would make this again. I will use real cream cheese next time...I had used a tofu based cream cheese substitute for someone who wanted it dairy-free.

I have made this for a while now and forgot to rate it.  Husband requested this for a SuperBowl snack so I am back again...  I think this is very good.  The cream cheese keeps it from being sickly sweet.  We dunk graham sticks in this...  really good with the cinnamon sugar topped graham sticks or the honey (plain) variety.

This dip is absolutely wonderful and I have had many people ask me for the recipe. I followed everything to a 'T' and it works out great! The only thing I did different was sprinkle cinnamon on top. I serve it with honey graham crackers. And PS, it makes a good amount!

Don't know if I didn't make this correctly or if the crowd just wasn't into it, but it didn't go over well.

I took this dip to a party and everyone loved it.  They all wanted the recipe.  I can't believe how easy it was to make!  I only used one jar of marshnallow creme.  I added Nutmeg and Coolwhip on top.  I served it with Cinnamon graham crackers.  It was a hit.

I make this all the time and serve with ginger snaps.  I use pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon. It's much easier to mix it in a Kitchen Aid.

Made this as an appetizer for a holiday party, and everyone loved it! I only had one jar of marshmallow creme, so I added some confectioners sugar.

I very much reccommand this recipe it's such a unique treat to go with just ordinary sugar cookies you've just picked up from the bakery...this recipe was a big hit at the Halloween party at work. People wanted the recipe and it's so simple i remembered it off the top of my head. This would work well too at Thankgiving or Christmas. Thanks for sharing!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and brought it to a family function. It did not go over well with my crowd. Most of the complaints were that the pumpkin tasted raw and the flavor was lacking. Maybe you just have to be a pumpkin lover to enjoy this.

I was in charge of bringing dessert/something sweet to our sunday afternoon football gathering, so I chose this & SOOOO glad I did, what a huge hit! It was gone in less than 30 minutes. I bought Philadelphia Whipped Cream cheese since it's already soft & saves on time. I served with Gingersnap cookies and Cinnamon Graham crackers. Someone at the game mentioned trying Philly Cream cheese with brown sugar & cinnamon already mixed in next time & I might just have to try that. I will definitely make this again:)

I have been making this fall and holidays for years...EVERYONE LOVES IT.. its great with fruit and graham crackers to dip in it as well! I call it "pumpkin fluff"  but you can also dip it in the big round rice cakes that the machine in whole foods puffs out! Break those up and serve with this dip and hot cider and it will be a requested item always!!

This recipe  served with gingerbread cake is wonderful. Add a dollop, as you would whipped cream or lemon sauce, and enjoy. My family loved it served this way
