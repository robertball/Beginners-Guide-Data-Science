These turned out pretty good. I went to several Asian markets trying to find mizuna and while they were all familiar with it none of them carry it. They said that it didn't have a long shelf life and there wasn't any demand for it in this area. Two of the places suggested I substitute with a spring mix that had arugula in it and that is what I did. Hindsight I wish I would have used baby spinach leaves. I think they would do really good in this. I don't like the sausages on their own but they worked fine in this. The one suggestion I have is to use 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. One just wasn't enough.
