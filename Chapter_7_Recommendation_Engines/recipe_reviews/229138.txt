I can't believe that I'm saying this, but I really enjoyed this sandwich! Totally unexpected, but great flavor combination. I would make this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I grew up eating these and I adore them!  Mama gave them to me as a young child and I think she first ate them at a bridge party when she was a young woman.    You do have to really enjoy the components of the sandwich.  There is something about the salty olive with the p.b. that just can't be beat!
