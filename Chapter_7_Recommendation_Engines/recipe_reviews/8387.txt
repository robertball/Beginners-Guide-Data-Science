This recipe dates back to the war/depression era, when eggs & dairy were rationed, or, in limited supply. The name of this recipe was plentiful back then. War Cake, Depression cake, Eggless butterless cake, Three hole chocolate cake, Chocolate oil cake, etc. Not once in that time was this recipe ever called, "Welfare cake"  

Re-naming this recipe Welfare cake is degrading to the many families & single mothers who have had to resort to welfare to get by. Being on welfare is embarrassing for a great many people. Having recipes labelled "welfare recipe" only adds to that embarrassment.

I substituted a few ingredients to make this recipe slightly healthier and it turned out great.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white flour, cut the sugar  to 1 cup and used apple sauce instead of the oil.  The cake had a great consistency and wasn't too sweet.

I had a craving for chocolate one night but didn't have any milk on hand since we were due to go get groceries the next day. I found this recipe and tried it. I was pleasantly surprised by the gorgeous moist texture and great chocolately flavour! It was amazing even without icing. I can only imagine how delicious it must be with a scoop of ice cream!

It really does taste like cake from a box(which the kids all love). I added chocolate chips (1/4 cup) to the recipe for the added chocolate kick. I would make this again and let the kids help out. I'm fat gram conscious and this is a good lower fat recipe.

This recipe was very moist and dense but it definitely needed frosting so I added a strawberry glaze. Overall we enjoyed it and I was pleased that it was low fat. I also cut down on the fat content further by using half oil and half apple sauce.

I made this cake last night with my husband and two girls. It was good but not the best I've ever had. We put cool whipped frosting on it (recipe from this site) and it was a nice light topping to this dense cake. I don't think I liked the vinegar in it. I will omit if I make this again.

This cake was fantastic. I loved that I had all the ingredients on hand (except for white vinegar; I substituted cider vinegar). I threw in a handful of chocolate chips (remember to coat in flour before adding in order to keep them from sinking to the bottom...) a pinch of cinnamon and I contemplated adding walnuts - I didn't this time but I will next time for sure. I topped this cake with "Pudding Icing" which just made the whole thing to die for. FanTAStic - and reduced fat to boot!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out just like a cake I would buy from a supermarket (the no-frills type sans frosting). Easy to make & tastes & smells good. I put on some frosting I made from another recipe I got at this website & it was great! Thanks:-)

Considering the ingrediences in this cake I found it to be wonderfully moist dense and of a good chocolate flavor. It is nice to find an old fashion desert that requires ingrediences that are readily available at any time. Great desert for low fat no cholesterol diets. Thanks for sharing.

This cake has a funny 'chemically' taste though it isn't from a box. Not really unpleasant but certainly something I'd prefer not to have in a cake. The cake had a nice crumb and was very moist with wonderful texture and a moderate chocolate taste. It's nice that it's not only cheap but also vegan. It's best when it's fresh out of the oven.

Lush cake. Second best tasting choc cake I have ever eaten. Had to add a tiny bit more liquid to make it a bit easier to mix but other than that this cake is heaven.

We Loved this cake! My daughter says it tastes like a chocolate cake donut. It's very moist but not overly. And it holds together very well. I would say it is a dense cake but we really liked it! I will definitely be making this one again. I made it just like the recipe and it was quick and easy. I did have to bake it 10 mins more to get the toothpick to come out clean. We didn't add any icing although powdered sugar would have been a nice finish. It sorta reminds you of the mayonnaise cakes. Great recipe!

My son has an egg allergy and this is by far one of the best chocolate cakes I have found. We sometimes add some chocolate chips to the batter. Also, I increase the coco to 3/4 cup for a richer chocolate flavor. Lastly, I make these as cupcakes and bake them for about 20 mins.

Pretty darn good I especially liked simplicity of it all. My husband liked it very much more than I because it isn't all that sweet. I had to frost mine...it just wasn't sweet enough for me. I give it 4 stars because it really needs frosting.

I've look for my grandmother's chocolate cake recipe for several years----and here I've found it. Talk about "comfort food"! This cake is even better the "second day." And I've found that it really doesn't need any icing.

This is similar to the cake my mother used to make called Wicky Wacky cake. This is good when you are craving chocolate and is quite inexpensive. I did not frost it. Maybe next time some frosting would be good.

Very nice. I halved it for just me and my husband and followed that exactly. I put it in a 8x8 pan which needed slightly less time than I gave it (30 mins). Just be aware it doesn't rise much. I decided to cut mine in half and make it into basically 1/2 a layer cake with frosting in the middle. Really enjoyed it and didn't miss the egg!

Incredible!!I had to look twice to notice there were no eggs in this recipe. Very moist and bakes beautifully. I would add a little more sugar(1/4 cup)in the batter for sweetness and frosting before serving.

I used 1 teaspoon of salt only 1 cup of sugar and full fat sour cream in place for the oil (still reduced the fat by a lot). i used marshmellow cream as a frosting on top. My sister LOVED it. i liked the fact that it did not have a low fat rubbery texture that many recipes get when you replace the oil with something lower in fat. The texture was that of regular cake. I would make this again but try a different frosting.

This cake is very good; I appreciate it because I find it is hard to nail down a true chocolatey flavor when making chocolate cake from scratch-- but this meets my standard! It is especially good with a chocolate glaze poured on it while still warm and served up with a cup of cold milk... Yummy! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

i found this cake to be surprisingly moist and flavorful. i didn't frost it since we don't like things that are too sweet and it made a great snack. i really liked it's simplicity which makes it easy to reduce for smaller batches.

This was alright. Very moist indeed. Very dark taste. I had no eegs and was craving for chocolate so i gave it a try. I do prefer it a bit less dark. I also added white chocolate chips which was a mistake. They all sank breaking the cake when i tried to get it out. The white chocolate/cake scrapings from the bottom were amazing tho. Might try again when out of egg. With eggs i had way better cakes. I also had to cook it about an hour. The middle hadn't even set a little at 40 minutes.

Like this recipe! Eggless low fat better than a box cake mix by far! Stirred with a metal spoon then poured it into a prepared baking dish it had nice volume without dragging out the electric mixer.

Wonderful moist chocolaty! The first time I made it it was ready to take out of the oven at 30 minutes baking time. The second time I made it I didn't have any oil so I used salted butter. Warning: I should have decreased the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons. Also it was ready to remove from the oven after 30 minutes baking time. I will make this again!

Very very yummy! The flavour was perfect for a chocolate cake. Not too rich but in no way bland. I did expect it to be a little more moist but I don't think that made it any worse. I also glazed it with strawberry jam to give it a little something extra.

Yum! I used applesauce instead of oil and half the vinegar. I doubled the vanilla. I added walnuts. Then put dark chocolate chips on top. After it came out I poked holes in it and added chocolate syrup! I then used the fluffy peanut butter frosting recipe on here BEST CAKE EVER!

Overall this cake wasn't bad. I substituted the oil with applesauce and reduced the sugar to 1 cup like one reviewer suggested. Next time I will add a little more sugar and more cocoa. Definately needs icing of some sort I used fat fee chocolate fudge pudding. For being very low fat it wasn't bad.

This recipe is very simmilar to my Nana's "Crazy cake" recipe which is missing so I was very glad that it works so well. As per family traditoin I usd a homemade buttercream icing. I also used 1 cup of whole wheat flour. It turned out great. Thank you for helping me keep a family tradition alive!

This cake was not very moist. It was very airy and not very chocolatey at all. I even doubled the chocolate. Definately would have to eat frosting or icing with it. I probably will not make this again.:( Sorry!!

This is the best low fat chocolate cake I have ever made!! And no cholesterol too?! This one's a keeper. I made mine a Bundt( 10 min to bake time)and covered it with the Vanilla Glaze recipe.Delicious!!!Great cake for calorie/fat gram counters.

Very disappointed on why someone would name this a welfare cake. But other than the degrading name for a cake it was delicious I might add a egg next time to hold it together a little better but If you have a craving for Chocolate cake this is the recipe and you can switch ingredients.

My husband loved this cake! I used low-fat margarine instead of the vegetable oil. It worked fine! It's amazing how much it tastes so much like a box cake but much more filling! And it's made from scratch!

We made 5 dozen mini cupcakes which baked for 18 minutes and came out great. The kids thought this tasted very fudge-y (which was a good thing). They topped it with a cream cheese frosting.

This is such a simple recipe and tastes great. I've made it with a white boiled frosting but it was better with a chcolate cream cheese frosting. Pretty good!

Not at sweet as I wanted but then again I did eat it a few hours after it finished baking. Supposedly it tastes better the next day? Texture is good flavor is only so-so.

Try adding a cup of strong coffee in place of a cup of water. Really brings out a rich chocolate flavor.
