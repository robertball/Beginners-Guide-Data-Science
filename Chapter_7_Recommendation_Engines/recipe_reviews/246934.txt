This was pretty tasty but I left out the potatoes in the chicken & vegetable mix since there were already potatoes going on the top.  And I used shredded hash browns instead of tater tots.  The spice combo was perfect!

Really good! I'll admit, I made 2 substitutions out of convenience.  I subbed the potatoes with Cream of Potato soup.  I also subbed the chicken gravy with Cream of Mushroom soup.  The spice blend was spot on.

Made mostly as directed, used cream of mushroom instead the gravy and nixed the potatoes and it came out great! Will add this to my meal rotation for sure!

This was a nice spin on tater tot casserole.  Didnâ€™t have frozen mixed vegetables so used frozen peas and carrots and left out the potatoes as other reviewers did. Seasoning was good. Husband really liked it.
