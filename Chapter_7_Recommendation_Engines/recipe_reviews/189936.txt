I loved this recipe.  I roasted everything together (squash, onion, pears, garlic, and fresh ginger) - I then made a roux and added the chicken broth and curry and brought it to a boil and then added the roasted vegetables.  Once it came to a boil I used my immersion blender to puree it and added a litle red pepper.  I did not add the half and half.  It was fantastic.

A combination of flavors so deliciously right it makes me crazy to think I've lived this long without experiencing it before now. Better late than never. Thank you for this beautiful, beautiful soup!

Excellent! This is an adaptable recipe. Along with the squash, I roasted 2 Anjou pears and some parsnips that I needed to use up. Otherwise completed the recipe as written. My family and guests loved it.

Very Very delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used home made stock that had no salt in it, so I increased the salt to 3 tsp.. Also, I had no ripe pears, so I used two medium Cortland apples. After these small changes, the finished product was really good. I did take the liberty of adding some fresh nutmeg, about 1/2 tsp, also ground cinnamon, about a tablespoon. These additions took this 5 star recipe and made it 6 stars. My guests raved about it for days! Thanks for sharing!!

Delish! Believe it or not, my local grocer didn't have any pears in stock today. (He said they are out of season) Anyway, used the canned version and nobody could tell the difference! SO delicious! Even my toddler was a fan!

Awesome recipe. Works with a variety of root vegetables/squashes/etc. We made it into a Butternut Parsnip and Rutabega Soup and got raves.

wow. The reviews for this recipe are spot on. It's even better than it sounds. I did a few things differently by roasting the pear and onion as well...but the concept remained the same. I steamed the butternut for about 10 minutes (cut it in half, scoop out seeds and put it cut side down in a baking dish with 1/4 inch of water). Then pour off the water, peel and cut the squash into 1 inch cubes, add the pears (peeled, cored and quartered) and the onion (chopped) to the baking sheet. Toss with a bit of evoo. Bake about 35-40 minutes or until beginning to caramelize. Continue with the recipe as directed. It's amazing.

Save yourself a lot of time and keep the health benefits - there's no need to peel the pears in this amazing, 5-star restaurant quality soup!  Also - get an immersion blender... $28 on Amazon and makes it so easy.  Double this recipe - freezes well in any container.  Love serving with a dollop of low-fat sour cream.

Excellent soup! The squash took one hour to bake. I used vegetable broth and coconut milk instead of the half and half. I think the coconut flavour suited the ginger and curry flavours very well! I received requests to make this one again!

Loved this soup! So easy to prepare, and delicious! I used canned pears, because that was all I had on hand, and they worked fine. Will be making this one over and over!! Thanks!

This soup was ok... don't put it in your food processor the curry will stain anything white (I learned this the hard way). I don't think the soup was necessarily bad, but it just didn't suit our tastes.

I made this soup this afternoon. It turned out amazing. Peel your squash, poke with holes and bake at 350 for an hour for a much easier time cubing. I roasted another 1/2 hour on foil lined sheets. I doubled the garlic and used vegetable broth and olive oil instead of chicken and butter (vegetarian). I also used two honey crisp apples instead of the pears. I kicked it up a bit with a pinch of cayenne. I can say enough about how awesome this turned out. Making french bread to go with it tonight. The perfect Winter time comfort food.

I read the reviews before making this and everyone said it was amazing...and it didn't disappoint.  Delicious!  I'm vegetarian, so I used 4 c. water and a veggie bouillon cube in place of the chicken broth and didn't have any half 'n' half so I omitted that and it was awesome.  I used a little more fresh ginger and garlic than was listed.  Yum!

Oh yeah, this is delicious! By accident, I used three times more ginger (2 Tbsp instead of 2 tsp) than called for, but it sure didn't hurt this flavourful soup. I'll try it next time with the amount called for and see which I prefer.

This was FANTASTIC! To make it vegan, I substituted vegetable oil for the butter, vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and 1.5 cups of almond milk instead of the cream. amazing! Thankyou so much for this incredible recipe!

This was so simple and delicious!  I had bought a butternut squash, never having cooked one before, to give me inspiration.  Next day, a friend called and said she had a sack full ofpears that she would never use and would I want them? Bingo - Hubby was a bit skeptical thnking it would taste bland, but really good flavor.  I took the advice of others and roasted the squash, made it easier and tastier (smpled the roasted squash as I was scooping it out!)I did not have any heavy whipping cream, but had a half block of cream cheese. Read a couple other recipes and found one that used cream cheese for thickening, so I addede that. NIce creaminess, color.I served this with  the Real N'Awlans Muffaletta on this site.  Soup and Sandwich and darn good!

This soup was amazing.  I chose this soup because it sounded like a pretty crazy combination of flavors.  I thought it might be over the top, but it exceeded my expectations.  My only change to this soup was that I substituted full fat unsweetened organic coconut milk in the place of the half and half.  Fantastic and I can't wait to make it again!

This recipe is excellent!!! I'm following Dr. Jergens Clean program so I had to make only 2 modifications.  I switched out the butter for coconut oil and I switched out the cream for coconut milk.  This soup really blew me away. Its soooo good and super easy.  Perfect for my to-go lunches.  I highly suggest this recipe.

This is fantastic....but then again, it has some of my favorite foods in it!   I thought it would be a little time consuming, due to the blending, but it really wasn't bad.  I enjoy kitchen time, anyway!

Curried Butternut Squash with Basil and Baked Apple (Variation): I used a pint of pears I canned this summer, a sprinkle of ground cloves and used heavy cream instead of the half and half (I didn't have any). The soup was yummy, but didn't say WOW! ... until I garnished each bowl with fresh basil leaves and *baked apples. It added that extra eye appeal and gourmet taste I was looking for. 

*To make by "baked apples" I peeled and chopped up apple chunks and simmered them in a little water (covered). After they were soft, I added brown sugar and cinnamon to taste. It's basically a quick homemade version of applesauce. I don't mash is up because the apple chunks added great texture to the soup.

I love the results this recipe produces. I also love that it is a very flexible base from which to create variations. Personally, I prefer a very flavorful combination of butternut squash, Granny Smith apples, onions, and garlic. But I've also been quite happy with butternut squash and pumpkin. And I'm just as happy using olive oil and no cream as when using butter plus cream. Simply put, you can do just about anything you want with this recipe. Use squash and parsnips, squash and carrots, extra curry powder and cinnamon rather than the ginger, etc. Use this recipe as a starting base and use whatever ingredients you have in your fridge and whatever seasonings appeal to you at the moment.

Very good...did not change a thing.  Made it for a Thanksgiving '11 starter.  I made it the day before and before serving rewarmed and added cream then.  I prefered it with the cream.  Could really not have been any easier...but, is like a soup you would get at a high end restaurant.

Wonderful and quick. I used pre cubed squash from the store to save time. I also did not have pears or apples on hand so I stirred in some cinnamon applesauce to taste. I did not have onions, either (can you tell I hate the grocery store?), so I used shallots. I left out the half and half to save calories. This incredible soup was still creamy and delicious!

WOW! This is amazing! The only change I made was to reduce the chicken broth to 3.5 cups because I like a bit thicker soup. Otherwise, I made this exactly as the recipe states and this is now a permanent recipe in my box!

This soup turned out wonderful and flavorful.  Perfect amount of spice to it.  I think the longest part is waiting for the butternut squash to cook, other than that the soup is made in no time.  This is a very thick and hardy soup perfect for autumn weather.

Outstanding! I added 3 pears instead. Can't really taste them, but I'm sure it adds to the overall flavor. Funny note...the family devoured the entire pot that night. The next morning I opened the fridge and realized I forgot to add the half and half! So take that how you'd like it. It tastes outstanding without the half and half, and, I'm sure MUCH healthier.

10.20.16  Didn’t frizzle any onions,  but I wouldn’t change a thing in this recipe.  What the curry powder and pear bring to this soup is almost beyond words. I had part of a butternut squash already cut up, so I just cubed the rest, drizzled a little olive oil over it, and baked for about 30 minutes in the 350°F oven. Don’t even bother looking at another recipe for butternut squash soup because this one's the Superstar (and I’m tried a number of recipes, too). So glad I’ve found this recipe, only wish I’d found it sooner!  ******5.14.18  UPDATE:  This has become my favorite soup ever, seriously belongs in the “Hall of Fame.”  I’ve made it so many times that I’ve lost count, and rarely, will you find my freezer without a container of it.  I let my pears get REALLY ripe (scary ripe I suppose) until they’re super sweet.  I don’t even peel them anymore, just core, chop, and into the pot.  Don’t think I’ve ever served to anybody who has not asked for the recipe.  It’s savory, sweet, and has just enough of a hint of curry powder (I use Madras) that you know it’s a really different butternut squash soup.  Can’t say enough good things about this recipe

Has some good bones.  I found the curry a little over-powering, and probably should have let my pears ripen a little more.  As other people have said, you'll need to let your squash cook closer to an hour.  Definately a keeper.

An excellent soup.  I changed a few things because of necessity not choice.  I used a 3.5 lb squash.  I didn't have any garlic on hand.  I broke my blender jar so I couldn't blend this so I used a potato masher to mash up the pear which I cubed up about a half inch in size.  This gave me a soup that was a bit lumpy and quite wonderful as I loved the texture and it brought out the pear and onion flavor better because it wasn't all creamed together.  Two thumbs up!!

Delicious, even though I changed it a bit (no pears, so I used homemade unsweetened apple sauce, and I doubled the ginger and curry because I like those spices!) A unique combination of flavors, also keeps well in the fridge and is just as good reheated. Will make again!

FANTASTIC.  I am dairy-free, so used goat's butter in place of the butter, and coconut milk in place of the half and half.  I also used 1 teaspoon of dry ginger in place of the ringer root.

made a few changes for time/ease - used prepackaged diced steamable squash - cooked for a bit in the microwave then threw it in - used canned pears - put in just enough to heat through since they were already soft - added a touch of cinnamon.  was very happy with it - will maybe try it fresh next time instead of canned - just didn't want to go through all that extra work if I wasn't going to like it.  Hubby doesn't care for curry, but he was able to eat it - I loved how the curry cut the sweetness - didn't really notice the pear, but again, used canned and might have been overpowered by more squash than called for.  Overall, a good soup I'll make again.

Love this recipe - I spiced it up a bit using extra curry and garam masala - didn't feel like getting out the blender so just used my portable hand mixer to mix.  Definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  Made it exactly as written.


Update: For what it's worth, I made it again today, with a few substitutions since I'm trying to clean out the freezer and pantry.  Used homemade pumpkin puree in the place of the squash and used 3/4 cup applesauce in place of the pears.  It was good, but not the amazing, delicious soup it was when I followed the recipe exactly.

My sister and I loved this recipe! I used acorn squash instead and only 3 1/2 cups chicken broth (2 cans worth).  Also, I had coconut milk on hand from another curry recipe, so I used about 1/4 cup of that instead of the half and half.  Delicious!

This is so good as is, although the curry powder can be a little bit overpowering. It's also really important to roast the squash skin side up so that that's the side that burns a little and not the inside part.

Very good, but not great...

My soup turned out a little thicker than I'd like, but super creamy and SO yummy. The pear gives it that weird pear-y, granule-y texture which is a little weird for a creamy soup. But, as I said, it's so delicious, and a hearty, but lighter meal for a cold night. Takes a long time to make! Also, the squash did take longer to roast soft enough to scoop.

This was AMAZING.  I love using my food processor to mince ginger and garlic.  I just about always cook in larger quantities than the recipe suggests - I used three decently sized squash and four pears, doubled all other ingredients.  Will absolutely make again.

This was incredible! My family joined another family for Thanksgiving one year and instead of the traditional Turkey and fixings, we went Indian. This was the appetizer and I got many compliments. The pear flavor was subtle but made a very nice balance with the squash - I think I used an acorn squash because that's what the store had! Anyway, very, very good!

OMG this soup is to die for! Smooth, delicious, and very pretty. Based on other reviews, I doubled the onions, garlic, and ginger. I used apples as I didn't have any pears, and I left out the half and half because I didn't think the soup needed it after it was blended. When it was blended, I seasoned with salt and pepper and served with a dollop of sour cream and chopped cilantro. Thanks for an easy recipe that I will be making again and again.
Update: I made this soup again this evening, this time with pears. Inspired by a recipe I saw on TV, I added a cup of cooked shrimp during the last couple of minutes of the cooking time, before blending. It added a lovely, subtly sweet dimension to the already beautiful flavour of this soup.

What an unbelievable soup. I added a half ts of cinammon, some extra ginger and curry powder and lots of fresh ground pink pepper. I don't own a blender, so I mashed mine with a potato masher. The Bartlett pears are so soft (as is the caramelized squash) that the soup was essentially chunkless and textured as a  thick puree. I used equal parts milk and half & half. I served with a dollop of sour cream and some cilantro on top. Oh my!

Great recipe. I improvised as follows: used butternut squash, plus and acorn squash and a yam. I also added ground black pepper and a dash of cayenne to the recommended mix of fresh ginger and garlic. And instead of pears, I used a wedge of honeydew melon (because it was what I had on hand)- terrific. Rather than adding half-and-half to the puree, I put a dollop of sour cream on top before serving and smattered that with cinnamon toasted squash seeds that I'd reserved from the acorn and butternut squash (rather than throwing them out, toss with a tablespoon or two of sesame or olive oil, some sea salt, and a little cinnamon and/or maple syrup to taste and put in a 275 degree oven until toasty- easy!). The results were delish! Will definitely make again.

P.S. If you have an immersion blender, is so much easier than transfering the soup to a blender. Hooray for the Cuisnart Smart Stick!

Fantastic! I was in a hurry so I cut the squash, wrapped in plastic & microwaved both halves together for ten minutes, checked for doneness, scooped out seeds & put right into the recipe. Absolutely delicious!  Added a little nutmeg for added ooomph. Definitely make again!

This soup is delicious! The squash, pear, and curry flavors go well together.  I used plain yogurt instead of half and half and the soup was nice and creamy that way, but with fewer calories. Hold the lid of the blender tightly when you blend the soup - the hot soup can really blast the lid off!

Excellent. Used 16 oz two bags of frozen, pre-cooked butternut squash, and it worked perfectly. Served with the Curried Cashew, Pear and Grape recipe from Allrecipes.

love this recipe.  I've made this recipe about 10 times now.  Once I didn't have pears so i used apples instead and it tasted just as great!  in fact it didn't have that gritty texture that the pears have.  this recipe is so creamy and rich it's my go to comfort food in the winter.

The depth of flavor in this soup is insane!! I felt like I tasted something new with every bite. My only changes to accommodate what I had on hand... 1tsp dried ginger instead of fresh, used half chicken broth half beef broth, replaced one pear with an apple, pinch of cayenne. THANK YOU FOR THIS RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME RECIPE!!!

I followed the directions as written with the exception of adding skim milk instead of half & half.  It was good, but I will continue to look elsewhere for that "over-the-top" butternut squash soup recipe.

Sooo yummy!!  I did a couple of things different.  I added 2 grated carrots, and 1 sm apple to the onions, garlic and spices for saute.  (I sauted the pears and apple at the same time as everything else.)  I added Red curry paste (about 1 tablespoon) in addition to the curry powder and about 2 teaspoons fresh chopped cilantro.  Before puree, I boiled and added 2 potatoes. After puree, I added one can coconut milk and about 1/4 cup of half and half and returned to stove to complete simmer. Yumm!!!!

Wonderful!  This soup has terrific flavor.  You could even leave off the half and half and still have a delicious soup.  I used 2 Tbsp of butter rather than 3.  Everyone loved it, and my grown son asked for the recipe.

I've been making the same boring butternut squash soup for 3 years now and wanted to change it up. After reading the recipe and the reviews i thought the combination of flavours sounded exciting so I gave it a try. I followed the ingredients and instructions exactly minus the 1/2 cup of half and half, instead used 1/2 cup of coconut milk. It turned out ammmmaaaazing!!! My husband absolutely loved it! Said it was the best soup I have ever made! Today I made it again for the 2nd time this week and this time I added some shrimp. Soooo Yummy!

Delicious soup! I would agree with other reviewers to use coconut milk instead of half and half. The sweetness of the coconut adds more dimension to the flavors.

It was my first attempt to make butternut squash soup so I followed the recipe exactly. I loved the added flavor of the curry and ginger. I don't know if it was the squash or the pears... but it was a bit too sweet for me. Still, the pot is completely gone. I might try it again with one instead of 2 pears.

Great even without the pear. Try to use shallots as they add a wonderful flavor.

This was awesome, but I changed it.  Left out the half and half and used a can of coconut milk; left out the pears.  Creamy and healthy.

I tried this recipe on the weekend and it was fantastic. I took another reviewer's suggestion and used coconut milk instead of the half and half. I chose to use a couple of carrots instead of the pears and it turned out lovely. I'm going to get pears next time - I think their sweetness will be amazing with the curry and squash. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!

I really enjoyed this soup.  I omitted the salt and the cream to keep it healthier and used apples as that's what I had in the fridge.  I also cubed the squash and baked it so that it was ready more quickly.  This was delicious!  I added a tsp of hot curry paste while the soup was simmering for an extra kick.  Awesome - I'll be making this again soon.

This soup was a hit as a starter for Thanksgiving!  Tastes great just the way it was.  Cream is optional since it's so thick on it's own without it.

Wow!  This is great!  I've only used powdered ginger and last time I had to use pear sauce and one apple and it was still fabulous.  Also, the 2nd time I made it, I used frozen squash leftover from the 1st time I made it.  Great (and EASY).  I also lowered the butter.  I've frozen this soup and that works great too!  I used an immersion blender.

Delicious and a very interesting blend of flavours, loved it! So easy to make--I couldn't be bothered to get a pan dirty to bake the squash first so I just peeled it, and then sauted the squash with the onions to give it a nice caramelized flavour.

Amazing!!! It is a savory soup, for those of you wondering. When I roasted the butternut squash, I tossed it with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt. Also, the recipe really doesn't need the half and half. Just FYI. I am going to make this all the time!

Wow! This soup is the perfect blend of sweet and spciy. It's filling as a dinner, but light enough to be an appetizer and its flavor is sophisticated but somehow, it would also make a great comfort food. I only made on change - adding a little extra curry powder because I like spicy food. I will be making this many more times!

Soup was good and even better the next day.  Not the type of soup I would typically make but would make again.  i was branching out and trying somethng different.  Like other reviews, didn't taste the pears and I added extra since I used the canned variety.  I can see this as a great starter for a dinner party.  Although I need to learn to make that fancy design on the top just before serving.

Wow, can't agree more with other great reviews.  I was excited to make this soup but wasn't expecting it to be this good!  I had a very large butternut squash so in addition to the two pears I also added a diced Granny Smith (to the sautee) to offset the sweetness.  To keep the texture from ending up like baby food, I only blend two or so batches in my blender on high.  The rest I lightly pureed with my stick blender on low.  That gave it a smooth creamy base along with some small bits of squash/fruit.  I wouldn't rule out blending in the blender completely.  The squash has a stringy consistency on its own.  I only added a splash of half & half and it was just right for me.  My boyfriend and I taste tested two samples with added 1/2 tsp of spice; one with cinnamon and the other with pumpkin pie spice.  We preferred the cinnamon.  The result - a wonderfully flavorful soup with a touch of sweetness and cream.  Not too heavy but it will fill you up!

I LOVED this soup.  The flavors of pear, squash and curry are just amazing together.  I used VERY ripe pears that were borderline rotten, and no ginger since I forgot it at the store, and it will STILL DELICIOUS!  I also used heavy cream instead of half/half because that's what was in my fridge.  AMAZING!

I have never gotten such rave reviews for soup as I did with this recipe. Everyone loved it, including those who typically aren't fans of butternut squash. The pear lends just enough sweetness, and the ginger really comes through as well. My only change was to cut back a bit on the onion. Perhaps I just had a large onion, but I felt the whole thing would have been overpowering. I used 1/2-3/4 of the onion.

I too roasted all of my veggies together. Only I had no pears and so used the only fruit in the house...granny smith apples. I halved all of the veggies and fruit (except the garlic) then brushed the open sides with olive oil. Roasted as suggested, then simmered them for a while in the broth, to soften them, before I blended. This was so good although, not very filling by itself. I'll have to find some more delicious Indian recipes to go along with it.

This soup rivals any soup in a high end restaurant. I followed the recipe exactly except I did not add the half and half. It was so rich and creamy without the added fat of the cream. I did add about an axtra cup of chicken broth to thin the soup. My husband stated that I could have thinned it a little more. This is definitely going to be made again. Wonder how well it would freeze?

Loved this. Perfect blending of flavours. I pureed mine with an immersion blender and I also used powdered ginger as I was out of fresh. I will definitly make this again.

This was a dish that I made because I thought it sounded great.  My boyfriend was not too sure about it.  Turns out we both loved it.  If I hadn't known what the ingredients were in the dish, I am not certain I could have told you what they were.  This soup makes great leftovers (I took it to work a couple of times.)

While I followed the recipe, this soup could be made without the addition of the half & half.

I haven't reviewed a recipe for a long time and I just had to comment on this recipe. It's fantastic, and tastes as good as any fancy soup I've had in a restaurant! I substituted a medium-sized sweet potato for the pears (didn't have any on hand) and used a hot curry powder. I also omitted the half & half, although I'm sure that would make it even better. It made enough to fill four cereal bowls. I'm emailing this one to my mom!

Great recipe! Loved the flavor. Didn't have butternut squash but I had butterCUP squash and I couldn't tell the difference. 
I added chopped bacon and croutons before serving.

I coated the squash with a little bit of salt and vegetable oil before roasting.  I let squash roast for 1 hour.  Although I halved the recipe, I used 2 garlic cloves and two ripe Bartlett pears.  The half and half is not necessary.

Great soup - loved the taste and texture.  Made the recipe exactly as written, except that I used vegetarian broth in place of chicken broth.  Can't wait to make this again!

I really liked this.  It was not difficult to make.  I used ground ginger because the supermarket had no fresh ginger.  It was spicier than I thought it was going to be, but definitely a keeper.  I will definitely make again.

This was a very nice soup.  I did not roast squash but microwaved.  Also was out of fresh ginger and used 1 tsp of powder.  Plenty for 6 small bowls.  I added just a pinch of white pepper and another of cayenne pepper to give it just a bit of a zip.

Love this soup!  So good on a cool fall day.  I doubled the curry, garlic, and ginger for some extra punch.  Served with cilantro and a big thick slice of garlic bread.

Delicious! Made this in a hurry so par-cooked the squash in the microwave before roasting. Didn't have curry powder so used a mild curry paste. Forgot to add the 1/2 n 1/2 but it was so creamy and good it didn't matter. Thank you we will definitely have this again soon and yes I will try and remember the cream :)

This is a very wonderful warming recipe, and it will become a staple in this house! Be aware that curry powder can vary very differently, and that yours might be spicier than other reviewers! I took the advice of doubling the spices and wished I hadn't, the process of cooking the spices in the oil "blooms" them and would have brought more than enough flavor to the dish without the overpowering spiciness that I ended up with. I did not add the half and half for health reasons, and it was delicious without it. I added the juice (not syrup) from the can of pears that I had to use instead, and I think that it would have been better with a can of vegetable broth like another reviewer suggested, as it ended up being slightly too sweet. I tasted the soup before adding it though, and the flavor was just wonderfully balanced!

Made this using left over steamed butternut squash from Thanksgiving.  I did make some minor changes.  I used Better Than Bullion chicken stock (and left out the 1 tsp salt), as I had no reduced sodium chicken broth.  I also skipped the 1/2 cup 1/2 and 1/2 and garnish each serving with a tsp of light sour cream.  This got tons of raves.  The kids had seconds and people were fighting over the leftovers!

Sooooo yummy! I used Pam on my baking sheet because I didn't have any parchment paper and the squash didn't stick. Also, I used the Chicken Stock recipe from this site.

I love the concept of butternut squash combined with onion, garlic and I used three pears!  I did cut back on the amount of curry one teaspoon is more than enough and added a dash of nutmeg, cinnamon and cayenne pepper.  Pots on the stovetop as I type this review and I know I’ll love it more to come!!! I also used my stick blender to  purée right in the soup pot make clean up much easier!

I made a vegan version the second time around, using olive oil instead of butter, coconut milk and vegetable broth instead of milk and chicken broth. Delicious either way. Also good with one apple and one pear. I roasted the onion, apple and pear with the squash. Yum!

This is a very delicious soup. I will be making it again. Thanks for the recipe.  I substituted 4 cups of water with two veggie broth bouillon cubs in place of the chicken broth.  Also the 30 minutes of cooking is not necessary. while you are sautéing the onions garlic and spice cook the pears with about 1/3 cup water on a low simmer for 5 minutes or until soft.  Then add them to the pot.  Next add the broth and squash.  You can use a hand blender or pour it all in a glass blender and blend before you heat it all up. You do not need to cook just let it get to the desired temp and serve.  the less you cook the soup the more nutritious and colorful it is.  Also you can skip the half and half.  It is just as good if not better without.  Taste it before you add it and you'll see.

This was excellent. I took a previous review and roasted everything together for about 45min, then sautéed in olive oil and added curry, salt, and vegetable broth verses chicken.  I didn't use any half and half because I didn't want any dairy components. I will definitely make this again and again.

Wonderful recipe I have made again and again.  I omit the half and half but serve the soup with a small dollop of sour cream.  I have made this with and without pears and both are equally good.  I've also previously used apples instead of pears.  This always gets rave reviews in my house.

This soup was fine.  My family ate it, but we had lots left over and nobody was enthusiastic about it.  I won't make it again because there are some other really fantastic butternut squash soup recipes on this site.

Yum! To make it easier, use frozen cubed butternut squash and a stick blender in the pot.  Also I didn't peel the pears so I didn't lose the nutrients and fiber in the skins.

I love the taste of this but not the consistancy.  I expected it to be creamier.  I did in fact make some changes but only because of time limits.  I put all ingredients in the crock pot on low for 5 hours.  I then blended and put back in the crockpot and added half and half.  In my opinion I was hoping it would have been creamier.  Next time I think I will make it the same way but cut down on the chicken broth.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. I roast the squash whole on foil directly on the oven rack. Turn over half way during cooking. Remove from oven. Let squash cool some, cut off top then slice lengthwise and scoop out the seeds.
Made this with half curry powder and half gram masala. Used 1T. each
ginger and garlic, minced. Also coconut milk instead of half and half. This is one to put on the rotation. YUM! Thanks..... blancdeblanc for posting.

I love this soup. Be ready for it to stink up your house. The curry smell lingers. Also, if you are living Paleo or Whole 30 it fits with the diet if you skip the half and half (you could sub coconut milk but it's not needed) and replace the butter with ghee or olive oil.

Very tasty!!! I didn't add the half and half as the flavor was so rich already and I tend to be dairy sensitive. Next time I will experiment with almond and coconut milk.

I give it a 5 but the family friendly factor is a 4. Kiddos didn't go for this unique flavor. I loved the richness down to the last drop and even considered licking the bowl clean of its creamy coating! Yumtastic!

I've made this before and liked it fine but decided it needed more. So this time I accidentally used 4 Tbsp butter and added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, some coriander - maybe 1/2 tsp, 1/4 tsp pepper, a couple of small pinches of red pepper flakes, 2 cloves of garlic - because I like garlic, 1 pear, and some milk maybe 1 to 1-1/2 cups until it wasn't too thick anymore.  Perfect.

I have made this twice and have figured it out what works best for me re: taste. Here are the additions/changes that I made. 1. Omitted pears and used two small apples instead 2. Added a handful of baby carrots 3. Added cinnamon and nutmeg 4. Reduced chicken broth to 3 cups. RE: baking squash, I just put the entire squash in the oven at 400 and baked for just over an hour (make sure you jab it with a fork/knife so that it doesn't burst in the oven). Once the squash it cooked, it's so much easier to cut it and peel it!

For years, I have been trying to find the perfect butternut squash soup recipe and this might be it. My husband and I both loved it, and it was so easy. The ginger, curry, and pear make it amazing.  I pretty much followed the recipe, but used milk because I didn't have half and half, and one large very ripe yellow pear was all I had- and it was plenty. I used my immersion blender, which is easier, safer, and neater. Will definitely make this one again.

This soup is amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly.  My stock was leftover turkey stock so there were some pieces of turkey in there too that got blended in with the rest.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Made this for a dinner party, blind dining, guests loved the flavour and all raved about the soup.  Tasted the soup prior to adding the 1/2 and 1/2 and really it is just as good without it.

first, get a stick blender and just blend in the pan.  I made this recipe twice now, once with pears, once without.  I like it both ways.  Has a really nice combination of flavors. I was afraid on the 2nd time because I used regular (salted butter) and chicken base (again salted) and still put in the tsp of salt.  I was afraid it was going to be too salty, but it was fine.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

Yellow summer squash is great, too.  I substituted by accident since I did not notice I had the wrong kind until after I had all the other ingredients together.  It was great even with summer squash instead  of butternut.  Curry is the secret ingredient.  Love it love it!

Oh my goodness gracious, this was delicious. i made a couple of changes:
1.- i used evaporated milk instead of half and half.
2.- Instead of roasting everything, i steamed it. It was much quicker and simpler.
3.- i added two jalapenos!!! It was the perfect balance of spicy, curry, sweet, and creamy.

Delicious as is!  Only deviation was to used pre-cut squash, since the store did not have any whole, but I stuck that in the oven for recommended time and turned out great.  Flavors work really well together; could use with 1/2 and 1/2 or without.

My family LOVED this soup!!  I made it last week and they ate it up! First thing they did when I told them the name was to wrinkle their noses at me.  After they ate the whole pot, they wanted to know when  I would be making it again.  I am making it tonight!

Delicious.  I added a little more spice than the recipe calls for, and I'll probably add even more next time.   I also used a hand blender right in the pot of soup instead of transferring it to the blender.

Yum.  The first time I tasted butternut squash soup was at a 5 star hotel.  I wanted to find a recipe was as good.  This recipe does it.    I made it vegetarian by using vegetable stock instead of chicken broth.

A delicious soup for those cooler days.  Did not have the ginger root, so I used a half teaspoon of ginger.

Amazing recipe! I served this at a dinner party and everyone loved it. Instead of curry powder, though, I used one cube of S&B Golden Curry Sauce mix (Medium) and gave it a delicious flavor. Also added cubed potatoes and carrots since I like a little chunkiness to my soup.  Can't wait to make this again.

Roasted the squash, onion, and garlic together for about an hour.  Used canned pears and sauteed them with the butter (used significantly less) and spices.  Added the chicken broth and a small dash of apple cider vinegar.  Finished with just a few tablespoons of milk.  Totally tasty, easy, and healthy.

I loved this soup! I made the broth from last night's chicken dinner and used apples instead of pears (that is what I had on hand). The flavour of the soup was delicious, but I think I had more than 4 cups of broth so to add a bit of richness I mixed in 1/4 pkg of melted cream cheese. It's sitting in the crock pot right now and the aroma is throughout the whole house! I will definately make this again!

I roasted the pears, squash, and onions together and used nonfat milk. I seasoned it directly as written and I thought it was just the right level of heat but I tend to like things on the spicier side. Delicious garnished with cilantro and plain yogurt. I was glad to find a recipe that didn't call for coconut milk or sour cream.

Yum! I wish the flavour had more punch than it did have. I used a Granny Smith apple instead of the two pears and pumpkin instead of the butternut squash. And I used yoghurt instead of half and half. The added yoghurt gave it a sour taste, which I thought was nice!

Really amazing soup.  Followed the directions exactly except I substitued D'Anjou Pears (it's what I had on hand), and I used a stick blender to save time.  Also topped with croutons which tasted great in this soup.  Will definitely make this again!

My company LOVED this!  I used a stick blender in the pot -- lots easier than transferring in and out of the blender -- but it didn't cool enough and when I added the 1/2&1/2 it curdled slightly.  That's just an FYI.  I knew better, but was in too much of a hurry to take a little soup out and blend it with the cream and then add it back to the pot.  But boy was it delicious!  I'm emailing it off to almost every person that was at my house for dinner last night!  Thanks!!

This was definitely a good soup and will probably make it again. I did as one reviewer suggested and added a half teaspoon of brown sugar and a pinch of nutmet and cinnnamon. I am not sure that this added anything more to the recipe, but nonetheless, this turned out to be a good soup.

Absolutely wonderful. I was a little skeptical about the pears, but it turned out very delish esp with the rainy cold weather we're having. I did tweak the recipe a bit. instead of baking which takes long, i boiled the squash. Cut the time in half drastically. i just added to the boil, all the ingredients one by one. i did not have half & half, but used soymilk which was healthier. i pureed everything, and it was very yummy and full of flavor. my husband raved! Thank you!!

This is very good.  The curry and pear blend nicely and I will make this occasionally.  However, I prefer the "Butternut and Apple Harvest Soup" recipe.

We followed the recipe and LOVED it.  To make it into a full meal, we used the a shallow layer of this soup under blackened (and bacon wrapped) scallops.  Then, for toppings, we offered pumpkin seeds, sage, croutons, and a slice of lime.  Truly remarkable meal.

I made this for my parents who had never had a butternut squash soup, and they loved it. The only changes I made were substituting the half and half with plain yogurt and adding more curry powder and some nutmeg.

I loved it, my boyfriend loved it, and I'm making it again for sure! I used homemade vegetable stock in place of chicken broth, and I used unsweetened almond milk in place of the half-and-half , but it still turned out very flavorful, rich, and super creamy. The spices and flavour profile are on point - thanks for the great recipe :)

Although I had to make substitutions (pumpkin instead of squash), plain yogurt instead of cream) , this was the kind of soup I was after. Hearty,  creamy,  and with refreshing ideas for ingredients and combinations . It opens up another healthy way to eat more plant based foods. The best part is my husband loved it!

Really loved the flavors in this.  I used frozen cubed butternut squash that I roasted for a bit in the oven for 30 min at 350 degrees.  I added 1/2 tsp of cloves. I left on the pear skins.  We will definately make this again.

Love this! Double the curry powder and add blue cheese crumbles on top and amazing.  Freezes well too.  I use immersion blender and much less hazardous than the blender.

Holy *bleep* this soup is amazing. If you like curry and squash, you will like this and must make it immediately. Slight alterations - I added garam masala along with the curry powder (don't skip the garam masala, those flavors go perfectly with squash and pear) and I used a can of coconut milk rather than  half and half to make it more like curry. I also got a little creative and cubed up a slice of naan and fried it in some butter to make croutnaans. Do it. Do it all. Now.

This is the best, crowd pleasing, easy to make, soup. we make this over and over again. I just use 1tsp dried ground ginger instead of fresh, it's way easier. Sometimes I'll add an extra pear or two in there as I live the sweet taste it adds. I'm more sensitive than most to spicy stuff so I cut way down on the curry powder and add like 2 tbsp of paprika. I've used 5% cream when I don't have half and half and it's just the same. It's also way easier to just use an immersion blender and just blend it up in the pot.

First, I made three times the recipe because our limited pear harvest was only 9 pears. Second, I added a tad of cayenne and some mace. Third, I cooked Half the recipe with half and half and the other half of the recipe with coconut milk. And lastly, it was great. Thank you.

Oh yummy, I used soy creamer instead of half and half and it was very good.  Perfect time of the year since all the squashes are starting to come in, fresh butternut and crisp pears, great combination,

Made it exactly as stated & it was wonderful. The second time I made it I added wild rice as my hubby likes rice in soup. I added few dots of sour cream and red chile paste for color and some sunflower seeds for crunch. Delicious!!

Iv'e made this recipe twice, once with pears and once with apples. As is, it's a 4 star, with apples it's a 5 star recipe! I think the apples provide the perfect amount of tartness and flavour that pears are lacking.

Absolutely delectable!  Definitely keep the curry powder in the recipe as this really makes it!  Made this for Christmas dinner and it got raves.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I was trying to use up the fresh pears around my house, so I put in 4 pears instead of just 2.  I also put in a full stick of butter to make the soup more creamy with the additional fruit and about 1 extra cup of whole milk in addition to the cream.  If you have an immersion blender, use that to puree the soup to save on mess and get it extra smooth.   Added lots of ground black pepper to taste and served topped with savory croutons.  SO DELICIOUS!!

THis is by far one of the best soups ever. I make it about a dozen times every fall. I now use coconut oil to sauté for the extra flavour and a ton of ginger, probably a quarter cup of it. I use 1 1/2 times the recipe for the average supermarket squash.

Made with one apple instead of pears and use olive oil (,instead of the butter) for sauteing the onions. Omitted the 1/2 and 1/2. Used 8 cups of low salt chicken stock. Excellent and very healthy.

Love this soup. 
I omitted the cream. 
Instead of onion I used one leek. 
instead of 2 pears I used 3. 
I would like to know the nutritional values here and I don't know or can't see the link.  Anyone?

delicious.  easy to prepare. the key is the roasting of the squash.  I also roasted the onion and garlic.  I only added a tad more curry powder out of personal preference, some black pepper, and a bit of cilantro.  didn't use the heavy cream; only used a bit of fat free half & half.  Love this topped with a dollop of greek yogurt.  Very comforting.  I think next time I will leave some chunks of pear; otherwise the flavor of the pear gets a bit lost in the soup.  thanks for this super easy recipe.

Followed the recipe per directions. My son and I really enjoyed it and I will make again for us. My husband (not surprising) didn't love it. He prefers savoury to sweet and there is definitely a high sweet content. I made in large pot and used immersion blender. Served with crouton recipe (from here) and it was a great compliment.

This was good, but not as flavorful as I had hoped.  Before adding the half and half and serving I added more of all of the seasonings called for, some ground nutmeg and a shot of sherry.  That seemed to help.

Great taste and consistency.  I didn't have half and half so substituted coconut milk and doubled the curry to my taste.  Hubby loved it and told me I could make this anytime.  What a great soup of for a chilly fall day.

By far one of my favourite recipes, I always come back to it in the fall when squash is in season! Don't skip the step of roasting the squash, I tried that once and it wasn't as flavourful.

Amazing. If you don't like spicy dishes all that much, which I don't usually, then only use 1/2 tablespoon of curry so it doesn't compete with the rest of the flavors. This is the best butternut soup I've tasted!

We needed to do something with the extra butternut squash from Thanksgiving, and this recipe turned out to be ideal.  The only change was in not adding the cream.  It still came out extremely tasty.  We will definitely be making this again.

Tip to self:  The "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" recipe on this site made into muffins are a great accompaniment to this soup.

Made the soup with just a few changes to the original recipe. I added some cinnamon, nutmeg and honey. The taste is delightful and my family loved it!

This is my go to recipe for Butternut Squash soup. Instead of half and half I use canned full fat coconut milk. Sometimes extra curry. Everything else just like the recipe. Wonderful.

Love this recipe! Best one I have tried. We used our Asian pears because we had a bumper crop this year. Wouldn't change a thing. It is good with or without the half and half for those who want to eliminate a few calories.

I followed the recipe close to the given.    I really like curry, but found the specified amount a little too much.  Did not add the cream, but still found it very smooth.  Saved some for my 8 month old grandson,  before adding the spices.  He loved it!

I used frozen, cubed butternut squash. After roasting the squash with a little oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder, I followed this recipe. I didn't have pears so I used some applesauce which worked well.
This was bar far the best butternut squash soup I've made.

Such yummy squash soup! I forgot to add curry powder, added only 2 cups broth & had no pear, but it was still tasty. To speed up the process, I steamed the squash with a steaming basket in a pot with a lid above boiling water  on top of the stove... which probably takes 1/2 the cooking time.  I also used Coconut Oil to saute the veggies which worked out well... &  replaced the 1/2 & 1/2 with Coconut Milk which was delish. I'll be making this recipe again... & I'm anxious to try it with the curry powder this time.

One of my favorite soups. I don't bother with half and half and instead of baking squash, I put it in microvave for appx. 16-17 minutes.

Wonderful!  Made this with only one alteration - I roasted all of the ingredients except the ginger (because I forgot) along with the butternut squash (henceforth to be known as BS).  It was so flavorful and delicious even my husband, who HATES BS, said it was great and I should make it again.  I love BS soup and think this was probably the best that I have ever had.   Will be adding this to the rotation of winter soups.

This is my go-to soup recipe, we absolutely love it at my house! It's especially good if you have a decent curry powder with a little bit of kick to it. Depending on how big the squash is (and your texture preference), the given liquid may be a bit too much (but if it's  big squash, it's perfect). For reference, I like my soup to be thick and velvety.

One of the very best soup recipes I have ever made, absolutely delicious as is! I have made it twice and will likely make it again as the squash and pears are in season now. It is a keeper in my repertoire. Thanks!

I took Foodloves suggestion and roasted the ingredients for about 40 minutes in the oven at 375 F until tender. I then sautéed the roasted vegies in the butter along with the curry powder for a few minutes. Four cups of water was added and all was mixed together and then blended in the blender. I returned this mixture to the pan and added the milk rather than cream and heated it all up. I and my family loved it.

I will definitely make this again, and I will definitely not use as much curry as this calls for next time.  It's pretty much the only thing you can taste.  I think it could stand more ginger as well.  Probably double what it calls for.

My changes: 
Quadruple the recipe, otherwise you only get 4 large bowls.
I didn't have curry, so I used Spice Road's West-African Citrus Spice and it was incredible. 
I omit the cream and use Osem vegetarian broth.

I have made this soup MANY times, and it is one of my favorites. I often substitute apples for the pears, veggie broth for the chicken broth, and I don't add the cream. (I want to keep it as healthy as possible.) I also cook the onions in a little broth instead of butter. I only use 1 teaspoon of curry, and that is still plenty spicy. Since I usually have squash already cooked and pureed in my freezer, I can have this soup ready to eat in less than half an hour. It's a keeper!

absolutely loved this soup, first time ever trying a butternut squash soup but love the hint of ginger in the flavor.  I didn't put in the pears because I didn't have any so I grated 1 small potato into soup for thickening and was VERY pleased with the results.  Will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving as an added treat before dinner.

AMAZING!
I used light coconut milk, ground ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon, onions, frozen butternut squash, 3 small pears, curry, garlic powder. I roasted the pears (not peeled), squash, and onion together while I put the other ingredients on high in the crock pot. 45 minutes after roasting I added to the crock pot and cooked on high 1-2 hours. Then I used the immersion blender and was done.  I topped with Trader Joe's pumpkin croutons...heaven!!!  The only reason I changed the recipe was to use what I had on hand and to be quick while taking care of my little one.

We make a Paleo version of this with coconut oil or ghee instead of butter and then we leave out the half and half.  It is superb and a go to soup for home or gatherings.  When I have time, I get extra pears and make pearsauce (like applesauce) and then garnish the soup with a dollop of the pearsauce (much chunkier than applesauce).

Made a double batch of this soup.  Very easy and omg delicious.  I skipped the cream but otherwise stuck to recipe.   Rather than use the blender I used an imersion blender.  Easier and less mess.  I had a large squash from our garden to use but will buy more as I loved this soup.  So healthy too.

I was so scared, as I am often not a big fan of curry, but this soup was great!  Wonderful comfort food! Creamy & delicious.

We got one of the 10 pound beauties so I made this last week and this week. Last week I froze two quarts of soup and this week it was all gone. Last week I adhered exactly this week I added one-half pound of carrots. I only had two small pears so threw in a can and this recipe is a keeper. Makes squash a favorite in my house. Note: used the immersion blender following other reviewers suggestions.

My whole family loved it.  I modified the recipe by first cooking chucks of the butternut squash in butter until brown and then roasting for 15minutes to speed up the cook time.  I didn't have pears so I used green apples instead.  To finish off, I replaced half-n-half with unsweetened coconut milk.  Delicious!

Excellent! I roasted the squash for 1 hour.  Followed the recipe except I did not add the roasted squash in with the pears because I thought the squash would get over done.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, but added 1/2 of a large sweet potato---just because I had one.  I roasted it with the squash and proceeded as suggested with the combined vegetables.  I loved the soup!  It's delicious and beautiful.  I'll make it again.

Absolutely loved this soup and got raves from everyone who tried it. I also used coconut milk and drizzled it with a bit of hazelnut oil to finish. Scrumptious!

Made this exactly as directed and my husband and I thought it was great. Have made it several times since. As a garnish at serving, we put in pealed apple pieces tossed in cinnamon, which we think really makes the dish perfect.

This was a great recipe! I live on an island six miles off of the coast of Maine, so I have to "improvise" a bit, more often than not. Here's what I did: I had two regular size bags of frozen butternut squash that had been peeled, seeded, etc. I baked all of the squash in a 375 oven for 30 minutes (less time because they were smaller pieces). I cooked the onion, garlic, ginger, curry, chicken broth, salt and pepper, along with the chopped pears. I used a little less ginger and curry with the idea that I could add more, if needed. I didn't need to add more--so, I guess, my suggestion would be to go slow on the ginger and curry. I didn't use my blender, but instead, used a potato masher to break up the squash and pear pieces. It worked great, and left some satisfying chunks. I will definitely make this again!

This soup, for some people, is really good like it is.  For ME, it was better when I toned down the heat from the curry with about a cup of unsweetened applesauce, and added some just a tad of sweetness with a cup or so of apple cider.  (I had about 2 1/2-3 pounds of squash, so the cider didn't make it runny.)

I thought this was really good and the curry was just right and not overpowering.  I would definitely make it again just as written, no complaints!

10/2017 - I've made this soup about 4 times now and it's wonderful and delicious every time! My guests always love it and I always make extra for myself!

Followed this recipe to the letter; I'm sorry.  Every one of the members of my family asked if we were having baby food for dinner.  My older daughters tried valiantly to eat it, by my four-year-old candidly said it was the worst flavor ever.  You might chalk that up to the finicky palates of children, but I am a lover of Thai and Indian foods.

Made this recipe again last night.  I love it everytime.  I again half a block of cream cheese at the end instead of half and half.  It was just as good. Except if I add cream cheese next time I will run it through the blender because it took forever to melt.

This is probably the best butternut squash soup I've ever tasted. I've made it like 3 times now, and the last time I made I didn't have any half and half so I put in an entire can of coconut cream. Delicious.

Easy and delicious.  I followed the recipe with only a small alteration of using 5% cream rather then half and half.  I actually roasted the butternut squash days before and did not make it then due to time constraints.  Turned out delicious...my husband could not get enough.

From three people who do NOT like squash--this soup is delicious. I only had one pear so I added a cup of applesauce. I also only put a dash of half and half. The curry makes it taste like an Indian soup. I wouldn't have known it was a squash soup if I didn't make it.

Ridiculous, actually. Butternut Squash soup is one of my favorites to order in the fall/winter; this recipe is on par with the best I've ever had from a restaurant. Only slight changes to the recipe (based on what wasn't in my fridge/cupboard): I used powdered ginger (same amount as called for) and skim milk vs. half and half. Also, I was in a hurry so I was still baking my squash while the rest of the ingredients simmered, but it didn't seem to matter. Will definitely make this one again and again.

Everyone asks me for this recipe and I've made it MUCH easier for days that I have school.  I make it in the slow cooker!  No roasting, no chopping into uniform pieces.  Here's how it works:
I put the crockpot on HIGH with the butter, onions and garlic for about 30 mins, until the onions are translucent.  Then I stir in the curry and ginger (sometimes I use powdered ginger if I'm out of fresh).  It makes a paste at the bottom of the crock pot.  Then I throw in the stock, pears and squash, which I just core and cut into HUGE chunks.  DO NOT PEEL!  The fiber is good for you and they all soften by the end of the cooking time and are pureed into the soup.  Then I just let simmer on LOW 8 hours or HIGH for 5 hours.  All of the squash and pears are super soft at that time, so I just stick in my immersion blender, puree it all, pour in cream and voila!  Also, if you are with a vegan friend, omitting the cream does no harm to this recipe.... and this comes from a die hard full fat dairy lover!

Made this for a ladies lunch date and impressed my friends!  They were also happy with the swirl of coconut milk I added before putting on the sprinkle of nutmeg just before serving.  Fantastic flavors and a light texture.  Lovely.

Delicious! Only had acorn squash, so used that instead. Also used canned pears instead of fresh. Cooking the squash in the microwave and using the canned pears cut the cooking time dramatically! Probably done in a half hour.

I used whole milk instead of half and half and 3 pears.  I also omitted the ginger because I didn't have any.  I boiled the squash ahead of time, peeled and chopped it, and added it to the soup.  I boiled the onion in the chicken broth instead of sauteing it in butter, and then added the butter in later after pureeing the soup.  This soup had a very strong, distinct flavor.  It wasn't too runny or thin.

So delicious!!! I made this for my daughter's fourth birthday party, with a Tangled theme, when I couldn't think of a good hazelnut soup recipe. I was amazed when all the adults and kids went back for more! I served it with a bowl of toasted hazelnuts to sprinkle, which added a nice crunch.

This flavorful soup is amazingly delicious, with or without the milk (we've made it without by accident a few times and it turned out fine)!  I also like to add more spices than the recipe calls for, but I do that with all recipes:}

This is so delicious!  I used a splash of half and half and the rest coconut almond milk to cut the fat and it was excellent!

I had a bumper crop of butternut squash from my garden this year. I was looking for something different to make with it and came across this recipe. To make this vegan, I used oil instead of the butter, vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth and coconut milk instead of the dairy milk. I also added a small pinch of red pepper flakes when sauteing the onions. It was simple to make and had a nice flavor. I liked the sweetness added from the pears. Even though this seemed like a sufficient amount of curry powder it wasn't very pronounced. If I make this again I will add more.

After years of just logging on and looking at recipies, I joined to say how amazing (and simple) this soup was to make.  We grow winter squash (not butternut, but close enough) and have 3 pear trees so I was looking for something to do with the tons of each we have right now.  WOW was this the best find ever.  The soup is absolutely fahntastic - complex and delicious.  I was too lazy to peel the pears and it didn't seen to hurt the taste at all - it may have even been a plus.  I also didn't have any heavy cream on hand so just used more butter and whole milk which seems to have worked fine because I can't imagine it tasting any better.  Interestingly, while I can't "taste" the pears in the soup, it tastes like there is a bit of brandy or sherry in it which I assume is coming from the pears.

A little bland for us. In fairness, though, I don't keep half and half on hand and so used plain Silk. Still, not a repeat.

Wow!!!  5-Star as-is, no changes.    I'd like to say that it was fantastic with 1 1/2 lbs. of frozen cubed squash, making it a year-round recipe (and is much easier).  Next time I'm going to double the recipe and freeze some.

This was really good!! I just used a 2 pound bag of already cut up butternut squash from Trader Joes.  I used 2 Anjou pears instead of Barlett.  No half and half is necessary at all.  I also added a pinch of Cayenne pepper for an extra kick. YUM!!

Went a little heavier on the garlic and ginger (3 cloves and about a 2 TBSP of ginger). A little lighter on the butter (2 TBSP), and substituted low fat coconut milk for the half and half... excellent result!

UPDATE: Here's a SUPER EASY way to make this soup and it still tastes just as amazing. After you brown the garlic and onions in butter (I cut back on the butter and use half a pack of frozen onions), throw in a 20 oz pack of pre-cut butternut squash and optionally about a cup of baby carrots. Add the seasonings (I use 2 tsp of curry powder instead of the full tbsp) and the broth and let it cook. While it cooks, cut up the two pears and throw them in. Blend when done! 

Oh. Emm. Gee. Did I really just make this super delicious soup? I followed the recipe pretty exactly for once (I didn't want to mess with the combination of unusual flavors!) and It turned out amazing! I actually baked the butternut squash (whole with holes poked for an hour on 400) and scooped out the meat the day before and had it sit in the fridge overnight with a little salt and pepper mixed in. Here's the couple of changes that I did make or rather had to make. I used frozen chopped onion (about half a pack), Comice pears (because that's all I had), and added a couple of sliced carrots to the soup because my squash was on the smaller side. I skipped the half-and-half initially, just swirled some on top right before serving. The guests loved it too! For those that may be curious, it didn't taste too exotic or anything. It just tasted like really really good butternut squash soup similar to the one from Atlanta Bread Company actually! Thank you for such a wonderful and simple recipe!

Absolutely Loved it!!!  Wouldn't change a thing!!  Will be making again!!
Used pre-cut store bought fresh squash and roasted at 350 for 30 min- that cut down significantly on the prep time!!

Wonderful! Used salted butter, veggie broth instead of chicken broth, didn't measure anything, garnished with cilantro & black pepper, served with Naan. Sooo good!  Kinda fool proof.

I'm not a big soup person, but I love this as a tasty fall soup! We use sour cream or plain yogurt in place of the half and half for a lighter soup.

I only used three cups of broth but I have learned over the years that my family expects a thicker butternut squash soup than most people like.  Awesome flavor.

A wonderful,slightly spicy and tasty soup. I added a pinch of nutmeg but that was the only change.  My husband and I got 3 meals out of it.
I will probably make it several times.

PERFECT FALL SOUP! I always thought making soup would take so long and never wanted to spend hours doing it, but this one is so easy! you can cook everything else while the squash is baking and it is ready in no time. Plus it is so delicious. We tried it with and without the half and half and didn't really notice a difference, so we leave it out.

I thought this was really good, my husband thought it was ok, and my teenage daughter did not like.  I guess that averages out to 3 star.  I made exactly as written except cooked the squash for about 1 hr 15 minutes.  Did not have parchment paper so used foil, dull side up, sprayed with Pam.

Wonderful! I'm fond of green pepper with butternut squash so I added some diced with the onion. I don't understand the right time to use pears, they were too fibrous compared to the other ingredients. Next time, I'll try canned pears or the coconut soup that someone suggested. My teenagers didn't care for it, but it's OK- more for me!

I made this and it was very, very good!  I used coconut milk instead of half and half and put 3 habenero peppers in with the garlic/onions etc.  It was delicious and had a nice kick to it!  I would recommend to anyone.

Very tasty stuff!  I made it exactly as intended the first time and enjoyed it greatly.  The second time I roasted the garlic and pears alongside the squash (which definitely takes more like 90 mins to roast) and substituted a half can of light coconut milk for the cream.  I threw in a bit of cayenne too.  YUM, and my boyfriend loved it!

My sister's BF is a classically trained chef, and even though he's the most unpretentious, generous person on earth, it's a little daunting to cook for him, given his qualifications.  I mean, how can you blow away a classically trained chef??  Last night I made this soup with two changes:  I had no pears, so I used apples.  I'm also a dairy goat farmer, and I used goat's milk instead of half and half.  He ate two and a half bowls and pronounced it the best butternut soup he'd ever eaten.  I had to agree with him: it's the perfect blend of savory and sweet, and was delicious with cornbread.  An excellent fall night supper.  Recommended without reservation.

What a great recipe. Everybody loved it. I wasn't sure what curry powder to use as there are various different types available. I ended up using Red Curry Powder and it turned out great. It was on the spicy side so if you prefer it milder, you might want to add a little less. For our family it was great though.
I did not add the two teaspoons of salt as the chicken broth already has salt in it. The taste was great without it.
Will definitely make this soup again very soon.

Great recipe! I added more garlic, ginger and onion than called for - great kick. Otherwise, followed the recipe closely... Used an immersion blender to purée, which saved some cleanup time, and made a wonderfully textured soup.

Very tasty soup. Roasted the squash, onion, and pears together. Sauted the garlic, ginger and curry powder for minute and then added the roasted veggies, and chicken stock. Brought everything to the boil and used an immersion blender. Didn't need the cream at all...got really great compliments from guests at thanksgiving dinner

Baked the squash with fuji apples instead of the pears. I had to TRY not to eat the whole thing in one go. SO SO good!!! My new go-to dish. It has a depth of flavour that I wasn't expecting. Yum! Yum!

Im always looking for low calorie soup recipies--this is a great one.  I omitted the half-n-half and cut the butter in half and the soup turned out great.  Just the right blend of spice and sweet. Thanks for the recipie.

Best butternut squash soup yet - the pear flavour is lovely.  If you live somewhere wher you get smaller pears (we are in Northern Canada), use three to ensure you get the nice taste and texture of the pear too.

This soup is amazing!  I roasted the pears with the squash as others suggested. Will be making this for Thanksgiving dinner for sure!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my church on Soup n Somethin' Sunday.  Everyone LOVED IT!  I will be making more to give away to friends. I made it a week ahead of time minus the half n half and froze it. Then thawed, heated it back up and added the H n H.  I had sour cream & cilantro on hand for garnishing for anyone who wanted it.

Made this soup last night and my husband and I thought it was great. It's probably our new favourite. Very easy prep! I ended up using an apple and a pear, and 1/4c lowfat milk & 1/4c whole milk instead of half and half.

I love this recipe! I bought a butternut squash at our local farmer's market, and while there saw a soup vendor that had a curried carrot soup for sale. I came home and searched for a recipe to use my squash and found this recipe. I used bottled ginger and two apples in place of the pears. It was delicious.

Tasty!!! Made full recipe of eight for two. My fiancee and I loved it. Since I made a lot, I shared it with the neighbors. They also loved it. I like to try recipes as they are called out at first, then I like to tinker. Great and easy.

Amazing soup. Best thing I have made in a long time.  Made some minor adjustments for my preferences.  3 pears instead of 2.  Additional curry and ginger and added a bit of cinnamon. Also used lowfast milk instead of half and half and simmered for longer.  Definitely making again.

It was so-so.  It took me a while to make it - start to finish and I felt there was too much curry and the balance of the soup just wasn't quite right.  No one ate leftovers however, we did enjoy it for the one meal.

Incredible!  I used veggie stock to make it veg-friendly and it is amazing.  Also, had to use ground ginger/onion/garlic because mine was accidentally thrown out in a fridge cleaning spree but I scaled down to compensate and it turned out great.  Next time I'll probably use a little less salt bc of all of the salt in the stock though...

My daughter is a vegetarian and allergic to dairy so I used vegetable stock and coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  I also used red pears. I also sprinkled on some smoked paprika and it was excellent!

The boyfriend loooved this. I had a friend who had recently made some butternut/pear/curry soup and so I decided to look one up. I followed the recipe without changes and I thought it was very tasty. It's hard to find butternut squash outside of thanksgiving season in Switzerland, but I'm sure I will make this again in the future!

So tasty!  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings, since there's only two of us. I added a cup of sliced carrots to the onions, garlic, etc., since they were in the fridge.  Also, used canned pears and added a 1/4 teaspoon of poultry seasoning. Very warm and cozy.  Didn't have half-and-half so used a dollop of plain yogurt just before serving. We will definitely be making this through the fall and winter.

The curry and ginger give this a very Asian flare which we really enjoyed and it's reasonably healthy for you, to boot.  While I enjoyed the play of flavors and I'd quite readily serve it when hosting dinner, it's not one I'm going to make every few weeks during soup season unlike some others I've found.

This was very good but I did add a few items for more flavor, I added 1.5 tsp of brown sugar, 1.5 tsp of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.  I also added 1 tbsp of fresh cilantro towards the end of cooking - very good and very filling!

This soup was quite good. I subbed veggie broth for chicken to make it vegetarian. It seemed to need a little something when it was done, which turned out to be be a dollup of Greek yogurt (or sour cream) in each bowl. That sent it to the next level.

My husband and 5 yr old really enjoyed this...me on the other hand, not quite what I like in a soup.I used ground ginger (all I had) and whole milk. I roasted the pears(not bartlett) with the butternut squash - which took over an hour to be soft! I served it with chive garlic bread(from this recipe).

Used curry paste instead of powder and substituted coconut milk for the other. I also added a hint of garam masala. Tasty, satisfying and easy!

I used veggie bouillon instead of chicken, skim milk instead of half and half, and powdered ginger in place of fresh, but it came out fantastic.  Lovely, subtle flavors that go down smooth.

Loved it!!  I added a can of coconut milk and added less of the half and half.  Delicious.  Definitely will make again.  Husband loved it as well.
