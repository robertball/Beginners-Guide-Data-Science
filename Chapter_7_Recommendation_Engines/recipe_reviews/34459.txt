O.K. Lisa---you deserve major kudos!  This pasta was definitely an "S", as in Superb, Sublime, Sophisticated, etc.  I followed your recipe to the "T", with just 2 changes.  I used Maytag blue cheese, instead of the Gorgonzola.  My second change was proportions of sauce to pasta.  I ended up doing 3/4 of all sauce ingredients, but instead of doing 3/4 of the pasta----I did 1/2 pound pasta, and this entree was perfect for 2.  In other words, a little more sauce to pasta ratio.  I also want you to know that the entire sauce can be made WELL in advance.  At serving, I cooked the pasta, and tossed it with the sauce over heat---Too tasty for words.  Thank you so much for sharing.  More recipes, please!

This was great! I have made it several times, sometimes adding sauteed baby bella mushrooms, chopped spinach, or even leftover cooked chicken.  I am a huge fan of gorgonzola, and this is the best vehicle for gorgonzola I've ever had.  When I have added those other ingredients, I simply double the cheese and balsamic vinegar so the flavors don't get too diluted.  And I've even managed to find a way to eat the arugula  that is so plentiful in season around here, but is normally too bitter for my taste.  I simply add the fresh, chopped arugula in the last step, and the heat of the pasta wilts it nicely.

I don't feel right about simply rating this because I used it more as a jumping off point. I was afraid of using so much onion. So I added: chopped frozen spinach, jarred roasted red peppers, fresh basil, and extra vinegar. It was fabulous, even my roommate who is sometimes afraid to try what I cooked said she would eat a full portion if I made it again.

This was fantastic.  I added some cooked chicken, and used some of the stock to dilute the sauce, as it was a little too thick.  That may have been because I used 8 oz. of gorgonzola, rather than 4.  I added crushed red pepper and julienned sun-dried tomatoes.  It was extremely flavorful.  I had this for dinner last night, and have already had 2 more servings today!  And I NEVER eat lunch! I served this over vermicelli.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, and thanks other reviewers for ideas. In the future, I might add some good olives.

My "meat and potatoes" man loved this dish! I can't believe we ate the whole thing, made half since there's only two of us. The taste of the carmelized onions, the balsamic vinegar and the cheese blended together beautifully to make an extraordinary pasta dish. I added additional salt and pepper at the table. Served with a plate of sliced apples and pears would've been delightful!  Next time...

Fantastic!  I have now made this twice, and although I think it is delicious as is, I think it is AMAZING with a couple changes - one rather weird-sounding.  First - actually caramelize the onions.  You cannot caramelize onions in only 10 minutes - sauteed onions are different from caramelized onions.  This recipe really benefits from truly caramelized onions, which need to be cooked more slowly over a relatively low heat.  Caramelized onions becomes wonderfully sweet - it's sort of amazing that you can get such a flavor from a regular onion (and I did use regular yellow onions.)  The sweetness off-sets the gorgonzola cheese, and I think that many people who did not like the recipe might like it if they truly caramelized the onions.  Also - the second time I made this, I added a lot of sea salt to the cooking onions, and then took a page from a pork chop recipe I think I invented - I mixed a LOT of balsamic vinegar (much more than called for), apple juice, and a bit more sea salt with the cooked onions, and let it reduce while still over heat.  This is quite a departure from the recipe, but it added a wonderful sweet-savory flavor which went well with the cheese.  It does not end up tasting like apple juice at all, and it also adds a bit more liquid.  I also mixed the pasta/sauce with the cheese very well while it was still warm, so the cheese melted completely, forming just a creamy coating, and added chopped almonds for crunch and a subtle flavor.  SO good.

I thought I would love this recipe because I love all of the ingredients on their own.  But after making it, it seems to me to be a huge waste of Gorgonzola.  I'm sorry.

This is good...but it's just missing something. You really have to love the pungency of the gorgonzola to like this dish, but even then, it's a little much. The sweetness of the caramelized onions are the star of the show - but it needs more sweet. I'll put it this way, there is a reason I love to put dried cranberries and candied nuts on my salads to compliment the pungent gorgonzola. This dish too needs something bright/tangy/or sweet to help compliment and complete it. I just don't know what that is. But if you're trying it as is I really enjoyed adding mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, and spinach to the mix.

It was good.  I used red pepper flake olive oil, that gave it a tiny bit of heat.  Maybe will use more cheese next time - and a different balsamic.

I really didn't enjoy this.  I thought about using Cambezola, rather than Gorgonzola and wish I had gone with my instinct because the Gorgonzola was just too much.  However, for anyone who loves gorgonzola, go ahead and try it out.  You may like it.

I did not care for this recipe. I made it EXACTLY as the recipe said. I will never make this again nor will I use gorgonzola cheese! Way too strong and WAY too stinky!

I made it a couple times and each time I found that the Gorgonzola was pretty overpowering, especially combined with the balsamic vinaigrette.  Next time I will cut the amount of gorgonzola in half, use parmesean for the rest of it and leaf out the balsamic vinaigrette.  Also, I made it over pasta once and gnocchi the last time. I will use gnocchi in the future.

This recipe was quick, easy, and best of all--delicious! My whole family loved it, even my 3 year old! My husband took the leftovers to work and said it was even better the next day.  I didn't have "sweet" onions, so I added a touch of brown sugar to mine. Also I drizzled extra balsamic vinegar on top. I will be making this again--soon!

Delicious!  Some reviews have said to increase the sauce.  I just added a bit of extra olive oil and it was delicious.  I agree with the need to add some vegetable to this -- to increase the flavor and make it look more appealing.  I added a 1/2 cup of chopped canned tomatoes because I had them on hand.

This was a great dish! By luck I had just purchased a small block of gorgonzola (it's my favorite snack with fruit) and was struggling to think of something I could make spur of the moment. I did what one user suggested and doubled the cheese and balsamic. It was delicious and easy to prepare - next time going to add some meat in there.

I love this recipie/concept. I do change it up sometimes with the vegtables. I usually put the olive oil in the pan with some minced garlic, red onion, thawed frozen spinach, red peppers (but lately i experimented and added mushrooms and zucchini). I use a 16oz box of penne or rotini. And I usually double the gorgonzola to 8oz since the veggies soak up a lot of the cheese...and my soon to be husband loves cheese :). Hope this helps...and thanks for this great recipie!

I made this as a side dish with grilled chicken and thought it was really tasty. I found this item on the ingredient search while looking for a way to use some gorgonzola. I only used one onion and added a cup of sun-dried tomatoes. I loved the flavor of the carmelized onions with the gorgonzola. Preparation wasn't difficult, presentation was quite nice and I'll definitely be making this again.

This is delicious!  I was short an onion, so I added a little bit of agave nectar to make up the sweetness.  I served it over tortellini with a sprinkle of parmesan and a lot of black pepper.  Next time I'll try the arugula that was suggested earlier.  That sounds lovely.

This was absolutely delicious.  I served to my in-laws who just returned from a 5 star trip to Italy.  After their 9 day trip to the land of Pasta, they loved it!!  Changes?  Only added Asparagus to the sauce & cooked until tender crisp.   That added a nice touch  of green - which otherwise is way to brown looking for the initial eye candy.  Enjoy this sauce - easy, can make ahead, and tasty (one would think too tangy, but not so!)

This was a delicious recipe and quick recipe! I added mixed fresh bell peppers and mushrooms and used shallots becasue that's what I had on hand. Adding the red pepper flakes was also a good suggestion from a comment I read. After the pasta was mixed I added a little fresh Parmesan, the flavor blends well with the Gorgonzola.

Fantastic taste and quick to throw together (partly because we don't do onions).  I used the same amount of sauce and only as much pasta as we needed.  I also added mushrooms and spinach but could see a lot of other options would be good and change it up.

My 12 y.o. is a gorgonzola addict.Tried it last weekend and it tasted incredible. It was my first time to caramelize onions and it took me around 20 minutes- don't know if i was doing something wrong. Anyway, my onions were perfect and together w/ the b. vinegar and gorgonzola... it was flavour heaven!!! Thanks so much!

This is a very very strong recipe and I don't think I EVER say that.  It is very pretty and a nice starting place.  Maybe add a cup of peas? Or some cream to mellow it down?  Either way def. give this one a taste before serving it up.

It is hard to rate a recipe when you make changes to it, but I have to give credit to Lisa for giving me the idea! Thanks Lisa! 5 Stars! 
I made the recipe for 2, so the ingredient amounts may seems far less than what was originally called for. 
I browned ½ the onions with 4 stripes of bacon (bacon chopped into small pieces), I added garlic once browned. I added the balsamic as suggested by Lisa. 
I put the onion mix into a smaller bowl. In the pan I browned pork sausage (1/2 package J.Dean), and then added the sausage to the mixture in the bowl. I used all 4oz of the gorgonzola. I cubed it added it to the bowl mixture. 
I put the entire mixture into a low temp oven. (waiting for my husband to come home). I pan fried leeks and set them aside on paper towels. Once the pasta was boiled and drained, I tossed the onion/sausage mix in. 
I topped off the pasta with the leeks! Served with a warm loaf of crusty bread! My husband loved every bite!! I will be making this again for sure! Thanks Lisa for the idea!!! I would never have thought to blend the balsamic with the gorgonzola!!

The flavour was FABULOUS but the presentation was lacking.  I also felt like this needed some chicken.  I doubled this recipe but when I went to make the pasta, it looked like it was too much so I cut the pasta to 1 1/2 lbs.... I think that next time I will also add some broccoli or Red Peppers as it needs some "colour".  The Onion/Gorgonzola/Balsamic combo is so delicious....

I followed this recipe exactly and it was delicious. Perfect amount of cheese, and I added chopped spinach to the hot pasta after cooking. Added a dash of fresh ground black pepper on top and mixed in before serving.

I thought the end result was great, but getting there took longer than the recipie indicated.  I followed the recipie exactly but the onions took close to an hour to saute.  Not sure what happened there... I will give it another try because it was so tasty.  I also recommend this as a side dish because the flavors are so strong.  Maybe serve with steak...

Quick, easy, delicious. Who could ask for anything more?  Don't skimp on the gorgonzola. Better cheese = better dinner.

This is fabulous!  I put grilled steak on top of it and it was out of sight!  I used 2 1/2  pounds of top round steak, 3/4" thick (you could also use boneless beef sirloin).  I cut the steak in 4" x 4" pieces (I was aiming for "medallions") and grilled it outside-- in the dead of winter!  I doubled the sauce but kept the pasta (fettucini) at 1 pound.  I added the cheese while the sauce was still in the pan so that it would melt.  This served 7-8 people.  I served it to company at a small dinner party and it was fun to grill outside in January (I'm in Philadelphia)!  Some of my guests followed me outside while I grilled.  A beautiful, wonderful dish served with a simple green salad (spinach and cherry tomatoes) and red wine. What a hit!

We really liked this.  It's got strong flavors, so it's not a go-with-anything kind of dish.  We thought it might be good with chicken added, as a main dish.  Also liked it cold the next day.

I really like this dish (I'm crazy about pasta and the rest of the ingredients), but my sister thought it was too rich and didn't finish her plate.  It takes closer to 40 minutes for me to carmelize the onions.

Recipe requires almost double the sauce than called for. Very rich and good, but not great. I added sun dried tomatoes to help it out, but you could get creative w/ other ingredients and I bet it would be nice. Probably won't make again.

This was an excellent starting off point, thank you! 
I added shallots, cherry tomatoes, cremini mushrooms and a little chicken broth with the garlic (the shallots were instead of the onions) and threw in some crushed red pepper flakes. I toasted some walnuts, and fried fresh sage (which crisps up in oil)for garnish, and cracked peppercorns. It had amazing depth and wonderful mouth feel. 
We sopped it up with a baguette wanting it to never end!

This was amazing. We couldn't get enough! I added some boiled chicken to the pasta. It looked like it was going to be waaaay too much onion, so I added some of the onion to the boiling chicken, with some chicken broth, garlic, salt and pepper. I think I would have been fine having used all of the onion in the mixture, but the chicken turned out so tasty, I'm not sure I would have changed a thing. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very tasty and easy to prepare.  I cooked enough spaghetti for two large serves and sauce for four, used extra creamy Danish blue vein and red onions which took about twenty five minutes to brown.  As suggested by some of the other reviewers, I added spinach leaves to the cooked pasta.  Be sure to mix the sauce through evenly.  Will make again!

Sorry to be alone here, but I did not enjoy this at all.  I usually enjoy gorgonzola, but found this to be much too strong.  The kids took one bite and nearly cried.  My husband didn't mind it, but didn't go for seconds either.  The kids and I ended up eating leftovers instead.

I've made this rerecipe many times with just a splash of balsamic.  When I saw the 2Tbsp here, I decided to try it.  After tasting it, I looked at the recipe again.  Surely I read it wrong.  It must have said 2tsp.... No, Tablespoons it was.  The balsamic ruined one of my all time favorite recipes.  I'll stuck to my splash of balsamic in the future.

Easy to make.  It was good but it's very important to serve it hot.  My mistake was putting it on the table before everyone was there.  I'm going to give it a second chance.

My husband. and I did not like this. We thought we liked gorgonzola, but I guess we don't. Maybe I will try again with a different cheese-maybe romano/parmesan.

This sauce is delicious and easy.  I carmelized the onions over an hour to sweeten them even more.  The only thing I didn't like about this recipe was the color of the sauce - brown - my kids wouldn't touch it.

My friend found this recipe a couple of years ago and we have been using it ever since. I love it. But it can be a little rich, I find that if I just add sauce to a single dish of pasta, the proportions work better.

Very tasty. Once the onions and garlic were browned, I removed the mixture and added two salmon fillets to the remaining oil. I cooked the salmon and served it with the pasta.

This recipe was actually a bit bland.  The gorgonzola was very mild and we could barely detect it.  I added sliced calamata olives and red pepper flakes to the leftovers which made it much better, I wish I would've added them earlier.

Made it exactly as described for a group of 6 and everyone LOVED it!  That was 2 weeks ago and I'm making it again just for hubby and myself since Walla Walla onions are on sale again!

i have made this several times now, and although it has no presentation value (it all turns a funny brown color) it tastes incredible. the flavors work really well together!

Definitely an interesting set of flavors.  My kids were split.  The 2 year old liked it, but the 4 year old did not.  I probbly will not make it again.

"Simple is better"---loved this recipe! I used feta and yellow onions because that is what I had on hand.

Simple but delicious way to cook up pasta with things you probably already have in your pantry. I've made it with plain ol' yellow onions (give 'em time to caramelize) and whatever cheese i had on hand that was even remotely similar, including feta! So easy, I make it fresh for lunch several times a week. You'll feel like a pro!
