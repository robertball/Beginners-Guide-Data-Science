Because of all the rave reviews this recipe has received I made this meal last night for my fiancee, who just returned from Iraq. (this was his first real meal in five months and he had wanted spaghetti)I'm sorry, but I just didn't think it was that spectacular. I agree with those reviewers who said the sauce lacked flavor. It had an odd smell and after taste, which I think is due to the onion mix. I'm sure the sauce will taste better today. But if you are looking for a traditional sauce recipe, this is not the one for you. As a side note, my fiancee liked the sauce and with him coming back from war, that's all I cared about.

We loved this one! The allspice and cinnamon add that "something elusive" to the flavor.  I used 1 lb. ground turkey and 1 lb. lean ground beef. I also used about 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms rather than canned. Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

This is thick and very good. I like a stronger tomato flavor, so I added a can of tomato paste. Smells wonderful, too!

It was very good but be careful with the cinnamon.  I did not have allspice so I upped the cinnamon a tad.  Do not add extra cinnamon.  If anything, use a little less than is recommended.

This is a wonderful recipe! If you like things with a unique flair, try this sauce. My husband loved it. I bet it would make a superb lasagna sauce as well. You can add extra seasonings to your taste, as it simmers. GREAT RECIPE! THANKS!

My hubby dislikes tomato sauce emmensely and loved it, can't stop talking about it!
I'm allergic to red wine & choose to substitute for 1 TBSP white wine vinegar.
I let it simmer about 3 hours and the kids couldnt wait.  The aroma was awesome and the taste superb!  It will be used time and again in this household!  Thanx, thanx, thanx!!!

I used my own msg-free onion "soup" mix, fresh mushrooms and I used organic canned tomatoes and tomato paste. This turned out a very unique sauce, not like anything we've ever had before. I would have never thought to put cinnamon and allspice in a sauce but it worked. My husband kept remarking that there was something different that he couldn't put his finger on--though he was kind of iffy about wether he liked it. The kids thought it was great. This was very quick to assemble and really came together with ingredients I had on hand. Next time, I'd like to try this with organic tomato sauce and skip the water.

Tried this last night. I had to make a few changes because I didn't stock a few items. This is a great sauce. I had to replace red wine so, believe it or not, to make the 1/2c "Red wine" I used 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar and the rest brewed coffee. Complimented the cinnamon and allspice very well. I hate to change others' recipes but this turned out super.

This is the best spaghetti sauce.  My husband, who usually makes up his own sauce as he cooks, loved this one.  He even said it was better than his. A definite keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Tested on 6.  Those who prefer a mild flavor and meaty sauce liked it best.

Absolutely delicious. Finally, a sauce that truly stands out from the pack! Great mixture of spices. Freezes very well, tastes just as good as when it was first made! A+!

I used sausage in this and added a little Italian seasoning.  This was really good and smelled fabulous while simmering away.  I used this in the recipe on this site for "Grandma's Sour Cream Lasagna".  It was a huge hit with our guests.  This is a keeper, thanks for sharing your recipe!

This spaghetti sauce recipe should GO TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS! It is, without question, the best I've ever tasted, and what a surprisingly delightful blend of flavors. I threw out all my other spaghetti sauce recipes I've been making for years because this one is THE BEST!! As for being a meaty sauce, well I tried it with less ground beef also and found that either way is excellent -- depending on one's preference. This sauce will definitely go in my next family cookbok. Thanx so very much for sharing this recipe!!

This was a very meaty recipe.  It has a unique flavor that I wasn't really crazy about, though, as my husband said it does grow on you!  I would probably add more tomato paste or sauce next time, as I prefer a "saucier" sauce.

OK.  It did remind me of the military chow hall, so perhaps that is why it isn't rated any higher.

I had a cinnamonny sauce in a restaurant once, and had searched for a recipe...then I found yours! My only substitutions were fresh basil over dried and a slow simmer of longer than an hour, but other than that, I didn't change a thing - solid 5 stars!

Great sauce for my field grade officer!  We loved it.  Only thing...I would omit the salt next time.  Plenty of salt in the onion soup mix.

I had made meatballs to go w/spaghetti for dinner and realized I had no sauce, so I found this recipe and although I had to tweak it (not all ingredients on hand), I found it surprisingly good. I skipped the mushrooms (don't like canned ones anyway) and used dry parsley instead of fresh. I also ended up crumbling some of the meatball "leftovers" into the sauce instead of straight ground beef. I'll use this again, and not just when I'm in a pinch!

This was not good AT ALL!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  It tasted like wine really bad.  So we added some Italian seasoning and oregano...no help, we tried more pepper...no help.  Finally we gave up.  I made it for 45 people for my daughters birthday party.  I had made it the night before and hoped the flavor would sink in and be better.  The next day it didn't taste at all!!!  I mean plain, absolutely no flavor to it???  how it happened I will never no!   I don't know about trying it again!

I totally liked this and hubby is warming up to it. He said it was really good cold for lunch today. I made a few changes. I used ground sweet Italian sausage as my meat. I just knew it would mix well with the secret ingredient. I also added a pinch of sugar as I do to all tomato sauces. It helps lower the acid and removes the after taste some tomato sauces have. I followed the recipe as written from that point. Did a taste test with my family and then made the rest of my changes, I had a tomato needing to be used and I like a more rustic sauce so I cut  it up and threw it in the pot, while that simmered a little longer I removed the stem and vain in the spinach I picked a week ago and really needed using up. I threw that in the pot and called it dinner. My picture is of the sauce before I added the spinach. Delicious with and without the spinach. This recipe is going in my winter round up of comfort foods.

Fantastic! You've pinpointed exactly what has been missing from my sauce that I just couldn't put my finger on.  This is now my go to sauce.  I can't wait to try a meatless version on top of meatloaf!

Great recipe.  I did not have mushrooms and instead grated some carrots and zuchinni.  Instead of soup mix I chopped fresh onion and browned with the meat.  The flavor is excellant.

Great recipe for spaghetti sauce. I liked the flavors of cinammon, allspice (subbed ground clove, nutmeg and ginger). We used sweet Italian turkey sausage with the casing removed and browned and crumbled this.  We also added a bit of brown sugar to take some of the acidity out of the sauce.  Yum!

I really enjoyed this sauce.  We had it tonight with the "Italian Bread Using a Bread Machine" off this site, made into cheese garlic bread.  Like another review I read, I think this would make a dynamite lasagna sauce.  I found it a bit runnier than I am used to with meat sauces, but it's probably my own fault, as I didn't have crushed tomatoes, so I subbed 2 cans of diced that I pulsed in the food processor.  I also added beef broth in place of the wine, as the only wine I have in the house is a bit spendy and I think hubby would have cried.  I'll add another can of tomato paste next time for more tomato flavor, but otherwise really good.  I froze the extra and I'm sure it'll be even better when I thaw it to use again.  Thanks for a really good recipe!

I've been looking for a good sauce recipe and this is the best I've ever had!!!!!!! Doubled the garlic, as we love garlic, and used fresh mushrooms, but left the rest of the recipe alone. Will make this again.

This was really tomatoey and okay tasting, but missing some wow or zip. My husband did not like the cinnamon so I won't make this again. I used this in a baked spaghetti dish instead of a jarred sauce. It was okay, but just not quite to our preference. Thanks.

Excellent robust sauce. I used 1.5 lb. of turkey, instead of meat, but made no other changes.

The cinnamon and allspice were questionable when reviewing the recipe, but added something different to the sauce. On a side note, it makes a lot of sauce so we ate spaghetti for several days! I have made this over and over again, as my husband and I both really like it!

Impressive! Only made very minor changes... doubled the mushrooms, cut the meat in half, used red wine vinegar, didn't have any allspice so I added some ground cloves and nutmeg, and doubled the black pepper. I must admit I was a bit wary, but this is definitely a keeper!

I wasn't sure what to expect but this turned out beautifully.  It has a great flavor and the left-overs are even better!  I only used one pound of ground beef and kept the remainder of the recipe exactly the same.  It came out perfectly.  I think two pounds would be too much meat...

I skipped the onion soup mix, and used a bottle of premade spaghetti sauce.  It smelled heavenly while simmering, and the cinnamon added a unique sweetness that was excellent.

No No NO This is wrong. You NEVER add cinnamon to spaghetti sauce.  I told my husband if he ever did it again I would kill him.  IT IS WRONG!

The whole family loved this recipe, we did have to make some changes because we did not have all the ingredients as listed.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, a can of cream of mushroon soup instead of mushrooms (actually made it a lot creamier)and we did add 4 small slices of Old El Paso pickled Jalopeno's diced very fine which added a nice zip without too much heat. There is no way anyone could say this is bland, it's a nice blend of spices and I will definitely make again.

I THOUGHT THIS SAUCE WAS SO TASTY. I HAD NEVER COOKED WITH WINE BEFORE SO I WAS A LITTLE HESITANT, BUT THE RESULTS WERE GREAT. I MADE A DOUBLE BATCH SO I HAD SOME TO FREEZE AND I AM SO GLAD I DID.

This sauce is excellent.  However, the submitter is wrong as to the definition of "field grade."  Field grade is pay grades O4 through O6 (Major through Colonel).  O7 and above are general officers.  "Cream of the crop" can be found at every level.

Fantastic sauce. I learned the cinnamon trick several years ago. I used only 1/2 an envelope of onion soup mix, and I added more vegetables - grated carrot, chopped zucchini, and red and yellow peppers.  This sauce is sooooo good!

This was a awesome sauce ! I added a little oregano and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Perhaps added a bit more red wine as I did not measure. Will be making this again.

There are a couple of pizza places in Brandon MB that use this recipe (or something similar). I've missed those pizza joints and have been looking everywhere for something similar since I moved. This is for real a $10,000 recipe!!! I knew they used cinnamon but the onion soup mix is the key.

I love experimenting with non-traditional spices in foods, such as cinnamon in this one. Between the cinnamon and dried onion soup mix, it has a terrible aftertaste. Sorry to give it such a negative review but won't be making it again obviously.

A twist of unique flavor to enhance the "old sauce".  Definitely worth a try!  I omitted the onion mix, but added hot Italian sausage, sliced and browned, added brown sugar.

I was slightly disappointed in this recipe. It was missing something. The cinnamon and allspice were great flavours, but it didn't have any zip. The crushed tomatoes overpowered everything (maybe next time half stewed tomatoes and half crushed?). I tried adding Worchestershire, some maple syrup, some cayenne (and I don't even like spicy) - nothing seemed to give it some zip. I think adding some chili powder and kidney beans would make this a great chili recipe but definately not a great spaghetti sauce. Sorry. :-(

I did not care for this sauce. I followed the recipe exactly but I didn't like the flavor while eating it and especially didn't like the after-taste. However, my boyfriend thought it was allright.
