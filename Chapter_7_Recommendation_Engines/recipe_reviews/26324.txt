This recipe worked well for me.  I baked the tarts at 350 degrees in the small tart pans.  I did add 2 T. milk to the icing to make more of a glaze.  These tarts remind a bit of fern cakes, but since they are chocolate, they are even better...more like little black forest torte cakes.  The Mr. said they were "dangerous".

The crust was so dry it would not fit down into the tartlet pan - the recipe also does not specify the temperature in which to bake them.  I had to make a different crust. I have not yet tried the tarts themselves, but I don't have very high hopes.  Hope others will have better luck.

Fond memories of a childhood bakery favorite.  I love these.  You can make them with or without the cocoa, delicious either way.
