This recipe was great and easy!  I think the recipe as is would be great, but I did add a couple extras.  I chopped a half of a shallot and cooked with the green onion and garlic and I also added about 1 tbsp of hot pepper paste to the sauce mix to add a little heat.  Definitely making this again and often.
