I really liked this recipe! I changed the quantities to 6 servings and used 5 zucchinis. To have enough lamb I had to use 50% more lamb (On top of changing the servings to 6). I ground my own lamb from fresh lamb shoulder. Gutting the Zucchini is difficult - use a long, thin knife and careful not to break the skin! I added the guts of the zucchini to the sauce which added some needed texture and this way I did not waste any food. Next time I will use 30% less mint. It was a little too minty for me but maybe ok for other people. Also I simmered it for 30 minutes after adding garlic rather than 15. I'm glad I did that. Make sure you choose zucchinis that are as fat as possible! It's not a super easy recipe but it looks elegant and exotic when served with the sauce on the top. I served it with potatoes fried in olive oil and chopped spinach with savory, salt, pepper and oregano. Went together very well!! Good meal to impress guests with!!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I made a few changes though. For one I cooked the rice before mixing it with the lamb and tomato paste.  Also I couldn't find and ground lamb so I bought a lamb steak and cut it into small pieces.   Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful!

ok, so i will admit i am not good at following directions. i already have had this many times, so i added more lamb per Dh's request. also, tweeked the spices slightly because i have the imported spices from saudi. very good and still a favorite in my house but i had a hard time getting the sauce to seem not too watery
