I fixed this for Christmas dinner.  Although I'm not a big squash lover, I have to admit, this was very tasty.  My mom, dad and husband "loved" it and my dad even asked for the recipe.  I followed the directions to the letter and wouldn't suggest changing anything.  I'll fix this again.

A nice change of pace, but the orange flavour was a little overwhelming. Do yourself or the dishwasher a favour, and put some foil in the bottom of the pan. The sugar in the sauce makes a terrible burnt mess.

Wonderful acorn squash recipe!  My husband is not normally a huge fan of most squash, and even he thought this was a great dish.  The orange brandy sauce really makes it;  I did not have regular brandy, but I did have a bottle of Cointreau (orange brandy) which was wonderful because it only added to the orange flavor.  I also used fresh o.j. right out of the fridge, since I never keep the concentrated stuff around.  Delicious recipe!

The orange was a little too strong. Otherwise incredible.

I did not really care for this...I don't know, the brandy just didn't do it for me.

I noticed that there are few reviews and those are quite a few years back.  I do hope that does not mean it is not being cooked as it is really yummy!  I don't have concentrate so just used orange juice and it worked just fine.  If you like yours sweet, you might add a little more brown sugar.
