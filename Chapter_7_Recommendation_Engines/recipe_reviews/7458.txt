This was a great recipe basis. However, I like chocolate frosting to be SUPER chocolatey and not very sugary at all. So I used much less sugar (to taste) and melted two oz. unsweetened chocolate with a handful of semisweet chips and a tab of butter. I then added this to the frosting, making it dreamily rich and intense. To bring out the chocolate flavor even more, I stirred some instant coffee with a bit of water (one could also mix it with the extract) and added to taste. The result: sinfully rich and uber chocolatey frosting that holds its shape and is perfect on Chocolate-Zucchini Cupcakes (also on this site). It couldn't get any better.

Delicious and super easy to make. Like other reviewers I only needed about half the recommended amount of powdered suger to achieve the right consistancy. You should also know that the frosting is extremely sweet, so go easy with it. In addition, be sure to sift the sugar so you don't end up with lumpy frosting.

Great frosting!!  I made it on the spur of the moment and had to substitute cocoa powder for the chocolate chips by using 6 TBSP. of cocoa and 1/2 cup of butter and half the powdered sugar and it turned out great.  Just enough to frost a 9x13 cake.

This is the best Chocolate Frosting I've ever had and very easy to make. The sour cream is a great addition and greatly improves the taste. I got rave reviews from my family. Goes great with One Bowl Chocolate Cake III! Will make again!

Had a box (yeah I said box) of  yellow cake mix that needed to be used up.  I decided to make cupcakes and I wanted a quick, easy, not too sweet chocolate frosting for them.  I did cut back on the powdered sugar a bit as a personal preference.  While this didn't have a very deep chocolate flavor it was certainly quick and easy.  I would make this one again.  Thank you for the recipe Mary Beth.

This is a deliciously rich frosting.  I made a Pirate Ship cake for my son't 4th Birthday party.  I used this frosting on it.  I did double the recipe and had just enough.  Everyone enjoyed the frosting....some even asked for the recipe.  I love the bit of tang the sourcream gives it.  Thanks Mary Beth....this will be used over and over, I am sure!

Smooth and tasty!  I added 1 tablespoon of cocoa and also 1/2 cup whipped cream cheese and reduced the sugar to two cups.  An earlier review mentioned adding a bit of instant coffee which made this the best I've ever made.  Thank you!  I plan on playing with this recipe with different levels of cocoa and dark chocolate.  I plan to spread a thin layer of my raspberry freezer jam to the center of my next cake.....OMG!!!

Nice creamy, chocolatey frosting.  I used milk chocolate chips and only a cup of powdered sugar, and frosted a devil's food cake.  I think I'll use dark chocolate next time for more flavor.

This is a terrific recipe! It was a huge hit with my family and friends that tried it! Excellent flavor, texture and spreadability! It even smells great! I am making another cake (1 week later) for another birthday party and this frosting was specifically requested!

This is easily the best chocolate frosting recipe I have ever tried.  I put it in my Kitchen Aid mixer for a just a few minutes and it was light, creamy, rich and chocolate-y.  This will turn any cake into a delight!  My guests asked for seconds.

I'm not a big fan of this one.  Can't quite put my finger on it - is it that I prefer frosting with more butter, or is it less sugar? (essentially the same difference) I ended up playing with this quite a bit until I was reasonably satisifed with it, both in terms of texture as well as consistency. There are SO many great chocolate frostings on this site - unfortunately this was not one of them for me.

I absolutely love this frosting!  The consistency was nice and firm, yet still fluffy.  I really like the tang from the sour cream - added just enough flavor to make this frosting special.  The only reason I didn't give the frosting 5 stars is because I altered the type of chocolate used - I used 3 squares of bakers chocolate instead of the chips.  I did this because of the reviews stating that the frosting was too sweet.  I wanted a big batch of frosting, so I wanted to use all of the sugar.  With this substitution, I thought the flavor was perfect - not too sweet and not too bitter.      I will use this recipe (with modification) over and over!

Ok recipe as written, but extremely sweet. To cut sweetness, I did a few things differently. Gently brown the butter over low heat, add a heaping Tbsp flour. and 1 Tbsp good quality cocoa powder (NOT hot cocoa powder), and then add the chocolate chips. Heat thru and stir until all chips are melted. Next, instead of waiting until mixture cools, just let it sit for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, then add the powdered sugar before everything else. Stir to combine well (adding to still warm butter/chocolate mixture helps to soften the sugar crystals so that frosting is less "grainy" in texture), then add the vanilla and salt. Add the sour cream last, a little at a time, until you have desired tartness to sweetness.

This is a really good, creamy, rich frosting recipe, but I found it a bit sweet. I didn't end up adding all of the powdered sugar either...probably more like 2 1/4 cups. It has a wonderful taste, a tiny bit of tang, but plenty of richness from the sour cream. I think I'll be making this again, but I might just substitute some unsweetened chocolate for some of the chocolate chips, or perhaps add some cocoa along with (or instead of!) some of the powdered sugar. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it is very good!!!

Followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfect!! The tang of the sour cream is the perfect contrast to the sweetness of the confectioners' sugar. This is great on yellow or chocolate cake. We loved this recipe, and will be using it again and again!! Thanks for sharing:)

Awesome! I doubled the recipe but only used about 3 cups of sugar to get the consistency I wanted. I also added a tablespoon of dark cocoa. This had such a beautiful glossy look to it. Thank you for the recipe.

Great recipe!  I always looked for a chocolate frosting that did not get hard.  This is the one.  I too cut back on the sugar but it was creamy and awesome.  Has a definite subtle bite with the sour cream, but a pleasant experience.  Very versatile icing as well...decorating or just frosting a cake.

I made this tonight to top a basic chocolate cake.  It was really easy and really good!  I loved that the frosting was creamy and easy to spread.  I am not a fan of the typical buttercream frosting.  I thought this was much better.  I did cut down on the powdered sugar.

Great recipe. I was a bit unsure of using the sour cream because I normally would make frosting with cream cheese but it still turned out delicious. I filled the middle of the cake with a layer of the frosting and should have made more because I ran out and only could frost the top. Will most definitely use it again!

Wonderful recipe. Everyone loved it. Frosting went on the cake easily, hardened delightfully on the outside yet remained soft below the surface. I would improve it with less sugar and maybe darker chocolate.

This is delicious.  I admit, per the other reviewers saying it was a bit tart, I only used 1/4 cup of the sour cream and added 1/4 cup of heavy cream.  It came out perfect and I can't stop licking the bowl!!  :)  I hate changing a recipe and then rating it but this is definitely a keeper w/ that minor change!

This was very good. I mixed 1/3 unsweet and the remaining semi sweet chocolate. I like a less sweet frosting. I made a regular devils food cake mix split and frosted between layers.

very good!  i didn't bother measuring the powdered sugar, but i'm pretty sure i didn't even use a cup of it. My mixer broke so i had to do this by hand with a wooden spoon and the frosting still turned out wonderfully!

This has become my favourite frosting--I have made a batch of vanilla cupcakes just to be able to eat it!  It's easy, and the tang of the sour cream puts it right over the top.  Mmmmmmmmmmmm.

The first time I didn't let the chocolate cool enough I think.  Was very thick.  So, the next time, I listened to the other viewers and I added 1 extra tablespoon of butter to the chocolate chips. Then I let cool. Then I added a splash of almond extract to the mix with the vanilla. I gradually added powdered sugar 1/2 cup at a time while keeping track.  I actually liked it's consistency at 3 cups. It was delicious!  My son even requested it for the next cake!  I'm not using store bought anymore!  This was quite easy! Thanks!

This is a most delicious frosting--not too sweet and great consistency.  The first time I made it, I followed instructions exactly as written and everyone enjoyed it.  The second time I made it, I only had 1/2 cup of semisweet chocolate chips so for the other 1/2 cup I used the cinnamon morsels and added 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder because I only had almost 2 1/2 cups of confectionery sugar in my pantry.  It turned out with the same consistency as the original recipe and was just as delicious.  I frosted a 9" 2-layer zucchini pecan cake and had plenty of frosting with a bit left over.  I used the extra frosting on graham crackers as a treat for my grandson.  Thanks Mary Beth for sharing your recipe.  It is now part of my "keeper" recipes.

great recipe but way too much sugar. i only added 1 cup of confectioners sugar and it's just fine. i can't imagine adding almost 2 more cups. but other than that it's easy and good.

I followed this exactly and I loved it. It tastes almost like fudge. I don't give 5 stars to a recipe unless it wowed me, and this really did! I would say that it has the potential to get dry and crumbly if left out, so be sure to seal in an airtight container or serve promptly. I used it on cupcakes made from Dark Chocolate Cake I by Carol.

Easy to follow and make.  My cupcakes were frosted start-to-finish in 45 minutes flat!  (even with a mini helper)

It was perfectly sweetened (not too sweet, not too bitter) and I put it on top of the One Bowl Chocolate Cake recipe found here.

This frosting is yum, yum yummy!  I made it with all the ingredients, just as instructed and it tasted great!  My only problem was the consistency: no matter how long I beat it, it would not stiffen up.  This may have been my fault, however, as I did not let the chocolate/butter mixture cool very much before adding the remaining ingredients.  Will be more careful to do that when I make it again, and I WILL make it again!  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

Just made this frosting to frost a yellow butter cake. I followed other reviewer suggestions and cut back the sifted powdered sugar to 2 cups and I added 1 tsp. instant coffee. I love the hint of coffee and the sour cream gives it a nice tang but I still find it to be quite sweet. It made my teeth tingle a little :-)) It is very chocolatey and rich on its own so hopefully tasting it on cake may tone it down a bit, Overall, very delicious and creamy. I'd make it again for the ease of it alone. I might try mixing the semi-sweet with some other types of chocolate to change it up now and again.

This is delicious! Much more rich and smooth than your normal chocolate frosting made with cocoa powder. I took Renee's suggestion and didn't use all of the sugar - I ended up using almost 2 cups and it's still very sweet and a great consistency. This is my new go-to chocolate frosting recipe!!

This is an OMG recipe!!!  Excellent and delicious.  I used non fat yogurt...lower in calories.  That's almost a joke when making this recipe, but any calories you can save is worth it!  This is absolutely delicious!  It's my favorite chocolate icing now!  No need to alter a thing.  Just enjoy it!

Frosting turned out well.  I added 2 cups of powdered sugar and it worked for my tastes, not too sweet but not too tangy.

Very yummy...loved the bit of 'tang' from the sour cream!  I scaled this recipe down as I only needed enough to frost Humungous Cookies, from AR too.  I didn't actually frost, but rather 'wrote on' the big cookies.  Super easy to make and it set up nicely as writing on my cookies!  Thanks :)

Super easy and delicious.  I used only 1 cup of powdered sugar and added cayenne pepper since I love the contrast between spicy and sweet.  Used this on 12 cupcakes and had enough frosting left over for 12 more.  Thanks Mary Beth for an awesome recipe!

This was a great frosting recipe. Despite reviews to add only half the sugar I added all and was glad I did. I like to decorate my cakes and even with all the sugar it was soft (but NOT runny). For the decorative piping I added a little extra sugar for firmness and the piping looked fine. The taste was really great too. I have had great luck with letting a cake sit for a few hours (or overnight) before serving. This seems to enhance the flavors of the cake and the frosting together. It was really good and very easy to make. I made it with the "Black Magic Cake"  for my husbands birthday and it was a hit.

Mmm, This frosting is great, that sour cream adds a nice tang and it goes great on top of a super sweet dessert (like one bowl chocolate cake 3 from this site).

Very good - very chocolatey! I have been in search of the "perfect" chocolate homemade frosting and this has been the best so far, just not the "perfect" one I'm looking for. Love the sour cream. I did use 2 1/4 cups and powdered sugar and it was plenty sweet. However, my consitency was not as thick as I would have liked. Which kind of confuses me b/c the pcitures posted are thick and creamy (?). While it was good, this is very chocolatey, and I was wanted more of a richer deeper chocolate taste. This reminded us of milk chocolate rather than a fudge chocolate.  I used on a yellow cake.

I'm adding my 5 stars to the list of this great recipe! I made this frosting and only modified it by adding a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder and about 2oz. of baking chocolate. Put this on top of the "BLACK MAGIC CAKE" from this sight. I baked the cake in a 9X13 pan and when cooled, I split the cake in half to make two layers (using a Wilton cake slicer) and then put the two halves back together with a whole jar of marshmallow creme fluff. I called it a Susy Q (like Hostess cakes but only with frosting!) cake at the party I took it too. Great hit with the chocolate loving ladies there!!

This frosting was fabulous!  However, I tasted it after adding only 2 cups of sugar and liked it better and wished I hadn't added the last 3/4 c. The last 3/4 c. made it too sweet and you couldn't taste the tang of the sour cream.  Will definitely use this recipe again, but with the modification of only adding 2 c. sugar. (Also, I learned that you shouldn't chill this frosting or it will set up too thick and you'll have to soften it in the microwave for a few seconds.)

Wonderfully easy with great consistency.  Super rich and creamy.  This frosting also does great after freezing.  I had stored the left-overs in the freezer and then took them out to frost some cupcakes I'd made on the fly one weekend.  The consistency was still moist and delicious.

OH MAN!! This chocolate frosting is SOOOO good! Only thing that I did different was cutting down the sugar to a little under 2 cups (I don't like my frosting sickeningly sweet) and it was perfect for my tastes. Very quick and simple to make, I microwaved the chocolate and butter and then whipped it up with the rest of the ingredients in my kitchen aid mixer and it was perfectly creamy and oh so fluffy! This is my new favorite frosting and I plan on using it over and over again. Bye bye canned frosting! Thanks a million Mary Beth for sharing this recipe with us!

Excellent!  Pretty much followed the recipe without any remarkable adjustments for my Hubby b-day on Sunday.  I used it to frost a chocolate layer cake and he and the kids devoured it.  He said it was the best he'd ever had, including his mom's!  One note: While I was making the frosting, it didn't seem like there would be enough to frost two cakes, but I had plenty, even with the kids stealing a taste here and there.  Very good recipe...definitely a keeper

I made this to top a basic chocolate cake, need something quick.. Family dinner last minute thing. This was quick and very tastey. Everyone at our family dinner raved about the taste. I also toped it slightly with powdersugar,(just shofted it over the top) Then took some very high quailty dark chocolate, shaved it and added that as well (and as another review suggested added a small amount of strong coffee.) This did add to the chocolate tangy taste!  Thank you for sharing. This is a chocolate frosting keeper, for sure. :)

Best chocolate frosting I've had in a while! Great thick texture and not overly sweet. I added a pinch of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of instant espresso powder to deepen the chocolate taste. I recommend gradually adding the powdered sugar and tasting until it gets to the right consistency/sweetness.

This frosting doesn't last long...a few days on the cake out of the fridge MAX but it is absolutely worth making.  This is the BEST frosting I have ever made.  Better than store bought!!!!!

This was great! I used a combination of semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips and only used 1 cup of sugar. Will definitely use again when I need a chocolate frosting. Thanks!

Really like the tangy flavor the sour cream gives this frosting.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect for a 2-layer 9" cake.  Delicious!

Great recipe, but if you add the suggested amount of sugar, I think it starts to lose some of the "uniquness" that the sour cream adds, and it starts to taste more like the usual sugar/milk/butter frosting. I added less than a cup of sugar and it was pretty good.

Excellent!!! This recipe is no fail and tastes good with anything. Very fugdy but not too sweet. I've even used it to make chocolate covered strawberries. I drop 3/4 c. confectioner's sugar and it's perfect.

Very easy recipe. I melted the butter and chocalte together in the microwave. I also cut back on the confectioner's sugar. I used 2 1/4 cups and I probably could have used just 2 cups. I topped the Flourless Chocolate Cake (found on this website) with this frosting and it was devine.

Excellent recipe!  Not too sweet, very chocolatey.  I think I over beat the frosting and it was a little too thick, so I just put it in the microwave for about 20 seconds, and it loosened right up.  It set perfectly after that.  Great!

Used 3T cocoa powder and 3T special dark cocoa powder.  Decreased powdered sugar but then it was too runny.  Added a half package of special dark instant chocolate pudding to thicken up.  SUPER FUDGY.  Yum!

I used a 70% cacao chocolate bar that I grated, and melted with my butter, and I used baker's sugar with tapioca as a corn free version of this frosting. It was slightly grainy, but it had a decadent taste that was perfect with the "Dinette Cake" recipe elsewhere on this site. I put fresh raspberries on top of my old fashioned white cake with sour cream and dark chocolate frosting. My guests raved over the retro 1950's taste.

This is my favourite chocolate frosting recipe, I don't like basic buttercreams as they are too rich and a little greasy to me but this one is nice enough to eat with a spoon.  The chocolate I used had 72% cocoa solids (I chopped up a bar) and I just added the sugar bit by bit until I liked the consistency and taste so this recipe wasn't too sweet for me.  If I had to guess I'd say I used about half of the amount of powdered sugar.  This one is a keeper in my books.

This indeed the best chocolate filling i had ever taste, it is balanced, and you even can adjust the sweetness by sugar and chocolate ( you might use dark chocolate for bitter, richer taste)

I have used this reciepe for my baby 1st birthday cake, but used it as a filling only and it was awesome !

This is a fantastic and flexible frosting recipe. This pairs perfectly with lighter cakes and cupcakes such as German chocolate. It is a bit heavier and sweeter as stated.   The second time I added dark chocolate about 2 ounces and reduced the powdered sugar to 2 cups. It was excellent on buttermilk yellow cupcakes with a more chocolatey flavor  The sour cream keeps the frosting from getting crusty. Holds well for a few days. Fantastic

I had high hopes for this frosting, and while it is beautiful - I found it far too sweet and it tasted pretty much like chocolate chips with powdered sugar to me.  Perhaps with some modifications I'd like it more, but if I do try it again, I'm likely to use cocoa or bakers chocolate instead.

Delicious, creamy chocolate frosting.  It was the perfect topping for" Kristin's Fudgy Brownies" on this site.  This made more than I needed for a 13 x 9 pan so I used the extra frosting between graham cracker squares.  Yum!  Thanks Mary Beth for sharing your frosting recipe.

I used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips and slightly less than two cups of powdered sugar, which I did sift first.  Ended up with a delicious, satiny frosting.

Very easy. An extremely smooth texture, easy to spread and very chocolatey. I made it exactly as directed with great success. Next time I'm thinking of "tweeking" it toward the Mocha side with powdered coffee granules. Not sure it will work well, but I'm going to try it.

Delicious! Like others I used less sugar, probably about 2 cups. Sooooo good on the chocolate cupcakes I made. I will definitely be using this again and again for birthday cakes.

This frosting was unbelievable!  The recipe yielded enough frosting to fill and frost a 9X13 cake cut in  half and stacked  into two layers.  I was pleasantly surprised at how nicely it firmed up, in the fridge,  while remaining creamy.    We could not stop eating it.  I even  substituted fat free sour cream to lighten it up a little.

For taste, it would get a 5, consistency 3.  Im having a hard time finding a good tasting, easily spread (for decorators) frosting.

This recipe as written is great for people who like "bakery" style buttercreams that are crazy sweet. We don't, so like another reviewer I used about 1/2 - 2/3 the sugar called for, and used 3/4 cup semisweet and 1/4 cup UNSWEETENED chocolate. Made the richest, most delicious frosting! Thanks for the inspiration!

I just made this frosting in my Kitchen Aid and it turned out great!  I didn't need to use as much sugar as the recipe called for and I had to thin it out with a little half n half.  I love how velvety and chocolatey it is with that bite of sour cream.  Yum.

Absolutely exquisit. I followed the recipe to a T until it came to the powdered sugar, I may have not even used half as much as it said, and sifted it a little at a time then blended it. The result was the perfect texture and thickness, that tasted like heaven on a spoon!! :) Thank you SOOOOO much for this recipe,  it's the best part of the cake I made.

Easily the most sophisticated chocolate frosting recipe out there. I do add 2 oz of unsweetened chocolate and double the recipe (which will then make enough for a 3 layer cake). So addictive!

This did not work out for me at all. It looked delicious but the flavor was off. I read in other reviews that the taste was too "tangy" and I have to agree. My husband didn't care for it either and is off to the grocery store to buy a can of frosting.

Super good! I didn't use as much sugar as stated, but rather just went by consistency. My only thought was if I should refrigerate since it uses sour cream? Otherwise, beautiful and delicious.

Smooth and creamy, very easy to spread on your cake. As another reviewer pointed out not as chocolately as I would like. So I just added some Hershey's Baking Cocoa in at the end and beat it in. Made it more chocolate tasting like we like. About 1-2 Tbs. Sorry I didn't measure, just eyeballed it's color for measure. Very good. Will definitely use this one again.

Very good frosting. It had a very smooth creamy texture which was nice, but the chocolate seemed a little on the mild side for me so maybe I would use some more chocolate the next time I make this. I also added a little bit of cinnamon to the frosting which complemented the flavour very well.

Awesome recipe. I did make some modifications based on reviews that it was too sweet. I used 3oz. each of semi-sweet chocolate squares & unsweetened squares. My family has many chocoholics. And only 1 3/4 cup sugar. This really dresses up a $1 box of brownies with plenty left over for something else.

I wasn't too keen on the flavor of this.  It certainly was creamy, but although I expected to like the tang from the sour cream, it just wasn't my thing.  It seemed like it needed a lot of sugar to compensate for the tang, and in the end the sweetness level was too high, and there was still a sour aftertaste that I didn't care for.  Nobody said anything about the frosting, and my family usually pipes up when something is particularly good.  I'll probably just stick to buttercream.

Very disappointing. The consistancy was too thick even after adding more liquid ingredients. It was like spackle. We had to scrape it off the cake in order to make it salvageable.

I made this last night as frosting for a Boston cream cake. I made it with plain yogurt instead, as others had suggested and cut way back on the confectioners sugar too. I found it to be a little tart so next time I will try the recipe exactly as written instead. As a note for others trying this recipe, the amount of confectioners sugar used will also be reflected in the consistency of your frosting - because I had used less sugar, when the frosting cooled it also hardened making it more difficult and messy to cut thru.

Sorry to say, but I was disappointed with this frosting. It just wasn't the flavor I was going for. I only used two cups of the sugar and it was plenty sweet enough. Another 3/4 cup of sugar would have been WAY too sweet. It didn't have enough tang so I added a little bit of cream cheese and that improved it a little. The chocolate chip flavor just overwhelmed everything. Maybe I would like it better if I used cocoa powder instead to get the chocolate flavor without the obvious chocolate chip flavor. All in all, not terrible, but not great.

Very good. Not greasy like buttercream. I will experiment with chip flavors to get it just right.

Excellent! The sour cream cuts the sweetness of the sugar, and if you use less sugar it gives it a tangy taste (which is nice, depending on what you are frosting). It has a nice, spreadable texture that doesn't dry out too fast.

WOW! How wonderful and easy is this?!?! It's fantasticly perfect! Also, what I enjoyed about it is that I perfer icings that are have more of a dark chocolate taste. All you have to do to this wonderful icing is add powered baking cocoa until you get the taste you desire. If you like milk chocolate, you would just leave it as it.... It's perfect!

Very easy recipe and it tastes great. After mixing the batter for a homemade cake, I hate to make frosting but this one is so easy and is ready to use... not like ganache which you to wait until it is the right consistency.

Absolutely delicious! Since I was out of icing sugar, I ground up plain white sugar in my coffee grinder and the result was delicious confectioner's-type sugar with a coffee taste. The frosting was tangy and sweet and mocha-flavored. I'll definitely be making this again!

I love this recipe with the following adjustements -- it's not too sweet and not too fattening! Used 70% chocolate, added 2 tbsp dutch process cocoa after chocolate and butter were melted. Reduced sugar to 2 cups. I made 1.5 recipes for a 3 layer 8" round cake.

I made it to frost a chocolate swirl cake for my son's third birthday.  It was a huge hit!  It's very rich, and makes the cake go further than an odinary frosting. I got rave reviews from everyone there!  Thanks for the great recipe.

When I first made this, I thought it was a bit too sweet. But the next day, it seemed to have mellowed a bit! If I make again, I will decrease the sugar. Other than that, it was extremely easy to make and had a nice creamy texture

simple and what I like the most is the color and the texture. I followed some advised from the reviews as I used only 2 cups of sugar and I replaced the Vanilla with KAHLUA (I used 1 tbs). I also used I CANT BELIEVE IS NOT BUTTER instead of real butter. to be honest i like it and it break the calories in half :). thanks for this recipe. it's definetely a keeper.

I used this frosting on Lisa's Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cake for my son's birthday.  The cake really didn't need frosting, but my son loves frosting so I chose this recipe.  To be honest, I don't normally care for frosting but this recipe is divine!  The sour cream is wonderful and I was pleased that the frosting wasn't overly sweet. I only used about 2 1/4 c. confectioner's sugar.  Thanks for sharing Mary Beth!

Great easy recipe.  I had to use milk chocolate chips and it came out great.  I also added a bit of cinnamon and slight hint of cayenne.  I can't wait to try it as written!  I should have skipped the salt though since it did not really disolve (I used kosher...dumb idea).

This is quick and easy!  It is a little after 9:30pm on a Friday night and my girls wanted cake!!!  So I whipped up a vanilla box mix and needed an easy frosting.  
   I substituted Hersheys milk choc. candy bars (left over from Easter), chopped to equal 1 cup.  It gave it a rich milk choc. flavor.  I used a different mixing method; mix 1.5 C. Powdered sugar w/ s. cream + vanilla. Then add melted choc./butter mix (not cooled) and continue to add p. sugar until desired consistancy.  It is creamy smooth, easy to spread and has great flavor! Thanks

This frosting was delicious, and easy to make.  I substituted a bar of my favorite semi-sweet chocolate (chopped up) that I had on hand for the chocolate chips, and it worked beautifully.  I will make this again, next time I need frosting for a cake, or cupcakes.

I usually make chocolate cream cheese frosting but didn’t have any cream cheese on hand.  I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I wasn’t disappointed!  It has a very similar tang to cream cheese icing.  I don’t like a very sweet icing, so I added the sugar is small batches until the sweetness was to my liking.  I also sifted in a couple of tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa to boost the chocolate flavour.  This is a great frosting for spreading (not for piping).  I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe needs a lot of changes... it’s way to sweet. I had a delicious cake made and I put this stuff on it and it totally was ruined

I used recommendations in the comments. I substituted unsweetened baking chocolate and added 2T dark coffee. Far less sweet that way with a great chocolate flavor. The sour cream gives it a great flavor sensation for those who enjoy trying new flavor combinations. Easy texture to ice the cake. Pretty cake without even trying very hard.

I made it just like the recipe said but after tasting it decided to add more melted butter/chocolate because it was too sugary for my taste.

Delicious! I did make the following changes: used bittersweet chocolate chips, added 2 oz of unsweetened chocolate, decreased sugar to 2 cups. Wonderful!

This might be my favorite chocolate frosting. It's not overly sweet and the sour cream adds just the right touch of tanginess to make it interesting. I also appreciate how quickly it comes together. I follow the recipe exactly.

I got a lot of compliments on this frosting.  I, however,  am not a big fan of sour cream frosting and didn't think about it until I tasted it.  It definitely makes it tangy.  With that said, I am a buttercream frosting fan but this frosting really added a richness to the whole cake.

I doubled the recipe- sort of. Instead of melting the chocolate chips, I used cocoa powder. Then I cut back on the powdered sugar, simply adding it until I had the consistency I wanted. I received many compliments!

Needed a vanilla sour cream frosting, so prepared this recipe without the chocolate.  I also halved the recipe, because I only had half a batch of cupcakes to frost, and made it non-dairy by using Earth Balance instead of butter and Tofutti sour cream.  After the liquid ingredients I added the powdered sugar until it was the consistency I wanted.  Awesome taste, perfect consistency and addition to the cupcakes!

I really liked this frosting. The texture and taste was wonderful!
I made a white layer cake and used this fronting in between layers and used a Vanilla Buttercream for the top and sides. Delish! I will use again and again.  Thanks for sharing

I made this to put on the one-bowl chocolate cake, and it was delicious! I added a little bit of espresso (about half of an espresso), which made it more rich. I did find though that I had trouble getting it to the consistency I wanted without having to add half a bag of icing sugar, so I alternated with a bit of flour too. Would make again.

I've made this frosting twice. The first time, I made it exactly as directed, and it turned out perfectly. The second time, I decided to melt a square of unsweetened chocolate with the chocolate chips to kick up the chocolate a notch, and it was even better.  I also made 1 1/2 times the recipe so I could dirty-ice the cakes first.

Some reviewers complained the icing was too thick. I didn't have this issue, nor did I have trouble beating in all the confectioners sugar. This frosting does get thicker the longer it stands. I dirty-iced the cake when the frosting was thinner and then finished it with the thickened frosting. Also, don't chill the butter-chocolate mixture; it only needs to be a room temp before adding the sour cream. Finally, don't use an electric mixer: it incorporates air and cools the frosting too fast. 

I admit, I don't understand how anyone thinks a frosting is "too sweet." It's largely sugar and butter, and frosting by definition is SWEET. If you prefer desserts that aren't very sweet, serve fruit and cheese, or maybe a plain pound cake.  

This is an easy recipe for a thick, rich, chocolatey frosting with a subtle tang. It's my new go-to recipe for frosting. Superb!

Very creamy.  Not TOO sweet.  Have to put it in the fridge to solidify the icing after it is put on the cake.  Other than that very good.

Tastes amazing!!! 

I melted the chocolate chips and butter in the microwave and then once cooled, put together the rest.  Not too sweet in spite of the fact that there's so much sugar... must be because of the sour cream.  The frosting spread nicely and didn't 'drip'.

Taste awesome...the wat I made it. After reading several reviews before attempting I saw success in my future. I wanted a very rich and deep chocolatey taste so I did this: 1 stick of butter, 1 cup of sour cream, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and 2, 2 oz. bars of unsweetened chocolate...mmmm mmmm.

I did not care for this recipe. The frosting tasted more like powdered sugar than the creamy chocolate flavor I was hoping for. It was also too loose and made icing the cake very difficult.

This soooo good! Tastes just my normal chocolate frosting with a bit of extra tang. We spread this over the chocolate cake recipe from the back of the Swan's Down cake flour box. Instant emergency chocolate fix!

I made this recipe EXACTLY as it said.  It wasn't too sweet, the consistency was perfect and It spread nicely.  The only thing different is it is a much darker 'looking' frosting than this picture shows.  I think the sour cream gave it a nice gleam, texture and it definitely wasn't as chocolate tasting as a recipe without sour cream.

I just made this and have to say it is very easy to make. Very creamy. I liked it, but didn't love it. I guess I wasn't expecting the tanginess from the sour cream to stand out so much. But is was a nice change and may make it again.

Pretty darn good!  Made it with "Crazy Cake" and the two together were a hit.  Only four stars because I could do with more tang, and I had to fiddle a bit to get a consistency I could decorate with (added milk).

Rich and creamy with a little tang.  I like the depth of flavor the sour cream adds - not just all sugar flavor.  I made for a batch of yellow cake cupcakes and it was perfect.  Because not everyone likes the tanginess of a sour cream frosting, I added little bits of bacon to match with the flavor.  Perfect combo.

Easy and goes perfectly with my hot pepper brownies! Was afraid of consistancy at first but after a few minutes it cooled more and set up nicely. Was able to pipe. Everyone asked for the recipe!

I live in bush Alaska where a can of frosting is nearly $10.  This recipe is wonderful.  For a deeper chocolate flavor I added 2 tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder.  I made a white frosting, using white chips and it was outstanding.  I added a 1/4 tsp orange extract and reduce vanilla to 3/4 tsp.  

I did reduce the powdered sugar by 3/4 cup when I was frosting a cake but found a needed a stiffer frosting for cupcakes and used the full amount.  It held its shape for a long time.

This is now a favorite in Stebbins, Alaska.

This was o.k.  It was too loose to pipe.  The flavor was very sweet and a little odd (not chocolate or sour cream, but a weird in between taste).

This frosting was absolutely delicious!  The only thing I changed was I added an additional 1/2 ounce of unsweetened chocolate to give it just a little boost of extra chocolate flavor.  It's so smooth and silky.  It was a perfect compliment to the cake.

I read all the reviews and was going to cut back on the sugar, but I'm glad I didn't. Not sure why you would cut back, I didn't find it to be that sweet at all - still much less sweeter than store bought frosting-in-the-jar type stuff. The biggest problem I had with this is that it was too thin, and didn't make enough to cover a regular double layer (two 9" rounds) cake. I made extra right off the bat and I'm glad I did. I wasn't really impressed with this at all, and btw, I didn't taste any hints of sour cream at all. I'd have to say go find another recipe if you're looking for a really good frosting.... Three stars for flavor, but I'd give it two for the thin consistency.

This made an amazing frosting.  I added a bit of cocoa to the mix and used a little less sour cream.  The consistency was creamy and yet it actually piped well on the cupcakes.  I use sweet cream butter, it holds up better.

Imade this cake with and without the. Chocolate chips, and both ways were delicious.  I also made it in a cup cake form, and I think it was too oily for that, as the holders for the cake were very greasy for the kids to handle.

Perfect! I followed the directions and ingredients exactly and it came out so delicious, smooth and silky. As for those who had a problem with it being "gritty", maybe try using a rubber spatula to mix it like I did. Adding the powdered sugar gradually as directed, I kept smacking the #$@% out of it until it was smooth before adding more. I will use this recipe again, just as it is, PERFECT!

I revised the recipe to include a little heavy cream and then added some extra powdered sugar -- beating with a mixer until it was the right consistency for frosting.  The flavor was good.  I added one tbls. of cocoa powder when I melted the butter and chocolate chips together.  Next time I might add 2 tbls. of cocoa powder to boost the chocolate flavor a little more.  With my changes, I had enough frosting to GENEROUSLY frost 24 cupcakes.

This is a good basic frosting recipe. I did cut back on the powdered sugar as suggested by others, but I think I cut back to far. I put this on a dark chocolate box cake and while it did have the "tang" I should have added just a touch more sugar, but still good flavor. I did sift the sugar. Nice consistency. Will make it again.

i didn't really measure anything except the butter...and it's because sticks of butter say where to cut for each tablespoon. :)     i know i didn't have enough confectioners sugar.  i melted 1/3 cup sugar w/ the butter and chocolate (again...i used left over chocolates given to me from friends for xmas...it's what i had lol)    but the jist??? sour cream+chocolate=frosting recipe= FABULOUS!!!    i knew by using darker chocolate would make the frosting set up, if chilled, so thankfullly the laws of science and chemestry still hold up in everyday kitchens. :) :) thanks for the recipe!!

This frosting is easy to make and very spreadable. It is not too sweet which is how I prefer frosting. I put it on the "magic chocolate" cake from this site.  Got raves from everyone in my family.

I like it! However, I didn't even need to use that much sugar (it's atrocious). I used 1/4 cups sugar and it tasted perfect and tangy.

Delicious.  It tasted different freshly made than it did after being in the fridge.  Not sure how much the sour cream added to the flavour.

The recipe is great. Supurb is more like it.  The frosting was a little bitter so either reduce the amount of chocolate or add sugar. I used cocoa powder instead of solid chocolate, but it turned out fust the same.

Great recipe! I needed a last minute frosting and happened to have all of these ingredients on hand so I gave it a try and I think it is better than the store frosting. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I actually found the frosting to be a little bitter for my taste (fine if that's what you are going for) so I added a little extra white sugar to add some sweetness. It tasted more like an icing which went great with the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe on this site. Thanks!!

Excellent!!!  Perfect amount of everything, but I added an extra tsp. of Vanilla.  I used this to frost sour cream sugar cookies - YUMMMMM!  If you want to cut down the bitterness of the chocolate, you can substitute 1/2 the chips for milk chocolate chips.

Tasty, fudgy frosting.  I only used 1 1/4 cups of powdered sugar and it was fine, but you could keep adding....... Easy to spread and looks lovely.  Easy to make, too.

I used this frosting on an orange cake, and it was simply delicious.  For my tastes, however, I found the sourcream a bit too tart, so I might have slightly decreased it.  To others, however, it might be perfect.  All in all, this is an easy and great recipe, which I will use again.  Thank you.

An ok icing.  It used way too much powdered sugar (almost like fudge if you use it all).  A little too sweet for our tastes.  I used mint chocolate chips on top of the "Chocolate Cupcakes" from this site.

I made this frosting for my birthday cake for the first time and it was a huge hit! The consistency was perfect and was not too sweet. I've tried a lot of other recipes and this is by far the best chocolate frosting!

very good icing.  very stiff when cools if put in a lot of conf. sugar.  i would suggest using unsweetened bakers chocolate rather than using chips.  i like things very chocolaty and that would have made it more so.

This did not taste tangy like sour cream at all to me and I think it was too thick to spread so I thinnned it out a little bit and I actually used a ton more sugar to make it bigger.  It was ok though and it held up.

This was delicious. I used it on top of golden butter cupcakes. I only used 1 3/8 cups of sugar and it was perfect for my taste. The consistency was great as well. Loved the little kick of sour cream. Will definitely be making it again!

Really good!!  It was easy to spread and there was enough for a 9" cake.  I had to substitute dark chocolate raspberry chips, so I sifted in 2 tbls cocoa with the powdered sugar.  I also substituted almond extract for the vanilla.

I made this for some cupcakes and my officemates loved them! One of them actually took home the extra frosting and spread it on bread. It's not too sweet, and the sour cream left a tangy taste that nobody could put their finger on. Will definitely be making it again the next time I whip up a batch of cupcakes.

A couple of mods:  LITE sour cream.  More salt, an extra splash of Mexican Vanilla, and a pinch of cinnamon.  (Didn't measure the sugar).  At first, when I tried it alone (I admit, I'm a dipper and taster), I didn't dig this at all.  I thought it was just weird at best.  Until I topped my BANANA CAKE VIII cupcakes with this.  WOW!  A wonderful complement to the cupcakes.

Just not a fan. Easy enough to make but to me, frosting should be sweet not tangy. If you are hestitant about making this, trust your gut and try a different recipe.

At first I thought maybe it just needed to set a bit, but I still didn't like it after that. To me it tasted like semi-sweet chocolate chips with a little tang to it. I guess I should of figured that with what the ingredients are, but I was expecting more of a creamy chocolate flavor. It did have a good texture/consistency to it though. Will not be making it again.

perfect! fantastic on a white cake and on cupcakes.  We made it with powdered sugar the first time and it was grainy.  Make sure you use confectioner's sugar, the finest you can find, or just sift it and add gradaully. This is now the household favorite chocolate frosting!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I thought this frosting had a DELICIOUS flavor! It did get a little thick, but that was easily fixed. I did not use as much sugar as called for. I'm using the frosting for chocolate cupcakes, topped with Andes mint baking bits. I love the sweet chocolately flavor. THANK YOU

This frosting was pretty good. I added an extra spoonful of sour cream, a little extra salt, and the full amount of sugar. It did seem a bit runny to me but set up nicely on my cake.

I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and still thought this frosting was way too sweet. Not at all what I was hoping for.

Fabulous Frosting, decreased the conf. sugar to 2 cups like recommended in other reviews.I think it may of needed the other 3/4 Cup. Next time I will use the 2 3/4  Cup of conf. sugar.

Great, easy recipe! Used light sour cream. Warm the icing up for a few seconds in the microwave to get the right consistency for cup-cake dipping.

This recipe is just was I was looking for. It reminds me a lot of an icing my grandmother used to make; although the sour cream gives it a deeper flavor. Like other users, I decreased the sugar to 2 cups and it was perfect. I will definately top my cakes with this frosting in the future.

Very very good frosting! The sour cream is a nice mix with the sweetness. I did as other reviewers suggested and cut the powdered sugar to 2 cups. Will make again often! Thanks!

Very easy to make and it tastes great too.  I played it by ear and added whatever I felt that it needed, but this was a great base to begin from.  The sour cream is a nice touch.  Thanks for sharing.

Very rich and chocolatey.  I'd use this again, especially on a cake that you wanted to bring out the chocolate flavour in.  Yum!

This turned out great! I used only about 2 cups of icing sugar. I didn't have any choc. chips, so I used 4 squares of unsweetened bakers chocolate. Great!!! I used this on a oatmeal cake.
