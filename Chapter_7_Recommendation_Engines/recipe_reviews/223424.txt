It's no wonder I like these. Outside of rolling the balls of dough in sugar before baking, this is exactly the same recipe as "Easy Sugar Cookies," also from this site - and I am very fond of that recipe. These cookies are simply the best, and so easy to mix up I had a half recipe done in about the same time it took Hubs to shower and dress!  And that included frosting them with "Sugar Cookie Icing," that recipe from this site as well.  The cookies are soft yet chewy, with a nice, buttery flavor.  Frosted or not, these are a good pick.

Love this recipe because doesn't require shopping - lots of sugar cookie recipes call for cream of tartar or sour cream, which I don't have in the house regularly.  Easy and quick.

Super easy, delicious, sweet and fluffy.
Perfect for a spur-of-the-moment urge to make cookies.
Tina, maybe the problems you had were due to over-beating the batter, making the cookies too small, or having your oven too hot?
Who knows? All I know is that I followed the directions and my cookies came out picture and palate perfect!

I didn't make any changes, It was good with tea. But I expected it to be a little less dry. I mean I checked them in the oven every 2 minutes they were uncooked but suddenly in just a moment they got really dry. plus I will reduce the amount of sugar next time I know they are sugar cookies but they were too sweet

I thought the moisture balance was way off.  I followed the recipe to the letter and the dough turned out the texture of dry sandy clay and I had to squeeze each dough ball really hard to get it to hold together.  To be fair, my oven is a little cold so I may have left them in too long, but they didn't spread at all while they were baking and came out more like tea cookies than sugar cookies. But it's hard to go wrong with sugar and butter so they taste fine.  I would just maybe put in half the flour, and then add really slowly.  Overall, meh.

Cooking Club used this recipe as an example of cooking with basic kitchen "staples". The children LOVED it! They had fun mixing all the ingredients. Waiting the 10 minutes for the cookies to cook and cool was WORTH it, for the enjoyment of EATING them!!!  This quick TASTY recipe will become a "staple" in my kitchen! Thanks!

this is by far the best sugar cookie I have ever had! I substituted pure lemon extract for the vanilla, such a fresh taste. soft, light, a new favorite! I used self rising flour and  I didn't roll the cookie in sugar, only dropped it in the sugar so that the sugar was only on the top, I added red sugar to the white sugar for eye appeal!

Only made a few substitutions. I used almond extract rather than the vanilla, they still turned out great. The only complaint was they got a bit hard.

This recipe was perfect for a quick "Santa"  cookie. I added red and green sugar crystals to the batter instead of rolling the balls into white sugar. They came out perfect.  And super easy.

These turned out well for me. I formed dough balls about an inch around. They had to cook a few minutes longer than 9 mins. More like 12 for me.

I have made this recipe a few times and everytime it comes out perfect.  This was the first recipe I have used for sugar cookies.  Actually the first time I ever made sugar cookies from scratch.  The only thing I added (because I do this to everything sweet) was a dash of vanilla.

The recipe turned out great. I did have to use margarine and egg substitute, but it all turned out okay in the end. So far my family loves it and I’ll be sure to use it in the future.

I made this because it uses ingredients that I remember from making these as a child.   Was fabulous!  This is the cookie recipe I will be using from now on.  Only change was that I didn’t add the last 1/4 cup of flour.

Delicious cookies.  Made them for 8 kids during a playdate/sleepover and everyone really liked them.  I baked my first batch for 10 mins and my last one for 12.  I also used a 1:1 gluten free flour, and ended up having to replace the vanilla extract with maple syrup, again 1:1.  They were great!  I dusted with sugar afterwards too, I just like them better that way.  :):)  -Zoe

It’s my first time sugar cooking baking and I found this recipe very easy to follow. All the reviews helped too. I did lower the temp to 350 and bake for 10 min. They turn out great. It is more on the softer side which is perfect for us. I also roll the dough out and let my kids use a cookie cutter on it. Which they loved. Overall I will make it again. I added an image to the group.

I was looking for a sugar cookie recipe that didn't call for cream of tartar or shortening.  I came across this one and found I had everything on hand to make it.  I followed the measurements and ingredients exactly.  I have a gas oven and I gave mine 3 more minutes to cook so that tops were cracked.  Loved them.

It took like 20 minutes to cook, which is a down side, it was probably MY oven, but once it was done, it was tasty. I hope my family likes it too.

This recipe turned out dreadful because of one mistake. I would suggest at least doubling the amount of sugar in the dough. Other than that it was amazing! Just won't make it again without adding extra sugar for sure. Would be five stars without that problem.

My niece made these all by herself, she is 9 and she said they were very easy to make, turned out very well and had a great time making them. The only thing is they got very hard the next day and we had to dip them in milk just to be able to eat them.

I liked that we had all the ingredients and they were very easy to make.  However, mine came out pretty hard on the outside.  The inside is nice and tastes great but the outside is a bit of a bummer. I read the other reviews and will try a 350 degree oven next time.

Ok, made it twice. The key issues just like people were saying is the butter needing to be very soft or the batter comes out crumbly. They were good but here's how they were great. Make sure the butter is very soft, use 2 top of pure vanilla, I used 2 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, And oven on 350 for 8 mins. I used the little red sugar crystals and they were yummy. On the 2nd batch I made them into snicker doodles. Yummy. Good, quick and easy recipe.

I made this recipe and decided to split the batch into thirds. The first I added orange flavoring  to. the second I added an almond flavor and the last part of the batch I did not modify. I found that the orange flavor didn't work for me and although I liked the original recipe it was nothing all that special.  But the almond batch was wonderful. I will make these cookies with almonds every time. All I did was follow the original recipe and add a teaspoon (remembering that this was a third of the batch) of almond extract and just about a 1/4 cup of sliced almonds to the batter. I baked them according to the recipe. They were awesome!  I rated this recipe according to the modified version.

Sorry for the bad rating! I'm not actually a bad cook, but I guess I wasn't focused enough while making this recipe. The dough came out all crumbly, though it clumped quite nicely. Did I miss something important?? The cookies didn't turn into cookie shapes. They were balls. Crumbly balls of cookie dough. Goodies. My only explanation is that I didn't soften the butter first and therefore messed up my cookies. 
These certainly TASTE delicious though!
(I think I'll try a different recipe next time...)

turned out great! had to add about 1/3 cup more of butter to make the dough less dry, but turned out delicious!

My friend and I made these "cookies" They turned into flat, burned to a crisp piece of sugar. We unfortunately did not get a chance to taste them, although we are sure that we followed the recipe exactly.
