I had this dish in Northern Peru a few years ago and it was amazing. A few of changes I made were using Ayi Amarillo paste, cilantro paste, half the amount of beef broth and more oil. Serve with canary beans (made to your liking) and white rice.

My review is based off of the lamb only. I had another side dish planned to go with the lamb so I did not use the potatoes and peas. My lamb pieces were small so I was unable to cook it long enough to let the sauce thicken but the flavor was excellent and turned out super tender! I wanted some extra texture to serve on top of my lamb pieces so I made the parsley vinegar sauce from Chef John's Roasted Lamb Breast recipe from this site. Like other reviewers I was able to find the pepper in paste form and it was delicious! Expensive but delicious. Lamb cuts are not easy to find in my area and it is expensive when I do find it. That is a shame because I could make this recipe every single week. It was really that good. Very impressive! Thanks for sharing!

Made this recipe with 24 lamb shanks for wine & dine group and they loved it! Followed the recipe (omitted potatoes) and proportions, using 5X the other ingredients. Also added a jar of Aji Amarillo paste and cilantro paste as another reviewer suggested. Made a day in advance then reheated. Lamb was falling off the bones, rich and wonderful! Served the shanks on a platter and poured the sauce and peas from the pans into a bowl with ladel. Garnished with fresh cilantro springs and served with Brazilian-style rice. Excellent! Would definitely do again!

Less time in oven. I only needed the 2 hours for some reason.
