these were good. I didnt put in the OXO cube or worstershire sauce and it turned out very well.
I added a clove of garlic and coated both sides of the cake with corn meal instead of corn flakes.
Very crispy and yummy

My family loved these! I did make some changes. Because some of us aren't crazy about seafood, I used about 6 oz. imitation crab and 6 oz. cooked chicken breast instead of all crab. The "crab" cakes still had a mild crab flavor, but not strong enough to turn off the rest of the family!

i have never made crab cakes before so i basically followed the directions. i also added chopped celery to the crab. i thought the bouillon cube made it too salty, next time, i would eliminate the chicken bouillon entirely, you can add salt later .

I loved these!  My fiance (who can't read directions :-D) added the cornflake mixture to the crab mixture, instead of just using it for coating, but it turned out great regardless - just a little hard to flip in the pan!  I served them on toasted hamburger buns with lettuce and tartar sauce - great!  Will definately be making these again!
