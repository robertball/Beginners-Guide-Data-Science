this was very good, and quick as a flash to make!  I used canned whole italian peppers so used that method of prep.  Used 2XL  cloves of garlic and fresh basil from windowbox.  The fresh basil makes this.  Used 2 different kinds of fish:  tilapia and cod so did them in seperate pans due to the difference in thickness.  I think I liked the flavor blend with the cod a touch better.  Since serving pasta tomorrow night, just will make a salad for DH to go with this.  Would present well as written with polenta cake added to plate.  Very nice midweek meal for those on the go that want a homecooked meal without the fuss.  The best part of it is:  I tasted the fish poaching lemon water and don't throw it away!!!  I plan on freezing it in individual ice cube trays; it's a great little fish stock to add to a soup!  Do add salt if not restricted; as written I think would be a tad too bland.  Used balsamic vinegar in place of red wine for its' mild acidity and sweetness.  Would add 1 more clove of garlic next time.  Any extra sauce will be added to the next batch of spaghetti sauce.

This was really great! I used some cheap tilapia fillets and served it with steamed broccoli & shrimp cakes. I dont think I have had anything so packed with flavor in a while!

This was fantastic.  I used fresh diced red peppers and added a 1/4 cup water so that they would cook without drying the dish.  What a great taste - thank you.
