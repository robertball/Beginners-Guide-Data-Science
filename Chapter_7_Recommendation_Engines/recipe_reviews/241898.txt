Like HappyGenny said, it is somewhat daunting, but worth the effort.  I too used a Slow Cooker over night and then transferred it into a large stock pot in the a.m..  Worked OK but keep in mind your proportions. I somehow lost track of how much water was needed and had to guess at the time of transfer during the shuffle.
Also, I found neck bones (beef) at my local grocer, Market Basket for you New Englanders.  I even tried my favorite butcher (40 mile drive) and he said he was having trouble getting any type of bones. Everyone is watching Chef John and getting ideas....

This is so good. Well worth the time. I can quickly make a pan sauce for chicken, beef, pork or veal from this. It lasted about 8 months. Time to make more!!

Chef John is hysterical and fun! great directions in a playful way. First time making Demi-Glace and turned out great with beef bones - will; try the "cheaters" version next.

This classic is truly breathtaking, although the time involved is daunting for most cooks.  I can't leave a pot on for 18 hours (who wants to leave the house with a burner on?), so I  now simmer mine in a slow cooker instead. Not as perfect, but if it means you actually MAKE it, then it can be forgiven. Veal bones can also be very hard to find. If you must, use large beef bones. No, it won't be the same, but, as I said, if it's a choice between compromising or not doing it....
