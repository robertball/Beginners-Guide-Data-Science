This was excellent! I thought for sure I would end up saying it needed some herbs but it  was perfect as written. I did make two small changes based off of what I had on hand. I used russet potatoes instead of yukon and frozen peas instead of frozen corn. Peas work great too so when I make this again I'll use 1 cup of peas and 1 cup of corn for an even more colorful bowl. Thanks for the super simple flavorful soup!
