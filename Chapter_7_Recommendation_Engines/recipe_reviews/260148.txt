This recipe was amazing, although I didnâ€™t have green peppers, I substituted with roasted red peppers. Added 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter to my pan before adding the sour cream mixture.  Beautiful, silky sauce.  Will make again.

Followed the recipe exactly with except I didn't have celery and I cooked the bacon in the microwave then added it to the pot. It was creamy and delicious and my guests loved it. A good amount for 4-5 people. 10/10

Loved it!  My mom, 96, absolutely raved about it.  I put it over Brown rice (out of noodles) and was really tasty.    Will definitely make it again.

I did not put in the pepper slices as my husband does not like peppers. This is like the recipe my Mom used to make and the gravy is perfect over mashed potatoes.
