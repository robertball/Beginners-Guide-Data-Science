Fantastic filling.  It gets a little cumbersome stirring it, but it's worth it in the end.  I omitted the cherries and raisins and used it with a boxed lemon cake.  It was outstanding!

It was alright, but not great.  I also tried replacing the burbon with rum extract.  DON'T DO THAT!  It was AWFUL!  And that's coming from someone who likes rum!

I must of done something wrong. The sauce never thickened, I stirred and stirred for at least half an hour in the end I decided to add some cornstarch but still stayed a bit runny I did not want to add too much of it. After it cooled the color changed from creamy to brown buttery like. I used it anyway because I found the taste pretty good. I dont think I will try this again, too much work for poor results unless someone explains what I did wrong.
