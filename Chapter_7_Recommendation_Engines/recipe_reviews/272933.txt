Used two cups each of strawberries and blueberries.  A wonderful treat to have around.

I made it with blackberries instead.  Came out fantastic.  I suggest mixing the berries, sugar etc in a large mixing bowl and mixing well by hand first before placing in the 9"xs13' baking dish.  4 cups of berries amounts to about 24 ounces of packaged berries, and to make three cups of chopped rhubarb, you need three large stalks of rhubarb cut into small pieces.  I increased the baking time to 45 minutes as I live at 6040 feet in Albuquerque.
