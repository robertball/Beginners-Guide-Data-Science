These are pretty good bars.  I used Kahula for the top layer instead of the orange liqueur. (I know - kind of defeats the purpose of B-52 bars). In each layer, I added a little more liqueur than called for. The top layer was good, the middle layer was incredible, but the bottom layer was just ok. It wasn't quite sweet enough. If I make again, I think I would add more sugar to that layer, or maybe try icing sugar instead.

I had to increase the Irish cream to 1/2 cup in order to moisten all of the icing sugar, and I found the top layer to be a little thick.  That being said these are quite tasty.
