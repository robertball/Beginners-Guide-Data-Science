I made this into a blended drink, just throwing the ingredients into the blender and pulsing until it was uniform. I did use 4 large frozen strawberries as mine were not sliced. VERY good. I think I'd add a couple more strawberries next time.

Loved this drink!  I purchased some Cruzan coconut rum on a recent trip to St. Thomas so thought this would be a perfect use.  I chose to blend all of the ingredients and make a slushy drink...used frozen grapefruit sections instead of juice.  Also added about a tblsp of white sugar.  Couldn't resist taking a photo of this drink on a Caribbean-blue napkin!

This sounded really good so I decided to make it for our annual july 4th bash.  So, after buying enough ingrediants to serve 40 people, my hubby and I decided to taste test it before hand--Good thing we did, because it wasn't what we were expecting at all.  I think the grapefruit juice made it too sour or something.  Even after I added more strawberries, I still didn't care for it.  Keep looking.

This combination made for a very tasty summertime drink as is -- but I enjoyed it with a few adjustments.  I skipped blending the strawberries and served it over ice with a cherry.  The grapefruit juice gives it a great tang.  Also good made with a grapefruit/lemonade combination.  We loved it in winter - can't wait to enjoy it on the patio this summer!

i liked this recipe. except i substituted cream of coconut, or coconut milk, or coconut water for the rum, to make a non- alcoholic version kids will love. you can also make it into a sorbet if you know how.

This is fantastic! I doubled the juices so the drink wasn't too strong and we loved it! Favorite new cocktail that we tried on our vacation to the Oregon coast.

way way way too much rum.  I love rum as much as anyone else, but a cup is overpowering.  I would cut the rum by half.
