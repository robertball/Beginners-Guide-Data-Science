This is a neat recipe! The recipe doesn't give enough instructions though for non-experienced cooks, so here you go . . . cover the stew while it's being cooked on the stove, otherwise the liquid will cook off. Also, place the pumpkin top back on the pumpkin after it's filled, make sure the pumpkin stem is wet, and then cover the stem with tin foil.

This was fabulous!  I doubled the recipe for a party and used an 11 lb. French cooking pumpkin.  I made the stew Friday night and baked it Saturday.  It came out wonderful and the leftovers just got better and beter.  Served with a crusty french bread to complete!  Thanks for this great recipe - I will make it again.

I had a 5 person Thanksgiving party this year and decided t try this recipe. Made stew in 5 small individual pumpkins and they were a HUGE HIT. I was nervous about how everything would turn out but I followed other's suggestions and it was such a success. A few notes..

1.) Instead of 1 large 10-12 lbs pumpkin I used 5 small organic sugar pumpkins. Extends prep time but the presentation is amazing and your guests will be amazed! Rubbed pumpkin pie spice on inside of hallowed out pumpkin before pouring stew and baking.
2.) Additional ingredients: Sliced celery (adds flavor!), corn, cut green beans, & portabella mushroom. Very hearty.
3.) Reduced salt by 1/2
4.) Wet stems & cover with foil when bakiing. DO NOT overbake. I baked for only 1 hour 15 min. 
5.) Sprinkled freshly grated Parmesean Reggiano and toasted spiced pumpkin seeds (collected from the pumpkins)on top of each stew right before serving.

Comfort food, folks! Wonderful.

This has to be one of the best recipes I have ever seen for a party or large dinner party.  I have made it twice and it is always a huge hit.  People are blown away by the presentation and taste.  Five stars all around.  As others have noted the directions are a bit sketchy.  Cover the stew while cooking on the stove and the pumpkin's top while in the oven.  Also, feel free to add nearly anything you like to the beef stew.  I increased the vegetable count some.  Just make sure that you do not add so much that the resulting stew no longer fits inside the pumpkin you have.

About the pumpkin:  I have no idea where you would find a 12 pound sugar pumpkin but it would not work.  You need a standard "jack-o-lantern" pumpkin.  A jack-o-lantern pumpkin contains quite a bit of water; making it unsuitable for use in most recipes.  But, the stew you create in the first part of this recipe is too thick on its own.  However, when you move it into the pumpkin to finish cooking the water from the pumpkin fixes that problem and adds a wonderful flavor as well.

We thought that this had a very pretty presentation.  The idea is wonderful.  The stew....not so great.  It lacked in flavor and seasonings.  May try this again another time, but first time was not a hit.

Being cajun, I couldn't resist changing the recipe just a bit. I added 1/2 more pound of beef, 12 oz. of "Texas Pete Seafood Cocktail Sauce, and more salt than the recipe calls for. I also boiled the potatoes and carrots for 30 min. before following the recipe(I actually could have cooked them longer). I also didn't serve in the pumpkin but scooped everything into a large bowl. the pumpkin was delicious and the stew was better than that.

Spare the poor pumkin!  Added so many things to this stew to try and give it some flavor that it no longer had any relationship to this recipe.  Cooked the pumpkin exactly as directed.  The bottom split open and some of the stew leaked out preventing any thought of moving the ensemble to an attractive serving dish.  The pumpkin looked pretty however.  Will try again cooking the pumpkin empty for a shorter time and than filling it with something else - possibly pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes.  Or maybe I'll forget it all together!

This is such a unique recipe, presentation is gorgeous, and I believe that the pumpkin itself adds to the flavours of the stew and enriches the beef taste quite well. Very original, and delicious in the fall months. For a summer variation, try making a cold soup inside a hollowed out summer squash.

Made this for the first time and it's delicious. I used smaller red and orange peppers rather than green bell to make it more festive and add spice. I also added portabella mushrooms. I've found it a safe bet, based on other reviews, to not scrape very hard on the bottom of the pumpkin. This way it is less likely to crack. Also, I sat the pumpkin atop the stove as it warmed up, so that it wasn't such a drastic change in temperature (so to avoid the pumpkin potentially splitting.) I also added some canned apricots, diced. Yum!!!

A fun and fabulous fall recipe. However, I would cut back on the salt a little, but I like salt so it was not a big deal. I think this will become a fall tradition for us.

AMAZING! So much better than my family's old recipe for Dinner in a Pumpkin. This Pumpkin Stew will be the new tradition in our household for Halloween. I changed the recipe by adding 3 cups of water instead of one (there were so many veggies that it needed more liquid to make a stew, flavor was not compromised at all), and by simmering on the stove for only 1 hour, then cooking in the pumpkin in the oven for only 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Any longer would have over cooked the pumpkin! It was already slumping over after 1 1/2 hours. And, of course, I drew a jack-o-lantern face on the outside with a permanent marker before brushing with oil.

This is a great seasonal stew idea, and the presentation is spectacular, but the recipe as it stands is kind of bland, thus the 3 star rating. Still, I've made this several times with my own variations (including thyme and other herbs, changing up the vegetables, adding a can of Guinness even) because I love pumpkin and the presentation was totally worth it. It's become my Halloween dinner tradition.

The stew was very tender. The pumpkin was beautiful.  However, the recipe was not to my liking.  I jazzed it up with seasonings but for the most part I followed the recipe.  This is more like soup than stew. No tomatoes..almost didn't add them, wish I hadn't. Next time I will use MY beef stew recipe and I will add a thickening agent as I like my stew thick not soupy.  It was fun though.  It got eaten.

My mom made a similar version of this stew every Halloween before we were allowed to get into costume and hit the streets for candy gold. We add 8 dried apricots, cut in half, and 1/4 cup golden raisins. It adds a little sweetness to the recipe and taste REALLY good when they plump up from the liquid. Thanks!

I used a 10 pound pumpkin for a serving size for 3 people.  I prebaked the pumpkin for 30 minutes for easy cutting (which is also supposedly good for enhancing the flavor).  Instead of green peppers, I added celery, I added only 2/3 of the salt and no bouillon cubes, and added twice the amount of water the recipe called for.  I don't think I used the right pumpkin since the pumpkin meat was not very tasty.  However, the presentation was beautiful and the stew itself was wonderful!

Lovely stew, but needs some thickening. I would dredge the meat in flour before browning next time. I also used red peppers instead of green.

Pumpkin soup is a halloween tradition at our house, but we use smoked keilbassa rather than beef then add the winter vegetables; a rutabega, a couple of parsnips, a sweet potato and just a handfull of wild rice. be sure to scrape some of the pumpkin into each bowl.  sprinkle with a little bit of fresh parmesan

This is a pretty awesome idea.  I used a jack o lantern pumpkin because I couldn't find a large enough sugar pumpkin.  There was not very much pumpkin flavor, and the stew could use a little more spice/flavor, but the presentation is out of this world!  I will make this again, tweaking here and there to give more flavor.

Spectacular presentation.  I was rushed so I chopped my ingredients small to speed the initial cooking to an hour.  I used beef stock instead of water and bouillion, omitted the bell pepper and added about 1.5 tsp. of Herbes de Provence, which were delicious in this recipe.  I also uppped the salt, since my stock was low in salt.  Tried the suggestion to wrap the stem in foil, which worked perfectly.  My family is demanding this for Halloween dinner!

I made this about a month ago and it was  delicious.  I tweaked the stew recipe to our liking and followed others advice to oil the outside of the pumpkin and cover the stem.  When I cut our pumpkin open it had such thick flesh that I was not able to put all of the stew in it.  I continued to cook the remaining stew on the stove top until tender and then added it to the pumpkin as needed when serving.  Make sure you scrape the pumpkin flesh with each scoop so that you get some delicious pumpkin in each bowl.  I'm making this again tonight at my husband's request.

Excellent stew. Had to almost triple the amount of water, but I used beef broth instead for a lovely rich taste. Omitted the beef granules too. Omitted the tomato for personal tastes.  Husband said it was the best stew I ever made.  The pumpkin adds a great offset flavor.

This is really good, but it's a lot of work, so save it for a special occasion.  I couldn't find a sugar pumpkin of the right size so I used a regular baking pumpkin (the kind people carve.)  It was still excellent... maybe a little more savory.

My husband LOVED it, he already wants me to make it for his family next week for the holidays.  I am still unsure if I used the correct pumpkin which is why I gave it 4 stars as I am not sure if it would taste better or different with a sugar pumpkin, but indeed it was good.  The pumpkin came out with a spaghetti squash stringiness to the meat (I have never cooked pumpkin to eat so I wasn't sure what to expect).  We didn't add as much bouillon and omitted the salt as we aren't big fans and it still had enough flavor for us to enjoy.  I actually included the tomatoes with the initial stovetop simmer and used italian style canned tomatoes (basil, garlic and oregano already added) and it was still good.   Makes me wonder if this could be a nice crock pot meal and add to the pumpkin after work for an hour. Great presentation piece and makes something very fancy of a plain old comfort food.

I absolutely am in LOVE with this stew. I didn't cook it IN the pumpkin, due to the leakage issues other people had. I had the kids peel, then I chopped up half of a tiny pumpkin, and added it to the stew. I'm seriously lazy, so I browned the meat in a stock pot, threw the rest of the ingredients in, brought it to a boil, then put it in the slow cooker. 4 hours later, we were all in heaven. Leftovers lasted all week, and I loved every single bowl! I've struggled with beef stew in the past, and I can't stand the taste of white potatoes in my stews, but THIS... oh heavens... it was heaven! Thanks, Cathryn! Well done, girl!

Have been making this recipe for over 15 years, since it first appeared in the magazine and my family starts asking for it as soon as they see the pumpkins.  I do add more veggies and meat then they say and I cook it longer.  We love this fabulous pumpkin creation

I have a better stew recipe that I think I will stick with (add a bit of red wine and some bay leaf).  I usually cook mine in smaller individual pumpkins.  Guests eat the cooked pumpkin as they go.   Delicious!!

We have used this recipe on several occasions and gatherings. People find it unusual but, at the sametime, super delicious. It is one dish that there is no leftovers for the next day.

While I didn't follow the stew recipie at all (I am a stew pro) the idea of making it in a pumpkin intigued me.  My husband and I went to a fall festival, picked out a pumpkin and made this dish.  We LOVED it!  I'm sure this will become a family tradition.

I agree with reviewers who say this is a great, basic recipe Equally, I concur with those who say the resulting flavor, as the recipe is written is pretty bland.  I've been making a similar recipe for some time , and logged on to double-check cook times.  I'd like to suggest a few easy tweaks to remedy the plainness of the recipe. Beef, pork, lamb, or some smoked sausage would work well as a filling, but be sure to season the meat first and brown in a separate skillet.  Personally, I like to add Montreal Seasoning to the beef choice, and I do so with a fairly heavy hand since my family prefers more robust flavors. A pinch of ground cloves also heightens the flavor with beef, but be conservative with it.   If using pork, I'm more inclined to use sage or poultry seasoning to taste.  For lamb, I prefer thyme and a bit of rosemary. Ground black pepper, and lots of it, is a constant, regardless of the iteration.  Also, instead of beef bouillon cubes, which are fine, I add dried French Onion soup mix for more of a kick, but a can of condensed Cream of Mushroom  or Celery soup would also be an easy flavor boost for milder palates. The presentation always wins oohs and aahs from guests and I love that about this recipe.  Also, it really lends itself to individual interpretation and variety.

It would have been a five but I had thicken it up with cornstarch and add some extra spices.  I did not cook in pumpkin. I chunked raw pumpkin and added to stew when I added the potatoes. Next time I might try and mash cooked pumpkin into broth mixture to thicken adding more flavor.

This was an excellent stew.  I only had a small pumpkin so I cut it up and put it in the stew during the last hour of cooking.  Didn't eat until the next day so the flavors could blend.  The family loved it.

This was fantastic.  The presentation was nice.  I made this for our college girls halloween party.   I used beef stock instead of water, and only one pound of meat (it waa fajita meat not stew meat).  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I was fantastic, everyone loved it!  It was sooooo good.

I use this year after year...people love the idea that it is in a pumpkin. I have even used the already prepared beef stew and just shave pumpkin off the side to add to the stew and stew flavor.

Found what the store called a Jamacia pumpkin for Thanksgivng dinner. Used ground sirloin instread of stew beef and added three cans of different beans & one of corn to make it more veggie friendly. Microwaved pumpkin while cooking filling. Put cooked filling in pumpkin and baked a couple hours to blend flavors. DELICIOUS and impressed in-laws.

I loved this recipe! Although I did chicken out and cut the pumpkin up to boil and add to the stew to simmer for the last 2 hours. The pumpkin I had looked unstable and it couldn't be trusted in my oven. I also added nutmeg, oregano, sage, thyme, celery and red pepper flakes. It definitely had the house smelling like fall

This is a great recipe. The only thing I added was fresh ginger slices, a couple of extra garlic cloves and a dash of cinnamon. The fam loved it! We wait every year for pumpkins just so we can make stew!

This recipe was amazing!  Not to mention it looked so pretty on my fall decorated table. I used venison round steak instead of beef. Now, I did spice it up a notch- I added twice the amount of garlic, added garlic powder and garlic salt, Mrs. Dash (yes, garlic), two very exaggerated dashes of Cayenne pepper, and a big dash of ground red pepper for the extra "kick"! I also used Rotel Mexican Fiesta instead of peeled tomatoes.   Very, Very yummy!!

I just used it for how to treating the pumpkin.  Hollie2 great tip on the stem.  Use your family's FAVORITE stew recipe, add more liquid (beef or vegetable broth cause the pumpkin absorbs like crazy)as needed. It really rocks!

This dinner was a perfect meal for guests to have during the fall season.  I used two pumpkins and placed each on a small dish, then placed slices of apples around the pumpkin to make it a little more festive.  We passed the pumpkins around and I received rave reviews...thanks!!!

This turned out very good. I did have to add more seasoning and I did use red bell pepper instead of green. My husband really loved this and has informed me that I can cook it again. Also, as others have said, be careful not to scrape the bottom of the pumpkin too hard. Luckily ours was still in the pan when everything leaked out.

I made this for Halloween season and we really liked the flavoring balance and the soft pumpkin additions.   Sadly I read the recipe wrong and put the tomatoes in with everything so we needed to add additional water later so it actually was a “stew” instead of casserole.  Also instead of granules, I used the gel kind of beef base.

Made this recipe for a Halloween party.  Everyone really loved it, and I made only a minor change to the original recipe.    Since I doubled the recipe, I couldn't find a large sugar pumpkin. Used a jack o'lantern pumpkin instead, and that worked well.

This was very easy to make and came out very tasty.  My family loved it and I will definitely make this again.  I will reiterate watching the pumpkin closely.  I cooked mine for 1 hour and the bottom had cracked.

I have to admit...I did not read the whole recipe ahead of time...I thought it was 2 hours total.  Soo, I made the stew in the dutch oven on the stove as suggested.  At the same time, I baked two small pumpkins inverted in the oven for the 55 minutes at 350 while the stew was cooking on the stove.  Then, I put the stew in the pumpkins, and baked for an additional hour.  They came out fantastic!  I did not use the bullion.  I added a little burgundy red wine with the tomatoes, and there was plenty of juice.  I had more stew than fit into small pumpkins, so I baked that in a small corning round, and added a bit of barley.  Now we have more stew to freeze, or use during the week!  This is a great, innovative dish- thanks!

This is a family tradition on halloween night! The first year I made it with beef the second with chicken Both were fantastic! This year Ill make it with chicken again I put more spices in it too and add cheese on top for the last ten minutes of oven time! My family loves it! I also cook it in little individual pumpkins so we each have our own! Good luck with yours!

So yummy! I made this tonight for a pumpkin carving party and it was a hit! I used about a 1/2 tablespoon of Montreal Steak Spice mix instead of salt and pepper, and added a bit of cinnamon to complement the pumpkin flavor. I also added extra kinds of veggies I had left over in my fridge. This took me back to my childhood, thank you so much for sharing!

Not enough liquid or seasoning. The stew was very bland and thick. Maybe next time a bay leaf or some other seasoning will add some flavor.

I have made this recipe several times and it's amazing!!! It is just beautiful!! But, do not over bake the pumpkin or you stand the risk of it collapsing.

This recipe is so good that we've made it into a family tradition. Every Halloween for the past 4 years I make it and everyone loves it. The only thing I change is that I let the stew simmer for 2 hours COVERED as the recipe doesn't specify this.

I love this recipe. The stew is great on it's own but I was really surprised at how awesome the pumpkin bits are. The pumpkin really compliments the stew. And of course the presentation is perfect for fall. One of my family's favorite fall traditions!
