Ma Hunsicker's Spaghetti Sauce Haiku: "Halved the recipe. And didn't have celery. (When to add the wine?)" Other than using some dried celery flakes instead of celery (would've preferred the real thing, but didn't have any), I was faithful to this recipe. Red wine was listed on the ingredient list, but never mentioned in the directions, so I ended up stirring it in at step 3. Let it simmer for the recommended 3 hrs, and yes, it required frequent stirrings during that time. Served over 1/2 spaghetti noodles, half "zoodles" (zucchini cut into noodle-ey strips and saut√©ed in a little olive oil). Good sauce, and once my tomato garden explodes later this summer, I may swap the canned out for fresh and make triple batches of this to freeze.
