I have the original cookbook from which this recipe was taken - it's been modified a bit here from the source.  The original calls out 2/3 cup of heavy (whipping) cream, not 1 cup.  And as you might have guessed, the "corn meal" is a typo, that should be corn starch.  The prep time has been understated a little - don't underestimate the time required to chop 4 cloves, 1 onion and _finely_ chop 3 potatoes.  This is a wonderful soup, always a huge hit with guests.  Be careful with the cayenne pepper though! 1/2 tsp with a full recipe will make it plenty spicy, add more at your own risk.

Really great soup! Added a little extra seasoning and substituted corn starch for the corn meal and skim milk for the heavy cream.  I did not blend the soup at all.  Turned out to be a thick and creamy soup.  I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch this week!

Wonderful recipe!  I used chicken stock instead of veg, peanut butter instead of tahini, and half skim milk/half cream to cut the calories.  Can't wait to make it again!

I loved this recipe! I did make a change, based on spices on hand. I used turmeric instead of coriander.

Delicious! I made this soup last night and it was hearty and perfect for a cold winter's night. I only made a few changes - I added a lot more garlic, couldn't find any coriander, added half a cup of sour cream and half a cup of reduced fat milk instead of heavy cream, and that's it. Next time I might add more vegetables - broccoli, cauliflower, carrots. Highly recommended!

I wasn't sure if you should blend the soup or not. I slightly blended the soup and then added the spinich and it turned out well.

Made with cornstarch, canned potatoes, cannelini beans, and frozen spinach.1/2 tspn cayenne was too spicy, would add less next time. Felt it tasted a little too 'powdery', like the cumin wasn't cooked properly (would suggest adding cumin immediately to onions & garlic to help the powder flavor of the cumin cook out). I'm Indian and have cooked with ground cumin and ground coriander quite a bit and should have known better. Overall, a pretty good recipe, healthy, and different.

Outstanding! Added more cumin and coriander for a fuller flavor; used 5 cups chicken consomme, lite coconut milk, the leftovers of simple roasted chickpeas and frozen spinach (didn't fully defrost or cook - just plopped the frozen chunk into the hot liquid). Would add more spinach next time. And there will definitely be a next time!!

We made this one night for a vegetarian friend and were addicted at the first bite! Even my Dad, a meatatarian eats it every time. 
I'm not sure why people think it should be cornstarch, we have used corn meal every time and it adds to the flavor. Also you have to make sure the spinach is cooked all the way, and we have frequently ground up sesame seeds and added a few drops of sesame seed oil when we couldn't find tahini. 
Wealways serve the soup and let everyone add their own cayenne pepper to their preference, this recipe is amazing!!

This soup is good without rocking my world.  I substantially followed the recipe, with only minor changes, including cornstarch instead of corn meal and low fat condensed milk in place of heavy cream.  I think the texture benefited from partially pureeing it and the lemon juice suggested by another reviewer was a good enhancement.

I thought this soup was super.  The only thing I didn't have on hand was the tahini.  I figured it was for thickening the soup so I just made a slurry.  It had great floavor and the corriander gave it a great finish.

Wow, did I underestimate this soup! It was absolutely delicious! I normally use canned coconut milk instead of cream, half and half or milk, and it lent a nice exotic flavor with the tahini, chickpeas and coriander. I used corn starch instead of meal, can't imagine using that, as other reviewers suggested. I've used tons of recipes off of this site and this is a big suprizer- one of the best yet. I lazily added garlic pwder instead of fresh. This blew our socks off! Thanks so much for the great recipe, it's to die for~:))

I thought this soup was only so-so. Even though I didn't add any salt to the soup, it tasted quite salty. I too used reduced fat milk in place of the heavy cream. It really wasn't very thick, at least with the milk instead of cream. I will probably not make this again.

Totally boring, until we jazzed it up with fresh lemon juice and a generous shake of cayenne! The soup looks beautiful (the spinach doesn't "float" like another review said if you let it cook all the way) and has lots of potential--but we'll add Italian sausage or bacon to the leftovers to make it more substantial. Thanks for a good soup starter!

A lovely mild, but flavorful soup. I substituted the cream with 2% milk and the cornmeal with corn starch, as someone else recommended, which worked very well. I used fresh spinich from my garden, but I'm sure that frozen would work well too. I also ground my spices from whole and finely chopped the garlic instead of crushing it. I'll be making this regularly. Perfect for a rainy evening. I'm taking it to work for lunch tomorrow too. I did want to note that the recipe called for combining/mixing (blending) the cream, tahini, and cornmeal, not blending the entire soup. Half of the fun of eating this is the textures.

If you like it thicker, it might help to blend the potatoes before adding.  We liked the flavor.

I had "some" fresh spinach that I added to the onions and garlic step to precook based on certain reviews.  I think it was less than half.  I did 8 small-medium potatoes and cooked garbanzzo beans from dry.  I think my dh will not like, my 4 year old doesn't like but i think it is passable.  Tahini taste is a little strong.

I found this to be oddly bland, and my husband hated it. Since I had a LOT left over, I tried adding a lot more spinach and doubling the spices, which made it good enough to eat, but not really very good. I did, of course, know to use cornstarch. I also think the spinach needs to be cooked, rather than warmed. I did not serve the uncooked spinach, so that wasn't why my husband found it inedible.

I ditto Kym's review below, as she said it well. Very little zip in this, needed much more cumin and garlic, and was missing something. May sound wierd, but CILANTRO, which is the leaves of coriander, may be what is missing; I did not like the ground coriander, but cilantro is paired with these ingredients many times in my Middle-Eastern cookbook. Reminder, too, that corn meal should be cornSTARCH, which I used.

This was good, but it did seem to be missing something--I think the reviewer who added lemon juice had the right idea. It also didn't taste very garlicky for a garlic soup. Instead of cream, I used almond milk thickened with cornstarch. A suggestion: If you don't have tahini, don't use peanut butter--it's not even close to a reasonable substitute; the flavor is completely different. You'd be better off using nothing--or try grinding some sesame seeds or adding sesame oil.

Great soup!  I followed other reviewers' advice and used 1 cup skim milk and 2 T cornstarch instead of cream and corn meal and I ended up with a very thick, rich soup.  I used an immersion blender at the end to smooth the texture a bit as well.  I didn't have tahini so I did as others suggested and used peanut butter but I didn't particularly like that flavor so I think next time I'll either try to find tahini or skip it altogether.  This recipe is definitely a keeper - makes a lot but stays good in the fridge for a few days.

Excellent! Didn't have coriander, so skipped it, used skim milk.  Used peanut butter rather than tahini but it was still remarkable.  A unique combination of flavors--thanks so much for contributing this!

Just what the doctor ordered!  Both my husband and I are sick with the flu and he wanted some spinach.  I made this and it hit the spot!  I only had whole coriander, so I just crushed it up as well as possible and added to the soup.  I also didn't have tahini so I just ground up sesame seeds and added some lemon juice to it and mixed it in with fat free half and half (instead of heavy cream).  I also used a pound of frozen spinach and added some extra water.  Instead of using vegatable stock, I added chicken broth and it gave it a great flavor.

Wow; if I could do six stars then I would. I used chicken and beef bouillon for this, used evaporated milk instead of cream and used a LOT of spinach but did everything else by the book. This soup is AWESOME! thank you!

It has such a good flavor, warm and delicious! I too followed other recommendations such as using corn STARCH instead of corn MEAL (extremely important) and adding the cumin & coriander to the raw onions before sauteeing. I used Knorr Homestyle vegetable stock (concentrated, sold in a 4-pack of little tubs) - just dissolve two tubs into 7 cups of boiling water - fabulous, so much more flavor than broth in a can/box. We'll definitely make this again and again!

Loved this soup; next time I might try regular milk instead of cream to make it a little less fattening, but it tasted wonderful.

I did not have some ingredients on hand, had reduced fat peanut butter and fat free milk...seemed to work out well. I blended half of the soup when the potatoes were tender. Good soup but was missing something, husband suggested shredded chicken.....several times =)

I like it, but I have to add salt individually to each bowl to really give it flavor--so make sure to add enough to the pot at the end.  I didn't have coriander, so I replaced it with allspice and oregano and it tastes fine.

I  started to make this but didn't have the cream, tahini, nor corn starch. So the rest became the base of a wonderful soup. I added zucchini and a can of green chilies and tomatoes. It came out amazing.

Fantastic! Substituted veggie broth with chicken broth and used Power Greens salad mix since I didnt have enough spinach. Definitely needs the salt and red pepper  for stronger flavors. Served with bread for a hearty meal- guests loved it!

Super easy to adjust to whatever you have lying around!  I didn't have enough vegetable stock, so supplemented with chicken broth.  No heavy whipping cream, but used buttermilk and cornstarch instead of cornmeal.  Also had to do without the spices, so slightly blander, but LOVE IT that way!

Rich and satisfying.   -Used 15 oz spinach leaves, de-stemmed; coconut milk in place of cream.;  1 T. Toasted sesame oil for one of the T of olive oil;  went very easy on the cayenne as it's way too easy to get too much; pureed all together with handblender and added a smidge of pure maple syrup, plus salt and pepper at the end.

What a soup! Delicious and hearty. I used sour cream instead of heavy cream, and as some reviewers suggested, used corn starch instead of the corn feed. Highly recommend it.

I wasn't impressed with this. I don't think the flavours blend well. The spinach is especially out of place. I will not make it again. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is bc my husb thought it was good.

For me a recipe is more of a guideline than a rule, so I did make a few changes.  I added additional curry spices, and I did sautee them with the garlic and onion.  I used natural peanut butter and coconut milk, instead of the tahini and heavy cream, respectively, as per another reviewer's suggestion.  I blended the soup when the potatoes were soft, before I added the spinach.  I omitted the corn meal.  This will go into my regular rotation, it is delicious and healthy.

I would blend everything before the last step of adding the spinach.  As written, the different textures together are strange. Also, I did not add any additional salt at the end.

Made this recipe as written other than subbing corn starch for corn meal (I think that was a mistype) and using 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream, and adding a small amount of smoked paprika.  Very comforting.  Look forward to seeing what the leftovers taste like.

I thought this was delicious!  Used a 10 oz. package of frozen spinach, one percent milk instead of the cream, and corn starch of course.  And it was still very tasty.
