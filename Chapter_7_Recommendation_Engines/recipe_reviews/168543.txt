I doubled this for my two boys today and used what I had left of my homemade Supreme Strawberry Topping, which is also from this site. (I love the ingredient search on this site.....just plugged in strawberry sauce/topping and this came up!) No almond syrup so I used almond flavoring. They liked it okay. I had a small sip and thought it was good but would be better as a smoothie or shake. I would like to try this in the blender with a little frozen vanilla yogurt or lowfat vanilla ice cream.
