I used talapia instead of catfish, but this recipes was OUTSTANDING! I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it too! By far my favorite seafood dish that I have EVER made.

This is truly the best catfish we have ever eaten.  The recipe is a little time consuming but well worth it.  I slice the filets lengthwise into thinner pieces before flouring & frying.  They cook faster & I keep the cooked pieces warm in a 200 degree oven.  I have made this many times & it has never been anything short of superb!

Found this easy to fix and very good. Husband really liked it. I did use white wine instead of vermouth, cause it was on hand but it worked fine.
I have used several other shellfish with this and all were good.

Very good but takes a long time to make. Try making it with bluegill,crappie or bass. Make sauce with seasoning in it and poor over raw fish and put in oven

I tried this with oysters instead of shrimp, too, using the oyster liquid in the sauce and frying the oysters in the batter.  This also was met with rave reviews from everyone.  There wasn't a morsel left!

This recipe is excellent! I love the sauce and it isn't difficult to make. 
I substituted crayfish tails for the shrimp and it is just as excellent.  Good with succotash, too!

I made this last night for dinner!  It was good!  My husband and I are not huge catfish fans, but I wanted to branch out a little.  This was easy to make.  I did buy cooked shrimp and just heated it a little in butter and garlic before I served it.  Also, I did not have any Vermouth, so I just used white wine, I don't think it made a huge difference.  I really liked the sauce, very spicy!

This meal was awsome.  My family and guest could not get enough.  We ate dinner and about an hour later some wanted to know if there were any left overs.  This one will be on the menu every week.

This is an excellent fish sauce that closely resembles a sauce made at one of my favorite cajun restaurants.  I did amend the recipe a bit and I think it has more spice and more savory than the original.  Here are my changes, enjoy!

increased butter to 2 tablespoons, cooking sherry instead of white vermouth, dry, white wine instead of lemon juice, increased total from 2 tsps to 1/4-1/2 cup.  no ham.  used 1 pound medium sized shrimp. added 1/4 tsp of cajun poultry seasoning.  To get the consistency I wanted, I also ended up cooking this sauce for about 30 minutes at a slow simmer after boil.

I was actually a little disappointed by this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and thought it was too rich and a bit bland.  Might try to spice it up IF I try it again.

This recipe is so delicious! Please try it next time you want to really impress dinner guests. It turns out perfectly every time, and the presentation makes it look quite fancy, but it's really easy. Jasmine rice goes well with this dish. Try it!

Excellent.  Very rich tasting, mild enough for anyone, but you could spice it up if needed with suggested ways.

I made this last night for a special Valentine's Day meal and it was delicious!  We had gone out for dinner the previous night, and my husband declared that this meal was even better than the one he had out.  I too used white wine instead of vermouth, and I halved the recipe so it served two people.  I steamed some asparagus and the meal was complete!  I WILL be making this one again!

This is my favorite dish of all time.  I had a similar version in a popular southern restaurant in college and searched for the recipe for a long time before I found this one.  Aside from being delicious, it makes a killer presentation for guests – mine always rave about my “5 star” cooking after this.  Its almost sad that its this easy to make!
