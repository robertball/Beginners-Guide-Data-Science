I totally dig this!  This was a breeze to make & very tasty as well (this is my kind of soup, I just love spinich).  I topped it off with some fresh grated parmesan cheese & real bacon bits.  A delicious light lunch.  Thanks Corwynn!

This was a good recipe, however it does not make very much and it needs to be doubled if you want leftovers or are serving more than 2-3 people.

This is a great recipe.  I made it for my girlfriend on Valintines Day and she loved it.  The only thing I changed was the second time I made it with more basil and more spinach.  I think it worked a little better.  Thanks!

My husband and I thought this was wonderful!  It is very different from the soups I usually make, so I was apprehensive about serving it.  I'm used to all kinds of vegetables and meat etc. in my soups, but we will be having this often. It is very easy to make and quite delicious.  The only thing I did different was to use a Vidalia onion instead of the green onions.  I would recommend that you give it a try. Thanks for submitting this recipe Corwynn.

This was really good!  I used half and half and chicken base (from Sam's club) and it was still very good!  I'd like to try it with vegetable broth.  Will definitely make again.  Maybe a dash of white wine for complexity.

I loved this concept, and since I had read the reviews, I loved the end product. I did increase all the vegetables and herbs to double what was written, and only cooked the soup for 10 minutes after I had added the spinach and herbs. It was delicious. Thanks for the idea!

Was surprised how well everyone liked this.  I basically made it thinking only hubby and I would like it, but, the kids loved it too!  My broth came out very thin, next time I may add a bit more flour.  The only changes I made was using a sweet white onion instead of green onion because that was all I had.  Severd with fish & rice, perfect compliment.

I love the idea and the name of this a lot more than the recipe as written. The broth is going to be FAR too thin if you make it as written, you will need to double the flour (at least) to get a good, velvetty texture. I ended up increasing all of the herbs to at least one cup. Cooking the herbs/spinach for 30 minutes is extreme overkill; they really only need to be cooked long enough to soften and let the flavor out - 15 minutes, tops. In the end, this was a very servicable appetizer soup, but I think the idea could be put to much better use than this recipe. Thanks for letting me try it!

How can you go wrong with cream soup? I actually skipped the simmering for 30 minutes because I accidentally added the cream with the broth. Turned out great anyway. Great way to use herbs and spinach from the garden!

I was skeptical at first about making a soup out of nothing but herbs, but this was so good. Because my wife is allergic to onions, I substituted onion powder.

This recipe was just what I was looking for, creamy but not heavy. Next time I will use less butter. One tablespoon to saute the onions should be plenty.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone really liked it.  The only issue I had was I changed the servings to 6 for 6 people and there wasn't enough to make full bowls for everyone.  I would plan on more servings.

I came across this, and it sounded like a nice, light, change.

I did read some reviews where others had said they thickened this recipe with more flour--I would definitely agree with that.  I also added twice the number of vegetables this called for, and a dash of lemon juice as well.

I was overall pleased with the end result.  I might need to tweak it a little more next time, but I felt it came out well.  And it was a perfect soup for a clear and cool day!

Not much flavor to this soup, in spite of doubling the spinach. I like my cream soups to be smooth, so I pureed the herb broth before adding cream. Although it was creamy, it was too much work for too little return. I wouldn't make this again.

I love this!  It was light and delicious. I did not add the sugar or the butter/flour mixture in at the end. It fit both my husband's and my diet. He does low fat and I just scooped his bowl full out before I added the cream.  I added the cream for mine, which I do low carb and it didn't have sugar or flour, but it was still wonderful.  One could probably double all the greens and make this just as good, but heartier.

Delicious and perfectly light for a hot summer day!

Following other reviewers' suggestions to make more and thicken the soup, I:

- Doubled the greens and added a little extra basil and spinach
- Used 1.5x the liquids
- Tripled the flour/butter roux
- Topped it with bacon crumbles

I'll definitely be making this again when I have more greens about to go bad.

I wanted a vegetable cream sauce that was just a little bit different from my usual Alfredo Sauce to use over Pasta for our "Meatless Mondays" dinner, and this soup (which, admittedly, I totally changed) served as a GREAT base for that purpose (hence, the 5 stars). My "tweaks" included using 3/4 stick of Butter (as opposed to just 3 T.) and 2 pre-cooked (and fully mashed) YukonGold Potatoes instead of flour to make my roux. Then I used 5 Vegetable Bouillon cubes (plus 5 cups of water) instead of chicken broth plus the recommended 1 cup of Half-and-Half (I actually used 1/2 cup of Heavy/Whipping Cream plus 1/2 cup Homogenized Milk) to make the base sauce. I used 1/2 pkg. frozen chopped Spinach, 1/2 pkg. frozen Cauliflower, and 1/2 cup of shredded Carrots as my vegetables. Although I actually altered this recipe irrevocably, I am reviewing it here because I genuinely liked the idea of using Scallions instead of yellow onions and the addition of just the right amount of sugar. I would never have thought to use either of these ingredients instead of my own "old stand-bys", but these 2  adjustments made a BIG difference in the end product. I added the Basil, Parsley, Salt, and Pepper as directed, but I also sprinkled some Paprika over our Pasta just before serving; as always, I made a grated Parmesan/Rommano cheese mix available at the dinner table. I made 2 different shapes of Pasta -- Fusilli for the Adults and Bowties for the Grandchildren -- and EVERYBODY simply gobbled it up!

Very flavorful soup!  I added some chopped chives, decreased the chicken broth to 4 cups, added 1 1/2 cups of milk and a splash of white wine vinegar.  Yummy!

Very tasty, but with lots of adjustments:
1) Switch the 2 tsp of butter to saute onion in and 3 tbsp for the roux.  The other way around the roux just gets lumpy and the onions don't need that much butter.
2) Saute onions for 3-4 minutes.  I used an entire 10oz bag spinach because it's what I had and wanted to use up.  Won't need 10 minutes--only saute until wilted, maybe 3 minutes.
3) Reduce broth by half otherwise way too watery.  And simmer the spinach and herbs for 4-5 minutes max otherwise a) you kill all the nutrition and b) the spinach gets too mushy.
4) Make the roux BEFORE adding the half and half.  Return the roux to the soup and then add half and half.  H&H can also be reduced to 1/4-1/2 cup to save on calories.

These adjustments really helped, otherwise I think it unfortunately, wouldn't have turned out well.  Quite tasty!
