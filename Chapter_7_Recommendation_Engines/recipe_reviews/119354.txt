I made this for a party last night and it was perfect! I mixed in the paprika/crumbs because after baking, I used a crock pot to keep it warm and everyone wanted the recipe! Thanks for sharing this one, I'll be making it again soon!

1/4 teaspoon hot sauce for a cajun dish?  I started out thinking that was odd, but thought maybe the horseradish would make up for it.  My only addition at first was to add shrimp.  After 30 minutes of cooking, I took it out of the oven but it was still a little runny so I was going to put it back in the oven and decided to taste it first.  I had to get busy and start adding red pepper flakes, green onion tops, bay seasoning and black pepper.  I think it's a great base, but certainly not enough heat for a dish that is from Louisiana.

This was very tasty, though I did tweek it a little. I added an additional can of crab meat, a few sprinkles more of hot sauce, a few shakes of Old Bay, and used lower fat cream cheese, and only half an onion. It turned out great and everyone loved it. (It's also awesome cold the next day!)

This was a great recipe!  I have made it twice since New Years Eve and everyone just raves.  I hate it when people adjust recipes but I did adjust this one.  I added a tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning, and additional foil pouch of crab meat, and about two ounces of sharp cheddar.  This was so addictive and everyone just loved it with tortilla chips!  Thank You for a great recipe!

Couldn't be any better - this was an easy and flavorful dip. All of my guests commented on how good it was - there were a couple who were eating it with a fork, like it was a salad or something. The only thing I altered was to add a bit more horseradish to kick it up a notch. Anyway, thank you very much for sharing this recipe.

Unfortunately, I didn't have the horseradish, and I think that's why I wasn't too impressed with this. It was good, but that's my fault for leaving out an integral ingredient of the recipe. Shame on me; well, I've just added horseradish to my grocery list. Thanks Ruby, I'll do it right next time.

This turned out to be just "ok."  It wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be and my guests agreed that it was missing something.

I halved the recipe but kept the amount of crabmeat the same. Also added Old Bay seasoning to taste (more than a tsp, less than a tbl) and a few more dashes of tabasco.
It was a big hit!

I made this for a New Orleans themed dinner party and my guests loved it! I made it with canned lump crab and I used 1 full teaspoon of Tabasco. When I make it again, I will probably use 2 teaspoons because I like my food hot. I loved that it was creamy and warm and I served it with Club crackers.

I really did like this, but it tasted (a lot) like cream cheese.  I used the right horseradish, but it didn't have the kick I was expecting.  I will probably add way more horseradish and/or tobasco next time.

This dip was a hit! I took other peoples' suggestions and added 2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning and then added a layer of finely grated cheese before the bread crumbs.  Delicious and a keeper!

I made this for my company christmas party and they liked it, but i had to and more crab to make it taste like it had crab in it and added lemon pepper, gralic and mayo to thin it out a bit because it was to thick to dip on a craker. After all that it was good.

I halved this recipe and put it in mini phyllo shells. Then in the oven til hot. It was very good, but only filled 15 shells (one package). Didn't bother with the bread crumbs,just sprinkled some paprika on top of each.

This isn't really bad, but it's not really good, either. That's why I gave it 3 stars - I feel pretty neutral about it. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a little extra crab and some Old Bay. Even with these additions it was still pretty bland. I also used less onion because 1 onion would be way too much. No one at my party complained, but hardly anyone ate any. Though it's better than some crab dips I have tried, I still won't be making this again.

No complaints about this recipe. It was good - not great. Everyone at my party probably had two/three bites. I added a little more Louisiana to it (cayenne pepper) because it is a very subtle dish and I wanted a bit more spice. Next time I will cut this recipe in half. I had a ton left over.

I was looking for a crab filling to use in fillo cups, noticed this recipe and saw reviewer DECAR48's idea.  Half the recipe, add a bit more hot sauce and leave out the crumbs. Simple, tasty and perfect for guests.  I will be making this again and again.

This was good and very easy to make but I didn't heat it enough and I think it really needs to be hot to be enjoyed. I hollowed out a cob loaf of bread and filled it with the dip and then popped it into the oven wrapped in foil.  I think I was too worried about drying out the bread, hence why I removed the dip before it was hot enough. Wasn't a huge hit but I think that was all my fault. I will try this again.

I made this as an appetizer for Father's Day.  I added an extra can of crab meat and definately took the idea of another suggestion listed to use old bay. The old bay gave a lot of the flavor.  We have a rehersal dinner coming up and I've already been asked to make this dish again!  Its wonderful and definately deserves 5 stars!!!

a pretty good dip.  it was rather thick, for my taste, although my fiance and fellow co-workers enjoyed it.  next time, i will use less onion (as everyone suggests), more hot sauce, and something else to make it less thick.

I made this dip as an appetizer for company. Everone loved it. I thought it was a little to heavy on the horseradish. Therefore only four stars.

This was tasty. Added a lot more hot sauce and Old Bay. I think next time I will use more crab as others suggested, as it wasn't crabby enough for my taste

This was my first attempt at crab dip and I have to say it was a complete success!! I made it for Father's Day and everyone ate and ate and I came home with none! I am from Louisiana and I found this not to be spicy at all and I would probably add some cayenne pepper next time. I added some sharp cheddar cheese, but it didn't need it. Overall very good recipe and will make for many more occasions! Thanks!

I served this dip to my family at a Cajun feast (we originally hail from Lafayette, LA) and everyone went absolutely GA-GA over it!  There was not a drop left.

Yum yum yum!  I made this on New Year's Eve and it was a hit!  The only thing I would do differently is maybe use more hot sauce or red pepper flakes, it wasn't spicy enough for me!
