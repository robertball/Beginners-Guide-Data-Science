I made theirs for my parents when they came to visit and they loved it. I cooked the butternut squash with the mushrooms and added about 3-4 cups of spinach. It came out super yummy!

Made this tonight and we really liked it. Noticed in the recipe there were no directions on when to add the second half of the ricottta. Just layered it as I would with any lasagna. Used the no boil lasagna noodles and they were fine except the top ones were a bit crunchy but that was okay for us.
