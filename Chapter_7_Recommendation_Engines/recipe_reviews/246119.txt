Giving this a 4 only because I made changes.  Reason being, I was happy with my old recipe but wanted to try it in my fairly new pressure cooker.  FASTEST, EASIEST, TASTIEST soup I've ever made from scratch!  
Now for my additions. I added two carrot sticks, finely chopped and a bay leaf.  Also, instead of onion powder, I used two cloves of garlic, pressed in the garlic press.  
I have an electric pressure cooker so I simply set it for high pressure for 30 minutes and let it naturally release the pressure. Consistency was perfect!  Prep time was about 10 min so whole thing was done in about an hour!  SPLIT PEA SOUP IN AN HOUR!  Gotta love the pressure cooker and this recipe!

I followed directions but added two carrots chopped. it was super watery so I added a small bag of instant mashed potatoes and it was awesome. add instant potatoes until you get the consistency you want. I used an electric pressure cooker and set it for 30 minutes. after it finished I also added 1/2 pound of diced boars head tavern ham.

I made this in my instapot pressure cooker. It turned out really watery--- I should have used 2 - 3 cups less water than recommended. I was hoping for more of a creamy, dense soup and the end result was a more traditional broth soup.

This is one of my first attempts using my new Instant Pot and it couldn't have been better. As was recommended, I reduced the liquid to 6 cups and used chicken broth instead of water. I used a frozen-solid block of leftover ham instead of the hock. Also, I added 1/2 cup potato flakes after it was cooked. It made it so creamy and so delicious. This was really easy and definitely a keeper.

Made this in my Instantpot and it turned out great! I did 1.5x the recipe which fiilled the pot almost full. I used 12 cups of water and a 900 g bag of split peas. I added way more garlic powder but otherwise followed pretty closely. The soup ended up being very thick, delicious and creamy. I actually had to add some chicken broth to thin it out to the "perfect" consistency. You can always thin it out but can't make it thicker. I love the Instant Pot and this will be my new split pea recipe!

Love split Pea soup. And this recipe is like ours. Please note my Presto stove top pressure cooker says to never pressure cook split peas. Important, all the recipe say to either quick cool or let pressure drop naturally. About 10 min  If you quick cool you set the cooker in sink and run cold water over it. I've Either done this my Self 100's Of times or watched my mother do It since the 1950's

Mom didn't write down her P.C. recipes, this was spot on. From memory I added 5 peppercorns, bay leaf, baby carrots, and chopped the leafy parts of celery as well as stalks. Also, running water on pressure cooker for rapid pressure release is in the instructions for older cookers. Obviously not for new fangled electric ones which don't seem to work as well.

I used 6 cups of water, 1 chicken bouillon, pork shank instead of hock, crushed garlic instead of powder, 1 carrot diced tiny and 2 bay leaves. (Onions, celery and carrot diced small enough that they disappeared). Upon serving, consistency  seemed spot on. Super yum! Became a gel/solid upon cooling. so 7 cups of water/broth next time. This is an easy to make winner.

What is this madness?  30 minutes cook time?  A half recipe was scorched black on the bottom in less than 20 minutes.  Started over and tried again, half recipe was done in 5 minutes.  Can't believe full recipe would take 6 times as long.

I made the Split Pea soup with smoked ham hocks.  We will have it for dinner.  Smells amazing.  I cooked it in my new Ninja Foodi Pressure setting 30 minutes.

Made the recipe exactly as written. DELICIOUS and EASY. I was a little concerned when I opened it because it seemed very thin.  When I got it out of the refrigerator the next day and reheated it, it was the perfect consistency, thick but not wall-paper paste. So easy and so good. I used diced ham instead of the ham hock.

Just burned my mouth! LOL  This is a great recipe. I always dislike it when people change the recipe and then rate it. This recipe would be wonderful, just as written. Did I change anything? Always do, because I love fresh garlic over powder, bay leaves, and shredded carrot.  Other than that, I'm a Kosher salt lover, I know, BAD.....but the flavor is amazing! Oh, and no hot sauce needed for me.

This turned out really well, nice and thick just like on the stove. I particularly liked how the carrots retained their shape and didn't turn to mush. I did not have any thyme on hand, so used "Mural of Flavor" from Penzey's spices, and it turned out very nice. I also did not add any salt because I thought it would have enough salt from the ham hocks, but found that the salt was necessary. I added it to the individual bowl of soup, allowing each person to  salt to their own taste. I will make again.

I prepared the soup following the recipe as written.  I found that it was way to watery and came out more like a pea soup broth. The flavor was there but I would recommend cutting the liquid in half.  The next day I added another package of peas to the soup and finished it on my stove top.   Very tasty and had the consistency of what I expected when making pea soup after adding another package of peas.

I agree with the other reviewers who suggested using a couple of cups less of liquid.  I used the broth left from the chicken I'd cooked yesterday.  I also added a couple of fixed carrots for color.  

I used the saute feature to boil out some of the liquid.  I have used this trick with my traditional recipe, but the soup would often scroch.  This was quick with easy clean up.

This was my 2nd stab at this recipe.  The first time I followed it, though added chopped carrots and garlic, plus bay leaf.  Came out great!

Today, our vegetarian daughter requested I make it for her.  Followed the recipe, once again adding carrots, bay leaf and LOTS of garlic for her, replaced the ham hock with 2 tsp of smoked liquid.  Just as good!

I used 7 cups of water instead of 8 because others had said it turned out watery. I used a pound of cubed ham instead of a ham bone. Used my InstantPot instead of a stove top pressure cooker and it turned out great. 30 minutes on high pressure and natural pressure release for about 15 minutes.

I am new to cooking with a pressure cooker.  This is the first recipe I made, and it was simply delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as written (except for the hot sauce).  It took less than an hour from start to finish.

I made this without the celery and only used 6 cups of water.  When it was finished I added a small amount of powdered mashed potato.  Absolutely delicious.  I threw in some homemade croutons from whole wheat grain bread to top it off.

I left out the onion and celery as my husband hates those. I added carrots and a potato, along with marjoram, garlic powder, and sage. It was watery at first so I let it sit for a while on the counter and it thickened up nicely.

This was good.  Easy to put together.  I added some cooked bacon because I didn't have  enough ham.  This makes a lot of soup but it freezes well.

Easy and delicious.  I added a bay leaf, allspice, and a dash of rosemary.  Used pork chops, sautéed in the Instant Pot, instead of whatever meat was called for in the recipe.  Pork chops were all I had, and the soup turned out just fine.  Used 4c vegetable broth and 4c water.  Added carrots.  Bottom line, it’s a yummy and forgiving recipe.  A keeper, definitely.

I used the instant pot pressure cooker, added celery and turned out very good. Used green split peas , still very good!

Made a few changes. Added two bay leaves, 1 lb of cubed cooked ham, and used 4 cups chicken broth and 2 cups of water. Perfect consistency and delicious. I also like to add a drizzle of balsamic glaze just before eating.

We used Manishewitz soup mix combo of split pea and minestrone along with a huge bone from a Honey Baked Ham and the onion,celery and carrots as called for.  It was wonderful and just gets better as it ages, although it won’t be around too long.

I made this recipe with some ham that I had leftover.  The only thing I added was some diced carrots.  It tasted great.  The cooking time was fine.  And a nice soup made within an hour.  That was awesome!

Added a couple of chopped carrots.  Excellent taste.  Suggest reducing by 2 cups liquid if you like your pea soup thicker.

How did mine go?
I should have stuck to my minced garlic, chopped onions & celery sauteed in butter with chunks of smoked ham, some thyme, a bay leaf and home made chicken stock or low sodium chicken broth.
All in all, I wouldn't use this recipe again.

Very easy and tasty.  I have made it several times now with and without the ham hock, with homemade stock and with packaged broth.    Smoked paprika works well with it as does a squirt of  sriracha.  I do find the consistency better with only about 14 oz. of split peas or an extra cup of liquid.

My mother-in-law, who never eats leftovers, actually had this 2 nights in a row! The only change I made was to add chopped carrots. It was so smooth and creamy - definitely not watery as a couple others have said. I will make this again.

Best split pea soup I have ever made.  New pressure cooker for 
Christmas, so learning how to use it.  This soup recipe is a keeper.  Will definitely make it again.

Excellent split pea soup! Added a little chopped carrot and a few shakes of cumin. My 3 year old actually asked for seconds!
