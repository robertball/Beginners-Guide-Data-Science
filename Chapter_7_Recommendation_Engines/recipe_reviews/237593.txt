This is my recipe, I wanted to substitute the vigo brand yellow rice leaving out all the preservatives.  I often substitute fresh onions and garlic maybe throw in some peppers into this dish, honestly it is what I have on hand.  I do however recommend to  adding salt/pepper to your taste, especially the pepper.  A nice twist is to add fresh cilantro, parsley or chives after cooking.  It is hard to put recipes out there to be reviewed, I mostly put this up so I could remember how much spice to use when I make it.  Remember cooking is not a science, you have to taste/smell what you are making instead of blindly following a recipe.

A great starter foundation to build upon but a little nondescript as is.  It needed a little pizzazz.   I saut√©ed chopped red and green bell pepper with some red onion (instead of dried onion) and minced garlic (instead of garlic powder).  Now we're talking!  As this recipe's first reviewer I'm pleased to be the first to say this is a  lovely rice dish, full of great flavor and beautiful color, and it would look great alongside anything you'd care to serve with it. Hubs couldn't stop raving (which he didn't do about the fish and green beans that were also on his plate...)

I started with this recipe as the base. From my experience I could tell ti needed more spice to get that real yellow rice taste. I added a  packet of Goya Sazon and also 1 tsp of Adobo seasoning. I subbed out the dried onions for 6 green onions and a teaspoon of onion powder and added a 1/2 teaspoon of paprika.  It was restaurant quality and have saved this as the base for all my yellow rice dishes !!

This is such a great basic yellow rice recipe! I love it just as it is. However,I did add the red onion and sweet bell peppers this time as naples34102 suggested and then I added 1 tsp of oregano...this all added a delicious kick!

Great way to make the packaged "yellow rice" at home without all the fake ingredients!  We like this with tacos.

The texture and color of the rice was great.  The flavor, however, needs some work.  I would suggest using chicken broth instead of water, and dialing back the turmeric to 1/2 tsp. and the pepper to 1/4 tsp.

I made this but used low sodium vegetable stock instead of water and left out the salt. It was amazingly yellow and pretty darn tasty!

This was really a good basic side dish. My grandson kept saying it was his favorite kind thinking it was saffron rice. Next time I will use chicken stock for the water for a little more flavor. I tossed in a tablespoon of butter when I fluffed it to guild the lily. Very good and turmeric is way cheaper than saffron. It's a keeper.

I sauteed some onion and red pepper which I added to the rice & water.  Used garlic powder, salt, pepper...  It came a beautiful color and it was certainly easy.

Wonderful! Thanks for the recipe. I wanted to eat more Turmeric for its possible health benefits. The glowing rice goes very well with the heat & eat curries I like to buy. It also works with fresh onions and in rice cooker as someone suggested. I may be inspired to make my own curry to go with it!

This was really good. I had to substitute the tumeric for ground cumin and pinch of ginger because I didn't have any.  At the end I added a rinsed and drained can of black beans and corn and then mixed in about 2-3 tsp of lime juice and topped with some cilantro.  Also left out the pepper as my little ones don't appreciate it :) next time I think I'll cook the rice in chicken broth instead of rice. This was a really nice side dish. Thanks!

Thanks for a quick, great recipe! I tried this one night when I did not have any yellow rice on hand for enchilada night! That's a must for my family! Found this recipe and decided to give it a try! Kids loved it so much, they want it this way every time!

My family loves this rice. The only request from my children is to cut the black pepper a bit, and they do like spicy things, so that gives an idea of how spicy it is. Delicious!

This is delicious!  I replaced the water with Swanson chicken broth, and used one and a half cups of rice.  I always use 3/4c of rice to every 1c of liquid.  But I use a rice cooker, so that may have something to do with my ratio?  I used butter rather than oil, and used a teaspoon of onion powder rather than the minced onions.  I left out the pepper.  Soooooo good!!!!  No more buying Goya yellow rice mix anymore... this was the identical flavor!!!!

This is excellent. I too wanted to replace the Vigo/mahatma packaged rice packs with something homemade to avoid the nasty additives(MSG). I used fresh onion and garlic instead of the dried stuff and replaced the water with chicken broth. Tasty enough to be eaten alone. Yum!

Great recipe, although, it was alot of pepper.  Next time I think 1/4th teaspoon would be plenty.  Thanks for the alternative to the box!

Good as it is but a great starting place if you are willing to do a little more work. Chop up some fresh onion, fresh garlic and add some spice. I like adding curry best.

Also a great way to use up a leftover protein. Dice up that leftover ham or steak and shred that chicken.

A little bland, but it made an excellent base for the curry I'd made.  I put all the ingredients in my rice cooker rather than doing it on the stovetop.  Very easy!  I would definitely make this again; if I were serving it as a side on its own I'd want to jazz it up a little with some stronger spices & garlic.

Pretty good! I made a few changes to this simple recipe. I first sauteed half a minced onion, half a green pepper and 1 tsp of minced garlic in olive oil. Afterwards, I added the spices and water. I had a can of Goya salchichas and added them as well. Next time, I will add a little less salt and tumeric. I served it with chili lime chicken thighs from Cafedelites website. Easy and delish!

I‚Äôve made this at least 4 times since finding it a few months ago! My boyfriend requests this dish. We usually always eat the rice with some form of slow cooker curry, so we‚Äôve never eaten it alone, but I can at least attest that this, served alongside a main dish, is absolutely delicious! Plus it‚Äôs so simple! No end in sight for making it in our household!

This rice dish is delicious.  My family says it‚Äôs the best rice I ever made.  Always have to double this and it is compatible with meat, fish or poultry dishes .

Great for someone who is just starting in the kitchen. After reading some comments about adding more seasoning, peppers, chicken broth, etc... I will definitely be trying that as well. Besides all that, the recipe is great on its own.

Really good but heavy on pepper for us. I‚Äôd cut it back to 1/4 tsp. next time. I made it in my Instant Pot. I  saut√©d about 1/2 c. onion until soft, added the rice and spices right at the end and saut√©ed for 1-2 min. Then added the water, stirred and cooked on rice setting. Used natural release for 10 min. Good to go. I‚Äôll make it again just with less pepper.

I made this recently when I ran out of Vigo Yellow Rice and couldn‚Äôt find it in the rural area I live in. The only thing I would do differently is add a little less pepper (too much in this recipe for my liking). It was otherwise amazing and I  definitely make it again!

I don't measure much and I double the recipe. It turned out really good. I had a bag of the pre-mixed yellow rice but I needed so much more so I just made this recipe instead of adding white rice and whatnot to it I'm glad I did very interesting recipe.  It goes well with teriyaki chicken stir-fry

This is a decent starter recipe. I usually use a small onion and garlic. I don't change a whole lot because usually I'm making this rice to put in tacos. With taco seasoned ground beef on top, it's really good!

This was fantastic! I substituted onions with a teaspoon of onion powder (thought I had one left but I was wrong!), but it went very well with a Mexican style slow cooker shredded chicken recipe. It has the right flavor for Spanish style dishes! I've been looking for a quick yellow rice recipe for when I don't have time to make a traditional one, and I finally found it with this recipe!

We really like the recipe, except for all of the black pepper. For my family I have to reduce the black pepper to about 1/4 tsp.

If you use broth instead of water in rice recipe, I recommend decreasing the amount of salt to 1/2 tsp. I like using broth but think next time I will decrease the salt. We may also use just 1/2 tsp of pepper as well to decrease the kick.

I LOVE this recipe as a starter. Just like Cindy said in her comment, you really need to adjust your cooking to your tastes. I like to sautee a bell pepper, onion, and a few cloves of garlic in the pan before adding all of the other ingredients. I use all of the spices listed in the recipe, though I do scale the black pepper way back because the amount called for is way too spicy for the kids. (Black pepper is necessary in this recipe if you want the health benefits of the turmeric.) I also throw in cumin and oregano. Toward the end I throw in some Spanish olives (you know, the green ones with pimentos). One of my best friends grew up in Puerto Rico and another grew up in Cuba and they both add Spanish olives to their rice and their roasts as they cook. I LOVE the flavor this imparts! This recipe is so easy, healthy, and flavorful! Thanks for sharing, Cindy!!

The recipe calls for way too much pepper for my family‚Äôs taste. My daughter asked me to make my yellow rice and black beans for her Spanish class project. I usually use the packaged stuff, but I didn‚Äôt have enough for her whole class, so I searched for the recipe. I‚Äôve done this before with another recipe and my family loved it, but I didn‚Äôt save that recipe unfortunately. The other recipe used chicken broth so I substituted that for the water, and cut the salt in half. I only used a quarter of the pepper that this recipe calls for, and it was still to peppery. Next time I‚Äôll only use a pinch.

Yes, I made this, loosely based with some fresh veggies, sweet pepper, carrot, celery, mushroom, onion, garlic powder, turmeric, using some "better than chicken broth" type of thing, I made with 3 cups water, 1-1/2 cup basmati rice.  I saut√©ed the veggies in a bit of olive oil first.  Added a bit of dried parsley and thyme, a couple strands of saffron too.  This was fast, quick cooking and very tasty.

Way, way, wayyy too much onion! That's all I taste. Really too much of everything. Too much turmeric, too much salt, too much garlic, too much black pepper. Plus no mention of sweet bell pepper flakes. After one bite, the flavor was strong and lingering in my mouth, very difficult to get rid of, and not pleasant tasting at all. I made this for my husband's lunch at 7am, in a big hurry. No changing it, now. He's going to be stuck with it. Sorry, hubby!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and my rice is more of a brownish color instead of yellow however, it does taste good but next time I'll use less pepper. Just a little bit too spicy for my palate, also I think a little bit more water is necessary as I noticed some of the rice is not completely done.

This is si simple yet really adds to any dish you have with rice. I didn‚Äôt have onion flakes but put a Thai dish over the rice that had onion in it. Delicious! Also a good way to add turmeric to your diet.

Made 1/2 batch using chicken broth and changed the salt and pepper to 1/4 tsp.  At that level the salt was fine.  However I should have used all the onion called for in the full recipe.  So I think definitely chicken broth, half the salt and double the onion.

I saute onion & garlic, sub chicken stock for the water, and add  half can of rotel, drained. When the rice is finished, I add peas. A great accompaniment to roasted chicken (or just add  chicken into the rice). This recipe is a good "canvas" to create your own rice dish.

Love this recipe! Was in a pinch to cook something quick and I had everything I needed already at home. Will definitely be adding this to my vegetarian recipe arsenal.

I love this yellow rice recipe.  I have made it several times for my family.  The only ingredient I leave out is the onions and I cook it in a rice cooker.

Like everyone before me said it is a great base recipe. The only thing I did was use fresh minced onion, garlic powder because I let my garlic dry out and I added cumin, goya sazon, and goya adobo. I also doubled the recipe and instead of all olive oil I used half unsalted butter. Next time I will add green chilies it is really good in the boxed so I know it will be great with home-made yellow rice.

I found this to be perfect for chicken and rice.  My family loves this and I feel good about making it from scratch to avoid boxed or bagged versions.  It is delicious and my guys gobble it up every time I make it.

Way too much black pepper called for! Thankfully I cut it back, but was still too much. Will use 1/4 tsp next time. Also will use chicken broth instead of just water. Otherwise a good recipe.

Excellent replacement for the boxed stuff. Followed that advice of some other reviewers and added saut√©ed onion and red pepper, and subbed vegetable broth for the water. Next time I will reduce the pepper to 1/2 tsp. I'll never buy the boxed stuff again!

This was great! I doubled the recipe added a whole chopped red onion (about medium size) instead of the dried onion and about 6-7 cherry tomatoes, and added half the around of black pepper, but I did everything else the same. I put this all in the rice cooker, mixed it, and cooked it on the white rice setting. It takes about 30 minutes. Once it's done, you may need to mix it a little more because some of the onions stay on top. I'm not much of an onion person but they were really good in this recipe. Everyone loved this rice and I will definitely make it again!

Great base & so much better than those little yellow packets I usually buy. And a lot less sodium. I also added saut√©ed onion &  peppers & used a half cup of broth from some pulled pork I had in the crock pot, used it to replace the same amount of water.I had a few threads of saffron on hand that I  threw in, gave it a nice aroma & flavor. It was the highlight  of the meal. But so easy. You can't go wrong with this!

I used Chicken broth for more flavor and reduce salt by half. Could have reduced to 1/4, but was still very good and tasty. Might reduce Turmeric a little next time. Still LOVED it.

Much, much too peppery for us (although it helped clear up my congested sinuses, so that's good).  Like other reviewer, will halve pepper and salt next time.  Used 1 tsp of onion powder instead of minced.  I like the idea of adding red and green bell pepper.

I love this for a base. I usually double the recipe, add a can of diced tomatoes, a can of pigeon peas, and about a pound of diced pork loin. It's a hit at my house.

It was ok; too peppery for my taste. Will probably make again, as it's very easy and I always have the ingredients on hand, but will probably halve the salt & pepper.

as is, i'm not sure i would have liked this recipe.. but with naples34102's modifications this came out pretty tasty!  my additions/modifications included the following for half a recipe: 1 clove garlic (will do 2 next time), 1/4 green bell pepper, 1/4 orange bell pepper, 1/4 red onion, and half water/half homemade broth for the liquid.. no dried minced onion or garlic powder.. i'll cut the pepper in half next time as i agree with katmurra's children that it's a little much.. i tried a bit of lime over some of the rice and really enjoyed it.. ty for the recipe
