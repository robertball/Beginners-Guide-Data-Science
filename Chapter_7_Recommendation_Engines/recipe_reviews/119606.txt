This recipe was the bomb!   My husband and I just loved it.  The only thing I did different was I used ground turkey and a larger can of diced tomatoes instead of the smaller can of crushed.  Also, to make it a bit healthier I used only half of the amount of butter and flour.   The soup was still very flavorful but with half the calories and fat.  Thanks Sandra for for giving my family such a superb recipe!

I've never written a review on here but I thought I would write one for this recipe.  The soup came out better than expected.  I used cabbage instead of celery (because that's what I had) and 2 cans of chicken broth - low sodium and 1 cup of water with some chicken bouillon cubes to try to make up for the third.  I didn't have a small can of crushed tomatoes so I put in a large (14.5oz) can of diced tomatoes w/ mushroom and garlic. I added a few shakes of cayenne and 2 diced potatoes and it still came out really good.  I didn't do the second step (the thickening) but I think it was top notch without it.  I had never had/made a soup with hamburger meat but this one is a keeper. As soon as my husband ate a spoonful he said "Mmm... this is really good, I hope you remember this recipe!"

Really tastey soup.  I browned the burger then, after draining, added it to the other ingredients in a crock pot.  I also added some diced potatoes and chopped cabbage (personal preference).  It simmered all night and is a wonderful soup.  I didn't add the thickening and am not sure whether it is really needed.  The consistency without is that of a vegetable soup.

Very tasty.  My husband called and asked what was for dinner, and when I told him "hamburger soup," there was a pause, after which he asked me if he should pick something up on his way home.  He ended up really liking it, and asked me to put it on our regular repetoire.  I added a little less (low-sodium) chicken broth (32 oz), and found that it turned out just fine.  I also didn't have any hot sauce, so I put in a few shakes of cayenne pepper (not too much, or my 3 year old wouldn't eat it).  Flavors blended nicely, and I'm looking forward to making it again.

I hate to register on websites (tons of junk mail) but I just had to register here so I could come and write a review for this specific recipe. I found this recipe months and months ago and we have used it at least once a month! This is a staple meal in our family. I'm sure my son will go off to college and come home to ask for this meal. Thanks for taking the time to share this recipe with us!

This recipe is awesome!  Just like my grandma used to make!  We added two potatoes and also used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of crushed tomatoes (instead of one of crushed)....but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee.  My fiance said he kept thinking to himself... "what could make this better" but couldn't think of a thing.  Very tasty!

This soup was great.  I did add two cans of diced tomatoes just out of personal preference and because it was on hand. I have made this soup more than once, and we love it! Apart from a little quick chopping, it is not time-consuming, and it lends itself well to leftovers if you're not feeding a small army as we are. It's really a keeper, especially for lunch on cold winter days!

I was looking for a soup recipe to use up my leftover meatloaf and chose this one.  I substituted meatloaf for plain ground beef and omitted the butter and flour to reduce the fat.  It was good.  My finicky children  gobbled it right up and my husband kept saying how good it was and took the leftovers to work the next day.  I'll be making this one again!

This is really good soup! I followed the recipe except I used crushed red pepper instead of hot sauce, because that's what I had. For anyone thinking of leaving out the "thickening"...don't! If you follow the directions and actually cook the butter/flour mixture until it is browned, it adds a wonderful rich flavor as well as acting as a thickener.

Though this was pretty good... I found it was sensational after adding lots of shredded cabbage, cubed raw potatoes, frozen corn, frozen lima beans, frozen green beans, extra canned tomatoes, beef broth instead of chicken, a little basil and oregano..  all in portions to suit your taste, but better if it's nice and thick like a stew.  Simmer in large pot for 45 minutes to one hour. Tastes GREAT..  and it's even better the next day! Double the recipe and you can freeze meal sized portions for quick, hot meal paired with a nice grean sald and crusty bread in the middle of the week without all the mess and fuss.

I had my doubts about this soup when I got everything in the pan, it just did not look appealing at all and if it didn't look appealing the kids weren't going to touch it. But after it simmered awhile it's appearance reminded me somewhat of a minestrone soup. Having a large family I did add a bit extra to stretch the soup out. I used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and along with the 2 cans of chicken broth I added 2 cans of vegetable broth. I also added some chopped zuccini and some italian parsley from the garden. There was no need for the flour and margarine. All 5 kids and the hubby approved, even the 7 year old fussy eater ate and asked for more!

This was WONDERFUL!!  I made it exactly as it said except I added a large can of tomato (on accident).  It still tasted excellent.  I added some potatoes and peas that I had on hand.  I cooked the beef with the onion and garlic and then threw everything in the crock pot for 8 hours.  The whole house smells great and the family is pleased and stuffed!

This was so good! Great for the chilly nights, or any night! I did not change anything to the flavor, but I did add some elbow macaroni. I only used half of the butter/flour mixture. Will DEFINATELY make again!!!

Very tasty!!  I only omitted the flour/butter mixture because I wanted it 'thin' and not thick and the pepper sauce because I didn't have that on hand.  Did add some salt/pepper while simmering.  Served it with some shredded cheddar cheese and saltine crackers!  This is a keeper on my menu, thanks for sharing!

I used up some old raw hamburger patties from a party the night before.  Added jarred garlic, organic carrots, a little celery, organic onion.   Also some braising greens and mushrooms.  Sauteed all that up added a few sprigs of fresh marjoram, let it simmer for a bit until the vegetable were tender.  Then added a can of canneloni beans, and the chicken stock, and Worcestershire sauce and hot pepper sauce.  Also added about a tablespoon of dried basil and some red pepper flakes.  Ixnay on the flour paste... it's perfect without the "gravy" which I think would serve to make it heavy and thick.  I really liked this version, and so did my family.

Delicious and healthy.  Can't say enough.  I used ground turkey (heated EVOO first, 2T.sp.).  There is no need to add the flour at the end...you want it thin since it's a soup!  I did find myself adding some salt as it was a bit bland....also added lots of fresh ground pepper and dried parsley. I cooked some eggshell pasta on the side (would have preferred elbow but didn't have it) in chicken stock, drained and allowed my guest (aka boyfriend haha) to add what he wanted to make it more filling.  I had 3 pieces of buttered bread with one bowl! lol  Yummy  Bet it will be even better tomrrow...we're each taking leftovers for lunch...everyone at work will be jealous!  Boyfriend said he's excited to eat it again tomorrow:)  Dinner and lunch for two people not bad for one pot.  Tomorrow is here and I'm updating....the soup is FAR better the next day!

This is filling and warming, and the kids all liked it. Personally, I found it a bit bland. It's also quite oily, and that's after cutting the fat (I used oil instead of margarine). To make it healthier use ground chicken rather than beef, and throw in a few potatoes to have a meal-in-one.

Very similar to one of my "stand by" soups! We call it "Orange Soup". Only thing different with mine is 1 cup of grated instead of diced carrot, 1/4 of Uncle Bob's soup mix (a mixture of dried legumes), no flour in my version, 1 28 ounce can of Habitant Vegetable Soup and I add 2 cups of coleslaw mix from the produce section!

I've been making this for years. I add potatoes and shredded cabbage as well. I use beef broth instead of chicken and tomato juice and let it cook away. I never thicken it. 
BTW, roux should always be equal parts butter and flour. NEVER margarine. 
Hmm now I know what to make for dinner on Monday. Thanks for reminding me.

You can't screw this up!  Just add your favorite veggies and you're good to go.  You can also add some unrinsed, dry barley to thicken it, the amount depends on how thick you like your soup.  This is a very old dish, from the depression according to my Grandma, when people really had to stretch their dollars.

Good flavor. I did not thicken it, so didn't use the butter or flour. I did add some corn and basil. Simple and quick. Thanks. My family loves it. Lots more flavor on the second day.

I really liked this soup. but I omitted the whole thickening part and didn't use the flour and margarine to save some on calories. I used slightly less onion too, and fresh tomatoes instead of canned since I had those that needed to be used up.

Definitely a keeper. I love making soup during the winter and it typically gives you leftovers to take to work for lunch during the week. My husband didn't even bother to leave me any leftovers of this recipe. That's okay though...he just helps me with my ratings when he does such things. :-)

I make this exact soup without the worcestershire sauce and I have never used the butter and flour. To thicken it I use a little tomato paste

This is an awesome soup that is easily "tweaked" for ingredients you have on hand. I omit the tomatoes in favor of tomato sauce. I also add quick cooking barley in the last 30 min of cooking to thicken it up a bit. So delicious! Great cold night soup!

Mmmmmm Good....I did not have crushed tomatoes I only had diced with flavoring for chili, and I used turkey burger. I also used potato fingerlings. This is so yummy and easy to make. Family loved it....now that is something when the whole family loves it.

This was a very tasty soup.  My family always prefers chicken based soups over beef.  I added alphabet noodles to make it more appealing to the kids.

Everytime I make something new I ask my husband if I should add it to the regular rotation.  He said not so much on this soup.  I'm actually the only one who finished her bowl tonight.  
I will admit to not having any hot sauce.  Aside from that though, I did not deviate from the recipe.  After reading other's reviews maybe I should have by adding potatoes or not adding the thickener... I don't know.  It just wasn't that great.

I have not tried it yet. It smells very good. I just need to know what I did wrong.  I used the butter and flour and the consistency was like pie dough. Needless to say when I put it in the soup there were big lumps.

I suck at cooking but I am trying to learn. ANY ideas/suggestions will be appreciated.  Thanks!

Can't seem to bring myself to use chicken broth with beef.  Used Beef broth instead, but this recipe is missing a great deal of flavor.  Just sayin.

First snow of the season today so this soup sounded good. It is delicious! I made is as written except for the roux and I used a quart of home-canned tomatoes. 

I can think of some interesting variations that I want to try like maybe adding some elbow mac to it (like Mema used to do) and maybe browning the meat with taco seasoning, adding corn, and garnishing with tortilla strips for a tortilla soup (& some cornbread). Can't wait to have it again!

A surprise 2 night visit from the in-laws prompted me to look up a recipe using ground beef. These folks think tacos are "fancy," so I try to keep it simple. This recipe has enough flavors to satisfy me and is basic enough not to scare the in-laws. It was quick to make starting at 8:45 p.m. on a Sunday so they'd have something for lunch tomorrow. I just had a little dish and it's delicious! I used beef broth instead of chicken and butter. Yummy!

I can't stand when people TOTALLY change a recipe and then review it.  That said, I did TWEAK this recipe because I knew there wouldn't be enough flavor for my husband and my taste if I didn't.  So...based on my tweaking I would give it 5 stars...it was just that good!  SO TASTY.  I did only 1 lb. of beef (trying to cut down) which I salted and peppered as I browned.  I did about 1 and 1/2 cup onions (2 seemed excessive)  I did 1 and 1/2 cups of the carrots and celery to make up for using less beef.  I did 3 tablespoons worcestershire sauce and 1 tablespoon of hot peppersauce (I'll use even more next time...wasn't spicy AT ALL even though I tripled the amount).  With these changes we REALLY enjoyed this soup!  And it's so economical.  I'm making it again tonight but I'm trying ground turkey.  Oh, one more thing...the flour/butter ratio can't be right!  Either use less flour or more butter...I ended up having to add marjarine because there was no way it was ever going to mix to a "smooth" consistency.  I had to add a whole stick of marjarine!  Next time I'll try just using 1/4 cup flour.

The soup was looking great til I added the roux.  That made it way too thick too fast.  It's more like a chili now than a soup.  I had to add a 28 oz tin of diced tomatoes to try to balance things out again. The soup had good flavour, but we like it a bit zippier so I did play with the spices as well.  Overall though, the thickness of the soup spoiled it for me.

This soup was fantastic!  I did make a couple of changes however.  Instead of crushed tomatoes I used diced, this made the soup lest pasty.  Also, to cut down on the calories I didn't put in the margarine or flour.  Even with these items left out, the soup was fantastic!

This was great--a very filling, complete meal with a bun on the side.  I added closer to equal parts butter & flour for the roux at the end, because I was worried the flour wouldn't mix with less butter.  My soup turned out quite thick and hearty.  I wouldn't change a thing for the flavour, and even though I generally don't like tabasco sauce it works nicely in this recipe.

Not bad. I made it with tons of onions, mushrooms and carrots. However, I wish it was more spicier. I added red pepper flakes and a ton of hot sauce, but it wasnt spicy enough for me, but I just love spice. I also added pasta noodles because it felt a little thin to me, now its a thick stew kind of dish. I dig it, made a ton, I'll have leftovers for a while! :)

This is delicious, and so easy.  I added some edamame and other veggies.  It is very forgiving.  I have made it several times, each time following the recipe exactly but adding things I had on hand, such as left over corn, a handful of leftover rice, and edamame from my freezer.

This is a great recipe.  A couple of changes I made were,using 2 cans of Tomato Sauce, 1 can of tomato paste, adding cabbage (a mix of Savoy and Regular Green Cabbage) and then adding a can of Ro-tel Original.  I used the Ro-tel in place of the hot sauce and it worked well.  I always like to make extra so it has worked well so now I will freeze the rest for future use.  But the feeback was good.  Enjoyed with a couple of slices of Dutch Crunch Bread and a nice Pinot Noir.

This was really delicious. My kids weren't sure about it but when they ate it they loved it. What's really great about this recipe is you have the freedom to add whatever you like. My mom used to make this when I was a kid. Everyone should really try this be creative and have fun this recipe can handle it!!!

Pretty good!  I didn't have any onion or celery.  I used onion seasoning and it turned out a lot better than I thought it would.  My family really liked it.

this was sooooo good. even my picky son liked it. I did what a couple people said and added diced potatoes and at the last minute decided to throw in some frozen corn that I had on hand. Served it with warm french bread. This is definitely a keeper.

I have been making hamburger soup in the pressure cooker for years. I add a bit of long grain rice, stewed tomatoes and whatever vegetables I have on hand, mainly onion, potatoes, celery and potatoes. Very comforting on a cold day.

I cannot begin to tell you how well this turned out.  As I was making it, I thought, "Well, this can't be enough ingredients to give much flavor."  So, I improvised and added some basil, oregano and red chili pepper flakes.  I also used the large can of crushed tomatoes.  I also added barley simply because I had bought some a year ago but had no idea when/where to use it.  Last night gave me the perfect opportunity.  Wow!  I didn't even need to make the roux because the crushed tomatoes and the barley thickened up the soup nicely.  I literally cannot wait until this batch is gone, so that I can make it again with potatoes and macaroni this time!!!  I am VERY, VERY picky when it comes to flavor, so thank you, Sandra, for a recipe that will always be a favorite!!!

I followed the recipe..sort've.  Added about a quarter cup of red wine for flavour.  For thickening I use instant potatoes with success.
This recipe I will use again.  For taste and simplicity.  Yummy.

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding salt and pepper to taste near the end.  This was excellent!  You could add potatoes, noodles, barley, etc. if you wanted, but it was great without anything added.  I did have my doubts and the hubby said he "wasn't going to eat hamburger & water soup".  Well, he was into the leftovers before me today.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Followed instructions with two exceptions: beef stock (it's what I had) and tortellini at the end.  The entire pot was gone at lunch, so much for having it again for dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good for a quick and easy soup. Not spectacular, but tasty. I made it just like the posted recipe except for halving the butter and four, which was fine.

Delicious! The first time I made it I accidentally grabbed soy sauce, instead of Worcestershire sauce out of the fridge and used that. It was still yummy! Today I am making it the right way.

This soup was way better than I expected.  I did have to add a few herbs (oregano, parsley, chili powder) because I thought it was a bit bland at first.  My husband has already asked for me to make it again!

Okay, I don't like tomato based soups, never have. But my husband requested tomato mac soup. I made this recipe almost word for word (I added a few spices from the cupboard) and it was FABULOUS! I made whole wheat macaroni on the side for those who like it that way. Definitely a keeper! Thank you.

This is a good base recipe.  I only gave it 3 stars because I made a LOT of changes, since the original recipe as written seemed as though it needed some livening up.  I didn't include many of the ingredients listed (no garlic, no hot pepper sauce, no celery, no flour).  I added a lot more W. sauce (probably around 2/3 cup, give or take).  I also added about a can of tomato soup.  I also added lots of spices (cajun, pepper, onion powder, chili powder, garlic salt) to the meat after I browned it (we like our soups with some kick!). I also added half a packet of beef stew seasoning.  And, let's see, I think the last change I made was to include cooked noodles in the soup.  A nice, wide egg noodle.  Made it look great, and sorta pulled it together.  

Great basic recipe, though--obviously there's a good foundation to build on it and really make it yours. We will definitely be having it again (well, my version).

I don't usually like vegetable beef soup, but this was good. Tastes a lot better than it smells. I added a pack of yellow rice mix just because I felt it needed something else. Like other reviewers, I didn't see the need to add the thickener.

This soup is wonderful!!! The only thing I changed the second time I made it was to use lower-sodium broth. It was too salty with regular. Otherwise, it is AWESOME!!

With the crushed tomatoes, it ended up tasting more like canned tomato soup.  Fair, but not overly impressed. Will not make again.

This is a great recipe and I have made it a few times now.  You don't need the flour and butter though.  I just added a handful of pasta near the end and it turned out great in my crock pot.

This was delicious.  I omitted the rue & added some wide egg noodles, as some other readers suggested and it was good.  I think I'll add the rue next time to see how it works.

4 stars for the unchanged recipe. I added 1 1/2 tsps. dried basil, 1/2 tsp. thyme and 2 tsps. Lawry's seasoning salt. Perfect taste for me! 5 stars with these seasonings. I also added some macaroni noodles to it instead of the roux.

I have made this soup with chicken broth and the with beef broth. Both were good. I did not do the flour and see no need for it. I add frozen peas and corn. Some times egg noodles, black beans etc.  I see no reason not to put mixed veggies in this. It is very good and easy to make. I always brown the burger well in a cast iron pan. I think that is crucial. 
The dog gets a cup every night on her dry food. It is good for her and cheaper than canned junk dog food.

Finally - a new soup to add to my "repeat list"!!
Thank you so very very much - husband went back for 2nd's and could barely keep the soup out of his mouth - "Boy, this is a winner!!" says he.
Not to shabby for a 65 year old to finally enjoy something new huh?!  The soup is delicious just as printed!

I followed the recipe provided and found that the taste was very bland.  I nearly didn't want to eat the leftovers the next day.  However, I ended up adding more ingredients and added crackers and hot sauce to my bowl.  Hubby added crackers and some ketchup to his.  This made the soup more flavorful.  

Don't know that I will make this again just because there are so many outstanding soups out there.

This soup reminds me of the flavor of Campbells Pork & Beans soup. It is delicious. I had a problem getting the butter/flour to dissolve, blend and thicken the soup. However, that was fixable.

I'm sorry to say this was very bland. I think I should have browned the meat first to get some browned bits in the pan. I doctored it up with Italian seasonings and more Worcestershire sauce. It helped some but I won't make again.

well....it was good but won't be a favorite. I did add 2 medium diced potatoes and there either was not enough margarine or too much flour. I ended up adding more marg. to get the smooth consistancy. Had I not done that, the mixture was thick and lumpy. I probably used closer to a full stick of marg/butter. Waiting to see what the husband thinks.

I made this soup pretty much exactly as directed except for one change and that is I can't have real flour and I used a gluten-free one but otherwise followed it to the tee.  My husband and I thought it was just OK, not great.  We ate it but I probably won't make it again.

I followed the recipe almost exact, but I didn't have any fresh carrots or celery off hand (it has been pouring rain for the past 3 days straight) so I poured in 1/2 pound of frozen veggies peas, baby carrots, corn, and green beans. I also put in a small salad macaroni for bite. The smell of the Worcestshire sauce is a bit overwhelming, but it really does taste great. Also omitted the thickening, just because I added pasta. :-)

We loved this soup!  I went by the recipe, except I added a diced zucchini, and I had 2 lbs. of meat, so I adjusted other ingredients accordingly.  I also halved the thickener, because I served homemade croutons on top, and I didn't want it to be too thick.  I seasoned with lots of salt and pepper.  Will make it again!

A bit too sweet for my taste, I added 1/2 can tomatoe paste to counter the sweetness and it came out PERFECT!  Next time I'll add 1 tsp less brown sugar and 1/2 tomatoe paste (I prefer a hearty tomatoe flavor to my sloppy joes).  My husband said "throw all the other recipes away, THIS one is the ONE!"

This soup was great. It is so versatile. I used venison instead of beef. Beef stock instead of chicken, fire roasted tomatoes instead of crushed and added 3 sliced potatoes. It really isawonderful soup. You could used any ground meat and your favorite veggies, I think you'd always have a 5 star winner! Thanksso much for sharing.

We really loved this soup!  I did not thicken it, since we like broth-y soups.  I didn't have any celery or onion on hand, so I added an extra can of diced tomatoes, and about a tablespoon of dried minced onion.  Yum!  It is a perfect soup for the pressure cooker...makes the ground beef very tender and tiny.

I had some hamburger and wanted to do something a little different then what I usually do with it, so I came across this recipe.

It was very good. My father absolutely loved it. :) It just needed a little something extra. The next time I make it, I think I'll add some potatoes and see what happens.
