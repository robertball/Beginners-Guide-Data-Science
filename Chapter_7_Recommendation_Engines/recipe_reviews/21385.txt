After using another oatmeal pancake recipe for years, our family of ten has voted this one "AWESOME".  The only change we made was to double the buttermilk (the cheap kind; 2% milk and lemon juice), a little more if the batter sits very long.  If we plan ahead, we let the oats soak in the buttermilk overnight in the fridge which makes the oats a little softer.  Either way, this recipe is a winner.

These were good, but as reported by others, the batter is VERY thick!  I made my first few pancakes with the "original" batter but then added milk until I liked the consistancy better to all my other pancakes.  Both tasted great, but I did like the pancakes with a little more milk in the batter better.  Plus they were easier to spread out.  Very yummy though, so just keep adding a little more milk until the batter is creamier.

These were delicious.  I added vanilla, cinnamon, blueberries, flax seed, and a bit of sparkling water and have never had a tastier pancake.

I doubled this recipe to make extra for next week. My kids asked me to add chocolate chips this morning, that was the only change I made. This recipe is almost where it needs to be--it's just too thick as is. I added a little more milk but the little overmixing I had to do made the pancakes flat and tough. I should have read through the reviews before I made this recipe. I'd like to try these pancakes again, with adjusted milk or oats and see if I can get a better result the next time. I'd also grind down the oats to a finer texture in my food processor as well. NOTE: If you want to add chocolate chips like me, just mix the batter up and after you ladle your batter onto the griddle, sprinkle your chips over each little batter circle.

From the dining room, they yell to the kitchen "these are REALLY good!" Using the advice of other reviewers, I up the milk 1/4c. They were perfect. I knew we would be out of syrup, so to the batter for the last two I added one more teaspoon of sugar, some vanilla and cinnamon. I sprinkled raisins over the batter as soon as it was poured into the pan. They were like eating soft, warm oatmeal cookies for breakfast! Thanks for sharing this keeper.

Recipe was excellent! We just had to change a few of the ingredients to suit us. We used soy instead of buttermilk. 4 T. of olive oil instead of butter & brown organic sugar instead of white.

The original recipe definitely needed improvement. I decreased the amount of oats and increased the amount of liquid. It took a while to acquire the correct proportions. But, after that they were pretty good. As written, this recipe is not worth trying, but it does have potential, if taken some vital alterations in account.

These were amazing. I used whole wheat flour instead of white. They were thick so I added some milk.

Very tasty but needs a bit more liquid to make consistency right.  I added 1/3 C 2% Milk and they turned out great.  Chocolate chips and pecans sprinkled in made them fabulous.  They are like having dessert for dinner!

I make this basic recipe using steel cut oats. I first soak 1 cup oats overnight in 1 cup or more buttermilk in a blender. (I prepare the whole thing in the blender). In the morning, I add 1 egg. 1/2 to 1 cup regular milk, 1/2 to 1 cup whole wheat flour. The sugar (only about a tablespoon) the baking powder, soda, also 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp. vanilla extract along with the butter (about 2-3 tablespoons). The batter is thick, but thin to desired consistency with milk. Yum. The oats and buttermilk make them so sweet, they hardly need syrup!

FANTASTIC!  This week my boyfriend is doing allergy testing which limits our diet for the week.  Oats, rice, eggs and meat are all that is acceptable.  A few veggies.  I changed all the milk and butter to water, and ground some oatmeal into flour and used that.  Next time I'll put a LITTLE more water in. Made syrup with brown sugar, cinnamon and water.  FANTASTIC!  We'll eat it again for sure!

This recipe is great.  My family is dairy-free, so I substituted the buttermilk for soy milk and olive oil for butter.  This is a trick I learned so that you don't have to grease the pan.

My 7 and 5 year old boys liked them but everyone else felt they were heavy and plain tasting.  If I make them again I will probably add cinnamon and raisins or blueberries.  It would also be better with some vanilla I think.

These were great. I was afraid the batter was too thick, but it worked as is. I used whole wheat flour, smart balance margarine, and splenda to make it fit my diet. Very good!

This is a really strange recipe.  The "batter" is so thick it's really more like a soft dough.  The pancakes have a pleasant taste, but it seems to be a lot of effort to produce something that basically tastes like eating a bowl of oatmeal.  Next time I'll just make a bowl of oatmeal.

the batter was thick but after adding about 1/3 cup more liquid and grinding the oats in a blender, they turned out great. i put a little less butter and separated the egg and folded the egg whites in. i will make this again . :DD

I was looking for something different to make my daughter for breakfast, and thought this was a nice healthy base to start from.  I may not have let my oats soak long enough as the finished product was more than a little chewy, but they still puffed nicely and with the addition of some mashed banana and cinnamon, were quite tasty.  I did have to add a splash more milk to make the batter pourable, used just a bit of raw sugar vs. white, and substituted olive oil and a pinch of salt for the butter, with no ill effects.

These were very good, my son loved them (needed to increase the amt of fiber he's getting) tho i did double the milk and i ran the oats through the blender to puree them in the milk. i think next time ill grind the oats first but b/w pureeing it and mixing in the extra milk they turned into yummy filling pancakes with honey on top for me and maple syrup for him ;)  i rated it four stars b/c of the amt of time it took to make them but they did turn out very good

As to the problem with a thicker then normal batter for pancakes it is always the easy way out to add water as to thin it out a bit.

These are good, but the name "pancakes" is a bit of a misnomer.  They're more like skillet scones.  Better eaten with a heap of applesauce than maple syrup.

I wanted a healthy form of pecan pancakes so I took this recipe and added pecans, cinnamon and vanilla extract (also used splenda instead of sugar and whole wheat flour instead of regular).  They were excellent.

This is a great recipe for my entire family. I use the powered buttermilk. I let the oatmeal sit in the bowl to soften for 30 minutes. I do add a little extra milk so the consistency is not quite so thick. I also make this recipe with gluten-free flour for one of my children. It comes out great.

These were great. My family loved them and I have made them several times already. They are very light and fluffy. I took the recommendations and only added 1 1/2 cups of oatmeal and I added fresh blueberries. So yummy!!

I wanted to try this recie because of the high proportion of heart-health oatmeal to flour - What a mistake. The proportions of wet ingredients to dry ingedients are wrong. The batter is too thick and other reviewers had made the same claim. I needed to add more buttermilk (which I substituted 1 tbsp. lemon juice and the rest of the cup milk) to make it a thinner batter - then the batter was too thin so I had to add more flour. I will not make this recipe again. I will try the other oatmeal pancake recipes on this site.

If you are truly looking for "light and fluffy", this is not the pancake for you. They are tasty but dense, even with conservative mixing.  I like to add diced up ripe banana (and a handful of walnuts sometimes).

These are an excellent, hearty pancake.  Needs a bit more liquid and extra cinnamon.  I make them when guests are in and get rave reviews.  Awesome with some strawberries or other fresh fruit!

I thought these pancakes were delicious!  And so much better for you than regular pancakes.  The flavor was fantastic.  I adjusted the recipe for two servings and it worked out really well.  You can play with the proportions of the ingredients a bit to get the batter texture you like (i.e less oatmeal more buttermilk)

I use 2C buttermilk and let the oat/milk mixture sit overnight in the fridge. I also added raisins and 1/2 t cinnamon. I really like these; they are chewy and a more healthful pancake, with the whole grains instead of just white flour.

I use this recipe all of the time, though I like to add a little bit of brown sugar and cinamon.  They can be a little dry so I recomend a nice amount of syrup.  Good stuff.

I don't know how this ever got a 4 star rating!!  I knew I was in trouble when I got to the first step in the recipe. So, I went back to the site and read the reviews.  The first one told how she had to rework the recipe to make it work, then gave it 4 stars!?!  Rather than mess with this one, just take your favorite pancake recipe and replace 3/4 of the flour with oats and go from there!! A touch of cinnamon would be nice, too.

So yummy! I added about 1/3 c extra milk to the oats and blended them in the blender, then I added blueberries to the batter when I fried them. I love them!

This is a great recipe, I just made a couple of changes. I doubled the milk and replaced the sugar with honey.

Loved this recipe! I read the reviews and made some changes, partly because I didn’t have some of the ingredients.  I didn’t have buttermilk so I used half almond milk and half half and half and almost doubled the amount of milk the recipe called for . I also ran out of oats so I used half granola. Also for sugar I used half organic raw cane sugar and half xylitol. I soaked the oats and granola in the milk mixture for 15 minutes then I added all the ingredients into a blender and pulsed till pretty smooth.  I also added some cinnamon and vanilla.  I added some blueberries once the mixture was blended.

Excellent.  I made the following changes:   half tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon.  Added some milk as noted by many others.  Added some blueberries after the pour.  I may have added a little too much milk, as the cakes were super tender and thus a little hard to flip.  Reducing the size to about 5 inches helped in this regard.   Next time, I will go easier on the milk and see if that helps.  But super yummy.   I melted more butter to pour on top, and also warmed up some real maple syrup.   I feel so guilty :-)

Best pancakes I've ever made!  I did thin them out, like other cooks here.  I used buckwheat flour (about 3/4 cup) instead of all-purpose/wheat, and ended up using 2 cups of buttermilk.  I also used agave instead of sugar as a sweetener.
What a delicious way to get your oatmeal!

I made these as directed except I used white whole wheat flour, maple syrup instead of white sugar(honey would work too) and a little cinnamon.  I thought it looked a little chunky so I hit it with my hand blender and chopped it up a little.  Next time I will put it in the blender and cut it up a little.  Otherwise...yum!

These are so good!  I didn't have a problem with the batter being too thick, But I have also made thick batter pancakes for years.  It makes them fluffier and more "cake" like. Delicious! Add cinnamon and Vanilla extract for more flavor.

I thought these were fairly bland, especially for all the buttermilk and butter in them. I added raisins and crushed walnuts, but they didn't help much. The batter was way too dense. Next time I'll use normal milk, and more of it. Perhaps less butter too.

I made the recipe as written.  Make SURE you like oatmeal before making these.  They taste just like a bowl of oatmeal. Don't expect this batter to look or behave like regular pancake batter. It doesn't.  It is very thick.  I poured mine out in 1/4 cup measure. The batter doesn't bubble letting you know it is time to flip them; so it is hard to make sure they are actually done in the middle. Mine did not hold together on the plate. Once they were cut, they just wanted to fall apart.  I couldn't really stab them with the fork & pick them up. All in all, this recipe is a loser; a waste of time & buttermilk. I would never make these again.

These were very soft and light... not heavy like some oatmeal pancakes. My kids devoured them.

My family really likes these pancakes. With a lot of hungry boys these panckes are great hollow leg stuffers. After I follow the intial recipe I do add more milk by site to make the batter go further and not so thick. I also had to double and halfthe recipe to efficeintly feed a family of seven.
