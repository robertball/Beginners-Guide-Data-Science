I only had one lemon but was dying for some fresh lemonade and this was perfect. I wasn't so sure at first about the lemon-mashing but it turned out very well. I didn't leave the pulp in when I drank it- was I supposed to? Oh well. I added a little extra sugar and water and this is the best lemonade I have ever had.

Well balanced lemon flavor, though a word of warning:  don't leave the lemons in overnight.  They break down and make it a lot more sour and bitter.  I learned this after making a double batch for two back to back parties and having to compensate for the second.

AWESOME!  My hubby (who doesn't measure anything) was helping me get things ready for a bbq for several guests.  When I took the first sip during the meal I could not believe how sweet it was!  Thinking the measurements were off, I asked him if he followed the recipe.  Of course, he said no! However, my guests ALL loved it.  For me it was an easy fix by adding more cold water.  There was NOT a drop left and they wanted more!  *Update* I have made this several times and like how you can adjust to your taste (water and sugar).  The only downfall is the time it takes to get the seeds out of each slice.  I always cut back on the sugar by half.  I will continue to make this recipe because there is nothing like fresh lemonade!

YUM!  I made a single serving and it filled half of a tall glass.  Next time I'll make more!  I left half the lemon slices in my glass. PERFECT ratios.  I'll be making this in a large pitcher this weekend for my son's 2nd birthday party.  This is GREAT and SO much easier than juicing lemons!!

I've made this three times (making it for forth time right now :)) and EVERYONE loves it!!!  It's sweet but absolutely wonderful

Okay after making this six or so times now I (like other reviewers) noticed that it gets bitter if you leave the peel/rind in for too long and have since started using my juicer to juice the lemons and then finishing with the recipe and have been able to cut back to 2C sugar and still have it be plenty sweet with the added benefit of it not getting bitter or having seeds in it.  I just buy an extra lemon or two to slice to garnish the bowl for serving.  :)  And it makes a perfect gallon size pitcher if you'd rather do it in a pitcher than a punch bowl.

Surprisingly delicious!  We just mash everything together without worrying about the seeds and then strain the whole thing at the end.

this is so very good. fresh, refreshing, bold lemon flavor. and amounts can be varied to taste easily. with the potato masher the lemons kept squirting me so i used a wooden spoon. it's been in the 90's here so this has been the best on hot days!! i will always make lemonade homemade now.

My 14 year old daughter made this lemonade for guests this weekend and everyone said it was the best lemonade ever.  She did add lemonade soda to the recipe and that probably enhanced the flavor.

This is fantastic! I was very doubtful because of the EASY preparation. It turned out much better than lemonade from the store. Great for cocktails also.

This is great.  I tried it as is.  I tried it using Splenda instead of sugar.  I tried it using limes for limeade.  All were good.  I used a small whisk to mash up the fruit.  I thought it was a good idea to wash the fruit before slicing it, since the peel remains in the mixture.

This was such a full-bodied lemonade; perfect color, perfect consistency, and extremely easy to make; no tedious squeezing.  I made a test batch (1 serving) for myself, and this is what I'll be serving at all my summer get-togethers.  So glad I found this!  Thank you!

Best lemonade ever!  I added more water to the recipe and there was still plenty of flavor.  1 cup of water per lemon and the same amount of sugar as recipe calls for.  Planning two big events with this refreshing lemonade on the menu

Party of 20, those that chose the lemonade came back for seconds and then others wanted to try the 'homemade' lemonade. Big hit - should have made two batches. I also cut back on the sugar and used only two cups and before the ice melted it was too sweet. With the ice melting, it was perfect!

I've made this recipe a couple of times now and it's always turned out very well. Most recently, instead of using 12 lemons I used 6 lemons and 6 limes for lemon-limeade, and it is fabulous! I also used 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 and it is still sweet enough.

Great recipe! Instead of mashing the lemons with the sugar I juiced my lemons with a juicer (saved 2 for slicing) mixed the sugar, added water and iced cubes and then added lemon slices to the lemonade and chilled for a half hour. Superb thanks for sharing! 

If anyone tries this make sure to remove the sliced lemons from the lemonade at the end of the day. The lemons make the lemonade bitter if in there for too long.

Made this for a cookout and received rave reviews from everyone! Not a lemon fan myself but I did taste it, even I liked it! I did use a potato ricer to squeeze the lemons and increased the recipe to 20 lemons and 5 cups sugar. Used a 2 quart pitcher full of ice and it got better as the evening went on! Strained the lemons out of the remaining liquid (they can turn rancid overnight)!

Perfect combination. I blended all of the ingredients and estimated the amount of lemon juice. The ice cubes I blended as well and it turned out frothy and delicious.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  If it doesn't instantly disappear make sure you take out the lemons before storing it in the refrigerator, otherwise it will get extremely bitter.

Wonderful party drink. Big hit at my son’s graduation party. Looks so pretty in glass drink dispensers. I made strawberry lemonade by pureeing a cup of fresh strawberries then boiling it down about 30 minutes to reduce. I mixed the sugar into strawberry reduction to make a syrup, which combined better with the cold water. Do not make too far ahead of time as it turns bitter as the lemon slices sit.

We made a 1/3 batch, and it was delicious! We used warm water to help dissolve the sugar, and then strained the lemon slices out. After adding ice and letting the ice melt just a touch it was perfect!

WAYYY too sweet! I reduced the sugar by 2/3 (1 cup sugar to every 12 small lemons) and 7 cups water. Used a food processor to slice the lemons wafer-thin and macerated the slices with the sugar., then stirred in the water. Iced individual servings rather than adding ice to the recipe.

We made this lemonade for a class project. And everyone wanted seconds or even thirds. And they even tried to take the pitcher where we pour the lemonade from. So I believe this stuff is amazing.

Wow!  This drink is amazing.  My only grudge is how labor intensive it is.  You don't want tons of seeds so more work at the beginning means a better end result.  If you're making it for a party, make it plenty of time ahead so that you're not rushed and hasty while dissecting the lemons.  I can't wait to make this for our large punch dispenser.  I guarantee it won't last long!

It was a bit too sweet for our taste and had to add more water.  But I think overall the radio was good. I will definitely make this over and over again.

Delicious and refreshing! Everyone in my house will drink this! If you are making it with Stevia, be sure you will drink in within 24 hours otherwise it tastes strange the next day. With sugar, just as good only more calories :)

Made this for a birthday party along with another punch.  The guests were tipping the decanter over  trying to get out every last drop while the other punch was still half full.  Such a great taste!  I did 5 large lemons, half the sugar, 8 cups of water, 4 cups of ice from my ice maker.

I made everything just as the recipe says last year for my sons birthday party. Every last drop was gone. My mother in law even added water and sugar to the lemons to try and get the last bit of flavor out. Futile attempt!! It was so delicious. I'm making it again today for his second birthday in triple amounts! Thanks for this recipe! My little one and family is sure to love it!

Excellent recipe.  I make it for every party in the summer.  The only thing I do differently is that I follow the recipe exactly as is, pour it in the lemonade stand, and add a LOT more water than the recipe says. Maybe it's because I'm so great at mashing the lemons, more juice comes out and it's more concentrated?  I dunno.  But MORE water with my lemons.

Made this lemonade for a Mother's Day get together and it got rave reviews. Very easy to put together. I used unbleached sugar and was afraid it would ruin the color, but it looked great. Will definitely make again.
