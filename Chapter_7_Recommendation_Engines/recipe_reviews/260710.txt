I like the flavors that were in these pinwheels, but, I think the temperature and cooking time were a little off.  I would cook the pinwheels at a little higher temperature.  I checked the pinwheels at 12 minutes and the puff pastry still wasn't cooked, so, I upped the temperature to 375 for 4-5 minutes and they were cooked perfectly.  I I do think I would prefer deli corned beef to pastrami next time.  They were best served hot or slightly warm. Be sure to cut with a serrated knife!
