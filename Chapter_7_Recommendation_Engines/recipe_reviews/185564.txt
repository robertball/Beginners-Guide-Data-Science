Grilled okra is a summertime regular at my house and I have found a MUCH better way to grill them. Lay 5 or 6 of them out side to side. I alternate the direction of each one so they fit nicely against one another. Then take bamboo skewers and run all the way though them. Put 2 skewers about an inch apart through each bunch of okra forming a sort of raft. Brush on butter and seasoning and grill.

YUM!  The char-grilled taste was wonderful.  I found the flavor was better with just a little butter and just slight sprinkling of seasoning. Rolling it in seasoning made it just a little too strong. We used Tony Chachere's original creole seasoning.

I've been grilling okra for years - we love the whole pods (much easier preparation) grilled with olive oil and coarse salt and pepper.  Love the cajun seasoning idea!!!  Adds zip!

My family really enjoyed this quick and easy recipe. After placing the orka on the grill, I brushed on the melted butter and sprinkled on the cajun spice. We will make this a regular dish.

this was about the only way i've never eaten okra and it was very good. there is no need to oil the grill since the okra has already been dipped in melted butter.

What a refreshing new way to eat okra! I just brushed butter on them and sprinkled some "Slap ya Mama" cajun seasoning on some garden fresh okra-so easy and good. My whole family loved it.

This is a wonderful way to prepare okra or any type of squash I'd imagine.  I took other reviewers suggestions into account.  I poured the butter over in in a bowl and added about 1/8 cup creole seasonings.  The grilled charred taste is awesome.  Thanks for a simple recipe that tastes great.

8.24.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/185564/grilled-okra/ ... 1/4c cajun spices in 1/4c oil thickened it too much so added addt'l 1/4c oil. I didn't weigh okra, but had a cookie sheet full.  Yup, foil lined it & baked it@425, 20minutes, turn, 20 more.  Tasted after first 20, almost done, soft, cajun seasoning is pretty salty. Lessons learned: Since the spices thicken the oil, too much stays on initially.  The oil then bakes off & okra won't get crisp sitting in oil.  Using butter, I thought it would burn too fast; & didn't want to waste it if it wasn't good anyway.  Oil isn't so expensive.  :)  Sooo, if we have too much okra next year, I'll toss the okra in oil without the spices in it.  Then sprinkle them on once on the pan & again after turning.  I let it sit in the oven passed the second twenty with the heat off & it wasn't so pretty; but, again, we could eat it & the saltiness wasn't too much - just more than I expected compared to the hot cajun taste.  Note4Me:  Use skewers alternating ends of okra.  Put seasoning in butter or just sprinkle, not roll.  Six to eight minutes on each side.

Amazing recipe and a convenient relief to having to fry/pickle all the okra from a garden.  Sprinkling the seasoning is more my wife and my pace...And I hate to say this (since fried okra is one of my favorite foods) but this recipe definitely rivals fired okra!!

I only had pre-sliced okra, but it worked out well.  I used Tony Chachere's original creole seasoning as well. You may want to sprinkle the seasoning, as another reviewer said, rolling the okra around in in makes it too strong. I made that mistake as well, so  next time I will sprinkle the seasoning instead.

Yum!!!  This was a great way to eat okra.  In the past, the only way I liked it was pickled.  Mine took a little longer to char than the recipe advises.  More like 6 or 8 minutes on each side.

Went too heavy on the seasoning. Go light on the seasoning. Made some with no seasoning and it was excellent also.

I feel like it might be as much "Okra isn't really for me" as it is the recipe itself, but this certainly didn't feel like it made things more palatable.

I am in Rhode Island, so okra is not normally found at the grocery store. I can, however, somehow still grow it in the garden. :) Last night, we grilled out and had already cooked up some bacon in the cast iron pan, so I brushed some of the leftover grease on the pods instead of using melted butter. We sprinkled on the seasoning. The recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

Never grilled (or even thought about grilling) okra, but now I'm addicted to them! Everyone I've had try them falls in the love with them too. I use avocado oil (it's a high heat oil perfect for grilling) along with french fry seasoning and they are PERFECT! Thank you! :-)

We used this recipe for inspiration and incorporated some of the reviewers' suggestions . . . We threaded the okra on two metal skewers, alternating directions (thanks to semajsmadda), brushed "the raft" with olive oil (thanks to chryan) and lightly seasoned with salt & Tony Chachere's. Grilled 2.5 minutes each side for a nice char. EXCELLENT!

One of the best okra recipes and so simple. This has a crunchy and wonderful blend of texture that makes eating fresh okra a delight! We made with exact ingredients but changed the application. Butter was brushed on with a basting brush and seasoning was simply sprinkled on from the shaker. We used the skewer hint from another reviewer, and it worked perfectly. Cooking time provided in the recipe was just right.

I used a vegetable grill pan, substituted olive oil for the butter, and added a tiny bit of high-end balsamic vinegar before grilling.  You want to make sure that you leave then long enough to cook through and get a little soft.  Wonderful.  Will definitely make again.

I found okra on sale, and came here to find out what to do with it. This recipe is great! I melted unsalted butter and added creole seasoning to it, then brushed it on the skewered okra. 3 to 4 minutes on the grill, and it was so good! I used less seasoning because I didn't want it to be too salty, and used unsalted butter.  We had to divvy the okra up evenly because everyone liked it so much. The okra stayed pretty firm, and didn't get slimy at all.  This will be on our regular grill rotation; we're having it again tonight. I think I'll try adding a bit of lemon juice to the butter this time, just for something different.

I made this with olive oil instead of melted butter for dietary reasons and used my favorite brand of Cajun seasoning.  My husband really liked it, but I'm not as impressed with the result.   I used fresh pods, not too big, and while the flavor was very good, the pods emerged from the grill rather tough and stringy.  Mind you, I love good okra, so it is remarkable that I didn't even finish my portion.

They looked beautiful, but maybe they were not charred enough? Still pretty slimy (but we love okra, so it was OK) Definitely a recipe worthy of experimentation! Will try to really blacken them over high heat next time

We like okra most any it can be cooked, but hadn't tried it grilled.  After trying it grilled,  I would have to say it is now our new favorite way to prepare okra.  It is outstanding and really easy.  

We didn't bother with the skewers.  We just tossed them into a grilling basket and cooked them until they were good and brown.

This is great! I was worried about 'slime', but there was none after a light charring.  Very good.

Best okra I have ever had!  I did use a charcoal grill with mesquite wood chips, which gave it a great smoky flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe! I halved it thinking a whole pound would be too much but I wish I would have made more!  I brushed on the butter & sprinkled the seasoning on like another reviewer suggested and used the skewer method as well.
