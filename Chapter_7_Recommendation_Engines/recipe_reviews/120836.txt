This is OK.  It tastes good, but it's nothing special or innovative.  If I try it again, I would double the amount of corn.  Using just two cups, the corn gets lost among all the other ingredients.

This recipe was brought to me in a neighborhood potluck.  It is shockingly good.  Sounds so strange, but everything compliments each other.  Please try it.

This was good! I think the next time I make it though, I will omit the celery. It just seemed like it didn't belong there or something, but other than that, this was refreshing and a nice change from the norm. Thanks for sharing. :)

I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. I used less red onion, and I minced it, I didn't have any fresh basil so I used 1 tsp. dried, (not quite as good I'm sure) and I used fat free Italian Caesar Dressing b/c I couldn't find the reduced fat plain old Italian dressing. Yum!
