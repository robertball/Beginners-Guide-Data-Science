This has the right idea but a couple of flaws.  First, it should be noted that the cauliflower should be very dry before mashing or the results won’t be thick enough.  Knowing this is an issue of concern because I’ve made this before, I knew adding the cream would not be a good idea so I left it out.  Also, I wish I had added the Parmesan “to taste” rather than the full amount, which for my taste was too much.  In addition to being a little too Parmesan-y, this needed some rounding out of flavor, and was improved a great deal with a little pepper and garlic.

Tried this for Christmas brunch even though it was unrated (never been brave enough to do that before.)  My husband said it was killer and my mother in law wouldn't stop raving about it.  A big hit. I love that there was no baking step.  I used a stick blender and it was all made in one pot.  Two heads of cauliflower was two pounds in the store, but after trimming and cutting was a little less so I might use slightly less cream less time just to make it thicker.  I had leftovers the next day and made myself lunch by topping a bowl of this with bacon and shredded cheddar cheese.  A great success worth writing my first review for.

I made this twice. First time, I boiled the cauliflower and was able to mash it with a potato masher. I also used garlic powder instead of cheese. Yum! The second time, I was in a hurry & steamed it in the microwave.  Had to put it in the blender to mash. Tried it with the cheese..?? Much better with garlic...Excellent alternative to potatoes with beef when you are on a low carb diet!

I roasted the cauliflower so there was no moisture issue at all. I cooked it at 425 for 25 min then put it in the food processor, added cream and off I went!

Next time I make this I will leave out the cream also.  Too runny, the consistency out of the blender would have been perfect.

Ended up adding too much milk so it was runny, but the flavor was good. Don't expect it to taste like potatoes, though.

I generally don’t eat cauliflower but decided to try this to incorporate into my low carb diet. I quit learned that using a blender is definitely not a good idea. It won’t blend without enough liquid and that said, it would be too watery. A food processor is the way to go! I added garlic powder to bump up the flavor a bit and it made a big difference.

Excellent! Definitely get out ALL the extra moisture that you can because I didn’t and it ended up runny. That said, the flavor is delicious and my whole family or potato-lovers likes this fine!  Total win!

Added a hint more cheese, but we absolutely LOVED this recipe!  Rich and creamy.  Faked out even the pickiest of veggie eaters.

This recipe still had a very strong cauliflower taste without much flavor.

Served with Holiday lunch, our youngest married son does not like cauliflower  and was hesitant to try this and assured us he would let us know how bad it tasted.  He had two helpings and had his wife copy the recipe so they can make at home.

The only thing I did differently for this recipe was stream the cauliflower rather than boil it. That kept the cauliflower from getting runny. It was excellent and can be modified with any seasoning/cheese you want!

I forgot the cream but it turned out great without it. I also added a couple of garlic cloves for "garlic-mashed cauliflower"--yum, that worked out well, too! A healthful and tasty substitute for mashed potatoes but much more filling.

First time trying out this recipe.  The texture and taste is good substitute to mashed potatoes.
