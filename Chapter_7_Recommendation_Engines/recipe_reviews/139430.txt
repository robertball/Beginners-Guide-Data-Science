Our family and friends love it. They look forward to every time it is on the menu. Instead of using meat tenderizer we marinate two nights. One night in sprite to tenderize and the second night in the rest of the ingredients.

Four stars as written, five stars with my tweaks! I made a 2 lb flank steak and knew that the marinade volume was way too much. I halved everything but the garlic and ginger, in fact I doubled the garlic and ginger! Also put in a healthy squirt of Sriracha for sweet heat. I also omitted the meat tenderizer, I don't think its needed if you fork your steak well. Marinade and steak went into my FoodSaver canister for 2 hours, but there was so much marinade that I couldn't bear to toss it! It went into a saucepan with 1/2 cup of water to tone the harshness of the soy sauce and raw onion, then thickened with arrowroot. Served the sauce with the steak at the table and it was a huge hit. I served it with an Asian style quinoa pilaf which was much more flavorful and healthy than rice. Dinner was amazing! I'll make this again!

Excellent! It marinated for 2 whole days in the marinade. As I didn't have low-sodium soy sauce nor meat tenderizer, I substituted 1/2 soy sauce, 1/2 water & 2-4 Tblsp. pineapple juice, respectively. Will make this again. I served it with steamed (pearl) rice, Kor. green onion salad, & several lettuce leaves per person. We ate the thinly sliced meat Korean-style, wrapping all the foods in the leaves, & optionally dipping into a soy sauce & rice vinegar dip.

Very yummy even though my blender broke during the process (really old blender). I just left the marinade with chunky bits and marinaded over night. Tender and tasty but salty as I expected. Tasted a lot like Maui Ribs Marinade, which hubby likes a lot. Big hit at the table.

This came out great! A bit on the salty side(I love salt) but I didn't have any low sodium soy sauce. My family enjoyed it. I will definitely use this marinade again with a less costly piece of meat as I have 13 people in my home and flank steak can be pretty pricey. Thanks for a great recipe!

I live in South Korea right now and this is a great recipe! It works well with pork ribs/steak, too! Wrap the cut up pieces in bib lettuce and enjoy with rice!

Sooo delicious everyone loved it!  Made according to the directions but substituted half of the soy sauce with water because I was nervous it would be overly salty.  I let the flank steak marinade for 24 plus hrs and then grilled 6 minutes per side.  The entire dinner party couldn't get over how delicious it was and one individual even requested the recipe saying it was the best steak she's ever had :)  I will for sure be making this again and would highly recommend it to others!

With all the soy sauce (even reduced sodium) it was very salty.  I'll try it again with less soy.

Stop what you are doing right now and go make this marinade. It is FANTASTIC!! I used it on NY Strip steaks and was only grilling 3 steaks, so I used only what I needed and froze the rest to use it later on chicken... Will definitely make again!!

The marinade is great, but calls for way too much soy sauce.  I used about 1.5 cups and I had a ton of marinade left.  Instead of flank steak, I used very thin slivers of (I believe) filet mignon, put them on skewers, and grilled them.  Quite good.

My family really enjoyed this dish. I followed the recommendation of using half soy and half water. I tripled the amount of ginger and garlic and omitted the meat tenderizer. Marinated it for 24 hours + and cooked for 8 minutes per side. Will definitely make again. Very yummy and no leftovers.

This is way too salty for us.  I would reduce soy sauce by 1/2 of what is recommended, add 3 tablespoon of siracha hot sauce, 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger, and green onions.

Great easy recipe for a sweet, salty and slightly tangy flank steak.  As with others, I didn't have any low sodium soy, so I used 1 cup regular soy and 1 cup water and substituted a little lemon juice for the meat tenderizer.  This was a last minute dinner idea, so the meat only marinated for about an hour.  I forked the meat and had a pretty good cut, so the flavor did get into it, but it needed some additional sauce on top.  Will definitely make this again and try the lettuce wraps someone mentioned in their review.  We just had it with white rice.  Will also try sirlion skewers with this marinade.

We bought flank steak planning to grill, but then the weather called for rain, so we improvised. I sliced the beef up thin to marinate overnight. We put our electric griddle in the middle of the table, cranked it up to preheat, and cooked at the table Korean Barbecue style. We also threw some homemade kimchi on the griddle and served this with rice wrapped in perilla leaves. Not quite as good as the bulgogi we grew to love in Korea, but awfully close!   I served the leftover steak for lunch the next day over a bed of salad greens and drizzled with a bit of sesame oil and rice vinegar, and that was delicious as well. This is a recipe we will be making again and again!

Made this last night and my family gave it a 10. Served with broccoli and rice and seemed to taste a lot like Mongolian  Beef to me, which was great! I saved the marinade and boiled it/added a little corn starch to serve over the rice, this made the dish to us. Thanks for the recipe!

I cut the recipe in half and had lots of marinade!  I used low sodium soy sauce and it was still just a little salty, but delicious all the same.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

I had to make a few changes.  First, I was unable to buy flank steak (all the stores had it on sale 2 weeks ago, but there was none to be had this week)so I used boneless sirloin. Then I eliminated the meat tenderizer, as unnecessary.  And finally, when I went to use my sesame oil, I discovered I didn't have anywhere near enough, so I used what I had and added enough canola oil, in which I had cooked mashed toasted sesame seeds.  It smelled wonderful as it cooked and the flavors were tasty. It got mixed reviews from my guests about half thought it was alright and the other half liked it quite a bit.  I served Garlic Broccoli from this site over whole grain linguine and a salad.
