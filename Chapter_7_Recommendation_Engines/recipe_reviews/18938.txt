This is soo good!! if you are a scotch lover you will like this if not then add a bit more amaretto to reduce the bite of the scotch!! Also don't use a cheap scotch it will taste horrible!!! I used glenfiddich or glenlivet scotch.. and a good amarreto soooo good!!!

My husband is the scotch drinker. He thought this was wonderful. I used the homemade amaretto recipe from these pages. It was very smooth which made it a perfect nightcap

My husband loves this drink.  We use Crown Royal and amaretto.  I put a splash of club soda in when I make it for me to tone down the syrup-y amaretto.

This was very interesting. I didn't believe that these two liquors would pair well, but they actually do. It was good, just not my cup of tea.

Great drink if you are not sure if you like scotch. And still a great drink if you like scotch.

If you like scotch, this drink is perfect.  It is too strong for me, but the flavor is good otherwise.

A variation on this recipe is to use bourbon instead of scotch.  I have had this drink made as equal parts amaretto and bourbon, served over the rocks and it was delicious.  The amaretto really takes the sting out of the bourbon.  Goes down easy.

I love this drink; the one problem is that not many bartenders know how to make it, let alone even heard of this drink.
