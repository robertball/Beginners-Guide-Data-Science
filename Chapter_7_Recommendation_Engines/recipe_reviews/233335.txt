I made it and put it over rice. It was fast and easy! This will likely go in my rotation just based on how easy it is to throw together. :) And if you live near an IKEA, their meatballs are great for this. My two year old even loved it!

For a quick dinner I think this is great! It's different, because I normally do this in a skillet on the stove top. Baking them really integrates the sauce into the meatballs, and adds a wonderful glaze. I used an organic sweet and sour sauce, added the pineapple and a bell pepper,(I prefer red bells)and served it over brown rice. Add a veggie and a salad and you've got a great dinner. I used an extra 1/2 jar of sauce since I was putting it over rice. Thanks Tiffany!

Tried this one last night, my grandson wanted to make something and this seemed simple for him.  We didn't care for it.

So good! I added just a little siracha sauce to give it more of a kick too, and let it sit in the crock pot all day

I was looking for a dinner solution with meatballs that didn't involve pasta or a sandwich, and this was both quick and satisfying. I used what I hand on hand: Italian meatballs and some frozen multi-color bell pepper strips. I added a little bit of duck sauce to be sure I had enough sauce for the rice I served with it. The whole family enjoyed it.

Loved this recipe. I personally didn't use the foil, added a medium chopped onion, chopped garlic (instead of garlic salt), and a small amount of Parmesan cheese for the top. Served with jasmine rice, was divine!
