I didn't have any wine, so I substituted apple juice and a splash of lemon juice. It was delicious! My husband doesn't even like apricots all that much, but he thought this was a good recipe.

I used 2 whole pork tenderloins, started them stove top as the recipe called for. I finished them in the oven until they were 155 deg. I doubled the sauce recipe and it was the perfect amount for the tenderloins. Delicious! Everyone in the family gave it a big thumbs up.

Wow! These are fabulous! My daughter, who hates pork gobbled them up, and told me I finally found a way to cook pork where she will eat it! This recipe rocks!

This recipe is super easy to make and is great in a time crunch. However, it is super sweet and I am not a big fan of frying food. Broil it (10 minutes for the first side and 10-15 minutes for the second side) then put it in the glaze for a minute or so to soak in the taste. To lessen the sweetness, try apple sauce and a dash of lemon or a dryer wine. I think it was the wine that made it over the top sweet. It's yummy as it is but it would be fantastic with just a few minor adjustments.

I give it 4.5 stars for taste and 5 stars for ease and quickness.  You really can have dinner on the table in the time it takes to make rice.  I used (no sugar added) apple juice.  I cubed the pork first, fried it for a few minutes, removed from heat, and reduced the sauce for a few minutes (added about a tbs flour to thicken), then added back the pork for a few more minutes.  Served it over rice with peas and baby carrots on the side.  Just that easy.  I'm eating leftovers for lunch right now; still good.

Simple and yummy. I ran out of the ginger so I substituted with 1/2 tsp of allspice.  Came out perfect!!!

Wow, this was incredible! Thanks for the suggestion of the allspice instead of the ginger.  I wish I had added a clove or two of minced garlic.  And, I used orange juice instead of wine.

This is very good, easy and quick.  The only thing I did different was I used apple juice instead of white wine (didn't have any) and I cooked the chops in the glaze.  I served with white rice and we both thought it tasted really good.  Will make this again.

This was wonderful!  I used Japanese plum wine and added a splash of rice wine vinegar to cut the sweetness just a bit.  Perfect weeknight meal!  Even my preschooler loved it.

My picky husband loved it and it was so easy!  I grilled the chops first and then put in the sauce for about 8 mins.  This will definitely be added to the rotation.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this last night.  I used sparkling cidar instead of the wine. After trying the sauce on its own I found it to be a little bland for my tastes, so added a dash of garlic salt and a few pinches of brown sugar which seemed to round out the sauce nicely!

Quick and easy but very good meal.  I used apple juice rather than wine and I dredged the chops in flour before frying.  It was a hit with the family and I will add it to the rotation.

This was really good and super easy. I would make a little extra sauce next time. The taste is a little close to McDonald's sweet and sour sauce but better. Kind of funny. My whole family liked it including my 3 year old. I want to try it with chicken thighs next time.

Fast and easy, perfect for a week night dinner.  Prepared as written with the exception of the wine, I used apple juice instead. I used boneless chops and did not find them dry at all.  Will be making this recipe again! Thank you EV9/24/06.

I double and divide the recipe. I put the pork chops in a zip lock to soak in the sauce. I have used a dry wine just to keep the sweetness down. The extra sauce I throw in at the end of cooking a little Wondra to make a thick sauce to put over chops and rice. Like this and make it often.

Great recipe!  This was the first glaze I have made for pork chops and it was great.  Used Muscat as the wine and it was a great flavor.  Will be making this simple, yet very good recipe again.

De-licious and so fast.  I did not have a fruity wine and it tasted 'flat' so I added some soy sauce to the glace and it was perfect.  I also used bone in chops.  Love it....

My whole family loves this recipe. I have used bone in and boneless. We prefer bone in, but they're both amazing. I also stir fry some sliced onions after removing the pork chops before adding the sauce. MAKE EXTRA SAUCE! It's soooo good!

Wow! I echo the person whose daughter didn't like pork chops but really liked these! My daughter ate these right up, and until now she has disliked pork chops.  I was worried, when I started this recipe, that I would wind up with a sickly sweet gummy glaze on the pork chops, but it's not like that at all! The ginger cuts the sweetness to exactly the right level: a hint of sweetness, but not a "sweet" dish at all.  YUM! My husband asked for these again!

This was pretty good as a sauce, but I prepared it with lamp chops instead. I served the chops over rice, and the sauce was scooped out of the pan to coat the rice and chops.

Really, really good for a quick weeknight dinner.  I only had red wine, so I also used apple juice with a splash of lemon juice.  I also used sliced ginger from a jar and just chopped it up as small as I could.  I'm not a huge ginger fan, but the ginger balances the sweetness perfectly without being overwhelming.   Served with leftover couscous and frozen veggies for a quick, satisfying meal.

This dish was wonderful and we are making it for a second time this week.. I didn't change a thing and the apricot glaze is delicious. For the wine we used an inexpensive German Riesling and served the pork chops over a bed of yellow rice. I will continue to make this again and again!!

This is a wonderful recipe! Every time I make it, my family flips out over the recipe. Indeed, this recipe goes very well with rice. Also, doubling the sauce is a must... it is so tasty, even the next day! A perfect week night meal as it is rather fast to prepare.

This was absolutely scrumptious. I did not have wine, so I used orange juice which goes nicely with apricot. The meat was so tender and tasty and the sauce was thick enough so it didn't run off the meat on the plate. I paired it with rice which I made with OJ as well instead of water and I thought....why not add some apricot jam to the rice while cooking it? aaahhh man! another winner. Easy recipe, too. Thanks a bunch.

Very easy and only need a few things.  We really liked the sauce.  I cooked it to an internal temp of 140 and it was over cooked.   This is one of the best preps for pork chops I have had.

I made this tonight for dinner and it turned out great. The one thing i did do different was that I was afraid the pork would be blah so this morning I put in a zip lock bag with 1 part soy sauce 1 part apple juice and marinated it. I also didn't have wine so I used apple juice. I am not big into measuring when I cook so I just eyeballed the measuring but yummy. I will definitely make this again!! Thanks for a great quick recipe. We ate ours on egg noodles mmmmmm!!!!!

This was REALLY good.  I used a dry white wine, as opposed to a fruity, which I think kind of damaged the flavor a bit, but beyond that, this was delicious!!!  I served it with rice pilaf and spinach.

I don't normally do pork chops, but I LOVED this recipe.  The wine really brings out a whole new dynamic I never thought possible with a pork chop.  The men however....wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.  But, I like this so much that now when we have chops I make mine this way and just throw there's in the oven smothered in BBQ.  Great recipe!

Sorry, I don't understand what all the hype is about.  This recipe is mediocre at best.  Not much flavor at all.  I regret using my Mother In Law's homemade apricot preserves for this.  What a waste.

I wanted something different for Sunday dinner and boy did I get it.  The flavor just explodes in your mouth and my daughter swore I made sweet and sour pork with whole pork chops.  The wine is a great touch and I will definitely be using this recipe for even more occasions.

This was so yummy!  I used Viognier for the white whine but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  My fiancee said it was now his new favorite dish.  Yum!  I'm going to try it witch chicken next time.

Great recipe! I didn't change any ingredients, only added. To the sauce I added about a tablespoon diced dried apricots and a tablespoon of butter. I served the pork chops over chow mein noodles. The sauce worked beautifully with the noodles and pork! This recipe got my husband to actually enjoy pork, so I'd say it's a winner!!!

Made this last night with enough for lunch today. BF loved it last night ( so did I). He called after lunch today to remind me to put in the rotation. He said he had every last drop of the sauce!  I doubled the sauce. Served the chops with candied yams.  So very hood!  Thank you.

My family loves it! Made it for dinner when my in-laws came in and they raved about it. My husband normally dislikes pork chops. His previous experiences with pork chops consisted of overcook, hard, and dry- that no sauce could save. This was the total opposite! Moist, very tender, and great flavor. I cooked it a little differently from the recipe. I used regular canola oil and I just seared the pork chop to get a nice brown color and some juices flowing- but not fully cooked. I put the pork aside and put the wine/preserve/ginger mix into the pan to simmer with the juices for about 3-5 min. then added the pork chops back in to simmer with the sauce- flipping it every 2 minutes or so, to keep the  meat coated and cooked evenly. I do this for about 10 minutes. It sounds like a long time but the sauce keeps it so moist! My mother-in-law even kept the left over sauce to put on other things- it was so good!

Made this for dinner the other evening; I didn’t have wine so I used another reviews suggestion of applesauce. My apricot preserves were sugar-free because I’m diabetic. Loved these pork chops! Definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing!

I always double the sauce, no matter what the recipe. Doubling the sauce on this one, added to the flavor of the rice pilaf I served as a side. I didn’t use gewerstraminer wine, but substituted a single serve bottle of Moscato. Just as sweet, for only $2. Served with carrots tossed in the Saucy Susan and butter for a complimentary taste!

I have made several times and every time is delicious! I usually use my mom's homemade peach jam instead of an apricot jam, and leftover moscato wine. I let it cook down longer than stated, so that it's a thicker sauce for the chops. So simple, fast, and delicious. Yum yum!

This was awesome, I did not have wine in the house so I used the Apple juice to replace the wine. The only thing I added was about 1 teaspoon of brown sugar, other then that I made it like it said to. Very easy and quick

Made as written, except only used 2 chops. Sauce was good but want extra ginger next time. Maybe something acidic too, like a splash of lemon juice or vinegar.

This was so easy and my whole family liked it.  I used white wine vinegar instead of the sweet wine suggested.  I thought that would make it too sweet for us.  Glad I did it my way.

I rarely cook with wine and didn't have any on hand so I used chicken stock. It was just OK. The sauce never turned into a glaze. I was expecting the stickiness of a glaze but it remained a sauce. Even leftovers sitting in the pan didn't thicken up. My husband and teenage son liked it.  I'll say it was a very easy and quick dinner. I'm inclined to try again.

So easy to make. My husband and I like apricot  preserves, and the wine added just the right touch. We had the rest of the wine with dinner and knew it would be a perfect complement to the meal. My husband declared it "a keeper" after the first bite.

I made it like the recipe  called for with just a couple of changes.  I put a little butter in with the olive oil.  I didn't have any ginger so I added a tad of chicken and pork seasoning and a drop or two of lemon juice.  Very tasty and I will make it again but next time I will try the ginger.

I followed the recipe exactly and the pork chops refused to cook thoroughly. The four minutes on each side was highly inaccurate. It took about thirty minutes and by then the texture was awkward and the flavor of the glaze wasn't impressive either. Very disappointed!

For me, this was just okay. It was super easy and quick but the chops got tough.  The sauce was on the thin side so it didn't glaze the chops as I hoped.  I did serve with rice so I used some of the sauce on the rice as well. Overall, I am not likely to try this one again.

I always seem to be out of an ingredient and am notorious for using substitutions, not always successfully.  This time, it worked.  I only had half the apricot preserves needed so I used blackberry for the rest.  I don't use wine so I substituted with apple cider vinegar.  And I threw in some tart dried cherries for fun.  Tangy and delicious!

I don't like pork chops...but this recipe changed my mind!  I had to make a few substitutions because I didn't have everything on hand. I used apple juice instead of wine, and I didn't have apricot preserves. So I used Plum & Red raspberry preserves. It turned out great!!!

This is a great base recipe to play with, based on your tastes and what you have in the fridge.  I didn't have apricot preserves, so I used a peach and orange preserve that I had kicking around.  I cut back on the measurements and sort of "winged it" a little, as I was cooking for one last night.  It still came out great, not dry at all as someone said, and I really enjoyed a nice dinner on my own for the evening.  I had it with collards and blackeye peas for the New Year ... great dinner!

My husband and I found ourselves childless on New Year's Day and decided to try a new recipe with our pork loin chops. This sounded so good but after doing an inventory of our pantry only found Red Bell Pepper & Ancho Chili Jam, Apple juice, lemon juice and Allspice .... Used these as substations for the apricot preserves, wine and ground ginger. It was simply delicious and my husband told me we had to let others know. ( I never add a review).  It is a five + and I think my daughter will enjoy it too.

This recipe is excellent. I am on a low carb diet so I used sugar-free apricot preserves instead, along with plenty of fresh ginger and Allspice in the apricot mixture. It tasted delicious. I would just cook the pork chops for a bit longer (at least 5 minutes on each side, my pork chops were very thick). I used fresh ginger and added Allspice to the mixture which made a huge flavorful difference. Served it with acorn squash and green beans sauteed in garlic and ginger.  A+

Very easy to make! I modified it a bit by using apple jam along with the apricot preserves, and diluting the wine by half with apple cider. Tasted amazing with jasmine rice and creamed spinach!

Super-quick, super-easy. An absolute keeper. We doubled the sauce as we are prone to do (and which I recommend), and used coconut oil instead of olive, which gave it a lively flavor. We made enough for two meals and found them even more flavorful and tender the second day after soaking in the sauce.

This was really good.  I used bone in pork chops that were pretty thick, and they took much longer than called for to reach the desired temperature, but even after cooking in the sauce for a while, they were very tender.  I doctored my sauce up to taste (the sauce was good to begin with, but I thought we'd like it better with curry power and crushed red pepper...also a little low sodium soy sauce).  I love to try new recipes but I'll make this again.  Served with pecan rice.

This is a great recipe! Even my picky husband liked this and said it was a keeper!  I also modified it by using orange juice, apple juice, lemon juice, and my homemade apricot and pineapple freezer jam.  The pineapple in the jam added an extra kick.

This was so delicious! Even my pickiest son ate it all. I did make a few changes. I rinsed the pork chops with apple cider vinegar and rubbed them with 1/2 tsp of garlic paste along with the salt and pepper. I used apple juice instead of the wine and 1/2 cup of Saucy Susan Peach Apricot Sauce instead of the apricot preserves.  Added the ginger, 1/2 a 8.5 oz can of peaches chopped, 1/2 a 8.5 oz can of apricots chopped & a tablespoon of white vinegar for the glaze. Served it with yellow rice. Will definitely make this again!

I doubled recipe as I had a few extra pork chops.  Lots of sauce with the doubled recipe and enjoyed the flavor.  I liked the ease of the recipe.  I will make again but will add red pepper flakes to give it a nice kick.  I also used something called saucy susan, a peach appricot sauce.  This was nice and easy, and gave it a sweet and sour pork flavor.  You definately need to serve this with rice to absorb some of the sauce and flavors.  Thanks.

Made this for my husband and myself...followed the recipe and it was just blah. The meat had pretty much no flavor from the sauce...my husband was very disappointed. I usually find a way to tweak things but this one sounded good so I followed it. I will not make that mistake again...next time I will brine the chops or at least marinade them first!!

Easy! Delicious! I will definitely make this again. I paired this with white rice and sautéed rosemary green beans and mushrooms. We added soy sauce to the rice with the apricot glaze and it was a good addition.

Good recipe. I didn't have any sweet white wine so I used Apple Vinegar and used less than 1/3 of a cup, and added a little sugar to break up the taste. - Smiley1

Easy, fast and delicious recipe.  Perfect for a weeknight.  Added more apricot preserve.  The sauce was so great.  Pork didn't come out dry at ALL.  Best pork chop recipe yet.

Loved this recipe. Simple, quick and delicious. I only had a Chardonnay on hand but it came out great. Definitely will be making this again.

I was looking for something quick, but yummy. This did it,tender and juicy and flavorful!  I added sherry instead of the wine as I didn't have any white sweet wine and covered and simmered about 5 minutes at the end.

Very, very good. I used sugar free preserves and it was still excellent. The apricot and ginger is such a nice combination. Very easy to make too.

It was simple and had good flavor. I screwed up and had chops on hand that were very thick so getting them cooked evenly was kind of a chore, but this is a nice recipe.
Make sure your skillet isn't too hot when simmering the sauce and you'll be very happy in the end.

We served with chopped potatos seasoned with garlic salt and crushed red pepper for a little kick to compliment the sweetness of the chops.

I didn't have apricot preserves so I substituted pineapple preserves and it turned out delicious, perfect with stuffing as a side.

This recipe was awesome and it was super easy which is the best part. I didn't have any wine so I used orange flavored vodka and it worked out great. I also tried it with peach perserves instead of apricot. My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It's definitely a keeper.

Delicious, easy, and fast.  Used pomegranate juice rather than wine.  We loved the sauce.

LOVED IT!! Actually doubled the sauce because we like LOTS of sauce--and we used a spumante for the wine. Fabulous!!

I tried this recipe tonight and it was very good.  Instead of using apricot preserves I used Saucy Susan (didn't have appricot preserves). I would definately try this again...Thanks for the idea!

I used orange juice instead of wine like other reviewers. Took the advice of one reviewer and used allspice instead of ginger....my husband called it Christmas Pork. The kids thought it was too sweet (weird, huh?), husband loved it, I thought it was good. Maybe add a touch of garlic next time as one other reviewer suggested? Thanks for the recipe. Definitely quick and easy not to mention we had apricot preserves leftover from our wedding cake filling!

This is a really easy and flavorful recipe to do if you are short on time. I created an entire meal in under 30 minutes yesterday using a package of frozen pork chops thawed earlier. Complete with mashed potatoes and steamed green peas it was a hit with my family. Although I didn't use wine, I substituted a 1/3 cup of beer and pineapple juice mixed as a experiment and it turned out wonderful! Thanks for sharing!

These were very good and very easy to make!  I think next time I will double or triple the sauce so I have some left to pour over the chops and rice or potatoes.
