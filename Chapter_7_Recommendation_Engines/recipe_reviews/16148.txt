This recipe just seemed too bland for our taste.

Thanks Hank! This was a great! The prep time was so quick. The marinade/dressing has a really great flavor. My husband had gotten out a store-bought bottle of dressing just in case he didn't like this one....he didn't need it! Very, very, very good!

Delicious!  Full of flvor, yet light and healthy, and very easy to make.  I'd recommend following the grilling instructions to a T - grill for 3.5 minutes each side, no more - the tuna just turns out perfectly, nice and pink and moist on the inside.  I did double the vinaigrette and also added a bunch of veggies and such to the salad, which sounded a little plain.

I used this recipe some time ago when I was trying to figure out what to do with some fresh tuna and some arugula I'd gotten in an organic vegetable box. I'm a little leery about cooking with fish, because it can so easily go wrong, but I really like this recipe for a simple and light-but-satisfying option. So much so that I've actually come back looking for it now, since I lost my print out in an international move!

This recipe was just okay for us.  I followed the directions and made only one subsitution, dried rosemary instead of fresh.    Maybe we cooked it a little too long b/c it was sort of dry too.  But overall, it was just sort of flat tasting.  Nothing special.  I wouldn't even try this one again.

The only change I made was to add salad ingredients as we eat a lot of salads. The tuna was superb!

Ha This was the very first All-Recipes meal I made and 4 1/2 years later I am finally making a comment. I followed the recipe to the T for everything, adding cucumbers and sunflower seeds. The photo is actually my plate. Delicious Tuna Steak Salad, Happy Cooking.
