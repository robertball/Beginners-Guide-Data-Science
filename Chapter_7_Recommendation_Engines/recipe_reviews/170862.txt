We have a finicky 11-year-old in our family and he just loves this dish.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  It's so easy to make - I can cook the sausage the night before and my husband, who rarely cooks, can make it the next evening.

This was just alright for me.  I added more mozzarella but I would have liked more sauce - I should have decreased the amount of pasta or increased the amount of tomatoes/sauce.

This was super easy, but I wasn't a big fan of the Italian sausage, although my husband was.  I wish I would have let the sauce simmer for awhile so it was more flavorful.  Really just spaghetti with a twist!
