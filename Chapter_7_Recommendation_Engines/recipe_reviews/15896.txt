Hubs said it best when he remarked that this was not what he was expecting when I told him this was Blueberry Lemon BREAD.  Make no mistake - in our minds this was a tart/sweet, lemony, buttery, moist CAKE.  I had to settle for only about 1-1/2 tsp. of lemon zest - it was all I had.  But the cake didn't seem to be compromised by it at all - in fact, I might just use that same amount the next time I make this - because it was good, just as I made it.  The crowning touch is the lemon glaze. To ensure the sugar was dissolved I made a syrup of the lemon juice and sugar, heating it to a boil.  Worked perfectly and the resulting syrup was gorgeous.  Rather than drizzling it over the cake I brushed in on gradually as it absorbed into the cake.  Besides for contributing great flavor and moisture, it made the cake shiny and pretty.  This is lovely.

I was able to save on fat/sugar by doubling all ingredients except for eggs, of which I used only 3 total and sugar, of which I used 1 1/2 cups total, and making 2 loaves.  I also omitted the glaze.  It turned out both moist and sweet even with the cutbacks.  I'd recommend to those having trouble with sinking blueberries to beat a longer time after the addition of each egg - it fluffs up the batter more and hold the berries in place.

I have made this bread before (posted pic) and it was really good! This recipe is almost the same as the Lemon Blueberry Bread on this site, which I have also made. It is nice to know that one lemon juiced is about 3 tbspns., and that you could reduce the salt to 1/2 a tsp. and it wouldn't hurt the chemistry of the recipe. Thanks for the post! ~Tan~

I chose to make muffins out of this recipe, instead of baking it in loaf form. I followed the recipe exact only I did not make the glaze. I just sprinkled each muffin lightly with sugar before putting the muffin pan in the oven. 350* for twenty minutes was just right. I got exactly 12 muffins out of this recipe that were medium sized. The flavor of this quick bread was quite good, I really adore the combination of lemon and blueberries. I think next time, I'd add more blueberries but as is, this is a really excellent quick bread recipe. NOTE: I did not cream my butter with the sugar. I just melted the butter, cooled it a bit, then folded it in with the rest of the wet ingredients. I wisked the dry ingredients together and then folded them into the wet until just moistened to prevent toughness and overmixing.

I didn't have a lemon, so I used 4 TBS of bottled lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract.  I also increased the butter to a full stick.  It turned out  absolutely delicious!  The lemon flavor was just perfect.

This was excellent. Only thing I did different was I didn't melt the butter like it states in the ingredients section.  I just used soft butter added the sugar till light and fluffy.  I didn't change anything else.  My blueberries didn't sink like some others.  It was very thick and it only took mine 60 min in the oven. 

Everyone loved it.

This was such a great combination of flavors.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I only had 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.  It still turned out great!  Next time I'm going to bake it at a lower temperature (maybe 325F for 50 minutes) because it was a tad drier than I like.  My blueberries did sink to the bottom despite the flour coating, but all I did was just flip over the bread and serve it that way.

This was good but too sweet with 1 cup of sugar, which is why I rated it only 4 stars.  By doubling the lemon zest, using 1/2 cup sugar, and by not melting the butter (soften instead), this is a 5* recipe for sure!  I've also made the into cupcakes too and they turn out terrific and take 1/4 of the time!

This is a great recipe, however I changed a couple of things.  First of all, and this may be a typing error, but as another reviewer stated, it is not possible to cream sugar with melted butter and get a light and fluffy mixture.  Therefore, I creamed room temp butter with 1/3 sugar for approx 5 min, then added one egg at a time (beating at least 5 min in between each addition).  Also, I only used 1/2 cup sugar, and this was more than enough for us.  And finally, I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  The end result was a light, airy cake-like bread that was delicious.  As a side note, my blueberries did not sink at all.  I washed them, let them air dry, and then mixed them with the dry ingredients.

This recipe was delicious...I added slightly more lemon zest, since we love lemon in our house. I also used frozen blueberries, and they didn't sink at all. I baked mine in an 8x8 square pan and cut into squares.  Very yummy snack!

I think this was phenomenal!  It wasn't dense and yet it wasn't airy.  A perfect 'breake' (cake/bread).  The berries actually absorb the lemon juice and get a little sour going on.  It was great!  A burst of flavor!  I didn't melt the butter all the way.  Just partly.  I beat it up nice and fluffy before adding the eggs.  Those were done one at a time and I beat 5 minutes for each one.  I coated the blueberries in flour and folded in. I then took out a portion that had alot of berries and added those on top right after scraping the bowl.  This ensured that some berries would be left on top. Also, do not stick the toothpick into the crack it makes while baking.  Normally this is always a little underdone.  It will continue cooking once removed.  THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER!  NOT DRY, NOT HEAVY, NOT LACKING!  LEMON NOT POWERFUL! PERFECT RECIPE!  Hubby can't stay away from it!

This is excellent!!I now know what to use all my frozen blueberries for.I read a few reviews on this and some said that there was not a lot of lemon flavour so I used 1 tbsp of lemon juice,a 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp of lemon extract.I also used vanilla milk instead of regular.It was just the right amount,very lemony and tasty.This is very moist and I will be making this often!

I love this bread! The first time i made it exactly as is. The second time I made it a tad more healthy and used all whole wheat flour and substituted 1/2 cup of honey instead of 1 cup sugar and it was even more delicious! Something about the lemon and honey together. Yum!

Very nice bread/cake.  I took the advice of others and creamed my softened (not melted) butter with the sugar before proceeding with the recipe as written and added a bit more blueberries (about 1 1/3 c.) dusted with flour so they wouldn't sink to the bottom.  I also boiled the sugar and lemon juice glaze and brushed it on while the loaf was still warm.  What I got was a delicious, moist and glossy bread/cake.  Will keep this one on file.  Thank you for the recipe.

Good taste, weird texture - very dense.  I don't think the butter should be melted - creaming it with the sugar might give it a lighter texture.  I will also try making smaller loaves - a full size loaf took an hour and a half to set in the center, and the edges were burned.  I'll try again with modifications - I want so much to like this one!

Very good recipe.  If you don't want your blueberries to sink to the bottom, coat them in about 1 tablespoon of flour and let them sit while you prepare the rest of the batter.  Thanks for the recipe!

When I made this, I doubled everything to make 2 loaves (same amount of work for twice the enjoyment)...what I did differently was to add the lemon juice to my slightly soured milk (had to use it before it was too sour).  I let the milk sit and clabber...and it became more like buttermilk.  Also, I did not melt the butter because melted butter will not cream with the sugar.  Creaming the butter is the essential building block to baking; adding the sugar and beating for 10 minutes or so until fluffy is what determines the crumb of your baked item...I am a caterer/chef and unless I were making a muffin recipe, I would not melt the butter prior to creaming.   I also put in 2 Tablespoons more of my juiced lemon to the doubled mix.  On one of the breads, I sprinkled raw (turbinado) sugar before I put it in the oven...gave it a 'bakery appearance'.  The second loaf had the glaze put on it...both were excellent.  I substituted frozen lemonade concentrate for the glaze...excellent!  Another thing I did was combine 1 part flour to 1 part confectioner's sugar (powdered sugar) in a separate bowl to roll the frozen blueberries in...they stayed afloat in the bread with no issues.

This is very good and tasty, but really sweet!  I will make this again, but will use less sugar (Maybe 3/4c or 1/2 c instead of a cup).  Also, I doubled the blueberries (to 2 cups and make sure to flour them first).  I used frozen blueberries and it was fine.  Added 1 tsp poppy seeds.  Lastly, middle seemed soggy for regular sized loaf pan - maybe decrease temp to 325 and cook for 90 mins (?)  When making muffins, cook at 350 degrees for about an hour.  Made this for mother's day and everyone loved it - am eager to try it again with the alteration in sugar amount.

So moist and delicious! I added the zest of one lemon and it had excellent lemon flavor and color. The glaze was really good on top. This makes a beautiful loaf.

This was great, very lemony. I used a little extra lemon juice, and a powdered sugar glaze w/lemon  juice made it even more lemony. I baked it in a bundt cake (35-40 mins) and it came out short, so next time I'll use a loaf pan. I also used softened butter, and took 2 TBL of the flour from recipe to dust the frozen blueberries with, then added it all to the batter. Very good!

Great cake/bread!  It didn't blow my mind (or tastebuds) so I won't give it 5 stars, but it is very good.  I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and it's just the right balance of sweet and tart.  I used frozen blueberries and dredged them in flour, they did not sink.  I left off the glaze.

Loved it!!  Actually, everyone I served it to, wanted more...bought more blueberries, so my husband could try it.  He couldn't say enough about it...thanks so much for sharing.  It is a huge hit! Did not change a thing...easy.  The lemon and the burst of blueberry...perfection!

Very good lemon bread. Very moist. It was not too sweet: the glaze on top was very tart. I dusted the berries with flour, but most of them still sank anyway.

I didn't have a fresh lemon so I used 2 tablespoons bottled juice.  Probably would've been much better with fresh.  (Not enough lemon flavor for me).  I also didn't have any lemon zest.  It was still very good.  I only used 2 tablespoons of sugar for the glaze.  I will definitley try making this again with a fresh lemon.

This is the best Blueberry Lemon bread that we have ever had.  The taste and the consistency are just the best!  There is only one thing that I would do to the recipe....double it! One loaf is definitely not enough! Thanks Jessica...we LOVE it!

Made this three times in three weeks. The first time I followed the recipe. It turned out great! The second time I was short of blueberries, but I had some fresh peaches tha I diced and added. The third time I went a bit crazy and left out the lemon (i replaced it with vanilla. greek yogurt) and put in fresh cherries and mini chocolate chips. That was a success as well. This has become my "go to" recipe for using up any nice ripe fruits or berries. Thank you for sharing!

Substitute brown sugar in bread recipe, cut zest to 1.5 Tbsp, use confectioner's sugar in icing. Delightful!!!

If the recipe doesn't have yeast, it's not a bread.  So I knew that going in and it turned out definitely more cake/coffee cake like.  Nonetheless, good!  I get headaches when things are too sugary so I did what others did and halved the sugar; and I didn't melt the butter, just soften it.  I lightly tossed the blueberries in 1 T. flour, which is a common thing to do.  Didn't add glaze, like I said I like limiting the sugars.  Took about 75-80 minutes for my new oven.  I'd make it again!  Only 4 stars b/c it seemed a few percent under done, will cook a little longer next time. :)

Very yummy! I have a bread maker and am just getting use to it so baking times are a little different. But It turned out very delicious. The lemon and the blueberries go great together.

This was very good.  My granddaughter thought it was too tart, but I don't like sweet coffee cakes.  My blueberries were large so they were wonderful flavor bursts!  I had some cinnamon sugar left over from snickerdoodles so I sprinkled it on the top.  I will certainly make this again.

This turned out GREAT!! It was more of a cake than bread but I was completely satisfied. =) I did make a few changes from suggestions of other chefs out there.. Instead of using melted butter, I used softened. Also, I microwaved the lemon juice and sugar for the glaze for a little over a minute. Oh and I had to bake it longer than it said, I ended up baking it for about 1 and a half hours. It turned out really moist and delicious.. Oh yeah, and I also used another suggestion to keep the berries from sinking, I put my washed my berries and put them in the freezer while I was preparing and mixing..and getting the lemon zest, then once it was time to put the berries in, I put a tablespoon of flour on the berries and mixed it up. I used a more berries than it called for..but heck, why not? =) Thanks for the great recipe!!

Was very good BUT it was really crumbly and hard to eat for us.  Especially the second day, it was falling apart and really mushy.  However, the flavor was good.  Not sure how to remedy the other problem though.

I made this bread to take on a weekend trip with my daughters volleyball team.  The other parents were actually offereing to pay me to make it for them for the next trip.  Really good and moist and even better the 2nd day. A few extra blueberries never hurts

I really enjoyed this bread.  It was really moist, but it may have been a little bit too dense.  The lemon flavour was just right, not too sour.  It was good with the glaze, but is sweet enough to be served without it also.

This recipe was a delight! I made two of them for Christmas brunch and they went in a snap. The only thing I might consider doing next time is using confectioners sugar for the glaze for a smoother texture, (just a personal preference). The moistness and melding of flavors was sublime!

Great recipe.  The tartness of the lemon zest/juice and blueberries went incredibly well with the rich cake and light lemon sugar glaze.  I used this recipe for three small loaf pan cakes.  If you are using the small pans, decrease the oven temperature about 25 degrees and check for doneness well before an hour rolls by. Thanks for a fabulous recipe Jessica!

Wasn't impressed.  The blueberries sink to the bottom of the bread and it was pretty sugary.  We ended up throwing it away because no one would eat it.

I liked the flavor of this.  Since you cannot cream melted butter with sugar, I just used softened butter.  I also barely wet the blueberries and tossed them with some flour before incorporating them into the rest of the batter.  It helps with the sinking issue.

My husband and I couldn't wait for it to cool.  It smelled so good while it was baking.  It was perfectly lemony, not too overpowering.  The only thing that I changed was that I put the sugar and lemon juice glaze into the microwave for a minute to melt the sugar.  The only reason I did this was that I had used that glaze before on a lemon tea bread and my husband didn't like the crunch (grit) of the sugar.  I will be making this again this week for a friend.  Thanks

I made this and rather than using a loaf pan I used a 6-cup bundt pan which worked nicely.  I was a little shy on lemon juice and zest so mine wasn't as lemony as it should  have been.  In hind sight I should have added some lemon extract to make up the difference.  I tossed my berries in flour hoping to keep them from sinking to the bottom, but most of them still did.  Some of my berries were rather large so that might be the reason.  I ran out of time and lemon juice so I had to skip the glaze.

WOW is the best way to describe it, I think...the sweet and tangy flavors just explode in your mouth.  And it's light, but not airy, just line another reviewer said.  Beat the butter and sugar well, I used it softened as suggested. To keep blueberries from sinking, I washed them and put in freezer so they'd be super cold going in.   I made muffins instead of a loaf, as I have a 4 year old & muffins are an easier "sell." ;)  I used confectioners sugar for the frosting, instead of white sugar. Make it, it's easy and DELICIOUS!!!

This is an excellent recipe!  The lemon flavor goes wonderfully with the blueberry.  My 3 kids (11,8 and 6) would eat the whole loaf in one sitting if I let them.  Definetly a keeper.

This was a very good loaf but I made a few changes. I cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup, substituted 1/2 cup of the flour with whole wheat and used frozen instead of fresh blueberries. It was plenty sweet enough, whole wheat flour worked fine and frozen blueberries did not run as I added them right at the end and just stirred to mix.  Although very tasty, the loaf did not rise much. I'm wondering if it would rise more using baking soda, and yogurt or sour milk instead of milk. I will try that when I make this loaf again.

I followed this recipe exactly except I did not add the glaze. It was pretty good but not fantastic. For as much work as it was I don't think it was good enough to make very often but it was okay.

Very good lemon loaf! Mine turned out very dense, more like a pound cake. The lemon taste was excellent, and the blueberries were evenly distributed. I served it with Microwave Lemon Curd from this site.

Tastes great easy to make I didn't have the problem with the blueberries they all stayed suspended in the bread I used fresh blueberries instead of frozen and pecans instead of walnuts but that's just my personal preference. great recipe

This was pretty good.  Maybe it's just me but it was a little too sour..the blueberries are already sour and the addition of the lemon just pushed it over the edge.  I didn't have any problems with the blueberries sinking (I did coat them with flour).  I used whole wheat pastry flour and replaced half of the butter with applesauce to make it healthier.

This bread is wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I  used softened butter instead of melted. I used frozen blueberries and they didn't sink. The tastes are so good together!

Turned out great!  It was pretty sweet, so I omitted the glaze.  I used a very large lemon and I think that might be key to getting a good lemon flavor.  (You also get plenty of zest that way.)

I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups as some suggested and still found this slightly to sweet.  Maybe I'll reduce the sugar in the glaze also.  All in all a greatly addictive cake!! 
Thanks for sharing!!

I used 1 cup of Splenda instead of the sugar (but still used real sugar for the glaze) and it turned out perfectly...so moist and flavorful. It is a dense cake, but it was delicious but does not rise much. Mine was maybe about 2 1/2 -3 inch. high in an 8 in. loaf pan.

Last Christmas my husband brought home some fresh blueberries from work that didn't get eaten. I looked for a recipe for blueberries and found this one. It has been a huge hit with everyone who has tasted it! It's also wonderful with frozen blueberries. I always double the recipe because it goes so fast. I did omit the walnuts.

I thought this recipes was quite easy to make.  The bread came out slightly crisp on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside.  I used raspberries and it was yummy even though they floated to the bottom (even though they were floured.)  A nice bake sale or gift item.

Absolutely excellent!!! This cake is so nice and moist and has a wonderful taste!  All the extra work of juicing the lemons is totally worth it!!!  I love this bread and will make it again.  I'm sure any fruit such as raspberries or cranberries could be substituted and it would taste just as good!

This is fantastic!  I agree with the others--double it.  My husband and I ate almost 1/2 the loaf within 30 minutes of taking it out of the oven!  I had a little trouble getting it out of the pan, but I used frozen blueberries and I didn't flour the pan.  I might try flouring the blueberries next time.

The texture was a little off and may have been a little better if the sugar was creamed with softened butter instead of melted, but the flavor was very good.

I followed another reviewers advice and did not melt the butter and also used 1 stick of butter instead of 1/3 cup and just creamed it with the sugar.  I used frozen berries and it was delicious.  It got 2 thumbs up from all.

Turned out beautifully. I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and made the glaze with powdered sugar instead of white. I also used a 50-50 mix of blueberries and red huckleberries.

Wonderful flavor in this bread!  However, the texture was coarse and it didn't rise like most quick breads do.  I had trouble getting it out of the pan as well......it stuck!  Not sure if I did something wrong or if it's the recipe but the flavor was so good I will try it again.

I used 1/2 cup of low-fat sour cream instead of 1/2 cup of milk. It gave the bread a pudding-like texture that was absolutely fantastic! The loaf disappeared in one hour ;-)

Super yummy...a big thumbs up from every one in my family from 6-month-old to 11-year-old to hubby! And it feels healthy too! There is no need to melt the butter (or in my case, margarine) before creaming though. :-)

this bread did not really do it for me, which was sooo disappointing!  it sounded amazing.  however, the texture was somewhat weird - too thick and dense i think.  the flavor was good but not great.  perhaps it could have used more blueberries? or some vanilla?  not sure, but i probably won't make this again.  thanks!

Loved this loaf. I didn't have blueberries so I used dried cranberries, which worked great. Also I had some leftover cream cheese icing so I added some lemon juice and lemon zest to it and used that as a topping instead of the lemon/sugar topping. It was AMAZING!!! 

Keep in mind that it takes about 4 lemons to get two tbsp of lemon zest. That suprised me but luckily I had enough.

Flavor is a 5 star, but I'm giving only a 3 star rating based on the fact that this is way more like a cake than a bread.  I was hoping for more of a breakfast bread and this tastes more like a coffee cake.  I do love the lemon/blueberry combination.

This was just the flavor for which I was hoping!  My lemon was small, so I added an extra dash of juice to the "bread," and I was able to use all the zest.  Microwaving the glaze for a few seconds made it mix thoroughly.  It looks like too much glaze, but it soaks in!  Make sure to pick through your pint of blueberries and remove all the stems you can find.

I doubled this recipe, used almond milk and a butter alternative and twice the amount of blueberries called for. It's delicious. definitely more of a cake than a bread- but the flavors are great, the blueberries evenly distributed, and super moist. I'm curious to see how it will taste once it's cooled ,but right now it's nothing short of amazing!

I loved it but my husband and sister both thought it was too tart.  I think next time I'll use less lemon juice in the actual bread.  Or maybe it was the glaze that pushed it over the top for them?  I'm not sure but I will be experimenting.

This was very good - crumbly like a muffin when warm, but firmed up quite a bit overnight.  The lemon flavor was also more subtle the next day.  I thought it was pretty quick and easy to pull together and liked that it only made one loaf.  There are only two of us and I like to bake often so smaller recipes are good for us.

Excellent recipe.  I added a little less sugar about 3/4 cup and a little more blueberries.  The blueberries should be lightly floured before adding to the batter.  This will prevent the colour from turning your cake purple and hold its shape.    Thanks for this easy recipe!

This was very good.  I used 1/2c whole wheat plus 1 cup white flour and made the glaze out of powdered sugar instead of regular sugar.  Will definitely make this again!  Next time I'll try an even mix of whole wheat and white.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm rating my own finished results rather than the recipe here. I followed the recipe except left out the nuts because my hubby is allergic - added half a cup extra blueberries to make up for it. This resulted in a bit too overpowering, bit too blueberry-ish cake; I wouldn't recommend more berries but I think it's still good. I agree that the glaze is a bit overpowering. I only used maybe 75% of ours and it was still a lot. The entire cake was a little too pure sugary for my taste. If I were to do it again, I'd cut the sugar by at least 25%, maybe do a little brown sugar substitution, or maybe some apple sauce sub instead.  But we liked it!

WOW! really tasty! Used Meyer lemons. I also made lemon curd off this site and spread it on the bread. I love anything lemon and happened to have a bunch of Meyer lemons I needed to use. This is great with tea!

This tasted good, but the blueberries fell to the bottom, even after flouring them.  Hmmm..I wonder if there's another trick to keeping them in the bread instead of on the bottom.

This bread is so good.  I added an extra 1/2 lemon worth of lemon juice to the bread and a little extra lemon zest.  I omitted the glaze for the top of the bread to cut back on some of the sugar and also because the bread is so good by itself that I don't think it really needs the glaze.  Will make again :)

Absolutely fantastic: I used the rind of a whole lemon in the batter, and it was just spectacular.  It could stand a few more blueberries but 1 cup certainly distributed through the whole loaf.  I also doubled the glaze.  This loaf is so fresh and light!

VERY good recipe! I pretty much followed the recipe, but only used one tablespoon of lemon zest, and cooked it @ 325 degrees for 55-60 minutes.  Tasted great!  Next time I will try it without the glaze, it was pretty tart with it!

The flavor was excellent but I used frozen blueberries. They all sunk and so made it into an upside-down lemon/blueberry pound cake. (That's what I called it!) I will try again as the flavor was excellent.

My toddler, and I liked this recipe. I actually thought it was a little too lemony. I might skip the glaze next time. I also had the same problem as others did with the blueberries falling to the bottom. It was still yummy though! Thanks!

This was not the best blueberry lemon bread I have had. I really thought you would be able to taste the lemon more.

my 19 month old daughter loved this recipe and i thought it was quite tasty too:). we changed a few things according to other readers comments and to suit us, 1/2c sugar, 1&1/4 lemons, 1 egg 2 whites, 1c flour 1/2c oat flour,1/2 c soymilk, 2c blueberries and no glaze on top. it was sweet enough with the blueberries and half a cup sugar. we will be making these again and again:)

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. My blueberries were all at the bottom (even after dusting them with flour and adding a little more flour to the batter) and it wasn't as lemony as I had hoped. I decreased the sugar to 3/4 C. and thought it was sweet enough. It looks really beautiful and baked up nicely.

I thought this was a great recipe with the lemon/blueberry flavors coming through.  I cut back on the sugar to somewhere btw. 1/2 and 3/4 cup (due to a sweetness complaint in another review) and added more blueberries (dusted w/flour).  I also cut down the fat by using a little less butter and 1 egg and 2 egg whites.  The cake was very fluffy and moist, not dense like a pound cake, which my husband and I loved.  I didn't add the glaze b/c it didn't need it - it was SO good.

We loved this recipe!!! I did cut the flour down to 1C and added 1/2C high whey protein powder and I may make some other smaller changes to try to get the calories down and/or get the nutrition up. This is a delicious recipe!!!

This is delicious but it’s definitely a cake and not a bread. I doubled the recipe and substituted sour cream for milk because we only had unsweetened oat milk and I just couldn’t go there. I found it a little under done in the middle lower part of the loaf, despite baking it for the full 70 minutes. The toothpick came out clean and it seemed totally done, but when it was cool and I sliced it, I found the lower section (where the toothpick didn’t reach) was a but gummy. Still yummy though. I did not make the glaze. It was sweet enough without it.

This recipe turned out really awesome! I agree with others that this is more like a cake but it doesn’t matter, it was worth it and I’ll be making it again. I only made one slight modification; I ran out of sugar so I replaced it with powdered sugar.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was good, but very dense. I tried to do it in a bundt pan like the picture, but I think you need to double the recipe to make that really work. As a result it was a little dry, probably over cooked. If I'd used a loaf pan I think it would have been better. One thought I had to improve the recipe was to poke it many times with a skewer and pour some Limoncello or rum over it. Let that soak in and then add the glaze. I would try this again with that modification.

Tried it twice.  First time followed direction exactly. Was ok.  Second time I just used 8 ounces blueberries and baked for 70 minutes. I also used confectioners sugar for the glaze.  Much Betty than the first.

I doubled the recipe and it was very yummy. I had trouble getting the icing to look like the picture mine was to thin even though I kept adding more confectioners sugar. It ended up soaking into the loaf which was still delicious, just not as pretty.

My toddler loves this. I used whole wheat flour and doubled the frozen blueberries. I turned them into muffins and baked 28 minutes. My oven runs a bit cold and I am on high elevation.

I followed the recipe as is for the bread and used suggestions of using powdered sugar for the glaze instead of white sugars. These are delicious!  I had mini bundt cake silicone pans and used those instead of a loaf pan.  Took them to a picnic and they were a big hit.  Bake for ~20 minutes for the smaller size. I will be using this recipe again!

Very tasteful. The lemon was not over powering. Only did 3/4 c. of sugar. Still sweet enough.

This blueberry lemon bread is very good.  I like that you only use 1/3 cup butter too.  Blueberry & lemon flavors are always a nice combination flavor too.  This bread was very moist.  I kept on having to check that the center was done.  I think I baked it an extra 8 minutes.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

The only changes I made were to use frozen cranberries rather than the blueberries, and I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup.  And I made them into muffins... baked 25 minutes at 350°F in my oven..  check yours at 15-18 minutes, adjust accordingly.  

Next time, I'll double the recipe and sprinkle with sugar before baking.

I've made it 4 times in one month, since I found the recipe.  My tenants love it!  Everyone from a Chinese researcher to an opera singer from Texas.  It goes fast!  Make 2 loaves.

Taste was really good, but I had frozen blueberries and they all sank to the bottom of the pan. I will try with fresh ones next time.

I did not melt the butter , used softened butter and exchanged pecans for walnuts as I didn't have any walnuts.  The loaf was moist and a perfect balance between the lemon & berries.  I also made a glaze with lemon juice & icing sugar.  A definite make again.

Substituted the flour for a gluten free flour mix and the milk with coconut milk. Also I was low on walnuts so I used pistachios. With or without these modifications the bread was absolutely delicious!

This was wonderful, and I agree it seems more cake-like.  I will 1.5x the ingredients next time and put it in a cake pan. I substituted powdered sugar for granulated in the glaze. This tastes like SUMMER.

I made this twice and used strawberries instead of blueberries! It took me ages to find this recipe again because I forgot about the substitution. My whole family loved the bread and so did my friends. I'm about to make it for the third time.

Wonderful! Made a batch with the recipe as is and a gluten free one using some one-to-one gf baking mix. It turned out great as well. While it was still warm I sprinkled some white sugar on top and that was just perfect.

Add 1/2 to 3/4  cup of sour cream. Used 2/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 brown and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Baked 70 mins and it was perfect. Making this again. Husband said I could cook it maybe 5 minutes less, a little too done on top. I will report back. 65 minutes seems to be the time for my oven and hubby  :)

Amazing cake! I took it to a church brunch. The ladies loved it! Followed directions as given with the exception of the reviewers  recommendations- less flour, more lemons. Yum!! I will definitely be baking this one again.

So lemony!  I liked the dense texture.  It got rave reviews from others who had it.  Will make this again!  The only difference is I used confectioner's sugar for the glaze.

This was delicious!  I floured the blueberries before folding into the mix to keep them from all settling at the bottom.  For the glaze, I used 1 tbs of lemon juice and 1 tbs of water and 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.  So good!!!

I am new to baking after a 20  year break. I followed others in not melting my butter and brushing on the lemon glaze. It was wonderful!  Better than any store bought. The perfect mixture of sweet and sour.  I used fresh blueberries and floured them well.  They were evenly distributed throughout the bread. (They didn't all sink to the bottom.) This is not a lightweight bread, it is dense and yummy!!  It was gone by noon in my kitchen. :)

Nice easy bread to make.  I didn't especially enjoy the texture - a tad dense though not too dry.  I would make it again, but it's not stellar to be served to company with tea or coffee.

I made this to take to a dinner with friends. I decided to make 2 loaves, one to taste and one to share, just in case I didn't like it. It was a huge hit! The hostess told me that they enjoyed blueberry things and as it turned out, lemon and blueberries are her husbands 2 favorites! I made the recipe as stated other than I was a bit short on lemon zest and only had half the amount. It still turned out great. I used all fresh ingredients including the lemon juice. My husband loved it although he originally sort of turned his nose up at the sound of the combination. I did flour my blueberries as others suggested and had no trouble with them being all on the bottom. I will be making this many more times! This one and Janets banana bread are my go to bread recipes.

This is such a nice bread!  I did not add the glaze and used frozen wild Maine blueberries.  Great lemon flavor, very tender and tasty. Probably my favorite quick bread recipe!

Lined pan with parchment paper after buttering. Used 1 cup confectioners sugar in glaze. And added lemon zest to glaze. Glazed while still slightly warm and then again before serving.

This turned out very nice. It was super moist.  I loved the lemony taste to it. I followed the directions except I used frozen blue berries as that's what I had on hand.  Next time I will go for the fresh berries.  Overall, wonderful treat.

This is a very tasty quick bread. I like the lemon paired with the blueberry, although I didn't have as much lemon zest as the recipe called for, and think it would have been even better if I had. I used what I could get out of my small lemon, which was only about  a teaspoon, and took the advice of others and reduced the sugar, using a rounded half a cup instead of a full cup, which was plenty.  I will definitely make again if I have lemons to use up.

Mostly followed the recipe, only I didn't melt the butter and I used margarine. Made the glaze with icing sugar, lemon juice and zest.  Turned out amazing everyone loved it. Hubs requested I make another one for him to bring to work!

I made this loaf and it was delicious.  I did not melt the butter though.  It is very tasty and such a nice lemon flavour.  I also brushed the drizzle on instead of pouring over the loaf.  Will definitely make this again

Really nice, moist pound cake consistency! Delicious! I followed the directions exactly. Rave reviews from kids and spouse! Good balance between lemon and blueberry. Will definately make again. My husband ate 1/2 the loaf in his first sitting.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for, delicious and easy! I couldn't find my bread pans so I made a recipe and a half and put it in a 13x9 pan and it turned out perfectly. I did make the glaze as someone else suggested by heating it in a pan and brushing it on. This is a definite keeper!

My family was not excited when I said I was making this. And then they tried it! My two kids, husband, brother and parents all loved it. my brother even requested it for his birthday. I intended to follow the recipe exactly, but was out of milk. I took a chance and used vanilla almond milk and it turned out great!

We doubled the zest and increase the juice to create a lemon ZING to this recipe.  We also substituted wild blackberries for blueberries.  Far and away the favorite of what we made for Christmas!

I've made this probably 20 times now. Its one of my favorite recipes.  I've made it with almost ever berry, (blackberry, rasberry, boysenberry, chopped strawberries, etc) even chopped fresh pear and canned peaches. I like to increase the berries, and add a teaspoon of almond extract.   easy, and delicious

The kids loved it, I'll be making it again. I didn't have walnuts on hand, so I left them out. I also didn't have lemons, so I didn't add the zest, I added 2 extra T of lemon juice. Was very easy to make and very delicious.

We get alot of fresh blueberrys  from our yard. I am always trying new recipes and the family vote was that this was OK not one of the keepers. I thought the lemon was an interesting add and may try it with some of our favorite muffin recipies.

Great recipe.  I added 1 1/4 cups blueberries frozen and tossed them with some flour before adding them to the batter to prevent them from sinking.

My family loved this recipe.  The loaf was gone before I put the glaze on it.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Easy to make and very tasty and moist. This was my first blueberry-lemon bread (to bake and to eat) and I really like it. The cake is moist and not too sweet. Thank you!

Delicious. Light and sweet, with great lemon flavour. I used a gluten-free all purpose flour blend and it still turned out perfectly. Since the recipe calls for the juice from one lemon, that's all I zested, and didn't get anywhere near 2 Tbsp but the flavour was still great.

Followed the recipe exactly. The bread came out very moist! The lemon flavor was there, but left me wanting more lemon. The bread was very dense, probably from over-mixing when the recipe states to mix in the flour and milk alternately. Overall, a good bread to start with, but I will be looking for another recipe.

Perfect!  The combination of lemon and fresh picked blueberries made this bread a favorite go-to recipe. Only needed 60 minutes in my oven. My husband couldn't wait for it to cool before taking a slice; will make again.

Delicious! Lemony goodness and blueberry flavors that work so well together.  I used confectioners sugar and added lemon zest to the glaze.  My blueberries didn't sink to the bottom.  I used a glass pan, it may be the reason why it was done sooner than the time allowed.

I and my mom made this Lemon/Blueberry bread.That bread was so
good until I couldn't stop eating it.I forgot to put the Lemon
zest in.I think the zest might make the bread bitter.This recipe
is a keeper.

Followed the recipe exactly (except I used 2 lemons but only got 1 tbsp zest). My thoughts: I don't see the point of melting the butter. I wouldn't use the zest next time. And you need to dissolve the sugar in the glaze first.

I used frozen blueberries, half the sugar, and subbed applesauce for half of the butter. Turned out great and works well for breakfast. (However, if you are wanting the bread to serve as a dessert, I wouldn't cut out that much of the sugar.)

Lemon and blueberries are a great combination.  This loaf, for my preference, is much better and lighter if the butter and sugar is extremely well creamed together.    This also seem to result in a better flavor as well..........................try this method and you might be surprised at the result.

If you like lemon you will love this recipe.  I didn't have loaf pan so baked for 30 minutes in square pan.  Ate half the pan in one day.  Every bite leaves you wanting more.  I think the square pan rather than loaf pan helps because there is more of a spreading of the glaze on top giving each bite more lemon taste.

I made this into muffins instead of the bread so I could use this while I'm on maternity leave as a quick snack. I didn't have any lemon zest so I added a half tablespoon more lemon juice to the batter, but will pick up lemon zest up for next time. I baked this at 325 for 23 minutes and they turned out fantastic.

omg this was wonderful.. im sure i used less than 1 cup of blueberries but they were still pretty spread out throughout the bread.. also dusted with flour as suggested by other reviewers.. baked for almost an hour and a half.. but my oven is pretty dated.. so idk if that was the reason for the long duration.. didn't use the glaze and felt like i could use less sugar next time as we're not huge into sweet stuff.. super good.. ty for the recipe

This bread is to die for! I am pregnant and there are not too many things I actually enjoy eating anymore. When I made this I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy it was. My husband and one of our friends loved it as well. This is a great sweet treat for tea time, dessert or a mid afternoon snack. Not too sweet but just right. I will bake this many more times.

This was very good. I did not have any lemons, so I just used extra juice for flavor. I also rinsed my fresh berries then sprinkled with flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of my batter. This is a keeper.

Nothing fantastic, just okay.  I have to say that I didn't add the topping at all though, maybe that would've given it some kind of wow factor.

This was nice and moist, with a density that held together in the toaster. It will replace my old favorite Blueberry Muffin recipe I got from you several years ago, based on muffins from a famous Boston department store.

I have done something similar, but I used orange, since am allergic to lemon and lemon oil but not orange. I used frozen orange juice concentrate with a small amount of lime to get the tartness, instead of the lemon juice, and orange zest instead of lemon. YUM. 
If you live in Florida and can get the native sour oranges, do this recipe exactly but with sour orange juice and the zest from the sour oranges. That would be perfect. My rating is for my variant, of course, since I didn't do exactly this recipe. I'm sure this would be just as good (if I could eat lemon.)

I made it as muffins and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and omitted the glaze. They took 25 minutes to cook as muffins and made a perfect dozen. They were perfect muffins not too sweet with a good consistency. You can really taste the lemon but its not overpowering. They were very good I'll definitely be making them again!

Converted this to gluten free by substituting the flour for Mama's Gluten Free Flour Almond Blend and adding 3/4 tsp Xanthum Gum.  Used fresh blueberries and fresh lemon zest and lemon juice.  Also, used splenda instead of sugar.  This is spectacular.  Just the right amount of lemon.  I did coat my blueberries with gluten free flour before adding them to the batter.  Didn't have any issues with the berries sinking.  Don't skip the glaze, it really brings it all together!

What a great treat with a cup of tea!  The lemon is the perfect compliment with the blueberries.

This recipe was wonderful! I followed the directions and it turned out perfect, the people at my church loved it! It wasn't too sweet or too sour, it probably could have used another tablespoon of lemon juice. I also would add another half cup or 1 cup of blueberries next time. 
For the glaze, I used Xylitol, which is a suger substitute that is good for the teeth and tastes just like suger, only a little sweeter. 

Thanks for the recipe! =D

This also works wonderfully with soy milk, either plain or vanilla flavor. And if you stir carefully, you won't get lavender colored batter.

This recipe was a bit peculiar.  The taste of the bread was decent, but it had a rather odd texture... it was very sponge-like and "springy."  It wasn't horrible, but I don't think that I'll be making it again.
