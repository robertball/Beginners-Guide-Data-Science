These were quite good.  Full disclosure, I didn't stick to the recipe exactly as far as the cooking method, but I did stick to the ingredients list other than subbing garlic salt for regular salt.  Rather than adding milk (I left it out) and pan-frying, I upped the parmesan to 1/4 C and ran all of the ingredients through the food processor.  I spooned the mixture onto a greased baking sheet and flattened into nugget-like shapes.  I baked for 15 minutes at 350 and then flipped the nuggets and baked for an additional 15 minutes before serving with a dipping sauce made of sour cream (the bacon and green onion flavors reminded me of a baked potato!), sriracha, black pepper, and a tiny bit of lemon juice.  Delicious!

These are great! I added garlic powder and more Parmesan cheese. I dipped them in a lot of condiments but found they taste good with Ranch dressing mixed with a little bit of soy sauce! Delicious!

I tried this recipe.  Only thing I did different was to add some grated zucchini and left out the bacon. I squeezed out the moisture from the zucchini before adding.   I was not impressed with flavor of this fritter.  I had even added more Parmesan cheese.  It turned out to be more of a pancake with veggies in it than a fritter.

Wonderful, should have made a double batch. At first I thought this is going to be a mess. After frying one and having a bite, away I went. My wife even had a warm up for breakfast, not as good as fresh but good. I would not change anything, just great the way they are. Thank You Momof2

Great but I baked at 375 for 20 minutes then flipped for another 20 minutes.  Served with a yogurt, lemon juice and dill sauce. Nothing could be easier.

Very yummy!! Because I didn't have any milk, I used water instead, and they still turned out fine. They're potato pancakes with cauliflower instead, so good.

We really liked this. We added onion and it was very yummy. The recipe made way more than we could eat, so having it with eggs this morning, I am going to try another reviewers suggestion and baking them next time to see the difference.

This was great, but for some reason for me 1 c. of flour was too much.  I only used a 1/2 c. and they turned out the way I was expecting.  I tried it both ways: pan-fry, and puree and oven bake.  I personally prefer the fritter type pan-fry.  The oven ones for me were thin pancakes.  I didn't like the texture as much.  I will definitely make again, fritter-style as a vegetarian main with sour cream.

This is the easiest way to eat cauliflower ever!! Easy to make. I like spicy food so instead of pepper I added cayenne powder, sweet paprika and salt, two pinches on the cauliflower while boiling and I added two pinches of salt to the wet ingredients. They taste amazingly good.  I cut ingredients in half just to try it. I am trying to go back to be vegetarian like 17 years ago and I am trying all different ways to eat without sacrificing flavor. I know this is kind of fried lol but I am eating so good!! Highly recommended. I think the flavor would make a difference for any palate you might want to try to impress. I did cook 2-3 mins on each side with a little bit of oil but the color you prefer is opt to you. I like light golden color. The flavor did not change. Just how crispy they were. I am bringing my samples to my co-workers tomorrow. Yummy lunch!!

These were just ok. I guess we prefer our cauliflower a bit more traditional.
