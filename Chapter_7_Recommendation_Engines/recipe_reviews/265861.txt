Delicious, simple and keto-friendly. Do follow his instruction to lay out ALL the ingredients, first. The sauce cooks quickly and I found myself scrambling to fetch the few things that I stubbornly left in the cabinet.
If you like bourbon, stir in a capful of it right at the end. I borrowed that technique from a different Martha Stewart recipe and it worked perfectly, here.

Tonight was leftover night and we had a large grilled Rib Eye, I was gonna chop it up and make tocos but came across this sauce. Well as most of you know, if you reheat a steak it can be dry like leather. I made the sauce, then kinda boiled the steak in it to heat it up. OMG! That steak was better then when it came off the grill. Thanks for the recipe, can’t wait to try it on a fresh grilled steak.

This was GREAT and SOOO simple. Loved it - will definitely make again. I used two filet mignonettes and had to use olive oil and butter as I didn’t have duck fat, also used half n half instead of heavy cream, that was all I had.

Yummy, and I'm not a bourbon fan. It reduced enough to just give the sauce an extra nuance that was incredible.

Loved it. Added a ton of flavor to the grass-fed ribeyes we had. Another Chef John winner.
