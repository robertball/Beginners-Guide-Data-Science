Three stars for taste but the broth was full of congealed protein from the chicken. It looked so unappetizing that I threw it out. As I learned today, the chicken must be sautéed first to avoid floaters.  This recipe really should include that information.

Gluten sensitive folks - It was quick, easy and very good. I made it gluten-free with brown rice spaghetti for the noodles, and it was much better than I expected. I made a few changes: sauteed onions, garlic, carrots and celery salt (instead of celery) with the sautee function and then added the chicken and broth. My husband wasn't interested, but he had a taste and then helped himself to a bowl. It's a perfect replacement for canned chicken noodle for those who can't eat gluten.

I read the reviews before making this and I’m thankful I did. I did change some things. Instead of putting everything (minus the noodles) in at once, I sautéed the chicken and the onion with some minced garlic for about 5 mins, then added the rest (again minus the noodles). I also upped the amount of broth to 8 cups. I did make it with 6 cups the first time and it seemed lacking in broth. I also use Better Than Bouillon instead of broth out of a carton. It is a delicious soup!!

Pretty simple recipe.  All 4 of my kids inhaled the soup.  Added frozen pre-shredded chicken at the same time as the egg noodles to save prep time.  Rounded up from 6 to 8 cups of broth and 2.5 cups of noodles without any issues.

I was looking for a quick chicken noodle soup for lunch, with enough left over for the next day. This fit the bill. Not the best ever chicken noodle soup, but that isn't what I was looking for. Quick, easy, lunch in a hurry. Totally did that for me. I've made it twice now, if that's any indication of how effective it was!

I thought this was a good simple recipe.  I didn't have a lot of time so I just threw everything in the pressure cooker, including the noodles! (I used spaghetti rather than egg noodles) and I just threw in the chicken breast whole and sliced it after everything was pressure cooked and then put the pieces back in the pot. All of these recipes say you have to cook your noodles separate but our stove was broken and things take forever to sautee in my pressure cooker, so I took a chance and pressure cooked the spaghetti noodles at the same time, worked great!!  I also added some extra Italian mix seasoning. Easy and tasty!

Very quick to fix with very good results. I'll make this a go-to recipe when I'm in a hurry to fix a light supper and haven't really planned anything. (Defrost chicken in micro while preparing veggies.) Serve with a salad. Voila!

Super easy. Super good. It's everything you want in a basic chicken soup. Def no frills, and sometimes that's exactly what you want.

I will definitely make this again. Very nice recipe.  I put 1/2 tsp of salt  instead of a 1 tsp, and I will cut the salt back again to a 1/3 tsp and I will also cut back the pepper to a 1/4 tsp.

I increased the recipe to be 6 servings and didn't make any substitutions. The soup is a good, simple chicken noodle soup. If I make it again, I may add some other spices.
Also, I used my 6 quart instant pot and was able to increase the recipe without any problems.

I added more noodles and didn't have garlic powder so I used garlic salt and just omitted the salt.  Very simple recipe to throw together.

Came out great !!  The only thing I changed was I used 1 boneless skinless chicken thigh  and 1 boneless skinless chicken breast.  I noticed that the recipe neglected to mention that the chicken wan uncooked.

This recipe was a hit, even with my two picky kids! I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, cooked them whole and shredded them when they were finished.  The egg noodles that I had required a 25 min cook time so I boiled them separately in chicken broth on the stove.  My last tip for others w picky eaters... I left the celery in 4 large chunks so it could easily be left out of their bowls but still got the flavor.

This was OK IMO. Lot of "floaters" in the broth. I like my broth clearer, as I strain mine when doing the more traditional pot on a stove method. Wifey liked it more than I did. Noodles took longer than the recipe said, closer to 12-13 minutes. So, by the time they were done the carrots were falling apart.

This was really good, lots of flavor. Only thing was I used whole grain noodles so it took an extra 6 minutes to saute'.
