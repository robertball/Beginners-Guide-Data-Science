There are four important tricks to this recipe.  One--very very lightly grease the pan.  Two--use a large kettle; mixture actually triples in size during cooking phase.  Three--It will take from 30 to 40 minutes to get to 250 degrees.  Finally, make sure caramels are cooled or they will stick to wax paper.  If too cooled, they will be hard to cut.  I put mine in freezer for 5 minutes after about 10 minutes sitting in pan on counter top.  They were really easy to cut and wrap.

I have read the reviews on this recipe and think I know why some of you have caramels that turn out too soft and some too hard.  First of all this recipe says to cook to the hard ball stage.  The hard ball stage has a range of 250 - 266 degrees.  To find out what degree you should use for your candy, use this calculation...Candy should come in 1 degree lower than indicated in the recipe for each increase of 500 feet above sea level.  For instance if your recipe calls for 250 degrees and you live at 2000 feet above sea level, take 4 degrees off which would come to 246 degrees.  Also, the book says that one day your candy may set using 250 degrees and the next day it may take 254 degrees depending on weather, etc.  You could always use the cold water test...drop a teaspoon into very cold water to see how it sets.  Hard ball stage should hold it's shape when removed from the water and formed into a ball, but should still be pliable.---I HOPE THIS HELPS!!! Kim

This is a GREAT recipe, always gets raves!  A few tips I've found helpful:  First, calibrate your candy thermometer in boiling water.  Should read 212 degrees.  If it doesn't, adjust your recipe accordingly.  I'm on my 2nd thermometer and both have been 5-7 degrees off.  Also, instead of greasing the pan I line it with parchment paper.  The caramels won't be extra greasy, won't stick to the paper and can be easily lifted out when set.

Excellent recipe. For you "new" caramel makers out there, please keep in mind that it's going to take anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour of cooking these to get them to the proper temp, but don't try to rush them along with higher heat or they'll just scorch!  Just be sure to allow yourself enough time when making them and you should be quite pleased with the results...good things come to those who wait!!

I needed a recipe for Caramel Apples - and I didn't want to do it with store bought caramels.  I found that this recipe works perfect as long as you follow these rules:

1) Double it if you want to be able to dip easily.  It does double nicely, although it takes even longer to get to the proper temperature (over an hour).  As someone else had mentioned, make sure you have a pot is MORE than double as high as the caramel as it will expand at one part of the cooking (it does shrink back down).

2) If there are any solids on the can lid of the evaporated milk, don’t add it; it will not dissolve in the caramel and you’ll be left with little chunks in the finished product.

3) Being close to sea level, I stopped at 240F and it was perfect for dipping apples; it set up nicely, and was firm enough to pour the remaining in a pan for chewy caramels.

4) After you remove from the heat, wait until the temperature drops to about 170F or less before dipping.  Otherwise, the heat will cook the apples and you'll get bubbling from the juice trying to escape.

5) I know people here have said that they don't trust candy thermometers, but my guess is that they've never used a good one.  A DIGITAL probe with a wire cord (available at any kitchen store) is the only way to go for these long cook-and-stir projects.  You can set it to alert you when you're at the correct temperature.

I placed the apples on Silpat mats (non-stick pad with silicon in it), which works better then wax paper

I am a caramel-a-holic and when my local candy maker died, I thought I needed to learn to make my own. This is an excellent recipe. The best taste of any caramel I've had, including very expensive ones.
A couple thoughts...if you get tired and can't go the distance to 250 degrees, this recipe is extremely forgiving....stop and try again later. Nothing is ruined by stopping. I found that I needed to stop exactly when my candy thermometer hit 248-250...otherwise the caramels got too hard. Definitely go easy on the buttering of the pan. These caramels have been a huge hit with all my family and friends. I would advise that you plan to make them at a time when you can turn the phone off, get the dog from underfoot and focus only on this---250 degree sugar is nothing to trifle with!

These are very yummy.  My candy thermometer doesn't really work, so we just cooked until it reached the firm ball stage (a drop of the mixture forms a firm but pliable ball when dopped into ice water).  It took approx. 30 minutes of cooking and stirring.  It is very helpful to make this with someone else, that way there are 2 people to get everything ready and take turns stirring, etc.  Don't do what we did and line the pan with foil before pouring the caramel in... it stuck badly to the foil and we almost had a caramel disaster!  We had to fill up the sink with hot water and float the pan of caramel in the hot water in order to loosen the foil enough.  Then we eneded up losing some of the caramel, because it still stuck to the foil.  My fault though!  This caramel tastes so good that we couldn't stop eating it!  Perfect flavor and texture. ******** Made these again a few weeks later but only had 1/2 cup corn syrup.  So I used honey for the rest, and they were absolutely amazing!  So much better than before, and I didn't think that was possible!  ;)  I may try them again sometime with even more honey.  The texture is a little softer, but I like that anyways.

I have not actually made this recipe, but I do make a lot of candy.  I am wondering if some of the people who had trouble getting the temp to 250 degrees were using a non-stick pot instead of a heavy pot - like Farberware or similar.   In the past, I tried making candy in a teflon coated pot, thinking it was the smart thing to do, and my candy invariably failed.  I could never figure out why my Grandma got hers to work and I followed the recipe exactly.  There is something about the non-stick pot that messes up the candy.

I have adopted some Marines aboard an aircraft carrier and send them goodies each week. This week they are getting these yummy caramels.  Due to travel time and heat it is not easy finding appropriate baked goods and candy to send to them.  After I individually wrap them and package well, these should do just fine.  If my fudge made it to them in good condition, these caramels should as well. Wish to thank Barbara for the recipe.  I am from the old school of candy making and am about to throw that ^%&&^ candy thermometer away, almost ruined the candy!  I trust my old wooden spoon and a small cup of cold water better to tell me the correct temp. Worked out just fine this way!  I will be making these often for grandchildren, husband and at Christmas.  I recommend even first time candy makers try this recipe, you will be happy you did.

These are absolutely wonderful: just like those you would buy, except YOU made 'em. I made half the batch and lined a 7x10 pan with salted peanuts... Oh my!!! In order to avoid dissatisfaction, I read lots of reviews on this recipe and paid special attention to two points: (1) it takes about one hour to reach the right temperature, but keep the mixture over medium-low heat at all time, or you will burn the caramel and (2) I took JANIEJANIE's comment into account and cooked the mixture in a non-nonstick pot. Came out PERFECT, sugary and buttery and lots of caramel/toffee taste.

are there more stars?  creamy buttery rich taste, firm to touch but soft and chewy, tastes like a soft Worther's flavored caramel, but oh so homemade.  Used parchment paper to line an 11x14 pan.  Used kitchen scissors to cut the caramels and then snipped them off the desired length and that worked like a charm.  (also thought about using a pizza cutter which would work well too).  These are one of those recipes that you can make to give for someone special on their birthday.  Will steal the show of any holiday goodie tray.  **Make sure to use medium heat and don't get impatient...these take time to reach 250 but you can't rush it with increasing the heat.  Butter at a high temp is sure to burn.  stir very frequently after you reach the soft ball stage, as the mixture gets very thick.  It stirs like cake batter once you get near the correct 250 temp. Used salted butter, as this adds to the taste, and if you don't have a good quality vanilla, skip it; these can stand on their own.  They absolutely melt in your mouth.  Thanks so much for this recipe that is unforgettable and sure to be on every holiday tray I make for years to come.

I have a recipe for microwave caramels, so I used that technique with this recipe and it worked great. I made half the recipe so it would fit in a 2 quart microwave safe bowl.  Mix the ingredients, pop into the microwave for 3 minutes, stir, cook 3 more minutes, stir, then cook for about 15 minutes until it reaches 245 degrees. At that point, I tested every minute until it was done.  So much easier and faster than cooking it on the stove and it doesn't burn.  My recipe says let it sit 10 minutes when it comes out of the microwave, stirring a couple of times, before pouring into the pan.  Be sure to only do half recipe at a time so it doesn't boil over!  But you can do a 2nd batch without washing your bowl and utensils.

I have been making this recipe for 3 years now and absolutely love it!  The first time I made it, I cooked the mixture for 2 hours, because I was afraid of burning it.  I have since learned to put the mixture on the stove at low temp and walk away for about 1/2 hour.  Everything is then melted and slightly warm.  I then turn up the heat to medium-hot (#7 on my flat top electric stove) and cook away.  It takes only about 1/2 hour of my time this way.

This recipe is a keeper.  My caramels came out perfect.  I followed the recipe and did not make any changes.  I cooked the mixture on medium-low heat and constantly stirred.  It took approximately 50 min. to reach 250 degrees.  It is a long and slow process, but the results are well worth the effort.    I followed a few suggestions made by other reviewers.  I made sure not to use a non-stick pan.  I used salted butter.  I used the water test as well as my candy thermometer to reach the perfect consistancy.  I lined my pan with parchment paper.  After the caramel had cooled I was able to lift it out of pan easily for cutting.   I had started out using a knife to cut the caramel and it was just not working very well for me, so I switched to using kitchen scissors.  The kitchen scissors worked out very well.  I highly recommend using kitchen scissors for cutting the caramel.

It does not say if you cook it on high, medium or low. I put it in between high & medium. When I poured it out of the pot into the pan, there were large black clumps where it totally burned on the bottom.

We really loved these caramels.  Thank you, Barbara.  I did make a couple of changes that may help others.  I didn't use a 12 x 15 inch pan.  I felt this was too large.  I used a 13 x 9 x 2 inch to get more height to the caramels.  I could have used an even slightly smaller pan, which I will do next time.  Also, I read other reviews and noticed there was a problem with a long cooking time.  I didn't use a medium sized pot.  Instead I used a large pot that just covered the large burner on my electric stove (my pasta pot).  This gave the mixture more contact with the heat.  Also, I cooked this on Medium heat.  When the temperature reached 225 degrees it seemed to stop there.  So, I changed the stove setting to half way between medium and medium high.  In a couple of minutes the thermometer reached 250 degrees.  The caramels are wonderful, just as Barbara promised.  Thank you for this really good recipe.

Such a good recipe!  I made these for a Christmas gift exchange and people were FIGHTING over the box!  They taste just as good, if not BETTER, then the candy shop caramels. I think weather conditions factor into when the caramels are "ready".  I live in MN and it is winter now, mine were perfect at 245 degrees.  The only change I made was to use dark corn syrup, which seemed to make the boiling mixture much easier to work with then the light corn syrup (it didn't foam up), and I used parchment paper in a 9x13.  At the end I added 1 and a half cups of walnuts at the same time as the vanilla, let them cool, then cut them into squares and covered them in chocolate. If it doesn't turn out the 1st time, don't be afraid to try again, the key is finding the temperature that works with your climate.  It takes me about 30 mins to make a batch, I start on med heat and turn it up a little every 5 mins or so.

This is a great recipe for caramels... I would do a few things different though... first off, i read a review that suggests pouring onto a cookie sheet... sounded great- more caramels!  no... they were about a quarter inch thick- it was pathetic.  So, use the 9 by 13 or the 8 by 8... much better.  Secondly- I would have definitly cooked them under the 250 mark.  Mine are super soft- don't get me wrong, but they arent the type that strings away from your lips as you bite in... they're a little more firm than that, so next time i will definitely cook to about 240-245.  I will also probably just use white bakers sugar rather than the brown packed in there as well... i think the brown sugar gave it a grainier texture, and the were more 'dense' than I was going for- but overall, these are amazing!!! It's always a learning process, so --- A+++ in my book!!!

These caramels were very good, but a word of caution is in order.

The recipe calls for a medium saucepan, I strongly recommend that you use a LARGE one. As the candy cooks, the water boils out (which is why it takes so long to get to 250) which reduces the syrup, but before that happens it foams and increases in volume. If your saucepan is not big enough... well, use your imagination. It is NOT fun spending hours scraping burned sugar syrup off your burners... or so my wife tells me ;)

UPDATE 12/2010:  HELP, I've been making these for years and this for some reason my caramel stuck to the wax paper. How embarrassing...I don't know what to do about that. A great variation I have used last year and this year is sprinkling sea salt over the top when caramel is hot and just put in the dish. I also line my pyrex with tin foil for easier removal of the finished product. People depend on my every year for my caramel making...love love this recipe.

I have been using this recipe for 3 years.  Thank you so much Barbara for sharing.  This year my first batch came out too soft (way too soft)... and instead of trashing it I decided to scrape it out of the pan and reheat it to a higher temperature (I think it was 270 degrees).  BTW - It was a day old, cooled off, and had the vanilla and nuts already.  It turned out excellent, better texture and firmness than ever.  So, it is possible to revive your caramel! I hope this helps save someone elses precious caramel!!!  =)  Ever so grateful, Nicole, California

You can save overcooked, hard caramel!!!  Like so many of you, I cooked my caramel too long and after it cooled it was more like toffee.  Instead of throwing it away, I broke it up and put it back in the pot with about 1/4 cup of hot water and melted it back down.  I cooked it to a temp about 20 degrees lower than the recommended temp and poured it back in the pan lined with parchment paper.  I let it cool overnight and now I have the perfect caramels!!  They are chewy and delicious! So glad I didn't throw it all out and start over!!!

This is a fantastic recipe!  There are lots of great tips here so I thought I'd share one of my own - I wrapped in wax paper pieces that were 4" x 2.5".  I tried several sizes but this is the size that worked for me.

AFter reading reviews I followed the recipe exactly but cooked to 240 not 250. On a flat top stove temp at 5 it took 1 hour. It is light color and soft, delicous. I used pam but would of wiped it with a napkin had I read the review about the grease. A 2nd time I cooked it at a higher temp in between 5 & 6 cooked to 244. I added in about a extra 1/2 tsp vanilla. It is darker, much harder, very good. I topped half with pecans. I poured some in hard candy lollipop molds to make a sugar daddy type pop, so far they are not coming out of the mold easily. I greased the mold but wiped it with a napkin to absorb some of the grease. I also poured this batch onto a silpat in a cookie sheet so you dont need to grease. ( DONT cut on you silpat). Silpats are amazing and keep hard candy such as this carmel, peanut brittles, toffee and hard candies from being greasy. If you dont have a silpat you need one! I have 1 that cost me $5.00 in a cooking store, a tupperware one that was 16.00 and a actual Silpat one that was 16.00 and the only one I do not like is the tupperware one. It doesnt clean well, and though bought at the same time as the others and used the same amount it looks years older. i also dipped an apple at the 244 temp and it looks great havent tried it yet. My tip for this recipe USE A BIG POT. Even being a seasoned candy maker when this started rise in the large pot I used I was nervous. Excellent carmel.

I wish I could give this recipe 4 and a half stars. These caramels are abolutely delicious. I have made them several times, and I have found just a couple problems with the recipe. One, you need a LARGE saucepan. There is no way this recipe will fit in any of my medium pots. And when I cut them into normal size caramel pieces I get approximately 200 caramels, not 60. 

The other thing I should mention is that cooking to 250 is too long. I have a carefully calibrated candy thermometer and when I cook to 250 the caramels are too hard. I have found that 246 is the best temperature.

These are so incredibly awesome!! So smooth and buttery!  I like to use the disposable toaster oven pans (I find them at Wal-Mart) so I can split the mixture to make into different flavors. I've made some with Bailey's, and some with shortbread and chocolate for a homemade version of Twix.

If you try this caramels, you'll fall in love with them!! i'm sure you will not look for another recipe. They taste like a famous brand (and quite expensive!!) of caramels i used to buy, no one would notice the difference.
I'm planning to give them as Xmas gifts to my loved ones, but first of all I have to keep my mom away from them, lol, who can resist homemade sweets??? 
I didn't use any thermometer, so i waited until the mixture was kind of thick and reached the hard ball stage. My caramels were pretty soft the next day, so i put the mixture back into the pot and cooked until they were thicker. Perfect!! thank you for this recipe, seriously this is one of the best recipes i got from this site!! ;)

The caramels had a great flavor. I know a possible reason why some reviewer are having hard caramels. The boiling point and evaporation rates are different at higher elevations.  Where I live,  for example, in Colorado, you only cook the caramel to about 232 degrees and not 250. It can make a huge difference.

Great recipe, I got it just right on the 3rd try! Here are a few helpful hints...Calibrate candy thermometer in boiling water to 212 F. Use salted butter and a dash of extra salt for maximum flavor. I had better luck with 1/2 recipe cooked in heavy 2 quart saucepan, such as aluminum, at low to med/low heat for 30-45 minutes. Pour into 8 X 8 pan coated with non-stick cooking spray. I purchased cellophane candy wrappers online, very convenient! Do NOT attempt on a rainy day or in high humidity.

I made these caramels yesterday after finding the recipe via Yummly. Let me say, one of the best caramels I have ever eaten! I was worried due to some reviews saying cook to a higher temp and some saying a lower temp so I went with the recipe and pulled it off at about 248 or so. Perfect! I halved the recipe and lined a 9 x 13 baking sheet (not the high side one used for cakes but a cookie sheet) with foil and sprayed lightly with cooking spray. Turned out FINE! Left them to cool for hours while we went out to eat and came back and cut them in strips then cut each strip into about 5 pieces and rolled up the short cuts. It made around 60 pieces of caramel this way. Wrapped in waxed paper and sent them to work with my husband where they got rave reviews! I am definitely using this recipe for my Christmas candies. Next time I will try using a 9 x 9 pan so they will be thicker and I won't have to roll them. The resulting product was creamy and chewy and soft and delicious. Tasted like a brand name store bought wrapped in foil. By the way...I found a lot of reviews saying it takes close to an hour or more to get to the right temp...I don't know if mine was different because I did a half batch or not, but mine didn't take nearly as long to get to 250 cooking on about medium to medium high (6 or 7) and it didn't scorch at all. I continuously whisked it and it was fine.

Delicious! So much better than store-bought! The first time I made these, I cooked the mixture to 250F as directed and after cooling in the pan, they were as hard as a rock. I read over several of the reviews again, and thought I'd give the recipe another shot. This time, I cooked the mixture over low-medium heat and stopped at 238-240F (took about 45 min) and it worked! After cooling, the caramels were nice and firm, but not hard. I lined my glass pan with parchment paper, then lightly sprayed it with cooking spray, and after cooling, they lifted out of the pan easily.

I made these caramels for the first time about 2 weeks ago.  It was the first time I've made any type of candy and they came out fantastic.  Far superior to anything store bought.  I made one batch following the recipe exactly except cooking until 248 degrees because I wanted the caramel to be a little softer.  I have made a 2nd batch the same way and made them into caramel pecan turtles and then also dipped some pretzle rods into the caramel, rolled them in chopped pecans and then dipped in melted chocolate.  I am going to use this caramel - cooking until about 245 - to make Chocolate Caramel Pecan Cheesecakes - also from this site - which I give to everyone at Christmas.  No more unrapping and remelting 12 to 14 bags of caramels.  This will be so much more tastey and skips a couple steps.

THANKS for the excellent recipe.

My last face-to-face with caramel was when I was like ten or thirteen. It was a disaster! 

So, needless to say, I was worried. I didn't need to be though, this recipie is great! 

I did find, however, that trying to double-boil the mixture didn't work, I couldn't get the caramel to temp. So yeah, you totally get to stand there and stir for awhile! Totally worth it though. I'm never buying caramel again!

This is a fabulous recipe. I make a double batch.  It does boil up quite a bit.  I use a dutch oven, put everything together except for the quart of cream.  Start it bubbling, then add the cream little at a time, so it doesn't boil over.  After I get all of the cream in there I boil it to 220/224 degrees.  DO NOT cook this to 250 or you will end up with Werthers type candy, like I did on the first batch.  Not bad, but not chewy.  It is easier to make a double batch as long as you plan so it doesn't boil over.  This takes me almost an hour to make, it takes some time so put in a video and plan on stirring.  You won't want the heat too high or it will pop on your hands.  Ouch!  It makes a lovely gift.

I'm sorry to give this such a low rating but these didn't turn out so well for me. It came out like a thick too-sweet sauce. Now maybe it was me: I could not get the temp all the way up to 250 degrees so after 40 min of constant stirring, (which maybe was another error on my part) I had to quit. I poured it into a greased cake pan and waited for it to harden, which it never did. It ended up in the garbage. Too bad. Please tell me what I did wrong!

I must have done something wrong.  I calibrated my thermometer in boiling water first.  I took my time heating the mixture (about 55 minutes)  I tested and re-tested all the time for the right stage of candy.  When I dumped it on the cookie sheet (pre-heated in the oven) I spread it and waited.  When I cut them they were chewy and delicious.  As they rested over night wrapped they turned into hard sugary squares.  Like eating a brown sugar cube.  What could have changed??

There are a ton of reviews, so I am going to let you know what I found most helpful:
cook only to 235F (112C)degrees (I did to 250 on my first batch, they taste great but are very hard, had to put them into the oven to cut them, will probably toss out)
Check your thermometer to be sure it is registering the proper temp.
STIR CONSTANTLY!
Wear long sleeves as it does splatter, a large pan helps with this as well.
Very good caramels, thank you so much for this recipe!!!

These are delicious and chewy little treats.  I haven't ever tried to make any kind of candy so this was my first attempt and I do not own a candy thermometer. I read the reviews before attempting this recipe and knew when the consistency was perfect by testing very often using a bowl of ice water. I would drop the caramel on top of the ice cubes and the drops that stayed on the ice cubes i would poke with my finger when it finally did not stick to my finger I knew it was ready. Also if it doesn't bubble up to almost twice the size it was before heating it may not be ready yet. The Caramel started to thicken a little bit once it was almost done too.  All in all this is the most awesome caramel I have ever tasted :D

This is very very VERY Good!!! I loved them just as is, but I started expirementing with it and instead of putting in a dish to harden, I dipped apples on sticks in the caramel while still in the saucepan. Instant Caramel Apples, Delicious!!!
I don't need to go to the fair anymore, THANKS!

I'm so upset.  I made a double batch of this caramel because I thought it sounded like a sure thing.  I was going to include some creamy caramels in my Christmas goodie boxes that I give away each year. Well, I now have 2 large pans of toffee.  It is THAT hard.  I can chip away at it and get a little shard of toffee.  I started by callibrating my thermometer.  Then I read the reviews and decided to bring it to somewhere around 240-245 to make sure I get a soft & creamy consistency and I am not exaggerating when I say it took 2 1/2 hours to bring it to that temperature (and I started the caramels at 11:00 pm - I was not happy at the end). I stirred constantly for 2 1/2 hours! I had the heat adjusted to between 5-6 - I really wanted to prevent scorching.  At the end I could tell it was not going to be creamy.  I should have done the test where I drop a bit in cold water.  I'm so disapppointed and TIRED. I guess I will have to find a recipe that takes a lot of toffee bits.  I don't know what to assume about the suggested temperature for this recipe.  It did NOT work for me.

I love this recipe, i've made it several times usually for Christmas i have yet to review it but i tried a new variation on it today and it is out of this world good! They are great as is of course but the hubby loves these raspberry caramels from a local chocolate shop here. They are very expensive however so i decided i'd give it a go. I added 2T raspberry extract instead of vanilla. They are so good! Every bit as good as the expensive ones! after they are cooled and cut i dip them in melted dark chocolate and then drizzle with white chocolate. YUM!

I have just begun to learn how to cook at age 32. I rely totally on Allrecipes for not only recipes but techniques too. I tried this recipe yesterday for the first time, having never made candy before. It was fabulous !!! My arm got pretty tired from stirring for so long, but I can't even complain about it, the outcome was well worth it. This is so good ! I still can't believe I made this ! Thank you Barbara for posting . Anyone out there leary about making candy has got try this. This is so easy, you will not be disappointed. Thank you again !

This recipe makes a delicious buttery caramel!  I found the reviews very helpful on this recipe.  I  used honey instead of corn syrup.  I also replaced the evaporated milk with coconut milk.  These two substitutions made the caramel even more wonderful.  I had trouble with the thermometer, but found dropping a little caramel into a glass of ice water (as one review suggested) is the best test for consistency.  Don't give up, it does take a while but is fully worth it, your friends will think you are a genius in the kitchen when you master this one.

After reading other reviews, I took this off the heat at 245 deg.     Recipe wise, I used 200gm of salted butter and cardomom infused evaporated milk. I poured my caramel into a silicone lasagne tray mould and a silicone 8 x 8" square brownie / fudge pan mould. I did not grease or line either. I took a blunt knife round the top edge to free the caramel from the sides of the mould and then simply pulled it out.    THe set was soft and chewy. Perhaps a tiny bit too soft..... I might leave it on a degree or two more next time.    The caramel was really nice. It took about 45 mins in total to get to pouring temperature.    Portion wise, mine were pretty big bits - at least 1" sqare and I had about 150+ of those - so wrapping took some time ! Cutting it was a breeze - no problem at all. I have uploaded a photo (mine is the one with the knife at the top).    I made two large boxes of caramels, one smaller box and 4 gift bags plus some more left to spare. Good recipe to make for including in Christmas hampers. Next time, I'll add some macadamia muts or pecans. I think I'd wrap half as is and coat the other half in chocolate.    This is definately one for writing in my recipe book. Thanks for sharing

My husbands cousin gave some of these to us a few years ago for Christmas and I was in love.  I asked him for the recipe and make them every year to give to friends for Cristmas and always get raves on them.  I cook them to 240 degrees on med hi heat on a electric stove.  I hate cutting wax paper so I went on line this year and found a place in Ohio called Sugarcraft that sales cellophane wrappers I bought the 5x5 squares makes life a whole lot easier.  I saw in sombodys review about using a pizza cutter I will have to try that.   Thanks Barbara for a great recipe.

This is the first time I have ever made candy.  This recipe was very easy.  I have a digital thermometer and calibrated it in boiling water just like some of the reviewers suggested.  I cooked the first batch that I made to 248 when I thought I smelled a little bit of a scorching smell.  I took it off of the burner immediately.  The caramels turned out good but had the hard stick-to-your-teeth consistency and taste of a Sugar Daddy Pop with just a very slight hint of bitterness. 
  I took the second batch only to 243 degrees and it turned out perfect ... buttery, silky and melt in your mouth.

Things to remember  ...  Keep your heat low.  It takes a long time to get your caramel mixture to the right temperature.  If your burner isn't low you will scorch the caramel - it will be bitter.  Secondly, if at first you don't succeed try try again.  You won't be sorry!!!!

Simply divine! I made these last Christmas, and everyone went on and on about them. To be honest, I even surprised myself, as I assumed that making caramel from scratch must be harder than this! A bit of advice - let them sit for 24 hours before cutting. It makes the job a lot easier.

Fantastic! You need to watch it as it gets up to temperature as it tends to catch but this is a fabulous recipe - I've made caramels for years but have now swapped this for my usual recipe as it's easier (and cheaper!) to make.  

Use baking parchment to line your tin (not greaseproof paper) and the caramel just lifts off. 

I found out too late that I had no evaporated milk so I mixed up dried milk powder with water (1 cup powder to half a cup of water) and it worked just fine.

We sprinkled it with salt while it was setting, for caramels aux beurre salé, we also added some chopped walnuts to half the tray - just sprinkle them over and, if necessary,  poke them in to the cooling toffee.  

However, there is one major problem with this recipe:  how to stop eating them???   I'm not too sure my waistline will thank you Barbara - lol! Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe, takes about an hour to bring to temp. DO Not use wax paper instead of lightly greased pan. Carmel fused with paper, total waste. Here we go again.

This will be my mainstay recipe for caramels! It's been my first year to make caramels though I am no stranger to candy making.  I read all the reviews to garner all the good tips to improve any way possible from the mistakes of the others. In the end, I decided to take the advice to increase the brown sugar by 3/4 cup and decrease the white sugar to 1 1/4 cups. I also opted to use dark corn syrup instead of the light. I added approx. 1/2 tsp of fine sea salt when I added the vanilla AND 1 1/4 tsp. of bourbon. I poured all over chopped pecans in my pampered chef baking stone (medium bar pan) lined with foil, sprinkled the top lightly with more sea salt and on part I added chocolate chips. Once the chocolate melted, I spread it over over the section I wanted covered. As a result of this recipe and my taking the advice of many others in the reviews, I have been 'crowned' queen of caramels!!! LOL They truly are wonderful and seriously they are a hit in my family. I have since made 4 more batches in various ways (with & without salt, with & without chocolate, with & without pecans and also with walnuts)....they are wonderful! Thanks for posting this recipe!! Cooking to the 250 mark worked great for W. Ky and it does take the full 50 minutes or so of stirring.

I made these for Christmas gifts.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems.  The recipe doesn't state a temp setting but I used medium high "5" on my stove top and it was perfect.  I didn't have issues cutting them, I suggest using a buttered pizza cutter.

Do not wrap while even the slightest bit warm or they will stick to the wax paper.  Let cool overnight.  If anything, undercook these.  My thermometer was off and these came out rock hard.  I am at high altitude and about 30 minutes of boiling was a good amount of time for my second try.  At this point they were set but still easy to chew.  Use the cold water test and take off the burner when the caramel is soft, moldable, and makes a ball.

Great recipe for softer, not too sweet caramels.  Works wonderfully for caramel wrapped marshmallows (my take on See's Candies' Scotch Kisses)!!!  A medium-sized (3 quart) non-stick saucepan, candy thermometer and non-stick silicone spoon or spatula helps for easy clean up.  Also, try using a glass pan vice a regular baking pan so you don't wreck the surface when cutting the hardened candy into portions.

This was my first attempt at making any type of candy, I found this recipe to be very tolerant   of my beginner skills.  I started making these and realized that I only had a thermometer that went to 220 degrees.  I thought I could just "wing it".  Well needless to say I didn't heat the mixture long enough, so the caramel wouldn't set.  The next day I went and bought the proper thermometer and put the unset mixture back on the stovetop, brought it to 250 degrees and the caramels turned out great.  This recipe is extremely forgiving and very easy to follow once you have the proper tools.

This is an awesome recipe for caramels.  Suprisingly easy to make and taste great.  Definately use a Dutch oven to make them.

Theese are perfect for dipping in chocolate, or on their own! Turned out flawlessly and were a big hit with friends and family. Easy to make too, just take it slow and watch the thermometer. When it hits the right temperature it very quickly browns and thickens so you need to be ready to remove it from the heat and get it into the pan to cool. It took about 50 minutes to hit the correct temperature and I stirred and watched it the whole time. They cut nicely too, but I found rubbing some olive oil on my knife periodicly helped it glide through no problem. Loved these!

I have been using this recipe for a few years now and I've never had a bad batch. It is delicious and perfect!

Few tips:

1. Line the pan you pour the caramel mixture into with parchment paper. This way you can lift it out once it is completely cool and makes for easy cutting and also gives you a nonstick surface to cut on!
2. Cut the caramels with a CERAMIC KNIFE. I use my Yoshi Blades and never have a problem with the caramel sticking and it cuts with ease. When you use a regular knife it hurts your arm and takes much longer. 
3. Make sure you monitor the temperature from 240* - 250* VERY CLOSELY! It jumps rapidly there at the end. 

I let my caramel mixture cool overnight at room temperature prior to cutting. I also buy candy wrappers from Michaels Craft Store for $1.99 and use those to wrap my candies. 

You can store these in the freezer if you are not planning on eating them all right away. I store 1/2 in the refrigerator and 1/2 in the freezer and microwave for 15 seconds when I have a taste for one. Instant satisfaction!

These were absolutely amazing!  My first time making them, they turned out so perfect, I decided to make another batch.  The second batch turned out too hard for my liking, so, based on other reviewers saying they reheated them because they weren't firm enough, to get them to a higher temp to firm them up, I reheated them to about 140 degrees, added about 1/4 c heavy cream, stirred them together, and they turned out AMAZING!  I pressed a little sea salt on the top of about half of them, wrapped them in wax paper, and took them to our Christmas bunco, and the salted ones were the first ones gone!  Totally worth making!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe worked out flawlessly for me and it was my first time making caramels as well. I dipped them in chocolate and they held up great. It did take a while to reach 250F but well worth the wait. I well definitely be making these again.

I did a really half-assed job of cooking this caramel...I just had WAY too much going on at once, two sick toddlers, a huge meal to cook at the same time, etc....and it came out WONDERFULLY anyway! 

I highly, highly recommend this recipe. Caramel I've made in the past has tasted yummy, but never had the smooth consistency I was looking for. This is nice and hard, silky smooth and DELICIOUS!

I made these for christmas and screwed them up big time! First, I didn't realize it was going to take an hour to make.... And before it reached temperature I realized I forgot to add the heavy whipping cream! But I poured it in anyways and cooked for another hour, resulting in some burned ingredients.... And they were impossible to cut after they cooled. We broke off peices and they were kind of a hard candy. I took them to my family anyways... They loved them! So did I! I don't know what you could do to mess this recipe up! Next year I won't forget any ingredients and give myself time to make them... But I will, for sure! Be making these again! :)

These taste soooo good! This recipe is really quite simple to execute, assuming that your candy thermometer actually works (grrrr). Comparing homemade caramels to storebought is like apples and oranges; there's no doubt that homemade is amazing and well worth the time and effort. I made 2 batches... the first one I used the full cup of butter and found them to be a little overly buttery/greasy. The second batch I cut the butter down by 1/4 cup and found them to be just right.  Thanks! :)

I made these the other day and I should have heeded the advice of some people to use the drop test and not rely on my candy thermometer. I over-cooked it :( It tasted great but it was more of a hard candy. I tried again today and I tested it every few minutes once it started to boil and it turned out amazing. So happy I tried again!

These caramels tasted good, but as a first-time candy maker, even after reading many reviews, I still messed up the texture and they ended up rock-hard.  I think that the key may be that the thermometer can only help you get close to the right temp, but the water test works better.  I put a drop in cold water at 240F and got a soft ball, but was concerned it would be too soft because my calculated temp was 249F.  Reheated to 248F and got a rock-hard candy.  It still tastes good, though!  Thanks for the recipe, Barbara!

DO NOT USE WAXED PAPER!!!  Or at least make sure your carmels are not warm.  Mine were just a little warm, but now they are all stuck to the waxed paper.  From what I've read, I guess Parchment Paper works better.  But these are too delicious to toss out, so I'm working on a way to unstick the delicious goo.  Freezing them, and then peeling bits of the waxed paper off under running water worked pretty well.

When my 'caramel making' friend moved away and I couldn't just eat her caramels whenever she made them, I decided I better figure out how to make them because caramels are my all time favorite candy.  I have made this recipe twice now and they have come out perfectly each time and I absolutely love them...maybe a little too much because i can't stop eating them and they aren't so good for the waistline but they are delicious!!! They do require a long stirring session (approx 45 minutes) to bring them up to 248-250 degrees but its worth the effort.  I use a heavy Le Creuset pot which I believe is ideal for this type of recipe.

LOVE these!  They are easy to make if you follow the recipe - you do need to stir for about 50 minutes (I was was somehow hoping it would be different for me but it wasn't!) I would recommend a good candy thermometer and I had to use my big pot to cook it in.  I started in my large saucepan but it kind of "foamed" up when it started to get hot and it was dangerously close to going over.  I peraonlly would recomment putting it in a 9x13" pan instead of a 10x15.  I thought the caramels would be better a little thicker.  I also added sea salt to the top after they had cooled for about 15 minutes....DELISH!  Will definitely do that again!  FABULOUS!

Absolutely delicious! I did make a few alterations...I cut the white sugar to one cup & the brown sugar to 1/2 cup & it was still plenty sweet. I can't imagine how intolerably sweet it would have been otherwise. 

I also used my first batch as a dipping sauce for apples, as well as a syrup for ice cream, so I only boiled it on low for about 30 minutes for just the right thickness.  Fantastic recipe!!!

These caramels were so soft and chewy, with a make your mouth water flavor.  They weren't as smooth as I would have liked, but still really good.  I wrapped them up in wax paper and gave them as a gift.

Very good, creamy and chewy.  I added some finely chopped pecans after adding the vanilla.  I think that they are easier to handle when allowed to stay in the pan for an entire day before cutting.

I used this recipe as a topping for cheesecake,  cooking it just until softball stage. Yummy and gooey.  I've been looking all over a caramel recipe that actually tastes like caramel.  This is definitely it!

These are amazing.  Make sure you use the Cold Water drop method to see when the candy is the right stage you want it.  I'll be making these again and try to go for a carder candy, but these are amazingly rich and creamy. My wife LOVES them.

First time ever making caramels, or candy of any kind, and it was surprisingly easy to do and turned out so much better than I thought it would!!!!  The caramels are delicious ... better than the ones I buy at the store.  The extra tips were so helpful, like not using a lot of butter while cooling them (I sprayed with pam and then wiped most of it off).  The only problem I had was that I didn't wait for them to totally cool before I cut them and put them in waxed paper, so they stuck a bit to the paper.  I will remember with the next batch :)

Easy and gained my 92 y/o grandfather's approval. Not bad for a first try.  I cooked a bit too long and would fix that by taking it off the heat a degree or two before it reaches temp.  The final product was just a bit less "chewy" than I wanted.

I made these last night.  The flavor is great, however, cooking to 250 made them very hard. I even scored them while still warm and had a very hard cutting them. Will make these again, but will not cook to 250. Great flavor.

Love this recipe! Made a batch to dip pretzel rods in, rolled them in toasted coconut and chopped macadamias, and drizzled with dark and white chocolate. Yum! Makes a big batch though. Use a 4qt saucepan at least. I cooked it to 248, because my Calphalon pot would hold enough heat to account for taking it up a couple of degrees.

I just burned the heck out of these caramels.  The directions don't specify what temp to put the burner on, and I was looking at other caramel recipes for tips-- one said to stop stirring when the mixture began to boil.  I think this is what caused it to scald.  I had it on medium heat.  Are you supposed to cook them on low?  I sure wish the instructions had been more specific, as I have never made caramels before.  I'll try again another day and cook them on low, I suppose. Bummer! I hate wasting that much butter and sugar!

You know what is like, if you believe Jays old slogan, "Bet you can't eat just one".  Definitely 5 star rating.  Definitely use large pot.  Regular sauce pan will NOT be enough as it does boil up especially at the beginning.  1st time I made these, my candy thermometer measured 250, but caramels were harder than what I expected.  My thermometer may be the problem.   2nd. time, I used the cold water method.  When a small amount was placed in cold water, I felt the consistency I wanted.    I strongly suggest you use both, and when temp rises you can begin to drop into the cold water.  I also wrapped in plastic wrap.  Using the kitchen table I could wrap about 20 at a time.  Just space them far enough apart and spreading them out along the long end of the wrap.  I did this on both sides and rolled them toward each other.  Then cut with scissors to slice the wrap in half length wise, then for each individual drop.  Wrapping does take the most time.  1st. time I had a difficult slicing as it was just too hard.  2nd time much easier.  Next time I will cut while still somewhat warm.   Please try these.  You won't be sorry.  I'm sure if you have family members, it won't last long.  Hope this all is a great help to you.

Very good.  It is important to note that it does take time; however the results are worth it!  Lots of requests for these around the holidays.  UPDATE - after making these several years, I think I've found out why they take so long to get up to temp for me.  The heating element on my electronic stove cycles.  Keep that in mind if you are making them on an electronic stove top.

OMG...these are seriously addicting! I took WhataDish's suggestion to use part honey & used 1/4 cup of honey & 3/4 cup of corn syrup & cooked to just 245 as I didn't want my caramels too hard. I used part of the batch in pecan turtles & then poured the rest into a buttered pyrex baking dish. Had a little problem w/ cutting them. Tried freezing them for 5 minutes as suggested by somebody but the edges were difficult to cut & the center was still a bit gooey. So I cut off the edges (used my pizza cutter) & stuck the center in the fridge for a couple of minutes. I suspect that I probably should have just let them set up at room temp though. I cut mine into really small pieces to make them easy to eat. Love this recipe...thanks Barbara!

These are excellent. I have made these over and over again for the past several years. This is the first caramel recipe I tried and I'm sticking with it!   I live at 900ft and heating to 249 degrees works perfectly for me. It only takes about 25-30 minutes on my gas range to reach temperature VS. a full hour at best on the electric stove I used to have. I turn the heat to med/high then high shortly after on my super burner and stir CONSTANTLY. I've always used a non-stick LARGE pot and they turn out perfectly every time. There is a comment here about how to determine boiling point and adjust the temp accordingly based on your elevation. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

When I was a little girl an older neighbor would sell his homemade caramel around Christmas time. Since I've been an adult, I've searched high and low for "Mr Henry's" caramels. I actually tried this recipe last November, and this year I'm already getting request for more! Thanks for giving me "Mr. Henry's" famous caramels.

They were great, except around 230 degrees my butter started to separate. So i kept going until it reached 250. On the finished caramels I had to scrape the butter off the top. (Any ideas why this happened?) 
Over all, I would make this recipe again.

Good, easy, recipe. I used two candy thermometers. Dark brown sugar, added salt, used parchment paper in a heavy, pottery type pan 5x9 for poured hot Carmel. Hint, set four glasses on top of parchment while Carmel was cooking. Removed just before pouring. Used blue painter's removable tape on two outside sides to hold down paper while pouring. Carmel filled pan perfectly. I cooked the ingredients on 4 for one hour occasionally stirring with wire whisk, making sure sides were whisked into center. The hour is needed to break down all sugars in mixture; this is a food science technique. Important to use fresh ingredients with salted butter. I stopped at 235 degrees with raised burner temp to 5 for the last ten minutes past one hour. Stirred rapidly after adding vanilla. Cooled on other stovetop burner, then hour later, placed parchment sheet on top and placed in non used oven. Directions did not indicate refrigeration, but due to dairy in product, I did. No problem cutting with good poultry scissors after cooled four hours later before refrigerator. Could use added orange, rum, or other flavored  liqueur to boost flavor beyond just good vanilla. Stay close by if you have never made candy before. Sit on a stool with a book and check thermometer frequently. Carmel was perfect, not too soft and not too hard.

I read all the most negative and positive reviews for this recipe and I was a little nervous that I was gonna screw this up since it was my first time making caramels and because so many people had problems. I actually had to use whole milk instead of evaporated milk because I realized I forgot it and I already had all the sugar and butter in the pot but the recipe STILL worked! I think the key here is not to over cook it and not to undercook it. Don't turn the heat up too high because that will scorch the caramel. Sugar burns really easy. I am at a very high altitude so I thought to be safe I will stop the cooking at 220 degrees and they turned out perfect. I used raspberry extract instead of vanilla. They are absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I forgot to add that if you decide to make these and are new to caramel making, please keep in mind that it can be a lengthy process.  Mine generally have to bubble away on a med/low heat for a solid 45 mins, maybe more until they reach the 248 - 250 degree area.  Also, please, I beg of you, do NOT substitute margarine for the butter.  Yes, a cup of butter is a lot, but all things in moderation.  I never, ever, make these more than twice a year (no matter how bad my cravings might get!)  My Christmas batch is bubbling away right now.  I sometimes, (like now for my Christmas batch), use real vanilla bean ... just split and scrape a bean as per normal.  The little black flecks in the caramels look sooo yummy!!  No doubt about vanilla in there at all, that's for sure.  If you're not big on vanilla, skip it altogether -- these caramels have enough of their own flavor that it can easily be left out.

As a culinary arts student, I've learned to cook the sugar until it simply caramelizes. It should be a consistency to where it doesn't drip like water but it DOES drip. A good twist to add to it is cinnamon.

Marvelous recipe ... I've made many a caramel but this was a sure fire tasty recipe.  My in Laws are allergic to nuts but love pine nuts so I toasted them and added them to the mix.  They came turned out beautifully!

This recipe was practically perfect in every way!  It made a large pan of caramels that everyone loved.  I will say I lined my pan with parchment paper, so that I didn't impart any extra grease onto the caramels, and I topped the caramels with very coarse salt once they had cooled but not completely hardened (because sweet and salt are made for each other).

I made this yesterday. I didn't cut the caramels right away (a mistake). Today, I couldn't get the caramels out of the pan. I had to heat them in the oven to soften the bottom. Mine turned to toffee, but it is still yummy!

This was a huge hit at a New Year's Eve party.  I brought 3/4 of the batch, and between 4 couples and 6 kids, they were either eaten (most) or taken to go (what was left).  I've never had a sweet treat go so fast or get such a positive response!  I will definitely be making this again.  I did use very light butter, and in a 9x13 glass dish the caramels came away from the sides perfectly and were just the right thickness.  I believe a 10x15 pan would make them a bit too thin, but I like my caramels larger than the Brachs size.  The yield was the same (5 dozen).  I also cooked in a 12 quart pot, and it took a little over an hour to complete the cooking.  Nice, soft caramel, fantastic flavor and no fillings lost.

I have made these caramels twice now.  One time using evaporated milk and the other time, condensed.  Both came out the same and were excellant. In both cases I used about 25% less butter as other reviews suggested and this appears to have no negative impact.  I cooked in a heavy pot and found that after I turned off the heat and poured into the greased pan, the remainder that I needed a spatula to get out of the pan heated up to the hard ball stage and the few caramels that this was poured on was much harder to cut and was not pure caramel.  On the second time, I had a spatula waiting and continued to stir the batch for at least 30 seconds after I removed from the heat.  This helped a lot.  These caramels I think need to be stirred most, if not all of the time.  If stirred well they seem to do fine on a medium heat.  It took 45 minutes in both cases to reach 250 degrees.

I would've given this 5 stars if I didn't have to make changes.  I used 2 tsp. vanilla and added 1 tsp. salt to the recipe because I used unsalted butter.  Used whipping cream instead of heavy whipping cream because I couldn't find any unexpired cartons at the store.  When I made this, I cooked to 250 degrees, poured it into my 11x15 pan and let it set overnight to cool.  The next day, it was a gooey mess.  Put it back in the pot, melted it and cooked to 260 degrees before pouring it into a 9x13 pan (the other pan made really thin candy).  After it cooled it was perfect.  I don't know what the problem was with my temperature because I've read some reviewers say they cooked it to 240 degrees.  My thermometer is correct; I did the boiling water test to check!

Just delicious!  Chewy and soft...beautiful.  Easy to make, but took about 45 minutes to get to the right temperature....but it was worth it.  will definately make these again!  Everyone i served them to loved them - they even said they were better than bought caremels.

I am amazed... I added a full can of evaporated milk... oops... and these carmels still turned out wonderful!!!  Highly recommend something this failproof.  Again, plan on spending a long time over the stove and wrapping, but prepare to enjoy the results... even if you DON'T follow the directions exactly! Also, remember to use a plastic knife to cut the carmel... slides right through.

Leave it to me to mess up the "fail-proof" recipe! This tastes YUMMY! But it was very hard work. As someone else mentioned, I had a hard time getting the temperature up that high. Took for-e-v-e-r. I finally reached it, then after completely cooling them in a pan, they were VERY gooey. Not even close to just "cut them and wrap 'em anyway"! I ended up scraping it off the pan back into a sauce pan (after completely cooling) and RE-BOILING the mixture. Got it to 250 again, followed reciped and the SECOND time around it was perfect. Tasty and I am sure it is a staple on weight watchers (ha). The taste isn't an issue here - it's perfect from the start! The consistency is the trickiest part (FYI!).

Buttery, soft caramels.  Everyone who has tasted them has went crazy for them.  I will make this again.  Be careful not to burn them and with most candies, it takes quite some time for the candy thermometer to reach 250 degrees, so be patient and stir!

These are very easy to make.  Thanks so much Pawspatch for your hint.  I live at 4700 feet so they are perfect at 241 degrees. A good thermometer is key when making these.  I used this recipe to dip pretzel rods which I then dipped in chocolate. Fantastic!

These are a wonderful treat!  Just make sure that you have plenty of time set aside to make them.  Stir them constantly to prevent scorching, and only cook them to 238 F, or else they will turn out too hard.  A great recipe-will definitely make again.

I actually made these caramels on Dec. 23, and if you were to read any of the previous reviews, the IDENTICAL thing that happened to MICHELLEJ04 happened to me as well (it is so wierd, it is almost as if she wrote my review...it must be a Michele thing, also being a Michelle, but with 1 L).  Well anyway I finally got around to putting them back on the stove & WOW, I'll tell ya, these are soooo good.  I went on to use some in the Christmas turtle candies (from this site) and those are the best I've had too!  Thanks Barbara!!

The caramel was very good, but I tried to use it for caramel apples and it got VERY hard on the apples. You couldn't bite into them.  I don't recommend this caramel for anything but caramel candies.

I'm a first time candy maker, and I found this recipe very easy.  It took quite a while to get to the right temp, and lots of stirring.  Well worth the time, though.  I had to keep refrigerating these as I wrapped them.  Quite messy as they softened a bit. I could have maybe cooked them longer.  These caramels taste better than store bought, but I think that I will keep them for holiday gifts only.

Something is wrong with the temperatures in this recipe: 250 degrees F does not equal 110 degrees C as is says.  When I heated my caramels to 250F, when they set, I could not chew them.  I thought I did something wrong (and I did, I forgot about adding the vanilla after it cooks, so I added everything at the same time) so I tried the recipe again.  Once again, the caramels were very hard, though a bit softer than the previous batch since I heated them a few degrees less than 250F.  From another review I just read, I see I'm not the only one that had the problem of having hard caramels.  Next time, I'm going with the given Celsius temperature (which comes out to 230F).  But, overall the flavor was nice, very buttery, although to the point where I could not indulge in them as much as with the lovely Milk Maid caramels from the store.  Maybe I went into this recipe hoping for the Kraft creation, but I still have yet to yield similar results.  Seems all caramel recipes are such as this recipe.  I think I'd stick with the store bought caramels, even if these did get softer.

YUM!  This is a VERY good caramel.  Next time, though, I will cook to a few degrees higher to get a chewier texture.  I want a little more tooth to it.  You don't need to stir it constantly but close.  Don't walk away.

Absolutely fantastic! These taste like the "secret recipe" of our local candy shop maker. I read all the reviews and can't thank everyone enough for adding their ideas and tips. Patience was the key to this recipe. I used a metal digital probe to monitor the temperature, but still kept a cup of ice water close to test the stage as well. Stirring constantly made this recipe so smooth and creamy! If I hadn't read the reviews that cautioned for patience I think I might have given up after 30 minutes, but it took 40 minutes for mine to get up to the 250 degrees, and they are perfect! You can see the consistency change when the temp gets close. All I can say is it looks the closest to caramel when the temp is around 245 and at 250 there was no doubt I had a great batch! Use parchment paper for absolutely no sticking and no greasy residue, and kitchen shears to cut them into perfect pieces. Make sure you have plenty of time for this recipe because you just can't rush it. Now I have plans to make these over the holidays for gifts. Love it! Thanks so much for sharing!

Have made this twice now and both have been exceptional! I had tried other recipes with no success. The whole batch usually goes in the garbage. Not these! (check my photo). The only advice I can give new caramel makers is the same that is said here..... Patience, patience, patience. I start off on low until everything is melted evenly and then turn up to med- low and let it go the whole time on med-low. More like 45 minutes and a LOT of stirring, but EVERYONE who has tried these wants me to make a batch for them. Anxious now for Christmas to make these for gifts

Great caramels. Made these for my coworkers and they loved them. Sprinkled sea salt on half and dipped the other half in chocolate. Turned out amazing! Easy recipe too.

I read several reviews and took note: calibrated my thermometer, used a  NON nonstick pan, lightly greased my pan, etc.

I ran into one disaster after another, and I am going to tell you how in the end my caramels came out so perfect that they literally melt in your mouth!

Everything in the pot and i am stirring stirring stirring and singing ,I 've got all the work I need..., I was wondering why this pot of bubble goo ain't going nowhere.  Then I see it, a CLOSED can of evaporated milk!

I put the one cup of evaporated milk in a cup and heated it to boiling in the microwave.  I then slowly poured it into the bubbling mixture.

It seemed like an hour had passed and my thermometer was not getting to 250.  I decided to do the ice cold water test and it seemed like it was pretty firm.  I poured it into the LIGHTLY greased pan and let it cool.

This stuff came out like cement.  I chiseled off a piece and my teeth were literally stuck together after i took a bite.  It was GLUED to the pan.

QUICK THINKING!!

I put the pan in to oven at 350 for 5 minutes.  The caramel got to where I could peel it off the pan.

I got my Blendtec mixer and put in 300 cc of heavy cream (leftover in the carton form the recipe) .  I then stuffed in 3/4 of my disaster and ran the soup cycle three times.  The stuff got REALLY hot and very smooth and silky.  I poured it into a different pan,  a glass one sprayed with pam.  I let it cool COMPLETELY. It tastes perfect and I am out of ...

Perfect!   My first batch was doubled and I had no problems.  A double batch is a full 5 pounds and everyone who received these was  just delighted  with many requests for more  when i make them again.

This recipe is so delicious and so good! I've followed it exactly several times and EVERYBODY loves them. They have the best flavor! You can taste the vanilla and I love it. The recipe makes a 9x13 pan which i cut into approx. 1 inch squares, so that makes about 100. 

It takes a long time to get to temperature, maybe 30ish minutes? And it will turn the color of caramel and have big thick boil bubbles when it's ready. Oh, I have discovered that cutting them with greased scissors works really well!

Note: I have tried at least 5 different candy thermometers and they are never, NEVER accurate. The last one was the most expensive/fanciest one, and it just stopped at like, 200 degrees! I now just rely totally on the ball in the water method. I always worried that it wouldn't be accurate enough, but I've had better luck with that than thermometers. However, if you're going to use a thermometer, I like to calibrate it by putting it in ice water and seeing how far off from 32 degrees it is. Then I add or subtract that much from the finishing point of the recipe. So, if in ice water it says 40 degrees, and the recipe says cook to 250, I will stop at 258. Elevation can make a difference, too. In high elevation, I usually stop a few degrees early.

Very easy and delicious. I live very close to sea level and 250F was perfect for a result of soft, chewy candy. I took my time bringing the candy to temp by starting on low heat and gradually increasing to just over medium. Took approximately an hour and a half.

Wonderful caramel with old time flavor!  The only change I made was to use a 9 X 13 pan.  I wanted my caramel to be a little thicker so I could cut them into squares.  I also generously buttered the pan, then dabbed up any excess oil with a paper tool after I dumped the Carmel out.  I was too afraid it would stick.  Yummy!!!!  I think I'll melt a few down later and make caramel popcorn balls!  Thanks for sharing!!

Awesome! My first year making candy, very simple to do.  One person mentioned that the heat is not specified...correct...I melt the butter on low then turn up to medium and add the rest of the ingredients stirring nearly constantly.  It does take a while to get to 250F and it grows considerably; I use a 3 quart saucepan and it works fine.  Cutting it can be a bit difficult, I ended up using a non-stick pizza cutter and it worked out good.  Wrapping can be time consuming and a bit wasteful of the paper if not cut properly but is an absolute must.  The finished product though, is a very enjoyable treat that everyone will love!

Phew! After about an hour and a half of constant stirring, these are magnificent. Make sure you have a good candy thermometer, a patient and attentive hand, and a clean, lightly greased cookie sheet. I suggest sprinkling on some coarse sea salt. It makes them look beautiful and taste even better. Cut these into SMALL squares. They are rich and very chewy! Great recipe!

Just made these today.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and bought a 4 qt. pot that was NOT non-stick.  Took about an hour to get to just under 250 degrees on candy thermometer with 1 minor adjustment to the heat.  Added a bad of chopped pecans, delicious!

I love these! But I sprinkle a few pieces of sea salt on the bottom of the pan before I pour the caramel in. The salt enhances the flavor so much. I can't get enough of them!

These caramels are awesome! Everyone that tried them said I should sell them and they keep asking for more, saying they're the best caramels they've ever had. Though it is labor intensive, the worst part for me was cutting and wrapping them at the end. I think next time I'll buy pre-made candy wrappers rather than using wax paper that kept sticking to the caramels. Definitely a recipe that I'll be keeping!

Fantastic!  Read the reviews for advice.  You MUST stir constantly for about 1 hour!  Additional ingredients - bottle of wine, a movie and good friends to take shifts stirring.  Will definitely make again.

These were phenomenal!! does take a bit of time (especially the wrapping) but well worth it. Watch the stages, I used a candy thermometer but also took the suggestion of other reviewers.  Delicious!

Very easy, and good recipe!  Tastes like Worther's Soft chews!  Summary of my experience and advice.

1. Use 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar. The Brown Sugar adds a nice richness.

2. I replaced the whipping cream with Light Cream, and it turned out just as well as the original.

3.  you will be standing at your stove for awhile, so get comfy. Remember the key to keeping it from burning is to start low, go slow, and KEEP STIRING!  You can let it set for about 5 seconds, then you need to  move it around a little. Start it out on low heat (my stove goes from sim-7 i started on about a 3) when the temp on the thermometer stalls out bump up the heat just a little (i went to 3.5) and.....KEEP STIIIIIRRRRIIINNGGG!!! i bumped mine up all the way to a 4.5-5 by the end.  But remember to make a good carmel speed is not your friend, the sugar needs a good amount of cooking time to turn into a nice rich flavor

4. the first time i made this i took it all the way to the reccommended level of 250, i thought it was a little on the tough side.  The second time i made it i stopped around the 242-245 mark. I liked this temp better as they were not as tough but still chewy.
5
. This is excellent in cookie bowls. Press cookies into minimuffin tins making bowls. Bake as directed.  Let them cool.  fill with carmaely goodness and let set up.  They'll rock your face off! :D

Seriously Amazing!!!! My first time making caramel and they came out perfect. I read a TON of reviews and was really nervous about the rainy weather we had yesterday and that I wasn't going to know the correct degree to take them off the heat for NC (246 is when I ended up stopping them)  I used an 8qt stainless pot, unsalted butter, stirred the bottom the entire time but not the sides. Cooked to 246 degrees (that took me over an hour) then poured into an 11x13 pan lined with parchment paper - I did not scrape the sides or bottom into the pan (but I did scrape what remained in the pot onto a piece of parchment paper on the counter  - couldn't let all that yumminess go to waste! It isn't as good as what came out of the pan but still tasty) I let the pan sit out all night then flipped the pan onto my cutting board and cut into 1" squares and wrapped in wax paper. Cannot wait to share these!!!

This is such an easy recipe to make, and I don't own (and never have owned) a candy thermometer.  I simply use the ice water/hard ball method to determine if the caramel is ready.  Works everytime! It is buttery and addictive.  I use my Pampered Chef jelly roll pan; first I VERY lightly butter the pan, then I sprinkle sliced almonds, or coconut, or mini morsels, or any other kind of "topping" I want on the caramel.  Then I pour the liquid amber in to the pan.  When it is cooled and cut...Oh My!  what a delight!

Delicious! I've made this twice so far and the flavor is fantastic. I think though that in the future I will stop at 240 degrees. Because though the flavor is delicious and I did test my candy thermometer first, I found that 250 makes for a harder caramel than I'm looking for. I used parchment in a ceramic rectangular platter with a slight edge to cool in.

These are absolutely yummy. I am from the UK and would describe this more like chewy toffee than caramel in fact it tastes much like Thorntons special toffee which is delicious and hard to get a hold of in the USA, so thank you so much for posting this recipe.

wow, I was really nervous  about messing up this candy, sometimes ingredients can be a bit pricey.. This was my first time making caramel candy and it turned out perfect. I didn't use a special pan, thermometer or any other techniques- I just fallowed the recipe given and crossed my fingers, I did check with a cup of cold water because I wasn't so sure how my thermometer worked. ... They turned out perfect.. I just cooled in the fridge for about 40 minutes.. place on parchment paper, warmed a knife up with water, dried it and added some butter so it would stick, cut into perfect little squares and wrapped.. :) ( When it was done cooking, I turned off the stove, stirred in the vanilla flavoring and added about 1 1/2 cups of chopped pecans.  Good luck!

My results were about 2 stars but I'm sure it's from "operator error".  The flavor was good (certainly not better than anything I've ever bought) but I guess my candy thermometer was off.  My end results were hard and nearly impossible to cut.  I was terribly disappointed.  I think I'll give up any attempts at making candy.

This was my first go at caramels.   I ended up making 3 batches, and each one turned out great.   I forgot the vanilla in the first batch, but they were tasty without it.    I followed a lot of the tips listed by other reviewers- calibrating my thermometer to 212 degrees F with boiling water, chilling the caramels a bit in the fridge, and did hard ball testing with each batch.  (drop a bit of caramel into cold water, if it holds it's shape but is still pliable, you're done!) I used a cookie sheet, lined with pan lining paper- parchment one side, foil the other parchment side up.   Just what I had on hand, worked well.   Doing it that way, I ended up with about 10 dozen or so per batch.    I found when wrapping the candies having a bowl of water to dip my hands in periodically and a clean towel to dry them on kept my hands clean and not sticky.    I sent these all over the country, they ship beautifully.   I cooked mine perhaps a littler lower than I could have, I was afraid I'd scorch them, and it took about an hour per batch.   (I live 500 ft above sea level, so probably just a bit low on the temp)  Still, the patience paid of.   I love this recipe, and so has everyone I've shared them with.

Great recipe! I read through several pages of reviews and I am so glad I did. I made a few changes: using honey instead of corn syrup, I used 3 T. less butter. I lined a 12" by 15" jelly roll pan with parchment paper, overlapping an inch at the ends, spraying the sides lightly with cooking spray. I cooked it to 240, not 250. I had to stir for almost 50 minutes but I didn't want to rush the sauce, if you do you can scorch it. It cooled for 90 minutes or so, I could easily lift the mixture out of the pan, placing it on a kitchen towel. Using a pizza cutter, I could cut each square to precision, end result almost looked professional. Instead of wrapping each individual piece with wax paper, I opted for layers of cut pieces in a tupperware type container, I gave these out as gifts. Much easier than wrapping and wrapping all of them (made a failed batch a few years ago, different recipe and it took forever to wrap all of them). Thank you for an awesome recipe. I will be using this one each xmas season.

Brilliant caramels.  I slightly modified by adding sea salt at same time as vanilla extract.  This will be my new base-caramel recipe going forward for my other caramel candy inclusive recipies.

This made some yummy caramel that I also used to make some turtles.  I didn't have evaporated milk, so I actually just left it out and the caramels turned out great: chewy, buttery, sweet.  I also added 1 teaspoon salt and only cooked to 240 degrees as per other reviewers.  The caramel's consistency is perfect.

The first time I made these (yesterday) I halved the recipe and ended up with a disaster. I don't know what happened, but it scorched :(.  Made it again today with the full recipe and it came out DELICIOUS.  I re-calibrated my thermometer just to be sure this time and I stood over it stirring constantly.  Took 45 minutes if not more and my arms are sore, but it was worth it.  Just an FYI, this caramel is extremely chewy, so if you're looking for something softer, this may not be it.  But the taste is fabulous. And I forgot the vanilla (oops), but still tastes wonderful. Next time I'll add the vanilla for sure.

I didn't have whole whipping cream, or corn syrup so i really questioned the turn out of this recipe.  I substituted white sugar (1cup) and (1/3) cup of water for the corn syrup.  Used 1 1/2 cups of milk with 2/3 cup of butter instead of the whole cream... I also used a non stick pot, i remember reading one of the reviews that this tends to ruin or at least diminish the outcome.  My caramels turned out amazing! Don't be scared to deviate a little, it just might work!!

This is an excellent recipe.  I do not have a thermometer, so you can test them by using a bowl of ice water.  You put a few drops of caramel in the water and when they get to the right consistency you pour them into your pan.

This recipe turned out wonderfully! I let the candy go slightly higher than 250 though and I added some vanilla salt to the candy. Once cooled for approx. 30 mins I sprinkled on some fleur de sel and pressed it gently into the candy, then cut and wrapped the peices... the other chefs in my restaurant loved them!

I made 2 mistakes in making this recipe: first, I didn't read the reviews and 2nd, I didn't follow the recipe. The author states to remove the pot from heat when the temperature reaches 250. After 25 minutes, when it seemed it was never going to budge past 227 I gave up and put it in my greased pan. Then I came and read the reviews to see if anyone had the same issue, and of course many did. I contemplated just using my caramel syrup as topping for fruit or to add to cider, whatever. Then I decided to just heat it back up, hoping it would work. Luckily, it did. After 15 minutes it hit 250 and I knew right away pouring it that it was perfect. So if you have made the mistake of pulling it off the heat before 250, try and put it back in the pot! Amazing texture and flavor, I'm never buying caramels again!

These are fantastic- I am not sure who wrote it but when you grease the pan grease it VERY lightly!  Also dont stop stirring- just keep stirring the whole time!

Simply delish!!  I used dark corn syrup and a little honey as I didn't have quite enough corn syrup.  Again, simply delish, everyone enjoyed them.  I at 300 ft elevation and cooked to 145 initially.  They were a bit soft for me, so I cooked again then next day right to 150.  Perfecto!  Also, I used parchment paper instead of greasing a pan and it worked great.  It was a little hard to get the parchment fitted to the pan I was using, but just a small problem.  I used a 5qt enamel coated cast iron pan (Le Creuset), and I don't even think I needed to stir it, but I did most of the time as I wanted to make sure it didn’t scorch.  I did leave it for 10 minutes and came back and it was fine.  I used about 1/2 heat on the largest of my gas burners.  It took about 75 minutes total to get to 150.  I want to try this recipe with some coffee flavoring added.

This is the best recipe for caramels that I have tried. It takes almost 45 min. of cooking and stirring, But it is worth the smooth creamy texture.  I used the non-stick foil paper in the bottom of the pan that I poured the caramels into. Then I lifted the caramels out after the cooled, and cut them with a Pizza Cutter.  It worked so much easier and neater.

I've made these three times now. Each time they've turned out perfectly. They are by far the best tasting caramels I've ever eaten, and they are so soft and chewy that they just melt in your mouth. I get so many compliments on them when I put them in gift baskets. You can buy packages of wax paper wrappers at the craft store to save time instead of cutting your own. These make a great addition to holiday baskets and dessert platters.

used this recipe for 6 years and I will never look for another caramel recipe. 
I cut the sugar by a half a cup and had sucess, in fact I think they tasted better with less sugar.  I have also made them using all brown sugar and no white sugar.  I use salted butter.

I give this recipe 6 stars! These caramels turned out like the ones I used to buy at the general store when I was little. I only heated the caramel to 245 degrees. PERFECT consistency. I gave these away as Christmas gifts. Thank you so much for sharing, will make again and again!

I've been making this recipe for several years now, following the recipe to the 'T' and they are absolutely the best! Family and friends all expect their caramels for Christmas.  This year, after making my first two batches...for the first time ever...I tweeked the recipe a little- using 1 1/4 cups white sugar and 1 3/4 cups packed brown sugar - OMG they were even better!!!  Also, I remove from the heat about 248 degrees and this seems to get them to just the right chewiness. I also took someone else's advice and I line my pan with parchment paper - it's great.  Either way you make them, this is the best recipe ever!!!

This is the first time I have ever made caramels. I took the advice of one person and made the batch in a 9x13 dish because I prefer them thicker as well. I made the mistake of lining the dish with wax paper and forgot to spray with no-stick cooking spray (OOPS!) After brainstorming the best way to get the caramel unstuck from the wax paper, my idea was to grab the hair dryer! I heated as I pulled the paper, came off perfectly. I started with a slight problem cutting into pieces because my knife would stick to the caramel, but I found the "sawing" with the knife worked like a charm for me. This caramel turned out WONDERFUL!! My family and friends love this, so I am sure I will be making this recipe several more times over the next couple months with the holidays right around the corner! Thank you for sharing your recipe!!

Amazing!  These are, by far, the best caramels I've ever tasted.  They took about an hour to make but boy, were they ever worth it.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to let them cook a little longer.  My batch turned out a bit soft, even after refrigeration.  The taste is perfect, it's just a matter of how soft or hard you like your caramels.

Cooked to 245, it was perfect. I'd probably use a 9X13 pan next time, because I like my caramels cube-shaped. It took about an hour of cooking and stirring in a stainless steel pan to get to that temperature.

These turn out soft perfect every time.  (Just a note for those living in high altitudes, I live in Colorado and since boiling point is lower only need to heat it to 138 degrees.)

These are wonderful.  I first made this recipe last year for the holidays.  I usually make a bunch of candy & cookies and give an assortment away as gifts to neighbors, teachers, co-workers, etc.  They were such a big hit last year, I just made two batches this week for the gift giving this year.  Just remember to keep stirring them, especially when the mixture starts reducing and is boiling rapidly.  My first batch, I walked away for a few seconds, and it got a little scortched ... but they still taste wonderful.  I didn't make that mistake on my second batch, and they turned out "PERFECT".  Definately a thumbs up recipe!!!  :)

I just made this recipe.  This is the first time I've made candy and OMG!  This stuff is awesome.  So good!  I followed a few others' tips on cooking to 250°, using a silicone spatula and a glass pan (this stuff is sticky).  My only addition is to not wear anything sleeveless.  I got a little splatter on me and it really really burns.

Delicious!  I have made this twice now and it was perfect both times.  I did not let it cook much past the softball stage and I also poured it in a 9x13 pan.  Everyone who has had this caramel says it is the best they have ever had.  It's so buttery and soft, I use it to make turtles.  I will never look for another caramel recipe again!!!

I personally like my caramels a little softer than the recipe called for, so I cooked it just past soft ball stage (~240).  They were perfect.  I also recommend using a larger pot or one with higher sides, when cooking the sugar mixture it seems to grow with increasing heat.  I have now found my favorite recipe for caramels!

This is the only caramel recipe I make. Tips: do not make on a rainy or snowy day. 250 degrees is too high for higher altitudes. It will be hard. Plan on spending an hour in the kitchen, without interruptions. Cook it slowly, don't rush!

I have made 3 batches of this caramel in the last 2 days.  First batch I followed directions to the tee and caramel turned out like hard candy but the taste is wonderful.  Other two batches I made using the drizzle into cold water test and they turned out WONDERFUL.  Stopped cooking around 238 degrees.  Very time consuming but the outcome is worth it.

This is a great recipe.  I just tailored it to my own needs though and melted chocolate candy and made chocolate covered carmels.  I really liked it better with the chocolate on it. For some reason it was not as sweet with the chocolate as it was by itself.
Also a tip.. do not scrape out the last little bit at the bottom of the pan like I did because you'll get a hard area in your carmels on the pan.  I had to toss you a few because I could not even get a knife though it because it was so hard from the bottom of the pan at the end for some reason.
I can't wait to give these away as Christmas gifts!

Ditto on the stirring.  It seemed like it took me forever to get to 250 degrees.  But everyone else is right, this is awesome candy! I think I have decided to make this for Christmas gifts (I got last year's goodies off of allrecipes.com too).  I love that the recipe makes a big batch too.  Thanks for sharing this one, Barbara...it's definitely a keeper!

I love homemade caramels so when I found this recipe I had to give it a try.  They turned out wonderful!!  The only part that I didn't like was having to cut apart the caramels because that is so time consuming, but you have to do that with any caramel recipe.  Thanks!

Everyone who tried these thought they were better than store bought caramel.  I messed up the first batch by not letting them reach the right temperature so they did not set.  However, I put this caramel in a jar, and it makes a delicious ice cream topping!!

This caramel is amazing. Thank you For sharing this treasure. 

The recipe I wish would’ve explained a little more for us first timers making caramel, or maybe for everyone. 
1. Make a double batch (you’ll want it). With a LARGE pan! It boils popping and to get to temp. It will double. 

2. Put on high heat once the ingredients are cooked down. Otherwise you will cook for hours. Literally. And it will be hot boiling, popping, so you need to stir constantly making sure you aren’t burning and it sticking eventually. 

3. You will get to 250 degrees on high heat, even in a non stick pan. Probably about an hour. Depends on your stove I’m sure. Mine sucks. 

4. I used 2 glass 9x13 pans and one small one for double recipe, perfect thickness. 

5. I learned all of this after cooking it the first time for 3+hours. :) Then re cooking the next day for about an hour , after reading most comments and yes after Vanilla was already added. 
I was totally worried (because I freak about everything like this),  and using for gifts, that after turning out perfect. I felt I wanted to share, as I never have before but didn’t see some comments. But felt I could relieve some anxiety for someone with all the questions I still felt after some awesome feedback and great tips. 
Happy carameling:)

I made these, along with my daughter, for valentines day.  We did as others suggested and only let the temp get to 245.  We made caramel peanut clusters so we buttered a sheet pan, made little piles of peanuts and then using a measuring cup, poured little blobs of this caramel over the pile of nuts.  Once the caramel set up we dipped them in either milk chocolate, semi sweet chocolate or dark chocolate and drizzled lighter/darker chocolate over them and topped with course sea salt.  They were absolutely delicious  so we made them again.  They make wonderful gifts.  We made them in a non stick pan cooked over medium heat stirring constantly.  Yes, it takes a while to get to the correct temperature but they're worth it.  We also made some caramels alone and dipped them and salted them and yum!  I will definitely be making these again.  Now I have to go for a run to burn all the calories from eating these lovely treats.

UPDATE:
I use a silicone mold (either mini muffins or heart shapes), put the nuts in and then drop the caramel over it.  I pop them out once set and dip them in chocolate and sprinkle with course sea salt.  They come out amazing and everyone loves them.  I've used peanuts and cashews but you can use whatever nut you prefer.

Excellent recipe,  These are just yummy.  Just like a potato chip, you can't eat just one. Simple to prepare - just time consuming wrapping them in waxed paper.  But it's all worth it. Yummy yummy, thank you Barbara

Made just as it called for. Really tasty but it took a hour just to get it up to temp. After I let it cool it never really firmed up like it should have, it wasnt soupy but too soft to do much with. I think Ill keep looking for another recipe thats a bit faster- and maybe get a new theromometer!

I made this recipe and it turned out perfectly delicious and sticky. I added pecans as a personal taste. After a few days left covered at room temperature they lost their gooey texture and the closest word I can find to explain it is gritty, it doesn't pull like caramel and it almost just breaks where bitten. What happened?

I tried this recipe as part of my holiday baking this year and it has gotten rave reviews from all who have received it. 
I sprinkled pink sea salt on the caramel after spreading it into the pan. It gives it a little bit of a salty hit with the sweet, which was also well received. Make sure to let the caramel cool for a few minutes in the pan before adding the sea salt.

This was an easy recipe to follow (I followed it exactly)...it set perfectly and the candy was a nice consistency and just the right softness.  I don't use a candy thermometer, I use an infrared thermometer that you just point at the surface of the candy and cooked it to exactly 250. (I have checked this method with a candy thermometer and its always matched right up... and so less messy)

My issue with this recipe it the taste.  I thought it was a little too sweet and not at all buttery like I like my caramel.  I can only assume the problem is using the evaporated milk, all of the recipes I've used prior called for all heavy cream,  I will go back to that type of caramel.

Mmmm, these turned out so good!  I had made another Caramel candy which turned out perfectly smooth, but kind of boring in flavor, and I wanted to try something new.  I love the brown sugar flavor in these.  I did read at David Lebovitz's blog that brown sugar (b/c of the moisture, I think) can cause the texture to suffer in caramels, but I am either not observant enough or I didn't care.  These had the richer, deeper flavor that I was after.  I cooked them to 244 degrees per reviewers recommendations, and they are soft and chewy the next day.  This will be my go to caramel recipe now.  Highly recommended!

Fear caramels no more!!  I love making candy, but quite honestly, have always feared making caramels a bit.  No more!!  This was very easy to follow.  And delicious!!  They are perfect.  And very easy to adjust for how hard you like your caramel.  I like mine relatively soft, so I take it off the heat the moment it hits around 248, and it's perfect.  Soft, but still has some resistance and holds its shape.  I now will make these every year at Christmas for all of those "extra" gifts..coworkers-teachers-neighbors-etc.

This recipe was easy initially with popping almost all ingredients into one pan & heating until 248F.  When I poured the caramel into the pan, it was super sticky. It never seemed to firm up well.

My son wanted to make caramels. This was fairly labor intensive, but holy moses they are GOOD. We topped them with some large flakes of sea salt. Hubby took some to work and they were a huge hit.

The recipe make fabulous caramel, BUT.... The actual recipe instructions are so vague that it takes some serious trial and error to get it to work correctly! When cooking my caramel, it did reach 250 degrees... TWICE. As I had to REcook my caramel twice. But in order to get it to become caramel to cut into bite sized pieces instead of a dipping sauce, I had to NOT look at temperature. Rather, I had to cook in a large pan (wide, not tall) and cook until it became thick, darker, and almost stringy.... Actually, just before 'stringy'. Only then did it turn out correctly! And my altitude had nothing to do with it not getting hot enough or anything, as I am only about 150'. Now the page I printed this on has a million recipe notes scribbled on it so that I don not go through the mess again. In the end, it tastes great and everyone loves it.

Talk about a forgiving recipe. My first batch was perfect. Brought the temp up to about 245, put in the fridge to set and wrapped pieces in parchment paper for neighbor gifts. The second batch didn't set up, too gooey, so took one of the suggestions and put it back in the pan, cooked it again, but too much--my thermometer fell into the mixture, so used the soft ball test, but not very good at gauging the soft ball stage and it cooked too long and it set up way too hard. So tried another suggestion and heated it very slowly in the microwave until just soft, poured it back in the pan with a quarter cup of half and half, stirred it well until the caramel mixture had melted and incorporated the cream, poured back into the parchment lined baking dish and the final result is perfect. Figured a last resort was caramel sauce, but since I had quite a few pecans in the candy, I preferred to have the caramels. Have rarely had success with candy, so was very pleased with the end result.

Great taste but more like Werthers than a caramel.  Next time will lower the 250 degrees to around 244 to make them a little softer.

Wow! These are so delicious! I made them for Thanksgiving and everyone who tried them had to have another and another... The only thing that I did to change the recipe was that I sprinkled sea salt over the top as soon as I poured them onto the jelly roll pan. They didn't cool as quickly as I had assumed they might, but I just left them to cool overnight and they were good to go the next morning. I am going to try to find the candy wrapping papers online. Anyway, be prepared to stir for close to an hour, but according to my entire family, they were worth the wait! Great recipe; thanks for sharing!

this was the first time i have ever made caramel/toffee.... it didnt harden. but that was my fault because we did not have a candy thermometer. i was thinking that i could just wait until the hard ball stage. i cooked it for approx. an hour and it was pretty thick and we poured it on the pan to cool, but it never hardened, and it has the consistency of peanut butter. but its still so delicious so im going to use it as a spread to put on toast or ice cream! we put it in a huge jar and we had to take out 2 spoonfuls because we made so much! anyways, if you want to try something new, do what i did, its completely delicious!

People can call me crazy but I love  the plain old caramels way more than the different recipes with a twist that just seems to make it worst but I do absolutely love the chocolate covered ones. I'm the one that you would call the crazy chocolate lady.

This is the recipe I use every year for my Christmas caramels and now I have tons of requests for them every year. The big thing with this one is use a large sauce pot, the ingredients “grow” as they boil and if you don’t use a large pot you’ll have a HUGE mess. Also, just a note, the temp stays at about 225 for quite a while then jumps quickly to 250. You HAVE to stir constantly and watch it close or it will end up too soft or too hard.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and even made sure I had it on medium low the whole time to make sure it didn't burn. 2 hours later and it still wasn't at 250 degrees. Assuming this was due to having it at such a low heat I turned it up and it burned. The horrible thing? Even though it was burning it STILL wasn't at 250 degrees! I don't know what I did wrong but this was a horrible waste of money and time.

I loved this recipe!!! This was the first time I had tried to make caramels, and after reading other reviews I learned a few things. First; At a higher elevation, the mixture will get to the hardball stage at a lower temp. and it will take longer to cook. Second; While a candy thermometer is always a good tool, the best way to test your candy is the cold water method. (especially if your at a higher elevation and will set before 250 degrees. I'm at 3565 elevation) Third; Doubling the recipe will make it take twice as long, but with mine, it took three times as long. After talking to my candy making veteran friends, I learned that the weather outside has a LOT to do with candy making. If it's very humid/rainy outside, your candy will not turn out as best as it could.
After I poured my caramels into my pan, I sprinkled hemalayan pink salt on top, then cut them into bite sizes and dipped in chocolate. They were so good and creamy, I could have boxed them up and attached a hefty price tag, and people would have gladly paid it:)

This is an easy, good method. I think 250º is too high, though. I stopped around 245º. The ice water test works best. Soft to Firm ball stage is good for soft, melt in your mouth caramels. Also, I tried some other flavor extracts; peppermint, orange, maple and anise. Just use smaller cooling dishes and mix the caramel and extract in a small bowl to keep separate. My 2 quart pan tried to boil over several times, so I recommend a larger pot or smaller ingredient quantities. This was my first try at candy making and it worked great.

Following the feedback from other people, we cooked this until it reached 240F (soft ball state) on low, and it worked out great! My brothers enjoyed scraping the pan w/apples before the candy was done setting.

Very good!  Made a large batch for Thanksgiving last year and it was a huge hit.  Only advice I have is expect it to take a while, once you hit 212 the heating takes a long time (~90 min) since you have to heat it slowly.  Besides that, I added Kosher salt to the top of the poured caramel as a finish - They were GREAT!

I only gave this 4 stars due to its technical difficulty.  Caramel is hard to make!  I made a batch of this for a fried who loves caramels.  Nothing you buy in the store compares to them; they were so creamy and smooth and super delicious - melt in your mouth.  One batch made a LOT of 1x1 caramels.  I, like many others, did not cook it quite long enough, so they were a bit soft.  We had to keep them in the fridge, but they were delicious.  I put them in my morning coffee...yum.

These were delicious, but VERY time consuming to make.  I recommend having a second person available to help you stir--my arm got tired.

I am sure it is mentioned somewhere, but watch how long you leave them to harden before you cut them up.  I waited too long and it was difficult and time consuming to cut them up.

Hummmm....while the taste is excellent, these caramels never set up! I have an induction cooktop and it hit 250F - soft ball stage -- so I am disappointed. I will use the 'sauce' for topping vanilla ice cream!

Delicious, soft and chewy even a week later! Followed instructions exactly for the caramel.  Put in tons of pecans into half of the caramel right after pouring it into a parchment-lined 9x13 pan.  Dipped some of it in chocolate for gifts, but everybody liked the pecan or plain caramel without chocolate better! So good.

This is the ONLY recipe I will ever use again.  I followed it to the "gnat's eyebrow" (except I used parchment paper....so maybe the gnat's forehead) and it is PERFECTION!!!!!!!!!  After 2 failed attempts at caramel from other recipes, I found this one and it is fantastic!  1. MUST have a candy thermometer that is calibrated correctly! 2. Use parchment paper.  3. Give these away as gifts because YOU CANNOT STOP EATING THEM!!  Barbara, thank you, thank you, thank you!!  I needed to make caramel for a fundraiser and you saved me from disaster :)

I think this is a good recipe overall. I just made this today. I love caramel and this was my first time making my own. I think that I am really use to the commercial type of caramel. This was too buttery tasting for me. I am going to try this again because the consistancy is outstanding. I will us less butter and see what happens. I thank you for sharing this.

I made these caramels over a month ago.  We still have over half the pan left in the fridge.  We are saving them to use for the holidays. They keep extremely well!  
I used this caramel to make the Amish Caramel Corn on this site.  I melted this caramel and drizzled it on the warm popcorn and baked it.  Spectacular! Really amazing!  
I am planning on putting these into some thumbprint cookies, more caramel corn and also making our own pecan rolls/logs!  
This is the best recipe!  I love this caramel!  You can use it in coffee, too!

hands down the best caramels I have ever had.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Just be sure to have a candy theremometer and stop at the hard ball stage.  I personally think it is better to undercook this than let it all burn

For my first time making caramel, these tasted great! Like another reviewer said, definitely use a larger pot as it will bubble and almost double in size. These were creamy, and chewy. It did take about 40min to reach the right temp. I would give it 5 stars, but my caramels turned out very oily on the outside. Not sure if it's the recipe or my inexperience since it is my first time making this. Will try it again with less butter next time and we'll see.

I took the advise of foxart58 and halved the recipe to test my ability. I used a enamel cast iron 2 Qt (Martha's). It took 1hr 5mins to reach 250 on med to med/high stirring the entire time. I think next time I will not stir constantly but often to lower the amount of cooking time. foxart58 recommended a 8x8 which I used. I sprinkled a bit of course kosher salt on the top immediately after pouring in the pan. Some of the bits I rolled in seasalt before wrapping as my DIL loves salted caramel. Turned out perfect, I will continue to make in half batches unless I need a huge amount.

This recipe is beautiful!  I used an enamelized cast iron pot. I did use the candy thermometer though, its not my preferred method (I like the dripping candy into cold water). This caramel however, told me when it was done, it was thick and bubbly. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was perfect. If you are not getting thick solid but pliable caramel from this recipe, you are not cooking it long enough, its no fault of the recipe. Patience, time and lots of stirring is the key when making candy. Its delicious! I saw another review where half the corn syrup was replaced with honey so that will be my next batch. Thanks Barbara!

Great flavor, but temp is too high.  Ruined 2 batches cooking first to 250 then 245 - still too hard for anyone with dental work...  Willing to try again but will stop at 240 next time (thermometer tested a few degrees cool).  Also left out 2 tbls of butter which seems fine.

Wonderful, wonderful recipe!  I've made it a couple of times and I will make it over and over again, they get rave reviews!  My friends often just mention off hand how great these caramels were.  A couple suggestions:  Don't go all the way to 250 -, it makes them a little too hard (though they soften up in a few days and are better).  They turned out best when I went to about 247.  Also, to prevent sticking, line your pan with foil and butter the foil - this has worked best for me.  Also be prepared for some hard work in cutting them!  It takes a bit of effort!

I made this recipe with just one small change: I added 1/3c honey. It did take a long time to get to the firm ball stage, but I finally discovered that with my stove on low it never could get there. I had to up the stove to almost medium, watching carefully. I did not find this recipe to be creamy/milky enough so I decided to try another recipe using just sugar and sweetened condensed milk. I like the taste of that one much better! So, I decided to combine and remelt the two mixtures together - this turned into disaster, as some crystals formed on the side of the pan and I ended up with a huge pan of ruined, sandy caramels. With this recipe alone, crystals never formed. Finally, I was able to salvage the ruined batch by slowly re-melting all of it into a pot with just a little hot water. This took A LONG TIME, to add little pieces a few at a time and whisk until dissolved. Then, I boiled it and brought it back to the firm ball stage. The finished product is delicious. If you like a milkier caramel I would suggest simply adding a can of sweetened condensed milk to this recipe. That is what I will do next time.

Great Recipe! I use all brown sugar and maple/agave/brown rice syrup or honey depening on other things I might be adding, like spices/etc. Sometimes I use some bacon grease along with butter, adds a nice flavor.  The basic recipe is great though! Ice water or a digital thermometer to tell when done. I have made wonderful toffe using this recipe because the glass ones are hard to read, oops.

Very nice texture and rich buttery, toffee-like caramel flavor.  I needed to cover 26 large apples, so I doubled the recipe.  I used my spaghetti pot to give it plenty of room to boil up and my digital probe thermometer to get it just up to 250.  Let the mixture cool a bit, as recommended and then started dipping apples and let the apples cool on silpat and teflon sheets, so they would not stick.  I had enough caramel from the double batch to cover all the apples with a bit to spare.  At the end, the caramel began to cool, so I reheated it to make it thin enough to coat the apples.  The butter did separate at that point, so it would not stick to the apples, even after stirring really well.  Since I had 3 apples left, I poured the remaining caramel onto a silpat to make a sheet.  After it set up, I wiped off the excess butter, cut the caramel sheet into strips and wrapped it around the remaining apples.  The last little bit I just formed into cubes and left to cool before covering them with chocolate.  I'll be doing the "gourmet" thing with the apples, adding chocolate and other goodies - for a bake sale.  Thanks Barbara for a very good recipe.

I loved it!  The first time I tried to make these caramels I didn't use a candy thermometer and ended up with some very delicious caramel sauce.  The second time I wisely used a candy thermometer.  I listed to other reviews and only cooked until about 242 degrees.  Turned out perfect!

These came out perfect!  It was my first try and they were very easy to make.  The "hardest" part is the constant stirring so the carmel doesn't burn.  I will definetely make these again. (Why wait until the holidays?)

I have made these 2 years in a row and they have not turned out.  They must be cooked at a certain temp for a long period of time....you must have patience.

Mmmm... so good and so easy!! Maybe I just have bad luck finding a good thermometer, but I always use the cold water test. When I drop the mixture in cold cold water (mixture was actually quite thick), it hardened. Delicious taste! I cut the recipe in half and instead of using all corn syrup, I took the suggestion of another reviewer to use a little honey (1/4 and 1/8 c. corn syrup and 1/8 c. honey). Yum, thanks!

We really enjoyed the caramels.  I cut the recipe in half and we had plenty to eat and give away.  When we gave them away everyone asked for the recipe.  Be a little patient with it to get to the right temp.

This recipe turned out disasterous for me.  I made a double batch, so I had three pots going (with the help of my mother).  By the time our first pot got to 250 (after about 40 mins of cooking), it was a totally burned mess that was inedible.  The second pot seemed to get close to 250 and be of the right color, but was too hard to eat.  And we just undercooked the third pot, which then turned out too soft.  Really not sure what we did wrong, since we are both experienced cooks...

Wow! Soooo good!  This is my first attempt at caramel, so I followed others advice and calibrated my thermometer.  It was way off!  I basically used it as a general guide and kept doing the water test until it was the consistency I liked.  I boiled it roughly 20-25 minutes.  Well worth the time.  I can't wait to share (what's left of) these with my family for Christmas!

I am a HUGE caramel fan!!  This is the best caramel ever!  I will not ever buy them at the store again!  You really have to be patient with candy, but with this recipe it pays off!  You will not be disappointed!****I know use this caramel to dip oreos into, once the caramel firms up, I dip them in chocolate.  They are divine!  These are requested by EVERYONE at every holiday.  This is one of my most used recipes from this sitr.

I made these over the holidays, and they were a huge hit!! I wrapped some in candy wrappers, and some I dipped in melted chocolate, drizzled with white chocolate. When I took them to the parties, people thought I bought them! It's my first time making caramel, but it sure won't be the last. Thank you very much.

This was an excellent recipe. I agree with a previous poster this does taste like Leatherby's caramels. I have tried many recipes and this one is definitely a keeper. The only thing I changed was the temperature. I cooked to 235. That was the perfect temp for us. They held their shape but were still soft and chewy. I got many requests for these. Thanks for the recipe

This recipe is sooooo awesome.  It is a clone (tastes exactly the same) as Leatherby's ice creamery near my house.  I did not cook them so that they were hard caramels, as I was looking to make a caramel ice cream sauce.  I have found the perfect caramel recipe.  It does take a bit of time to get them to 250 (It took me over 1/2 hour just to get it to reduce to make a sauce), but it's worth the time.  Also, I used a 3 qt saucepan, which was just big enough.  I, like others, recommend using a large saucepan.

I've been making this recipe for 2 years now, and it's a hit with everyone who tries it! Even my seasoned pastry chef instructors wanted the recipe! This one is so much more rich and buttery than the average caramel recipe. In fact, I occassionally cut back the butter by as much as 1/4 c. to keep the butter from weeping. Always irresistable. I like to undercook this to use as a sauce or a filling, too.

This is the first time I made caramels and everyone loves them! I cooked them to about 235F, and they're a tiny bit too soft, so next time I'll go to 240F or so.  I also divided the batch in two, added lemon extract and some lemon juice (about 1 tsp each) to make lemon caramels!  Yum! Add a little chocolate drizzle and I've found what I'm giving away for Christmas.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Thank you so much for this recipe.  My grandmother made a delicious batch of caramels every Christmas for my dad.  After she died, I could not find her recipe and started trying out different recipes each year.  I made this one last year and my dad lit right up.  They aren't the same as Grandma's, but they are every bit as delicious.  I will be making these every year now and will be sure to hand the recipe down.  Thanks again, Barbara.

This took f-o-r-e-v-e-r to get to the 250 stage. And cutting them was hard too, then wrapping all those pieces individually. You definetly should have some help with at least the wrapping. They have a very nice flavor.

I've never made candy before and wanted to try caramels just for fun. Man, I'm glad I tried this! I made these, the first batch came out perfect. Sent them to work with my husband and got a phone call later that day asking me to make more! The second batch was a little bit too gooey, but still yummy! YAY! I will be making these a lot, I'm sure.

Delicious!  It took a while to make but it was sure worth it.  At first I thought it was going to be too sweet, but it was just right.  Only complaint I have is that the caramel was really buttery and it made your hands greasy so you have to wash them often while shaping them.  I'm a tenn if I can do this you can to.

This is an excellent recipe but you must be willing to stay the course with it on the stove.  These are the best I have ever eaten!  Mine turned out semi soft and I wrapped them in long pieces in waxed paper.  Then I twisted the ends of the paper.  You will absolutely LOVE the flavor!

Excellent recipe - mine are the perfect consistency, not gooey, not hard. It takes a long time to reach 250 degrees though, which I did not expect, having had little experience making candy. It hangs at about 212 for a long time and then starts moving again, then hangs at 225 for another while. I think that total cooking time was about an hour.

The taste is wonderful!  However, I must have done something wrong.  It took an hour to get to the suggested temp.  Also, I brought it to suggested 250 degrees (hard ball stage) and it turned into a hard candy, like a sucker.  I like soft caramels so next time I make it I'll take it to 225 degrees.  The flavor is worth trying it again.  Great gift for Christmas baskets for neighbors.

This is my go to recipe for caramels! 
I prefer to not use corn syrup and use honey instead, same ratio. I also switched out the white sugar and regular brown sugar for Demera sugar. These are the best tasting and family and friends all love them and request them on holidays.
If you want to go all out you can make your own homemade turtles by putting down pecans, or your choice of nut, spoon caramel over them and after they cool a little spoon melted chocolate on top to cover them pop them in the fridge to cool. 
Also never use wax paper as it will stick and leave a mess, use parchment paper.

An acquaintance of mine makes great caramels but always stressed to me how incredibly difficult and time-consuming it was and how I shouldn't even try because I lacked her experience. Well, pfffft to her. I made these caramels last night, and they are every bit as good as hers. What I changed: I used a 9 X 13 pan so the caramels would be a bit thicker. I buttered the pan sides but put parchment paper on the bottom, with "handles" overhanging the edges. I sprinkled the parchment with sea salt, then when I poured the caramel in, I again sprinkled it with sea salt. What I will do differently next time: I cooked the sugar mixture over medium heat, and it took 1 hour 32 minutes to reach 248 degrees. Since I stirred it constantly, next time I'll increase to medium high heat at least for a while. Also, I plan to swap some of the brown sugar for more white. The final product has a tiny bit more molasses-y taste than I would prefer. I will also buy wrappers online, as it took me as long to cut the waxed paper and wrap the candies as it did to make them. And next time I see my acquaintance, I'm going to tell about the fabulous recipe I found for the very best caramels ever!

Delicious and easy! I have an electric stove that does not get very hot. The heat goes all the way up to 11. I started at 3, about thirty minutes in switched up to 6, another thirty minutes switched to 8, and to get it to that final temperature push put it to 10, the thermometer finally read 255 after about an hour and a half to two hours of stirring. It was well worth it. 

*Use parchment paper to pour the hot Carmel onto. This saves a tremendous amount of time with cleanup.
*Use wax paper to wrap them up individually. The parchment paper doesn't roll up as well as the wax.

The whole thing took about 5 hours, but I did it all at once (cooking, cooling, cutting, wrapping). This yielded about 250-400 Tootsie roll sized caramels. Everybody I have given them to love them. Perfect for caramel apples too!

I’ve been making this recipe for 10 years!!!! Play with your temperature to get the soft/hardness u prefer. I invested in silicon molds for ease of individual pieces and wrap in cellophane ????. Enjoy and share them. People ask for them and smile. Add a nut too. Dip in chocolate. Sprinkle sea salt.

have made caramel with no problem in the past. I had packed up all my cookbooks as we will  be moving soon. A friend loves caramel so decided to look up another recipe. I even put this back and recooked. Thickened a little but no way can cut and wrap to give. on a strict budget so do not have the luxury of trying another recipe. will never make this one again

I have made these twice now, the second time being a double batch as they were just devoured by my guests! Expect the cooking time to be about 45 minutes and use your instinct, if they aren't a golden brown caramel colour and haven't thickened substantially, they probably aren't done yet!  I haven't been able to get my candy thermometer past 230-235 but I still haev had great results. I sliced them up then drizzled with sea salt and dark chocolate. One of the batches I have cooling right now has 2 tsp of bourbon added, didn't seem to affect it setting so hoping they turn out! Will be making and playing with this recipe for years to come!

A lot of stirring and time is needed but, the results are fantastic. I used salted butter and added 1/8tsp of salt but, I do think it needed more. I stopped right at 240 and got the chew I was hoping for. I added toasted walnuts and later drizzled a little bit of chocolate. I got 100 pieces of various sizes that  I wrapped in wax paper pieces. That was the most time consuming of it all. Definitely making this recipe this holiday . Yum!

I don't know if it was just bad luck but my caramel did not settle. I used a candy thermometer and tried to keep it at a constant heat but it was getting out of hand. Also, for anybody who would make this, double the vanilla as I did and it brought out the flavor. Sue would probably make a better batch than me.

Just made it - took approx. 45 minutes over med-high heat, stirred constantly; used a non-stick pan and lined a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Kitchen shears to cut into pieces.

I make these caramels every year around Christmas. I've never had any bad batches, and the recipe is amazing. I do sometimes sprinkle the cooling caramel with sea salt or kosher salt which greatly enhances the flavor. I have learned a couple tricks though through the years. 1). If using a candy thermometer make sure it's a good one and calibrated. I finally threw out my old one as it got in the way while stirring and the temperature was not nearly as accurate as a cold water test. I just do cold water tests now until soft ball stage. 2). It can take close to an hour of stirring to get to the proper texture. 3). Use a large pot and rest a wooden spoon on top so the mixture doesn't boil over. 4). No need to grease a pan. Just line your dish with a large piece of parchment paper. Pour hot caramel directly onto parchment. Once chilled you can pull all the caramel out of the pan in one large piece for ease of cutting. The caramel will not stick to the parchment. 5) I let caramel chill in the fridge for several hours. After completely cooled, remove caramel from dish and place on large cutting board or cutting surface. Use a metal pizza cutter to cut in to strips and then small pieces. This is SO much easier than cutting in the dish or with a knife. Wrap individual pieces in wax paper and enjoy. Clean up is a breeze and you now have perfect caramels.

I don't think it affected the outcome but I did forget to add the vanilla right at the end.  In my opinion either 250 degrees is too high to cook to or my thermometer is off.  once my candy cooled it was too hard.  Almost more like toffee rather than caramel.  it did soften as you chew but I think next time I am going to stop heating around 245 and see how that works.  The flavor however is outstanding even without the vanilla.  I will definitely always use this recipe with maybe just a little tweaking.    I saw one comment that did say they were unsure how how to set their burner on their stove.  I used an electric stove and kept the heat just below medium once it started to boil and stirred it frequently.    Seemed to work good.

First time making candy and theses are perfect! ThAnk you so much Barbara for sharing your recipe. I did read reviews and I agree use a large pot. I used an 8 qt stock pot which is plenty and large enough for a double batch. We live in San Diego,so I kept temperature at 250. I was cooking dinner while making this so I was close to the pot for the entire hour. Somehow I forgot to add evaporated milk. So I put pot back on the stove,and it came out perfect. Recipe is very forgiving. I sprinkled coarse salt lightly on top of entire batch and pecans on one half. Popped in frig for 10 mins and used pizza cutter and wrapped in wax paper. Depending on your size of pieces you can yield 60+ pieces.

I agree with the person who said theirs tasted like a buttery store candy. While that's not a bad thing...that's not what I was looking for. This won't go to waste, because I will thin and make dessert sauce with it or something. Just wanted more of a caramel taste and not so much butter.

Didn't work for me. Turned out grainy. I've made candy before. I used a candy thermometer and didn't use too high heat. I live at only 6 ft above sea level. After reading other caramel recipes, I think it has to do with when the cream and butter is added and the stirring technique. I will use another recipe next time and not stir it constantly.

This recipe completely failed on me. I've been making candies since I was 6 and I followed the recipe precisely and cooked it on low to make sure that it wouldn't burn. When it reached 250 F I took it off, added the vanilla and let it cool. The fact that it didn't solidify didn't bother me (I can fix that), but it tasted terrible. I could have made a caramel like that by boiling a can of Condensed milk.... I wouldn't recommend this. It isn't worth the pint of Heavy Whipping Cream...

Best caramels ever!!!   I have made this recipe for a few years now.  Thanks Barbara!  Yes I've had a few sacrifices to caramel gods but that goes with lots of recipes.  Everyone's stoves are different and so are their thermometers. Even if you go old school the candy is different on different days.  Any experienced cook knows the weather and temp of your house can affect things.   Main thing to remember is to stir!!  While you don't have to stir it constantly you do need to do it very often.  On my stove. Slightly higher than medium is best.  It gets to 220 very quickly but the last 30 degrees takes forever.  I just grab a stool and stick close. That's when it needs the most attention.    I've tried to say. It's good enough but if you don't cook it to just the right temp for the right amount of time you will have very soft caramels.     I use a jelly roll pan.  And I make one and a half of the recipe.   It turns out great.  If you do pour it on top of wax paper you still need to lightly spray it. At least I should have.  Spent forever peeling it off and wasted precious caramel. They are better the next day when they have set.   Still the best recipe I've ever found!! Good luck!

I tried a 'fancy' no-stir recipe first, but it came out with big dark chunks...even though I hadn't stirred. So I decided to try this one, which seemed much easier. I was very careful to not scrape the bottom or sides while I was stirring, as I didn't want those big chunks again. Didn't seem to matter… Got the big chunks anyway. And after 60 minutes I finally gave up and poured it into the pan.
I kept the heat between medium and medium high but was unable to ever reach the 250° mark. They are a pretty color, except for all the freckled black spots from the bottom of the pan.
I think I'm done with caramels…

Caramel turns a dark golden brown and gets thick towards the end.  Used the cold water test.  Keep a close eye on it towards the end cos temp climbs fast three for maybe turn it down a bit towards the end.

Put it on nonstick foil.  Use 10.25 x 15.25 pan

Great, turns out every time but make sure you calibrate your digital thermometer.  I remove mine from the heat at 247 degrees at 500 pressure altitude.  I am so close to sea level that I do not have to compensate for altitude.  This recipe also works well for turtles.

CAUTION! These caramels are extremely addictive.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect.  I did deviate from the instructions by using parchment to line the pan.  I did spray the parchment with oil.  Next time I will use the parchment but will not spray it.  It made the caramels a bit oily.  I tried cutting the caramels with the pizza cutter but ended up using the kitchen shears.  The pizza cutter may have worked if I had tried cutting them before the caramel was completely cooled.  Will try again.  Also, I found that the size of the caramels was a bit large, so I cut them in half, netting twice the number of pieces.

DENTURE WEARERS DELIGHT!  Fear not, denture wearers.  Although these caramels will stick to the teeth or dentures, the solution is simple.  Remove your dentures and enjoy the soft caramel as it massages your gums.  They are a perfect consistency for gumming!  Enjoy

I love caramel- this is the first recipe that I had success. I made this caramels and then used them to make turtles. Everyone loved them. It does take quite some time to make and you can not rush it. But I will these again.

This is so good and so easy! You do want to use a large pot though. I watched the color as I cooked it and when it was the color I thought was right, it was done. The caramels came out perfectly and everyone loved them.

I just used this recipe and it came out awesome!  I didn't have a thermometer so I just cooked it until I got around the consistency I wanted and did the water test (drizzled a little into cold water).  It came out great!  Very popular!  I doubt there is going to be any left for myself...

I didn't have heavy cream or evaporated milk so I used sweetened condensed milk (1 can) and 2%milk instead and it came out great, the only thing I did wrong was heated too quickly and scorched the milk a bit....I would recommend 6-7max for your burner temp, and stir frequently after the caramel expands (and use a large pot!). I lined my pan with wax paper and I also sprinkled course sea salt on top after poring the caramel, and it's sooooo yummy!

I love these! They are easy to make but be patient, it takes a long time to reach 250 degrees F, but it is worth the wait. I greese a jelly roll pan and poor it in, spreading to make it even. Let it cool for a while and score it with a knife then I use kitchen shears to cut them, let them finish setting and wrap in wax paper. These are always a hit. I add walnuts and a little salt to enhance the flavor.

This was my first time ever making caramels. I had no trouble at all with them, I won't go as far as to say they are easy but definitely not difficult at all. The most tedious part of the whole ordeal was wrapping each individual piece with wax paper, you don't realize how much the recipe makes until you have to wrap them all. Absolutely will make these again, thanks so much for the recipe!

This was my first attempt at caramels and I have to say they turned out fantastic. I followed the directions to a T, something I don't normally do, and i'm so glad I did. It took about 45 minutes of constant stirring on medium heat, and like someone else said they increased in size. Luckily I had another pot on hand and for about 10 minutes I had two pots of carmel on the stove. I was able to mix them back together at the end and all was well. It seemed to take forever for them to get up near 250 and then suddenly the thermometer went over and I pulled them off the stove pretty quickly. I was afaid they'd be too hard but they were great. One reviewer mentioned to pay attention, make sure the dog's not underfoot, which made me laugh. However I took that advice ... you do not want to spill hot caramel on the stove, the dog, yourself or anything else. Disaster was averted by patience and attention. I think that's the key. Thanks for sharing this great recipe and to everyone who gave helpful hints.

Great tasting caramel! I cooked until temp about 245 instead of 250 because some people theirs was too hard at 250. Next time I will cook until temp 250. Mine were a little too soft. It didn't effect the flavor they were wonderful. Great for gifts!

Thank you, Barbara, for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I am not a candy-maker but just couldn't resist trying my hand today at one of my most favorite treats.  Thank you, reviewers, for your helpful hints.  If it wasn't for you I really don't think my caramels would have turned out as perfect as they did.  I am so excited about this that I can't wait to do it again.  My friends and family are going to be so excited to receive this beautiful and tasty gift! :)

A few questions about this recipe- 1) what temp do you cook it at 2) do you stir it the entire time or just let it go 3) if you want to add something to it, should you do it after it is made and you are pouring it on the pan or while it is cooking?

Excellent recipe!  This was my first try at caramel.  I went with a cooking temperature of just past Medium on my cooktop.  I stirred for approximately 50 minutes when it starting browning slightly and decided to take it off at 242 degrees as I did not want to scorch it.  It came out perfect.  It set up nicely and I used a very long knife for cutting it up into smaller pieces.  I did find that cutting in small rectangles was easier to wrap as squares seemed to tear once I wrapped them with the waxpaper pieces.  Very buttery and rich and I will never buy caramel at the store anymore!

1st time making caramel and I didn't even have a candy thermometer! I have been wanting to make homemade caramel for caramel apples, but haven't found a candy thermometer in the stores. Then I read about the hard ball method (dropping drips in water). It WORKED! It did take over an hour and I did have to transfer to a larger pot because it nearly doubles during boiling, but I stirred and waited and sure enough... YUMMY caramel! My slight alterations: Added a pinch of sea salt at the end and with the leftovers after the caramel apples, I put peanuts and chocolate on the cookie sheet and covered with caramel. 
(Tried to post a picture but couldn't make the file size small enough for site or sight).

This is a terrific recipe!  I was simply looking to get rid of some leftover heavy cream and only had a 1/2 pint.  So I cut the recipe in half... worked like a dream.  I cooked it to about 245 degrees and did as someone else suggested by cranking up the heat a bit at about 225 degrees.  I also used the water test to make double sure I was at the hardball stage.  It took about 30 minutes from the moment it started to boil.  I also sprinkled the pan with coarse sea salt after I poured in the hot caramel.  Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  I'm only sorry I had to half the recipe and wish I could have doubled it instead.

Very easy recipe, even though it was my first time making candy. My only complaint is that the finished product is rather oily. Some tips for first-timers like myself: an 8-quart pot is too big. Your candy thermometer will not be submerged enough and will not register the temperature properly, and you will have to use the cold water test to tell when you're done. Also, parchment paper is apparently not the same thing as waxed paper. We ended up having to cut the caramel off the waxed paper we used to line the pan. But it tastes great!

I completely enjoyed this recipe!  I read all the reviews first and got quite a few tips before getting started.  Thank you to all that assisted me.  The only variation I made was the evaporated milk.  I poured the milk and cooked it on medium heat to evaporate some of the water from it.  It worked!  I only boiled it for a few minutes and I cooked it on medium heat because I did not want to scorch it.  I also lined the pan with peanuts and covered one half with milk chocolate.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter.  My grandson has been writing songs about chocolate and singing for the past hour!  My mother, 89 years young, is extremely happy.  Thank you for this recipe!  --Choyce7

Excellent recipe that turned out wonderful.  I did have trouble getting it up to temperature, but I live at a very high altitude.  With that exception, it turned out very well.  Advice:  Use a very deep pan, this stuff more than doubles in volume as it cooks.  Use a liberal amount of Pam on the pan you are using.  Stir, stir, and stir so this doesn't scorch.  I used some of this recipe to dip pretzel rods and it was amazing.  Wonderful flavor, but remember that it takes some time to make.  Not for the faint of heart!

TASTE:  just awesome!  The flavor is amazing.  My husband helped me put all the ingredients together, and he was groaning how it looked at first.  Never judge 'til you're done! They're delish!
DIRECTIONS: could use some work.  I've never made caramels (successfully) before. I wasn't sure how hot to cook it, how long to look it, etc. I did read some of the other reviews, and it seemed like low and slow, so I did.  It set a touch harder than I like, so I think next time I'll stick with 5 degrees cooler.
PAN: I used a big pan and mine came out pretty thin. I'm going to go with a 10x13 cake pan next time so I get them thicker.

I made this caramel exactly as it is written and nailed it on the first try!!  I've done a little bit of candy making before, but wasn't very successful.  I took the advice of other reviewers and checked my candy thermometer, but in the end I think it wasn't working and used the cold water method to check its readiness.  I used the caramel to make home made turtles and they were amazing!!  With the extra, I put peanut halves in the bottom of a cake pan and poured the caramel on top, a little more than covering the nuts.  I put it in the fridge for a few minutes, then pulled it out, cut it into squares, and drizzled chocolate over it.  Just like a home made snickers!!  This is a keeper for sure!

I took off one star, because my caramel didn't turn out. That is entirely my own fault. I think I used the wrong pot (used a big Dutch oven pot). At some point, the temperature plateaued at 200, and then it began to drop. It never got up to the hard ball stage, and that was after about an hour of watching this hot, scary, sugary mass boil away. I coddled it like a nuclear device, but it just didn't work out for me. I will say that the results were still tasty. They didn't firm up they way they should've, but again, that was my own fault. I'll try this again some time. Maybe with some practice, I'll get it right. But if you can get the temperature right, I'm sure you'll get some great caramel out of this recipe.

This was great!  Perfect consistency and they tasted great too!  I kept it on low heat and used a glass of ice water to test when it was ready.  It took a while- I would recommend leaving time to stand over the stove the whole time. Maybe turn on some music and pour a glass of wine!

I used this recipe for my first-ever attempt at caramels.  As long as you have a candy thermometer, wooden spoon, and patience, you really cannot mess this recipe up.  I dusted the top of them with sea salt while cooling.  Delish!  Thanks for sharing!!!

The cream is what makes this recipe foam up in the cooking if you do not have a very large pot for cooking in try adding the cream in stages as your cooking especially important if your doubling the recipe.

These are by far the BEST caramels to make. Remember to use a large pot (instead of medium).

The best caramels I've ever made, and everyone in my family loved it!  It was very easy too.  
I dipped the top of mine in melted chocolate after they cooled.

Just made my 5th batch. I took others advice and used 3/4cup butter and 1 tsp vanilla. I use a parchment line Pampered Chef large bar pan to pour the caramel on to cool. After it has cooled 15 minutes I put chocolate on top and it melts and then I spread it around. Then I lift the parchment paper out of the pan put it on the counter and cut with a pizza cutter. Also when I add the vanilla I add 1 large cup chopped toasted almonds. I used to have a large box of Milk Duds in my pantry. Never again. These only take 45 minutes to cook once they start boiling. If you use a very heavy high quality stainless steel pan you don't need to stir constantly until it gets to 225*F on your candy thermometer. I've used honey, corn syrup, regular white sugar and evaporated cane sugar as substitutes also 1/2 n 1/2 for the evaporated milk and all work. Use the drop in ice water test to see if it is chewy enough. If you have 2 candy thermometer test them in boiling water to see if they are calabrated correctly.

I love the taste of these caramels but I couldn't get them to set up. They ended up being little pools of caramel that still tasted delicious, but couldn't be given as gifts. I coated mine in tempered chocolate and sprinkled them with sea salt and they were divine, just not pretty.

I make this caramel for my friends and family all the time, but since I can no longer eat sugar, I've trusted their opinions about how wonderful it is. But this weekend when reading the comments, someone mentioned not having enough corn syrup and using honey instead. Since I can eat honey, I got really excited. So today, I made a half batch of caramel substituting honey for the corn syrup and splenda brand sugar and brown sugar. And I have to say they are FABULOUS! They taste exactly how my grandmother's used to taste when I was little! They are a bit gooey-er than the regular ones, but after twenty mins or so in the fridge they were perfect!

At first, I was disappointed because my caramel was still really runny when i took it off the stove. Then I read the reviews and cooked it until a drop of caramel put in ice water immediately hardened. I just tried some and it was delicious!

This is my first time making caramel and they came out sooo good!  I was a little scared to attempt these, especially without a candy thermometer, but after reading almost every review I decided to go for it and make a half batch (just in case).  I started the mix in my pot on low-med heat and set my timer for 45 minutes, planning on it taking longer than that.  I stirred pretty much the whole time, only letting the mix sit for no longer then about 20 seconds.  Towards the end, the caramel will be thicker in the pan.  Because I didn't have a thermometer, I used the ice water trick and it worked awesome!  Just drop a little of the caramel into a bowl of really cold water, wait a few seconds and then fish out the caramel and feel what the texture is.  I took mine off the heat when the caramel in the water felt smooth and firm, but easily pliable.  Dumped the caramel into a buttered foil lined 7 x 11 pan and let it cool before cutting.  (PS - Do not use foil!  Even buttered, I still had some sticking.  Parchment is the way to go!)  Cut the pieces with a nonstick pizza cutter, wrapped with wax paper.  There are freakishly good!!

Make these every year for five years now.  I use parchment paper that I place on a jelly roll pan, then pour the mixture.  As it is cooling, I use a plastic knife and shape the poured carmel mixture into a square or rectangle.  I use a plastic knife to cut the carmels and I call upon family members to help wrap the carmels with 5 x 5 candy wrappers from an online purchase at a candy store.  We eat them as we cut them and give away many for Christmas!

The first time I made these they turned out slightly too soft because I was afraid of burning them, however they were so amazingly yummy! Everyone I gave them to raved about the flavor. I will be making these again for Christmas gifts.

I just tried this and took a friend's advice to line the dish with wax paper. Maybe she meant parchment paper? Poured into two different dishes and tried slicing/extracting from one dish about 45 mins after finishing. The wax paper totally stuck to the caramels and that batch was ruined. I'm leaving the second dish overnight to see if that helps. If anyone knows whether I'm a total doofus for using wax paper and it would have turned out okay had I used parchment, let me know. Hoping to try these again in the coming days. Also, would a jelly-roll pan work, or should I stick to a deeper dish, like what I'd use for brownies? Thanks!! Givin a high rating because I'm excited to try this again, armed with the *correct* advice this time!!

This recipe is so easy.  And they are so good.  This was my 1st time making caramels and I will be doing it again.  I am going to start making all kinds of candy now cause this was so fun.  I took it off the heat at 240.  They are great.

I thought these caramels were ok.  If you plan to make these, definitely use a large pot as other reviews have suggested, and yes they do take a long time.  It took ~1.5 hr to get to the correct temperature on Med/Low heat.  I did not constantly stir the mixture, only stirring every few minutes worked fine and they did not burn.  I brought the caramels to 248 degrees F - my calibrated thermometer suggested stopping at 243 F.  They were really soft - almost too soft, but they taste really good. My biggest complaint was that the candy was really greasy.  I poured it into a baking sheet lined with ungreased parchment paper.  There was butter floating on top of the caramel as it cooled.  I even triple checked the amount of butter I added to the recipe - it was the correct amount.  Even with a three star rating I would try this recipe again with less butter and cooking a few more degrees.

I'd give a 4.5 if I could. I definitely recommending using parchment paper for sure when you make these. They are really delicious but a little firmer than I like so I will probably not cook quite to 120C for my next batch. But my first batch turned out great. Took about an hour of cooking time total.

I would have added more stars if I had that option . These were incredibley easy to make, it took me 50 mins at a medium low heat to reach 250. At 225 coop out about 3 soup ladles to pour onto a Lindt Chocolate cheesecake that was going into the oven for 60 mins. Some of the caramel fell onto the counter top....OMG so good. I followed the tip about the parchment paper and it is a winner. Great recipe, will be making this one from now on I have found my perfect caramel recipe :) Do try this one.

Great Recipe! I made one change because I don't like corn syrup. I substituted honey in the same amount. 
SPECTACULAR! Took them to a Christmas Party and were gone in minutes.

Made these as part of Christmas gift goodie bags. First time I ever made carmel. AWESOME! I read all of the suggestions/reviews and they came out wonderfully! Used a large, heavy pot, candy thermometer and for good measure the drop in water method! YUM

Made these last night, and was so happy with the result.  I only made half a batch to start with in case I was unsuccessful. I heated them to between the soft ball and firm ball stage on my candy thermometer, and then poured it into an 8 x 8 glass pan lined with parchment paper.  They were so yummy--the perfect consistency.  I was looking to make sea salt caramels, but liked this caramel recipe better.  Added some sea salt with the vanilla and then covered in chocolate with another sprinkle of sea salt.  Great Christmas gift for my co-workers this year!

I halved the recipe and tried various temps between soft ball and soft crack and found each were pretty darn good!  Oh, I also substituted honey for the corn syrup and that made the carmel even better!!

Use dark karo syrup to get the correct color, other than that this is the best caramel recipe I have found to date!  I even coat them with powered sugar and put them in tupperware if I get tired of wrapping each one.  Great to go in glass jars and given out as holiday treats!

I have never made Fudge/Caramel before but because I had a lot of sugar/lemon juice in a pan, for something else I wasn't going to make anymore, I was thinking what else I could do. Found this recipe and started. While working on it I had to add more of one and another because I didn't really used measurements. I placed a cup of water with ice cubes in the freezer to have real cold water for the 'hard ball' test since I don't have a sugar thermometer. It worked awesome .. I had that 'hard ball' and poured it in a baking pan .. Now .. I'm cutting my first ever homemade Fudge jippiiie ;) I added lemon juice and cinnamon in the beginning. It tastes awesome.

I can never make caramels right. It always burns and always gets too hard, even with my thermometer. The taste is delicious, hence my 3 stars. I am good at making caramel sauce, and invented my own recipe. I can make candy, just not caramel.

This is a fantastic recipe! Although I probably could have raised the heat a bit, it took me 1.5 hours of standing and stirring. I wouldn't change a thing. NOTE: Cutting the wax paper and wrapping the caramels wasn't my favorite activity. I couldn't pass this on to the boys or there wouldn't be any left for guests over the holidays. I'm going to wrap these in little boxes and have them on hand to give to drop in friends.

I'm grateful for the people who took the time to write the reviews and offer tips.  Having read them all I was mucho prepared to tackle this, my first caramel-making experience.  Though time consuming (as forewarned!), I was able to get the pot to precicely 250 degrees, poured into prepared pans (LIGHTLY greased!) and the result is absolutely perfect caramels, better than any I have ever eaten in my life.  Thank you to Barbara for the recipe, and for all those who contributed with valuable comments!

Very easy and great recipe. It worked perfectly. I tried it with coconut milk insted of evaporated milk. Make sure to stirr it all the time. It takes time but it worth it. If you don't stirr it constantly, you won't have a chewy and soft textute because of sugar cristalization. That is how some people has a hard candy caramel.

Excellent recipe; follow it to the letter and it will turn out wonderfully. It takes almost exactly 45 minutes to reach 250 degrees, so be patient.

These caramels are great! A little tricky for a candy beginner like me though. If the recipe is anything, its forgiving. I split the batch in half for my first attempt so I wouldn't waste ingredients if I failed horribly. First attempt came out too soft, and they never hardened. When it cooled I dumped it all back into the pot and brought the temperature back up, this time it was too high and I ended up with toffee (nice flavor though!). I don't know if there is something wrong with me or the thermometer, but I'll keep trying. You absolutely need to watch and stir it the whole time though. Even leaving it for a second left me with a pot to soak and scrub because of scorched caramel on the bottom. If I ever get the consistency right it will make a perfect addition to any gift bag or holiday treat platter. In the mean time my boyfriend is happy to dispose of my "failures" :)

Very good caramels! Did not reach firm ball on my thermometer so I had to do the water check way. They came out great. Hard get out of the dish even buttered. Oh and way to much butter. I must have soaked up at least 1/4c with paper towels. So I may try adding a little less & hopefully they'll still come out. I should have used my foldable silicon bakeware and poured it in that because then I could just "pop" it out in one big "brick" and then cut. So good though but this first time was a learning process as to how I can not be working with caramels for 3 hours. Very very very good!

I absolutely love this recipe! It does take a long time for the mixture to get to temperature, but the wait is well worth it. I followed the other reviewers suggestions to reduce the temperature by 1 degree for every 500 feet you are above seas level. Everyone loves "my" caramels and cannot wait for the Christmas baking extravaganza. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe with is Barbara

Delicious!!! Better than those you buy at a candy store. A made this recipe last night and I just finished cutting and wrapping them. Very easy to do, a little boring wrapping the 110 pieces that I had. I use the pizza cutter and a brownie server to cut them. I’m going to give them as Halloween treats for my coworkers to avoid eating all by myself.

I made a half batch to use up some heavy cream and evaporated milk I didn't want to waste.  The recipe doesn't specify, but you will want to use salted butter for this recipe, or add salt if you are using unsalted.  I used my regular unsalted butter, and it definitely needs salt.  This is a pretty easy and straight forward recipe; it would be good for someone making caramels for the first time.  I do agree with others that only going to 240 or 245 degrees would be better.  While they weren't bad, they just weren't nearly as good as some other recipes I have made, so I doubt I would make these again.

WOW! DELISH! Tastes like I bought it! However, I used wax paper and the paper stuck to the bottom of the caramels and won't peel off. Whoever eats these has to also eat some paper but it's that good! The first time I made it, I guess it wasn't hot enough so I put it all back in the pot and recooked it; a lot faster to do the second time around. When it was cool, it was SUPER hard to cut. I think I'll go buy some special scissors because my hands hurt real bad.

This is a fantastic caramel recipe. I make it every year for the holidays. It is a time consuming art. The recipes says to cook to 250 degrees but I cook it a little more than a soft ball stage. I sometimes add pecans and it is awesome. If made correctly this is the best. My family asks me every year to make this. I give it away as gifts for family and friends and if I happen to miss someone they get upset.

It tastes great but, takes forever to make. Rome wasn't built in a day either. Right? I stirred for alteast 1 1/2 hours until it finally reached 250 degrees. This is my first time making caramel too. They were a bit too stiff for me, but everyone else absolutely loved them. I just put a piece on a spoon and let it sit in my coffee to soften for a couple of seconds. Make sure you wrap them in wax paper to store them. I tried putting pieces in those little cute petite four paper cups and putting them on a platter and then in a zip lock bag. It makes them start to soften on the top too much. Not sure why? Odd?, but I ate them too!

I made one slight change.  I used inverted sugar for half of the granulated sugar; otherwise, I did everything accordingly to the recipe.  It is very good. the texture and the consistancy both came great.My husband said, "it is too good to have in the house."  It doesn't have a traditional caramel flavor, more of a butterscotch.

Great recipe.  It has become an expected gift at Christmas time.  It also made osm ebig bucks as an auction item.  Instead of getting greasy, try lining your pan wiht parchment paper.  You won't get nice corners, but there is no greasy mess and it lifts out of the pan perfectly! (one less dish to clean!)

Last Christmas when my family got together, we discovered that we all made caramels following this recipe.  Funny thing is, everyone's final batch came out slightly different - flavor, texture, and color - we'll blame it on different candy thermometers. Nevertheless, they were all great and none were left by the end of the week.  We definitely did NOT wrap the caramels individually - just laid them between layers of waxed paper.  
Note to self: try adding some salted peanuts next year.

Great!  The first batch I made was hard almost like toffee, but it tasted great and my kids kept begging me to break off a piece.  So I cooked the 2nd batch to 240 degrees and it was perfect.

I'm a caramel addict,always was always will be,Barbara's recipe is full of good stuff and chewy.At first 250 degrees seemed to hard for chewy,my candy thermometer recommends 244-248 degrees.But Barbara's ARE fairly soft enough,so I'm content.I rate all caramels I've ever made a 3-4.

Excellent! All I have is nonstick cookware and it took 1.5 hours to get to the right temperature. I almost gave up! I put melted chocolate on the top and sprinkled with powdered sugar too. Everyone loved them!

These are so good, and they were so easy to make. This was my first time making caramels. My husband agrees, they are wonderful. I know it goes without saying, but be sure not to touch any of the caramel right after it is done cooking, it is extremely hot (my poor finger)! :) I used a 4-qt saucepan and it was perfect for me. There was some splashing as it boiled but nothing major, just like when you are frying bacon. It only took about 30 minutes total, and the constant stirring wasnt as bad as I'd expected. Once they get close to the right temperature, be sure to watch them b/c they scorch really easily. I just turned down my burner when I started to smell them getting too hot. Definately recommend these!

If you are a caramel lover than this recipe is for you.  I love buying chunks of rich caramel from candy shops.  These taste just like them!!!  I cooked mine to 250 and it took a long time...like about 1hr or so.  I think that I'll try it again at a med-medhigh, or maybe try to only cook them to 249.  The caramels were just slightly too hard, but once you chew they do melt in your mouth...I will experiment with this recipe and use it every year!!!!

When I first attempted this recipe, I could not get it to 250 degrees. I finally gave up trying and stuck it in the refrigerator over night. The next morning it was still very soft, so I boiled it again. This time it got to 250 with no problem and tasted great! I would suggest using a large pot instead of a medium one though!

These had a good flavor but they were too soft.  I'm glad someone mentioned earlier about reviving their caramel by recooking it to 270 degrees because I was thinking that the next time I made this I was going to cook it at a higher temperature.  This time I just put it back in the microwave and cooked it for another 4 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds.  When it cooled again, it was a little chewier.

My mother made these when I was young and I have been making them for Christmas the past 35 years.  I have made them all over the world (military) and they have always turned out great.  I put the cooled caramels in the fridge to firm up a bit before cutting and then store them in the fridge. Yes, they are soft, but oh so melt-in-your-mouth good.

This is one great recipe and I use it exclusively upon finding it and after about 10 batches I say that I have not had a failure once. I think that they stack up against See's
caramels anyday and are so much cheaper as well.
Thanks Barbara.

I added pecans.  It tasted great.  It was a simple recipe and made the caramel just the right chewiness. Definately they are on my Christmas baking list for this year.

These caramels are delicious.  I added walnuts to the top of mine and then poured a layer of semi-sweet chocolate over the nuts.  They taste very similar to the tasty walnut squares from See's Candies.  Very easy recipe to follow.

The first batch of caramels I made turned out absolutely wonderful!!  I had never had so many compliments on a candy!!!  I made another batch, and I read some other reviews that their caramels turned out like hard candy and that is what my second batch did.  I agree that you should pull it from the heat at about 238 degrees.  Even when they were hard, they had a wonderful flavor.  I will make these again for sure.

These are simply delicious, the first ones I made I didn't cook long enough (no candy thermometer) but they were still very good.  Once I got the candy thermometer they turned out perfect.

These were the best caramels.  They were so soft and good.  We actually took the caramels out at about 240, I thought they were gonna burn, but I probably could have waited to do that.  They were very good.  They were really soft- probably should have cooked a little longer- but still the BEST!!!!

As noted in other reviews, it did take a long time to get to 250 - over 1/2 hour.  Also, I did do a 1 1/2 batch, since the can of evaporated milk had 4 oz left over.  I'm still waiting for it to cool.  It looks like it hasn't set right, but I might see if I can dump it into the pot again and crank up the temp to get it to set.  Or we'll just have lots and lots of ice cream topping.  Either way, it's quite yummy!  Since this was my first candy making foray, I think I'll give this one another shot - it is tasty!

My, oh my!!!  These are the best caramels I have ever made!!  I usually end up with a gooey mess that doesnt't set up right.  I cooked exactly to 250 degrees as recipes said.  I stirred the mixture until smooth and creamy before pouring into the pan.  The texture was perfect and they set up pefectly.  I wrapped and gave to  friends along with my usual candies.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

Very good recipe.  Used a larger sized pan and everything worked fine.  Took about 30 minutes to get to 250 degrees here in Iowa.  That was just the perfect temp.  Not hard, but firm enough to wrap.  Very good recipe.  Don't over grease you pan, other wise you will have extra grease on the carmels.

These were great!  Although I had to make two batches, because I burned the first one when the phone rang! :) They are very buttery and very rich.  I had trouble with them being oily after I wrapped them, but after some refrigeration, they seemed better.  Like other reviewers I had trouble with it boling over and it taking about an hour to get to 250 degrees.  I used a three quart saucepan, but I think a larger pan will be better next time.  I will definitely make these again.  I may not be allowed back at work if I don't! ;)

These caramels are the best-tasting I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly, taking the temperature to 250 degrees (just above firm ball) and they came out perfectly, softer than store-bought but just right for wrapping individually in wax paper to give away.  It does take a long time--nearly an hour--but the final product is worth it.

These are the best caramels I have ever eaten.I will never buy caramels from a cany store again.It is very important to use a LARGE pan-so it does not overflow----which mine did the first time I made them---I know use a heavy dutch oven.Thanks Barbara---I love this recipe.

The ingredients were the first to catch my eye.  Butter, sugars, corn syrup and others...what more could a person ask for?  Yes, it did take a while to cook and yes, I only took mine to about 246 degrees, but the wait was worth the taste.  Now, these are the "real thing"!

I'm always skeptical about trying a new recipe, but this is one that no one
should be afraid to try. It was so easy and quick to make. I love having new 
candies and cookies to try. Thanks for a great recipe.

I think there is two much butter in this recipe. I might be wrong, but I took the temp to 250, but I couldnt get it to get completly solid, even after it cooled. It tastes great, but I couldnt give it to friends because of the softness

Mmmm..we used this recipe to make caramel apples (it was my first time making
caramel apples so the caramel kept sliding off) so we just ended up using the caramel
as an apple dip. it came out SOOOO good. look no further for a caramel recipe.
after we made apple dip we poured the remainder into a pan and made caramel candy
pieces. YUMMY.. rich and buttery. really easy too. the only thing i did different was
add waaaay more vanilla than called for (i love lots) my husband couldn't stop raving 
about it. it was really simple too. be careful though..the mixture gets really hot so kids 
should be supervised carefully if they're helping..

thanks barbara!

This was such an easy recipe I was surprised it actually worked. The caramels are so moreish with a smooth buttery flavour.  I plan to make up jars of them for family and friends at Christmas.

These carmels are excellent! Great buttery carmel flavor! My kids and entire family loved them! 

Cooking time took a while.

Younger children shouldn't cook these, but they can wrap the carmels as my kids did.  Even my 4 year old had fun wrapping them in wax paper.

I followed the directions, plus suggestions from the reviews.  This is very time consuming,  make sure you have several hours available.  The caramels came out perfectly.  The cutting and wrapping was also a lengthy process.  Kitchen scissors worked for me (a big sharp knife and pizza cutter didn't even dent it)  The wax paper size I used was a square about a 1/3 of the width of the paper.
People I gifted these to, absolutely loved them

Made 1 change because I only had 1 1/2 cups of heavy whipping cream so I added 1/2 cup more of evaporated milk. Seemed like it was taking forever to reach 240 * but I let it cook. Caramels turned out rich, buttery and melt-in-your-mouth good. I found 1/2 sheet pan lined with foil and buttered was sufficient . I will make this again!

Just finished making this recipe, caramels are cooling so I haven’t actually tried them yet besides some leftover morsels when I was washing the pan. Seemed pretty tasty but I think I’ll like them better when they’re cool/firmer and with flaky sea salt sprinkled all over which I did while they were hot. I had never made caramels or any candy before but was craving caramels and didn’t want to spend an arm and a leg ordering some on amazon or be stuck with some gross ones so decided to give these a shot. I bake all the time but have always been a bit intimidated by candy making. I doubled the recipe so I’d have enough room to dunk caramel apples (I did 7 medium sized apples) Which I stuck onto a silicone mat which worked really well (didn’t wait for the caramel to cool at all, just dunked right after adding the vanilla) and then poured the remaining caramels and they filled a large 13.5”x8” Pyrex and a smaller 9.5”x6” Pyrex with approximately 1.5” thick caramels. I did get a bit frustrated/confused while making them because the temperature wouldn’t go up above 225 degrees for the longest time and I didn’t know what was wrong, I had to do a bit of googling to figure out that the water has to evaporate before the caramel can begin heating to a higher temperature (or something like that) but it was quite frustrating. It took over 2 hours to make them since it was a double recipe with a lot of liquid and I was expecting a max of about 50 minutes and started thinking I’d ruined them

Will definitely make it again!  I echo Ladyty1's remark about using the largest kettle/pan you have!  This was great near sea level, now at 8400' above it takes about an hour to get it to 250F.  Newbies to caramel, heed the call to stir constantly! But a great recipe!

This is my favorite caramel recipe because it is a bit of a harder chew than other recipes. I make two different recipes at the holidays, one for those who prefer a soft, light, buttery caramel, such as the recipe from this site called "Chewy Caramel," and I make this recipe for those like myself who love a hard, dark caramel that takes a little effort to chew up. Now this recipe is fantastic as-is, but I made a mistake that  made me like another version of it a little bit more. I accidentally left out the whipping cream!!! I was all prepared to chuck this batch away when I realized my mistake. But to my surprise it was great for people like me, who as a mentioned, like a hard chewing caramel, this is perfect . There is really no difference in flavor, the difference is only in the hardness....Now I will have to make three different versions of caramel every year....I like them all!!!

We didn't make any changes and it came out perfectly our first try.  We already passed the recipe on to a friend and anticipate others asking for it as well.  Easy and good.  A perfect combination.

Didn't use a candy thermometer, used the cold water method. Turned out very well. I used to help make caramels with family when I was a child and this recipe reminds me of those. Only 4 stars because it was a tad grainy,  not sure why.

I followed this recipe exactly.  I used a gas stove and a 5 quart non stick  pan.  I didnt see temp to cook with so I had a low fire going.  Took a good hour of constant stirring to get temp to 250°.  I wanted to raise fire, but since this was my first attempt to make caramels I didn't.  The caramels are fantastic tasting.  Unfortunately they are tough to cut and are not soft.  I read on different caramel recipes that they stop the temp at 238°-240°.    Once you put caramel in your mouth the caramel becomes a melt in your mouth delight.  I will make this recipe again with the exception of the 250° temp.

These came out awesome. The only thing that I changed was I used agave in place of corn syrup. When they were all set, I dipped them in milk chocolate. I brought them to my sister's house on Thanksgiving and everyone loved them.

I made this recipe to the TEE and my caramels turned into rocks!  I had a very hard time getting the temperature to get to 250!  Also, I would not grease my pan so much and I read the other reviews and I will use a 9x13" pan next time.  I am going to try again because these caramels do have a great flavor.  I am going to stop at 230 degrees.

Changes: 
   1) Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly (takes about 30-40 minutes).
   2) Cook to soft-ball stage, 240 degrees F.

The ingredients are spot on.  The temperature goes to hard-ball stage (more like a Sugar-daddy than a chewy caramel).

As other reviews suggested, you’ll need a bit of time, and a candy thermometer is helpful, but this recipe is worth it! The yield says 60, I got 90 little caramels, and they are fantastic!

Oh My GOODNESS!!  Made these for the first time last year when I couldn't find any bulk caramel in our area.  Will NEVER go back to store bought again!  It's a bit time consuming, but well worth all the effort.  These are melt-in-your-mouth dreamy delights!  And so incredibly fresh.  Don't hesitate to try this recipe - this one has been added to my yearly list for Christmas.

The best flavored caramels we've ever eaten. Takes awhile to get to 120° C, but low and slow is the key. I used my rockcrok dutch oven and it didn't scorch one bit. Smooth and chewy. Great recipe!

It should maybe be made in a bigger pan to avoid spilling over, and scorching hot bubbles bursting onto your hands.

Wow, this is the most delicious caramel that I have ever tasted.

I made this to make chocolate turtles, and other chocolate nut  candies that use caramel.

I used two high quality thermometers. One a Thermoworks probe thermometer, and another Thermoworks Infrared non-contact thermometer. For the latter I set the emissivity to .70 so that the Infrared one read the same as the probe thermometer.

I also used special techniques to ensure that all of the sugar was fully dissolved. I mixed the sugars together in a Kitchen Aid mixer, then added the liquid ingredients, then thoroughly mixed. This prevents crystallization later in the process.

When heating on the store, with a gas burner, I kept the temperature at about 4, on a scale of 1 to 10. Thus, less than medium. I found that I did not have to stir constantly.

I considered it done when the mixture was 247 to 248F, the high end of the Firm Ball stage, and this was perfect.

A little time consuming but worth it.  They came out just the right texture, not too hard.  Will make again for Christmas sharing.

It took me much longer to make than expected and stirring constantly was very tiring.  I brought it to 250ºF on my thermometer which has been very accurate for making peanut brittle.  I think that the caramel came out a bit firmer than I would prefer so next time (if there is a next time) I will stop at 240 - 245ºF.  The flavor is nice, I just wish it was a bit softer.  I also checked it in ice water and thought I hit the hard ball stage correctly, but maybe I just prefer mine a bit softer.

I followed the recipe to a tee and it took forever to come up to the 250 degrees and was all burnt on the bottom. Very disappointing, because I've made lots of other types of caramels and never had a problem. Boo hoo!

Making this exactly to the recipe but I've been boiling the ingredients for at least an hour now and it is still thin and at only 200 on my candy thermometer. I've done the hard ball test as well and it is still not even soft ball stage.  
Update: finally to hard ball stage. I poured it into pan. 2 things: pan is much too large for a thick piece of caramel. AND seems too much butter as it rises to top even after continual stirring. I drained some off.  It has not hardened so that it can be cut!  So now I put it back into a saucepan and will melt it and see if cooking it some more will do anything. With all the expensive ingredients, I hate to waste, I'll try to turn it into sauce if this doesn't work.
Would anyone please email me back and tell me what possibly could have happened?!  Thanks.  So disappointed!

Made the recipe the first time using the ingredients as written but did follow the tips of using parchment paper and I did use a smaller 10 x 15 inch pan to get thicker caramels. I adjusted for Denver altitude and pulled it at approximately 243 deg F (using a candy thermometer) It took 50 minutes on medium heat in a 5 quart non-stick pan stirring constantly. They turned out very good but slightly hard.
The second time I made it I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and one teaspoon of coarse ground Himalayan Pink salt and pulled it at 140 deg F (using an instant read Thermapen. The trad candy thermometer was between 6-8 degrees low.). They were done in about 40 minutes with the burner set between medium and medium high (between 6 and 7 on a dial with 10 increments). When it came time to cut them I used a 13 3/4 inch Bialetti pizza chopper which made it much easier and my pieces were much more uniform in size. We wrapped the individual pieces in parchment paper.

My Carmel turned out amazing! I read the review and used some of the tips offered. I used a smaller pan (8x10) and lined it with parchment paper, instead of buttering it. I also substituted honey for half of the corn syrup (next time I’m trying all honey). I cooked mine on medium low and used a metal whisk, stirring it the entire 40 minutes it took to get to hardball stage on my very old and very trustworthy candy thermometer. I let it cool for about 30 minutes before cutting it and I found it was easier to cut with a serrated knife using a sawing motion. When I tried using a bigger knife and just cutting straight down in it, it would stick to the knife.

Wow , they are good, when they say lite spray (pam) they mean it. I will most likely not use spray next time. just parchment  paper next time. I also didn't wrap them I coated them with powder sugar.

I think this was made in the comments somewhere, but I just waited to it approached "hard ball" on my candy thermometer.  I also waited about 10min and added salt [I used lava salt] to the top of the caramels.  They were amazing!

These caramels are perfect! They come out great every time, as long as I use a candy thermometer and bring to 250. I lined a small pan with chopped pecans and another small pan with broken pretzels and poured half the mixture over each. Delicious!! They make great gifts too!

Turned out excellent. Live in northern Alberta, let the temperature get to 246, burner was on low and it took about 45 min (turned it up a bit at the end to bring it to temp) and they turned out perfectly. Tried some candy wrappers from bulk barn but they stuck a little to the wrapper. Parchment paper cut into squares works well for wrapping. Also, poured into pan with parchment paper. Way better than when I buttered the pan. No butter residue, no sticking at all.

What an excellent recipe! Started off on a burner that wouldn't get it up to temp. (I am good at scorching.) When I put in on the appropriate burner it didn't take much time. The flavor and consistency was marvelous. Perfect color, everything. Keeping this in my faves file!

I made this just like the recipe and it’s a wonderful recipe! I made 5 batches for my Christmas baking this year! We ate almost half of them before I could even wrap them! I have taken them off the heat as soon as they hit 250 for a Creamier and meltier caramel and just a little longer close to 255-260 for a firmer chewier caramel. The flavor is fantastic better than werthers! Definitely making these again

I am so glad I read a review that informed me it was going to take 30-45 minutes for my caramel to get to 250*, because it did take that long! I would have given up at about 20 minutes, so THANKS! I just poured it onto the silpat mat in my cookie tray, greased the sides of the tray and it slid right out.
I sprinkled sea salt over mine after I poured it into the pan, then went over the salt with a small silicone rolling pin to press it into the caramel. FABULOUS! (Using a pizza cutter makes cutting nice clean-edged pieces a breeze!)
I'm going to use this as centers for my chocolates and just bite size caramels. It takes a while to make, but Oh Baby, is it worth it! (By the way, this is my very first attempt at making caramel, so if I can do it, you can do it!)
The one thing I did which almost messed me up: Don't leave the thermometer in the caramel the whole time. Mine got to 219 then stopped. When I finally took it out, turned it off (digital) then turned it back on & put it back in the caramel is when the temperature finally started to rise. Just an fyi for candy dummies like me...

Worst caramel recipe I've ever tried. Giving 2? for flavor, but consistency was atrocious. Never hardened enough to work with unless I re-chilled in refrigerator every ten minutes. Just stayed goopy. Also, directions call for medium pan. Don't do it. DON'T DO IT! Either use a large pan or make by the half batch. Otherwise, you'll have this stuff all over your stovetop and down in your burner and I'd strongly suggest wearing long-cuffed welding gloves.

This is an awesome recipe.   The only change I made was to use half the corn syrup and other half honey.  Delicious!

The only change I was made was to cook to soft ball temperature so that I could use this for caramel apples.  I calibrated my candy thermometer because we are high altitude and found that I needed to cook at 234 - 17 degrees to adjust for altitude and it was perfect!  thank you!

Great Recipe. They came out perfectly. I appreciated the suggestion to calibrate my thermometer.  On a gas burner this took only 20 minutes, not the 40 others suggested.

Im a good cook, but baking and confections are very foreign to me. I bought a candy thermometer and my daughter and I went crazy making batch after batch. We made caramel apples, candies, salted, and some with bacon. Great recipe and a lot of sticky fun!

No changes made. Making it again tonight for my Father-in-Law who is in Hospice care. He loves my caramels made from this recipe since I began making it YEARS ago.  Fortunately I have hands on deck for the wrapping I like to do.

When I want carmel sauce I make sure the temperature is much lower. Versatile and delicious recipe.

So  far so good. It is cooling now.  Thank you  to the earlier reviewers about the expected time.  I have not made candy since I was a kid. Visual cues are important. Stir continuously and look for that rich caramel color. A stringiness before it gets to temp.  I did not have heavy cream so I used half and half. It seems fine  How can one go wrong with butter sugar and cream!

I love these!  I make them every Christmas and give them as gifts.  Like other reviewers it is necessary to keep stirring and wait for the temperature to reach the desired state. I like mine a bit softer, so I go for 237-245 degrees.  It does take time, and it is important to not rush the process or you get the burnt chunks other reviewers have mentioned.  It is best to keep the heat constant as a medium temperature and stir continuously.  I also line my pan with non-stick foil.  If I am rushing off somewhere and cannot cut as soon as they have hardened a bit I use a cloth or rubber glove to cushion the knife as I cut the next day.

This recipe was AWESOME! I did NOT change the recipe at all. Since this was my first time trying it, I did make a mistake, but it was totally my fault. I used a candy thermometer and felt like it was taking way too long, so I turned up the heat too high, and the candy on bottom burned on the pan. I took it out quickly when I saw dark brown bits in the mixture, and poured it in my prepared pans (I used parchment paper lined pans that I sprayed with non-stick baking spray). The dark bits of "burned" candy did not affect the taste at all.  I did let the pans of candy cool on the counter for about 3-4 hours, and cut them into small 1/2 " squares (some less) with a pizza cutter. Instead of wrapping them with wax paper, use PARCHMENT paper. The wax paper made them feel greasy, the parchment paper did not . This recipe is a keeper! I had tons of compliments on the taste. I made them for Christmas and put them in re-purposed glass spaghetti sauce jars I washed, removed labels,  spray painted the lids and decorated the glass with fabric washi tape. They looked beautiful! :)

I made it with exact ingredients. Stirred sometimes, but most of the time not.  These came out perfect. Lined a pan with parchment paper instead of greasing. Also used a pizza cutter sprayed with Pam and cut them up the next day easy peasy! I liked how it made so many.

Excellent Recipe! I tried this recipe after making another that failed. For those confused about the temp, you should cook it on medium to medium high (about 5.5 - 7 on your stovetop) Although a TINY bit lighter in colour than the caramel I usually make, this caramel was easy, quick and tastes great! Fabulous for Christmas presents. Add toasted nuts for a spectacular treat, brazil or pecan are my favourite. I was pretty sceptical about making these because I have never seen a caramel recipe where you were instructed to stir the mixture....usually it says NOT to stir! However, these were smooth, creamy and no crystalization which amazed me. Don't think you can make this and NOT stir because you will end up with burned bits at the bottom. You can get away with not stirring until it hits 210 degrees, after that you must stir it! I only JUST rescued mine when I gave it a stir and saw some dark flecks come up (after not stirring for quite a while) by whisking it madly to distribute the darker flecks. I suspect the colour would have been more even and dark had I stirred continually so don't try to get away without stirring, this recipe needs it!

As far as recipes go, this one was terrible!  I tried this particular one because it looked super easy (on paper), just drop in a pot and heat... NOT TRUE.  The recipe doesn't say anything about how long to cook it, what to look for (a change in color or consistency).  After one failure, I read reviews and tried cooking it a second time.  This time, I kept testing the mixture in cold water,  I cooked it for hours until it got to a medium brown color and was thick enough that it coated the back of a spoon and didn't immediately run off.
I'll have to wait until it cools to tell if the second cooking will turn out right...

I found great instructions with the same ingredients on the Land O Lakes website. 
Combine all ingredients except vanilla, cook over medium high heat stirring occasionally for 15-20 minutes. Cook until butter is melted and mixture comes to a boil. Continue cooking 25-30 minutes until it reaches 244 F. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla. Pour in pan, cool. Cut in 1 1/2 x 1 inch pieces and wrap.

I was very skeptical as yesterday I made a different recipe and it didn't turn out well. I was very pleasantly surprised with the ease of this recipe - and the flavour is out of this world! I was stirring for over an hour - probably close to 90 mins - totally worth the effort.

Really nice caramels. I messed up by forgetting the evaporated milk until after I had raised the temp to over 200, but I stirred it in, reheated, and it came out perfectly delicious and soft. I stuck the caramels in the freezer while wrapping them in wax paper; it made them 20 times easier to handle. (You don’t want them frozen, but you want them cold enough to hold shape while you wrap them.)

Excellent! I made them for Christmas and the entire batch was swooped up and eaten in less than 45 minutes. Everybody thought I had purchased them from our local candy store. Thank you for the great recipe. I decided to write this review because I'm getting ready to make more. This will definately be my go to recipe for caramels!

Turned out perfect!  Key points...  stir, stir, stir. Otherwise stuff burns.  Use a bigger pot or kettle.  The mixture will overflow when it's boiling. Control the HEAT! Watch your temp!  Once you get to 240-245 deg. take off the stove and pour into whatever you have to pour into.  (I used a tinfoil lined cookie sheet, once the caramel was cooled, I placed in the freezer.  This allowed me to put the caramel on wax paper and remove the tinfoil without troubles.)  Lastly, wait for the caramel to warm back up to room temp before cutting.  Otherwise you chip the caramel into chunks when it's still frozen.

Great recipe....I think. I cook kosher meals and wanted to make a dairy free caramel filling/candy/chew. I subbed out the heavy cream with Rich whip pareve whipped topping(unwhipped-still in liquid form), unsalted margarine for the butter and the congealed fat out of a can of Thai coconut milk in place of the evaporated milk. It took a little longer to get to the proper temperature to be candy-set, but worked like a charm. Pareve caramel products are almost impossible to find, that are decent. Thanks for the recipe!

These caramels really freeze well! I did not change the recipe in any way and I did not have any problems with it but I know all the basic rules to follow when making candy. Since others have already posted them, I will not. I took half of the recipe and cut them into long 1 inch large strips. I wrapped them air tight in a very good freezer plastic wrap. Over the next 3 months I thought I had used them all up. Well, I was wrong, and found one in the back of the freezer a year later! I am happy to say that it was just as good as the day I made it.

Absolutely delicious the only thing I would noteI would make is to make sure you use a large pot when it starts to boil it's volume almost triples (I made a huge mess) and it's not easy to get off your stove lol

I made these for Christmas gifts.  They came out great.  Followed the recipe.  I used only white sugar as other reviewers suggested so that it would not be grainy.  Everyone loved them.  I think next time I will add a little more vanilla for some more flavor.

These are so delicious! It took 1 1/2 hours to come to temp but I'm sure it was because of the pan I used. Buying myself a heavy bottom saucepan and making again!

First time ever making caramel and followed the recipe and read through the reviews for tips, and mine came out perfect! Calibrating the candy thermometer, adjusting the boil point based on altitude, and using cold water to test readiness, were most definitely key for me. One I learned in the process was to grease/spray any wax paper prior to setting the caramel to prevent the caramel from setting on it. When this happened with my first batch, I placed it paper side down on a hot cookie sheet (175 -200F) for 1-2 minutes and it peeled right off. The second time I made it, there was slight crystallization on a very small portion, but still absolutely delish and new family favorite. I think avoiding scrapping the sides of the pot while on the stove and during the pour into the cooling pan will help prevent this - I will try this next time. For a twist, I dipped a few from my second batch in milk chocolate (chips melted in microwave), added a sprinkle or two of freshly ground Himalayan Sea Salt,  and put in the fridge to set - yum, yum, yum!

These are amazing caramels. My daughter has made these for the past 2 years at Christmas. It is now her dish that she has to bring. Everyone loves these even the people that don't like caramel love these. Flavor is great and they aren't to sticky like caramels can be.

These caramels came out perfectly. Another reviewer noted to adjust the temp reading to your altitude. I'm at almost 9000 ft, so I adjusted to 235, but also tested using the cold water test. They are PERFECT! Thanks for the great recipe.

These didn't turn out for me, but I'll give the recipe the benefit of the doubt. I didn't make any substitutions, but it was my first time making caramels, and I was using a new candy thermometer, so it's most likely my fault. My only issue with the recipe as written is that it doesn't say how quickly to bring up the temperature or what setting to use the stovetop. I was afraid of burning it, so I heated it slowly--starting on low-med and gradually increasing the heat to high--and it took 90 minutes before my thermo read 250!

They ended up being way too soft, messy, sticky, and nearly impossible to cut into perfect squares to wrap up in paper. I probably didn't reach high enough temperature, even though my thermometer said 255 degrees. Sadly, I couldn't use them as part of my Christmas treats for the family. However, the texture was silky smooth and they still taste great, so I will try this again another time and use what I made as caramel topping or sauce for a different dessert.

These caramels are soooo yummy! My neighbors and family look forward to their Christmas caramels. I follow the recipe as written and have had great success. It seems to take forever but just keep stirring! In my last batch I did add some orange extract just after removing from the heat and it made them even yummier!

Dangerously good!!! We can’t stop eating them! A few tips: cook over medium/low heat to prevent burning and stir constantly! Don’t walk away even for a minute! Use a much bigger pot than you think, as it expands once it reaches a boil. Be patient! It took mine an hour to cook, but my patience was rewarded!

This recipe makes hard caramels. It is good, but I thought they would be soft. Extremely hard to cut.

I found this recipe to be very delicious, but I was looking for a softer caramel.  I made two batches. The first, I waited until the temperature of the caramels reached 250 degrees. I found that the caramels were too firm for what I wanted (still chewy and the flavor was great). The second, I took the mixture off the heat at 240-245 degrees and they turned out soft and buttery. I had many friends and family members try both versions, everyone preferred the second batch. If you are looking for a softer caramel,  I would recommend taking them off the heat before the temperature hits 250 degrees.

NOte that if you expect this to end up being a chewy caramel like the picture that is shown with it you will be dissapointed. I cooked mine to the 250 it calls for thinking it would be firm but not hard.  It's effectively a Werthers style caramel. Taste is good.

Next time I'll try cooking to 240 as I like chewy caramels.

Ok so I made these and they taste amazing. I will make one suggestion. It does not tell the temp to make this concoction. So, start at medium heat until the caramel boils after about 10 increase heat just a little to increase temperature. Continue doing this until you reach 250 degrees. Don't hurry. You will see it begins to thicken and increase in volume. Enjoy!!

Deee-licious! First time I made it didn't work because I didn't realize I could get the  temp up to 250 F. It seemed stuck at 220 F and I got impatient. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to reheat it and patiently waited for temp to climb. Poured it over parchment paper once it reached 250 F. Cut with a pizza cutter when it was partially cooled. Total yield = 2.7 lbs. Will make this again for sure.

11/6/2016: Great flavor, but I took it to 250 and think I should have taken it off at 248.  Its chewy like taffy.  Needs to be a little softer imho.
The tips were helpful, definitely use a large pan and calibrate your thermometer.  I cooked it on medium heat, stirring every 10 minutes.  It boiled for about 40 minutes to get to 250. 
Update 11/18/2017:  I took these to 242 degrees and they turned out perfect.  Soft and wrappable, but won't tear your fillings out!  Thanks for a yummy recipe.

The directions are very vague. Even at the end the notes state to use aluminum foil...not sure what to use it for. After over an hour of stirring and it had yet to reach 250, I gave up. And yes, I wish the written directions were more clear. I spent a lot of money on the ingredients to mess up.

I made this one and was very pleased with the taste and texture. Very smooth. I chose this recipe because of the 41 year statement from Barbara and that it had brown sugar. I wanted to see how the brown sugar would affect the taste.  Love it. Everyone loves it. I am definitely making it again.

Perfect flavor!  Only change I would make is the temp.  I followed another reviews suggestion and stopped cooking according to my altitude (248 degrees).  Was too soft.  Going to try it at 250 degrees as the recipe states next time.  ...Yes, there will be a next time!  Delicious!

I've made this twice. Both times were excellent. It took about and hour of stirring to get it to 248, but it was well worth it and it didn't burn. I used a 9X13 pan and put parchment paper in the bottom. It lifted right out when cooled and I cut into 1X1 pieces. I got 120 per batch. I also sprinkled with sea salt when nearly cooled and I used Gentleman Jack instead of vanilla.

I've made this twice already and love it!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The first time I heated to 245 degrees.  The second time I made it I heated to 250 degrees.  Both took a little over 2 hours to reach.  I can't really tell the difference in the increased heat.  This batch makes over 100 pieces depending on how you cut them.  It is very time consuming to wrap each one.  I do it over a course of 3 days.  The first time I wrapped it took sooooo long.  I do love this recipe!  Great for gifts.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I tried it exactly as the recipe directed and it never would thicken up. Maybe if you use Sweetened Condensed Milk instead of evaporated milk it would work better. In order NOT to lose all my ingredients, I had to add 3 cans of sweetened condensed milk and another whole bottle of corn syrup. Next time I'm sticking to the recipe in my tried and true Betty Crocker cookbook.

First time making caramels, very easy and they are AMAZING!!  I did follow other reviews as far as lining sheet with parchment paper rather than lightly greasing. Once I pored in the pan I waited about 5 min then covered half with sea salt. I think next time I will do sea salt on the whole thing!!

The Carmel was a bit to soft when brought to the 250 degree temperature as the directions stated. I reheated the mixture to 285 degrees and it turned out great! I will absolutely make it again.

Made this and I thought, "These are the best caramels I've ever eaten!" Gave some to my mom and she said, "This is the best caramel I've ever tasted in my life!". She's 92.  Guess that says it all.

Loved the recipe, really simple and delicious!  My family gobbled them up straight away and were begging for more!  I've since found this lemon myrtle caramel recipe and wanted to share it as the addition of lemon myrtle is amazing, plus there are some other tips I found really useful. http://stirringchange.com/2015/11/26/lemon-myrtle-recipe-creme-fraiche-caramels/

I made and ruined more batches of caramel then I care to recount. This one came out perfect and tastes amazing. The key was that I sat and stirred on low/medium heat for over an hour making sure nothing stuck or burned on the bottom. Yep tons of work but I was so pleased with the results I'd happily do it again. I may invest in one of those automatic pan stirrer gadgets next time. I used a very large pot with a copper bottom and used a regular prong thermometer to get it to 243 as I wanted mine a little soft.  I poured this onto parchment paper that was placed in a 9 x 13 baking dish and then covered with Saran Wrap after it cooled. It comes out cleanly.  I didn't find that it doubled in size but it did make a huge amount. Wonderful recipe if you invest the time.

I've made these a few times over the past couple of yrs. & I'm way overdue posting a review. I started my "Perfect Caramel Search" after a trip to Disney World. We were in Epcot and stopped in at a little caramel shop. (I swear they film the Werther's commercials there. It looked exactly like the "Werthers Store" that we see on TV. Anyway, I had a salted, chocolate-covered caramel that was to-die-for ... and so began my search to replicate this amazing candy. THIS RECIPE IS IT!!!! The only suggestion I can make is to line your pan with parchment & give it the *barest* of sprays with Pam (or any cooking spray). If you over-do it your caramels will have a greasy film, (but still taste great!). Also, take a few minutes to calibrate your candy thermometer-- this is important! Just Google "How to calibrate a candy thermometer). After cooled, I cut into small squares, dip in melted milk chocolate & sprinkle each chocolate-covered square,(before the chocolate has set!), with a pinch of flaked sea salt. They're so, sooo good!!!! I only make them once a year, during the holidays, because if I made them more than that we'd all weigh 300 lbs. :)

I poured the caramel over a thin layer of chocolate/toffee chips and it came out amazing! I even forgot to put the vanilla in, but the flavor is still really good. I did add some salt, but those were my only changes.

My daughter and I made these yesterday, trying to totally go by the recipe instructions.  Problem was that not enough instructions were included in the recipe!  No instructions were given as to what heat setting to use.  I tried medium to medium high, wanting to avoid scorching and splatter.  Yet We just couldn't seem to break past the 225 F level.  Then we had to interupt our cooking just as the temperature  finally started breaking this plateau, climbing slightly to around 230 F - and the mixture rapidly started to increase in volume, rising nearly to the rim of the 3 quart pot we were using.  After we transferred contents to a 4  qt. pot and resumed heating, that again seemed to stall around 225 F.  Raising the heat setting on the range did not result in rising temperatures within the caramel mixture, according our candy thermometer.  When we finally got to 250 F, we quickly removed it from the heat and added the vanilla; after a quick stir, we poured the caramel into a prepared pan.  I noticed the hot caramel mixture was darker brown than it had been when we first removed it from the heat.  After the caramel cooled, it seemed to have a stiffer, less chewy texture than expected, as well.  My family was highly enthusiastic about our caramels, even if our results were a little off the mark.  And I know I will try this recipe again - in a 4 quart pot on medium high heat.  But I was a bit disappointed about the outcome on this first attempt.

These taste great. However I read a review that stated if you were going to make caramel apples, double the recipe. You really don't need to. You could easily dip 6 apples without doubling the recipe. But I did anyway. Now perhaps I had the heat too low, but it took 3 hours to get to 245 degrees.  I finally just turned the heat up. They still came out a bit soft, but I l like them softer anyway. Perhaps I should have asked how hot the stove should be? Oh well. They still turned out good and the apples were marvelous. I still had enough for about 100 large, wrapped candies.

My first try at this was a total failure.  I took it off the heat a little before 250 but it was still too late, and the candy ended up too hard to eat.  I will try again at some point and just use cold water to test it and hope I can take it off at a better time.  Flavor was good.

Wonderful and easy-to-follow caramel recipe.   I poured into a pan lined with parchment paper for non-greasy caramels and easy clean up.   I tried to do this on low, but the temp wouldn't break 190, so I bumped to just under medium and that worked great.   I cut after cooled, but left them on the parchment paper.   Then froze, broke apart and bagged into ziploc bags.

Great recipe! Although it took a while to get the temp to 250. It also took a fair amount of time for it to cool down but was worth the wait. Thank you for sharing this

This caramel is awesome.  It does take a long time to reach the temperature, but so worth it.  I used my metal candy thermometer that I have had awhile, and it was right on target.  The first time I made caramel apples and they were just so soft and didn't stick to your teeth.  I am making some turtles for Christmas with this, and I can't wait to see how they turn out.  Be careful... these are so addictive.:

You know, I've never made a batch of caramels that turn out perfectly like my Auntie Kathy's caramels.  Arrghhh! At any rate, the flavor of these is spectacular.  I used a Thermapen to ensure precise temp readings, but these still ended up hard the next day. My fault, not that of the recipe, so this recipe gets five stars without a doubt.  That said, I live at 5,000 ft and adjusted the temp two degrees for every 1000 ft in elevation (so I stopped at 240F), although some parts of the mixture were at 240, while the center was at 242F.  Next year, I'll stop when the hottest part is at 240F.  Per another reviewer's rec, I let these cool for 10 minutes, put them in the freezer for another five, then cut and wrapped in wax paper. Despite storing these in an airtight container, they were hard the next day. If anyone else making these at 5000ft ended with perfect caramels please let me know what you did differently.  My husband's colleagues raved about these even though they were on the hard side. This recipe is a keeper.

Use this recipe every year for my chocolate covered smoked sea salted caramels! I like my caramels a softer chewy so I cook till 240 degrees. Last batch I made I actually smoked the heavy whipping cream over hickory for 2 hours. It was the best batch I thus far!

First attempt at making caramels, and received so many compliments on their taste and texture (not being pull-out-your-fillings hard). I sprinkled flaked sea salt on the finished product, and loved the sweet-and-salty flavors -- but was hoping for the caramels to be a tad softer)! Glad I used a 10.5 x 12.5 pan.  I just didn't realize I'd be standing over the stove, stirring for about 2 hours, at medium-low, waiting for the mixture to reach 250-degrees!!

I wish directions on recipes matched what's stated on videos; thankfully, I watched the video, which states to cook on medium-low; in addition, the video shows to line the pan with parchment paper before spraying -- both are not included in the recipe.

I read tons of reviews and gathered many tips before making this. Here's the compilation I found helpful, plus some of what I gathered when I made it. Use a large kettle. Cook on medium. If temperature gets stuck in the 220 degree range, start *slowly* raising the temperature. This does not need to be monitored as closely at the beginning (first 20 minutes) as it does in the later stages. This will take a while to cook - be prepared to stir for 40 minutes or so. Line a pan with parchment paper instead of greasing. Using a large pan (12x15) makes caramels that are thin and hard to wrap - I ended up folding mine, so it resulted in the same 120 pieces that I got when using a 9x13 pan (I recommend this size). Using a pizza cutter and cooking scissors to cut these was a winning combination. Just make sure the caramels are cool enough first or the pizza cutter will stick. Wrap in wax paper, but do not put caramel that has not cooled on wax paper, or it will stick and be ruined. Do not scrape the pot when pouring the caramels into the pan. Instead, consider having a small sheet of parchment paper that you can collect the side caramel on. Even if the caramel does not look burned/scorched, the texture may be different from the easily poured caramel, so you can end up ruining parts of the main tray by trying to get that little bit more. The unscorched scrapings are still good, just not easy to cut or gift-worthy. I tried substituting a quarter cup of corn syrup for honey but I was not

I've been making caramels the traditional way (boiling the sugar, and then adding the cream and butter) for 3 years with rave reviews. So I don't know why I decided to try a new recipe. I thought it sounded easy and the reviews were great. I have no idea why it failed so miserably. I boiled the mixture between medium and medium high like I would my other ones. The temperature was climbing ever so slowly. I was getting nervous because the color was right but the temp was still 225. And sure enough, it separated into a nasty mess. I'm not sure how to dispose of a pan of 225 degree molden sugar and butter.

*cupcake papers make quick and easy wrappers!* Made these with eggnog in place of the evaporated milk and whipping cream.  Also added 1.5 tsp of Nutmeg and 0.5 tsp cinnamon.  Some tasted eggnog, some tasted pumpkin spice, but either way, the adaptations were a success.   This was also my first time to make caramels and I was really nervous. I followed the directions and the good advice from reviews.....and they were wonderful!

First time I made it and it was wonderful! Followed directions to the letter and now have to cut many many pieces of waxed paper ;-) Everyone's hints were super helpful. I've been wanted to make caramels for a long time and am glad to have found this recipe. It will be a new addition to my Christmas giving!

This is a great recipe. Check the altitude of where you live before you make it. It makes a difference if you live at a high altitude level. I checked baking altitude prior to making it to make sure I cooked it to the correct candy temp.

I've made this recipe the last 3 years and it's quickly become a family favorite! Some things I've noticed (similar to other reviewers):
-this recipe is flexible--I've used honey in place of corn syrup, 1/4 c bourbon instead of vanilla, and whole milk for part of the cream in a pinch 

-you will want to use a large pot because the recipe increases in size by roughly 2-3 x original volume during cooking (it deflates again towards the end)

-you will want to stir pretty frequently after it starts to heat up with a heat resistant instrument--wood or silicone work best. No one wants to eat little melted pieces of plastic in their caramels. 
-I cook mine on high heat (wouldn't do this unless youre going to be at the stove stirring pretty constantly) because otherwise it takes a long time to get to the right temp

--I recommend a digital candy thermometer if you have one but a regular works well. I can now tell when it's done by the feel of it while I stir but I've made it 6 or seven times by now. 

-that being said, I've spaced out and gotten darker caramels or taken it off the heat earlier--all delicious just depends on how hard you want the caramels to be and how much you like the more bitter flavored that develop (which we do). 

-use parchment in the pan, and grease it. You'll be glad you did.

Used a large pot. Doubled in volume when hot. Cooled for 15 on counter and transfered it to the freezer for 15 before cutting. Easy cut, easy wrap, delicious treats! Thanks for this recipe...going in my favorites!

These caramels are a hit every time I make them.  We are usually lucky if there are any left to give away. I line a cookie sheet with parchment paper instead of greasing the pan, but other than that, no changes to the recipe. YUM!

I lined my glass 13X9" pan with parchment paper and they came out perfect!you will get thicker pieces, but we didn't mind personally :) the directions i used for cooking was to start out between low/medium heat until the butter gets incorporated and then i popped it up to med heat until about 225*, at 225* i popped it up to med/high heat and cooked it the rest of the way only stirring occasionally. they are a beautiful golden brown and taste amazing!!!!! this recipe is awesome!

These are FANTASTIC.  Recipe does not say whether to use light or dark brown sugar or corn syrup, so I used dark brown sugar and light corn syrup. I put some coarse ground sea salt on top of a little less than half the pan and I wish I had put it on the whole, as the salted ones were so so good. I waited until they were fairly cool to add the salt, so I had to press it into the caramels. Next time I make them, I will salt the whole pan and will do it as soon as I pour it into the pan, as I believe it will stick better. Also, I will use a smaller pan next time, to make them a little thicker, just as a matter of my own preference.

No changes here- it came out perfect! I had never made caramels before (though I had made toffee). The candy thermometer is absolutely crucial- the temperature matters a great deal! 

Anyways, they were easy enough to make, and I definitely cooled them in the freezer before moving them to the fridge- didn't affect the taste that I could tell. People thought I had bought them from the store, not that I had made them myself. I find that to be a big compliment actually. 

Definitely some of the most delicious caramels I've ever had. Worth a shot to try!

I am by no means an expert candy maker, but I have made this recipe several times and as long as I keep my mind on what I am doing, they turn out great....make sure to use a larger pan then you think you need, the mixture will bubble up quite a bit,  and it does take some time to reach 250 degrees.  After cooling my caramel completely, I cut into bit sized pieces and dip in melted chocolate, milk and bittersweet,  while the chocolate is still a bit soft, I will sprinkle on some finely ground nuts or sea salt...they make for great Christmas gifts...very yum!

Made exactly as directed, and came our excellent.  Did account for 5000 feet above sea level, removed from heat at 240 degrees and it was perfect.  Lovely addicting taste, melts easily to make homemade turtles.  EXCELLENT!

This makes a lot. It takes a while for the temp to go from 220 to 250 but be patient so it doesn't  burn.  I cooked on med to med high.

I purposely made this to cover apples as another reviewer did.  Maybe I did something wrong but it would not stick to the apples.   I  washed them as someone suggested.  Refrigerated them as someone else suggested and it was like an oil slick.  It was HORRIBLE.  It would not stick to the apple at all.  Very disappointing.  
The caramel tasted fine but not for the purpose in which I made it.

I love this recipe. I've made it a few times and it always comes out nice. It is very easy to follow which is great for beginner candy makers. :) Everyone loves to eat the caramels, I bring a bunch to my office for coworkers and they are gone by the end of the day. If you wrap the cut pieces individually in wax paper they keep for quite a while.

I love this recipe but it never take me less than 2 hours to make it.  I'll need to try making it in a non-nonstick pan as other reviews suggest. It is a very forgiving recipe - I've made it several times where it hasn't set up properly and I was able to put it all back in the pan to keep cooking it for a successful finish.   Try sprinkling some coarse sea salt on it.

I found this recipe in a Land 'O Lakes cookbook years ago and still love making them. Sometimes I add chopped, toasted pecans right at the end & after it cools, I cut them and cover in chocolate for turtle bars. Also switched one cup granulated sugar with 1 1/4 cups granulated maple sugar & it added a very nice, subtle maple flavor. I have found the easiest way to cut these is to use a pizza wheel.

I must say these are good but not great. I've made caramels before and these were very basic but took a LONG time to make. I would make these again but only in a pinch, there was far too much butter in the recipe and mine came out very greasy.

Best taste: not overly sweet, but definitely sweet enough!
I read lots of the reviews and following the advice I found, they came out perfect:
A 4-quart sauce pan was just the right size.

I used unsalted butter but added salt to the recipe. I used dark brown sugar.
I removed the mixture from the heat the second it almost reached 250 and the texture was perfect... not too chewy and not too soft (at about 400 ft. elevation...close to sea level)

A 9 x 13" pan for setting the caramels was the right size. I think that the larger size recommended in the recipe would have made the caramels too flat. I lined a non-stick baking pan with parchment paper on the bottom and the set caramel came right out easily.

I bought caramel wrappers from a website with the words caramel wrappers in it and they were perfect for wrapping them. I think that wax paper wouldn't have worked.
The hardest part was cutting them... took strength. Dough scraper worked best with extra help from kitchen sheers. Pizza cutter was ok too.
I'm not sure I'd have the courage to tinker with the recipe, but maybe it could use a little bit less butter.

I love caramel and anything homemade always tastes better, but this recipe is just not working for me. I have tried this recipe twice and both times they did not set up right. The first time I did everything exactly as the recipe said and my caramel never set up. The second time I cooked the caramel until it began to get thick and it ended up being way to hard so it also ended up in the trash.

I don't make a lot of candies and this was my first caramel since I was a little kid. I couldn't get the temp of the liquid to over 240 F. I turned up the heat on my stove top to 7 (out of 10) hoping that would move the heat along. It stayed there for about 20 minutes while I constantly stirred. No luck. I finally got burned by the splatters enough that I called it a day. My caramels are too soft and have a grittiness to them. Any advice on how to manage the heat? Should I try a larger pot (used a med pot per in the directions)? It cooking and stirring for about 40 min not enough?

This was my first attempt at making caramels and even though I accidentally used regular whipping cream instead of heavy whipping cream, they turned out perfectly. I sprinkled kosher salt on top because I love that salted caramel taste. Thank goodness I only made half a recipe and then gave half to a friend or I would have eaten them all myself. Definitely a keeper!

The recipe says to use a medium pot I recommend a Dutch oven otherwise anything smaller will boil over. These are the best caramels and you mu st follow the cooking instructions even though it takes a while to reach 250 degrees it will be well worth all that stirring.

This recipe produced the most amazing caramels I've ever tasted!! I calibrated my candy thermometer as recommended by a reviewer, and found that it was 10 degrees off! So...I used the cold water test, and it turned out perfectly. Definitely will make these again :)

I made these on Christmas Eve to take to relatives Christmas day.  I've never made candy before, and this was very easy for a beginner.  It did take about 40 minutes like others have said.  I also used Cane Sugar syrup instead of Corn syrup, and my caramels came out quite soft.  Not sure if this is the reason, but it's the only thing I changed.  I'm in Houston at nearly sea level, and I checked that my thermometer was calibrated.  Of course I hadn't realized that it would take quite some time to wrap all of these.  I got nearly 150 caramels from this recipe!  Will certainly be making this again.

Wonderful recipe!! I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't so greasy. They probably wouldn't be as tasty if it wasn't for all the butter either so what can I do , eh. I have found using parchment paper instead of greasing the pan helps. Also I'm a big ghost pepper fan and discovered that adding a 1/4 teaspoon of finely ground ghost pepper in with the vanilla gives these a nice kick that most people really enjoy. They are a big hit at parties ;)

Fabulous! It takes a L O N G time to get to 250 degrees. If you rush it, you will scorch it and ruin it. But if you just keep stirring for about an hour, and watch that thermometer, it will be awesome. Besides plain caramels, I also use this as a base for pecan turtles, roasting the pecan halves for about 7 minutes at 350, then dropping them in about half of the caramel and scooping out in heaping teaspoons, then coating in good chocolate after they solidify for a while. My husband says that it can't be beat!

I used this recipe to make caramel for the first time. I used medium pan and use the ingredients and the proportions as the recipe calls out. Never occurred to me that something might be wrong. As it started to boil and just immediately boil right up over the pan. How about putting a denotation of how big of a pan next time! Otherwise, the Very Best caramels that I have ever had.

I have made this recipe many times and it is always a hit when I get the temperature right and the caramels are chewy, not hard.  248 degrees seems to be our sweet spot for perfect caramels.  When we take it up to 250 degrees, the caramels are harder and more difficult to cut out of the pan.

I followed this recipe to a T and everything was going well until I added the vanilla. The temperature difference shocked the caramels causing the butter to separate. Tasting the caramel before and after the vanilla, I hardly tasted a difference so next time I will skip the vanilla.  So while this recipe gives the right ingredients and proportions, I knocked off a couple of stars for it's lack of technique

I have never tried to make caramels before, so I wasn't sure how they would turn out. I like soft caramels, so I only cooked them to 230 degrees. They turned out perfect and oh so soft. Even keep them in the fridge, and they can be eaten easily cold. Very good recipe.

Perfect recipe! Beautifully balanced flavor. I made a few caramel apples as well as the individual pieces and everyone loved it. 
Hardest part will be having enough left over to wrap and share with people.

This was my first time making caramel, and even working with sugar, but the caramels turned out wonderfully! I read a lot of previous reviews which helped a lot, and was able to make some caramels to give to friends and teachers for Valentines day.

I only give this 3 stars because the directions are not the best for first time caramel makers. I recommend looking into caramel cooking further than these directions go. I had to re cook my caramel because it didn't set the first time around.

These caramels taste great! I followed the recipe exactly as written and used suggestions from several other reviewers: I calibrated my candy thermometer, I used a regular stainless steel pot, and made sure that I had plenty of time to devote to stirring. I dipped apples in some and then poured the rest up for candy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these for Christmas and still have people begging me to make more in August!  All of my friends have tried to shortcut salted chocolate-covered caramels and say nothing matches these :). This recipe will be part of our Christmas tradition.  Thank you for sharing!

Great easy recipe.  A few others have mentioned: use a larger pot than you think you'll need!  The mixture inflates quite a bit.  Wasn't sure what to expect for cooking times and mine was a little faster than others... At medium-high heat it still took around 20 minutes which I think might have been a bit too quick... Will have to try lower/longer next time.

Tried this the other day but used B grade maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  It came out a little softer than I'd like so obviously the change requires a little more cooking time (I'm guessing around 255-260).  The maple syrup packs a flavor punch... very nice.

I have done this recipe for years!  I love it!  Yes, I test my digital thermometer every time.  I make a double batch every time.  It freezes superbly!  I put chopped pecans on the bottom of my casserole dishes before I pour the caramel in the dish.  I have never cooked this recipe above 242 degrees.  For Cincinnati, Ohio, 242 degrees is the perfect temperature.

I made this recipe with a few changes made out of necessity! I had 600ml of cream to use up, which is bit more than 1 pint, so i used less milk accordingly (Full fat milk not evaporated as that is all i had). I also used glucose syrup instead of corn syrup, because that is what i had in the pantry and also only had about 3/4 cup. (plus corn syrup is hard to find here in australia) I put it into my largest saucepan which only JUST fitted. When it started bubbling up i had to take it off the heat a few times till the bubbles subsided! As the mixture reduced though this ceased being a problem. I actually cooked it on the highest heat, coz i couldn't be bothered to stand there for hours stirring and waiting for it to get up to temp. It took just over 1/2 hour to get to the right temp. I poured it into a 23cm square pan and let it cool at room temp overnight. In the morning it cut up beautifully into small squares. And the TASTE!!!! AMAZING!!! I had previously made some caramels like this, only with that recipe you are not supposed to stir while it boils and they came out very chewy, as in stick-jaw-style chewy! But this recipe, with all that stirring turned out wonderful! Chewy enough so that you can still bite them easily. I imagine that the chewiness would also depend on how little or much you cook the mix. I will definitely be making them again, they made a lovely gift too!

We made this caramels to coated our apple. This recipe doesn't work for us, it was too runny and doesn't stick on the apple after so many attempt we finally just dip the apple into it. It taste good though.

I cannot say enough about this recipe to make you understand how amazing they are! I made them for this past Christmas for family and friends and everyone raved about them! I made two different recipes. I did one plain recipe and one that I drizzled with melted dark chocolate and sprinkled with sea salt. My favorite was the chocolate one. After they cooled down completely, I cut them into squares and placed onto a large cooling rack. Than I  drizzled them with the melted chocolate and than let them dry for about 10 minutes and than sprinkled them with sea salt. Than I stuck the whole rack into the refrigerator and let them set up. Once they were all ready, I put them into mason jars and kept them in the fridge until I gave them to my friends. Great recipe! So so yummy!

I loved the flavor of this recipe, but I wanted to share an issue I had with a substitution. I discovered after starting the recipe that I was out of corn syrup, and went online for a substitute- sugar and a little water plus a pinch of baking powder to keep it from crystallizing.  It didn't keep the caramels from crystallizing.  I even tried to remelt them and added corn syrup and they were still crumbly.  You really need the corn syrup to avoid this issue!

This was my first time EVER making candy of any kind. With that said, these came out 100% perfect. I cooked it in a good-sized pot, over medium-low heat, stirring constantly -- a pain, but well worth the effort. My husband, who is very stingy with compliments, told me they were "spot on." I was really impressed with how well they turned out -- they look and taste amazing. This recipe must be wonderful, because if a complete beginner can make it work, anyone can! I like a little saltiness, so I used one stick of unsalted butter, and one of salted. I will be making these every year for Christmas gifts for family and friends. Can't say enough good things about this recipe -- THANK YOU!!

Excellent caramels, I have tried many recipes and this is easy and makes a large amount.  Good for gifts and not too hard on your teeth.  Make sure you watch the temp., that is the key to making good caramel. 248 -250deg.

I make these every year as teacher gifts, and they are fabulous.  It does take about 35-40 min. to get up to temp. I go slow using medium heat so the butter doesn't scorch. I line a 9"x13" pan with parchment paper, making sure to crease it so it stays. I have found the best temperature to be 240-242 degrees, which is the soft ball stage on a candy thermometer.  Anything more I find to be too hard and not creamy enough.  Also, I try to scrape down the pan very quickly, if not what is left in the pan becomes like a crust because it gets too hard. After cooled several hours, I take the parchment paper out, lay flat and cut into 1/2" sections with a pizza cutter. Then cut again into 1 1/2" pieces and wrap each with wax paper.

This was my first time making caramels,and they came out perfect.
Great flavor and perfect texture.
I added two cups of toasted pecans,and sprinkled with sea salt.
I lined the pan with parchment,and had no problems.I did have to cook over low heat for about 40 minutes to get to 250 on my candy thermometer.
I will be making these again and again.
Thanks for sharing Barbara

I made these without a candy thermometer and I overcooked them.  Some of the reviews stated that the mixture would double in size and I kept waiting for that to happen.  Even when it got to the hardball stage (according to a drop of mixture in cold water), I kept stirring waiting for it to double.  It never did and I finally poured it out on the cookie sheet.  It was too hard for caramel but did make a nice caramel candy.  I am giving it 5 stars because the taste is wonderful and I have no double this would have turned out perfectly with a candy thermometer.

This one is going in my recipe box. The only changes I made was to add vanilla seeds instead of liquid vanilla, because I like that better. I cooked it until precisely 250 degrees, and I'm right at sea level. I used as a layer in dipped chocolates, so I worked with it while it was still pretty warm, then threw the centers in the freezer before dipping. It worked really nicely.

This recipe was easy and the caramel tasted delicious. I used this recipe to make caramel apples and didn't have any problems, and I'm not a good cook or baker. I don't know if this helps anyone, but I used a heavy stainless steel pot (tri-ply).  I set the gas burners to medium and stirred slowly for approximately 20-30 mins.  I don't have a candy thermometer, and I'm not even sure what a firm ball stage is...had to use some common sense.  I made perfect caramel apples and I used the left over for caramel candy.  It was the same texture and consistency as any store bought caramel I've had. It was worth the effort which really wasn't much at all. Oh, I halved this recipe, but didn't change it at all.

Caramels were soft and chewy with an amazing flavor! Absolutly make sure you cook them long enough (or they get a bit squishy), and I added a little sea salt to the top of each for that extra something.

These were up for a grand champion ribbon at the county fair and get the opportunity to go to State Fair next week.  They are THAT good!  It takes time to get to temp,. but the end results are sooo worth it.  Have patience and you will be richly rewarded with this candy.

I have made caramels countless times, and every time it doesn't work.  I learned of a trick on another site where you cook the sugar to 340, and then add the cream and butter.  If you are going to do it this way, make sure that the ingredients are at a similar temperature, because otherwise the dang thing curdles (this would happen to me when doing it the way described in this recipe as well).  One thing i learned is that temperature is important.  If it gets too high, it scorches. I cook the candy on top of two grates, this way the flame isn't too close to the bottom of the pan, and I don't have to worry about the candy burning, just place it on low medium heat (just enough that it climbs in temperture) this has made things so much simpler when making candy.

I followed the recipe as written.  It took a long time to get it up to 250, but they turned out delicious.  My college bound daughter has already requested these in a care package!

I've tried it twice and it came out solid like a rock both times.  I followed it as stated above, getting it to a firm ball state (250 degrees) and put it into a lightly greased pan, and it was solid like a rock after 15 minutes.  It would taste great if it didn't come out so firm. Anyone know if I should just be heating to soft ball state?  I want them to be chewy.

I followed recipe exactly and took the good advice from other reviewers that it takes about 45 minutes to get to 250 degrees- and very lightly buttered the pan- too much and the caramels get oily. Also- don't overlook- one time my caramels were the consistency of rock candy and were inedible. I sprinkle with Maldonado Sea salt flakes or Kosher salt when done - yummy salted caramels. This is an excellent recipe and always get rave rereviews!

This is FABULOUS!!! Exactly what I was looking for, I am making these for the entire family to go in the Christmas tins. After they harden, I cut them into small strips and wrap in parchment paper. Add some vanilla beans, and they are absolutely to die for! I couldn't stop eating them.

I need help? The caramel won't set. So far it has been sitting in the pan cooling for 5 hours. I made a batch of thick, delicious caramel syrup. It is NOT something I can cut. What happened? Is there anything I can do to correct? FYI, the only thing I did to deviate from the original recipe was to use 1/2 cup of corn syrup and 1/2 cup of honey rather than 1 cup of corn syrup and no honey.

Great recipe for ingredients, however, I think that the temperature needs to be adjusted somewhat. 250F is right around the line for softball and firmball, and my caramel turned out pretty gooey and soft.  Next time I'll try for closer to 260F which is hardball.

Great carmels! My daughter and I ruined our first attempt...had a hard time getting the temp up to 250. Second try took at least 45 minutes and we almost burned it...but they turned out great.

Turned out perfectly the first time!  Will definitely make again and try some variations (chocolate, nuts, etc).

Update:  I have now made these caramels twice.  Perfect both times.  These caramels are irresistible!

Excellent!  I substitued 30 percent fat cream for the evap milk and the whipping cream.  They came out DELICIOUS.  I used salted butter because I like that flavor with the sweetness.

Very good but I use a digital thermometer to get a rough temp and rely on cold water to get the exact stage I like.  The recipe uses 2 sticks of butter, next time I'm going to try a stick and a half.  There was a good ammount of oil from the butter around the edges after pouring it to cool.  Also, I replaced the corn syrup with honey worked fine but for a bit less taste change I think I'll half and half them next time.  All in all, a good recipe to start with!

Ok so I am not a candy maker and this was really my first attempt at making anything that involved using a thermometer so it shouldn't be a surprise that I messed it up a bit but even so, I do know enough about cooking and baking to comment: This reciept is a bit greasy and might work best if we reduce the butter? I went to 246 degrees (reduced because I am 1700 ft above sea level and to accomodate the thermometer calibration) and in the end I got a very hard butterscotch like candy and not a chewy caramel so next time i will go to a lower temp.  I made a stupid mistake and lined my pan with foil before greasing it and it just made it stick to that and sadly what I was able to seperate then stuck to the wax paper so my guess is that it should have been poured on a stone and not a pan at all.  I also added the vanilla in at the beginning and don't know if that impacted anything...someone else can respond if they know.  It was fairly easy to do and it does taste yummy but watch out for any fillings or crowns cause this is the type of candy that will for sure pull them right out.  Thanks Barbara - glad you perfect this over the last few decades and hopefully next time I will make it more like a caramel and not a candy.  Luis

I really liked the flavor of the caramels, but I believe that I made a mistake. When the mixture hit 250F, I pulled it from the heat, leaving me with rather soft caramels that were actually really suitable for sweetening coffee.

This was my first attempt at caramels and they were delicious!! You really need a large amount of free time or someone else in the house to watch the kids, answer the phone, and any other sort of thing that may distract you from the pot. I made these for our Christmas cookie tray and everyone loved them! Also I used some of the batch to make caramel brownies a few weeks later...just melted them down with a splash of evaporated milk and poured over brownie batter and baked as directed....delicious!!

I would definately recommend that you line the pan - I only greased mine and really had to work to get the caramels out. Other than that these were very easy to make. My coworkers actually fought over the last one!

YUM-O!!  This is great recipe.  It was really easy.  I let it go a few degrees past the soft ball stage and it came out a great consistancy.  Once they cooled, I dipped them in chocolate.  No one can resist!!

This is the best candy recipe I've made this year. I had to make it twice because my family ate the entire first batch and I wanted to give some away!

I tried this last year and it didn't work, but that was because I was new to a high altitude and didn't know that for every 500 ft above sea level, you subtract a degree. So now I take the mixture off the stove at 238 and they're perfect every time. A real keeper, this one!

These were pretty good. It was my first time making candy (other than fudge)...and things do really get hectic towards the end. I'm not convinced mine set 100% properly as they are pretty chewy, but my bf seems to think they're pretty good.

I can't give this recipe anymore than three stars because I think the temperature is wrong.

The flavor is great but they came out way too hard.  I followed the directions EXACTLY but they were overcooked.  If you want to try this then I suggest listening to the other reviewers and stop cooking at 240.  I'm rating this based on the recipe itself though, not the reviews.

I used honey and corn syrup as What A Dish! suggested.  Accidentally adding the vanilla at the beginning of the process didn't seem to affect the taste negatively.  Thanks Barbara; this is a  great recipe for rich, buttery caramels that rivals ones found at fancy candy shops!

the flavor was fantastic! i think i read too many reviews, so i couldn't really decide how to handle the cook time. after 45 minutes, i stopped cooking even tho the temp had only reached 225. some people said that was enough and i was afraid to turn the heat up on my electric stove for fear of burning it. in my candy inexperience, i figured it would harden as it cooled. it didn't. so my caramel apples weren't very successful HOWEVER, it's the perfect consistency for ice cream. yum! just heat for a few secs in the microwave. will definitely try again to make the candies.

One word... AMAZING.  These caramels are sweet, buttery, chewy and a little bit of heaven in a wrapper.  They were relatively easy to make, just a lot of stirring.  Make them, you will not be dissapointed.

Very good!  Kinda frustrating to make because of how long it took to get the mixture to temperature.  Be sure to use a VERY large pot to keep it from boiling over.

This was the first time I made caramels. These did take along time to make (close to an 1 1/2 hour). They are very soft and I am having to leave the pan in the refrigerator to get them hard enough to cut and wrap. I think I will try cooking the mixture to 275* next time, just because I like a slightly harder caramel. These taste great and my husband says they taste very close to his grandmother's caramels.

Excellent! I will definitely try using the glass pan next time as I found some metal shavings on my caramels! I will also use a 9x13 pan to make them a little chunkier. Very good!

These are delicious!  Yes, they are soft, but that's how they're supposed to be!  I do try to keep them refrigerated in between usage.  They are wonderful to use to make "majeskas"---caramal wrapped around a marshmallow.  Thank you for a great recipe!  My only suggestion is to use a bigger pot!!!

This is a fairly decent "country" style caramel - not too rich and very soft. Personally, I like a firmer, milkier caramel.

I made your caramels for the first time yesterday.  I followed your recipe to the letter and used butter, not margarine and they did not set up properly.  I am very disappointed, especially since this recipe got great reviews.

WOW! I have never made candy before, and these came out perfect.  If they weren't so rich, I would have eaten them all by now.
I made the recipe x 1.5 and had to switch to an 8 qt. stockpot when the caramel started to boil.
I used 2-8x8 pans, and used "real" butter to grease them (the little bit of extra butter that settled on the edges can't even be tasted).
I will definitely make these again and again - thanks so much!

This recipe is easy and makes tasty caramels as promised.  It did take me a long time to wrap them, but they're worth it.

I tried this recipe today and my freinds, family, and neighbors love it!  I will definitley have to make this on a regular basis!  Although it did take about 35 minutes of cooking and stirring to reach the 250 degrees it was well worth the work.  Thanks so much for the recipe :)

I have made other butter cream caramels which must be done in 3 stages.  This was MUCH easier and just as delicious.  Definately a keeper.
