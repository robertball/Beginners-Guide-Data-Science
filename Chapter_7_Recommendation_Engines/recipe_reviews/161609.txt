I did not marinate the filets, instead I simply poured lime juice on them added the veggies and popped them in the oven. I cooked it exactly the same amount of time and at 350, but the filets were a bit dry... Maybe 10-15 minutes less would have worked better? The flavor was nice with the onion, tomatoes and peppers. Light and healthy. I would just check it earlier than leaving it for a full hour.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The baking time was far too long.  It left the fish overcooked and dry.  It also overcooked the vegetables.

Great recipe. Used on Taliapia instead of grouper. The lime taste was a bit overwhelming for this fish. Overall a great recipe for a great dinner. I had it with pineapple rice casserole and the tart taste from the lime was offset by the sweetness of the pineapple. Thanks Kristal

Fantastic! Light, flavorful, and healthy! I marinated the fish (tilapia) in the pan overnight and then just threw the vegetables on top, salted, and baked. Goes perfectly with a side of rice.

Nice flavor. I used tilapia instead of grouper.

I thought this recipe was amazing, first of all this is such an easy recipe!  Secondly, I loved that I didn't have to fry this fish to get a nice flavor.  
The lime does a good job of getting that fishy smell and taste out of the fish.  I would definitely recommend staying with the grouper, or any white fish that flakes in big chunks, as the grouper did a fantastic job staying together after baking.
I did make a few minute adjustments:
I did not marinate and the fish came out superb!  No real reason, I saw the recipe that day and didn't have time to marinate as suggested.
I skipped the bell peppers, didn't have any on hand.  
I didn't use red pepper flakes, afraid it'd be too spicy for the kids, instead I used a regular fish seasoning I've had for forever, with a touch of salt.  
As far as the time, 25 minutes was all I needed!  The fish was moist, flavorful, and easy!  Love this fish!

I used flounder instead, baked it for 20 minutes and it was still a bit cold yet overcooked and the flavor from being marinaded in lime juice was not very good.  I will not make this one again, even if i use grouper as suggested

The flavors were great, but the recipe has issues.  First, like previous reviewers stated, an hour bake time is WAY too long.  15 minutes was perfect.  This recipe would have been much improved if the veggies had been sauteed on their own prior to topping the fish with them.  I used tilapia rather than grouper.

I didn't have red pepper flakes, and I only marinated the fish for 6 hours due to time constraints. But it came out pretty good anyway. No wow factor but it's an easy weeknight meal.
