Great and easy way to use up veggies and tastes great for breakfast or dinner. I've even added leftover grilled corn.  I prefer to roast poblanos on the grill or a gas burner than place in a non reactive bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Once cooled enough to touch peel charred skin off. Cut open and remove seeds.

This was excellent! I also added some frozen corn I had. Didnâ€™t have poblano but turned out great anyway!

Couldn't find poblano peppers at my local grocer so omitted that ingredient.  Otherwise followed recipe; husband liked it, went back for seconds - always a positive sign.
