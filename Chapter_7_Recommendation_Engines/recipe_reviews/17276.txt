This is an easy, yummy, budget-friendly dish, but I'd suggest one or two little changes. I didn't have MSG, or want to use it, so I added one of the ramen flavor packets to the dressing instead. Also, don't waste your money on bagged coleslaw mix- one small cabbage is about the same as two 16 oz bags of mix, and it only takes a few minutes to chop up.

I love how extremely easy this is to make and how nice that the ingredients are pretty limited and ones I usually have on hand in my house. The dressing has a nice flavor to it. I halved the entire recipe but still added one whole can of chicken and two packages of ramen. Next time, I think I might try adding some almonds and/or cherry tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is always a hit at potlucks. Leave out the MSG. It's not healthy and isn't really necessary.

I love the dressing.  The only difference I made was to use red wine vinegar instead of white... and since I don't eat chicken I just ommitted that part.  My husband loved it!  Oh, and I left out the MSG!

This was really tasty & refreshing. I used thin & salty "Chinese" (probably Danish) noodles instead of ramen noodles. I also substituted the coleslaw with napa cabbage & left out the MSG. You can skip the chicken unless you want to eat a balanced meal.

This was very bland. Luckily I had thrown in a little bit of Cayanne pepper. As a meal itself, I wouldnâ€™t recommend. But we did fill taco shells with it, and enjoyed it that way.

I too skipped the MSG and just added a packet of seasoning from the Ramen to the dressing. Because of that I left out the salt. This was good and it is one I'd make again. It goes great with BBQ.

I just made this recipe, 2 16oz. pkgs. of coleslaw is too much, only used 1 bag, flavor not good, will not make again...
