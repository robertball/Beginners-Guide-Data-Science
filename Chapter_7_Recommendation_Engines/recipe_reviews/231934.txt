This marinade was perfect for our steaks. Adds just the right amount of flavor.

My family thought this added a nice flavor to the steak.  I don't usually eat red meat but had a few bites to try it. The steak was very moist and tender. I didn't have time to marinate for 24 hours but did marinate it for 8 hours.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I liked it but didn't love it.  The whole family ate it though.  Would prefer to try a different marinade on steaks next time.

Always wanted to do a Coca-Cola steak recipe. Only had 3.5 hours to marinate so I added some chopped onions to help further tenderize the meat. Didn't have garlic cloves but ironically I did have powdered garlic so I used that; turned out alright but wished I had the actual garlic. I'm definitely going to make this again but will have it marinate overnight.

I didn't have the EXACT ingredients, so I improvised. I used the Pepsi and soy sauce, used whole grain mustard, upped the garlic to about 6 cloves and didn't have prepared horseradish but I did have fresh, so I grated about  an inch-and-a-half.

I didn't have 24 hours, but I let them marinate for about 5 hours. Cooked them on a stove top grill and made sure to let them sit, tented, for about 5-6 minutes.

Turned out pretty tasty. Even my roommate, who hates it when I marinate meat, said it was pretty good.

Used this as a marinade for kebobs, marinated for 24 hours. The sirloin was tender and had a great flavour.
