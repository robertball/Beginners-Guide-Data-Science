Very good but needs a little something extra.  I made it with veggie sausage which might have made the dish a little dry.  The second time around I made it with extra spices, a little more pumpkin and veggies only and it was very good.  I will definately be adding this to my family's recipe repertoire!

Easy!  Delicious!!! This is a great special-day-breakfast recipe.  You can prepare it up to 24 hours in advance and then toss it in the oven in the morning.  Perfect for overnight guests or holiday mornings when you won't want to have to clean up a lot of prep dishes after breakfast.  Try it!

Very easy to make and quite tasty. Nice to have something a little different from the usual egg, sausage, cheese, bread, and dry mustard mix that is replicated 20 times at least on this site.

This was a big hit at a family holiday brunch and easy to make. I used Turkey sausage and it probably could have used a bit more spice. Definitely will make it again!

This makes a nice change from the usual brunch casseroles.

I took this dish to a "pumpkin lunch" where everyone was supposed to bring something made with pumpkin.  I got there a little late, but still before we ate, and as I placed it on the serving table, everyone's eyes lit up and I heard "WOW!"  It was a hit!  Instead of Italian sausage, I used bulk sausage and added Italian seasoning and fennel seed.  It needed to bake much longer than 30 minutes, though, which was why I was late for the lunch!  What an awesome recipe.  I am going to make it for my out-of-town family when they come for Christmas.---I recently made this recipe again, except I used maple sausage instead of Italian, and then seasoned it with allspice.  YUM.

Really good flavor,  Took alot of time to prepare. A little to much bread for me.

FABULOUS RECIPE! Took this dish to a brunch and everyone asked for the recipe. I did tweak it a little, though, by increasing the veggies and adding Cayenne pepper and Hot Chili Sauce (Asian) for a little kick.

Great, unusual combination of ingredients for a company brunch. Good leftovers for dinner, too! Didn't taste like pumpkin at all, but I'm sure it gave it the extra moistness. Looked pretty, as the pumpkin makes the dish a nice orange-brown color. 
I made the "dry" part the night before, then added the milk, eggs, pumpkin, etc. in the morning, and baked for about 40 minutes. The ratio of milk to eggs to bread seemed to be very forgiving, as I used a lot more bread than it called for, and it was still bery moist. Might be good with some porcini mushrooms? Enjoy!

I was so hopeful for this recipe, as I'm known in my family for trying daring recipes.  I took it to Thanksgiving @ Grandma's for breakfast...and it didn't really get commented on.  It took waaaaaay longer to cook than noted.  Probably 2/3 longer.  Bread still somewhat mushy.  Not an impressive recipe.  Interesting concept, though.
