Really tasty grilled asparagus!!! Family loved it, especially my almost 6 yr old who kept going back for more! I used Kraft Tuscan House Italian dressing and marinated my spears for a few hours. Just delicious! Thanks Celeste!!!

Fantastic! I think I was concerned it would just taste like asparagus with Italian dressing, but it didn't at all! Is it the magic of the grill or the lemon pepper? Who cares?! It's delicious!

Have grilled asparagus for years especially when in season.  After grilling drizzle a balsamic reduction over all. It looks great and adds a wee bit of sweetness.

Great flavour with the addition of the lemon pepper along with ground pepper and salt.  The asparagus is so nice here this time of year and this recipe was perfect with our grilled chicken.  Thanks Celeste..we'll make this again…soon.

this came out really nice.. i used a light italian dressing so i added a little over a tablespoon of olive oil and bumped the lemon pepper up to 1 full teaspoon.. grilled these in a cast iron skillet.. threw some wood chips in with the charcoal for a hint of smoke.. we both enjoyed this.. ty for the recipe

Yummy Grilled Asparagus Haiku: "Timing off for us. Our asparagus were hard, after 5 minutes." Well, maybe our asparagus were on the thicker side, and I should've checked them b4 pulling them from the grill and then serving them, only to find that they were still a little too on the al dente side. (I'd take a crunchier veggie over a squishy, over-done one, so I wasn't too disappointed!) Taste was good, and the recipe deserves thumbs-up for crazy-easy prep.

No changes to this recipe. Even my kids who don't normally like asparagus liked this recipe. It's a keeper! BTW for all who didn't actually read the recipe, it's 3-5 minutes PER SIDE!!!! I did total cooking time of 9.5 minutes and it turned out great.

03.20.17 ~ Loved the flavor of this asparagus.  I had to marinate it with my own Italian dressing as I couldn't find the suggested one.  It was delicious and it went well with pierogies, smoked sausage and onions and topped with fresh diced tomatoes.  I have made this recipe several times, always with great success.

These were yummy.   I didn't have lemon pepper so I just used salt and pepper.   My stalls were pretty thick so I had to grill for 8 minutes or so. Perfect!!

PERFECT seasoning recipe for one my favorite veggies! I used my indoor/outdoor Foreman Grill & they turned out so flavorful with a great crunch! A simply tasty seasoning combo that I highly recommend!
