I accidentally bought Mustard Greens instead of Kale (I thought they looked rather light in color).  I've never had M.G.  They are a bit spicy raw, so I hunted for a recipe to cook them with the hopes that they would taste good.  This recipe caught my eye.  Simple and surprisingly delicious.  I mixed in a little Aji Nori Furikake (seasoned green seaweed and sesame seeds).  I will mix this with rice and have for dinner tomorrow.  I did not have Sake, so I used a little White Wine Vinegar.

The spiciness of raw mustard greens reminds me of wasabi, so I thought this would be intresting to try with the Asian twist. The spiciness mellows to almost nothing. The greens got to bitter for me. I love kale and thought this would be a nice change. I still like kale better and maybe will try this recipe with kale. I paired it with some edamame rice for a nice meatless meal.

I'm trying to expand my "like" list of vegetables beyond spinach, pickles, and green beans. This was a success! If you need more kick, add more garlic - I added an extra teaspoon. I will use this recipe again with mustard greens, but I think it would also be great with kale, collards, and other greens. Yum!

I was searching for a new recipe for greens and we loved this, and our company did too.  There were no leftovers.  The only thing I did differently, is after I washed and chopped the greens I put them in a large bowl; then I donned a pair of disposable gloves (to prevent my hands from turning green) and massaged the greens for 1-5 minutes and then rinsed them.  I feel this helped make the greens less bitter. This is one of my favorite recipes now!

Mirin isn't vinegar but sweetened rice wine. We just had standard rice vinegar in the pantry and used that. Tasted fine: one of the two vegetable non-enthusiasts in the household had seconds.  I'll probably try ginger next time around.

If you post any more recipes, trepto, I'd like to know. :)

The very best recipe for greens I've ever tried.  I made black mustard greens from our farmer's market as a side dish tonight with a shrimp fried rice main. This recipe is wonderful. I would note, though, that Mirin is sweetened rice wine, not rice wine vinegar. I did use it (rather than rice vinegar) and we liked the mellow smoothness it added. Using regular rice wine vinegar would result is something more tart.

Our supermarket didn't have mustard greens, so I made this with collards, instead.  Fantastic!

Really liked this! This had a flavor combination that was really tangy and delicious. I made it nearly exactly according to the directions, but didn't have sake on hand, so I omitted that step. Afterwards, I mixed in leftover steak that I cubed and some rice. I will definitely make again.

Wow! So tasty! Easy! Quick! Fabulous.  I ATE THE WHOLE FIRST BATCH ALL BY MYSELF IN ONE SITTING... even though I kept trying to convince myself to save half for later (and even though it was a little bitter BECAUSE I had chopped the greens too coarsely..... *blush*...  THE SECOND TIME, I CHOPPED THE GREENS INTO THINNER STRIPS, and shared it with my family.  That time, I served it with Korean Beef Bowl instead of by itself.  WE FINISHED THIS DISH EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T FINISH THE BEEF!!!  When combined with Korean Beef Bowl, it's very quick, easy, and one of our TOP TEN FAVORITE MEALS.... But ?with mustard greens?  go figure!  Thanks so much for sharing, Trepto!

This was really good. I made it as described less the sesame seeds and the kirin because I didn't have it. But despite that, very good. Comes together quickly and tastes great.

This was actually really good. My M-greens were starting to bolt, so I cut some back and decided to try something new. This dish was a Home run! I was a little worried as I was making it, but in the end it turned out just perfect.

I'm usually not a fan of mustard greens because of the bitterness, but this is how I always fix them now.  Great recipe!  My 1 year-old really likes them too!

This a great recipe.  I used wild mustard from the nearby orange groves so it was fairly hot.  Doubling the sugar helped.  This recipe would probably be awesome with mild mustard greens.

My husband who loves all vegetables enjoyed this recipe.  I'm a veggie hater trying to convert to veggies lover.  This was too slimy for me.  I thought the beans might help it, but no.

Horrible. So bitter we couldn’t eat it. 
Probably need to parboil the greens and drain before sautéing.

I threw some random seeds in my greenhouse, a strip on the floor where I grow greens and radishes, and I had a big bunch of mustard greens. Found this recipe, made it - IT'S FANTASTIC! I can maybe make one more batch from my greenhouse, and then I will be off to the grocery store to get more mustard greens.

This was delicious! I de-stemmed and sliced the mustard greens into thin noodles before sautéing, and at the very end of cooking I added 2 sheets of nori, ripped into strips. The nori soaked up the remaining liquid perfectly! Such a balance of umami with a hint of sweet. Zero mustard bite remained. Next time I want to make this and add crispy-grilled broccoli, served alongside some cauliflower fried “rice”. I’m already excited to do that. Maybe tomorrow for dinner, lol. Thanks for the recipe!

I made it according to the recipe, but added tofu to make it a meal instead of a side dish. It was very good. Next time I think I'd lower the soy sauce by a tsp. Will make again.

Left 4 stars because even though it didnt turn out quite 5 star tasty, that was due to my ineptitude in the kitchen and just a small mistake in the recipe author's ingredient description list. I didnt dry my greens well enough after rinsing so i was left with a way soggier (and for an already supposed to be wilted and soggy dish, i mean REALLY soggy) plate of greens than i intended. I also added a bit of white vinegar as i was out of rice wine vinegar but...as it turns out i think i wasnt supposed to add vinegar at all after re reading this recipe. I still added mirin which was good because i love just about anything if it has mirin as an ingredient.  Next time i will add chilli flakes as the chili sesame oil didnt seem to make it as spicy as it has made stuff in the past.  Thanks for the interesting recipe!

This is great, but the mustard greens really shrink down to nothing. Will use more next time. Very good.
