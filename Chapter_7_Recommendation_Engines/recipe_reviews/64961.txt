I used a homemade dry ranch dressing mix and sliced baby bella mushrooms. I added a splash of dry white wine as they were sauteing, not much just a splash. These are to die for. Even the kids loved them.

I like the idea of this recipe. As a low fat alternative, I used 1 T butter, and 1/8 cup beef stock to 1/2 lb sliced mushrooms. I have a jar of Penzey's buttermilk ranch dressing milk and I put a few shakes in while sauteeing. Great Idea Thanks.

I used only half the butter and half the ranch mix, and they were still the best mushrooms ever!

I modified a little and the final product was AMAZING.  I used sliced small white button mushrooms over very low heat and butter (2 heavy Tbsp) like the recipe called for.  Then I added regular ranch dressing, 2 Tbsp and stirred for about 20 mins.  I added in just a dash of soy sauce for extra bite and stirred another 10 mins or so or longer.  My boyfriend LOVED them.

I thought these turned out really good! I halved the recipe b/c I only had 1/2 pound of mushrooms. I melted the butter and added the mushrooms to begin to cook, then I sprinkled the ranch mix over and sauteed until tender. I think the time may be a little off in the recipe though, b/c it did not take 30 min. to cook maybe more like 15. Could be b/c I halved the recipe.Anyways, they went great w/ our grilled steaks and I would make these again.

Amazing! Best mushrooms my guests and I have ever had!  I used olive oil, instead of butter, to be a little more health conscious, and added about 1/2 cup of white wine just to make more of a sauce to put over the steaks.  We were all fighting over who would get seconds!  I can't stop thinking about them!!! Yum!

These are very tasty!  They go great as a side to almost anything.  Do NOT get too heavy-handed with the ranch dressing powder though, as it is very pungent..

Yum!  Husband thought they were great!  I needed to use up a lot of near expiration mushrooms so I cooked and froze them.

As its written it is very tasty but waaaaay too much butter.  I end up using 2tbsp butter and 2tbsp olive oil and I add the ranch dressing powder right at the end.  When I use less butter or oil than this the texture isnt right and its too dry.  The ranch powder needs a minimum amount of oil to have the right texture otherwise it clumps together.  It also takes maybe 15-20 minutes to cook (cook it until you no longer smell 'mushroom').  30 minutes will have you charring your mushrooms.  But made as I described its fantastic.  I use these to top steaks, burgers, and chicken, other times its just a side dish.  I probably make this every other week now and have been doing so for 6 months.  I will definately be making this for the rest of my life.

I use the buttermilk dry ranch pkg most of the time, not realizing it is smaller than a regular ranch pkg. That could make a difference in the saltiness.

Cleaning out the fridge, I used 1/2 portabellas and 1/2 button mushrooms.   Oh my goodness!   They are as good as they are easy to make.    Hubby took one bite of his dinner and moaned in delight....then said, "guess what I tried first.....the mushrooms!"   Thanks for sharing!

Used portabellas and no way was I going to use an entire 1/2 stick of butter.  I used 3 TB of unsalted butter and a drizzle of EVOO and let the 'shrooms sweat a few minutes in the pan.  I then added about 1/2 of the package of dry ranch and I thought they were just right.  Quite tasty and this method has much less fat and sodium.

It was good, but instead of doing just portabellas, i also did regular mushrooms and shutokey,(the real expensive kind at the fancy grocery stores).

this was great and so easy. Next time I will use less butter (probably about 2/3). To me it was a bit too much butter.

If this was good at all it’s because mushrooms…are good.  The ranch seasoning was not discernible.  The saltiness of that seasoning on the other hand, was.

This was a great recipe. I did the same amounts given, but was a little salty with our steaks and mashed potatos. So I halved the butter and ranch and it came out perfect. Not overpowering but not bland, a perfect little extra to your meal. Thanks for this simple recipe!

Very very good!  I halved the butter & ranch mix and it turned out perfect.  I served the mushrooms w/ grilled steak that had been seasoned.  Next time I won't season the steak  --  just use the mushrooms for flavor!

Absolutely AWESOME mushroom recipe! I had purchased a .40 ounce package of Buttermilk ranch(it's all the store had) and it was fanstatic. I can't thank Perri enough because the results from my hubby, telling me I way out did myself with serving this over a couple grilled seasoned pork loin steaks...honestly, I barely out did myself at all...so let's just let him think I did ;-) Will totally be on my menu a lot with steaks. Ty you girlie!

Definitely the best mushrooms I've had!  They are restaurant quality and yet, so easy to make.  The oly problem I had with the recipe was keeping both me and my husband out of the pan until they were done! :-)  If I could give it more stars, I WOULD! Thanks, Perri P. for this recipe :-)

Yum!  These were so good!  They had so much flavor!  I used baby portobello mushrooms, so, they had a nice bite.  We ate with steaks, but, they would be fantastic on top of a baked potato also!  Thanks for the recipe, Perri!

These mushrooms are very tasty. I used about 1/3 package of the dip mix, as that's what I had on hand. And I did saute for about 30 min -- they'll be done sooner if you're in a hurry, but cooking them longer allows the sauce to reduce and intensify the flavors. I made this with a mix of white, baby bellas, and shitake mushrooms.

I made this today as a side dish with a pork roast, mashed potatoes and gravy, and sugar snap peas with carrots.  They were delicious.  Even my picky 6 year old grandson loved them.  The only thing I did different was use half of the ranch dressing mix.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this and loved it!
The next time I went to make mushrooms I didn't have the ranch dressing mix, so I used Clubhouse Creamy Pasta Salad mix. It was even better!

This recipe is simple and delicious!!  The only thing I changed was I increased the amount of mushrooms and used 24 oz. of baby bellas for one pack of dry dressing mix.  It paired really well with the Schweinbraten Roast Pork recipe that I found on this site.  Hubby loved it all!!

Easy and delicious. Other than cleaning and slicing the mushrooms, this is a quick side dish. Next time I will be buying a large pack (or two) of sliced mushrooms from Sam's Club. Thanks for the recipe! We really enjoyed this!

I don't like mushrooms but made these to go on top of my hubbys steak and he loved them.  I had to cut the recipe in half and instead of measuring out the ranch mix I just sprinkled some over the butter close to what I thought half would be.  Came out great.

I made the recipe exactly as written and my husband thought they were FANTASTIC!!!  My sister thought they were FANTASTIC!!!!  I thought they were a bit too salty.  The 3rd time I made this recipe I used unsalted clarified butter and thought it could still use less salt.  The next time I make it (and I will be making it again and again), I'll try using only half of the package of dry mix.

Prepared them exactly as specified. I only used 8 ozs of mushrooms because that’s all I had, but everything else was the same. These were awesome. Also, saw that several said they were salty. I noticed there were two different dry ranch mixes. One did have more salt than the other.

Way too much butter! I halved the butter and I felt it was still too much.  Instead of Ranch mix, I just used salt and pepper. I turned the heat up to cook the mushrooms, as they were not browning. I would make it again, but with half of the butter I used this time.

Tried this recipe as is and found it way too salty.  It was almost inedible. Too save it some what I added sour cream and milk. I don't think I'll be making this one again.

This was delicious.  I used portabella mushrooms and would recommend (1) only 1/3 cup of butter and (2) unsalted butter. Terrific though with the portabella mushrooms in particular as they are so meaty, the dish then tastes kind of like savoring a (cleaner-tasting, vegetarian-ish) beef stew.  I might add carrots next time too, therefore!  ;-)  My burner was set to 3 on a 1-to-8 scale.

OH MY GOSH! Best saute mushrooms ever! I fixed it just like the recipe said, the only thing I did different, is I turned the heat up at the end and let them crisp a little.  I served it over shredded chicken.It will be in my recipe book and I will pass it along to my family. The word Fantastic will be  written on my recipe page!

Very good. I used two tablespoons of butter and a splash of olive oil. I was afraid to use all of the ranch dressing mix so I only used 3/4s but the whole pack would have been fine. I did cover to steam a bit to get it on the table on time. I did use crimina Bella mushrooms and they were great. Next time I will add wine or little more liquid for a bit more sauce because the sauce was delish.  A real keeper!  Note!  They were so good that 10 oz of mushrooms only served two.

This is my first review of a recipe here on Allrecipes.  This is sooooo good I HAD TO tell everyone that will listen.  I am a huge fan of mushrooms and this recipe is perfect for sauteed mushrooms.  My wife wants me to figure out to make this into a soup now!!  Stay tuned kids.  My changes - half the butter and half the dry ranch seasonings.  Doesn't matter, I'll bet it was fantastic at full strength... I just prefer a more fresh style of cooking and that much butter and ranch I thought may overwhelm our tastes, but in fairness to the author I didn't go that far.  Bon appetit.

Three stars because I like the idea, but they were inedible when made as written.  The full packet of ranch mix is just too much.  When made with half the seasoning, they make a decent side dish.

Since I already had mushrooms, I luckily found this recipe to try and it was super simple!  I only had a half pound of mushrooms so I used about 3 Tbs of butter and probably a quarter of the package of Ranch dressing which turned out great!  I'll be making it again!

The dressing definitely over powered the mushrooms and made them salty to the point that we couldn't even finish the rest of the mushrooms. I will go back to just using salt and pepper or maybe just using half a pack of dressing mix.

Amazing flavor. I was just cooking these for myself as my kids don't like mushrooms. I used Mongolian fire oil and a touch of evoo. Dropped in two large white button mushrooms and lightly turned them. Then sprinkled the buttermilk seasoning on. Draped them over a crab cake. They were delicious.

This recipe was delicious! I did modify it as per some other reviews...I used the butter it called for but didn't have dry ranch so I used 2 tablespoons of regular ranch dressing and a splash of soy sauce...the only thing is I only cooked it for about 15-20 min I thought 30 min was too long. Will definitely make again!

I love mushrooms, so I buy them but then I don't know what to do with them. I looked at this recipe and laughed because I bought a dry ranch packet a long time ago and wasn't sure where it was. Luckily I found it! Very good way to use 'shrooms! Yummy!

I made this and did what the othe reviews said, I used the white wine, with the dry pkg. ranch dressing was very good, but I have sauteed mushrooms before and wanted to see if this recipe was better than the one I have made, only difference was I added some chopped onion and a little garlic, but I didn't put the wine in or the dry salad dressing, and they were good also, tasted pretty much the same, thanks for this recipe, always like to try something different.

Pretty good - but do not use the whole pkg. of ranch dressing mix.  I used about half, and still thought it was a bit too salty.  I threw in sliced onions as well, and added white wine near the end.

I cooked the mushrooms as a compliment to a rib-eye steak. I cooked 1/2 lbs of mushrooms, 1/4 cup of butter and 1/3 pkg of ranch dressing mix. I thought the dressing overpowered the taste of the mushrooms. This is the first time that I was disappointed in a recipe from this site. It was too easy for me mess up the ingredients. Anyway, I plan to go back to simple sauteed mushrooms in butter next time.
