I submitted this recipe originally. It was supposed to be 1 1/2 teaspoons not tablespoons.

My husband and I made this for dinner together last night.  We first sauteed a half an onion, than we browned 1 lb of beef seasoned per the recipe.  (Ginger amount should say teaspoons) We than added the soy and honey mixture and the green beans.  We noticed that since we added more meat there wasn't enough liquid to simmer, so we added about another 2 tbsp of soy sauce and another tbsp of honey.  Since we adjusted these amounts, I added a few more pinches of ginger and pepper.  We served it over white rice and we absolutely loved it.  This has the perfect amount of spice, and we were thinking of other ways to make it again.  We both decided next time to try it with shredded carrots and snow peas.  Thank you so much for this recipe, we really enjoyed it and are both looking forward to the leftovers for lunch!

Very good!! The only thing I would mention is to make sure your fresh green beans are VERY FRESH.  If they are old, they don't get tender enough when cooked like this. The whole family loved it, even the toddler.  Quick and delish!

What a great idea! Love this recipe AND this website. I find that so often I am just lost for meal ideas and get tired of the things which DO occur to me. This time I typed in ground beef and green beans and this recipe came up. The recipe submitter will probably be appalled to read that I made it, plunked it in a cassarole dish, topped it with tater tots , and baked it for 20 minutes. :+) But my kids LOVED it. Thanks.

I didn't really care for this.  It was nothing special and was a little too spicy for us. We will not be having it again.

I added some salsa and corn, and decreased the soy sauce, and it turned out delicious.

I changed this recipe a lot. I made it as a main dish. First I sautéed 1/2 onion in a little oil then set aside in a small bowl. I browned 1 lb of ground beef, drained it then added ginger, garlic & 1/2 t black pepper (1t, would leave your mouth on fire) & no onion powder. Then I added 4 T. soy sauce & 3 T. honey. I stirred in frozen (thawed) green beans and the reserved onion & simmered for about 5 mins. I did not thicken since there was nothing to thicken. I served it over white rice. My husband said it needed more sauce, since there wasn’t any to soak up the rice & ate it but didn’t rave. Next time I make this I’m going to make the following changes. Increase the soy sauce to 1/3 C. & the honey to 1/4C and maybe add some sherry. I’m also going to add 1/4 C shredded carrots when I add the green beans. Thanks

I don't know if I did something wrong but this came out horrible--it was super dry and I tried to add water to help steam but it just didn't work out.

This is very tasty!  I thought that the honey would throw the falvors out of whack but it was very complimentary with the spicy ingredients.  I increased the garlic (as usual).  This could also be made with ground turkey and not be too dry or lack flavor.  We served it with white rice.  Very good.

uhmmmm,this was just so-so.  You might want to boil your fresh green beans in some chicken broth first, and then add to the meat mixture.  It's a good recipe to use when you want something different than meatloaf or burgers for ground beef.

This was very easy and very good.  My husband and I really enjoyed this.  As suggested I used 1 lb. of ground beef and made this our main course.  Once my green beans were in I cooked it 10 minutes (at 7 minutes the beans were still a little on the crunchy side still).  I only needed the amount of flour and water called for in the recipe, and I used the 96% lean ground beef.  I also added a fresh onion instead of onion powder as suggested by other reviewers -- definitely a good thing and worth doing.  My husband kept commenting on how sweet the onion got.  I served it with steamed white rice.  My husband kept adding spicy Chinese chili oil, and I tried it but actually preferred the recipe as is (and I adore spicy food).  If you're looking for something quick and easy, this is the recipe.  Next time we may add some bamboo shoots and/or water chestnuts.  It might even be good with ground pork instead of ground beef.  I think that this will become a regular dish around our house since it's so quick and so easy.

Recipe is incomplete at best.  Glad I read the reviews so I knew to REDUCE the ginger to 1 1/2 TEASPOONS instead of tablespoons.  THAT would have been a disaster.  Well, I added an onion, but didn't use ramen noodles (served over rice).  I also made numerous other changes that my family expects (more veggies, less black pepper, added thai pepper, smidge of lime juice), so can only give 3-star rating.

This recipe was great!  The picture kind of made it not look so appetizing so it took me a while to try it.  I ordinarily don't like green beans, but this was really good and my entire family liked it and I have picky eaters too.

I see this as a great starting point for many other recipes. I also had no use for the flour and water combo at the end, but that is because I used a pound of beef. I left everything else the same. The flavor of the meat is excellent - I will be using it in other recipes (Sloppy Joe type sandwiches, stir-fried with fresh Chow Mein noodles, etc).

Instead of using ground beef I used No Name Steaks and sliced them thin.  I did not use as much ginger as was listed, but we thought the taste was still very good.  I too added a little water because it was a little thick.  Next time I make this, I think I'll add some sliced onions with the beef to cook.  I used my garden beans I had frozen.  I will definitely make it again.

This wa a good dinner to serve up when I was in a rush. I served it with oriental noodles and it filled a gap, good for those nights when you need something filling and fast.

This was tasty, though I don't think it needed all that flour and water to thicken.  I would have preferred it 'saucier'.  I also added sauteed onions to the mix.

I had higher hopes for this recipe. Hubby ate it, but the next morning he said "Don't make that again." I have to say... I barely ate three bites myself.     But on a positive note, it was great to find a ground beef recipe for what I had in the house; something besides burgers or meatloaf! Thanks for that, but everyone has different tastes, and I don't think we'll be trying this again.

This one is definitely a keeper for our household.  It was very flavorful and tasted really good over rice.  I used fresh green beans, grated fresh ginger and about a pound of ground beef.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I thought the salty soy sauce and sweet honey combine well for a really easy stir fry sauce.   The first time I made this I used more veggies and mixed cooked Ramen noodles into the skillet.  The second time I made it with just beef and green beans and served it over rice.  Loved it both ways.

The author left a note saying it (I think "it" is the ginger, although the author didn't specify) was supposed to be 1.5 tsp not tbs.  I'm glad I caught that, but the flavor was still too much!  WAY too much pepper; it overpowered the dish.  I don't think I'll make this again unless the seasonings are redone and maybe some extras (onions, waterchestnuts, etc.) are thrown in.

My son and I liked these green beans. My hubby doesn't like ginger, so he,  of course, didn't. I made it as a side dish. Didn't use the flour and water at the end, it didn't need it.

Hubby made this tonight. It was great. My folks are here so we doubled the recipe. We used tri-tip instead of ground beef and hubby added onion, red bell pepper and cabbage (yum).

My husband loved this recipe, it was FAST and easy to make and very filling.  I served it over white rice and doubled the amount of ground beef.  I was thinking next time to add sliced almonds or some orange zest for an oriental kick.

My husband and I both loved it! It is spicy and somewhat hot from the ginger and pepper, but very tasty. I used snap peas instead of green beans and served it over white rice.

Added some cayenne pepper and used brown sugar.  Didn't have fresh green beans so I used canned.  Will be making this again!

I thought this was just okay, so I'll give it a 3-star rating. Frankly, I was a little disappointed - the ingredient list made it sound interesting and a bit unusual, but it actually turned out to be slightly weird, for lack of a better word. I made it exactly as written, using 93% lean ground beef, and 1.5 teaspoons, instead of 1.5 tablespoons, of ground ginger (I happened to see the review purportedly from the recipe submitter, which mentioned this mistake). Maybe the taste was due to the dried spices burning a little? Not that I know they did, but the mixture in step 1 was not very wet.  I probably won't try this again, sorry.

This was a super easy, super fast DELICIOUS dinner. My hubby ate it up and I loved the sweet tangy sauce. It would also be good using chunks of chicken rather than the beef. I served it with rice and added mushrooms.

After reading the review where the reviewer tried turkey in this recipe, I was a little leery about trying it since that's all I had, along with canned green beans.  So I decided when it came time to add the soy sauce and honey, I added the soy first and let the turkey cook in that for a couple of minutes then added the honey, etc., and it seems to have worked. :9  Might be a little salty for some folks, tho.  I did forget the flour and water step, but I like it just the same.  I think I'll make some noodles to go under it next time, too.

I really liked this recipe- it gives me something to do with ground beef other than hamburgers and meatballs! It was better before I added the flour & water thickener, when the meat was crumbly, so next time I will leave that off. Also, my husband and I liked the level of spices, but the kids said it was too spicy. (They complained, but they ate it!) If you have sensitive palates in your family, cut down on the spices.

Thought this was very good.  Did add onions in lieu of the onion powder.  Thanks for the recipe, hubby gets a little tired of meatloaf and casserole.

I tweaked this recipe a bit, using leftover beef roast cut into strips instead of ground beef...I added a  half cup of brown gravy to the sauce combo instead of the flour and water...and lemon zest on the finished product.  It was awesome! Great Asian flavor with a twist. It would have been great over rice as well....but we loved it right out of the pan.

GREAT FLAVOR! I reduced the amount of ginger to 1 1/2 teaspoons (per a review I read) and I used canned green beans. Usually, with canned green beans I fry a strip of bacon or use cubed ham for flavor. After preparing my green beans I added them to the recipe and it was great. Served over white rice. I would probably add some curry for color the next time I make this.

I used 1 lb of beef, and drained after cooking, then added spices and other ingredients. I used about 1 lb fresh grean beans... I added some worcestershire sauce since I didn't have enough soy sauce to double the recipe (since I was using twice the reccomended amount of meat). It was a wonderful flavor over all, and very easy to play with and adjust to your taste... I thought the beans were too crunchy, for my taste (my husband really liked them that way). And I also added about 1 cup of water with the flour, as there was no juice to thicken at the end! I served over rice. I also decreased the pepper to just a couple shakes, it still had a pretty strong peppery flavor.

Delicious! I made a few minor changes. I decreased the amount of ground beef and added cooked soybeans. I also added some chopped onions because I didn't have any onion powder and used frozen green beans instead of fresh.

We LOVE this! It's one of the few ways I can get my picky toddler to eat green beans and my husband says this is his favorite meal. I slightly modified this by adding 1 pd. beef but I left everything else alone and it still tastes great.

This is ok - with a lot of extras tossed in. The flavors were bland and overall, it is not visually appealing. I love to try new things and enjoy ethnic foods of all types but won't make this again and cannot recommend it.

Like the others, I sauteed half an onion with the beef. I also threw in some mushrooms with the beans.  I thought it was excellent! We ate it for dinner with a wheat rolls.  I would defenitely make this again.

I made this for dinner. Instead of onion powder, I sliced and sauted an onion. I only used 1 tablespoon of flour. I parboiled the green beans to soften them up before adding them to the ground beef.  It was a hit at my house.  It's a KEEPER!

This was surprisingly good. My whole family loved it (except my 13 year old, who finds just about everything "too spicy"). The ginger gives it a wonderful flavor. I used frozen whole green beans, and it came out great. I don't know if adding the flour is necessary--it makes the dish congeal a bit better, but it makes it somewhat stickier, too. Next time I might try omitting the flour. I will DEFINITELY make it again, though. So easy, and so good!! Thanks!

This had a good but strong flavor.  I added more meat, green beans, and doubled the soy sauce and honey.  I kept all of the spice ingredients the same excpet the ginger, I only used 1 Tb.

I didn't really like this recipe too much.  I'm not sure why.  It was too gingery for my taste, and as it turns out I'm not a fan of green beans cooked this way.  I substituted beef cubes for ground beef.  Maybe that was my mistake, because I didnt alter the amount of spices I put in.  May suit your tastebuds better than it did mine.

Green beans isn't one of my favorite vegies but these were pretty darn good.  My wife liked these a lot. I did use real onions and garlic, otherwise I made this as written.

This was good. I substituted celery and green peppers for the green beans since I was out of green beans at the time. That worked well. I also added some seseme seeds after reading the other reviews. The ginger definately adds a big kick if you use all that the recipe calls for.

The flavor was great!...I mixed in thin egg noodles and it went excellent..next time I would add either sesame seeds or almonds for texture.  However, my husband was looking for something additional from this meal...it was too one-dimensional...

This was great. I enjoyed the oriental flavor and plan to add some toasted sesame seeds next time. I added more ground beef and used fresh green beans but my husband came home an hour late. Needless to say the beans looked like overcooked can beans. I'm sure this will be even better when served on time. I added a little water too. What is there to thicken? I've already had requests for this recipe.

tasted good but could use some improvement.  I used slightly more (3/4 lbs) ground beef, and it was barely enough.  Fresh onions would have been nice, too, and the 5 tbs of honey and soysauce did not generate enough liquid to "thicken" anything in the end.  The dish came out moist enough, but if you serve it over rice, I recommend adding some broth or water to make it saucier.

Unfortunately I was the only one who enjoyed this!  I thought my husband would really love it, but apparently not.  After reading some of the reviews I decided to add liquid and cut way back on the pepper and ginger.  Also I doubled the recipe to use a whole pound of ground beef...husband really likes meat!  I used fresh garlic and onions, didn't really measure them, just threw a bunch in.  I served it over white rice and thought the meal was easy to put together and didn't call for a bunch of ingredients I didn't already have on-hand.  But if I'm the only one who will eat it, that's a big disadvantage!  Thanks anyway though.

I enjoyed the basic flavor, but also had to add a lot of extra liquid to get the right consistency. I used half water and half cooking sherry. My main problem with the dish was that I thought it was too sweet. If I make it again, I will cut down on the honey or use a small amount of brown sugar. We served it over Jasmine rice.

I didn't care for this.  I think I may have added too much ginger, it overpowered the dish.  Also, it seemed in need of some water or something to keep it from sticking together.  I might try it again with some substitutions, or making it into a rice casserole.  But that would be a different dish all together then!

Great jump start recipe. I added a whole medium onion, 1 cup julienned carrots and 1 pound ground beef. Didn’t have honey, used 1/8 cup of brown sugar. Cooked green beans in chicken broth, then added them to the dish. I used freeze dried garlic and ginger. Really awesome. Going in the faves list

This dish has a very Asian flair. I tossed mine with some soba noodles! But I imagine it would be just as delicious over rice.

I really liked it! I used frozen (thawed) green beans and corn and a full pound of ground turkey. I cooked about 4oz of whole wheat thin spaghetti and added it at the end. Didn't have a need to add water or flour. Fantastic! My 9 yr old wants seconds every time I make it.

I made this for supper but didn’t have fresh green beans.  I made it with canned green beans and fresh asparagus tips.  I also used fresh minced garlic & ginger and sautéed onions when browning the beef.  I added about a 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes My husband is usually pretty picky and he had seconds.  Next time I will either use fresh green beans or only asparagus but not both.

I used all the required ingredients but decided not to thicken the sauce with the flour and water as the recipe suggest. Instead, I decided to add more soy sauce and honey for a sweeter taste. This was good but not a favorite. Maybe I will try again with a different meat such as steak or beef strips.

going into making this recipe i knew i was going to have to make quite a few changes but i was up for the challenge.. i steamed the green beans (half the amount) in a little bit of water in the pan a few minutes before starting.. added some veggie oil, one chopped onion, and the green beans back into the pan.. sauteing until the onions were translucent.. added the garlic and cooked until fragrant.. then added the ground *turkey* (double the amount), ginger (1.5 tsp, not 1.5 T), black pepper, soy sauce (1.5 T more), and honey (half the amount).. and left out the flour/water mixture all together.. this was a very humble start for what i had intended for dinner, but exactly what i had envisioned once done.. glad i tried this

It's a good change from the usual stir-fry. Served it on top of jasmine rice instead of noodles. I also added 3 tablespoons water with the soy sauce and honey mixture to better cook the green beans (after reading comments that the beans don't get tender enough). It did take me around 10 minutes to cook the beans on simmer. An alternative is to omit the extra water but to steam/cook the beans separately as suggested by one of the posters. This way the beans keep their bright green color while being tender.

This was really good and different from our usual. Out of beans and ginger so substituted out of necessity orientali blend spices with ginger and broccoli.  And it was super tasty. And fast and easy too,so that gets it 5 stars.

Loved this recipe!  Tweaked it a little to make it comply with the whole 30!  

Followed the recipe as stated except...
-used coconut Amino's in place of soy sauce
-omitted the honey
-ommited ommited he flour
-added a splash of beef or chicken broth that has no added sugar
-added some spaghetti squash

THIS WAS SO SO SO GOOD AND SUPER HEALTHY!  NO SUGAR AT ALL. 

Thanks for the recipe!

We reduced the soy sauce to 2 tbsp and it was still plenty salty so we'd probably reduce it to 1 tbsp next time and add another tbsp of honey.  Hubby thought he'd maybe add a vidalia onion next time, too.  We served it with rice and were pleased with the results.

This dish was a hit.  My cousin ate with us and he said it was really good.
I did modified the dish just a little, I used frozen green beans because that's all I had, I also added some saute' onions and I added more of the honey and soy sauce to make more of a gravy but otherwise the flavors were on point.  Not too sweet or too spicy.

I made this last night. It sounded so good I could not wait to try it.  I was, however, disappointed.  It did not have much flavor.  I was hesitant to add the flour/water mixture at the end, but did so anyway.  I wish I would not have, it didn't need it.  I don't think I will make this again.

My family absolutely ADORED this dish! I did do a few things different. I removed some soy sauce and added more honey, mostly because we're on a low sodium diet. The honey and soy I added to some water and cooked ramen noodles in it before adding the beef, green beans and onions. I cooked the water down until it made a delicious sauce with the noodles and other ingredients, and ate it that way. It was stupendous! My father had 3 helpings! 

When I make this again, my only change will be to take out some ginger, as I'm not used to the heat. It wasn't bad, but I'm just not a fan.

Meh. This was just so-so. This has great flavor, but the cooking instructions didn't work for me. I was hesitant to add the cornstarch slurry (my beef mixture was not nearly saucy enough to justify adding it), but at the last minute I decided to go for it. I ended up having to moisten everything with some of the broth from the Raamen noodles I planned to add to the skillet. With my change, this was pretty good. For a quick weeknight meal, this is worth a second try. Thanks anyways, Angelica. :)

I used a full lb of ground beef so I increased the amts of ingredients.  I didn't quite double the ingredients however I added about half more of everything and it turned out ok.  I'm not so sure increasing the ingredients was necessary as it had alot of flavor.  I served it as a main dish but it so desperately needed a starch.  Next time I will try it with some kind of pasta.  It was very easy and came together quickly.

Obviously TBSP is supposed to be TSP (as the original posted noted in the comments section). We LOVED this recipe! It is so excellent that we are using these flavors on chicken and shrimp and just about everything. This will be a regular meal in our house for sure! (we have 3 kids, (12y, 7y,5y) all loved it).

Tried this tonight - awesome!  I was skeptical cuz it was ground meat & not strips of beef/steak.  It tasted great & was super easy to make.  My changes - I used 1# of meat instead of half pound & I tripled the sauce recipe so that we had some to go w the rice (got that hint from other reviews).

I've made this recipe which I found in Betty Crocker cookbook, and used molasses instead of honey.  Gives the sauce a nice brown color.  And canned green beans work fine, although I imagine fresh would be a lot better. Serve it over rice, with French fried onions sprinkled on top.

The recipe seemed promising, but the actual taste wasn't.  Fresh ginger and onion (instead of the powdered stuff) might yield better results.

Too much ginger - overpowered the other flavors.  Didn't need to thicken the sauce and in fact had to water it down.  Flavors blended but still didn't taste that great.  Good as a starter recipe, but spices need to be adjusted.  Glad everyone else liked it, though.

My family thought this recipe was horrible...too dry, sticky texture, no flavor.  I used canned green beans instead of fresh, but that was the only change I made.

Awful. I used ground turkey instead of beef. I also added chopped onion, and minced garlic to the recipe. I'm very disappointed in the results. It could have been the turkey, I don't know, and I won't be finding out.

Yuk!  There is way too much ginger in this recipe!   I think no more than 1 teaspoon of ginger would be sufficient.  I will try it again with the reduced amount of ginger.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  It had excellent flavor and the only change that I made was to add 1 tablespoon of corn starch to the 3 tablespoons of water, it added a thickness to the mixture that I think really adds to the dish.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

This was fine. My husband liked it more than I did, I think. I used almost 2 lbs of beef so I needed more soy sauce and honey for some extra sauce. I think I may try adding some other veggies - like snap peas. Easy and different. I will probably make this again at some point.
