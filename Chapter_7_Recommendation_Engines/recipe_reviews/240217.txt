I used all ingredients to taste or to what looked in proportion to me.  As written, it seems a little heavy on the cilantro and the tomatoes, although “a bunch of cilantro” is vague. Also, I didn’t cube the avocadoes, preferring the guacamole to be a little less chunky.  I normally add cumin to my guac, but Hubs and I both agree this was really good without it and, as this recipe’s first reviewer, I happily endorse it.

Yummy!  I added a little sea salt to taste and took out the Jalapeno to avoid the heat.  Delicious!!

This was Soo Soo good. Fresh tomatoes, onion & cilantro.  I cut an avacado in half topped it with this Pico De Gallo then added grilled shrimp. This is going to be our most used recipe for the summer. I just might have to try it with chicken.

04.04.17 ~ I scaled back this recipe using two avocados for our Mexican meal.  My bunch of cilantro was huge and would have been way too much for two avocados, so I just eye-balled the amount.  My husband likes a creamier dip rather than chunky, so I stirred the avocados in making it a more creamy dip.  The flavor was right on and it was quite delicious.
