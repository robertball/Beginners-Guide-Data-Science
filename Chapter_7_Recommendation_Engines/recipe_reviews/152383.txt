This is really good - I was expecting it to come out like a biscuit but it was perfect.  The only thing I might adjust next time would be to add a little parmesan or asiago, maybe romano and exchange garlic salt for the regular salt to give it a little savory kick.  But it's great just as it is and it couldn't be easier.

Made this recipe per directions.  Baked it for over 45 min. and it came out undercooked and very chewy.  Might be a good recipe for biscuits but not for a loaf.

Made it exactly as the recipe calls for and it was a moist, delicious bread with common ingredients. My picky husband and child loved it fresh from the oven.

Thought it was a heavy bread without much taste. I won't make again unless it tastes better toasted.

Have had this recipe for years and make it at least twice a week. Must say I changed the milk to buttermilk as well as added a scant 1/4 tsp. of baking soda to the dry ingredients to accommodate the buttermilk, as we prefer quick breads made with buttermilk rather than milk. 

I also add a good handful of chopped chives every now and then when available in my garden.

I used Sharp white cheddar and medium cheddar. I also added fresh thyme. This bread recipe has lots of options! We really enjoyed it with fresh mushroom soup.

I did not have beer to make my usual beer bread, and we were having an Italian dinner... Must have bread! I went searching and found this recipe. I found the dough to be pretty dry, so I added a little extra milk and butter. I increased the amount of cheese, as well. The results were AMAZING!! The bread is very hearty. Next time, I would like to try putting herbs in it.

Could use a bit more salt. I baked it in a stone loaf pan it could have used about 5 more minutes of baking time.

I will definitely make this again! I did add to the recipe and it is fantastic.  I increased the amount of the cheese, the milk to 2 cups, used garlic salt at 1 1/2 teaspoons rather than regular salt, added 1 1/2 teaspoons of parsley, and 1 chopped jalapeño. I made two loafs, one with jalapeños and one with out. I also made mini muffins from the left over dough.

This bread was really nice, but more like a tea biscuit loaf, I think.  I will make it again with a stronger cheese if I can... it was just lacking a little flavour. I used Old cheese. It was great with strawberry jam.

I made biscuits using this recipes and it makes about 15 and cooks for about 20-25 minutes. They are delicious!

I liked the way it turned out. It wasn't dry or to moist it came out just right. I didn't change anything, but I did add to the recipe. I added chopped garlic and Italian seasonings to it. I will be making this again because the recipe is so versatile, so cheers to the creator of this recipe. Thank you.

Made a few changes, used strong bread flour and yeast also added tbsp of dried oregano. Result very pleasing and will make again. However I found that it did need slightly longer baking time than in your recipe. Very good though, many thanks. Just one thing though, to save time could you also have the metric equivalents on your recipes, this side of the pond sadly we have forsaken the old imperial measures. Thanks.

This bread was great!! So good with sausage for breakfast, the only changes was I used 2cups of mild cheddar, 1/2 cup of mix white cheeses, and added dry herbs for some flavor. Was amazing!!

I followed instructions, no substitutions but I did add a bit of jarred garlic for some extra flavoring but it was still pretty bland. I did enjoy it with butter spread on each slice though. I was very good that way. If it had more of a flavor to it i'd have given it 5 stars, couldn't have been any easier to make. No yeast or egg needed.. which is nice! :)

Created a gorgeous crisp crust. Was super simple. Definately going to have to make again.
