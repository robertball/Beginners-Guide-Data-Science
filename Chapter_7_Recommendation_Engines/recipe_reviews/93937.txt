Tastes awesome. Have made it a few times and it's better with higher fat milk, of course, but also if the yolks are tempered with the hot milk/Splenda mixture instead of stirring them in at the beginning. This eliminates having to strain the scrambled egg bits out of the drink later on. Very custardy and rich. The addition of the rum is just OMG good.

Since I love eggnog, I really tried to like this.  Even tried waiting the next day to let flavors settle in, but was way too sweet.   If you make this, try using less sugar and it might be okay.

Instead of Splenda, I used equal amounts sugar. To get the rum flavor without the alcohol (because my kids love eggnog just as much as I do), I added a tablespoon of pure rum flavoring. For a fake-it eggnog, this is actually pretty tasty. This makes a GREAT DIY coffee creamer. To store it, I just poured the hot "eggnog" into Ball jars and let it cool in the fridge. NOTE: Make sure you stir this before you serve it.

This turned out pretty good. I used real sugar instead of sweetener and after reading the reviews I decided to use a lot less than the recipe called for. Glad I did because it was plenty sweet. I did use the rum and that made it the perfect consistency. Without the rum it would have been thicker than I like it. Overall a good recipe and one I would make again.
