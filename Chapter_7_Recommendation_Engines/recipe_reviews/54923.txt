I have been looking for a good but easy recipe for Lo Mein, and this is IT.  I love restaurant Lo Mein but wanted to make it at home, and from now on I will.  I added some baby corn and some minced garlic and it was great.  Lovely recipe for switching veggies around in.  Thanks!

This recipe is great.  I added some cooked diced chicken breast to it at the end and used celery and baby corn instead of onions.  

The taste of the sauce and the recipe itself was excellent.  I'm going to be making this again and again.

Please note that the chow mein noodles in the recipe are hard chow mein noodles.  I wrote this along with a bunch of other stuff down on my shopping list and ended up buying soft chow mein noodles, which I ended up using for something else, because it would have been too many soft noodles with the angel hair.

It's an great recipe though and I highly recommend it.  I'll be using it twice a month.

good sauce - i doubled the recipe because I feel like sometimes lo mein can be a little sticky.. especially when using regular starchy pasta.  Came out great, and drizzled with a little sesame oil at the end for added flavor.

This was very good! I just used regular spaghetti noodles that I cracked into small pieces before i cooked them. I only had onions, carrots and green beans on hand and so that was all that I used. Also, I sauteed the veggies in some olive oil while the spaghetti noodles were cooking and then I poured in the sauce mixture and added the noodles right to the pan and let it simmer for a couple minutes until the sauce thickened up! While it was simmering I added some garlic powder, pepper and some crushed peppers. It was soooooo good. Thanks for a great recipe!

My whole family loved this, even the veggie haters. The mushrooms make it seem like there is meat so no complaints for my meat eaters either. We will make this again for sure.

Fast, easy, and tastes great! I added minced garlic, carrots, and 1 tbls Oyster Sauce.  I didn't top with the chow mein noodles.  I was really surprised at how good this came out.  YUMMY!  I would recommend this recipe and will cook it again.

Very easy and very tasty!!!!  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of ginger to the sauce and I usually use a little thicker of a pasta.

I didn't care for this at all.  It was really salty and it didn't quite have that lo mein flavor I was looking for.  I'm not sure what would have made the difference.  Maybe use less soy?

Quite good. I changed up the vegetables a bit, but it turned out well. Not restaurant-quality, but not restaurant-priced, either! Thanks for sharing! :)

The flavor was great, just too light. I will double the sauce next time, as I like my noodles saucy.

This was a pretty easy and straigt forward recipe. Very good tasting but I added water chestnuts to give it a little more flavor. I would recommend this to everyone.

This recipe rocks! My roommate and I just made this, and it was so tasty. We added more celery, substituted more broccoli for red peppers, and used a little less onion and mushroom, and we loved it. We used a regular pot since we don't have a wok, too. As a college kid that's really just learning to cook for herself, I love that this is easy and that you can add whatever vegetables you want. We'll definitely be doing this again.

I didn't put in *quite* as much Soy Sauce as recommended and I used sesame oil rather than canola, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and I LOVED the flavour!! The sauce was surprisingly tasty and reminded me of the sort of thing you'd get at a chinese restaurant. The vegetables could easily be substituted with whatever you had on hand and I'm sure it would taste just as good with chicken added in.

Thanks for sharing this one! I have already made it a few times, and definitely will again!

Fast, easy and delicious!! The only thing I did differently was to add a small can (drained) of sliced water chestnuts to the pre-sauce veggies for extra crunch, and some crushed red pepper during the last few minutes for a little spice.  I will be making this over and over again!!

Very easy and delicious. This is not traditional "fried" restaurant l-mein, but we prefered it to the greasy takeout.  I used 12 oz. garden delight pasta from Ronzoni, low salt chix broth and low sodium soy.  All of us added a little extra soy while eating.  I think next time I'll make 1-1/2 times the sauce recipe.

I used sugar snaps instead of snow peas. I also added water chestnuts with them. Also used leftover grilled chicken at the end.

Oh my goodness!  So good.  I used Barilla Plus spaghetti noodles and when they were cooked and drained, I tossed them w/ a tsp of sesame oil while I sauteed the veggies.  I also added finely chopped garlic and some fresh ginger to the oil while it was heating before adding the veggies.  This recipe is a keeper --- you can use any veggies you like or have on hand.  Thanks for posting!

I thought this was good, I did make some changes though.  I used peanut oil, added minced ginger and garlic, used frozen stir-fry veggies and added some oyster sauce and seasame oil based on the reviews of some other members.

This was delicious! My husband didn't even realize that it had no meat til he almost done. The only thing I did differently was I did not  toss the noodles and the veggies together but let anyone mix it in their bowls.  YUM YUM

Good but for me it needed a little sweetness.  I added about 1 Tbs brown sugar and it made it perfect!  Used thin spaghetti for this.  Thanks!

Thanks for the fast and easy recipe.  We really enjoyed this meal.  The one thing I would change is the amount of sauce.  I doubled the amount and felt it was just right.  Not a big deal considering how easy it is to whip up the sauce.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I used Ramen noodles instead of the pasta. I did add a touch of oyster sauce, omitted the red peppers (the kid's won't eat them), and omitted the peas (same reason). Other than that, it was absolutely perfect, and it was much better than any Lo Mein I have had at a restaurant.

Wonderful recipe!  I added some fresh grated ginger root to the wok veggie stir fry and some water chestnuts.  I also skipped the chow mein noodles as the water chestnuts add crunch without fat or too many calories.  For the sauce, I mixed in equal parts soy sauce, hoisin sauce and sherry to make 1/4 cup.  Fantastic!!!

Super easy, light lunch to throw together :) I used wheat linguine instead of angel hair pasta and I didn't have all the veggies listed, so I tweaked it a bit. I also used fat free/low sodium broth.  The veggies I used were red pepper , mushrooms, and some chopped cilantro. Since I didn't have any onion, I added a few shakes of onion powder, garlic powder, and spicy mustard powder for flavor. I also scrambled up an egg, chopped it up very thin (like you see in fried rice sometimes) and added it to the veggies for some protein. Awesome texture, awesome taste, quick prep!

Very simple and fast to make, easy to customize as well.    Some tips-make sure you stir the broth mixture before pouring into the wok so the cornstarch mixes back in.    I would use less soy the next time, or maybe add some hoisin, but I prefer sweet to salty all the time so that may just be me.  Great recipe, will make again!

There is just a little something missing from this that keeps it from tasting like the restaurant kind, but it was still delicious! It was really easy and my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. I've made it twice now. It tastes great as a leftover just like take-out chinese.

Great recipe, I loved it!  I seasoned some blsl chicken breasts with ginger & garlic & browned them up, then added veggies.  I also used 1/2 soy sauce & 1/2 some other asian-type sauce I had (but that was just because I ran out of soy sauce).  I used my mandolin to slice up celery, green pepper, and carrots (was emptying out the veggie drawer) which helped with the prep time.  I'm planning on adding this as a regular meal I make.

Though perhaps a little bland, this is the PREFECT recipe for using staples to stretch leftovers and make a great lunch!  I had leftover pork tenderloin, mixed veggies, a green pepper out of the garden, and voila!  I might season a little more next time, but the kids LOVED it and not enough leftovers from dinner for 4 lunches made enough for us all (including teen boy with big appetite).

Will use again and again.

Our third recipe for "Meatless Mondays" and it was good, didn't have that "WOW" factor though. A very simple dish to make. I used a bag of frozen oriental veggies and added a canned of bean sprouts and waterchestnuts and used thin spaghetti instead of angel hair. It needed something else in the sauce, maybe ginger and garlic would be good. A great meal if you want to put something together in under 20 minutes.

We loved this! I didn't measure out the ingredients - I followed the recipe, but added more or less of what we preferred. The only other change I made was to stir fry the veggies in a mixture of peanut oil and sesame oil - added some great flavor. Thanks so much!

This was pretty good. I used spaghetti instead of angel hair because we like our Lo Mein thicker. I had to add extra soy sauce to this but that may just be my preference.

Sorry, but this wasn't very good.  It was the sauce - very soy sauce-y and the noodles were very slippery and "slimy".  Just not a taste I prefer.  I'll try again, with a different sauce, because I like the noodles and vegetable mixture, but as the recipe is I have to give it a 2 - edible, but not enjoyable.

I decided to use Teriyaki Sauce to marinate chicken for about 30 min prior to    slicing.  I also used Teriyaki when cooking veggies in pan....more flavor for sure!
We put it over sticky rice, soft noodles and crunchy noodles!  All were Delicious!!

Great recipe - my first foray into Chinese food. One suggestion is to cook the angel hair for 3 minutes max to get them al dente. I did 4 minutes and they became just gobs of noodles. Also add some oil to the noodle water to help keep them from sticking together.

It was delicious! I replaced the canola oil w/ stir fry oil & added sautéed shrimp & chicken to my vegetables. I did not like the chow mein noodles for topping after it was done. This was delicious and AWESOME!! Next time I'll add beef or scallops with my other meats listed.

I loved this! It was easy peasy and very tasty. I did add some garlic plus (I use that @#%$ in everything)and some grated ginger. I chose lo mein noodles rather than pasta and it was a perfect combination. I am not a fan of fish sauce so this suited me fine. Served it with breaded chicken bites in mandarin sauce and was yummy. Will definitely make again and again.

A nice, light dish with plenty of flavor.  I did sub out the mushrooms as we are not fans  and used corn and peas instead.  My grocery store stopped carrying fresh bean sprouts, so I used canned.  They worked fine in this recipe because they heated so quickly, they did not get mushy.  We liked the taste/texture of the angel hair pasta in this dish. I served this with chicken eggrolls.    This recipe has been in my recipe box since February 2011.  Glad I finally got around to making it.

This was a good starter recipe, especially for the sauce.  We like to change up the veggies and add chicken or pork, and sometimes use egg noodles or other Asian noodles instead.  I think the key to not having it turn out uber salty is to use low-sodium chicken broth AND soy sauce.  That way you can add your own amount of salt to taste.  I also like to add fresh garlic and ginger, or even red pepper flakes.  And I add the noodles just at the end of cooking, so it will really absorb some of that flavor from the sauce and veggies.

Easy to make.  I took  a shortcut and added a bag of broccoli slaw to save on chopping.   I think I will use spaghetti next time.  I used the Lo Mein noodles but they were kind of thick.  Would prefer the thinner noodles.

It was pretty good - though I did make some changes.  I used a frozen veggie mix, added mushrooms and shrimp.  For broth, I used a bouillon cube.  Though it was tasty, I found it extremely salty - and I like salt!  My husband loved the shrimp though, and he did go back for seconds.  I would make this again, but I would put half of the soy sauce, and maybe add ginger, or pepper flakes or something else to give the sauce more depth - oh yeah, I added a clove of garlic too!  Basically this is a good recipe to start with, but I think if you tailor it to your likes, you will enjoy it even more.

This was delicious! And very easy to make. I added scrambled eggs to the mix to add a protein, and just used the vegetables we had (onion, celery, cabbage, and carrots). I also used a reviewer's suggestion and add a touch of ginger to the sauce mix. It turned out perfectly! My only complaint is that it didn't make enough. Will definitely double next time. :)

I would give it a 3 but the rest of my family enjoyed it. I thought it had too many noodles, but my hubby who loves noodles, didn't. We thought it was going to be too runny and added a little more cornstarch, but I don't think you need to. After it sits it absorbs a lot. Also added some petite shrimp but you couldn't really taste them--it blended in with everything else.

I added hoisin sauce and that might've pushed the flavor over the salty edge. Used vegetarian broth. Also used baby corn in place of carrots.   NOTE: I would add bok choy before the peas, but not with the first group of veggies, as suggested.

I didn't have the veggies on hand that the recipe called for so I used yellow squash, zucchini, frozen snap peas & frozen broccoli.  I also used garlic & ginger & doubled the sauce recipe. I actually had lo mein noodles on hand and those added a great texture to the dish & my family enjoyed this recipe.  I actually had lo mein noodles on hand and I think that really added to the textures in the recipe.

Was looking for some non-italian pasta recipe and found this. Followed many suggestions and added some of my own. Definitely add fresh garlic and i also used fresh ginger and added when i was stirfrying the veggies. Also added some red pepper flakes to the sauce. Used cremini mushrooms which are much more flavorful, next time I will try using shitake also. Made it veggie, but am going to add tofu or chicken next time.Easy and good

I gave this only 4* b/c I made quite a few changes based on previous reviews. For one thing I doubled the recipe since I was cooking for 6, BIG mistake; this recipe makes tons:)I also made the following changes based on other reviews: 1) increased the sauce using following amts. 2 cans chicken broth, 6 T cornstarch, 1 cup soy sauce, & added 2 T oyster sauce; 2) used only 2 cups of chopped celery, 3) used 8 oz sliced fresh mushrooms, 4) used 3 cups chopped green bell peppers, 5) omitted the onion, 6) used 2 drained cans bean sprouts, 7) used 16 oz frozen cut broccoli for the snow peas, 8) cooked the vegetables in half sesame oil and half peanut oil, 9) added 1 T minced garlic and 2 tsp. grated fresh gingerroot to sauce mixture, 10) used spaghetti for angelhair b/c of picky eaters, and 11) added 10 oz matchstick carrots from produce section after I finished cooking the vegetables. Stirred all together and served with hard chow mein noodles and mini chicken egg rolls. Everyone loved it and the leftovers held up well.

This was okay, but I think with some experimenting I can come up with something that "fixes" it.  I followed the recipe as written except I didn't have any celery and I added some garlic to my veggies.  It was bland.  If I bought this at a restaurant, I would be disappointed.  As written, I would not make it again.

Tried this recipe and my family LOVED it!
Of course I revamped the recipe a little. Added chicken. Only veggies we used were green peppers, brocolli, and onions. We will definently be fixing this again! (Don't let wok cooking intimidate you, i had never done it before and i really enjoy it now!)

Really tasty!  The only subs. I made were omitting the onions (I used some dried onion flakes instead) & I used frozen sugar snap peas.  The crunchy chow mein noodles really add to the taste of this dish.  Even the kids really liked it!

This was so good.  I made it for lunch and used a bag of stir fry veggies (not frozen).  I also didn't use the chow mein noodles, but I'm sure they would of been wonderful.  I'll definitely be making this again, it was so easy!

These noodles were very good. I didn't have any bean sprouts or snow peas but it still came out good. I did what another reviewer had mentioned and mixed in shredded carrots after it was done. When I asked my children what I should rate these my 17 year old daughter wanted me to go higher than a five! I made this with sesame chicken and asian rice crackers for supper tonight.

We made this for dinner on New Year's Eve. This was a quick, tasty, and easy way to end 2005 :)

Very good! Added oyster sauce and some sesame oil. Also, used stir fry mix as I am lazy and did not want to chop veggies.
