A simple and quick dessert/snack that anyone can make! My only issue was that it was hard to layer. The peanut butter, being (obviously) pretty sticky, didn't really spread evenly as a layer, and then the cinnamon sugar just sat on top without really being integrated with the other ingredients. Still, it tasted good and I love that it had so few ingredients and steps.

This was okay, very easy to make. Personally, I didn't care for the flavor combo of cinnamon & peanut butter. This is not something I would make again. 3 stars for flavor, but a 4th for simplicity.
