Hey, it's Dominique! Glad everyone has liked the steaks!!! I should've noted that they can be a bit salty, so when I make them I usually get reduced-sodium soy sauce if I can. I also should've mentioned that the recipe works just as well with other cuts of beef and is even great for chicken and pork! My hubby and my 2-year-old son like it when I use this marinade to make pork chops in the slow-cooker! Anyway, makes me VERY happy to see everyone enjoying a family favorite of mine!

DEEELICIOUS!  I used sirloin and marinated it for 24 hours.  Put them on some kabobs and grilled them up.  The marinade went all thru out the steak and made them so flavorful and juicy!  Next time Im going to add some crushed garlic and brown sugar to the marinade to sweeten it up.  Like another reviewer said, this almost tastes like a menu item that a popular restaurant used to serve (fridays).  I think if you add the brown sugar to make it sweet it will taste just like it!  Great recipe, this is a favorite!

This was a major hit tonight!  I used London broil in place of flank steak.  I cut it into strips and pounded them before marinating. I only marinated for 4 hours as I was short on time.  I placed the skewers on the grill for a few minutes on each side.  They were very tender and juicy, couldn't have tasted any better.  This is a definite 5 star recipe that I would highly recommend.  Thank you Dominique Lynne for sharing.

This is close to being a teriyaki marinade. That it is too salty is not because the soya sauce is too salty, but rather because it is too dominant. add sherry or saki (at least 2 T, up to 1/4 C, experiment). As suggested, add brown sugar (1 or 2 T) but then cut out the molasses. You will achieve a fuller flavor if you press or finely chop real garlic and fresh ginger (ground/powder is a very poor substitute).

Love, love love this marinade! I've been looking so long for a good steak marinade. I use Top sirloin caps. I buy in bulk and then freeze them in the marinade. It is a mild flavor, not too much like soysauce, and with just a hint of sweetness. But, I do substitute 2-3 Tbsp. brown sugar for the molasses. Thanks!

I make about 100 of these for a party and used venison. I was sure I would have a bunch left over. They were all gone in no time at all.

We love this recipe!!! I let this marinate for 8 hours, next time I will marinate overnight as it was slightly mild but still yummy! I did sub honey for the molasses. Perfect! Terrific way to do London broil!

I use this on flank steak all the time.  I don't cut it into strips, but just leave it whole.  It is tender and juicy every time.

This is an awesome dish. My kids absolutely loved this. It has a good flavor-the longer you soak it the stronger the flavor.  I also make skewers with different vegetables on it that I marinate in balsamic vinaigrette. They are delicious.

Fabulous recipe.  I marinated it 24 hours, used flat iron steak, and grilled it outside.  Perfect. Makes a nice presentation too.

Mmmm, I used 1 clove fresh garlic and a tbsp brown sugar. I only marinated for about an hour. Very good, not too over powering. Will make again. My kids loved it, I told them it was snakes on a stick.

I used this recipe in the crock pot.  I used three pounds of venison instead of beef and tripled the amount of sauce so that it covered the meat.  I did not have any olive oil so I substituted with vegetable oil.  It was delicious.  I will also use this during the summer as a marinade for grilling.  Oh side note, I also added a three tablespoons of brown sugar to the tripled amount of sauce.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was my first attempt at making flank steak and my 2nd honest attempt at using my broiler. They turned out pretty good. My oven smelled like an outside bbq. I ended up broiling them for about 6 minutes on each side because mine were kind of large. And, I used at least 3 lbs of meat. Make sure to use a large pan with sides because some of the liquid can spill. And, do not leave the kitchen while these are broiling, because they do cook quite fast. Thanks, for the interesting recipe to try tonight.

Oh my gosh. What a winner. Next time, the butcher said he'd slice the meat and thread these for me no charge in thanks for me stopping back in with this recipe for him to try. He loved it, and yes you got all the credit. (I hope he means he'll slice & thread every time I call my order in. What a deal for me!) We had fun with this one. Everybody's happy. I agree with your advice to use low-sodium Soy Sauce. That's why you get *****.   ~Congrats, Dominique and thanks.

Aloha, If you use regular soy sauce cut it half with water to decrease the salt. Important to soak your wooden skewers in water for several hours prior to threading meat, they won't burn on the grill.

I cubed up a beef roast and merinated the meat for 24 hrs. Next day I put meat, cubed up potatoes and ears of corn(cut into 3's) and baked it at 350 for about an hour and it turned out excellent. I then took the remaining marinated meat and made Chinese Pepper Steak with it. That turrned out better then my original recipe I have for pepper steak. Props to the person who submitted this marinade. Love how universal it is!

OMG! The meat practically "melts in your mouth" it comes out so tender and juicy! This was so easy to throw together with excellent results. I would highly recommend a minimum of at least 8 hours and overnight for maximum effect. I used low sodium soy sauce to avoid this being overly salty, cut back on the water and added a little rice wine vinegar. I also added a little minced garlic vs. powder. I poured everything into a ziploc bag and let it go! I opted to grill these vs. broiling. What could be simpler? The results were nothing less than fabulous and as the submitter states these are excellent as an appetizer. This recipe is a definite keeper!

I think the key to this recipe is make absolutely certain you get that nice char on your meat.  I made in broiler as directed, but for some reason (??) my meat wouldn't char.  The taste was okay, but *just* okay.  Husband heated up the cast iron pan smok'n hot and did a quick high sear - this COMPLETELY changed the taste and took it from a 3 to a 5*.  Next time, will a) add about a T of brown sugar and b) definately grill.  Oh - and if you're using flank steak (which we did), but sure to cut your slicees against the grain.  Ours turned out fall apart tender, even after the hard sear...UPDATE:  Just had to pop in and note this:  we had original sticks last night with stirfry, rice & eggrolls - it was perfect.  Had leftovers tonight (unexpectedly) as carne asada taco's - perfect!  This maranade is to DIE for!

My kids love this!! Fun to eat, and fast to cook (this is my favorite part).  If you can't get flank steak you can try cheap round steak and slice it the same - against the grain.

Delicious! I didn't have mustard powder so I used about 1 tsp of spicy mustard. Made this with Japanese-Style Sesame Green Beans on this site and rice for a complete meal. Yummy.

This is excellent in soft tacos!  I use flank steak and cut it into strips, then marinate it overnight.  Then I cut it into chunks and cook/fry it in a heated grill pan to get a nice braise (is that the right word?) on the meat.  I do have a problem with too much marinade going into the pan with the meat so I drain it as much as I can and then a couple times while it's cooking (it cooks really quick not counting the time needed to drain it a few times).  Corn tortillas warmed in olive oil, cheese, lettuce, tomato, cilantro, salsa, YUM! :)

I added CHINESE FIVE SPICE instead of the ground ginger and a little brown suger to the sauce. ThenI marinated this for a little over 24 hours. It says prep time is 10 mins. But it does take a while to put all the meat on the sticks.Then I put them on the outside grill.  I didn't mean to but I cooked almost half of the sticks a little to long. So don't put more 
on then you can watch or get to fast enough. They taste and smell WONDERFUL! :)

Rave reviews at our house after marinating 4 sirloin steaks in this and grilling them.

Only substitution - since I didn't have molasses, I used 1Tbsp sugar and 1Tbsp honey.

Will stick with the Asian Beef Skewers on this site.  This just tasted like straight soy sauce, too salty with no real flavor.

MMMM...these were WONDERFUL!  I realized when I went to make the marinade that I was out of molasses, so I subbed brown sugar.  I added a little bit more brown sugar when I realized that I didn't have low-sodium soy (which I thought I had)...just regular.  Kept everything else the same and grilled these for just a few minutes on each side.  They were gone in a flash!  The extra Tbsp. of brown sugar kept them from being to salty and didn't make them sweet at all.  They were tender and flavorful and wonderful!  I did use flank steak, but could use any cut of beef!  GREAT!

Also my first review! To me, this is the way steak is supposed to taste.  I believe that you shouldn't have to add any sauces to make a steak good and this recipe definitely doesn't need anything extra.  I didn't find it too salty but I also used reduced sodium soy sauce.  This is how I will make my steak from here on in.

Use light soy sauce, or if you can find white soy sauce it's not so salty

We loved the flavor of this marinade!  Like the idea of adding fresh ingrediants to the recipe. I cooked them about a minute too long so next time I will cut down the time and also try them on the grill.  My son who doesn't like red meat even liked these.  Would also make a great regular steak marinade.

I added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar but will add 1/2 cup next time. Even though they weren't as sweet as I'd like, they were delicious. They reminded me of a steak on a stick from a local fast food chinese food chain. Yum!

I made this for a bar-b-que and it was a huge hit.  I substituted wasabi powder for the mustard powder.  I will use low sodium soy sauce next time as they were a little on the salty side.  I even used cheap steak and they were still very tender and delicious.

I'm sorry but my family and I did not care for the flavor. It was not tender, and marinated for two days. Just not our taste I guess.

This recipe warranted my first review (my daughter reviewed another under my name) in my 3 years of dabbling on allrecipes.  Although I personally found it salty, I can't imagine a more simple, yummy recipe.  This was easy to assemble with no exotic ingredients and it easily accomodates fresh spices, if preferred.  My 21-year-old daughter strongly requests it for her upcoming 22nd birthday, thus I will try it with London Broil or sirloin.  Slicing the meat is a breeze if you can catch the steak slightly frozen.  Thank you, Dominique for a keeper!

This is a fun one and delish, too!! My son asked for a finger food night and I threw these on the grill. They were a bit salty but I read back and saw that people were using low sodium soy sauce. That would probably fix that tiny little issue. Couldn't take a star off for that, though, they're just too good!!

This is really a fun recipe to serve to the family & friends.  I have made it several times, turns out great. Make sure you soak those wooden skewers, my first time I had some burnt ones, but the meat was fabulous. I want to try chicken next time.

This sounds so good - easy as well.  Will make real soon.  I plan to add some honey - may lessen the salty taste.

I love this recipe, although I've never made it using steak - we use chicken because we always have chicken. It's a regular in our house. We do use low sodium soy because it can be a little salty. It's a keeper!

We enjoyed these although they weren't quite a duplicate of Chinese restaurant steak on a stick.

THE TASTE WAS EXCELLENT, HOWEVER, I USED FLANK STEAK AND DID EXACTLY AS THE RECIPE CALLED FOR AND THE MEAT WAS VERY VERY TOUGH.... I SEE WHERE SOME PEOPLE USED STEAK TIPS. I THINK I WILL TRY THAT NEXT TIME.  THE TASTE WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TO TRY IT AGAIN, BUT MY HUSBAND LEFT MOST OF IT BECAUSE IT WAS TOO TOUGH.

Our entire family thought this was incredible. I haven't done it with beef strips, just the entire steak. Flank steak works incredibly well, but then I have an awesome butcher who provides excellent quality meat. If I ask what they would like for a special dinner, this dish is always the first request. Too bad for me that there's always a January request and it's a tad cold!  If salt is an issue, and it is here, then use a sodium reduced soy sauce; and I do use fresh garlic and ginger as per the suggestions of others. Thank you so much for this share.

This was great. A little salty from the soy (and I love salt) so I may try lite next time. But my husband was eating this for dessert! I'd say that's good.

This had a great flavor, but it was so salty we couldn't eat it. I will try again with reduced sodium soy sauce and maybe some water to cut down the saltiness. I did add honey and brown sugar for some sweetness as suggested in reviews.

Very very good recipe......The flavor was very good and family enjoyed.  Just need to be careful when broiling not to burn since it is thin...probably less then 3-4 minutes as stated in the recipe.  Will make again!

Great! Served them at room temp for an open house and people raved about them.  I made 85 skewers and every one of them was gone before the party ended.  The skewering was a bit tedious, but the result was well worth it.  I should mention that I did substitute sirloin.

My son enjoyed this and had two helpings.  I liked it but the next time I make it, I'll wait until it's warmer outside so I can slap these babies on the grill instead of broiling them.  I think I'll marinate them for two days instead of just overnight.

I think that most recipes on this website tend to be a bit over-rated, so I don't give out 5 stars lightly, but I'd give this recipe 6 stars if I could. It is awesome! I let the steak marinate for 2 days (accidentally) and it was so tender and flavorful. It reminds me of the steak on a stick that used to be on the menu of a popular chain restaurant.

I make my own terriyaki marinaded quite often and a little tip for anyone when making this for sweetening is brown sugar and pineapple juice. pineapple juice is fantastic to sweeten  and tenderize the  meat.

This is a very good recipe, that said for the longest time I thought something was missing from it. Some bit of flavor that should be there that was missing. I finally found that flavor. Add a teaspoon of crushed red pepper and a teaspoon of oregano. The flavor really comes to life.

I have made this recipe a few times. I always use the regular soy sauce and double the recipe. after I marinade the meat ( i do marinade overnight ) and skewer them I put them in single layer with parchment and then put them in freezer bags ( uncooked )  and that way all month I can take out what I want that night ( still frozen and right in the oven ). when I am done with the marinade I do make a few of them with pasta and the left over marinade. this recipe is better then any restaurant I've ever had these. and they are still nice and juicy. not dried out like the restaurant. yes a little salty but I do like that. I think this recipe is perfect as is.

My husband and I loved this recipe. Super easy and delicious! I actually let the steak marinate overnight. My hubby is already asking for it again.

This was delicious!  I followed the directions, but used top sirloin steak, marinated for about 24 hours and then tossed them on the grill.  I was hesitant to purchase the molasses because I never use it but it was worth it and I will make these again!

I marinated this for 10 hours and subbed brown sugar for the molasses. Used freeze dried ginger instead of the powder. I ended up cooking this in a cast iron skillet over high heat. I got a good sear on the steak. This tasted good. The flavor wasn't too powerful but had enough that it was good enough to eat alone. I will definitely try this on the grill when the weather looks better.

Made marinade as written.  Tasted it before marinating it in steak and needed some more brown sugar.  Added about 1/4 cup more.  Also I added chicken legs in the marinade.  Turned out so yummy!  We actually liked the chicken legs a little more than the steak.

I cut the recipe in half and made it for the family. Everyone enjoyed it and the meat was very tender. Could also be done without the sticks...marinate the steak, broil and then slice.

This was good, but it was missing something. The flavor was just a little flat. I think it needed something acidic. I might try it again with some rice wine vinegar added, and as another reviewer suggested, I would add fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.

06-21-16 ~ Great recipe for a stick of great flavor! I had a small flank steak, so I halved the recipe and put the strips on metal skewers. These grilled up evenly and delicious. I did use low-salt soy sauce, as that is what I had on hand. That was the only change to the ingredients, and I will make them the same way, next time.

The first time I made this it was GREAT but I felt it needed a little kick so the 2nd time I made it I added about a tablespoon of crushed red pepper to it.  That made a big, but not overpowering difference.  This is absolutely wonderful!!

I didn't make any changes. It was really good. The only thing that could have counted as a change I made was that I had to substitute for dry mustard by using the mustard you put on hotdogs.

My husband loved these, but I found them a bit too salty. Next time, I plan on halving the soy sauce content. Maybe using reduced sodium soy sauce. I found there was plenty of sauce for the amount of meat.

Very good and super easy to make. I can't wait to try these on the grill this summer. I tenderized the meat before marinating so it was nice and tender.

Everyone in the family loves this, but as others have noted, it can be quite salty. I reduce the soy sauce in half and it's much better. Next time I'll try reduced salt soy sauce as the contributor suggested.

Only change; used half the molasses and then a big pinch of brown sugar. Also used reduced sodium soy -- I feel that is a very necessary change. I used 35% less and should have used 50% less. Marinated it about 15 hours... It was FABULOUS. Tender, flavorful. Will make it many more times.

Its very tasty and healthy recipie ! I like to Grill meat and seafood tasty Grill dishes for family and coleagues parties. Many Years expierence and guests say my grill dishes are top tasty. But I had not before good Grill recipie for outdoor grill made from beef. So this one its Great because Steak pieces are smaller than ordinary Steak and marinade souce has 1/4 cup of olive oil, so it makes beef overnight more juicy-oily and after grill fire its not drying. Ingredients all are natural organic - so this dish its healthy ! Fast and Easy preparation. Taste its Great !
Thank you for this EXCELENT recipie !

Unbelievable and easy.  Used honey instead if molasses and eyeballed the other seasonings...doesn't matter.  Kids can mix marinade in 2 minutes and just put it in the broiler 3 minutes before you cook.  Going into the rotation!

The only thing I can say, "WOW"!!!! A little too salty but I like salt.  My husband and I couldn't stop saying wow as we were eating these.

Loved this recipe. Made this for small wedding reception, everyone loved this. Used sirloin, more economical than flank. Didn't have molasses, used several tablespoons of brown sugar until taste was balanced. Used equal amount of "Bragg Liquid Aminos", a gluten-free sub for Soy Sauce. Let marinate 24 hours then grilled. Wished we had made more. Thanks for a wonderful new easy recipe.

Although I thought the recipe was a bit too salty, my husband just raved about it.  I did keep to the recipe except I used fresh ground ginger and freshly minced garlic.  We will have this again.  Thanks for sharing

As easy as it sounds, and family liked it. As teen son said when I asked, "It's steak. On a stick. Yes." Will make again.

I had this for a football party at my house! They were delicious but best of all, they only took 5 minutes in the broiler so less time away from my guests!I used the low-sodium soy sauce. I think that is key. I also marinaded the steak strips 20 hours (over night and the steak was so tender. Great recipe!

The steak was tender, but I didn't think the taste was exceptional as others suggested. I thought it was a bit bland. The kids loved it though, so gave it 4 stars.

Marinated thin sliced sandwich steaks in this for 2 hrs. but used honey instead of molasses and didn't add the ground mustard. Folded the steaks, skewered them and broiled until browned on both sides. Accompanied with a side of pineapple fried rice, my kids devoured it. Note: Make more next time.

This was so good!  I didn't have molasses so I substituted with 1Tbsp Brown Sugar.  Also grilled the steak rather than broiling it and it turned out great. Definitely will be making this dish again.

Very tasty. Added 1T brown sugar and only marinated 3-4 hours and was still good. I'll marinate it longer next time if I have time.

This is probably the greatest dish I have ever brought to a party. Only complaint is the recipe needs to be multiplied because these babies are going to disappear quick!

That restaurant chain used pineapple juice, no water, and no oil. I also don't remember putting in any sugar or molasses. I have not tried this recipe so cannot rate.

All you have to do is try this one and you will know why it is rated 5 stars, so easy, so good, and a fun meal or appetizer to share with friends and family.  I did grill mine and used sirloin grilling tips but I have no doubt the flank steak would be great also.

My friend Linda made this for our Bunko group, and everyone raved about the flavor and tenderness!  Excellent choice for a meat-on-a-skewer.  We ate and enjoyed it without a sauce, but I'm interested in dipping sauce ideas--maybe a horseradish sauce?
