I needed a mango sauce for tropical pancakes and I chose  this recipe. I used a 15 oz jar of mangos that I put in the blender  for a smooth sauce and I substituted amaretto in place of the brandy and it was to die for!! I am thinking of bottling it for gifts!

Tried this with chicken sausage and pasta.  Nice compliment.  Pur√©ed fresh mango and added some chunks.  Probably could have used a little more.  
I added a pinch of salt after the fact.  Would go well over cake with berries.

Very easy and went great with coconut shrimp. I use apple cider instead of the alcohol suggested and puree a fresh mango.
