It had little taste and no thickness.  It is good if you are trying to lose weight, but otherwise, don't bother.

For a low fat soup this was pretty good.  Instead of the cans of chicken broth I used 1 1/2 cups of water and 1 Tablespoon chicken bouillon.  I also decreased the milk to 1 cup and increased the potato flakes to 1 cup.  It obviously wasn't the same as a soup filled with fat but I liked it as a healthy alternative.

This was GREAT!  I added extra Garlic powder and skipped the milk, adding water instead. I also tossed in a little non-dairy creamer to replace the milk. IT WAS GREAT! Thanks for sharing!

This was great, but I did change a few things b/c I didn't have potato flakes and I don't like celery or onions.  I only used the potatoes and broth.  After boiling I put in my vitamix and added the milk.   I then added a SMALL handful of low fat cheese and a small handful of bacon bits.   Very very good!!

Okay so I may have added a little more than a pinch of parsley and unskinny'd it up by topping it with bacon and cheese but this recipe wowed me more than I thought it would actually. For the potato flakes I used a pre-fab package of homestlyle butter flavored flakes and this made all of the difference in the world. This soup was very flavorful and didn't require the salt that I thought it would have needed. To put it over the top I recommend adding a pinch of cheese,green onions or chives,and some cooked turkey bacon crumbled over the top and you have all of the makings of a loaded tator without all of the guilt.

I wish I had read the reviews before I made it.  No thickness whatsoever.  I even added extra potato flakes and it didn't help!!
