If you are having trouble getting the breading to stick, add a couple of teaspoons or more of regular mayo to the sour cream. Let the breaded cutlets sit in the fridge for at least a half hour before cooking and make sure the oil is hot(not smoking)before adding the cutlets. Do not crowd them in the pan. Crowding them causes steam and that will cause the breading to fall off.  After you have put them in the fry pan and a nicely browned crust has formed, reduce the heat so they will cook through without burning the crust.Or then move them to the oven uncovered to finish cooking through.

I have never tried baking these but I never feel guilty about pan frying them since they are pan fried in just one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. The last time I made them (two days ago) I measured the oil to make sure that I was just using one Tbsp. and  they came out perfectly, as usual.  I also tried adding the dijon mustard to the sour cream.  Excellent recommendation! I liked the different flavor it added.  I have made these cutlets several times since posting the recipe and I always have spectacular results, the breading doesn't ever stick or fall off of mine.  Everyone has different cooking techniques, and my approach has never failed me.    
My family likes these a lot, but I don't think I've ever said they are "to die for." lol  Not many foods get that comment from me---and it would definitely be for something more sinful than Turkey. :o) 
Different strokes for different folks, but if you like turkey cutlets, I'd bet you'll like these ones. :o)

This was a great way to use left over turkey.  I had very little sour cream, so I also added equal parts of mayo and dijon mustard - it was delicious.

Let me start off by saying that I used two turkey breasts - I did not pound them - just left them "full size"  This was really good!  I was very leary to use sour cream - but I followed others advice and stirred in Grey Poupon mustard with some 'herbs de provence' seasoning and - wow!!!  Instead of using regular bread crumbs - I used Panko crumbs and it was really crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside!!!  I did fry them in a pan to get them golden brown, then transferred to the oven until they were done.  That seemed to keep the breading on nicely - make sure you put a little cooking spray in teh pan before you put in the turkey so they just slide right out!  Very easy and VERY good!!!  thanks

I really liked this.  I do usually pick the low fat alternative, but in this case I only had regular sour cream.  I also used Kellogg's Corn Flakes crumbs instead of seasoned bread crumbs.  I think those two are the secret. The flakes stayed on because the regular sour cream was thicker, and the corn flakes were crispier. I pounded the cutlets to about half their original thickness and added Grey Poupon to the sour cream for a little added zing.  I only needed the 1 T of olive oil, and these truly were a treat. What was left over from the night before made fantastic sandwiches the next day. Very satisfying!

Kudos to the reviewer who suggested the dijon mustard.  I added it to the sour cream (about 2 tsp. and it gave it a real zing.  Yum!

Thanks to some other reviewers, these were a real success. I mixed up sour cream, a little mayo and a little dijon and spread it on both sides of the cutlets... let them sit in the fridge before breading them.  I also let them sit on a rack for about 15 mins after dredging.  It's true that getting the oil nice and hot before dropping them is the key to getting the breading to stick. I used panko instead of Italian breadcrumbs and to the panko and cheese I added garlic powder, onion powder, sage, thyme, salt and pepper.  The flavor was outstanding and they were sooo good with mashed pototoes, gravy, stuffing and green beans.

A very different way to prepare the turkey cutlets. Although my breading fell off with the first three cutlets the fourth one came out very nice and crunchy and I think it's because it didn't fit in the pan the fourth cutlet sat for a few minutes before cooking so I think that next time I'll let the breaded cutlets sit for a few minutes before cooking them. I added the dijon mustard to the sour cream and it was good. The turkey cutlets that I used were kind of thick not too much but not as thin as the recipe calls for and I cooked them a little bit longer and they were very moist and I salvaged most of the breading and even then the tukey cutlets were good. I gave 4 stars because of the breading falling off but I will try this again.

Excellent flavor and very easy. I used reduced fat sour cream mixed with 1 tsp of herbed dijon mustard. Also, I did not have seasoned breadcrumbs so I mixed in 1 tbsp of italian seasoning with plain breadcrumbs.

This recipe was so fast and easy.  The cutlets were so moist and tasty.  I look forward to trying it with chicken too.  The sour cream made a difference and was so much easier to work with than eggs.

This was really good. Nobody even suspected the sour cream. The sour cream made a delicious difference to me. My family really liked it. It made my boring cutlets very tastey!

Delicious!  I'm giving the original recipe 4 stars, b/c I used a couple of suggestions given by previous reviewers:  (1)  Add dijon honey mustard to sour cream (2) Allow cutlets to hang out in the fridge for awhile after breading (3) Bake instead of frying.  They were absolutely delish last night, and I'm having the leftover half of mine (boy, those things really spread out when you pound them!) today for lunch.  I baked for about 45 minutes at 425, and they came out crispy, juicy, and totally breaded, no oil needed--just a zap of vegetable oil spray in the pan and on top of the cutlets!  Oh, one last thing:  I added some potato flakes to my breading mixture ... really adds some crunch!  :)

This was great!  I didn't have any sour cream, so I substituted yogurt and a little Miracle whip. Other than that, I left the recipe as is.  Very easy, simple ingredients, but the result was very tasty!  This is a keeper

The flavor of this was great, and I had no problems at all with my breading falling off or sticking.  I did find them to be dry, hence only giving them 4 stars, but that is probably my own fault rather than that of the recipe.

I made this last night. I had trouble with the breadcrumbs adhering to the turkey. I added some dijon & mayo like the others did. I would omit the italian seasoning next time. It just didn't go. I will have to try this again and experiment.

We loved this recipe.  I didn't have any sour cream, so used a thin layer of mayonnaise.  Per suggestion of another reviewer, I put them in the refrigerator, after putting on the bread crumb mixture.  I didn't have any problems with coating falling off.  I also used Panko bread crumbs, which gave it a very crunchy texture.  This will be a regular meal at our house

We thought these were fantastic! Juicy as promised. Although turkey can sometimes be a little lacking in flavor, this recipe makes for a perfectly delicious piece of turkey. Thanks Tanya!

This is an excellent way to saute chicken or turkey breasts. Also works well for pork cutlets. I have used No-Mayonnaise Ranch Dressing, (from this site). This Ranch dressing is excellent in general, and has sour cream and buttermilk as main ingredients. I always have it on hand, even if I do not have sour cream available.

These cutlets have the BEST flavor! I prepare this recipe as is, which is wonderful for the turkey cutlets. My boyfriend who HATES sour cream doesn't even know it's on there.  I also use this on chicken and make chicken parmesan...DELICIOUS!

These were moist and tasty! I had to pound my cutlets, as they were thicker than 1/4". I used regular, not fat free sour cream and mixed in 2 tsp dijon mustard, as suggested. For the bread crumbs I used 1/2c Italian bread crumbs and 1/2c Panko (Japanese) bread crumbs for some added crunch. I made these ahead to this point and refrigerated them, I think that helps seal them and I had no trouble with the breading staying on while they cooked. Although these are good alone, I wanted something to dip them in, so I mixed up a sauce/dip of 1C whole cranberry sauce, 3 Tbl Apple Jelly and 1 tsp Dijon mustard with a touch of allspice. I refrigerated this a while to meld the flavors and then served on the side. The leftover cutlets and sauce made great sandwiches too!

These were very good. I added a tablespoon a Dijon mustard to the sour cream (and I used full fat sour cream). I'll definitely make these again; they were quick, easy and tasty. I didn't have much problem with the breading. I coated the turkey cutlets and let them sit for about 30 minutes before putting them into the pan to help the crumbs "settle" on the cutlets.

This was DELICIOUS! I did make a lot of alterations based on reviews - I made it with non-fat yoghurt I wanted to use up, mixed with Dijonnaise and some garlic and herb mayo. I used plain breadcrumbs with rosemary, basil, onion powder and garlic salt mixed in (forgot the pepper oops think that would have been even better) and panfried for colour before transferring to the oven and grilling (broiling?). I did have a few problems with the coating coming off, but I think covering the grill rack with tin foil might help here. It tasted fantastic, the meat was incredibly tender and juicy, and, especially for the first time I have ever cooked turkey, was a great success - my boyfriend who is a chicken breast addict said he'd rather have turkey if it's going to be this good! Thanks for this recipe. :)

Quick and delicious. I dropped the tenderloins in a gallon Ziploc, pounded them to an even thickness and then added the sour cream for coating.  Next I transferred the tenderloins to a second Ziploc with the seasoning and cheese and simply shook it to coat them evenly.  When the pan and oil were hot, it only took a few minutes to cook them to perfection.  Super easy and with easy cleanup.

I had such high hopes for this.  I'm not sure what happened, but like many other reviewers, this recipe stuck to the pan.  I tried three different times and the coating always stuck to the pan and came off.  I followed the instructions of several reviewers (i.e. add more of the sour cream mixture, let it rest for 15 minutes etc. use more or less oil).  IF the coating stayed on I think this could have been very good... as it is, I am going to give it a 3 1/2 stars.  It's got potential, but for this cook, it's just not working.

I was so afraid cooking turkey chops... afraid they would be dry. I followed this recipe as is, well, I used turkey CHOPS instead of cutlets. The chops turned out perfect! Juicy, golden brown, and tasty!

This is a really fast to make recipe.  I didn't have sour cream though, so i dredged the cutlet in eggs first.  Turned out great!

This was just okay for us.  The flavor did now "wow" anyone.  Also I had the problem of the coating coming off during cooking, even though I tried some of the tips other reviewers posted.  Sorry, don't think we'll be making this one again.

I will never make these again. The breading kept on falling off during the cooking time, very fustrating when you've got 4 little kids to feed and a husband.

My husband thought they were great, but I just didn't like the taste.  I don't think I'll make this again.  I might try it with chicken, but this isn't the way I want my turkey to taste.

This was totally easy, and absolutely awesome!!! I did add a little bit of garlic powder to the breadcrumb mixture, just because were garlic lovers!! The sour cream seemed odd at first, but it was far better then using egg, and much less messy. I will be making this again!

This made for a yummy dinner! I didn't have sour cream on hand, so I substituted it with mayo. Made it with Turkey Cutlets and Chicken Cutlets. 
Served with pan roasted shallots... better than gravy! 
This one is going into my recipe box! Thanks!
UPDATE:  I made this again today, but again, didn't have sour cream or parmesan cheese.  What I did have was creamy French Onion Dip, so I heavily smeared that on the cutlets and then into the Italian bread crumbs. I also added a little butter to the olive oil while cooking.  Oh my, it was just delicious! Obviously, this recipe is great with anything you might have on hand! ENJOY!

We used this today for Thanksgiving, I ended up baking it 375 for 25 minutes and it came out perfect. We ended up making our own Italian seasoning and fresh garlic with plain bread crumbs. Thanks!

First off, you need to use a lot more olive oil than is called for or all of the breading sticks to the pan and leaves none on the turkey.  Secondly, this is a bland dish that needs some jazzing up.  Not my fav.

This was just okay. I will stick to my ususal dipping the turkey breasts in egg, then dipping in crumbs & parmesan. The coating didn't really stay on the turkey real well.

Theese were ok.  I needed more than 1Tbsp of olive oil!  They ended up browning up really fast. So I had to transfer them to the oven to finish cooking.  They ended up being more work than I had planned.  Not sure I will make these again.

The breading would not stay on on the cutlets while I was cooking them. The few bites I got that did still have the breading were good, but overall, I think I'll pass on this recipe in the future.

Husband LOVED these served over rice. I added the suggested mustard and garlic. Also I added an egg to the sour cream mixture, it really helped it stick. Had no problems with the breading coming off. I pan fried them to golden brown and then baked them till done. Very yum, will be making them again.

This was very good I also added the mustard and garlic powder!  I baked mine at 350 for 50 mins since my cutlets were way thicker.  Was very good and my kids told me I'm a great cook!  Thanks!

I've always thought that turkey cutlets were tasteless.  You proved me wrong. These were so good; lots of flavor. I followed the recipe to the letter and would not change a thing. Thanks for your ingenious idea.

Tastes great! Had problems cooking it though, the cutlets tried falling apart. To avoid this, I used a spatula and salad fork to transfer them into the pan. Cooked on both sides for three minutes each, and then popped into the oven at 400 degrees for 13 minutes to allow it to cook fully, while avoiding burns (also less oil consumption)

This is great.  I flipped my chicken with a fork and had no trouble with the breading.  It tastes like a chicken schnitzle recipe I have from a gourmet magazine...but much easier.  I added some chives and garlic paste into the sourcream and dijon mustard mixture.  Very yummy dish.

This was a nice take on turkey cutlets. I seasoned them with pepper prior to breading but should have used salt also. I took MBC's suggestion and used mayo w/dijon. I used ground pecans instead of bread crumbs which added a nice flavor. Thank you Tanya!

These cutlets are wonderful!  I have made these twice and have gotten rave reviews from my family.  I love how moist they turn out.  These will definitely become part of our dinner rotation.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I love sour cream so I used lite instead of fat free, because I don't think you can taste the fat free.  My very picky boyfriend loved it too.  Next time I will try the suggestion of adding dijon mustard.

I dont know what I did wrong but the breading did not stick at all. Maybe my temperature was off or maybe the turkey needs to be at room temperature before coating. Not sure I will try this again.

I didn't have  quite enough sour cream so I added mayonnaise. The cutlets were juicy and delicious. My family loved them.

We had never served any kind of cutlets before and really wanted something different.  Loved this recipe.  We used plain panko crumbs because that's what we had handy.  Just added garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Great results.

This recipe was very good. I used the dijon mustard and Italian bread crumbs. I'm not sure how the dijon would clash with Italian bread crumbs, but it did not. I also let the breaded cutlets set on a cooling rack a little while before cooking. Breading did not fall off. I heated up a leftover cutlet for lunch today, and it was still very good. A keeper

Yum Yum!
Followed this recipe and added my own twist. First I seasoned the cutlets with poultry seasoning, pepper, Mrs. Dash and garlic powder. Put them in a ziploc bag and marinated over night. Just like other reviewers added some Dijon mustard and
hot/sweet mustard to the sour cream. After I spread this mixture on and the breading it is wise to let them sit in the fridge for about 15 minutes. I used a tad bit more olive oil and fried for 4 minutes per side.  Perfect!!

Excellent easy recipe. I used panko bread crumbs and plain Greek yogurt (because it's what I had on hand). Came out really moist - always difficult with such low fat turkey cuts. Use non stick maybe because my second batch stuck. Definitely will make this again!

I love to purchase Whole Foods turkey cutlets. They are sliced perfectly and taste so fresh. This recipe is amazing with the sour cream/dijon combo. I used panko bread crumbs, they stayed on perfectly and the cutlets were done in 10 minutes. I did add more spices-garlic powder, more italian seasoning and pepper. Leftovers for tomorrow. Will make again.

Made this tonight for the first time and forgot the Dijon. It was very different then what I might typically make and really good. I decided to use grape seed oil but found I needed about a 1/4 cup total. Just be careful not to make it too crunchy. After frying, I did place it in the oven for a few minutes. I will try this again next week WITH the Dijon.

Absolutely delicious and easy to prepare. I forgot to let the cutlets sit in the fridge for a few minutes to avoid the sticking, but they still came out fine. They were tender and flavorful. With the advice of other reviewers, I added Dijon mustard to the sour cream. That was a great suggestion. For additional spice, I  also sprinkled the cutlets with salt, pepper and garlic powder before covering them with the Panko bread crumbs. I will definitely be cooking this again.

Made this last night, and it was a hit! Read all the reviews and took in all the advice. Added a little mayo to the sour cream, didn't have any Dijon. After breading, I put in the fridge for about 25-30 minutes. Had pan nice and hot, did not crowd the cutlets. Did use a bit more oil than the recipe called for. The hardest part was being patient & not turning (or checking the underside) too soon. Browned nicely, looked great. Husband & I loved them. How did these simple ingredients make bland boring turkey cutlets something to rave about? Thanks! This recipe is going in my recipe book.

Instead of sour cream I used lowfat ranch dressing as the binder of the crumbs to the cutlets. All of the crumbs stayed intact.  It came out really well.  I absolutely will be making this more!

Made this tonight ....Thursday, a week night, no less.  It was terrific!  I followed the recipe , but then topped each cutlet with tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella then put in the oven to melt the cheese .  It was really good and even the time of 25 minutes was right on.

Mine did not turn out the way that it should have I did use the sour cream and 1 tsp of dijon mustard and Italian bread crumbs but I did not let it refridgerate.  I must have a small pan because all my cutlets didn't fit into the pan and my oil kept drying out of the pan so i put more in.  The breading did come off and it burnt the crust but some of it that wasnt burnt was really good.  I am not going to quit until I get it right I think it is a great recipe and I just think it was the cooker(me)...lol

Way too much work.  The breaded part did not stay on the cutlet, even after following the hints of the other reviewers. The end result wasn't too bad-tasting though.

Great, easy recipe.  Used fat free yogurt and about a TBS of dijon mixed together, then coated them with panko and parmesan.  Kept warm in oven while I was finishing everything up.  DELICIOUS - kids and husband LOVED them...  This is a keeper - thanks!

i bought turkey cutlets on sale and didn't havea clue what to do with them. i chose this recipe from the few on the website to try.  it was good - my kids enjoyed dipping these generously in ketchup.  i found them to be a little plain for my taste, but that's just me.  i also thought they were kinda dry... i much prefer chicken tenderloins for a dish like this.  good for something new to try though!

Very good breading.  Loved the sour cream idea.  I watched the clock, but still overcooked it a bit on the first side.  I was amazed that 1 tbsp of oil could make it well.

I'm a novice cook and my turkey cutlets came out perfect!  The breading did not fall off at all.  I added paprika and garlic salt to the breadcrumbs.  I had put off cooking the turkey because I wasn't looking forward to eating turkey cutlets, but I found this recipe and they were delicious!

I followed this exactly and i thought it was a very nice change to eating turkey> I had no prob gettting bread crumbs to stick while frying and you dont even taste the sour cream :-)  If the pan is too hot then the breading will stick to the pan and not the turkey...

I thought this was great.  I added garlic powder and onion powder to the bread crumbs.  I also let the turkey sit in the fridge with the sour cream on it for about 20 min before I breaded and fried them.  Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli and cheese! YUM

I just made these for the first time and my very picky daughter loves them.  I finished them in the oven just so i didn't burn them and they are so moist.  I used half and half instead of sour cream only because that's what i had and it ended working really well.  I served it with homemade honey mustard and ranch dressing.....big hit.

It was very good.  I cut the light sour cream in half and added 1 tbsp brown mustard and followed the suggestion of others to coat it and then let it sit for a minute (I left it alone for about 30 minutes while I went and did other things).  I also cut the bread crumbs in half and that was plenty the other half would have still been sitting there when I was done coating.  Of course I also sprinkled garlic, salt and pepper on it when I went to cook it.

The whole family loved this.  I used parmesan bread crumbs and added a little garlic powder, salt and pepper.  It was delicious!  Can't wait to have them again.

I was looking for a way to use up turkey cutlets that I had and this was really good.  The only negative is that there wasn't a lot of flavor but that could easily be fixed by adding garlic powder, onion powder, or really any spice you enjoy.  I didn't have any problems with the breading falling off, I used plenty of oil and refridgerated the cutlets for 30 min before frying.

I would agree that you wouldn't know this is even turkey. This is tender, moist, and very flavorful. I did marinate my turkey cutlets in a garlic, olive oil, red pepper, onion powder, and smoked paprika marinate for afew hours before I put them in the sour cream. This was yummy.

We thought these were wonderful. My breading fell off, but I don't think I had the oil hot enough to start with. I used 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 Miracle Whip and a squirt of Dijon mustard. Very tasty!

I like having an alternative turkey cutlet recipe but these weren't as good as I'd hoped they'd be. I make a similar chicken cutlet and thought this would be as good or better, but it wasn't.

The first time I used this recipe I used the sour cream with Dijon. It was good but the next time I used Miracle Whip with the Dijon and it was fantastic. I also added some onion powder and dried parsley in the bread crumb mixture.

Instead of the sour cream, I brushed the cutlets w/low fat plain yogurt and it was so good, my husband never knew, till the meal was over! Only used 1/8 cup of parm.

We loved this.  After reading other comments about breading, I put on the sour cream and crumbs right on the cold cutlets from the frig and let them come to room temperature with the breading on.  Everything came out perfect.  Thank you for the great idea.

To make this 5 stars I added the mayonnaise and mustard, salt, pepper, garlic powder and fried in olive oil.  Then I added this to the Italian Turkey Cutlet recipe (found on this site). It is a sauce recipe.  This was very bland without the extra seasoning. I added 1 tblsp. mayonnaise and a few squirts of mustard.  I used lowfat mayo and sour cream.  Came out great!

The sour cream and mustard sounded good, but I didn't want the breading to fall off.  So, I beat an egg, then added plain whole milk yogurt (instead of sour cream) and dijon mustard.  This mixture and the bread crumbs attached themselves firmly to the cutlets and the coating did not stick or fall off in the frying pan.  They tasted delicious.  I think this would work well with tilapia fillets, too.

I chose to BAKE this recipe because I am not supposed to have FRIED FOODS! Other reviewers also tried to bake it and fry it and IT DOESN'T WORK!You will need to use a LOT MORE than 1 tablespoon of oil to fry this! It is a tasty recipe but not to die for like Tanya says.

I didn't have a problem with the breading falling off.  I read the reviews and added a little flour.  I also gave the breading a sprinkle of garlic powder and onion powder.  I think it needed a little more taste.

Messy! didn't work! Crumbs fell off the sour cream. It was tasty, what stuck onto the cutlets. Next time I will try baking it. Or else I would not try it frying again.

Very easy, and pretty good, but it didn't have much flavor.  Pan-frying it didn't cook it all the way through, so I had to put it in the oven for about 10 minutes afterwards.

As far as taste goes...pretty good.  But so not worth the effort it takes to cook. Don't get me wrong cook time is not the issue.  It is getting the breading to stay on the chicken.  What a pain.

It was fair...one of two children ate it.  Despite tweaking the recipe to suit my family's taste the flavor was rather bland. 
Not positive that I'd make it again.

It was edible. But like the other reviewers stated, the coating just made a mess in the pan. It did not stick. I added ranch and dijon to add kick but it just all came off at the bottom of the pan. Next time I will stick It in the fridge and see what happens. Other than that it was a big boo.

Like some others in this recipe review, I had baked a turkey breast in the oven. Surprised how the sour cream, Djon mustard ( suggested by one of the reviewers) and crumbs  came out really nice, flavourful and tastey). Don't know if the unaltered recipe (fried) would have been as nice and moist as the baked one, hence, the four stars.

Excellent recipe as others suggested added scant tsp of dijon mustard for 1 serving.  Used non stick pan on 3.5 setting on electric stove for 6 minutes each side. Also as others suggested
let cutlets sit on wire rack b4 cooking. Very moist and tasty
will definitely make again

Delicious!  Instead of using sour cream, which I didn't have on hand, I replaced it with plain Greek yogurt, a healthier alternative, to coat the turkey cutlets.  I also baked instead of frying and they were moist and tasty.

I added the mayo like suggested, but still had a hard time getting the crust to stick. However, the flavors are great and the turkey was really moist. I used a tenderloin and pounded out sections. Very good!

This was delicious ! I added a little mayo to the sour cream and did refrigerate the breaded cutlets as suggested in the comments. My husband and I loved this. It will go into our rotation of favorites .

I did modify the cooking part of it. Instead of frying I baked it at 400*F for 25.  It was delicious! It’s probably better fried but I can’t eat fried foods!

The coating wasn't terribly flavorful, and yet I really liked this recipe! My package of cutlets was 1.7 lbs, and they were quite a bit thicker than 1/4", so I cut each cutlet into thirds.  For the coating, I made the Italian bread crumbs from scratch --  and I just realized that I forgot to include salt and pepper, which I'm sure was a factor in the mild flavor -- and grated some Parmesan cheese in my food processor. The crumbs were plenty for my additional turkey, and I only needed about 2 T of sour cream to generously coat all the sides of the six pieces. These came out tender and juicy, and I would definitely make them again, only with correctly seasoned crumbs next time!

I made it! I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and topped it with bruschetta!  Also, I pounded out the turkey with a meat tenderizer which make it super tender.

Very good - used greek yogurt instead of sour cream because that's what I had on hand. Mixed in some dijon per  others advice and used panko bread crumbs and baked instead of frying. Overall a hit, used leftovers on sandwiches and salads the next day.

I made this for dinner and it was wonderful! I did make a couple small changes: I used seasoned bread crumbs and corn flake crumbs; I also addes some melted butter to the crumb/cheese mixture and then I baked them at 425 for approx 35 minutes.  My husband said it was the best wild turkey he had ever ate

I would never make these again. Very little of the breading stayed on and the cutlets stuck to the pan even after having sprayed it with Pam. Wish I had read the reviews first. I would the have tried adding the mayo and mustard. Very disappointed usually the all recipes I have made of turned out great.

Since I'm eating low carb I used almond meal instead of bread crumbs.  It was fabulous!  The sour cream just works to keep the turkey moist.

The cutlets are cooking as I write this  and I'm so disappointed that the coating is coming off in the pan! I tasted a small piece and it's awesome but would be so much better with the breadcrumbs!  Where am I going wrong?

1st let me say very easy in terms of keeping ingredients minimal but getting a solid result. Simple but very good.

My biggest change would be adding a pinch or two of fresh black pepper and a pinch of sea salt to them as they are frying. 

Meat was tender and juicy, outside was crisp. I like a little "kick" in my food so I think I will try this with a few different spices added to the ingredient list.

Followed the recommendation to add dijon mustard to the sour cream and used Panko (what I had in the cupboard)for the breading. I did add Italian  seasoning to the crumbs but did not notice much flavor difference. Quick to make, reasonable flavor and would make again but will also look for something with a bit flavor profile. Did go well with my cranberries

When I try a recipe for the first time I always follow the recipe exactly. This recipe was just ok. Somewhat flavorful but also seemed very ordinary. The coating did not stick to the pan however there was minimal coating on the cutlets after cooking. Will probably make them again as it was a pretty quick and easy supper.  May try cooking them I the oven next time.

I made this with a few changes as suggested by others. I used Dijon mustard and low fat sour cream. Let the cutlets sit in fridge for a few minutes and then I baked them in oven at 400 degrees for about 35 - 40 minutes then broiled to brown them about 2 minutes each side. They came out crispy and no problem with the breading. Will make again!!!

Really good! I have to admit I was skeptical that my kids would like it, but it was a hit!  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream because that's what I had on hand and it really did make the turkey moist and yummy! I made my own bread crumbs quickly from some stale bread and made a quick gravy and served with rice and green beans. Thanks for the idea!

I made it for my family tonight and modified it a little as others suggested. It was fabulous! I'm not a great cook by any stretch but this was really easy to make and everyone enjoyed it!  I really do recommend putting the breaded meat in the fridge for a while before frying. I put them on a cookie sheet.

I took the advice from the other reviewers and used sour cream mixed with mayo to keep the breadcrumbs on. Worked pretty well. I used this to make my own recipe with ingredients I had laying about. I made some whole wheat spaghetti w/ pesto, cherry tomatoes and a pearl onion and tossed in the turkey cutlet which I sliced up. Came out pretty good!

I made this tonight and it was fantastic!  I used low fat sour cream and added some spicy brown mustard to the sour cream.  I also used whole wheat breadcrumbs and baked the cutlets that I sprayed with olive oil Pam on 375 for 25 minutes.  They were outstanding and will be included in my favorite recipes.  Enjoy!!

Tried this tonight and it was really good!  Even my fussy 3 year old liked it.  Didn't have any sour cream so just used a mixture of mayo and dijon mustard, then dipped the cutlets into a mixture of crushed corn flakes and whole wheat bread crumbs.  Seasoned with some poultry seasoning and popped into the hot oil.  Crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Will make this again.

I changed it up a bit because I didn't have breadcrumbs. I used Pepperage farms cornbread stuffing in place of the bread crumbs. I didn't use cheese and I used a little white wine with the oil. AWSOME! My family loved it! One of the best things I have ever made!

Easy, moist, flavorful and earned rave reviews from the kids.  I'll definitely make it again.  I used non-fat plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream (I always make that substitution to cut fat and add protein for dips, baked potatoes, stroganoff, etc) and also added a little dijon as others suggested.

meh, it was good, but I don't think it was significantly different from other breaded poultry recipes I've tried.

These had pretty good flavor and were fast to make.  I think I put the sour cream on a bit too thick in some places, as some spots had the breading falling off and not browning as well.  I used fat free sour cream.

I just made this for dinner and I loved it! Although, I added a few seasonings to the mix of Bread crumbs and parmesan. Zoes Kitchen, and Italian seasoning. It was delicious.

Excellent, moist turkey. Family favorite my daughter gobbles down. There are seldom leftovers, and when there are, they reheat well.

Taste great, but I made some changes.  Used the turkey breast chops, dipped in a egg/milk wash with salt/pepper/garlic powder and then the bread crumb/parm mixture.  Let it sit for a bit and cooked in olive oil/butter.  Great as a sandwich with provolone cheese too!  Hope I get the leftover one tomorrow for lunch!

Had some issues with this recipe. I used fresh bread crumbs and found the cutlets to stick to the pan, used my electric fry pan so the temp was not an issue as I can regulate that. Not only did they stick but the breading came off as well. I will try again but use the bread crumbs in the box instead, maybe that will help. We love turkey cutlets so I will make again, thanks for the recipe even though mine came out a bit of a mess. The taste was great, just a sticky mess.

I make these all of the time except that I never used sour cream before. I actually substituted Greek yogurt because I did not have sour cream. I was very impressed. I did have to use more olive oil than the recipe called for. My husband loved them. I did not mention the yogurt. Just told him a new ingredient.

I made this for dinner tonight, and got great reviews. I have three little, picky boys and they all ate it up. I did put in fridge for 15-30 minutes before cooking it after I had breaded it. They came out very well!

Too simple and a big hit! I was tempted to modify this. It sounded too simple, so I thought it might be plain. I was looking to disguise the turkey breast cutlets as chicken burgers, so before breading them, I divided the cutlets to fit on the buns. They were certainly moist and flavourful, and the family enjoyed their "chicken" burgers!

I did add some garlic and onion powder & a little paprika.  I'm someone who needs big flavor.   The turkey turned out well but my breading kept falling off the meat.  A little higher heat and a little more oil in the pan helped but did not solve the problem. Flavor was very good.   Everyone enjoyed it, even the kids liked it.

Hubby ate it all up pretty fast, so I guess it was good. :-)  thanks for another goodie for my Recipe Box.  I had no problem with crust coming off, but I did use a milk wash and then egg wash and then continued on with the recipe and I also added shredded fine sharp cheese to the crust mixture.

Tender they sure are. I followed the recipe to the letter but added some dijon mustard to the sour cream. They are an excellent new addition to my turkey recipes, i served it with rice-a-roni cheese and herb rice and we ended putting the rice on top of the pork. The flavor combination went perfectly!

Not quite sure how I feel about this recipe. Perhaps I put the sour cream on a little too thick, but the bread crumbs wanted to fall off the second side.  I even let the cutlets set in the fridge after coating for about 25 min. I also found the coating to be a bit mushy---again, perhaps because I used a bit too much sour cream? I also added a bit more EVOO because I have a slightly large fry pan, and was afraid of burning the coating. I would appreciate any and all feedback given. P.S.--Although this did not come out the way I would have liked, my daughters liked the tanginess of the sour cream.  I will make this again, maybe browning and then baking the cutlets.

Very good! I ran out of italian breadcrumbs so I used regular ones, plus 1 teaspoon italian seasoning and a few healthy shakes of garlic powder. I also baked these instead of frying. I put them on a rack, baked at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes. Very tasty, very moist. I'll make these again, thank you!

My family enjoyed these, however, I've got to find a way to keep them from sticking while frying.  It was very frustrating to find all of the crust on the bottom of the frying pan - especially when it tasted so awesome!

These were excellent. Very moist, I will try this with chicken and pork cutlets also.  I had a garlic and herb breadcrumb that I used that added a little more flavor.   A keeper.

I didn't have sour cream so i used the egg and milk mixture. However, if i had not added the garlic powder, Lawry's seasoning, and lemon pepper I think it would have been bland. Overall, tasted great. I used Turkey Fillets.

I used non fat plain yogurt and dijon mustard for the wet coating.  It was really flavorful, but I had an issue with the breading sticking to the pan.  I added more oil and it seemed to reduce the sticking, somewhat.  Overall, this is a keeper...but it just needs to be tweaked a little.

This was a very good way to do the cutlets and when you eat them you can not even tell they are Turkey. They tasted like chicken to me but was great and everyone wanted a second helping of them.

This was a great recipe! My kids loved it and asked for more. You will need more oil then it calls for, and in the sour cream I added a little ranch dressing, salt, pepper and garlic! We will make this again!

Nice and easy, everyone enjoyed it. I used low fat plain yogurt (no sour cream) and added the mustard. In the seasonings I added garlic powder and at the last minute I decided to throw in some curry. Next time, I will add more curry.  I used a non stick pan a little extra oil and had no problem with the breading falling off. I always heat the pan before I add the oil, then the cutlets sizzle when  put them in. Good stuff!

This tasted excellent. I had to substitute low-fat plain yogurt for the sour cream since I was out of sour cream, and I added Dijon mustard to the yogurt. I let the turkey cutlets sit in that mixture for an hour or so, then breaded them and refrigerated them for another half-hour. I still had a problem with the breading falling off, but enough stayed on that they tasted really, really good. I'll definitely try this again and maybe bump up the oil a little bit to see if I can keep more of that breading intact.

This was very good. I didn't use the cheese - only because I didn't have any on hand - and it was still good. I will make this again. Like another reviewer I did pound the cutlets first.

The sour cream is an excellent addition. I hate to fry and will do these in the oven (just spray w/ a bit of Pam to crisp them up). Came out tender and juicy and my 2 year old loves them.

The taste of this recipe was fine.  However, a nonstick skillet should be used to prepare the turkey or all the breading sticks to the pan.

Great flavor! I did have trouble with the breading sticking to the pan so next time I will try more of the oil and spacing them apart better.

Pretty good.....hubby didn't taste the sour cream, mayo, dijon mixture at all and I slathered the cutlets with this mixture. I didn't have a problem with the breading sticking either...just like making chicken cutlets, but did need a lot more oil to fry. Will make again....easy and tasty.

This was a good cutlet recipe and I will try it again.  However, I have a skillet that has a raised bottom. Because of this 1 TBLS of Oil was not enough and it just didn't brown up right.  Next time I will use a flat skillet or bake it.  Very moist though.

My mom made ham for Easter, which my husband and I do not eat.  So we were going to bring our own meat.  My husband mentioned getting turkey cutlets.  I had never cooked with them before.  I found this recipe and it was perfect.  Every one else was jealous when they saw how they turned out.  Hubby loved them.  Will be adding them to the menu often.
Pros:  Quick and easy. It took very little time to coat them and they cooked in 12 minutes.
Cons:  I had to use more olive oil so the batter would not stick to my pan.

These cutlets are delicious. "To die for"... well, no. I agree with the author. A recipe would have to be far more sinful for me to call a dish 'to die for'. ;). I also think the mustard gives it a little extra kick. Another reviewer didn't think 1 tbsp olive oil was enough, but it was enough for me. This is a healthy, low-fat dinner and I can't imagine it getting a bad review unless you don't cook it right, you don't like either turkey or breading... If you're trying to make a healthy dinner and you want something with some flavor, I highly recommend this dish!

This is is good with onion/garlic powder added to breading.  Let the tenders set until coating looks moist-1/2 hr.  Then put them in pan....I haven't tried them baked but the above method usually works (after breading sets).

My husband cooked this the other night & added the dijon mustard to the sour cream as suggested by others. He wanted to give it a 4/5, but I wasn't that impressed. It is moist & easy to make, but the best thing is my husband cooked, (he likes to). We'll do again.

All my breading fell off as it cooked.  The turkey wasn't all that tender either.  I won't make it again.  We ate it.  It wasn't bad, but not great.

The taste of this chicken is great-very moist. I added the dijon mustard as suggested. I also decided that the tenders needed to be BAKED not FRIED. I fried the first three tenders and ended throwing them away-very messy and hard to keep the bread cumbs on the tender. I baked the remaining five and was totally satisfied by the result. Definitely change this to a baked recipe, not fried-better for you too!

These were a-ok.  I really liked the zingy-ness of the sour cream (I used a full fat version).  However, we found this kind of plain, and I'd added parsley, garlic powder, and pepper to the breading.  This was probably partially my fault, though, as I used 3/4" thick cutlets rather than pounding to 1/4" (I'm lazy!).  I think this would have been better with thinner turkey.  As others have mentioned, the breading didn't stick well.  I let my cutlets sit for 15 minutes after breading before cooking...that usually helps the breading stick.  It didn't all fall off, but it didn't look company worthy, either.  This is probably a good recipe for picky eaters...my 9 month old boys liked it!  Thanks.
