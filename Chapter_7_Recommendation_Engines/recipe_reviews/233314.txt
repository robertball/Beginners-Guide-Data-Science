RE:  My recipe - Thanks for the review and I agree that the Kraft caramel was a bit *sticky*.  I used an off brand in my trials that were not so sticky.  So I think next time I'm going to try caramel topping and see how that works.  Maybe even melting the caramels and mixing in a bit of cream and salt then adding it in the middle of two layers.  The original recipe stated to cut the caramels in half and roll in Kosher salt - salted caramels!!  BTW, that is NOT a picture of my recipe, I'm not that good!!  :-D

I would give this 3.5 if there was a half-star rating, so I'll give it 4 because it IS better than 3.  I liked the flavors of this, but it was rather dense and the caramels stuck to the fork and my teeth (I used Brachs).  Also, the inside of the cake tested done with a toothpick but the edges were rather wet and gooey looking.  I recommend using a BIG mug, maybe 10oz or more; I used an 8 oz ramekin and the batter overflowed while cooking.  Overall enjoyed the hint of spice and was nice topped off with a little ganache.

Why do my chocolate chips sink to bottom I even mix them with dry ingredients... anyways . I make this a lot at least 2x month...Best microwave cake I have tried.. Lot of microwave cakes are nasty.I did not use caramel though or cayenne. I did not think it was dense. I thought it was normal cake texture for most part but richer.. But I had ops so want sujust scramble your egg up. Even if looks mixed mixes It more... I end up with egg piece in it first time... That was unpleasant but that's my fault. But in till I got egg piece it was great. I used 16 once foam cup it raised up in till about inch below the top of the cup... So make sure use big enough cup as it rises up... I was shocked as lot microwave cakes use double flour to get that size of cake... I love 2 less tb flour and 1 tb less sugar as less carbs

I couldn't really taste any of the cinnamon or the cayenne so will probably bump it up next time? I also added 1/2 teaspoon of espresso powder to deepen the chocolate flavor and it was beautifully rich!! The texture was excellent too - much like a lava cake. Instead of the caramels, I added a spoonful of salted caramel sauce I had leftover in my fridge and topped it with a pinch of fleur de sel before popping it into the microwave for 90 seconds. It rose deliciously and spongey with plenty of thick, decadent chocolate and caramel on the bottom, so digging into all the layers is highly recommended!

Amazing!  Very rich -- perfect size. I baked mine in a ramekin in a toaster oven as I don't have a microwave. Will make this again!  Perfect!!!

Made this exactly as written. Best cake in a mug I have had! The cayenne is very subtle, but adds a hint of spice. Delicious!

Delicious!  Have made it 3 times yet and I tried using Nestle Chocolate Chips with Caramel in them and it was even better than plain chocolate chips. 95 seconds was perfect timing for our microwave.

Everything a mug cake should be. Easy ingredients, simple and quick. And an indulgence. Did not have a caramel so used a bit of caramel topping sprinkled with the salt.  I will try the idea of making in ramekins another time.

I made this with ghiardelli dark chocolate melting wafers instead of chocolate chips and two chocolate covered  salted carmels.  It was fabulous!
