It turned out perfect! Here are some "Top Tips" for cooking a standing rib roast. You MUST use a meat thermometer for perfect results. Shop early in the day. Ask your butcher to cut the roast for you and leave in the bones! (I asked for a four-bone roast. It cost a lot, but could serve 12-15 people.) Season with Montreal Steak rub. At 2 hours, 20 minutes, the roast reached 124 degrees. I removed it, covered with a foil tent and let it rest for 20 minutes. The internal temperature was 134 degrees just before I carved it. WOW! It was a nice, deep pink color. Cooked but not raw. I was so happy I did a couple of cartwheels around the kitchen. (Just kidding.) My neighbor came over to see what I was cooking and agreed it was perfectly seasoned and cooked. I would use this recipe again. I made the Jus, but the meat was so flavorful, it really wasn't needed. Just a sprinkle of French salt to finish it. Thank you Campbell's!

I have a different cooking method I have used for decades, but I have the butcher cut the bones off, then tie them back on.  Great flavor for bones and mmmmmmmm! beef barley soup, but you also have a roast so easy to carve and serve.  Try it!

I cooked this roast at 350 because we like ours more medium to rare. I rinsed the roast, patted most of the water off and rubbed the outside  with dry Lipton Onion Soup mix. After skimming off most of the fat, the soup mix,  a little flour and water made a wonderful sauce to serve with the meat. Like others, I had the butcher cut off the bones and then tie them back on to be used in a soup later.  Very easy to slice! It turned out perfect. This is a great recipe for a beginner too because  if you follow the directions, you can't mess it up and will look like royalty when you present it to your in-laws!

Excellent recipe.  The only variation I made to the recipe was to add a teaspoon of Garlic Powder to the rib roast before putting into the oven.  Worked out great.

I followed the recipe, but used my oven probe.  Good thing I did, because it was done sooner than expected!  It tasted great, though, and the gravy was fantastic.

Turned out beautifully! It was my first time making prime rib. This recipe is fabulous, only addition I made was some fresh black pepper to the sauce.

I made it, it was fabulous! the only change I made was to add fresh mushrooms to the sauce, I only put them in for the last 5 minutes of cooking the sauce. Will be making this again, and again.

Good simple recipe. I decided to rub the rib  roast with Montreal Steak Spice. I cooked it at 350 for about 30 min. then turned it down to 250; then brought back up until I had the right internal temperature. I wrapped it in tin foil while  I got everything else ready including the gravy and garlic mahed potatos and carrots on the side.

Super easy recipe. Turned out great. Did not make the sauce for it, was fine on it's own.
